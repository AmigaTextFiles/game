                        @{b}WHAT IS UFO: ENEMY UNKNOWN?@{ub}

UFO: Enemy Unknown (called UFO from now on) is a turn-based strategy game
from Microprose. In the game, you are the commander of a covert ops group
dedicated to crushing alien threats, XCOM. There now follows an excerpt
from the UFO manual, page 6:

     It is the year 1999. Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) have started
     appearing with disturbing regularity in the night skies. Reports of
     violent human abductions and horrific experimentation has struck
     terror into the hearts of millions. Mass public hysteria has only 
     served to expose Earth's impotence against a vastly superior
     technology.

     Many countries have attempted to deal independently with the aliens. 
     In August 1998, Japan established an anti-alien combat force, the 
     Kiryu-Kai. Equipped with Japanese-made fighter aircraft, the Kiryu-Kai
     certainly looked like a powerful force. However, after 5 months of
     expensive operations they had yet to intercept their first UFO. The 
     lesson was clear: this was a worldwide problem which could not be dealt
     with by individual countries.

     On December 11th 1998, representatives from the world's most
     economically powered countries gathered secretly in Geneva. After much
     debate, the decision was made to establish a covert independent body
     to combat, investigate and defeat the alien threat. This organisation 
     would be equipped with the world's finest pilots, soldiers, scientists
     and engineers, working together as one multi-national force.

   This organisation was named the Extraterrestrial Combat Unit: XCOM.


                  @{b}WHAT TYPE OF AMIGA DO I NEED TO RUN IT?@{ub}

To run the AGA version, you will need an AGA Amiga with 2Mb of Chip RAM.
The game will be playable, but it will be slow. To make it faster, buy a 
memory upgrade or an accelerator card. There is also an ECS version
available, and this will also work on an AGA Amiga. Both versions were
given away free on Amiga Format's April 1998 Cover CD.


                @{b}ARE THERE ANY BUGS IN THE AMIGA VERSION?@{ub}

Not that I know of. There are two possible bugs which have been confirmed
for the PC version of UFO, but haven't been confirmed in the Amiga version.
These are:

   The Corrupted Intercept Bug:
   If you save a game whilst an air intercept is in progress, then the
   save game file will be corrupted and you won't be able to reload the
   game. The only workaround is to not save during an interception!

   The Wandering Soldier Bug:
   This only happens if the soldier is equipped with the Flying Suit. If
   he/she is at the very edge of the map, sometimes they move off it and
   cannot move back in again, meaning they are stuck there for the rest
   of the mission. They do get out at the end of a successful mission      
   though, so don't worry too much about losing your best soldiers!


         @{b}ARE THERE ANY SAVED GAME EDITORS FOR THE AMIGA VERSION?@{ub}

I know of two, they are both available on the AMInet, and they are:

   UFOEd.lha    game/patch
   This is the best of the two. It allows you to increase your soldier's
   abilities incredibly high. Imagine having 180 TU's per unit, each with
   110 bravery, and 180 on everything else, including the PSI skills!
   It also lets you edit your bases so that you get the best stuff first!
   THIS ONLY WORKS WITH THE AGA VERSION OF UFO!

   UFOCU.lha     game/patch
   This is quite good. It uses the same (almost) frontend as the game
   itself, and allows you to edit your soldier's abilities, upto a maximum
   of 160 on each attribute. It also heals any wounded soldiers instantly, 
   something which UFOEd cannot do.
   THIS ONLY WORKS WITH THE AGA VERSION OF UFO!

@endnode
@node howtwouse "How to use the Strategy Guide"
                     @{b}HOW TO USE THE UFO STRATEGY GUIDE@{ub}

Using this guide is really simple. Thanks to the AmigaGuide Hypertext
system, I am able to create user-friendly interfaces for documents. On the
many pages contained in this document, you will see @{"buttons" link} that look
like @{"this." link} Simply click on the button to take you to the page that it
says. It's as simple as that! Now for some pointers to the various chapters
of the guide:

   Those flashing lights in the night sky are not fun any more. Shoot them 
   down and then go to ground level!  Go to @{"Air Combat Strategies" LINK aircombat}
   for tactics on Interception missions.
     Once they hit the deck, it's time to send out a boarding party to 
   capture and kill any surviving aliens and capture any surviving alien 
   artefacts. Go to @{"Ground Combat Strategies" LINK gndcombat} for tips
   and tactics on the ground combat missions.
   
   If the UFO lands before you can shoot it down, send a boarding party
   immediately (if you have a decent squad) and make sure an interception
   craft is patrolling the site in case it takes off again. Note that if
   a UFO lands in an area, it usually means that there is an alien base 
   somewhere in that area. When you get the Hyper Wave Decoder, look for
   Alien Infiltration, because they sign a pact and build a base!

   If the aliens are terrorizing civilians, get your team to the site ASAP
      Alien Terror is the second-biggest threat to XCom. Sort them out
   QUICKLY! And remember that civilians must be saved at all costs, even if
   it means blowing their properties to bits to catch that last Chryssalid!

   At the start of the game, your technology is inferior to the aliens'.
      However, as you begin to build up stores of Alien Artefacts, you can
   research and manufacture these alien weapons, making you equal! 
   Go to @{"Research & Manufacture Strategies" LINK resch&man} to find out
   what to research first!

   The funding countries pay you a certain amount of money each month, and 
   may increase or decrease the funding level depending on their
   opinion of your efforts to keep aliens out of their area. Unfortunately, 
   that source of money is never enough. @{"Material Management" LINK materialm}
   tells you how you can make more money.

   Aliens will attempt to force governments into abandoning the X-COM
   project by attacking that country heavily until the government
   signs a pact with them. If that happens, your income decreases, and you
   hit a trouble spot. To stop it happening, go to @{" Miscellaneous Q&A" LINK miscellqa}

   If you're unlucky, the aliens will build a base on Earth. These act as
   infiltration centres, so should be dealt with quickly. Unfortunately,
   the alien bases are well hidden, and you will need a craft patrolling
   the suspected area for quite some time before they notice it. OR you can
   just let XCom agents discover it, but this takes more time. Clues to
   alien bases are a lot of alien activity without UFO's being detected, a
   lot of landed UFO's in the area, and if you get the Hyper Wave Decoder,
   LARGE UFO's, which are called Supply Ships. If you see one on an Alien
   Supply mission, follow it and you will find an Alien Base at the end of
   it's journey. Go to @{"Miscellaneous Q&A" LINK miscellqa} for tactics on
   alien base raids.

   When you've researched enough, you can travel to Mars and face the
   aliens on their home turf in the final battle! The outcome of this
   determines whether you beat the aliens once and for all, or fail
   miserably. Unfortunately, the final battle is very tough, so you'll need
   all the help you can get. This is where @{"Beating the Cydonia Stages" LINK beatcydon}
   comes in. In this section, you will find all you need to kick some
   serious alien butt!

   And finally, there's the appendices. These are a general collection of
   tables and charts with info about UFO types, alien attributes and stuff.
   To get there, click on @{"Appendix Of Tables" LINK appendice}

                 @{"-= XCOM BASES: GENERAL STRATEGIES =-" LINK xcombases}

                      @{b}XCOM BASES: GENERAL STRATEGIES@{ub}

                      @{b}WHERE SHOULD I BUILD BY BASES?@{ub}

Most UFO-players tend to start off in North America or Europe, as then you
have access to a lot of the funding countries. The second base should be in
the other area (so if you put the first in North America, the second would
go in Europe, and vice versa). That then means that the majority of
countries are in your radar range.

                    @{b}ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR BASE PLACEMENT@{ub}?

These are only suggestions! The first two areas are interchangeable. Only
six of your eight allowable bases are covered.

          Central Europe (western USSR and all of Europe, India)
                 North America / Rockies (USA and Canada)
                  Japan (eastern USSR, Japan, and China)
                      Eastern South America (Brazil)
                     Australia (Australia and Pacific)
             Central Africa (South Africa, Egypt, and Nigeria)

                       @{b}WHAT TYPE OF BASE DO I BUILD?@{ub}

You will probably have four to six types of bases.  As you play you will 
start upgrading them to the next level to create a more effective detection 
and interception network.

   @{b}Radar/Picket base@{ub}
   Just an access lift and some radars, plus maybe some storage for HWP 
   defences and/or living quarters for defending soldiers.
   This base detects UFOs.  Add more radars and defenses whenever possible.
   SMALL RADAR SYSTEM: Range=300 nm. Detection rate: 10% rotation / 10 mins.
   LARGE RADAR SYSTEM: Range=450 nm. Detection rate:  5% rotation / 10 mins.
   HYPER WAVE DECODER: Range=500 nm. Detection rate: 100%rotation / 10 mins.


   @{b}Interception base@{ub}
   Two hangars, with either Interceptors or Firestorms. Storage space for
   craft weapons and ammunition. Living quarters for defence team and at
   least a Defence Strength of 2500.
   I have an Interception base with 5 Fusion Ball Defences and in an
   average month, 15 out of 15 Battleships were destroyed!

   @{b}Transport base@{ub}
   At least one transport (Skyranger, Lightning, or Avenger), as well as 
   living quarters and storage. Houses soldiers and equipment. Used to board
   UFOs and/or attack alien bases.
   Can be created from both radar base or airbase by adding a hangar for the
   transport. Remember to add more storage space for the increased need for 
   weapons and ammo as well as captured artefacts.
   Also add an alien containment in case you capture a live alien.

   @{b}Central Command@{ub}
   The EVERYTHING base, includes research and manufacturing.  Your first 
   base is your first (and probably only) central base, where all the 
   research and manufacturing is done.  Most people have this configuration 
   instead of the next two.

   @{b}Research Department@{ub}
   You should keep this away from your main bases, The Arctic is a good
   place. All you need are living quarters, and laboratories, and a Stores
   facility for storing items to be researched. As research is independent,
   you have to transfer the item to be researched to this base. You only
   need to transfer one though! Plonk in some defences if you like, but as
   not many UFOs are shot down near the base, it should be safe.

   @{b}Manufacturing Base@{ub}
   You just need living quarters and workshops for the engineers, and
   general stores for storing the results, and maybe a hangar if you
   are manufacturing crafts.  Transfer between bases are cheap, and
   you don't need anything else.  A nice place to put this is
   Antarctica. Again, defences aren't really necessary.

   @{b}Storage Base@{ub}
   Only necessary if you like manufacturing. To avoid the 80 items limit,
   I have my own base just for storing things. Filled with General Stores
   and maybe a hangar for a spare craft.

I have this configuration of bases:

   Central Command   (North America)  Defence Strength: 4200
   Interception Base (North Africa)   Defence Strength: 4200
   Manufacturing     (Arctic)         Defence Strength: 1200
   Storage Base      (Antarctic)      Defence Strength: 0


                       @{b}HOW SHOULD I BUILD MY BASES?@{ub}

        Plan for the worst situation (an alien raid)

   Design A    Design B
   HHHHHH      HHHHHH
   HHHHHH      HHHHHH
   A           X
   X XXXX      XXXXXX
   X XXXX      X XXXX
   XXXXXX      A XXXX   H=Hangars  A=Access Lift  X=anything else

   Design A:  ALL vulnerable areas are concentrated to ONE part of the
   base, limiting possible attacks along that ONE long corridor.

   Design B:  Isolates Hangar from Access Lift.  Since hangars have no
   doors, blaster bombs and/or fusion tanks can destroy everything in
   those spaces with one shot per hangar, counting the secondaries due
   to the fuel drums.  The access lift can be blocked by proximity
   grenades.

   @{b}Keep tabs on a bases progress@{ub}:
   Plan ahead for expansion.  Use the BASE INFORMATION button frequently 
   (once every 10 game days?) and start construction of things BEFORE you 
   actually run out.

   @{b}Initial modifications:@{ub}
   The first things you should add to your base are:
      General Stores     - More storage for ammo and artefacts
      Alien Containment  - For interrogating captured aliens.
      Large Radar System - Improved UFO detection.
   and then add Laboratories and Workshops when needed. Defences are also a
   priority once you get quite far into the game.

   @{b}Keep a hangar available!@{ub}
   You should always keep a hangar SOMEWHERE available for new construction 
   purposes.  Transferring crafts is quite cheap! See base types for details

   @{b}How to defend a base@{ub}
   Aliens do try to raid your base.  The loss of the base means the loss of 
   everything based on it.  So what can you do to prevent the destruction of
   your base? Read on!

                @{b}Build defences@{ub}
      You can build four types of base defences:

                           DAYS  COST  UPKEEP   DEF. STRENGTH   ACCURACY
          Missile Defence   16   200k    5k          500           50%
          Laser Defence     24   900k   10k          600           60%
          Plasma Defence    36   1200k  12k          900           70%
          Fusion Defence    36   1800k  14k         1200           80%
          
          These two facilities help with base defences.
          Grav Shield       38   2300k  15k 
          Mind Shield       33   1300k   5k   

          The Grav Shield repels a UFO, allowing the defences to get in an
          extra shot! Quite useful.
          The Mind Shield cloaks the base from an alien scout (not for
          long) though, giving you more time to intercept before the scout
          contacts it's battleship.

      I recommend 4800 defence strength in total. My bases are that, and in
      the course of a month, 15 out of 15 battleships have been destroyed!
 
      @{b}Attack the incoming UFOs@{ub}
      Usually you can detect the UFOs as they come in for the attack. Shoot 
      them down first.  If you have Hyper Wave Decoders, watch for UFOs with
      "retaliation" missions.  Those are coming after your bases. The small 
      UFOs that come first are scouts. If they see your base, then comes the
      battleships.

      @{b}Watch the "80-item limit"@{ub}
      If the aliens make it through your defences, you will have to defend
      yourself.  Only the first 80 items in storage can be used for your
      Defence, so this is another reason to sell off those excess inventory.
      Besides, you need the cash.  Do NOT keep electro-flares in the 
      warehouse as those are often the first items in the 80-item
      list!  Lasers and HWPs are on top so keep them.

      @{b}Keep some HWPs just in case@{ub}
      If the worst comes to the worst, have a few HWP's around to defend
      the base. You'll probably have Hovertank/Launcher's by the time the
      aliens start getting peeved at your base operations, so use them, as
      they can shoot round corners. Also, a soldier armed with a Blaster
      Launcher is great!
 
      @{b}Booby trap the rooms!@{ub}
      Booby trap all rooms that you must abandon, usually by throwing
      proximity grenades at the doors.  Any alien steps in, BOOM!  You can 
      clear them by dropping a regular grenade on top of them.

      @{b}Leave some soldiers!@{ub}
      This is not a verified fact. During an alien raid, all crafts are       
      evacuated, along with everything on board, and this also means the 
      soldiers. So always keep some spare in case the aliens find the base.
      Some players report that their soldiers stayed during a raid. No one
      has successfully verified this though, so send me a reply if you
      have!

   So defending a base needn't be a challenge. If you stick to those
   guides, you should be bopping the aliens in no time at all!

                  @{"-= AIR COMBAT STRATEGIES =-" LINK aircombat}

@endnode
@node aircombat "Air Combat Strategies"
                           @{b}AIR COMBAT STRATEGIES@{ub}

Air Combat and Interceptions are the fundamental part of playing UFO,
without them there would be no progress in the game, as you couldn't shoot
down the UFOs to capture the aliens and equipment! So if you have to use
air combat, use it right! This little chapter should give you some hints on
doing just that!

                             @{b}INTERCEPT TACTICS@{ub}
   Interception of UFOs is important.  Intercepting UFOs over funding 
   countries tells them you are doing your job and keeps them happy.
   Successful interception and shoot-down means you can capture aliens, 
   alien bodies, and alien equipment.  Even if interception is unsuccessful
   you may be able to discover an alien base.

      @{b}Don't get your shoes wet!@{ub}
      Try to attack an UFO over land, because if you shoot it down at sea
      no one can get to it.  If you intercepted it over water, press
      minimize and click over to 1 minute time step until you ran out of
      fuel, it lands, it outruns you, or you get back over land.  If you
      fly back over land, change back to 5 seconds, then commence attack!

      @{b}Get back to base! That's an order!@{ub}
      When you send multiple crafts after one UFO and the UFO gets shot
      down, the shooter will go home, but other crafts will continue onto
      the crash site and THEN return.  Instead, click on them and turn
      them back early (Return to base).  They will return earlier, thus
      be refuelled and rearmed faster for the next mission.

      @{b}Don't let them get away!@{ub}
      Even if a UFO has landed, keep an interceptor on top of it if possible
      until your landing craft arrives for the action. That way, if the UFO 
      takes off, you still have a chance to shoot it down before it evades
      detection!

      @{b}Don't use the wrong weapons!@{ub}
      Before attacking click on the VIEW UFO button to take a look at
      your target before deciding whether to attack or not.  Attacking
      with the wrong weapons means either the loss of the interceptor or
      the UFO totally destroyed so that nothing can be recovered.

        @{b}Very Small / Small UFOs@{ub}
        Interceptors with Stingray missiles and cannons can only handle
        very small or small sized UFOs.  Attacking larger UFOs means heavy
        damage or even destruction.

        @{b}Medium UFOs@{ub}
        Interceptors with Avalanche missiles can handle medium UFOs.  One
        Avalanche will blow a very small UFO into pieces though.

        @{b}Large UFOs@{ub}
        Interceptors with Plasma beam and/or Avalanche missiles can handle
        large UFOs, but not VERY large UFOs.  Plasma beam may blow small
        UFO into pieces.

        @{b}Very Large UFOs@{ub}
        Multiple Interceptors with plasma beam and/or Avalanche are needed
        to attack very large UFOs, and you'll probably lose a few, since
        one shot from battleship and the interceptor is destroyed or
        crippled.

        Interceptors with fusion ball launchers can attack very large UFOs
        if it does so at maximum distance, but will probably run out of
        ammo first since they are two shots each.

        The only way to "safely" attack alien battleships is to use
        Firestorms and Avengers, and even then you will probably be heavily
        damaged (as in 20% to 60% damage), even with Fusion Balls and
        Plasma beams.

        @{b}Differences among Aggressive, Normal, and Cautious attacks@{ub}
        The difference between Aggressive, Normal, and Cautious attacks
        were not explained clearly in the manual.  Here's my version:

         @{b}Cautious Attack@{ub}
         Attack the UFO from maximum range of the available weapon(s) at a
         slow firing rate. Cause least damage per shot, useful when you
         want prisoners or attacking a small target and your weapons may be
         overkill.

         @{b}Normal Attack@{ub}
         Attack the UFO from maximum range of the available weapon(s) at
         standard firing rate. Cause average damage per shot, suffice for
         most attacks if your weapon outrange the enemy's.

         @{b}Aggressive Attack@{ub}
         Attack the UFO as fast as possible, as close as possible, and fire
         as fast as possible. Cause most damage per shot, but exposes the
         craft to enemy return fire.

      @{b}Applications of each attack mode@{ub}
      To determine which attack mode to use, you need to look at the UFO
      first. Click on the VIEW UFO icon and take a look at what type of
      UFO it is. See section A.3 for list of UFOs and recognition chart.

      Of all the UFOs, only a Battleship is a major threat to your crafts.
      Battleships have a weapon range of 70 km, longer than even fusion 
      balls. NO OTHER UFO has this kind of firepower. The only way to ensure
      destruction of a Battleship is to use Firestorm or Avenger with dual 
      Plasma Beams. One shot from a Battleship is usually enough to destroy
      Interceptors, so do NOT attack Battleships with Interceptors.

      When attacking Battleships with Avengers and Firestorm, use
      Aggressive Attack.  After several Battleship interceptions with an
      Avenger, I've found that using Aggressive Attack with an Avenger I
      get approximately 40% damage (once as low as 30%) where as I
      usually get 60% damage in Normal attack.  Firestorm got hit pretty
      hard against Battleships, usually 50-80% damaged.
      All other UFOs can be safely tackled with Avalanche missiles and
      Plasma Beams, since you can stay at maximum range and avoid their
      fire.  Supply Ship and Terror Ship have range of 50 km, which is
      the second longest, but Avalanche and Plasma Beam outrange them.

                           @{b}CRAFT WEAPONS TACTICS@{ub}

      @{b}Get Plasma Cannon quickly@{ub}
      Plasma Cannon is THE best craft weapon in the game, with 99 shots
      and 54 km range. Interceptors armed with twin plasma cannons can
      even tackle large (though not VERY large) UFOs safely by remaining
      outside the UFO's weapon range.

      @{b}Get rid of Stingray Missiles and Cannons@{ub}
      Stingrays are only good for hitting VERY SMALL and maybe SMALL UFOs
      due to the short range (30km for Stingray, 12km for cannon).  Replace
      Stingray and Cannon with Avalanches as soon as possible.  You can
      also forget about the laser cannon but at least it does not use
      ammo.

                          @{b}FINDING THE ALIEN BASES@{ub}
      There are two ways of discovering an alien base. First of all, you can
      let XCom agents find them for you, but they are not very efficient, and
      it could take time. Alternatively, you could look at the graphs to find
      high amounts of UFO activity, and if that area is one where you aren't
      getting any UFO reports, ther's probably a base there.

      When you get the Hyper Wave Decoder, you can look for UFOs on Supply 
      missions. When you spot a Supply Ship on an Alien Supply mission, use
      an empty Skyranger or an Avenger to follow it. Follow it to it's last
      known position and keep patrolling. After a few hours game time, the
      base will be discovered!

                         @{b}GROUND COMBAT STRATEGIES@{ub}

There is much debate over which area of the game is most important, I think
that personally it is Air Combat, but being skilled in Ground Combat is
also an attribute that every UFO player needs if he is going to defeat the
aliens. So here are a few basic hints on how to beat the crap out of them.

                      @{b}BASIC EQUIPMENT CONSIDERATIONS@{ub}
   Since you only get 80 items per craft, you have to plan carefully.
   
      Lasers are useful since they do not need ammo, saving you a lot of
      items.  They also cause a nice amount of damage (though not as much
      as plasma weapons, thus the trade-off).

      Carry Blaster Launchers and Bombs as soon as you obtain them. They
      are incredibly useful, and can punch holes in UFO walls! Note that
      Blaster Launchers start out UNLOADED so don't forget to load them
      during the initial equip squad screen!

                             @{b}BASIC CRAFT LOADS@{ub}
        
      Skyranger: 2 HWPs and 6 soldiers.  Divide them up to 1 HWP / 3
                 person fire teams, with HWP as scouts.  If necessary you 
                 can split each team up further into pairs.

      Lightning: Only soldiers. HWPs cannot be carried on Lightning.

      Avenger  : 4 HWPs and 10 soldiers is good.  Use 2 teams of 1 HWP and
                 2 soldiers, and 2 teams of 1 HWP and 3 soldiers, or you can
                 make them all 1 HWP and 2 soldiers, with two soldier as the
                 special weapons team with blaster bombs and/or psi attacks.

                              @{b}ROOKIE TRAINING@{ub}
      You start off with a squad of Rookies. As your squad builds up, you will
      need to train your rookies. Do this by taking them into the heat of
      battle. You gain experience by doing things. If you need more accuracy 
      on your firing, take more shots. Simple as that!

                        @{b}TAKE A MIXED SET OF WEAPONS@{ub}
      If you take a variety of weapons, you can be prepared for all threats.
      It is no good just taking auto cannons, because some aliens are more
      resistant to them. Take a selection, like Laser Rifle, Heavy Plasma and
      Auto Cannon. By the way, Heavy Plasma is the best rifle in the game!

       @{b}MISCELLANEOUS EQUIPMENT IS IMPORTANT! USE THEM ALL THE TIME!@{ub}
   * Medikits are important.  In addition to healing fatal wounds they can 
     raise morale if used on panicking troops as well as revive unconscious 
     soldiers which have been stunned/inhaled too much smoke.
   * Motion detectors are only useful if you have a vague idea where an 
     alien could be, because they only have a 9square range. Also, the 
     alien must move, otherwise it won't be detected.
   * Mind Probes are useful for identifying alien leaders and commanders, or
     any specific type of alien you want to capture. Make sure you have an 
     arsenal of stun weapons.
   * Proximity grenades are great for blockading large UFO doors. Just drop 
     one next to the door and wait for them to come out. Do it like this
     though!


     ------+    D=Door, A=Alien, P=Prox. Grenade
           |    
          AD P  If you plonk the P right next to the door, the sensors will
           |    activate when the door is closed, so the alien won't be 
     ------+    hurt. If you put it there, he has to step outside for it to
                go off!

                      @{b}DEPLOYING UNITS FROM YOUR CRAFT@{ub}
   When moving the soldiers out of the craft, make sure that you only move
   two at a time, next to the landing stanchions are good. If you do more 
   than two, you may be targetted by a grenade, or in the worst case, a
   Blaster Bomb.

                      @{b}SPREAD OUT AND COVER EACH OTHER@{ub}
   Here's a simple demonstration with a four person fire team:

   X                          X
         X             X
              ===>>
   X                          X
         X             X

   The two in front did not move, while the two in the back moved up beyond 
   them for about that much distance. The recommended separation between 
   team members is between four to six squares, and the normal leap frog 
   distance is about that much as well. That way, when one person spots a 
   target, most likely every one will be able to see and fire at the target.
   The two who stayed in place should turn around and face out and/or back 
   to prevent rear attacks.  Keep plenty of TUs handy for opportunity fire.

                             @{b}USE THE TERRAIN!@{ub}
   The trees that are usually plastered over ground missions make great
   cubbyholes. All you do is stand behind a tree, and pray that the 
   aliens weapon isn't powerful enough to take it down. This next idea 
   may sound crazy, but it works just as well!
   Stand behind an alien! Other aliens don't check who is in the line of
   fire before shooting at you, and if one of the bullets can hit the
   alien, you are saved! Just make sure the alien you're standing next to
   is unarmed, and if it's a Chryssalid, either mind-control it or bugger
   off before you get zombified!
        
                  @{b}THE ALIEN VERSION OF A TRAFFIC ISLAND.@{ub}
   Aliens usually move forward, take a shot, then turn 180 and move back. 
   So, if you see them in their movement phase and don't see
   them in yours, move forward a little, and you may see them.  For example,
   they move like this...

                   visible
                    range
                      |
               S -----/-->S
                     |    |                     YOU
                   S<-\---+
                      |

                        @{b}CATER FOR OPPORTUNITY FIRE!@{ub}
   To use the Opportunity Fire functions, you need enough TU's to take a
   shot, and the soldier ideally needs a reaction level of 50+. If none of
   the soldiers qualify, try moving them in front of the UFO door and
   making them kneel. This is great against Mutons and Snakemen because
   they leave the UFO a lot.

                            @{b}USE HWPs AS SCOUTS@{ub}
   Hovertanks are the best units in the game to act as scouts, as are the
   other HWP's. They are immune to psi-attacks and have tons of TU's. 
   Just make sure that the HWP does just scouting. If you want the
   soldiers to gain experience, look for aliens using the HWP, and shoot at
   it using a regular unit.

                     @{b}DON'T LET ALIENS USE THE TERRAIN!@{ub}
   This is especially important on Terror missions. Hovertank/Fusion
   Launcher is ideal for this, but if not, just use Rocket Launchers and
   grenades. Even lasers can be used. 
   Just blow apart a building or forest, and any aliens hiding in it will
   either be killed, spotted or peeved. You see, you've just destroyed it's
   hiding place. And remember, there is no penalty for destroying civilian
   PROPERTY, just civilians! So go ahead and destroy the city just to get
   that last alien, if you have to!

             @{b}LISTEN TO AURAL CLUES IN THE ALIEN MOVEMENT PHASE@{ub}
   The sounds in alien movement phase can reveal important clues to alien 
   locations.  Normal door sounds means the aliens are near a regular 
   building (farm house, etc.)  Hydraulic door sounds means the automatic 
   doors were used.  Two sounds close together means someone just went in 
   and immediately came back out (or vice versa).
   The length of the alien movement phase is also proportional to the number
   of aliens left on the map.  (Remember that stunned aliens or civilians 
   can wake up!)
   
                         @{b} ALIENS ARE ALWAYS WARM.@{ub}
   Aliens obviously don't feel draughts, because they leave all the doors
   open when they go through farmhouses. That little snippet is useful to
   know if you see an open door, and you're certain that none of your
   soldiers have been near it.


                              @{b}WEAPON TACTICS@{ub}
   Different weapons should be used differently and in different 
   circumstances. Here are some suggestions on how to best employ the
   different weapons.

      @{b}Pistols and Rifles@{ub}
      Use them only when you have to, sniper style. Dump them for lasers
      as fast as possible.  They use clips and doesn't do much damage.
      they may be enough to use against Sectoids, who have little armour,
      but not against tougher enemies.

      @{b}Heavy Cannon@{ub}
      Even though it is more accurate than the auto-cannon, it is a lot
      heavier, and only has 6 rounds loaded. It also has no auto-shot mode!
            
      @{b}Auto-Cannon@{ub}
      Probably the most effective weapon in the early game, with auto
      mode, three types of ammo, and 14 shot magazine.  Still, 14 shots
      is not much in auto-mode, and three magazines can run out on you
      pretty quick.  It is also HEAVY.  Of course, auto-fired HE rounds
      can clear a forest REAL quick.

      @{b}Rocket Launcher@{ub}
      Rocket Launcher packs your biggest punch in the early game, and
      being an area weapon makes it invaluable in dealing with nasty
      Reapers and other loathsome creatures.  On the other hand, you can
      only carry three of them, and they only fly in straight lines.
      Have another member carry reloads for you.

      @{b}Laser Pistol, Laser Rifle, and Heavy Laser@{ub}
      Forget the Heavy Laser.  The 35% more damage that it does is offset
      by having no auto mode and decreased accuracy.  You can probably
      forget the pistol also, but you need to research it to get laser
      rifle.  Laser Rifles are arguably the best squad weapon in the game,
      needing no ammo, with decent accuracy and damage.

      @{b}Grenades and High Explosive@{ub}
      Get alien grenades when you can, but regular grenades would do.
      Use them to flatten small buildings and take down walls so aliens
      have nowhere to hide.
      Proximity Grenades are similar, but they detonate when a unit moves
      within it's sensing radius. Remember that a unit can be an alien,
      an XCom soldier, or a civilian. Also, because they have a 1-square 
      sensing radius, don't chuck them next to a UFO door, like this:

      ----+    Because when the alien steps out, the grenade will go off
          |    and just come in contact with the now-closed UFO door,
         ADP   allowing the alien to survive.
          |    If you want to use Proximity Grenades properly, you do it
      ----+    like this:

      ----+    Because the alien steps out, into the grenades sensing
          |    radius, and hey presto! the alien cannot retreat behind a
         AD P  closed door, so he becomes fried Sectoid/Muton/whatever!
          |
      ----+    A=Alien        D=UFO Door        P=Proximity Grenade

      @{b}Plasma Pistol, Plasma Rifle, and Heavy Plasma@{ub}
      Forget the plasma pistols. Plasma Rifle and Heavy Plasma are good
      weapons, and the Heavy Plasma is the only heavy weapon in the game
      with auto mode.  On the other hand, Heavy Plasma is "heavy" and
      normal soldiers can't carry it very well.
        Heavy Plasma should only carried by a few select members, due to
      possible shortages in clips.  Also, with only 80 items per craft,
      having so many clips around can be a problem.
        Heavy Plasma can punch through inner walls of UFOs when auto-fired
      a couple times, useful for pincer attacks.
        I'd just like to say this: HEAVY PLASMA IS KING! GET IT AS SOON AS
      YOU CAN! IT WILL BE WELL WORTH THE WAIT! IT IS SUPERB-DUPERB!
      Aah, glad to get that off my chest!

      @{b}Blaster Launcher@{ub}
      Blaster launcher is probably one of the greatest weapons in the
      game.  It is expensive, its ammo is expensive, but it is VERY
      useful.  You can blow up things in ANY direction, turn around
      corners, go up and down stairs, flatten entire barns, even punch a
      hole in UFO's outer hull!  With a bit of management one soldier can
      carry up to 5 reloads (2 on belt and 3 in backpack).
        Leave some Blaster Bombs on the floor and get the weapon carrier
      to kneel on the reloads, making more available!
        If you are attacking a Battleship, blow open one of the engine legs
      using the Blaster Launcher to save you going up the central
      grav-lift. Alternatively, blow a hole in the roof of a UFO and go in
      top to bottom. I have had more success against battleships this way!
        A Blaster Bomb can also be useful when using HWP's. Blow a hole in 
      the space next to a UFO door and then move the HWP in through the
      enlarged entrance. Nice!

      @{b}Small Launcher@{ub}
      This is the only weapon (apart from Stun Rod) which is designed for
      stunning creatures. Although my favourite tactic is to mind-control
      an alien, position a stun-rod soldier next to it, and on the next
      turn, stun it until it drops, the Small Launcher can make the process
      a lot easier. Watch out for Floaters, they use these a LOT!

                              @{b}ASSAULT TACTICS@{ub}
   * Your first priority is to make sure no aliens can ambush you as you 
     deploy.  This makes HWP invaluable as they are often the first ones to 
     exit the craft, saving your soldiers from getting shot. They also take 
     several hits, even from heavy plasma, before being destroyed.
   * Your second priority is to scout and clear out the map of any stray 
     aliens, while locating your primary objective.  When boarding UFOs, the
     objective is the UFO itself.  When attacking  alien base, the objective
     is the alien command center.  Spread out into fire teams of two 
     soldiers or one soldier and one HWP and search. One team should guard 
     the entrances to the objective when found.
   * Your third priority is to secure the objective.  Leave a team guarding 
     the entrance to the objective in case the perimeter sweep missed 
     somebody.

                         @{b}DON'T FORGET YOUR WOGGLE!@{ub}
   There should be one person (scout) whose specialty is open doors so that
   other people can shoot through the open door.  The person with the best 
   reactions and most TU's should get this role.

                      @{b}HAVING A REVERSED MIND IS COOL!@{ub}
   On some missions, you may notice that the UFO's roof is blown open.
   This is caused by the Power Source exploding on impact with the turf.
   You can use this hole to your advantage. If you get four soldiers to
   stand on each of the corners, you can peek inside and kill any aliens
   left inside. You need flying suits for this though!
      You may prefer to blast the roof open using a Blaster Launcher. This
   is especially useful when attacking Battleships. Whenever I need to 
   capture a Commander, I always let the Battleship get shot down, and then
   I attack from the top-down, Mind Probing the aliens until I find him.
   Then I stun him, and get him back to base. I usually don't finish the
   mission unless there are only a couple left.

                      @{b}USE THE WINDOWS IN YOUR CRAFT!@{ub}
   Your craft have windows, so turn your rearmost soldiers or HWPs around 
   and take a look.  This will let you know the general terrain layout 
   before you even get out of the transport.

                @{b}FIND THE CENTRAL COMMAND IN AN ALIEN BASE!@{ub}
   The command centre in an alien base is very distinctive, it looks a bit
   like this (not drawn to scale)
   
   +---------W---------+
   |                   |
   | +---------------+ |     D= Door (3 space doors!)
   | |               | |
   | |               | |     W= Window (watch out for passing aliens!)
   | |               | |
   | |               | |     G= Central grav-lift
   D |      GGG      D |
   D |      GGG      D |
   D |      GGG      D |     The gravlift takes you up to the second level
   | |               | |     of the command centre, where the base commander
   | |               | |     normally lives. He usually never comes out of
   | |               | |     this two-level command centre. Fire a blaster
   | |               | |     bomb in through the two walls and march right
   | +---------------+ |     up into the gravlift. Aliens will come at you
   |                   |     from all directions, so watch out!
   +---------W---------+
                     

                             @{b}CAPTURING ALIENS@{ub}
   Successful capture of live aliens is a very important aspect of UFO.
   Without it, you would never progress, because to progress, you must
   research! The table that follows shows the information that aliens
   yield when researched:
 
   Commander              Cydonia or Bust *
   Leader                 The Martian Solution **
   Medic                  Species Information (not just their own)
   Engineer               Specifications of UFOs
   Navigators             Hyper Wave Decoder
   Soldiers               Mission Information. 

   All aliens give you Alien Origins, and species information (their own)
        
    * Cydonia or Bust is the research needed to complete the game.
   ** The Martian Solution must be researched to advance to Cydonia or Bust.


                      @{b}BUILD ALIEN CONTAINMENT FIRST!@{ub}
   The very first improvement you should make to ALL your strike bases is
   an Alien Containment facility. If you don't, any live aliens brought
   back will die on arrival at the base. Remember that aliens are only
   returned to the base of the craft which captured the alien!

                         @{b}HOW DO I CAPTURE ALIENS?@{ub}
   There are three ways:

      1: Shoot them and pray that they don't die (ie, they don't scream)
      2: Use a Stun Rod to stun the alien.
      3: Use the Small Launcher and Stun Bomb to stun an alien from a
         distance.
 
   Bizarrely, I seem to have more success using Number 2 than Number 3?

                         @{b}WHAT ALIENS DO I CAPTURE?@{ub}
   It depends on what information you want. Check the information table
   above for information on what rank gives what information. If you want
   PSI-Powers (PSI-Lab, PSI-Amp etc) you need to capture either an 
   Ethereal (any rank) or a Sectoid Leader/Commander. Terrorists are
   exactly the same as soldiers.
      You cannot capture Cyberdiscs or Sectopods, these just blow up when
   their health bar reaches stun level. 
   If you have Flying Suits, and you want to capture a live Chryssalid
   (it can be done!) simply stun it and if you run out of TU's before it
   drops, simply hover above it. As it only has Hand-To-Hand Combat 
   capabilites, it cannot attack you!

                         @{b}KEEP A BACKUP AVAILABLE!@{ub}
   Always have another soldier ready to back you up should a stun attempt
   fail. Make him stand in front of the alien to keep it's attention, 
   whilst you sneak up behind and stun it. This way, if the first attempt
   fails, the second soldier can have a crack at it.

                             @{b}USING STUN RODS@{ub}
   The only disadvantage against Stun Rods is that you must be adjacent to
   the alien to be able to stun it. Click on the Stun Rod and then select
   Stun from the Popup menu. If it's successful, the alien will collapse 
   (without screaming), if not, prepare for retaliation!

                            @{b}USING STUN BOMBS@{ub}
   The main advantage a Stun Bomb possesses over a Rod is their ability to
   stun more than one alien at a time. Unfortunately, most aliens need more
   hits from a Bomb than they would need from a Rod. Even so, Bombs are 
   useful when attacking groups of aliens, particularly Sectoids!
      If the alien is hit by a Stun Bomb, take a Snap Shot at it, and if it
   hits, it might drop unconscious. However, in the majority of cases, it
   will die instead.

                  @{b}DO NOT STUN MIND-CONTROLLED ALIENS [?]@{ub}
   Another UFO Strategy Guide says that you should NOT stun Mind-Controlled
   aliens because technically they are on your side. They ask for
   verification on the matter. Here it is:

      @{b}Stun Rod@{ub}
      You cannot Stun your own units using a Stun Rod.
                
      @{b}Stun Bomb@{ub}
      It is much harder to Stun your own units using a Bomb than when
      stunning an alien, so most soldiers can withstand a LOT more hits!
      It is still possible though, and if it happens, wait until it is
      no longer under your control, and then stun it!

                           @{b}ANTI-REAPER CAMPAIGN@{ub}
   To protect yourself against Reapers during missions, simply hide in a
   building which has only got a one-space door. Reapers, being 4-space 
   creatures, cannot fit through. You can now torture it as much as you
   want! Just don't shoot the wall down!

                          @{b}PSI / ANTI-PSI TACTICS@{ub}
   If you want PSI powers, you must capture an Ethereal or a Sectoid Leader
   or Commander. Then you must build a PSI-Lab to train your soldiers. Here
   are some tactics for causing and absorbing PSI attacks from aliens.

                                @{b}CAUSE PANIC@{ub}
   If you successfully make an alien panic, the chances are that the alien
   will drop his weapons, and as thet never pick them up again (?) you 
   have made this alien safe (except PSI-aware aliens) 
      Panic can also cause an alien to go Berserk and fire his weapons
   in random directions. This is great for wiping out nearby aliens, 
   especially if there are fuel drums nearby!
      Remember that aliens can also make your soldiers panic/berserk!

           @{b}ACCESS MIND-CONTROLLED ENEMY INVENTORY [CHEAT / BUG]@{ub}
   When you mind control and alien, you may notice that the Equip Unit
   button doesn't function, preventing you from taking it's weapons. There 
   is a way round this though. Select one of your own soldiers, then click
   on the Equip Unit button. Now scroll through your soldiers until you
   reach the alien. It will show up as a soldier without Armour, and the
   name will be the aliens race and rank, eg "Sectoid Medic". Now you can
   remove his weapons without using up all it's TU's.

                             @{b}MARTIAN SCOUT HUT@{ub}
   Mind-controlled aliens make great scouts. If you don't want to take your
   units into a place, then just send an alien! And, as a bonus, if another
   alien spots it and has some TU's left, it will take a shot at it. This 
   means that if it hits, the Alien has just helped you finish the
   mission, as well as giving away the position of another alien.

                      @{b}CHECK FOR SIGNS OF MIND CONTROL@{ub}
   If an alien attempts to take over one of your units, you will notice.
   If the mind-control didn't work, make him drop all his weapons.
   This way, if he does get mind-controlled, no harm can be done, as 
   panicked aliens and mind-controlled units never pick up dropped weapons!

                   @{b}DIFFERENT SHOTS AND DIFFERENT WEAPONS@{ub}
   Which shot to take from which weapons depends a lot on the tactical
   situation involved. Any shot, no matter hit or not, can alert the enemy
   who may turn around and let loose some shots (if alien is still alive 
   after the shot) by opportunity fire.  Here's some general guidelines.

      @{b}Auto Shot@{ub}
      Auto shot is the least accurate of the three available, but if you
      use the laws of probability, you actually have more chance of getting
      a hit with the three shots than with a Snap Shot. For this reason,
      you should use Auto Shot when you definitely want a kill. If the
      first shot doesn't kill it, there's a chance the secnd and third
      shots will finish the job.

      @{b}Snap Shot/Aimed Shot@{ub}
      Snap Shot is my personal favourite. Low TU usage and decent accuracy.
      I only use Aimed Shot if I am in a lot of danger and need to kill an
      alien. It still may miss, but accuracy is vastly improved.


                 @{b}MISC. GROUND COMBAT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS@{ub}
   You always get 'em don't you? The annoying little bugs that cause so
   many questions to be raised. Here I will try to answer them.

      * Why do I lose ammo that I never use?
        After combat all clips loaded in weapons are lost, whether or not 
        they have been used (not a great piece of design!). Thus you should 
        unload any weapons that uses valuable ammo before the battle ends.
        See "How do I UNLOAD ammo from a weapon?" Check the length of the
        alien movement phase for hints on how many aliens are left.

      * How do I reload weapons?
        You don't need the other hand free, that's just for UNLOADING. 
        Simply select the Ammo Clip and move it over to the weapon.
        Now click the mouse button again and you should hear a ker-chunk.
        If you select the weapon, you will see the cartridge in place.

      * How do I UNLOAD ammo from a weapon?
        You need an empty hand for this. Select the weapon and move it over
        the UNLOAD icon (the one with a rifle depicted on it) and click the
        mouse button. The weapon should return to the hand it was in 
        before, and the ammo clip will be in the other hand.

      * Some of my units have less TU's than they should have. Why?
        Your soldiers strength rating decides how much they can carry.
        When the soldier's load goes over this limit, they start to lose
        manoeuvrability, just like real life. The effect of that is reduced
        TU's. You have to give your unit a lighter load.
                
      * Why carry grenades when there is the Auto Cannon with HE ammo?
        That's a good question. Auto Cannon's are heavy, a strength rating
        of 40 or more is recommended to carry one, whereas a normal soldier
        can carry a Laser Rifle and two grenades. The grenades are just as
        good as HE (High Explosive) ammo, and are lighter to boot!

      * How can I fire on aliens in their movement phase?
        You need Opportunity fire. If you still have enough time units left
        and you don't want your soldier to be a sitting duck, click on one
        of the opportunity fire buttons in the bottom left of the panel.
        Clockwise, from left to right these are:

                 Nothing, Snap Shot, Auto Shot, Aimed Shot

        Then, if your soldier sees an alien during it's movement phase, and
        the soldier's reactions are high enough, he will fire! Always leave 
        rookies with over half of their TU's left, otherwise they probably
        won't fire.

      * What's with the MIA's
        If some of your soldier's is still outside the transport when you
        click on the Abort Mission icon, then those units will be classed
        as MIA, or Missing In Action. You will lose the soldiers forever.
          Also, if some of your units are under alien control, and you
        kill all the aliens whilst the unit is still under their control,
        you will lose that unit (This is a bug). 
          Try not to lose all your units, as there will be no-one to fly
        the transport back to base, so you will lose that as well. This
        also happens if the last unit is unconscious.

      * Can I wake up unconscious soldiers?
        Of course you can, simply get a person carrying a MediKit to stand
        over the unconscious soldier's body (ie on the same square) and use
        the MediKit. Apply one shot of Stimulant, and then exit. Go to the
        Equip Unit screen and if the soldier's body is still on the ground,
        then apply another shot of Stimulant. Repeat this until his body is
        no longer on the ground, and on the next turn, he will be standing
        next to you.

      * How do I use a MediKit?
        Walk up to the soldier to be healed (unless he is unconscious, see
        above) and select Use Medikit from the medikit menu. Painkillers 
        increase soldier morale, Stimulant is used to revive unconscious
        soldiers. HEAL FATAL WOUNDS STRAIGHT AWAY, or the unit will die. 
        Click on the red body part and then apply doses until the body
        part turns green. Each dose (of anything) costs 10 TU's. See the
        UFOpaedia for more information on how to use the MediKit.

      * How do you open doors?
        Move your soldier to one square behind the door, and he will 
        automatically open it. Or you could shoot your way through walls.
                
      * How do I use the Mind Probe?
        Simple. As soon as one unit sees an alien, move to the unit holding
        the Mind Probe. Now Use the mind probe and click on the alien (make
        sure the cursor is blinking) Now you will see that aliens stats
        screen (similar to your own) showing TU's, armour, bravery, and
        also race and rank.

      * How do I make my soldiers better?
        By giving them experience. You don't learn things by sitting on 
        your arse all day letting someone else do all the work. The same
        applies in UFO. If you want a stronger soldier, pack him full of
        heavy stuff and run him back and forth through the transport.
        If you want more accuracy, shoot more things. Theoretically, you
        could just spend an entire mission shooting bushes (one unit
        anyway) and when you return, he should be improved.

fusion ball launcher before you can build the fusion ball hovertank.

                           @{b}RECOMMENDED RESEARCH@{ub}

   Top priority at the start of the game should be a Laser Rifle. Then
   research up to the Laser Cannon, as that can make pots of cash!

   Next is Alien Alloys. This allows you to research Personal Armour, which 
   increases your survival chances substantially.

   As soon as you can research the Heavy Plasma, do it. It is without a doubt
   the best rifle in the game, with unrivalled accuracy and damage.

   Capture an alien Navigator to get the Hyper Wave Decoder. This will make
   equipping your crafts a lot easier, as you will be able to see what race 
   is aboard the UFO, as well as what mission they are going on.

   After that, it is basically just what you need, but Flying Suit and New
   Fighter Craft are essential, as Interceptor's are too slow and most UFO's
   can outrun them easily.                            

                            @{b}RESEARCH STRATEGIES@{ub}
   Research is independent at each base, so don't research the same thing at 
   two different bases. It is unnecessary and is a waste of your scientists.
   Likewise, don't split your research intwo two groups, eg if you had 100
   scientists (like me) and you wanted to research the Plasma Cannon and a
   Sectoid Medic, don't split them 50/50. Don't split them at all, as 
   research is much faster when completed in large groups.

                          @{b}SCIENTISTS ON THE DOLE@{ub}
   If you have two or more research sites, transfer all of your scientists at
   one base to the other base and vice versa, just before the end of a month.
   Hopefully, when the month end comes, they will still be being transferred,
   so no salary will be paid to them. This saves pots of cash!

                         @{b}MANUFACTURING STRATEGIES@{ub}
   Remember that all items need space in the workshop, so don't build two 
   extra Workshops for 150 spaces, and them get 150 engineers, as some of 
   them will be sitting idle.
   Don't let your engineers go bone-idle. Always manufacture something, as
   most items can be sold off for a profit. Just don't use up any Elerium!

                        @{b}ENGINEERS GET PAID PEANUTS@{ub}
   This is exactly the same as SCIENTISTS ON THE DOLE, except you transfer
   your engineers instead of the scientists!

                              @{b}SALE ON TODAY!@{ub}
   Fancy building an Avenger without using up money or Elerium? Simple, just
   select the project to manufacture, but don't allocate any engineers to it,
   and don't make any items, in other words, leave both figures at 0. Now
   click OK until you get back to the main manufacture screen. If you now
   click on that project again, and allocate your engineers to it, and then
   set the number of items to 1, and click OK, the item will be made, but you
   won't pay anything, or lose Elerium (or Alien Alloys)

                            @{b}MATERIAL MANAGEMENT@{ub}

               @{b}WHAT IS ELERIUM-115 AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?@{ub}
        
   Elerium-115 is an element used in UFO Power Sources as a form of power.
   It is not available in our solar system, so it must be gained by 
   recovering UFO's with then Power Sources intact. Every Power Source 
   yields 50 units of Elerium (or 5 storage spaces). 
      It is important because Elerium is used in almost every alien
   artefact and is needed to fuel the UFO-based craft (Firestorm, Lightning
   and Avenger). As Elerium cannot be manufactured, you must never sell any
   of it. It is without exception, the single most important alien artefact
   in the entire game.
      You should consider using the Cautious Attack mode on UFO intercepts
   as this will in nearly every case ensure that the UFO crashes down with
   it's engines intact.
      If you have the first version of UFO, you can get thousands of units
   of Elerium-115 by allowing an alien raid on an XCom base, and then
   defeating them. This no longer works on versions 1.2 and above of UFO.

                    @{b}HOW CAN I PRESERVE MY ELERIUM-115?@{ub}
   If you feel like a challenge, only use the Interceptor and Skyranger, as
   all the UFO-based craft require Elerium for fuel.
        
   Only use clips and weapons picked up during a mission.
   
   Unload all weapons before the battle is over for a free refill of ammo.
        
   NEVER, under any circumstances, sell Elerium-115! You never know when
   you will need it, and as it is not abundant, you can soon find yourself
   short. Only sell items which need Elerium-115 to be manufactured, and
   even then, don't sell items that you definitely need.
        
   Plasma clips do not need to be manufactured as you capture loads on a
   completed UFO recovery anyway. 
        
        
                           @{b}HOW DO I MAKE MONEY?@{ub}

   There are three main ways of earning cash in UFO:
        
      1: The funding countries. This is where most of XCom's income comes
         from. If you keep alien activity low in the countries, they will
         increase their funding.
      2: Selling excess artefacts. Most alien artefacts can be sold for
         profit. For example, you only need 1 alien corpse for research,
         so sell any excess ones as they earn $20,000 each! If you are
         very successful you can make a packet just by selling alien 
         corpses. Also, you only need 1 alien food, alien surgery, 
         examination room and the other alien rooms. These make varying
         amounts.
      3: Selling manufactured goods. This is why engineers should never be
         kept idle. If you constantly tell your engineers to manufacture
         goods, particularly those which don't require Elerium or Alien
         Alloys, you can make a fortune selling off the manufactured goods.
                                
                @{b}HOW DO I KEEP THE FUNDING COUNTRIES HAPPY?@{ub}
        
   * Intercept all UFO's flying over the country.
   * Shoot the UFO's down (this discourages other alien missions in that
     area)
   * Attack UFO's and capture live aliens, dead bodies and artefacts with
     no XCom deaths or casualties (you get more points)
   * Attack and defeat Alien Terrorists ASAP!
   * Destroy any Alien bases that have been built on Earth.
   * Don't let the aliens destroy your bases!
   * Research alien technology, and then use it to good effect.

                  @{b}WHAT ALIEN ARTEFACTS CAN I SAFELY SELL?@{ub}
        
   Everything that cannot be used in Battlescape mode, except Alien Alloys
   Elerium-115, and the UFO components. The other artefacts only need one
   to be researched, so you can sell the rest. Alien Entertainment, and the
   other alien rooms offer nothing except research value, so you can sell
   these until you have nothing else to research.
      Selling alien corpses is definitely a money-maker. It is not
   essential knowledge to win the game, so you can research alien corpses
   right at the end. In the meantime, just sell the corpses and only
   research live aliens.

                  @{b}WHAT ALIEN ARTEFACTS SHOULD I NOT SELL?@{b}

   Under no circumstances should you sell your Elerium. Almost every alien
   artefact which is of use requires Elerium to be manufactured.
      Never sell any weapons or ammo clips, unless there are far too many
   of them. If you have 8 Heavy Plasma's in your possession, always keep
   around 24 Heavy Plasma Clips handy so that you can always reload.       
      Remember that the base and the transport have seperate storage areas,
   so if you have 8 soldiers, and twenty rifles in your BASE STORE, and you
   sell 12, you may still have 8 aboard your craft, so you can sell the
   other 8 that are left in the BASE STORE. Only keep enough rifles for the
   number of soldiers you have, because the excess items go towards the
   80-item limit, and they can make money for you.         

                    @{b}WHAT MANUFACTURED ITEMS CAN I SELL?@{ub}
        
   The Laser Cannon can make you pots of cash, and it doesn't need Elerium.
   For this reason, it is ideal. You could sell the Hovertank/Fusion
   Launcher if you wanted more cash, but it uses Elerium.
        
                 @{b}WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH EQUIPMENT SHORTAGES?@{ub}

   Isn't it annoying. You return from a successful mission and the game 
   informs you that there is not enough equipment left in the stores to
   stock the transport with. Here are some solutions on how to avoid this.
        
      @{b}The "Not enough equipment to fully re-equip squad" screen.@{ub}
      This basically means that your base has not got enough equipment to
      take the craft back to it's previous load. For example, if you have
      8 Rifles and 8 Rifle Clips, and you use 4 Rifle Clips, and the base
      stores only have 2 Rifle Clips left, then there isn't enough to 
      take the number of Rifle Clips back up to 8, just 6. The only way
      around this is to buy/manufacture more of the required item.
                
      @{b}The "Not enough ammo to fully arm HWP" window@{ub}
      You've just bought a HWP but you find out that you cannot put it onto
      the transport. Why? There isn't enough ammo for it. The following
      table shows you how much ammo each HWP needs:
      
      Tank/Cannon                           30 HWP Cannon Rounds
      Tank/Rocket Launcher                   8 HWP Rockets
      Tank/Laser Cannon                     ---- No Ammo Needed ----
      Hovertank/Plasma                      ---- No Ammo Needed ----
      Hovertank/Fusion Launcher              8 HWP Fusion Balls *
      
      * Fusion Balls must be manufactured, so keep plenty in stores.
                
      As a general rule, always keep about three times the amount needed
      to fully arm a HWP in the base stores.
           
      @{b}Not enough missiles to arm craft.@{ub}
      There are two options, either buy/manufacture more ammo, or just use
      craft weapons that don't need ammo. If you use Avalanche Missiles
      (forget Stingray, they're useless) you should always have 12 missiles
      per Launcher in stock. Forget Fusion Cannon, it may be the longest
      ranged craft weapon, but you can only carry two rounds! 
         The alternative is to use an ammo-less weapon. I recommend Plasma
      Beam. It only needs Elerium when built. Laser Cannon is best suited
      to making money for the XCom project.
                
      @{b}When do I sack or get rid of personnel/craft?@{ub}
      As a rule, you should always get a replacement craft if the old one
      is damaged above 65%. If the craft needs to be manufactured and you
      are short on cash/materials, then grin and bear it. Otherwise, get
      a new one pronto! 
         Soldiers with a strength of below 30 should be sacked, unless you
      are willing to put in the training time to get it higher. Also sack
      soldiers if they are not improving in skill over a large period of
      game time.
                
                        @{b}EQUIPPING TRANSPORT CRAFTS@{ub}

   There is an 80-item limit on every craft you have, so planning ahead is
   vital. Here is some hints on how to equip your landing crafts properly.

   @{b}Use Laser Weapons@{ub}
   Laser Pistols and Rifles don't require ammo clips, so you can bring a 
   lot more items along with you. EG, if you take 8 Laser Rifles instead of
   8 Plasma Rifles with 2 Clips each, that's 16 items off the list straight
   away, which can be filled up with PSI-Amps and MediKits, and grenades :)
        
   @{b}Don't mix and match@{ub}
   If you bring both pistols and rifles (excluding lasers) you need two
   different ammo clips, adding to the items list. Nuff said.
        
   @{b}Bring less miscellaneous equipment@{ub}
   You only need a MediKit on the medics assigned in your squad, unless you
   want more immediate medical aid. Likewise, Mind Probes and PSI-Amps
   don't need to be carried by everybody. 
   Motion Scanners should only be carried by one or two units.
                
   @{b}Don't forget the HWP's@{ub}
   A HWP counts as one item, and the ammo is already loaded, so the ammo
   doesn't count on the item list. Even though a HWP takes up four spaces
   on the craft, this means that you take less soldiers, which saves you
   even more clips!

   * How do I win the game?
     To win at UFO, you must gain enough knowledge of the aliens to go to
     their home base on Mars and then beat the crap out of them, eventually
     destroying the master brain.
          
   * What knowledge do I need then?  
     First of all, you need to research Alien Origins. You get this by
     researching any live alien. I'm not sure if you get it from corpses? 
     Surely dead things can't talk!
        Then you need to capture an Alien Leader so that you can get access
     to the Martian Solution. Finally, capture and successfully research an
     Alien Commander (these are only in bases and on Battleships) to learn
     about going to Cydonia (on Mars) and beating the crap out of them.
     Note that you need an Avenger craft to fly to Mars!
                     
   * I've never seen a UFO larger than a Large Scout. Why?
     On most missions, like Alien Terror, and Retaliation, the larger UFO
     sends a scout UFO first. If you destroy this before it can transmit 
     the relevant information to the larger UFO, it won't come looking.
          
   * My soldiers hardly ever get promoted. Why?
     To get promotions, there has to be a certain amount of each rank in 
     the XCom base. These numbers appear to be based on the number of
     soldiers that XCom has ever had, not on ones currently in employment.
          
     Sergeant:   5 soldiers for one Sergeant
     Captain:   11 soldiers for one Captain
     Colonel:   23 soldiers for one Colonel
     Commander: 30 soldiers for one Commander *
          
     * There can only ever be one Commander (unless he dies)
     
   * One of the countries has signed a pact! Can I get them back?
     Nobody is sure. People say that if you patrol that area fiercely, and
     don't let any UFO's get through, then they may come back. It may have
     something to do with the difficulty level.
     
   * How do I go to Cydonia?
     As long as you capture an Alien Commander, you can go. Read the 
     Cydonia or Bust text, and when you have done everything right, just
     choose an Avenger as your intercept craft and when the SELECT
     DESTINATION requester appears, a button will be next to CANCEL with
     CYDONIA written on it. Just click this!
     
   * If a country signs a pact, and I have a base there, what happens?
     I haven't noticed any effects. My Central Command base was in the
     North America area, and the aliens suddenly launched a four UFO
     infiltration mission against the USA. It succeeded, and the USA
     withdrew from the XCom project. The only noticeable difference was
     the decrease in funding. The base is not lost, well mine isn't anyway!

                        @{b}BEATING THE CYDONIA STAGES@{ub}

   The Cydonia Stages are hard, there is no doubt about that, but if you
   have got this far, then you must be pretty good anyway. There are two
   stages to the Cydonia mission, the surface of Mars and the base itself.
   Here are some hints and tips for kicking the alien butt once and for
   all.
        
                      @{b}NO STUN WEAPONS, JUST KICK ASS!@{ub}
   The sub-heading says it all. This is the final battle. If you lose, the
   aliens take over, if you win, they don't. Either way, you won't be able
   to bring back any live aliens, so just pack all of your Blaster
   Launchers, the Heavy Plasma, and the PSI-Amp. These are the most useful
   weapons on Cydonia.
        
                      @{b}BEWARE SECTOIDS AND CYBERDISCS@{ub}
   As you will already know if Sectoids performed a lot of Terror Missions
   while you were on Earth, they hang around with Cyberdiscs. They do here
   too. On the surface, there will be a LOT of Sectoids and Cyberdiscs, so
   be prepared. These are the only two aliens who surface (in my
   experience). The fact that some Cyberdiscs explode when killed is great
   for wiping out large bunches of aliens. Use them effectively.
        
                            @{b}WHAT DO I DO THEN?@{ub}
   Put simply, you must fight your way into the alien base under the
   surface and then destroy the master brain which will then destroy the
   other aliens. Unlike other missions, you don't have to wipe out all of
   the aliens, just the master brain. This is also true for the surface
   stage. Here is a guide to each of the two stages.
        
                            @{b}THE SURFACE OF MARS@{ub}
   The objective on the surface is to find the pyramid which contains the
   green exit area (like on alien base missions) There are a lot of
   pyramids and nearly every one of them contains Sectoid Leaders or
   Commanders, so your soldiers need to be pretty resistant to PSI-attacks.
   Mind control any aliens you come across to minimize risk and then kill
   them off while they are under. If mind control fails, just panic them 
   until they drop. Then you can safely kill them. This doesn't go for
   Cyberdiscs, as you have to mind-control each of the four squares that it
   takes up, otherwise it can still move (and shoot) during it's turn. 
      Hover above pyramids, but don't stay there for long, because the 
   Sectoids and Cyberdiscs have guns! As soon as you find the exit pyramid,
   get all your remaining units there pronto. Abandon HWP's as the door is
   only one square wide and Blaster Bombs are ineffective.
      Above all, remember that you don't have to kill every alien. When all
   all of your soldiers are in the pyramid, click on the Abort Mission icon.
   You will then be whisked off to the second stage.

                              @{b}THE ALIEN BASE@{ub}
   The objective on this stage is to find and destroy the master brain.
   However, it's not just Sectoids and Cyberdiscs down here. When I last
   got here, I saw Celatids, Silacoids, Chryssalids, Ethereals, Sectoids,
   Mutons, and even Floaters! They are all out in force, so prepare for
   a tough time. Use the mind-control tactic to sweep through the base
   until you come across an area of base which looks like this (not to
   scale) 
        
   +------------------+---+  D= Door      G= Gravlift      +-|= Walls
   |                  |   |
   |                  | G |  This is the first floor of the alien base
   |                  |   |  When you go up the gravlifts (it's best to
   +------------------+   |  use a mind-controlled alien for this) you
   |                      |  will see a room full of chairs, and a 
   D X                    |  four-space eyeball thing at the back of the
   |                      |  room. This eyeball is your objective. Get
   +------------------+   |  a soldier to stand at X (or nearby) and make
   |                  |   |  sure that the door is open. Fire a Blaster
   |                  | G |  Bomb up through one of the grav-lifts and into
   |                  |   |  the master-brain. If all four squares are 
   +------------------+---+  destroyed, the mission is completed!
        
   That's all there is to it. Obviously, it is much harder than what I have
   described, but I have to give you some challenge don't I! Just a final
   tip: Kill or mind-control any Chryssalids you see as there is no where
   to go where you can hover above it, and as they usually have 120 TU's, 
   they can kill almost all of your soldiers in one turn! Because of the
   number of TU's they possess, they make great scouts and can be used when
   going up into the command centre above. If one of your own units goes
   up, he will usually be killed by one of the five or so Ethereals that
   usually hang around up there. Obviously, because of the number of
   Ethereals that are in this base, only the strongest PSI-units should go,
   as Ethereals have excellent PSI-capabilities!

Note: TU% is the percentage of TU's used up for one shot.
      Accuracy for rifles and other two-handed weapons is decreased by 20%
      if the other hand has something in it (Grenade, PSI-Amp etc.)
      Accuracy is increased by 10% if the soldier is kneeling at the time
      of shooting. Kneeling (and getting back up) costs you 4 TU's.

If you want information on a specific alien whilst playing, use a Mind
Probe on it. Only Sectoid Leaders, Sectoid Commanders and Ethereals have
PSI skills. Be careful in a Muton base, as the commanders seem to be
Ethereals in those. Celatids are very dangerous, kill them ASAP!

                        many important weapons and power units.
Mind Probe              When used on an alien it tells you its stats and
                        rank, useful to find an alien Commander or Leader

   My name is Gareth Griffiths, and I am 16 years old. I come from
   Shrewsbury in the UK, and live with my parents. 
     I have owned an Amiga 1200 for four years, but only started playing
   UFO about a year and a half ago when a friend of mine, Paul Shemmell, 
   introduced me to the game on his Amiga. That was only the ECS version, 
   and I couldn't find the AGA version anywhere, so when Amiga Format 
   gave it away on their CD, I rushed out and bought it, even though I
   didn't have a CD drive at the time!
     After playing UFO for that time, and completing it once (and it
   dominated nearly every free minute of my life for that time) I 
   decided to try and help others who play UFO. Unfortunately, I never
   got around to doing this Strategy Guide, until now.
     My Amiga setup consists of a 68060-based A1200 with a 4.3 Gb Hard
   drive from Gasteiner, and 18MB RAM expansion. It is in an Eyetech Z4
	Tower, with an Epson Stylus 820 attached to it. 

	My e.mail address is mail@gazchap.btinternet.co.uk and if you want
	to visit my website, the URL is http://www.gazchap.co.uk
