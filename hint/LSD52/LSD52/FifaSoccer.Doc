 01  Introduction 

  Well I simply love soccer games, Lately I'm still playing sensible soccer,
  becauz I think that's the best soccer game ever until this one came....
  I saw some previews in Pc Magazines and there the game looked great. And
  so it was when I played it..
  

 02  The Installation 

  Well This install can be done by everyone, just unzip the files in a dir
  and type install. Than The programm asks you in which dir (How Nice) and
  starts installing. When it's done after 5 minutes, you can select your
  soundcard, and let the programm tests it.

  Well nothing more to say....


 03  General Impressions 

  "The players are coming on the field.. The crowd Is really excited and 
   yels for there team" Yes that's right with this game...

        The Sound : Well the music in the game is really HORRIBLE. It sounds
                    like the good old C64. But then over to the sound effects.
                    Yeah this were the best sound effects I ever heard in a
                    football game. (even better than my favorite Sensible 
                    soccer)..

        Graphics  : The graphics were very okay in this foorball game. You
                    see your team from beside and the soccer players are
                    very detailed. There are really a lot of moves they
                    can make and that's why this is a very good game..
                     
        Speed     : The speed of the game was very Okay on my machine, I think
                    on a 386 the game is to slow but I didn't tested it on
                    386...
                    
      Playability : Well this game can only be played with the cursor, and NOT
                    with joystick (too bad) I think that if there was joystick
                    included the game was much easier to play. You also can
                    NOT play with 2 players (shit shit shit) and that's also
                    too bad... SO only playable with cursor and 1 player.
                   


 04  Background Story 

   Well the only thing you have to do is win the game and become National
   or International champion ( WoW how Original )
