Publisher Plus

5-A.  A Brief History
When Johann Gutenberg invented the first moveable and resuable type in the
mid-fifteenth century, a new artform was born in the western world.
Various forms of printing were in use much before that in other parts of
the world, notably the Orient, but Gutenberg's invention is credited with
starting the age of printing in Europe and which naturally spread to the
New World.  Prior to that, most publishing was hand-lettered and because
of that, early typestyles were imitations of hand drawn typestyles.

Early books were printed in gothic type, a style most recognizable on the
cover of a Bible.  Old English is probably the best known gothic typestyle
and to some, Old English is probably the best known gothic typestyle and
to some, Old English is the gothic typestyle much the same as you make a
Xerox copy even though you might not have used a copy mahcine manufactured
by Xerox.  Nonetheless, Old English is just one of many such typestyles in
the gothic group.  They are very decorative, in fact, graceful and beautiful.
 But they are just a tad hard to read and today are best left to the particular
niche they play in our lives, the very special kind of decoration they do so
well.  It should be noted that the term gothic is also used today to describe
some modern typestyles that do not have serifs, the cross lines at the ends
of the letter's main strokes.  The two uses of the word gothic are unrelated.
 The original gothic typestyles are named in the same way a cathedral is
called gothic.

A more useful type for us today, especially with dot matrix printing, also
has its roots back in the late fifteenth centruy.  Roman typestyles, very
much in use today, are likewise patterened after hand drawn typestyles.
There are many Roman typestyles but they all have at least one thing in
common...they all have serifs.

This family is further broken down.  Oldstyle refers to the earlier Roman
types and generally these types have less contrast between the thickest and
the thinnest parts of their letters.  Modern Roman typestyles, the newer
classification, refers to types designed within the past two centuries.  Due
to the increase in printing press speeds and the advent of linecasting
machiens, type blocks wore out faster.  The serifs and the thin parts of the
letters were made finer so they could thicken as they wore down.  Modern Roma
letters have more contrast between their thick and thin parts.  A good example
of a Modern Roman typestyle is Times Roman, although there are many Romas used
today.

Sans-serif typestyles, a third classification, do not have serifs.  They are
very popular today due to their simplicity of design and easy readability.
There ususally is not much contrast between the thick and thin parts of the
letter, often no difference at all.

Two other classifications are also of interest to us.  Decorative types are
novelty styles and are used to command attention.  They can be used as
headlines and attention-getters but should not be used for text.  They are
too hard to read in smaller sizes.  Playbill is a good example of a
decorative typeface and you will recognize it as the headline typeface on an
Old West 'wanted poster'.  These typestyles are from many sources and probably
most of them were designed by oldtime signpainters.

Script typestyles imitate handwriting, there are no serifs, and the lower
case letters are often connected together.  They run the whole spectrum from
lain to very fancy and can be used for special effects for headlines and
attention-getters.  Capital letters tend to be huge in comparison to lower
case letters and get hard to read in smaller sizes.

Unlike the other typestyle groups above, you cannot set either Gothics or
Scripts in all capital letters.  Well, you can, but it looks silly!

Roman styles and their sans-serif counterparts are straight or perpendicular
to the baseline.  Italics are slanted versions in the same family.  Originally
there were no slanted versions.  An Italian, Aldus Manutius, created italics
to satisfy the need to get more words onto a piece of paper.  True italics
are designed to be italics and should not beconfused with obliques, which are
electronically slanted versions of a Roman letter.  There are subtle
differences between Roman and italic letters beside the slant, most notably
the lower case 'a'.  Obliques are formed from the Roman letter by a computer
program routine.

5-B.  A Few Definitions For the Record
The term typestyle refers to a family of type.  This includes all capital and
lower case letters, the numbers, and all the assorted punctuation marks
designed for use within the type family.  In addition, most families are
further broken down into sub-sections by the weight or boldness of the
letters.  The most common sets include light, regular, medium and bold.
Add a set of italic letters for each weight, throw in a few condensed (thin)
and a few extended (fat) versions, and a fmaily can get quite large indeed.

The size of a letter is measured in points.  There are 72 points to an inch.
The pointsize of an alphabet is measured from the baseline of one ine of type
to the baseline of the next.  Some typophiles do not agree with this
definition, but it suits our purposes here.

Ordinarily the bottoms of one line of type do not touch the tops of the next
line down.  A letter in a 36 point typeface does not measure 36 points high
because space is added to prevent this.  In addition, some typestyles require
more space between lines due to the design of the typefaces themselves.  When
type was set on blocks of metacl, sometimes thin strips of lead were placed
between lines of type to space them out further... hence we have the term
leading. PublisherPlus allows you to increase, or lead out, the amount of
space between lines and in some cases this is advisable.  There are no rules
concerning this other than to state that what you want to set should be
attractive and easy to read.  Setting type too tight or leaded out toom much
can make the reading tediuos.  This manual is set 10 point pTimes on 11 lead
becasue we felt the extra point of lead spaced it out just enough to make it
easy for you to read.  And that is really the only rule in printing... make
it attractive and easy to read.

The width of a line of type can be measured in inches, millimeters or picas,
with picas being the standard of the industry in America.  There are six
picas to an inch and 12 points to a pica.  Picas are nice to use because
there are only picas and half picas.  It is a nice linear measurement as
there are no 13/16th, etc.  PublisherPuls allows you to select whatever
measurement system you prefer to use. Some countries use still other printing
measures but since the rest of the world understands millimeters, we hope we
have satisfied everyone who will use the program.

A column of type, kinown as a gallery, usually has it depth measured in
inches today.  Depth formerly was measured in Agate Lines but nowadays agate
lines are usually used only on newspaper's classified ad pages.  For the
record though, there are 14 agat lines to a column inch.

Generally speaking, typesizes smaller than 15 point are used primarily for
text and are easiest to use with word processor files. Sizes larger than that
are used for headlines and other display type needs and can easily be set
from the keyboard.

We have tried to explain any terms used in this manual as we go.  If you have
any questions though, there is a Glossary of publishing, printing and computer
terminology in Chapter 6.   Any words used that you do not understand can
probably be found there.

5-C.  Typestyles on Publisher Plus
With the exception of two standard Amiga fonts, all typestyles on the
Publisher Plus disk are either standard Adobe PostScript fonts, Times and
Helvetica, for use on PostScript printers or are fonts created by Northeast
Software Group for their clarity and neatness on dot matrix printers.

The smaller Northeast Software Group typefaces, Lt. Bingo and Lt. Bubba, the
text faces, are simple serifed and sans-serifed alphabets that will be easy
to read for all column material.  Italic, bold, bold italic and underlined
versions can all be accessed from the Attributes menu although it will
probably be easier to enter any changes within the word processor files
before you load them onto the PublisherPlus page.  Captions for pictures and
sub-heads within the text are usually set in bold and sometimes bold italics
while the text itself is set in the plain version.  These fonts will appear
bit-mapped if used on PostScript printing devices but their quality should
be much clearer.  On the other hand, using NSG bit-mapped fonts in type sizes
that involve the scaling function might not provide the clarity you need.
You should run a few tests before 'scaling' fonts for dot matrix printing.

The larger Northeast Software Group typestyle, Zap, is a display typeface
and offers many options for headlines and attention-getters.  Zap is intended
for use as newspaper type headlines and can be used either all capitol letters
or upper and lower case.

The PostScript typestyles, pTimes, pCourier, pSymbol, and pHelvetica, can be
scaled to almost anyu size and will reproduce in typeset quality (635-2540
dots per inch) on photoype-setters such as manufactured by Linotype and laser
printer quality (300 dpi).  They can also be used on dot matrix printers
although some scaled sizes might not look just right.  Expirement!  The
following pages show the complete character sets for all the fonts supplied
on PublisherPlus. While memory limitation restricts the number of fonts
available on your PublisherPlus disk, we think there is an adequate selection
for most publishing needs.

Additional typestyles are available on Zuma Font disks and other sources
within the Amiga sphere of software developers and users.  Northeast Software
Group is also preparing a disk with many new bitmap fonts, PostScript fonts
and useful printer's ornamentation designed primarily for use on Publisher
Plus.  There are also font editors available which you can use to create your
own fonts.  Check with your Amiga dealer for more information on all these
options.

5-D.  Loading Fonts from other Sources
Procedures for downloading fonts from other sources can vary with the sources
themselves.  Some of the companies that developed font disks for the Amiga
include easy to follow routines that move fonts from one disk onto another.
PublisherPlus will always look for fonts that reside on the PublisherPlus
disk.  Therefore, the safest way to use fonts other than the ones included on
the PublisherPlus disk is to copy each of the fonts you want to use into the
PublisherPlus FONTS directory.  To do this, you can use the routines supplied
on your fonts disks.  If no routine is available on your fonts disk, you can
use the Amiga CLI DOS copy command to move fonts from one disk to the
PublisherPlus disk.  CLI DOS copy command explanations are beyond the scope
of this manual.  We therefore, refer you to the AmigaDOS manual for an
explanation of the copy command.

ONE IMPORTANT NOTE HERE:  If you prepare several different PublisherPlus
program disks, each containing a different list of fonts, you should always
use the same PublisherPlus program disk to reload a page as used when it was
originally created.  This will insure that the fonts you used to originally
create the page will be found on the program disk.  If PublisherPlus cannot
find a font, it will default to Topaz 8 point.

5-E. The Borders Font
Included in the type library on the PublisherPlus program disk is a
special-use font with no letters.  It is called 'Borders' and has a wide
variety of rules, borders and dingbats that can be used to ornament your
pages.  These images can be accessed from the keyboard the same way you
access regular letters. Refer to the typestyles samples for this font under
Typestyle Samples in this chapter.  Simply find the character you want to
use and strike the corresponding key on the keyboard.  Many of them are
spaced to touch the next one to create a solid ornamental line.

Just how you use this font pretty much depends on your own creativity.
They can be typed in as a decorative rule as in the sample exercise in
Chapter 2.  By experimenting with the leading feature (Attributes menu), you
can even create vertical rules that touch. Decorative boxes can be made.
One set of borders on the font also has corners.  Careful manipulation of
these can make a perfect box.  There are also two sets of numbers that can
be used for decorative call-outs within graphics.

This is a creative device and how you use them can have a definite effect on
your page's appearance.  Remember, don't ornament the page to a point where
your inteded message gets lost.  Be careful to use just enough but not too
much.

6-B.  ProofReader's Marks
The proofreader's marks on the next two pages are standard in the printing
industry.  They are included here because you might see them on copy you get
from other sources.  They are usually hand drawn on typewritten copy and
indicate what is to be done and where.  A mark (^) is drawn within the copy
at the point where the correction is to be made.  Then a line is drawn out to
the side where the appropriate notation is made.  You do not have to use them
but the pro's do... and let's face it, with PublisherPlus, you are a pro.

5-C.  Hints and Tips

1.  With a series of elements stacked one upon the other, it may be desireable
to move one of the elements to determine which element is on top.  The Status
menu option is the best to use for this.  On the other hand, if the series of
elements are different; for example, a line, a solid and a picture, you can
find which one is in front by clicking on the element cluster, holding the
mouse button down and reading the message in the prompt line at the top of
the screen.  If it is not the element you wish to work on, select Send To
Back from the Edit menu.  Keep doing this until you reach the element you want.

2.  If you have a meg or so of memory, you might try running PublisherPlus
in RAM.  This will allow the program to run faster by eliminating much of
the disk access.  Be certain to first set your stack to 10,000 if runging
from the CLI.
