                    8. Customising The User Interface

                            8.1. Introduction

Before you start this chapter, you should have worked with Amiga and
clariSSA extensively. Terms like Gadget, PullDown menus etc. should be
familiar to you. You should also know the clariSSA commands since you
have to allocate them to the interface functions.

In this section you will learn about one of the biggest features of
clariSSA - customising the user interface for your own needs, settings
and routines. After studying this chapter you should be able to control
the creation of menus, buttons, startup settings, keyboard layout and
default windows.

Instructions for these commands are shown in bold printed capitals in the
following lists. A complete syntax follows this, then the feedback which
might be necessary and the instruction mask. An explanation for each
individual command is given in a short description and detailed function
descriptions are then supplied.

At the end of this section is a printout of a user interface definition.
Use this example to learn the individual instructions and labels .

                            8.3. Syntax Guide

Page 8-2

The following syntax descriptions for the command format and masks are
basically similar to AmigaDOS commands (=> See AmigaDOS reference). A
100% emulation is not possible for functional reasons.

                              8.3.1. Format

 <>       = Variable input string.
            Example: <FileName>
            =>The file name required. The angle
            brackets < > must not be entered in the actual command.

 "<>"     = Variable input string which must be in quotes.
            Example MENU"' <TitleName>"
            => A text must be entered in quotes here.
            The <> must not be used in the actual command.

 [ ]      = Optional input
            Example : SetPlayMode [REQ]
            => The option REQ can but does not have to be given.
            The [ ] are not necessary in the actual command.

 { }      = Parameter, which can be related as often as required.
            Example: BOOLREQUEST {"<Text>"'"'<Text>"'}.
            Up to ten text entries can be used.


 <#>      = Numerical value.


 <+#>     = Positive numerical values only.

 |        = A vertical line means Either/Or.
            Example: ON | OFF | TOGGLE
            As these are optional parameters, they can be omitted. If
            these parameters are to be used only one line may be entered.

                        8.3.2. Masks & Parameters

Page 8-3

 <Option>/K    = Keyboard - i.e. an action is started
                 (e.g. a File Requester is opened).

 <Option>/S    = Gadget e.g. ON | OFF | TOGGLE

 <Value>/N     = Numerical value

 <Parameter>/M = Multiple i.e. several specific arguments can follow
                 (corresponds to { } brackets).

 <Text>/T      = Arbitrary text which must be given in quotes.

 <Command>/C   = Internal clariSSA command.

 , (Comma)     = No parameters necessary .

All quote styles are allowed - e.g. " " and ' '.

The following names appear regularly throughout the use of clariSSA and
represent the various animation buffers available

ANIM = Actual | MASTER | SOURCE_ A | SOURCE_ B | SOURCE_ C | SOURCE_ D
      <----------------Animation buffers ---------------------------->

Keywords and their meaning:

 REQ   => Requester show / request
 VIEW  => Display
 AREA  => Range

                         8.4.2. Gadget Commands

With the gadget commands you can place gadgets (switches or buttons) onto
your clariSSA screen with ease. The gadgets which you define can then be
displayed in the lower part of the user interface (MFG window). You can
then allocate functions, instructions or macros by simply pressing a key
which will make your work easier, or even takes it over altogether. (=>
See also ARexx).

GADGETS
Format:          Start of a gadget definition.
Mask:            ,

Page 8-6

Description:     Start of a gadget definition.
Function:        This instruction begins a definition for the creation of
                 a gadget. clariSSA recognizes this as the appropriate
                 start code.

GADGETTITLE
Format:         [PAGE<+#>|AUTO|CLEAR][TITLE<GadTitle>][VIEW<+#>]
Mask:           PAGE/K, #/N, AUTO/S, CLEAR/S, TITLE/K, GADTitle/T,
                VIEW/S, #/N
Output:         "PAGE 1 TITLE" 'Page'
Description:    This instruction activates or deactivates a new MFG
                strip.
Function:       If an MFG strip and its corresponding page is
                deactivated, then the matching MFG gadgets become
                temporarily unavailable. If the page is activated again,
                the gadgets become available once more.
                PAGE: Number of desired page.
                AUTO: Uses the next available page.
                CLEAR: Deactivates the MFG Title bar, but not the MFGs
                       which belong to it.
                TITLE: IF Title is used a title name must be defined
                       inside quotes. If a page is to be shown with a
                       title bar the VIEW parameter and the page number
                       which goes with it must be supplied.

                 made.
                 GADGETPAGE<+#><+#>CLEAR
                 => Erase Gadget# from Page# .
                 GADGETPAGE<+#>CLEAR
                 => Erase Page#.
                 GADGET CLEAR
                 => Erase all Gadgets.

Page 8-7

                 If AUTO is given instead of a page, the next available
                 space is automatically used. The identification name of
                 the gadget must follow these statements and must be
                 given in quotes. The last parameter is the desired
                 instruction which should be performed when selecting
                 this gadget. The instruction itself MUST NOT be put in
                 quotes, though the auxiliary parameters must be given in
                 quotes. E.g. » Gadget PAGE2AUTO "LoadAnim"' LoadAnim
                 REQ«.


                         8.4.3. StartUp Commands

Instructions can be given here to cause certain presets to be displayed.
Theoretically, all the commands which are listed in the "ARexx Control &
Programming" Chapter can be included here.

STARTUP
Format:          STARTUP
Mask:            STARTUP
Description:     Begins a definition of a StartUp script.
Function:        Begins the definition of StartUp phrase. clariSSA sees
                 the STARTUP as the start code for the commands which
                 follow. No further parameters are required.


FAILAT
Format:          [<+#>] [REQ]
Mask:            #/N, REQ/S
Output:          E.g. "10" old value.
Description:     Sets or locates the error threshold.
                 (=> See Errors, Cause and Remedy).
Function:        The given value controls suppression of undesirable
                 errors. This is particularly important with Error
                 Numbers less than 10. Such error messages help expose
                 functions which are not currently available under the
                 present settings. If the error threshold is set at
                 10 the 'real' error provides a direct input of the error
                 threshold into the requester. If the instruction was
                 carried out it returns the old setting. The error
                 threshold has no influence on a running macro. Only the
                 feedback to the user is filtered.

Page 8-8

AREXXSTRING
Format:          "{<instruction>;}"
Mask:            Instruction/M
Description:     Carries out an ARexx-string-macro.
Function:        This instruction executes the indicated ARexx
                 instructions. The instruction string must be given in
                 quotes. Further commands must be separated by
                 semicolons. You can find out more from the AREXX chapter
                 in your AmigaDOS reference manual.

KEYBOARD
Format:          KEYBOARD
Mask:            ,
Description:     Start of a keyboard definition.
Function:        This command serves as the start code which indicates
                 that the following commands are a keyboard definition.
                 No further parameters are required.


                        8.4.4. Keyboard Commands

The keyboard commands are given here. A closer description is not
required as the individual sections only have one command. A combination
of several keys is possible.
            Keyboard Commands           Instruction

 Example:   CTRL p                      SetPlayMode REQ

 Effect:    The keys Ctrl & p cause the execution of the instruction
            SetPlay - Mode REQ which opens the Play Mode adjustment
            requester.
 Note:       Special characters like ! " $, %, &, / , (, ), =, ? have to
            be given in apostrophes (') !

The following gives examples of the typical key uses and their
definitions.

                         ; Cursor left = Move display one frame back.


CURSOR RIGHT             ViewFrame UP
                         ; Cursor right = Move display one frame forward.

SHIFT CURSOR LEFT        ViewFrame DOWN 5
                         ; Shift Key and Cursor left
                         = Move display 5 frames back.

SHIFT CURSOR_RIGHT       ViewFrame UP 5
                         ; Shift key and Cursor right
                         = Move display 5 frames forward.

CURSOR_LEFT              ViewFrame 1
                         ; CTRL Key and Cursor left
                         = Display first frame of animation.

Further possibilities are in clariSSA.defs file.


                      8.5. Startup File Definition

CLARISSA.DEF

clariSSA.def is the file which contains the menu definitions. This was
included when you bought clariSSA. In it you find all the necessary
definitions for the creation of the user interface which you use at the
moment.

The startUp definition file is loaded:

    a, At the start of the program or;
    b, With the menu item 'Setting / load clariSSA.defs".

Page 8-10

 The file can be created with any text editor which is able to produce
ASCII format text.

The definition script should be constructed in the following way..

    1. Menu Definitions.
    2. Gadget Definitions.
    3. Keyboard combinations.
    4. StartUp settings.

All the settings and clariSSA StartUp instructions are listed in this
file. It can be adapted to your requirements by using a suitable text
editor. More information on the individual commands can be found in the
"ARexx Control & Programming" Chapter. The instructions for the amendment
and/or creation of these files were given previously in this manual. The
italic or bold print is simply used to denote comments which are not
actually part of the clariSSA.def StartUp file.


                         8.5.1. Menu Definition

The menus, their short cut key equivalents and their matching ARexx
commands are all defined in this part of the script.

                      9. The Multifunction Gadgets

You receive several pre-programmed macro functions with the program. In
this chapter you will find descriptions of the functions. The
descriptions are divided into pages just as they appear in the MFG panel:


                             9.1. Main Page


This page contains frequently-used functions. There are also gadgets
called "Effects", "Change Anim Format", " Edit" and "Colours" which can
be used for quickly changing to different MFG pages.

Load SSA
This macro has to be set before use by setting the default path for SSA
animations. To do this use the Set Paths gadget in the Dialogue-Based
Processes MFG page.

Load ANIM5
This function is similar to "Load SSA" .

Load Adorage
This function is similar to "Load SSA" .

Load Single Frames
This function is similar to "Load SSA" ,

File Info
This gadget reads information from a file so that you can quickly find
out if a file contains an SSA or ANIM5 animation, how many frames it
contains, what resolution it is, etc ..

Stop ARexx Macros
This gadget interrupts any currently running ARexx macros .

Memory Release
When using this gadget, the Dynamic Memory Operation (DMO) is performed,
You will find out more about this in the description of DMO/DDO
fundamentals.

Page 9-1

Open Windows
A variety of windows for settings or anim operations can be opened.

clariSSA Shell
After pressing this gadget a Shell similar to the system Shell is opened
on the clariSSA screen. All clariSSA instructions can be carried out
individually in this shell. It also a good place to learn about the
instructions since any results or consequences are returned at once when
the instruction is executed, and therefore operations can be observed
step by step.

Copy Anim
This gadget accesses the function of copying individual sequences
previously recorded as SSA animations which are stored in a source
buffer. If these animations are to be run l0 times this will create a
simple storage-space saving (DMO) animation. After the animation is
selected, clariSSA creates the animation and carries out a DMO operation
after each run. When this procedure has been completed, a further
animation can be attached after it has been run 1 0 times, (this
can of course be treated again with Copy Anim). Copy Anim may be
especially useful for presentations.


After activating this gadget the system Ed (text editor) is opened so
that either Macros or StartUp definitions can be edited, For ease the
clariSSA Shell should be opened so that everything in a macro can be
tested.

Close Windows
The processing windows are closed.


                              9.2. Effects

Dyn Anim Record
This macro recalculates the length of an animation, allowing the playback
time of an animation to be lengthened or shortened very simply, However,
you need to realise that in certain cases this process can lead to
jerking as extra frames cannot

Page 9-2

be generated but are simply copied from the existing frames to extend the
playback time.

Dyn Single Frames
From time to time you will find that certain animations - particularly
those with low resolutions or low colour counts - will play back too
quickly after conversion to SSA animations. If this happens you should
try the Slow Play setting in the Play Mode Preferences. If the result is
still not satisfactory you should try to stretch the animation. This is
done with the Dynamic Anim gadget, but first you should turn off the Slow
Play mode in the Preferences.

VR-Mix
With this gadget you can activate a half-frame oriented forward and
backward function. First you must select the animation buffer you want to
treat. Then the program starts processing. First the last frame, then the
first frame then the penultimate frame followed by the second frame etc.
are processed. When the animation is viewed later the animation runs from
two directions simultaneously .

NOTE:  If a colour progression (see Colours) is added to a VR-Mixed
       animation, you get the impression that the number of colours has
       doubled.

Multi-HF-Mix
This macro mixes two different SSA animations together on a frame by
frame basis - even if their lengths are different. As there are no
palette limitations, animations can be mixed together very flexibly. The
animations must both be present in the buffers. After the animations have
been defined, clariSSA begins with the swapping and corresponding half-
frame recording.

Pap-Rap
Enables the creation of various Rap (internal looping) effects in the
easiest possible manner.


                      9.3. Change Animation Format

Page 9-3


Format
Entire Animations can also have their formats changed with the format
gadget ( => See Format Change Function). After clicking On the gadget the
program asks which animation buffer should be changed into another
format. After selection the Format window is opened and the desired
format can be set and confirmed clariSSA then starts the conversion.



Make Lace
With this function a non-interlace animation can be converted into an
interlace animation. After starting the function, the non-interlace anim
can be selected from the buffers. This is then easily converted into
interlace.

AGA-DCTV
This macro corrects DCTV animation synchronization for playback on AGA
machines.

                          9.4. Import Graphics

Import ADPro
This macro lets you load a single frame into ASDG's Art Department
Professional program for further processing and then lets the frames be
imported into clariSSA. You may need to alter the macro to suit your
needs.

ScreenGrabber DEMO
A demonstration to explain the ScreenGrabber function. Just watch and let
yourself be inspired !

SGB to PubScreen
With this function the ScreenGrabber windows can be placed onto other
public screens (from AmigaDOS".X) which may be available under
multitasking. These can include program interface screens, or the
Workbench screen.

The process is simple: Simply choose a Public screen in the ScreenGrabber
window (identified by <Pub>) and click the MFG once. The ScreenGrabber
requester is then displayed and can be manipulated further. If the
ScreenGrabber menu is

already set to the desired screen it can be started and the graphic can
be grabbed. If the ScreenGrabber requester is activated whilst it is on
the chosen grab screen, clariSSA's Menu Bar will become available when
the right mouse button is pressed. If the public screen is activated
gagain, its original menu items reappear.

VLab Import 1 Frame
This macro is included for owners of Macro Systems VLab video digitiser.
It takes frames from the VLab as it is processing them to build up into
an animation.

VLab Sequence
This macro enables you to incorporate a VLab sequence into clariSSA. VLab
must be in multitasking mode for this to work.

                                9.5. Edit

Record Range
Recording of a previously defined range.

Delete Range
Delete a previously defined range.


Insert
Set a pause at the current frame position (Pause : 50 half-frame = 1
sec).

Remove 2 HFs
Remove 2 half-frames-effectively removing 1 full-frame at the current
frame position

Set Mark
Set one of the four possible markers (A, B, C, D). You can move these
markers at a later stage for further editing. (Similar to bookmarks).

Goto Mark
Move to a previously set marker ,

Set Range Start
Defines the current cursor position as beginning of range.

Page 9-5

Set Range End
Defines the current cursor position as end of range.
Goto 1st Frame
Move to the first frame of the animation.
Goto Last Frame
Move to the last frame of the animation,
Goto Range Start
Move to the previously set start of range,
Goto Range End
Move to the previously set end of range.
Goto Frame...
The number of a frame can be chosen here; it is then displayed.

                               9.6. Colour


Before you deal with these macros you should familiarise yourself with
the 'Colour Function' section (Chapter 5,9), The operations of the macros
listed here are based on either single frames or whole ranges. Ranges
have to be selected accordingly. This is sometimes the reason why
prompting the macro user can be inconvenient and can easily lead to
confusion. We advise you to experiment extensively before using these
macros seriously in order to be prepared for possible problems. There can
also be problems with the colour requester which is why these windows
should be opened first. Furthermore, you should switch on the Security
Status so as to avoid making errors which cannot be undone.

      (1) All functions which are in this page refer to a selected range
          in the animation. If no specific range is chosen you will
          generally be working on the complete animation.

Colour Cycle
This macro sets a colour palette for colour cycling as it would be used,
for instance, by DPaint. You can choose between three different cycling
types:

Page 9-6

  * Normal Colour Rotation:
    Normal colour cycling (As in DPaint)
  * Reversed Colour Rotation1:
    New rotation from other palette layout,
  * Reversed Colour Rotation2:
    Other new rotation; centred spectrum layout.
Note that these functions are actually very hard to properly describe but
experimentation should soon give you a better understanding of how they
work,

Colour Chaos
Colour jumps: Causes a number of colour changes within the selected area,
  * Use only chaos colours:
    Strong colour alienation in the chosen range.
  * Add chaos colours to natural colours :
    Medium colour alienation similar to the original colours.
  * Mix in chaos colours:
    Light colour alienation with priority given to the original colours.

MultiColour Fade
An animation can be faded in or out with this MFG. The fade always refers
to the previously selected range.

Colour Flash
This macro enables flashes to be created (e.g. in the background) like
sheet lightning and lightning flashes.
These are several possibilities to choose from:
  * Colour of lightning = Colour from the palette which should flash
    after randomisation .
  * Reference colour = Colour replaced by the flash.

Colour Sequence
Colour progressions within an animation, either for one or more colours,
can be created here. The progressions always refer to an already selected
range. Within this the first and last frame are of importance, as the
colours are interpolated

Page 9-7

between these two frames, The palettes of these two frames Can be altered
if you wish before beginning the operation and will result in further
effects.

3 Colour Sequence
Like Colour Sequence, but you can set a third colour within the normal
progression with the control,
+--------------+              +----------+              +------------+
|start of range|-progression->|3rd colour|-progression->|end of range|
+--------------+              +----------+              +------------+

Single Colour Fade
Only one colour in an animation can be faded with this MFG, so that you
can blend in additional text by fading of selected colours during an
animation.
Reference colour: Colour which is replaced by the Single Colour Fade
colour after calculation.

Stroboscope
Several Stroboscope types can be added to an animation.
Strobe Colour     Colour which is used For the strobe,
Reference Colour  Colour which is displayed between the strobe colour
                  flashes.

Colour Palette
Opens the Colour Palette requester.

Mark Palette
The palette remains in the memory for further processing and can be used
with 'Mix Palette'.

Mix Palette
Mixes the colours which are set in the Colour Palette requester with the
currently selected colours in the current frame.

First the colour palette which is to be the mixing base must be stored
with 'Mark Palette'. Then a colour is set for the desired blend in the
palette requester. Next the 'Mix Palette' gadget is activated to start
the mix function, In order to allocate the present colour values to the
frame the button 'Colour into Frame' must be pressed.

Page 9-8

This frame is now coloured as desired and serves as the base for an
effect such as Colour Sequence.


                      9.7. Dialogue-Based Processes

These macros should be used when you start working with clariSSA, as
Error Messages and advice are shown directly after each Corresponding
action.

Playback Modes
Playback modes can be set here.

Main Setting
For this point look at the description on your screen after deactivating.

Load Anim

                      APPENDIX 2 : Exercise Answers

                            Exercise Number 1

1. You need at least AmigaDOS1,3 though AmigaDOS2.X is preferred as full
   features of the program can then be used.
   ( => See also 'Guidelines For AmigaDOS1.3 Users).

2. ARexx capability is provided with AmigaDOS2.X (or greater). It is also
   possible to add ARexx to earlier AmigaDOS versions though it will have
   to be purchased separately.

3. Under AmigaDOS1.3 sorting the screens is done by using the <Help> key.

                            Exercise Number 2

1. SSA animations appear smoother because of the half-frame principle
   and more natural because of SSA's ability to use a different palette
   for each frame. ( => See also 'Important SSA Concepts').

2. You can only play animations that are interlaced. If an animation is
   non-interlaced it can be reformatted to interlace with 'Project / New
   Animation' or the Change Anim Format / Make Lace MFG.
   ( => See also 'Instructions For Working With SSA').

3. DMO means Dynamic Memory Operation. It serves to compress data within
   an animation for optimising memory use. DDO means Dynamic Disk
   Operation and is a type of virtual storage function for use in
   connection with storage devices like hard disks.
   ( => See also 'Basics of DDO / DMO / Storage Operations').

4. Optimum DMO use is achieved by using even numbers of frames - i,e, 50,
   62, 158, 1026 frames.

Page A2-1

                            Exercise Number 3

1. Right mouse button: activates menu panel.
   Left mouse button:  moves the screen.

2. These switches are marked with the cycle symbol.

3. Gadgets are switches which can access certain instructions or
   operations, for instance Menu commands.

4. Source_A, B, C and D signify the buffers which are designated for
   loading animations. Animations that are in Source_ are generally
   awaiting processing while animations in 'Master' represent the
   finished results.

5. MFG = MuitiFunction gadget. These gadgets are laid out in the MFG
   pages and can be freely set up. ( => See also 'Customising The User
   Interface').

6. The Monitor window is used to pass information from the program to the
   user or to affect the special SMove settings.

                            Exercise Number 4

1. A file requester is brought up via 'Project / Load Animation' or MFGs
   'Load SSA' or 'Load ANIM5'. It can also be called from a macro.

2. By double clicking on a name shown in the list or clicking once on a
   name and then clicking on 'Load' .

3. After the animation has been loaded into a buffer the anim control
   slider must be moved toward the right in order to move the data into
   memory. IF the slider is only moved part way, only a corresponding
   amount of the animation will be moved into the buffer.
   ( => See also 'Advanced Use Of clariSSA - Preferences Window').

Page A2-2

4. Source A is a buffer (memory area) allocated to storing data. Source
   buffers are usually used for storing data requiring further
   processing.

5. Master is also a buffer, this one where the final animation is held
   for playback and additional processing.

6, You move between buffers by using the anim cycle gadget. The following
   keyboard equivalents are also available.

 m = Master
 a = Source_A   c = Source_C
 b = Source_B   d = Source_D

7. An A indicates that data is loaded into Source_A and an M that an SSA
   animation is present in the Master buffer.

8. An ANIM5 frame contains all the data which is needed to display this
   one frame. An SSA frame contains two half-frames. ( => See also 'What
   Distinguishes ANIM5 From SSA Format?.).

9. Select an animation buffer that contains the data you wish to convert
   to SSA, then press the Record button [O] in the monitor window.


9. Select an animation buffer that contains the data you wish to convert
   to SSA, then press the Record button [O] in the monitor window.

10. An ANIM5 file is a compressed sequence of single frames. Some
    programs do not produce ANIM5 files, only single frame sequences.
    Both types of data can be loaded into clariSSA for conversion into
    SSA animations.

11. No, because single-frame sequences each have to be converted into
    half-frames so that they can be processed again later into SSA
    files. As this can only happen in the Master buffer, single-frames
    must always be loaded into the Master. After they have been moved
    into a Source buffer, they can be processed further. .


                           Exercise Number 5

1. "Current = Start" means that the start of a range is taken from the
   current Control Bar slider position when "Current = Start" is
   activated from the Edit menu. "Current = End" works similarly - this
   time to set the end of a range.

Page A2-3

2. An animation range can be set either by moving the Control Bar slider
   and using the "Current = Start" and "Current = End" commands or by
   using macros. O

3. A selected range is deleted with the x in the Monitor window. To erase
   a complete animation select 'Animation / Delete' or 'Project / Delete
   Animation'.

4. Changing the graphic format of an animation can be carried out using
   'Project / New Animation' or 'Change Anim Format' from the MFGs page.

                           Exercise Number 6

1. IFL is important for AmigaDOS1.3 users. It is normally auto-configured
   on running clariSSA.

2. DDO Lock means that an animation cannot be dynamically moved into fast
   memory, helping users with limited memory to better manage their
   resources.


3. If Security Status is active then security requesters are shown while
   working with clariSSA. Advanced users can deactivate Security Status
   if they think that they no longer need these warnings and understand
   the consequences of their actions.

4. If Quick Loader is active the entire file is read when an animation is
   loaded. If it is not activated only the frame data which is needed for
   further processing is loaded. This function is mainly for users with
   little free memory space.

                            Exercise Number 7

1. Visual Edit means that the User Interface becomes hidden when SMove is
   being used. This enables the effects to be seen directly. Direct Edit
   keeps the User Interface on screen and the effects of SMove are seen
   directly.

Page A2-4

2, If SMove is active the new settings are used. If SMove is turned off
   the previous (or default) settings are used.

3. When a public screen is selected in the SGB requester the
   ScreenGrabber requester can then be placed directly on this screen by
   using the 'SGB PubScreen' MFG.

4. a) Direct grab by pressing 'Start'.
   b) Record selected screen using a Hot key.
   c) 'Hot key + Active Screen' grabs from the currently active screen.
   d) 'Hot key + Front Screen' records the screen which is at the
      currently the front screen in the display by using a Hot key.

5. During grabbing no screen may be opened or closed under any
   circumstances as this will crash the software.

6. When using this item the current work data, such as window
   positioning, current settings, etc. are saved. When the program is
   restarted these settings are automatically loaded and brought into
   operation,


                  APPENDIX 3: clariSSA Errors and Error
                              Descriptions

clariSSA and SSA internal errors are given here and we also suggest some
remedies for them.

clariSSA - Errors:

  7 The user has interrupted the current operation. This error is
    required for using ARexx, if an action cannot be carried out clariSSA
    produces this error.

 12 (Syntax Error)
    The given command is unknown. The command sequence is not correct.
    e.g. 'Load Anim' => instruction was incorrectly entered.

 13 (Unknown Key Word)
    The key word used is not permitted in the current command e.g. Record
    VIEW => VIEW is not permitted in this command.

 20 (SSA Errors)

 Internal errors which cannot be explained further.
 Cause: Access wrong data or device belonging to clariSSA or other
        programs.

Not Enough Storage Space Available

Cause:  Not enough system memory remains for the required operation, DMO
        operations could not compensate for the memory remaining.

Remedy: Reboot system to reset fractured memory blocks. Close any
        programs which are not desperately needed. Don't store data in
        the RAM Disk, use the lowest graphic resolution possible for the
        Workbench or the animation. Add more RAM.

Page A3-1

Different Graphic Formats - Not Compatible!

Cause:  These are certain limits when changing the graphics formats of an
        animation. E,g. If you try to mix HAM graphics with EHB clariSSA
        reports this error.

Remedy: Change animations or frames into other resolutions first,


Screen Cannot Be Opened.

Cause:  Lack of Chip Memory! If you work with large graphic resolutions
        you need a lot of memory space. Chip memory plays a large role
        here as it is used for display.

Remedy: Close other programs so that they can release Chip memory. Use
        clariSSA's Close Workbench to release more memory. Use smaller
        graphic resolutions. Add more Chip RAM,


Animation Contains No Frames

Cause:  An animation with zero frames cannot be played because of
        physical and information reasons.

Remedy: Create an animation first.


Animation Cannot Be Played - Frame Format Does Not Contain LACE.

Cause:  SSA works according to the basic principles of half-frame
        techniques. An animation which contains no LACE cannot be played
        back.

Remedy: Change animation to LACE. There is help available for this.


External Error???!

Cause:  Errors from other programs.

Page A3-2

Unknown Error

Cause:  Some errors cannot be analysed and are displayed as unknown.

Higher Hardware Specification Is Necessary

Cause:  clariSSA supports some hardware levels which are not available on
        the host Amiga.

Remedy: Either don't access these modes or change hardware.


ScreenMode Not Available

Cause:  Some resolutions are not available in older Amigas, this
        especially affects HIRES-modes.

Remedy: See 'Higher Hardware Specifications' .


Playback Continuity Cannot Be Produced - Animation is too Fragmented

Cause:  The frame sequence has to run smoothly in order to playback
        without jerking. If odd areas are missing from the animation,
        it's harmony is destroyed.

Remedy: Record animation again. Recreating an animation can remove breaks
        in half-frame continuity .

Required Display Monitor Cannot Be Opened

Cause:  The Amiga graphic resolution is tied to a software monitor
        driver. If such a monitor driver cannot be found then this error
        results.

Remedy: Start the required monitor in System / Prefs or Devs.


Error When Reading From a File. File Action is Cancelled

Page A3-3

Cause:  The required data cannot be read without errors. Reading errors
        in a file can point to a floppy disk or hardware error.


Error When Writing To a File. File Action is Cancelled

Cause:  Storage device is full and rejects further saving of data, (See
'Errors When Reading').


File Cannot be Opened

Cause:  Attempting to access a file which has already been deleted or
        renamed. File is already in use by another program and cannot be
        opened twice. Unauthorised access into a file.

Remedy: Check data source or use a new format.


Unknown Data Compression - Action is Cancelled for Security Reasons

Cause:  The loaded file uses an unknown data compression format that
        current versions of clariSSA do not support.


 31     Desired function requires a file which is not available, e.g.
        Activate Play Gadget when there is no animation. The Play
        function requires a base. This error is displayed if a function
        is triggered for which there is no sensible reason.

 32     Function cannot be activated for program upgrade reasons: e.g. If
        you try to play an ANIM5 in a version of clariSSA which cannot do
        this, then this error is produced.

 40     (Illegal)

Page A3-4

        A problem occurred while the instruction was carried out which
        cannot be corrected. These errors are also reported when
        boundaries are overshot or impossible parameter combinations are
        given.

 41     (Unknown code)
        Instruction is unknown to the interpreter. => compare (12).

 50     (No AREXX port)
        ARexx port Could not be found. => Multiple clariSSAs are being
        run or RexxMast Was not started.


                          APPENDIX 4: GLOSSARY

In the glossary are short descriptions of specific clariSSA concepts. You
will find further explanation elsewhere in the manual.

Explanation

 Abb = abbreviation
 =>  = see also
 =   = means

ANIM5 (also Anim Opt 5)
Common AMIGA animation file format
Advantage:    Widely distributed
Disadvantage: Lower quality than SSA

ARexx
A programming language which, when added to the system, enables
communication to take place between several active programs to provide a
very flexible and effective means of controlling repetitive commands or
inter-program operations .

Broadcast Quality
Of sufficient standard to become part of a broadcast television program.

SMove - The Screen Centring tool in the Monitor window.
SMove can be used to position the display screen so as to provide
correctly aligned display.

Colour Effect.
Intentionally caused colour alienation.
=> Digital Effect

Control Bar (also Control Slider or Anim Control Slider)
The Control Bar Slider is used to move through the frames of an
animation. Important when you want to view individual frames or carry out
editing tasks.

Page A4-1

Conversion
clariSSA can make Conversions from other animation formats (e.g. ANIM5.
single frame sequences) to increase the quality of the animations.

DDO = Dynamic Disk Operation
Allow large animations to be stored despite low memory. The principle is
similar to the technique of virtual memory.

Definitions
Functions defined in the clariSSA.def file to set keyboard, MFG and Pull
Down Menu definitions.

DFP = Decode Frame Playmode
clariSSA internal method for optimising playback speeds.
NOTE: DFP OFF = velocity increase
      DFP ON  = Fast Play

Digital Effect
A special effect such as those used by TV editors to do tricks with
images.

DMO = Dynamic Memory Operation
Independent memory administration by clariSSA to decide how memory is
used according to the data actually needed at the moment.
The advantages are:
 a)   Increases in animation playback speeds.
 b)   Memory saving in both RAM and storage devices.

Fading
Smooth removal of a graphic image by changing colours over time.

Fast RAM
Fast RAM is memory used for fast data transfers which can thus plays
animations back faster. The more Fast RAM is available the more flexible
are the possibilities and the greater the probability of playing back an
animation at the fastest possible speed. To a large extent speed also
depends on the processor used.

File Requester
Window for selecting a file.

Page A4-2

Format
Either  a) Anim format (e.g. ANIM5, SSA, Single frame)
or      b) Screen format = Amiga graphic modes such as LoRes. HiRes,
           8-colour (3 bitplanes). HAM (6 bitplanes), EHB(64 colours),
           etc.


Genlock
External hardware which is used mainly for overlaying computer graphics
over video.

Hot key
In the ScreenGrabber a hot key is a defined keyboard combination which is
the trigger for grabbing a screen from another active program.

IFL = Internal Mode of Representation
NOTE: IFL must be activated when using AmigaDOS1.3. This is usually done
automatically by clariSSA.


Interlace
Interlace is an Amiga screen mode which effectively doubles the vertical
screen resolution. SSA animations can only be played in interlace mode.
Conversion from non-interlaced to interlaced animation with simultaneous
conversion to SSA can be made with the MFG "Load Anim" gadget in the MFG
'Dialogue-Based Processing' page. Interlace is generally needed to record
anims onto video.

Load Requester
A requester window for selecting a file.

Long Frame
Half-frame composed of the 'Odd' interlace lines.

Macro
A sequence of clariSSA or AREXX instructions which can be held in an MFG.
These sequences can be created with ASCII text editors. Macros can often
help make work easier or facilitate more complex operations.

Master
The buffer which contains the results of processing a Source_Buffer and
which is used for displaying SSA animations.

Page A4-3

MFG = MultiFunction Gadget
MFGs are found in the MFG pages. They can be freely used with internal
clariSSA commands and ARexx to control external programs as required.
Some MFGs are included, but others can be written or adapted for your own
special requirements.

Monitor
clariSSA has a monitor window where several special tools are available -
e.g. SMove and System info.

Multitasking
Multitasking is the ability to carry out several tasks simultaneously, a
speciality of the Amiga. By proiritising each individual task it is
possible to gain optimum performance from a given machine. Any tasks
which have the same priority will share processing time between them.

Page Flipping
The principle of computerised single-frame animation. This technique
creates an illusion of movement.
( => See also Single Frame Sequences).


Page Flipping
The principle of computerised single-frame animation. This technique
creates an illusion of movement.
( => See also Single Frame Sequences).

Range
In clariSSA a Range is a part of an animation on which you can carry out
an operation. A Range can be freely defined with the Range Slider.

Range Slider
Slider in the Range Bar which is beneath the Control Bar . This slider is
used (a) to provide a graphical display of the Range and (b) for the
selection of a Range.

Rap Effect
Custom-produced forward-and-backward effect within an animation. ( =>
Digital Effects).

ScreenGrabber
A clariSSA tool used to grab screens directly from other programs running
under multitasking. For use in creating an SSA animation from single
frames in a convenient way,

Page A4-4

Security Status
When active, Security Status causes security requests to be presented
before certain operations can be carried out.

Short Frame
Half-frames composed of the 'even' horizontal lines.

Single-Colour Fading
Fading of single colours in a graphic.
Slow Play
Slow Play mode in clariSSA is normally 25 frames per second (PAL) or 16
f.p.s with DFP activated.

Source
Buffer for storing animations for processing.

SSA = Super Smooth Animation
SSA provides much better playback quality and speed than ANIM5
animations. More flexible handling of the data is also possible.

Support
proDAD supports registered owners of clariSSA. Support is available if
you have questions or problems, as well as for suggestions for improving
a specific product.

                      clariSSA Version 2.0 Addendum

           1. INSTALLATION/PREPARATIONS FOR WORKING WITH v2.0

The installation is done with the Installation-Gadget. (Refer to chapter
2.2 in the first part of the ClariSSA manual.)

Further preparations :

You can now open your different tool windows and place them as you wish.
Furthermore, you can set the work and playback modes in the environment
settings. Now save these settings in one of the following ways to have
ClariSSA open to your preference:

1. Leave the program by selecting 'Quit+Save Environment' in the Project
   menu.
2. Select 'Save Environment' from the Settings menu.
   Next, select 'Update Macros' from the Macros menu. This will link all
   available macros to ClariSSA automatically .


                               2. SSAPREF

The program SSAPref can be found in the drawer in which ClariSSA was
installed. It is started by double-clicking on the icon and will open a
window like this:

 *** See Fig A2-1 ***


The button 'Define SSA Screen' allows you to select the resolution for
the user-interface. Below that, the 'Screen' cycle gadget allows you to
select either 'Custom Screen' or 'Clone Workbench'. Custom Screen will
allow you to select a screen-type by using 'Define SSA Screen'. Clone
Workbench will duplicate the resolutions and color-depth of the
Workbench. When Custom Screen is active, the screen-type will be selected
from the settings defined earlier with 'Define SSA Screen'.

Page Add-2

TIP.
The following problems might occur when a non-PAL/NTSC screen is used for
the ClariSSA interface:

 * The screen-centering function BiZet will not function correctly.
   Changes which are made in BiZet cannot be used in playback mode,
 * Problems playing back animations.

Solution: Select 2 monitor system in the environment settings.

Another parameter to be defined is the virtual RAM. This can either be
activated or de-activated. When virtual RAM will be used, you need to
define the size it is allowed to use on the hard disk. This will have to
be determined on a individual basis, as the amount of hard disk space
available on your system is unique. Once the size is determined, all that
is left to do is to indicate the partition and/or the path where the
virtual RAM will be located. The simplest way to do so is by using the
'Select' button, which allows you to define a path. Once all the
parameters are entered correctly, you can either save them by clicking on
'Save' or use them in this session only by clicking on 'Use'. 'Abort'
will close the window without saving any of the changes.


Why virtual memory?

A lot of computers only have a limited amount of real RAM, which puts a
severe limitation on the possibilities and the flexibility . The
advantage of virtual memory is that free hard disk space can now be used
as RAM.

This makes it possible to e.g. convert considerably larger -5 animations
to SSA without the risk of running low on memory. Simultaneous memory-
intensive operations such as Edit, DDO, etc, can now are possible with
the use of virtual RAM. The 'ClariSSA-Virtual-RAM' is so flexible that it
will work on almost any Amiga independent of processor and MMU (e.g.
A1200, A4000, EC030).

When ClariSSA is installed for the first time, you need to reboot the
computet after setting all of these parameters to activate the new
settings. To avoid a validate error on the hard disk, we recommend you
wait a short time before turning the computer back on.

Page Add-3

                         3. THE ANIMATION PLAYER

The program 'SSAPlay' is installed in your C: directory, and is a CLI
command. This allows SSAPlay to be used from within every other program
which can execute a CLI command (e.g. multi-media programs such as Scala,
AmigaVision, or MediaLink). Using SSA animations within these
applications is therefore no longer a problem. Whether you are creating a
batch file or you want to play an SSA animation from within a multi-media
program, the syntax stays the same:

Command: SSAPlay

Possible options :
SSAPlay { [-M -m -1# -d# -BB24 -bb24 -SP -sp -DFP -dfp]<file>}

Explanation of the options:

 -M    : Mouse control ON (Start the animation with the left mouse
         button.)
 -m    : Mouse control OFF (Default. )
 -1#   : Repeat # times (Number of loops.)
 -d#   : Pause (#/60th of a second)
 -BB24 : 24-bit background ON (Use of a 24-bit background.)
 -bb24 : 24-bit background OFF (Default.)
 -SP   : Slow play ON (Slow playback speed.)
 -sp   : Slow play OFF (Default.)
 -DFP  : DFP mode ON (Default.)
 -dfp  : DFP mode OFF

Remark: An option switch in CAPITAL letters turns the switch on, lowest
case turns it off.

Example: SSAPlay -M dh1:Anim/Test_SSA
         Plays an animation with the name Test_SSA after clicking the
         left mouse button.

                        4. THE ANIMATION PROFILE


                         4.1 THE PROFILE MONITOR

To better visualize the structure of an animation, ClariSSA has a built-
in profile monitor. Here the animation can be examined and alternatively
the editing function can be used with the frame position bar. The profile
can be activated by selecting 'Anim Profile' in the Monitor menu, or by
clicking on the cycle gadget in the dialogue fields. The profile monitor
will open as follows (to clarify this example, the window shows an
animation loaded into the Master):

 *** See Fig A2-2 ***

To get acquainted with this feature, load an animation into the Master.
Now drag the ClariSSA screen down 1/3 of the way so that the animation
becomes visible. Move the mouse pointer over the vertical bars in the
profile monitor window. Click and hold the left mouse button. A vertical
indicator bar now appears which can be dragged horizontally. With every
movement of the indicator bar, the values in the anim info field change
as does the position of the frame position bar. Also, the individual
short and long frames of the animation are being shown. They can be
recognized by the either black of white vertical bars and the status
indicator in the profile title bar (SHF=short, LHF=long). Furthermore,
this window also gives you a graphic overview of the memory usage of each
individual frame. The length of the bar indicates the amount of memory
used, longer being higher, and thus indicating that these areas may cause
your animation to slow down during playback. The

Page Add-5

monitor mainly serves to show an overview of the individual short and
long frames. It is, however, possible to edit from within the profile
monitor. Combined range editing possibilities as well as delete and
record functions can thus be performed. When using animations with a
large number of frames, the profile monitor window may prove to be too
small. It is possible to show the profile monitor window separately by
selecting 'Outside' from the Monitor menu. The profile is now available
in a separate window. The advantages of this are obvious:

 *** See Fig A2-3 ***

You can now freely scale the window to select individual frames.
Furthermore, the information of these frames is now confined to the
corresponding window ,

To mark a range, double-click on the frame position bar, which will then
shrink horizontally indicating the active range editing. With the mouse
button still held down, drag the frame position bar which will highlight
the desired range. Now the editing functions can be performed. It is also
possible to use the cursor keys to achieve the same result. The profile
monitor window will update after changing an animation. When looking at
the profile of an ANIM-5 animation, all of the images are frames, and
will be indicated only as black vertical bars. Even so, the recording
function can be set up in the profile monitor window. To unmark a range,
just click the right mouse button. The frame position bar can now be
moved again. To close a profile monitor window , click on the close
gadget (which moves it back to the dialogfield).

Page Add-6


                   4.2 CLIPBOARD FUNCTIONS IN PROFILE

The most handy feature in profile is the possibility to use clipboard
functions as you are accustomed to in word processors, directory
utilities, and programs such as DPaint.

To use the clipboard functions productively , make sure the profile
monitor is running in its own window by using the 'Outside' option from
the Monitor menu. The clipboard functions are located on the right-hand
side of the profile monitor window:

 *** See Fig A2-3 ***

 B = Mark range
 X = Cut range
 C = Copy range
 V = insert range
 R = Repair range/change compression
 = = Range expansion (loop function)

Page Add-7

Example :

An animation needs to be expanded within a certain range.

-> Load animation.
-> Activate anim profile and select Monitor/Outside from the menu bar.
   The anim profile now runs in its own window .
-> Select range.
   Indicate starting image (with mouse or cursor keys). Double-click and
   drag to indicate desired range.
-> Click on 'C' to copy the range.
-> Indicate the frame after which the copy range should be inserted.
-> Click on 'V' to insert the range at that point.

When showing the animation, the copied range is now included.

Additional example:

Removing a range.

To remove a range from an animation, select it as described above. Now
click on 'X' to cut the range and to save it as a clip. This clip can be
inserted at another point.


TIP: To remove a range which is no longer needed from an animation, that
range can be cut by using the 'X' function gadget.

Increasing the playback speed of an animation.

When an animation playback slows down at a certain point, it might be
possible to correct it with the profile function. This is done in two
steps:

1. Find the location where the slowdown occurs.

Examine the animation from beginning to end by checking the frame memory
indicator in the title bar of the profile window. It is also possible to
examine the vertical bars in the profile monitor window. Remember, the
higher the bar, the

Page Add-8

higher the memory usage for that individual frame. Now, mark the range
where the memory usage is the highest.


Page Add-9


2. Solving the slowdown.

First, a few words about the physical background.
As described earlier, the higher vertical bars indicate that at that
point the processor has to move too much data to memory. It is up to us
to either solve or work around this problem. At this point, we are going
to try applying another compression mode to the range. This is done as
follows:

 -> In the environment, select the compression mode 'B++' or 'C++' (refer
    to the table in chapter 13, compression models).
 -> Click on 'R' on the right-hand side of the profile window .
 -> Another compression mode is now applied to the marked range. Although
    the amount of data increases for the range, it can still be played
    back faster because of the new compression mode, This is the purpose
    of this exercise: It is not necessary to compress the complete
    animation in this mode. Although it might run faster, the file size
    would increase significantly. Applying this method allows for
    animations which use less memory and yet still play smoothly.

When the animation is now played back, you will see that there is no
longer a decrease in performance throughout. If only one frame would
cause the animation to halt, you might want to try removing that one
frame (refer to the previous example: Removing a range).


Obviously, it is not always possible with animations in high resolutions
and a great number of colors to achieve completely smooth playback -- but
in most cases, it is! (Additional possibilities are offered by the High-
End-SSA mode of clariSSA Professional.)

'Repair' an animation

After having performed several cutting operations, it is possible that
the frame continuity of the odd and even fields are no longer 100%
accurate. This is visible in the profile window when two vertical bars of
the same color follow each other. This indicates two or more contiguous
even or odd fields. If you were to attempt to play back this animation,
the program would give you the following error:

Error 20 <<< SSA (51) >>>
Playback continuity is not viewable
Animation is malformed

Page Add-10

Solution: Fix field order.

 -> Indicate malformed range (better yet, specify the complete animation
    as a range).
 -> In profile, click right.
 -> Click 'OK' in the warning requester.

clariSSA will now rearrange the order of the fields so that the animation
can be played back properly.


Page Add-11

                                 5. EDIT

 *** See Fig A2-4 ***



The edit monitor can be activated either by selecting it from the monitor
menu or from the cycle gadget in the dialogue field. This is an
additional editing tool aimed at selecting additional ranges and moving
them to a list.

To select a range, hold the shift key down and drag the frame position
bar with the mouse. When the start and end position are correct, click on
one of the range buttons (1-16) and release the shift key, The range has
now been defined. To redefine a range at a later time, just click on the
corresponding range number.

Page Add-12


                6. ADDITIONS TO THE WINDOW 'ENVIRONMENT'

As from version 2.0, the following features were added to this window.

                         6.1 DDO TRANSFER VOLUME

This determines how much data from an animation is transferred from
actual memory to the DDO operation. This parameter is selectable because
of the multitude of memory configurations available. Furthermore, this
function is very useful when used in combination with the virtual memory
feature of clariSSA 2.x and clariSSA Professional.

TIP: The value for the transfer volume should be approximately 5 - 7% of
the total amount of Fast memory available on your computer.


                            6.2 CONFIRM RANGE


When this option is activated, a range can no longer be expanded by means

of the  keyboard. When using the cursors, the frame position bar will
move within the indicated range.


                     6.3 SUPPORT 24-BIT BACKGROUNDS

This option allows for an animation to playback over a 24-bit background,
We've included this option at the request of many users, Thank you for
your feedback! In certain cases, it is possible that using this option
might lead to a decrease in playback speed.


                          6.4 2 MONITOR SYSTEM

This is an attempt to create a workstation environment. At this point, it
is possible with the Retina board from MacroSystem. Please give us your
feedback on this option.

Page Add-13

                              6.5 DMO SAVE

When this option is activated, a DMO process is started during saving.
This way the advantages of a DMO process can also be saved to disk.

As a drawback, there may be an increase in loading time. When an
animation is being manipulated with DDO, it should not be saved with DMO
save. The advantages of DMO would be lost while still increasing load
times.


                                6.6 SFAF

When SFAF is activated, an SSA animation is created in such a way that
the first image is a frame instead of a field, With anim clips, the first
field will also be a full frame.

This function is especially useful when doing extensive manipulation with
anim clips to avoid editing pauses.


                            6.7 LIMITED INPUT

This option is a kind of safety, limiting the amount of user input to
avoid mistakes. It will force a rigid step-by-step entry of parameters
without allowing for any intermediate actions, When this option is not
active, it is possible to run multiple ARexx scripts and perform user
actions simultaneously.

Example :

The effect macro VR-Mix is running, and at the same time the user deletes
the animation in Source_A (which serves as a source for VR-Mix). The
ARexx script will then report an error.

When this option is deactivated, it is, for instance, also possible to
perform multiple load functions at the same time. This extends the
flexibility of use.

Seasoned users can deactivate the limited input, since they are familiar
with the workings of clariSSA.

Page Add-14


                6.8 HB-COMPENSATION (field modification)

This function allows the recording of ANIM-5 or non-interlaced
animations. After generation, they can be played back not only in 60Hz
(fields) but also at 30Hz (slow play) or 20Hz (slow play + DFP) without
flickering. More information is available in chapter 7.2, Lace
Compensation.

Page Add-15


               7. FRAME COMPENSATION AND LACE COMPENSATION
                  (Physical basis of animation playback)

                         7.1 FRAME COMPENSATION

This function is relevant when converting field animations to field
animations. When recording a field animation, the program will always try
to maintain the frame-switching continuity. When using dynamic mixing
features such as HB-Mix or VR-Mix, but also extended editing, this
continuity cannot always be maintained. This might lead to irregular
motions within the animation. This can become very noticeable in the
profile monitor window.


Using frame compensation might lead to frame shifts. This means that the
data for the odd and even fields were switched during generation . This
is an undesirable effect, especially when using images with a lot of
contrast.

To obtain a smooth continuous running of the animation, this mode must be
activated. However, if the appearance or contents of the image are more
important, it is best to deactivate this mode. Especially when using
macros with dynamic mix functions, frame compensation should always be
active.

Page Add-16


                          7.2 LACE COMPENSATION

Converting graphics from non-interlace to interlace will halve the height
of the image. When lace compensation is active, the image will be
expanded so that the actual image contents will remain proportionately
identical to the original image.

The following settings should be well understood to obtain the full
performance of the SSA format in both creation and playback quality.
Furthermore, it will save unnecessary rendering time when generating an
animation.


 - Lace compensation active + HB-Compensation active

The image format is extended vertically; this might lead to screen
flickering at lower playback speeds.

Useful application: If, for instance, an animation is calculated
externally, it would be possible to do so in only half the resolution and
then use this compensation setting to expand it to full height. This
could save up to 50% in time during the creation of the animation.


 - Lace compensation inactive + HB-compensation active

The image format remains unchanged, but screen flickering occurring at
lower playback rates would be eliminated.


 - Lace compensation active + HB-Compensation inactive.

When the original animation (ANIM-5) already contains interlace, it is
converted to SSA without any changes. If the animation does not contain
interlace, it will automatically be added when converted to SSA. The
field flickering during slow play will then automatically be corrected.

Page Add-17


              8. REMOVAL OF INTERLACE MOVEMENT INTERFERENCE

When graphics are moving across the screen vertically , it can lead to
interference between the movement and the physical drawing of the scan
lines. This can be avoided by creating an animation in which the pixel
speeds per frame are even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8...).

This phenomena is not so much a problem or limitation of SSA, but a
physical occurrence when using interlaced screens. Therefore, this
problem should be addressed when creating the animation.

Solution :
Use of lace compensation. This requires that an animation (e.g. vertical
text scrolling) is created in non-interlaced format. When this animation
is then loaded into clariSSA and converted to SSA with the lace
compensation active or with the macro 'Make Lace' , this interference
phenomena will not occur.

Advantages:

 -> Slow play flicker-free (with and without DFP).
 -> Speed of pixel movement is irrelevant.
 -> The animation is rendered twice as fast because interlace is not
    requited.

These advantages are also noticeable with an interlaced animation when it
was created with HB-Compensation and without lace compensation. It is
important that the original cannot be an SSA animation because the
advantages of SSA (field movement) cannot be discarded without destroying
the fluidity of the animation.

Page Add-18


                      9. ADDITIONAL PLAYBACK MODES

                               9.1 FFSTOP

Activating FFStop ensures that the pausing frame (usually the last frame)
will be in an interlaced mode.

Deactivating FFStop means that this frame, consisting of two fields,
would be 'frozen'. We've made this option selectable to prevent field
flickering during a pause within an animation. However, if, for instance,
the pause occurs at two fields which do not contain a movement, the
activated FFStop can maintain the interlace mode.

Example :

Within an animation, text is moved into the image.

 a) The last frame contains no movement, so activating FFStop would make
    sense, because this would result in a 'clearer' interlace image.

 b) The last frame does contain movement, so FFStop should be deactivated
    to avoid the flickering which would be caused by the difference
    between the last two fields.

Remark:

When an animation is converted to interlace from within clariSSA to play
it back in the SSA quality, the FFStop setting is of no use because there
is no visible difference between the two settings.

Page Add-19


                            9.2 BLACK SCREEN
(Deactivated screen by means of color 0 (= Genlock))

This function has been made selectable because certain video editing
actions require to start the animation only at a certain point. The black
screen feature allows the animation to be present but completely
transparent.

Example :

An animated text needs to be placed over running video at a certain
point. The animation is loaded but completely transparent to the genlock
because of the black screen. At the required point, the animation can be
started to be taped. The complete animation will be recorded without
having the first frame visible prior to the desired start time.

This feature only works together with 'Mouse Start' and 'Background' .
The endless function obviously cannot be used.


                             9.3 BACKGROUND

Because the future development of both the program and operating systems
do not allow for illegal tricks, we had to compromise in the form of a
selectable feature. With many animations it might occur that the upper
edge of the screen is different in color from the rest. In such cases,
the background feature should be activated.

When an active background is required by clariSSA and it is not yet
activated, the following error message will appear when starting an
animation:

Error-Nr: 20 SSA(57) -> This option should be activated.

Page Add-20


                            9.4 HARMONY LOOP

This option should be used when an absolutely clean and smooth transition
in endless mode is required.

When harmony loop is activated, clariSSA will attempt to make the
transition between start and end as seamless as possible, When the
animation is started with 'Mouse Start' , the corrected start frame is
displayed rather than the real starting frame. This might lead to field
flickering.


                            9.5 VIEW FREEZER

This option activates/deactivates the screen adjustment available in
system 2.x (left-Amiga key and left mouse button to move the screen).
This option becomes more important in clariSSA Professional.


                                 9.6 IFL

This option is also selectable as from OS 2.x.

Page Add-21


                          10. SCREEN ATTRIBUTES

The screen attribute requester is available from the Edit menu.

 *** See Fig A2-4 ***

This allows for fast changes in screen settings. It is possible to select
from either LoRes, HiRes, and SuperHiRes. Vertically you can switch
between interlace and non-interlace. Please keep in mind that playing
back an SSA animation always requires interlace (otherwise Error Nr. 20
(SSA 38) = animation cannot be played back).


                 11. NEW FUNCTIONS AND COMMANDS FOR V2.0


                  11.1 MENU ITEM PROJECT/NEW ANIMATION

Version 2.0 now has the possibility to select a specific format for the
creation of animations. Here possible future formats will be added.


                   11.2 MENU SSA / RELEASE ALL MEMORY

This function copies all the animation data which are currently in RAM to
virtual memory. This will free up your RAM, allowing other programs to be
opened. When the data is required, it is automatically copied back to
RAM.

                        12. COMPLEMENTARY MACROS

                              12.1 AA-DCTV

In many cases, it is problematic to create a DCTV anim together with the
AA chipset. The animation needs to be treated with this macro in order to
work correctly.


                        12.2 IMPORT VLAB SEQUENCE

A sequence digitized by VLAB is imported in clariSSA and converted to an
SSA animation after the necessary calculations.


                            12.3 MAKE PLAYER

This macro offers a completely new function.


An SSA animation in Master can now be converted to an executable batch
file, This makes it possible to run the file by double-clicking on the
icon or by using the execute command from the CLI. Furthermore, the file
is also executable from within other programs (e.g. multi-media
programs).

To save a file as a batch file, only a few steps are required:

 1) An SSA animation has to be in Master.
 2) When the macro is called, a filename has to be entered. Furthermore,
    you can indicate whether an icon should be created as well. When
    creating a file without an icon, the file cannot be executed by
    double-clicking.
 3) Next, the number of loops can be entered, indicating how many times
    the animation will play. Additionally, it is possible to define how
    much time should pass between loading and starting the animation. 60
    fields represent one second.

Please note the following when creating the batch animation:

Within the batch file the path is indicated for the animation which is
currently in Master. Make sure the animation is saved before you create
the batch file. The batch file does not contain the actual animation, but
only a pointer to where it is located, plus the additional parameters
such as the number of loops and the delay. Additionally, current
parameters for the playback mode are saved.

       A s-   A S=   A s+  B s+   B s++   C s++

                 COMPRESSION MODEL

'A s-' should always be used independent of the graphic format. Because
the time to load is considerably longer than the time to reconstruct, you
should always use a compression module that decreases the flow of data.


Remarks:

1. B and C only achieve full performance with MC68040.
2. C s++ could achieve an increase in performance for LoRes formats.
Full-screen changes will result in a decrease in speed when using HiRes.
