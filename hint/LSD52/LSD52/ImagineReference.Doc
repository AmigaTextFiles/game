INTRODUCTION

The information containde in this document details every menu and requester
item in each of Imagine's program modules.Every effort has been made to
describe each command as clearly and succinctly as possible so that the
user may refer to this manual whenever in need of a refresher.
It is worth nothing,however,that few commands in Imagine work
independently.Achieving any desired effect may take various steps that
involve items in several different menus.Likewise,all projects will require
familiarity with at least three of Imagines modules.
For this reason,Imagine's User Manual was designed as a tutorial guide.If
you are unclear on any particular function,refer to the tutorial in the
User's Manual which covers that particular command.In any case,With a
program as complete as Imagine,it is impossible to cover every aspect of
the software in the limited space available.Once the user has achieved some
familiar with a specific tool,experimentation is the best method of gaining
complete understanding.

THE BASICS

Navigating around our 3D universe is no big deal to most of us.Moving about
and interacting with other objects is a basic skill that humans master very
early in their lives.Unfortunately,translating this instinctive knowledge
to a flat,two-dimensional plane like a computer's screen is not quite as
easy.Each object in this artificial 3D space must be mathematically defined
and then positioned.Even the simplest scene might involve thousands of
calculations.Fortunately,Imagine and the Amiga take care of most of the
math.As a user,you simply have to understand some of the ground rules.
If you have worked with other 3D programs on the Amiga or other
platforms,you may wish to skip ahead to next section.For those of you not

                                    -2-

accustomed to thinking in terms of xyz coordinates,what follows is a brief
introduction into the often confusing realm of three dimensional modeling
and animation.

WHY CAN'T I JUST DRAW MY OBJECT?

Why not,indeed.Since its inception,the Amiga community has benefited from
the availability of some of the microcomputer worlds finest paint and
animation products.Virtually anyone with a modicum of artistic talent can
create digital art with the Amiga and a paint program.Many artists who
successfully master the techniques of two dimensional computer art
logically want to explore the possibilities of translating their work into
third dimension.
But few traditional artists are prepared for the steep learning curve
demanded by this new medium.And to make  matters worse,no Amiga 3D program
has given the artist the responsiveness or immediate feedback enjoyed in
a paint program.Creating a three dimensional object is not as intuitiv as
dragging a cursor around the screen.Assigning a color is not as simple as
using the Fill tool.Therefore,with powerful animation features becoming
standard in a paint programs,why bother with 3D at all?
Used properly,so-called 2-1/2D animations can convey a convincong illusion
of a third dimension;however,if one wishes to look at an entirely different
view of an object,the artist will most likely have to redraw it.Animation
programs like DPaint III manipulate pixels of color with no understanding
of what the pixels themselves represent.Expanding an object soon enlarges
its pixels to the point where the object is unrecognizable,while rotating a
bitmap image can distort it beyond repair.
In a three dimensional program,each object is defined by precise points
which may be moved,rotated or scaled without affecting the integrity of the
object itself.Therefore,although 3D object creation may be a tedious
task,once an object has been defined,it may be reused in countless
animations and viewed from any necessary angle without any further work on
the part of the artist.

                                    -3-

Mastering three dimensional art provides exeptional benefits for both the
traditional artist,as well as the less artistically inclined.Exploring the
application of collor,texture and lighting,stunning vistas are possible
even for those without basic drawing abilities.

THE COORDINATE SYSTEM

Imagine's canvas is defined in three dimensions.As represented in the front
view,they are: x(left to right),z(up and down) and y(in and out).Each
location within this world has a discrete "address",represented by a three
numbers.Each number equates to a position on one the the three axes.
The precise cewnter of the Imagine world is 0,0,0.There is no limit to the
extents of any axis,either positive or negative.
To elaborate,presume we are looking at the front view.A value of -100 on x
would indicate that a point is 100 units to the left  of center.A z value
of -100 would place a point 100 units below center.Presuming that the plane
of our computer screen represents 0 on Y,a-100 value on that axis would
place the point 100 in front of center.A positive 100 on Y would mean that
the point is located 100 units inside the screen.
Because a simple two dimensional plane is inadequate for representing those
points which would be swirling around in front of and behind your
head,Imagine presents the user with three orthogonal views.The front view
represents the x,z scene we just described.The right view presents the y,z
perspective.In this view,points on the y axis travel left to right.The top
view represents the x,y perspective.In the top view,y values are indicated
up and down.
To place a point accurately in 3D space,it must be postioned by referring
at least two of the ortogonal projections.Positiong points only in the
front view will not guarantee that the points are placed properly along the
y axis.Merely relying on the right view may mean that points you intended
to place at the center of your object end up on either side of it.

                                    -4-

BUILDING BLOCKS

There are several basic elements which are common to every 3D object in
Imagine.These are the:
Axis,which represents an object's center of rotation(every object you create
from scratch in Imagine must begin with an axis!);
Point,a distinct location in space,defined by units on the x,y and z axes;
Edge,a straight line segment connecting two points ;and
Face,a triangular area defined by any three points and two edges.
No matter how complex your three dimensional object is,it begins with these
simple building blocks.

LIGHTS,CAMERA,ACTION

Once an object has been modeled,it must be rendered.Rendering takes into
account all of the objects surface attributes as well as the scene's global
settings,lighting and camera placement.
Only when all of these variables have been defined can Imagine create a
finished image.

                                    -5-

GETTING AROUND IMAGINE:
----------------------

A great deal of time and thought went into creating a consistent
presentation for each of Imagine's editing modules.The same commands and
keyboard equivalents control display parameters in every editor for maximum
ease of use.

QUAD OR FULL SCREEN VIEWS

Imagine is the first Amiga 3D program to introduce the Quad View,which
gives you the traditional front,right and top orthogonal projections along
with a continually changing wireframe perspective.
From Quad view,full screen views are only a mouse click away at any time.To
see a full screen display,simply click the left mouse button in the
rectangular label to the immediate left of the view you wish to
enlarge.While in the full screen view, a similiar click on the label will
return you to the Quad view.Or ,you may click on any of the views listed on
the right side of the screen to jump to those views.

                                    -6-

COORDINATES

As you jump from view to view ,you may need to know exactly where your
cursor is at any point.Imagine offers a dynamic coordinate display in the
title bar which can turned on and off as you desire.To toggle this
display,select Coordinates from the Display Menu.Each views respective
depth coordinate is inactive in that particular view.For example,only the x
and z coordinates are active in the front view.To manipulate points at a
specific depth,use the Hide Points command in the Detail Editor.

SCREEN RESOLUTION

Imagine's default screen display is a highresolution,interlace(640x400).
This mode offers the greatest detail for editing objects.The default colors
for Imagine have been selected because they tend to minimize annoying
interlace flicker.Those users who don't have Flicker Fixers or 3000 series
Amigas may wish to select a non-interlace screen.
From Display menu,Interlace toggles between 400- and 200-line resolutions.
Your settings will be saved for the next time you load this project.If you
wish to make non-interlace the setting to which Imagine defaults,see
chapter on editing your configuration file.

GRID CONTROLS

The grid in the orthogonal views may be toggled on and off or set to your
precise specifications.
The deafult size for the grid is 20 units.to change this value,select Grid
Size from the Display menu.Enter the new value and click on OK.
The grid will resize itself in all views.
Selecting Grid On/Off from the the Display menu toggles the grid on and
off.
Imagine offers a helpful "snap to grid" feature in the Detail

                                    -7-

and Forms modules.Selected points will jump to the nearest grid
intersections when Snap to Grid is selected from the Functions menu.Any
points entered will automatically snap to grid if the Lock item is selected
as the Pick Method from the Mode menu.

SCREEN DISPLAY

Imagine's orthogonal views have up to 16 levels of magnification and allow
the user to jump to a specific magnification level at any time.
Selecting the Zoom In or Zoom Out commands from the Display menu will
double or halve the current zoom setting.Selecting Set Zoom from the
Display menu will allow you to enter a custom zoom value.
Occasionally,the Amiga's screen refresh will be interrupted by a complex
task,particularlywhen cutting and pasting objects onto the editor.Selecting
Redraw from the Display menu will restore all the views of your project.

PERSPECTIVE

The perspective view in Imagine adds a new level of functionality to the
software,allowing the user to instantly see the effects of change to
objects.
The default format for the Perspective window is Wireframe.Imagine
introduces a second wireframe mode offering hidden line removal called
Solid. You may toggle between the two settings in the Display menu.Solid
takes slightly longer to redraw than Wireframe,so you may wish to edit
primarily in Wireframe and go to Solid only when you wish to analyze your
perspective view.The perspective refresh is independent of your editing
functions.You do not have to wait for the perspective to redraw before
performing another function.
The third perspective mode is Shaded,which provides a full screen,16-level
gray,flat shaded view.This mode gives a coarse representation of your
object s final appearance.

                                    -8-

To enter this mode,select Shaded from the View
menu and click once on the Perspective label to the immediate left of the
Perspective view.

INTERACTIVE EDITING

The Detail and Stage Editors feature interactive editing commands that make
object modeling and animation highly intuitive.
Objects can be moved,rotated and scaled instantly with one keystroke and
the move of a mouse.
With your object selected,typing m,r,or s,turns it into a boundingbox.
Holding down the left button and dragging the mouse moves,rotates or sclaes
the objects,respectively.
Movements can be limited to one or two axes by typing x,y or z to turn the
desired axis channels off. If you wish to affect your object along only one
axis,you may turn only that one channel on directly by typing Shift-X,Y or
Z.
To affect only an object's axis,select the object and type Shift-M,R,or S.
The default condition for all transformations is World,which assumes that
any movement,rotation or scaling occurs along the world's fixed
axis.However,it is sometimes desirable to transform an object along its
Local axis,the alignment of which varies depending upon any prior
transformations it may have undergone.To toggle betwween world and local
channels,type w and l,respectively.

ALTERNATE MODES PICK METHODS

Imagines offers various modes where only groups ,objects,points,edges or
faces can be added or selected and three different ways to pick them.
The default mode is Pick Groups.A group is comprised of various individual
object which have been combined.Each

                                    -9-

individual object in the group retains its axis of rotation and all
attribute information.Groups retain hierarchical information based on the
order in which they were grouped.The first object selected when the group
was created is the group's parent.Purple lines join the parent object's
axis with the other axes in the group.In group mode,selecting a child of
the group will have no  effect.
In Pick Objects mode,individual members of a group can be picked and
edited.
With an object picked,Pick Faces permits editing of that object's
individual faces.This is useful because Imagine permits individual pbjects
faces to have their own surface color attributes.
Pick Points allows selection of any or all of the many points which make up
an object.
The default pick method is Click,which simplky allows you to click directly
onto the group ,object or point which you wish to pick.The color of picked
objects or groups is red or pink.Picked points turn yellow.All color
schemes may be changed by editing the Imagine.config file supplied with
this software.See the section on the configuration file for more details.
Imagine also offers a Drag Box for picking various objects or points.Hold
down the Shift key,and drag out a box surroundung the axes or points you
wish to select.The selected points will turn yellow,and the title bar will
read Multi along with the number of points currently picked.
Lasso offers yet another way to pick ,ultiple points,but,unlike the drag
box,the points need not be contiguous.Hold down down the shift key and
outline the points or axes you wish to select.
To interactively manipulate the points selected by the pick
methods:continue to hold the shift key;move the cursor to another position
in one of the windows and depress and hold the left mousebutton.A yellow
point will appear in the view.Release the shift key and the selected points
will be attached to your cursor.Release the mouse button after you have
made the desired move.

KEYBOARD EQUIVALENTS

Virtually every command in Imagine has been give a keyboard
equivalent.Pressing the Right Amiga key and the appropriate letter will
result in the same effect as pulling down a menu and selecting a command.
This offers a major time savings which will more than compensate for the
time you invest to learn these keyboard commands.Each keyboard shortcut is
listed alongside its menu equivalent.All keyboard commands are summarized
elsewhere in this manual.

-----------------

COMMONALITIES

The Project and Display menus are the same in all four modules of Imagine.

PROJECT MENU

Project Editor-This menu selection calls up Imagine's Rendering Screen, where
the user will define,load or close all projects and render all images and
animations.

Detail Editor-Selecting this launches the Detail Editor,the primary module
for creating or modifying objects.

Forms Editor-This module is used for creating organic primitiv shapes which
are refined in the Detail Editor or can be imported into the Cycle Editor.

Cycle Editor-this starts up the Cycle Editor,Imagine's cycle animation
generator.

Stage Editor-This menu selection takes the usewr to the animation design
and scripting module.

Quit-Exits the program.

Undo-This item undoes the last action taken.UnDo operatios on a first
in-first out basis.

DISPLAY MENU

Coordinates-Selecting this menu item turns on a dynamic coordinates display
in the title bar.Use this feature to precisly position points oer objects
in all three views.

Interlace-Toggles the editor between 640x200(non-interlace) and 640x400
resolution.The latter resolution is recommended for finer deatail,but
produces jitter which may be distracting.Interlace flicker may be
eliminated on a Amiga 3000 models an d higher with a multisync monitor and
productivity mode.Owners of earlier Amigas can purchase a Flicker
Fixer,which also requires a multisync monitor.Altering the colors of your
editing screen can also significantly diminish flicker.See the section on
Imagine's config. file for more information.

Grid On/off-This command toggles the grid on or off.The deafault setting
for Imagine is Grid On.

Grid Size-Selecting this item presents a requester which enables the user
to customize the width of the grid.The default size is 20.

Redraw-After extensive editing,it may be necessary to  refresh your screen
display.The Redraw command refreshes all screen views.

Zoom In-Selecting this item zooms in the display by a magnitude of two.

Zoom Out-This item zooms out the display by a magnitude of two.

Set Zoom-The default setting for the zoom is 1.Selecting this item allows
the user to define a specific zoom value.

Wireframe-This is the default setting for the perspective window.

Solid-Selecting this item displays the perspective view with hidden line
removal on.

Shaded-Selecting this item activates a full-screen,16 level gray,flat
shaded mode for the perspective view.To view

                                   -13-

this shaded perspective,click once on the Perspective label to the left of
the view window.

THE PROJECT EDITOR:
------------------

PROJECT MENU

New-Select this command to launch a new project.A file requester will
appear.Enter your new file destination and name.Imagine creates a directory
named FILENAME.IMP on your destination disk.Within this .IMP directory are
two sub-directorties named OBJECTS and STILLS.Imagine will use these as the
default locations for the objects and pictures you create within this
project.Imagine's output may be redirected at any time in the sub-project
window.Imagine also creates a file named Staging within the IMP.
directory,which stores all information from the Stage modules.Once a new
project has been created,the user is confronted with the Rebdering Screen.

Open-When you wish to return to a project that has already been
created,select this menu option.Select the destination disk and file you
wish to access.

Close-Select this item to choose working on a project without exiting
Imagine.

RENDERING SCREEN

Rendering Subproject-As a project is developed,it may be desirable to
render that scene or animation in various screen resolutions or display
modes.The rendering subproject allows the user to quickly change rendering
parameters and choose alternate destination paths so that various versions
of the same project may be saved.

                                   -14-

New-Selecting this item displays Rendering Subproject requester.

Rendering Method-Imagine offers six methods for a project.The following
list is arranged in order of complexity.B/W Wire creates single bitplane
picture or animation with hidden line removal,comparable to Solid wireframe
perpsective mode used throughout the program.B/W Shade creates a flat
shaded representation of the scene in either 16- or 32-levels of gray.Color
Wire creates a 16-color wireframe with hidden line removal.Color shades
creates a 16- or 32-color flat shaded image or animation.Textures,brush
maps and object attributes are not active in this mode.Scanline offers
smooth shading in any resolution.All attributes except shadows and
reflection are represented.Trace offers full raytrace rendering with
shadows and reflections.Raytracing exacts the highest penalty in rendering
speed.

Picture&Pixel Sizes-Imagine allows the user to select custom screen sizes
and aspect ratios for finished images up to 8000x8000.This is useful for
those interested in taking their work to film recorders or high resolution
display boards (Note:at present,there is no way to view images which exceed
standard Amiga resolutions on the Amiga).Enter the desired screen width and
height in terms of screen pixels.For some high resolution displays such as
Truevision's Targa and Vista boards,the X and Y aspect ratios must be
adjusted to be displayed properly.Adjust these only if you are certain of
the aspect ratio of your output board.As new output boards are released for
the Amiga,Impulse will publish a list of aspect ratio conversions.Selecting

                                   -15-

Presets restore all parameters to their default condition.

Path for Stills-The default location for images created by imagine is the
Stills sub-directory of the current project's.IMP directory.If you wish,you
may Type in a new location for your output.The output directory must
already exist.

File Format-Imagine supports five different file formats.All image files
will be identified by the filetype and a four digit extension that
represents its frame number,i.e. RGBN.0001 or ILBM.0101. RGBN and ILBM 12
bit formats will display images in  up to 4096 colors in HAM mode.RGBN
format is Impulse's proprietary image file format.Images created in RGBN
may be edited in Diamond and Light,Impulse's 24-bit paint program.ILBM
12-bit files are compatible with all IFF paint and animation programs which
support HAM mode.RGB8 and ILBM 24-but files contain all the necessary data
to display up to 16.7 million colors with the appropriate display card,like
Impulse's Firecracker 24.File sizes of 24-bit images can exceed one
megabyte,so make sure to have plenty of storage space available before
rendering!Imagine will also permit creation of Separate Red,Green and Blue
files for color separation and use with certain external devices.Each file
contains 8 bits of color information and will be indicated by the .R,.G
or.B extension.

Amiga View Modes-RGBN and ILBM 12-bit files may be viewed in any Amiga
resolution.Selecting HAM displays up to 4096 colors with a minimum
horizontal resolution of 320 pixels.Selectong HIRES will display files in
up to 16 colors with a horizontal resolution of 640 pixels.Lace doubles
vertical resolution to 400 pixels with screen interlacing.For overscan
resolutions,adjust the Width and Height for Picture and Pixel Sizes (see
above).

                                   -16-

Path for Movie-The default location for animation files is the .ANI
sub-directory in the current project's .IMP directory.To change this
location,enter the destination in this requester.The destination directory
must already exist.

Movie File Foramt-Animations may be saved in two formats: Anim OP5 and
Impulse's proprietary Imagine format.Anim files are compatible with most
Amiga programs.Imagine animations are compatible with Turbo Silver SV
animations and may be edited using Movie commands (see below).

Open-Selecting  this comman presents a file requester.The user must select
a previously created sub-project.

Delete-When a sub-project is no longer necessary,select this command to
delete it.

Modify-If the user wishes to alter rendering parameters without creating a

New sub-project,select this command to display and modify the sub-project
rendering parameters.

                                   -17-

Stills-This area of the Rendering Screen displays commands related to
rendering individual scenes which make up a project.Directly below Stills
is a dynamic slider bar which allows the user to scroll beyond the 70
frames visible in the frame counter.This slider resizes itself to
correspond to its relative position within the project.The frame counter
represents each individual still in the project and is set up in groups of
ten.An individual frame may be selected by clicking directly upon that
frame number.Multiple frames may be selected by holding down the shift key
while clicking on the desired frames.

Generate-Select the frame(s) you wish to generate and then click on this
command to render the still(s) based upon the parameters defined in the
sub-project rendering parameters screen.

Show-Select the still(s) you wish to display and Imagine will automatically
load and display them.Click once on the screen to view the next image or
return to the Rendering Screen.

Delete-Select the frame(s) you wish to remove and click on its item to
delete them.Subsequent files will automatically be moved in the frame
counter.

Range-Selecting this item will produce a requester which asks for the
beginning and ending frames of a range.All scenes betwwen these two numbers
will be selected automatically.

Info-The info command will provide an approximation of the rendering time
necessary to trace the selected frame.
Cleanup-This item renumbers frames to eliminate gaps created by the Delete
command.

                                   -18-

Generate New Cells Only-This command skips any frames which have stills
residing in the current Stills directory.De-selecting this command will
overwrite all existing stills.

Use Zone-Selecting this item presents a wireframe representation of the
selected frame.Use the left mousebutton to draw out a rectangular
area.Imagine will only render images located within the defined zone until
either the commmand is deselected or another zone is defined.

Use Firecracker24-The Firecracker 24 is Impulse's 24-bit high resolution
display card,avaiable in configurations of 512x482 and 1024x482.Imagine
will output 24-bit images directly to the board for ease of use.To animate
images created in 24-bit,Imagine currently supports the BCD 5000 frame edit
controller.

Movie-This set of commands controls playback of animation created by
Imagine.

Load-Once an animation has been created,you must first load it with this
item before being able to view it.

Play Once-This command plays back the loaded animation once and then return
to the Rendering Screen.

Play Loop-This command plays the current aniamtion in an endless loop.Press
the Escape key to exit the animation.

Drop-When you no longer wish to view an animation,select this command to
drop it from RAM.

                                   -19-

Edit-By default,Imagine will only create simple looping animations.Edit
allows users to create more complex scripts from the same frame data.After
an animation has been generated,Selecting this command opens a simple text
editor where the user edits the current project's Movie script.Movie is a
simple command language which should be familiar to Turbo Silver users.
The Movie for a 12-frame animation would read as follows:

MOVIE
PLAY 1-12 FOREVER

If you wanted the animation to play backwards,the Movie would read as
follows:

MOVIE
PLAY 12-1 FOREVER

To play the frames forwards and then backwars endlessly,you would first
create a sub-routine or scene and then follow it with the movie play
command.

SCENE ABC
PLAY 1-12
PLAY 11-2

MOVIE
PLAY ABC FOREVER

Movie also supports playing back individual frames or scenes for a
specified number of times.

MOVIE
PLAY 1-12 4 TIMES

                                   -20-

After editing the Movie script as desired,exit the text editor and select
Make.

Make-this command generates an animation from the currently selected frames
in the frame counter.If stills have already been generated for any frames
and Generate New Cells Only is selected,Imagine will compile the animation
without re-rendering those frames.If a Movie file has been edited (see
Edit),Make will generate an animation based on that script file.

THE FORMS EDITOR:
----------------

OBJECT MENU

New-Selecting this command presents the user with a requester for number of
points and slices and x-y or x-z cross section.

# of Points-This determines the number of points in the object s
circumference.

# of slices-This allows the user to specify the

                                   -21-

number of cross-sections in the new object.

X-Y Cross Section-Select this to create slices along the Z axis.

X-Z Cross Section-Select this for slices in the Y direction.

Load-Presents a requester allowing you to load a previously created Forms
object.Objects created in the Detail editor or Turbo Silver may not be
loaded into Forms.

Save-Saves the current object as a Forms object.This object can be loaded
into forms later for more modification or can be impoerted into the Detail
editor.

Snap to Grid-Selecting this item will cause all currently selected points
to snap to the nearest grid intersection.This command will have no effect
if points are not selected.to use snap to grid interactively,use the Lock
mode in the Select menu.

MODE MENU

Edit-This mode allows you to move points in any of the three views.

Add-To add points to your cross-section,select this mode,then click on a
point.Two points will be added symetrically to your cross-section.

                                   -22-

Delete-Select this mode and click on the point you wish to be deleted.

SYMMETRY MENU

Off-This is the default setting.

Front-This allows you to move points in the front view while manipulate
their corresponding siblings simultaneously.

Right-This allows you to move points in the right view while simultaneously
affecting their siblings.

Both-To move points symmetrically in both the front and right views,select
this mode.

90 Degrees-This mode allows movement of points in either the front or right
views while also affecting their corresponding points in the form.

SELECT MENU 

Click-In this mode ,each point must be selected individually by clicking
directly upon it with the left mouse button.To select more than one point
in click mode,hold down the shift key while selecting the points.

Drag Box-To faciliate the selection of multiple points,enter Drag Box
selection mode.Holding down the left mouse button ,drag a rectangular box
around the points which you whish to select.

Lasso-Sometimes,you may wish to select points which are not
contiguous.Selecting Lasso enables you to encircle only those points which
you wish to select.You must complete your lasso by closing your two ends
for a selection to take effect.

                                   -23-

Lock-Selecting this mode will enable the Snap to Grid function.All points
manipulated while lock is selected will snap to the nearest grid
intersection.

THE DETAIL EDITOR:
-----------------

OBJECT MENU

Load-Presents a requester for loading previously constructed objects from
Imagine's Detail or Forms Editors or Turbo Silver versions 3.0 and above.

Save-Saves the currently selected objects or groups in the Detail editor
format.Objects saved in Detail may not be loaded in the Forms editor.
ConvertIFF/ILBM-Imagine will convert graphics created in IFF paint programs
into 3D objects.For best results,pictures should be single bitplane,high
resolution (640x400).The user must select whether the program will only
create the outline of the object or whether the program should attempt to
automatically fill the imported object with faces.

Group-This command creates a group consisting of at least two objects.To
create a group,click on the axis of the object which will be the parent of
the group,hold down the shift key and click on the remaining objects to be
included in the group.Select this command and an orange line will be drawn
from the parent to its offspring.

UnGroup-This command will split the selected group into its component
objects.

Cut-Removes the currently selected object or group from the worksurface and
places it into the copy buffer.The object will remain in the copy buffer
until another object is copied or cut.

                                   -24-

Copy-Makes a copy of the selected object or group and places it into the
copy buffer.The object will remain in the copy buffer until another object
is copied or cut.

Paste-Copies the contents of the copy buffer onto the worksurface.Because
Paste places the new object in the exact location from which it was
copied,you must move the original in order to reveal the duplicate.

Attributes-In order to define an object's approbiate color and material
values,pick it and select its item.The Attributes Requester contains all
the information necessary to define appearance of an object.

Object Name-Each object in Imagine may have a unique name.If two axes or
other similiar primitives are created during the same session,Imagine
automaticallly numbers them,i.e. SPHERE and SPHERE.1 .It is highly
recommended that you name each object descriptively, i.e. NOSE or
RT_FOREARM instead of AXIS.27 .

Fastdraw-Selecting this switch replaces your object with a bounding
box.This is helpful when working with complex groups of objects or when
refresh speed is critical.

Phong-This switch tells Imagine's shader whether

                                   -25-

the current object is to be smooth or faceted.Default is faceted.

Color -To set the current object's surface color,select this switch and
then enter a value for Red,Green and Blue.Valuees may be typed or selected
interactively with the color sliders.Because Imagine calculates images at
up to 24 bits per pixel,the program allows the user to select from 256
values per color.A dithered representation of the color is shown at the
right of the requester.Note:in true raytrace mode ,the rendered surface
color is highly dependent on reflectance,filter and other surface
information.

Reflect-Select this switch to define your object's reflectance
values.Imagine allows the user to set independent values for Red,Green and
Blue reflectance.This feature allows an object to reflect only certain
portions of the color spectrum.Setting the RGB values too high (above 150)
may result in objects which are too reflective and therefore nearly
invisible.True reflectance is available only in Trace mode.Imagine also
enables reflectance of more than one color value with the Reflect map.See
Brush for more details.For solid model rendering,Imagine offers enviroment
mapping to simulate reflection.See Globals in the Stage Editor. Note:in
raytracing,an object's reflection has greater influence over its rendered
color than the object's surface color setting.

Filter-Objects in Imagine may be transparent for all or part of the color
spectrum.Select Filter and set the appropriate values for Red,Green and
Blue.True transparency is available only in Raytrace mode ,although
Scanline will approximate transparency with less precision.It is also
possible for objects to filter more than one color.For more information
,see Filter Map under Brush.

Specular-This setting determines the intensity and

                                   -26-

color of hot spots on an object's surface.Specular ity is the degree to
which light in a certain part of the color spectrum is reflected off the
object without being absorbed.Settings of 255 on the Red,Green and Blue
sliders would result in a very defined,white highlight as most computer
graphics users have come to expect.Selecting a specularity setting which is
closer to the object's surface color will result in a more natural
highlight.

Dithering-For objects rendered at Amiga resolutions,dithering is an
extremely useful blending technique which simulates many more colors than
are actually present.Selecting this switch activates the value slider.The
higher the setting,the greater the dithering.Generally,most objects should
be highly dithered.Metallic surfaces ,however,are more convincing with much
lower dithering values. Note:objects intended for 24-bit output should have
NO dithering.

Hardness-This value interacts with the specualr setting described above.An
object's hardness describes how light is pread out across its surface.Hard
objects with high specularity will have small,very bright highlights.
Lowering the hardness value spreads that specular highlight out over a
larger portion of the surface.

Roughness-An object's roughness also affects its appearance by spreading
out surface highlights and giving objects a rough ,textured appearance.
Roughness is useful for creating rock-like surfaces.

Shininess-A high shininess setting gives objects a glossy,plastic
appearance.

Index of Refraction-Light bends or refracts when it passes from one
material to another.Each material has a specific index of refraction.The
default setting is 1,the index of refraction for air.Below are some common
materials and their in-

                                   -27-

ices: Glass:   1.66
      Crystal  2.00
      Water:   1.33
      Salt:    1.54
      Quartz:  1.55
      Emerald: 1.57
      Diamond: 2.42

Generally,the higher the index of refraction the longer the trace time.
Note:index of refraction is only applicable when raytracing objects with
some filter value.

Texture-A texture map is an algorithmic pattern that is applied evenly
across an object's surface.Imagine includes various types of
textures,including wood,checks,disturbed,etc. .Each object can have up to
four texture maps applied to its surface.To apply a texture,click on one of
the four texture boxes in the attributes requester.This calls up a file
requester.Load the texture you wish to aplly.The Texture Info Requester
appears.The name of the currently selected texture appears in the Name box.
Selecting Apply to children will apply texture attributes to all objects in
the group.Below this are 16 enty areas for specific texture
information.Enter only the areas which apply to your currently selected
texture.To determine exactly how the texture is applied to

                                   -28-

your object,select Edit Axes or Transform Axes.With Edit Axes,you will be
returned to the editor surface,where you can interactively rotate,move or
scale the axis which represents the texture.Transform Axes presents the
Transformation Requester,allowing changes to be entered numerically.
Selecting OK saves the settings,while Drop strips the Texture from the
object.Cancel forgets all changes and returns to the Attributes Requester.

Brush-Brush mapping is a powerful technique for describing every aspect of
a surface except its basic shape.Each object may have up to four brush maps
applied simultaneously.Applying a brush map to an object is similiar to
Texture mapping (see above).All brush maps begin with an IFF or ILBM
picture.Imagine supports the following kinds of brush maps:
Color Map-Graphics created in any IFF or ILBM paint program may be imported
and decaled onto an object's surface.The color map replaces all
color,reflectance and filter information entered in the attributes
requester.Specularity and dithering setting will affect the appearance of
the mapped object.Generally,low dithering settings will maintain the
integrity of the original brush.

Reflect Map-Multi-colored objects reflect light from different portions of
the color spectrum.The reflect map allows Imagine's raytracer to reproduce
this phenomenon by overriding the single color reflectance values set in
the attributes requester.For example,a red,green and blue striped Christmas

                                   -29-

ornament would reflect red light from its red stripes,and blue from its
blue stripes,etc. When a multi-colored IFF brush is applied as a reflect
map,the colors in the brush each reflect light within their color
spectrum.With reflect maps,it is a good idea to set the object's surface
color to 0,so that the surface and reflectance values don't mix to create a
third unpredictable value. (Note:reflect maps will have no effect in
scanline mode.)

Altitude Map-Creating regular,pitted surfaces is very difficult in a
polygonal object modeler like Imagine.The altitude map enables the user to
design a countoured surface with an IFF paint program and causes the
triangles of the mapped object to conform to the map's gradations.To create
an altitude map,design an IFF picture with a gray palette.Areas of the
picture which are white will not affect the mapped object.The darker the
area,the more pronounced the effect on the object.Scaling the map axis on Y
determines the extent of the map's impression.As an example,assume your map
s Y axis is set to 20.Those areas of the map which are black will force the
surface polygons they contact to "indent" for 20 units.A middle gray tone
would result in an impression of 10 units.For the altitude map to work
properly,color transitions in the IFF picture should be smooth as
possible.Therefore,several middle tones should always seperate black and
white areas.

Filter Map-The filter map is similiar to the reflect map,because it
replaces the single colored filter value of the attributes requester with
mutiple filter values.Begin with an IFF picture,wrap it to an object as a
filter map and each different color in the picture will filter that
light.For example,create a stained glass pattern in a paint program and map
it onto a plane to create easily create the effect of a stained glass
window.(Note:filter maps are most effective in trace mode,but will work to
some extent in scanline mode.)
To aplly a brush map to an object or group,select

                                   -30-

Brush from the Attributes requester.A file requester will appear.Load the
appropriate IFF or ILBM file. From the Brush Info rquester,select the Type
of brush map and the Method of wrapping.Flat X and Flat Z apply the brush
to the respective axes without attempting to conform it to the object s
shape.Wrap X and Wrap Z attempt to mold the brush around the object s
respective axes.Any combination of X and Z settings may be selected.Picking
Apply to Child Objects will wrap other members of the group.Edit Axes and
Transform Axes present interactive and numeric methods of positioning the
brush relative to the object being wrapped. (Note:for an object to be
wrapped properly,the brush axis must be scaled to the correct aspect ratio
of the original and sized large enough to cover the entire surface of the
mapped object.)

Internal Genlock-Choosing this setting will render the object in the zero
color so that genlocked video images will be visible behind it.
Load/Save Attributes-Once a desirable set of attributes are created ,they
can be saved directly from the attributes requester.A file requester will
appear asking for an apropriate directory and name and the program will
record an axis with all current attributes.This axis can be loaded at any
time and its settings will be automatically entered into the attributes
requester.

Transformations-Selecting this command presents the user with the
transformation requester.To use the requester ,click in the action
indicated to the left and enter the appropriate nu-

                                   -31-

meric value in the x,y and z entries to the right.Select World to base the
action on the world's fixed axis or local to base the action on the object
s or group's variable axis.Selecting Transform Axis Only will not affect
the object or group,except for its axis of rotation.

Rotate-This revolves the group,object or axis by the amount indicated in
each of the x,y and z entries.A value of 360 in any of the axes would
indicate a complete revolution.

Scale-This increase the group or object's size on any axis by the indicated
amount.for example,a value of 2 on local x would double an object's width.

Translate-This moves an object,group or axis by the indicated amount on any
axis.For instance,entering -20 in the Z axis would move the object -20
units in the Z direction.

Alignment-After a series of rotations,it is often difficult to tell how
your object or group is oriented.Selecting alignment presents the curent
orientation of each of the axes.Selecting 0 for all three local axes
would return an object to its original orientation.

Size-This command only affects an object or group's axis.The default axis
size is 32 on x,y and z.Resizing an object's axis is sometimes necessary if
you wish to see its local orientation more clearly in the orthogonal views.
Position-Select this to determine the exact location of your object.When a
new axis is loaded,its default locations is 0,0,0.Once an object is
created,moved and saved,it is loaded at the position where it was saved.

World-This setting bases rotations and alignment

                                   -32-

upon the world's fixed axis.In this manner,x can always be considered left
to right ,z up and down and y in and out in the front view.

Local-This setting bases rotations and alignment on the object or group s
axis.Even though an object has been totated,it may still be stretched by
entering the desired value in the appropriate axis and selecting local.
Transform Axis Only-All changes selected in the Transformations Requester
may be applied only to the object or group's axis with this setting.

Mold-This item is selected when you wish to extrude,spin or sweep an object
or conform it to a sphere or cylinder.

Extrude-To create a solid object from a two dimensional outline,select this
item.Outlines may be extruded along the Y axis in a straight line for a
given distance or may follow a three-dimensional path.

                                   -33-

To Length-This is the default setting,most useful for making "cookie
cutout" shapes like letters,etc.

Length-This value determines the depth of the extrude in Y.

Along Path-Select this to have the outline extrude along an existing path.

Path-Enter the name of the path which you wish your outline to follow.

Align Y to Path-Select this if you wish your outline to turn naturally
along the path.This creates rounded corners.

Keep X Horizontal-Paths in Imagine can rotate along any axis .Select this
setting of you wish to maintain the X orientation of your outline.

Y Rotation-In extruding your object,you may wish to rotate it along the Y
axis.Enter the degree of rotation in this requester.

X and Z Scaling-Your extrusion may taper in either or both the X and Z
directions.A value of 1 represents no scaling.

X and Z Translate-The extruded object may be translated in either or both
the X and Z directions to give a sheared appearance.

                                   -34-

Enter the amount of units,positive or negative,which the object offsets in
each direction.

Sections-This setting represents the number of slices in the extruded
object.If you don't intend to individually color or manipulate the extruded
portion of your object,you may wish to set this value to 1.

Spin-Symmetrical objects which appear to be spun on a lathe are created
with this tool.All spins are executed along the Z axis.
Spin Angle-This setting determines the degrees of rotation about the Z
axis.An amount less than 360 degrees will result in an open object.
# of Sections-This defines the number of segments in the spun object.The
greater the number of sections,the smoother the finished appearance of the
object.

Sweep-This tool is functionally similiar to spin.The main differnce is that
points along the Z axis are anchored as an object is swept.Sweep
Angle-Determines the degree of ro-

                                   -35-

tation along the Z axis.
# of Sections-Sets the number of line segments in the swept object.

Conform to Sphere-This tool bends an object along its X and Z axes a
user-defined radius.Conform to shere is a very handy tool for creating
objects like globes with accurate map data.The principal behid conform to
sphere is similiar to taking a flat sheet of paper and stretching it around
a ball.Although it is possible to wrap the ball completely,the back side of
the sphere will not be as "tidy" as the front hemisphere.To verify this,try
conforming a 100x100 plane around a sphere by setting the sphere and object
radius to 100 and 25 respectively.This is the"perfect" conform.but notice
that the four corners of the plane intersect behind the sphere.This will
most likely be unacceptable;therefore,we suggest conform to sphere is used
with objects that don't have regular corners like a plane.
Sphere Radius-Set the radius of the sphere

                                   -36-

around which you wish to bend your object.Generally .the radius should be
about twice the width of your object's radius.
Object Radius-Set this value to one half the object's overall width.

Conform to Cylinder-This tool twists an object along its Z axis around a
user-defined radius.This is very useful for creating effects like the
Universal Studios logo.which stretches around the earth.Unlike Conform to
Sphere,Conform to Cylinder does not distiort the object along its x axis.By
rotating the axis of the object to be conformed along y,interesting effects
may be achieved because the object conforms at an angle.
Cylinder Radius-For the object to conform completely around the
cylinder,set this to one-fourth the object width.
Object Width-For the object to  conform around the cylinder for 360
degrees,set this to one-half the object width.

MODE MENU

Pick Group-A click on the parent object's axis will select all other
objects in that group.

Pick Objects-In this mode,clicking on any object will se-

                                   -37-

lect it independently of any other objects in its group.

Pick Faces-Once an object is seleted,entering this mode allows you to cycle
through the various  faces which comprise the object.

Pick Points-Individual points of the selected object may be picked in this
mode.

Add Faces-This mode allows you to create faces on the selected object.Click
on any three points and they will be joined by edges to create a triangular
face.

Add Edges-After entering points ,use this mode to connect them with line
segments.After clicking on the first two points,the program will assume
that the next point selected is attached to the first two.If you wish to
select two unrelated points,enter pick objects mode and return to add edges
mode.

Add Points-After an axis or object is added to worksurface,add points to it
by selecting it and entering this mode.For each mouse click the program
adds a point.In order to accurately place a point in three dimensional
space,it is necesarry to position it in more than one view.Position your
cursor in the apropriate position in the top,right or front views,enter add
point mode and click in the other corresponding view.

Add Lines-This mode combines Add Points and Edges modes.Each point added to
the surface is automatically connected by an edge.
Drag Points-To manipulate points interactively,pick the object you wish to
edit and select Drag Points from the Mode menu.The object will change color
and all points will be indicated by white squares.Click on the point you
wish to move and,while holding down the left mouse button,drag the
point.The selected point will turn yellow and all edges and faces attached
to it will move with the cursor.To drag more than one point at a time ,hold
down the shift key and select the various points you wish to drag.Without
releasing the shift key,move the mouse to another location and press and
hold the left mouse button.Release the shift key and the multiple points
will spring to the cursor.The points will not be released until the left
mouse button is released.

Hide Points-While in Drag Points mode,select this command to reach points
that might be otherwise be obscured.Hide Points allows you to draw abox
around the area which you wish to remove from your view.All those points
within the area you defined will vanish and remain hidden until you return
to Pick Object or Pick Group mode.

Magetism-While in Drag points mode,you may affect the magnetic attraction
of your pointer.
On/Off-This sub-menu toggles the magnetic mode on and off.when magnetism is
activated ,status bar will read"Drag Points,Magnetic."
Setup-Select this sub-menu to enter magnetism parameter.

                                   -39-

Radius of Influence-This value indicates the maximum area which the
magnetic mode will affect.
Minimum Radius-This setting only takes effect in Random Mode(see below).
Percent at Radius-This value,from 0 to 100,represents the amount of
magnetism at the furthermost point within radius of influence.
Magnetism Types-There are four magnetism types available: Cone creates a
pronounced paek at its center;Dome creates a flat plateau at its center;
Bell creates a typical bell curve;and Random Radius is used with any of the
above settings to create random shapes based upon the setting for minimum
radius.The latter is useful for making mountain-like forms out of a flat
plane.

FUNCTIONS MENU

Delete-This command will delete the currently selected object or group.

Axis- This is the most basic object in Imagine.Each object must have an
axis ,which represents its center of rotation.To create a new object,first
add an axis ,select it and then beginning adding points,edges and faces.An
axis may also serve as a light source and camera target.

Sphere-The sphere is a primitive object which may not be edited .The sphere
may sized,but it may not be scaled in less 

                                   -40-

than three directions at once.The sphere is very memory efficient and
traces rapidly.If you need a globe in your scene which won't be needed for
anything else,this primitive is a good choice.

Ground-The ground is a primitive which stretches for infinity in the x and
y axes.The ground has also no z value.Its default location on z is 0,but
may be placed anywhere on that axis.

Primitive-Imagine will allow the user to create six editable primitive
types.With primitives,as in all objects,the more points and faces ,the
better the rendering.Unfortunately,adding more points that neccessary may
slow down the rendering process and users with limited may be severely
handicapped.The primitive objects are.

Sphere-This sphere is entirely user definable and may be scaled at will.
Radius-This is half the sphere's diameter.The default value is 50.

                                   -41-

Circle Sections-This value is equal to the number of points in the sphere s
circumference.The greater the number,the smoother the sphere.
Vertical Sections-These represents the crosssections or slices in the
sphere.
Stagger points-This setting offset the points in each vertical section and
dramatically improves rendering.

Tube-This primitive is a simple cylinder object.Radius-Set this to half the
tube's diameter.
Height-This is the tube's extent on the Z axis.
Circle Sections-Adjusting this number determines the number of segments
that mak up the tube's shape.The greater the number of sections,the
smoother the tube.
Vertical Sections-If you desire to break your tube into sections or color
in different strips,you may wish to alter the default number of vertical
sections.

                                   -42-

Stagger Points-This setting alternates the points in each vertical
section,enhancing rendering.
Close Bottom/Top-The default setting for the tube is hollow.If you wish to
close it ,select either or both of these settings.

Cone -A cone is a primitive comprised of a group of points which converge
at one location.
Radius-This is half diameter of the base of the cone.
Height-This is the extent of the cone on the z axis.
Circle Sections-The number of points in the cone's base.
Vertical Sections-The cone may be bisected any number of times to faciliate
coloring or editing.
Stagger Points-This setting alternates the points in each vertical
section,enhancing rendering.

                                   -43-

Close Bottom-By default ,the base of the cone os open,choosing Close Bottom
automatically triangulates the base.

Torus-The torus is a donut-shaped primitive.
Ring Radius-this value represents half the diameter of the torus center
ring.

Tube Radius-This value represents half the diameter of the rings which
revolve around the torus center.
Tube Sections-this is the number of points on the torus ssurface.
Stagger Points-this offsets the points on each subsequent tube section to
enhance rendering.

Disk-A disk is a simple ring primitive with faces already defined.
Radius-Half the disk's diameter.
Sections-The number of points in the disk s

                                   -44-

circumference.

Plane-A flat rectangular primitive useful as a surface of any kind.
Width-The plane's size along x.
Height-The plane's size on z.
Horizontal Sections-Thge number of points along x.
Vertical Sections-the number of points along z.

INTERACTIVE TRANSFORMATIONS

The Detail editor has various interactive transformation commands
available at any time with a single keystroke.These commands only affect
selected objects or groups.After typing

                                   -45-

the apprpriate keystroke,the object will become an orange bounding box
until the spacebar is depressed to accept the change or escape key is
depressed to abort it.

Rotate (r for object/group,R for axis)-Use the mouse to rotate the object
on any combination of axes.

Move (m for object/group,M for axis)-Use the mouse to move the object in up
three axes in the appropriate view.

Scale (s for object/group,S for axis)-Use the mouse to scale the object in
any combination of axes.
x,y,z-Typing these after r,m,or s toggles the respective axes on and off.
X,Y,Z-Typing these after r,m,or s turns on the respective axis while
automatically turning off the other two.

Spacebar-Accepts the result of the transformation.The bounding box is
replaced by the object in its new orientation.

Escape-Aborts the transformation.The object is restored to its original
status.

THE CYCLE EDITOR:
----------------

OBJECT MENU

New-This command places a new axis on the worksurface and places you in Add
mode.

Load-Select this command to load a group previously created in the Cycle
editor.Objects from Forms or Detail may not be loaded from this requester.

Save-This requester saves a group with its cycle anima-

                                   -46-

tion data so that it may then be loaded into the Stage editor.

PICK MENU

Group-Selects the entire group.

Object-Allows selection of an individual object within a group.

MODE MENU

Pivot-Enter this mode and select an individual segment.Pivot allows left to
right and up and down rotations of a segment in any of the three views.

Twist-This mode rotates the segment selected along the vertical axis in any
of the three views.

Move-Use this setting to translate the group in any of the views.Selecting
the control point of any segment with move allows you to sclae the segment
to any size.

Add-To add segments to an axis or group,enter this mode.Each segment must
connect to the axis or another segment in the group.To maintain the same
x,y and z orientation as in Detail and Forms,add segment top to bottom in
the Front view,left to right in the Right view and bottom to top in the Top
view.

Delete-Enter this mode and select the control point of the segment you wish
to delete.This deletes the segment and any offspring.

Assign-Clicking on the control point while this mode summons a requester
which allows you to assign an existing object from Forms or Detail to a
particular segment.The same object may be assigned to more than one
segment.Imagine automatically

                                   -47-

scales the object according to the size of the segement.

CELL MENU

First-This takes you to the first frame in the cycle.

Last-Skips to the last frame in the cycle.

Next Key-Jumps to the next frame identified as a key frame.

Prev Key-Jumps to the previous key frame.

Goto-Selecting this command allows the user to set the number of frames in
the cycle.The current key frmane is copied into all newly created frames.

Next -Forwards to the next frame in the cycle.

Prev -Steps to the prior frame in the cycle.

Make Key-Select this command to make the current frame a key cell.changes
to this frame are recorded automatically each time one is made.

Unmake Key-Use this command to delete a key frame from the middle of a
cycle.Imagine will interpolate between the previous key frame and the next
key frame to calculate a new position for the current frame.

Copy From-Copies a key frame from one position in the cycle to
another.Enter the number of the key frame you wish to copy.The current
frame must have been declared a key frame for Copy From to work.

                                   -48-

Remove-This command deletes the first or last key frame from a cycle.

ANIMATE MENU

Make-This command creates a wireframe preview of your current cycle.

Free RAM-Once you have viewed an animation ,select this command to clear it
from RAM.

Play Once-This plays the cycle once.

Play Loop-Plays the cycle various times and presents the user with a timing
requester.

Play Big-Select this item prior to playing back your preview.The animation
will be displayed full screen.To access the animation timing requester,drag
down the animation screen with the left mouse button.
Animation Controller-While your animation preview is playing back,this
timing rquester gives interactive control of speed of playback.Stop pauses
playback at the current frame.Step advances the animation by one frame.Back
rewinds the animation one frame at a time.Rewind takes the preview to the
first frame.

                                   -49-

STATUS LINE

The title bar in the Cycle Editor contains valuable information regarding
your current cycle,including the current frame number,its status and the
current mode.For instance,if your status line reads,"Cell 0*,Add,"it means
your current frame is 0,it is a key frame and you are currently in Add
mode.

THE STAGE EDITOR:
----------------

OBJECT MENU

Load-To load an "actor" object onto the stage,select this command. Normally 
,actors will be loaded in the first frame of an animation;however,if you
wish to have an object "pop" into your scene,go to the specific frame and
then select Load.Objects may also be added as actors in the Action script
(see Action).

Add-Virtually all objects used in the stage will have been created
previously in the Detail,Forms or Cycle editors.Stage allows the user to
add only three types of objects: axes.lights and paths.An Axis is added
when either a tracking or hinging object is neede (see Action for more
information on these actors).

Rename-For the purpose of clarity,any actor may be renamed with this
command.Select the object or group,choose Rename and the New Name requester
will appear.Clear out the name you wish to replace and type in the object s
new name.press Enter to accept your change.Objects may also be renamed
within the Action script.

Delete-This command deletes an object from the animation.Use caution with
this command because no matter what frame the command is invoked ,the
object or group is moved from the entire animation.

                                   -50-

Action-The core of the Stage editor's aniamtion controls are located within
the Action script editor.Selecting this command loads the Action Script.The
Action Script screen presents all the information necessary to create even
the most complex of animations.
Across the top of the screen are Action commands.Beneath these is a frame
counter.In all,the counter may display 50 frames at a time.As the Highest
Frame # is increased,frame numbers appear in the counter.A slider at the
bottom of the screen allows the user to scroll the counter to access frames
which are off the current screen.
Along the left side of the screen are the Actors in the current animation.
to the right are the six control channels available for each actor.As
information is entered for specific actors in each of these control
channels,a colored timeline extends for the number of frames in which the
actor is affected.
Much of the animation control of the Action Script is posibble to duplicate
interactively in the Stage editor.Some effects like point and attribute
metamorphosis,for example,are impossible without the Action Script.

                                   -51-

Add-With Add selected,Actors,Positions,Alignment,Size,Hinge and F/X
timelines may be added to the current animation. As the mouse curso moves
around the screen,frame numbers and control channels are
highlighted.Clicking once at the intersection of a particular frame with a
given control channel adds a timeline at the specific frame.Bear in mind
that control channels are somewhat hierarchical.Position,alignment and size
are irrelevant if an actor has not been added.
To add an actor to the Action script,select add,move the cursor down to
first available actor position at frame one.Click once with the left
button.The title bar will read:"Starting frame is 1. Choose ending frame."
If you have changed the Highest Frame #,click once the last frame.If you
haven't added any frames,click again on the frame one.
The Specify Type requester will appear.Select Normal Object.Now select the
object you wish to add from the file requester.The Object File info
requester appears.Select OK.
Timelines for actor,position,alighnment amd size are automatically added
for the frames you declared.
Delete -Control channel timelines may be deleted by selecting this command
and clicking on the appropriate line.This is necessary if you wish to
change any of the default settings for action channels of fixed actors like
the camera and globals.

                                   -52-

Rename-Selecting rename and clicking on the object name in the left column
will bring up the New Name requester.Clear out the old name and type in the
new one.Accept the changes by pressing Enter.Rename is very helpful when
keeping track of the various elements of an animation.Try to use logical
names like "Target" for camera's tracking object.

Info-This command returns the actor,position,alignment and sizing info
requesters for the respective control channel-Each timeline may be
shortened or lenghtened by adjusting the start and end frame values.All
changes made to the info requester will be reflected in the final
animation.

Cancel-If you are unsure about the changes you have made to the animation
within the Action Script,selecting Cancle exits the script without any
changes to the existing animation.

Undo-This command undoes your last operation.

Done-Selecting this item returns the user to the Stage editor.All changes
made in the Action Script will be reflected in the animation.
Highest Frame #-Enter the number of frames in your animation in this
requester.Enetring a number lower than is currently displayed will
automatically cut excess frames out of your animation and adjust all
timelines accordingly.

Actor-These are the objects or groups which make up your animation.when you
first enter Action Script ,the camera and globals are already ser.These are
"fixed" actors.A fixed actor's various timelines do not need to extend be-

                                   -53-

yond the first frame of an animation to exist throughout.But the various
timelines are useful for these actors,and enable "morphing" effects like
camera moves and zooms and global sky and horizontal color changes.
When an actor is added,the user is prompted to click on the last frame the
actor appears.In most instances,this is the last frame of the
animation.start and end frames may be changes at any time.Next,the Specify
Typ requester appears.Imagine distiguishes between two types of "variable"
actors:normal objects and light sources.These actors are only present in
the frames indicated by their Position channels.

Normal Object-Selecting this item from the Specify Type requester brings up
a file requester.Once the user selects the object he wishes to load,the
object file info requester appears.

Start/End Frame-The start and end frames represent the frames the user
selected when adding the actor.these may be changes at any time.Imagine
will prompt you if the frame number you select is outside the number of
frames deckared for your animation.
Filename.The complete path and filename for your actor is listed in this
space.

                                   -54-

Numbers of cycles to perform-This is meaningful for cycle objects created
within the Cycle Editor.For example,assume you have an object with a
ten-frame cycle.If you have a 30-frame animation,you could enter 3.0000 and
your object would repeat its cycle three times.If you have an uneven frame
count,like 27 frames,in your animation,Imagine will re-tween the cycle so
that ist will play out three times over the 27 frames.If you enter only
1.0000,the cycle will be tweened once over 27 frames.If you leave this
entry at 0.0000,the first frame of the cycle would be repeated over the
entire animation.To force Imagine to play the cycle as you designed
it,divide the number of frames in your animation by the cycle's frame
count.In other words,for a 10 frame cycle to play oout accurately over 27
frames,it would play 2.7 cycles.

Initial cycle phase(0.0 .. 1.0)-This entry allow a cycle to begin somewhere
other than the first frame.For example,an entry of .5 would start a
ten-frame cycle during its fifth frame.

Reverse cycle motion-Selecting this switch force the cycle to play
backwards.Other cycle-related settings will still take effect.

Transition frame count-The setting represents one of the most powerful
animation controls in Imagine.The transition frame

                                   -55-

count is the number of frames it will require to morph one object into
another.To achieve a smooth object transition,assume you have created a 30
frame aniamtion.Add an actor only in frame one.Then add the second actor on
the same line in frame two through 30.Enter 28 in the transition frame
count.The actor's points and color attributes will morph from frames two to
29. (Note:for morphing to be possible,the starting and ending objects must
be comprised of same number of points!) Smaller number in the transition
frame count will result in a quicker morph.A transition of one would cause
one object to "pop" to another.

Light Source-The other variable actor which may be added to an animation is
a light source.Imagine supports up to 32,000 light sources in a scene and
these can be spherical,cylindrical or conical.Lights may or may not cast
shadows.Light sources may also be morphed to different colors.A light
source must be present for Imagine to render a scene.
Start/End Frame-The start and end frames represent the frames the user
selected

                                   -56-

when adding the actor.These may be changed at any time.Imagine will prompt
you if the frame number you select is outside the number of frames declared
for your animation.

Spherical-A spherical light is an omni-directional light source,similiar in
effect to a light bulb.

Cyclindrical-A cylindrical light is defined by two measurements:its
length(y) and radius(x).The cylindrical light is similiar to a
spotlight.Only those objects which fall within its path are illuminated by
a cylindrical light source.To set the size of a cylindrical light,select
its size channel.The z parameter has no effect on the light source.

Conical-A conical light source is also defined by its length and radius.but
the light emanates from a single point at the light's origin.
Cast Shadows-Not all light sources in Imagine cast shadows.To speed trace
times,the default for light sources is no shadows.Selecting this item will
cause any of the different light sources to cast shadows in full trace
mode.

Diminish Intensity-Light sources may exhibit attributes of lamps or suns
with the command.The default setting means that the light emanating from
the source is equally bright no matter how far the target.

                                   -57-

Selecting Diminish Intensity means that the light will have reduced
influence the further it is from an object.

Red/Green/Blue Intensity-Light sources may be colored in any of 16.7
million shades.The default setting for light sources is white.Be careful of
using colored light because its effect are difficult to predict.

Transition frame count-Light sources may morph in color,intensity or
shape.To understand how to morph an object,see Transition frame count under
Normal object.

Camera-The camera is treated as a"fixed" actor.Even if the Action Script
shows the camera only in the first frame of an animation,the camera will
continue in the same position for the entire length of the project.All
other actor controls (position,align,size,hinge and f/x) may be applied to
camera.

Globals-These settings define the world in which you place your animation
or scene.Globals is also a "fixed" actor.Any global setting designated only
in the first frame will

                                   -58-

continue for the entire length of the animation.Global settings may be
"morphed" by placing a second set of global information later in the
animation and setting an appropriate transition frame count.While in Add
and Info mode,selecting the Globals actor produces the Globals Info
Requester.
Start/End Frame-The default end frame for globals would be last frame of
the scene;however,setting an earlier number allows transition effects.If a
second Global actor isn't added following the last frame,the first actor s
setting will be applied through the end of the animation.

Brush Name-In order to simulate refletion in scanline rendering mode,you
may load an IFF/ILBM picture that serves as the sky,horizon and ground you
wish to reflect.This brush will automatically be mapped onto the surface of
objects with some amount of reflectivity in their attributes.This gives a
convincing sense of reflection,but remember that the objects will not
reflect the "enviroment",not one another.

Ambient R,G,B-This setting allows you to create an ambient light of any
color.Use ambient light sparingly,as it tends to wash out the image.In
addition,colored light will affect the rendered appearance of your objects.
Horizon R,B,G-Choose a color between 0 and 255 on the red,green and blue
sliders to set your horizon.
+Zenith R,G,B-Assuming that you are looking at your front view,this setting
allows you to choose the colors of the top-most portion of your

                                   -59-

scene.

-Zenith R,G,B-From the front view,this setting selects the colors below the
horizon.

Sky Blending-Imagine takes the color settings for horizon and positive and
negative zeniths and creates a color gradation.This value may be set
bettween 0 and 255 for maximum dithering(blending).Users who wish to create
24-bit images should not use any blending.

Genlock Sky-If you wish to superimpose your Imagine images over live
video,selecting this setting will make the zeniths and horizon black or
color 0. (Note:although they won't be visible,zenith and horizon settings
will affect the appearance of reflective objects!)

Star Field Density-This feature is not implemented in the current release
of Imagine.(0.9)

Transition Frame count-If you add a globals actor after frame one of your
animation,use this setting to control the amount of frames in the
transition between the two global settings.This feature makes it possible
to create sunrise and sunsets,lightning and other natural phenomena.Bear in
mind that color transitions can be unpredictable.Getting a smooth color
shift may require creating intermediate settings with addititional global
actors.

Posn.-The position control channel is necessary for every actor on stage
except globals.Whenever an actor is added to the stage ,a position timeline
is added automatically.This position channel convey the precise final
location of the ac-

                                   -60-

tor's axis in the animation.If you wish to have the actor follow a path,you
must Delete the default timeline and then Add a new position channel.This
brings up the Specify Type requester.The user must then select Follow Path
(see below for more information).For simpler movements,you may select Tween
Position.

Tween Position-Selecting tween position brings up the Position Info
requester.
Start/End Frame-These numbers represent the first and last frames governed
by the position timeline.these may be edited at any time.
End Frame Position Values-This is the location of the actor's axis in the
last frame of the timeline.To translate an actor for a specified distance
without creating a path,you must do the following:
Declare the highest frame #.
Add the actor for frame 1.
If necessary,modify the actor's position channel with the Info command (see
Info).

                                   -61-

On the same Actor channel,Add the actor for frames 2 through the end of
your animation.Make your transition number equal the total number of
animation frames less two.
Add a position channel for frames 2 through the end of your animation.
Select Tween Position from the Specify Type requester.
Enter the final position of your actor.
When you render your animation,your actor will move smoothly from his
starting to stopping position.

Follow Path-The process described above is effective when wishing to
translate an object over a simple distance,but Follow  Path represents a
much more powerful method of assigning actors to a complex motion
paths.When selected,the user is presented with the Follow Path Info
requester.
Start/End Frame-These entries represent the frames in which the actor will
begin and end its travel along the path.
Path Name-Enter the path name in this requester.The path must added as an
individual actor!
Children follow parent object-Selecting this item will insure that objects
within a group will follow the path at an equal distance from the group s
parent object.

Align-This control governs all rotational alignment of your actors.This
might be as simple as having an actor rotate on the z axis over the course
of an animation or as complex as banking,pitching and yawing as it follows
a path.The alignment channel also controls tracking objects.The type of
alignment is selected in the Specify Type requester.
Tween Alignment-This is the simplest method to set alignment.Teh degree of
rotation entered will be immediately reflected on the Stage editor.If two
alignment settings are entered,the program will "morph" between those
settings over the number of frames designated.
Start/End Frame-These entries represent the number of frames in which the
actor will be governed by alignment settings.
End Frame Position Values-Set the

                                   -63-

appropriate degree of rotation for the actor's x,y and z axes.

Align to Path-If an actor is assigned to a path,this command will rotate
the actor along global z in order to keep the actor moving"forward".Without
path alignment,a character whose path suddenly veers left slide to left
instead of turning.If the path turns left again,the character will appear
to be traveling"backwards".
Start/End Frame-This designates the first and last frames in which the
actor aligns to a path.

Keep Y horizontal-Most often,objects will rotate along x when following a
path,like a car riding up a hill.However,some objects remain horizontal as
they move along,like helicopters.This command forces the actor to maintain
its horizontal alignment.
Track to Object-This command will most often be used with the camera,where
it is desirable to have it fixed to some specific target.Track to object
also is valuable if you wish an object to remain at aome fixed position
relative to another which is moving.

                                   -64-

Start/End Frame-These are the first and last frames in which the actor will
be tracked.
Object Name-This is the name of the actor which is being tracked.The object
name must be unique and must exist in the script for tracking to take
effect.
Initial/Final Y Rotation-While an object is tracked,the tracker(usually the
camera) may rotate along its y axis.These values represent the degrees of
rotation along that axis.
Size-Actors may also be scaled dynamically throughout an animation with
this control.For the camera,size represents the focal length,which may also
be modified.
Start/End Frame-These are the first and last frames in which the actor will
be sized.
End Frame Size Values-These represent the axis at the end of sizing.For the
camera,focal length is determined by the x and y settings.Y represents the
distance from the focal point.A setting of half the Y value in the X would
return a normal focal length.Larger settings for X result in wider angle
camera views.Smaller X values present tele-photo camera views.

                                   -65-

Hinge-The hinge is an actor which constricts movement of the hinged object.
For example,if a moving object is hinged to a stationary object,the moving
actor will be constrained by the hinge and move in a parabolic arc about
the hinge.The further the distance between actor  and hinge,the larger the
arc.The smaller the distance,the tighter the arc.
Start/End Frame-Select the beginning and ending frame of the hinge effect.
Hinge Object-Designate the name of the actor which will serve as the hinge.
The actor must exist as part of the current script for the hinge to take
effect.

F/X-These controls are seperate,programmable routines which will be
released peridically by Impulse.The first available F/X is Explode,which
literally breaks an object apart into all its component triangles.Contact
Impulse for more information on ordering F/X.
Selecting Done on the Action Script will return you to Stage Editor.Note
that many of the position and alignment controls of the Action Script are
possible interactively on the Stage.Bear in mind that interactive changes
must take place at the last frame of any existing timelines.In other
words,if your object is tweening from one position to the next over 30
frames,changes entered at the Stage in Frame 2 will be ignored.Changes to
the final position will cause the entire animation to be re-tweened.

Transformation-Selecting this command presents the us-

                                   -66-

er with the transformation requester.to use the requester,click in the
action indicated to the left and enter the appropriate numeric value in the
x,y and z entries to the right.Select world to base the action on the world
s axis or local to base the action on the group's axis.Selecting Transform
Axis Only will only transform the group's axis of rotation.
Rotation-This revolves the group or axis by the amount indicated in each of
the x,y and z entries.A value of 360 in any of the axes would indicate a
complete revolution.

Scale-This increase the group's size on any axis by the indicated amount.A
value of 2 on x would double a group's width.
Translate-Moves a group or axis by the indicated amount in any axis. 
Entering -20 in the Z axis would move the group  -20 units in the Z
direction.

Alignment-After a series of rotations,it is often difficult to tell how
your group is orientated.Selecting alignment returns the orientation of
each of the axes.Selecting 0 for all three axes would return a group to its
original orientation.

Size-This command only affects a group's axis.The default axis size is 32
on x,y and z.

Position-Select this to determine the exact location of your group.When a
new axis is loaded,its default location is 0,0,0.Once an object is
created,moved and saved,it is reloaded at its last position.

                                   -67-

World-this settings bases rotations and alignment to the world's fixed
axis.In this manner,x can always be considered left to right,z up and down
and y in and out.

Local-This setting bases rotation and alignment on the object or group s
axis.Even though a group has been rotated,it may still be stretched by
entering the desired value in the appropriate axis and selecting local.
Transform Axis Only-All changes selected in the Transformation Requester
may be applied only to the group's axis of rotation with this setting.

Make Path-This command generates a special object from at least two picked
axes.To make a path,add an axis and position it at the starting point.Add
another axis and move it to the ending position.Rotate the axes on their
local Z,so that their Y's line up properly.Pick the starting axis,hold the
shift key and pick the ending axis.With both axes picked,select Make Path.
A line will be drawn between the two points and the  program will
recognize the resulting object to be a path.Any number of axes may
comprises a path.Any rotations along x or y will cause the path to turn
accordingly.

Make Closed Path-This command is identical to Make Path except that it
joins the first and last axes to make a closed loop.

MODE MENU

Pick Groups-This is the default mode of operation for the Stage
Editor.Children of groups may not be manipulated individually on the Stage.

                                   -68-

Edit Path-With a path selected entering Edit Path mode will allow you to
interactively reposition or align the path's component axes.

PICK/SELECT MENU

Home-This command selects the first actor added to the stage.
Select Next-This command cycles through actors in the order they were added
to the stage.

Select Prev.-This command cycles through actors in reverse.

Pick Select-After an object is selected with one of the above commands, 

Pick Select allows it to be transformed.

Unpick Last-Particulary in multiple select mode,it is sometimes necessary
to unpick the last object selected.Use this command to do so without
affecting the other picked objects.

Find by Name-This command presents a Name Requester.Enter the name of the
objectyou wish to select.The views will center the object and the actor
will be selected and ready to be picked.

Find by Requester-Selecting this command presents a requester that lists
all actors on stage along with pertinent size information.clock on the
group you wish to select and the orthogonal views will automatically center
it on your screen.

                                   -69-
