Publisher Plus

Welcome to publishing...

The development of electronic page assembly systems in the publishing
industry is both changing the working environment within the industry
and opening doors to people previously outside publishing.  As recently
as three years ago, typesetting was only avaiable to people with large
and expensive dedicated machines.  No more!  Welcome to the exciting world
of desktop publishing.

Today's writers are not restricted to their typewriteres...their typewriters
are the golden gate to the entire world of publishing.  Today's authors do
not have to rely on typists, typesetters and proofreaders...they can do it
all themselves.  From original concept right on through to the finished page,
the writer of today can have total control over his or her document.  And the
most versatile system for doing desktop publishing on an Amiga computer is
with the new Publisher Plus electronic page makeup program.

Your Publisher Plus program allows you to enter text from word processors,
enter illustrations from paint programs, directly input headlines, edit text
or illustrations, and assemble all these elements into a page format of your
choosing.  You may go back into the page and change it around as ush as you
like. When you are happy with the way your page looks on the screen, you can
print it out on your dot matrix printer, a laser printer, or save it to disk
to print at your local print shop.

This manual is designed to assist the beginner to Amiga computing and also
give in-depth help to those familiar with the Amiga, but new to publishing
in general.  There are six chapters.  Chapters 1,5 & 6 consist of general
information and are for everyone.  Chapter 2 is designed to get the beginner
publishing easily.  We recommend that you acquaint yourself with basic Amiga
functions by referring to the Introduction to Amiga manual that came with
your computer.  People familiar with their Amiga might want to skip Chapter
2 and go right to Chapters 3 & 4, although the simple exercise in Chapter
2 can be very useful in familiarizing anyone to Publisher Plus quickly.

This program manual occasionally uses terms that are familiar to printers and
publishers but not known to people outside the trade.  Chapter 5 contains a
quickee course in typestyles and Chapter 6 has a glossary of printer's
terminology.

Have fun with this program.  Experiment with it and learn all that it can do.

1-A.  Before You Begin
Publisher Plus is a powerful program; it has to do a lot of things.  It's
going to take a little time to learn all the methods the program uses to
assemble the page.  The exercise in Chapter 2 is designed to get you into
the system easily and quickly. But in order to use it to your best advantage,
you should first understand the basic Amiga system...  You should know how
to use the workbench options, pull-down menus, the Notepad, Preferences, the
disk-copy and initializing programs.  Between the Introduction to Amiga manual
and the prompts on the screen, you should find these simple to operate.

You should scan this entire manual to see how it is laid out, but don't try
to memorize it now.  We'll take it a step at a time and you will learn as we
go.

1-B.  What You Can and Cannot Do With Publisher Plus
With Publisher Plus you can arrange text and graphics from other programs.
In addition, you can input and edit text directly on the page using the
keyboard.  The elements on the page can be rearranged as many times as you
like and when you are satisfied, you can save it to your disk and print it
out on a printer.  Blank formats can be set up and saved so pages will be
uniform throughout an entire publication.  And they can be saved for future
use too.

Publisher Plus will accept text from word processors and text flowed in
from a word processor can be set in any of the typestyles and size available
on the Publisher Plus disk.  Presently, Publisher Plus will accept text from
the following word processors:  Amiga Notepad, Textcraft, Scribble! as well
as any word processor that saves a palin or ASCII text file.  Newer word
processors will be supported with future updates when necessary. In addition,
more typestyles are available from other sources that can be copied to the
program disk.  See Chapter 5 for more information on typestyles.

Color pictures can be called up from any graphics programs supporting the
IFF file system.  Presently, these programs include:  Electronic Art's
Deluxe Paint; and Deluxe Paint II; Aegis Images, Aegis Draw, Aegis Draw
Plus and Aegis Art Pak.  Colored graphics will be converted, allowing them
to be printed in representative shades of gray.  Graphics can be re-sized
and cropped within the Publisher Plus work page.

As with all other Amiga programs, you must use double-sided disks. While
single0sided disks might work, they are not reliable and you culd lose your
data.

Publisher Plus will output to any printer listed in the Amiga Preferences
menu.  The only exception is that daisy wheel printers cannot be used.
Refer to Chapter 4-F, "Printer Problems", if your printer is not in
Preferences.

1-C.  System Requirements
This version of Publisher Plus requires an Amiga with at least 512K memory
and Version 1.2 of the Workbench.  Amiga 1000 users will need Version 1.2 of
Kickstart as well.  While Publisher Plus has its own workbench and can be
loaded from Kickstart, the Amiga workbench can be used for Disk-Copy,
Initialize and other programs you use.  See your authorized Amiga dealer
if you do not already have this release.

You do not need the optional external disk drive but it sure helps.  Since
PublisherPlus integrates data from other programs, having the second disk
drive saves disk swapping.

Any printer found in the Preferences printer list can be used with Publisher
Plus.  If your printer is listed, select it and you are ready.

1-D.  Making a Back-Up Copy
Before firing up PublisherPlus and working with it, you should make a
duplicate copy of the program disk to use and put the original disk in a
safe place.  The program disk is not protected and you can make as many
copies as you need. It is a good idea to close the write-protect on the
Publisher Plus disk when making copies.  Slide the little write-protect
tab toward the edge of the disk.  When you can see through the hole, the
disk is protected.  The write-protect must be open on the blank disk, i.e.,
you cannot see through the hole.  When making disk copies, you do not have
to initialize the blank disk.

To make a copy on a single drive system, turn on the Amiga.  When asked
for the workbench, insert your workbench 1.2 disk and then your original
PublisherPlus program disk.  Click once on the disk icon that appears on
the upper right and then select Duplicate from the workbench menu. Follow
the prompts through 4 or 5 disk swaps, making sure that your original
PublisherPlus disk is the FROM disk and the blank disk is the TO disk.

On systems with two drives, insert PublisherPlus in the internal drive
and the blank disk in the external drive. When both icons appear on the
screen, move the PublisherPlus icon onto the blank disk icon.

1-E.  Determining the Version of your Program
In the natural evolution of developing a good program, new updates are
issued periodically.  Owners of PublisherPlus should be sure to send in
the Registration Card that comes with the program so Northesat Software
Group can notify you when an update is available.  You also should be
aware of which version you have.  You can find this by clicking once on
the Publisher Plus icon in the workbench window and selceting Info from
the workbench menu.  This will display a screen showing pertinent information
about PublisherPlus including, in the comments field, the version number
and the date of release.  Please include this number in any communication
with Northeast Software Group.  No information should be changed on this
screen.  Click on Quit to exit the display.

1-F.  Setting the Keymap
PublisherPlus is fully compatible with all keymaps for the Amiga line of
products.  Most users in North American should never need to change the
default keymap which is used when you boot up your Amiga.  International
users may need to change the keymap in order to use the additional characters
not available on the standard USA keymap.  Consult your specific Amiga
documentation about the SetMap and KeyToy utilities included with your Amiga.

Chapter 2

2-A.  The Publisher's Workbench
When loading PublisherPlus into your Amiga, the first stop is the workbench.
Insert the PublisherPlus disk instead of the Amiga workbench.  Click twice
on the disk icon in the upper right and the Publisher workbench will present
itself with some of the familiar Amiga icons.  PublisherPlus uses the
"Intuition: system in the same way the Amiga Workbench uses them so the use
of the disk copy, initializing, the CLI, and the trash can are all explained
in the Amiga User's Guide.  The little fellow standing at his "stone"
hand-setting type is the PublisherPlus icon.  If you were to click twice on
it, the program would load.  There is also an icon called Pattern Editor, a
special function tool that is further explained in Chapter 4.  Before loading
the program, first let's check the settings in the Preferences menu.

2-B.  Setting Preferences For the First Time
The Preferences menu has been preset to PublisherPlus's requirements.  You
should not change it unless your particular equipment has different
requirements.  There are, however, some options that you can control for
your own particular comfort.  All settings are listed here in case some
of them get changed inadvertently and you have to set them again.

Click twice on the Preferences icon.  Preferences on the Amiga consists
of three menu screens.  The first menu selections are pretty much for your
own personal comfort.  Adjust the mouse speed and key repeats, center the
picture on the screen, and set the date.  Text should be set at 80 columns.

The colors are preset to present you with a blank white page window and
black type.  You should not change the black and the white color selectors.
Changing them will have an adverse effect on what you get from your dot
matrix printer.

When you are satisfied with all the selections on the main menu, click on
the Change Printer gadget.  A second menu appears.  See if your printer is
listed.  If it is, move the selector up and down until it is centered in
the blue box.  Select PostScript for any PostScript output.  If your printer
is not listed, see Chapter 4 - Printer Problems.

Starting at Paper Size, the options are preset at:  Narrow Tractor;
Length=66 lines; Left Margin=1; Right Margin=80; Paper Tyep=Fanfold;
Quality=Draft;Pitch=10 picas and Spacing=6 lines per inch. These are
necessary settings.  Do not change these.

Click on Graphic Select gadget.  A third menu will appear.  Make sure
the following settings are as follows:  Threshold=2; Aspect=Horizontal;
Shade=Black & White; and Image=Positive.  Again, do not change these
settings.

Click on OK until you get back to the main Preferences menu, then click
on Save.  This will save your preferences and take you back to the
PublisherPlus workbench window.

2-C.  Preparing a Data Disk
In order to have a place to save your document,  you must create a data
disk. Take a blank disk and insert it in your disk drive. To initialize
a disk, insert the disk in a disk drive, select the disk icon that appears
on the workbench and then choose Initialize from the Disk Menu.  The disk
drive light will come on until the initialization is completed.

Once the formatting cycle is completed, the disk will be named "empty".
Click on the disk icononce and select Rename from the workbench Menu.
Use the delete key to erase the name "empty" and type in the name "Data".

2-D.  Loading Publisher Plus for the First Time
We are ready to load up the PublisherPlus program for the first time.  On
one-drive systems, remove the data disk and re-insert the PublisherPlus disk.
Click twice on the Publisher icon inthe workbench window and the program will
present you with a blank white screen.

The coordinates X and Y displayed in the title bar at the top of the screen
refer to the location of the cursor.  X refers to the distance in inches
from the left edge of the page.  Y refers to the distance in inches from
the top.  If you move the cursor across the screen so that both coordinates
are at 1, you will be at a point exactly 1 inch down and 1 inch to the right
from the upper left corner of the page.  Moving the cursor to a point where
both coordinates are 1.50 will put you 1 and a half inches down and to the
right.

The part of an 8" x 11" page that you can see on your screen at any one time
is roughly 5 inches wide and 2 1/2" deep or 1/8th of a page.  This is
necessary to allow you to read your text.

2-E.  A Smaple Exercise
We are going to lay out and assemble a complete page for this exercise and
we will use the Sample Layout 2-C for our guidelines.  All text and grpahics
for this page are integrated into the PublisherPlus program disk.  Remember,
all type, whether input from the keyboard or entered from a word processor,
must be entered into a guide.

This exercise will measure increments in inches.  Picas, the standard
printer's measurement used in the United States, might prove to be more hand
for you later on.  American printers have been using picas for centuries and
like a lot of things from the past, picas have been absorbed into the new
technology.  The main reason is that picas are only subdivided once...you
only have picas and half picas.  There are six picas to an inch.  The numbers
are simple!  You might love them.  However, the default setting on
PublisherPlus is in inches and we won't change them at this time.

Always start a new document by first giving it a document name.  This is done
by selecting New Document from the Project Menu.  A directory requester is
now displayed.  Assuming you have a one-drive system, remove the program disk
and insert the data disk in the internal drive (df0:).  On tow-drive systems,
put the data disk in the external drive (df1:).  Next click the mouse in the
box just to the right of the word DRAWER:, use the backspace key to erase
anything in it.  Now type in the word "Data:Sample".  Hit return and a
requester will come up that says "Directory not found, Create it?"  Click
on Proceed.  Now the cursor will appear next to the word "File".  Type in
the words "My-Document", hit return and click on the Save gadget in the
lower left hand corner of the directory requester.  What you have done is
create a file 'drawer' into which the file 'My-Document' will always be
saved.

Looking at the sample layout or 'dummy', we see we will need a type guide
for our headline, three type guides for text, and room for a grpahic.  It
is a good idea anytime you are going to assemble a page to roughly 'dummy'
up the page on a piece of paper before you start.

A logical sequence for setting up the page would be to place all the guides
and graphics first, before entering the text. In this case, however, we will
place the graphics last.

By selecting NEW DOCUMENT from the Project menu, a requester will appear
that allows you to set the type guides in advance for the page.  All
parameters set in this box are fully adjustable later on when you work on
the page.  We will go into this function in depth in Chapter 3.  Click in
each box, back-space over the default numbers, and type in the following
new ones.  Be sure to hit RETURN after the entries are made in each box.
We will start this exercise from a screen with the following parameters:

    LEFT=.5 (half inch)     RIGHT=.5
    TOP= 3 inches)          BOTTOM=.5
    NUMBER OF COLUMNS=3
    SPACE BETWEEN COLUMNS=.25 (1/4 inch)

Click on PROCEED when done.  A screen with three equal column guides should
be in front of you now.  Because we started three inches from the top, you
will only see the guides if you use the scrolling gadget on the right side
of the screen to move down the page.  Try it and see.  Scroll up and down
the page.  Use the scrolling gadget on the bottom of the screen to move
sideways.  When done, scroll back to the top left corner of the page again.

2-F.  Setting the Headline
The three guides we set up are for text copy.  We will now set up a headline
typeguide above them.  Select Create from the Guides menu.  Move the cursor
to the point on the screen where:

X=0.50 (half inch from side)    Y-1.00 (one inch from top)

Click once and drag the cursor down and to the right until you can see the
row of guides below and can align the new guide with the right hand side of
the right hand guide below it.  The coordinates should be:

X=7.50                          Y=2.75

Notice that PublisherPlus will automatically scroll smoothly sideways or
down when you hit either the right side or the bottom of the screen.

When you are at the right coordinates, click the mouse to lock the guide in.
Scroll again to the top left side of the screen.

This will be the guide for the headline which we will input from the keyboard.
To do this, we will need to select a typeface that is large enough for that
purpose.  32 point pTIMES is a good one for this.  Select FONT from the
Attriubtes menu.  The Font Directory will present itself.  Find and click on
pTIMES(dir).  The disk drive will purr and pTIMES will appear in the Drawer
selector of the box.  The directory will list all the sizes available for
pTIMES.  Since no 32 point pTIMES is listed in the directory, click in the
space next to the word FILE and type in 32.  PublisherPlus will have to
scale the font to that size.  Click on LOAD.  A requester will appear that
says "Font Not Found, Okay to Scale It?"  Click on proceed. The directory
will disappear.

To enter the TYPE MODE, select TYPE from the Tool menu, click within the top
guide and type in the following:

    Now...at last!!! Electronic (Return)
    Page Processing comes to (Return)
    Amiga - Publisher Plus (Return)

(We hope you pardon the advertisement!)

Select TYPE from the Tool Menu to leave the TYPE MODE.  When this is done,
we notice that the headline is aligned to the left.  Perhaps we should center
it instead.  We also should make the headline bold.  Go to the Attributes
menu and select BOLD.  Then select CENTER from the same menu.  Select REFLOW
TEXT from the Edit menu and click within the headline guide.  Notice that
the headline jumps to the right and realigns itself, each line centered
under the previous one.  The type also become bolder.  But it is still a
little high above the text guides.  Scroll to the right until the 'g' in
Amiga is on the left and you can see the sizing gadget on the lower right.
Click an dhold on the sizing gadget and move the bottom line of the guide
until it is just below the 'g' in Amiga.  Release the mouse button.  If
you got too close to the letters, the bottom line might go off the screen.
If it doesn, just click on the sizing gadget again and pull the line down
a little bit more until the bottom line comes back.

Click and hold anywhere within the headline guide and move the whole
guideblock straight down until it is just above the text guides.  Align
the guide with the guides below and release the mouse button.  Now the
headline is in a good position on the page.

2-G.  Inputting Text from the Work Processor
Because we do not know how much room our text material is going to take,
we'll place it now.  Scroll around until you are at the top of the left
type guide.  Since we will want to use a small text typeface for our body
copy, we'll have to change fonts again.  Using the same routine we used to
select our headline font, select pTIMES in 13 point.  Since ]only 12 and 24
points are listed, you will have to enter 13 next to the FILE again.  Hit
return and PublisherPlus will scale the font to 13 point.  Go to the
Attributes Menu and change the type from Bold back to Plain and the alignment
from Center to Left.  Also from the Attributes Menu, select Leading.  When
the requester appears, backspace over the 13 and change it to 14.  This will
add a point of space between the lines.

When you have your font selecting done, select GET TEXT from the Place menu.
The disk directory will appear.  Scroll down the directory until you find
TEXT(dir) and click on it.  That title will appear in the DRAWER box below.
Click on TEXT-SAMPLE.doc which appears in the sub-directory.

TEXT-SAMPLE.doc will appear in the space next to FILE:  Click on LOAD.

When the directory disappears, click in the first guide on the left.  The
text will flow into the guide until it is full.  Now select CONTINUE from
the Edit menu and click first in the left guide (the FROM guide) and then
in the next guide (the TO guide).  Now any text that wouldn't fit in the
first guide will flow into the second one. Do the same routine to flow text
into the third guide.

Now lets take a look at how our page is in its entirety. Select FULL PAGE
from the display menu.  It might take a few seconds, so don't be alarmed.
As long as the ZZ's are on the cursor, something is happening.  A full page
view will appear on the right side of the screen.  You won't be able to read
it, but the components of the page will be represented.  Notice that we ran
out of type before the third column was full.  Click in the center of the
full page view and it will disappear.

2-H.  Rearranging the Text Material
Now we will adjust our text blocks to allow room for the graphic. Move the
cursor down until you are at the bottom of the center guide.  Using the
sizing gadget for that guide, move the bottom line up to the top of the
screen and let go of the button.  PublisherPlus will shorten the center
guide and flow all excess text into the third guide.  Make note of the last
word in the third block and keep resizing the cetner guide upward until the
third guide has text all the way to the bottom.  Try to keep the width the
same throughout this maneuver.  You can scroll up and down to check on your
progress.

When the third guide is full, all there is to do is click and hold somewhere
inside the center guide and bring the whole block down to the bottom.  Let
the automatice scrolling feature bring you there fast.  Align the bottom
lines, let the text catch up with it and that's it.

2-I.  Calling Up a Graphic
Now we'll put in the picture.  Scroll up to a position where the tops of the
two outisde guideblocks are centered vertically on the screen.  Select GET
IMAGE from the Place menu.  The main directory will appear.  Scroll down the
directory until you find IMAGES (dir).  Select this and the Images directory
will appear.  Find and click on LOGO.pic, click on it, make sure it appears
in the FILE box, and click on LOAD.

After a moment, the picture will appear hanging on the cursor.  Without
touching a button, move the mouse until the picture's guide is aligned with
the type guides along the top.  Click once to lock it in place.o  That was
easy!  Well, not that easy.  The picture is a tad to narrow.  It was drawn
in low resolution and PublisherPlus uses medium resolution.  Click and hold
inside the picture's guide and move it to the left.  Watch the picture, not
the guide.  When it is far enough left to fit well but not touching the type,
release the mouse button.  It is okay if the guides overlap.  Click and hold
the sizing gadgt and move straight right until the ugide on that side
overlaps the righthand type guide equally.  Too wide?  Move the sizing gadget
to the left.  Adjust it until the image is centered between the columns of
text.  Sometimes dealing with graphics takes a little bit of time, so
remember.  if the ZZ's are there, just be patient.

NOTE:  You might find that you cannot get to the sizing gadget without moving
the right text block.  You have two options, neither one of which involves
moving the type block.  Simply move the picture to the left until it is
freeof the type guide and do your resizing there.  Then center the picture
in the space.  Keep making adjustments until you are satisfied.  Option
number two is to select SEND TO BACK under the Edit menu.  This option is
more invovled and is fully explained in the next chapter.  Just use option
one for now and enjoy all the practice you're getting.

2-J.  Lines and Blocks
If you've gotten this far, you have some idea of the basics of PublisherPlus
and are beginning to have some fun.  Let's not quit!  Scroll up to the upper
left hand corner of the page.  Under the Patterns Menu, select the lightest
screen pattern, located just under the words "Load Line.  This is a 10%
screen.  Select SOLID from the Tools menu, move the cursor to the upper left
corner of the headline guide, click and hold the mouse button and drag it
right and down until the entire headline guide is tinted with the screen
pattern.  Get it all ajusted, release the mouse, click it again to lock it
in.  Practice adjusting both the type and the pattern block until they fit
nicely together.  Do not worry about the guides themselves.  They disappear
in the printing.

Next select Frame from the Tools Menu and draw a frame around the outside of
the little publisher guy's picture.  Click in the upper left and drag down to
the right until the new frame slightly surrounds the grraphic's guideblock.
Now when the guideblock disappears, there will still be a frame around the
picture.
If you want to see what the page looks like without the guides, select HIDE
from the Guides menu.  Clicking anywhere on the page or selecting SHOW from
the same menu will bring them back.

Now we'll put a little ornamentation on the page.  First we'll type in a
border at the top of the page just above the headline.  Select BORDERS (dir)
under FONTS from the Attributes menu the same way we selected all previous
fonts.  The only point size is 32.  This font has no letters.  It is
ornamentation such as rules and dingbats that can be accessed from the
keyboard.  Dingbats are small characters and symbols sometimes used in
printing.  See all the characters on this font in the Typestyle samples
in Chapter 5.  When you have loaded the font, create a guide just above
the headline, about an inch deep and spanning the whole page.  Make it about
an inch wider than the headline guide.  Select TYPE from the Tools menu,
click in the little guide and keep striking the captial "F".  Do not type off
the screen. Scroll across as you type.  Stop when the rule is as wide as the
headline block.  We do not want to have the characters to make a border, hit
return.  Again select Type (Right Amiga Key - T) to leave the Type Mode.  Now
you can move the rule down closer to the black block.  There is even room
enough to put one down at the bottom if you want.  "BORDERS" has many
different rules for this purpose.

2-K.  And Now.  The Test!
If you have stayed with us this far, your page is nearly complete.  You
have gotten through some of the basic operations of PublisherPlus and now
it is time for a test.  Since we have a little space underneath the picture,
it would only be right to include a little caption about the original graphic.
And... we have such a caption for you to put there.  The text for the caption
reads:  "Old Time Publishers had to do it one letter at a time.  And then
they had to put all the type back into little drawers.  See how much easier
it is today?"  Your job is to draw a guide, select 18 point pTIMES as a
typestyle to use, make it bold italic, type it into the guide and make it
centered.  When you have accomplished this, use the LINE option from the
Tools menu and put in a simple rule to separate the caption from the main
text.

Do this and you are no longer an apprentice... you're a joyrneyman.
Congratulations!


Chapter 3
3-A.  The Publisher Plus Window
To get your publishing career off to a running start, refer to the view of
Publisher Plus's work page. You can print an 8" x 11" page with this program.
In order to be able to read what appears on your screen though, you can only
work in an area that is one-eighth of the total page at a time, rougly 5
inches wide and 3 inches deep.  Figure 3-B illustrates a full page and its
relationship to the work area, or window, that your screen represents.

To work within the window, there are several tools and gadgets available
for your use.  Starting at the upper left corner in the Menu Bar, we'll go
through their uses.

The Window Closing Gadget has the same function in PublisherPlus that is
has in most Amiga programs.  It allows you to exit the program and go back
to the workbench, the equivalent to calling Quit from the Project menu.
Make sure to save anything that is on the page because this is just a fast
way out.  There's no way back.

Moving to the right along the Menu Bar is the Prompt Line.  This is an aid
that reminds you what function you have to perform once you have selected a
menu item.  Messages like "Select first point..." when you initiate a Create
Guide command or "Position Text.." about every menu item you select will
have an appropriate prompt.  Great if you get interrupted and forget what
you were doing.

To the right of the Prompt Line are the Coordinates.  These tell you the
exact position of the pointer on the screen.  The X coordinate is the
distance from the left side of the page and the Y coordinate is the distance
from the top.  The coordinates can be given in inches, millimeters, or picas,
which you can change by selecting Set Units from the Display menu.

The Front-to-Back gadgets, located in the upper right corner allow you to
go to the workbench without losing what yo have on the workpage.  Clicking
on the left one sends the workpage to the back and clicking the right one
brings the workpage back.  These can come in handy if you have to change the
mouse movement control in Preferences for example.

Along the right hand side is the Vertical Scrolling gadget.  Use this to
move up and down the workpage.  If you are at the top and you want to go to
the bottom, click and hold in the gadget block while you move the mouse.
In some modes, Publisher Plus will scroll automatically.  When it doesn't,
you can use this. The scrolling gadget along the bottom will move the
workpage sideways.

The Window Sizing Gadget in the lower right allows you to resize the workpage.
This is another way of accessing the workbench without losing the work
you've done.  Click and hold on the sizing gadget and move the mouse.

The pointer, located on the screen, is where it is all happening.  It is
controlled by the mouse.  You put the pointer on a gadget and then click on
it.  If you were to create a Guide, you would move the pointer to the
position you want to be the upper left corner, click the mouse and move the
pointer down and to the right.

Also indicated on the screen are the vertical and horizontal rulers.
These are connected to the pointer and move with it.  The increments along
the rulers will be in the same measurement that the coordinates are.  If
you selected inches for the coordinates, the rulers will likewise be in
inches.

3-B.  The WorkPage Tools
PublisherPlus has many tools for you to use when creating a page.  Figure
3-C illustrates some of these tools and now we'll se how they are used.
You must experiment with these tools to really begin to understand just
how responsive this program is to your publishing creativity.  Take a
Saturday afternoon, relax, and play.

All type, whether text or headline, must be entered into a guide.  These
are moveable resizable boxes that you create from the Guides menu.  Once
created, type can be entered directly from the keyboard or flowed in from
a word processor.  Move guides by clicking and holding the mouse, moving
the guide and then releasing the button when it is where you want it.  If
the ugide is not big enough to hold all the type, grab the sizing gadget
in the lower right and enlarge the guide.  All guides will have a sizing
gadget as long as the guide is visible.  If you want to see what your page
will look like without the guides, select Hide from the Guides menu.  They
will reappear if you select Show from the same menu or click anywhere on
the page.  Guides will not appear in print.  They disappear as soon as you
select the Print option.

To directly input type from the keyboard, just create a guide, select a
font, select the Type menu option, click inside the ugide and type.  While
you are in the Type Mode, you can click inside any other guide to enter or
modify text in that block.  To pour in a word processor file, create a guide,
select a font, select Get Text from the Place menu, select your text file
from the directory that comes to the screen, and click within the guide.
Any text within a guide can b ereflowed in a different typestyle or
pointsize.  See the procedures for this in the Reflow Text section of the
Menu Options.  When you are finished typing, you must remember to leave
the Type Mode by selecting the Type menu option or striking the Right Amiga
key and the letter T.

Graphics, created in a paint program, do not need guides.  They do come to
the screen with a frame and a sizing gadget, but like the guides, they
disappear when you select print or Hide Guides. Graphics can be accessed
directly from the Place menu by selecting Get Image.  Any picture or
illustration can be resized in PublisherPlus in the same way a guide can
be.  In addition, grapics can be cropped or have portions of them removed
by selecting Crop Image from the Edit menu.  Gadgets will appear in the
upper left and lower right corners and operate the same way the sizing
gadgets do. The difference is that the image does not resize.  It stays
the same size and areas outside the cropping lines will disappear.  This
is great for closing in on a person's face or getting rid of the parts of
a picture that do not matter.  Crop down to just the picture you want to
show and then resize what's left to the size you need. PublisherPlus's
graphics handling abilities are very flexible.  The creative mind can have
a lot of fun!

Horizontal or vertical lines can be drawn very easily.  Select Line from the 
Tool menu, click where you want the line to begin and draw the mouse sideways 
to where you want it to end.  A line drawn in this manner does not have to be 
a solid line.  The Patterns menu offers four different lines, solid, dotted, 
and dashes, etc. with the solid line being the default.

Frames are drawn the same way that guides are. The difference is that you 
cannot flow text into frames and they do not disappear with Hide Guides or 
Print.  Both lines and frames can be drawn with whatever line patterns you 
select.

A Solid is a frame that is filled with black or a pattern. It is drawn the 
same as a frame, but when you lock it in by releasing the mouse, it is filled 
solid.  On documents that will be printed on dot matrix printers, any letters 
or graphics will become white if you draw a black solid box over it.  This is 
the way you make reverses, white letters on a black background.

NOTE:  users of PostScript laser printers will not be able to make reverse 
type in this way.  The solid and the type will both print black.  However, 
interesting effects can be made by using screens and patterns that are light 
enough to show the type.

The Solid menu option is black in default.  If you want to draw a pattern, 
just select a pattern from the Patterns menu and draw the solid Experiment 
with this tool.  You can create an amazing variety of printing devices.  Nice,
eh?  Wait!  The best is yet to come!

You can create your own lines or patterns with the Pattern Editor that loads 
from an icon on the workbench.  Any ine or pattern that you create can be saved
in a special lLne or Pattern directory and called up when you want them.  For
more on the Pattern Editor, see Chapter 4.

3-C. The Menus
Your PublisherPlus offers many options for setting up a page format.  Chapter 2
offered a brief summary of those options and now we'll go into them in much 
more detail.

The Project Menu
If we start from the left on the pull-down menus, PublisherPlus has Project 
commands that deal with starting new pages, opening existing pages, saving 
pages and sending them out to your printer.  The Quit option is also available
here.

New Document
When starting a new document, the document must first be named and a file set 
up for it. Selecting NEW DOCUMENT will present you with a requester.  Be sure 
to save any previous activity if needed.  If no previous work is present, a 
directory requester will be displayed.  The directory is an easy way to store 
and retrieve files that are used in many parts of the program.  All directories
perform similarly.

Along the top of the directory requester is the name of the directory 
indicating the task at hand, in this case Document Directory. Directly beneath
this is the main body of the directory showing the root directory, a list of 
the items on the disk.  A scroll bar to the left allows you to move up and 
down in the list.  Use the arrows to move one line at a time or move the 
slider gadget up and down to move faster.

Beneath the directory list is the Drawer where the present disk drive and/or 
disk name is located.  Click on any file followed by a (dir) for directory.  
That directory's name will appear in the Drawer (next to the drive number and 
disk name) and the contents of it, its sub-directory, will be displayed in the
listing. Beneath the Drawer is the File which will display the name of the specific file when it is selected.  Select a file from the sub-directory by clicking on it in the list area.  The selected file will appear in the File box.  You can also type directly into the Drawer and Fle boxes if you know the exact directory and file names.  Click in each box respectively, backspace over any information there and type.

Along the bottom of the requester are button gadgets for saving, changing 
drives, and cancelling.  The internal drive is always df0: and the external 
drive is df1:  If you have a hard disk drive, (lucky you) click on dh0:  To 
view the contents of any drive, click on its drive number.

To name a new document, insert a data disk in any drive and click on that 
drive number.  At this point you can, if you wish, create a new directory to 
save your document in by clicking in the Drawer box and typing in the new 
directory name next to the drive number and/or disk name.  NOTE:  Never use a 
space in any file name.  Always connect words with a dash (-) or an underline 
(_).  A requester will appear saying that the new directory can't be found 
and asks if it should create a new one.  Click on Proceed.  To store the 
document in an existing directory, select that directory from the list.  To 
save the new document, click in the box next to File and type the document's 
name, hit return and click on Save.

Now the Page Setup requester will appear which will allow you to set the 
parameters for your page.  Set the number of columns text and their sizes at 
this time.  Guides, once set up, can always be re-arranged afterwards. Text 
can be resized or moved.  Nothing done in the first stages of page make-up is 
locked in... carved in stone, as it were.  You always have the option to 
rearrange the page without having to start all over again if the elements do 
not fit the way you want them to.

It is a good idea to have a rough pencil draft of the page before you begin.

New Page
When starting a new page within a document already named, select NEW PAGE 
from this menu. Publisher Plus will present you with a requester that will 
clear the screen of any previous work if you select Proceed.  Be sure to save 
all previous activity before selecting NEW PAGE from the menu.  When you 
select NEW PAGE, the Page SetUp requester will appear. Refer to information 
on this requester described previously in NEW DOCUMENT.

Open
Choosing the OPEN command will call up a previously stored document which you 
can continue working on.  OPEN will call up a requester containing the entire 
disk directory.  You can select the name of the document desired if it is on 
the PublisherPlus disk.  If the document you want is on another disk, you will
have to load that disk into the drive and change the directory.  On a single 
drive system, click in the DRAWER: box and type df0: or the name of the disk 
followed by a colon(:) and hit return.  On a two-drive system, put the data 
disk in the externa drive, click in the DRAWER: box and type df1: and hit 
return.

Scroll down the directory until you see your page file.  Click on it's name 
in the directory.  The file name will appear in the FILE: box.  Click on LOAD.
PublisherPlus will show the page as it was when you last saved it and ready 
for you to continue your work.

Save As
Choose SAVE AS any time you want to save your document to the disk. This 
command will call up the directory requester.

It is a good practice to save your documents on separate data disks. To use 
a separate data disk to store a document, the disk should first be prepared 
using the workbench Initialize menu function.  The procedure to initialize a 
new data disk is explained in detail in your Amiga User's Guide.  You may also
use a separate data disk that has already been initialized and may even have 
some files already stored on it.  Just make sure there is enough space left 
on the disk to save your new document.  When using a separate disk, on a 
single drive system, click in the DRAWER: box and type df0: or the name of 
the disk followed by a colon(:) and hit return. On a two-drive system, put 
the data disk in the external drive, click in the DRAWER: box and type df1: 
or the name of the disk followed by a colon(:) and hit return.

If the document you want to save is a new one, click in the FILE: box, 
backspace or delete anything in it, enter a new file name for your page and 
hit return.  NOTE:  Instead of using the space bar in any file names, use a 
dash (-) or an underline (_).  Saving the file under a new name will have no 
effect on any page you called up under the previous name.

If the page being worked on was called up under the OPEN command, the file 
name it was opened with will still be in the FILE: box.  Just click on SAVE.  
You should save your page often in the course of its composition to recover 
from any problems that might arise...power failures, for example.

Print
Select PRINT to have PublisherPlus send the page to the printer.  Three 
sub-menus are attached to the Print Menu:  Dot Matrix, PostScript, and POst 
Script>>Disk.

Select DotMatrix if a dot matrix printer is attached to your Amiga and it has 
been appropriately selected in Preferences.  A bit-map representation of your 
page will be printed.

Select PostScrip when a PostScript printer is being employed and selected in 
Preferences.  The page will automatically be converted to PostScript language 
and be sent to the printer.

Select PostScrip>>Disk to save the file in PostScript on a disk.  Manuy 
service bureaus and printing houses are now equipped to receive PostScript 
data files for printing on laser printers (300 dots per inch) and 
phototypesetters (635-2540 dpi).  Once on a disk, the data can be sent to the 
service bureau via telephone modem or, if they have an Amiga, the disk can be 
brought there.

Amiga will espond with its ZZs and the printer will start the printing process.
Once PRINT is selected, the computer will not respond to any new commands 
until the page print or save is completed.

Quit
Selecting this command exits PublisherPlus and sends you back to the Amiga 
Workbench.  Be sure to save your work before you QUIT.

The Place Menu
The commands from this menu allow you to select files from other locations 
for placement within your working page.

Get Text
This command, when selected, allows you to call up files from either the 
PublisherPlus disk or any of the Amiga word processors.  PublisherPlus will 
respond with the directory requester for the PublisherPlus disk.  If the text 
file desired is on another disk, put that disk in the disk drive, click on 
the appropriate drive gadget or click in the DRAWER: box and type df0:, or 
the name of the disk followed by a colon and hit return.  On two-drive systems,
put the disk in the external drive, click on the df1:  gadget or type df1:, 
then hit return.

To load the text file, select the file from the new directory by clicking on 
it in the directory.  Check to be sure it appears in the FILE: box and click 
on LOAD.

Text files that have been created by word processing programs are sometimes 
saved on disks with suffixes appended to the name of the file.  PublisherPlus 
requires that Scribble! files be saved with a suffix fo ".doc"; and NotePad 
files be saved with a suffix of ".not" if you wish PublisherPlus to 
automatically accept any style changes such as italics, when you load the file.

A file with any other suffix will be laoded as a plain, or vanilla ASCII flie.
Please note that as of this release, ProWrite, VizaWrite, TextCraft, and 
WodPerfect files should be saved in ASCII or "text only" format.

NOTE FOR SCRIBBLE USERS:  Try to avoid using dot commands (embedded format 
commands) in files that you wish to load into PublisherPlus.  At present, 
they are not supported and will appear as straight text in a text guide.

Remember to create text guides on your page before using this option.  After 
all, you will need somewhere to pour the text you're loading.

Get Image
Select this command to call up any graphics from your paint programs or from 
the PublisherPlus graphics editor. Follow the same procedures used to call up 
text.

Image files that have been created with other programs need only to have been 
saved as IFF files.  The manuals that came with your other programs will tel 
lyou if they store images to IFF files.  It does not matter which IFF format 
they save their files in.  They may be called pictures, brushes, windows, 
drawings, or graphs.  They also may have been saved in low, medium, or 
interlace resolution.  It doesn't matter.  Any IFF image format can be loaded 
by PublisherPlus.

If the picture that is loaded was originally created in color, PublisherPlus 
will change it into a black, gray and white image.  This shading process 
sometimes takes a while to be performed, so be patient.  Remember, if the ZZs 
are on the screen, something is happening inside.

NOTE:  Files called up from other programs will often have suffixes such as .
pic (picture) or .doc (document) following the file name.  Some file names 
will have a ".info" after their names.  These are information files for the 
computer and are not the ones you want to load.

Lock/Unlock
This command will prevent the accidental moving, resizing, or cutting of 
elements on the page while other elements are being worked on.  When this 
command is selected, a sub-menu appears with two choices:  Item and Page.  
Since the two work in different ways, let's take them one at a time.


ITEM:  When you choose this menu item, PublisherPlus will prompt you in the 
title bar to select an item to lock/unlock.  Locking an item prevents you 
from moving, sizing, cutting or copying that item.  If it is a text guide 
which is locked, you can still "Continue from" that guide to another but you 
cannot "Continue to" a locked block.  The Status Menu choice works regardless 
of whether the block is locked or not.

This item works as a toggle on/toggle off switch. If the element you choose 
is unlocked, this menu item will lock it.  If the element is locked, it will 
unlock it. The Status menu choice will indicate if a block is locked or not.

PAGE:  Choosing this menu optin is an all-or-none proposition.  If a page is 
unlocked, PublisherPlus will lock all the elements on the page.  If the page 
is already locked, this menu option will unlock all the elements.  When a 
page is locked, a checkmark will be next to the PAGE sub-menu item.

Suppose you desire to lock all the elements on a page except for a 
self-portrait image which needs cropping.  You could lock each item 
individually except for your similing visage.  A faster way would be to lock 
the whole page and then unlock the image for cropping.

One of the best uses for the locking feature occurs when you are about to 
edit type in the Type Mode.  PublisherPlus does not reflow any locked text 
elements when you enter the Type Mode.  By locking all the text elements 
except for the one you wish to edit, you will save time, especially if you 
have used scaled fonts extensively.

The Guides Menu
This menu allows you to set the guides that you will flow text into from word 
processor files.  You also need these guides to set type directly onto the 
page from the keyboard.

Create
When this option is selected, clicking once on the page will set corner of 
the guide.  Release the mouse button and move the mouse to the opposite 
corner until the guide is the size you need.  Click the mouse button again 
and the guide will be locked in place.  It can be moved by simply clicking 
within the guide and holding the mouse button down while moving the guide 
around.  When you release the mouse button, the guide will lock in place.  
The guide can be resized any time by using the sizing gadget in the lower 
right. Select Create for each guide you want to make.

PublisherPlus will scroll automatically up and down or left and right if the 
pointer hits the window border in any direction.  This automatic scroll 
function is only active while you are creating, changing the size of, or 
repositioning objects on the page.  You can readjust the guide's size after 
it is locked in place by clicking in the sizing gadget and moving the mouse 
in any direction.  Clicking anywhere inside the guide itself will allow you 
to move it around on the page.

Hide/Show
The guides can be hidden anytime by selecting Hide and brought back to the 
page by selecting Show.  This is a simple toggle-on/toggle off arrangement.  
Clicking on the page will also bring them back.

The Edit Menu
This menu contains commands for manipulating the elements on the page, 
reflowing text into guides and cropping graphic images.

Cut
This command will remove and delete any element selected.  Items cut will 
be placed into the Clipboard buffer where it will be stored.  Once an item 
is CUT, it can be pasted somewhere else using the PASTE option.  A CUT or 
COPY-ed item will be eliminated when something else is Cut or Copied later.  
Only the most recent CUT is saved.

COPY
This is similar to CUT, but the selected element will remain where it is.  
Items COPY-ed will be likewise stored in the Clipboard.  It then and may be 
duplicated by PASTE-ing it in other locations.  Again, only the most recent 
COPY is saved.

PASTE
When selected, PASTE will insert the contents of the Clipboard at a new 
location on the present page or another page.  Whatever you PASTE onto the 
page will be in back of anything else at the same location. It may then be 
moved or resized.

SEND TO BACK
When elements on a page overlap one another, they are like pieces of 
transparent paper stacked one upon the next.  With PublisherPlus you can 
only act upon (move, size, delete, copy, etc.) the element at the top of this 
stack.  The Send To Back option, when selected will allow you to move an 
element from the top of the stack to the bottom.  If you cannot work on the 
object you want, select Send To Back from the menu and click on the object 
that is in your way.  It will be sent to the back.  Depending on the number 
of layers on your page, you might have to do this a few times to get to the 
one you want.

REFLOW TEXT
When text is first typed or poured into a blank guide, that text takes on the 
font, style, leading, and justification, etc. currently set in the Attributes 
menu.  If you wish to change any of these attributes after they are in the 
guide, you can do it with this option.  Just change the settings in the 
Attributes menu to your new requirements, select Reflow Text and click in the 
block of text you wish to change.  The text will reflow into the guide with 
the new attributes.

CONTINUE
Each guide that we placed on the screen is meant to be a container into which 
text can be typed or poured.  If that guide takes up all the space allowed 
between the top and the bottom of the alloteed text area, it is a column. 
Sometimes the text we pour into that guide will not all fit.  We will need to 
add another guide to take more of the type.  The Continue option allows you 
to pour a large text file into more than one guide, forming a series of linked
text blocks.

To use this option, first you must select your typestlye attributes, have all 
your guides on the page, and have placed whatever text will fit in the first 
guide.  Select Continue from the Edit menu.  The prompt line in the title bar 
wil first ask "Continue From?"  Click within the guide that you want the text 
to continue from.  Then the prompt asks "Continue To"?  Click anywhere within 
the guide to be filled.  The text in the file, but not yet on the page, will 
pour into the second guide.  Do this until each guide is filled and all your 
text is on the page.

You can insert a new guide into a series of filled guides also.  For example, 
say you want to flow text around a small graphic.  See Illustration 3-D.  
Simply resize the guide (A) back up to a point above the illustration.  
Create and insert a new, narrower guide (B) below it, next to the picture.  
Select Continue, Click within guide A ("from" guide) and again within the new 
guide B ("to" guide).  The inserted guide B will accept type from guide A 
until full and then automatically reflow any excess type into guide C.

This method is also used to continue type from one page to the next.  More on 
this in Chapter 4 under "Linking Pages".

Once this option is used to create a series of linked text blocks, subsequent 
changes to any guide in the series, sizing, moving, etc., will automatically 
cause readjustments in other blocks too.  It is this "fluid" way of arranging 
type blocks that makes PublisherPlus so easy to work with. Experiment with it 
and see how many different ways you can use this very "friendly" device.

CROP IMAGE
Each image that is loaded by PublisherPlus onto a page will always appear 
with a sizing gadget in the lower right corner of its frame.  This gadget can 
be used to rescale, make the image larger or smaller.  Sometimes, you might 
want to use just part of the picture, trim off the sides, top or bottom, etc. 
This would be equivalent to actually cutting off excess parts of a photograph 
with scissors.  PublisherPlus allows you to do that with its Crop Image option
from the Edit menu.  When this option is selected, the graphic will appear with
two sizing gadgets, one in the upper left and one in the lower right.  Use the
upper left gadget to eliminate parts of the picture from the top and left side.
Use the lower right gadget to eliminate parts of the picture from the right and
the bottom.  The excess will be removed but the original image will stay the 
same size.  If you take off too much, simply move the gadgets again until it 
is right.  You do not actually lose cropped off sections until you de-activate
this function by selecting Crop Image a second time.  A check mark will appear
beside the menu item while Crop Image is active and disappear when you 
de-activate it.  Now the graphic can be resized with the normal resizing 
gadget and moved in the usual manner.

Keep in mind that the graphic can be restored to its original state any tie by
re-entering the CROP IMAGE mode and moving the crop gadget out again.

THE TOOLS MENU

LINE
Use this option to draw a straight line either across the page or down.  This 
function's default is a solid line.  You have the option of selecting dotted 
or dash lines also. See the Patterns menu option which follows.  Click at the 
starting point and drag to the end point.  Click again to lock it in.  Lines 
can be resized after they have been locked in by clicking on the resizing 
gadget at the right end or at the bottom of the line.  A line can be moved 
anytime by clicking anywhere on it and holding down the left mouse button 
while moving the mouse.  Release the button to lock the line in again.

FRAME
Use this option to draw frames.  Create frames in the same manner you create 
guides. Visually, a frame looks like a guide.  Unlike a guide, however, it 
cannot be hidden and you cannot flow text into it.  The default frame is a 
solid line.

Select Frame from the Tools menu.  Click in one corner and drag the frame to 
the other corner.  Click again to lock it in. Frames can be resized by using 
the resizing gadget in the lower right and repositioned by clicking within it 
and moving the mouse.  In addition, frames can be drawn with any pattern from 
the Line section of the Patterns menu.  Select the line pattern first, then 
select Frame.

SOLID
Use this tool to create a solid or patterned block.  The default Solid is a 
black box but you can also select a gradient of gray or a pattern from the 
Shade section of the Pattern menu. Then proceed in the same manner as with 
Frame.

TYPE
The previously discussed menu options Get Text and Continue are two ways text 
can be flowed into empty type guides. However if you want to enter text 
directly from the keyboard, or more important , edit text that already exists 
in a text guide, the Type option will allow you to do this.

To enter type directly from the keyboard, select your typestyle, create the 
guide, select Type from the Tools menu, click within the Guide and type in 
your copy.  Characters that you type will be inserted at the cursor and if 
inserting text, any characters to the right of the cursor will be moved 
over.  Note:  while you are typing, any other elements that overlap the 
current text guide may temporarily disappear.  These elements will reappear 
when you finish typ[ing.  Also, regardless of your column selection, while 
typing, all text will appear Left Justified (ragged Right) The column will 
revert to your selection when you finish typing.

For editing copy already in guides, PublisherPlus's Type Mode is always in 
insert mode.  To replace an item, you must first delete it.  You can move the 
pointer to where you want the cursor and click the left mouse ubtton.  If you 
are to the left of the items you want to delete, use the delete (DEL) key.  
If you are to the right, use the back space key. They type in your new copy.  
Text will reflow to the right as you type.

There are certain keys that you can type that will not result in a character 
being placed on the screen but will have an effect on the text attributes 
such as deleting, making type bold, italic or underlined, etc.

  Deleting (DEL) key - This key will delete the character to the right of 
the cursor.  All other characters will be readjusted to allow for the 
deletion.

  Back Space Key - This key will delete the character to the left of the 
cursor.  All other characters will be adjusted to allow for the back space.

  The Cursor Up, Down, Left, or Right Keys - These keys allow you to move 
the cursor position without affecting the text in any way.  Or... you can 
click the mouse pointer where you want the cursor moved to.

  Kern Right (Hold ALT key down and use Right Cursor key) or Kern Left 
(Hold ALT key down and use Left Cursor Key) - These key combinations will 
move the character on the right side of the cursor exactly one pixel (1/120") 
to the left or right for each strike of the cursor key.  This is an 
appropriate function for sliding the A closer to the Y in the word YANKEE in 
a headline for a more unified look.  Hold the ALT key down and strike the 
left cursor key until the letterspacing looks equal to the rest of the word.

Tabs are shown in the Type Mode as a special character(>>).  When you leave 
the Type Mode, the actual spacing selected for that element will be displayed.

Since all characters appear flush left (ragged right) in the Type Mode, 
PublisherPlus indicates a change to another alignment, such as centered, 
with a pair of characters which only show up in the Type Mode.  They will not 
appear when not in Type Mode or on the printed page.  These characters are:

    %c - Centered
    %r - Flush Right/Ragged Left
    %l - Flush Left/Ragged Right
    %j - Justified

Other features are included that give PublisherPlus the power of word 
processors.  When you are in the Type Mode, you may notice that most of the 
menu options are 'ghosted' or not selectible.  The only live options, beside 
Type, of course, are Cut, Copy & Paste (if there is something in the 
Clipboard) from the Edit menu, and all the items except Font in the 
Attributes menu.

The Cut and Copy choices allow you to cut or copy a section of text from one 
guide and paste it into another.  To select a section of text for cutting or 
copying, position the cursor at the starting point of the text, press down 
the left mouse button and move the mouse cursor to the right until you reach 
the end point.  Release the button.  You will notice that the selected text 
will appear in reverse video and will remain that way when you relese the 
mouse button.  At this point, choose Cut if you want to remove the text from 
its present location or Copy if you want it left there.  In either case, the 
selected text will be placed in the Clipboard buffer for Pasting elsewhere.  
When something is in the Clipboard, the Paste option becomes active.  Move 
the text cursor to the point where you want the text inserted and select 
Paste.  The text will be inserted there and all following text will flow 
down.  Anything in the Clipboard can be Pasted many times.  Remember, if you 
have just Cut or Copy-ed something and you want to Paste it somewhere else, 
do it before you Cut or Copy something else.  Only the last Cut or Copy is 
kept im memory.

Working with Attributes within the Type Mode will have visible effects on the 
text.  For example, if you want a word made Bold, Publisher Plus will insert 
an unseen control code before that word.  Every word following that point 
will become bold until it encounters another control code or it reaches the 
end of the guide.  You must select Plain at the point you want to resume 
plain text. The same is true for italics or underline.

For alignment changes, a % followed by a letter is shown, as noted above.

While you are adding text to a line that already has text in it, you may 
notice that the screen does not update beyond the current paragraph.  To 
provide for rapid typing, PublisherPlus waits for one of the following events 
before completely updating the current text element:

    a mouse click which moves the cursor
    a press of an up or down cursor key
    a press of the Escape key
    moving to another guide
    leaving Type Mode

PublisherMode stores its text files in purse ASCII format (8 bit).  This 
means that you can edit PublisherPlus with your word processor or editor.  
PublisherPlus inserts the following symbols into the document if you have 
used any of the style change options:
    %> - Right kerning of one point
    %< - Left kerning of one point
    %r - Flush right mode
    %l - Flush left mode
    %c - Center mode
    %j - Justified mode
    %b - Bold text
    %u - Underlined text
    %n - Plain (Normal) text
    %i - Italicized text

On a standard 512K Amiga, text files from Scribble or NotePad can be up to 
57,000 bytes.  If you saved your text in ASCII such as might come from 
TextCraft in text-only format, files can be up to 109,000 bytes.  On an Amiga 
with a megabyte expansion board, files can be up to 309,000 bytes.

Keyobard Equivalents:  Certain pull-down menu options have keyboard entered 
equivalents which can be found by pulling down the menu and seeing if there 
is an Amiga Key and a code letter immediately to the right of the option's 
name.  These key combinations are shortcuts.  You can use them rather than 
having to use the equivalent pull-down menu selections when working with some 
functions in PublisherPlus.

When entering or editing text, some of these 'control' keys alter the text to 
the right of the cursor position.  For example, to italicize one word in a 
sentence of plain character words, hold down the Right Amiga key and type I 
before the word, type the word, then hold down the Right Amiga key and type P 
to get back to plain type.

    Plain Type - (Hold Right Amiga Key down and strike P)  This key 
    combination will turn off the italic, boldface or underlined mode and 
    return you to the basic character set.  Plain type is the default 
    setting.  Other settings will have to be entered as you go.

    Bold Type - (Hold Right Amiga Key down and strike B) This key combination 
    will turn on the boldface character set.

    Underlined Type - (Hold Right Amiga Key down and strike U) This key 
    combination will underline what you type.

    Italic Type - (Hold Right Amiga Key down and strike I) This key 
    combination will italicize what you type.

To change from one character set to another, say from Bold Type to Plain 
Italics, you must first go back to Plain (Right Amiga Key - P) and the 
italicize the Plain (Right Amiga Key - I).  Otherwise you will get Bold 
Italics.  Simply depress the right Amiga key and type PI, not just I.

    Align type to the Left (Ragged Right) - (Hold Right Amiga Key down and 
    strike L) This control code will align all type within the guide, 
    following the control code insertion point, to the left margin.

    Align type to the Center - (Hold Right Amiga Key down and strike the 
    equal key [=])  This key combination will center all type within the 
    guide, following the control code insertion point.

    Align type to the Right (Ragged Left) - (Hold Right Amiga Key down and 
    strike R)  This key combination will align all type within the guide, 
    following the control code insertion point, to the right.

    Justify type - (Hold Right Amiga Key down and strike J)  This key 
    combination will align all type within the guide to the left and right 
    margins. Spaces will be added between words to fill out the lines.

All type following the control code insertion point will continue to be 
controlled by that code until the end of the guide or until PublisherPlus 
finds another contol code entered further along.  Editing takes place in only 
one guide at a time. For example, if you decide to take all plain text and 
make it bold in four text guides, you must enter the appropriate control code 
in each guide individually.  Use the Attributes pull-down menu to alter a 
whole guide at a time.

Note that all these key combinations use 'invisible'.  They will not be 
displayed and wil lseem to have no effect on the text while you are in the 
Type mode. All these effects will be apparent when you exit the type mode 
however.  To exit the Type mode, use Reflow Text from the Edit menu.

The Display Menu
This menu allows you to see a full page view whenever you want to review your 
progress.  It also lets you access the Grid and Ruler and set the units of 
measurement you want to use on them.

Full Page
Use this command to view the entire page.  When selected the full page view 
will appear at the right side of the screen.  You might not be able to read 
everything but it will be represented and will give you an idea of the page's 
appearance. Click within the full page view oncye and it will return you to 
the work page.

Set Units
There are three measurement aids available to you on the PublisherPlus 
window:  the X and Y coordinates displayed in the upper right corner of the 
window which tell you at all times the exact location of the mouse pointer 
relative to the upper left corner of the page; the Rulers option which 
displays a horizontal and vertical calibrated line intersecting at the mouse 
pointer; and the Grid option which display a calibrated grid over the entire 
page.  Each of these measurement aids can be calibrated to your preference 
using the Set Units option.

This command calls up a requester in the center of your screen.  Use it to 
set the measurements in Inches, Millimeters, or Picas by clicking in the 
square gadget next to your preference.  PublisherPlus is preset in inches but 
these can be changed in this requester.  The X and Y coordinates, the Grid 
and the Ruler will all work in the units you select.

The Grid Spacing gadgets let you type in the distance you want between the 
ines in the Grid. Set the Grid Spacing in the Horizontal and Vertical boxes 
by whatever unit of measurement you chose to work in, in the gadget selection 
above. This means if you chose to work in inches, set the measurements in 
these boxes in inches also.  If you chose Picas above, you must set your 
distances in picas too. When you have made your selections, click in the 
Proceed box.

Show/Hide Grid
The Grid is a set of evenly spaced horizontal and vertical fine dotted lines 
that you can use to line up the elements on your page. The distance between 
the lines can be set in inches, millimeters, or picas with the Set Units 
option above.  Simply select Show Grid to make it visible and Hide Grid to 
make it disappear.

Show/Hide Ruler
The Rulers appear as two calibrated lines, one horizontal and one vertical, 
which intersect at the point on the mouse pointer.  You can also use these to 
align and measure your page elements.  The calibrations on the rulers are 
always displayed relative to the top of the page for the vertical ruler and 
relative to the left side of the page for the horizontal ruler.  The 
calibration marks are on the rulers are determined by the units you select 
with the Set Units menu option. If you select inches, the calibrations will 
be marked off at each pica (or 1/6th of an inch).  If you select millimeters, 
there wll be calibration mark every 5 millimeters.

The Patterns Menu
This menu is divided into two sections, LInes and Shades.  If you are going 
to draw a Line or a Frame on your page, select a line pattern from the 
selection displayed.  The defalut is a solid line one pixel thick.  You may, 
however, select from a variety of dotted and dash lines available from the 
Line menu.  To draw a Line or a Frame with other than a solid line, select 
your choice first from the Line menu, then select Line or Frame from the 
Tools menu.

The Shades area of this menu displays a variety of different shades of gray 
and patterns available.  Solid gradients range from 10% to 100%.  The default 
pattern is a solid black (100%).  To draw anything other than a solid black 
box, select a shade of gray or a pattern from the Shades menu and then select 
Solid from the Tools menu.

Draw Lines, Frames, and Solids in the same manner as you created the text 
guides.  See Lines, Frames, and Solids in the Tools section of this chapter.

You can also create your own Lines and Patterns.  See Chapter 4 for the 
section on the Patterns Editor.

The Lines and Frames that you create on the Patterns Editor can be loaded 
into the appters menu for your work session by selecting Load Line or Load 
Shade from the Patterns menu. The directory requestor will appear.  In the 
Drawer box, type df0:lines for the Line directory or df0:shades for the Shade 
directory.  The selected directory will appear in which all the lines or 
shades stored on the disk are listed.  Click on one in the directory, see 
that it appears in the File box and then click load.  Your selected line or 
shade will appear in the space on the Patterns menu just above the Load Line 
or Load Shade option.

The Attributes Menu
This menu controls the way the type will look on your page.  Large, small, 
light, italic, etc.  This series of menu options allow you to change font 
attributes either before or after the text is entered on the page.

Fonts
Each text guide on your page can contain one font and size.  Since you can 
have an infinite number of guides on a page, there is no limit to the number 
of fonts you can use.  Each guide can contain as many typestyle changes as 
needed.

Select this option to view the typestyle that is loaded or to change to 
another typestyle.  The name and pointsize of the present typestyle is noted 
in color in the block just below the word FONT.  To change to a new font, 
select Font.  This will bring up the Font directory for the PublisherPlus 
program disk you are using.  When you have the directory on the screen, 
select the font you want to use by clicking on its name in the directory.  
That name should then flow into the Drawer box following FONTS.  At that 
point, the directory will display the sizes available for that particular 
typestyle. Select the size you wish to use by clicking on it in the directory.
This will make that size appear in the File box.  If the size you want is not 
listed, it will have to be scaled.  Type the size you want in the FILE: box.  
When this is done, click in the LOAD gadget.  The requester will disappear 
and the font and size you requested will be loaded.  If it needs to be scaled, 
a requester will state this.

A font size must be an integer and can be as small as 2 points.  Its upper 
size is limited by chip memory, currently around 130 points.

Creating a new font size takes an average of three seconds, so a page with 
many different scaled fonts may be time consuming.  There are two ways to 
conserve time: through the judicous use of the lock feature; and reflowing 
text blocks with scaled fonts after you have set up the page layout.

From this point on, until you load another font, any type you input from the 
keyboard or pour in from the word processor will be in that typeface and size.
If you want to change the font afterwards, simply select a new font using this
same option and reflow the text using the Reflow Text option on the Edit menu.

If PublisherPlus does not find a font on a previously stored document, it will
default to 8 point Topaz but keep the leading that was stored.  If you suspect
that this has happened, choose Status from the Attributes menu and point to 
the suspect element.  If the requester says Topaz 8, you will need to reflow 
the elements with the font you really want.

This is the standard procedure for using fonts that are on the PublisherPlus 
program disk.  If you want to use fonts other than the ones provided on the 
program disk, refer to Chapter 5 - Loading Fonts from Other Sources.

Plain, Bold, Underlined and Italics
Changing styles within a typeface is very simple.  Select the style option 
you wish and reflow the text with the Reflow Text option on the Edit menu.  
Watch the checkmarks on the menu because if you go into bold and then change 
your mind and want plain italics, you'll have to select Plain first and then 
Italics.

If you are inserting text within a guide and you turn on a new style option 
while typing, be sure to turn it off again when you are through.  Otherwise, 
all the text in the guide following your insertion will take on the new 
attributes too.  More than one of these style selections can be used within a 
guide.

To change the style for a whole text guide, just select the new style and 
reflow the text (see Reflow Text under the Edit menu).

Leading
This menu option allows you to add space between the lines of text copy.

Leading, pronounced like pencil lead, is the distance from the baseline of 
one line of characters to the baseline of the next and is measured in points.
Leading gets its name from the actual insertion of thin strips of lead between
rows of type to space out text, thereby making it easier to read and sometimes
filling out a page if the copy is too short.

Leading is usually set for you when you load a font, i.e., at 10 point 
typeface will be set on 10 points of leading.  It is not unusual for extra 
leading to be added for clarity or space requirements.  10 point type set on 
12 points of leading is pretty common.  The value you cahnge to should always 
be greater than the point size of the type you are using.  If the value is 
less, the letters will overlap each other.  On the other hand, you can add too
much leading also.  It's a good idea not to lead out a story more than 1/3 of
the pointsize of the typeface you're using.  If you're working with 10 point, 
don't lead it out more than 13.

To change the leading within the edit mode, select this option and a requester
will appear where you can enter your new value.  Any text following this 
leading selection will have the new leading.

To change the leading for a whole guide, just select the new value and reflow 
the text (see Reflow Text under the Edit Menu).

Tabs
The Tab menu option sets the number of blank spaces represented by the Tab key.
To change the number of spaces that the cursor moves when the tab key is 
struck, select this option from the Attributes menu.  When the reqester 
appears, type in the new Tab value. Any time the Tab key is struck, following 
this change, the cursor will move to the new Tab position.

Microspace
The Microspace option allows for the control of the space between letters.  
It only has an effect on text within a guide that is set to Justified.  When 
tex tis being justified, it aligns itself to both sides of the column.  
Usually any space needed to filll out a line is made up by enlarging the 
spaces between words. This is not always the best way. Sometimes the spaces 
are too large and the line looks awkward.  Microspacing allows you to add 
space between letters evenly.  The larger the number, the more space will be 
inserted.  Each microspace is equal to 1/120 inch.

Left, Center, Right or Justified
This set of menu options allow you to change the alignment of text within the 
text guides.

Left aligns all text to the left, which leaves the right margin uneven 
(Flush Left/Ragged Right).  This is the default setting. If you do not change 
this menu optin, type will always align itself to the left margin.

Center aligns all text to the center of the guide, which makes both margins 
uneven (Ragged Right/Ragged Left).

Right aligns all the text to the right, which makes the left margin uneven 
(Flush Right/Ragged Left).

Justified aligns all the text to both margins by adding spacing between the 
words to fill out the line (Flush Left and Right).

To change this setting for a whole guide, select a new one and select Reflow 
Text from the Edit menu. If you are editing text within a guide, text will 
reflow with the new attributes following the new command's insertion.

Status
The Status menu option is a way of showing pertinent information about each 
element that you create on  your page.  When Status is selected, Select 
Elements For Status will appear at the top of the screen. Click within the 
element you want information on.  A requester will appear that shows: element 
type; whether it is locked or unlocked; the name of the element; its location 
and deimensions shown in the measurement units selected.  This information is 
for images, but it is common for all elements.  The original color image file 
name will also be given.

For text elements, additional information on leading, tabs, microspacing, 
font type and size, style, the total text file length in characters, alignment,
and the number of characters in the text guide.

For Lines, Frames and Solids, Status will also provide a sample.

To exit the requester, click on Proceed.

The Paging Gadget
Multiple pages can be created simply with PublisherPlus.  The gadget that lets 
you move from page to page is located near the top right corner of the 
PublisherPlus window just to the right of where the X and Y coordinates are 
displayed.  When you first load the program, this gadget displays the number 1
in it.  The number in the gadget always reflects the page that is currently 
displayed in the window.  To change the display to show another page, simply 
click once on the page gadget and a requester will be displayed in the center 
of the window.  Type the page number of the page you want to work with into 
the space provided on the requester and then click on Proceed.  PublisherPlus 
will now load and display the page you chose if it has already been created.  
If the page number you requesterd was not previously created, a new blank 
page will appear in the window.  Note that as you change pages, the number 
displayed in the Page gadget will reflect the current page number you are 
working on.

Chapter 4
4-A.  Refining Your Publishing Talents
The art of computer publishing contains some of the same pitfalls that the 
more conventional publishing systems have. Computer publishing just makes it 
easier.  The intent is still the same.  You want what you have written to be 
read.  And the big unknown in this industry is just how much your reader wants
to read what you have to say. The best advice that anyone in the business can 
give you is...

A.  Consider the fact that first, the reader will scan the easy stuff...the 
headlines and the pictures.  This is your first and sometimes your last chance
to get his attention.

B.  Make it easy for the reader to grasp the essence of what you have to say.
Make headlines short but informative, just enough to get him interested and 
curious engough to want to look further.

C.  Keep your format simple and uniform throughout.  Don't change from three 
columns of type to two unless you have a good reason.  Try to select a column 
width roughly twice the width of the lower case (a-z) of the type size you 
will use.  A column too wide will tire the reader. A column too narrow makes 
the reader scan too many lines  Don't make the reader have to search for the 
next block of type; have it easily accessible and preferably adjoining the 
previous block.

D.  Be careful of the number of typestyles you use.  use on typestyle for all 
the headlines and vary them if needed by making some italic, rather than 
using another typestyle.  Use the plain version of a text typeface for all 
text copy and reserve the use of italics and boldface for word enhancements 
and special needs such as captions.

E.  Don't put form over function.  I'm reminded of a clock on the wall in a 
restaurant I used to frequent.  It was made to look like the bottom of a 
frying pan. Across the face of the clock was a screen-printed three color 
version of the American eagle, complete with a blazing red shield and a red, 
white and blue banner.  Attractive?  Patriotic?  Sure!  But you could not 
tell what time it was.  You could not see the hands against the background.  
Don't make your publication so decorative that it scares the reader away. 
Try to use the items that have to be on the page creatively... but keep it 
simple. Add borders and decorations sparingly, not to clutter but to enhance. 
To quote a famous architect, "Less is more!"

The point is, there are no rules in this printing thing, but you have to be 
careful to remember always that whatever you print... you want read.

4-B.  Aligning Text Around Graphics
Sometimes in page make-up you might want to go from a wide column to a 
narrower column in order to allow room for a graphic.  This is not an unusual 
problem in typesetting and PublisherPlus has an easy way of handling it.  
Refer to Illustration 4-A as we discuss this matter.

We will allow room at the top of the column for a large initial letter 
introducing a column of text that will run the total depth of the page.  
Naturally, the large initial letter will take up space and the text it leads 
into will have to be set narrower than the total column width.  Beneath the 
initial letter, the column width will increase and allow the text to flow 
underneath it.  Halfway down the column, because we never do things once when 
we're demonstrating something, we'll put in a picture that also will take up 
a chunk out of the column.

Rather than making a big deal out of this, simply show the Grid so we'll have 
something to align elements to.  Set the Grid Attributes to allow a two-inch 
space between lines.  At the top of the column, create a guide (a) large 
enough to hold a large letter.  Enter the letter via the keyboard, resize the 
guide until it is just big enough to hold the letter but not so small the 
letter disappears, and move it to the left side of the Grid.  Create a new 
guide (b) beside it that extends right to the two inch grid line and down 
enough to extend just a little below the initial letter.  Now create another 
guide (c) that goes across the entire two inches and extends down three 
inches.  Get your graphic (d) from the file and place it along the right side 
of the column. Size it down so that it takes up less than half the total 
column width.  Now create another guide (e) just to the left of the graphic 
and extend it down just below the graphic.  Create another guide (f) two 
inches wide right to the bottom of the column.  Adjust and align all the 
guides within the gridliens.  Call up your text file and flow it into the top 
guide (b), use the Continue menu option to flow the rest of the text into the 
remaingin guides, from one to the next, until they are all full.  See how 
easy it is to be creative with PublisherPlus?

4-C.  Linking Text From Page to Page
If you are writing a newsletter, magazine, or other booklet type document, it 
is sometimes helpful to continue articles from a column on one page to a 
column on another.  To do this, create guides on each of the pages you want 
the articles to continue to.  Load the text file using the Get Text menu 
option.  Pour the text into the first column of the article.  After it pours 
and fills the first column in the series, select the Continue menu option.  
When you are prompted to select which column to CONTINUE FROM?, click on the 
column you just poured.  Next select Page option and go to the page on which 
you want to continue the article.  While you are still prompted to select the 
column CONTINUE TO?, click within the guide in which you want the type flowed.
  The remainder of the article will now pour into this guide.  If the next 
  guide has not been created at this point, you can select GUIDES from the 
  CREATE menu, make your new guide, and then finish the CONTINUE operation 
  by clicking within the new guide.

This same paging option can be used to COPY items from one page and PASTE 
them on another or CUT from one page and PASTE on another.

4-D.  The Pattern Editor
One tool that you creative types will enjoy is the Pattern Editor.  Available 
from the workbench, the Pattern Editor allows you to create the very lines and
patterns that you use on PublisherPlus pages. Maybe there's a limit to the 
number of ways you can make a line...from dots to dashes...to solid, but you 
can create quite a few.  When you add the hundreds of patterns you can form 
yourself with this tool, it is a program in itself.

All lines and patterns can be saved in special directories by names of your 
choosing and called up easily for use on your pages.  Fun to use and 
definitely useful!

Click twice on the Pattern Editor icon in the workbench.  A requester will 
come up that lets you decide whether you want to create a line or a pattern. 
Lines are simle.  Let's try one.  Select Line Border.  A window will appear 
that will shows the line enlarged - with 16 adjoining blocks.  clicking in 
those blocks will create the line.  Fill them all in and you will have a 
solid line.  Fill every other block will form a fine dotted line...and so 
forth.  If the block is white, clicking in it will color it.  If the block 
is colored, clicking in it will turn it white.  Simple!  To the right of this 
row of blocks is the viewing area where it will appear on the PublisherPlus 
workpage in actual size.  If you want to save a line you have created, simply 
click within the File Name box and type the name to save under and click in 
the Save to Disk box. If you want, you can save it to a special lines 
directory by typing df0:lines/name chosen.  Thereafter it can always be 
called up directly by this name in the program directory.

The Patterns Editor handles patterns the same way.  The difference is that 
you are covering a larger area.  The patterns you create in the 128 boxes 
in the square are repeated horizontally and vertically to any size you make 
the Block on PublisherPlus workpage.  Save your patterns either by just a 
name or you can save them into the patterns directory for easier access.  
Click in and type df0:patterns/name chosen in the File Name box and click 
in the Ave to Disk.

The Clear Pattern box turns all the blocks white so you can start again.

The only pulldown menu options are Info, which tells you who we are and Quit 
which send syou back to the workbench.

A very simple program but one you can get a lot of use out of.

4-E. Hardware Options
After you have worked with your PublisherPlus program to create a few 
documents, you may want to add a few refinements to your system to further 
take advantage of your new publishing abilities.  PublisherPlus was designed 
to work and work well on a single drive Amiga with a minimum of 512K RAM 
memory. However you should be aware that as you work more and more with the 
computer and the program, certain annoyances can pop up that another piece of 
hardware can alleviate.  It all depends on what you have to do, how long you 
have to do it in...and, of course, your 'annoyance threshold'.

You might find working with a single disk drive a tad tedious.  Adding an 
Amiga external disk drive is not an expensive item if it saves you time and 
trouble...and disk swapping can be a pain on occasion.  If money is no option,
 you might even find that a hard disk will vastly improve your publishing 
 speed and file handling capabilities.  There is a splended array of Amiga 
 hardware and compatible third-party developed hardware available to enhance 
 your system with more becoming available all the time.  PublisherPlus can 
 work with any Amiga compatible peripherals.

You might also consider a RAM expansion card. These cards come in sizes from 
512K to 9 megs, and may allow you to create very complex pages that might 
require more than the basic 512K system.

Consult your Amiga dealer for more information on these products.

4-F.  Printer Problems
As it has been often stated in this manual, PublisherPlus will work with any 
printer listed in the printer section of the Preferences menu.  Any printer 
problems are usually solved long before you try to set up and print a page 
with Publisher Plus.  Usually one already has an Amiga with a functioning 
printer attached.  All you have to do is change the Preferences on the 
PublisherPlus program disk to the same settings as on your workbench disk and 
other programs you have used.

People buying a new Amiga and trying to use their old printer with it are 
sometimes faced with a problem.  Their printer is not listed in Preferences.  
Many printers on the market today will work on an Amiga if they can 'emulate' 
a printer that is listed in Preferences.  For example, Epson printers are 
listed in Preferences and a lot of other brands can be set up so the Epson 
printer driver will drive them.  All you have to do in that case is set up 
your printer to emulate an Epson. The manual that came with your printer 
should tell you whether it can be done and how to do it.

Occasionally a new printer driver will have to be written.  With the 
exception of the PostScript printer driver that came with your PublisherPlus, 
Northesast Software Group does not make printer drivers.  Should you have a 
problem making your printer work on an Amiga, your best recourse is through 
your Amiga dealer.  He will be equipped to advise you on your printer's 
requirements.
