SCENARIO
--------
The scene:some time in the future in a Galaxy near the Milky way,not
too far from Mars - and things are far from sweet.For space is littered
with the wrecks of radioactive spacecraft and as a member of the
Def-Con Division (which sounds better than it is),your job is to nip on
board and explode the old crates.Then your boss hands you OPERATION
G2, a ship full of contraband medical supplies worth a
fortune.Unfortunately,its protected by a band of corps known as the
Simskin Protection Droids,who don`t bother to ask questions they simply
waste you.
Viewed in the first person perspective,this exclusive demo published by 
Psygnosis,combines strategy with arcade action.
There is a time limit of approximately 7 minutes to complete the
mission - thats if you don`t run out of energy first.
The idea is to explore the corridors while collecting extra pick-ups
such as keycards which enable you to unlock doors to explore the ship
further while simultaneously blowing away the enemy droids.
The first thing you need to do is pickup the pistol (you may find a
shotgun later on),but be careful,you only have a limited ammount of
ammo.You can operate the gun with either the left or right mouse
button.(perhaps the right hand one works best because you use the left
to direct yourself around the ship.
Many of the doors on board are locked;you can open them either by
travelling over pressure plates or collecting key cards which you can
pick up off the floor for later use.
The pressure plates are circular and sometimes open or close doors
elsewhere in the complex - they can also spin you 180 degrees without
you realising it.You may have to spend some time experimenting.
Other pickups include extra ammo,food and shields.
Can you rid the ship of aliens in the allotted time?
