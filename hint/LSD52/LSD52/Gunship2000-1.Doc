First is the Technical Supplement, then the Key Control Summary Card
and last comes the Instruction Manual...



Gunship 2000 Technical Supplement for Commodore Amiga computers
Copyright (c) 1994 MicroProse Software. Inc.                 


CONTENTS
~~~~~~~~
Your Gunship 2000 should contain a manual, this technical supplement, a quick
key guide, four disks and a registration card.


REQUIRED EQUIPMENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Computer:

This Simulation requires a Commodore Amiga with AGA Chipset and at least 1 Mb
of RAM. If you intend to install the simulation onto a hard disk, 1.5 Mb of
RAM is required.

Controls:

Gunship 2000 can be run entirely from the keyboard, with mouse and keyboard,
or with joystick and keyboard. An analog joystick greatly improves the "feel"
and realism, and is therefore strongly recommended.

Disk Drives:

Gunship 2000 can be installed onto 3.5" floppy disks. You will need a set of
four blank disks for this. However, it works best if installed onto a hard 
disk drive.


INSTALLATION CONCEPTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Important: Gunship 2000 should not be played from the disks enclosed. You must
either copy the original disks onto backup floppy disks or use the install
program to create a subdirectory on your hard disk. If you attempt to play
from the disks enclosed the will become permanently altered as they are
updated as the simulation runs. Please do not use any commercially 
(or otherwise) available copy program - use the one provided for you on the
disk. No other copy program will work, and MicroProse will not accept
responsibility for any damage caused by copying programs except the one
provided.

Installing on Floppy Disks:

Gunship 2000 has no disk copy protection. Insert your original Gunship 2000
Disk 1 and switch on your computer. A screen will appear which allows you to
copy your original disks. Please follow any on-screen prompts. You will need
a set of blank disks.

Installing on Hard Disk: 

Boot up your hard disk as normal and insert Gunship 2000 Disk 1. Open this
disk and double-click on the "INSTALL" icon. Please follow any on-screen
prompts. A drawer labelled "GS2000" will be created on your hard disk, 
containing all necessary files.


RUNNING GUNSHIP 2000
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Loading from Floppy Disk:

If your computer has KickStart in ROM, turn off your computer and insert your
backup Disk 1. Power up the computer, and the program will auto-load. If your
computer does not have KickStart in ROM, load the KickStart as normal, insert
your backup Disk 1 at the Workbench prompt, and the program will auto-load.
Please follow any on-screen prompts requesting disk changes.

Hard Disk:

Boot up your hard disk as normal. Open the "GS2000" drawer and double-click on
the "Gunship" icon.


SAVING GAMES
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hard Disk:

Your games will be saved to the drawer containing Gunship 2000.

Floppy Disk: Your games are saved onto your "backup" game disks. You don't
need an additional save-game disk.


MODIFICATIONS TO THE PROGRAM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Replays:

In programming the Amiga version of Gunship 2000, we were faced with difficult
choices; we knew that it would be very difficult to include all the features
from the IBM PC version and maintain the 'speed' of the 3D and include all the
features. We are pleased to say that we have kept the screen update rate very
high; unfortunately, memory restrictions have meant the loss of the "Replay"
facility.

Page 81 of the Manual explains events after the completion of a mission. After
receiving any decorations you have earned you will return to the brigade
headquarters. Please ignore references to "Mission Replays" in the manual.

Configuration Screen:

When in flight, Pause the game and press the "C" keys to access the 
configuration screen. This allows you to alter yoru method of control, and to
set the detail level. Increasing detail may delay screen updates, and is 
initially set on 'medium detail', which is fine for basic Amigas. If you have
a powerful machine, increase the detail level. If you want a faster game,
reduce the detail level.

Version Updates:

The latest notes regarding this program, additions, revisions etc. can be
found on Disk 1, in an ASCII file named "READ.ME". You can read the file using
standard AmigaDOS commands e.g. "Type", "More" (These utilities can be found
on the WorkBench disk).


PROBLEMS?
~~~~~~~~~
In the vast majority of cases a loading problem is not due to faulty software,
but either an incorrect loading procedure or a hardware fault.

Please ensure that the loading instructions have been correctly executed. The
most common hardware failures are due to a misalignment of the heads in the
disk drive. Such faults may be detected by loading the game on another
computer. (Either use a friend's machine or ask the software store from which
the game was purchased to test it).

Alternatively, a virus may have been transferred into your hardware from
another piece of software. Pirated copies of games are an incredibly common
source of viruses. It always pays to own original software.

In the unlikely event of a software fault, please return the complete package,
with your receipt, to the place of purchase. MicroProse regret that goods
cannot be replaced unless bought from the company directly.

If you have any difficult whilst loading Gunship 2000, or need help whilst
running the Simulation, MicroProse will be happy to help you on the Customer
Services Helpline. Please ring UK (0666) 504399, Mon-Fri 0900-1700 hrs. Have a
pen and paper handy when you call.


CONTROLS
~~~~~~~~
A note about Selectors:

Throughout the manual and technical supplement you will find references to
selectors. A selector is a button or key which you must press to make a choice
or initiate an action, and vary according to the method of control being used.

                          KEYBOARD         JOYSTICK         MOUSE
                          ~~~~~~~~         ~~~~~~~~         ~~~~~
Selector #1               Return key       Fire Button      Left Button
Selector #2               Backspace Key    Backspace Key    Right Button

A note about keyboards:

If you need to hold down the "alt" or "shift" key with another key, make sure
to press the "alt" or "shift" key first. Keep it down while pressing the other
key, the release the "alt" or "shift" key last. Otherwise, you may get erratic
keyboard results.

                                 INTRODUCTION


THE MISSION

All around you in the TOC sit the other squadron flight commanders; tension
covers the area like a blanket. As you rip open your orders, the anticipation
grabs at your gut, but you already know the score. No breaks here; your flight
always pulls the tough assignments. Another SEAD mission deep into enemy
territory. Those fast movers need you to clear the way again. Doesn't the TF
know that your luck can't hold out forever? Sure, your success rate is the
highest in the squadron, but...

You gaze at the mission map. The Primary is 20 klicks behind enemy lines -
they must be kidding. Your boys best be sharp tonight. Better get over to the
armorer's tent. At least you'll get first choice on ordnance; being number one
does have benefits. Apaches and Kiowa Warriors are on tap tonight. Plenty of
Hellfires and Mark 261 MPSM rockets to go 'round. No need for any AA loads
this trip. Is the opposition the only ones smart enough not to fly during
these conditions? The S2 better be right on this one.

You climb into the rear seat of your Apache. You've never quite understood the
feeling, but the closeness and tight fit is somehow comforting. You pre-flight
the cockpit switches. You could run through this in your sleep, but SOP says
otherwise - everything must be by the book. As you light off the APU your
CP/G gives the thumbs-up. The other four pilots in the flight are looking to
you for the sign. Although it's pitch black, you can still read the concern on
their faces; but, they're good to go. Time to get these birds airborne. You
key the commo switch, "Wind'em up!"

Three-quarters of the way there and no sightings. Just a milk run so far; lady
luck must still be along for the ride. This is too good to last. You're
getting a bit green-eyed from the glow of the FLIR's eyepiece, but without it
you'd quickly get close and personal with some unforeseen hillside. Skimming
the tree tops at 120 knots is quite a rush, but any kind of altitude spells
nothing but bad news.
                                                                  [Page   8]

The MFD indicates that waypoint 3 is just ahead; time to assume attack
positions. Captain Arthur in Zulu-4 will lead the light section; as usual, the
heavy section is with you - Zulu-1. Your call goes out, "Light section break
right, heavy section left on me, weapons free." "Roger, breaking now," replies
Zulu-4.

The APR-39 is starting to chirp, and those blips on the threat display
difinitely aren't friendlies. "Jack, select MPSM," you call to your front-
seater over the ICS. "All units, prepare to unmask. Engage as they Bear."

As you come up, the TADS paints a pretty picture of the target. There they are
big as you please - Sa-13's and 'Zoos'. But this is no time to admire the
scenery, there's work to be done. "Targets bearing 335!", calls Jack not all
too calmly. "Weapons in constraints, MPSM away!" you respond with equal gusto.

The rocket sub-munitions burst on the target with a tremendous white flash,
followed by a series of secondary explosions. "Those guys are toast!" you hear
Jack call out to no one in particular. So much for radio integrity.

You've certainly got their attention now. The threat display is going wild;
enemy units are popping up at every clock position. The APR's radar warning
indicator light turns a solid, glaring red as the klaxon blares in your
headset. You're being tracked!

"Jammer active, chaff out! Peg him, Jack!" you call out while quickly pushing
the Apache down and to the right. You glance over just as the enemy missile
explodes harmlessly in the chaff cloud. "I'm on him. Switching to Hellfire,"
Jack responds.  A short flash, and the Hellfire reaches out to find its
taarget. Jack's head is glued to his display. He'll keep the target locked in
the sight until the Hellfire impacts. A bright light blooms off to the left as
the target evaporates from view. Scratch another one!

The ground explodes as rockets and Hellfires slam into the hapless targets.
You know that it's only a matter of time. There's no hope for those guys; the
surprise was too perfect.

Minutes later, not a sigle target is active. And, a good thing too as you've
expended most of your ordnance. Its time to pull pitch and head for home.
"Zulu's, form on me. Let's get out of here. Well done!"

                                                                  [Page   9]

Back at the TOC you and the other flight commanders are preparing for the
debrief. As you sit and wait your turn, a smile slowly cracks across your face
- just another successful mission.

You knew it all the time.

                                                                  [Page  10]


OVERVIEW

Gunship 2000 is a detailed presentation of the art of present and near future
helicopter combat operations. You can control just one or up to five distinct
helicopters. The current and planned versions of the most prevalent U.S. Army
helicopters are available for the choosing. Not just a bystander, you actually
pilot on of the Army's top helicopters.

You start out as a Warrant Officer Candidate (WOC) at the Army Aviation Center
Fort Rucker, Alabama. Here you select your squadron and provide its nickname.
More importantly, you get the necessary training to prepare you for the
difficult challenge of helicopter combat. You determine the reality or
difficulty of the training. It can be as simple or as hard as you desire; the
advantage here, you can take your time and can't be damaged. Plus, you can
return to training at any time to brush up on your skills.

Upon completion, you are promoted to Warrant Officer (W01), and move on to
Single Helicopter Missions. here you command and fly a single helicopter, in
one of two theaters, against opposing forces in a variety of missions. The
rank of a commissioned officer awaits your success; and upon receiving your
commision, the door opens to the endless variety and challenge of Flight and
Campaign Missions.

In the Flight Missions you are not only an active member of, but command a
flight of five helicopters. You determine the mix of helicopters and ordnance
necessary to complete the mission. How well you employ your own helicopter,
plus command the other four helicopters determines the success or failure of
the missions.

The Campaign Mission places you in a situation of continous combat where
mission after mission is thrown at you and your flight. While you can't win
the campaign on your own, your success (or failure) does have an impact on its
ultimate outcome.

                                                                  [Page  11]

Gunship 2000 offers all the thrill and excitement of modern helicopter combat
in a visually accurate world of Topographical 3-D. Promotion, decorations and
glory await you!


                                                                  [Page  12]

HOW TO START


Sorting the Materials

This Manual provides a tutorial for beginners, in-depth operating instructions
and a wide variety of tactical, historical and technical background.

The Technical Supplement provides specific instructions for the installation
and/or loading of this simulation on your computer. It also acts as a complete
reference guide for all of the graphics and keys used in the simulation.

The Keyboard Overlay(s) visually represents all of the controls and orders
necessary for the operation of your helicopter and the computer itself.


Installation/Loading

The Technical Supplement provides complete instructions about how to install
Gunship 2000 onto either a hard disk (strongly recommended) or floppy disks.
See the "Installation" section for details.

In addition, the "Loading" section provides instructions for starting up the
simulation. You'll be provided the opportunity to tailor the software to your
system, specifically the controller type and sound options. If you have a
joystick, we strongly recommend its use. However, it's not required - the
entire simulation can be controlled from the keyboard.


Learning the Simulation

The first step is to become acquainted with actual helicopter flight systems.
Read through "The Helicopter" (pages 85-114). In this section, the theory and
practical application of helicopter flight is discussed. Those unfamiliar with
any type of flight or familiar only with fixed-wing flight will find the
information quite beneficial. With this information in hand, you are ready to
proceed to the tutorial.


                                                                  [Page  13]

                                                                  [Page  14]

Page 14 contains an illustration/picture, some people sitting on a helicopter.

                                                                  [Page  15]

                                  1. TUTORIAL


This tutorial enables you to strap on the seat of a helicopter and begin
flying without digesting the entire manual. However, it neither provides you
with the necessary insight to skillfully utilize the various weapon systems
available, nor details the multiple helicopter operations. It familiarizes you
with the basic controls and systems of the AH-64A Apache Gunship in a simple
training flight against simulated opposing forces.

GETTING STARTED


Installation/Loading

See the Technical Supplement for Specific instructions for the installation,
loading and configuration of this simulation on your computer.

Where You Start

After the title squence, you'll find yourself at brigade headquarters. Various
"action areas" are placed at position around this screen. These "action areas"
are accessed to select the various options available at brigade headquarters.

To select an option, use the controller to position the cursor over the
desired "action area". When an "action area" is accessed, the cursor changed
shape to a bull's-eye and the option's title is displayed at the bottom of the
screen. Pressing Selector #1 selects that option.

Duty Roster

As a new pilot, your first step is to get your name up on the Duty Roster. As
part of this process, you also have the opportunity to select your squadron
unit insignia and its nickname. 

Position the cursor over the duty roster hanging on the back wall and press

                                                                  [Page  16]

Selector #1. The "Duty Roster" screen now appears.

By Positioning the cursor over any one of the six pilots, a detailed
accounting of the flight commander and flight members, if any, is displayed in
the top section. For now, you just want to get your name on the Duty Roster
(for a detailed description of the Duty Roster, see pages 24-27).

Position the cursor over the "Erase Me" pilot and press Selector #2; then
follow the instructions to enter your name and select your squadron and its
nickname. Leave the cursor positioned over your new pilot (the corresponding
data should be displayed in the top section) and press Selector #1. This
selects that pilot and returns you to the brigade headquarters screen.

Notice that your pilot's name and unit are now listed at the top of the Duty
Roster.


Type of Flight

Now position the cursor over the duty officer's desk (he is sitting in the
foreground) and press Selector #1. The "Type of Flight" screen now appears.

Since you're in training, position the cursor over the "Training" and press
Selector #1. This places you in the training mode and returns you to the 
brigade headquarters screen.

Notice that the duty officer is now holding an envelope marked "Training";
this envelope contains your orders for this training mission.


Theater of Duty

Now position the cursor over the world map located on the right wall and
press Selector #1. The "Theater of Duty" screen now appears.

There are simulated training sites available for either of the two theaters -
The Persian Gulf and Central Europe. Select the Persian Gulf (you will
eventually want to fly training missions in both theaters) by positioning the
cursor in the box outlining the theater and pressing Selector #1. You now
return to the brigade headquarters screen; notice that the Persian Gulf
theater is outlined on the world map.


Mission Briefing

You are now ready to start the training flight. Position the cursor over the
door marked "Exit" and press Selector #1. The Briefing screen now appears.

It's time to familiarize yourself with the Mission Orders. As you look out at
the TF Commander, the top page of your Mission Orders is just visible at the
bottom of the screen. Position the cursor on the page and press Selector #1.
You are now looking down at the top page.

Since this is a training mission, some of the data is in abbreviated form;

                                                                  [Page  17]

however note two important areas.

First, are the "Primary Mission" and "Secondary Missions". Review the type or
nature of the missions. Additionally, the position of your base, FARP are also
indicated.

Position the cursor anywhere on the page and press Selector #1. The next page
appears. This lists the support data about the position of your base, FARP, 
flight conditions and the S2's intelligence report.

Please note that the map coordinates are read military fashion, "right & up".
The first number listed is on the horizontal scale, and the second on the
vertical scale. For example, 00/16 is in the upper left corner. Remember that
maps are never 100% accurate. This is especially true when sighting mobile
units.

Position the cursor anywhere on the page and press Selector #1. The mission
map appears. This map indicates the relative positions of the different
Primary Missions (P), your base (B) and FARP (F). Additionally, the map
details the major terrain features and other areas of interest (for a 
detailed description of the mission map, see pages 41-42).

To review the Mission Orders, you may sequentially leaf through the pages any
number of times. After review, position the cursor over the envelope and press
Selector #1. The briefing Screen now appears.

For this flight let's go with the armorer's recommended weapon load and begin
the mission. Position the cursor over the map and press Selector #1. The
Cockpit Switches now appear.


Cockpit Switches

When Gunship 2000 is first installed, all of the switches are set at the
lowest difficulty levels. Let's leave them that way for this flight. By
positioning the cursor over a switch, a brief description of its function
appears in the "Data Display" at the upper right (for a detailed description
of the cockpit switches, see pages 34-39).

Located in the center of the screen is the "GPS Consol". Position the cursor
over this area; the Data Display describes the Console's function and then
displays the GPS Cipher as it appeared in your Mission Orders.

You're shown a Squadron Insignia along with a five digit number. These
insignia and numbers are found between pages 21 & 60 of this manual. Find

                                                                  [Page  18]

the corresponding five digit Authenticator Code, and enter this number by
pressing the appropriate numeric keys.

If the correct code is entered, the GPS Console displays "Signal Locked".
You're now ready to start the mission.

If you can't find the correct code, you can still fly the mission, but the
on-board GPS Map is disabled along with your weapons. Basically, you're on a
sighseeing tour, but at least the view is breathtaking.

Now position the cursor over the "Aux Power Unit" switch. This switch starts
the helicopter's engines, which begins the mission. It has a safety cover so
that it won't be inadvertently activated. Press Selector #1, and the safety
cover flips up. Press Selector #1 again, and the power winds up - your mission
begins.


AT THE CONTROLS


Now you're on the ground at your base, at the controls of an AH-64A Apache.
You have a pilot's eye view of the world as you look out over the cockpit
gagues and indicators. The following is an abridged version of the flight
controls; it'll get you started in your first helicopter flight (for a
detailed description of the flight and cockpit controls, see pages 47-51)

You start the training mission by taking off from your base, and end it by
landing back at your base.

Getting Airborne

At this point, it's a good idea to locate the pause (alt p) key. The 
frustration factor is much reduced if you pause the flight, read a section,
perform the actions, pause again and read on further. 

Your engines are already on line (the APU provided the necessary power to fire
them up). Now engage the rotor; press the Rotor Engage/Disengage (9) key. The
rotor indicator light turns from red to green, and the rotor starts to rotate.

Vertical movement is controlled by the Collective. Press the Collective Up (=)
key a few times util the Apache starts to gain lift. When the altitude reaches
approximately 200 feet, press the Collective Down (-) key to stabilize the
lift.

Horizontal movement is controlled by the Cyclic. To move forward, push the
Joystick (up arrow) forward. You now start to gain speed. By pushing the
Joystick fully forward, the maximum speed for that altitude is attained. The
Joystick need not be kept in a forward position to maintain forward flight;
it's self trimming when centered.

                                                                  [Page  19]

Next push the Joystick (right arrow) slightly to the right. You bank and turn
to the right. If you do the opposite, you bank and turn to the left.


Map View

Press the Map View (F10) key; the GPS map now appears. Don't worry, your
Apache doesn't crash while you're viewing the map - the action is suspended.

The GPS map displays the entire world in which you're flying. Notice that it
matches the map you reviewed in your Mission Orders. Your Apache is positioned
in the center of the map, and the first Primary Objective is just to the
North.

Let's use the Apache's INS System to navigate to the target (for more
information on the INS System, see page 57).

Press the F key to select the Fly To command. Position the cursor over the 
first Primary Objective, and press Selector #1 followed by the Selector #2.
This enters that position into the INS System.

You can check the map at any time during a flight to verify positions. For
now, press the Selector #1 to return to the cockpit view.

The heading for the Primary Mission is displayed in the INS Indicator. More
than likely, your true heading is different from the INS heading. Bank the
Apache towards the INS heading indicator until the two heading numbers match.
This new heading will take you to the first Primary Mission for gunnery
practice. 


Weapon Selection

Your Weapons Indicator (located at the lower left) should display "Cannon"; if
not, press the Weapon Select (space bar) key until it displays "Cannon",
You've now selected the Apache's M230 30mm Chaingun. It has a max range of
1,500 meters, but its optimum range is 700 meters dead ahead and half that for
a "deflection shot" to the side.


Targeting

Before you can fire at an opposing unit, the TADS must be locked onto the
target. Look at the Threat Display (it's located in the lower right hand 
corner). If you're flying in the correct direction, there should be a red dot
directly ahead. If not, adjust your flight path. Check the map to verify the
placement of your waypoint. 

The TADS should be locked onto the target, a BTR-60 APC (the First Primary
Mission). It's displayed, along with its identification, true heading and
range data, in the MFD (located in the center of the cockpit). If the TADS
isn't locked onto the target, press the Acquire/Next Target (selector #2) key.

                                                                  [Page  20]

When locked, a Target Diamond appears in your view along with the Reticle
Ring. The Target Box indicates the exact position and heading to the BTR-60.
The Reticle Ring is the aiming point of the cannon. To hit the target, the
Reticle Ring must be superimposed over the Target Diamond. Adjust your flight
path if necessary.


Taking the Shot

When the BTR-60 enters maximum range for the cannon, the Target Box changes
from a broken box to a solid. This indicates that the selected weapon
(the M230 cannon in this case) is now "in constraints".

Keep the Target Box centered in the Reticle Ring, and let the range decrease.
As the range decreases the Reticle Ring increases in size, indicating an
increase in weaon accuracy. As you gain experience, you will eventually be
able to determine weaon accuracy just from the size of the Reticle Ring.

When the range reaches about 700 meters, open fire by pressing Selector #1.
You don't have to aim the M230 as it automatically tracks the target as long
as the Reticle Ring is superimposed over the Target Box. After a few rounds,
the BTR-60 is knocked out; you'll see its telltale explosion in the distance.


Return to Base

Well that's probably enough action for this flight; let's return to base.
Select the Map View and set the INS System for a heading to the base.

Fly the Apache to a position directly over the base. When in position, pull
back on the cyclic and allow your speed to drop to zero. Now press the
Collective Down (-) key to start a slow descent on to the base. It's of no
consequence if your descent is too fast, you can't crash on this flight.
Perfect landings only come with practice.

Upon touchdown, press the Rotor Engage/Disengage (9) key (the indicator light
now changes from green to red), and the rotor slows to a stop. This training
flight is now at an end.

Good luck on your future flights!


                                                                  [Page  21]

PREPARE FOR FLIGHT


Installation/Loading

See the Technical Supplement for specific instructions for the installation,
loading and configuration of this simulation on your computer.


Making Selections

Gunship 2000 provides for a large number of game options. These are presented
in various screens in the form of "action areas" or in a menu format.

When a screen first appears, the cursor will be positioned on the screen or
over a menu selection. You move the cursor or change the menu selection by
using the Controller. Once positioned over the desired option, it's selected
by pressing Selector #1. 


Using a Joystick

If your controller is a joystick, moving the stick up or down moves the cursor
vertically; moving the stick left or right moves the cursor horizontally. 
Vertical and horizontal movement can be combined.


Using the keyboard

If your controller is the keyboard, then any Arrow key moves the cursor to the
nearest option; the tab key moves the cursor to the next option; the shift Tab
key moves the cursor to the previous option; the Home key moves the cursor to
the top of menus; and the End key moves the cursor to the bottom of menu
listings. The keyboard can be utilized in conjunction with a joystick.


Action Areas

Most options are accessed via "action areas". These are placed at various
positions around the different screens. However, in some cases, menus are 

                                                                  [Page  24]

utilized where lists of data optios are more functional.

To select an option, use the controller to position the cursor over the 
desired "action area". When an "action area" is accessed, the cursor changes
shape from an arrow to a bull's-eye and the option's title displays at the
bottom of the screen. Pressing Selector #1 then selects that option. Menu
options are selected in a similar manner; the selected option is highlighted.

Whenever an option is selected in error, pressing the esc key cancels the
selection.


Brigade HQ

All action beings at Brigade Headquarters, located at your home base. From
this screen, the selections are made the determine the nature of your
upcoming mission(s). 

There are five "action areas" located at various positions around the screen,
and these are accessed to make the various mission selections.


Duty Roster

Position the cursor over the Duty Roster hanging on the back wall and press
Selector #1.

The duty roster is utilized to post the name of an active pilot, and flight
members, if any, for the upcoming mission. The name of the posted, or active
pilot always displays at the top of the Duty Roster.

What does it all mean; The Duty Roster is a detailed summary of a pilot's
career and the careers of his flight members, if he is also a flight
commander. By positioning the cursor over any one of the six pilots, that 
pilot is posted and a detailed accounting of the pilot and flight members then
displays in the top section.

The pilot's name, rank, squadron insignia, squadron nickname, decorations
awarded (numerals indicate multiple awards), missions flown and career
score(s) display. If the pilot is a flight commander, the flight members are
also listed along with their name, rank and decorations.

                                                                  [Page  25]

Ranks: Throughout a career, a pilot, including flight members, can advance
through the ranks from Warrant Officer Candidate all the way up to Brigadier
General. Ranks are indicated by a military abbrevation or by the actual rank
insignia.

The military abbreviations correspond to the following ranks in order of 
achievement:

 WOC: Warrant Officer Candidate
 WO1: Warrant Officer, W-1
 CW2: Chief Warrant Officer, W-2
 CW3: Chief Warrant Officer, W-3
 CW4: Chief Warrant Officer, W-4
 2LT: Second Lieutenant
 1LT: First Liutenant
 CAP: Captain
 MAJ: Major
 LTC: Lieutenant Colonel
 COL: Colonel
  BG: Brigadier General

Decorations: For examplary service, a pilot, including flight members, are
awarded decorations up to and including the Congressional Medal of Honor.
Decorations are displayed by an abbreviation and the actual medal.

The abbreviations correspond to the following decorations:

 NDS: The National Defense Service Medal - awarded for successfully completing
      training.

  PH: The Purple Heart - awarded for wounds received in combat.

The following decorations are awarded for heroism and valor, and are listed
from least difficult to achieve to the highest:

 ACV: The Army Commendation Medal for Valor
 AMV: The Air Medal for Valor
 BSV: The Bronze Star for Valor
  SS: The Silver Star

                                                                  [Page  26]

 DSC: The Distinguished Service Cross
CMOH: The Congressional Medal of Honor

Career Records: There are three numerical values that summarize a pilot's
career records. They represent, from left to right, last mission, best mission
and total career.

Status: Pilots, and consequently their flight members, are classified by the
current flight status. Only "Active" pilots can be posted for duty.

Active: Currently on active duty and good to go. You can have up to six
"Active" pilots on the Duty Roster.

Retired: If you are successful enough to acieve the rank of Brigadier General,
your country will ask no more of you. There's no more flying for you, and 
you'll be posted to a cushy desk job at the pentago.

However, if you've flown 99 missions without acieveing the rank of Brigadier
General, and very few do, you'll be retired from combat and posted to the Army
Aviation Center at Ft. Rucker, Alabama as a pilot instructor.

MIA: If you helicopter goes down behind enemy lines, there's a chance you'll
be lost or captured. As a result, you'll be classified as "Missing in Action".

KIA: If your helicopter suffers a catastrophic crash there's a change you
won't walk away from it. As a result, you'll be classified as "Killed in
Action".

Campaigns: If your pilot and flight are currently engaged in a campaign, that
information is displayed. Campaigns must be resolved before any other mission
(except training) can be flown.

New Pilot: If you are creating a new pilot, you must permanently erase an
existing pilot from the Duty Roster; so be careful who you select for erasure.
An "Erase Me" pilot has been provided for your first entry.

Position the cursor over the "Erase Me" pilot and press Selector #2; follow
the instructions to enter your name and select your squadron insignia and its
nickname. Notice that your pilot's name and unit are now listed at the top of
the Duty Roster. All new pilots start out at the rank of WOC.

Leave the cursor positioned over your new pilot (the corresponding data is
displayed in the top section) and press Selector #1.

                                                                  [Page  27]

Existing Pilot: If you don't want to create a new pilot and want to continue
the career of an "Active" pilot, position the cursor over that pilot and press
Selector #1.


Type of Flight

Position the cursor over the duty officer's desk (he is sitting in the
foreground) and press Selector #1.

The open folder displays the available mission options:

Traingin: These missions are conducted at the training center, and are
constructed to simulate the Theaters of Duty. The opposing forces are always
positioned in the same manner so that various weapons and tactics can be
tested.

Training missions simulate all helicopter operations with the following
exceptions:

No Damage: You can't be hurt, as all of the opposing shots are simulated, and
you walk away from all crash landings. However, the opposing weaons do behave
normally, so you can still practice defensive measures.

Career Record: The Training mission does not count as a mission flown; you
don't receive any score, promotion or decorations for heroism and valor.

Training missions can be flown at any time during a pilot's career, and, in
fact, are the only alternative mission type that can be selected if a pilot is
currently engaged in a Campaign. New pilots are not required to select
Training, but if you do, at least you'll receive quick promotion to W01 and
the NDS medal.

Single Helicopter: These missions send you out in a single helicopter against
a real opposing force. While any pilot can fly these missions, pilots of any
Warrant Officer rank are limited to Single Helicopter Missions.

During Single Helicopter missions, you're assigned a Primary, and more than
likely, a Secondary mission. These missions can either be Point Attack or
Search & Destroy.

Point Attack: You're directed to a specific target or targets with the
objective to eliminate the targets.

Search & Destroy: The specific location of the targets is unknown or the
targets are moving. You need to search the area described in your orders to

                                                                  [Page  28]

find the target units with the objective to eliminate them.

Flight: Once you have received your commission (ranks of Second Liutenant and
above), you are then eligible to command a multiple-helicopter flight. The
other pilots in your flight are assigned to you from the force pool, and stay
with you for the duration.

As with Single Helicopter missions, you're assigned overall missions. The
missions include the two described above plus Deep Strike, Tactical Support,
Search & Rescue and Recon.

Deep Strike: You're directed to a target or targets deep in enemy territory,
far from your home base. We take care of getting you to the "passage point",
but you must take it from there.

Tactical Support: You're called upon to pick-up or deliver troops or supplies
to the battle area. There may also be wounded in need of immediate evacuation.
While these "beans and bullets" missions may seem less sexy, they are none the
less important. Besides, you may have to fight your way in and out. A UH-60K/L
Blackhawk must be on tap to successfully complete these missions.

Search & Rescue: Friendly forces are in need of extraction, but must first be
located. Not unlike Search & Destroy missions, but don't take any shots at
these guys. The UH-60K/L Blackhawk must be on tap to successfully complete
these missions.

Recon: The scouts lead the way here, as you're ordered to see what's out
there. The OH-58D Kiowa Warrior, AH-66A Comanche or AH-6G Defender must be on
tap to successfully complete these missions.

Campaign: This is a theatre-wide commitment for the long haul. You're placed
in a situation of continous combat where mission after mission is thrown at
you and your flight.

Who knows how long it will last; there's no set schedule in combat. While you
can't win the campaign on your own, your success (or failure) does have an
impact on its ultimate outcome.

                                                                  [Page  29]

Theater of Duty

If you are a new pilot, it's best to choose Training as your first flight. In
any case, position the cursor over the desired mission type and press
Selector #1.

Position the cursor over the world map located on the right wall and press
Selector #1.

At this time, there are two theaters of operation available:

Persian Gulf: No pushovers here. The Iraqis are a well equipped foe. They
possess a high degree of commitment and won't easily waiver. Additionally,
flying in desert conditions presents a whole different set of factors.

As an added attraction, you and your flight may be call upon to stage from
Amphibious Assault Ships located in the nearby waters. Your skill and special
training aptly qualify you for this duty.

Central Europe: This reagion is the greatest challenge since you are up
against the best the Soviet Union has to offer. They may be down, but they're
not yet out. The region remains very unstable; the history books are yet to be
written on what could transpire.

Additional Theaters: Gunship 2000 supports add-on theaters and their related
forces and equipment. A number of potential areas are currently under
consideration.

Make your selection by positioning the cursor in the box outlining the theater
and press Selector #1.


Squadron Archives

While not an integral component of the mission selection process, the Squadron
Archives certainly come into play over the course of a pilot's career. These
records are kept in the filing cabinet located just beneath the Theater Map.

Mission Films: Position the cursor over the top drawer and press Selector #1;
this drawer contains the saved mission replay films. During mission debriefing
you're given the opportunity to save the mission replay for later viewing.

Positioning the cursor over a film title and pressing Selector #1, selects the
film - press play to replay the film.

                                                                  [Page  30]

You may also exchange mission films with your friends - this way you can show
them what real pilots do in their spare time.

Duty Roster: Position the cursor over the bottom drawer and press Selector #1;
this drawer contains the pre-mission Duty Roster.

We've all been in the situation where a single mistake has resulted in a life
ending crash, or at the very least fast-tracked our careers to oblivion. This
always seems to happen when we're just on the verge of a major promotion.

In the past, quick reboots or DOS copies of the roster were the only
alternatives around this dilemma. Now you can use this option to restory the
Duty Roster to its state just prior to the last mission flown. Its like the
mission never happened - we all need a few breaks once in a while.

One warning - you must actually fly the mission before you can restore the
Duty Roster; this doesn't save you from the stigma of refusing to fly a
mission.


Exiting Brigade HQ

You're now ready to attend the mission briefing. Before you leave, make one
last scan of the screen to verify your selections; once you leave, you're 
committed.

When ready, position the cursor over the door marked "Exit" and press Selector
#1.


Mission Briefing

Depending upon the Theater selected, you now find yourself in simple
surroundings among the lush green hills of Central Europe or on the stark
sands of the Persian Gulf. As a matter of course in the Persian Gulf, you may
also find yourself in the ready room of an Amphibious Assault Ship.

There are three "action areas" located at various positions around the screen.


Mission Orders

The top page of your Mission Orders is just visible at the bottom of the
screen. Position the cursor on the page and press Selector #1.

These four pages not only detail the upcoming mission, but also provide
important intelligence data about the opposing forces. It's very important to
read your orders carefully. Press Selector #1 to leaf through the paes.

                                                                  [Page  31]

Call Sign: It's based on the phonetic military alphabet; you're always number
"1".

Primary Mission: This is the "primary" reason this mission exists, and why
you're being sent out. Make sure that you understand the components of the
primary and its requirements for completion. Its general location is indicated
on the mission map with a "P".

Secondary Mission: More than likely, a "secondary" is also assigned; its
presentation is the same as your Primary. Although classified a Secondary
Mission, it's still important. You can complete it first, but don't forget the
primary. The Secondary Mission's general location is indicated on the mission
map with an "S".

Base: This is where you will start and finish the mission. Its location is
indicated on the mission map with a "B".

Note that on Deep Strike missions, your base is somewhere off the mission map.
You start on the edge of the world at the "Passage Point"; this is expressed
as two coordinate values. This is the only safe exit from the mission.

FARP: If a "FARP" is available, its location is indicated on the mission map
with an "F". You may land at a FARP to replenish fuel and weapons.

S-2 Report: The S-2 gives you his best estimate (guess?) about the opposing
force's equipment. Pay special attention to the availability of opposing
helicopters.

Conditions: The meteorological section gives you a brief report on the
expected weather conditions in the flight area. How these conditions affect
flying is dependent upon the flight switch settings.

Mission Map: This is the flight area for the current mission. All of the key
points of interest are indicated on the map.

Please note that the map coordinates are read military fashion, "right & up".
The first number listed is on the horizontal scale, and the second on the
vertical scale. For example, 00/16 is in the upper left corner. Remember that
maps are never 100% accurate. This is especially true of ground unit and
mobile base sightings.

                                                                  [Page  32]

Decline Mission: In the event you really don't want to fly this mission, you
can opt to pass it along to someone else and request new orders. If currently
engaged in a campaign, this page provides the mechanism to suspend or abort
the campaign and return to Brigade HQ.

To review the Mission Orders, you may sequentially leaf through the pages any
number of times. After review, position the cursor over the envelope and press
Selector #1.


Outfit Helicopters

The squadron armorer routinely places the recommended helicopters, with
ordnance, on the flightline. You can accept his recommendations or change
any or all of the helicopters and ordnance. To review, position the cursor
over the helicopters in the background and press Selector #1.

This provides a complete overview of the pilot assignments, helicopters and
their respective ordnance. From this screen, you may shift the pilots and/or
helicopters to other positions and also assign sectioon leaders.


Outfit Summary

Swap Pilots: Position the cursor anywhere in the first pilot's summary section
and press the p (Swap Pilots) key; the pilot's outline now starts to flash.
Position the cursor in the second pilot's summary section and again press the
p (Swap Pilots) key. There's just one restriction, you must occupy the #1
position. After all, you're the flight leader.

Swap Helicopters: Position the cursor anywhere in the first helicopter's
summary section and press the h (Swap Helicopters) key; the helicopter's
outline now starts to flash. Position the cursor in the second helicopter's
summary section and again press the h (Swap Helicopters) key.

Duplicate Helicopters: Position the cursor anywhere in the first helicopter's
summary section and press the d (duplicate helicopters) key; the helicopter's
outline now starts to flash. Position the cursor in the second helicopter's
summary section and again press the d (duplicate helicopters) key.

Section Leaders: Your flight may be organized or "sectioned" into one section
of five or into two smaller sections. The section of three is the "Heavy

                                                                  [Page  33]

Section"; the other section of two is the "Light Section". Sections fly as a
single group, which greatly facilitates flight commands.

You're always a section leader; the pilots occupying positions #3 and #4 may
alternately be assigned as a section leader. Position the cursor anywhere in
the pilot's summary section and press the l (Assign Section Leader) key.

The Heavy Section is identified by a blue band and the Light Section by a grey
band.

Return to the Mission Briefing screen when satisfied with the mix, but first,
read on.

If you want to change a helicopter's ordnance, or change the actual
helicopter, position the cursor anywhere in the helicopter's summary section
and press Selector #1. The Arming Screen displays the current helicopter along
with its ordnance.


Arming

Weapons: A brief description of each weapon displays at the upper right; for a
more complete description see pages 67-68.

To select a weapon, highlight it and press Selector #1; then select the
appropriate option among those available. Existing weapons can be directly
replaced; the existing weapon doesn't need to be first removed.

Most helicopter weapons are balance loaded; whenever you add or subtract a
weapon to one position, its twin automatically loads on the opposite wing. The
Defender and Kiowa Warrior are exceptions; their pylons can carry different
weapons.

Fuel Highlight "Fuel" and press Selector #1. Expressed as a factor of 100%,
fuel is increased or decreased as desired. While it's real tempting to trade
fuel for weapons, don't leave yourself short; it's very embarrassing if you
have to walk back.

Ammo: This only applies to helicopters with integral cannons or machine-guns.

                                                                  [Page  34]

Highlight "Ammo" and press Selector #1. Ammo is loaded to the maximum, or any
lesser amount.

Chaff/Flares: Highlight "Chaff/Flares" and press Selector #1. A mix of 60 
chaff & flares are carried.

Load: All helicopters are rated for a maximum load capacity; this value is
expresed as a factor of 100%. Theater and weather conditions affect the
maximum load capacity of a helicopter. It decreases as temperature and
humidity increase, and is further reduced by low atmospheric pressure. Load
capacity is also reduced at higher altitudes as air becomes thinner as
altitude increases.

The load capacity is automatically calculated for each helicopter, but of
course, varies by the theater and mission conditions. As you change weapons or
increase/decrease Fuel or Ammo (the chaff & flare mix doesn't impact load) the
load capacity changes. You can load ordnance in excess of 100%, but the load
must be 100% or less before you exit the arming sequence.

A load of less than 100% is desirable since more reserve power is then
available.

Change Helicopter: Highlight "Change Helicopter" and press Selector #1. Select
the new helicopter by highlighting it and pressing Selector #1. New
helicopters always arrive on the flightline "clean" (without ordnance).

Return to the Outfit Summary screen when satisfied with the mix; highlight
"Ordnance Complete" and press Selector #1.


Exiting Mission Briefing

You're ready to start the mission. Position the cursor over the map and press
Selector #1.

Note that during campaigns, this map is used to advise you of the current
state of a campaign. The degree of victory or defeat is indicated by how far
the blue side (friendly) or the red side (opposing) has advanced beyond the
original front line.


Cockpit Switches

You preflight, or set, the Cockpit Switches to determine the overall "reality"
or difficulty of the upcoming mission. Many different switch combinations
allow you to tailor the settings to your own particular needs. You must also

                                                                  [Page  35]

enter the GPS Authenticator Code to activate on-board systems.

There are nine "action areas" located at various positions around the screen.
The "Data Display" in the upper right corner displays a brief description of
each switch whenever an action area is accessed. Change switch settings by
positioning the cursor over the switch and pressing Selector #1.


CP/G Controls

This assign duties to your invisible CP/G, and enables you to concentrate on
other activities.

Weapons/C.M.: The CP/G automatically fires all weapons. The CP/G additionally
activates the appropriate countermeasures systems as needed.

C.M.: The GP/G controls just the C.M. systems.

None: You control all weapon/C.M. systems.

While the CP/G does an adequate job, you will eventually want to control all
systems yourself.


Enemy Quality

This determines the competency level and training of the opposing forces. It
has a direct correlation with how quickly an opposing unit can achieve a lock
on your helicopter, and the relative accuracy of its weapons. Units of lower
quality are also more reluctant to pursue an objective in the face of stiff
resistance.

Poor: These guys are best described as rabble. A civilian force could probably
do just as well. Not much to worry about here, you can mop up these troops 
with no trouble. A good first opponent for new pilots. 

Average: These are your basic every day troops. Certainly not exemplary, but
at least they're not the bottom of the barrel.

Crack: Now we're starting to talk competence. These guys know their business,

                                                                  [Page  36]

and are a real challenge. They are agressive and clever. Don't assume anything

Elite: The Best of the best. Not much more need be said about these troops.
They go to any lenghts to accomplis their objectives or to stop you from
accomplishing yours. You need to be exceptionally quick and skillful to get
the upper hand.


Flight

This switch sets the flight mode parameters of your helicopter.

Easy: The pitch, roll, altitude and airspeed of the helicopter have no effect
on lift. No matter how you maneuver the cyclic (joystick), lift, and therefore
your altitude is unaffected. The collective is the only control that affects
lift/altitude.

Realistic: Here the pitch, roll, altitude and airspeed affect lift as in a 
real helicopter.


Landings

This switch sets the difficulty level or "forgiveness" associated with your
landing attempts.

No Crashes: All landings are perfect.

Realistic: Landings need to be within the design specifications of the
helicopter; if not, damage or destruction could result. Easy does it.


Avoidance

This switch turns the on-board collision avoidance system on or off.

On: The helicopter automatically avoids all intervening terrain features,
thereby preventing instant destruction on hillsides. The system avoids the
objects by gaining altitude, so don't deliberately fly at tall mountains; it
can't protect you from bullets.

Off: You're on your own, so keep alert. The radar altimeter is probably your
best freind.


Wind

This switch activates or deactivates wind effects

No Wind: The flight conditions are calm and serene.

Realistic: The wind is blowing across the battle field at the velocity and
bearing indicated in the Mission Orders. Your helicopter displaces an equal
amount to the wind.

                                                                  [Page  37]

Visibility

This switch's setting determines the probability of naturally occuring (fog,
rain, etc.) or man-made conditions (smoke) obscuring visibility or limiting
the effectiveness of visiononics equipment.

Clear: Visibility is unlimited.

Realistic: Visibility can be limited by battlefield obscurants.


Difficulty

The combination of theater, mission type and switch settings determines the
overall difficulty level of the upcoming mission. The higher the difficulty
level, the greater the challenge, but the potential reward is heightened.

The "Difficulty" indicator provides a visual gauge of the difficulty level.
When fully illuminated, the mission is of extreme difficulty. The indicator is
unilluminated, regardless of the settings, for Training Missions, as no score
is awarded.
                                                       
                                                  
GPS System

Located in the center of the screen is the "GPS Consol". Position the cursor
over this area. After the Data Display describes the Console's function it
then displays the GPS Cipher as it appeared in your Mission Orders.
                                                          
You were shown a Squadron Insignia along with a five digit number. These
insignia and numbers are found between pages 21 & 60 of this manual. Find the
corresponding five digit Authenticator Code, and enter this number by
pressing the appropriate numeric keys.

If the correct code is entered, the GPS Console will display "Signal Locket".
You're ready to start the mission.

If you can't find the correct code, you can still fly the mission, but the on-
board GPS Map are disabled along with your weapons.


APU

Now position the cursor over the "Aux Power Unit" switch. This switch is used
to start the helicopter's engines and begin the mission. It has a safety cover
so that it won't be inadvertently activated; it requires two keystrokes to
activate. Press Selector #1, and the safety cover flips up. Press Selector #1
again, and the power starts to wind-up.
                                        
                                                                  [Page  38]
                                                                
SIMULATION CONTROLS AND VIEWS
                                                  

Simulation Controls

A number of commands are available to control "overhead" or various game
functions. While these commands can be utilized at any time, some relate to
specific functions, and have no effect.


Pause

Press the Pause (alt p) key to immediately freeze the action. Some computers
have specific "pause" or "hold" keys. Depending on the internal design of your
computer, these keys may also work. Pause is only effective during flight.


Joystick Adjust

Gunship 2000 supports either a joystick or the keyboard for all game
functions. If you're using a joystick, the keyboard also remains active.

If your joystick seems to be "drifting", press the Joystick Adjust (alt j) key
with the joystick centered, to re-calibrate.


Detail Adjust

If you have a slower computer, you may use the Detail Adjust (alt d) key to
access the selection menu. The simpler detail levels increase the processing
speed. The action is temporarily suspended when making the selections.


Quit to Dos

Press the Quit (alt q) key to immediately end the simulatoin and return the
system to DOS. No information, including current scores or settings, is saved
to disk. Scores and settings are automatically saved at the completion of each
mission, so only the current data is affected.


End Mission

Press the End Mission (alt e) key to end the current mission. The computer
projects the current situation into the immediate future, and determines the
results. Therefore, you can't use this key to escape from impending disaster;
and the result do count as a mission flown.


Volume Adjust

The Volume Adjust (alt v) key accesses the sound effects selection menu. The
action is temporarily suspended when making the selections.


Co-Pilot Sound

Your invisible co-pilot communicates system status and threat/target
information to you via digitized sound. While these prompts are quite helpful,
there's a price to pay in computer processing speed. If you find your system
slowing too dramatically, pressing the Co-Pilot Sound (alt c) key turns these
sound off.

                                                                  [Page  39]

Last Message

The other section leader or pilots communicate with you during the course of a
mission. These messages stay visible for only a short period of time. If for
some reason you are unable to review an entire message (you could be busy with
some bad guys of your own), pressing the Last Message (alt m) key re-displays
the text.


Cockpit Style

In addition to the processing speed gained by adjusting the detail, the style
of the cockpit can be adjusted to increase performance. Press the Cockpit
Style (alt s) key to access the selection menu. The action is temporarily
suspended when making the selection.


Accelerate Time

Press the Accelerate Time (]) key to increase the rate at which time passes,
therefore increasing the speed of your flight. This is variable setting of 16
levels. Each successive press of the key increases the speed one level. This
function is best used in combination with auto-pilot mode.


Normal Time

Press the Normal Time ([) key to immediately return to normal time; it can't
reduce the rate to less than normal time. Flight automatically returns to
normal time whenever a target is sighted or upon reaching the final waypoint.


Simulation Views

Gunship 2000 offers a number of different points of view while flying. You can
jump from inside the cockpit to a point of view outside or even ride a
Hellfire into its target.


From-the-Cockpit Views

These views are from inside of the cockpit looking out. These are your "true"
views.

Cockpit (F1): This is your normal from the cockpit view. From this you see the
gauges and controls ofthe cockpit panel. When engaging in combat, this is the
most advantageous point of view, as you have the aid of the weapon targeting
systems.

Mast (F2): The OH-58D Kiowa Warrior, MD530G Defender and AH-64B Longbow Apache
are equipped with mast mounted sights. They're used to peer over the tops of
obstacles while keeping the body of the helicopter hidden and safe from
opposing eyes and more importantly, opposing weapons.

They're best employed from hover mode (the auto-hover mode holds your
position), as you really can't mask behind terrain in forward flight. When

                                                                  [Page  40]

activated, the controller is utilized to rotate the sight, left or right,
through 360`, not to control helicopter flight.


Left (F3): View from out of the left cockpit window.

Right (F4): View from out of the right cockpit window.


Out-of-Cockpit Views
 
As an aid to flight maneuvers and combat, a variety of external views are
available. In all of them, you're "out-of-the-cockpit" looking at your
helicopters and/or the targets.

Chase (F5): You're positioned just behind your helicopter, looking past it at
whatever lies ahead. You maintain this perspective no matter how the
helicopter is maneuvered.

Flight Chase View (shift F5): You're positioned just behind one of your
pilot's helicopters looking past it at whatever lies ahead. You maintain this
perspective no matter how the helicopter is maneuvered. Press the key again to
shift your view to the next helicopter.

Tactical View (F6): You're positioned just behind your helicopter, looking
past it at the target. This view automatically rotates and pans to keep both
the helicopter and targetin view.

This view is helpful when engaging air targets, and is also useful if you want
to return for a second or third pass at a ground target. It's probably wise to
return to the cockpit before firing, so as not to waste ammunition.

Remote View (F7): You're positioned just off from your helicopter; your
helicopter continues its flight. This view automatically rotates and pans to
keep your helicopter in view. It's not unlike the view of a radio-controlled
flight.

Additionally, by pressing and holding Selector #2 and adjusting the controller
you can shift your point of view. Holding Selector #2 maintains that point of
view.

Reverse Tactical View (F8): You're positioned just behind your helicopter's
target, looking past it at your own helicopter. The target can either be an
air or ground unit - whatever you're locked on. In either case, the target is
in the foreground, and your helicopter is in the distance. In fact, it may

                                                                  [Page  41]

only be a dot in the sky. This view automatically rotates and pans to keep
both the target and your helicopter in view.

Experienced pilots find this a very dramatic view when making attack runs at
ground targets. It's a great view to showoff, but keep in mind that your
helicopter is still flying; don't crash into a hill while admiring the view.

Missile View (F9): You're positioned directly behind the weapon just
launched. This view is very entertaining, as you follow the weapon directly
into the target. If you're having trouble understanding why your weapons are
missing, switching to this view can be very helpful.


Map View

When the Map View (F10) key is pressed, the GPS map aapears. Your helicopter
won't crash while you're viewing the map, since the action is suspended.

The GPS map displays the entire world in which you're flying in low and high
scales. The high scale map is the default display. Not that it matches the
map provided in your Mission Orders.

This map displays the positions of all friendly units and the positions of
sighted opposing units. Current sighting display in bright red, while old
sightings display in dark red. Remember that the opposing forces may be moving
so don't rely on old sightings. Icons are used to mark the sightings.
                                                               
                                                                  [Page  42]

The different terrain features are depicted on the high scale maps. These come
in many shapes and sizes, and vary from world-to-world. Terrain is the number
one defensive measure. Get familiar with the different terrain types, and use
them to your advantage.

Press the spacebar to switch to the low scale mode. The low scale maps depict
specific terrain features. Where the large scale map indicates a mountain
group, the small scale map depicts the actualy mountains of the group. The
displayed area is scrolled by moving the Controller in any direction. A
reduced versoin of the large scale map displays in the upper right corner; the
yellow indicater "boxes" the display area. Press the spacebar to return to the
high scale map, or the esc key to return to flight mode.

HELICOPTER CONTROLS

                                                               
Flight Controls
                                               
A number of controls and flying aids are available to you as a pilot. The
following describes and defines how each works; but do not use this section as
a guide to flying, see "How to Fly", pages 53-59.

                                                                  
Cyclic Stick
                                   
Pushing the Joystick (up Arrow) forward pitches the helicopter's nose down.
Pulling the Joystick (down arrow) back pitches the helicopter's nose up.
Pushing the Joystick left (left arrow) or right (right arrow) rolls the 
helicopter in that direction.

A downward pitch moves the helicopter forard; a large down pitch causes a
faster dive in Realistic Flight mode. An upward pitch moves the helicopter
backwards.

Rolling the helicopter left or right at extremely low speeds (under 10 knots)
causes the helicopter to rotate left or right. At low speed (under 40 knots),
it causes a skid or "sideslip" left or right. At medium or high speed, it
causes a banking turn left or right.

The Artificial Horizon Gauge shows the current pitch and roll of helicopter.


Collective

Lift keeps the helicopter airborne. In level flight, increasing the collective
causes the helicopter to ascend, while decreasing the collective causes the
helicopter to descen. The current level of the collective is measured as
"torque". When raising or lower the collective, the engine torque/throttle is
automatically adjusted.

To raise or lower the collective, press the Collective Up (=) or the
Collective Down (-) keys respectively. To raise or lower the collective fast,
press the shift Collection (= or -) keys.

The Torque Gauge indicates the current level of torque.
                            

Gear

Press the Gear (3) key (AH-66a Comanche only) to toggle your landing gear up
or down. Flying with the gear down not only reduces airspeed, it increases the
radar cross-section.

The Gear Indicator Light is illuminated when it's down.

                                                                  [Page  44]
                          
Autopilot

Press the Autopilot (5) keys to engage or disengage the autopilot. When
engaged, it flies you to the "active" INS waypoint; if no waypoints are set,
the autopilot doesn't engage. When engaged, the autopilot locks in your
current altitude and speed. However, if your altitude is less than the Low
Limit, the Auto-Pilot climbs the helicopter to that altitude. If the cyclic
stick is moved in any direction, the autopilot automatically disengages.

The autopilot Indicator Light illuminates when it's engaged.

Warning: the autopilot doen't avoid hills or obstacles (unless Collision
Avoidance is engaged); it flies a straight line from waypoint to waypoint.


Next Waypoint

Press the Next Waypoint (6) key to immediately switch to the next waypoint.
This can be selected while the autopilot is engaged.


Previous Waypoint

Press the Previous Waypoint (7) key to immediately switch to the previous
waypoint. This can be selected while the autopilot is engaged.


Bay Open/Close

Press the Bay Open/Close (8) key (AH-66A Comanche only) to open or close the
weapons bay. The Comanche's interval weapons, except for the 20mm cannon, can
only fire when the bay is open. However, when open, it increases the radar 
cross-section.

The Bay Indicator Light is illuminated when it's open.


Rotor Engage/Disengage

Press the Rotor Engage/Disengage (9) key to engage the rotor (cause the
engines to turn the rotor), or disengage the rotor (cause the rotor to spin
freely, unconnected from the engines) When it's disengaged, the collective is
automatically "bottomed" (set to zero).

The Rotor Status Light indicates if the rotor is engaged (green) or disengaged
(red). The light flashes red if you attempt to add collective with the rotor
disengaged.


Auto-Hover

When flying at a speed from +10 to -10 knots, pressing the Auto-Hover (0) key
automatically places the helicopter in hover mode; your speed is automatically
reduced to zero. The collective controls can be used normally, but auto-hover
doesn't allow the altitude to drop below the Low Limit. Therefore, you can't
land with auto-hover engaged. If the cyclic stick is moved forward or back
(you may still rotate left or right), auto-hover automatically disengages.

                                                                  [Page  45]

The auto-hover Indicator Light illuminates when it's engaged; it flashes
when engaged at too high a speed.

Auto-hover is very useful to maintain a position during windy conditions or
to unmask and quickly mask from cover. You can drop altitude like a rock, 
since auto-hover holds you at the Low Limit Altitude.


One or Left MFD

Press the One of Left MFD (z) key to change the information displayed in a
single or left hand MFD. Helicopters with a single MFD have five possible
displays: navigation (heading & waypoint data), low scale map, mission orders,
weapons status or target camera. The target camera automatically displays,
overriding any other display, whenever a lock-on occurs.

Helicopters with two MFD's add a sixth option - threat display.


Right MFD

Press the Right MFD (x) key to chenge the information displayed in the right
hand MFD. Helicopters so equipped have six possible displays: navigation
(heading & waypoint data), low scale map, mission orders, weapons status,
target camera or threat display. The threat display automatically displays,
overriding any other display, whenever a target is detected.


Low Limit -

Press the Low Limit - (c) key to decrease the low altitude limit by 50 feet;
it can not be reduced below 50 feet. Both the barometric and radar altimeters
utillize the low limit setting as the bases for low altitude warnings. Audio
and visual indicators are activated whenever the altitude falls below the low
limit.

In addition to its function as a flying aid, the low limit is used to set the
flying altitude of independent helicopters and/or sections.


Low Limit +

Press the Low Limit + (v) key to increase the low altitude limit by 50 feet;
it can not be raised above 250 feet.


WEAPON CONTROLS


A number of weapon controls are available. The following describes and defines
how each works. Do not use this section as a guide to combat, see "How to
Fight", pages 60-73.


Rocket Salvo x1,x2,x4

Press the Rocket Salvo x1,x2 or x4 (1,2,4) keys to set the number of Hydra 70
unguided rockets that will be fired from each wing pod whenever "rockets" are
selected and Selector #1 is pressed. Rockets are fired symmetrically from
both wing pods, except for the Kiowa Warrior and Defender. The salvo mode is
shown in the Weapons Display.

                                                                  [Page  46]

Acquire/Next Target

Press the Acquire/Next Target (back space) key to lock onto a target or to 
switch the current lock-on. Normally, the targeting system automatically locks
onto the nearest target; this enables you to switch to an alternate target.

If no other targets are present, the lock-on remains with the current target.
The target system toggles through the potential targets from nearest to
farthest.


Radar Jammer On/Off

Press the Radar Jammer On/Off (n) key to toggle the radar on, if currently off
or off, if currently on. When the radar jammer is active, a green light
illuminates next to the "R" warning indicator.


Drop Chaff

Press the Drop Chaff (m) key to release a chaff decoy.


IR Jammer On/Off (.) key to toggle the IR on, if currently off, or off, if
currently on. When the IR Jammer is active, a green light illuminates next to
the "I" warning indicator.


Drop Flare

Press the Drop Flare (/) key to release a flare decoy.


Select Weapon

Press Selector #2 to change the active weapon; the active weapon, along with
the vailable quantity, is shown in the Weapons Indicator.


Fire Weapon

Press Selector #1 to fire the active Weapon. Most weapons are fired/launched
singly; each time Selector #1 is pressed, one round is fired. However, rockets
are fired in salvos and cannons & machine-guns fire in multiple-round bursts.

                                                                  [Page  47]


HELICOPTER GAUGES AND INDICATORS


AH-64A/B Apache

This guage, along with its digital readout, shows your horizontal speed
through the air in knots. A speed of 100 kts equals about 114 mph, or about
161 kph.


Airspeed Gauge

This gauge, along with its digital readout, is your barometric altimeter; it
shows your true altitude in feet. It's adjusted for you to compensate for
ground elevation variances so that "0" altitude is always at ground level.


Artificial Horizon

This ball guage shows your pitch (nose up or down) and your roll (left or
right).


Autopilot

The "P" illuminates whenever the autopilot is engaged.


Auto-Hover

The "H" illuminates whenever auto-hover is engaged.


Compass

The analog compass, along with its digital readout, indicates your current
heading. Note that the compass shows the heading your helicopter faces. 
During skids or backwards flight, your actual course is different.


Chaff and Flare Indicator

This indicator shows the number of defensive stores remaining. Its shown as
chaff "CF" and flares "FL". Each defensive unit is released as a group of
three cartridges.


Engine Gauge

The left and right strips in the guage marked "E" show the RPM's of the port
(left) and starboard (right) engines.


Fuel Gauge

The gauge marked "F" shows the amount of fuel remaining in all tanks.


HUD

The HUD (head-up display) projects bright numbers and symbols ahead of your 
view so that you can simultaneously read the display and look ahead.

The left scale indicates your airspeed along with a symbolic representation of
the artificial horizon.

The right side scale combines the radar altimeter with the vertical speed
indicator (see below). The radar altimeter is probably the most important
indicator you have, so pay close attention to it. It indicates your actual
height over ground. There's an important distinction between this and the 
standard altimeter. As you fly over obstacles your true altitude remains
constant, but the height over ground changes. This can be the difference

                                                                  [Page  48]

between crashing or surviving. The red band at the lower end of the scale is
low limit.

The top scale is your heading along with the INS and target lock-on pips.


INS Indicator

The INS (Inertial Navigation System) indicator indicates your course to your
current waypoint. The top fixed pip is your heading, while the bottom pip is
the waypoint. If it's right of center, turn to theright; if it's left of
center, turn to the left. The waypoint course is also indicated digitally.


MFD

The MFD has five possible displays: navigation (heading & waypoint data), low
scale map, mission orders, weapon status or target camera.


Rotor Light

The light is green when the main rotor is engaged. The light is red when the
main rotor is disengaged, i.e. spinning freely, unconnected to the engines.


Systems Status Lights

These lights show the status of major systems on board your helicopter. A
green light means the system is functioning normally; a yellow means the
system is damaged and malfuntioning; a read light means the system is knocked-
out and off-line.

The abbrevations represent:

AVN: Avionics (gauges, defensive measures)
CAN: integral cannon
FUL: fuel tanks
OPT: optics (targeting systems)
PTE: port engine
PTW: port weapons wing
RTR: Main Rotor
SBE: starboard engine
SBW: starboard weapons wing
TAL: tail rotor (flight stability)


Threat Display

This screen shows nearby targets that can potentially threaten your helicopter
Red dots are opposing units, grey dots are non-threatening units or structures
blue dots are enemy aircraft, and yellow dots are missiles in flight. This
includes both opposing missiles AND your missiles. The white flashing dot is
your present target.

The threat display automatically scales from short to long range (short range
will override long range).

                                                                  [Page  49]

Page 49 contains a picture of the Cockpit Screen (If i had a scanner, i would
Scan this picture cause it displays all the indicators and what they are etc.)
Oh and btw it's the AH-64A/B Apache Cockpit Screen it says here...

                                                                  [Page  50]

Torque Gauge

The strip shows the amount of torque in the turbine engine(s). This is
proportional to the amount of collective control and rotor lift. The higher
you set the collective, the higher the torque.


VSI

The VSI (vertical speed indicator) shows the rate you are changing altitude
(ascending or descending). If the needle is horizontal, you're maintaining a
constant altitude. If the needle dips downward, you're descending towards the
ground; if it points upward, you're ascending. The greater the needle varies
from horizontal, the greater the altitude change.


Warning Indicators and Jammers

The "R" warning light flashes red whenever a search radar "sweeps" over your
helicopter. When tracking (firing) radar for either guns or missiles locks
onto your helicopter, the light turns solid red. If you turn on your radar
jammer, the neighboring light turns green while the jammer is running. If the
jamming is successful, the solid red warning light turns off.

Note: your jammer can't suppress radar searches, so flashing red warnings may
continue even if your jammer is active. If you leave the jammer active they'll
eventually "read" your frequency and overcome the jamming.

The "I" warning light turns solid red whenever an infrared (IR) homing weapon
is approaching your helicopter. If you turn on your IR jammer, the neighboring
light turns green while the jammer is running. If the jamming is successful,
the solid red warning light turns off.

While the radar jammer can remain on, the IR jammer eventually "times out"
due to heat. It must cool down again to become effective.

Note: there aren't any active IR search devices, IR search is passive,
therefore there's no flashing red "IR" warning.

The "L" warning light turns solid red whenever your helicopter is being
illuminated by a laser ranging or targeting device. At the present time, laser
jammers are still on the drawing boards. So, find the source and get it before
it gets you or get out of Dodge quick.


Weapons Indicator

The weapons indicator shows the active weapon, its position on the helicopter,
and quantity of rounds remaining. For rockets, it also indicates the current
salvo setting.

                                                                  [Page  51]

AH-66A COMANCHE

The Comanche cockpit is dominated by electronic systems, and aptly fits the
trend towards total digital display. The first thing you notice is the lack of
analog indicators (except for the compass).


Airspeed and Altimeter

The airspeed (ASI) and altimeter (ALT) data are both digitally represented.
Next to the altimeter is the VSI icon; it indicates ascending, descending and
neutral altitude change modes.


Gear

The status retractable landing gear is indicated by the gear ("G") light; it's
illuminated when it's down. You can flyy with the gear in the down position,
but speed is reduced and the radar cross-section is increased. Landings are
impossible with the gear in the up position.


Bay

The status of the weapons bay is indicated by the bay ("B") light; it's
illuminated when the bay is open. Internal weapons, except for the 20mm
cannon, can't fire when the bay is closed. However, when open, it increases 
the radar cross-section.


Other Displays

The remaining indicators, displays and HUD function in a similar manner to
the Apaches.


THE REMAINING HELICOPTERS

Although their cockpit layouts differ from the Apaches, the gauges, indicators
and HUD in the other helicopters function exactly like the Apaches. Just
familiarize yourself with the unique layouts; the "look" of the gauges and
indicators has been standardized for ease of use.

                                                                  [Page  52]

Page 52 contains a pic of the AH-66A Comanche Cockpit Screen.

                                                                  [Page  53]

HOW TO FLY

Helicopters are very complex flying machines. One wonders how a machine so
angular and ungraceful could ever get off the ground. In flight, they look
like a mass of whirling blades. Yet, helicopters do fly - and fly well for
that matter; but, the controls are quite different from a conventional 
airplane. 

It's often said that the real pilots fly helicopters; the other guys just
dabble at flying.

Remember just one thing - DON'T OVERCONTROL! Helicopter controls are sluggish;
they react slowly. Even the most responsive helicopter (like the Comanche)
takes a couple of seconds to respond to your control movements.

Be gentle with the controls. After each control movement, watch for the result
before you do anything else. Numerous fast, radical control movements produce
unexplainable results and possibly a crash!

The most common error in helicopter flight is to over-control by pulling or
pushing hard on the cyclic or pressing too long on a key.

The emphasis is on realistic flight, since that's the most complex. If 
possible, learn to fly in the realistic mode from the beginning; you can
always fall back on the easy mode if the frustration factor gets too high.


GETTING AIRBORNE


Engage the Rotor

Your power is already on line; the APU provided the power to start the 
engines. Press the Rotor Engage/Disengage (9) key to engage the rotor system.
The rotor status light turns green when the rotor is engaged. The rotors now
come up to speed (the sound level increases).

                                                                  [Page  54]

Climb to a Hover

Press the Collective Up Fast (shift =) key until the helicopter starts to
ascend. The torque gauge rises as you "raise" the collective. Press the
Collective Down (-) key if the ascent is too fast. The VSI indicates the rate
of your ascent (the indicator is above horizontal). Let the helicopter ascend
to about 100 feet.

Press the Auto-Hover (0) key anytime your speed is from +10 to -10 knots. It's
very useful to maintain a position during windy conditions or to unmask and
quickly mask from cover.


Rotating in Hover

Push the Cyclic (left or right arrow keys) left or right to rotate the
helicopter in that direction. The speed of rotation is dependent on how far
the Cyclic is pushed (multiple presses of the arrow key). Center the Cyclic
(press the opposite arrow key until rotation stops) to stop the rotation. You
can only rotate the helicopter at speeds under 10 kts.


FLIGHT TECHNIQUES


Forward Flight

Add a little more collective. AS uyou begin climbing, push the Cyclic forward
slightly to "pitch down" the helicopter. You'll begin to move forward. At
about 30 kts, you'll start to climb. Your altimeter and VSI reflect this
change in lift. This is because forward motion in a helicopter adds extra lift
(termed "translational lift"), especially at 30-90 kts.

The further you pitch down, the more your speed increases. As your speed
exceeds 100 kts, tranlational lift deceases. The VSI starts to move to the
negative end of the scale. More pitch downward will push you into a dive.

Easy Flight: Lift is unaffected by forward motion. Your altitude remains
constant, and is therefore independent of the cyclic.


Level Flight

Move the cyclic forward or back until the airspeed reads about 120 kts. Now
check the VSI. If you're descending (the indicator is below horizontal), add
more Collective until the indicator is horizontal. Alternately, if you're
ascending, reduce Collective. When the VSI is horizontal, you're in level
flight.

Due to the slow control response, it's easy to over-correct and add or reduce
the collective too much. You'll constantly "chase the needle", trying to
stabilize your flight. After each adjustment, wait a moment for the VSI to
stabilize.

Easy Flight: These adjustments are unnecessary since lift is unaffected by
forward motion.

                                                                  [Page  55]

Changing Altitude

When flying level (about 120 kts), the easiest way to descend is to push the
Cyclic forward (pitch down) into a dive. As you approach the altitude desired,
gently pull the Cyclic back (pitch up) until the VSI again stabilizes.
Similarly, the easiest way to ascend is to pitch up slightly, reducing
airspeed below 100 kts. When you reach the desired altitude, pitch down again
until the VSI stabilizes. This technique is not unlike conventional airplane
flight. You're able to change altitude without adjusting the collective.

A second way to change altitude, applicable at any speed, is to raise or
lower the collective. When you reach the desired altitude, adjust an opposite
amount of collective to regain level flight. This is the only way to change
altitude from a hover.

Regardless of the technique used, don't try to fly the helicopter by
constantly adjusting the collective. Learn to "feel" the correct collective
setting, and then fly with just your cyclic. This takes time, so be patient.
Even real pilots must practice many long hourse before it's mastered.

Easy Flight: The collective must be used to change your altitude; it's just
like choosing the floors on an elevator.


Low Limit

The low altitude limit is a flying aid that warns you of close ground
proximity. It works in conjunction with the radar altimeter, and is displayed
as a red band on the radar altimeter.


Turning

From a level flight (about 120 kts), move the Cyclic slightly to the left.
Your helicopter rolls into a banking left turn. As you turn, observe the
change in your compass heading. Move the Cyclic further left and bank into a
tight turn; you'll now start to lose lift. Notice that your altitude is 
dropping and the VSI is below horizontal. If you center the Cyclic and level
out, you'll return to level flight.

There are two methods to maintain altitude in a tight turn; this could be very
important at low altitudes. Add some Collective before you start the turn,
then reduce the Collective just before you come out of it.

Alternately, pull up your nose slightly as you enter the turn, then drop it
back down as you come out of the turn. With this method, you can make fast,
banking turns without losing altitude.

                                                                  [Page  56]

At speeds below 40 kts, the helicopter will skit ("sideslip") in the direction
of cyclic movement, rather than bank into the turn; at this point, you're
basically flying sideway.

Easy Flight: Altitude is never lost, no matter how tight the turn. However,
the helicopter will sideslip at speeds below 40 kts.


Turbulence

When flying below 100', you may feel air turbulence. You'll sometimes bounce
up and down, or roll from side to side. The amount of air turbulence varies
with altitude and speed; the faster and lower you fly, the more turbulence you
may experience.


Autorotation

Helicopter crewman can't eject or bailout in times of trouble. However, the
total loss of engine power means only one thing - they must ride the bucking
bronco in.

Fortunately, helicopters have the equivalent of an conventional airplane's
"dead stick" landing. This unpowered method of landing is called
"autorotation".

To begin an autorotation, disengage the rotor. In real life the pilot must
also "bottom" the collective (reduce it to zero), but the collective 
automatically bottoms when you disengage the rotor. This must be done
immediately, or the rotor will slow to a stop (remember it's still engaged to
the now-dead engine). If the rotor stops, you'll fall like a baby grand piano.

Now adjust the pitch until your airspeed is about 70 to 90 kts (maximum
tranlational lift). The rotor is now spinning freely because the airflow keeps
the blades turning. The descent will become quite fast, a bit frightening to
the inexperienced. When you get close to the ground, raise the nose and
simultaneously add Collective. The rotor blades will "bite" into the air,
giving you lift and slowing the descent. Unfortunately, as the blades start to
bite, air resistance slows them down.

You must time the "up collective" so that the helicopter lands gently
(figuratively speaking) before the rotor slows too much. If you raise the
collective too soon, the rotor will stall and you'll be playing the piano
again. If you raise the collective too late, you won't slow your descent and
you'll crash. Nobody said it would be easy - it just takes practice.

Easy Flight: Autorotation is not functional with easy flight. It's best to
set "no crashes" when in this mode.

                                                                  [Page  57]

Flight Envelope

There are "unsafe" speed and altitude situations that, in the event of total
engine failure, will unavoidably result in a crash. These unsafe situations
are considered to be outside of the "flight envelope".

Hovering at altitudes from 25' to 500', or high speed flight below 20' to 30'
will probably result in a crash if engine power is lost. It take a certain
amount of time to convert from normal flight to autorotation. In these
situations, there just isn't enough time to gain control.

However, "unsafe" is a relative term. In combat situations unsafe flying is
probably "safer" than taking a hit. During combat, chances must be taken;
evaluate the situation and make the best decision.


Rules of Engagement

Everyone has rules they must abide by, and this is no different in combat.
Helicopters live and fight near ground level, as high altitude is only safe
for the jet jockeys.

The high command wants to assure that you will have a long and distinguished
career. Therefore, your maximum altitude is restricted to 1000' in all
situations. Any higher, and you'd be a sitting duck. 


NAVIGATION


INS System

Pressing the Map View (F10) key displays the high scale mission map. You can
always fly to specific points by dead reckoning or, more simply, you may input
up to three waypoints into the INS system.

To input waypoints, press the Fly To (F) key; a yellow crosshair appears over
your helicopter. Use the Controller to move the crosshair to any point on the
map, and press Selector #1; waypoint #1 is now marked. Press Selector #2 to
stop with less than three waypoints or continue to mark waypoints #2 and #3.
Press esc, at any time, to cancel the waypoints. Existing waypoints are
automatically cancelled whenever the Fly To (F) key is pressed (esc will
cancel the command).

Because the high scale map is only a representation of the actual terrain, you
may want to "fine-tune" the placement of the waypoints. After all, you
wouldn't want to fly into a mountain. Press the spacebar; the low scale map
appears. Use the Controller to follow the path of the waypoints (each waypoint
is marked with its number). To adjust a waypoint, press its number. It's now
centered in the map display. Use the Controller to adjust its placement; press
Selector #2 when finished.

                                                                  [Page  58]

The current INS heading is the flight path to the "active" waypoint. The
waypoint range and heading can be displayed in the MFD. The Next Waypoint
(6) and Previous Waypoint (7) keys are used to change the active waypoint. To
manually adjust your course, always turn towards the INS pip.

Press the Autopilot (5) key at anytime to engage the autopilot. When engaged,
it flies you to the "active" INS waypoint.


Wind and Weather

When flying during windy conditions, the same considerations that apply to an
airplane apply to helicopters. Namely, the wind will increase your speed,
slow you down, and/or push you sideways, depending on your flight path in
relation to the wind velocity and direction. This is most noticeable on long
distance flights.

Temperature also affects helicopter flight. As air gets warmer, it exapnds and
becomes thinner, providing less lift. If the air gets too cold, icing on the
rotor becomes a problem. Similarly, in humid conditions the air is composed of
more water, reducing lift. Finally, as altitude above sea level increases, air
gets thinner, reducing lift. For helicopters, ideal flying conditions are 70
degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius) on a dry day at sea level.


LANDING

The nice thing about helicopters is theri ability to land without a paved
airstrip. However, they can't land on sloping ground. Any slope greater than
5' causes so much rotor tilt that the helicopter flies, or skids away from the
slope, making a landing impossible. NEVER try to land on a hillside - you'll
crash!

Ideally, all landings, and takeoffs for that matter, should be into the wind.
As you approach the base, lower your altitude to about 50' and reduce your
airspeed to 60 kts by pulling back slightly on the Cyclic. You'll need to
reduce the Collective to maintain your 50' altitude. Your goal is to land in
the center of the base. Just before you cross the outside edge of the base,
begin slowing down to a hover by pulling back on the Cyclic. Note that as your
speed drops towards 0 your lift will decrease. Add some Collective to maintain
your altitude.

The wind will tend to push you away from your present position; the Cyclic
should be moved slightly toward the wind, producing just enough skid to
counteract the wind velocity. This will maintain hover against the wind.

                                                                  [Page  59]

Reduce the Collective (easy does it here) to begin your final descent. At
about 20' you may need to reduce the Collective further to acieve touchdown.

Easy Flight: The collective must be used to change your altitude; however,
altitude is unaffected by the cyclic controls.


FARPS

Forward aiming and refueling points (FARP) are highly movile bases designed
to support helicopter operations. They are placed near or around the battle
area, and are usually set to support a particular squadron or mission. They
are well stocked with aviation and a full range of weapons.

Your mission orders indicate if a FARP is available for the current mission.
If available, you may land at the FARP just like any other base. The ground
crew immediately refuels and rearms your helicopter and your flight.

Unfortunately, they're not supermarkets - there's no shopping allowed. Your
helicopters are refueled and rearmed to match your start of mission 
configurations.


Carrier Landings

You may ask what business the Army has at sea? As a member of highly trained,
elite force, you are more than up to the task. Still, carrier based
landings are a little more complicated than your everyday open-field variety.

The landing pad is smaller, and the carrier deck isn't at 0' altitude. The 
radar altimeter is the key instrumentation; it indicates the proper approach
altitude as you center your position over the deck. The other steps are just
like landing on the ground, but be prepared to immediately max the collective
if you've misjudged your approach.


Shut Down

When you have landed at your base (altitude is 0), disengage the rotor. Your
postflight options now appear.

                                                                  [Page  60]

HOW TO FIGHT

Helicopter combat systems have come a long way since the days of door mounted
machine-guns and "wing and a prayer" defensive measures. Contemporary
helicopters possess an extensive array of weapon and defensive systems. Each
has been tailored to specific target type or purpose. It's important to become
familiar with each system's strengths and weaknesses. It'll be the difference
between getting the target or the target getting you!


Flight Plan

Before you takeoff, re-examine the mission map, and decide on a flight path
that will take you to the primary or secondary. Remember, the most obvious
route may end up being the most disastrous. Bounding directly into the target
at 140 kts and 500' of altitude may work in training, but it's suicide against
well-equipped troops.

A standard technique is to fly to the target in short dashes. Fly from behind
one hill to another, then hover and pop up briefly to scan ahead. Drop down,
pick your next destination and repeat the process. Stay as low as possible
when dashing, and use intervening terrain to mask your movement. It may sound
boring, but you'll enjoy the results.

Fuel is a major consideration; it isn't unlimited. Don't stretch yourself to
the point you can't make it back. This is especially important when flying
over water.

Any success quickly turns to failure if you loose your flight to poor fuel
planning. Always know the position of your base and FARP. Don't hesitate to
"top off" your tanks if there's any question.


Threats

As you fly, watch the threat display; the top of the display coincides with
your current heading. A red dot is an opposing ground unit. A blue dot means
an opposing aircraft is approaching. A yellow dot indicates a missile in 
flight. Note that the threat display can't distinguish between friendly and
opposing missiles. A grey dot is a friendly unit or a neutral structure.

When units appear on your threat display, they are also plotted on the maps.
They appear darker when they disappear from your threat display; that's their
last known position.

                                                                  [Page  61]

Though virtually every oppsing unit has some sort of gun or shoulder-
launched missile, the most dangerous are AA guns and vehicles and SAM
vehicles.


Warning Indicators

Watch your warning indicators' they are the true measure of enemy activity.
The "I", "R" and "L" indicators turn or flash red to indicate opposing search
or tracking activity. Additionally, the originating unit's dot on the threat
display automatically changes to a cross, thereby alerting you to the bearing
of the most dangerous threat or threats.


Jammers

When a warning indicator illuminates, the standard response is to turn on the
corresponding jammer; press the Radar Jammer (n) key or IR Jammer (.) key
("L" jammers currently aren't available). A small green light beside the
warning light illuminates, showing your jammer is active. If the warning
indicator turns off, the jamming was successful. Immediately turn onto a new
course, as jammed missiles often continue on their old course.

Keep your jammer active until you destroy or fly away from the threath. It's a
good idea to immediately activate both jammers if the threat concentration is
high.


Decoys

If the warning indicator remains illuminated, try using a decoy; press the
Chaff (m) key or Flare (/) key to launch a decoy. The decoy indicator
illuminates as long as the decoy is active. The decoy should be drawing the
missile or gunnery to its position.


ON THE DEFENSIVE


How They Find You

For a general description of helicopter tactics, see pages 110-112.

Ground based weapons utilize active radar, passive IR or optical means to
search out and find targets.

Search radars can "see" you at long distances in day or night. A distant red
dot on the threat display is probably a search radar. Since the purpose of
search radars is to detect your presence, jammers and decoys are counter-
productive, as both announce your presence!

Other units use short-range passive IR or the old standby - eyesifht. They
can't see you until you're much closer, and at night optical sighting is
especially limited.

                                                                  [Page  62]

All methods of search are blocked by objects on the ground. As a result,
ground-based units have a "dead-zone" they can't see. Above this dead-zone
the "eyes" will eventually find you. This dead zone becomes smaller and lower
as you approach the unit.


How They Track You

If a search is successful, they switch to "tracking" mode. If employing radar,
they constantly illuminate you with a radar beam. This sets off your radar
warning and causes the indicator to solidly illuminate.

When launched, IR weapons set off your IR warning and cause the indicater to
solidly illuminate.

If a laser ranger/designator is "painting" your helicopter, the laser warning
goes off and causes the indicator to solidly illuminate.

If you're being tracked by radar or an IR weaon, use your jammers and decoys.
If that fails try evasive flying.

Dive to a lower altitude while turning parallel to or away from the threat. If
you get lower and avoice closing the range (the dead-zone effect), an enemy
often loses its track. Evasive flying is a superior option to jammers and
decoys, because it doesn't broadcast your position.

Laser guided and visually aimed weapons can't be jammed or decoyed, so evasive
flying is your only defense.


Surviving Triple-A

If they find you, opposing guns will open fire and continue to fire until they
shoot you down. You must either breat the track or destroy the weapon. It's
that simple. If the gunfire is radar controlled, you can probably break the
track with jamming or chaff. However, all guns have optical backup systems
(some have laser systems).

The best way to survive gunfire is skillful evasive flying and dead-eye
firepower.


Surviving Sams

If they find you, SAM equipped units will launch a misisle. Missiles are
either IR-guided, radar-guided or visually-guided. When a missile is in flight
you'll see a yellow dot moving towards you on the threat display.

Passive IR-guided missiles are the most common threat. Your IR warning
indicator illuminates when they approach. Use your jammer or flares to 
"confuse" the missile, but remember to turn away so as not to collide with it.

                                                                  [Page  63]

Sophisticated IR missiles probably have visual or laser back up guidance; 
don't get too elated if you defeat the IR-guidance, there may still be a nasty
surprise in store.

While radar-guided missiles are primarily designed for use against
conventional jet aircraft, they still pose a serious threat. A radar beam
reflecting off your helicopter guides the missile. This radar beam is what
illuminates your radar warning indicator. Use your jammer or chaff to 
"confuse" the missile, but remember to turn away so as not to collide with it.
Just like IR-guided missiles, radar homers probably have back up guidance
systems. Therefore, defeating the radar is just the first step in defeating 
the missile.

Visually or laser-guided missiles are the greatest threats. You have no
effective jammer or decoy defenses; your only bet is evasive flying. Putting
terrain between you and the missile is the best bet. Flying into the dead
zone is the only other hope. Remember, successful evasive flying requires that
you fly lower AND away from the launcher. If you continue flying towards the
launcher, flying lower may not be effective.

After all this, there is some good news. All missiles have one universal weak
point - they have a wide turning radius. If you can get one close, dart off
perpendicular to its flight path; it will be unable to turn fast enough to hit
you. This tactic is easier said than done in a slow moving helicopter (fast-
movers swear by this manoeuvre). It takes enourmous skill, and split second
timing to turn inside of a missile screaming in a Mach 3.

The Appendix includes a summary of the various AAA and SAM systems that await
your pleasure. A description of the search, tracking and missile guidance
system is listed, along with an estimate of their effectiveness.

Study your mission intelligence briefings closely. If necessary, reference the
weapon system to understand its use and effectiveness.


Out at Sea

When out over the water, you have lost the best means of defense - terrain.
You'll need to stay extremely alert, since the opposing patrol craft carry a
number of defense weapons. Stay low or carry long range weapons, such as
Penguin and Maverick.

                                                                  [Page  64]

DAMAGE

If you're unable to "spoof" the threat, the gunfire or missile will probably
hit your helicopter. You'll see the explosion and the shudder of your
helicopter. If the hit was severe, one or more of the system's status lights
will illuminate. Systems will start to malfunction or fail. You'll need to
evaluate the damage to determine if you can continue the mission or need to
return to base.

If you are hit in multiple or critical systems, your helicopter will lose
power. The only way to survive this is to autorotate to a safe landing. The
number of hits required for a general systems failure varies; after three or
four, you should expect the worst.


HELICOPTER WEAPONS


Targeting

Your on-board targeting system is constantly scanning the forward arc; the
system is limited to the front 180'. It can't scan to the rear, so pay close
attention to your flight path, and occasionally swing around to check your
"six".

The targeting system is line-of-sight dependent. As a result, the higher you
are, the farther it can "see". Of course, the higher you are, the easier it is
for the other guys to spot you.

The targeting system automatically "locks" onto the closest target. A diamond
appears in your forward view, and an image of the target, along with its range
and heading data, displays in your MFD. You may switch the target lock, 
assuming others are in the area, by pressing Selector #2. There may be a
momentary delay; the targeting system must re-scan the entire area for new
targets.

When the locked target is within maximum range for the selected weapon, the
target box becomes a solid. This range varies from weapon system to weapon
system, as maximum ranges differ. If you fire at a target before the target
box changes, there's no chance of a hit!


Mast-Mounted Sights

The AH-64B Longbow Apache, OH-58D Kiowa Warrior and the AH-6 Defender are
equipped with a sighting system mounted on top of the main rotor hub. This
system enables these helicopters to "see" at greater ranges. Better yet, they
may peer over the top of intervening terrain without exposing the helicopter.
Press the Mast View (F2) key to switch to mast view; use the Controller to
rotate your view.

                                                                  [Page  65]

Firing

Depending on the weapon selected, a reticle ring or a fixed crosshair appears
in your view. The reticle ring works with "guided" weapons, whereas the
crosshair works with "unguided" weapons.

The reticle ring must be superimposed over the target diamond to accurately
engage the target; adjust your flight path if necessary. It has a range of
movement that represents the angle of offset for the selected weapon. The
reticle ring also becomes larger as the range drops, indicating the 
"confidence" of the shot.

The crosshair is always positioned directly ahead. Unguided weapons always
fly or fire as you bear. Adjust your flight path to coincide with the target
box. There's no question it's a challenge to fire unguided weapons at long
range. Aiming errors, no matter how slight, normally reslut in a miss.

Pressing Selector #1 fires the "active" weapon. Cannons and machine-guns fire
in 20 round bursts. Rockets fire in salvos of 1, 2 or 4. All other weapons
fire singly.


Weapons

The weapon indicator displays the "active" weapon, its position and rounds
remaining; rockets also indicate the current salvo setting. Press the spacebar
to change the active weapon.

All rockets, both gun pods and the AH-6 Defender's integral gun are unguided
weapons; the remaining weapons are all guided.

Certain weapons are only effective against certain target types. The Appendix
includes a summary of the weapon systems, including characteristics and
effectiveness. Familiarize yourself with these systems. There's nothing worse
than blazing away at a target, wasting round after round, only to discover 
that you're using the wrong weapon.

When you fire a cannon or a guided missile, the helicopter bucks and recoils
upward; some altitude will be gained due to the loss in forward motion.

Note: this effect isn't experienced in easy flight mode.

                                                                  [Page  66]

Primaries and Secondaries

If a loced target is part of the primary or secondary mission, a prompt
appears in the MFD along with the other target data.


The CP/G

Your invisible co-pilot/gunner (the front seater - back seater if you're 
flying the AH-66A Comanche) assists you in two ways during the course of a
mission. First, by communicating important system status and threat/target
information; and second, by assuming control of part of the weapon systems
functions. The degree of weapon system control is dependent upon the CP/G
reality switch setting.


ON THE OFFENSIVE

The best thing about helicopters is their ability to approach targets
undetected; they literally live (from a survival standpoint) at nap-of-the-
earth (NOE) altitude - about 100'. They move in and out of the terrain like a
jungle cat stalking its prey.

Sneak up on suspected targets, and use caution. Take a few extra minutes to
evaluate the situation. The pilot that plunges headlong into a combat
situation will more than likely retreat just as quickly with his tail between
his legs. Leave the flamboyant entries to the jet jockeys - they need more
attention, anyway!

If possible, attack from the flank rather than the front; this is referred to
as an enfilade attack. You can engage targets in turn, while limiting the
number that can spot you. If you engage from the front, all of the targets can
spot you simultaneously.

Use long range engagements; the further you stay away, the better. Most of
your weapons are longer-ranged than the opposition's - take advantage of it.

If you only remember one thing, NEVER overfly the target. If you didn't
destroy the target, you're giving away a free shot at your tail.

First and foremost, choose the right tool for the job. Evaluate your mission
orders carefully and outfit your helicopters with the most advantageous mix of
weapons. For example, if you're ordered to intercept enemy shipping, you may
want to take a few Penguins or Mavericks along for the ride.

                                                                  [Page  67]

Weapons

Once in combat, make sure that the "active" weapon is the most effective
choice. Don't try to fire Sidewinders at tanks or TOWs at aircraft.

Cannons: are close range weapons that are best fired straight ahead. They lack
the penetrative power of cannons, and therefore are only effective against
unarmored targets.

Machine-guns: are very close range weapons, and can only be fired straight
ahead. They lack the penetrative power of cannons, and therefore are only
effective against unarmored targets.

Rockets: are available in three types. Each is best suited for a particular
type of target, but can be effective against other target types. They're
unguided weapons, and are therefore easier to fire at close range. However,
they can be fired in salvos, and you can carry a fair number.

ATGMs: are also available in three types. They're powerful anti-armor weapons
that can be effectively utilized against structures, ships and even slow
moving aircraft.

TOW is a wire-guided weapon that's steered to the target. It's not as
difficult as it may seem. As long as the target is locked, corrections to the
missile's flight path are automatically calculated and transmitted to the TOW
over the unspooling wire. However, the wire is the biggest limitation - it
runs out at about 3,800 meters.

HellFire-A is a laser designated weapon that homes in on reflected laser light
It's much longer ranged than the TOW and has a wider target envelope. Since
the Hellfire "sees" the reflected light, the designation can be switched to a
different target; if it's within the target envelope, the Hellfire will hit 
the new target. This allows for "ripple fire" tactics. Multiple missiles are
fired at short intervals; after the first hits, the designator "spots" the
new target, and then guides the second missile.

                                                                  [Page  68]

Lasers are not as effective during low visibility conditions. Rain, fog and
snow can reflect some or all of the laser light limiting range and hit
probabilities. There's another disadvantage; if you're designating your own
target, you must also expose the helicopter until the Hellfire hits the target

Hellfire-B is the latest version of this effective weapon system. It's the
primary armament on Longbow Apaches; it can't be carried on Model-A Apaches.
It replaces the laser homer with a fire-and-forget millimeter wave radar
homer. All you do is find the target, and fire the missile - it doesn't get
any easier. This combined with the Longbow's mast mounted sight makes for a
potent, unbeatable combination.

Sidearm: is designed to home in on any surface radar emission source;
therefore, it's classifed as an "anti-radiation missile". Its big brothers,
HARM, Standard and Shrike, have been utilized to great effect on conventional
aircraft for years. Now, helicopters possess a similar punch. You don't have
to get a target lock to fire a Sidearm; just make sure to fire it towards the
radar source. It's fragmentation warhead and fire-andforget technology make
it one terrific "quick-draw" weapon - a surefire way to permanently cancel
that radar.

The Big Loads: Maverick and Penguin are heavyweight special purpose weapons.
Their use in helicopters is shrouded in controversy; some argue they're not
worth their weight. The opponents fell that Hellfire is just as effective, and
you can carry 4 Hellfires for every 1 Maverick or Penguin. On the other hand
Maverick and Penguin are both longer ranged than the Hellfire and are fire-and
forget weapons. The arrival of Hellfire-B makes the argument even hotter -
the decision is yours.


Masking

Not what you'll wear to your next costume party, it's the method of terrain
shielding often called the "pop up". It's also where the auto-hover pays for
its weight. It automatically maintains your present position and altitude
even in the face of a stiff wind.

Pull up behind a convenient hill position and drop your airspeed to 0; your
altitude should be about 100' - 150'. As your airspeed approaches 8-10 kts (it
must be 10 kts or less), press the Auto-Hover (0) key; this immediately
reduces your airspeed to 0.

                                                                  [Page  69]

Now press the Collective Up (=) key to start a slow ascent. As you clear the
crest of the hill, stop your ascent. If your helicopter is equipped with a 
mastmounted sight, stop the ascent just as the sight clears the hill. You're
now in position to scan the surrounding area.

If you lock onto an important target engage it immediately, and then drop down
below the crest; press the Collective Down (-) key. Otherwise, drop below the
crest and re-evaluate the situation. If necessary, check the mission map. You
may need to adjust your flight path, or unmask again to engage the other 
targets.

As an alternative approach, rotate the helicopter left or right by moving the
Cyclic left or right. Then push the Cyclic ahead slightly to add a few knots
of airspeed. Try to keep your airspeed under 10 kts. As you clear the side of
the hill, press the Auto-Hover (0) key, and rotate back to the forward area.
After scanning the area or engaging the targets, reverse the process (with a
little more haste this time), and duck back behind the hill. While this 
method of unmasking limits the scanning range, due to low altitude, it's an
excellent method of engaging known targets - longer ranged targets probably
won't spot you.

Remember with auto-hover active, you can quickly drop altitude by virtually
bottoming the collective; it holds you at the low limit.


Targets

Your missions present a number of target options, each with unique character-
istics requiring different tactics of engagement or weapon selection.
Always look before you shoot; the high command gets real upset when you start
shooting upon the friendlies.

AAA & SAMs: are your biggest challenge. These are the only targets that can
fire back with any real effect. Getting in the first shot is the key here.
Both types have reaction times of 5 to 20 seconds, depending on the 
sophistication of equipment and the skill of the crew. If you plan your
attack carefully, you can "take them out" before they even get a shot off.

                                                                  [Page  70]

Tanks & Light Vehicles: can be a turkey shoot. Attack helicopters, especially
the Apache, are made to destroy tanks and vehicles. The tanks don't carry
anything larger than a short range 14.5mm machine-gun; you can pick them
off easily. IFVs and APCs can be a bit nastier; they carry shoulder-launched
SAMs. Most of the other vehicles, such as truck convoys, are totally unarmed.

This may seem to good to be true, but before you think it's a cakewalk, the
opposition has also recognized these weaknesses. Groups of tanks and other
vehicles normally travel with AAA & SAM vehicles. Keep an eye out for these
escorts.

Working on the Railroad: doesn't get any easier than this. Railroad "rolling
stock" isn't much of a challenge, but important none the less. You know where
they are and where they must go; it's just a matter laying in wait and taking
them out of action.

Naval Targets: can get quite pesky, and the opposition has a habit of placing
armed forces on their oil platforms. Guided weapons are a must in these
situations. They are better suited todeal with the maneuverable patrol craft,
and you need their punch to take out the oil platforms.

Infantry: are difficult to spot and root out. They're only armed with light
weapons, but most also carry shoulder-launched SAMs. Rockets and cannon/
machine-gun fire are a good choice in this case.

Structures: pose problems similar to infantry. Although bigger and easier to
spot, they are seldom undefenced. SAMs and all types of AAA guns are usually
in the Vicinity. If you pick off the defenders first, the structures are then
fair game.

Bunkers and bridges are especially tough nuts to crack. It may take more than
one hit to destroy them.

                                                                  [Page  71]

AIR-TO-AIR COMBAT

When helicopters were first envisioned as combat weapons, the importance of
air-to-air combat was all but overlooked in the USA. Unfortunately, the Soviet
planners were not so shortsighted.

The Soviets have always placed a strong emphasis on air-to-air combat, and
have made concerted efforts to design this capability into their helicopters.
Many in the US Intelligence community consider the new Ka-34 Hokum to be a
purpose built "anti-helicopter" helicopter.

Fortunately, the US military planners are no longer ignoring this all too
important technology. Air-to-air weapons have become a standard load when
flying where air superiority is in doubt. The new AH-66A Comanche is designed
with a high degree of air combat functionality; it's closer in concept to
high-performance jet aircraft than past helicopter designs.

In actual air-to-air combat, one facet that requires constant vigilance is a
helicopter's ability to spring from nowhere. It's on you before you know what
is happening, snaps off a missile and vanishes in the wink of an eye.

Helicopter borne air-to-air missiles are the primary threat. They come in all
varieties of homers, and are usually more maneuverable than ground based
weapons. The helicopters also carry machine-guns or cannons. Unit for unit,
they can pack just as strong a punch as the friendlies.

In Chapter 3, Helicopter Tactics, a number of the tactical maneuvers key to
air-to-air combat, are discussed and diagrammed, but it essentially boils down
to a few specific factors:

Altitude: Stay low! Aircraft like nothing more than to find a helicopter 
flying up where only the eagles should dare. It's bad enough exposing yourself
to the ground fire, but it's murder against aircraft.

Take the First Shot: If you can get the first shot in, you have the best
chance of coming out on top. Pay attention to the threat display, and stay 
ready to snap off a quick shot.

                                                                  [Page  72]

Range: Fire at the longest range possible. This gives you a chance to 
reposition and take additional shots. Additionally, if they have ordnance in
the iar, it gives more time to counter or evade.

Hold the Advantage: Get on the aircraft's tail or keep it to your front. NEVER
lose sight of the enemy! If they get on your tail, use a side flare or a
horizontal scissors to revers the advantage. If necessary, use the Left View
(F3) key or Right View (F4) key to maintain visual contact.


WEAPONS

There aren't as many decisions to make with air-to-air weapons. They are
adaptions of existing weapon systems. To date, the first purpose built
helicopter AAM is yet to be seen.

Cannons: is the choice for close quarters. The Apaches, SuperCobra and
Comanche use their helmeted mounted sights to maintain lock-on during tight
twists and turns. Fixed-firing cannons can still be effective, especially
with tail shots. Don't waste your time with machine-guns; when you're up
against gunships, their armor can't be penetrated.

Sidewinder: the father of the Sidearm, is one of the most successful and
tested weapon systems in service. It's a highly maneuverable, fire-and-forget
IR homer. It's long-ranged and packs a potent warhead. Like Sidearm, you don't
have to get a target lock; just make sure to fire it towards the IR source.
Long range multiple engagements are a simple process; just disperse the 
missiles so they don't home in on the same target.

Stinger: may be about half the weight of Sidewinder, but is certainly more
than up to the task. You can also carry twice as many Stingers as Sidewinders
you never know when you may need those extra shots. While it may be shorter
ranged, it'll reach just about every thing you can see. Some targets may take
two hits, but those should be few and far between.

Helstreak: is a British import that's derived from the ground-based Starstreak
SAM. It's carried by the Longbow Apache and the Comanche. It's not a fire-
and-forget system; laser guidance must be provided by the launching helicopter
Therfore, a lock-on must be attained prior to launch. On the plus side, it
flies faster than Sidewinder and Stinger, which reduces the exposure time.
It's three element warhead covers a broad area, so close is probably good

                                                                  [Page  73]

enough. As an added advantage, it can also fire at ground targets. Its 
warheads can pierce most medium weight armor.


Targets

Helicopters: For the most part, Stingers and Helstreaks are more than adequate
It's the rare case where one shot won't do the trick; Sidewinders may be
overkill. Don't discount Hellfires in a pinch. If the helicopter isn't moving
too fast, you can reasonably maintain a lock, especially from hover. When you
get in close, switch to cannon and "hose" them down. M255 rockets can also
be a nasty surprise!

                                                                  [Page  74]

HELICOPTER FLIGHT COMMANDS

The essence of Gunship 2000 is the multi-helicopter operations. Through this
mechanism, you direct the flying, combat and support functions of the other
four helicopters in your flight. It's a simple, straightforward, yet powerful
process that's executed through a series of single key commands.

After receiving your commission, the door opens to this challenging and
exciting process.


SYSTEM SUMMARY

Press the Map View (F10) key to access the flight commands menu. The commands
are listed across the bottom of the screen. Commands available to the "active"
section or helicopter display "brightly".

As you toggle through the helicopters, information relating to the "active"
helicopter displays along the left side. The combat data link system
automatically tracks key helicopter systems and mutually transmits this data
via its communication link to all helicopters in the flight.


Damage Schematic

The schematic helicopter diagram graphically displays damage to helicopter
systems. A yellow burst over a system indicates damage; a red burst indicates
system failure.

The Rotor, tail rotor, left wing, right wing, left engine, right engine and
cannon indicate damage in their respective positions. Optics are located in 
the nose and/or mast mounted sight; avionics are located in the tail boom; and
fuel cells are located below the cockpit positions. While these positions
may not be true location in all helicopter types, the consistency helps speed
recognition.


Helicopter Status

The helicopter's current orders and key system indicators display below the
damage scematic.
