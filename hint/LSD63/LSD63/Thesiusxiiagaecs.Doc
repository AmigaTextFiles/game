	The year is 2131, for the last half century peace has been upheld
 throughout the affiliated humankind planets by the United Human League of
 Civilizations. The peace was recently shattered when an evil splinter
 political faction attempted a military coup. Luckily the plot was detected
 early enough and was quickly quelled. 

	In the aftermath of the failed coup attempt the four main political
