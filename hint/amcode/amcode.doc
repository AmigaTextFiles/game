This program decodes and encodes savefiles of the game Ambermoon, which
enables an experienced user to edit them with a binary-editor. This
program seems not to be necessary for some versions of Ambermoon, that
do not encode their savefiles. At least the german version I got made
it necessary to decode them. Better test this on a dummy savefile or
make a backup of the files first - you have been warned!

Usage: amcode <sourcefile> <destfile>

The coding is bi-directional, so an encoded file will be decoded when using
this program and a decoded file will be encoded.

Thanx to the authors of Ambermoon for a great fantasy-game.
Buy it! Its worth hours of playing!
