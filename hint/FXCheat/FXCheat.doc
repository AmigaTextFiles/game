FXCheat is little hack that will make you rich (well you know what I mean).
If you play UFO and need more money here is simple solution .

 * DISCLAMER *
---------------

Use this on your OWN RISK !!! If this hack cause some damage to you HD it's
your problem :) . You have been warned !!!
This is FREEWARE so you can distribute it with documentation (if the contents
are unchanged) for as long as you DON'T charge any money for it !!!

 * INSTALLATION *
------------------

Simply copy FXCheat , FXCheat.info & FXCheat.doc to UFO directory.
Ex:
If you have UFO in work:games/UFO then copy this files to that
directory. To be more precise FXCheat needs to have access to Game_x dirs!
x = 1 , 2 , 3 ...

 * USAGE *
-----------

It's simple too. First change amount of money , then change "save number"
to one that you want.
Ex:
You have saved game to first save mark ( that's one that has number 1 on it
*for morons only* ), so save number shoud be 1 ...

Then press START to begin saving and that's it !!!!
If you get "Save error" message then you've probably put FXCheat at wrong
place!

 * P.S. *
----------

Yeah, I know it's old game. I wrote this hack for personal use LONG time
ago and I didn't meant to send it to public until my friend persuaded me
( you know stick & stuff ) that it would be nice to do that :)
I have same hack for Reunion ( OK, it's old too ), but if there will be
demands for it I'll put it to public too .
FXCheat is 100% assembler code so if you have problems on your A4000 or
accelerated Amigas write to me, and MAYBE I'll fix it :)
