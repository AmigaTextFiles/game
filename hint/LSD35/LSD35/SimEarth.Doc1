			   INTRODUCTION
			   ============ 
 

 "is this a random world or did you planet ? " - THe most pondered
question by Sim-Earthling philosophers.

WHAT IS SIM-EARTH ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


SimEarth is a planet simulator--a model of a planet. It is a game, an 
educational toy, and an enjoyable tool. With SimEarth you can take over 
many included planets, or design and create your own. 

SimEarth is based on the Gaia theory by James Lovelock, which suggests 
that we look at our planet and the life on it as a whole, and not as 
separate areas of study. 

SimEarth treats the planet as a whole: life, climate, the atmosphere, 
and the planet itself--from dirt and rock to the molten core all affect 
each other. 

You will see your planet as a whole--from a satellite's point of view, 
at two levels of magnification. 

SimEarth can be played in two modes: game and experimental. In game mode, 
you will try to develop, manage, and preserve your planet within allotted 
energy budgets. 

In experimental mode, you are given unlimited energy to mold your 
planet. This allows you to set up any type of planet in any stage 
of development, and then introduce any new factors you want and see 
what happens. In this mode SimEarth is a "planetary spreadsheet." 

Your SimEarth planets will be populated by electronic life-forms called 
SimEarthlings--cousins of the Sims who populate SimCity  (another fine 
product from Maxis). SimEarthlings range from single celled 
plants and animals to intelligent species. 

Intelligent SimEarthlings are not limited to Humans--or even Mammals. There 
can be intelligent Dinosaur SimEarthlings, intelligent Mollusk 
SimEarthlings, even intelligent Insect SimEarthlings--but only one 
intelligent life-form at a time. 

A single planet can be populated by billions and billions of 
SimEarthlings. Their welfare is in your hands. 

		     		> 2 <


WHAT IS GAIA?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Gaia is a theory about the evolution of the Earth. A theory that sees 
the evolution of the species of organisms by natural selection and the 
evolution of the rocks, air and oceans as a single tightly coupled 
process. In Gaia the organisms and their material environment together 
constitute a system which is able to self-regulate climate and 
atmospheric composition. 


The fact that the Earth's mean temperature has remained constant and 
favourable for life for 3.6 billion years in spite of a rise in 
output of heat from the Sun of 25%, and the fact that oxygen has 
remained close to 21% of our atmosphere for 200 million years, can be 
explained by Gaia theory but not by conventional science. Although it 
is a scientific theory, the name Gaia was proposed by the novelist 
William Golding. 

Gaia became visible through the new knowledge about the Earth gained from 
space and from the extensive investigations of the Earth's surface, oceans 
and atmosphere during the past few decades. This view has in it 
something of the poetic metaphor of a ship held by the sailors, but it 
is also a hard science theory of our planet that came from a top-down 
view from space. This theory is now up for trial, and the evidence 
gathered from the Earth itself will decide on whether or not it 
should be taken as scientific fact. Don't be misled by those who argue 
that Gaia is untestable or teleological and therefore in error; their 
criticism is mere opinion based on prejudice, not evidence. Even if 
in the end Gaia should turn out to be no more than a poetic metaphor, 
it would still have been worth thinking of the Earth as a living system. 
Such thoughts have already led to discoveries about the Earth that could 
not have come from conventional wisdom. 

Gaia is a top-down view of the Earth as a single system, and is essentially 
physiological. It is about the working of the whole system, not with 
the separated parts of a planet divided arbitrarily into the biosphere, the 
atmosphere, the lithosphere and the hydrosphere. These are not real 
divisions of the Earth; they are spheres of influence inhabited by 
academic scientists. 

All I ask is that you concede that there might be something in the 
Gaia theory, which sees the Earth as a living system, to acknowledge 
Gaia at least for the purpose of argument. I do not expect you to become 
converts to a new Earth religion. I do not ask you to suspend your 
common sense. All that I do ask is that you consider Gaia theory as 
an alternative to the conventional wisdom of a dead planet made of 
inanimate rocks, ocean and atmosphere merely inhabited by life. 
Consider it as a real system, comprising all of life and all of its 
environment tightly coupled so as to form a self-regulating entity. 
Maybe you already have it in mind when you use that vague, ill-defined 
word "Biosphere" that seems to have a different meaning for each occasion 
of its use. 

				> 3 <

I recognise that to view the Earth as if it were alive is just a 
convenient, but different, way of organising the facts of the Earth. I 
am of course prejudiced in favour of Gaia and have filled my life for 
the past 25 years with the thought that Earth may be alive: not as the 
ancients saw her--a sentient Goddess with a purpose and foresight--but 
alive like a tree. A tree that quietly exists, never moving except to 
sway in the wind, yet endlessly conversing with the sunlight 
and the soil. Using sunlight and water and nutrient minerals to grow 
and change. But all done so imperceptibly, that to me the old oak tree 
on the green is the same as it was when I was a child. 

			----------------------

SOFTWARE TOYS AND SYSTEM SIMULATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Software Toys
-------------
SimEarth isn't exactly a game...it's what we call a "Software Toy." Toys, 
by definition, are more flexible and open-ended than games. 

As an example, compare a game, tennis, with a toy, a ball. In 
every tennis game, there is one way to begin, one goal to pursue, and 
one way to end. There are infinite variations in the middle, but they 
all start the same way, chase the same goal, and end the same way. 

A ball is more flexible--there are more things you can do with it. 
With the ball, you can play tennis. You can play catch. You can throw it 
at someone. You can bounce it. You can make up a hundred different 
games using the ball. 

Our Software Toys are programmable. Using the comparison with a ball, this 
means that you can change the tennis ball into a football, baseball, 
soccer ball, Ping Pong ball, etc., and play any and all the games you 
play with those balls. 

Besides games, there are other things you can do with a ball. You can 
paint it, use it to plug a leaky roof, or just contemplate 
its roundness (Fukkin heavy shit this h0h0!).

In SimEarth, the "toy" is a planet--a programmable planet that can 
become an infinite number of planets. 

So when you play with SimEarth, or any of our Software Toys, don't 
limit yourself to trying to "win." Play with it. Experiment. Try new 
things. Just have fun. 

				> 4 <


SYSTEM SIMULATIONS
------------------
There are many types of toys. SimEarth, like SimCity before it, is 
a SYSTEM SIMULATION toy. In a system simulation, we provide you with 
a set of RULES and TOOLS that describe, create and control a system. 
In the case of SimEarth, the system is a planet. 

Part of the challenge of playing with a SYSTEM SIMULATION toy is to 
figure out how the system works and take control of it. As master of 
the system you are free to use the TOOLS to create and control an 
unlimited number of systems (in this case, planets) within the framework 
provided by the RULES. 

In SimEarth, the RULES to learn are based on global systems and management, 
including: 

 Chemical Factors  : atmospheric composition, energy management
 Geological Factors: climate, extraterrestrial collisions, continental 
                     drift, earthquakes
 Biological Factors: formation of life, evolution, food supply, biome 
		     types and distribution
 Human Factors     : wars, civilization, technology, waste control, 
		     pollution, food supply, energy supply.

The TOOLS provide you with the ability to create, modify and manage 
a planet: 

   Create a planet in any of four Time Scales.
   Physically modify the landscape of the planet.
   Set the altitude of any spot on the planet.
   Trigger events on the planet from hurricanes to volcanoes to meteor 
   strikes.
   Plant various biomes and life-forms anywhere on the planet.
   Nurture a species to help it evolve intelligence.
   Manage your planet by making use of the available maps and graphs.

But the most important TOOL of all is the simulator itself. Test your 
plans, theories and ideas as you watch your planet develop or 
decline. Customise the simulation by changing the rules that control 
the geosphere, the atmosphere, the biosphere, and civilization, to suit 
yourself or test life's adaptability to various conditions. 

				> 5 <


SIMULATION LIMITATIONS AND BIASES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SIMULATION LIMITATIONS
----------------------

Anything as complicated as the Earth or an animal or even a city cannot be 
completely defined by formulas and equations. Any model of something this 
complicated cannot be completely accurate--but if you are aware of the 
inaccuracies, the model can still be useful. 

A street map is a model of a city. It isn't a completely accurate 
representation of every detail of a city, but, within its limitations, 
it's very useful. Most of us would be lost without one. 

As a simulation of a real planetary system, SimEarth is a rough 
caricature--an extreme simplification. We simulate many different 
aspects of a planet, including climate, evolution, atmospheric 
composition, and civilization, all on a personal computer. 

A truly accurate simulation for a climate model alone has not yet 
been realised even on today's most powerful super-computers. We designed 
this simulation as accurately as we could while maintaining 
compatibility with personal computers and including a gaming aspect. 

A major limitation to this program is how evolution is treated. It 
closely follows Earth's evolution. With very few exceptions, all the 
life-forms represented here actually exist or existed on Earth. While 
allowing many differences in which species succeed or fail--and eventually 
gain sentience--the path from single-celled life to complex life is 
roughly the same as on Earth. 

Also, whatever species becomes intelligent--Mammal, Dinosaur, Fish, 
etc.-- will develop civilizations, cities and technologies that 
greatly resemble Human civilizations, cities and technologies. 

BIASES
-------
SimEarth is based on the Gaia theory, as proposed by James Lovelock. Gaia 
theory is controversial, and not an accepted truth in all 
scientific circles. 

For this game, we are also making a few assumptions that are not 
necessarily true. One of these assumptions is that intelligence is 
an evolutionary advantage--we might just be flattering ourselves. 

				> 6 <

The simulator in SimEarth is a very complex piece of modelling software. 
It is constantly performing many checks, calculations and updates, as 
well as keeping watch on the mouse and keyboard to respond to your demands. 

When you load in a planet, give the simulator a minute or two to compile and 
update maps and graphs. 

When you make adjustments to the MODEL CONTROL PANELS, allow some time 
for the changes to take effect. 

Simulator reaction time is also greatly affected by your computer's 
clock speed and type of microprocessor. 

			----------------------

GOALS OF SIM EARTH
===================

SCENARIOS
~~~~~~~~~
Each of the seven included scenario planets is actually a game in 
itself that can be played at three levels of difficulty or in 
experimental mode. Each scenario will present you with different 
challenges in planet management. 

TESTING THE GAIA HYPOTHESIS--DAISYWORLD 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One of the main tenets of the Gaia hypothesis is that life itself 
regulates the conditions on Earth that support life, including 
temperature and atmospheric content. 

One of the scenarios, Daisyworld, is a simplified simulation with 
only eight life-forms: differently shaded daisies. This scenario is 
based on the original Daisy-world computer model James Lovelock 
designed to explain the Gaia hypothesis. 

Experimenting with the Daisyworld Scenario will give you a visual 
demonstration of the concept of Gaia and of life on Earth as a 
self-regulating whole. 

A complete description of how and why the Daisyworld model works is found 
later in this manual, in the "Scenarios" chapter. 

TAKING ON THE ROLE OF GAIA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you play any of the scenarios or random planets at the most difficult 
level, all Gaian self-regulation will be disabled. You will have 
to constantly monitor and adjust everything on the planet to keep 
life in existence. 

				> 7 <


YOUR OWN PLANETS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Besides the scenarios, you can create an unlimited number of different planets, 
at various levels of difficulty. 

FUN AND CHALLENGE 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Running a planet is a real challenge for even an experienced gamer.

OTHER GOALS
~~~~~~~~~~~
Design, modify, manage, and nurture a planet from creation through 
formation of the oceans, to the appearance of life, through the 
evolution of life, through the development of intelligence and 
technology, to the point where your SimEarthlings can reach for the 
stars. 

 Set up a planetary situation and just watch what happens. 

 Choose and help a particular species gain mastery of the planet. 

 Influence the life to keep it from destroying itself and the planet. 

Perhaps the ultimate goal of SimEarth is for you to design, manage and 
maintain the planet of your dreams. Your ideal planet may be a 
high-tech society of intelligent humans (or intelligent dinosaurs) or a 
limited-technology planet where the biosphere is never endangered. 

YOUR OWN GOALS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It's your toy--you make the rules. You don't need a goal if you 
don't want one. Just play. 

			----------------------

ABOUT THIS MANUAL
=================

This manual has two functions: to teach you how to use SimEarth and to 
introduce you to the basics of Earth Science. 


The majority of this manual describes the program SimEarth: how it 
works, how to use it, how it deals with life, climate, geology, atmospheric 
composition, civilization, etc. 

The Introduction to Earth Science section of this manual deals with 
many of the same things as they are in the real world, out of the 
context of SimEarth. 

This manual covers the SimEarth program for all computers. Any machine-
specific information for installing, starting, or using SimEarth 
will be found on the included system card/addendum. 

				> 8 <


ABOUT ENERGY
============

In SimEarth there are two uses of energy. You, the player, use it 
to make, mold, modify and manipulate the planet, and civilized 
SimEarthlings make and use it to carry on their daily lives. A complete 
explanation of energy and its uses in SimEarth is found in the 
"Energy" chapter of this manual. 

SIMEARTHLING USE OF ENERGY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Intelligent SimEarthlings will produce and use energy. You can control 
their choice of energy sources and their use of the energy they 
produce, but you don't have direct access to their energy for your 
purposes. 

YOUR USE OF ENERGY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Depending on the difficulty level of the game, you will have different 
amounts of energy to affect the planet and the simulation. These 
amounts are both your starting supply and the maximum you can 
accumulate at any one time. 

If you are in experimental mode, you will have an unlimited supply of 
energy.

Energy for a game comes from the stores of the planet itself in the 
form of geothermal, wind, and solar energy, as well as fossil fuels. As 
you deplete your energy supplies during a game, they will slowly build 
back up over time as the planet increases its energy from the above 
sources. This continual tapping of the planet's energies happens 
automatically. 

Once life on your planet becomes intelligent, you will automatically 
tap some of their energy. You can't just take the energy: a certain 
amount will be added to your supply along with the energy tapped from 
the planet itself. 

The higher the level of technology on your planet, the more energy 
you will receive.

			   GETTING STARTED
			   ===============

"All the world's a simulation and all the Sims and Simearthlings
 merely players" - William Simspeare.

INSTALLING SIM EARTH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Please refer to the enclosed system card and machine-specific addendum for 
installation instructions (ALREADY RELEASED SO I AINT DONE IT!).

GETTING HELP
~~~~~~~~~~~~
SimEarth is a fairly complex program, with lots of windows, icons, buttons, 
options, and control panels. To make your simulating experience easier, 
there is a lot of help information included in the program. 

THE HELP FUNCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Any time you want or need help, or aren't sure what something in the program 
does, ask for help. Whenever you hold down the SHIFT KEY, you are in help 
mode, and the cursor changes to /\HELP. Then click on anything anywhere 
in SimEarth, and you will get a help message. 

THE GLOSSARY
~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is an on-line glossary that defines many of the words in the SimEarth 
program. 

To access the glossary, open the WINDOWS MENU, and select GLOSSARY. 

There is also a Glossary in the Appendix section of this manual. 

THE TUTORIALS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is a tutorial section in this manual. There is also 
an on-line abbreviated version of the tutorial. 

The on-line text-based tutorial is accessed by selecting TUTORIAL from the 
WINDOWS MENU. You can even keep the TUTOIAL WINDOW open on the 
screen while playing the game, and refer to it whenever you need. 

Depending on your computer, you may or may not be able to have the on-line 
tutorial open at the same time as other HELP WINDOWS. 

				> 12 <

STARTING THE PROGRAM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Please refer to the system card or machine-specific addendum for 
instructions in starting SimEarth. 

The first time you start the program, you will see three windows: the TITLE 
WINDOW, which goes away as soon as you click the mouse, the EDIT WINDOW, 
which is your main planetary work space, and a HELP WINDOW, which will tell 
you how to get started and how to get more help. 

Whenever you start SimEarth, there will be no active planet. You 
will have to select either NEW PLANET or LOAD PLANET from the FILE 
MENU before the simulation will really start. This is to give you a 
chance to look around, play with the various windows and controls, and 
prepare yourself before things start to happen. 

The following Tutorial section will guide you through the basics of 
planet creation and manipulation. 

				> 13 <


			       TUTORIAL
			       ========

"Fools make a mock of Sim", simproverbs xiv.9


INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The purpose of this tutorial is to give you a quick tour of SimEarth's 
menus, windows, and planet manipulation tools. It won't give every 
detail of every item in the program. For in-depth explanations of 
everything in the program see the Reference section of this manual. 

			----------------------

BASIC CONCEPTS
==============
Before beginning the tutorial, here are a few basic concepts and terms 
to get you started. 

GAIA THEORY
~~~~~~~~~~~
SimEarth is based on the Gaia theory. Everything in the program is 
interrelated: climate, animals, plants, and the planet itself all affect 
each other. 

A brief explanation of the Gaia theory is given in the Introduction in 
the chapter "What is Gaia?" A demonstration of how Gaia works is found in 
the Daisyworld section of the "Scenarios" chapter. 

PLANET
~~~~~~
The term "planet" refers to the present planet, world, or scenario that 
is loaded into memory and is being simulated. 

You will view your planet from a satellite's point of view at two 
different magnifications, and as either a flat robinson projection 
or a globe. 

SIMULATION/SIMULATOR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In SimEarth and this manual, we use the terms "simulation" and "simulator" 
to Represent the part of the program that is modelling the planet. When 
you change or modify the simulation, you are changing variables and 
parameters in the model, which in turn change the planet. 

The ability to modify the simulation is a powerful tool both for the 
gaming aspect and the experimental "planetary spreadsheet" aspect 
of SimEarth. 

				> 16 <



INPUT AND OUTPUT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SimEarth is a very complicated program. An important part of understanding 
it is knowing where you can INPUT (change the planet or simulation), and 
where you find OUTPUT (results of your INPUT). 

There are three places for INPUT:

  The FILE MENU for creating or loading planets;
  The EDIT WINDOW for making local changes to spots on the planet; and
  The MODEL CONTROL PANELS for modifying the simulation and changing the 
  planet globally. 

The MODEL CONTROL PANELS are the only places in SimEarth that are INPUT 
only. 

Everything else all the maps and graphs, even the EDIT WINDOW--supplies 
OUTPUT. 

TIME LIMIT
~~~~~~~~~~
In SimEarth, as on the real Earth, the level of solar radiation is 
continually increasing. You only have 10 billion years before the planet 
gets so hot that all life on it will die. 

Technically, the Sun cools off as it expands into a red giant. As it 
expands, it gets closer to the planet. From the planet's position, 
the solar radiation is increasing even though the Sun is cooling. 

TIME SCALES
~~~~~~~~~~~
There are four Time Scales in SimEarth: Ceologic, Evolution, Civilised, and 
Technology. Each Time Scale simulates different periods of a planet's 
development at different rates of speed. 

You can begin a planet in any Time Scale, or start at the first 
(Ceologic) and guide your planet through them all. A certain amount 
of development must occur before advancing to the next one. 

BIOMES
~~~~~~
Biomes are ecological systems of plants and animals, such as Forest, 
Desert and Jungle. Where a particular biome can survive depends on 
temperature, rainfall and altitude. For the most part, biomes are used 
in SimEarth to represent the plant life of a planet. 

				> 17 <

LIFE
~~~~
Life-forms in SimEarth (SimEarthlings) range from single-celled 
microbes in the ocean to complex, intelligent animals. Any multicellular 
life-form in SimEarth can become intelligent. 

Life will begin and evolve automatically in SimEarth. To a great extent, 
you can affect the evolutionary path that life follows on your planet. 

There are 15 classes of life represented in SimEarth. Each class of 
life has 16 species. There are 240 possible forms of life, but not all 
of them will develop or survive on any given planet. 

The symbols that represent life in the EDIT WINDOW stand for a large 
population of that life-form--not just one animal. 

Each form of life has favourite biomes where it flourishes, and others 
where it cannot survive at all. 

The level of development of life controls the advancement of Time Scales. 

CIVILIZATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Eventually, one type of SimEarthling will attain sentience. When this 
happens, civilization begins. With civilization comes many new issues 
and problems to deal with. 

SimEarth simulates civilization with cities at seven levels of technology 
ranging from the Stone Age of the distant past to the Nanotech Age of 
the future. 

ENERGY 
~~~~~~~
There are two uses of energy in SimEarth: yours and the SimEarthlings.

You use energy each time you change the planet in the EDIT WINDOW or the 
MODEL CONTROL PANELS. Creating and nurturing your planet within your 
energy budget is one of the challenges of SimEarth. 

Intelligent SimEarthlings produce and use energy. You can control 
their energy production and use, but it's theirs--you can't use their 
energy for planet manipulation. 

				> 18 <

HELP AND THE GLOSSARY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On-line help is available anywhere at any time in SimEarth. To access 
help, hold down the SHIFT KEY and click somewhere on the screen. A text 
window will appear with the information you need. 

One special use of the HELP WINDOW is the GLOSSARY. There may be some 
words that you don't know in this program. If you choose GLOSSARY from 
the WINDOWS MENU, a glossary of the words and terms used in this program 
will appear in the HELP WINDOW. 

			----------------------

ABOUT THIS TUTORIAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This tutorial will be presented in three sections: 

FIRST LOOK will introduce you to the various menus, windows, graphs, and 
 control panels. 

CREATING AND MODIFYING PLANETS will teach you how to create and save 
 planets; change the landform of a planet; place and move biomes, life 
 and cities on a planet; and trigger events such as volcanoes and 
 earthquakes. 

MODIFYING THE SIMULATION shows how you can use the MODEL CONTROL 
 PANELS to change global conditions on your planet. 


				> 19 <

FIRST LOOK:
~~~~~~~~~~~

See the system card and addendum for your machine for 
installation and startup instructions, and fire it up. 

You Will see a MENU BAR across the top of the screen 
plus three separate windows: a TITLE SCREEN, a HELP WINDOW, 
and the MAP WINDOW. 

The TITLE SCREEN introduces the program and gives credits. 
Click on it to make it go away. 

The HELP WINDOW holds text that will help you use and 
understand SimEarth. You can request help on any icon, any 
button, any window, any function, any anything in SimEarth. 

The first time you start the program, the HELP WINDOW 
will display text to help you get started. 

You can change the size of the HELP WINDOW by clicking and dragging the SIZE 
GADGET. You can move it around the screen by clicking and dragging the 
TITLE BAR.

To scroll through all the text in a HELP WINDOW click on the up or 
down arrows in the SCROLL BAR on the right side of the window.

To make the HELP WINDOW go away, click in the CLOSE BOX.

				> 20 <


The MAP WINDOW gives you a view of your entire planet. 

At the top of the MAP WINDOW is the TITLE BAR. It displays the name 
of the current map display. You can move the MAP WINDOW around the 
screen by clicking and dragging the TITLE BAR. At the left of the 
TITLE BAR is the CLOSE BOX. If you click in this box the EDIT WINDOW 
will close. To bring it back, select MAP from the WINDOWS MENU. 

All windows, graphs and control panels have TITLE BARS and CLOSE BOXES. 

The MAP WINDOW also has a DISPLAY AREA and a CONTROL PANEL. The 
DISPLAY AREA shows the entire planet. A rectangle somewhere in this area 
shows the part of the planet that will be displayed in the EDIT WINDOW, 
your close-up view of the planet. 

The CONTROL PANEL, at the bottom of the window, lets you select different 
views of the planet that give you information about the land, water, 
air, climate, life and civilization. The views are changed by clicking on 
the 12 icons. Go ahead and click on them. Many of them won`t do much because 
there is no active planet. To get the original view back, click on the 
far left icon. 

Clicking on the little buttons at the bottom that say GEOSPHERE, 
ATMOSPHERE, BIO, and CIV will bring up various MODEL CONTROL 
PANELS, and double-clicking on some of the icons will bring up graphs. 
Don't worry about this now. If an unexpected small window pops up, close 
it by clicking in its CLOSE BOX, or just click on any part of the 
MAP WINDOW to bring it to the front. 

				> 21 <

Near the right side of the CONTROL PANEL is the INFO BOX. It 
displays various graphs and legends for each of the map views. 
To the right of the INFO BOX are three buttons. The top one takes you 
to the EDIT WINDOW; the bottom one changes the INFO BOX between graphs 
and legends (when available).

The middle button, GLOBE, changes the flat  map into a globe. All of 
the map views are available on both the flat map and the globe. 

Click on GLOBE again to return to the flat 

At the top of the DISPLAY AREA is a MESSAGE BAR that will sometimes 
appear and display messages to you from the simulation and from 
the SimEarthlings that inhabit the planet.

At the moment, the MESSAGE BAR should say, "No Game in Progress. Use 
'New Planet' to Start."

When SimEarth first starts, there is no actual planet or game 
running. This gives you a chance to look around a little before things 
start to happen. When you are ready to start playing, you must 
choose NEW PLANET from the FILE MENU. 

Before doing that, we'll take a quick look around. 

Look at the MENUS along the top of the screen. If you are unfamiliar with 
drop-down menus, check with the SimEarth addendum for your machine. 
A complete description of every item on every menu is found in the 
Reference section of this manual. 

Open the FILE MENU. It is for starting new planets, loading and saving old 
planets, printing, and quitting SimEarth. 

Open the WINDOWS MENU. Use this menu to open the various SimEarth 
windows. 

Open the MODELS MENU. This menu gives you access to the four MODEL 
CONTROL PANELS that you will use to modify the simulation. 

				> 22 <


Open the GRAPHS MENU. This menu gives you access to the four graphs that 
give you information on air, life and technology on the planet. 

Open the OPTIONS MENU. It lets you Customise the program to your tastes. 

Open the SPEED MENU. It lets you set the simulation speed of the game and 
choose the way the date is displayed. 

Open the DATASOUND MENU. It lets you control some of the sound in SimEarth.

Along with the MAP WINDOW, the most important window you will be using is 
the EDIT WINDOW. To see it, choose EDIT from the WINDOWS MENU. For a 
complete description of everything in the EDIT WINDOW, see the Reference 
section of this manual. 

The EDIT WINDOW is your close-up view of your planet. It is where 
you will make modifications to the planet itself and the life on it.

The EDIT WINDOW also has a TITLE BAR, CONTROL PANEL, and a DISPLAY 
AREA. You can use the TITLE BAR to close or move the window. The DISPLAY 
AREA shows the area of the planet that is in the rectangle in the MAP 
WINDOW.

On the left side of the window is the EDIT WINDOW CONTROL PANEL. This is 
where you choose your tools to modify the planet, and choose the data you want 
to view in this window. 

An easy way to find out what all the icons and buttons on the EDIT WINDOW 
CONTROL PANEL do is to use the HELP function. Hold down the 
SHIFT KEY and click on an icon or button. The HELP WINDOW will give you 
information on the spot where you clicked. 

In the lower-right corner is the SiZE BOX. Click and drag this box to 
enlarge or shrink the size of the EDIT WINDOW. 

The biggest part of this window is the DISPLAY AREA. This is the 
close-up "satellite's eye view" of your planet. At this point you will 
see only land and water in this area. The elevation of the land is shown 
in shades--the lighter the shade, the higher the elevation. 

To see different parts of the planet you must scroll the planet's 
terrain under the window. Depending on your computer, you may or may not 
have SCROLL BARS at the right and bottom of the EDIT WINDOW. If you 
have SCROLL BARS, then use them (click on the arrows or the bar) to 
scroll the terrain. If you don't have SCROLL BARS, then simply move 
the mouse pointer to any edge or corner of the screen, and the display 
will scroll. 

Go to the WINDOWS MENU and open the TUTORIAL WINDOW. This is a HELP 
WINDOW that introduces you to SimEarth and explains much of the program. 

The tutorial that you are reading now is much more complete. Use the 
on-line TUTORIAL WINDOW for a quick refresher course whenever you 
need it. 

				> 24 <

There is also a HISTORY WINDOW that graphs 15 factors through the 
history of your planet, and a REPORT WINDOW, which gives you feedback on 
your planet's condition and your planet management skills. Since there 
is no active planet yet, these windows won't tell you much. We'll come 
back to them later.

Open the MODELS MENU and select GEOSPHERE. You will see the GEOSPHERE 
MODEL CONTROL PANEL. Go back to the menu And select 
ATMOSPHERE to see another CONTROL PANEL.

These CONTROL PANELS, four in all, let you modify the actual 
simulation. You can only display one MODEL CONTROL PANEL 
at a time. You can switch between them by clicking on the NEXT or 
LAST buttons in the upper-right corner of the panel.

Open the GRAPHS MENU and select one of the graphs. Only one graph can 
be viewed at a time. These graphs keep you informed on the status of 
the Atmosphere, Biomes, Life, and Technology on your planet.

Let's build some planets.


				> 25 <


CREATING AND MODIFYING PLANETS
==============================

CREATING A PLANET IN THE GEOLOGICAL TIMESCALE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Name your Planet:

Select NEW PLANET from the FILE MENU. 

You will now be asked a question. The answer to the question will be found 
at the back of the SimEarth manual in the PLANET SPECIFICATION SHEETS. Type 
in the answer, and hit return. 

You will see the NEW PLANET WINDOW. 

At the top of this window, you select whether you want to play an easy, 
average, or hard game. You can also select experimental mode, which gives 
you an unlimited energy budget. 

The bottom of the window gives you choices of planets. There are seven 
scenarios--pre-set planets--that you can load, or you can create a random 
planet. 

Let's create a random planet in easy game mode. Click on EASY CAME in the 
top section of the window, and click on the planet that says RANDOM PLANET. 

Now you will see a dialog box asking you to name your planet and select 
the Time Scale. 

There are four Time Scales in SimEarth; each simulates different aspects of 
planetary development. There is a complete description of each Time Scale in 
the Reference section. 

Click in the box next to GEOLOGIC it may already be selected(), then type 
in a name for your planet--try GEOWORID and click the BEGIN button. 

				> 26 <


A new planet is born. Select the EDIT option in the WINDOWS MENU and 
look at the EDIT WINDOW. In the TITLE BAR, along with the planet's name, 
is the date-- the elapsed time since the planet was created. In the 
SPEED MENU you can change the format of the date between RELATIVE 
DATE (time elapsed since the beginning of the present Time Scale) and 
ABSOLUTE DATE (time elapsed since the creation of the planet). Since 
this planet is in the first Time Scale, the two are the same. 

There will be no oceans for a while, and there is no atmosphere to burn up 
incoming meteors. 

Sit back for a couple minutes and watch, switching between the EDIT 
and MAP WINDOWS. You will witness events: meteor strikes, volcanoes, 
and earthquakes. 
Soon oceans will form and life will form in the oceans. 

TOURING THE PLANET
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Bring the EDIT WINDOW to the front, and make it as big as you can. 
Scroll around the planet and go sightseeing for a few minutes. 

A lot is going on: time is passing very fast in this Time Scale. You can 
see the continents drifting. Single-celled life is spreading. Meteors 
hit the land and make craters that become lakes or hit the ocean and 
cause tidal waves. 

EDIT WINDOW CONTROL PANEL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Bring the EDIT WINDOW to the front and look at the EDIT WINDOW CONTROL 
PANEL. At the top-left of the panel are six icons. Click on these 
icons to activate tools for changing the planet. Below that is the 
CURRENT TOOL DISPLAY. It shows which tool is being used and the cost 
in energy to use it. 

Click on each icon. The three on the left have submenus. Click and hold 
to see them. Keep the mouse button down, and slide the pointer to an 
option on the submenu to select it. 

To get an explanation of what an icon does, hold down the SHIFT KEY 
and click on the icon. The HELP WINDOW will explain what it does and 
how to use it. 

Below the icons are the DATA LAYER BUTTONS--five buttons that let you 
decide what information about the planet will be displayed. You can have any, 
all, or none of these on at once. 

You can also get HELP WINDOW messages about these buttons. 

				> 27 <

Click on these, and play with them. When you turn off the display of 
the oceans, you can see the elevation of the ocean floor. This doesn't 
make the ocean go away, it just makes it invisible. Depending on how fast 
you read, and how fast your computer is, you may or may not have life 
or biomes to turn on and off at this time. 

Below the DATA LAYER BUTTONS are the CLIMATE OVERLAY BUTTONS--six 
buttons that let you turn on and off display of climactic information. 
Only one of these can be on at a time. 

You can also get HELP WINDOW messages about these buttons. 

Go ahead and play with these for a while. 

At the bottom of the EDIT WINDOW CONTROL PANEL is the AVAILABLE ENERGY 
DISPLAY. In SimEarth, the price you pay to manipulate the planet is 
in energy.

This little box tells you how much you have left. As time passes, 
your energy supply will slowly build back up, but it will never exceed 
5000 in an easy game, or 2000 in an average or hard game. In 
experimental mode, you have unlimited energy. 

USING THE SET ALTITUDE TOOL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This tool has two modes: RAISE and LOWER. Click once on the SET 
ALTITUDE icon. The icon will be highlighted. In the CURRENT TOOL 
DISPLAY, you will see the SET ALTITUDE icon, but with only an up arrow 
along with the cost to use it: 50n (energy units). 

Only the up arrow is shown to indicate that this tool is in RAISE mode. 

Scroll the EDIT WINDOW to a place on the planet that is mostly water 
(make sure the display of oceans is on). Point to the water and click 
and hold for a few seconds. You've just built an island. If you 
watch for a while, you'll notice that the island moves and changes. That 
is because time is moving so fast in this Time Scale that you can 
see the continents moving (continental drift). 

Now click on the SET ALTITUDE icon again. The icon in the CURRENT TOOL 
DISPLAY shows only a down arrow to indicate that the tool is in LOWER mode. 
The price to lower altitude is also 50 energy units. 

Scroll over to a landmass, click and hold for a few seconds. You've just 
dug a lake.

				> 28 <

THE GAIA WINDOW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Select GAIA from the WINDOWS MENU. A small window appears with a 
representation of Gaia--the planetary organism. This face will give 
you constant feedback on the "mood of the planet." 

Gaia's mood is based on how well life on the planet is doing. 
The moods range from bliss to horror. Everything that happens and 
everything you do affects the planet's mood. 

You may want to keep this window showing in a corner of the screen to 
give you constant feedback on your planetary management. 

Gaia will sleep until life forms, then it will wake up. Its eyes 
will follow the pointer around the screen. Please don't poke it in 
the eye. 

TRIGGERING EVENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note: The Icons here are obvious for what they are. So i aint 
      pratting about trying to re-create em with Ansi.

Now for some real fun--triggering events. Make sure the EVENTS DATA LAYER 
BUTTON in the EDIT WINDOW CONTROL PANEL is on. 

Events are more than just disasters or occurrences: they are tools. They 
can be helpful in shaping the land and changing the composition of 
the atmosphere. They can also cause mass extinctions. 

Remember, in SimEarth, everything is interrelated. To see how each 
event can be used for good or bad, and its side effects that affect 
the planet, see the "Events" chapter of the Reference section and use 
the HELP function (hold the SHIFT KEY and click on the TRIGGER EVENTS icon). 

METEORS
~~~~~~~
Click and hold on the TRIGGER EVENT icon. You will see the submenu of 
events. Slide the pointer until METEOR is highlighted, then release the 
mouse button. 

Scroll the EDIT WINDOW so water is showing. Click a few times on the ocean. 
Meteors will crash into the water, creating tidal waves. When meteors 
hit the water, they add a lot of moisture to the air, which will 
increase rainfall and contribute to the greenhouse effect. To check 
this, select AIR SAMPLE from the GRAPHS MENU, which will open the 
ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION GRAPH. Look at the percentage of Water Vapor. 
Go back to the EDIT WINDOW and drop a few more meteors in the ocean. 
Check the Water Vapor percentage again. 

				> 29 <

Crash a few meteors into land. You will get huge craters. If they 
are deep enough, they will become lakes. Crashing meteors into land 
spews dust into the atmosphere. Too much dust in the air blocks 
sunlight, which will kill plants (biomes), which will kill animals. 
Check the dust levels in the ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION GRAPH before and 
after triggering meteors. 

VOLCANOES
~~~~~~~~~
Click and hold on the TRIGGER EVENT icon again, and select VOLCANO from 
the submenu. 

Trigger a volcano somewhere in the ocean--instant island. Volcanoes 
in the water cause tidal waves, which can kill land life near 
the coasts. Volcanoes also add dust and carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. 

EARTHQUAKES
~~~~~~~~~~~
Now activate EARTHQUAKE on the TRIGGER EVENTS submenu. It has a sub-
submenu for choosing the direction of the earthquake's energy. 
Earthquakes in SimEarth let you change the direction of the magma flow 
under the surface of the earth, which affects continental drift. In other 
words, earthquakes let you move continents. To easily see the results 
of earthquakes, turn on the MAGMA CLIMATE LAYER BUTTON. 

You can use earthquakes to build mountain ranges. Center 
the EDIT WINDOW over a landmass, preferably an area at a 
low altitude (you can use the SET ALTITUDE tool to lower it). 
Near the top of the window, set off a few earthquakes that 
expend their energy to the south. Near the bottom of the 
window, set off a few earthquakes that expend their energy 
to the north. This has the effect of squeezing the land from 
both sides, and a mountain range will be pushed up where 
the energy from the southbound and northbound quakes 
meet. 


OTHER EVENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The other events work the same way--they are useful tools with both 
good and bad side effects. Take some time and play with them. 

				> 30 <



REPORT WINDOW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Open the WINDOWS MENU and select REPORT. The REPORT WINDOW tells you 
how you, your planet, and your planet's life are doing. 

The information displayed in the REPORT WINDOW varies for each Time Scale. 
There is also a special REPORT WINDOW for the Daisyworld scenario and for 
the two terraforming scenarios (Mars and Venus). 

At the bottom of the window is your CURRENT TASK. This is what must be 
accomplished before advancing to the next Time Scale, or successfully 
completing a scenario. 

Let's start a new planet in the Civilisation Time Scale and look 
at the rest of our tools. 

			----------------------

First, save the old planet to disk. Select SAVE AS... from the FILE MENU. 
Choose the disk or directory you want to save to, and change the name 
of the planet if you wish. Click the SAVE button. Refer to the 
SimEarth addendum for details. 


Select NEW PLANET from the FILE MENU. This time, choose experimental mode, 
then click on the random planet. 

When the Name and Time Scale dialog box appears, click in the box to 
the left of "Civilised," type in the name CIVWORLD, and click the 
BEGIN button. 

				> 31 <


INVESTIGATING THE NEW WORLD MAP WINDOW 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lets take a look around the new planet. Open the MAP WINDOW, if it isn't 
already open, and have it display the world in the flat projection (not 
the globe). At the bottom of the window is the MAP WINDOW CONTROL PANEL.

In this control panel are 12 icons that change the map display. They 
are arranged in five groups: Geosphere, Hydrosphere, Atmosphere, 
Bio(sphere), and Civ(ilization).

(Icons from Left to Right number 1-12!).

1.) The map now displayed is the Terrain Map, which corresponds with 
    the Terrain Map icon. Here you can see the continents and the 
    oceans, and the terrain level of the land. Click on the INFO BUTTON 
    in the lower-right corner of the window. The INFO BOX now displays 
    a legend to the map's altitude. 

2.) Click on the Event Map icon. Now the map shows the land and water (no 
    altitude), plus tiny symbols that appear where events are occurring 
    (if they are occurring). The INFO BOX shows a legend to the event 
    symbols. 

3.) Click on the Drift Map icon. Now you see the direction of the 
    magma currents, which controls continental drift on your planet. 

1.) Click on the Terrain Map icon. The drift is gone, and the 
    altitude display is back.

4.) The first icon in the Hydrosphere group is the Hide/Show Oceans icon. 
    This toggles on and off the view of the oceans. It can be used 
    along with any of the other icons. Click on it a couple times, but 
    when you are done, leave the display of oceans on. 

5.) Click on the Ocean Temperature icon. You are shown the temperature 
    of the ocean in shades or colors. The INFO BOX displays a legend of 
    the temperatures. 

6.) Click on the next icon to see a display of ocean currents. 

				> 32 <


Now for the Atmosphere group. The three icons in this group display Air 
Temperature, Rainfall, and Air Currents, respectively. Click on 
each of them. The INFO BOX will display a legend for each display. 

The Biosphere group only has two icons: Biomes shows the biome distribution 
on the planet, and Life shows the diversity of life on the planet. Once 
again, the INFO BOX displays a legend to help you interpret the map. 

There is only one icon in the Civilisation group. It displays the 
distribution of the seven levels of Technology on the planet. 

GRAPHS
~~~~~~
The graphs will also give you information about this planet. Select 
BIOMES from the GRAPHS MENU to see the BIOME RATIO GRAPH. 

Biome Ratio Graph
-----------------
This graph shows the relative amounts of each biome on the planet. Since 
it shows changes over time, you can see the rise and fall of biomes 
through time. 

Life Class Ratio Graph
----------------------
Select LIFE-FORMS from the GRAPHICS MENU to see the LIFE CLASS 
RATIO GRAPH. This shows the relative amounts of each class of
life on the planet.

Technology Ratio Graph
----------------------
Select TECHNOLOGY from the GRAPHS MENU to see the TECHNOLOGY RATIO 
GRAPH. This shows the relative amount of each level of technology 
on the planet. 

				> 33 <

EDIT WINDOW 
~~~~~~~~~~~
Go back to the EDIT WINDOW, and look at the EDIT WINDOW CONTROL PANEL. 
Turn on all the DATA LAYER BUTTONS.

Click on the EXAMINE icon (Magnifying Glass). Now click and hold on any 
spot in the EDIT WINDOW DISPLAY AREA. A small window will pop up on 
the screen that gives you data on the biomes, life, and Civilisation 
in that spot.

While still holding down the mouse button, move the pointer around the EDIT 
WINDOW. The data window will update to describe the spot under the pointer. 
Take some time and use the EXAMINE tool to explore your world.

If you ask for HELP (hold down the SHIFT KEY and click) in the EDIT WINDOW 
DISPLAY AREA it will bring up the same data window as the EXAMINE tool.

Now that we know something about the planet, let's shake things up 
a little.

THE PLACE LIFE TOOL 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Make sure the EDIT WINDOW is displayed, and the LIFE and CITIES DATA 
LAYER BUTTONS are on. Click and hold on the PLACE LIFE icon.

				> 34 <


You will see a submenu. This is where you choose life, civilisations 
(cities), and terraformers to place on your planet. 

The left side of the submenu is for selecting life. The top seven are 
sea life, the bottom seven are land life. 

On the right side, the top seven items are cities for your intelligent 
SimEarthlings. The seven cities represent seven levels of 
technology. Below the cities are seven terraformers. These are 
tools that you will need to terraform Mars and Venus. 

Select one of the life-forms on the left side of the submenu. Move 
the pointer to the EDIT WINDOW DISPLAY AREA and click. The life-
form will be placed where you click. 

Depending on the Time Scale and level of development on the 
planet, some of the options on the Place Life submenu will not be 
available. These include both life-forms and cities. 

Just because you place life on the planet doesn't mean it will stay 
there. If you place ocean life on the land or land life in the water, 
it won't last long. Also, life-forms can only survive well in 
certain biomes. 

A complete chart of what life can live in which biome is in the 
"Life" chapter in the Reference section of this manual. 

Notice that placing different life forms and cities costs 
different amounts of energy, depending on the level of advancement of 
the item you are placing. 

THE PLANT BIOME TOOL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Just as you can place animal life on the planet, you can plant biomes. 
Click and hold on the PLANT BIOME icon. You will see a submenu that 
will allow you to choose a biome to plant. 

The various biomes can only survive in certain climates--if you plant a 
swamp in a polar icecap, it won't last long. A complete chart of what 
biomes can survive in which climates is in the "Life" chapter in the 
Reference section. 

When planting biomes, you can click and hold the mouse button, and 
slowly drag the mouse across the planet. The biomes will be continuously 
"painted" onto the terrain. 

				> 35 <


THE MOVE TOOL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The last tool in the EDIT WINDOW is for moving biomes, life, and cities. 
Click on the MOVE icon. 

Move the pointer to the EDIT WINDOW DISPLAY AREA and click and hold on a 
spot with life, a city, or a biome. Move the pointer to a different 
spot, and release the mouse button. 

Besides moving things, the MOVE tool is helpful for investigation. When 
you have multiple data layers on, LIFE symbols will cover BIOME symbols, 
and CITY symbols will cover both LIFE and BIOMES. To see what life or 
biome is under a city, use the MOVE tool to lift it, then put it back 
in the same place. 

We've covered exploration and modification of the planet; now we'll 
learn how to modify the simulation. 

				> 36 <


		      MODIFYING THE SIMULATION
		      ========================

INTRODUCTION.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the EDIT WINDOW you change the planet. In fact, you only change 
part of the planet. With the MODEL CONTROL PANELS, you make changes 
to the actual model that controls the fate of the entire planet. 

There are four MODEL CONTROL PANELS. One each to modify the simulation in 
the following areas: 

GEOSPHERE     --the planet itself; 
ATMOSPHERE    --the planet's air and climate; 
BIOSPHERE     --life on the planet; and 
CIVILISATION  --the behaviour of the planet's sentient species.

This tutorial won't explain each and every control on each CONTROL PANEL. It 
will explain what each CONTROL PANEL does, and how to use it. For a 
complete description of the control panels, see the "Model Control 
Panels" chapter in the Reference section. 

You can also find out what each control does by using the HELP function: hold 
down the SHIFT KEY and click on one of the controls. A HELP WINDOW will 
appear with a description of what each individual control does. 

			----------------------

GEOSPHERE CONTROL PANEL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The GEOSPHERE MODEL CONTROL PANEL controls the geologic aspects of a 
planet. These aspects, such as continental drift and core 
formation, change very slowly over millions of years. Since they change 
so slowly, the only way to see them clearly is in the Geologic Time Scale. 

Create a new, random planet in the Geologic Time Scale. 

Close all the windows, except the MAP WINDOW. Open 
the GEOSPHERE MODEL CONTROL PANEL. You can 
either do this by selecting GEOSPHERE from the 
MODELS MENU, or by clicking on the GEOSPHERE 
button in the MAP WINDOW CONTROL PANEL. 

Open the OPTIONS MENU and make sure UPDATE 
BACKGROUND is on. (It will have a checkmark on the 
left if it is on.) This will allow you to keep the MODEL 
CONTROL PANEL in front and still see the changes in 
the MAP WINDOW. 

				> 37 <

There are seven controls on this panel. Each control has a name and an 
indicator. The indicator is usually an arrow. For this tutorial, 
we'll concentrate on the CONTINENTAL DRIFT control because the results 
of changing it are easy to see. 

Click on the words CONTINENTAL DRIFT in the GEOSPHERE MODEL 
CONTROL PANEL. The words and the arrow above those words will be 
highlighted to show that this control is ready for your changes. 

To change the settings, you will use the slider control on 
the right side of the control panel. Click above or below the slider 
to move it up or down one notch. You can also click and drag the slider. 

If the oceans haven't formed yet on your newest planet, wait a 
minute until they do, then continue. 

Click and drag the slider all the way to the top, turning continental 
drift to its maximum setting. Go to the SPEED MENU and set the simulator 
to FAST. Watch the MAP WINDOW for a while: you will actually see the 
continents moving. 

Now turn the continental drift all the way down. The continents will slow 
their movement to nearly nothing. 

The other controls are operated the same way, and though the results of 
changing them isn't as obvious as with continental drift, they all have 
a powerful impact on the planet. 

			----------------------

ATMOSPHERIC MODEL CONTROL PANEL.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now open the ATMOSPHERE MODEL CONTROL PANEL. You can open it three 
ways: select ATMOSPHERE from the MODELS MENU, click on the ATMOSPHERE 
button on the MAP WINDOW CONTROL PANEL, or click the NEXT button in the 
upper-right corner of the GEOSPHERE MODEL CONTROL PANEL. 


				> 38 <


The ATMOSPHERE MODEL CONTROL PANEL is effective in all four Time Scales.

Bring the MAP WINDOW to the front, and click on the AIR TEMPERA-
TURE icon. Click on the INFO BUTTON to display a color/shade legend 
of the temperatures. 

Bring the ATMOSPHERE MODEL CONTROL PANEL to the front. Click on SOLAR 
INPUT, then drag the slider all the way to the top. You just 
turned the heat from the Sun to maximum. Your planet will soon start 
warming up. 

To add insult to Injury, turn GREENHOUSE EFFECT all the way up, and turn 
CLOUD ALBEDO, SURFACE ALBEDO, and AIR-SEA THERMAL TRANSFER all the 
way down. Each of these actions will contribute to global warming. 

Click on the INFO BUTTON. It will now display a graph of the changes in air 
temperature. Watch for a while. Soon the map and graph will show a rise in 
temperature. If you leave it rising long enough, your oceans will boil 
off and all life on the planet will die. 

After a few minutes, set all the settings back to midway, and watch the 
map and graph as everything begins to cool down. 

			---------------------------------

BIOSPHERE MODEL CONTROL PANEL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The BIOSPHERE MODEL CONTROL PANEL is most effective in Evolution Time 
Scale, but has some effect in the other Time Scales. It controls how the 
simulation models life on the planet. 

Create a new planet in the Evolution Time Scale, set the simulation 
speed to FAST in the SPEED MENU, and open the BIOSPHERE MODEL CONTROL 
PANEL. It can be opened from the menu, the MAP WINDOW CONTROL PANEL, 
or the NEXT button on the ATMOSPHERE MODEL CONTROL PANEL. 

Turn ADVANCE RATE, MUTATION RATE, and REPRODUCTION RATE on the 
BIOSPHERE MODEL CONTROL PANEL all the way up. 

The changes from this control panel are much less obvious than the 
others. You can best see them in the HISTORY WiNDOW. 

				> 39 <

HISTORY WINDOW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Open the HISTORY WINDOW by selecting HISTORY in the 
WINDOWS MENU.

The HISTORY WINDOW displays the changes in 15 factors 
over time. Click on the DIVERSITY button to display the 
changing number of species on the planet. 

Watch for a few minutes, and the changes you made in the 
BIOSPHERE MODEL CONTROL PANEL will cause a rise in 
the diversity. 

			----------------------


CIVILISATION MODEL CONTROL PANEL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The CIVILISATION MODEL CONTROL PANEL controls how the model deals with 
your intelligent species. It is only useful in the Civilisation 
and Technology Time Scales. 

Open the CIVILISATION MODEL CONTROL PANEL. This control panel is one of 
the main challenges of SimEarth. You decide what energy sources 
the intelligent inhabitants of your planet will invest their time in, 
and what they will do with the energy. 

This is a very complex control panel. For a complete explanation, see the 
"MODEL CONTROL PANEL" chapter in the Reference section of this manual. 

The left side of the CIVILISATION MODEL CONTROL PANEL is for choosing the 
energy sources to develop. These are set the same as settings on the other 
control panels. Different energy sources are appropriate for 
different levels of technology: you can make a Stone Age level 
Civilisation spend a lot of time trying to develop nuclear energy, 
but they don't have the knowledge or tools to succeed, and won't get 
any return from it. 

The more you invest in energy forms that are appropriate for the 
technology level, the more energy the civilisations will have to use 
for advancement to the next technology level. 

				> 40 <

The right side of the control panel is where you allocate energy. You 
decide to what use the civilisations will put the energy they produce. 

This side of the control panel works a little differently from the 
left side. It is a ratio. All energy that is produced is used. The 
higher the setting for each energy use, the higher the percentage of 
the produced energy will be allocated to that use. If the settings are 
all in the middle, or all the way up, the model interprets it the 
same. The important thing here is the relative settings of each energy use. 
Set your priorities and allocate to those uses you find most important. 

The CIVILISATION MODEL CONTROL PANEL is closely related to the REPORT 
WINDOW. 

REPORT WINDOW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Create a new planet in the Technology Time Scale. Make sure the UPDATE 
BACKGROUND option is on. 

Open the REPORT WINDOW, and arrange the screen so it and the 
CIVILISATION MODEL CONTROL PANEL are both visible. 

Take a look at the REPORT WINDOW. There is detailed information on the 
planet's Civilised life. It tells you the class of your sentient 
species, the highest and average (median) technology level, the 
population, and quality of life. It also shows a chart of what biomes 
your sentient species prefers to live in. 

Below that is a section on energy that relates to the CIVILISATION MODEL 
CONTROL PANEL. It lists the energy sources, and their efficiency. The 
efficiency depends on the average level of technology on your planet. 

To the left of each energy source are the hours per week your global 
citizen works on this energy source. Below these hours are the total 
hours per week intelligent SimEarthlings must work to survive. 

As you turn the energy investments on the CIVILISATION MODEL CONTROL 
PANEL up and down, the hours worked will rise and fall. Try it. 

Keep this in mind when you set your energy investment--the work hours per 
week affect the SimEarthling's quality of life. 

				> 41 <

ALLOCATING ENERGY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Energy allocation in the CIVILISATION MODEL CONTROL PANEL affects every 
aspect of the sentient SimEarthling's lives. 

The results of your allocation are easy to see. Make sure the UPDATE 
BACKGROUND option is on. 

For an easy-to-see example, we'll look at PHILOSOPHY. 

Allocating to PHILOSOPHY lessens the frequency and severity of 
war. If you take all allocation away from PHILOSOPHY, wars will break 
out all over the planet. These wars can be viewed in the EDIT WINDOW 
and the HISTORY WINDOW. 

Open the HISTORY WINDOW and arrange the screen so you 
can see it along with the CIVILISATION MODEL CONTROL 
PANEL. In the HISTORY WINDOW, turn the POPULATE and 
WAR graphs on. Turn PHILOSOPHY all the way down in the 
CIVILISATION MODEL CONTROL PANEL. 

The occurrence of war will quickly rise. Eventually it will fall, 
because so many of the sentient SimEarthlings have been 
killed that there's no one left to fight. 

Allocating or not allocating to the other energy uses can 
have results as drastic as PHILOSOPHY. These results can 
be seen in the EDIT, REPORT and MAP WINDOWS. Try 
turning each one all the way up, then all the way down and 
see what happens. 

Allocating to SCIENCE will help your intelligent SimEarthlings 
advance to higher levels of technology. No allocation to SCIENCE 
will cause advancement to stop. 

Allocate too much and they will advance too fast, and kill themselves. 

Allocating to AGRICULTURE affects the food supply. 

Allocating to MEDICINE affects the frequency and severity of plagues. 

Allocating to ART/MEDIA affects the quality of life on your planet. 

Your task here is making difficult choices and setting priorities. 

				> 42 <



Now you know the basics of SimEarth:

 Using menus; 
 Opening and closing windows; 
 Creating and saving planets; 
 Getting information from maps and graphs; 
 Changing the planet in the EDIT WINDOW; and 
 Changing the simulation in the MODEL CONTROL PANELS.

Mastery of planet management takes a lot of time and experimentation. 
You may even (heaven forbid) have to read the rest of this manual.

Happy simulating.

UNBLANK PAGE (Some weird shit going down here! .. Rb).
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To keep this manual consistent by always having a chapter title 
page on the right side, we either had to leave this page blank, say 
something dumb like "This page intentionally left blank," or fill it up 
with something.

Here are some profound thoughts and revelations that occurred to us while 
playing SimEarth.

Evolutionary Thought
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In general, SimEarthlings are as lazy as Earthlings. They never want 
to work, and especially hate physical labour. Whenever there are heavy 
objects to move, they argue over who has to do it.

 "I don't want to carry it--you carry it!" 
 "Not me--you carry it."

And that's how Eukaryotes evolved.

Of course, the usual solution is to hire a professional to do the work. 
That's what Prokaryotes do for a living.

Revelation #1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When you're sitting on top of the world, be careful not to break 
the monitor.

SIMEARTHLING EXTINCT BLUES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
My life-form's gone, but I don't worry,

'Cause I'm simulating on top of the world.

NOBODY READS GAME MANUALS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hi Mom. I know nobody reads game manuals, but I knew you would. I worked 
real hard on this manual, and...Mom...wake up Mom.

QUESTION
~~~~~~~~
Where in the world is Carmen SimDiego?

			   REFERENCE MANUAL.
		 	   =================


"Love makes the world go round but a single click in the Edit
 window makes it stop."

CONTROLLING THE SIMULATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Depending on your computer, you may or may not have a mouse. If you do have 
one, then you will want to use it--SimEarth is much easier to control with a 
mouse than with a keyboard. 

See the addendum for your computer for more information on using mice and 
keyboards in SimEarth. 

In general, you will use the mouse to select items from menus, 
and to activate tools by clicking on icons. Once tools are activated, 
SimEarth functions much like a paint program that "paints life 
on a planet." 

			----------------------

SimEarth has a lot of windows, graphs, and control panels, and 
can get confusing. The easiest way to understand the program is to 
know where you can INPUT information--add or change the planet or 
model to suit yourself--and where to see OUTPUT, the information about 
the planet and results of your INPUT. 

INPUT
~~~~~
There are three places to INPUT information: the FILE MENU, the EDIT WINDOW, 
and the MODEL CONTROL PANELS. 

FILE MENU
~~~~~~~~~
By selecting NEW PLANET or LOAD PLANET from the FILE MENU, you remove 
the existing planet or scenario from memory and load another planet 
or scenario into the simulation. 

EDIT WINDOW
~~~~~~~~~~~
The EDIT WINDOW is where you place life, change altitudes and trigger 
events. 

When you do these things, you are INPUTTING DATA--changes to the planet. 
Since this only affects the planet in the locale of your input, we 
call this LOCAL INPUT. 

The EDIT WINDOW is also a source of OUTPUT. 

				> 46 <

MODEL CONTROL PANELS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The four MODEL CONTROL PANELS are where you change the actual model. 
These changes affect the entire planet, and change the 
simulation itself. Since everything--the whole world--is affected, we 
call this GLOBAL INPUT. 

The MODEL CONTROL PANELS are the only places in SimEarth that are INPUT 
ONLY. 

OUTPUT
~~~~~~
Other than the MODEL CONTROL PANELS, every window in SimEarth gives 
OUTPUT--information for you about the planet, the simulation, and the 
results of your input. 

				> 47 <

MENUS
~~~~~

FILE MENU
~~~~~~~~~
The FILE MENU is for performing file and disk-related functions. 

NEW PLANET brings up the NEW PLANET WINDOW, which allows you to pick 
any of the seven included Scenarios, or a new, randomly generated 
planet/game in any of three difficulty levels or experimental mode. 

First, choose the difficulty level. There are three levels of 
difficulty for games: easy, medium, and hard. There is also an 
experimental mode that gives you an unlimited energy budget for 
planet manipulation. 

Next, pick a scenario or a random planet. If you choose random 
planet, you will be shown a dialog box allowing you to name your new 
world, choose the Time Scale, and either begin the new planet or 
cancel. If you have a planet in progress that has not been saved, you 
will be given the opportunity to save it before the new planet is 
generated. 

LOAD PLANET brings up a dialog box to allow you to load in a pre-existing 
planet. If you have a planet in progress that has not been saved, you 
will be given the opportunity to save it before loading a new one. See 
the SimEarth addendum for your computer for details on loading planets. 

SAVE PLANET saves your current planet to disk. If it has not been 
saved before, it will bring up a dialog box window to allow you to 
name your planet before saving it. See the SimEarth addendum for 
your computer for details on saving planets. 

SAVE AS brings up a dialog box, allowing you to change the name and/or 
location of a previously saved planet. 

PRINT or SNAPSHOT may or may not be present in your version of SimEarth. 
See the SimEarth addendum for your machine for details. 

QUIT ends your SimEarth session, with a final chance to save your 
planet in-progress. 

			----------------------

WINDOWS MENU
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The WINDOWS MENU allows access to the various windows in SimEarth. 

EDIT opens and/or brings the EDIT WINDOW to the front. 

MAP opens and/or brings the MAP WINDOW to the front. 


				> 48 <

GAIA opens the CAIA WINDOW, which displays the face of the planet and 
gives constant feedback on your actions and the state of life in 
the world.

HISTORY opens and/or brings the HISTORY WINDOW to the front.

REPORT opens and/or brings the REPORT WINDOW to the front.

TUTORIAL opens and/or brings the TUTORIAL WINDOW to the front.

GLOSSARY opens a HELP WINDOW that displays a glossary of many earth 
science terms used in SimEarth.

			----------------------

MODELS MENU
~~~~~~~~~~~
The MODELS MENU allows access to the various MODEL CONTROL PANELS that 
let you adjust the inner workings of the simulation.

GEOSPHERE opens the Geosphere Model Control Panel.

ATMOSPHERE opens the Atmosphere Model Control Panel.

BIOSPHERE opens the Biosphere Model Control Panel.

CIVILISATION opens the Civilisation Model Control Panel.


			----------------------

GRAPHS MENU
~~~~~~~~~~~
The GRAPHS MENU allows access to the various graphs used in SimEarth.

AIR SAMPLE brings up the Atmospheric Composition graph.

BIOMES brings up the Biome Ratio graph.

LIFE FORMS brings up the Life Class Ratio graph.

TECHNOLOGY brings up the Technology Ratio graph.

			----------------------

OPTIONS MENU
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The OPTIONS MENU lets you adjust many features of SimEarth to suit your 
personal preferences. When the options are active, a checkmark will 
appear to the left of the option.

GOTO EVENTS automatically transports you to the location of any event that 
occurs. When this option is active, and when the EDIT WINDOW is in 
the front, the area viewed in the EDIT WINDOW will jump to centre 
on any events that occur. The default setting is off. 


				> 49 <

UPDATE BACKGROUND lets you choose whether or not all windows on the 
screen will be animated and constantly updated. When this option 
is inactive, only the front window will be animated and updated. 
Having this option on greatly decreases the speed of the simulation. The 
default setting depends on your machine's speed of operation. 

This is especially useful for high-speed machines with large 
monitors. If SimEarth runs too slowly, or you rarely display more than 
one or two windows at a time, you may wish to turn this off. 

COMPRESS EDIT SCREN is an option that can be very useful on computers with 
small screens. When active, it changes the Edit WINDOW so it only 
displays every other tile allowing you to see four times as much area. 
The default setting is off.

MUSIC enables and disables music during the game. The default setting is on. 

SOUND EFFECTS enables and disables sound during the game. The default 
setting is on. 

MESSAGES enables and disables the display of messages to you from the 
simulator and the SimEarthlings that will appear throughout the game. The 
default setting is on. 

AUTOSCROLL allows automatic scrolling of the terrain in the EDIT WINDOW 
when using any of the EDIT WINDOW icons near or at the edge of the 
window. The default setting is on. 

SAVE OPTIONS + WINDOWS saves your present configuration of options, open 
windows, window sizes and window locations to disk as the 
default configuration. You can use this option again at any time to 
change the default settings. 

				> 50 <


SPEED MENU
~~~~~~~~~~
The SPEED MENU allows you to set the simulation speed and date options. 

FAST sets the simulation speed to the maximum available for your machine. 

MODERATE sets the simulation speed to approximately 75% of the fast setting. 
This is the default speed setting. 

SLOW sets the simulation speed to approximately 25% of the fast setting. 

PAUSE pauses the simulation. All the planet manipulation tools will 
be available and active, but time will be stopped. 

RELATIVE DATE displays the date as the number of years since the beginning 
of the present Time Scale. This is the default date setting. 

ABSOLUTE DATE displays the date as the number of years since the original 
cooling of the planet. If you began your planet in a later Time 
Scale, Absolute Date will estimate and add the time from earlier Time 
Scales. 

			----------------------

DATASOUND MENU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The DATASOUND MENU controls the sound functions in SimEarth. The first two 
items are ways of using the sound and the last seven items let you 
choose the data from which the sound will be generated. 

TONE MONITOR plays an intermittent, recurrent tone based on one of the data 
settings. This is used for aural monitoring of data. For instance, 
if you are trying to combat global warming, you could set the tone 
monitor to report on air temperature. Every so often you will hear 
a tone. The higher the tone, the higher the average global temperature. 
You will hear the changes in temperature without having to look at the 
air temperature map. 

PLAY DATA SONG is an option that is more fun than useful. It takes 32 
evenly spaced samples of the selected data from the top to 
the bottom of the map, averages the values across the map, and plays 
them as notes. For example, if air temperature is selected, then the 
data song will convert the 32 data samples into 32 notes--the higher 
the air temperature, the higher the pitch. The notes will be 
lowest around the poles and highest near the equator. 

ALTITUDE bases the sound on data in the Altitude array. 

AIR TEMPERATURE bases the sound on data in the Air Temperature array. 

				> 51 <

RAINFALL bases the sound on data in the Rainfall array.

SEA TEMPERATURE bases the sound on data in the Sea Temperature array.

BIOMASS bases the sound on data in the Biome array.

LIFE bases the sound on data in the Life array.

CIVILISATION bases the sound on data in the Humans array.

				> 52 <

There are many different windows in SimEarth. Here is a complete 
description of each one. 

HELP WINDOW
~~~~~~~~~~~
There is on-screen help available for almost everything in SimEarth, 
including all menus, buttons, icons, tools, graphs, and control panels. 

Help windows are not available through the menus. To get HELP, press 
and hold the SHIFT KEY. This will change your cursor to HELP MODE. 
Then click on any item on the screen, and you will be shown a text 
window with lots of information about that item. 

If you ask for HELP in the DISPLAY AREA of the EDIT WINDOW, you will 
get the same information window that is produced by the EXAMINE icon. 

If you ask for HELP in the DISPLAY AREA of the MAP WINDOW, you will 
get information on the active MAP WINDOW display. 

There is a massive amount of information available in the HELP WINDOW. 
Almost anything in the world (simulated, that is) that you want to know 
about is in there. 

The HELP WINDOW is your friend. Use it. 

The on-line GLOSSARY is useful for getting help with definitions of 
words in the program you may not be familiar with. The GLOSSARY is 
available in the WINDOWS MENU.

				> 53 <

NEW PLANET WINDOW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is really a dialog box, not a window, but it is so important 
that for the purposes of this manual, we are giving it a promotion.

Use this window for creating new, random planets, and for 
starting the scenarios.

At the top of the window are settings that let you choose the 
difficulty of the game or scenario. At the bottom of the window are 
the scenarios and random planet buttons. 

Any random planet or scenario can be played in Experimental Mode, Easy Game, 
Average Game, or Hard Game. 

Help is available on every setting and button in this window. Hold down the 
SHIFT KEY and click on anything in the window to receive help. You can get 
explanations of all the options and scenarios before beginning a game. 

SETTINGS
~~~~~~~~
Use these settings to adjust difficulty levels for all games, scenarios,
random planets, and experiments. Just click on the button next to a 
setting to choose it. 

EXPERIMENTAL MODE allows you to load any of the scenarios or a random 
planet and have unlimited energy for planet manipulation. With the 
unlimited energy, you can set up any type of planet you want in 
any stage of development, and add any other factors or conditions you 
want. This mode is really a "planetary spreadsheet." 

This is also a good mode for learning SimEarth. 

				> 54 <


The MODEL CONTROL PANELS will all be randomly set at "moderate" values 
that should allow planetary progress without many changes. 

EASY GAME is good for beginners. In an easy game, life appears and 
evolves quickly and easily. In fact, it will take some effort on 
your part to stop it. 

Your starting energy level is 5000 E.U. (energy units)

The MODEL CONTROL PANELS will all be randomly set at "moderate" values.

AVERAGE GAME is a little more challenging. It will take some 
effort on your part to get your planet progressing and keep it going. 

Your starting energy level is 2000 E.U. 

The MODEL CONTROL PANELS will all be randomly set at "extreme" values that 
will require some fine tuning. 

HARD GAME is really difficult. In fact, it's really very difficult. 
Not only will you have to adjust the MODEL CONTROL PANELS, but you 
will have to take on the role of Gaia. 

The MODEL CONTROL PANELS will all be randomly set at "extreme" values that 
will require some fine tuning. 

All Gaian regulation of climate, atmosphere and life is turned off 
and there will be no spontaneous generation of life--it's all in 
your hands. 

CANCEL removes the NEW PLANET WINDOW in case you change your mind.

PLANETS AND SCENARIOS 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Any planet or scenario can be played in Easy, Medium, or Hard 
Game as well as Experimental Mode. For in-depth descriptions 
of the scenarios see the "Scenarios" chapter of this manual. Just 
click on one of the planets to choose it.

RANDOM PLANET creates a randomly generated planet in any 
of the four Time Scales. When you choose this option, you will 
be shown a dialog box that will let you pick the Time Scale and 
name the planet.

				> 55 <

AQUARIUM is a planet with no continents. It is a good starting point
for those who like to design their own landscapes.

STAG NATION is a planet in the early civilisation time scale. Sentient
life on this planet is limited to one small island. You can help
it spread, or eliminate it and try to bring another life form 
to intelligence.

EARTH CAMBRIAN ERA is a simulation of Earth in the Evolution time
scale. One of the best features of this scenario is that its
continental drift re-creates the reak Earths drift.

EARTH MODERN DAY - gives you a chance to take over the Earth of
today. Youll get to deal with all the problems we deal with in the 
real world. This scenario is not recommended for escapists.

MARS gives you the chance to terraform Mars and turn it into 
a planet capable of supporting Eart life-forms.

VENUS gives you the ultimate challenge in Terraforming.

DAISYWORLD is the original simpler versiob of the SimEarth simulation.
Daisyworld was originally devised by James Lovelock as a demonstration 
of the Gaia theory.

				> 56 <

THE EDIT WINDOW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The EDIT WINDOW is a close-up view of your planet. It is used for LOCAL 
INPUT--making changes to the planet, and for OUTPUT--investigating the 
planet and seeing the results of your input. 

The EDIT WINDOW consists of four major parts: the TITLE BAR, the DISPLAY 
AREA, the SCROLL BARS, and the EDIT WINDOW CONTROL PANEL. 


TITLE BAR
---------
Located at the top of the EDIT WINDOW, the TITLE BAR displays the name of 
your planet and the date. The date can displayed as either the RELATIVE 
date or the ABSOLUTE date, selected from the SPEED MENU. 

On the left side of the TITLE BAR is the CLOSE BOX. Clicking in this 
box will close the EDIT WINDOW. The window can be reopened by selecting 
the item "EDIT" from the WINDOWS MENU. 

On the right side of the TITLE BAR is the GROW BOX Clicking in this box 
will make the EDIT WINDOW grow until it fills the entire screen. Clicking 
it again will return the window to its former size. 

The EDIT WINDOW can be moved around the screen by clicking and dragging the 
TITLE BAR. 

				> 57 <


EDIT WINDOW DISPLAY AREA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is where you are shown your planet in a close-up view. The 
information you are shown here is controlled by the EDIT WINDOW 
CONTROL PANEL. 

There are two scales that can be shown in this display: Normal 
and Compressed. If you select "Compress Edit Screen" from the 
OPTIONS MENU, this window will only display every other tile. This 
will give you less exact information, but will show you four times 
as much of the area of your planet as the Normal view. This 
is especially useful on machines with small screens (Mac Plus, SE, 
SE/30). This is the view that prints out with the PRINT option on 
the FILE MENU. 

Using the HELP function (hold the SHIFT KEY and click) in 
the EDIT WINDOW DISPLAY AREA will bring up a window 
detailing all the information that the simulation has about 
the spot where you clicked. 

Messages from the simulation and the SimEarthlings will 
sometimes appear at the top of the display area. 

TERRAIN AND ELEVATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are 32 levels of terrain. The lighter the shade, the higher 
the altitude. Each different shade represents a change of 500 meters. 
Since altitude is measured from sea level, and sea level can be 
anywhere--or nowhere--there is no exact altitude that can be assigned 
to each shade. 

There are three types of sea displays, depending on the depth of the water.

SHELF	--O to 1000 meters deep
OCEAN	--1001 to 2500 meters deep
DEEP SEA--greater than 2500 meters deep

SCROLLING THE TERRAIN 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Depending on your computer, there may or may not be SCROLL BARS along the 
right and bottom of the EDIT WINDOW. If they are there, you can use them 
to scroll the terrain in the EDIT WINDOW to see different parts of 
the planet. Click on the arrows or the bars, or drag the scroll box to 
cause scrolling.

				> 58 <

If there are no SCROLL BARS, then scrolling is accomplished by moving the 
pointer to any edge or corner of the screen. For keyboard-controlled 
scrolling, see the SimEarth addendum for your machine.

SIZE BOX 
~~~~~~~~
In the lower-right corner of the window is the SIZE BOX. Clicking and 
dragging this box will allow you to re-size the EDIT WINDOW.

EDIT WINDOW CONTROL PANEL 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This control panel is for controlling both the information viewed 
in the EDIT WINDOW and for accessing the tools for planet modification.

Using the HELP function (hold the SHIFT KEY and click) in the CONTROL PANEL 
will bring up a small window with information about each of the items and 
buttons.

There are four sections to the EDIT WINDOW CONTROL 
PANEL: the TOOL ICONS, the CURRENT TOOL DISPLAY, the 
       DATA LAYER BUTTONS, and the CLIMATE OVERLAY BUTTONS. 

TOOL ICONS
~~~~~~~~~~
By clicking on these icons, you access the tools for modify-
ing your planet. There are six icons, three of which have 
submenus. Just below the Tool Icons is a box displaying the 
active icon and giving budget information for using that 
tool. 

Every time you use one of the TOOL ICONS it will deplete 
your precious energy stores. 

PLACE Life allows you to choose and place life and 
cities on the planet. This icon also allows you access 
to various terraforming tools for use on Mars and Venus. 

Use this tool to spread life on the planet, to set various life-
forms in competition with each other, and to test living 
conditions for various life-forms. 


				> 59 <

To select a life-form, city, or terraformer, click and hold on the 
PLACE LIFE icon. A submenu will appear. While holding the 
mouse button down, move the pointer to highlight the life, city, 
or terraformer of your choice, and then release the button. 

Your choice will appear in the CURRENT TOOL DISPLAY, just 
below the icons, along with the cost in energy to place or use it. 

To place the life, city, or terraformer on the planet, point to a 
spot in the display area and click. 

There are 15 classes of life in SimEarth, seven in the sea, and 
eight on land. Each class of life is represented in SimEarth by 16 
species. 

Only 14 of the classes of life are available in the PLACE LIFE tool. 
CARNIFEROUS mobile, carnivorous plants that can develop intelligence
will sometimes evolve, but cannot be placed. 

There are seven types of cities, each representing a level of 
Civilisation and technology. Most levels of technology are represented 
by cities with three population densities. Each of these levels also 
has a travelling population that represents sentients moving around, 
as well as trade and communication. The exception to this is the 
Nanotech Age, which is the highest level of technology in SimEarth. 
It has four levels of density, and no travelling population: we assume 
that they have matter transporters for instantaneous moving of people 
and products. 

There are seven terraformers. 

A complete description of the 15 classes of life in SimEarth is found later 
in this manual, in the chapter "Life." A complete description of the 
cities is covered in the chapter "Civilization." The terraformers 
will be covered in detail here. 

				> 60 <

The classes of life and cities available to place, with their cost 
in energy, are: 

SEA LIFE CLASSES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 PROKARYOTE--Single-celled life with no nucleus (bacteria). 35 E.U.
 EUKARYOTE --Single-celled life with nucleus (amebas). 70 E.U.

 (Wheres the PiNK FLuFFY KiWiS ???? Hahaha Fukkas!)

CITIES 
~~~~~~
The dates mentioned below are for reference to Earth only, and do 
not necessarily correspond with dates in SimEarth.

TERRAFORMERS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Terraformers are tools for turning Venus and Mars into earth-like planets. 
They aren't needed on Earth, or planets that are earth-like to begin 
with, but go ahead and try them to see what happens. Once placed, 
Terraformers keep working. Don't place too many--the only way to stop one 
is to hit it with a Meteor, Fire, or a Volcano. 

BIOME FACTORY--When terraforming Mars or Venus, place the Biome
Factory instead of individual biomes. The Biome Factory, once 
placed, looks at the terrain and climate and starts producing the 
appropriate biome type that can survive there. It will also detect 
changes in climate, and change the biomes it produces to a type that 
will survive the changes. Biome Factories cost 500 E.U. 

OXYGENATOR--The Oxygenator takes carbon dioxide (CO2) out of the
atmosphere and spits out free oxygen. Life requires a certain 
percentage of oxygen, between 15 to 25%, to survive. Too much oxygen 
on a planet will cause fires. Since it lessens the CO2, a greenhouse 
gas, the Oxygenator will help cool a hot planet. An Oxygenator 
costs 500 E.U. 

N2 GENERATOR--The N2 (nitrogen) Generator is used to increase
atmospheric pressure on a planet. The atmospheric density affects 
the planet's temperature--a denser atmosphere allows the planet 
to retain more heat. The thinner the atmosphere, the colder the 
planet. Also, having a denser atmosphere with lots of N2 
stabilises the percentages of the other gases. An N2 
Generator costs 500 E.U. 
				
				> 62 <


VAPORATOR - The vaporator spews water vapours into the atmosphere 
raising the overall humidity of the planet and increasing rainfall.
A Vaportator costs 500 E.U.

CO2 GENERATOR - The CO2 Generator produces CO2 which is necessary
for plants to live. A CO2 generator costs 500E.U.

MONOLITH - The monolith isnt a terraforma but we didnt have anywhere 
else to put it in the program. It is an Evolution speed-up device (our
thanks to Arthur C. Clarke) --> (And they call US pirates!! ;-)

The use it select the monolith then immediately click on a life-form.
There is a one-in-three chance of that life form suddenly mutating
to a higher level, which immediately moves you to the next Time 
Scale. It costs 2500E.U. to use a Monolith, whether or not it works.

The monolith cant be used on all life forms - If you try to use the
monolith on a life-form that cannot mutate, the program will beep
at you, but there will be no energy charge.

A disadvantage of using the monlith is that you could jump ahead into 
the civilization timescale before enough fossil fuels have been 
generated, and civilisation will collapse. Also, you need a wide
population base to advance to the next technology level. Dont
rush to a new timescale at the expsense of your population.

If you successfully use the monolith in the technology time scale 
it will bring about the exodus event.

ICE METEOR - The ice Meteor is a huge chunk of ice that you can crash
into a dry planet to add water to the planetary system. An Ice 
Meteor costs 500E.U.

THE EXTINCT FUNCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An added feature of the PLACE LIFE tool is the EXTINCT FUNCTION. If 
you want to remove a particular class of life from the planet, hold
down either the OPTION KEY or the CONTROL KEY (depending on 
your machine), the click on the PLACE LIFE icon and select a life form
from the PLACE LIFE submenu. All oocurrences of the life form you
choose will dissappear.

				> 63 <

The EXTINCT FUNCTION only works on life-forms--not on cities. If you want 
to eliminate a life-form, you must do it before it reaches 
sentience and builds cities. 

EVENT TRIGGER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The EVENT TRIGGER lets you select and activate various events at various 
places on your planet. 

The simulation will cause events to occur automatically, depending 
on many factors including the age of the planet, the climate, air 
and water temperatures, and sea level. 

There are 11 possible events that occur in SimEarth. Three of 
them, exodus, war and pollution, will occur, but cannot be 
triggered by the user. 

By triggering events yourself, you can learn the effects these 
events have on local populations as well as to the planet as a whole. 

To activate events, click and hold on the EVENT TRIGGER icon. A 
submenu will appear, giving you a choice of eight events. While 
the mouse button is still down, slide the pointer to the right so it 
highlights the event you want to place, and release the button. 

The selected event will appear in the CURRENT TOOL DISPLAY, just below the 
icons, along with the cost in energy to trigger it. 

Next, move the pointer to the DISPLAY AREA, and click the mouse button to 
trigger an event on your planet. Click again in another place to 
cause the same event. 

A complete description of all events and their causes and effects will 
be covered in the chapter "Events." 

The available events in SimEarth, and their cost in energy, are:

  Hurricane   --High winds and rain. 50 E.U.

  TIDAL WAVE  --A huge, destructive ocean wave. 50 E.U.

  METEOR      --A huge rock from space that crashes into your planet. 
 		50 E.U.

  VOLCANO     --An explosive leak in the planet's surface that spews molten 
		rock. 50 E.U. 

				> 64 <
  ATOMIC TEST --An atomic explosion. 50 E.U.

  FIRE        --Hot stuff. 50 E.U.

  EARTHQUAKE  --Shake, rattle and roll. 50 E.U. Clicking and holding 
		on the Earthquake icon brings up a submenu that allows 
		you to direct the Earthquake's energies. 

  PLAGUE      --A deadly disease. 50 E.U. 

  PLANT BIOME --allows you to place or plant biomes onto your planet.

A biome is a major ecological community of plants and animals. Biomes will 
automatically be placed on the planet by the simulation. Their quantity and
location is primarily controlled by altitude, temperature, and rainfall.

With this tool you can place any of the biomes anywhere on the planet at 
any time. Of course, they won't necessarily stay there. An Arctic 
biome will not last long in the hot equatorial zone, and a Jungle will 
not thrive at a planet's pole. 

Place biomes to experiment, and to help shape or speed up development 
on your planet. 

To use this tool, click and hold on the PLANT BIOME icon. A submenu 
will appear, giving you a choice of eight biomes. While the mouse 
button is still down, slide the pointer to the right so it highlights 
the biome you want to plant, and release the button. The selected biome 
will appear in the CURRENT TOOL 

DISPLAY, just below the icons, along with the cost in energy to place 
it. There is an energy cost of 50 E.U. for each biome planted. 

Next, move the pointer to the DISPLAY AREA, and click the mouse button 
to place a biome on your planet. The button can be held down while the 
mouse is slowly moved to place multiple segments. A click will be 
heard as each BIOME is placed. The pitch of the click will raise 
and lower with the terrain altitude. 

A complete description of all the biomes in SimEarth will be found later 
in this manual in the chapter "Life." There are seven available biomes 
in SimEarth, plus ROCK, which represents a lack of a biome in a location. 

				> 65 <
BIOME TYPES
~~~~~~~~~~~

ROCK	--No biome.
ARCTIC	--Can survive in a cold and dry climate.
BOREAL FOREST--Can survive in cold temperatures, with moderate to 
               high rainfall.
DESERT	     --Can survive in moderate to hot temperatures, with very 
               little rainfall.
TEMPERATE GRASSLANDS--Can survive in areas with moderate 
                      temperatures and rainfall.
FOREST      --Can survive with moderate temperatures and high rainfall.
JUNGLE      --Can survive with high temperatures and rainfall.
SWAMP       --Can survive with high temperatures and moderate rainfall.


BIOME PREFERENCE CHART
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
           		DRY	 	MODERATE 	WET
           		(<30 cm/yr)	(30-90 cm/yr)   (>90 cm/yr)
COLD(<0C)   		Arctic		Boreal Forest 	Boreal Forest
MODERATE (0-25C) 	Desert		Temp.Grasslands Forest
HOT (>25C) 		Desert		Swamp 		Jungle

Biome preferences are also influenced by altitude and the 
amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.

			----------------------

SET ALTITUDE allows you to raise or lower sections of land. There are 32 
possible levels of terrain in SimEarth.

Use this tool to raise or level mountain ranges, create islands in 
the ocean, or lakes in dry land. All these changes will have 
impact on climate, rainfall, local biomes, and local life-forms.

Click on the SET ALTITUDE icon. Look at the CURRENT TOOL DISPLaY. It shows 
that the SET ALTITUDE tool is active in "raise terrain" mode.

				> 66 <


Move the pointer to the DISPLAY AREA. Click and hold the mouse button over 
land or water, and the land around the pointer will be raised in altitude, 
displayed by a lightening of the color or shade of the land. 

Click on the SET ALTITUDE icon again, and look at the CURRENT TOOL DISPLAY. 
It shows that the SET ALTITUDE tool is active in "lower terrain" mode. 

Move the pointer to the DISPLAY AREA. Click and hold the mouse button over 
land, and the land around the pointer will be lowered in altitude, 
displayed by a darkening of the color or shade of the land. 

Levels of terrain are displayed in shades. The lighter the shade, the 
higher the altitude. Each different shade represents a change of 
500 meters. Since altitude is measured from sea level, and sea level 
can be anywhere--or nowhere--there is no exact altitude that can be 
assigned to each shade. 

The cost for using the SET ALTITUDE tool to raise or lower the 
terrain is 50 E.U.

			----------------------

MOVING TOOL lets you pick any biome, niche, or Civilisation and move it.

This can be useful for transplanting populations to other
continents, or separating warring tribes. Since niches and biomes 
can occupy the same space in the display, you can use this tool to 
temporarily move the niche to see the biome that is displayed 
underneath it. 

Click on the MOVING TOOL icon to activate it, then click and hold on a 
biome, niche or civilization. Drag the pointer to the destination 
location, and release the mouse button. 

The cost for using the MOVING TOOL is 30 E.U. 


				> 67 <


EXAMINE gives you information on individual spots in the DISPLAY AREA. 

Click on the EXAMINE icon, and the mouse pointer changes to 
a magnifying glass. 

Then click and hold on a spot in the DISPLAY AREA. An information window 
will appear, giving you all the information that the simulation
has about that spot. 

If you click and hold the button, and slowly drag the pointer across 
the screen, the information window will change and report on each section 
as you point to it. 

The EXAMINE function is very useful for gathering information about 
specific areas of your planet. You will need this information for 
planning your next moves in planet development. 

The same information window can be accessed by using the HELP 
function hold the SHIFT KEY or HELP KEY while clicking on a spot) in 
the DISPLAY AREA. 

The EXAMINE tool only gives information on places in the display window. For
information on icons and tools, use the HELP function. 

The cost for using the EXAMINE tool is 5 E.U. 

There are four sections to the EXAMINE WINDOW: the Biome Section, 
the Life Section, the City Section, and the Altitude/Magma Section. 

BIOME SECTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Biome Section shows a picture of the local biome (if any), and a 
description of its present condition, i.e., thriving, dying, etc. Next, 
it displays the rainfall, air temperature (heat), and wind direction. 

If there is no biome present, this section will display the message 
"No Biome."

LIFE SECTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
If there is life, the Life Section shows a big picture of the 
predominant class of non-sentient life in that location. (Sentient life 
is treated separately in the City Section.) Below that are three small 
pictures. The middle one is the present species of the class, the left 
one is the species that it evolved from, and the right one is the 
species that, if all goes well, it will evolve into. 

				> 68 <


Below that is a chart of how that life class gets along in the 
various habitats, with picture rating of how happy the species are there: 
(KEWL ANSIS HERE DUDEZ, REMEMBER TO VOTE FOR ME IN THE ANSI WORLD 
 CHARTS H0H0H0!!! )

 X   Can't live there.
 
 8-( Can survive there, but it's miserable.
 
 8-| Can survive there, and quite nicely.

 8-) Paradise.


If there is no life, this section will display the message "No Life." 

CITY SECTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
If there are no sapients near, this section will display the message 
"No Sapients." 

If there are sapients, but no city, this section will display the 
message "Lightly Inhabited." 

If there is a city, this section displays a large picture of the 
city, and tells the sapient class, the technology level, and the 
population. 


ALTITUDE/MAGMA SECTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This section, at the bottom of the window, displays this location's 
altitude and direction of magma flow. 

CURRENT TOOL DISPLAY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The CURRENT TOOL DISPLAY shows the active icon, tool, life-form, biome, 
terraformer, or event, and the energy cost to use it. 

DATA LAYER BUTTONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These buttons control what data is displayed in the DISPLAY AREA. By 
clicking on these buttons, you toggle on and off the various layers of 
data. Using these buttons does not change the planet, or affect the 
model in any way--it only changes your view of the planet. 

The default settings for these buttons changes with the Time Scale. In the 
Geologic Time Scale, the default setting has everything on except 
BIOMES and CITIES. In the Evolution Time Scale, everything is on 
except CITIES. In both the Civilisation and Technology Time Scales, 
everything but LIFE defaults to the "on" setting. 

				> 69 <

OCEANS allows you to turn off and on the display of the Oceans, allowing 
       you to see the elevation of the sea bottom. 

BIOMES allows you to turn off and on the display of Biomes, so you can 
       see the elevation of the terrain, and see Life and Cities more 
       clearly. 

ClTIES allows you to turn off and on the display of the Cities of the 
       current sentient species. 

LIFE   allows you to turn off and on the display of life-forms. Since 
       these are so numerous and fast-moving, you may want to turn these 
       off every so often to get a clearer view of the other things on 
       your planet. This display is of individual species, not classes
       --there are 240 different species in SimEarth. 

EVENTS allows you to turn off and on the display of Events.

CLIMATE OVERLAY BUTTONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These buttons also control what data is displayed in the DISPLAY AREA. By 
clicking on these buttons, you toggle on and off the various layers of 
climate data. Using these buttons does not change the planet, or affect 
the model in any way--it only changes your view of the planet. 

The default setting for all these buttons is OFF. Only one climate 
overlay can be active at any one time. 

HEAT--A display of air temperature. Higher temperatures are represented by 
darker shades. 

RAINFALL--A display of average rainfall. Higher rainfall densities are 
	  represented by darker shades. 

WINDS   --A display of the wind currents.

SEA FLOW--A display of the sea currents.

SEA HEAT--A display of water temperature. Higher temperatures are repre-
	  sented by darker shades. 

MAGMA   --A display of the magma currents under the planet's crust.

AUAILABLE ENERGY DISPLAY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This display lets you know how much energy you have left for 
planet manipulation and modification. The maximum energy that can be 
stored is set by the game level. 

For a complete explanation, see the chapter "Energy." 

				> 70 <


MAP WINDOW
~~~~~~~~~~
The MAP WINDOW is your overview of the whole planet.  It can be viewed as
a MAP WINDOW flat or spherical projection.

The MAP WINDOW consists of three major parts: the TITLE BAR, the MAP
DISPLAY AREA, and the CONTROL PANEL

TITLE BAR
~~~~~~~~~
The  TITLE  BAR  displays  the type of map being shown in the MAP DISPLAY
AREA and the date.

On  the  left  side  of the TITLE BAR is the CLOSE BOX.  Clicking in this
box will close the MAP WINDOW.  You can bring the window back by selecting
the MAP item in the WINDOWS MENU.

The  MAP WINDOW can be moved on the screen by clicking and holding in the
TITLE BAR, and dragging the window to its new location.

MAP WINDOW DISPLAY AREA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  MAP WINDOW DISPLAY AREA is where the map of the planet is displayed.
There  are  many  different  types  of displays and views of your planet,
which are selected in the MAP WINDOW CONTROL PANEL.


				> 71 <

In  the MAP DISPLAY AREA you will see the EDIT RECTANGLE.  This rectangle
indicates  the  area of the world that is visible in the EDIT WINDOW.  If
you  double- click in the EDIT RECTANGLE, the EDIT WINDOW will be brought
to the front.

Messages  from  the  simulation and the SimEarthlings sometimes appear at
the top of the MAP DISPLAY AREA.

MAP  WINDOW CONTROL PANEL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  MAP WINDOW CONTROL PANEL allows you to look at various views of your
planet,  giving  different  types of information in each view.  From here
you  can also access all of the MODEL CONTROL PANELS, the HISTORY WINDOW,
the EDIT WINDOW, and all the GRAPHS.


MAP DISPLAY ICONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Along  the  top  of  the  MAP WINDOW CONTROL PANEL, from the left, are 12
icons.  Clicking on each of these icons displays different information in
the  MAP  DISPLAY  AREA.  These 12 displays are divided into five groups:
GEOSPHERE,  HYDROSPHERE,  ATMOSPHERE,  BIO(SPHERE) and CIV(ILIZATION).  A
MODEL  CONTROL  PANEL  can  be  accessed  for  four  of  the  five groups
(excluding HYDROSPHERE) by clicking on the name of that group.

GEOSPHERE  GROUP
----------------
The  GEOSPHERE  group  gives information on the terrain, events and magma
flow  of  the  planet.   Clicking  on  the  GEOSPHERE  icon brings up the
GEOSPHERE MODEL CONTROL PANEL.


TERRAIN MAP
-----------
Shows  oceans and altitude across the planet.  Higher altitudes are shown
in  lighter shades, lower altitudes are darker.  Water is shown as either
blue or black, depending on your monitor.

A  legend  of the altitude is visible in the INFO BOX near the right side
of the MAP WINDOW CONTROL PANEL.

An  extra feature accessed through this icon is a display of landmarks on
the scenario planets.  Click and hold on the icon, and names of landmarks
will  be displayed until you release the mouse button.  This is available
only  on  scenario planets.  Random planets have no landmarks.  Landmarks
on  Earth  will  stop  being displayed 2,000,000 years in the future.  We
figure the names will change by then.

				> 72 <

Double-clicking in this icon will open the GAIA WINDOW.


GLOBAL  EVENT  MAP
-----------------
Shows  global  events,  such  as  hurricanes,  forest fires, earthquakes,
meteorites, wars, etc., as small symbols.

A  key  to  the  symbols is visible in the INFO BOX near the right of the
CONTROL PANEL.

CONTINENTAL DRIFT MAP
---------------------
Shows the currents within the magma layer.

Magma is the hot molten rock within the earth, upon which the continental
plates  are  "floating."  The  currents  here determine the direction and
speed of continental drift.

A  legend  of  the magma current vectors is available for this map in the
INFO BOX.

HYDROSPHERE GROUP
-----------------
This group gives information on the ocean.  There is no
MODEL CONTROL PANEL for the Hydrosphere.


HIDE/SHOW OCEANS
----------------
toggles  the ocean display on and off so you can see the elevation of the
ocean  floor.   This  doesn't  make  the  ocean go away--it just makes it
invisible.   This  option is used in combination with other maps, and has
no legend in the INFO BOX.

OCEAN TEMPERATURE
-----------------
Displays the average annual ocean temperature.

In  most cases this will correspond closely with the air temperature, but
it will change much more slowly.


				> 73 <


The  INFO  BOX  can display both a legend to the ocean temperatures and a
graph  of  average  ocean temperature over time.  To switch between these
two  displays,  click on the INFO BUTTON in the lower-right corner of the
MAP WINDOW CONTROL PANEL.

If  you  click  and hold on the INFO BOX (regardless of the status of the
INFO  BUTTON) and slowly move the mouse back and forth, you will be shown
an animated history of continental drift on your planet.

Note:   Two  Events,  Pollution and Exodus, are not included in the Event
        Map legend, but will appear on the map when they occur.


				> 77 <

BUTTONS
~~~~~~~
There are three buttons on the far right side of the MAP CONTROL PANEL.

EDIT brings the EDIT WINDOW to the front.

GLOBE  changes  the MAP' WINDOW view from a flat robinson projection to a
spherically mapped globe projection.  All maps and displays are available
in GLOBE mode--the MAP WINDOW CONTROL PANEL doesn't change.  When in this
mode,  the  GLOBE  BUTTON  will be highlighted. Clicking on the GLOBE
BUTTON again will return you to the flat projection.

The  EDIT  RECTANGLE  becomes  an  EDIT  TRAPEZOID  on the GLOBE.  If you

ACCESS TO GRAPHS AND WINDOWS FROM MAP WINDOW CONTROL PANEL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-- A single line represents a single click.

== A double line represents a double click.

				> 79 <

GAIA W|NDOW 
~~~~~~~~~~~
The  GAIAWINDOW  shows  Gaia,  a  caricature  of  the Earth as one living
organism.   This  "face of the planet" will give you constant feedback on
the planet's "mood."

This  window can be opened by selecting GAIA from the WINDOWS MENU, or by
double-clicking on the TERRAIN I MAP icon in the MAP WINDOW.

The  planet's mood is based on how well life on the planet is doing.  The
face  will  be  asleep until life forms, then it will wake up.  The moods
range  from  bliss to horror.  Everything that happens and everything you
do affects the face.

At  the  bottom  of this window is a little message bar that will display
messages  from Gaia.  In the upper-right corner of the window is the Sun.
As  solar  heat  increases  through  time,  the  Sun will slowly begin to
enlarge.   At the end of your planet's 10 billion-year life, the Sun will
burn up Gaia.

You  may  want  to keep this window in a corner of the screen, and let it
guide you as you develop your planet.

Its eyes will follow the pointer around the screen.  Please don't poke it
in the eye.

				> 80 <

The  HISTORY  WINDOW  provides  a  graphical  record of many factors that
define H|STORY your planet.

Use this window for tracking the changes and development of your planet's
chemical:    composition,   temperature,   humidity,  life,  events,  and
pollution.

This  window is accessed through the WINDOWS MENU, and by double-clicking
on the INFO BOX in the MAP WINDOW CONTROL PANEL.

Click  on  any  of  the  icons  at the bottom of the window to toggle the
display of that factor on and off.

There  are  15 items that can be displayed as a graph in this window.  Up
to four items can be displayed at a time.

CO2 displays Carbon Dioxide levels in the atmosphere.

O2 displays Oxygen levels in the atmosphere.

CH4 displays Methane levels in the atmosphere.

SEA TEMPERATURE displays overall average temperature of the oceans.

AIR TEMPERATURE displays overall average temperature of the atmosphere.

RAINFALL displays overall average planetary rainfall.

POPULATION displays population of the sentient species on your planet.

BIOMASS  displays  the total weight of all plant and animal matter on the
planet.  The biomass of Earth is 99% plant material.

DIVERSITY displays the number of different species of life on the planet.
Major extinctions will be visible here.

				> 81 <

FOSSIL FUELS displays the amount of fossil fuel reserves still within the
planet.   This  amount  grows  during the Evolution Time Scale as biomass
decays, and is depleted by civilisation.

ATOMIC  FUEL  displays  the  amount  of  atomic  fuel reserves within the
planet.

FOOD displays the total amount of food produced on the planet.

WAR displays the level of armed conflict across the planet.

PLAGUE displays the number of plague events that have occurred.

POLLUTION  displays  the  total  amount of toxic releases by the sentient
species.

To  keep the planet data file at a reasonable size, a complete history is
not  saved  with  the  planet.   Once  the graph goes off the left of the
HISTORY WINDOW it is lost forever.

There  will  be  a  dividing  line  to  mark when one Time Scale ends and
another begins.

The amount of time displayed per division in this window is different for
each  of  the  Time  Scales.  The full width of the HISTORY WINDOW covers
approximately:    

  1,000,000,000   years in  the Geologic  Time  Scale;
     70,000,000   years in  the Evolution  Time  Scale;  
          2,500   years in the Civilisation Time Scale; 
         and 50   years in the Technology Time Scale.

The REPORT WINDOW  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Is  your  main  source  of feedback on how well both you and life on your
planet  are  doing.  The information in the REPORT WINDOW changes for the
various  Time  Scales,  giving  information  that is useful for each era.
There is also a special REPORT WfNDOW for the Daisyworld Scenario.

REPORT  WINDOW  IN THE GEOLOGIC TIME SCALE 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In this Time Scale, the REPORT WINDOW gives four items of information.

VIABILITY  This  rating  tells you how hospitable your world is to multi-
celled animals.  Viability is based on the oxygen and dust content of the
atmosphere.  The rating levels are:

X Life cannot exist here.

;-( Life can exist, but barely.
 
;-| Life can exist fairly well.

;-) Paradise.


BIOMASS  
-------
Biomass  is the total weight of all plants and animals on the planet.  In
the  Geologic  Time  Scale  there are no plants, so the Biomass is formed
entirely  of  Eukaryotes.   The  theoretical maximum value for Biomass in
this Time Scale is 40,960.

HIGHEST LIFE 
------------
This is a display of the most advanced microbe life-form.

CURRENT  TASK  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Your  CURRENT  TASK  is what needs to be accomplished before moving on to
the next Time Scale.


				> 83 <


REPORT WINDOW IN THE EVOLUTION TIME SCALE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In  this  Time  Scale,  the  REPORT  WINDOW  gives  a  few  more items of
information.


INTELLIGENCE  
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This  is a display of the "race to intelligence." The three most advanced
forms  of  life are listed, and given an "intelligence" rating (IQ).  This
rating  is  just  a rough estimate of how advanced the life-forms are and
does not relate to human IQ levels.

This display show the leaders in the race to sentience.  When a life-form
reaches an IQ of 100, it becomes sentient.

BIOMASS  
~~~~~~~
Biomass  in  the  Evolution Time Scale consists of the com- bined mass of
both  the  animal  life  and  the  biomes--plant  life.   Jungles are the
richest,  highest  mass biomes, Deserts the poorest and lowest mass.  The
theoretical maximum value for biomass is 180,224.

The icon shown for Biomass is the predominant biome.

VIABILITY  
~~~~~~~~~
This  rating  tells  you  how  hospitable  your  world is to multi-celled
animals.   Viability  is  based  on  the  oxygen  and dust content of the
atmosphere.   The  rating  levels  are the same as in the Geologic REPORT
WINDOW.

GROWTH  
~~~~~~
The  biomass  requires CO2 for survival and growth.  The Growth rating is
based on the CO2 content of the atmosphere.

CURRENT TASK  
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Your  CURRENT  TASK  is what needs to be accomplished before moving on to
the next Time Scale.

				> 84 <


REPORT  WINDOW  IN  THE  CIVILISATION AND TECHNOLOGY TIME SCALES 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In these Time Scales, you are given much more information.

SENTIENT TYPE  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This tells you what class of life is the dominant, intelligent species on
your planet.

HIGHEST TECHNOLOGY  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tells you the highest level of Civilisation on your planet.

MEDIAN TECHNOLOGY 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tells you the average technology level of your planet

POPULATION
~~~~~~~~~~
Population tells  the  current  population  of  your  planet's  sentient
species.

LIFE  QUALITY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Gives  an  overall  "quality  of life" rating for the sentient species on
your planet.  The two factors taken into consideration in this rating are
number  of  work hours per week, and your allocation of resources to Arts
and  Media.   It  is  difficult to have a life quality above tolerable in
lower technology levels.

The  possible  quality  levels are:  Heavenly, Marvelous, Good, Pleasant,
Tolerable Unpleasant, Bad, Miserable, and Hellish.

HABITATS  shows  the  ability  of your sentient species to survive in the
various biomes, and how well they are adapted to the habitat.  The rating
levels are:

X Can't live there at all.

;-( Can live there, but hates it.

;-| Can live there, and likes it.

;-) Paradise.


				> 85 <


ENERGY SECTION 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Below  the  Habitats  is a large section that deals with energy.  To best
understand  what  happens  here,  look  at  the  REPORT  WINDOW  and  the
CIVILISATION MODEL CONTROL PANEL side-by-side.

WORK  is  the  amount  of hours per week that your sentient SimEarthlings
must  work  to  survive.   In SimEarth, we have simplified the concept of
work:  all work produces energy.

The amount of time intelligent SimEarthlings work is divided between five
different  energy  sources.   The amount of time worked to produce energy
from each of the five sources is set on the left side of the CIVILISATION
MODEL  CONTROL  PANEL.  The total number of hours worked per week affects
the quality of life.


TYPES OF ENERGY  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BIOENERGY-- Burning  wood,  animal power, plant power (farming), work done
by hand by the sentient species.

SOLAR/WlND-- Sun-drying  of  food  and  clothes, windmills, sailing ships,
solar  heating, wind-powered generators, solar electric cells, satellites
collecting solar energy.

HYDRO/GEO -- Waterwheels,  dams,  steam  power,  hydroelectric  power,
geothermal power.

FOSSIL FUEL--Coal and oil made from long-dead animals.

NUCLEAR    --Atomic power plants.


EFFICIENCY  
~~~~~~~~~~
Is a rating of how much energy you receive for the amount of work put in.
The   efficiency   of  each  energy  source  varies  with  the  level  of
technology.

				> 86 <


ENERGY EFFICIENCY VS. TECHNOLOGY LEVEL.

			Bioenergy  Solar/Wind  Hydro  Fossil  Nuclear
                        ---------- ----------- ------ ------- -------
Stone Age                  40% 		20% 	10% 	0% 	0%

Bronze Age 		   40% 		20% 	30% 	10% 	0%

IronAge			   60%		20%	30%	30%	0%

Industrial Age		   60%		30%	50%	80%	10%

AtomicAge		   70%		50%	50%	80%	80%

Information Age		   80%		60%	60%	90%	90%

Nanotech Age	 	   90%		80%	80%	90%	90%


The efficiency rating displayed and used in the REPORT WINDOW is averaged
over the number of the~various technologies.  For example, if your planet
has one city in the Nanotech Age, and one city in the Stone Age, then the
displayed  efficiency rating for Atomic Energy would be 45% (1 city * 90%
+ 1 city * 0%/2 cities).

This  rating  can be changed by the availability of resources.  As fossil
fuel and atomic fuel run out, their efficiency rating declines to 0%.

ENERGY is the amount of each type of energy produced, with a total for all 
combined energy sources. 

All energy that is produced is used. The total energy produced will 
roughly equal the total of all the allocated energy. There is some 
energy lost, and some rounding off of numbers for the display, but 
it all gets used. 

ALLOCATION  is  what  your  sentients are doing with the energy.  All the
energy  produced  is  allocated and used.  Allocation is set on the right
side of the CIVILISATION MODEL CONTROL PANEL


				> 87 <

The possible uses that you can allocate energy to are: 

PHILOSOPHY--Philosophy is a deterrent to war. Investing in philosophy 
reduces the number and intensity of violent conflicts on your planet. 

SCIENCE--Investing in science helps your civilisations advance to higher 
technology  levels.  You must have at least some investment in science to
advance  at all.  Advancing technology levels too fast, or without a fair
share  of  philosophy,  agriculture,  medicine,  and  art/media  does not
produce  a stable, long-lasting civilization.  If you invest too much too
soon in science, your population will die off from war and plague.

AGRlCULTURE-- Investing in agriculture increases food production, which 
increases the rate of population growth of your sentient species.

MEDICINE--Investment  in  medicine  reduces  the  number  and severity of
plagues.

ART/MEDIA--Investment  in  art/media improves the quality of life of your
SimEarthling global citizen.

CURRENT/TASK--  Tells you what needs to be accomplished to advance to the
next Time Scale.


REPORT WINDOW IN THE DAISYWORLD SCENARIO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the Daisyworld Scenario, you are only given four items of information.

MAJOR DAISY 
-----------
This is a display of the shade of the most populous Daisy.

EMPTY SPACE
----------- 
This shows you how much open land there is on the planet to fill 
with Daisies.

MAJOR ANIMAL
------------ 
This shows the most populous animal (if any) on the planet.

CURRENT TASK
------------ 
Your Daisy-raising goal.

				> 88 <


REPORT WINDOW IN THE TERRAFORMING SCENARIOS 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In  the Terraforming Scenarios, Mars and Venus, you are given much of the
same  information  as  in the CIVILISATION and TECHNOLOGY REPORT WINDOWS,
but with added terraforming progress feedback.

VIABILITY 
~~~~~~~~~
This rating tells you how hospitable your world is to life.  Viability is
based  on  the  oxygen  and  dust  content of the atmosphere.  The rating
levels  are  the  same as in the geologicAL, CIVILISATION, and TECHNOLOGY
REPORT WINDOWS.

GOAL BIOMASS 
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This  is the biomass that you must attain before the planet is considered
terraformed.

BIOMASS 
~~~~~~~
This  is  your world's present biomass.  The icon shown fo Biomass is the
predominant biome.

GOAL POPULATION 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the population your planet must reach to be considered colonized.

POPULATION
~~~~~~~~~~
This is your present population.

HABITAT AND ENERGY 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  HABITAT  and  ENERGY  sections of this window are the same as in the
CIVILISATION and TECHNOLOGY REPORT WINDOWS, with two exceptions:

These  sections  will  not  appear in the window until you have begun the
colonisation process (placing sentient life on the planet).

The  HABITAT  section  will  always  display the information for sentient
mammals since the majority of SimEarth players are mammals.

CURRENT TASK 
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Your current task is to terraform and Colonise the planet.

				> 89 <

TUTORIAL WINDOW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The TUTORIAL WINDOW is a text window that gives a brief review 
of the tutorial in this manual. It can be accessed through the 
WINDOWS MENU.


Like  all  help  and text windows in SimEarth, it can be moved around the
screen  and  re-sized.  Click on the up and down arrows in the Scroll Bar
on the right side of the window to scroll through the text.

Depending on your computer, you may or may not be able to have this window 
open at the same time as the HELP WINDOW.

The GLOSSARY WINDOW is a special HELP WiNDOW that can be accessed through
the WINDOWS MENU.  It gives definitions for words and terms that are used
in the SimEarth program.

Like  all  help  and text windows in SimEarth, it can be moved around the
screen and resized.  Click on the up and down arrows on the right side of
the window to scroll through the text.

				> 90 <


There are four graph windows, which can be opened through the GRAPHS MENU 
and through the MAP WINDOW icons. Only one GRAPH WINDOW can be 
displayed at a time. 

These windows can be moved around the screen by clicking and dragging the 
TITLE BAR, and closed by clicking the CLOSE BOX. 

Two  of the graphs display their information over time as well as for the
present.   The  information is given in horizontal or vertical bars, with
the most current bar in front.

	--------------------------------------------------------

This graph is accessed either through the AIR SAMPLE item on the GRAPHS 
MENU or by double-clicking on the AIR TEMPERATURE icon on the MAP 
WINDOW CONTROL PANEL. 

The  ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION GRAPH gives only the atmospheric composition
for the present time.  Its information is shown in horizontal bars.

It  displays  the  chemical  composition of your planet's atmosphere.  It
gives the ratio in percentages of four gases--Nitrogen (N2), Oxygen (O2)
Carbon  Dioxide  (CO2),  and Methane (CH)--plus dust particles and water
vapor (H20).  It also gives the air pressure expressed in atmospheres.

The plusses and minuses at the end of the bars indicate whether that item
is increasing or decreasing.  If there is no plus or minus after the bar,
the level is temporarily stable.

The  shade  or  pattern of the bars is a scale indication.  

 Percentage is less than 1%.   
 Percentage is between 1 and 10%.  
 Percentage is above 10%.   
 The Air Pressure bar has its own shade, and does not change
 with the percentage.

This graph is useful for monitoring trends in atmospheric composition:

Too little oxygen, and life will end. 
Too much oxygen, and fires will burn all over the planet. 
Too little carbon dioxide, and plants will die.

				> 91 <


Too much carbon dioxide, and animals will become extinct. 
Too much dust causes solar blockage and extinctions. 
Water vapor affects rainfall. 
Water vapor, carbon dioxide and methane are greenhouse gases--high levels
will increase the greenhouse warming effect.

BIOME RATIO GRAPH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This graph is accessed either through the BIOMES item on the GRAPHS MENU 
or by double-clicking on the BIOMES icon on the MAP WINDOW CONTROL 
PANEL.


It  displays the relative amounts of the seven biomes on your planet over
time.

This  graph  is  useful for detecting and tracking trends in the dominant
biomes.

When  playing the Daisyworld Scenario, the BIOME RATIO GRAPH displays the
eight shades of daisies.

				> 92 <

This graph is accessed either through the LIFE-FORMS item on the GRAPHS 
MENU or by double-clicking on the LIFE icon on the MAP WINDOW
CONTROL PANEL.

It  displays the relative amounts of the life classes on your planet over
time.   The  14  classes from the PLACE LIFE tool are, displayed, plus the
Carnifern: a mobile carnivorous plant that can achieve sentience.

This graph is useful for tracking trends in the life on your planet.

		--------------------------------------------

This graph is accessed either through the TECHNOLOGY item on the GRAPHS
MENU or by double clicking on the CIVILISATION icon on the MAP WINDOW
CONTROL PANEL.

It   displays   the  population  ratio  between  the  various  levels  of
Civilisation on your planet.

				> 93 <

The four model control panels are used to obeserve and change the settings
of many variables in the model. These control panels are the only places in
Sim Earth that are used only for input.

These windows are reached either through the MODELS MENU or through
the MAP WINDOW CONTROL PANEL.

Only one MODEL CONTROL PANEL can be displayed at a time. You can 
cycle through the four panels forward or backward by clicking on the NEXT
and LAST buttons in the upper right corner.

There are 16 possible settings for each item on each control panel.

To change model settings, first click on the item you want to change. The
name of the item and an indicator (usually an arrow) will become 
highlighted. A dotted box will appear around the indicator and the SLIDER
CONTROL at the right of the panel will display the setting of the 
active item.

Next, click on the SLIDER CONTROL above or below the slider to increase
or decrease the setting one increment. You can also click and drag the 
slider to change settings.


Even though the life on your planet is self-regulating, and affects the
model, these changes are not shown on the model control panels. These 
panels reflect you settings and display only your changes.

There will be a lag between the time you change a MODEL CONTROL PANEL 
and the time your change takes effect.

The cost in energy for changing the control panel is 30E.U. per click 
and 150E.U. per drag. For small changes use clicks. For big changes
use drags.

If you change a panel from the lowest to the highest setting by clicking, 
it will cost you 30 E.U * 15 clicks = 450EU. The same change by dragging
would cost 150EU. You would save a lot of energy by dragging instead of
clicking.

If you change a panel setting one level, clicking would cost you 150
E.U,

				> 94 <

MODEL CONTROL PANELS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This MODEL CONTROL PANEL deals with the variable factors affecting the 
Geosphere, Meteor Impacts, and the Axial Tilt of your planet.

It can be accessed through the MODELS MENU or by clicking on the GEOSPHERE 
icon in the MAP WINDOW CONTROL PANEL.

The factors you can adjust are: 

VOLCANIC ACTIVITY   
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
controls  the  frequency  of  periodic  volcanic eruptions.   
In  early  stages  of  the  planet  this  will influence the
formation of continental areas.

EROSION  
~~~~~~~
controls  the  rate  ot  "smoothing"  of the terrain by erosion.
Increasing erosion also increases CO2 in the atmosphere.

CONTINENTAL  DRIFT  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
controls the rate at which the continents move on the
magma layer.

CORE HEAT 
~~~~~~~~~
controls the temperature of the planet's core.  The higher the
core heat, the larger and more severe the volcanos.  Also, the hotter the
core, the more the direction of magma flow will change.

CORE  FORMATION  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
controls  the rate at which the planetary core forms. As
the  core  forms, it gets larger.  The size of the core affects the speed
at  which  the  magma  flows.  The bigger the core, the slower the magma.
The  slower  the  magma,  the  smaller  the  volcanos, and the slower the
continental drift.

METEOR IMPACT 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
controls the frequency of periodic meteor (or planetesimal) 
strikes. 

AXIAL  TILT  
~~~~~~~~~~~
controls  the tilt of your planet's spin axis.  This affects
the  severity  of  the  seasons--the  greater  the  tilt, the greater the
seasonal  severity.   This  is  only  noticeable  in  the two modern Time
Scales.   The  current  tilt of the real Earth's axis is about 22 degrees
from vertical.

				> 95 <


ATMOSPHERE MODEL CONTROL PANEL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This MODEL CONTROL PANEL deals with the variable factors affecting the 
atmosphere of your planet. 

It can be accessed through the MODELS MENU or by clicking on the 
ATMOSPHERE icon in the  MAP WINDOW CONTROL PANEL. 

SOLAR  INPUT  controls 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
the incoming solar radiation (heat).  This is
the   amount   of   heat   from  the  Sun  that  hits  your  planet.
Setting the slider all the way down will turn the sun off.

CLOUD ALBEDO 
~~~~~~~~~~~~
controls the reflectivity of the clouds, which controls
the  amount  of  sunlight  (heat)  that  passes  through them to the
planet.

GREENHOUSE EFFECT 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
controls the  intensity  of  the  warming  greenhouse effect.  The 
greenhouse effect  is  caused  by  certain  gases  that block outgoing 
infrared radiation.  In SimEarth, the greenhouse gases are water 
vapor (H20), methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2)

CLOUD FORMATION 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
controls the amount of clouds formed from a given 
amount of evaporation. 

RAINFALL 
~~~~~~~~~
controls the amount of rainfall on the planet. 

SURFACE  ALBEDO  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
controls  the  reflectivity of surface biomes.  The
higher  the  albedo, the more solar radiation is reflected back into
space.

AIRSEA THERMAL 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Transfer controls the rate at which the air and ocean
can exchange heat.


				> 96 <

BIOSPHERE MODEL CONTROL PANEL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This  MODEL CONTROL PANEL deals with the variable factors affecting
the biosphere of your planet.

The factors you can adjust are:

THERMAL TOLERANCE 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Controls the  temperature  range  in  which life can survive.  The 
higher the setting, the wider the acceptable temperature range 
for life.

Reproduction  RATE  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Controls  how  quickly  life  as  a  whole  will reproduce.

CO2 ABSORPTION 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
controls how much carbon dioxide is scrubbed from theair by the plants.

ADVANCE  RATE  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Controls  the rate at which life-forms advance to the
next  higher  level  of  development  towards  intelligence.   It is
usually a change of one species.

MUTATION  RATE  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Controls  the  rate at which life-forms will mutate.
Mutations  can  jump  ahead,  skipping species, to the next class of
life.


				> 97 <


CIVILISATION MODEL CONTROL PANEL.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This  panel  is  used  to define and control the civilised, sentient
species  on  your planet.  It is only useful in the Civilisation and
Technology Time Scales.

It  can  be  accessed  through the MODELS MENU or by clicking on the
CIVILISATION icon in the MAP WINDOW CONTROL PANEL.

The  CIVILISATION  MODEL CONTROL PANEL is one of the real challenges
of  SimEarth.   You  must  make  some  important  decisions  and set
priorities  both for the types of energies you want to invest in and
the  uses  you  want to put the energy to.  This control panel has a
major  effect on the REPORT WINDOW.  It is a good idea to have these
two on the screen together.


ENERGY INVESTMENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  left side of the control panel is where you set your priorities
for investment in various types of energies.

The  greater  your priority, the longer you should make the bar next
to  the choice.  If you don't want to invest in a particular type of
energy at all, then shrink the bar to nothing.

The  total  amount of investment in all the types of energy sets the
amount  of  hours  your global citizen must work per week.  The work
week is a major factor affecting quality of life.

The  types  of energy you can invest in are:  

BIOENERGY--Burning wood,  animal power, plant power (farming), 
           work done by hand by the sentient species.

SOLAR/WlND--Sun  drying  of  food  and clothes, windmills, sailing
	    ships, solar heating,  wind-powered  generators,  solar  
            electric  cells, satellites collecting solar energy.

HYDRO/GEO --Waterwheels,  dams, steam power, hydroelectric power,
	    geothermal power.


				> 98 <

FOSSIL FUEL--Coal made from long-dead animals.

NUCLEAR    --Atomic reactors, bombs, etc.

ENERGY Allocation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  right  side  of  the  control  panel  is where you allocate the
energy.  All energy produced is used.

Rather than actual numerical settings, allocations are ratios.  This
means  that  you  should  adjust  the  length  of  the bars for each
allocation  choice  to show your priorities--the longer the bar, the
higher the priority.

If  all  the  bars are all the way up, or all are in the middle, the
model  interprets  your settings the same.  It is the differences in
lengths that matters, not the actual length.

It  is  best  not to turn any of the settings all the way off.  The
allocation  setting  has a feedback effect on the energy investment.
Low  allocations can reduce the efficiency at which technologies can
produce the energy.  This can make your technology level decline.

The   uses   to   which   you   can   put   your   energy  are:   

PHILOSOPHY--Philosophy   is   a  deterrent  to  war.   Investing  in
philosophy  reduces the number and intensity of violent conflicts on
your planet.

SCIENCE-Investing in science helps your civilisations advance to
higher technology  levels.   You  must  have  at  least  some 
investment in science to advance at all.  Advancing technology levels 
too fast, or without  a  fair  share  of  philosophy,  agriculture, 
medicine, and art/media  does not produce a stable, long-lasting 
civilisation.  If you  invest  too  much too soon in science, 
your population will die off from war and plague.

Agriculture--investing in agriculture increases food production,
which  increases  the  rate  of  population  growth of your sentient
species.

MEDICINE--investment in medicine reduces the number and severity of
plagues.

ART/MEDIA--Investment  in art/media improves the quality of life
of your SimEarthling global citizen.

               TIME SCALES - INTRODUCTION TO TIME SCALES.
               ===========================================

SimEarth  runs  in four different Time Scales:  Geologic, Evolution,
Civilisation  and Technology.  Each Time Scale simulates a different
set  of  factors  on the planet.  You can start a planet at any Time
Scale,   or  start  at  the  first  (Geologic)  and  the  game  will
automatically evolve through all the Time Scales.

In  the  Civilisation  and  Technology Time Scales, you can rush the
intelligent   SimEarthling's   advance   through   the   levels   of
civilisations by model manipulation or by using the Monolith.

Advancing  too  fast is not necessarily a good thing.  If you do not
allow  enough  time in the Geologic and Evolution Time Scales, there
won't  be  enough  fossil  fuel for the later Time Scales.  You will
need  a wide population base for continued advancement.  If you push
a small group to advance before its population has built up, it will
stagnate and die out.

				> 100 <


The  GEOLOGIC  Time  Scale  begins just after a planet is formed and
begins  cooling.  It ends with the development of multi-celled life.
This  covers  the time period on the real Earth from 4.5 billion
to 570 million years ago.  


In  this  Time  Scale,  the  planet  changes  very  slowly,  so  the
simulation   time   is   sped   up   to  keep  things  moving.   The
Time/Simulation cycle for this Time Scale is 10 million years.  This
means  that each time the program runs through one simulation cycle,
10 million years passes on the planet.

Your  available  energy  builds  up  at  1 E.U.  per Time/Simulation
cycle.

The  factors  simulated  in  this  Time  Scale,  in  order  of their
influence,   are:    continental   drift,  atmospheric  composition,
extraterrestrial collisions, single- celled life, and climate.

The  goal  of  this  Time  Scale  is to manipulate all the simulated
factors  to facilitate the formation of multicellular life, at which
time  you  will  be  advanced  to  the  next  and slower Time Scale,
Evolution.

Time moves very fast in this Time Scale, and your planet only has 10
billion  years to live.  If you want to complete all the Time Scales
before the end of your planet, you should try to reach the next Time
Scale  when your planet is between three and four billion years old.
Don't advance too soon, or there will not be enough fossil fuels for
later civilisations.

THINGS TO DO:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Design continents. 
Spell your name in land masses. 
Burn off oceans. 
Make life impossible in a number of ways. 
Use earthquakes to create mountain ranges. 
Use meteors to create lakes. 
Use meteors and hurricanes to increase rainfall. 
Use earthquakes, volcanos and meteors to achieve the highest dust 
 level you can. 
Using only events (not the ALTITUDE tool), try to recreate the 
 continents on Earth today. (Hint: you'll want to pause the simulation 
 or at least turn the core heat ail the way down to stop or slow 
 continental DRIFT.) 
Play Bumper-continents. Get two or three friends, each build a small 
 continent, and take turns setting off earthquakes to propel the 
 continents into each other.

EVOLUTION TIME SCALE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The evolution time scale comes after the Geologic time scale. It begins 
with the appearance of multi-cellular organisms and ends with the 
development of intelligence.

Things change a little faster in this timescale than in the Geologic, 
so the time scale/Simulation time has been lowered to 500,000 years.

Your available energy builds up at 1.EU per time/simulation cycle.

This timescale relates to the period of time on the real earth from 
570 to .01 million years ago.

The factors simulated in this timescale are; life, biomes, climate,
atmpospheric composition and continental drift.

The goal of this timescale is to manipulate the simulation factors
and evolve intelligence, at which you will be advanced to the 
Civilisation timescale.

Your planet has only 10 billion years to live. If you want to complete
all the time scales before the end of your planet, you should try to 
reach the next timescale when your planet is between 5 and 6 billion
years old. Dont advance too soon, or there will not be enough fossil
fuels for future civilisations.

CIVILISATION TIME SCALE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  Civilization Time Scale comes after the Evolution time scale It
begins  with appearance of intelligent organisms and
ends with the Industrial Revolution.  

Things  change fast in this Time Scale, so the Time/Simulation cycle
has been lowered to 10 years.

Your available energy builds up at different rates, depending 
on your highest available technology level: 

2 E.U. per Time/Simulation cycle in the Stone Age, 
3 E.U. per Time/Simulation cycle in the Bronze Age, and 
4 E.U. per Time/Simulation cycle in the Iron Age.

This Time Scale relates to the period of time on the real Earth from
10,000 to 100 years ago.

The  factors  simulated  in  this  Time  Scale,  in  order  of their
influence,   are:    Civilisation,   life,   biomes,   climate,  and
atmospheric composition.

The  goal of this Time Scale is to manipulate the simulation factors
and  evolve  higher  levels of technology, at which time you will be
advanced to the Technology Time Scale.

Your  planet  only  has  10  billion  years to live.  If you want to
complete  all  the  Time  Scales  before the end of your planet, you
should  try  to  reach the next Time Scale before your planet is 9.5
billion years old.

TECHNOLGOY TIME SCALE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  Technology  Time Scale comes after the Civilisation Time Scale.
It begins with the appearance of high levels of technology, and ends
when  technology evolves to the level when your planet can reproduce
itself   through  interstellar  "genetic"  seeding--the  ability  to
Colonise other planets.

When   you  complete  this  Time  Scale,  and  achieve  interstellar
migration,  all  Civilisation leaves the planet.  The planet is then
turned  into  a  wildlife reserve, and returns to the Evolution Time
Scale.

Things  change  very fast in this Time Scale, so the Time/Simulation
cycle has been lowered to one year.

Your  available  energy  builds  up at different rates, depending on
your    highest   available   technology   level:    

5 E.U. per Time/Simulation cycle in the Industrial Age,  
6 E.U. per Time/Simulation cycle in the Atomic Age, 
7 E.U. per Time/Simulation cycle in the Information Age, and 
8 E.U. per Time/Simulation cycle in the Nanotech Age.

This Time Scale relates to the period of time on the real Earth from
100 years ago to the future.

The factors simulated in this Time Scale, in order of their influence, are: 
Civilisation, life, biomes, sentient expansion, climate, and atmospheric 
composition. 

				> 107 <

The  goal of this Time Scale is to manipulate the simulation factors
and  evolve  a  level  of  technology  high enough to Colonise other
planets.

Your  planet  only  has 10 billion years to live.  You should try to
complete this Time Scale before the end of your planet.

			      SCENARIOS 
		 	      ==========

There  are  six  scenario  planets  included with SimEarth, plus the
Daisyworld  Scenario.  They can all be played in easy, medium, hard,
and experimental modes.

Each  scenario  has  a  task for you to accomplish, but feel free to
just play with these worlds.

Scenarios are chosen and started in the NEW PLANET WINDOW.

				 > 109 <

AQUARIUM
~~~~~~~~~
Aquarium   is  a  world  that  will  never  develop  sentient  life.
Sentience  can only be reached in SimEarth by land animals.  We hope
we're  not offending any intelligent, purely aquatic aliens anywhere
in  the  universe,  but as far as we can tell, Civilisation requires
the use of fire and the burning of fossil fuels to develop.

Intelligence  in SimEarth requires land because of the need of fire,
tools, and forges.  Water creatures can reach intelligence, but need
access to land for toolmaking.

The problem: No continents

Time Scale: Evolution

Your mission: Create continents on this planet so Civilisation can evolve. 

The  methods:  The easy way is to use the SET ALTITUDE tool.  A more
creative  approach  is  to use events.  The most subtle method is by
manipulating the MODEL CONTROL PANELS.

Hints: Make sure you keep plenty of shelves (shallow water) in your oceans. 
Most marine life lives near the surface. 

Notes: Aquarium is a good starting place for people who like to 
design their own continents. 

				> 110 <


STAG NATION
~~~~~~~~~~~
The civilisation on this world is stuck in the Stone Age. The 
sentiet mammals are all stuck on a small island. They have no 
room to expand, and are unable to develop or expand energy for
a technological jump.

The problem: Population stuck in the stone age.

Time Scale : Civilisation

Your Mission: Aid the population in a migration to larger land masses
 and increase their level of science.

The Methods: The advancement in science will require manipulation of
the CIVILISATION MODEL CONTROL PANEL. The migration canbe performed
oin a number of ways, pick them up and move thenm to a larger sandmass
with the MOVING tool; build a land bridge for them to cross with 
SET ALTITUDE tool; or use events.

Hints: If you use events to make a land bridge, be careful not to wipe
out your sentient population by accident.

Notes: If you dont like intelligent mammals, you can destroy the island
where they live and try to nurture another class of life to sentience.

EARTH: THE CAMBRIAN ERA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This  scenario  takes  place  on  Earth 550 million years ago at the
beginning  of  the  Cambrian  era.   Life  on Earth at that time was
undergoing  an  explosion of diversification.  Plants started moving
onto the land, followed by insects and other animals.

In  this scenario, the drift of the continents will follow the drift
of  Earth's  continents.   It  starts with the supercontinent called
Pangaea,  which  then  splits  apart  into the ancient continents of
Condwanaland and Laurasia.

Eventually,  you will recognise the continents as we see them today.
The  pre-programmed  drift will continue into the future following
scientific predictions for about 200 million years.  After that, the
simulation takes over and controls the drift.


The problem: Living in the past

Time Scale: Evolution

Your  mission:  Help evolution develop intelligent life while seeing
an instant replay of our planet's continental drift.

The methods:   On  this one, you can just sit back and watch, or get
involved  in  every  planetary  process.   The continents will drift
whether or not any life is around to see where they go.

Hints:   Beyond  200  million  years  in  the future, the drift will
diverge  from scientific predictions, and will be at the whim of our
simulation code.

				> 112 <


To  see  a  real  instant replay of the continental drift, click and
hold on the INFO BOX and slowly drag the mouse back and forth.

Any  changes  you  make  to  the  continents  by  using  events will
disappear.   The  continental  drift  will follow its pre-programmed
path no matter what you do.

Notes:   Try  to  develop intelligence/Civilisation in your sentient
species just as the continents reach the stage of modern Earth.  See
if you can create an earth with intelligent dinosaurs.
