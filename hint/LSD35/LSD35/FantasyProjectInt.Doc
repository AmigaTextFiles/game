1. Mainmenue
------------

1.1 (S)tart your Adventure
By pressing "S" you can start a new game. It is necessary that you already
have created or loaded your characters and that the actual loaded game is
a new game and not marked for continue.

1.2 shift + (Q)uit Interpreter
Leave the Interpreter - Back to DOS.

1.3 (R)read Characters
Reads the file "game:objects/demoparty" as party - this option is only a
test-option which will disapear in final versions.

1.4 (W)rite Characters
Writes the actual characters into "game:objects/demoparty" - for testing only

1.5 (C)reate Character
Will create a character by your will. You will have to enter:
-Name : May be up to 22 characters long
-Sex  : Male or Female - has NO effect on the game, will only affect the
        pictures shown for the character and the him/her in fight.
-Class: There are the following classes:
        -Fighter&Thief: In this version totally equal in quality and use
                        of objects
        -Magician     : Spell-Caster Type I - Can cast spells defined for
                        his class
        -Cleric       : Spell-Caster Type II- Can also cast spells defined
                        for his class
Then a dice will roll out the other facilities - If you have a fast eye then
press any key when you think the qualities are best.

The facilities are:
Intelligence    =       IQ
Dexterity       =       DX
Wisdom          =       WD
Condition       =       CN
Strength        =       ST
Luck            =       LK
Defense normally is 1 - if the character is in Defense (Fight) then it is 2
SwordStrength is the strength of the spell with the sword-icon (add AS)
ShieldStrenght is the strength of the spell with the shield-icon (add AC)
SlowValue is defined in labdata and will cause later advancement if higher

They take influence on the following things:
Maximal Weight to carry : 15000 + (DX+CN+ST)*128    in gramm
AttackStrength (AS)     : ST/2 + IQ/4 + DX/4 + LK/4 + SwordStrength
ArmourClass (AC)        : CN/4 + DX/4 + LK/4 + ShieldStrength
AttackPriority (AP)     : DX/8 + IQ/2 + LK/2 + ST/8 + WD/2 + CN/8
                          if the spell INCAP is casted on this char, add 30
Advancement             : (DX + IQ/2 + LK + ST + CN + WD/2 + SlowValue)^2
                          if this value added to the last advencement's
                          experience points is higher than the actual then
                          the char will advance one level
Ranges                  : in any case where are ranges, such as spell does
                          100-200 points of damage a higher wisdom will
                          cause that the value lies more to the higher
                          border.

1.6 (G)o on in current game
If you have loaded an old game or pressed ESC in Play-Mode you will continue
the game, where you have stopped

3. Gameplay

Depend very much on the created adventure

3.1 Advancement:
If characters have enough experience points (owned by fighting) thay may
advance on level.
This advancedment will add some facities ad once but will not help
learning spells or train multiple attack or deathstrikes.
Training will be done in Training Camps or Guild of Magic (the name of
these may differ in order to the definition of the game) were you have
to pay money to learn new spells/better methods of fighting.
But also this advancement requires that you have already the needed level!

3.2 Healing/Illnesses:
The Temple of Healing (or named in another way) can cure any damage you will
get in fight for money.
There are the following possibilities:
Hitpoints are not at maximum - effect: if zero you are dead
DEAD : Cannot innitiate actions that are necessary for game play
STON : Stoned - the same as DEAD but a stoned character can be beaten
       (Hitpoints). If this character is dead you will have to heal death
       and turn stone to flesh !
PSND : Poisoned - will substract one hitpoint in the same speed as other
       characters recover hit-/spellpoints.
CONF : Confused - Cannot Fight or cast spells
NUTS : IQ,LK,WD goes down to 1
WEAK : ST,KN,DX goes down to 1
SLEP : Character is asleep, will awake if beaten or fight is over

3.3 Recovers:
Spellpoints will only recover under the light of day (towns/wilderess 7.a.m.
to 7 p.m.) by one
Hitpoints will recover any time by one-
Speed: ca. 1 point per minute or in combat one point per round !
