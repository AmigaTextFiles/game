GENERAL TIPS
At all costs, kill the gold ninjas, as the various orbs they carry are Švital if you complete the game. Blue orbs will give you an invincible Šspirit (maximum of two); while green orbs will power up the weapon you Šare using. However, if this has been powered up then it will power up Šthe next weapon, and so on. If all your weapons are powered up then Šyou won't gain anything by collecting the orb. Gold orbs will give you Šan extra life. Red orbs will give your indestructable spirit a  fire Šrope. When a power up is collected, you and your spirits' weapons are Špowered up as follows.
        
SWORD - Each time you use your sword, it will leave a trail of laser Šrings.

GRAPPLING HOOK - Allows you to swing it around 360 degrees. Use the Šweapon advisor if none of your weapons have been powered up.

NINJA STARS - Triple amount of stars you can fire

DYNAMITE - Ability to fire more rapidly.

LEVEL ONE
Power up your sword to initialise the laser rings. When walking across Šthe water use the rings to protect you from the knives that the Ninjas Šthrow down. Don't jump over any red soucerers, as they will attack you Šimmediatly. At the end of the level you will be safe standing inside Šeither of the pillars. While here hit the pillars with your sword or Šgrappling hook. As soon as they explode, the Budda will start to rise Šfrom the ground. as it rises, hits to it are not counted, so don't Šbother. Instead move to the centre of the screen and select, a new Šweapon. If you have spirits and a powered up sword, use this, Šotherwise use the dynamite. Only a few good hits are needed to kill Šit.

LEVEL TWO
As usual collect as many bonus orbs as possible. the red ninjas throw Šonly once, so don't worry about killing them after the've fired. The Šwolves and fireballs will kill you on contact, so keep away from them. ŠOn reaching the end of level, the treecrawler will appear in the Šcentre of the screen. as soon as it moves, climb up to the top right Šmost branch just off the screen. Every time the treecrawler jumps Špast, fire some dynamite. Taky your time as you are safe standing Šhere.

LEVEL THREE
Stay clear of the beige Sourcerers while they are carrying their Šstaff, as they could throw it at any time. When they throw it in the Šari, move in for the kill. Musketeers are harmless, until they stop, Štake aim, and fire, so try to kill them when they are running to Šanother firing position. There is a fire rope to be had on this level, Šit is especially useful when fighting the green innja at the end of Šthe level. When fighting the green ninja, drae him towards you by Šwaiting at either side of the screen. Just as he is about to cut you, Šjump over him and take as many shots at him as you can. Repeat this Šuntil he is defeated.

LEVEL FOUR

SECTION ONE
The pink ninjas on this section only use their grappling hooks against Šyou, when you are in range. As they appear on the screen, alternate Šbetween running along the ground and celing. as you do this the Šswordsman will follow. Try to avoid them and last out to the end of Šthe section.

SECTION TWO
Stay on the celing when possible and keep well away from the bamboo Šspikes. Keep an eye on the beige ninjas as they try to stab you Šthrough the celing.

SECTION THREE
Run and jump your way to the end, only stopping if your life is Šthreatened. Don't waste any time as the falling wall will flatten you Šfor sure. When the moving stones slide down at the end of the level, Šstay on the ground to draw them towards you. They're not pattened so Šthey will work together in an attempt to squash you. Go all out with Šthe laser rings or dynamite to blow up the lanterns attached to the Šstones in the first few seconds, or the stones will squash you for Šsure.

LEVEL FIVE
Weapons are not needed when climbing the mountain. However, it will Štake some practice and planning to find out where the poisonous gas Šleaks from the cracks in the mountain. When flying a kite at the tip Šof the mountain, aim for the ninja in the middle as he is the one Šflying it. The other ninjas will reappear when killed until the one in Šthe middle is killed.

LEVEL SIX
No tips here, all you need is speed.

LEVEL SEVEN
Don't try to kill the wizard as he requires 300+ hits. Practice as Šrequired to find out where the poisonous gas leaks out. When you Šdescend to fight the warlock, keep to the right. You will have to move Šleft at least once. When you do move right again, dodge the undead Šninjas. The warlock fires fireworks from his crystal ball every few Šseconds. Draw them towards you, as they fizzle out pretty quickly. ŠWhen this happens, fire dynamite at the crystal ball. Only a few hits Šare needed to defeat him. When you've killed him you can now watch the Šnice end sequence.
