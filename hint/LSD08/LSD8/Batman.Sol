From your start position in the park, go left, down, right, pick up the
metal bar. keep going right and get the light bulb. From there, Left, Up,
Left, Up, And take the Batarang. Go down, left, down, left. Use the light
bulb in the dark room and go to the door. Use the bar to break the door
open, then drop the bar. Go left and get the torch, then go down the ladder.
The next room is also dark so switch on your torch and watch out for rats.
Now, head down, then left and up and pick up the carrot. Go down, right and
up and collect the gas mask which you should use as soon as you enter the
room to the right. Go down, left, down and down again. Go right until you
reach another ladder going up. Go up it until you come across some teeth,
which you should pick up and use. Go down, right, up, up, left, down, left
up the ladder, down, left and pick up the fish. Go right, down and right
again to find a bag of money, then go up, right, down, right, up, up the
ladder. Get the ears, use them and then drop them. Go down the ladder, down
right, up, right, up left, down, collect the pliers and you can now defuse
bombs just by standing next to them and using the pliers. To find the bombs
you have to go all the way back, so go up, right, up, left down the ladder,
defuse the bomb. Head right, then down, then left, down, left as far as you
can go and defuse the next bomb. Then go up, left, down, left, up, up again,
defuse the bomb, go left, and defuse the next bomb. Now, go left, then down
and get the handcuffs. Go up, right, down the ladder, right, down, down,
left, up, down, down, the ladder, left, and defuse the bomb. Walk left,
climb up the ladder, go up and defuse the bomb. Then it's right, up, left,
down, left and defuse the bomb. Go up and defuse the bomb, then go down,
right, up, right, down, left, down, down the ladder, right, up the ladder,
right, up, up again, left, down the ladder, left, up the ladder, down, down,
right, up, right, down, right as far as you can go, then up, right, up,
left, up the ladder, right, down, left, down, right, up, left, up, up again
and take the camera (Phew! Are you following all this ?) Anyway, use the
camera and then drop it. Now go left, down, down, then keep going right
until the words "The Fun Fair" appears in the top left of the screen. Now go
right, up, up and left, then stand by the fruit machine and use the money.
You should now find some ammunition on the floor, so pick it up and go
right, down, down then continue right until you can go up. Take the gun, go
down, right then up, take the coconut, then go down and continue right until
you reach the shooting gallery. Use the ammunition then the gun, and keep
pressing the fire button until the sunglasses appear. Grab them and walk
left then up into the door with the teeth. Use the sunglasses and get the
turkey, then go left up the ladder and right and you should see the joker.
Hit him repeatedly until he runs off then go up twice and hit him again. Go
left and left again and hit the joker as before. Now go right, down, left,
down, left and take the elephant. Go down the ladder, right, up get the
milk, down, left, down, left, up, left, down, take the object and drop it,
go up, right, up, up the ladder, up, collect the knife, go down, left, down
& left again until you see the joker. If you hit as before he will fall
over, giving you the opportunity to slap the cuffs on him. Once bound, he
should drop a large card which you should pick up and take right, up and
left, to a room with a similar card in it. Use your card and you should then
be able to walk through the large card as if it were a door. Go left,
collect the can, go down. Go down and you should find yourself at the roller
coaster. Go right, climb the ladder and go right until you come to another
ladder, which you should also climb. Go left (Remembering to duck when the
eagles fly past), keep going and you should eventually find Robin!
