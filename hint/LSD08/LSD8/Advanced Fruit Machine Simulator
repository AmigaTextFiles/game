             ADVANCED FRUIT MACHINE SIMULATOR - CODEMASTERS

Typed in by PARASITE of LSD. NOTE: Codemasters, in my opinion are the
best value games producers on the AMIGA and ATARI ST. I hope the game
buyers will carry on supporting this company. If you play pirated
versions of their games, why not buy it, they're only five to seven
quid, damn good value!!!

EXTRA INFO

COINS:
You can see how many of each coin you have at the top of the reels
screen. And you can see your total money - but tokens don't count -
just like real life!

THE GREATEST GAMBLERS:
(In a multi-player game, only the winner can register his name as one
of the greatest gamblers.) To register, when asked to insert coins,
don't insert any, just end (by pressing START or TAKE or clicking on
END). Then walk away with the money you've got.

MULTI-PLAYER GAME:
The players take it in turns. Each turn you can put in between 4 and
20 credits. You are out of the game when you go broke. The winner is
the last one left.

TO END YOUR TURN:
When asked to insert coins, don't insert any, just end by pressing
START or TAKE or clicking on END.
