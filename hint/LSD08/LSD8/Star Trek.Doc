                 STAR TREK - ENGLISH DOCUMENTATION

Translated by MARK ROBINSON. Edited by PARASITE.


At last, for all of you struggling away at Tobias' fab Star Trek
game can now breath a hefty sigh of relief as the English
Instructions come winging their way to you thanks to 17 Bit
Member and Deutsche Sprechen Mark Robinson. Although Mark admits
the translation may not be 100% accurate due to some German idioms
used in the original German text by Tobias, this translation will
certainly give all the relevant information on playing the game....


STAR TREK - AN OVERVIEW

SPACE THE FINAL FRONTIER
When the first episode of Star Trek was shown on American television
on 9.8.1966, a series began that led to a sort of mania. Although the
beginnings were fairly modest (despite being one of the most expensive
series at the time) nobody was quite expecting the following that it
got. The planned suspension of the series after 2 years was largely
prevented by the flood of fan mail that objected to this, but Star
Trek still disappeared to an evening slot and, after one more year,
the final episode was screened. Even this can be seen as a sort of
new beginning as a private station bought the series and proceeded to
show it everywhere. Nowadays there are very few countries in which
Star Trek has not been shown. In Germany the series is known as
"Raumschiff Enterprise" after the starship whose name became
synonymous with the program.

Soon plans were revealed to begin on a new series -Star Trek II- but
after years of to'ing and fro'ing Paramount eventually decided to
shoot a full length feature film for the cinema. With over $40
million spent on it in 1979, it was then one of the most expensive
films ever made. This has been followed by a further four full length
films, the most recent -Star Trek V- having been released in Autumn
1989. In all the films, Paramount managed to reunite the original
cast of the TV series so that we were still met by Captain Kirk
(William Shatner), the Vulcan Mr Spock (Leonard Nimoy), Dr "Bones"
McCoy (De Forest Kelley), Helmsman Mr Sulu (George Takei), the
Navigator Mr Chekov (Walter Koenig), Chief Engineer Mr Scott (James
Doohan) and Communications Officer Lt Uhura (Nichelle Nicholas).

A couple of years ago a new series started in the USA - STAR TREK -
The Next Generation - which is true in style to the old one, but with new
actors and a new Enterprise. This will probably be coming to Germany
in Autumn 1990. The original creator of the series, Gene Roddenberry,
who has been actively involved from the outset acts as an adviser for
the films and is also working on The Next Generation. All of this
activity is due not least to the efforts of the enormous Star Trek fan
club, the "Trekkies", who, in contrast to many other fan clubs, are
very active, and actually contribute something to their hobby by
distributing fanzines, stories, reports, plans etc. In addition, this
game is the product of one such "Trekkies" work and I hope that a few
more Star Trek fans might result from playing it.

Star Treks influence, however reaches into other spheres of
interest. Who is to say, for example, whether the first Space Shuttle
got it's name "Enterprise" partly because of the large number of
letters from countless fans received by the then President of the USA?

STAR TREK - THE GAME
In all it has taken me 2 years to finish writing the game. During
that time there were obviously occasions when I went through phases of
simply wanting to give up, as I could just not see the light at the
end of the tunnel. Now it's finished and everything that happened has
been forgotten. The finished code is about 160KB in length and the
source takes up about 1/2 Mb. For the special 512K version I have
simply cut out the sounds that were not essential and changed nothing
of the actual game. Part of the atmosphere of the game is naturally
lost as a result, but the lack of memory made this unavoidable. Those
who have more than 1MB of memory can also copy the contents of the data
disk to RAM, which will speed the game up somewhat.

The game is written in Aztec C V3.6 with some assembler, for which
many thanks go to Thomas Kruza as the game would not have been possible
in its present form without it. Thanks also to Sylvia, Tanja and
Guido who gave me several good ideas that enrich the game
considerably. Star Trek can be controlled solely with the mouse, but
a joystick in port 2 will help with the Starships movements.

GOAL OF THE GAME
There is one fixed goal:- namely to remain as Captain of the
Enterprise. To achieve this missions must be carried out, the crew
looked after, and everything must be handled with a certain anmount of
common sense. An overzealous Captain will fare no better than an
overcautious one.

THE MENU SELECTIONS

MAIN SCREEN 1 - THE BRIDGE (IN PLANFORM OR FROM THE CAPTAINS SEAT)
In the centre there are 4 bars. The top one shows the impulse
speed, the second the warp factor, the third the energy level, and
the bottom one shows damage to the ship's hull. To the right of these
is another indicator denoting the current Alert state, and beneath all
of these is the Star Date.

ENGINEERING
The sliding scale on the left can be set to determine the extent of
repair work that will be carried out on a given system. To enable
repairs to be carried out, there must be sufficient energy to spare,
and, where major repairs are undertaken, it is possible that crew
members will be injured. The speed can also be set on the left side.
WARNING! Impulse speed can only be activated when the warp factor is
a maximum of Warp 1. In the centre there are indicators giving the
shield configuration and the extent of damage to the ship.

COMMUNICATIONS
Messages will be poassed here and notified by the sound of the
familiar "piping" sound. WARNING! The messages are not stored so it
is advisable to look at the important things quickly. In the middle, the
Alert State <Condition> of the ship can be altered; when red alert is
sounded, the Tactical Display is activated. At the top, the panel
<Own Messages> gives you a number of standard messages at your
disposal which can be sent using <Send It>.

WEAPONS AND DEFENCE
From this position you set the sights for the phasers and Photon
Torpedoes. In the middle is the <Fire> Button. The centre section of
this screen enables you to set up the shields and either <Activate> or
<Deactivate> them. Only activated shields use up energy and for each
side of the StarShip there is one shield. Activated shields prevent
the ship from sustaining damage and just cost you energy.

QUIT/SAVE
The game can be ended, saved or restarted from here. The programme
Always looks for a disk named "STGAME" so it is important not to
change the title. In addition there must also be a file with the name
"STARTREK" (normally the game itself) on it, otherwise the Save option
will not function. You can only ever load or save one game which will
be saved on the "STGAME" diskette under the name "STGAME1". By
copying or renaming files, it is possible to read other files as long
as they only bear the name "STGAME1".

HELMSMAN
As with Weapons/Defence, it is possible to set up and fire the
wapons system from here. Using <Tactical> a small tactical screen
will appear on which it is possible to see other ships and their
identity. Other than that, Energy is shown at the bottom left, the
shields at the bottom, and at the bottom right is a red square
denoting shield activity. The yellow rectangle gives the current
direction of Photon torpedo aim, and the small square, that of the
phasers. On the right of the Helmsmans window are the speed
indicators for the impulse engines and in the middle are the main
controls that can be used for orbital acquisition or docking.

TURBOLIFT
From here you travel to the different areas of the ship - see main
screen 2.

BRIDGE
Change to plan view, from where the controls are the same as from
the Captains seat.

NAVIGATOR
On the right once more are the speed indicators for Warp and Impulse
engines. At the top <Change Target> you can set the places to which
you wish to travel. The destination is input by moving the cursor
with the mouse and pressing the left mouse button, whether the
destination is a planet, a point in space, or a space station. A
course correction will then be made automatically. The current
position of the Enterprise is shown by a red cross, whilst points in
space relevant to the missions being carried out are shown in colour.
Destination planets are yellow, planets from which things must be
collected are green, other starships are blue and enemy units are red.
WARNING! Flight at warp speed is only worthwhile attempting when on a
mission.

PAUSE
The game pauses until you click on <Pause> once more.

DAMAGE AND REPAIR
On the left side the extent of repair required can be set, 100%
meaning that the nominated area will be completely serviceable
afterwards. Repairs cost you energy and, eventually, the health of
your crew members. The level of damage sustained can be read from the
right hand side, as can the shield status. You can acquire energy
from docking with space stations, entering an orbit, or from other
ships, and your own generators produce energy too, though flying at
high warp factors causes it to be used up faster than it can be
replenished.

SCIENCE AND COMPUTER
It is here that Mr Spock has his say. Details are available for all
the different planets, spaceships, attackers and various other
unusual things that come up in the game. In the centre <Suggest> can
sometimes give you an idea as your best course of action.

STATUS
The most important bits of ship data are shown here once more -
speed, course, shields and damage.

MAIN SCREEN 2 - SHIP'S PLANS
The row of gadgets on the left give information about individual
decks.

BRIDGE
Back to main screen 1.

OFFICERS LOUNGE
You can scroll through your current missions here by clicking on
<Missions> and the morale of the crew can be found from <Crew
Attitude>. You must pay attention to this as crews have been known to
fire their Captains!

TRANSPORTER
Clicking here takes you to the transporter room. From there people
and objects can be readily transported. The transporter requires
energy to do this and, if there is insufficient, then a shuttle must
be used instead. It is possible to beam things both to and from the
Enterprise. The objects to be transported are shown in their
]respective windows and can be selected by clicking on the arrows.
'Status' shows wether or not the transporter is operative and 'Ready'
appears when an object is ready to be beamed up or down. If you
encounter another starship, it may be possible to use his transporter
even if yours is not working - 'Ready' will also show as green then.
The brighter the green appears, the higher the energy level at that
time.

MEDICAL
By visiting "Bones" you can view the crew's and your own health on
the right hand side. If the crew is very much under the weather, it
can make leadership very difficult. Dr Mccoy gives his advice on the
left from time to time.

ENGINEERING
See under main screen 1.

CARGO BAY
To find out what Enterprise is carrying at a given time, visit this
room and use the arrows to scroll through the bay's contents.

LANDING BAY
Things can be taken to and from a planets surface using a shuttle
chosen from here. The gadgets are on the shuttle for directional control
are for the thrusters (i.e. the left one turns the craft to the right,
the right one turns it left, the bottom one is a vertical thruster,
and the top one provides forward propulsion) and the aim is to fly off
the deck of the enterprise and to make a gentle landing at your
destination or back on deck. If you crash then the shuttle has to be
repaired. This means that another shuttle may have to be chosen from
the hangar.

CREDITS
Here you can set the frequency of the missions and events. <Sound
On/Off> toggles the background noise and clicking twice on <Reset>
will start the game from scratch again. Other than that, the note
above the gadgets is meant to be taken seriously - it would be great
if you coould see your way to sending me a small token of your
appreciation (it doesn't have to be money!!). You can be sure of a
reply. Thanks.

HANGAR
There are four shuttles for your use that are either being repaired
(shown in red) or ready for use (green). On each you can set the
sensitivity of the craft to acceleration and gravatational forces.
The further to the right the slider is set, the more sensitive the
controls are.

TIPS FOR INDIVIDUAL PHASES OF THE GAME
To achieve orbit, you must attempt to keep the edge of the planet as
close to the middle of the screen as possible. To orientate yourself,
three crosshairs and a circle around the planet will appear as you get
closer. The best position to aim for is between the circle and the
planet's edge.

To fly into the dock, it will suffice just to position the entrance
doors so that the dock appears not to move. Too much movement will
prevent a successful approach.

If the transporter is broken and all the shuttles are being
repaired, there is nothing to do but wait, or fly to the nearest dock
so that the transporter can be repaired more quickly.

In dock, all repairs are carried out as fast as possible and the
energy is brought back up to full, but it still takes quite some time
to repair serious damage.

When attacked by an enemy, you should always try to react quickly as
this conserves energy, reduces damage, and improves crew morale.

As you gain more experience, you are given more and more difficult
missions by Starfleet, so don't be too surprised.
