                 SHADOW OF THE BEAST 2 SOLUTION

Typed in by PARASITE of LSD.


To solve this game you might need infinate lives, to get them, go to
the woods, and press A to ask a question, then type TEN PINTS, you now
have infinate lives.

From the start head left, watching out for the hands throwing the
crystal balls from the trees.  Cross the bridge carefully, judging the
time to avoid the leaping fish, and shoot the demon to save the man
trapped in the field.  Ask him about TRAPS, and he will be able to
tell you about either a higher or loewer switch.

Go left and down (watch for the bats).  Land on the left edge, and
duck to avoid the flying Demon.  Chase him to the right and kill him
before he can cut the rope.  Let the man pushing the block get close
to the edge, then kill him.  Go left avoiding the falling blocks and
kill the demon on the hill to the left. Go back to the right and the
demon will have dropped a key.  Head back to the left and drop off the
edge, but watch out for the flying demon.

Go up the rope, head right and use the key to open the door.  Now go
right watching for another falling block.  When you eventually come to
the switches, hit whichever one the man you freed told you about.

Go up the lift, go right avoiding the bats, past the chain leading
down, through two open doors to the next chain.  Go up the chain into
the alcove and collect the bonuses.  Go back down the chain and
continue right to collect the key.  Go left and down the chain, taking
care not to wake the sleeping guard.  Use the key to let the beast
free from the cage, and hit the lower switch on the right.  Now head
back to the lift and board it to head down.

The switch that you hit should have caused a bridge to appear.  Go
left across it and use the three levers on the right to operate the
claw.  Pick up the rock with the claw and drop it on the spike in the
floor on the right.  Now push the remaining smaller rock onto the see-
saw over the right and climb the rope, jumping off to land on the
other side of the see-saw.  Run to the other lift and you will go up.

Go right to kill Ishran, then free the prisoner, who will tell you the
password.  Go to the gateway to Barlooms domain and wisper the
password.  Go right to collect a bonus then up the rope to collect a
parchment from Barloom.  Leave and head left past the rope.  Look out
for the giants with maces and collect the bonus.

Enter the hut and go right to collect the ale, then leave the hut and
return to the games starting point.  Head right, watching for the
Pigmies (This is where the cheat mode is operated!) and head
diagonally up to the left of the stepping-stones.  Watch out for the
jelly-firing monsters on the bridge and collect the bonus.  Kill the
monster to get the axe and head diagonally up to the right for another
bonus.  Go back down the way you came and head left until you find a
covered hole.  Jump over it (taking care not to land on the platform
above), and you should drop through.

Go left, dodging the crystals that pop up from the water and collect
all the bonuses on the way.  Chase the Goblin to the left until you
reach the drawbridge.  Switch to axe and jump to shoot at the bloke
winding up the bridge, but remember the time limit on the axes and
keep piling them at the bloke.  Switch back to the mace to kill the
other Goblin and smash through the door.

Go left and up, then hit the switch to turn off the spikes.  Go left
and crouch to hit the switch on the right.  Go right, down, left and
down, then kill the Goblins.  Go right, collect the key then go left
and under the cage.  You have been captured, never mind.

To escape from prison, offer the ale to the Goblin, and use the mace
to break the cage door.  Go up to the top and go left.  Kill the
Goblins and collect the ring, then go down and kill the sleeping guard
to collect the key.  Go back and release the remaining prisoner in the
cell above yours.  Go back down to collect your mace again, then go up
and to the right.  Use the remaining key to open the door, then go
right looking for the spikes.  Leave the caves and return to the
surface.

Go right, down, then right and kill the giant head.  Go right, up the
rope and right, looking out for the bats.  Go down the rope then right
across the bridge.  Get the ginat lizard-man to follow you left back
across the bridge so that he falls through.  Go right (jumping over
the hole the lizard-man has made) and carry on heading right until you
mee the old man.  offer him the ring and the parchment and collect the
weapon he makes - this is the one to use fron now on!

Go left and drop through the hole in the bridge.  Head right watching
out for bats, then go down and collect the bonus.  Go right onto the
rope, then right again onto the ledge to collect the horn.  Go back
left and down the rope, then quickly jump out of the acid and head
right.  When you reach the snail, ask him about the KARAMOON and
answer yes to both his questions.

Head off back to the surface and once there go right, looking out for
the twin ginats hurling axes.  Go right, over the cliff edge, then
right, killing the giant toads.  But look out for the ginat sepant in
its nest.  Now walk to the sea edge, and use the horn to call the sea-
beast.  Climb onto its back, then right and enter the tower.  Go
right, down the stairs, then up the adjascent stairs to collect the
bonus.  Go down, then right and its time for the big battle!

If you defeat Zelek, the Beast Mage, then you've completed the
adventure.

End.
