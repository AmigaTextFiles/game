                        ANT HEADS SOLUTION

Typed in by PARASITE of LSD.


DAY 1
Start by gathering all the information you can from Biff & Dusty,
unless you already know what's going on.
Go to the gas station and get acquanted with Elmer.
Then take a trip to KBUG. Dusty then tells you about the aftermath of
the last ant attack and gives you a gun and a Geiger counter.
Hang around until the afternoon and visit the platt university lab. In
there you'll find little Billy and his scheptical dad. Ignore the old
man and listen to all Billy's advice. For some further info pop in on
Ida the fortune teller.
Get home for around eight and you'll be able to spend a not so quiet
evening with the ever amorous Jackie.

DAY 2
Once again your first excursion should be to KBUG, where Dusty warns
you of the impending threat from the G-men.
After that go to the lab where Billy has some more useful information
for you.
You will have a run in with Jackie at some stage, which will lead
to a fight with her boyfriend.
At about one o'clock drive over to Neptune Hall where you'll find
Billy Bob acting even stranger than usual, if you count strange as a
full set of antennae and mandibles. You've just met your first Ant
head. Whip out your Colt .45 and shoot him where the antennae joins
the head. After the transformation from Ant-head to Billy Bob you get
one of the most vital pieces of information in the game, a number.
Make a note of this, and thats day two.

DAY 3
Sat your alarm clock for nine o'clock. You should wake up with Jackie
at the door, who then wakes you up even further by becomming an Ant-
head. Shoot her head as before, and write down the number she gives
you.
Plod over to the ore plant and butter up the manager by selecting
'Crude Remark'A. Hop onto the train to M3 and dispose of the Ants you
find there.
Once you've massacared a few dozen Ants shimmy back to platt
laboratory for a meet with Billy. He will give you some Pez (a sugary
sweet, which enables to tell if people are Ant-heads)
Try to arrive at the Police station at around five o'clock, get
knocked unconscious and put in hospital. When you regain
consciousness, the nurse will give you the location of the vault where
the Ant-heads store the records of the conversion process. Then all
you have to do is escape.

DAY 4
Drop in at Elmore's. When he turns into an Ant-head, shoot his head as
before and get the final number.
Once you have all three numbers go to the Hospital, grab a wheelchair,
and take a lift to the basement. Towards the top-right of the floor is
the morgue, recognise the four black slabs and the grey safe inside.
Go up to the safe and enter the numbers in the order you found them.
If you have done this correctly, you will automatically collect the
documents. If you manage to escape from the Hospital, lizard Breath
finally wakes up to the threat of the ants, and quite courteously puts
you in charge of wiping them out.
The Queens nest is near mine four, jump into a hole left by one of the
Ants, and leave a time-bomb.

End.
