                               LSD PRESENT

           THE COMPLETE AMIGA HARDWARE REFERENCE MANUAL (1.3)


This manual covers the A1000, A500, and A2000 release machines.

This edition of the manual was edited and typeset on an Amiga 2500
running AMIX.

It was scanned by Shagratt & Parasite of LSD on an Apple Mac 2, A4
flatbed scanner, running omnipage OCR software.  It was edited by
Parasite (with some help from Shagratt) on protext 5, all diagrams
were hand drawn by Parasite & Monty Python, using Deluxe paint 3.

The text of the original version of this manual was written by Robert
Peck, Susan Deyl, Jay Miner, and Chris Raymond; other contributors
included Bill Kolb, Dave Needle, Lee Ho, and Dale Luck.

This manual was revised by Joe Augenbraun, Dan Baker, Greg Berlin, Ken
Farinsky, Glenn Keller, Bryce Nesbitt, Nancy Rains, and Carolyn
Scheppner.

Special thanks to Thomas Rokicki of Radical Eye Software and Jez San of
Argonaut Software Ltd. for their contributions.

This book is for all the "busy guys" who made Amiga and are Amiga.

                                 PREFACE

The Amiga Technical Reference Series is the official guide to programming
the Commodore Amiga computers. This revised edition of the Amiga Hardware
Reference Manual has been updated for version 1.3 of the Amiga operating
system and the new Amiga computer systems.
This manual provides information about the Amiga graphics, audio
hardware, and how the Amiga talks to the outside world through peripheral
devices. A portion of this manual is a tutorial on writing assembly
language programs to directly control the Amiga's graphics and hardware.

This book is intended for the following audiences:

o Assembly language programmers who need a more direct way of interacting
with the system than the routines described in the Amiga ROM Kernel
Reference Manual:
Includes and Autodocs and Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Libraries
and Devices.

o Designers who want to interface with new peripherals to the Amiga.

o Anyone who wants to know how the Amiga hardware works.

Here is a brief overview of the contents:

Chapter 1, Introduction. An overview of the hardware and survey of the
Amiga's graphics and audio features.

Chapter 2, Coprocessor Hardware. Using the Copper coprocessor to control
the entire graphics and audio system; directing mid-screen modifications
in graphics displays and directing register changes during the time
between displays.

Chapter 3, Playfeld Hardware. Creating, displaying and scrolling the
playfields, one of the basic display elements of the Amiga; how the Amiga
produces multi-color, multigraphical bit-mapped displays.

Chapter 4, Sprite Hardware. Using the eight sprite direct-memory access
(DMA) channels to make sprite movable objects; creating their data
structures, displaying and moving them, reusing the DMA channels.

                                 - iii -


Chapter 5, Audio Hardware. Overview of sampled sound; how to produce
quality sound, simple and complex sounds, and modulated sounds.

Chapter 6, Blitter Hardware. Using the blitter DMA channel to create
animation effects and draw lines into playfields.

Chapter 7, System Control Harware. Using the control registers to define
depth arrangement of graphics objects, detect collisions between graphics
objects, control direct memory access, and control interrupts.

Chapter 8, Interface Hardware. How the Amiga talks to the outside world
through controller ports, keyboard, audio jacks and video connectors,
serial and parallel interfaces; information about the disk controller and
RAM expansion slot.

Appendixes. Alphabetical and address-order listings of all the graphics
and audio system registers and the functions of their bits, system memory
map, descriptions of internal and extemal connectors, specifications for
the peripheral interface ports, and specifications for the keyboard.

Glossary. After the appendixes, there is a glossary of important terms.

We suggest that you use this book according to your level of familiarity
with the Amiga system. Here are some suggestions:

o If this is your initial exposure to the Amiga, read chapter 1, which
gives a survey of all the hardware features and a brief rundown of
graphics and audio effects created by hardware interaction.

o If you are already familiar with the system and want to acquaint
yourself with how the various bits in the hardware registers govem the
way the system functions, browse through chapters 2 through 8. Examples
are included in these chapters.

o For advanced users, the appendixes give a concise summary of the entire
register set and the uses of the individual bits. Once you are familiar
with the effects of changes in the various bits, you may wish to refer
more often to the appendixes than to the explanatory chapters.

The other manuals in this series are the Amiga ROM Kernel Reference
Manual: Libraries and Devices, with tutorial-style chapters on the use of
each Amiga system library and device, and the Arniga ROM Kernel Reference
Manual: Includes and Autodocs, an alphabetically organized reference of
autodoc function summaries, Amiga system include files, and the IFF file
format specifications.

Hardware designers should contact Commodore Amiga Technical Support for
appropriate documents.

ERROR REPORTS
In a complex technical manual, errors are often found after publication.
When errors in this manual are found, they will be corrected in the
following printing. Updates will be published in the AmigaMail technical
support publication.

Bug reports can be sent to Commodore electronically or by mail. Submitted
reports must be clear, complete, and concise. Reports must include a
telephone number and enough information so that the bug can be quickly
verified from your report. (i.e. please describe the bug and all the
steps needed to reproduce it.)
