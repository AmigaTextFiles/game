    Whenever you see a ***STORY*** that means to pay extra attention to
    story to get the important 4 threads.  It is easy to get the 4
    threads by lookin at the colors that the distaff releases during the
    sounds.  It is a good idea to save your game before you see these
    stories in case you couldn't catch it the first time.  Also, you
    have to case reverse of a spell. Example: If the OPEN spell is
    "ECED" you would use "DECE" in order to get the reverse effect.
