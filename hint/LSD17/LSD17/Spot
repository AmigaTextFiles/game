                               SPOTLIGHT ON SPOT

    Who is Spot? He's that ultra-cool, wild and unpredictable 7up
 character whose crazy antics have been stirring up excitement on
 television screens throughout America.

    Prepare yourself to get down and boogie with those mischievious
 and totally fun-loving characters because now Spot has party-hopped 
 to your very own computer screens.

    See Spot as he travels across the play board that you can custom 
 design.

                                GETTING STARTED

 and you are automatically in control of the red game pieces and your
 opponent is a level 1 computer player in charge of the green pieces.

 play boards if you don't want to--When you fing the play board you
 want just stop pressing FIRE or S.

     CUSTOM EDIT A SCREEN:  Move the hand into the square(s) you wish

 may be added or eliminated by moving the hand into the square you

     To undo your changes and return to the original 49-square play
 board, move the hand to UNDO CHANGES and press FIRE.

     To go into the options menu, youmust move the hand to OPTIONS
 and press FIRE.  Once the Options menu is displayed, you can move 
 the hand around the screen by moving the mouse, arrow keys or
 joystick in the appropriate directions.


                       OPTION SCREEN INSTRUCTIONS

     1. SPOTS OR PIECES: If you move the hand to the drawing of SPOT in
 the center of the Options menu and press FIRE, you can choose to play 
 with Spot or with regular game pieces.  When the backgroung in the
 drawing is dark, Spot is deactivatedand when the background is light,
 Spot plays.  Don't worry about hurting Spots feelings--He won't mind
 a little vacation.  Game play is exactly the same whether you use
 Spot or not.

     2. PLAYER TIME LIMIT: This selects the lengthof time allowed for
 a player to complete a move.

   Press FIRE to cycle through the following choices:          No timer
                                                              5 seconds
                                                             10 seconds
                                                             20 seconds
                                                             30 seconds 
                                                             40 seconds

     Stop on the time limit you want. Move the hand to another 
 option or return to the opening screens by moving the hand to EXIT
 and pressing FIRE.

     How about an example of how this option effects game play?  No
 problem.  If, for instance, you select a five second clock and fail 
 to take you turn in that time, you forfeit your turn.

     3. GAME TIME LIMIT:
 
     Unlike the player time limit, this option allows you to select 
 total game time; that is, to select how much time the total game
 will take to complete.

     To select the game time limit, you must move the hand to the
 time clock square.

     Press FIRE to cycle through the following choices:    NO CLOCK
                                                           1 MINUTE
                                                           2 MINUTES
                                                           3 MINUTES
                                                           5 MINUTES
                                                           7 MINUTES
                                                           9 MINUTES
     Stop to the time limit you want.  Move the hand to another
 option or return to the opening screen by moving to EXIT and pressing
 FIRE.


     4. EXTRAS

     The EXTRAS square allows you to switch secret spot squares off 
 or on.

     If you wish to deactivate the square, move the hand to the center
 of the Options menu to the word EXTRAS and press Fire until the
 background in dark blue.  The secret spot is activated when the
 backgroung is green.

     When you finish choosing all player selection options and time 
 limit Options, Move the hand to the word EXIT in the middle of the
 screen and press FIRE.  You can exit at any time to return to the
 opening screen.


     MOVING YOUR SPOT:

     1. CLONE: If you move your piece into an empty adjacent square
 you will duplicate the piece by one

     2. CAPTURE: If you move your piece into any area adjacent to an
 enemy piece, you will duplicate your piece

     3. SKIP: You may skip over one square (enpty or occupied) by
 moving one of your pieces in any direction. But, if you skip over a 
 square you are only moving your piece, not cloning it. This leaves 
 an empty space in the square you started from, so be careful!!!!!
 However, you still capture all your opponents' pieces around the
 square you skip to.

     4. SIDE SKIP: You can also "SIDE SKIP" by moving two squares.  
 You will leave an empty space behind you.  However, any of your 
 opponents' pieces bordering on the square you have just entered 
 will become clones of your game piece.
