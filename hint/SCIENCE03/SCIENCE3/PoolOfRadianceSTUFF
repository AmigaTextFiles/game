   TABLE OF EXPERIENCE PER LEVEL
   The following shows the amount of experience a character must earn
to gain a level in his character class. All experience earned by
multiple-class characters is divided by the number of classes. When a
character has earned a gain in level for one class but not another, the
Show command shows his highest level. Thus, a character who is a
fighter-thief and has earned 1,800 experience points in each class (a
total of 3,600 XP), will be shown to be 2nd level because he has earned
that level as a thief, though not as a fighter. His fighting abilities
are still based on his being a 1st level fighter.

   CLERICS vs. UNDEAD
   A good or evil cleric (not a neutral one) has a certain influence on
undead. He extends this influence by using the Turn command in the
Combat Menu. His level determines how many undead and what kind he can
influence. Evil clerics can make undead either neutral or friendly to
the party. Good clerics can drive the undead away and may be able to
destroy them if the cleric is of a high enough level and the undead are
of a low-enough level.
   The following is a list of undead in increasing order of power and
what minimum level of cleric a character has to be to have any
influence over them. Low level clerics generally have a chance, not a
certainty, of affecting undead.
 
                      Minimum
   Undead Type       Level of Cleric
 
   Skeleton                1st

   Ghoul                   1st

   GLOSSARY OF AD&D GAME TERMS AND COMPUTER TERMS
 
   ABILITY SCORES. These are numbers that describe the attributes of
the characters. There are six ability scores: Strength, Intelligence,
Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma. For the most part, the
range of numbers runs from 3 to 18, the higher the better.
 
   ADVENTURER. This is a term for one of the characters you play in
this game.
 
   ALIGNMENT. This is the basic philosophy of a character. See

Alignment in the What are Characters? section of the rule book.
 
   CHARACTER. This is another name for one of the persons you play in
the game. A party consists of several characters.
 
   COMMAND. A one or two word option in a menu. Activating the command
allows you either to view another menu or have your characters perform
an action.
 
   ENCOUNTER. This is what happens when a party meets a monster. You
are given a menu of choices of how you want to handle the situation.
 
   ENTER. The act of giving a command to the computer. How this is done
varies depending on the computer.
 
   EXPERIENCE POINTS (XP). Every encounter the characters have yields
experience points for every character depending on how successful the
encounter was for the party. A character who gains enough XP can
advance a level if he has enough gold for training.
 
   FACING. In combat, a character faces a certain direction. An attack
from the direction he is not facing has a greater chance of doing
damage. A character will always face an opponent if he has only one
opponent.
 
   HIT POINTS (HP). This is a measure of how healthy a character is.
Damage from weapons subtracts hit points from the characters total.
When he has lost all of his hit points, he is unconscious and dying. If
his wounds are bound by another party member, he is simply unconscious.
 
   ICON. This is the small picture of a monster or a character seen in
the initial stages of an encounter and during combat. Character icons
can be altered using the Alter command in the Camp Menu.
 
   INITIATIVE. This is a semi-random determination of which character
in a combat acts first. The characters with higher dexterities have a
better chance for a higher initiative.
 
   LEVEL. This describes the power of a number of different items. The
power of characters, dungeons, monsters, and spells are all described
with levels.
 
   CHARACTER LEVEL. This is a determination of how much experience a
character has. The higher the level, the more experienced and important
the character is. High-level spellcasters can cast high level spells.
 
   DUNGEON LEVEL. This is a measure of how far down in the earth a
dungeon is. For the most part, the further down one is, the more
ferocious the monsters. Thus, a high-level dungeon refers either to how
deep it goes or the relative toughness of the monsters.
 
   MONSTER LEVEL. This is a measure or how powerful monsters are. The
higher the level, the more powerful the monster.
 
   SPELL LEVEL. Spells come in degrees of difficulty. The higher the
level of the spell, the higher the difficulty. Only very experienced
magic-users and clerics can learn high level spells.
 
   MAGIC. This term covers spellcasting, enchanted items, and any other
application of the supernatural.
 
   MELEE COMBAT. This is hand-to-hand combat with weapons such as
swords, spears, and fists.
 
   MISSILE COMBAT. This is ranged combat with weapons such as bows and
arrows, crossbows and quarrels, and slings and slingstones.
 
   MONSTER. This term actually includes human and other player races as
well as such creatures as ogres and dragons. In general, if it isn't
part of your party, it's a monster. Monsters are not necessarily
hostile. Some may be helpful. That's what the Parlay command in the
Encounter Menu is for.
 
   NON-PLAYER CHARACTER (NPC). This is a member of a player character
race who is not controlled by the player. Some NPCs can be brought into
a party.
 
   PARTY. The group of adventurers you form to perform the missions you
are given. A party can be reformed for each adventure, and even altered
during the course of an adventure.
 
   PLAYER CHARACTER (PC). This is a member of a player character race
who is controlled by the player. The characters in your adventuring
party are PCs.
 
   SPELL. This is a magic incantation that can alter the nature of
reality. Both magic-users and clerics can cast spells after memorizing
them. If the spell is cast, it is gone from the user's mind and must be
re-memorized.
 
   SPELL BOOK. The book a magic-user carries his spells in. If he
doesn't have a magic book, he has no spells to memorize.
 
            ARMOR AND WEAPONS PERMITTED BY CHARACTER CLASS
 
   Class        Armor      Shield      Weapons
 
   Cleric       any        any         club, flail, hammer, mace, staff
