                       BEAST II - PASSWORD'S & CHEAT MODE

                             AUGUST - 21 - 1990

Ok after a few hours of eye poping, source code searching i found the
following information.


CHEAT MODE - When the game starts at level one, go to the right until you
             get to the forest, where the warrior says to you, "DO NOT ENTER
             THESE WOODS",  PRESS  A  than type  TEN PINTS  than it will say
             THIS ONE IS FOR YOU ROGER.  CHEAT MODE ACTIVATED.  This is the
             only place where i have found this PASSWORD TO WORK.


LEVEL PASSWORDS - HERE THEY ARE DUDES.

LEVEL 1 -  ETERNITY

LEVEL 2 -  SUNSTONE

LEVEL 3 -  NECROPOLIS


I am not sure if there are any other levels out there but, these are the only
ones i have found so far.

PS: Try these words in the game.  MALETO, KARAM, PIGM, PYGM, SEA, OLD, MAN
                                  COMPA, SACK, PACK, GATE.
 
   HAVE FUN, AND HOPE YOU FINISH THE GAME.
