                           Pool of Radiance codes

1. Find your first Icon on the left side under coulumn 1, 2, 3 or 4.
2. Now locate your second Icon on the right side of the columns.
3. Start with the Icon just right of your first Icon and count down the
   columns until you reach your second Icon.  Go down the columns and
   continue from the top of the next column.  Count only Icons on the right
   side.
4. The number you end up with when you hit your Icon is the number you look
   up below for your password.
5. ...... is the 1st word, .._.._.. is the 2nd word and ----- is the third
   word after each number below.

EXAMPLE:  Your 1st Icon is the td icon in the top left corner.  2nd Icon is
the I on the top right.  Count from the Icon to the right of td (upside
down T) and you should end up with 28.  Only count the Icons on the right
side of the columns.  Your program asks for word (------), so look below at
#28 and see that your password is "IXYUSI".  EASY!

PRINTING INFO:  
     To make a complete document, you will need to first print out the file
"PoolCode.pic."  Use DPaint or your favorite paint program.  Start the
print at the top of the page.  Then print this file on the line directly
below where the picture leaves off.  When printing this file, be sure to
set your column guides for 1 left and 80 right.  (in your prefs)  Use
Diamond 12pnt for your font.  Before printing the file, cut this printing
part out.
     If you do correctly, you should have a one sheet code doc.  The bottom
set of codes should be neet and in three even columns.  If not, try again. 
I used the following: Photon paint to print the picture. Excellence to
print the text file.
