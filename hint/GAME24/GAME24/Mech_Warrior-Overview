Standing between you  and a  mission complete is  70  tons of  armor plate,
myomer  muscle and  lethal weaponry.   Just another day's  work for a  31st
century MechWarrior.  If you're the better pilot, you'll walk away with the
money,  the salvaged parts and  your life.  Prove yourself enough times and
you can  afford a  full four-Mech lance.   Forge  your lance in the fire of
combat and you'll be ready to take on the  Dark Wing,  scourge of the Inner
Sphere.

Go where the money is.  Negotiate your best deal, then travel the Inner
Sphere and do battle on a variety of terrains.

Plan fast and take command.  Missions range from simple raids to grueling
extended campaigns.  Be ready, your recon data may be wrong.

Push it to the limit.  Your fusion reactor is about to shut down.  Stall
for time with a barrage of Short Range Missiles.

Don't Expect mercy.  Don't give it.  Salvage what you can when the battle's
over.  Repair or replace your Mechs at the Mech Complex.
