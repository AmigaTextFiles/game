GETTING STARTED WITH MECHWARRIOR

Your package includes four 5 1/4 inch floppy disks and two 3 1/2 inch
floppy disks.ú Make backup copies of these disks before you begin play -
see the appendix for instructions on making backups.

** (MECHWARRIOR IS NOT SOFTWARE COPY PROTECTED, SO BE SURE TO KEEP BACKUPS
AND DON'T BE HESITANT TO INSTALL IT ON YOUR HARD DISK).

Also see the appendix for configuration options available to you when
loading MechWarrior.

To load MechWarrior from floppy disks:

1. Turn on your computer and monitor and load DOS.
2. Insert your backup copy of disk 1 in drive A and switch to that drive by
typing A: and pressing ENTER.
3. At the A> prompt, type MW and press ENTER.

You may use the spacebar or fire button to skip past the credits.ú At this
point you will be asked to enter an authorization code.ú See below for
details.

To install MechWarrior on a hard disk:

1. Insert your backup copy of disk 1 in drive A and switch to that drive by
typing A: and pressing ENTER.

2. Type INSTALL followed by the hard drive designator (for example, C:) and
press ENTER.

This will create a new directory, called MECHWAR, and copy all the files
from the floppy disk into that directory on the hard drive.ú You'll be
prompted to insert the other disk(s) as required.

To start from the Hard drive, switch to the MECHWAR directory by typing CD
MECHWAR and pressing ENTER.ú Then, to begin the game, type MW and press
ENTER.

YOUR AUTHORIZATION CODE

Each time you start MechWarrior, you'll be asked for an authorization code
that matches the code pattern for a particular Mech shown on the screen.ú
The codes are included for each Mech in the section "BattleMech
Descriptions" in the Mercenaries Handbook.ú Enter the correct code, then
press ENTER.ú Failure to enter the correct code 3 times in a row will
result in your being returned to DOS.

Once you've entered the correct code, you'll be dirtside.ú Check out the
section in the Mercenaries Handbook entitled 'The Mercenaries Life' for the
options available to you.
