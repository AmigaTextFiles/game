                   GAME CHEATS  &  BACKDOORS (Update 12/6/91)

	The following list of 358 game cheats and backdoors was compiled by
POSTCARD MAN from magazines and miscellanous postings on docs disks and BBSs.
I believe it is the most comprehensive file to date since it incorporates
nearly every cheat file published. I never verified many of these cheats.
Sometimes more than one password is given since different sources list
different cheats. Sometimes the Atari ST cheat is listed by mistake instead 
of the Amiga cheat. I certainly don't have all of these games nor would I
have the time to play and test each cheat if I did. But I do make corrections
as soon as I know about a mistake. The file is turning into a book (4780 
lines at 66 lines / page = 73 pages). If the reader would like to add to or
ammend this file please contact me by mail. Send paper listing of info or 
cheats on disk (if you don't care about returned disk) to:

____________________________________________________________________________

BANE OF THE COSMIC FORGE (WIZARDRY)

The password to enter the door in the SE tower of the 1st level is
SNOOPCHERI. Use the ROTTEN CHEESE on the MOUSEHOLE.

Some small help for playing the game successfully:

A tremendous source for playing the game can be found in getting BANE
OF THE COSMIC FORGE COMPILATION  released by Baser Evil on the 6th of
March, it contains many helpful maps to the game with marked location.

When you create your characters, it may be a good idea just to make
all of them Dracons. This is untested, but unless you have at least
one of this fire breathing race you surely won't survive the game. So
maybe it would be good to have more. Use a good mix of the classes,
try to take one of each spell class and a good solid theif that is at
full strength. Get a good enough thief and you don't need a fighter.
It may be slow, but keep rolling until you get the best character possible. 
Be sure to make at least  one character female, there are places in the 
game where this is a must. Dont do it and be sorry later!

Diversify your skills. Have each character specialise in a few skills
relative to his class. Do not worry about developing weapons skills,
you have no use for them if you created your party correctly.

In fights early in the game use Dracons breath attack, just be careful
not to overextend yourself. Rest after each encounter, backing up your
hard work. Allways search the area after a combat.

Search each square you step in. Not only this, but search facing all
four directions, many things can only be found that way.

Thieves are  not always true. If you find a lock and have your thief
open it,  always guess it is POISON unless  you are 100% sure (i.e.
tried it before) because it is better to suffer something else than to
die by getting this wrong.

Don't bash doors early in the game!  If your characters are not very
strong you  will be sorry. Jammed doors do you no good, as you might
never be able to open them again. Same foes for picking the lock. Wait
until you get a caster capable of conjuring  KNOCK KNOCK  with at least 
18 points (preferably 24) and do it this way. It is much more sure.

Once you know there are secret  panels or buttons, keep walking past
them until you discover them. You can find them by looking at the maps
and know where they are, sometimes it takes awhile to sense them.

BARBARIAN II (Palace):  step-by-step walk-thru:
 
Level 1:  left, left, right seven times, left, right, left, in the cave,
and right.  Level 2:  right, up, left, up, left, left, right, left three
times, up, and left.  Level 3:  up, right, right, up, left, right, up, right,
left, left, up, left, left, up, up, right, right, left, left, up.  Level 4:
hit the fireballs, then try to leap across.  Several low chops will destroy
it.  Next is the Pit Demon; when he reaches out, use an overhead chop to hit
his arms; repeat until death.  Next, Drax himself!  Wait until he pauses
between spells, and hit him with a flying head chop!  The End...

BARD'S TALE

Load your party, go to the statistics screen for the first player.
To get more gold than you will ever need (and then some), transfer all
the parties gold to one player. Save him to disk then load him back up
and transfer all to another. Keep repeating this process till you have
done it to all the players, then exit without saving. Load back up and
all your players will have the amount of gold equal to that of the en-
tire party before. Repeat until satisfied.

___________________________________________________________________________

BIO CHALLENGE

Pause with ESC and G key will advance you to the end of level guardian
(as if you want to go there).

Hints for the first three levels:
        LEVEL 1: Get the green armous as soon as possible. If you have
all of the amulet, don't go to the sphere unless you have collected at
least four lots of monster remains, you'll need them to battle the end
of level guardian. He's a bit soft in the head, so time your jumps
carefully, and hit him there.
        LEVEL 2: There are four planets to visit, go to everyone if
you want to get maximum points. Again, the green armour is very
useful, so get it as quickly as possible. There's loads of ammo for
the guardian of this level, unfortunetly that means there's loads of
monsters to deal with. The back of the guardians head is the weak
spot.
        LEVEL 3: Stand on the slabs and summersault. There are six
planets here, and the transporters are more difficult to so, so you
have to watch more carefully.
___________________________________________________________________________

BIONIC COMMANDO

Exit from level 1 exactly when the timer reads 1 for nine lives and a
super high score.
___________________________________________________________________________

BOMBUZAL

Actually there is a hidden pause control in the game. When you press the
spacebar to access the overhead map screen, if you keep it held down the
clock stops until you release it.

When reaching a new level, it's worthwhile to sacrifice a life to see the
explosion pattern.  When trying to detonate a pulsing bomb, pick it up; it's
easier to see its size.  You are invulnerable to explosions when teleporting,
so use it to your advantage!  A blind droid can't activate switches.  Also,
here's a revised list of the level access codes:

ordinates of all the other aliens around by asking CODE 
INFORMATION HELP. If you're met with blind ignorance then put in 
the name of an alien after the HELP.

CARRIER COMMAND

While in the Walrus arming menu, select nine Harbinger surface to surface
missiles and put them in the AAV.  Select the Avatar Chemical Laser and place
it over the missiles.  Then select the pod you want (ACCB, Virus Bomb, Fuel)
and place it in the AAV.  Then, when you've launched the AAV, look at it's
weapons and you'll find you have BOTH missiles and laser!  On returning to
the carrier any missiles you have left will be added to the ship's stores.
Carry on doing this and hundreds of missiles can be yours.  Another cheat:
while in the pause mode, type GROW OLD ALONG WITH ME (include the spaces).
You should now see the message "Cheat mode active".  Pressing the + key on
the numeric keypad protects your Mantas and AAVs from missile attacks. The -
key can be used to turn this off.  Pressing the following keys in sequence:
'Help', Q, S, Control, Alternate, gives you a little message. Pressing the 9
on the keypad displays the current level.  6 and 8 have some other effect.
Returning to the title screen, press the + and - keys to view all objects in
the game.

++++++++++++++++
A different source claims the following cheat:

Pause the game from the main view screen and type:
THE BEST IS YET TO BE, complete with spaces.  The game restarts
automatically, and  displays  ' Cheat Mode Activated ' in the message panel.
Use the + and - keys to display all objects. 
      
When paused, pressing + and - on the numeric keypad toggles
Manta invincibility: the flying craft are no longer vulnerable to aerial 
attack, although collision with large objects is still fatal. Once a course
has been programmed for the carrier, Mantas or Walruses, engage autopilot 
and click on pause. To avoid sloggin around inreal type, you will find that 
pressing 3 on the keypad and unpausing again takes the corresponding craft 
directly to its destination. Likewise, pausing and pressing 2 replaces lost
shielding, while tapping 1 refuels the craft in question. 9 shows the 
current difficulty level, 7 speeds up the game and 6 brings up the 
programmers' test palette!

A lot in this excellent simulation. PAUSE the game and type
GROW OLD ALONG WITH ME then press + on the numeric keypad for your 
mantas and walruses to become sheilded. Press - to disable.

Try pressing CTRL and M on the main screen for some interesting effects.

CHAOS STRIKES BACK

Find a dragon and cast MON ZO GOR SAR and hit ESC to pause the game. Hold
down the ALT key and type in LORD LIBRASULUS SMITHES THEE DOWN. Unpuse
the game and slay the beast. He leaves behind a firestaff and your party
will be invincible.

Undocumented Spells:
GOR IR KU   - Detects Monsters
GOR IR ROS  - Detects fake walls and "invisible" (actually hard to see) pits
GOR IR DAIN - Detects "magic" on screen?
ZO IR NETA  - Anchors the map at the point of casting so that as you move 
              around, the map view stays at the anchored position.

(hint #1)
It's _REALLY_ easy to kill _ANY_ dragon.  Here's how.
1) Prepare all your players with MON IR VEN spells (mega poison cloud)
2) Use the green freeze life box (on the dragon)
3) Cast the spells, and then double up on each player
   (ie. each player casts 2 spells for a total of 8)
4) Wait... dinner will be served soon.

(hint #2)
Using the Vorpal Blade:
If you don't have both Vorpal Blades, you can increase #hits/time by
passing the weapon back and forth between the two attacking players.
(ie.  hit -> pass blade to #2 -> hit -> pass back to #1 -> hit ->...

(hint #3)
Contrary to what I've read on the net, everything is affected by
fireballs, including knights and dragons.  The only exceptions are
slime, black flames, and the thing that pops up from the floor.

Vader on the screen shots in the advertisement. Here's how: Hold down
the HELP key and type 'XIFARGROTKEV' on the title screen (That's
VEKTORGRAFIX backwards). You are now invulnerable. Hit 'L', 'D', and

ENLIGHTENMENT

To find secret levels at the start of the game immediately go left to the
desert, then continue left to the fire zone. Head to the uppermost left
corner of this area and you should see lava with a patch on it that looks
like a section of the Firewall spell. As quickly as you can, walk on this
patch and you'll be wisked away to secret levels.
___________________________________________________________________________

FA-18 INTERCEPTOR (Electronic Arts)

Taxi down U.S. 101, turn right at Highway 92, pull up to the EA Headquarters
and blow it away!

In mission 6, once you've fired all your missiles, you can land on the
Shadow Sub (if it's still afloat) and it will refuel and rearm you.

Select option "2 Free Flight, no enemy confrontation" from the main menu.
Then select zero instead of 1 to 4.  The screen will go into a spiral and
scroll way south to 34 by 117 degrees, placing your plane somewhere without a
runway.  This happens to be in the middle of Edwards Air Force Base, where
the F/A-18 was flight tested.  hmmmm...  To take off you have to use the
afterburners.  117 degrees is the furthest south you'll be able to fly, but
you can go in other directions.  (Is there more to this back door?  hmm)
___________________________________________________________________________

FAERY TALE ADVENTURE

Take a save game file and use a PD program such as NewZap to patch byte
18 to a non-zero value.  Load your save game, and now these cheat options
are enabled:

  Arrow Keys - Move Rapidly over any terrain
  B          - Summon Gold Swan
  R          - Rescue Princess
  =          - Display coordinates
  F10        - Location in coordinates
  F9         - Increase time by 1 hour

Sometimes you can accumulate all the treasure you want by going near the
item, pressing space bar, and then continue hitting 'T'.  You'll receive
an infinate supply of that treasure.

Save your position in a dungeon.  Then go through it until you run out of
keys.  When you restore your game, all the doors will be open and you will
have a new set of keys.  Also works in caves.

Jump on the turtle and start slashing.  Your bravery points will go up to
infinity and it doesn't hurt you or the turtle.

On the island with the Crystal Castle, press the right mouse button while
talking to the Sorceress and your luck will go up to 65.  'ASK'ing the
Sorceress several times will usually boost your luck.

If running low on Green keys, use a secret entrance for the fort.
It's on the left side, almost even with the door.

Beating the Turtle is not beating, it is pushing, so push the turtle across 
the land, to use it in special places: The turtle was programmed in asbestos,
and can swim in Lava. It can be used to enter the black citadel at the south.
Also, while it is present, you are not attacked, but by the time one has the
turtle, one is already invincible.
__________________________________________________________________________

FALCON

Press CONTROL-X ( X  SHIFT & CONTROL keys) for increased afterburners,

For a perfect landing every time, hold HELP key down about 10 - 20 feet
above runway.

++++++++++++++++

Load it and start playing.  Press ESC.  Now, start a new game while pressing
E.  You should now be in the cheat mode.  If that doesn't work, enter SWAMP
THING into the high-score table, and restart a game while pressing E.  Now,
you can change levels by pressing + and -.  Move the joystick diagonal
up/left, press fire, then press E.  You now enter the game editor.  Pressing
ESC returns you to the level selector mode (pressing SPACE from the level
selection mode returns you to the game).  While in the game editor, press
these keys:  P - alter the game's palette (use 1,2,3,4,5 and 6 from keypad),
X - modify the exits (use - and + on keypad to select exit number, then press
S, then use + and - again to set the exit level.  Use cursor to set
position), W - weapons distribution, works like the exits distribution mode.

++++++++++++++++
Start the game as normal, collect the ship and fly to the extreme top 
left of the playing area. Disembark from the ship and drive the buggy
into the corner. Type in STONKER and re-enter the ship. Now pressing D
cycles through the available  weapons (including shield plus weapons), and
pressing C cycles through the levels.  NOTE: when entering a level, it's
always best to station the ship at the top left of the screen again, to
avoid  appearing at an illegal position, or even off-screen. On the
second level repeat the above process, getting the buggy back in the top
left hand corner, and retype STONKER again. It now enables the ship to fly
through walls, and pressing F while hovering over switches allows them to
be collected while in the air.
__________________________________________________________________________

GAUNTLET II

You need 2 keys and 2 locked treasure chests.  As you open the first chest,
hold down the Help key, collect the treasure.  Open the second chest while
holding down Insert.  An Ankh will appear and you must collect it.  You'll
hear a gong.  You should now have 50,000 health points and 32,000 reflective
super-shots.  The shots will vanish once you leave the level, and if you pick
up an amulet, the counter will be reset to 10 shots. (?? What Insert Key?)

GENGHIS KHAN

If you get a land that isn't connected with an enemy, move everything
to your home country. The land will be safe, but if another leader
captures a nearby land, make sure you put something back in or he will

Start the game, and lo and behold, MORE LIVES.
____________________________________________________________________________

GLOBULOUS

Type Zvmo!EG as a password for the cheat mode.
NOTE: Use upper and lower case as shown!

The most important thing to remember is that ALL the puzzles can be
solved without losing a life, so if you lose a life and think its the
only way to solve the screen, look closely. Some of the puzzles get
pretty obscure after level 10, but once you eventually beat them youll
kick yourself for not seeing the solution earlier.

Look before you leap. Think about how the screen will look from a
flipped perspective. A lot of jumps you make will be unnecessary and
waste time and switches if you dont.

Make sure you have enough switches, at least 10 per screen. It is
possible to get stuck on a downward slope with no way to get back up
or kill yourself, and the only way out is to press ESC and start the
whole game over.

Here are a few codes you might like to try:

     Level 06 - IVEs8AZ?

HARDBALL (Accolade):

  Various hints:
 
  * Allstars are better than champs, 
  * Only steal if you actually hit the ball, 
  * Try to get a lot of runs early, as the computer team improves
    towards the end, 
  * Bunting rarely works, 
  * Halfway through the match, swap Laws for Wells and Wratten for Harris. 
  * The best pitchers are Oliver, Perez, Leary, Cook.  The others
    will only be successful for a short while, 
  * Never pitch fastballs to the center as they will usually result
    in home runs, 
  * Change pitchers after a few innings, because as they get tired,
    their accuracy and speed get worse.
____________________________________________________________________________

HARD DRIVIN' & HARD DRIVIN' II

Get to full speed (preferably but not necessary) and press 'N' for neutral.
Now you can cruise along at full speed with easy steering and
invulnerability.  As long as you stay in neutral you will have unlimited
time as well.

Another trick is to repeatedly hit the 4 key (4th gear) until the program
has an error.  Continue with the right mouse button.  Repeat until you get
a high score.
___________________________________________________________________________

HAWKEYE:

Pause the game and press DEL then when you die you will be warped

HEROES OF THE LANCE (SSI)

Some general tips:  
Arrange your party so that the first line consists of two strong warriors,
Raistlin and Goldmoon.  This allows you to use Raistlin's magic and the
healing staff of Goldmoon without too much hassle.  Save Tanis and Riverwind
for the later levels, where the bows come in handy.  When fighting Gully
Dwarves, use Tasslehoff who is the same height as them.  His sling stones
will never miss.  Avoid fighting Hatchlings, they're not worth it.  Just turn
and run when you meet one; when you reach an intersection move into a new
path and wait a little.  When you return, the Hatchling will have gone.
Killing Bozaks:  two methods:  1) get Raistlin to use a web, sleep or charm
spell to stun it, then send a warrior to clobber it to death, or 2) select
Flint, who is a dwarf; 9 out of 10 times, the Bozak's shots will go over his
head; get close to enter melee combat, and use low thrusts to kill it.
Spectral Minions:  they're easy to kill, so use a warrior.  Wraiths:  a
well-timed throw of an axe kills them every time.  If you miss, use a sword
and chest-thrust movements.  Don't let it get too close to you!  Spiders:
use low thrusts to keep them at bay.  If they get through your guard, retreat
until you can turn and fight again.  The blue and green potions restore
health, red slows down monsters, and yellow give your characters extra
confidence.

  Level 1 - Just hit return    Level 4 - LUGOSI
  Level 2 - WOLFMAN            Level 5 - NOSFERATU
  Level 3 - HAMMER             Level 6 - GARLIC

Type in BOGEYMAN for infinite lives
___________________________________________________________________________

HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER (Datasoft)

If you are surrounded by the enemy ships then simply save the game.
When you restore that game all the ships have disappeared.
__________________________________________________________________________

HYBRIS

Load the game as usual and don't do anything until the high score screen
appears.  Type 'COMMANDER' and then press the fire button.  After a few
moments press F10.  If your ship flickers you are now invulnerable, and have
infinite expansions and smart bombs.

F1-F5 = Other Six Levels of 'expansion' (you can still capture the capsules)
F8    = Advance a level (There are three)
F10   = Turn cheat mode on/off

You cannot get a high score with the cheat mode on.
At the title screen type SPACE or ESC key (I forgot exactly which one)
Now you'll get a screen in which you can edit a lot of game parameters.

__________________________________________________________________________

IKARI WARRIORS

Play game, get high score, type FREERIDE and press Return.  When the high

INTERNATIONAL ATHLETICS

This method is easier than wagging your joystick until either you break it
or your arm falls off. Plug your mouse and plug it in the joystick port.
When you move your mouse round and round on your mousepad, your man runs at
full speed and you rack up immpressive times.
___________________________________________________________________________

INTERNATIONAL KARATE + (System 3)

When you are hit, pause the game (space) and unpause again (space).
You will now be invulnerable.  Be careful, this works for the computer too!

it you are taken into view mode which allows you to cycle thru all the 
aliens and all the objects in the game. You also have complete mouse control
over them - you can make them rotate and zoom in and out by holding down the
left button and moving the mouse. To go to the next object hit the right
hand mouse button.
___________________________________________________________________________

INSANITY FIGHT

Press L key, the joystick button and both mouse buttons to skip a level.
___________________________________________________________________________

IT CAME FROM THE DESERT

Before attempting to go into the ants' nest, you should first save Elmer to
get more flamethrower fuel. Some time between the 8th and 10th (I don't
remember the exact day), he will leave a note in his station saying that
he is going hiking in the SW Volcanic Cone. Go to the volcano, fight the 
ants, and next day, visit Elmer's station. He'll thank you for saving his
life and give you more flamethrower fuel.

The entrance to the ants' nest will never appear on the main map, but
there are several other ways to get there:

        - By taking a flight from Hilber's Field.

        - By driving a tank from a battle going on at a nearby location.

        - By going south when you are in a battle at the M1 mine.

The entrance to the nest doesn't stay open long enough for you to get in
before the ants start invading the various locations in the town, so you'll
have to wait until they do. The 11th is the best day to enter the hole since 
it is very hot and there are few ants around. If you try cooler days, 
there willprobably be too many of them around for you to handle. Also, 
if you decide toget to the hole by plane, you can land safely on the dirt
road parallel to the tracks leading to the M1 mine.
___________________________________________________________________________

IVANHOE

DELETE kills all on screen enemies.
CONTROL kills the boss in the bonus stage.   (From The One magazine)

KEEF THE THIEF

For something interesting in this game go up into the tree houses near
the left side of the map. When you see a commercial like screen with a
woman in it make this spell: Rhino Horn, Black Pearl, Narcicus Root.
___________________________________________________________________________

down the fire button and the result will either be your keeper saving
the ball or knocking it over the net.
__________________________________________________________________________

KICK OFF 2

Keep pressing 'R' when you take a penalty.  This will show you where the

__________________________________________________________________________

If the game doesn't unpause itself, press F1 and then pause the game again
and retype above. This will make you invincible.
F6 will take you back to the shop and F8 will give you lots of money.
___________________________________________________________________________

KILLING CLOUD

When the game asks for a mission code, enter `1 KILLING'.

___________________________________________________________________________

KILLING GAME SHOW

To call up a map of level one, section one, boot up the game as normal
and when asked to hit FIRE, hit the HELP key instead. There it is. Do
the same for each section.

When the GOOD LUCK...PRESS FIRE TO CONTINUE screen appears, press HELP
to reveal a map to the level.

KINGS QUEST III

When casting a spell and asked to recite a verse just hit RETURN.

The King's Quest series of games uses the debug command and interpreter for
the programmers (up to KQIII) KQIV doesn't have it because of the tremendous
size of the game.  Have some fun and press the "ALT" key then "D" then
"Return or Enter" (I think twice) then type in either GET OBJECT (and type in
a random #) or "TP" for transport (and a random #) and see what happens.  It
works., and if you're tired looking for a certain object the "Get Object"
function works great!
___________________________________________________________________________

KLAX

Begin play then hold down either of the SHIFT keys and SPACE together.
Now press any key from 1 to 4 for different helpful effects, including
infinite credits and even a free ticket to level 100. (The One magazine)

(The below cheat is from another source and unverified)

While playing the game, press `Space' and `4' to warp to LA stage.

KRISTAL

Fights - Proficent swordplay is  essential if your to get anywhere in
the game. The neck chop is one of the more effective blows, but the
program blocks repetition of single moves. To get around this, occasionally
switch to a different move in order to enable the neck chop once
again. Give generously to the poor and you'll be a step closer to obtaining 
the Sword of the Spheres.

The Palace - To enter the palace, you'll need to get the invitation
from the elusive Gloop, found in Novala. Once you have it, keep out of
fights or you could lose it for good. When you get into the palace,
ask Nedrod three questions and he will give you the talisman, which
can help you find another useful item. Answer the Princess' question
with "Its a secret". She will give you the Ring of Belz, which will
only work in conjunction with the spell scroll.

In General - Objects are not always found in the same places from game
to game, so a detailed search of both fore and backgrounds is often in
order. To survive the final  confrontation, a high psychic rating is
needed, which can be increased by donating skringles to the poor. Dis-
orderly conduct can have the opposite effect. The safest technique in
the space battles, is to slow right down as soon as you see the aliens
shoot them all, then power at full  steam until the next lot.  Follow
Readheads ship if you see it. Heatpro tablets are necessary if you
beam down to one of the hotter planets. Makes notes of what you are
told, and use any new names or subjects to weavel out every last bit
of information from the characters.

LASER SQUAD

    In LASER SQUAD, for fun do THe Assassins on Level 1. Buy no armour,
   give the corporal an M4000 with two reloads, the next two rocket
   launchers with four rockets each, and the last two nothing at all.
   Deploy in the entrance, in the gap in the outer wall , and take the
   house to pieces with the rockets, waiting for droids or Regix to show
   up - get them with Jonlan's M4000. I managed to do the scenario with
   one shot - it went BETWEEN the leaves of the door, blew up against a
   wall and Regix was on the othe r side. End of story, fade to black.
___________________________________________________________________________

LAST DUEL

Start the game, pause with F9 key, then hold down HELP, Left Shift and 1
keys together. Unpause and the function keys will take you through all 
levels. F8 gives you five lives.
___________________________________________________________________________

LAST NINJA II

To board the helicopter at the end of level 5 you must first allow
the helicopter to leave the screen, then run to the end of the building and
jump in the direction that the helicopter left, making sure that you
completely exit from the screen.

To kill the Dragon throw a smoke bomb under him.
___________________________________________________________________________

L.E.D. STORM (US Gold)

LEATHERNECK

LIGHT CORRIDOR

First a little hint: The green diamonds are essential as these award you
with an extra life. Some of the red diamonds will allow control over two
bats but this is more of a hinderence as the two bats prove confusing.
Avoid the blue squares as they will shrink the size of your bat.

    Anyone heard of the whirl-winds?  They advance you levels.  Near the
   end of level 1_1 there are three large steps that you must climb to
   reach your brother (sister?), who is in a cage.  Stand at the left edge
   of the top step, facing left and jump.  But as you jump, fire.  If your
   current weapon is arrows, fire halfway up, but if your weapon is bombs,
   fire at the top of your jump.  A whirl-wind should appear after four
   hits, and it will take you to level 1_4.

    In 1_4, you will be in a little box under some water.  Go up and to
   the right, and you come out in a small room with three boxes on the
   right hand side.  Go up these, and you will see 4 long spaces, the top
   one having an "N" and a "D" in it.  Go up t o the top one, get the
   letters, stand in the centre of the space, facing left, and fire.  Yep,
   you guessed it, another whirl-wind.  This one takes you to level 2_4.
   There are others, but I wont tell you - it would spoil it!

    But I will tell you that there is one on level 2_4.  Happy hunting!
-----------
Or on level 2.4 , stand at the entrance to the room where the giant octopus
is located and fire to the right several times. A warp will appear that will
take you to the beginning of level 3.1.
----------------

        On level 1, part 1, move to the area containing three men with
boomerangs, shoot them. Go to the top of the third platform, move to
the left, jump and fire five times. A whirlwind in a box will appear,
if you enter it, you will be transported to the end of the level. Then
you can free Tiki's naughty friend just by jumping.
        When you recch the ice whale, move to the right-hand side of
the spikes, avoid the crystals, and wait until he picks you up. Once
inside the whale, you can start shooting, but avoid the ice drops.
        Meeting the rock monster without bombs makes him difficult to
pass. So collect bombs, go to the highest platform and shoot him. Kill
it by either dodging the bullets and hitting it when the doors open,
or by fireballs.
        The last boss you encounter is the balloon seal. He cant be
killed, by blows to the body, so you must hit the balloon. Be careful
for the balloon seal is armed with a cannon and shoots cannon balls at
tiki.

and always choose the highest paid mission. Buy fuel carefully -
only enough for that level, after level 1 you MUST buy a

fast, travelling slowly only burns more fuel. Fire bombs are more

your boots.  Now that you have gotten your boots, you are going backwards to
where you started.  Push the THIRD cactus on the way back, and a yellow
pacman will appear.  Get it, now kill player 2.  Continue playing with
player 1.  Every time player 1 dies, get the yellow pacman with player 2 and
kill player 2 immediately.  As long as you keep getting the yellow pacman
with player 2, player 1 will never die.

Hints:

Level 1 - Run to the third fire hydrant, and when you get there, jump over
          it and push it to the left.  This will give you a blue hat that
          will make you invulnerable to the little ghosts that fall from
          planes.

Level 2 - Run to the third cactus, and push it to the left.  You will now be
          invulnerable for the entire level!

Level 3 - After getting your magic boots, push the third cactus on the way
          back for a free life.

- Jump on the roof of ghost's car to escape
- Only use powerpills when ghosts are in range, or else it is wasted
- When you reach the breaktime sign, jump when you are about 1 inch away
  for a bonus (depending how high you are when the level ends)

PIRATES

When fighting against unbelievable odds don't panic. Choose the long-
sword. Keep using the slash-high attack to cause the most dammage. You
may get down to only one man left, but you can still defeat the enemy
captain. After you win, select Send A Prize Crew so you will have 
enough people to sail your ship.

Dont attack a nation your home country is allied with, it will upset
both of them.

Dont wed till youve got all your promotions, your oppurtunities will
be much better. Make conversation with all the Governors daughters,
however, they might gather important information for you from the
Governors mansion.
___________________________________________________________________________

PLAGUE

First make your score end in a three (by shooting the bubbles).
Then hit P to pause the game, then hit Escape, then click `No' when asked
if you want to play again. This takes you to the title screen with drooling
barbarian.
Now type the following; kom je illegaal door de plaag dan grijpt de jungle
command je in de kraag ; then hit Return.
Border should turn green. Hit fire button to return to game.
Now infinite lives. Must do this on Level 1 before killed even once.
____________________________________________________________________________

PLATOON

This one's cute. Type in 'Hamburger' at the title screen. The word
'Cheat' will appear below the credits press your joystck button, then
(F5) when the jungle screen comes up. Your man is now invulnerable to
the attacks of the little Commie @#!!$&*s. From here (F1) starts you
where you are, (F2) puts you at the location of the explosives, (F3)
takes you to the bridges that you have to blow up, (F4) takes you
straight to the village where the entrance to the tunnels is hidden in
one of the huts. From here on the cheat no longer works, the game runs
as normal and you can die but it certainly gets you further along the
track.

NOTE: Another cheat says password is HAMBURGER-HILL and pressing F1-F4
      skips you to the corresponding levels.

POOL OF RADIANCE

Once you find any item you can make as many copies of it as you want.
     1 - Create a dummy character.
     2 - Load a saved game and transfer all the good items to the dummy.
     3 - Remove the dummy character from the party.
     4 - Load the dummy character back in.
     5 - Transfer the items to other members.
     6 - Drop the dummy character from the party.
     7 - Repeat steps 4-6 as many times as needed.
     This also works for Curse of the Azure Bonds and Champions of Krynn.

POWER DRIFT:

Select any couse except D and win all the races (you must win them to get
a gold medal-finishing in the top 3 is -not- good enuff!) Collect all
the gold medals and you enter a bonus round on a secret couse with you
in control of the F-14 Tomcat from Afterburner! with no collsion
detection. Do the same thing on couse D and collect all the gold medals
and this time you will be in control of the Super Hang-On bike!
_________________________________________________________________________

POWERMONGER

Instruct your captain to invent something, pause the game, put the game
speed up to full, and wait a couple of minutes. Now unpause the game, the
captain will have kept inventing during the pause!

When you wish to invent in double quick time, click Invent and when your
men leave, click on it again. This often makes a catapult immediately.
This cheat works only once on each island.

QUADRALIEN (Logotron/Spinnaker):
 
Access codes:  level 1- 170961, level 2- 010655, level 3- 610169.  And now,
some tips:  once in the core, you can't quit.  So choose droids with good
lasers, Jack and Spud for example.  The Quadralien mother is made up of 4
separate pieces grouped together and surrounded by Earthling boxes.  The
mother can only be destroyed by blowing up each box from a different
direction.  From the starting point there are three exits:  north, east, and
west.  Go east and destroy the first box, return to the starting point, and
go north to destroy the second box.  You will now have both droids to blow
the remaining boxes.  Go west through the one-way force field, and get the
other.  Don't forget to keep recharging.
___________________________________________________________________________

R-TYPE

Enter SUMITA on the high score table for unlimited lives.
NOTE: The One Magazine says it is SUMITA. (with period)

(2nd cheat)

Load the game; when you get the "insert disk 2 and press space" prompt,
press HELP and type ME, then press the up arrow (between INSERT and CLR
HOME).  Now insert disk 2 and press space.  While playing the game, you can
become impervious to collisions (F5), impervious to enemy fire (F6), get
infinite credits (F7), and put the orb in the control of a second player with
a stick plugged in the mouse port (F8).  Neat!
___________________________________________________________________________

R-TYPE II

To become invincible, press the Pause key (P), hold down the left mouse
button and hit F1. The border will turn green and you can't be killed.
___________________________________________________________________

RAINBOW ISLANDS

We all know that collecting the seven different-colored gems gives you an
extra life and a 100,000 Bonus Gem once the Boss is defeated.
But collecting all of the gems in the correct order of color (from left to
right on the gem counter) not only awrds you the life and Bonus Gem, it also
grants you access to a magical secret room. When you reach the end of the
level, a silver door appears. `You don't have to fight the Boss. (Hint A)

Even more useful is how to create any color gem. The screen is split into
several invisible vertical stripes of color. When a gem falls, its color is
determined by the `color' of the area into which it fell. Now all you have to
do is guage carefully where the dead enemy will fall to create the gem color
of your choice. (Hint B )

Type the following codes while the title screen is displayed

  BLRBJSBJ  awards permanent fast shoes
  RJSBJSBR  awards permanent double rainbows
  SSSLLRRS  awards permanent fast rainbows
  BJBJBJRS  Hint `A'
  LJLSLBLS  Hint `B'
  LBSJRLJL  Contine after Island Five
  RRLLBBJS  All hidden food becomes money
  RRRRSBSJ  Does both of the previous two
  SRBJSLSB  Gives you a 100 Million Points Counter

RAMBO III

Get on the high-score list and type RENEGADE.  Pressing 1,2 and 3 will drop
you on the level of your choice.  And now for some tips:
     1) When inside the 2nd building, wear your IR goggles. 
     2) Don't walk in front of soldiers, since it will trigger an
        alarm and about 8 soldiers will jump you! 
     3) If you enter a dark room, use the glow tube. 
     4) Never use a gun without a silencer. 
     5) Turn off the electric door with switch located several
        rooms away. 
     6) The mine detector won't work without the generator. 
     7) The IR goggles won't work without a battery. 
     8) Watch out for IR beams, since they also trigger alarms. 
Here's a list of items you can find:  arrows, silencer, first aid kit, IR
goggles, glow tube, battery, key, mine, detector (in 2 pieces), pistol, ammo,
rubber gloves (you never know when you can be expected to perform major
surgery!!!)

Another tip allows you to get to level 33 (1 level after the last!)

Here's How: Find the special hole on level 1.  It's surrounded by 3 left
            pointing arrows.  Fall down the hole, and press the left mouse

being shoot below the gunner and move left and right until you are on
target. Gradually move up until you hit the Gondola. When you hit it
there is a flash, stop firing and after a few seconds you'll be inside
the Gondola.
        Find the supply of Lunarium before the Fort Knox supply runs
out, so infiltrate the Nazi base which recieves Lunarium from the
moon. It is in South America or Africa, once infiltrated, your agent
there will cary on sending you Lunarium throughout the game. You will
have to storm the Nazi base first.
        NOTE: In a different magazine it recommends you don't waste
time rescuing the professor, as you will be always too late. Instead
use the agents to find rocket factories, and uranium depots.

SHOCKWAVE
A few hints and tips follow on how each of the four zones (armys, factorys,
mines and rigs) effect the game:
MINES - Each time a mine is purchased the income you receive for each 'time
pass' doubles.
FACTORYS - The more factorys you have the faster more weapons are produced,
these are essential.
RIGS - These supply you with the fuel for each mission run. The more rigs
you have the greater the amount of fuel you receive for each 'time pass'.
ARMYS - For every army unit you own, the enemy slows down, eg. you have one
army unit, for each four 'time passes' that occur the enemy won't move for 
one 'time pass'.
If more than 50% of the sector is occupied by the enemy then you will lose
one of your assests for each 'time pass' rhat occurs. The best solution is 
when 30% of the sector is occupied go an attack the enemy.

SIM CITY

Hold SHIFT and type 'FUND' for $10,000.  It will cause an earthquake every
tenth time you do it, so do it before you start your city.

Another tip is to set the citizen's taxes to 0%.  Then just before tax
collection (December or November if playing at fast speed) quickly set the
taxes up to 20%.  Then after you collect taxes, put it back down to 0%.
This way the citizens think they are not paying any taxes.

You can build land on water. Find a straight (horizontal or vertical),
stretch of coastline and string a powerline along it. Next, move one
square over, out into the water and string another powerline parallel to
the first. Repeat as many times as you want. Then just
bulldoze all the excess powerlines and you can build on the new land.

To MAKE land you simply make a 3 lane highway across any water source.
When you make a road by putting 3 sections of road on top of three section
of road on top of three sections of road (3 by 3) you make 1 section of
land in the middle.                WWWWW   WWWWW     To make more land, just
                                   WRRRW   WRRRW     move you roads over, or
           L= land                 WRRRW = WRLRW     make your roads 4 by 4,
           W= water                WRRRW   WRRRW     5 by 5 etc.  Play with
           R= road                LLRRRLL LLRRRLLL   it.  It'll work.

WINGS (Cinemaware)

Basic stuff

Each letter of the word WINGS on the main menu does something.
To access them hold down the CTRL Shift and Alt keys on the left side of the
keyboard while holding down the right mouse button.  While holding down
these keys and button, you can click on each of the letters in wings with the
left mouse button.  Each letter does the following:
	"W" toggles the music on and off
	"I" turns the CAPS LOCK key into an autofire button
	"N" no flight school missions required for new pilots
	"G" Guess
	"S" Saves game without having to exit

To access the other cheats you must go to flight school.

To get an awesome pilot (once only) click on the bullseye on the airplane
at the top of the flight school menu.  The screen will either flash or you 
will get a requester asking if you want to quit (say no).  Then create a
new pilot.  Enter the name "Orca The Killer Tomato" (without the quotes, and
remember it's case sensitive).  Orca is all ready and doesn't need flight
school.

To access a menu of options (much of which is no longer useful or active)
create a new pilot.  Enter the name "  Who is The Riddler"  Leave off the
quotes but be sure and type the two leading spaces.  DO NOT HIT RETURN to
enter the name, hit ESCape instead.  Then just follow the prompts. 
	
If you run from a hard disk you can hit LEFT-AMIGA ESCape to toggle to the
Workbench screen and back.

Game Tips:

BALLOON BUSTING- The first thing to do in Balloon Busting missions 
is to take out the AA gun. It isn't too hard so give it a try.

DOG FIGHTS- When involved in a dog fight with other planes always
attack from above. This is because if you attack from below the other
plane will climb which is very annoying. By attacking from above you
drive the other plane down rather than up. 

BEING TAILED- When you are being tailed hold the joystick to the 
bottom-right. You should turn off to the right and out of the other
planes line of fire.

Get a high score and enter 'ALF' for your name.  Now you will have unlimited
lives.
        If you manage to reach level 10, you're better off using your
radar to kill the xybots. Just line them up using radar and fire, you
don't have to be able to see them.
        Keep as many keys with you as possible because some levels
don't have enough to complete them.
        There are short cuts to level seven on levels one and four -
you get extra cash for using them.
        If you have the extra energy upgrade try not to let your
energy fall below 100m, because you lose the upgrade if it does.
        Drums are not just decorations - hide behind them when
possible and use your zapper near to them to find more cannon power
        On level eight, near to the top left hand transporter you can get
to two white coins by blasting away one of the three walls around them.
        Don't split up in the two-player game, because it's easier to
complete it together.
        The master xybot lives on level 11, and you'll need to stock up
on double shot and extra shot speed to stand a chance of survival.
        Try to get one xybot to stand behind another - they'll blow
each other apart.

ZANY GOLF

To get to the secret level, make it to the last level (energy).
There is a mouse hole where two eyes appear occasionally.  When the eyes
turn red, putt the ball into the hole to warp to the secret level,

ZOMBI (UBI Soft):

If you have seen Dawn Of The Dead, you already have a good idea on how to
solve most of the puzzles.  But here's some extra tips anyway: 1) To lock up
the mall to keep zombies from getting in, you need to park the trucks over
the entrances.  Get the key from the office on the 2nd floor and go to the
4th floor where the keys to the trucks are kept.  2) To keep the dead zombies
from coming to un-life, lock them up in the freezer in the basement.  3)
before you can go play in the basement, you need a source of light.  Get the
fuses and gloves from the 3rd floor and go to it!!
