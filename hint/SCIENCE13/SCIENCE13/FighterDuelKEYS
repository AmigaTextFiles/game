                    Slow Down (Beware Not To Crash!)

The rest needs no explanation for you just have to try to blow up your
opponent in the sky.

Game Rating : 5/10
Rating Explanation : Even with neat graphic , the game is very boring.
                     The plane is hard to control and it's very easy
                     to crash. Also you won't learn the game in only
                     one try. I recommend MiG-29 Fulcrum or FLiGHT of
                     The Intruder Better.
