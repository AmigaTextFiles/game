                           THIS GAME IS... MURDER!
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  "Thank goodness you're here - something dreadful has happened!  One of
  the guests has been found - here in the house - and it looks like Murder!"

  Murder is the most appalling crime, and yet it exerts a fascination over
  all of us.  We all enjoy playing amateur sleuths, trying to spot the clues
  that point to the guilty party.  You may even think you're pretty good at
  it.  In US Gold's Murder, you get the chance to find out.

  A terrible murder has been committed by someone staying in the house.  The
  police have been called, but who knows if the murderer will still be here
  when they arrive?  Only you can unravel the threads of the dark deeds that
  have happened here.  The situation calls for a detective with vision, keen
  observation and a deep insight into the mind of a killer.  You have just
  two hours to expose the guilty party before the authorities arrive.


  CONTROLS
  ~~~~~~~~
  The mouse will control the movement of the cursor and your Sleuth.
  The left mouse button will function as the action/option button
  while the right mouse button will serve as the mode button.  Point
  to a doorway and press the left mouse button and the sleuth will go
  in that direction; point to an option icon and select it by pressing
  the left button - pressing the right button will clear the selection
  from the screen; the right button will also change the cursor into a
  magnifying glass.


  SELECTING A MURDER
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  US Gold's MURDER is cunningly contrived to present almost 3 million
  different cases for you to solve.  You select your murder from the
  next screen to appear:


         (Picture of Opening Screen with Newspaper Headlines)


  There are four variables you can change:

   1) The date of the newspaper
   2) The name of the house
   3) The type of house
   4) The difficulty level

  Each of these variables shape the events you will investigate.
  Leaving them identical to a previous game will result in the
  same crime being investigated.  There are four difficulty levels -
  Novice, Average, Experienced, or Super-Sleuth.  It's best to start
  off as a Novice for your first game, while you are getting used to
  the controls.

  You can even change the name and appearance of your detective.  Click
  on his nose, eyes, hair, etc to change his appearance; his name is
  altered automatically.

  To change one of the variables or the appearance of the detective,
  move the pencil cursor over the feature you wish to alter and press
  the left button.  Continue to press the left button to scroll through
  the list.  When you are ready to start playing, press the right button.


  SLEUTHING
  ~~~~~~~~~
  In general, the left button selects an option, and the right button
  either Quits, Returns to the Main Game Screen or toggles between Move
  and Examine.

  Your detective starts the game in the same room as the victim.  This is
  a good place as any to start your investigations.

  You can toggle between Move and Examine with the right button.  Move mode
  is indicated by arrows pointing towards the exits from the room.  Examine
  is indicated by the cursor being replaced with a magnifying glass.
  Equipped with the most important tool of your trade, you can begin to
  examine the evidence.


  INTERROGATION
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  To get information about a person or to examine and object, place the
  magnifying glass over the person or object in question and press the left
  mouse button.  The person or object will appear in the portrait in the
  upper right hand section of the screen.  Information about the person
  (along with the name of any item they are carrying) or object will be
  displayed below the portrait.

  (Manual shows pictures of things and what they represent as follows:)

          Picture Of:             = What it represents
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
          Man with letter A       = Person A
          Man with letter B       = Person B
          Cut-away view of a room = Room/location
          Bottle, rope and knife  = Object
          Man & Woman kissing     = Relationship
          Eraser                  = Erase Question
          Notepad and Pencil      = Make notes
          Dialogue bubble         = Ask question
          Up/Down arrows          = Scroll arrows

  After getting information about a person, you can interrogate them by
  aiming the cursor at the question mark icon in the upper-right hand
  corner of the screen and pressing the left mouse button.  You may then
  select the options at the top of the screen to build up questions.  To
  ask that person about the People, Places and Objects connected with the
  case, select the appropriate icon and press the left button and then
  select a name or object.  For information, point and click on the ask
  question icon.  For example, you can ask your suspect where they have
  been during the day of the crime; select Person A with the left button,
  and find your suspect's name on the list (you may need to use the scroll
  arrows to access different parts of the list.)  Click the left button
  on their name, and the question you are asking appears.  Now click on
  the Ask icon, and you will get that person's account of what is going
  on.

  To get more detailed information, you can link people, places and objects
  together.  For example, you might want to know when your suspect was in
  the room where the body was discovered.  Select the suspect's name from
  the Person A list, and the scene of the crime from the Places list.  The
  question now links them together.  Click on Ask to find out if your
  suspicions are confirmed...

  You can also add to your Question by checking out how People felt about
  eachother.  Select a name from the Person A list, and another from
  Person B.  Now click on the Relationship icon.  You can build up a
  profile of who loves/hates who, and who might have a motive for Murder...

  Use the Erase/Clear icon to clear all the names, places etc from
  question you are building.

  Useful answers can be recorded by clicking on the Make Notes icon; this
  will store the information in your notebook.  Suspects will only volunteer
  information once.  On, and before we forget, the Murderer will not offer
  information which incriminates them... you must trap them through the
  information you gather from the others.  (Note: to cancel actions, simply
  press the right mouse button.)


  OTHER EVIDENCE
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  More clues can be gathered from the many Objects you can find in this
  game.  If you Examine and Object, a picture appears in the portrait frame
  to the right of the screen.  It can then be examined for fingerprints by
  clicking on the Take Fingerprints icon.  Not every Object can provide
  fingerprints - some are porous, or impossible to examine - and some
  fingerprints can be smudged.  However, if you get a good print, you
  can record it by clicking on one of the storage cells which will appear
  (point to an empty cell and press the left button).

  Then, to provide proof for your suspicions, you need a print from your
  suspect(s).  When you have an Object in the frame, click on the Wipe
  Clean icon, then wait for someone to pick it up.  When they put the
  Object down again, you can check it to obtain their prints.

  To compare prints you have taken from two different places, select
  Compare Fingerprints.  Click on the large box A, then one of the
  storage cells; then click on box B and select a cell containing a print
  you want to compare.  Do they look similar?  Could be you've just
  found a vital clue...

  If you think you have found the murder weapon, you should pick it up
  by using the Take Exhibit icon.  If you were already carrying an object,
  it is swapped for the new one.  The murder weapon is essential evidence
  if you are to make a successful prosecution (you cannot accuse a suspect
  if you do not have the murder weapon).


  MOVING AROUND
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Clicking the right button toggles you between Examine and Movement.  To
  move around the house, use your mouse to select the exit you wish to
  use, then hit your left button.  You can see a plan of the floor you
  are on by placing the pencil cursor over the Map icon and hitting the
  left button.


  KEEPING TABS
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Select the Notebook icon with the left button to go over the facts so
  far.  You can review the evidence through several categories - People,
  Places, Clues and Motive, by clicking on your choice with the left mouse
  button.  All the information is comprehensively cross-referenced.

  Use your own notes as well, but the Notebook is a complete guide to the
  way your case is building.  Who was seen with whom; who's fingerprints
  were all over the revolver; who might have a reason for MURDER...


  J'ACCUSE
  ~~~~~~~~
  When you have pieced together all of the evidence, and you think you
  have established a motive, discovered the murder weapon and taken a
  fine set of prints, it's time to hunt down the felon.  When you find
  your suspect, click left button to put them in the Frame and then
  press the left button again over the Arrest icon to slap on the cuffs.
  If you're right, the papers will be full of your incredible exploits.
  If you're wrong, you had better find a good lawyer who can get you off
  a wrongful arrest rap...
