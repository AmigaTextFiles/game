S 
K      H.A.l./Horizontal Attitude Indicator
I 
D This is simply a horizontal gauge which displays "tick marks" on a line
  which are used to visually indicate when your weapon system is turning to
R maintain a bearing on a target. The space between each "tick" on the scale
O represents 10 degrees of bearing.
W 
       Current Target I.D.
S 
K The I.D. number of the currently selected target is displayed on both the
I left and right ends of the bottom of the Targeting Scope. The target can be
D an enemy ship, and FW ship, or an outpost.
  
R The I.D. displayed here will be identical to that displayed alongside the
O Current Target Switch (see Target A-D below).
W 
       Acquisition Indicator
S 
K When the currently selected target (see Target A-D, below) is at the center
I of the Targeting Scope and the Target Position (T:) and WeapSys Bearing
D (B:) readouts match, this flashing indicator bar will appear at the bottom
  of the Targeting Scope, between the Current Target I.D. Readouts.
R 
O The bar contains cycling colored "blips" (no cycling in CGA) and an
W "ACQUISITION" message. When this bar is present, your targeting system has
  achieved a lock on the current target, and you may fire your weapons (see
S Weap Set below).
K 
I If you fire when the Acquisition Indicator is not present you will probably
D not hit your target as EBWs will be fired at nothing and missiles have no
  targets specified.
R 
O 
W TARGETS A-D
  
S This section consists of four action buttons, A, B, C, and D, (keyboard
K users simply press the indicated letters) which represent target "slots". 
I Each slot can contain the I.D. of a given ship or outpost, identified by
D the small readout at the right edge of each button. The current target is
  selected by and whichever button is highlighted. Therefore, you can have
R four targets locked-in, one per slot, and switch back and forth between
O them as you like.
W 
  Whenever you highlight one of these buttons, the targeting system
S immediately swings around to get a lock on the specified item.
K 
I Most tactical actions and maneuvers are taken relative to whichever target
D is currently locked in. For instance, if you activated the POSIT function
  (see TACTIC section below), your ship would take up a position relative to
R the currently selected target. If you then changed from target A to target
O B, your ship would then attempt to take up a similar position relative to
W target B.
  
S To enter a target into one of the slots, highlight the selected button,
K make sure the desired target is displayed in the Target Selection Controls
I (see below), and then use the ACQUIRE button (below) to lock it in. The
D computer will automatically enter the I.D. for the specified target into
  the specified target slot.
R 
O 
W TARGET SELECTION CONTROLS
  
S These controls are used to select targets for the Target AD slots. A
K single-line scroller selector and related action buttons is used to pick
I and lock in targets.
D 
       OUT (U), ENS (E), and FWS (F)
R 
O These three action buttons are used to select what types of items will be
W displayed in the associated scroller selector. OUT selects outposts, ENS
  selects enemy ships (it is the default setting when you start the game),
S and FWS selects your own ships (you cannot select your own ship, however).
K Only one of the three buttons can be highlighted at any one time.
I 
D      ACQUIRE (Q)
  
R Activating this trigger action button causes the I.D. of the item currently
O displayed in the scroller selector to be locked into the currently
W highlighted "slot" (A-D), replacing whatever I.D. was already there, if
  any.
S 
K      (PageUp)
I 
D Scrolls the scroller selector back to the previous item in the current
  list, if any.
R 
O      (PageDown)
W 
  Scrolls the scroller selector to the next item in the current list, if any.
S 
K 
I I.D. READOUT AND SCROLLER SELECTOR
D 
  This is a standard scroller selector with a standard I.D. readout. The only
R difference between it and those seen on other panels is that this one
O displays only a single item at any given time. In essence, it simply
W displays only the highlighted item in the list, rather than the highlighted
  item and those immediately preceding and following it.
S 
K AUTO (T)
I 
D This is a toggle action button. When activated, it causes your ship's
  computer to automatically switch to the closest of the targets currently in
R the Target A-D slots. For example, if you had targets in all four slots,
O had target A selected, but target C was the closest to you, when you
W activated AUTO the highlighted target button would automatically be changed
  from A to C. If, while AUTO was activated, another of the selected targets
S were to become the closest in range, the selected target would again
K change.  Toggling AUTO off (unhighlighted) switches this mode off, and the
I system will no longer automatically lock onto the closest of the locked in
D targets.
  
R Manually activating one of the Target A-D buttons deactivates the AUTO
O mode.
W 
  WEAP SET
S 
K These controls are related to firing of your ship's weapons and adjusting
I their settings.
D 
  There are two "modes" to this subpanel, set by use of the GET (G) button at
R the top of the controls.  When GET is not highlighted, the TACTICAL MAP
O (see below) is displayed to the right, and only the fire buttons, EBW power
W meter, and missile selector buttons and readouts are accessible. But, when
  GET is activated, the TACTICAL MAP disappears, revealing the full set of
S weaponry controls, including EBW beam-width and pinpoint targeting
K controls; full missile selector buttons are displayed, with missile labels
I fully visible.
D 
  FIRE EBW (F9)
R 
O This is a trigger type action button which, when activated, fires the
W Enhanced Beam Weapons at the current target. The beam travels at 1 c
  (lightspeed) and has a maximum strike range of 3 million (3,000,000,000)
S kilometers (although your chances of hitting a moving target at ranges
K greater than 550,000 kilometers are slim). The force of the beam is
I determined by the EBW CHARGE METER and the EBW POWER SELECT controls (see
D following items).
  
R EBW CHARGE METER
O 
W This meter shows the charge status of the EBW batteries. If the meter's bar
  is full then 100% power is available. If the bar is partially full, then
S lesser percentages are available. The system recharges at a steady rate
K (variable depending on a given ship's equipment and damage the system has
I sustained), so if you wait, the power climbs.
D 
  EBW POWER SELECT
R 
O The actual percentage of potential EBW "hit" power your wish to use is
W selected with these controls. The position of the arrowhead pointer along
  the EBW CHARGE METER sets the percentage of EBW power you wish to apply
S when firing. The numerical value of this strength is displayed in the
K small readout immediately below the EBW CHARGE METER.
I 
D The arrowhead may be moved in one of two ways.  Players with compatible
  mice can simply drag the arrowhead along the scale, releasing it when it is
R where they wish it to be. Keyboard users can use the Home and End keys to
O move the arrowhead along the scale to the left and right respectively. As
W with most thermometer type scales, pressing Home or End switches on a
  "move pointer" mode which remains "on" until you press another key.
S 
K In some circumstances you may find that the arrowhead cannot be moved to
I the top of the scale, or that during or after battle, that it has slipped
D down the scale and cannot be moved back up it. This is an indication that
  the weaponry system has sustained damage, and that the EBW beam projectors
R are incapable of firing at power levels greater than those the arrowhead
O can be moved to. In such a case, the only way to restore full EBW power is
W repair the weaponry system (see DAMAGE CONTROL under 304 DATA RETRIEVAL in
  this section on the manual and also the sections pertaining to system
S damage in " Part VI: Tactics").
K 
I FIRE MISSILE (F10)
D 
  This is a trigger action button, and activating it causes your weapons
R system to attempt to fire one missile of the currently selected type at the
O current target. If no missiles of the selected type are present, no missile
W will fire. Each time you press FIRE another missile launch is attempted. 
  Thus, if you have lots of missiles in stock, you can launch a veritable
S salvo at the selected target.
K 
I MISSILE INVENTORY READOUTS
D 
  These numbers appear to the right of the missile selection buttons-labels,
R and indicate the current stock of the indicated class of missile.  If the
O readout displays 00, then no missiles of the indicated type are present.
W 
  Missiles can be restocked by docking with outposts.  The more sophisticated
S the supply capabilities of an outpost, the greater range of missiles they
K supply. However, remember than not every ship can carry all types of
I missiles. The type of weaponry system a given ship carries determines the
D types and number of missiles the ship can carry.
  
R MISSILE SELECTION BUTTONS (MINI)
O 
W There are eight of these selection buttons, one for each type of missile. 
  Only one button can be highlighted at any given time, and which ever one is
S selected is the type of missile currently chosen for firing. To highlight a
K missile type, either click the mouse on the desired button or press the
I associated number (1 through 9) on your keyboard.
D 
  In this mode only a small portion of each button is visible. See MISSILE
R SELECTION BUTTONS (FULL) below for descriptions of each missile type.
O 
W EBW FOCUS SELECTORS
  
S There are three selection buttons here, only one of which can be active at
K any one time. The active button determines the beam-width/focus of your
I ship's EBW fire.
D 
  WIDE (W)  Spreads the beam widely, making it easier to hit evasive
R           targets. However, although your chance of achieving
O           a hit increases on wide beam setting, because the beam
W           is "fanned out" the hit strength is diminished.
  
S NORM (O)  Sets the beam to normal width.
K 
I PIN (N)   Sets the beam to pinpoint width. In this mode your odds
D           of hitting an evasive target drop, however, this is made
            up for in that you can pinpoint specific systems of the
R           target, and the power of the EBW will be directed against
O           that system alone (see PINPOINT FIRE SELECTOR below).
W 
  PINPOINT FIRE SELECTOR
S 
K If the EBW FOCUS is set to pinpoint fire, specific systems of the target
I can be singled out for EBW attack. This selector box allows you to specify
D which system to hit when using pinpoint fire. The box displays an image of
  the current target (if any), linked to selector buttons representing its
R six primary systems. Whichever of the system buttons is highlighted
O represents the subject of any pinpoint EBW fire.
W 
  Mouse users need only click on the label for the system they wish to
S target. Keyboard users can use the + and - keys to move the highlighter up
K and down the list.
I 
D      NOTE: The highlighted system in this box will not have any
             effect on EBW fire with normal or wide beam settings.
R 
O MISSILE SELECTION BUTTONS (FULL)
W 
  There are eight of these selection buttons, one for each type of missile. 
S Only one button can be highlighted at any given time, and which ever one is
K selected is the type of missile currently chosen for firing. To highlight a
I missile type, either click the mouse on the desired button or press the
D associated number (1 through 8) on your keyboard.
  
R In brief, the missile types are as follows:
O 
W   Button    Missile       Type              Purpose
    1         PN PRT SRB    Pritchard SRB     Damages shields
S   2         MELB FU8      Melbourne FU8     General damage
K   3         GIAPRLI FU9   Giaperelli FU9    General damage
I   4         FRA LAB FE    Franklin Lab FE   Anti-Personnel
D   5         WODEN FE      Woden FE          Anti-Personnel
    6         THIOD P/PD    Thiodyne P/PD     Damages drives

W 
  Details on missile types, their uses, range, etc., can be found in 
S Appendix IV.
K 
I 
D TACTICAL MAP
  
R This is a simplified and miniaturized version of the map display on 301
O NAVIGATION, and works identically to that map. The only differences are as
W follows:
  
S Only potential targets (enemy and FW ships, and outposts) can be displayed.
K 
I The map view is limited to your vessel's sensor range, with no telemetry
D from other ships or "mix" modes available.
  
R No course project mode.
O 
W EBW and missile fire and "hits" are displayed on the map.
  
S There are six buttons and one thermometer scale related to the map. They
K are as follows:
I 
D COMBAT ZONE (Z)   When activated this recalibrates the map radius controls
                    so that the maximum map radius is 500,000 kilometers
R                   instead of your ships' maximum sensor range, allowing for
O                   easier zoom adjustments in combat.
W 
  Any or all of the following three can be highlighted at any time.
S 
K OUT (O)           When highlighted, the map displays outposts.
I ENS (N)           When highlighted, the map displays enemy ships.
D FWS (W)           When highlighted, the map displays FW ships.
  
R Mouse users can, as on 301, move the mouse over the map, frame and area,
O and click the left button to zoom in and the right button to zoom out. They
W can also drag the arrowhead below the scale at the bottom of the map to
  adjust the view radius.
S 
K Keyboard users must adjust the zoom radius by using the + and - keys, which
I are equivalent to the increase and decrease map radius buttons bracketing
D the RADIUS: readout.
  
R See the section on 301 NAVIGATION for more details of working with map
O displays.
W 
  ATTITUDE SET
S 
K This subpanel consists of controls which allows you to set your desired
I attitude relative to a target when using one of the tactical maneuvering
D controls (see below).
  
R THE ANGLE DIAL
O 
W The position of the flagship icon at the perimeter of the dial represents a
  position, in degrees, set relative to a target vessel or outpost (the
S dial's center). The angle can be from 000 to 359 degrees.
K 
I The dial can represent two different things.  If you select the "shado"
D maneuver (see Tactic below), the top of the dial represents the "bow" or
  "front" of the target vessel, and the position of the ship icon at the rim
R of the dial represents your ship's desired position relative to the
O direction the target is facing. On the other hand, if you select the
W "position" (POSIT) maneuver, the top of the dial represents the top of the
  map, and the position of the ship icon at the rim of the dial represents
S your ship's desired position relative to the target's position in space,
K not relative to the target's heading.
I 
D The following is a breakdown of the elements of the Angle Dial.
  
R Desired Angle Readout
O 
W This displays the desired angle you want your ship to take in a shado or
  positioning maneuver. The value displayed here is determined by the
S position of the Desired Heading Cursor (see next item) on the outside of
K the Dial. When you set a new desired heading this readout will change
I instantly to reflect it. If MANUAL is activated, the Current Heading
D Readout (see above) will begin to change to match the desired heading as
  your ship takes up the new course.
R 
O Desired Angle Indicator (Flagship Icon)
W 
  This operates identically to the Desired Heading Indicator on the HELM
S portion of 301 NAVIGATION. The icon represents your current flagship, and
K its position around the dial is important, however, the way the icon itself
I is pointing (always up) is not of any concern.
D 
  The position of the icon on the outside of the dial indicates your desired
R angle in degrees. The actual numerical value of the heading is displayed
O in the Desired Angle Readout (see above).
W 
  There are two ways to change the desired angle: dragging the pointer with
S the mouse, or using the Turn Clockwise and Turn Counter-Clockwise controls
K (see below).
I 
D To drag the pointer, you must have a compatible mouse. Click the left mouse
  button on the pointer, and, while holding the button down, "drag" the
R pointer around the dial to the desired position. As you move the pointer,
O the Desired Angle Readout will change to reflect the new setting. When you
W release the mouse button, the pointer will stay where you left it.
  
S Turn Clockwise
K 
I This function is activated by the RIGHT button, and its purpose is to move
D the Desired Angle Indicator around the Heading Dial in a clockwise
  direction. When you activate the RIGHT button by clicking on it with the
R mouse, it stays "on" only as long as you hold the mouse button down. If
O using the keyboard, the button stays "on" and the icon moves clockwise
W until you press another key.
  
S Turn Counter-Clockwise
K 
I This function is activated by the LEFT button, and its purpose is to move
D the Desired Angle Indicator around the Heading Dial in a counter-clockwise
  direction. When you activate the LEFT button by clicking on it with the
R mouse, it stays "on" only as long as you hold the mouse button down. If
O using the keyboard, the button stays "on" and the icon moves
W counter-clockwise until you press another key.
  
S      NOTE: If neither the SHADO or POSIT buttons are activated (see
K            Tactic below), the settings in the ATTITUDE box won't have
I            any effect.
D 
  
R RANGE CONTROLS
O 
W This portion of the ATTITUDE box is where you can adjust your range for
  shado or positioning maneuvers. There are a number of items associated with
S setting the range.
K 
I Tactical Range Scale
D 
  This is a standard "thermometer" scale (see Part IV). It represents the
R potential tactical range of your vessel relative to a target. The scale
O represents ranges of between 0 (bottom of scale) and 500,000 (top of scale)
W kilometers. The position of the Desired Range Pointer alongside the scale
  determines range setting.
S 
K Desired Range Pointer
I 
D This pointer is similar to pointers on standard "thermometer" scales (see
  Part IV). Its position along the Velocity Range Scale determines the
R desired velocity you want your ship to use when under manual helm control.
O 
W There are two ways to change the desired velocity; dragging the pointer up
  and down the sale using a mouse, or using the Increase and Decrease
S Velocity buttons (see below).
K 
I To drag the pointer you must have a compatible a mouse. Click the left
D mouse button on the pointer, and, while holding the button down, "drag" the
  pointer up and down the scale to the desired position. When you release the
R mouse button, the pointer will stay where you left it and, if the MANUAL
O button is active, your ship will immediately begin making velocity
W adjustments. If in manual mode, you can see the velocity change happening
  by watching the Current Velocity Readout (see below).
S 
K Increase Range Button
I 
D This function is activated by the 9 button, and its purpose is to move the
  Desired Range Pointer up the Tactical Range Scale. When you activate the 9
R button by clicking on it with the mouse, it stays "on" only as long as you
O hold the mouse button down. If using the keyboard, the button stays "on"
W and the pointer attempts to move up the meter until you press another key.
  
S Decrease Range Button
K 
I This function is activated by the 0 button, and its purpose is to move the
D Desired Range Pointer down the Tactical Range Scale. When you activate the
  0 button by clicking on it with the mouse, it stays "on" only as long as
R you hold the mouse button down. If using the keyboard, the button stays
O "on" and the pointer attempts to move down the meter until you press
W another key.
  
S Desired Range Readout
K 
I This readout displays the numeric value of your ship's desired range.
D 
  
R FACE SHIELDS
O 
W This final section of ATTITUDE allows you to specify which of your ship's
  four shields you wish to try to keep towards the current target. This is
S very useful, particularly when some of your ship's shields have been
K seriously depleted or destroyed (see DEFENSE SUBSYSTEM below), and you wish
I to keep your strongest defenses towards the enemy.
D 
  The arrow pointing towards the word TARG indicates the direction of the
R target, and the number below the arrow indicates which shield you wish
O to keep towards that target. The default is shield 1, the bow shield, but
W you may, by using the next shield and previous shield buttons, the UP and
  DOWN keys, turn any shield towards the target.
S 
K As with all of the setting under ATTITUDE this is only a "desired" shield
I facing. As your ship manuevers to maintain position, course, etc., it is
D not always possible to keep a particular shield oriented towards the
  target.
R 
O TACTIC
W 
  At any given time there are seven action buttons in this bank. Six are
S consistently present, and the seventh varies depending on the current
K target and its status. Each of the following, when activated, will remain
I active until another button in the bank is activated, or when navigational
D control is usurped via the 301 NAVIGATION panel. Only one of the buttons
  can be active at any one time.
R 
O SHADO (H)   Initiates a "shadowing" maneuver, where your ship will
W             attempt to take up the range and position set in the
              Attitude Set subpanel relative to the current target. The
S             angle will be set relative to the targets bow, which
K             always represents 0 (zero) to the shado mode. Therefore,
I             if the ANGLE is set at 180, your ship will constantly
D             attempt to remain behind the target no matter which
              way it faces on the map. Because your ship must try
R             to maintain an angle relative to potentially turning and
O             moving targets, it is much more difficult to achieve and
W             maintain target acquisition in SHADO mode than it is in
              POSIT mode (see below).
S 
K POSIT (I)   Initiates a "positioning" maneuver, where your ship will
I             attempt to take up the range and position set in the
D             Attitude Set subpanel relative to the current target. The
              angle will be set relative to the map, where "up" always
R             represents 0 (zero) to the position mode. Therefore, if
O             the ANGLE is set at 180, your ship will constantly
W             attempt to remain "due south" of the target on the map.
  
S ESCAP (P)   Initiates an "emergency escape maneuver" in which
K             your ship determines the heading of the current target
I             and immediately thrusts at full power in the opposite
D             direction (180 degrees different from the target) in an
              attempt to reach and maintain a "safe" distance from
R             the target: 900,000 kilometers or greater.
O 
W HALT (L)    Causes your ship to immediately perform a full power
              breaking manuever, coming to a complete halt relative
S             to the current solar system.
K 
I EVADE (V)   Initiates an evasive action sequence. In such a mode,
D             your ship proceeds at high thrust and randomly changes
              course every few seconds. This manuever is used to
R             shake missile fire or try to avoid having enemy ships
O             get and keep you in their gunsights.
W 
  BOARD (R)   This button appears if the target is an enemy ship,
S             enemy outpost or a Neutral outpost that has refused
K             you permission to dock.
I 
D DOCK (K)    This button appears in the place of BOARD if the
              current target is a friendly or neutral outpost, or an
R             outpost that has been seized by FW forces. Activating
O             it when your ship is under 1,000 kilometers range from
W             the outpost causes you ship to halt and a docking
              sequence to be initiated (see Docking Control below).
S 
K      (Y)    This button, when highlighted, hands navigational controls
I             back to the 301 NAVIGATION panel, in whichever mode it was
D             last set prior to been overridden by the TACTIC maneuvers.

  This subpanel provides control over both your ship's primary defensive
S systems, and information on hits taken and the status of your shields.
K 
I 
D MISSILE DEFENSE CONTROLS/AMCM
  
R There are two Anti-Missile CounterMeasure (AMCM) options available, JAM (J)
O and BEAM (M). Both can be active at the same time, if you wish.
W 
  JAM uses special transmitters to confuse the guidance systems of incoming
S missiles. When a missile falls within the "sphere of influence of the
K jammer, it should lose track of the target (you), and will most likely pass
I by without exploding. When the missile clears the jamming range, it may
D very well double-back and try again and again until it either gets lucky
  and hits you or runs out of fuel.
R 
O The one drawback to having jamming on is that the energy used for it is
W tapped from the shield generators, and thus the regeneration/recharge rate
  of the shields is lowered, meaning it takes hit shields longer than normal
S to build back up.
K 
I BEAM, on the other hand, bleeds power from your EBW charging system for use
D by automated defensive EBW batteries which attempt to shoot-down incoming
  missiles. The BEAM mode's primary disadvantage in combat is that it
R prevents your main EBW system from recharging as quickly as normal,
O hindering your combat firepower.
W 
  LAST ATTACK READOUT
S 
K This readout displays information about the last attack on your ship. At
I the top, a value readout displays the I.D. of the last ship that fired on
D you and got a "hit". Below that a text display explains what happened, such
  as informing you that your ship was:
R 
O      HIT BY EBW
W      NORMAL.
       ON SHIELD 1
S 
K The example tells you that the enemy hit shield number 1 with a normal
I width EBW beam. Likewise, if your are hit by a missile, the enemy missile
D type number (see Appendix IV) is displayed along with the number of the
  shield hit. If you are hit with the shields down, or hit on an inoperative
R shield, the message will be similar, but instead of saying "ON SHIELD n" it
O will say "THRU SHIELD n", indicating which shield location the fire passed
W through.
  
S SHIELD STATUS DISPLAY
K 
I This display contains a symbol of your flagship. If the shields are on
D (raised), a green "bubble" will encircle the ship. There are actually four
  shields, each composing one quarter of the defensive sphere. The number of
R each shield is displayed next to its quarter of the bubble.
O 
W When your ship takes a hit with the shields up, the impact is shown on the
  affected shield and that shield flashes (a corresponding power loss is
S reflected on the shield strength meters; see below).
K 
I If any of the four shields are completely depleted of energy, the section
D of the bubble representing it will disappear until such time as it can
  regenerate/rebuild power (see the SHIELD STRENGTH METERS below).
R 
O SHIELD CONTROL
W 
  This action button toggles the shields on and off. When the button is
S highlighted, the shields will be raised (if the shield system is
K functional).  If the button is magenta/unhighlighted, the shields are off.
I 
D Always make certain that your ship's shields are raised prior to engaging
  an enemy vessel. The same "hit" on identical shielded and unshielded ships
R will have drastically different results, with the unshielded ship
O sustaining far more damage than the shielded one.
W 
  In beginner level games, the shields are raised automatically when you are
S fired upon.
K 
I SHIELD STRENGTH METERS
D 
  There are four numbered meters here, each linked to a specific shield. The
R meters represent the strength of a given shield. Whenever a shield takes a
O "hit", the height of that shields' meter drops, and there is a
W corresponding loss of power, which takes time to build back up. Weak
  shields are less effective at preventing damage than strong shields, so
S it's a wise idea to keep your eyes on these indicators and try to keep the
K strongest shields towards the enemy (see FACE SHIELDS above).
I 
D DESTRUCT
  
R If your ship sustains so much damage that it cannot move or complete its
O mission, or if it is about to be destroyed by hostile ships, you can "take
W yourself out" of the game by self-destructing your flagship.
  
S To use the self-destruct you must be on the 303 TACTICAL panel and the GET
K (G) button at the top of the panel must be highlighted, thus providing
I access to the full weaponry settings and, of course, the DESTRUCT subpanel.
D 
  There is but one button on this subpanel, an action button labeled EXECUTE
R (X). If you activate it, a usurper box asking "Are you sure you want to
O activate the self-destruct * system?" appears. If you answer affirmatively,
W the usurper disappears and the surface of the CCSI panel will slowly slide
  open, revealing the self-destruct controls.
S 
K Operation is extremely simple, but not one-step. To activate the destruct
I sequence you must press/highlight all four numbered buttons at the top-left
D of the destruct controls (1,2,3, and 4). The striped panel will then pop
  open, and if you click on the PULL (P) tag hanging from the arming level,
R the lever will be thrown and a 15 second countdown will start.
O 
W To halt the destruct sequence, use the ABORT (A) button at any time prior
  to the destruct sequence countdown reaching 5 seconds.
S 
K 5 seconds is critical, because the destruct system works by creating a
I feedback loop in the drive and power systems of your ship. It takes ten
D seconds for this power feedback to reach critical level, and, once this
  level has been achieved, the imminent explosion cannot be aborted.
R 
O When a starship self-destructs, the energy released will destroy any ships
W within 4 million kilometers range, and those between 4 and 100 million
  kilometers risk damage ranging from minor to critical. If you time your
S destruction just right, you might take some of the enemy ships out with
K you. Just watch out for your own ships!
I 
D DOCKING CONTROL
  
R When you successfully dock with an outpost (see DOCK under Tactic above),
O the ATTITUDE subpanel is replaced by a docking status display: DOCK.  When
W docked with an outpost, the outpost's technicians will attempt to repair
  whatever system you have highlighted under REPAIR and restock any missiles
S that your ship is capable of carrying that the outpost carries.
K 
I 
D There are only a handful of controls on this subpanel. To the left are six
  selection buttons, each representing one of your ship's primary systems.
R The highlighted item is the one the outpost's technicians will attempt to
O help you repair. To change systems, click on the appropriate button or use
W the UP and DOWN buttons to move the highlighter from system to system.
  
S When you are ready to disengage from the docking maneuver, use the UNDOCK
K (K) button.
I 
D The repair and resupply sophistication of the outpost are displayed below
  the OUTPOST visual. The higher the numbers, the more sophisticated the
R outpost is.
O 
W To the lower right end of the DOCK box are two STATUS readouts. The
  readouts to the right of the repair sophistication value tells you the
S status of repair on the currently highlighted system and the status of
K missile resupply. The readout for repair will be one of the following.
I 
D   UNDERWAY  Repairs are in progress
    COMPLETE  The system was undamaged or repairs completed
R   TOO SOPH  The system is too sophisticated for the outpost to work on
O 
W When one system is completely repaired, move the highlighter to another
  damaged system to have it repaired.
S 
K The STATUS readout for supply tells you when loading of missiles will be
I complete. The time readout there tells you the mission time when resupply
D will be finished. When the outpost has fully restocked your missiles to the
  best of its ability, a COMPLETE message appears.
R 
O While you are docked the tactical maneuvering controls and both fire
W buttons are disabled (because firing your weapons within docking range of
  an outpost is very dangerous). While the DOCK panel is present, you can
S switch targets, relock all target slots, adjust weapons settings, etc., but
K you cannot maneuver or fire.
I 
D If you switch to 301 NAVIGATION and set a course while docked with an
  outpost the docking is automatically aborted.
R 
O If you break off a docking manuever before repairs and resupply are
W completed, you may end up with unfinished repairs and only a percentage of
  the total number of missiles the outpost could have provided (if any).
S 
K Boarding / 401 SQUAD DEPLOYMENT
I 
D When you have knocked out an enemy ship's shields and drive systems and
  moved within 5000 kilometers range, you can board the ship. When you have
R knocked out an enemy or neutral outpost's shields and moved within 1000
O kilometers range, you can board the outpost.
W 
  If you have Breach 2, the IGS system may load and run that game, if an
S appropriate scenario has been linked. If Breach 2 is not installed, or no
K linked scenario is located, then panel 401 SQUAD DEPLOYMENT appears.
I 
D The SQUAD DEPLOYMENT panel reports on the boarding action status. It
  displays an image of a FWSF marine in full combat gear to the left, and an
R image of a member of the opposing forces to the right. The name of your
O Fleet Commander (now acting as a Squad Leader), and his/her squad-level
W statistics appear, as does the name of the enemy race/force and the rank of
  their Captain.  The higher the rank of the enemy Captain, the better
S leadership the enemy will have, and the tougher they will be to beat.
K 
I At the center of the display is a Systems Control meter, which shows how
D much of the enemy ship's systems you control and how much is controlled by
  the enemy. A horizontal marker indicates the level of control you must
R reach in order to be victorious. When the meter for FWSF reaches that
O marker, you have won control of the alien ship. As your meter increases the
W meter for your opponents decreases, and vice-versa.
  
S Under the image of the FWSF Marine and the enemy are a set of icons
K representing the forces in combat. The health of each is indicated by their
I color.  The more red that shows, the more seriously injured the combatant.
D When a combatant's status meter is entirely red, he/she is dead and the
  icon is removed.  On each side, one icon is separated from the rest. The
R separate figure on the FWSF side is the health of your Fleet
O Commander/Squad Leader. The separate figure on the enemy side is the enemy
W Captain. If the enemy Captain dies, his forces will be less organized and
  easier to beat. If your Fleet Commander dies the game ends.
S 
K You have no actual control over the boarding sequence.  What you must do is
I keep your eyes on the percentage of systems you control, and weigh the
D health of your squad against that of the enemy forces. If your squad is
  badly injured and the enemy is not, or if your Fleet Commander is in danger
R of dying, or if you cannot seem to make any progress in gaining control of
O the enemy ship's systems, it would probably be a good idea to abort the
W boarding. You can abort by using the WITHDRAW/UNDOCK (W) action button.
  
S 
K 304 DATA RETRIEVAL
I 
D Although every control panel on your flagship is a technically part of the
  computer access system, it is on DATA RETRIEVAL that you actually consult
R the computers directly for various types of information. This panel has
O eight different modes, each called up by one of the action buttons at
W screen right. When you first begin a mission you arrive initially on DATA
  RETRIEVAL in Fleet STAT mode (see below). Whenever you return to 304 from
S another panel, it reappears in the mode you last left it in.
K 
I The eight data modes are as follows, and are accessible by activating the
D indicated action buttons. The highlighted button indicates the current
  mode.
R 
O FLEET STAT (F)
W 
  Lists all FW ships (your ship, the flagship, is usually at the top of the
S list). You can see the stats for up to 16 ships at any one time. And, while
K its rare that you'll play missions with more than this number of ships, if
I more than that number are present, using the PageUp and PageDown buttons
D allow you to see all of them.
  
R This mode is designed to allow you to get a quick overview of your fleet.
O However, this information here is based upon status reports sent to your
W computer by each ship under your command, and those ships do not
  automatically report. Once the mission begins, if you want status reports
S you'll either have to periodically issue "REPORT STATUS" orders to certain
K or all ships, or activate the ALL SHIPS REP STAT... function, which orders
I each ship to send a status report once every minute (both accomplished via
D 302 COMMUNICATIONS).
  
R There are seven readout categories for each ship in FLEET STAT mode. They
O are:
W 
  SHIP
S 
K Lists, on small action buttons, the mission I.D. number of each vessel. One
I ship's I.D. will always be highlighted. This indicates which ship or
D Captain will be the default if you switch to SHIP STAT or FW CAPTAIN (see
  below). To move the highlighter, either click the mouse on another ship's
R I.D. number or activate the UP and DOWN keys to move the highlighter from
O button to button. If you return to FLEET STAT from SHIP STAT the
W highlighter will be on the ship last viewed in that mode. Likewise,
  returning to FLEET STAT from FW CAPTAIN causes the highlighter to be on the
S ship commander by the last Captain viewed in that mode.
K 
I TIME
D 
  Lists the time when the indicated ship last transmitted a status report to
R you.
O 
W HEADING
  
S Lists the heading/course of the indicated ship as of its last transmitted
K status report.
I 
D VELOCITY
  
R Lists the velocity of the indicated ship as of its last transmitted status
O report.
W 
  GROUP
S 
K If the indicated ship is a member of a Battle Group, the number of the
I Group (01 to 99) is displayed under this heading.  Group Leaders are
D indicated by highlighted (white) Group numbers.
  
R SYS DMG STAT
O 
W Lists the operational capacity for each ship's systems, from communications
  to weapons.
S 
K SHIP STATUS
I 
D Lists the action being undertaken by the indicated ship as of its last
  transmitted status report (i.e.- "HOLDING FOR ORDERS"). Your own ship's
R status will always read "FLAGSHIP".
O 
W SHIP STAT (S) 
  
S Allows you to review detailed information about each ship in your fleet,
K one at a time, and allows you to see their status.  The UP and DOWN buttons
I alongside the ship name (SHIP) allows you cycle through all ships.  When
D you enter this mode the default ship to be displayed is the ship whose I.D.
  is currently highlighted on FLEET STAT.
R 
O While much of the information displayed in this mode is identical to that
W displayed in Fleet STAT mode, there is additional data provided in SHIP
  STAT mode that is not displayed elsewhere. Remember, the information
S displayed in this mode is only as recent as the last update report. If the
K ship has not reported its status in a while (see SINCE UPDATE below), the
I information may not be accurate!
D 
  ID
R 
O Lists the mission I.D. number of the currently displayed vessel.
W 
  SHIP
S 
K Displays the full name of the currently displayed vessel.
I 
D SHIP STATUS
  
R There are five readouts under this heading. The first is the actual SHIP
O STATUS readout for the selected vessel, and lists the action being
W undertaken by the indicated ship as of its last transmitted status report
  (i.e.- "HOLDING FOR ORDERS"). If you are displaying information about your
S own ship, this readout displays "Flagship".
K 
I There are four additional readouts under this heading:
D 
  SINCE UPDATE
R 
O Lists the time, via a running "clock", that has passed since the indicated
W ship last transmitted a status report to you. If you are displaying
  information about your own ship, this readout displays a time of
S "00:00:00", since your ship doesn't bother sending status reports to
K itself.
I 
D HEADING
  
R Lists the heading/course of the indicated ship as of its last transmitted
O status report.
W 
  VELOCITY
S 
K Lists the velocity of the indicated ship as of its last transmitted status
I report.
D 
  GROUP
R 
O If the indicated ship is a member of a Battle Group, the number of the
W Group (G01 to G99) is displayed under this heading. Group Leaders are
  indicated by highlighted (white) Group numbers.
S 
K CREW
I 
D Displays the percentages of the currently selected ship's crew that are
  active, injured, or dead. The greater the number of injured and dead, the
R less likely a given ship will be able to deal with repairing damage.
O 
W MISSILE INVENTORY
  
S Lists how many of each type of missile the listed ship was carrying at the
K time of the last update. The numbers are listed to the left of the missile
I labels. Missiles in stock are displayed with green labels, and those
D exhausted/not carried have red labels (cyan and magenta in CGA).
  
R To the left side of the display is the indicated ship's technical data
O display, which lists parts, system damage, and ship type.
W 
  % OPERATIONAL
S 
K Lists the operational capacity for each of the selected ship's systems
I (labels are to the right), from communications to weapons.
D 
  PRT
R 
O This readout displays the part number for the indicated system of the
W currently selected ship. This information is provided so that you can size
  up the capabilities of your ships against enemy ships by comparing their
S system statistics. (The stats for ships and parts are listed in
K Appendix III.)
I 
D SYSTEM
  
R Labels the six primary systems of the selected ship.
O 
W At the bottom of this display is a diagram of the selected ship, displaying
  its physical form and identifying its class (Transport, Scout, Destroyer,
S Cruiser, Heavy Cruiser or Dreadnought).
K 
I DAMG CONT (D)
D 
  Brings up the DAMAGE CONTROL panel for your flagship (and only your
R flagship).  This lists the operational capacity of each system and allows
O you to distribute percentages of your total repair capacity to each
W system, allowing you to prioritize your repair efforts.
  
S As with SHIP STAT mode, the operational percentage and part number for each
K system is displayed.
I 
D Under REPAIR CREW DISTRIBUTION are a series of six "thermometer" type
  scales, each of which can potentially be set from 000% (extreme right) to
R 100% (extreme left). However, the only way to set any given meter to 100%
O is to set all others to 000%, this is because the sum total of the values
W of all six meters cannot exceed 100%. For example, if all six systems are
  set at 016%, there will be 4% left over (AVAILABLE), because 16% x 6 = 96%
S and 100% - 96% = 4%.
K 
I The AVAILABLE readout displays the total percentage of damage control
D personnel currently unassigned. If this value read 000% you'll have to
  lower one or more of the meters before you can add any personnel to a given
R system.
O 
W The default settings for this mode are for each system of your ship to have
  16% of the repair crews assigned to them, with 4% left available.
S 
K Operation of this panel is simple.  Mouse users need only to "drag" the
I arrowheads under each scale to set their values. Keyboard users use the +
D and - buttons/keys to move the arrowhead of the currently selected system
  left and right. The currently selected system is indicated by ifs label, a
R selection button, being highlighted. To change if, press the number (1 to
O 6) of the system you wish to adjust the percentage of.
W 
  Finally, at the bottom of the screen is an extremely large action button,
S the DISTRESS SIGNAL (F10). This is a switch type action button which, when
K activated, sends out a message requesting immediate assistance from other
I ships in your fleet. This is to be used only in the most dire of
D circumstances, or when you need help and your communications system is so
  severely damaged that you can't send orders.
R 
O FW CAPTAIN (C)
W 
  This gives you the docket for each Captain, allowing you to read his/her
S docket and see what he/she looks like.
K 
I When you enter this mode, the ship Captain of the ship I.D. currently
D highlighted on FLEET STAT, or the ship currently displayed in SHIP STAT, is
  the default Captain to be displayed. The + and - buttons above the image of
R the Captain can be used to cycle to different Captains.
O 
W      NOTE: Whichever Captain is currently displayed when you switch
             to another mode is the one whose ship will be selected when
S            you next go to FLEET STAT or SHIP STAT mode.
K 
I The docket is displayed immediately to the right of the Captain's picture.
D The message "-END OF FILE-" appears at the bottom of the docket. If you
  cannot see this message, then there is more of the docket to read. Use the
R PageUp and PageDown buttons to move through various "pages" of the docket.
O 
W ENEMY (E) 
  
S This provides you with the docket for the forces opposing you in the
K current mission, allowing you to read the docket on them and see an example
I of what they look like.
D 
  The docket is displayed to the right of the enemies' picture.  The message
R -END OF FILE-" appears at the bottom of the docket. If you cannot see this
O message, then there is more of the docket to read. Use the PageUp and
W PageDown buttons to move through various "pages" of the docket.
  
S BRIEFING (B)
K 
I This simply displays the mission briefing, which summarizes your mission
D objectives and often provides useful strategic and tactical information.
  
R OBJECTIVES (O)
O 
W Lists objectives which must be satisfied to successfully complete the
  mission. Those preceded by a checkmark have been met.
S 
K At the top of the panel is a MISSION TIME display which shows the ELAPSED
I mission time and the REMAINING time you have in which to meet all of the
D mission objectives. All objectives must be met before the remaining time
  elapses else the mission will fail.
R 
O      NOTE: If you are in a mission without a time limit, the readout
W            following REMAINING will read "NO LIMIT".
  
S Refer to Objectives in Part III of this manual for a complete description
K of each mission objective.
I 
D      NOTE: In some cases you may see what appear to be two mutually
             exclusive and conflicting orders in the same list of
R            objectives. For example, you might be instructed to capture
O            a particular enemy ship and neutralize 100% of the enemy
W            fleet. How can you do both? Well, "neutralizing" a ship can
             be accomplished by capturing it. In such a case, you should
S            interpret the orders as saying "capture this particular vessel
K            and eliminate all others as you see fit."
I 
D EVALUATE (V)
  
R Produces a computer evaluation of your mission performance thus far. It
O includes the following statistics:
W 
        - If your ship successfully completed the mission objectives
S       - Total elapsed mission time
K       - Number of FW ships which survived the operation
I       - Number of FW ships destroyed during the mission
D       - Number of surviving FW ships damaged at the mission end
        - Number of FW ships that surrendered
R       - Number of Enemy ships destroyed
O       - Number of Enemy ships captured
W       - Number of Enemy ships operational at the mission end
        - Number of Enemy outposts captured by FWSF marines
S       - Percentages of FW personnel surviving, killed and injured
K          during the mission
I       - Performance index/mission score
D 
  When a mission ends, successfully completed or not, a final mission
R evaluation is displayed.

W 
  
S                              PART VI: TACTICS
K 
I Knowing how to control your ship's systems is one thing, but understanding
D how to use those systems in tactical situations is something completely
  different. This section discusses various tactics and how they can be used
R in a mission.
O 
W MANEUVERS
  
S Maneuvering your flagship is relatively easy, since all computations are
K performed by the on-board computers. Maneuvering controls are located on
I the NAVIGATION (301) and TACTICAL (303) panels. The operation of these
D controls is described in "Part V: The Main Panels".
  
R      NOTE: The on-board computer is limited in its ability to alter
O            your ship's heading and velocity dependent on the type of
W            (and damage level) of your drive system. There will be
             situations where a target has a more powerful drive system,
S            effectively preventing you from being able to position your
K            ship where you want.
I 
D The following is a description of each maneuver and' its tactical and
  strategic value.
R 
O INTERCEPT (Panel 301, Button INTRCPT)
W 
  This maneuver will set the ship's autopilot to intercept an object or
S waypoint. The autopilot will adjust course and velocity so that the ship's
K velocity will be 0 upon interception. This is useful for approaching
I stationary targets such as planets and outposts. When targeting moving
D objects (such as enemy ships), the object will usually appear to move away
  upon being intercepted. This is due to the fact that your ship will be
R stopped upon intercept while the target object is still moving.
O 
W CHASE (Panel 301, Button CHASE)
  
S This maneuver is similar to intercept, but will approach the target object
K and hold at a range of 500,000 kilometers. If the target is moving, the
I autopilot will attempt to hold this distance directly behind the object.
D This, in effect, is chasing the object. This is useful for following an
  enemy ship just at the edge of weapons range.
R 
O SHADOW (Panel 303, Button SHADO)
W 
  This maneuver is similar to chase, but allows you to select the distance
S and bearing you want to be from the target.  Using the angle and range
K attitude controls on the TACTICAL panel (303), you can adjust these
I parameters.  For  instance, if you want to position off the starboard
D (right) side of the target, set the angle to 90.  To position directly in
  front of the target, set the angle to 0.
R 
O POSITION (Panel 303, Button POSIT)
W 
  The position maneuver is identical to shadow with the exception of how the
S angle setting is interpreted. Assuming that the angle is set to 180, shadow
K would try and keep your ship directly behind the target. Position would,
I however, try and keep your ship to the "south" of the target, regardless of
D the target's heading.  Refer to the adjacent figure for an example of
  shadowing and positioning.
R 
O ESCAPE (Panel 303, Button ESCAP)
W 
  The escape maneuver is used to put some distance between your flagship and
S the current target. Escape will attempt to move your ship to, and maintain,
K a safe distance (900,000 kilometers) from the target. The computer will
I adjust your beading so that, at the beginning of the maneuver, you are
D travelling in the opposite direction as the target. This will make the
  escape as quick as possible.  Remember that the ability to escape depends
R on your ship's drive being more powerful than that of the target.
O 
W HALT (Panel 303, Button HALT)
  
S Halt, the simplest maneuver, will simply stop your ship dead in space.  It
K automatically switches manual helm control on.
I 
D EVADE (Panel 303, Button EVADE)
  
R This maneuver will cause your ship to zig-zag at maximum acceleration in
O order to evade incoming EBW and missile fire. The usefulness of this
W maneuver depends on the strength of your drive system. A weak or damaged
  drive will not he able to out-maneuver the incoming fire.
S 
K DOCK (Panel 303, Button DOCK)
I 
D The dock button will appear when you have selected an FW outpost, neutral
  outpost, or enemy outpost that has been captured. You must be within 1,000
R kilometers of the target. Docking with an outpost will allow you to repair
O and resupply your ship.
W 
  BOARD (Panel 303, Button BOARD)
S 
K The board button will appear when you have selected an enemy outpost or
I enemy ship. You must be within 5,000 kilometers in order to board the
D target. You will need to board ships and outposts in order to capture them.
  
R Fire Control Techniques
O 
W Key to the successful completion of most missions is your ability to combat
  enemy ships and Outposts. The following are hints and suggestions you can
S use when engaging the enemy.
K 
I 1) Try to knock out critical enemy systems first.  The drives and
D    weapons system should be the primary targets. Knocking these out
     first will make the destruction of the other systems easier. Use the
R    appropriate missiles in addition to pinpoint EBW fire to target these
O    systems.
W 
  2) To make missile hits more damaging, lower your EBW power to
S    around 50% so that you can fire rapidly. Pinpoint the shields and hit
K    repeatedly. This will have the effect of weakening the shields,
I    making them less resistant to missile attacks.
D 
  3) Pinpoint fire works well only with ships that cannot outmaneuver
R    you. If you find maintaining a target lock is difficult, use the
O    normal beam width. If you still don't get enough hits, switch to wide
W    beam.
  
S 4) Choose your maneuvers based on the strength of your drive system
K    relative to that of the enemy. Some maneuvers, such as escape,
I    work only when you have the superior drive capability. To determine
D    the strength of the enemy drive, use your probe (from panel 301) to
     determine the class of ship you are fighting. Then refer to Appendix
R    III and look up the maximum velocity and acceleration for the drive
O    system that is used on that class of enemy ship. Compare these
W    values to the values for the drive on your ship (values for the parts
     can also be found in Appendix III). If you do not know which drive
S    system you have on board your ship, you can look up the part number
K    by using SHIP STAT on the Data Retrieval (304) Panel.
I 
D 5) Make frequent use of the facing control. Try to keep orienting the
     strongest shield towards the enemy. Remember, though, that the
R    autopilot may not always be able to orient that shield to your
O    liking.  Maneuvering the ship requires that the ship rotate in
W    various directions. The autopilot will, however, do its best. When in
     the Halt maneuver, the ship will not be under power so the autopilot
S    will always be able to orient the selected shield.
K 
I 6) When the enemy has the superior drive capability, you may be better
D    off to select the Halt maneuver. Otherwise, your ship may simply
     spin around trying to keep up with the enemy ship. This may prevent
R    you from being able to achieve a target acquisition to fire your
O    weapons.
W 
  Tactical Use of Asteroid Fields
S 
K Asteroid fields can be both a hindrance and a help. When a ship is within
I one, it risks being partially sensor-blinded by the numerous rocky objects
D surrounding it, which generate confusing "echoes" and distort hyperscanner
  field readings.  The denser the asteroid field, the less sensor visibility
R a ship within it is likely to have. Because of this, it's not a good idea
O to chase an enemy ship into a dense asteroid field, as it could evade you
W while in the field, or even emerge in clear space before you do, and have
  the advantage of being able to see - and target - you before you can see
S it.
K 
I On the other hand, there are several ways in which you can use asteroid
D fields to, your advantage.
  
R 1) Lure an enemy ship into approaching you by passing through an
O    asteroid field. If you see an enemy ship approaching you, and you are
W    near an asteroid field, set a course (using the manual helm control)
     that will allow you to "skim" the outside of the field on the side
S    opposite of the approaching enemy. Once the field is full between you
K    and the enemy, move towards the field until you are almost at its edge,
I    and then halt. If the enemy makes a beeline for you, he will pass right
D    through the asteroids and, if the field is sufficiently dense, will be
     unable to get a fix on you until he clears the field. Meanwhile, since
R    you're not in the midst of the rubble, you'll be able to see him
O    approaching and fire EBWs several times long before he can see you.
W    Your EBWs have a maximum "hit" range of 3 million kilometers, and,
     while in normal combat firing at targets over 550,000 kilometers away
S    is wasteful, in this circumstance it's worth trying. since the enemy
K    will probably be flying straight through the field, you have a greater
I    chance of getting a hit at extreme range.
D 
  2) Lead a pursuing enemy through a dense asteroid field. As with the
R    previous technique, if your drive is powerful enough, you'll clear the
O    other side of the field before your opponent does, and you can halt
W    your ship and nail the enemy a few times before he emerges and can lock
     onto you.
S 
K    To do this, go to Panel 301 and set the autopilot intercept the
I    desired asteroid field. Your ship will make directly for the center.
D    Once you are on course and at full speed, use the GET (G) function (see
     301 Navigation in Part V) to copy the current course and velocity into
R    the manual controls. Your ship will now fly into the asteroid field,
O    through its heart, and out the other side. Once you emerge on the far
W    side, you may, if the enemy has followed, be able to get a few shots in
     on him before he can lock onto you.
S 
K 3) Hide and seek. Large, dense asteroid fields are good places to "hide"
I    if you're in desperate need of a breather. If the center of the field
D    is so far "in" that an enemy's sensors cannot detect you from outside
     the field, you can sit tight and lick your wounds, somewhat safer than
R    normal from enemy attack. To do this, locate a very large, dense field
O    and intercept it. Your ship will stop at its center.
W 
  To check an asteroid field's density, probe it from the NAVIGATION panel
S (301). The higher the density, the more sensor problems it will cause.
K 
I Doubling Back Through an Asteroid Field
D 
  Another trick you can pull with a ship pursuing you through an asteroid
R field is to wait until you think the enemy is in the field with you and
O then suddenly change course. If the field is dense enough, the enemy
W ships(s) might miss your course change and lose track of you. Turning at a
  90 degree angle to your current heading is one course change you might try.
S 
K Damage Control and Outpost Repair/Resupply
I 
D Your ship's crew includes repair personnel capable of repairing any of the
  six systems on your ship. The crew cannot, however, repair a system that
R has been completely destroyed. A system is considered completely destroyed
O once its damage status reaches zero. At this point, the only place to
W repair the destroyed part is at an outpost.
  
S You distribute your repair crew to the six systems using the damage control
K panel (304). A specific percentage of the crew is allocated to each system
I using the slider controls. You may change the distribution at any time. You
D should distribute a higher percentage to the systems you deem most
  critical. Repair crews assigned to undamaged systems will sit idle until
R the part needs repair.  Each part on your ship has a sophistication level.
O The higher this number, the more sophisticated the part. Sophistication
W levels for your parts can be found in Appendix III. Your crew can repair a
  part of any level of sophistication, however the lower level parts will be
S repaired much more quickly than higher level ones. In addition, the more
K damage a part sustains, the longer it will take to repair.
I 
D Outposts can repair your parts even more quickly, but they are limited by
  their sophistication level, in which parts they can work with. By using a
R probe on the outpost, you can ascertain its repair level. This level is the
O maximum sophistication part that they can repair. Outposts can also repair
W destroyed parts.  Outposts are also your only source for resupply of
  missiles. Missiles, like system parts, have sophistication levels. Each
S outpost has a supply sophistication level.  This level means the outpost
K has missiles up to, but not beyond, that sophistication. The sophistication
I level of each missile type is listed in Appendix IV.
D 
  After docking with an outpost, a resupply procedure will automatically be
R initiated. The outpost will reload your ship with its maximum compliment of
O Missile up to the supply sophistication. Resupply of missiles takes 5
W minutes for free-floating, and 15 minutes for planetary based outposts.
  Resupply at the planetary based outposts take longer since it is necessary
S for them to launch a supply shuttle into orbit that will rendezvous with
K your ship.
I 
D Tactical Use of Self-Destruction
  
R Your flagship is armed with a detonation system that will destroy the ship
O on your command. This is useful should you encounter a no-win situation.
W Detonating your ship will initiate a blast that will instantly destroy any
  ships within 4 million kilometers range, and those between 4 and 100
S million kilometers risk damage ranging from minor to critical.
K 
I Although your Fleet Commander character will be killed, you may be able to
D complete the mission by using this tactic. For instance, if the only
  remaining victory condition is to destroy an enemy ship with which you are
R engaged in battle, the resulting explosion may destroy him for you.
O 
W Keep in mind that you can also order your other ships to self-destruct.
  Self-destruction is, however, the ultimate sacrifice a ship captain can
S make, so play close attention to whom you are making this request.  Check
K the docket available on 304) of the Captain first to see if he/she is
I likely to obey this order.
D 
  CAUTION!  Make certain that vital mission objectives are not within
R dangerous proximity of a ship about to self-destruct. For instance, if you
O intend to blow your own ship to atoms, try to get some distance between
W your ship and those you want spared. Likewise, you can order ships that are
  near a ship you wish to destruct to go somewhere "safe".
S 
K Surrender Tactics
I 
D Both enemy ships and Federated World ships may surrender to the opposing
  forces. Using the communications system, you can order any or all of your
R ships to surrender. You can also send a message to any enemy ship,
O surrendering your own flagship. Once the flagship has surrendered, the
W mission is lost. A surrender will in many cases be your only alternative to
  self-destruction or destruction at the hands of the enemy.
S 
K The enemy may or may not accept your surrender. That depends a large part
I on whom you are fighting. In addition, the enemy will be more susceptible
D to your ~surrendering if a large percentage of your feet has already
  surrendered. The enemy dossier may contain information you can use to
R determine how likely it is they will accept your surrender.
O 
W The enemy may also surrender to you or one of your fleet ships. You can
  also send messages to enemy ships requesting their surrender. Again, the
S personality of the enemy plays a large part in their likelihood of
K surrendering to you.
I 
D Forming Battle Groups
  
R In many missions you will have several objectives to meet. In some cases
O you may be required to tend to all of them quickly, and will find that
W there isn't time to lead your forces in all required actions. Naturally,
  you can order various ships to take care of certain tasks, but in
S situations where two or more ships may be required to meet a particular
K objective, it is sometimes best to form a Battle Group.
I 
D A Battle Group is a grouping of ships, the Captain of one of which you have
  assigned to act as the Group Leader. The Group Leader then has authority to
R give orders to other ships in the Group and instruct them in what to do.
O This is particularly handy in situations where there will be a significant
W communications delay between your flagship and other ships in your fleet.
  
S The best choice for a Group Leader is a ship whose Captain is loyal,
K experienced, stable and ingenious (amongst other things). The reasons? 
I First, disloyal Captains are more likely to surrender to hostile forces,
D Secondly, some Captains do not take orders well from captains with less
  experience than they themselves have, so the more experienced the Captain
R you selected as Group Leader is, the less likely he is to have problems
O with "renegade" or disobedient Captains under his command. Third, a stable,
W non-temperamental Captain is less likely to take rash action that could
  risk lives unnecessarily. In light of this, choosing Captains to act as
S Group Leaders is not a decision to take lightly, and choosing which ships
K to assign under that Group Leader is important as well, so read their
I dockets carefully (panel 304).
D 
       NOTE: The right Captains may not have the right ships for the job.
R            You also have to take into account the relative strengths of
O            the vessels commanded by those Captains you wish to assign to
W            Battle Groups.
  
S To form a Battle Group, go to COMMUNICATIONS (302) and send the order
K "FORM BATTLE GROUP" to the ship you have selected as a Group Leader (you
I cannot send it to ALL ships). If ACKNOWLEDGE is on, the Captain of that
D ship will acknowledge the order when (and if) he/she forms the group. If
  not, the next time the ship sends you a status report (send the order
R "REPORT STATUS" or activate the ALL SHIPS REP STAT TO button), its group
O status will be reported. The Group Leader must notify you that it has
W formed a group in one of these fashions before you can assign other ships
  to join that group.
S 
K      NOTE: A ship selected as a Group Leader will, on some readouts, have
I            its normal Ship I.D. replaced by a Group I.D. Thus, if you
D            assigned ship F07 to form the first Battle Group, its I.D.
             would be changed to G01.
R 
O Once the Group Leader has acknowledged the Group formation (you will
W receive the message "FORMING BATTLE GROUP Gn" (where n is the Group number;
  00-99). You can then send the order "JOIN BATTLE GROUP" to the ships you
S wish (if you send the order to ALL ships, all ships but your own and the
K selected Group Leader will join the Group).  Ships obeying the order will,
I if the ACKNOWLEDGE flag is on (see 302 Communications in Part V), respond
D "JOINING WITH GROUP G n".
  
R Deploying Battle Groups
O 
W Once a Battle Group has been formed, all you need to do to deploy it is to
  send an order to the Group Leader. If you order the Group Leader to destroy
S a particular enemy vessel, the entire Group will follow the order (as
K always, this depends on the Captain leading the Group and those under
I his/her command).
D 
  It is important to issue orders only to the Group Leader, because sending a
R specific order to a ship or ships within a Group will cause them to
O automatically disband from the Group ("REPORT STATUS" is the only order
W that you can send to a Battle Group "follower" that will not cause that
  ship to disband).
S 
K As you issue orders to the Group Leader, the ships led by it will, if
I ACKNOWLEDGE was on when you sent the last order to the Group Leader,
D "GROUPED WITH G n" to let you know they are following the actions of the
  Leader.
R 
O Disbanding Battle Groups
W 
  When you wish to break up a particular Battle Group, send the order
S "DISBAND FROM BATTLE GROUP" to the Group Leader.
K 
I To have individual ships leave a Battle Group without disbanding the entire
D Group, send the "DISBAND..." order to the specific ships you want to break
  free from the group, or send those ships specific orders to do other things
R (such as MANEUVER AT WILL", "DESTROY ENEMY SHIP", etc.).
O 
W You can break up all existing Battle Groups by issuing the "DISBAND..."
  order to ALL ships. This order will affect all Groups, but will not affect
S ships ordered to form with your flagship (see following section).
K 
I Forming with the Flagship
D 
  In addition to ordering a Captain to form a Battle Group and instructing
R ships to join that Group, you can order the ships under your command to
O form the equivalent of a Battle Group with your own ship acting as the
W Group Leader. Send the order "FORM WITH Flagship" to those ships you want
  to lead. If the Captains of those ships obey the order (as always, whether
S they do or not depends on their personalities), their ships will follow
K yours and do what you do.  If you set a specific course, they will follow
I it.
D 
       NOTE: This order does not form an "official" Battle Group, and your
R            flagship will not be assigned a G (Group) designator on the
O            map displays.
W 
  The "FORM WITH FLAGSHIP" order is really just an instruction for ships to
S follow you. If you attack an enemy ship while other ships are grouped with
K you, the Captains of those ships may not join the attack until you issue an
I attack order.
D 
  Hints On Keeping Your Battle Group Together
R 
O When a Battle Group is formed, the ships in it follow the lead of the Group
W Leader. The danger in such formations is that not all ships have the same
  maximum velocity. It is possible for the ship leading the Group to
S outdistance one or more of the Group members when moving towards a target.
K This is potentially dangerous, because it can lead to your forces being
I widely scattered, resulting in some ships of the Group encountering the
D enemy prior to others. If you intend to work from a strength-in-numbers
  posture, you do not want to spread your Battle Group out. The problem here
R is that the autopilot modes, such as chase and intercept (panel 301), set
O your ship on a full-power course for the selected target. Velocity in such
W modes is controlled by the ship's computer. Ideally, you want to set course
  for the target and then maintain a velocity which will allow even the
S slowest ships in your Battle Group to keep pace.
K 
I This need can be met through use of the manual helm control on the NAVIGA-
D TION (301) panel. Using the autopilot controls, you would set out to chase
  or intercept a given target. Once the desired heading has been set,
R activate the GET (G) button on the HELM subpanel, which switches to manual
O control while maintaining the heading and velocity set by the autopilot
W mode. After GET has copied these values into the manual helm control, you
  can make appropriate adjustments to your velocity to ensure that all of the
S ships formed with you can keep up. In this way you don't end up scattering
K your forces.
I 
D The drawback to this approach is that it doesn't work well on nearby
  fast-moving or distant moving targets, since, in manual mode, your ship
R does not automatically correct course to compensate for moving targets. To
O solve this logistical problem you will either need to manually adjust your
W heading, or switch back to an autopilot mode for a moment and then use GET
  again to pick up the new heading. In either case, you will want to do this
S periodically in order to avoid wasting a great deal of time.
K 
I Disbanding a Flagship Formation
D 
  As with any other Battle Group, ships that are formed with your flagship
R can be disbanded from your "group" by issuing other orders to those ships.
O Sending the order "DISBAND FROM BATTLE GROUP" to ships formed with your
W flagship is equivalent to a "MANEUVER AT WILL" order.
  
S Capturing Outposts
K 
I In some missions you my be required to capture one or more enemy outposts.
D Even if you are not compelled to take over such outposts, in some
  circumstances you may find it to your advantage to seize strategically
R placed enemy or neutral outposts. Enemy ships cannot get resupplied or
O repaired at outposts controlled by your forces, so it makes strategic sense
W to capture outposts your enemies could seek assistance from. Naturally, the
  enemy won't just sit still for this. They may very well try to capture such
S outposts themselves, or even go after established FW outposts to try to cut
K off your supply and repair lifeline.  If you have two or more outposts as
I potential "capture" targets, the one you pick to go after first should be
D determined by balancing which is of greatest value to the enemy
  (sophistication) against their positions relative to enemy ships.
R 
O HINT: If you have to choose between two nearby and similarly sophisticated
W outposts, one free-floating and the other planet-locked, capture the
  free-floating one first. It takes longer for ships to resupply at
S planet-locked outposts, so enemy ships who attempt to resupply their
K missiles while you're occupied won't get the jump on your forces as
I quickly.
D 
  Capturing an outpost is accomplished from the TACTICAL panel (304). You
R must knock out the outpost's shields and then board it. If the boarding
O action is successful, the outpost is yours. Following a successful outpost
W capture, your marines will repair the outpost's shields to hold off enemy
  ships. Likewise, if you abandon a capture attempt, the outpost personnel
S will themselves repair their shield systems.
K 
I Dealing With Non-Objective Enemy Ships
D 
  In some missions your orders may require you to capture or destroy specific
R enemy ships, etc.,that leave other enemy ships essentially "non-objective"
O items. In such circumstances, destroying such ships is a complete waste of
W time. Your only concern with such ships is the threat they pose to your
  ships and outposts. Therefore, the best way to eliminate such threats, if
S you get the chance, is to disable them. For example, if confronted by a
K non-objective ship that threatens your forces, concentrate your attack on
I knocking out the ship's drive system. If you completely destroy the ship's
D drive, it will be forever unable to maneuver and effectively "neutralized".
  You can therefore leave it for later.
R 
O Crippling Enemy Ships
W 
  In some cases, you may need to deal with some pressing problem (like
S assisting a ship or outpost in danger) while in the act of fighting an
K objective enemy vessel (one you must capture or destroy). In such cases a
I useful tactic is to attempt to cripple the ship in question in such a way
D that it is temporarily rendered "lame".  For example, if you severely
  damage the target's drive, chances are you might be able to go and take
R care of other business and return to finish the target before it can repair
O the damage or reach an outpost. Likewise, a ship threatening an outpost
W could be dealt with by damaging its weapons system. If it can't fire, it
  can't penetrate the outpost's defenses, and thus, the outpost is spared...
S for the time being. Also, if your attention is required elsewhere, you
K could cripple the current target, then order another ship to "finish" it
I while you go off about more urgent business.
D 
  Keeping an Enemy from Calling for Help
R 
O If you are in a system with at least one hot star (such as a class F, A, or
W B) and can ambush an enemy ship nearby such a star, the interference
  generated by the star will keep him (and, alas, you) from being able to
S call for help from his fellows.  To determine the type of a system's
K star(s), probe it from the NAVIGATION panel (301).  A small temperature
I scale appears alongside the star graphic, and the taller this scale is, the
D hotter the star. The hotter the star, the more communications interference
  it will cause. Also, the closer a ship is to star, the greater the
R interference, so catching an enemy nearby a cooler star may have the same
O effect as being farther from a hotter star.

                             PART VII: THE BUILDER
R 
O Overview
W 
  This section explains each and every panel in the builder sections of the
S game. Each panel's purpose and functioning is detailed. Screen buttons are
K listed in uppercase bold text, with the key equivalent listed, in
I parenthesis, immediately following the button text, as in: "...use BUTTON
D (B) to...
  
R Please note that many options will bring up alert messages, such as "are
O you sure you want to delete...", and the usurper boxes bearing these
W messages are not always noted in the text because, as a rule, what to do
  when one appears is fairly self-evident.
S 
K Each panel is listed by number and name. Operation of the controls on these
I panels are as described in Part IV, unless otherwise noted.
D 
  Operational Overview
R 
O There are five builder panels. The first four are used to create individual
W elements that can be used in many missions. The fifth builder panel is
  where elements created with the other four are assembled to create
S missions. To wit: you create FW Captains, then your create ships for the
K Captains, next you create an opponent/enemy, and then you create a solar
I system in which they will clash.  Finally, you assemble all the parts, set
D objectives, and you have a mission.  Access to each of the builder panels
  is via the 101 GAME/MISSION panel (see Part V of this manual for details).
R 
O The Upper Bar
W 
  Each of the 5 builder panels all share a common bar at the top of the
S screen. In addition to the current builder panel number and label, this bar
K always contains the following controls:
I 
D ADD (Fa)
  
R Activating this button will cause the current item being edited (be it a
O ship Captain, solar system, mission, etc.) to be saved as a new item.
W For instance, you would activate this button prior to using SAVE (below)
  if you have edited an existing item and want to save the changes (but
S retain the original).
K 
I SAVE (Fa)
D 
  This button will save the current item and exit the panel, returning you
R to the main panel (101).
O 
W CANCEL (Fa)
  
S This button will cancel any changes you have made and exit the panel
K without saving, returning you to the main panel (101).
I 
D NEW (Fa)
  
R This button will cause the settings of the selected builder panel to be
O reset to their default "create" settings. This allows-you to create a
W new item and begin editing it without having to exit to 101 and use the
  create function for that panel.
S 
K Since the item currently in the builder panel will be cleared when NEW is
I used, you will be allowed to first save any unsaved changes to the current
D item.
  
R 202 CAPTAINS
O 
W This section of the builder allows you to create, edit, and delete
  Federated Worlds ship Captains. This panel operates in two modes, one
S allowing you to edit the personality traits, the other allowing you to
K edit the dossier. Initially, this panel will be in the "traits" mode.
I 
D Just below the upper bar is a bar containing a text field for the Captain's
  name, a button for editing the name, and controls for switching between
R traits and dossier mode. These controls are as follows:
O 
W NAME (N)
  
S This is a toggle action button. When activated, a text editing frame and
K cursor appears, allowing you to enter/edit the Captain's name. (See Part IV
I for details on working with text editing fields.)
D 
  DOSSIER (D) and TRAITS (T)
R 
O Only one of these two buttons can be active at one time. In dossier mode,
W the lower portion of the screen is occupied by the Captain's dossier
  editor. In traits mode (the default), the lower portion of the screen is
S filled with the Captain's personality traits editor. Switching modes has no
K effect on anything entered or edited in either mode, so you can feel free
I to go back and forth between them without fear of losing your work.
D 
  TRAITS MODE
R 
O When the TRAITS button is highlighted, the lower portion of the screen is
W occupied by the PERSONALITY TRAITS editor. This consists of ten
  thermometer type scales, each used to set a particular trait (see Part IV
S for details on the operation of thermometer scales).
K 
I Each trait can range from 00 to 99, and the current setting is always
D displayed in the related value readouts to the left of the scales. To
  adjust a trait, simply move the arrowhead pointer below the selected
R scale. Moving the arrowhead to the right increases the value; moving it to
O the left decreases the value. The value changes while the arrowhead.
W 
  Keyboard users will note that the same buttons (- and +) are used for all
S ten scales, and might be confused as to how you pick which trait you wish
K to edit. The label for each trait is a selection button. The scale next to
I the currently highlighted label is the one the - and + buttons will affect.
D To change traits, simply press the indicated key to highlight the trait
  that you wish to edit. Mouse users will note that each time they click/drag
R an arrowhead, that arrowhead lights up, and the highlighted label changes
O to reflect the current trait being edited.
W 
  It is the combination of the values of each of these traits which determine
S the personality of a Captain. The ten traits are as follows and affect the
K indicated aspects of the Captain:
I 
D      AGGRESSIVENESS (A)
  
R The higher this factor, the less likely the Captain will accept a surrender
O or negotiation. A high factor also means the Captain may seek to destroy
W the enemy more that the mission objective require.
  
S      BRAVERY (B)
K 
I The higher this factor, the more likely it is the Captain will engage in
D risky situations.
  
R      DIPLOMACY (P)
O 
W The higher the factor, the better the Captain is at negotiating with
  neutral outposts for repair and resupply.
S 
K      EXPERIENCE (E)
I 
D The higher this factor, the more experience the Captain has had in combat.
  More experience means the Captain is better at whatever tactics are known
R by him/her.  Tactics known are determined by ingenuity.
O 
W      HUMILITY (H)
  
S The higher this factor, the better able the Captain is at taking orders
K from lesser experienced Captains.

D      INGENUITY (I)
  
R The higher this factor, the more sophisticated battle tactics the Captain
O knows.
W 
       LEADERSHIP (L)
S 
K The higher the factor, the better the Captain is at controlling his group.
I 
D      LOYALTY (Y)
  
R Low loyalty means the Captain is liable to surrender easily. A low factor
O will also mean that he is less likely to take risks to complete the
W mission.

K 
I Low stamina means the Captain is likely to make errors during a prolonged
D battle.
  
R      TEMPERAMENT (M)

I SELECTING AN APPEARANCE
D 
  To the left of the trait editing scales is an image of a "generic" Captain
R which alters somewhat as you change certain traits. Directly above that is
O a small set of controls labeled FACE, which consists of two action buttons
W and a small display. These controls allow you to select a "look" for each
  Captain. There are 24 different faces available: 16 men and 8 women. Use
S the RIGHT to go to the next face, and the LEFT to go back to the previous
K one.
I 
D Whichever face is shown in this display when you save the Captain
  determines the face and sex of that character during game play only. The
R full-figure image of the captain on the screen will not change.
O 
W 
  DOSSIER MODE
S 
K The text in the CAPTAIN'S DOSSIER is what will appear in a mission when a
I player reads the docket for the Captain.
D 
  When the DOSSIER button is highlighted, the lower portion of the screen is
R occupied by the CAPTAIN'S DOSSIER editor. This consists of nothing more
O than an extremely large text field into which the text for the Captain's
W dossier is entered/edited.
  
S Since the dossier editors for the CAPTAINS and ENEMY RACES and the mission
K briefing editor of the MISSION BUILDER (206) are all virtually identical,
I documentation on the operation of the editor is covered at the end of this
D part, under the heading Supplement: Dossier/Briefing Editors. Refer to that
  section for details on using the dossier editor.
R 
O 
W WRITING A CAPTAIN'S DOSSIER
  
S Admittedly, you can write just about anything you like, but, ideally, the
K function of the dossier is to give the player a "personality sketch" of the
I character, useful for determining that Captain's strengths, weaknesses, and
D potential uses and dangers. Therefore, the best way to write a dossier is
  to, through the text, give some clues as to the Captain's personality
R without spelling out each trait numerically (ie., - "his LOYALTY is low at
O 34").
W 
  As an example, the following is the dossier for Captain Denial Mabuso
S (included with the game), followed by her actual traits. Notice how the
K text manages to give string hints as to what these traits are without
I actually listing them off.
D 
        BORN:  2346 CE
R       SERIAL NUMBER: SF3641 - BR1 1697
O 
W Captain Mabuso is the daughter of Renita Mabuso, Defense Minister of
  Imperial Beurn. As the child of a high-ranking government official, she is
S well aware of the "pomp before progress" stance of the Mellus
K Administration ruling Beurn. As a result, she has developed an intense
I disdain for bureaucracy, and thus is something of a "maverick", rejecting
D authority she considers incompetent.
  
R This hotheaded, rebellious nature is tolerated primarily because Mabuso is
O one of the most brilliant tacticians ever to serve the FW. She is the only
W academy graduate to ace the "Leslie Maru" endurance test, and has been
  known to achieve minor miracles under the most extreme pressure.
S 
K Now her actual stats/traits:
I 
D       AGGRESSIVENESS 64
        BRAVERY        70
R       DIPLOMACY      34
O       EXPERIENCE     52
W       HUMILITY       25
        INGENUITY      99
S       LEADERSHIP     44
K       LOYALTY        67
I       STAMINA        88
D       TEMPERAMENT    26
  
R A few final notes on writing a dossier that is "correct" for the Omnitrend
O "Universe". If you're creating your own worlds, the following is not so
W important.
  
S Our "convention" for Captains is to begin with the BORN: and SERIAL NUMBER:
K fields on the first two lines, leave the next line blank, and then write
I the rest of the dossier in paragraph form (see above example).
D 
  The BORN: value can be easily determined. The "war" that is declared in the
R game's opening sequence begins/began in 2374 CE (Common Era). You can
O assume your mission will take place sometime after that. Figure out your
W Captain's age at the time war was declared, subtract it from 2374, and you
  have your BORN: date.
S 
K FWAF serial numbers always begin with SF, and always contain letters and
I numbers in the precise configurations as in this example serial number:
D SF3641-BR1 1697. In other words, the 'SF', four digits, a hyphen, two
  letters, and a final six digits.
R 
O 
W 203 SPACECRAFT DESIGN
  
S This section of the builder allows you to create, edit, and delete
K Federated  Worlds and allied starships. Construction is simplicity itself:
I you select the ship class, pick the parts, name the vessel, and save it.
D Spacedocks should have it so easy!
  
R 
O SHIP SELECTION
W 
  The upper third of the panel is occupied by the ship selector. At the
S center is an image of a ship flanked by + and - buttons, which allow you to
K cycle through the ship classes. There are six ships classes. From weakest
I (militarily) to strongest, they are:
D 
        TRANSPORT
R       SCOUT
O       DESTROYER
W       CRUISER
        HEAVY CRUISER
S       DREADNOUGHT
K 
I When you first enter the panel or use NEW (F4), the default ship type is a
D SCOUT.
  
R To the left of the ship display are MAX SYS SIZE and STAT readouts. Under
O MAX SYS SIZE are labels for each of the ship's six primary systems, and the
W number displayed in the value readout to the right of each label is the
  maximum "size" of each system the currently selected ship class can carry.
S If any select part for a system has a size that is larger than the number
K indicated, a TOO BIG warning will appear under STAT.
I 
D      NOTE: You will not be allowed to save the current ship if any
             TOO BIG warnings appear.
R 
O If any TOO BIG warnings appear, you'll either have to change the ship class
W to a larger ship to accommodate the systems you have specified, or select
  smaller parts for the indicated systems. If, after selecting parts that fit
S the current ship class, you change the ship to a lower/smaller class, one
K or more of the selected parts may not fit.
I 
D 
  SHIP NAME
R 
O To the right is a field labeled SHIP NAME. It consists of a standard text
W editing field and one button, NAME (N), which activates the text editing
  mode. See Part IV for details on the operation of text editing fields.
S 
K You will not be able to save the current ship if no name has been entered
I for it.
D 
  
R PARTS SELECTORS
O 
W The majority of the panel is dominated by the parts selectors, which allow
  you to equip each ship from an inventory of numerous part. To the left are
S six parts selectors. Using the arrow buttons there you select the
K combination of parts you want. To the bottom-right of the screen is a
I CURRENT PART STAT DISPLAY, which displays the stats of the last part you
D selected.
  
R 
O THE SELECTORS
W 
  These are used to select which parts you wish to use for each of the ship's
S six primary systems. Each part selector consists of a label (selection
K button), and a part display, bracketed on either side by previous part and
I next part action buttons (LEFT and RIGHT). To change a part, all you need
D to do is use the arrow buttons to move forward or backward through the
  selections.
R 
O Keyboard users will note that the same buttons are used for all six
W selectors, and might be confused as to how you pick which system you wish
  to edit. The label for each system is a selection button. The scale next to
S the currently highlighted label is the one the LEFT and RIGHT buttons will
K affect. To switch parts to edit, simply press the indicated key to
I highlight the part that you wish to edit. Mouse users will note that each
D time they click one of the arrow buttons, the highlighted label changes to
  reflect the part being edited.
R 
O The six system types and selectors are as follows:
W 
  COMMUNICATIONS (C)    Picks the communications system you
S                       want to equip your ship with.  There are
K                       3 models to choose from.
I 
D COMPUTER (M)          Picks the computer system you want
                        to equip your ship with. There are 4
R                       models to choose from.
O 
W DRIVE (D)             Picks the drive system you want to
                        equip your ship with.  There are 5
S                       models to choose from.
K 
I LIFE SUPPORT (L)      Picks the communications system you
D                       want to equip your ship with. There are
                        3 models to choose from.
R 
O 
W SHIELDS (S)           Picks the defensive shield system you
                        want to equip your ship with.  There are
S                       5 models to choose from.
K 
I WEAPONS (W)           Picks the offensive weapons system
D                       you want to equip your ship with. There
                        are 5 models to choose from.
R 
O 
W CURRENT PART STAT DISPLAY
  
S This box is directly below the SHIP NAME box and right of the PARTS
K SELECTORS, to which it is linked by a bracket featuring a moving tab which
I links the STAT DISPLAY to whatever part has been selected last. Its job is
D to provide you with the statistical information for the last selected part.
  
R For example, when you first create a new ship (from 101), when you arrive
O on 203 the highlighted system is communications, and the parts displayed
W there is the first part in the list. The CURRENT PART STAT DISPLAY
  identifies it as a THUKE XX, which is capable of sustaining 4 points of
S damage before it fails, has a sophistication level of 33, and a size of 2.
K If you then advanced to the next part for the communications system the
I stats would change to reflect it (a Giaperelli Marconi II). If you were to
D switch to editing parts for another system, the stats for the current part
  listed under whatever system you moved to would appear in this box.
R 
O In brief, the more sophisticated a part, the more effective it is, but the
W harder it is to repair, and the less chance you'll have of finding an
  outpost than can repair or replace it. The larger the size of a part the
S fewer ship classes it will fit into.
K 
I At the top of the CURRENT PART STAT DISPLAY is the logo of the company that
D manufactures the currently selected part. Below that is the company name,
  and below that is the part name. Finally, the bottom three lines list
R damage points, sophistication and size of the part.
O 
W      NOTE: Technical details about all FW ship classes, parts, and
             enemy ship classes and parts are covered in Appendix III.
S            You can consult it to determine how various ship and part
K            combination stack up against those of opposing forces.
I 
D 
  SHIP BUILDING HINTS
R 
O Although there are a limited number of possible combinations of ships and
W parts, there are enough so that you can create a group of ships with widely
  varying capabilities.
S 
K It's important to remember that the Heavy Cruiser class vessels can only be
I commanded by Fleet Commanders with a rank of at least 1st Lieutenant, and
D the Dreadnoughts by those with a rank of at least Commander. Thus, if
  you're making missions to be played by less "experienced" player
R characters, you shouldn't make tons of top-end ships (although you can
O always assign a Captain to command such ships in a mission).
W 
  When naming ships that operate within the established Omnitrend "universe",
S always precede all Federated Worlds Armed Forces ship names with an FWS, as
K in FWS YURY GAGARIN or FW STERESHKOVA. Privately or corporately owned
I transports and scouts can also be added, and such ships should not have
D an FWS prefix.
  
R 
O SAVING SHIPS
W 
  When you save a ship it is added to the current ship list. If, when you
S try to save a ship, any part is too big for the current ship class, and/or
K the ship has no name, you will be warned and returned to the ship builder.
I 
D If you create (having used CREATE from 101 or NEW from this panel) anew
  ship with a name identical to an existing one, the existing one is not
R overwritten.
O 
W 
  204 ENEMY RACES
S 
K This section of the builder allows you to create, edit, and delete enemy
I races. This panel operates in three modes, on allowing you to the
D personality traits, a second allowing you to design the "look" of the
  creatures, and a third allowing you to edit the dossier. Initially, this
R panel will be in the "traits" mode.
O 
W The actual operation of this panel is identical to that for FW Captains
  with the exception of the addition of the PHYS FORM mode.
S 
K Just below the upper bar is a bar containing a text field for the race's
I name, a button for editing the name, and controls for switching between
D traits and dossier mode. These controls are as follows:
  
R NAME (N)
O 
W This is a toggle action button. When activated, a text editing frame and
  cursor appears, allowing you to enter/edit the race's name. (See Part IV
S for details on working with text editing fields.)
K 
I PHYS FORM (Y), DOSSIER (D) and TRAITS (T)
D 
  Only one of these buttons can be active at one time. In phys form mode, the
R lower portion of the screen is occupied by a "body construction" panel. In
O dossier mode, the lower portion of the screen is occupied by the races's
W dossier editor.  In traits mode (the default), the lower portion of the
  screen is filled with the race's personality traits editor. Switching modes
S has no effect on anything entered or edited in either mode, so you can feel
K free to go back and forth between them without fear of losing your work.
I 
D TRAITS MODE
  
R The default mode.  When the TRAITS button is highlighted, the lower portion
O of the screen is occupied by the PERSONALITY TRAITS editor. This consists
W of ten thermometer type scales, each used to set a particular trait (see
  Part IV for details on the operation of thermometer scales).
S 
K Each trait can range from 00 to 99, and the current setting is always
I displayed in the related value readouts to the left of the scales. To
D adjust a trait, simply move the arrowhead pointer below the selected scale.
  Moving the arrowhead to the right increases the value; moving it to the
R left decreases the value. The value changes while the arrowhead.
O 
W Keyboard users will note that the same buttons (- and +) are used for all
  ten scales, and might be confused as to how you pick which trait you wish
S to edit. The label for each trait is a selection button. The scale next to
K the currently highlighted label is the one the - and + buttons will affect.
I To change traits, simply press the desired key to highlight the trait that
D you wish to edit.
  
R Mouse users will note that each time they click/drag an arrowhead, that
O arrowhead lights up, and the highlighted label changes to reflect the
W current trait being edited.
  
S It is the combination of the values of each of these traits which determine
K the personality of a race. The ten traits are as follows and affect the
I indicated aspects of the race:
D 
       AGGRESSIVENESS (A)
R 
O The higher this factor, the less likely the race will accept a surrender. A
W high factor also means that they will be more violent.
  
S      BRAVERY (B)
K 
I The higher this factor, the more likely it is the race will engage in risky
D situations.
  
R      DIPLOMACY (P)
O 
W The higher the factor, the better the race is at negotiating with neutral
  outposts for repair and resupply.
S 
K      EXPERIENCE (E)
I 
D The higher this factor, the more experience the race has in combat. More
  experience means the race is better at whatever tactics are known by them.
R Tactics known are determined by ingenuity.
O 
W      HUMILITY (H)
  
S The higher this factor, the better able the race is at taking orders from
K those of lesser experience.
I 
D      INGENUITY (I)
  
R The higher this factor, the more sophisticated battle tactics the race
O knows.
W 
       LEADERSHIP (L)
S 
K The higher the factor, the better the race is at controlling groups of
I ships.
D 
       LOYALTY (Y)
R 
O Low loyalty means the race is liable to surrender easily.
W 
       STAMINA (S)
S 
K Low stamina means the race is likely to make errors during a prolonged
I battle.
D 
       TEMPERAMENT (M)
R 
O The lower the factor, the less stable the race. This would cause them to
W make errors under pressure.
  
S PHYS FORM MODE
K 
I When the PHYS FORM (Y) button is highlighted, the lower portion of the
D screen is occupied by a special "construction panel" which allows you to
  assemble physical forms for aliens out of a series of parts.  To the right
R are four parts selectors. Using the arrow buttons there you select the
O combination of parts you want. To the bottom-left of the screen is a
W pigment selector (disabled in CGA), with a bright border around the color
  you select.  When you have picked the parts you like and the color you
S want, using the ASSEMBLE (S) button puts together your choices and produces
K a full alien.
I 
D THE PARTS SELECTOR
  
R This is used to select which parts you wish to use for the race. There are
O four body part categories, and almost any combination of parts are possible
W (there are a few restrictions). Each part selector consists of a label
  (selection button), and a part display, bracketed on either side by
S previous part and next part action buttons ( LEFT and RIGHT). To change a
K part, all you need to do is use the arrow buttons to move forward or
I backward through the selections.
D 
  Keyboard users will note that the same buttons are used for all four
R selectors, and might be confused as to how you pick which part you wish to
O edit. The label for each body part is a selection button. The scale next to
W the currently highlighted label is the one the LEFT and RIGHT buttons will
  affect. To switch parts to edit, simply press the indicated key to
S highlight the part that you wish to edit. Mouse users will note that each
K time they click one of the arrow buttons, the highlighted label changes to
I reflect the part being edited.
D 
  The four part types and selectors are as follows:
R 
O HEAD (H)    Picks the type of head you want the race to have. There
W             are 41 different heads to choose from, or you can
              decide these aliens have no head at all. (The last head
S             looks like that of the creature on the Breach 2 box.)
K 
I TORSO (O)   Picks the type of main body you want the race to have.
D             There are 13 torsos to choose from.  You cannot
              choose not to have a torso, as the race has to have at
R             least one part. Body number 11 is snakelike and used
O             to construct the Aliens seen in Breach 2; if you select
W             it, any arms you selected will not appear when the race
              is assembled because the body has no "shoulders" to
S             which to attach arms.
K 
I LEGS (L)    Picks the type of legs you want the race to have. There
D             are 13 sets of legs to choose from, or you can decide
              these aliens have no legs at all.
R 
O             Of the 11 set of legs (11 presses of the + or, 3 presses
W             of the from the "blank" or "no legs" option), only one leg
              is fully visible, and the other leg is only partly there.
S             These legs are used to construct the Aliens seen in Breach 2
K             and designed specifically to work with body 11 (see above).
I             If you select these legs, when you assemble the race, body
D             11 will be used regardless of which body you selected, and,
              since body 11 does not permit arms, any arms you selected
R             will also not appear because body 11 has no "shoulders" to
O             which to attach them.
W 
  ARMS (A)    Picks the type of arm you want the race to have. There are
S             11 arm types to choose from, or you can decide that these
K             aliens have no upper limbs.
I 
D THE PIGMENT SELECTOR
  
R This occupies the lower-left corner of the PHYS FORM display. (It is
O disabled in CGA). This portion of the panel simply consists of eight
W selection buttons, although you wouldn't necessarily realize that's what
  they are by looking at them. Unlike regular selection buttons which are
S blue (cyan in CGA), each of the eight selection buttons here are different
K colors. The currently selected color is indicated by a white frame around
I the button. When you select another color button (either by clicking on it
D or pressing the number for a color), the white frame moves to it.
  
R Whatever color you have selected when you use ASSEMBLE (S) is the "skin
O pigment" you have chosen for the race. The sections of the body parts which
W appear pink/light-red in the parts selector will be recolored to match your
  choice, but other colors will not (like those featuring silvery mechanical
S parts, etc.).
K 
I THE ASSEMBLY BOX
D 
  This appears above the pigment selector and to the left of the part
R selector. It consists of a display and a single button: ASSEMBLE (S).
O When you use ASSEMBLE the parts and pigment currently selected are put
W together to generate complete physical form for the race you are working
  on. If, following assembly, you are not happy with the results, simply edit
S your part and/or color selections and then use ASSEMBLE again. you can do
K this as many times as you like.
I 
D 700,000+ POSSIBILITIES
  
R Given all of the part and color options available, the PHYS FORM editor can
O potentially generate up to 733,744 possible variations of enemy forms!
W 
  PRE-MADE ENEMY FORMS
S 
K Included with the game are a set of special graphics which feature pre-
I made enemy images which are not affected by the PHYS FORM mode. For
D example, while a UDP Officer is clearly human, creating a naked man with
  the PHYS FORM editor hardly results in an "official" looking UDP Officer.
R Thus, a picture of a uniformed UDP Officer, as well as other potential
O enemies, have been included with the program.
W 
  To access these graphics, all you have to do is type a very specific name
S into the NAME field. The graphic will not appear on panel 204 (you'll see
K whatever form was last assembled from PHYS FORM mode), but the appropriate
I image will appear when playing a mission (on the communications and enemy
D docket displays). Remember, you must type the name exactly as indicated.
  
R Name                Description
O 
W UDP OFFICER         A UDP Officer
  FWSF MARINES        A (renegade) FWSF Marine
S FWRP                FW Reserve (outpost crew) Personnel
K 
I DOSSIER MODE
D 
  The text in the ENEMY DOSSIER is what will appear in a mission when a
R player reads the docket for the race.
O 
W When the DOSSIER button is highlighted, the lower portion of the screen is
  occupied by the ENEMY DOSSIER editor. This consists of nothing more than
S an extremely large text field into which the text for the race's dossier is
K entered/edited.
I 
D Since the dossier editors for the CAPTAINS and ENEMY RACES and the mission
  briefing editor of the MISSION BUILDER (206) are all virtually identical,
R documentation on the operation of the editor is covered at the end of this
O part, under the heading Supplement: Dossier/Briefing Editors. Refer to that
W section for details on using the dossier editor.
  
S KEYBOARD NOTE: Since keypresses in dossier mode are interpreted as text
K entry into the dossier, to use any of the normal screen buttons in dossier
I mode, hold down the Alternate key on your keyboard while pressing the
D indicated letter, such as pressing Alt+T to switch back to traits mode. The
  Alternate key is not necessary when using the function keys for buttons on
R the Upper Bar.

S                            PART VII: THE BUILDER
K 
I WRITING A RACE'S DOSSIER
D 
  Admittedly, you can write just about anything you like, but, ideally, the
R function of the dossier is to give the player some background information
O on the opposing forces, useful for determining their strengths and
W weaknesses. Therefore, the best way to write a dossier is to, through the
  text, give some clues as to the race's traits without spelling out each
M aspect numerically (ie - "their stamina is very high at 92").
I 
C A few final notes on writing an enemy dossier that is "correct" for the
T Omnitrend "Universe". If you're creating your own worlds, the following is
L not so important.  Our "convention" for races is to begin with the RACE:
A and ORIGIN: fields on the first two lines, leave the next line blank, and
N then write the rest of the dossier in paragraph form.
T
E       RACE:     MUTAI LAICR'MOK BETA
C       ORIGIN:   TUOLES LAICR'MOK, SYSTEM LG-MD8: (30, -27, -6)
U
H
T 205 SOLAR SYSTEMS
L
I Every battle requires a battleground, and in Rules of Engagement
  battlegrounds are solar systems. Sorry, we don't allow fighting in the
S vast emptiness between stars.
T
A The solar system builder is fairly simple, and has few requirements. Each
R system has a map area 4 x 4 billion kilometers square, and all items for
K that system must fit within that space.  Secondly, all solar systems must
  have at least one star/sun. 
T
H Beyond that, you can place 1 additional sun, and anywhere from 0 to 99 of
E the following: planets (3 classes), asteroid fields, and outposts (3
  types). It's entirely your choice.
C
O
R THE MAP
S
A The map display on this panel works virtually identically to the map on the
I navigation panel in the game proper (see 301 Navigation in Part V for
R operational details), with a few minor additions. First of all, the view
  radius is not limited by any sort of sensor range restrictions as in a
S mission, so you can alter the view from 2 billion to 75 kilometers in
K radius.
I 
D The horizontal and vertical coordinate pointers along the bottom and right
  edges of the map can be moved manually, allowing you to change the view
R center. The arrowheads there can either be dragged using the mouse, or
O moved by activating the UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT buttons on-screen or their
W equivalent keys.
  
S Zooming in and out using the mouse is identical to on other maps. keyboard
K users must use the + and - buttons to change the view radius.
I 
D Furthermore, additional off-map controls can be used to alter the view
  center and radius (see MAGNIFICATION and SET VIEW CENTER below).
R 
O EDIT SYSTEM
W 
  To the right of the map are three banks of controls. The uppermost is the
S most important, for the controls in it are used for creating and editing
K system components. Under EDIT SYSTEM are selection buttons used to pick the
I type of item to act on, and action buttons used to act on the selected item
D type.
  
R Of the selection buttons, only one can be highlighted at one time. A small
O movable "tab" links the highlighted button to a bracket which connects it
W to the action buttons immediately to the right. The selection buttons are:
  
S STAR (S)    When highlighted, the action buttons allow you to
K             create, edit, relocate or delete stars in the system.
I 
D PLANET (P)  When highlighted, the action buttons allow you to
              create, edit, relocate or delete planets in the system.
R 
O ASTEROID (A) When highlighted, the action buttons allow you to create,
W             edit, relocate or delete asteroid fields in the system.
  
G OUTPOST (O) When highlighted, the action buttons allow you to
R             create, edit, relocate or delete outposts in the system.
E
E The action buttons are to the right of the selection buttons. They are:
T
S CREATE (C)  Brings up a usurper box which is used to create a new
              star, planet, asteroid field or outpost.
C
R EDIT (E)    Produces a selector with which you pick which specific
Y             item of the type selected you wish to edit. Once the
S             item has been picked, a usurper box appears, which is
T             used to edit the selected item.
A
L RELOCATE (R) Produces a selector with which you pick which specific
              item of the type selected you wish to relocate. Once the
T             item has been picked, the map display switches into
H             "locate" mode (see below), allowing you to alter the
G             system location of the item.

T DELETE (D)  Produces a selector with which you pick which specific
D             item of the type selected you wish to delete.
T
  VIEW FIELD
Q
T This subpanel consists of three items: two action buttons and a miniature
X representation of the map. The first action button is MIN (N), and
  activating it causes the map radius to be set to minimum radius (75
T kilometers). The second button is MAX (M), which sets the map radius to
R maximum radius (2 billion kilometers).
S
I The miniature map is used to show the size and location of the current map
  view relative to the full system map. A square frame within the mini map
F indicates the current map area. If you reduce the view area of the large
L map, the framed area will shrink. And, if you alter the view center, the
T frame will move off-center as well.

S SET VIEW CENTER
N
I The four action buttons here are used to quickly center the map view on
P specific items within the system. Activating any of the buttons causes a
E selector to appear, with which you identify the specific item of the
R indicated type to center on. Highlight the item on the selector and then
  use its CENTER (N) button. This causes the map's horizontal and vertical
F centering coordinates to be altered to center on the selected item. The
R name of the item will appear at the top of the main map.
E
D The centering options are:
D
Y       STAR (T)      Center on a star
        PLANET (L)    Center on a planet
B       ASTEROID (I)  Center on an asteroid field
U       OUTPOST (U)   Center on an outpost
L
L
D THE INFO BUTTON
O
G Between the VIEW FIELD subpanel and the main map is a single action button:
  INFO (F). Activating INFO results in an information usurper box appearing,
S listing data about the item the map display is currently centered on (if
C any). The name currently centered item will appear at the top of the main
O map.
O
P If you manually move the view center off of an item, the last centered item
E remains listed at the top of the map and the subject of INFO until you
X re-center on another item.

C This feature is a quick way to check on the stats of an item without having
O to enter an editing mode. Use the SET VIEW CENTER controls to center on the
M object you want and then use INFO to "scan" it.
P
A
N CREATING/EDITING STARS
Y
  When you first create a new solar system, there is always one star already
C present. This star has the I.D. 501 and defaults to a M type (red) star
O with a radius of 696,000 kilometers. You can edit the stats of this star
R (name, type, and radius), but you cannot delete it unless there is another
P sun in the system.
O
R To create or edit a star, go to EDIT SYSTEM, highlight STAR (S) and then
A use either the CREATE (C) or EDIT (E) button. A usurper panel appears, on
L which you can enter the name of the star (a standard text editing field),
  select its class (highlight one of the six class labels under STAR TYPE),
A and even adjust its radius (using a thermometer scale at the bottom of the
N box). Once the star's stats are to your liking, use the LOCATE (L) button
D to exit the box and go into map's locate mode to place the star (see LOCATE
E MODE below).
V
E Star Limit
R
O There is a limit of two stars per system. This is realistic because,
N while many stars come in clusters, it is rare (outside of the center of
  a galaxy) to find more than two within 4 billion kilometers of each
I other.
N
C Star Names

S When you first create a new system, the default star has an I.D. (501),
K but no name. The name of the first star will be the name of the system,
I so choose carefully.
D 
  If you create a star, you are always creating the second star (502) in
R the system, and its default name will be the name of the first star
O (501) followed by a space and the letter B, as in "Alpha Centaur B". If
W the first star's name is already 17 or 18 characters long (the limit),
  the last two characters are replaced by the space and B. Naturally, you
S can edit this name to be anything you want.
K 
I Star Sizes
D 
  The default size for a star is a 696,000 kilometer radius, the size of
R Earth's sun. You can actually adjust this radius from a bottom end limit
O of 5,000 kilometers to a top end limit of 300 million kilometers. The
W sizes of stars indicate their "class", ranging from Neutron Stars
  through Supergiants.  As you adjust the radius, the readout under STAR
S CLASSIFICATION in 002 tells you what class the star is.
K 
I Class                  Radius in Kilometers
D 
  SUPERGIANTS            100,000,000 to 300,000,000
R GIANTS                 10,000,000 to 99,999,999
O MAIN SEQUENCE          50,000 to 9,999,999
W WHITE DWARF            10,000 to 49,999
  NEUTRON STARS          5,000 to 9,999
S 
K HINT: Stars with habitable planets would most likely be those
I       of Main Sequence size.
D 
  Star Types
R 
O There are six star classes in Rules of Engagement, ranging in
W color/chemical composition and temperature. The hotter a star, the more
  communications related interference it generates.  Remember this when
S creating your systems and missions. (The temperature of a star and a ship's
K proximity to it determine the interference levels.)
I 
D       Type       Color           Temperature (Celsius)
  
R       B          White/bluish    25,000 C
O       A          White           11,000 C
W       F          Yellowish       7,5000  C
        G          Yellow          5,300 C to 5,800 C
S       K          Orange          4,000 C to 4,900 C
K       M          Red             3,000 C to 3,400 C
I 
D HINT: Stars capable of supporting habitable planets would most
        likely be classes F, G, and K.
R 
O 
W CREATING/EDITING PLANETS
  
S When you first create a new solar system, there are no planets present.
K Each planet has an I.D. starting with the letter P, as in P02.
I 
D To create a planet, go to EDIT SYSTEM, highlight PLANET (P) and then use
  either the CREATE (C) or EDIT (E) button. A usurper panel appears, on which
R you can enter the name of the planet (a standard text editing field),
O select its class (highlight one of the three labels under PLANET TYPE), and
W even adjust its radius (using a thermometer scale at the bottom of the
  box). Once the planet's stats are to your liking, use the LOCATE (L) button
S to exit the box and go into the map's locate mode to place the planet (see
K LOCATE MODE below).
I 
D Planet Limit
  
R You can have anywhere from 0 to 99 planets in a system.
O 
W Planet Names
  
S When you first create a new planet, the default name is "MAGRATHEA".
K You can edit this and change it to whatever you like.
I 
D Planet Sizes
  
R The default size for a planet is a 7,000 kilometer radius, roughly the
O size of the Earth. You can actually adjust this radius from a bottom end
W limit of 100 kilometers to a top end limit of 200,000 kilometers.
  
S HINT: Realistically, habitable planets should have a radius no
K       greater than 7,800 and no less than 6,100 kilometers.
I 
D Planet Types
  
R There are three planet types in Rules of Engagement:
O 
W      Type       Classes    Realistic Sizes (radius in km)
  
S      Gaseous     A-C       20,000 to 200,000
K      Airless     D-J       100 to 20,000
I      Habitable   K-N       7,800 to 6,100
D 
  Gaseous planets are those which are composed primarily of light gasses,
R such as hydrogen and helium. They tend to be very large, with no tangible
O surfaces. Examples of gaseous planets in our own solar system are Jupiter,
W Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.
  
S Airless planets are rocky worlds with atmospheres that are either
K nonexistent or unbreathable. Examples of airless planets in our own solar
I system are Mercury, Venus, the Moon, Mars, and many of the moons of the
D gaseous outer planets.
  
R Habitable planets are those with a breathable atmosphere. Human habitable
O planets require water, and acceptable surface gravity.
W 
  
S CREATING/EDITING ASTEROID FIELDS
K 
I When you first create a new solar system, there are no asteroid fields
D present. Each field has an I.D. starting with the letter A, as in AO1. To
  create or edit an asteroid field, go to EDIT SYSTEM, highlight Outpost (P)
R and then use the CREATE (C) or EDIT (E) buttons. A usurper panel appears,
O on which you can adjust the field's density (using the thermometer scale at
W the bottom of the box).  The denser the field, the more sensor blockage it
  will cause to ships within it.
S 
K Once the field's density is to your liking, use the LOCATE (L) button to
I exit the box and go into the map's locate mode to place and set the size of
D the field (see LOCATE MODE below).
  
R HINT: When calling this box using EDIT (E), two arrow buttons flank the
O       field I.D., allowing you to scroll through all of the different
W       fields you've created and adjusted their densities without having
        to call the edit function many, many times.
S 
K 
I CREATING/EDITING OUTPOSTS
D 
  When you first create a new solar system, there are no outposts present.
R Each outpost has an I.D. starting with the letter T, as in T02.
O 
W To create or edit an outpost, go to EDIT SYSTEM, highlight Outpost (R) and
  then use either the CREATE (C) or EDIT (E) buttons. A usurper panel
S appears, on which you can enter the name of the outpost (a standard text
K editing field), select its type (highlight one of the three labels under
I outpost TYPE), and adjust its supply and repair sophistication (using the
D two thermometer scales at the bottom of the box). Once the outpost's stats
  are to your liking, use the LOCATE (L) button to exit the CREATE Outpost
R box and go into the map's LOCATE MODE to place the outpost (see LOCATE MODE
O below).
W 
  Outpost Limit
S 
K You can have anywhere from 0 to 99 outposts in a system.
I 
D Outpost Names
  
R When you first create a new outpost, the default name is "TANTALUS". You
O can edit this and change it to whatever you like.
W 
  Outpost Sophistication
S 
K The default sophistication levels for any outpost's supply and repair
I factors is 50. You can adjust this factor from a bottom end limit of 0
D to a top end limit of 99. The more sophisticated the outpost, the better
  equipped it is to help starships.
R 
O Outpost Types
W 
  There are three outpost types in Rules of Engagement: FW, Enemy/UDP and
S Neutral.
K 
I FW outposts are those which are allied with the FW or under FW control.
D They will allow your forces to dock without hesitation and do their best to
  resupply and repair you.
R 
O UDP/Enemy outposts are those controlled by hostile forces. They will not
W allow your forces to dock with them, but will allow your enemies to dock
  and receive assistance. FW forces can, of course, attempt to board and
S seize control of such outposts.
K 
I Neutral outposts are those which are not allied with either you or the
D enemy forces. They may nor may not allow a given ship to dock (dependant on
  that the diplomatic ability of the ship's captain).  In extreme emergencies
R FW forces can, of course, attempt to board and seize control of such
O outposts.
W 
  Outpost Locations
S 
K Outposts can either be free-floating or planet-locked. A Free-floating
I outpost is a space station, while a planet-locked outpost rests on the
D surface of or in the atmosphere of a planet. To make an outpost free
  floating, locate it outside of the boundaries of any planets. To make it
R planet-locked, place it within the bounds of a planet.
O 
W      HINT: It takes ships longer to resupply at planet-locked
             outposts than from free-floating ones.
S 
K 
I RELOCATING STARS, PLANETS, ASTEROID FIELDS, AND OUTPOSTS
D 
  When you select RELOCATE (R), a selector box appears allowing you to
R specify which item of the selected type you wish to relocate. Highlight
O your selection and use LOCATE (L). You will jump immediately into locate
W mode, details of which follow.
  
S LOCATE MODE
K 
I In this mode the EDIT SYSTEM buttons vanish and are replaced by DONE (D)
D and ABORT (A) buttons. At map center, a small crosshair appears, showing
  the current location of the object to be located. You can move this
R crosshair anywhere on the map by either holding down a Shift key while
O clicking the mouse or by holding down a Shift key while pressing and
W holding one of the arrow keys on the keyboard.
  
S      NOTE: Asteroid fields are placed by locating two opposite corners
K            of a rectangular area defining the field. With the mouse this
I            is accomplished by Shift-clicking to set the first corner of
D            the rectangle, and then Shift-clicking again to set the
             opposite corner.
R 
O With the keyboard this is accomplished by using the Shift and arrow keys to
W set the first corner, and using the following keys to position to opposite
  corner:
S 
K      Home       moves the end corner to the left
I      End        moves the end corner to the right
D      PageUp     moves the end corner to the up
       PageDown   moves the end corner to the down
R 
O Using a Shift-arrow key combination after a field area has been drawn
W erases the current field area and sets a new starting point.
  
S In locate mode all of the usual map, map centering, and map zoom controls
K work normally, allowing you to change the view radius, center, etc., which
I choosing the location for your object.
D 
  When the crosshair is placed correctly, use the DONE (D) button to exit
R LOCATE MODE and lock-down the selected item. If you decide you don't want
O to do this after all, ABORT (A) will exit LOCATE mode without making any
W changes to the map. (If you are relocating an existing object, it will not
  be moved; if you were placing a newly created item, it's creation will be
S aborted and it will not appear at all.)
K 
I 
D SAVING A SOLAR SYSTEM
  
R There are no special conditions for saving a solar system, as the editor
O will not allow you to remove the only condition this builder requires: that
W you have at least one star.
  
S 
K 206 MISSION 
I 
D The mission builder allows you to edit and create missions for the game. It
  is the same mission builder used to create the missions included with the
R game.
O 
W Missions are made up of the following components:
  
S       1) A single solar system in which the battle takes place
K       2) One or more Federated Worlds ships and captains
I       3) An Enemy Race to battle against
D       4) Some (or possibly no) enemy ships
        5) Some (or possibly no) waypoints
R 
O The first three mission components are created and stored separately from
W the missions (they will be referred to as "external components"). This
  allows you to maintain a "library" of ships, ship captains, solar systems,
S and enemy races so that you do not need to create them each time you make a
K mission. Before creating or editing a mission, you should create and/or
I edit the external components. The external components are copied and stored
D in the mission file. This is done so that if you wish to trade missions
  with someone, you need only send the mission file and not all the external
R components.
O 
W Should you make a change to an external component, the change will not be
  made in any missions that use the component. You will need to edit the
S mission and reread the component. Procedures for re-reading these
K components will be described later.
I 
D The mission builder provides for the creation and editing of the remaining
  mission components; enemy ships and waypoints. These are "internal
R components" and are unique to the mission.
O 
W 
  ENTERING THE PANEL
S 
K If you entered the panel by selecting CREATE from the main panel, you will
I first be required to select the solar system in which the mission takes
D place. You will be able to change this system later, but a solar system is
  always required to begin a new mission.
R 
O 
W THE MAP
  
S You will notice that the mission builder panel is similar to the solar
K system builder panel (205). The map works almost identically. The
I difference is in the centering control (see SET VIEW CENTER below).
D 
  
R EDIT MISSION
O 
W To the right of the map are three banks of controls. The uppermost is the
  most important, for the controls in it are used for creating and editing
S mission components. Under EDIT MISSION are selection buttons used to pick
K the type of item to act on, and action buttons used to act on the selected
I item type. Below these are a group of four buttons used to edit other
D mission information. These four buttons will be described later.
  
R 
O Of the selection buttons, only one can be highlighted at one time. A small
W movable "tab" links the highlighted button to a bracket which connects it
  to the action buttons immediately to the right. The selection buttons are:
S 
K FW FLEET (F)   When highlighted, the action buttons allow you to load
I                (from a library), edit, relocate or remove Federated
D                Worlds ships in the mission.
  
R ENEMY (Y)      When highlighted, the action buttons allow you to
O                create, edit, relocate or delete enemy ships in the
W                mission.
  
S WAYPOINT (W)   When highlighted, the action buttons allow you to
K                create, edit, relocate or delete waypoints in the mission.
I 
D IGS (G)        When highlighted, the action buttons allow you to
                 specify Breach 2 scenarios that are linked to outpost
R                and enemy ships.
O 
W The action buttons are to the right of the selection buttons. There are two
  sets of action buttons. The first is for FW FLEET, ENEMY, and WAYPOINT.
S They are:
K 
I ADD (A)        Brings up a usurper box which is used to add a new FW
D                ship, enemy ship, or waypoint.
  
R EDIT (E)       Produces a selector with which you pick which specific
O                item of the type selected you wish to edit. Once the
W                item has been picked, a usurper box appears, which is
                 used to edit the selected item.
S 
K RELOCATE (R)   Produces a selector with which you pick which specific
I                item of the type selected you wish to relocate. Once the
D                item has been picked, the map display switches into
                 "locate" mode (see below), allowing you to alter the
R                system location of the item.
O 
W DELETE (L)     Produces a selector with which you pick which specific
                 item of the type selected you wish to delete.
S 
K The second set is only for IGS. They are:
I 
D OUTPOST -> BREACH 2 (O)   Brings up a usurper box which is used to link
                            a Breach 2 scenario to an outpost.
R 
O ENEMY -> BREACH 2 (E)     Brings up a usurper box which is used to link
W                           a Breach 2 scenario to an enemy ship.
  
S 
K VIEW FIELD
I 
D This subpanel consists of three items: two action buttons and a miniature
  representation of the map. The first action button is MIN (N), and
R activating it causes the map radius to be set to minimum radius (75
O kilometers). The second button is MAX (M), which sets the map radius to
W maximum radius (2 billion kilometers). The miniature map is used to show
  the size and location of the current map view relative to the full system
S map. A square frame within the mini map indicates the current map area. If
K you reduce the view area of the large map, the framed area will shrink.
I And, if you alter the view center, the frame will move off-center as well.
D 
  SET VIEW CENTER
R 
O The SET VIEW CENTER (T) button here is used to quickly center the map view
W on specific items within the solar system. Activating this button will
  bring up subpanel 011.  This subpanel contains buttons for all the map
S elements. Activating any of these buttons causes a selector to appear, with
K which you identify the specific item of the indicated type to center on.
I Highlight the item on the selector and then use its CENTER (N) button. This
D causes the map's horizontal and vertical centering coordinates to be
  altered to center on the selected item. The name of the item will appear at
R the top of the main map.
O 
W The centering options are:
  
S       FW SHIP (F)     Center on a Federated Worlds ship
K       ENEMY SHIP (E)  Center on an enemy ship
I       WAYPOINT (W)    Center on a waypoint

R       ASTEROID (I)    Center on an asteroid field
O       OUTPOST (U)     Center on an outpost
W       ABORT (A)       Abort the centering command
  
S THE INFO BUTTON
K 
I Between the VIEW FIELD subpanel and the main map is a single action button:
D INFO (I). Activating INFO results in an information usurper box appearing,
  listing data about the item the map display is currently centered on (if
R any). The name currently centered item will appear at the top of the main
O map.
W 
  If you manually move the view center off of an item, the last centered item
S remains listed at the top of the map and the subject of INFO until you
K re-center on another item.
I 
D This feature is a quick way to check on the stats of an item without having
  to enter an editing mode. Use the SET VIEW CENTER controls to center on the
R object you want and then use INFO to "scan" it.
O 
W MISCELLANEOUS CONTROLS
  
S Four other buttons, grouped below the edit mission controls, allow for the
K editing of the remaining mission information.
I 
D NAME/DIFF (D)
  
R Activating this button will bring up subpanel 014, allowing you to set the
O name and author of the mission, difficulty level, and solar system used in
W the mission.
  
S The EDIT (E) button allows you to edit the mission name. The mission name
K is the name displayed on the main game panel (101). This name should
I appear similar to a military operation codename. The NAME (A) button allows
D you to edit the author's name. The author's name will appear when a mission
  is played.
R 
O The mission difficulty is your estimation of the difficulty in completing
W the mission.  Note that by convention, missions should be rates assuming
  the game is played on the advanced level.
S 
K The CHANGE SYSTEM (C) button will bring up a usurper box allowing you to
I select a new solar system or re-load the existing one. You would want to
D re-load the same solar system if you were to make changes to the system in
  the solar system builder.
R 
O When you are finished editing, select DONE (D) to save the changes.
W 
  RACE (C)
S 
K Activating this button will bring up a selector box allowing you to select
I or change the enemy race in the mission. Before saving a mission, you will
D need to make this selection.
  
R At the top of the selector box, the currently selected enemy race will
O appear. If no race has yet been selected, "NONE" will appear.
W 
  There are three buttons at the bottom of the selector box. CANCEL (C) will
S remove the selector and no change will result. EXAMINE (E) will bring up
K subpanel 006 allowing you to view the personality traits and dossier of the
I currently highlighted race. DONE (D) will remove the selector box, making
D the currently highlighted race the enemy race used in the mission.
  
R Note that subpanel 006 that appears on selecting EXAMINE has a few controls
O of its own. When it initially appears, the personality traits will be
W displayed. By activating the DOSSIER (O) button, the dossier for the race
  will be displayed.  You can scroll the dossier up and down using the up and
S down arrow buttons.  When displaying the dossier, activating the TRAITS (T)
K button will return you to the traits display. Selecting DONE (D) will
I remove the subpanel and return you to the selector box.
D 
  SET VICTORY (S)
R 
O Activating this button will bring up subpanel 012, allowing you to edit the
W victory conditions for the mission. For a description of each of the
  victory conditions, see Part III of the manual under "Objectives".
S 
K This subpanel lists the eight mission victory conditions. Each of the
I conditions can be turned on or off by activating the appropriate ON (O) or
D OFF (F) button in the toggle column. A check mark will appear to the right
  of these buttons (in the active column) if the condition is on.
R 
O When playing from the keyboard, you will first need to select the victory
W condition by pressing the appropriate number key (1-8). The edit column
  will display the currently selected condition. Some victory conditions have
S additional data that must be entered. These are as follows:
K 
I CONDITION 2   For this condition, you must select both a ship and a
D               waypoint. The + and - buttons are used to select the
                ship, and the UP and DOWN buttons are used to select the
R               waypoint. You must first add the ships and waypoints,
O               since these controls will scroll through only the existing
W               items. If you later remove a ship or a waypoint that
                relates to this victory condition, the condition will
S               automatically be turned off.
K 
I               If you are using a keyboard, you must select victory
D               condition 2 (by pressing 2) before using the +, -,
                UP and DOWN.
R 
O CONDITION 4   For this condition, you must first select an outpost
W               using the UP and DOWN buttons.
  
S               If you are using a keyboard, you must select victory
K               condition 4 (by pressing the number 4) before pressing
I               the UP and DOWN keys.
D 
  CONDITION 5   For this condition, you must select an enemy ship using
R               the UP and DOWN buttons.
O 
W               If you are using a keyboard, you must select victory
                condition 5 (by pressing the number 5) before pressing
S               the UP and DOWN keys.
K 
I CONDITION 6   For this condition, you must select a percentage of the
D               enemy fleet to neutralize. Activate the SET % (S)
                button and an edit field will appear around the current
R               percentage. Backspace over the old percentage and
O               enter a new one. Press the enter key when done.
W 
  CONDITION 7   For this condition, you must select a percentage of the
S               outposts to control. Activate the SET % (E) button and
K               an edit field will appear around the current percentage.
I               Backspace over the old percentage and enter a new
D               one. Press the enter key when done.
  
R CONDITION 8   For this condition, you must enter a time limit in hours
O               and minutes. Activate the HOURS (H) button and an
W               edit field will appear around the current hour value.
                Backspace over the old value and enter a new one.
S               Press the enter key when done. Activating the MINS
K               (M) button will similarly allow you to edit the minutes
I               value.
D 
  When you have finished editing the victory conditions, activate the DONE
R (D) button to save the changes. Activating the ABORT (A) button will abort
O all changes you have made.
W 
  BRIEFING (B)
S 
K Activating this button will bring up subpanel 015 allowing you to edit the
I mission briefing. The editing controls work the same as the editing
D controls in the captain and enemy race dossier panels. Operation of these
  controls is covered at the end of Part VII, under the heading Supplement:
R Dossier/Briefing Editors. Refer to that section for details on using the
O mission briefing editor.
W 
  KEYBOARD NOTE: Since keypresses in the editor mode are interpreted as text
S entry into the mission briefing, to use any of the normal screen buttons in
K the editor mode, hold down the Alternate key on your keyboard while
I pressing the indicated letter, such as pressing Alt #I to switch back into
D insert mode.
  
R ADDING FW FLEET SHIPS
O 
W When you first create a new mission, there are no FW ships present. Each FW
  ship has an I.D. starting with the letter F, as in F02.
S 
K To add an FW ship, activate the FW FLEET (F) button, and then use the ADD
I (A) button. A selector box will appear, allowing you to select both a ship
D and a captain. The left-hand column will display the list of ships in your
  library.
R 
O Preceding each ship name is a two letter code indicating the class of the
W ship. The codes are:
  
S       TR     Transport
K       SC     Scout
I       DE     Destroyer
D       CR     Cruiser
        HV     Heavy Cruiser
R       DR     Dreadnought
O 
W The right-hand column displays your library of ship captains. These two
  lists can be scrolled up and down by using the buttons on either side of
S the names. The PageUp and PageDown buttons will scroll the ship list, and
K the + and - buttons will scroll the captains list.
I 
D Select both a ship and a captain by pointing to the name and clicking the
  mouse.  From the keyboard you can use the UP and DOWN keys to select the
R ship, and use the LEFT and RIGHT keys to select the captain. Note that by
O selecting the Fleet Commander as the ship captain, you are in effect
W selecting the flagship for the mission. This is the ship that the player
  will be commanding. Since there can only be one flagship in each mission,
S you can only select the fleet commander for one ship in each mission.
K 
I Below each list are buttons for examining the currently selected item.
D Activating EXAMINE SHIP (S) will bring up a box (007) displaying
  information on the selected ship.  The ship name, class, and parts manifest
R are all shown. Activating DONE (D) will remove this box.
O 
W EXAMINE CAPTAIN (C) will bring up a box (006) displaying information on the
  currently selected captain. Initially, the personality traits will be
S displayed.  Activating the DOSSIER (O) button will display the dossier. The
K dossier can be scrolled using the UP and DOWN keys. Activating DONE (D)
I will remove this box.
D 
  Once you have selected the ship and captain, use the EDIT/LOCATE (E) button
R to continue with the process. Activating the ABORT (A) button instead will
O abort the process of adding a ship. If you have continued the process, a
W new box (007) will appear allowing you to edit the damage status of the
  ship. This allows you to have the ship begin the mission with some damage
S already sustained. Each system will begin at 100% operational. Reducing
K each value will cause each system to be damaged that amount. Reducing the
I value to zero means the system is destroyed. The only way the player will
D be able to repair a destroyed system is at an appropriate outpost.
  
R If using a mouse, you can operate either the slider controls or the + and -
O buttons to set the damage level. From the keyboard, first select the system
W you want to set (using the buttons to the left of the damage level amount),
  then use the + and - keys to adjust the damage level.
S 
K Activating the ARMAMENTS (A) button will display the initial missile
I quantity on board the ship. The ship will begin with no missiles. Missiles
D can be added by pressing the UP and DOWN buttons. When using a keyboard,
  first select the missile type you wish to change by activating the
R appropriate button (use keys 1 thru 8).  Next, use the UP and DOWN keys to
O change the missile quantity. You will be limited in the quantity of each
W type of missile that can be loaded according to the weapons system on the
  ship. Refer to Appendix Ill under the weapons system parts list for the
S maximum quantities.
K 
I After the damage and armaments are set, use the LOCATE (O) button to exit
D the box and go into the map's locate mode to place the ship within the
  solar system (see LOCATE MODE below). Activating the ABORT (B) button
R instead will abort the addition of the ship.
O 
W EDITING FW FLEET SHIPS
  
S To edit an existing FW ship, activate the FW FLEET (F) button, and then use
K the EDIT (E) button. A selector box will appear, allowing you to select the
I ship you wish to edit. The left-hand column will display the list of ships
D already in the mission.
  
R The right-hand column displays the captain currently assigned to the ship.
O The ship list can be scrolled up and down by using the buttons to the left
W of the ship ID. Select the ship you wish to edit by pointing to the name
  and clicking the mouse. From the keyboard you can use the UP and DOWN keys.
S 
K Below the right-hand list is the CHANGE CAPTAIN (C) button. Activating this
I button will cause the selector box to change into a mode allowing you to
D select a different (or re-load the existing) captain for the selected ship.
  This works similar to the selector box for adding a ship, except the
R left-hand column will only display the selected ship.
O 
W Note that the ship that is assigned the Fleet Commander will act as the
  flagship for the mission. This is the ship that the player will be
S commanding. Only one ship can be assigned the Fleet Commander.
K 
I Once you have selected the ship, use the EDIT (E) button to edit the damage
D and armament, or the RELOCATE (R) button to relocate the ship. Activating
  the ABORT (A) button instead will abort the editing process.
R 
O If you have selected EDIT, the damage and armament edit box will appear.
W This box will operate the same as it does in adding a new ship.
  
S If you selected the RELOCATE button, the map will go into the locate mode,
K allowing you to reposition the ship.
I 
D 
  ADDING ENEMY SHIPS
R 
O When you first create a new mission, there are no enemy ships present. Each
W enemy ship has an I.D. starting with the letter E, as in E02.
  
S To add an enemy ship, activate the ENEMY (E) button, and then use the ADD
K (A) button. A selector box will appear, allowing you to select both a ship
I and a captain. The left-hand column will display the list of enemy ship
D classes.
  
R The right hand column displays a list of ranks for the ship captain. These
O two lists can be scrolled up and down by using the buttons on either side
W of the names.  The PageUp and PageDown buttons will scroll the ship list,
  and the + and - buttons will scroll the captains list.
S 
K By making the two selections, you are picking the class of the enemy ship,
I and the rank of the ship's captain. If you pick a captain with a higher
D rank, he will be more experienced at commanding the ship and crew.
  
R Select both a ship class and a captain rank by pointing to the name and
O clicking the mouse. From the keyboard you can use the UP and DOWN keys to
W select the ship class, and the LEFT and RIGHT keys to select the rank.
  
S Once you have made your selections, use the EDIT/LOCATE (E) button to
K continue with the process. Activating the ABORT (A) button instead will
I abort the process of adding a ship.
D 
  If you have continued the process, a new box (007) will appear allowing you
R to edit lit the damage status of the ship. This allows you to have the ship
O begin the mission with some damage already sustained. Each system will
W begin at 100% operational.  Reducing each value will cause each system to
  be damaged that amount.  Reducing the value to zero means the system is
S destroyed. The only way the enemy will be able to repair a destroyed system
K is at an appropriate outpost.
I 
D If using a mouse, you can operate either the slider controls or the + and -
  buttons to set the damage level. From the keyboard, first select the system
R you want to set (using the buttons to the left of the damage level amount),
O then use the + and - keys to adjust the damage level.
W 
  Activating the ARMAMENTS (A) button will display the initial missile
S quantity on board the ship. The ship will begin with no missiles. Missiles
K can be added by pressing the UP and DOWN buttons.  When using a keyboard,
I first select the missile type you wish to change by activating the
D appropriate button (use keys 1 thru 8).  Next, use the UP and DOWN keys to
  change the missile quantity. You will be limited in the quantity of each
R type of missile that can be loaded according to the weapons system on the
O ship. Refer to Appendix II under the weapons system parts list for the
W maximum quantities.
  
S After the damage and armaments are set, use the LOCATE (O) button to exit
K the box and go into the map's locate mode to place the enemy ship within
I the solar system (see LOCATE MODE below). Activating the ABORT (B) button
D instead will abort the addition of the ship.
  
R EDITING ENEMY SHIPS
O 
W To edit an existing enemy ship, activate the ENEMY (Y) button, and then use
  the EDIT (E) button. A selector box will appear, allowing you to select the
S ship you wish to edit. The left-hand column will display the list of enemy
K ships already in the mission.
I 
D The right-hand column displays the rank of the captain currently assigned
  to the ship. The ship list can be scrolled up and down by using the buttons
R to the left of the ship ID. Select the ship you wish to edit by pointing to
O the name and clicking the mouse. From the keyboard you can use the UP and
W DOWN keys.
  
S Below the right-hand list is the CHANGE CAPTAIN (C) button. Activating this
K button will cause the selector box to change into a mode allowing you to
I select a different rank for the captain of the selected ship. This works
D similar to the selector box for adding a ship, except the left-hand column
  will only display the selected ship.
R 
O Once you have selected the ship, use the EDIT (E) button to edit the damage
W and armament, or the RELOCATE (R) button to relocate the ship. Activating
  the ABORT (A) button instead will abort the editing process.
S 
K If you have selected EDIT, the damage and armament edit box will appear.
I This box will operate the same as it does in adding a new ship. If you
D selected the RELOCATE button, the map will go into the locate mode,
  allowing you to reposition the ship.
R 
O ADDING WAYPOINTS
W 
  When you first create a new mission, there are no waypoints present. Each
S waypoint has an I.D. starting with the letter X, as in X02.
K 
I To add a waypoint, activate the WAYPOINT (W) button, and then use the ADD
D (A) button. The map will go into the locate mode to allow you to position
  the waypoint within the solar system (see LOCATE MODE below).
R 
O RELOCATING SHIPS AND WAYPOINTS
W 
  When you select RELOCATE (R), a selector box appears allowing you to
S specify which item of the selected type you wish to relocate. Highlight
K your selection and use LOCATE (L). You will jump immediately into locate
I mode, details of which follow.
D 
  LOCATE MODE
R 
O In this mode the EDIT MISSION buttons vanish and are replaced by DONE (D)
W and ABORT (A) buttons. At map center, a small crosshair appears, showing
  the current location of the object to be located. You can move this
S crosshair anywhere on the map by either holding down a Shift key while
K clicking the mouse or by holding down a Shift key while pressing and
I holding one of the arrow keys on the keyboard.
D 
  In locate mode all of the usual map, map centering, and map zoom controls
R work normally, allowing you to change the view radius, center, etc., which
O choosing the location for your object.
W 
  When the crosshair is placed correctly, use the DONE (D) button to exit
S LOCATE MODE and lock-down the selected item. If you decide you don't want
K to do this after all, ABORT (A) will exit LOCATE mode without making any
I changes to the map. (If you are relocating an existing object, it will not
D be moved; if you were placing a newly created item, it's creation will be
  aborted and it will not appear at all.)
R 
O SAVING A MISSION
W 
  Before you can save a mission, you must first give it a name, select an
S enemy race, and add at least one FW ship with the Fleet Commander as the
K captain (the flagship). If you try to save a mission before specifying one
I of these elements, you will receive a warning message and be returned to
D the editor.
  
R SUPPLEMENT:   DOSSIER/BRIEFING EDITORS
O 
W The dossier editors for the CAPTAINS (Panel 202) and ENEMY RACES (Panel
  204) and the mission briefing editor of the MISSION BUILDER (Panel 206) are
S all virtually identical, documentation on the operation of the editor is
K covered in this subsection.
I 
D THE EDITOR
  
R The editor consists of a field some 15 lines tall and approximately 70
O characters wide. We say "approximately" because all of the text in Rules of
W Engagement is proportionally spaced. This means that, unlike standard
  computer text, each character does not take up exactly the same amount of
S space as all others. Thus, an I requires only half the space of an A and
K one third the space of an M.
I 
D Like the smaller text editing fields seen in Rules of Engagement, a small
  cursor appears wherever you are currently typing. Unlike those fields, the
R Enter-Return key on your keyboard does not exit the text editing mode, nor
O does clicking the mouse. As long as the DOSSIER button is active, all
W normal keyboard input is interpreted as text editing.
  
S KEYBOARD NOTE: Since keypresses in dossier mode are interpreted as text
K entry into the dossier, to use any of the normal screen buttons in this
I mode, hold down the Alternate key on your keyboard while pressing the
D indicated letter, such as pressing Alt + T to switch back to traits mode.
  The alternate key is not necessary when using the function keys for buttons
R on the Upper Bar.
O 
W MOUSE NOTE: Clicking the mouse on existing dossier/briefing text jumps the
  text editing cursor to that location. If you click where no text has been
S typed, the cursor will not jump to that location.
K 
I There are two text editing modes, overtype and insert. The default setting
D when you first enter panel 202 is for overtype mode. The current mode is
  determined by the status of the two buttons to the right of the dossier
R text field. Only one of them can be active at any one time.
O 
W INSERT (Alt + I)
  
S If this is highlighted, when you move the cursor into the midst of existing
K text and begin typing, text in inserted at the cursor position, pushing
I existing text to the right. If the end of the existing text being "pushed"
D hits the physical end/limit of the dossier text field, the last "word" (a
  group of characters with no spaces within) will be deleted. To prevent the
R loss of the end of your dossier you will have to delete some existing text
O first, move the cursor to another location, or switch to overtype mode
W (below).
  
S OVER (Alt + O)
K 
I If this is highlighted, when you move the cursor into the midst of existing
D text and begin typing, the text you type replaces existing text,
  overwriting it.
R 
O Finally, in the MISSION BRIEFING editor (015) there is a DONE (Alt + D)
W button below the insert and overtype mode controls. This button is used to
  exit to the MISSION panel (206).
S 
K Additional notes on text editor operation:
I 
D The arrow/cursor keys can send the text editing cursor up, down, left or
  right. The only limitation is that you cannot cursor out into "blank" space
R where no characters or spaces have been typed.
O 
W Word-wrap is automatic. If the word you are typing reaches the end of the
  current line and will not fit, it is automatically "wrapped" around to the
S next line.
K 
I Enter/Return puts a "hard-Return" at the end of the current line and forces
D the cursor to the next line down.
  
R The Backspace key deletes text to the left of the-cursor.
O 
W The Delete key does nothing.
  
S The numbers and decimal point/period on the numeric keypad are not usable
K (although the 2,4,6 and 8 keys are used as cursor keys).
I 
D The text which appears in this editor is purely uppercase, thus the status
  of the Shift and CapsLock keys have no effect on the case of letters.
R 
O Although most standard characters and punctuation are supported, the
W following symbols are unavailable:
  
S    @ # $ ^ & = | < > { }
K 
I There is no provision for importing external text files as dossiers.
D 
  While the proportionally spaced text makes the dossier nicer looking, its
R main drawback is that it forces the program to do lots of recalculations
O every time a character is inserted or deleted, as it must do a lot of
W redrawing. Therefore, the dossier editor can get quite sluggish if you're
  backspacing or inserting text in a fairly "full" dossier.
S 
K Because of the proportional spacing, the maximum number of characters
I possible in a single dossier is variable.
D 
  
R 
O                   PART VIII: THE INTERLOCKING GAME SYSTEM
W 
  Overview
S 
K The Interlocking Game System (herein referred to as IGS) is an innovative
I new approach to computer games. IGS Games are capable of working with one
D another, appearing to the player to be a single game.
  
R Rules of Engagement (hereafter referred to as Rules) is an IGS controlling
O module.  It is, in effect, the starting point for your characters.  Rules
W will automatically load and run other IGS games when the game conditions
  warrant.
S 
K Requirements
I 
D The only special requirement to run the IGS system is a hard drive.
  Unfortunately, running such a complex and intertwined system as IGS just
R does not work smoothly on a floppy based system.
O 
W Breach 2
  
S As of this writing, the game Breach 2 is the other game in the IGS series.
K You will need Breach 2 version 2.0 or higher (the version number is shown
I on the title screen of the game). When installing Rules, you will have the
D option of installing the IGS links. This procedure requires your original
  Breach 2 disks and will actually copy Breach 2 into the same directory of
R your hard disk that contains Rules.
O 
W Some Rules missions contain "WIGS Links", meaning that there is at least
  one enemy ship or outpost that is linked to a Breach 2 scenario (included
S with the mission). When attempting to board the ship or outpost, the game
K will bypass the normal boarding screen (panel 401) and instead, load
I Breach 2 and the scenario. No additional interaction is required on your
D part!  Your Fleet Commander will act as the Squad Leader for the mission.
  All experience gained in the mission is transferred back to Rules and saved
R in your Fleet Commander's record.
O 
W The scenario can be saved in progress if you desire. Once you resume the
  mission, Rules will automatically reload Breach 2 and resume the scenario.
S When the scenario is complete, you will return to Rules right where you
K left off.
I 
D The Future
  
R More IGS modules are planned in the future. Under consideration are modules
O to simulate planetary assaults, and a module permitting you to explore and
W colonize uncharted space.
  
S 
K 
I                   APPENDIX I: ALL ABOUT FLEET COMMANDERS
D 
  Fleet Commander characters are created by you, the user, and act as your
R alter-ego in the game.  You can create as many Fleet Commanders as you
O like, although playing consistently with one or two will probably increase
W the rate at which promotions are achieved.
  
S      NOTE: If your Feet Commander is killed in a mission the character
K            is not erased from the disk. The mission is simply
I            logged as a "mission loss" in the character's stats.
D 
  Your overall objective is to advance your Fleet Commander. This is
R accomplished by successfully completing missions, which raises the total
O score for the Commander. When certain scores are reached, the Commander is
W promoted (see Scores below).
  
S Moving up through the ranks is very important.  Fleet Commanders who have
K not reached particular ranks will not be allowed to command missions where
I the flagship is a large warship.  For instance, in order to command a heavy
D cruiser class flagship, your Fleet Commander must have a rank of at least
  1st Lieutenant.
R 
O Following is a listing of flagship classes and the minimum rank a Fleet
W Commander must have in order to assume command.
  
S       Flagship Class      Minimum Rank
K       Transport           Ensign
I       Scout               Ensign
D       Destroyer           Ensign
        Cruiser             Ensign
R       Heavy Cruiser       1st Lieutenant
O       Dreadnought         Commander
W 
  When a game has been started, the Fleet Commander chosen for the game is
S removed from the "available" list, and his/her name is followed by a N/A
K (Not-Available) flag.  Until the game in question is completed or deleted,
I that Commander will not be usable. This is to prevent the character from
D being used in multiple games at the same time, which would cause problems
  when, the character completed the missions. After all, how could anyone
R command two Flagships in two different locales at the same time?!
O 
W Creating Commanders and Importing Others
  
S From the GAME/MISSION 101 panel you can create, examine and delete Fleet
K Commanders characters (this is covered in detail in Part V of this manual),
I as well as import Breach 2 Squad Leaders as Commanders (covered in Appendix
D VI). All Fleet Commanders are stored in a file called RULES.CMD. It is
  possible to import other RULES.CMD files and add the Commanders in that
R file to your own list. See Appendix VI for details on how to import .CMD
O files.
W 
  WARNING!  Deleting or overwriting the RULES.CMD file erases all Fleet
S           Commanders you have created.
K 
I Character Stats
D 
  Each Fleet Commander has his/her own set of statistics.  There are two
R categories of stats for each Commander, 'Mission' and 'Squad Level'.
O Mission stats are related to the commander's performance in Rules of
W Engagement missions. Mission stats are:
  
S SCORE
K 
I Each mission attempted results in a score, which is added to the total
D score from all missions attempted by the Commander.
  
R ATTEMPTED
O 
W The total number of missions the Commander has attempted so far.
  
S BATTLE TIME
K 
I The total time the Commander has spent in missions; listed in hours.
D 
  VICTORIES
R 
O The total number of missions the Commander has successfully completed.
W 
  LOSSES
S 
K The total number of missions the Commander has failed to complete.
I 
D SHIPS LOST
  
R The total number of Federated Worlds starships lost in battle in missions
O commanded by the Commander.
W 
  KILLS
S 
K The total number of enemy vessels captured/destroyed in missions led by the
I Commander.
D 
  The Squad Level stats relate to the boarding of enemy ships and Outposts.
R The first six stats (encumbrance, base moves, bonus moves, accuracy,
O cracking, and detecting) come into play only if the Interlocking Game
W System (IGS) is used to access Breach 2 when boarding enemy ships and
  Outposts. These stats relate specifically to Breach 2 action and have no
S effect in Rules of Engagement itself. (See Part VIII of this manual for
K more information about IGS and Breach 2.) The remaining six Squad Level
I stats are affected by both Breach 2 and the built-in marine-combat routines
D of Rules of Engagement. These stats are:
  
R SQUAD BATTLES
O 
W The total number of squad battles the Commander has attempted thus far.
  
S SQUAD VICTORIES
K 
I The total number of successful squad battles the Commander has led thus
D far.
  
R SQUAD LOSSES
O 
W The total number of unsuccessful squad battles the Commander has led
  thus far.
S 
K SQUAD TIME
I 
D The total time (in minutes) the Commander has spent leading squads.
  
R SQUAD LEVEL KILLS
O 
W The total number of enemies killed by the Commander (himself) in squad
  missions thus far.
S 
K MARINES LOST
I 
D The total number of FWSF marines under the Commander who were killed in
  squad battles thus far.
R 
O Score
W 
  At the end of each mission the Commander receives a mission score, which
S is appended to the character's total score.
K 
I The mission score is based upon mission performance. For instance,
D sustaining crew casualties, damage, and destruction of Federated Worlds
  ships, and enemy takeovers of FW Outposts all have negative effects on the
R mission score. On the other hand, if the Commander's forces destroy enemy
O ships, or capture enemy ships and Outposts, the score is effected
W positively.
  
S      HINT: Capturing enemy vessels yields more points than simply
K            destroying them.
I 
D Promotions
  
R A Fleet Commander is promoted in rank when his/her score reaches certain
O levels. Promotions are based on score.

  Commendations
R 
O In addition to being promoted through the ranks, your Fleet Commanders can
W also receive commendations for their actions. There are six medals that can
  be awarded, and any commander can have multiples of each. The medals are
S displayed when you examine a Fleet Commander from either the GAME/MISSION
K panel or when you check the Commander's docket from DATA RETRIEVAL within
I the game. Medals are as listed below and awarded in the circumstances
D following.
  
R FW CROSS
O 
W Awarded when, in a single mission, at least 3 enemy Outposts or 8 enemy
  ships are captured or destroyed.
S 
K DISTINGUISHED SERVICE
I 
D Awarded once every 40 enemy ships losses.
  
R PURPLE HEART
O 
W Awarded when, upon returning from a mission, the Fleet Commander's ship
  suffered more than 50% crew loss.
S 
K DISTINGUISHED CAREER CLUSTER
I 
D Awarded every 20 victorious missions.
  
R FW MEDAL OF HONOR
O 
W Awarded for every 500 points of score.

S Converting Breach 2 Squad Leaders
K 
I If you own a copy of Breach 2, you can convert your existing Squad Leaders
D into Rules of Engagement Fleet Commanders. From the main game panel (101),
  select FLEET CMDR. The list of existing Fleet Commanders will appear, along
R with a bar of button selections. Activate the CONVERT (V) button. A usurper
O box will appear (010), allowing you to enter the path name where your
W Breach 2 Squad Leaders exist.
  
S If you are playing on floppy disks, you will (prior to running Rules of
K Engagement) want to copy the Squad Leaders to your data disk (disk 4 for
I 5.25" players, disk 2 for 3.5" players) to prevent having to swap disks.
D 
       NOTE: Breach 2 Squad Leaders are stored in files with the file
R            extension .B2L; ie - NAME.B2L.
O 
W Use EDIT PATH (P) if you wish to alter the path to another directory. A
  text editing frame and cursor (see Text Editing Fields in Part IV for
S details on operation) appears around the current pathname, allowing you to
K alter it. If you are satisfied with the current path, or finished editing
I the pathname and wish to continue with the importing action, use the DONE
D (D) button. If you have second thoughts, press ABORT (A) to return to panel
  101.
R 
O For each Squad Leader found in the selected path, a "Create Fleet
W Commander" box (009) will appear, allowing you to modify the name and
  select the appearance of the Fleet Commander (see Part V for details on the
S operation of the "Create Fleet Commander" box).
K 
I At any time during the importation process you may use the ABORT (A) button
D on the 009 box to stop importing Squad Leaders. If you do this, the process
  will be aborted, and the currently displayed Breach 2 Squad Leader and all
R others not already converted will not be added to your Fleet Commander
O list.
W 
  Transferring Builder Items
S 
K All of the builder elements (Fleet Commanders, Captains, Enemies, Ships,
I Solar Systems, and Missions) are stored in separate data files. With the
D exception of missions, all items of a single type are combined into one
  data file. These file names are as follows:
R 
O       RULES.CMD     Fleet Commanders
W       RULES.CAP     Ship Captains
        RULES.EMY     Enemy Races
S       RULES.FLT     Fleet Ships
K       RULES.SOL     Solar Systems
I 
D Missions are stored in separate files with the file extension .MIS.
  
R Rules of Engagement provides a way you can add builder items from a
O friend's game, or items you download from a modem. Upon running the game,
W the program will look for files named XFER.CMD, XFER.CAP, XFER.EMY,
  XFER.FLT, and XFER.SOL. If it finds one or more of these files, it will
S merge the contents of the file with the main data file of the same type 
K (ie - merging XFER.CAP with the current RULES.CAP). The "XFER" file will
I then be deleted.
D 
  For instance, suppose you want to give a copy of your enemy races file to a
R friend of yours who also owns a copy of the game. Make a copy of your
O RULES.EMY file, renaming it XFER.EMY. Send the file to him and have him
W copy it onto his disk that contains his copy of RULES.EMY. When he runs the
  program, your enemy races will be merged with his.
S 
K Note that duplicate entries in any of the data files will result if both
I the "RULES" and "XFER" files contain the same item. This will not cause any
D problem with the game, but you may want to delete such duplicate entries.
  
R CAUTION!  Just because two items have the same name does not mean they are
O identical. Examine each item before deleting it. Two alien races are both
W called Martians and two ships are both named Shalmanseer could actually be
  quite dissimilar. In other cases, the items are virtually identical, but
S one has been edited slightly. In such cases, we recommend editing one of
K the duplicate items to change its name, simply to avoid confusion. In cases
I where there items are exact duplicates, it's best to delete one of them.
D 
  Since missions are stored in separate files, you do not need to follow this
R procedure to transfer missions. Simply copy the new MS files onto your disk
O containing your original mission files (disk 4 for 5.25" players, disk 2
W for 3.5" players, or your hard disk directory containing the game).
  
S  Btw, there may be mistakes; it took us long enough to edit it as much as
K             we did! Just be glad that we did this much for you!
