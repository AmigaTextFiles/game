INTRODUCTION
Dr Devious, the world renouned abstract scientist, has gone insane! No one
really minded when wild geometric cloud cloud formations appeared over his
laboratory, however, there were a few objections when the Pentacon became 
a square and the Kremlin was cubed!

Dr Devious` obsession stems back to his acquisition of a cubist painting by
Picasso which he hung in his laboratory.  He was so inspired by this 
painting that his love for geometric forms became obsessive.  then, one 
morning, a sinister idea lept into his mind, he would invent a machine that
would cube the Earth!

But before he can impliment his master plan, he has to experiment, so he 
tests his machine on world famous structures and objects.  When he is 
satisfied with his machine he intends to proceed with his master plan.

You play J.J. Maverick - The only person who can stop the Doctor cubing the
Earth.


CONTROLS
Within the game there are three joystick modes, these are NORMAL, GRABBIN`,
and CARRYING.

You start in NORMAL mode, from here you can push...


NORMAL MODE

(When not near a block)
	LEFT/RIGHT: J.J. will walk left or right.
	UP:         J.J. will jump.
	FIRE:       Shoot current weapon.

(When next to a block)
	TOWARDS BLOCK: Climb onto block.
	FIRE:          Grab block, this takes you to GRABBIN` MODE.
	(PRESS FIRE AGAIN TO RELEASE BLOCK)
	
	
GRABBIN` MODE

	AWAY FROM BLOCK: Pull block.
	FIRE:            Release block.
	UP:              Lift block; takes you to CARRYING MODE.
	
	
CARRYING MODE

	LEFT/RIGHT:       Carry block left or right.
	DOWN:             Place block in front of J.J. at his feet.
	FIRE + direction: Throw block in that direction.  	
	

NOTE 1: If there is a block that J.J. can stand on as well as touch with his 
hands, such as the "L" shape blocks like those found in Tetris, he will be
avle to grab hold of the block and pull it thru mid-air.

NOTE 2: The joystick directions rotate with J.J. eg, If J.J. is standing on
the floor down is towards the bottom of the screen.  however if he is on a 
wall down is towards the outside of the screen, or towards his feet, 
whichever way you want to look at it.

End.
