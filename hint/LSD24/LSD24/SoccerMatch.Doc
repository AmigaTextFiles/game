                   SOCCER MATCH (Energize) - 100% FINAL


LOADING INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------
Switch on and insert the disk when the workbench prompt appears. Keep the
disk in the machine while the game is being played.


THE GAME
--------
The match is on! Type in the name of your team (and the opposition), set
the difficuly and the length of the match and away you go. You control the
red team playing from left to right. The arrow shows which player you
control (the closest to the ball).


JOYSTICK CONTROL
----------------
The player under your control will move in any direction you move the
joystick. Pressing fire when the ball is near you will enable you to kick
the ball. How far it goes depends on the direction the joystick is in -
when you release the fire button.

Up and Left                      : flick ball to players left
Up                               : flick ball forward
Up and Right                     : flick ball to players right

Left                             : chip ball forward
Centred                          : low pass forward
Right                            : boot ball high in the air

Down and Left                    : short pass along ground
Down                             : medium pass along ground
Down and Right                   : long pass along the ground


KEYBOARD CONTROL
----------------
Press the following keys

T - Display time for a few seconds
S - Display score for a few seconds
P - pause game
Q - Quit game
E - Turn off the referee


MULTI-PLAYER OPTION
-------------------
Why not invite some friends round and have a tournament! By entering more
than 2 players (up to a maximum of 4) you can have a league - where you can
play against your friends. (A second joystick is needed - it won't work
with a mouse!).

The game will keep track of the results and display a league table at the
end of each game.

Good luck and play to win!
