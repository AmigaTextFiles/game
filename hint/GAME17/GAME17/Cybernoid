[Cybernoid]

[ST/AM]

This is the game for weird creatures and weapons.  It is a multidirection
scrolling shoot-em-up with all sorts of traps and things to fire at.  The
special effects are great and the sound is excellent.  You will want to
practice with this game till the Cybernoid 2 is released.

Basically you are a Bug-killer.  The mines are being sacked by strange
looking creatures (the green ones) and other types and your job is to rid
the place of them.  Unfortunately for you, they fight back.

Personally I like the LICE type creatures that hug the walls.

You have an unlimited number of ammunition, so don't be afraid to use them
all the time.  Also, don't forget to pick up the "extra" equipment that
assists you in getting through the game.

BACKDOOR TIME:

While viewing the title screen type "RAISTLIN" and press the space bar.
you should have an unlimited number of ships.

You should also be able to go to the next level by pausing the game and
pressing the N key.

OR 

Try defining your keys as Y X E S (in that order) and you should get an
infinite number of ships.
