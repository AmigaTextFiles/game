OBJECT: TO ENTER THE CHAMBER OF THE CODEX OF ULTIMATE WISDOM



General Hints
-------------
Visit the Seer Hawkwind often to see your progress on the paths of virtue. He
will tell you when you ar ready to go to the shrines and become a partial
Avatar. Don't use the Skull of Mondain anywhere other than O'J", O'J". Never
exit the balloon without first descending our your game will be destroyed. Go
to Lord British on the 2nd floor of Britannia for healing, help, and info  (ask
about virtues and principles). Never take chests from the towns or castles.
When talking to characters, try ^HEAL]th, ^JOB], ^NAME], ^LOOK], ^JOIN].  Also 
any words that they have use in their replies.  Answer questions truthfully. If
you need gold fast, try the dungeons for best results.

Ultima IV.  This chart will help you somewhat...

Sextant
-------
  To use the following coordinates you will first need a sextant.  This is used
to ^L]ocate position.  To get a sextant follow the hall north, west from the
weaponry in Buccaneer's Den.  The easiest way to get to Buccaneer's Den w/o a
sextant is to go straight east in a ship from Paws or 11 spaces north from
Magincia then straight west until you run into it.

Silver Horn & Shrine of Humility
--------------------------------
  Before attempting to go to the Shrine of Humility, ^U]se ^HORN] before
passage to Shrine (use several times for safety).  If you forget to do this
you will be attacked by endless hordes of Daemons.  Save game first!



Secret Doors
------------
  Examine walls carefully in towns, villages, castles, & dungeons for
secret doors.  They can be identified by a break in a black line in the walls.



Entering the Abyss
------------------

1) Be all 8-parts Avatar
2) Have the 3-part Key
3) Have all 8 stones
4) Know Word of Passage, have Bell, Book, Candle, and Wheel
5) Be well-versed in the meanings of each virtue & principle
6) Know the one true Axiom
-More-

--1-- Avatarhood

  Using the information above you can easily become eight parts Avatar. You do
so by learning each mantra, collecting all the runes, and visiting the Seer
Hawkwind often.  Also meditating at a shrine will give you a vision that will
help you to gain that virtue.  Some things you should remember when attempting
to gain each virtue are: never cheat the Herbs merchants, never kill non-evil
creatures if they are fleeing, do kill evil creatures fleeing or not, don't
take the gold of anyone in the towns, especially the chests you will find in
the treasure rooms, give gold often to increase your compassion, give your last
gold piece to a beggar to incrase sacrifice, or donate blood to the healers by
answering no to "Are you in need of help?" (it's best to do this in LB's castle
then go upstairs and have LB heal you), never claim to be something you are not
(a good example is when you are asked "Are you really an Avatar?"), and lastly
accomplish Valor simply by killing a lot of monsters without fleeing from
battle.  If you follow these rules carefully and visit Hawkwind often you will
be granted your Avatarhood.


--2-- 3-Part Key

 The 3-part key is very simple to get.  Once you have the stones, enter the
dungeons and go to the altar rooms of truth, love, & courage.  Then guide
one of your characters over the altar in the center and ^U]se these stones:

Altar Room of Truth: White, Blue, Purple, Green
Altar Room of Love: White, Green, Yellow, Orange
Altar Room of Courage: White, Red, Purple, Orange



--3-- The 8 Stones

  To get the black stone, stand where the moondoor near Moonglow will appear,
then search when the moons go dark.  To get the white stone, ready several wind
spells, and guide your balloon over Serpants Spine, west of LB's castle, go one
space south of the Ankh, land ballioon, and search.  Never exit w/o descending!
  The other stones are found on altars (not in altar rooms) of the dungeons:
Dasterd, Deceit, Shame, Wrong, Despise, & Covetous.  Most are on a fairly
low-lvl (7 is common), but some you may have to go down to the bottom and come
back up in a different way.  When searching for stones supply yourself with a
lot of up & down spells, a lot of gems & torches, and always keep 1 exit spell
>made<.  The stones are about the most difficult part of this game next to the
Abyss so don't expect to find them right away.  The approach you should use
when searching is to enter the dungeon, peer at a gem, choose between going to
the ladder (usually requires at least one encounter first) or casting a down
spell.  Each time you peer at a gem look for an altar, it looks something like
an upside-down anvil. When you find it your mini-quest for that stone is about
over.  If you see any of the 'T' symbols surrounding your altar that stands for
^T]raps and could be winds (blow out torches and light spells), falling rocks,
pits, etc.  The '^' symbol stands for an energy field of sleep, poison, fire,
or lighting.  Those can be ^D]ispelled by your Mage or Druide easiest.  When
you get to the altar a ^S]earch commad is necessary to pick up the stone.  All
8 stones will be used in the Abyss (see below), and each will be used in at
least one of the Altar Rooms.



--4-- Word of Passage/Bell/Book/Candle/Wheel

 The Word of Passage is VERAMOCOR.  You can get this by asking the rulers
of the castles: Serpants Hold, Empath Abbey, and The Lycaeum of the ^WORD].
 The bell is located at latitude - N'A" longitude - L'A".
 The book can be found in the library in the Lycaeum, search directly south
of the 'R' in the card catalog.
 The candle is the easiest of the three.  You must first get to the village
Cove (the easiest way is to sail into a whirlpool, then sail south into the
mountains).  Next go to the northeast corner of Cove near the Ankh... dispel
the northwesternmost energy field, go west through the two secret doors then
north into the two-square room and search.
 The wheel will simply help you to get to the Abyss, it is not actually
necessary for the completion of the game.  The coordinates for the wheel
are latitude - N'H" longitude - G'A"


--5/6--  Virtues answers & Axiom covered in Codex section



The Abyss
---------

  The Abyss itself is a dungeon, located at latitude - O'J" longitude O'J".  It
is the most difficult dungeon in the game.  Do not attempt to enter the Abyss
until you feel confident that your character can handle the strongest of
beasts, and many times over.
  I would suggest you not enter the Abyss until you have at least 16 gems, 10
torches, 25 tremmor spells, as well as a lot of Jinx, Dispell, and Kill
Spells.
You'll need a few cure spells because there are a lot of spiders wandering
around between levels.  The single most important of all of the above is the
gems.  You cannot possible make it to the chamber withot mapping each of the 8
levels.  One thing I forgot to mention is that you should pick up the skull at
latitude - P'F" longitude - M'F" and ^U]se it when you are outside of the
Abyss
- More (Y)/N/NS? ns
in order to destroy it.  Now, when you are at the entrance (coord's above,
it's
surrounded by lava), you must: ^U]se ^BELL], ^U]se ^BOOK], ^U]se
^CAND]le..then
just ^E]nter the Great Stygian Abyss....



Abyss Travel
------------

  Many of the rooms have secret exits.  They can all be accessed by either
stepping on the right square, or moving into the right secret door.  If your
gem tells you there should be an exit someplace, step on every square in the
room until you find it.  Usually the place you need to step is near the secret
exit.  You cannot use up or down spells in the Abyss.  The only way to descend
is to reach the altar on each level, then type ^U],^STONE].  At this point a
voice will ask you what virtue stems from some principle(s). Refer back to the
chart at the beginning for the answer, and type it in. You will get a response
like "Use thy stone." which simply means to use the stone that corresponds with
that virtue.  Type in the stone's color, and the altar will disappar and be
replaced by a ladder down.  Proceed down and map the next level.  I will warn
you now that 6 is the most difficult level in the dungeon.  Do not attempt to
take the shortcut, it won't work.  Instead start by entering the secret door
(in this case I mean the one that lets you walk through an apparent wall, it's
marked with something that looks like a roll of '4' on a 6-sided dice).. then
just follow the rooms all the way around (you will have to go through about 8
of them).  When you get to the room with all the balrons, dispell all the
energy fields, kill the balrons (easier said than done), and step on the
squares where they were.  A secret door will open up on the south side of the
room.  You shouldn't have much trouble from that point.
