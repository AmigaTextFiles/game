                          THE DUEL: TEST DRIVE II
                             COMMODORE AMIGA

                                 OOOPs!

Yes, we have fallen prey to the deadly sin of omission. You might want to
read the following instructions if you're having problems following the
instructions on page 11 regarding the creation of a Play Disk. We say it's
simpler than it is, so here's the full explanation. Sorry for any
inconvenience.

1  As it states on page 11, assign the drive for the Play Disk, (i.e. DF0:),
   then press Return. This message will appear: "Insert Play Disk in DF0:,
   Press button to continue"


2  Insert a blank formatted disk into the drive and press the button.
   Another message will appear that states: "DF0: is not a Play Disk. Press
   Press button to continue. Esc to cancel."

3  If you want to use a Play Disk that you've already created, insert that
   disk, press the fire button, then follow the on-screen instructions.
   If you want to create a new Play Disk, Press Esc, and this message
   appears: "Select 'Make Play Disk' to make this disk into a Play Disk."

4  Select Make Play Disk on screen, press the button, then follow the
   on-screen instructions to create the Play Disk.
