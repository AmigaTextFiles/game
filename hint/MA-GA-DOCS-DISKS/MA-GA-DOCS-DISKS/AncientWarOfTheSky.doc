------------

INSTALLATION CONCEPTS

 The Ancient Art of War in the Skies is not copy protected. This
means you can copy the game files from the original disks however
you prefer - to other floppy disks, or to a hard disk These files are
normal in all respects and should not cause special problems when
backing up, restoring, or optimizing a hard disk. However, keep the
original disks handy.

 The Ancient Art of War in the Skies has been left unprotected for
your conyenience in making backup copies and when playlng from a
hard drive. However, making additional copies to give away or sell is a
Copyright Violation. See the Copyright Notice at the end of this
document.

drawer and then on the SKIES game icon.

SAVED GAMES
You may save games currently under way and recontinue them at
a later date. Games may be saved onto your hard drive or onto the
back up floppy Game disk.

In addition, you can use the Move Campaigns, option from the
Campaign Editor to move all the campaigns to your own disk. If you
do this, make sure the Campaign Path in the Game Options is set to
the name of the disk.

LOADING A SAVED GAME

Saved games can be loaded as a pre-game option.


COPY PROTECTION
---------------

The Ancient Art of War In the Skies has no disk copy protection
However, the program asks you a manual related question. Use the
manual to answer the question. MicroProse regrets that continuing
casual and organised software piracy requires that this minimal form
of copy protection is retained.


THE READ ME FILE
----------------

The latest notes regarding this program, additions, revisions etc
can be read from the Game disk by double clicking on a file named
.README TXT.


OPERATING PROBLEMS
------------------

1. INSTALLATION

If you experience difficulties running the Install program you will
have to transfer the files over manually. Use the command below,
from the AmigaShell. With the program disc in the internal driye:

COPY ALL DFO: TO <harddrive partition name>:<directory name>

2. THE ASSIGN COMMANDS

If you own a hard drive, there is an install program on the
software discs that will transfer the files over to the hard drive for you
However, you may have to amend your Startup Sequence after the
files have been transferred so that your computer knows where the
files can be found.

The Assign command is an AmigaDOS statement that redirects the
search the computer makes when looking for a particular file. The
Assign commands must be inserted in your Startup Sequence

 To edit this. type the command, ED SYS:S/STARTUP-
SEQUENCE from the AmigaShell. If you have a favourite Word
Processor or Text Editor you can use that instead. Find the command
LOADWB. Immediately above this you must insert your assign
commands. It is necessary to assign all the discs in the box. The
syntax for the Assign command is:

ASSIGN <SKIES GAME>: <harddrive partition name>:<drawer name>

Repeat for SKIES DOGFIGHT; SKIES BOMB; SKIES AIRBASE

 If using ED, after typing in the Assign Commands, press the ESC
key. then Key X, then press RETURN

 Reboot the computer then start the game.

3. MEMORY

IMPORTANT: If you have insufflcient Chip Memory you may
encounter graphics or sound problems. If this happens you must
remove all external peripherals and try again. You may not be able to
play from the hard drive if the problems persist after removing
external drives etc.

There are two kinds of memory used by the Amiga. Chip Mem
and Fast Mem.

To check how much of each you have double click on the Shell
icon, from WorkBench and type AVAIL and press [Return]

Chip Mem
Chip Memory is used by the custom chips, Agnus, Paula, and
Denise, on the older 16 bit Amigas such as the A5OO and A6OO and
Alice and Lisa on the new 32 bit AGA Amiga computers like the
A12OO and A4OOO, for graphics and sound. It is also used by the
system to operate the internal and external deyices you may have
attached to the computer like printers, floppy driyes, CD drives and
hard discs. Because of this it may be necessary to remove external
drives and/or printers to free up this memory. This is more common
on the older A5OO because it only has 512K of Chip Mem.

On Kickstart 1.2 and 1.3 machines, like the A5OO, have only 512K
of Chip Mem.

On Kickstart 2 x machines, like the A6OO, initially have 1Mb
(Megabyte) of Chip Mem, expandable to 2Mb.

On Kickstart 3 x machines, like the A12OO, start with the
maximum 2Mb of Chip Mem.

Fast Mem
Fast Memory is used only by the 68OOO processor in your Amiga
Programs are loaded automatically into Fast Mem if available and will
run quicker than when loaded into Chip Mem.

Note that only Chip Mem is used by the system to operate devices like
disc drives so please do not confuse the two.

On Kickstart 1.2 and 1.3 machines, any memory added will be Fast
Mem. This includes the trap door expansion under the Amiga 5OO
On Kickstart 2 x such as the A6OO machines, any memory added
after the first 2Mb will be Fast Mem.

On Kickstart 3 x, like the A12OO machine, all extra memory added
will be Fast Mem


EXPLANATION OF TERMS
--------------------

AmigaDOS
This is the Operating System used by the Amiga computer.
The operating system tells the respective parts of the computer
what to do when it receiyes a command from programs.

AmigaShell
This is a direct way of issuing commands to the AmigaDOS. It can
be a little confusing or daunting as the syntax for commands must be
accurate. It is advisable to be familiar with as many Shell commands as
possible.

Kickstart
This is the bulk of the Amiga operating system and is stored on a
chip in the conmputer. There are 3 versions, 1x, 2 x. and 3 x

Startup Sequence
This is a script file which contains a number of commands that are
read in sequence when the Amiga is switched on. It is found in the S
directory of the disc you boot from.

WorkBench
This is a graphic interface for AmigaDOS. It consists of small icons
or pictures that replace the sometimes complex commands used in the
AmigaShell. WorkBench was designed, very much with user
friendliness in mind.

before playing a full war campaign. Select Training from the Clipboard
and skip ahead to the Dogfight or Bombing description on this card

For detailed inscructions, see Book I of the Training Manual.

If you want to jump right into the thick of things follow these
simple steps to start the game:

1 Load the game (see above)
2 From the Airfield Clipboard, select Go to War
3 Answer the question on the Roundel
4 Select a campaign title
5 Select Begin the Campaign
6 The campaign begins when you see the overview map with the
  pictures of your opponents.


OVERVIEW OF A CAMPAIGN

Your primary activity is to send your fighters and bombers which
are stationed an your airfields, on dogfight and bombing missions. When
one of your fighter squadrons encounters an enemy squadron you can
zoom in to a dogfight. When one of your bomber squadrons reaches a
designated target, you can "zoom in" and direct the bombing run.

There are three ways to win:

1 Capture/destroy all enemy airfields/aircraft
2 Capture or destroy any enemy Capital
3 Force the enemy to surrender

You capture territory when the battle front (the jagged double line
that stretches across the map) advances into enemy territory. You can
influence the movement of the front by strategically bombing enemy
targets and the front itself.

For more details on game strategy see Book II of the manual, the
Planning Guide

THE MARKER

You interact with the game at the map level with the Marker.
When over Allied territory (the green side) it is a Roundel. When the
marker is over Central Powers territory (the red side) it is an Iron
Cross. It is used to give instructions to your units and to learn
information about enemy forces. The Marker can be moved with the
arrow keys, mouse or joystick.

You can send a squad on a mission by moving the Marker to one
of your airbases (the Marker will turn into a magnifying glass). Press
<ENTER> and follow the instructions at the top of the screen.

There are 9 types of strategic targets that you can bomb. You can
identify these targets by moving your Marker over them. If it is a valid
target, it will be identified in the window at the top right of the screen

You can also bomb the front
