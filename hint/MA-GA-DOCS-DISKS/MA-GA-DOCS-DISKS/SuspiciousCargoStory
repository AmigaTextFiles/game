Jonah was stood in the dark.  The two guards had awoken him, and half
dragged, half carried him here blindfolded from his cell.  He tried to
focus, but with nothing piercing the darkness, it proved impossible.
The room felt big though, felt cold, and for certain didn't feel
welcoming.

'Jonah Halfbright Aloysius Beehive Telemachus Hayes', a voice boomed,
'You have been found guilty of non payment of the mortgage on your
craft.  You are four months in arrears, with no indication that you can
either maintain payments or make good the lack of payment so far
neglected.'

A spotlight hit the authoritarian figure who was speaking, as his voice
continued to boom and echo around the cavernous room long after he had
finished speaking.  Two guards suddenly appeared, as did a dock, in
which Jonah found himself stood.  He was handcuffed to both guards.
The Judge, as the voice had now become, continued to read out the
charges.

'You are also charged with transporting illegal cargoes through the
known systems, of theft, of deception, of passport forgery, of.. of...
oooh, all sorts of nasty stuff.'  As he spoke, the Judge changed into
Jonah's mother, his most hated teacher, his flying instructor, to a
policeman and back to the Judge again, before starting the whole cycle
over once again.  It struck Jonah as not being quite right.  He was
clever like that.

'How d'yer plead Hayes?' boomed the figure, as it changed into the
shopkeeper who had caught the fourteen year old Hayes stealing a bag of
bullseyes from his shop.  Hayes looked him in the eyes.  A bit difficult
as they kept changing position every time the figure mutated.  This was
his moment, his chance to defend himself, to speak out against the
terrible travesty of justice that was taking place, to make a stand for
the little people, the people like himself with no power, and no
recourse to justice.  He raised his head, threw back his shoulders, and
cleared his throat.  Then he broke wind.
Not quietly or discreetly, but in a way that insured that the Judges
voice wasn't the only thing booming and echoing around the chamber.  The
two guards began to slowly shuffle away from Hayes, the cuff's clinking
as they did.

The Judge turned a funny sort of purply red colour, and screeched:
'Hayes, your contempt of court is sufficient to ensure that you will be
punished severely, without recourse to the charges already brought
against you.  You will serve ten years in the reverse time zone.  You
will be forced to live your childhood once again until such time as you
are seen fit to return to civilised society.  Guards!'

Jonah's stubbly chin dropped.  'Here, no, hang about!  A touch of
indigestion your honour... Mother.. Sir..a glass of Andrews and I'll be
fine.... Gerroff...lemme go.  Oy!  Stop that.  Ow, that hurt.'

The two guards, now armed with electric cattle prods, were forcing him
out of the dock and into a long corridor, at the end of which beams of
light were emanating from a barred door.  As they reached it, the door
sprung open of it's own accord, and Jonah fell in.  The door closed with
a loud slam. and a slow humming began.

Jonah, dripping with sweat, spun round, threw himself against the door,
and began pounding on it.  Then he heard a slow grinding noise join the
ever louder hum.  He turned, and realised that the walls were closing in
on him.

'Ooh no.  Oh blimey.  Heavens to Betsy.  Warg...'  The walls got closer
and closer, squeezing in on him.  He tried to push against each wall in
turn, and to bust the door, but all without success.  The walls
continued to close in, getting closer and closer, tighter and tighter.
Within a minute they were inches away from his face.  He could feel them
getting closer, his breath forcing back into his face, see the tiny
cracks, the mortar, as they began to squeeze him, force the breath out
of his body.

Hayes awoke screaming, his limbs bashing against the sleep coffin walls.
He sat bolt upright, and immediately smashed his head against the coffin
roof.

'Ow.  Ouch......Blimey.  What a nightmare.'

He laid back, the relief patently clear on his face as he allowed his
usual imbelic smile to cross his face.  He cleared the sleep from his
eyes.

'Oh well, on with another day in paradise.'

End.
