Melee Island in a quest to fulfill his life's ambition...to become a
fierce, swashbuckling, bloodthirsty Pirate. Unbeknown to Guybrush,
however, there have been some strange happenings in the area surrounding
Melee Island and the more mysterious Monkey Island. As he walks into
this maelstorm of mystery, Guybrush will soon be very aware that things
are not what they appear to be, that even bloodthirsty pirates can be
scared, and that there's more to being a pirate than swinging a sowrd
and drinking grog!
Here's where you come in.... You direct the actions of Guybrusg as he
first explores Melee Island and then ventures on to Monkey Island. On
Melee Island, Guybrush will have to prove himself worthy of becoming a
pirate be completing The Three Trials. Through the course of completing
these trials, you can Guybrush will learn much about pirate life and
local folklore. But dont be suprised if you find that some of the people
you meet seem rather anarchronistic!

another puzzle first or find and use an object. But hang in there and
