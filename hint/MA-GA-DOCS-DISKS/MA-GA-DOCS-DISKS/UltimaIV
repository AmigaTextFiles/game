CHARACTER CREATION.
There is a way to determine your character's class. When the Gypsy asks you
to  choose  one  of  the  virtues  -  Honesty, Compassion, Valour, Justice,
Sacrifice, Honour, Spirituality or Humility over another, the higher virtue
appears  on  the  LEFT  as   choice  'A'.  The  eight classes - Mage, Bard,
Fighter,  Druid,  Tinker,  Paladin,  Ranger  or  Shepherd correspond to the
virtues  in  this  manner: If you choose all 'A' answers, you'll be a Mage;
Seven 'A' answers and then a 'B' will make you a Bard, and so on. The Bard,
with  his  sling,  and  the  Mage,  with  spell-casting ability, begin with
distinct advantages. The size of monster parties on the surface is based on
the  size  of  your group, so unless you enjoy lots of large-scale battles,
don't enlist any party members (except maybe a Mage) until you've become an
Avatar.

CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT.
Half  the  game  is  devoted  to  developing  the virtues. (see the DUNGEON
section for the secret to building strength and other traits). Hawkwind, in
Lord  British's Castle, will inform you of your progress. The numbers match
the  order  of  the virtues previously listed and 99 means you're ready for
elevation.  Talk  to  everyone  you  meet.  Actions are also important, and
improper actions will cost you points. To earn Honesty points, never steal,
pay  less  than  a shop's quoted price or lie. The trick question is: "Have
you  never  lied?",  whose correct answer is "No". For Compassion, give one
piece  of  gold  to  beggars.  Valour is attained by victorious combat, but
don't  attack  non-evil creatures or you'll lose Justice and Honour points.
And  if you attack them while they're fleeing you'll lose Honour! It's O.K.
to  fight  them  if  they  attack.  Never flee from combat unless in mortal
danger,  or you'll lose Valour. Honour is attained by not cheating in shops
and  by  finding the runes, stone, bell, book and candle. Give blood when a
Healer  asks  for  donations  to  earn  Sacrifice  points.  You  gain a few
Spirituality  points  each  time you talk to Hawkwind. For Humility, always
say  "No"  when  asked  if  you're proud of something or best at anything -
unless asked if you are the MOST HUMBLE.

                              THE MOON GATES

Each gate has THREE phases, which can be determined by the three-part cycle
of  the  moons.  The first number below refers to the gate as you enter it,
the last three to your destination.

Gate  Vicinity    Activation        Lat.  Long.    1st     2nd   3rd

COMBAT & MAGIC.
Prepare  lots of spells and carry some extra reagents. Missile weapons like
slings  are  especially  valuable.  If  you  step back instead of advancing
towards  monsters in the combat arena, they will often move into the firing
line.  You  can  outrun  them on a horse. One effective combat tactic is to
line your crew into two columns. See the Virtues section on Valour, Justice
and  Honour  for  other  combat  tips.  Some  spells aren't revealed in the
manual: Gate Travel (a f h), Undead (a c), Resurrect (a b c d e h).

THE QUEST BEGINS.
The first stage of this solution is from the viewpoint of a Mage. To follow
it  with  another  class,  use the Moon Gates to reach Moonglow. Search the
chest  next to Mariah for the Rune of Honesty. Don't buy any magic herbs if
just  starting  out. Instead, visit the Lycaeum on the Northwest coast. Ask
the  Baron about the word and he'll say: "VER" which is part of the Word Of
Passage. Enter the Moon Gate, West of Moonglow during a New moon and search
for  the  Stone  of  Humility.  Enter  during  the  next New moon and go to
Britannia.

SECRETS OF LORD BRITISH'S CASTLE.
Go  East  in  the Castle, open the door and find the WHITE DOT on the North
wall.  These  mark  secret doors. Go North to the dot leading East; outside
you'll find Joshua and a riddle. Re-enter the passage and go North into the
Northeast  Castle  Rampart.  Go  West to meet Shawn for tips on Humility. A
ladder  in  this rampart leads to the second level and the Prison; a secret
door  leads West to behind the Castle and a ladder to the Dungeon Hythloth.
A  Healer  is  due  South of the first secret door. On the West side of the
Castle  you'll  find Hawkwind through the first door AFTER moving South. Go
North  and  East  through  the door just South of the ladder. Search in the
LOWER RIGHT CORNER for the Rune of Spirituality. Head upstairs to meet Lord
British,  who  will  heal you if asked about Health and you say "No". He'll
also promote you to higher levels when you've earned it.

BRITAIN AND PAWS.
Buy  a  Sling. At the end of the long hall North of the Inn, search for the
Rune  of  Compassion. Enter the secret door in the Healer's and Julio about
nature  for Honesty points. Keep the sea in sight while moving South. Cross
the  two  bridges  going  East  and  enter  Paws. Buy a horse. South of the
Stables,  just  below  the Stablehand, search for the Rune of Humility. The
Herb Shoppe is behind a secret door in the Armoury.

BLOODY PLAINS AND MANDRAKE ROOT.
You need 900 gold for your next major purchase, so kill lots of monsters on
the  way  to Lord British's Castle. Get healed and head East from Moon Gate
2,  crossing  the  bridge  and  moving  East until you see mountains to the
North.  Go  North,  passing  the  eastern  bridge,  and  circle  Lock Lake.
Southeast  of  the  lake you'll spy a pass through the foothills that leads
East  and  exits  into the Bloody Plains to the Northeast. To find Mandrake
Root,  stand on the SINGLE SQUARE OF SWAMP and search during a New Moon. Go
due  East  through  a  small mountain pass that leads North and you'll find
Vesperon the South coast.

VESPER.
Don't  enter  without  900 gold. Then visit the Guild and ask about ITEM D.
Use  it  to get your bearings; most of the sites listed in the charts used,
employ  these co-ordinates. You can also pick up Humility points in Vesper,
whose walls are lined with secret doors.

ON THE ROAD AGAIN.
Head  back  to  Lord  British,  yelling  at  the  horse  to hurry if you're
seriously  wounded.  After  checking  with him and Hawkwind you're ready to
travel  the  land  and build up your character by earning 99 points in each
virtue  and  acquiring  the  runes and mantras needed to enter the shrines.
Complete  this for all virtues and you'll have attained Partial Avatarhood.
First  go  to  Paws  and  stock up on ginseng and garlic, then use the Moon
Gates  and  the  sextant to reach the following locations for the necessary
items  or  information.  Later  you  can  raise lots of gold by finding the
Mystic  Armour and weapons; sell them and return for more, and repeat until
rich.  Ships won't appear until later in the game, and Jhelom or Skara Brae
are good places to find one.

                         Paws - Humility.
                 (People will tell you where to find them)

The  only tricky one is Valour; at Lord Robert in Jhelom, go South and West
through secret doors and search in the SOUTHEAST RAMPART.

                                THE SHRINES

You  need  a boat to reach Honesty, Valour and Humility; the Silver Horn is
needed for the latter, which s approached from M'A", O'H" by boat.

ON YOUR OWN.
Now  use  the Moon Gates and sextant to find things listed in the following
table  in any order you choose. You need a ship to reach Serpent's Hold and
the Stygian Abyss.

THE BALLOON AND THE WHITE STONE.
Enter the Hythloth Dungeon behind Britannia, exit immediately and enter the
Balloon.  Climb  and  descend  to fly it, and use wind spells to steer. Fly
West and North to the Serpent's Spine mountain range and land at the Avatar
Symbol  for  the White Stone. You can also fly to Cove on the East shore of
Lock Lake, otherwise accessed by entering a whirlpool while on a ship.

ELEVATION AND EQUIPMENT.
When  you  have  all  eight  runes and mantras and are ready for elevation,
meditate at each shrine for three minutes. After acquiring the items listed
previously  and  talking to everyone for clues, buy the best weapons: three
Magic Wands, three Magic Bows, one Crossbow, one Sling, and Armour for each
character.  Stock  up  on Reagents and food, then say "Join" to everyone in
the  eight  major towns to recruit your party. The only tricky ones are the
Shepherd  (enter  Magincia,  exit the gate and go South along the wall) and
Geoffrey,  the  Fighter in Jhelom who won't join until your party reaches a
high enough level. Now head for the Dungeons.

INTO THE DUNGEONS.
Two  goals  await:  Finding  the Stones at the Altars and using them in the
Altar  Rooms to get the 3-part Key. The Dungeons are connected by the Altar
Rooms, but all three Altars can be found in Hythloth - so you can save time
by  visiting  it  after  acquiring all eight stones instead of going to the
Altar  Rooms  in  the  other  Dungeons.  The  Stones are also necessary for
getting   through   the   Stygian  Abyss.  You  can  raise  your  Strength,
Intelligence  and Dexterity by touching Magical Balls in the Dungeons. This
will  cost the character some hit points, which can be restored with a Heal
Spell.  The  sections  on  each  Dungeon  tell how to find these balls, the
Stones  and  the  Altars.  Peer  at a gem when you first enter a Maze, then
check it again and compare with the directions if you get disorientated.

You  can  do  them  in  any  order;  this path leads through the ones whose
Magical  Balls  do  the  LEAST  damage,  to  avoid depleting hit points too
quickly.  You'll have to decide which characters should touch a Ball, since
they  only  work  once. When told to go UP or DOWN, in these sections, this
refers  to  using  ladders,  NOT  casting  those  spells.  The Dungeons are
connected  by  the  Altar  Rooms, so always leave by the door you entered -
especially  in  Dungeons  accessible  only by boat. Otherwise you'll emerge
outside a faraway Dungeon when you cast an X-it Spell.
