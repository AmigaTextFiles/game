Here are some hints to help you in Great Courts because the game is really 
harder than Great Courts 1 or Tennis Cup...                              
                                                                         
- Give more power to the forehand, backhand etc And a little bit less for
  the smash and the service. But be sure to keep a good stamina.        

- The training mode is a good way to increase your power. Try it for a long
  time and your player will get better and better.                       

- When you play your first matches against the computer, you will probably
  lose 6-0  6-0  6-0...  But don't desesperate, always try to send your balls 
  from left to right and left and again and when you see that the computer
  have some problems, run to the volley and destroy him.

- In tournament mode, it is better to save at the end of each match. It is 
  also better to start with the small competitions.                         
                                                                            
                                                                            
So now, good luck!
