OK, that sounds fair. I thought that the pukes on the net were being rude,
and rather whiney about their problems. Maybe I was too, just a little,
but in my ignorance, felt justified, due to the lack of communication on
this unmentioned (unyil now) point of admonition. Thanks again, John,

Thank you Michel, for your very gracious 'withdrawal' from the ranks of the
whiners about Frontier. Yes, Frontier does have its bugs, but they are all
more irritant than fatal and are mostly avoidable. I have a couple to report
myself through Dino, but I also know how to avoid them. Frontier is still an
incredible achievement and one of my sons has now had a superb introduction
to the physics of spaceflight and knowledge of our Solar System, besides
enjoying himself thoroughly (the best spent $38 in a long time). 

Guys (and gals), or gentlemen and ladies (for the world outside the US),
let us use all use somewhat less of the net bandwidth in <destructive>
criticism of Frontier. Factually document the bugs ( including the version
number of the executable, and whether it is the Amiga or IBM version !) and
send them to Dino Dini (amiga@hosta.dircon.co.uk). Obviously, feel free to
document them here too......

David Braben has spent several years of his life putting Frontier together; I
am certain that he will upgrade the program to remove the most irritating
bugs and will make it available publicly somehow. If I were he, I would wait
a little while to allow *ALL OF US Frontier users* to complete OUR beta-tests
before executing the update.

The bugs aren't annoying and you can avoid them but that's not the problem
of Frontier. The problem is that it lacks the stuff that would fascinate
you over a long period. There are no surprises...no real special missions...
no tribbles.
These elements are a must for a game that has to be played several weeks.
It's missing the final touch and that's the reason i think the distributor
released it to early to make some cash because of XMas.

I don't say anything about the 3d engine....it's really superb.

I really hope he releases Frontier+ with a better gameplay.
Anyway..it will probably be the most selling Amiga game up to now.
(I know so many people that have bought it)



BTW: This is not whining. At the beginning i also wondered why some finns
     critizied the depth of the game but after playing a while i
     have to agree with them. Only 2-3 months to fix the small bugs,
     add a real story + gimmicks and tune the gameplay , it would be
     perfect like Elite1

    That's the point of the bulletin board, isn't it? To provide a
    wider range of missions much more often than Elite I ever did.

Well, there's a graveyard next to every little church in the cities...
the church comes complete with a working clock on the steeple, too. (It
doesn't chime the hour, though. Shame on you, Braben! :) )

I hope that's not what you're referring to...?

	Just two little questions?

(1)	What is the graveyard? It sounds as though it is some final resting
	place for old ships, and I remember that there was a mention of one
	in ``Elite'', in the novella ``The Dark Wheel.''

(2)	Where did you hear about it from? And how do all these people keep
	on hearing about various bits and pieces in ``Frontier'', when there
	is no mention of them in any of the manuals? Although I've only been
	playing the game for a few days.

	Thanks in advance,

   Awww. And I thought the 'graveyard' meant that David Braben, through
BLAZEMONGER techniques, happen to also implement 'Hired Guns' into his
code so that if you had Cheule, Rorian, Jennille, or the others as 
passengers, you'll be able to play a campaign. :) :) :) :)

Frontier GUIDE - update...


We've had LOADS of excellent responses by too many people to name, but rest 
assured email addresses have been noted, we will try and write back a.s.a.p. 

All the beastly tips we've had are being compiled for a furture GUIDE, so keep
talking!!!

Well it's now Wednesday, Saturday was when we wrote THE GUIDE, and as you may 
have guessed we are still playing the game, so here's some new stuff!!



Matt c2mjw@dum.ac.uk - Amiga
Dave c2djm@dum.ac.uk - PC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


COMBAT

You may have noticed that in the first guide we missed out a combat section, but
on finding out from various mail we recieved that most commanders were Average
or above, we thought you obviously know how to fight, but here are some points
some of you may not know... 

Note: For the uninformed Port = left, Starboard = right

EASY KILLS 




Matt's - Thrust 'an spin (Amiga)

This is a good one, one I always use anyway!! Ships usually come from infront 
and straight for you!! So why not try this...

Turn about 10 degrees to the port or starboard, and hit some forward thrust.
Look at your scanner to see when the sucker is about alongside. Then spin round 
to face him and hit full thrust after him, keeping him in your sights. You 
should now be on his tail. Obviously you can choose when to shoot - I can't tell
you that, but I like trying to sit on a ship's tail and see how long I can stay 
there. This tactic works supprisingly well on the smallest of ships, too.




Matt's - Chicken run (Amiga)

This is very effective if you have a 4 - 20MW beam laser, and is very quick to
despatch the skilless little squidler ships that turn up blue on the scanner (I 
think thats about 0 - 16t).

Again this works best when a ship comes from directly in front, but still 
effective when they come from any other direction.

When under attack turn to face the other ship as quick as you can, and then turn
only about 5 degrees the the port or starboard (just enough for the other ship 
to miss when shooting) and hit forward thrust just to get him in range of your 
guns. Then hit reverse thrust for a bit, for him to approach more slowly, then
cut the engines again. Get him in your sights and shoot a short distance ahead
of him, stop turning. The other ship should run straight into your laser. 

This is a bit risky for a big enemy ship with good guns, 'cos he may just turn 
to face you as well, but if done properly they don't have the chance as they're 
already space dust. Little ships however, never have the firepower to trouble 7
shield generators, and are normally wasted by the time they get close enough to 
shoot.




Dave's - Stuka dive (PC)

When a ship attacks from a position close to the front, slam the engines on full
forward thrust and pull up. Look at the scanner to see when the target is nearly
directly below (don't thrust too much or he'll be out of range. Cut the engines
and turn 180 degrees straight down at the enemy ship and thrust forwards letting
rip, try to shoot slightly ahead of him as well. He can't shoot at you from this
position. A beam laser is what is really required for this. Works best on the 
medium class of ship.




EVASIVE MANOUVERS/COUNTER ATTACKS



Matt's - Twister (Amiga, and PC apparently)

A good one for when getting seriously hammered by laser fire. I do this when in
total panic, ie getting shot by some Elite pilot with a beam laser.

If getting shot from head-on (it does happen sometimes) I use this little number
to get out of the laser fire and onto the enemy ship's tail.

Basically if getting shot from the front I turn 90 degrees hard port and hit 
forward thrust forward for a couple of seconds. Then I pull up 180 degrees and 
thrust forward to face the path of the enemy by which time he's just about 
flying past. Then you can return fire when he goes past or turn 90 degrees to 
the port and thrust forward after him. Confusing without a diagram isn't it!!



GENERAL

These are just some of the tactics we use for a laff and for an impresive fight.
Use them if you will, but I ALWAYS find I turn my engines off and use forward 
and reverse thrust to get my out of trouble or into a kill scoring position.

Also I have noticed that on the Amiga and PC versions sometimes the sound FX for
getting hit doesn't work, and the only way you can tell if you getting hit is if
you see the hull getting damaged! One way of noticing if you're getting hit is
to look for a laser hitting the egde of the display, a laser will NEVER fill 
your display. Try going to an external view zooming in and shooting the camera, 
you'll see what I mean. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SHOOTING MISSILES

Not much use this one, more for fun really. YES! Missiles can be shot whether 
you are travelling towards a planet, or not! Missiles at one point or another 
will come from behind - either launched from a ship from behind, or manouvering
themselves into that position. 

Turn your engines off. When a missile is behind hit full forward thrust (if 
you're in a half-decent ship it won't quite hit you). Wait until the missile is
about 0.5 - 1.5km behind, by either targeting it or looking at the scanner, then
spin round 180 degrees and hit reverse thrust. Now let rip!! Missiles are more
visible if you turn the text on and missile will appear alongside the, er, 
missile. It is difficult to hit though and you definately need a beam laser!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


USING MISSILES

Most of you may have noticed that missiles are completely useless in combat, cos
the target keeps on running away. Not so!! Have you every tried launching a 
missile at a target and then hitting the time skip? Well presuming the target
doesn't have somesort of ECM system he should get blown away!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We've read loads of letters that state you need 3,000 shields, just to live not 
so! At the minute I (Matt) have down graded from my Tiger Trader, after 
forgetting that the gun turrets are just too confusing to use after a prelonged 
period shooting ships with a front mounted laser, to an Asp. At the minute both 
of us are doing runs for the Federal military (Not Imperial SCUM!!) in Asp's 
with a Class 4 hyperdrive, NO shields, 4MW beam laser, Scanner, Radar mapper 
and an autopilot. I still haven't come close to getting wasted. 

We hope that some of the above tactics will help convince some of you that you
don't need shields, but just good combat knowlegde.

Oh, by the way Matt's had 2 "Right on commander"'s from Elite Federation, now,
what are these for? A certain number of kills? A good kill?

Well that will have to be it for now, we've got loads of coursework to do so we
had better get on with it...

Bye

Email us if you find anything new.

Commanders Welford and Maddison signing off....

Yeah, that was definately Echelon.  I remember it well.  I also remember the picture

Ah well, chalk up another one to vaporware...

Interesting, how far away did you zoom? My version (Amiga V1.00) shows
just mirror images of the Milky Way.

extremely large numbers of hours. I reckon Ive already tripled the number

What about writing some patches? I hear they have made at least V1.02 of
Frontier, but I am stucked with V1.00. Making the upgrade as a patch, and
uploading it to Aminet shouldn't be very difficult. Hope they will release
an AGA-only version with texture mapping as well; it should run fast enough
on an A4000.

And by the way; are anyone reading these bug-reports? (feedback!)

    Did the question of which lines to count when answering a spot

    you get it wrong a certain number of times, then you can't leave
    whatever station you're at. When you try, you get made an example
    of, and wind up dead.

    Because it happens when you try to leave the station rather than
    after you enter the last wrong answer, it means that your save
    file (that you made just before trying to leave :) becomes
    unusable also.

Agh, pipped to the post - I was compiling a list too :).  

I would like to add the following -

==================================================================================================

BUG: Laser graphics messed up with Lion transport

DESCRIPTION: If you fire a front-mounted laser from a Lion transport, instead of a nice line
of light receding into the dsitance, you get a screenfull of laser coloured polygons that
completely obscure the viewscreen.  Putting a laser in the turret does much the same, but
the effect depends on the elevtion of the turret.

FIX: Other than fly another ship, none known.

----

The following isn't exactly a bug, but is *VERY* annoying:

BUG(?): Warning message obscures scanner

DESCRIPTION: When attacked, the message "WARNING: ship under attack" obscures the
scanner.

FIX: None known.



=================================================================================================

How about sending this list to Gametek?

If they have patches, are they willing to post them on the Net?

For those without access to the net, might they be willing to distribute patches on
the cover of one of the better PC/Amiga games mags?

If we don't get a sensible response, how about sending the list of bugs to one of the
aforementioned magazines and seeing what reponse they get?

I have another suggestion... we don't necessarily need to do this much.
There should be _two_ autopilot systems. One is capable of getting you from
any point in space to the atmosphere of a planet, moving at a safe re-entry
speed; the other can guide you from one point on a planet's surface to
another.

As an example: You're going from Titan City to New San Francisco. You
pick New SF on the system map and off you go... Autopilot 1 just takes
you straight to Earth, leaving you sitting somewhere on Earth 40,000
meters up. It hands off control to Autopilot 2, which flies you around
the planet on a Great Circle route to New San Francisco and lands you.

The beauty of this is you can also do long transcontinental or
oceanic flights while still being able to admire the view... if you
fly from New SF to New York, Autopilot 2 is handling you the whole time
and safely flies you there. You can fly at any time compression you
want, of course; no cheating is necessary.

The autopilots don't necessarily have to be _brilliant_ -- there needs
to occasionally be something for the human pilot to do. If, say, Jupiter
interposes itself between you and Earth, that's bad luck and you must
take manual control to get around it. Other than that, the autopilot is
extremely safe.

I like this idea. What do others think?

I don't think too many people have commented on this, but it seems to
me that the reason the autopilot crashes so frequently when landing on planets
is this:

The autopilot plots it's course to your destination on a _straight line_
This means that if you are on the opposite side of a plantet from the port
you are landing on, the auto pilot is trying to get there by *going through
the planet*.  In order for this to be fixed, a whole system of navigation
while avoiding solid objects needs to be implemented.  As it stands, all there
seems to be is 'Go straight from point A to point B'

Now that still doesn't address the fact that the autopilot almost always does
not slow down in time to avoid crashing in to objects, even vwhen it is pro-
perly aligned with them.  This is probably csaused by figuring all movment
based on the power of the main thrusters. (Which are more powerful than
the retros) To fix this, the autopilot shluld either flip the ship, so tha6t
it actually does use the main thrusters to slow the ship, ur or adjust the
calculations using the trhust of the drive it is actually going to use.

(Of course it a is also possible that it is caused by the relative - to
- wrong- body bug)

Well, Im a PC user, I went to (-146,85) and found
Beta Lyrae - guess what. It dumped on me too. This
appears to be a bug in both Amiga and PC - it must
be actual incorrect coding, rather than a specific
machine particular bug. I actually run Frontier on
a 486dx2/66 - scrolling around the galaxy takes 
seconds (2 secs to get to -146,85). 

I tried this out under DOS and Windows. DOS just
locks up the machine. In a windows DOS BOX it 
causes a 'General Protection Error' - ie its
getting buggered in memory allocation or accessing.
Windows then works strangely! Major f**k up.

This is one to fix. 

Any other interesting locations out there? Id like
to see if PC and Amiga correlate. Reply email and
Ill compile a list.

G'day all,

I've read the stuff about how a 1200 version could run as smooth 
as the old one on a 4000. Great, so it COULD be totally awesome, right ? 

But the question is... Is it actually being written ?

I want Frontier but I would like a debugged AGA version even more.

Anyone with any firm info ?  Thanx..

I'm surprised nobody noticed this yet.  Everybody seems to think that the 
multi-galaxy thing is some kinda of bug.  I think it's actually the 
scheme they used to compress the galaxy.  I'm sure everybody has heard 
of fractal compression at one time or another but has never really seen 
it, well I havn't seen a better example yet.  The multi-galaxy thing tips 
it off, what really gives it away is something I tried once.  I stuck a 
nickel in the zoom out key on the galaxy map, left for awhile, came back, 
took the nickel out, and guess what I saw.

I saw one big dotty milky way made out of many many small milky ways.  
Now it could be jumping the gun, but I think that leads to the 
conclussion that Frontier uses fractal compress to store the galaxy, and 
why you see other galaxys when you zoom out, those galaxies form one big 
galaxy, and a bunch of those big galaxys from a really big galaxy and so 
on..

(I did this on a PC, but I'm sure it's the same for Amiga)

Sounds good, and might explain the apparent small size for the
data (1 720k disk basically). If its being used here, it could 
also be used for graphics detail (would give pleasant rendering).
Its a lossy technique, so it cant be used for code but other 
techniques have been used - even the save files are compressed
in some way (good compression too).

Fractal compression is also a very fast system when decompressing.
It takes ages to compress data, but it can be faster to decompress
an image (or whatever) and display than to display an original!

==============================================================================
Okay. This is going to sound really stupid.

I'm trying to work out how the co-ordinate system works in Frontier.
My objective is simple. Some time in the game, I want to fly to
Alpha Sagittarius, a star some 200 LY from Sol in the Real World.

Why? Err, we`ll leave that for now, thank you.

I know that the sectors are 8ly on a side, and using RA-declination
information from a star map I`ve got the positions of most of the local
stars mapped correctly. There seems to be a few weird things in the
Frontier universe.

First, the galaxy is too thin. On the Frontier map, Polaris should be
directly above us, near enough. Instead it is about 1000 ly out of position,
being to the `north` of us on the map. Brabaen seems to have moved the galaxy
around a bit creating the map, and trying to find anywhere from `real-life`
star maps is a bit tricky.

If anyone else has tried to map the universe, could they drop me
a line, please. Also, could you please keep a look-out for
Alpha Sagittarius, AKA Rukbat. It should be somewhere about 200LY
NW of Sol, (RL co-ordinates 19`25Rigt Ascension -41` declination)


Thanks, and good luck out there. I'm the gyu in the Mk.III with the sharks
teeth :) (Another point. Do Cobra Mk.III`s come in any colour save grey?)

While toying around with the map, I happened to be scrolling around out in
the Perseus Arm of the galaxy, and chanced upon a bunch of inhabited
systems. All listed Precious Metals and Gemstones as minor exports, and six
out of the nine systems I located have a starport or orbital station(s).
Since one of the systems is designated "System #25", I can only assume that
some of the "unexplored" systems in the area have settlements also. 

Someday, perhaps I'll visit them. The big drawback, of course, is that they
are over twelve thousand light years away from Sol... quite a few jumps in
the best of ships. Being that they're so far away from everything else,
and they all have the same imports/exports, one also has to wonder where
their supplies come from, too... Hmmm... perhaps that area deserves a more
prolonged examination.

Amiga Frontier 1.00. Fortunately this is a rare bug.

Dock into a space station and press ESC as soon as possible, and load or
save a game (I don't remember which one I did).

After this, if the game was just about to ask you a letter from manual
before you hit ESC, it might have messed up the page, line and word
numbers. To me it said something like type third letter of word 65362
of page 61537 (I didn't write down the exact numbers).

Of course I had that patch which removes the manual protection (no, I
don't have a pirate copy!), so I was able to continue (answered 'z' :-).

Another bug: if you have some messages waiting their turn (like several
"Good riddance" or "Package delivered succesfully"), and save the game at
that point, it gets confused and shows strange messages. Like "Message
from xjshgdtfwyt (messy characters)", or "Message from Valkyrie:
Grieg: Hall of Mountain King" (something like that, seemed to list the
music options :-).

I don't know about this.  I use Militaries all the time and they totally kick
arse!  I have not tried the mining lasers on Thargoids but I do know that a
military front and rear and you are gonna kick their butts almost all the
time!

On the whole it is rare for an enemy to get close enough to open fire.

I've tried several times to accomplish different "removing" missions in
Frontier. The problem is only that then I get to the spacestation/port and
waits for the prey; 1) My spaceship just explodes   or 2) there never comes
any prey flying by (eg: out of the spaceport).
Example:

I get a mission to kill Mr. Mackenzie of Foam Metals Corp. for $11000. He is
riding a Puma Clipper (just Puma in the manual) with registration IN-107. He
will be leaving Epsilon Eridani (1,0), Fortress Cousens the 24'th October at
10:02:00. So far so good...
I then trade my ship for a Asp Explorer, equip it with a Class 3 Drive and some
other stuff so I can make a big jump from Beta Hydri to Epsilon E. I then make
the jump, and comes to Fortress Cousens the 23'th October around 23:00. So I
wait for him from a distance, but when the clock strikes 10:02:00 no-one comes
out!(?)

Is this a bug or am I just doing this wrong? I've done several attempt to find
the preys both in spacestations and in spaceports on different planets. Can
someone help...

And by the way; The map (and the story book) states that I need a permit to
land on van Maanens Star, but I can land there anytime without anybody
requesting such a ting. Another bug?

And to the end; Does anybody know about any organisation which works for
commercializing space and make it free for anybody. Like:"It's a human right

such organization, maybe we should make it? Anyone interested?

Has anyone seen Frontier for the IBM platform in the States? If so where
can it be ordered mail order? I have an Amiga and IBM and am interested
in the PC version since the Amiga version is supposed to be slow on a
stock 68000. Here are my setups:
 
Amiga 500, 512k chip ram, 5 megs ram total, 68000.
IBM clone, 386DX40 mhz, 4 megs ram, Soundblaster 16asp, super vga.
 
So would I be better off with the PC version or Amiga version? Either
way, i'm going to get the game just have not been able to find it in the
states for the PC. I don't want to make the same mistake I did with
Syndicate. The IBM version was very impressive vs the Amiga version on
the machines I have. Please, no flames I just want to get the best game
for my particular setups.
 
Thanks..

I can tell you what _I've_ found... I zoomed out 16Mlyrs, and all I got was
thousands of exactly similar galaxies in a grid. Moving the cursor over to a
neighboringgalaxy showed that they were both the Milky Way (there was a
Sol at 0,0 in both galaxies, and both of them had a purple 'you are here' at
that very spot...).

So, it seems that atleast v1.00 has only one galaxy.

Now after i've upgraded to a new ship(s) and try to land at Sirocco my hull
keeps getting damaged. The same when i leave. Unless i speed up the game
time. I've checked the manual to make sure i did the right thing.

Haven't had any problems as long as i keep away from Sirocco.

Not that Sirocco is _that_ exciting place to be.

Didn't notice anything special about requirements in the manual either
(unless 1 Meg counts :-).

I'm running it on a A2000 with 2 HD (Not SCSI or IDE). 1 Meg Chipmem,
4 Meg Fastmem and OS 2.04.

Perhaps someone know if Gametek has an email address?

Sounds like your problem is caused by a lack of atmospheric shielding.  Buy 
that (only 1ton) and all should be well.  It only affected you at Sirocco 
because of the atmosphere at that planet.  Alternatively, just vist space 
stations if you haven't the spare space.

Check your manual at page 73, line 13. You might need that piece of
equipment, or perhaps it is damaged?

I tried to implement this patch to remove the checking but it seems I'm

Yup. Things do appear to be a bit off.
I thought beta lyrae was supposed to be around 830Ly away... oh well.

The pleiades are somewhat interesting (at 32,32).

I'm hopping around from anywhere1 to anywhere2 in a fully loaded panther clipper
using typically 8 (<=15) tons (class 8 hyperdrive in 2000 ton ship remember).
The wormhole jumps I especially like are: (format = starA-starB/via StarC)
 Phekda-Edhoeth/Exanex(-67,50); anarchic and disputed systems

I didn't see it in the binary. I doubt that it is there.

is that rukbat or rubkat? (fur flies onto sweater... ;-] )

I see a lot of questions in this newsgroup which could easily be answered by
looking in the manual. Since the questions are still there I assume a lot
of illegal copies are around (as always).

I would suggest not to answer these kind of questions in the future because
this really is a game which is worth buying and good sales might result in
an Elite III - beyond the frontier???

Is there a special newsgroup for Elite/Frontier?

If not it is time one is made!

Hey man, thats fighting talk where I come from....

Na, but really, most of the req:s are from lazy guys who cant be bothered to 
wade through the manual to find stuff.
Its like the bloody yellow pages in there.
See weapons section, see some other section.....
Its really badly put together.

And another thing, the ship descriptions are crap.

Why oh Why, does the Amiga always get the short straw when it comes to multi
format games like Frontier.

The PC version is huge taking up nearly 4 meg and absolutely brill.
The Amiga version is just a 600K odds file and is quite a let down. It jerks
around unless you have an accelerated machine and the graphics for ships is
the usual bland polygons.
The PC version has nice GFX, crap sound (unless you have a sound board) and
the ships are all surface mappedso they look like real ships.

I personally think the Amiga can do alot better than this.
They could have made it A1200/A4000 only or brought out a seperate A500
version.

Konami can`t use the old `Piracy` argument as piracy on the PC is even more
widespread than on the Amiga since PC games very rarely use copy protection
so the games can be installed on a HD.

Come on software developers, give the Amiga a chance and write good software
that uses all of the features on the Amiga instead of going for port overs.

OR do we just have to expect such craftmanship from TEAM 17.

For starters, you probably saw it on a 486, and as the pc hits the harware hard
(no pun intended) it needs 4 mb to do the same thing.
As for the mapped ships?
Yeah right, a ship made of bricks!!!
Thats the only difference I saw on a 486, comparing it to the 020..
(ok slightly faster frame rate, but it wasnt that noticable...)
The only good thing is that it cuts down on the lighting flicker
You cant go around comparing an A500 with a 7mhz 68000 to a 33Mhz 486
Compare it to the 68040 and then get back to us...
Or try out frontier on a 286 and compare the 500 to that!

You're right, the amiga can do a lot better.
Dave is going to bring out an optimised 020 and above version, but I for on hope
he DOESNT include the texture mapping, unless its made a bit more realistic.

The problem is of numbers of machines.
The developers dont have a scooby how many aga machines are out there, and 
dont want to commit themselves to writing stuff only for a format that is in the
minority.
Apart from that, Using loads of aga stuff is too slow on a stock 1200, so you
would only complain.

>OR do we just have to expect such craftmanship from TEAM 17.

>Comments Please.

>Android.

I think we need to wait unitl either the AAA set comes out, or till more people
actually own aga, compared to those who dont.
If you want to blame someone, blame the 'I dont want to upgrade brigade'
(not those who cant afford it mind you..)
If more people had aga, hd's etc, then more stuff would get written for it.
Esp if all amigas came with hd, then co's would start writing stuff.
I mean nearly all pc now have svga, hd's hd floppies, 4mb ram.
This is the basic standard the pc developers have.
Now on amiga:
ecs 600 with 68000 no hd as standard ddensity floppies 1MB ram.
Now have you got the picture>???

I also noticed that while the program is only one file, (the Amiga
version at least) can be compressed (using power-packer) down to a 
file of less than 400k, and it still runs fine! A very large game 
for just 400k!

When you chose search for offset in newzap, did you put a $ infront of
the given offset? Otherwise it thinks you are inputing decimal and not
hex, and so goes to the wrong location.

I would really like to see the ability to have one target for combat and one for

You don't need to actually target a ship to destroy it, you know..
AND it's a whole lotta more fun too! 
I just turn off the autopilot, take a few shots at the ship, and turn it
back on. Only if it's a really small ship I can't hit I lock it and send
a missile after it.
And another thought: Have you never noticed that many small ships come in packs
of three? Because of the time-compression bug they appear one at a time,
but if you're attacked by a fighter, you just hit max. time accel. and the
next ship will appear.

Just my 2 cents..

	I used to use mining lasers in Elite on the Spectrum and BBC versions,
and found them to be highly effective. Generally 3-4 hits would wipe out any
opposition, and they rarely overheated. In the immortal words of SMASH TV, 
"Total Carnage! I love it!"

	Last night I got around to trying them out in Frontier. I loaded up a
Cobra Mark I (which for some reason I've taken a liking to) with various
components, and mounted one of these on the bow. The idea was to find an
unstable system and see how various configurations worked.

	The result, well I died.... Violently.

	Currently my accuracy with lasers is rather low, and I tend to find
that I cannot hit with anything short of a beam laser. The mining lasers seem
to have a very small zone of effect, and I could have sworn that I was aiming
dead center on the Osprey as it approached me. The other problem is that they
overheat within 5 shots.

	What I think may be a good use for them though is to turret mount one
on a larger vessel, eg the Tiger, and have a 4MW mounted in the front position.
Then, when you come up against a well shielded foe, shoot it with the mining
laser to reduce shields before going in for the kill.

Has anyone succeeded in mining asteroids? I thought I'd check it out, 
so I went ahead and bought a mining laser, and got out on a little 
asteroid hunt. I found one eventually, and started pounding on it. 
However, after having spent quite a long time shooting at the asteroid,
(got quite a few "Right on Commander":s by the way) and not succeeding
in producing anything other than rubbish from the asteroid, I gave up.
Another bug?

BTW: One of the best "bugs" in Frontier is really the wormhole bug.
hopefully this doesn't get fixed. Otherwise it would be if not impossible
then at least very impractical to explore distant systems, such as Beta
Lyrare, for example. Too bad it crashes... Anyone know of another 
contact binary starsystem in the galaxy? And anyone know of some other
interesting systems that might be worth a visit? Like the Orion nebula
or something...

Oh, and one more thing: We really need a Frontier newsgroup.

As I said, I *DO* love the game. By the way, I've found another bug... In
one of the Imperial systems (can't remember it's name, but it had a planet
named Gold (could have been Tiacan or Facece?) the RELATIVE TO number is
wrong. You do not get the nearest planet, but most often the sun, making
it impossible for the Autopilot to land, and very hard for you. It took
me a number of attempts before I could get to that vile imperial senator
and blow him away (and he had a Panther Clipper with a 100MW beam and 27
shields! The best fight I've had in Frontier so far!).

I'll check the bug out more thoroughly, and report it.

No you don't. You don't buy the program, you buy a licence to use the
program on your home computer system. And "using" does not include
de-compiling the program.
Check your documentation. At some point or other it should read: "...
the program may not be reverse engineered" or similar.

As I see it, Braben should try fixing the original first before working
on add-ons.

Your mileage may vary.
In Germany, court decisions said that you buying the program makes
everything, including the code, your property. The 'Licenses' are
therefore not necessarily valid in Germany (read the "c't" for this).

Otoh, decompiling the program might be still illegal due to Copyright
violations...

Copyright laws are there to prevent people from copying and *spreading* the
material, it doesn't apply to reverse engineering. What's more, I find it
*immoral* for a software company to tell me what I can or can't do with the
piece of code I just purchased. Imagine I would be send to jail for writing
comments in the margin of a book! That's why hacking out copy protection
will be valid to a judge, regardless of what the license agreement says.
Semi-proof: would ftp.wustl.edu take the chance of police shutting the
computer down because they distribute patches to remove protection from
lots of PC-wares? Still, they do spread them, since (a) there's (legally
and morally) nothing wrong with getting rid of your own copy's protection,
and (b) the patches are all *new* products, for which the author of the
patch holds the copyright, not the author of the program that will be
patched.

But if you would decompile Frontier to use Braben's vectorgraphics
routines, than copyright laws will apply (and you're in trouble...). Even
if you decompile for learning purposes only, and not intend to copy the
code into your own programs, you're in fact stealing Braben's knowledge,
since he didn't make his programming techniques public (i.e. he should have
written a book on it, or make the source available).

What laws shall do, and what they really do, are two different things.
And in the comments I read about the new German (European?) Copyright
Law, decompilations or user-developed patches seem to be illegal.
That this is a stupid thing is clearly visible, but it would give the
companies the opportunity to make higher profits.

Not if it's illegal by Law :-(

Well, there is no Copyright on Knowledge ("Algorithms"), so I am
allowed to decompile the vector code for learning (or even 'admiring')
purposes. I am just are not allowed to use the code, and the algorithm
might be patented.

Don't know if we'll get any response... Probably not via the net, anyway.
If Konami and/or Gametek had any presence in these groups, we'd have
noticed it by now. However, according to what I've heard, Frontier has
allready sold 100K+ copies (probably on both PC and Amiga), and if this is
true I think that there's bound to be not only fixes, but a Frontier II aswell.

And Gametek/Konami - if you're listening - PLEASE give Braben full freedom in
designing FrontierII !

Well, it should be interesting to get the PC and amiga figures... Frontier may
be the last game selling more on the amiga than on the PC, if we belive the
news
traffics in amiga and pc groups about frontier....

Yes, that works, but you can't admire the scenery. And some of the scenery
certainly should be admired - my favourite is the earth moon. If you could
set your autopilot to fly you from one spaceport to another on the same
planet, on normal speed, you could have a good, leisurely ride...

Which version? Amiga V1.00 does not have any ship called Mirage. Or do you
have the new Frontier Blazemonger upgrade disk?

Well I just bought it in New Zealand last week ( in Wellington) and the
shop that imported the copies got them from Australia (Sydney) from
some place I can't remember as I took their stick off the Frontier
box :-)
The normal distributor in New Zealand Microdeal couldn't supply it

   A friend of mine has seen a strange ship in frontier, and wonders if
anyone else has seen such a ship.

   He had just arrived in the Lave system when a white coloured object appeared
on his scanner, which would signify a large ship. After turning around to
visually confirm this ship and prepare for battle! To his surprise, he saw a
small blue craft with the blue lightning effect seen after a hyperspace jump
coming from the tail of the craft.

   After targetting the craft and turning on the radar mapper, nothing
happened, the craft could not be identified, after a few seconds, it
hyperspaced. Using the hyperspace cloud analyser, he was able to arrive
before the craft arrived and had identified the ship as having a mass of 54t.

   On arriving at the supposed destination, and using the hyperspace
analyser on the arrival cloud, the correct information was displayed, ie
ship from Lave and 54t. However, at the moment of arrival, the information
displayed by the analyser changed. It now said a craft was arriving from
Enenen with the first coordinate in the four digit range, and the second
coordinate displayed off screen (Another BUG?)

   After that, the target was lost. No craft exited the newly named arrival
cloud.

   Now - the question is - what was this craft? Was it an alien spaceship?
Unfortunately, he could not get close enough to get a good look at it.
If someone else has seen such a strange craft, please confirm his find.

Mike.

You make me laugh. Have you PLAYED Frontier?  There's max 10 mission
types which come again and again with different persons, places
and ships and thats it...

I WANT UNIQUE MISSIONS which occur only once during my pilots life,
and which offer a small storyline. SOmETHING to play for. A brain
dead ape could have played Frontier from Competent to Elite status.
I must admit getting from the lame Eagle Fighter up to say
Cobra mkIII took 2-3 days and some hard playing but there
is absolutely no real challenge after you've got a big ship.

	It took me quite a while to get a Panther Clipper, although I
kept on getting bored and flying off into the galaxy to have a look at
places whilst doing so. However, after about a weeks playing, I managed
to get one.

	Strangely enough, even with over 70 shields, it still managed to
get toasted by a Constrictor with a 4MW beam laser. (Well reduced to 28%
hull) This took a matter of about 30 seconds, anyone else had this happen
or is it merely yet another bug? As it is, it is utterly pointless getting
a big ship, as they get hit more often, and as shields are pretty useless
they die quicker.

In case you (or someone else) has not figured this out yet....

FRONTIER'S GALAXY IS NOT OUR GALAXY

Not even close. The closest stars to Sol are pretty much correct,
but after 20 ly or so, everything is made up. Planets etc
are naturally made up. (With pretty good planet formation
routines I suppose) 

Galaxy is much much thicker than under 20ly and it's thickness
varies very much. Frontier's Galaxy map is only pseudo-3d. In reality
you really don't need the 3rd dimension, as the galaxy is paper-thin.

Braben has added few notable stars (Beta Lyrae for example) but
there's less than 100 stars that have their real counterparts.
99.9999% of the galaxy is made up with some clever fractal-style
routine.

IMHO this sucks bigtime. I must admit a realistic starmap
would be...
1. bit too much for joe gamesplayer as it would be REALLY 3D. there
would be stars in every direction from sol for at least 100-200 ly.
(I'm no astronomer, I just pulled this number off the hat. Correct
if you have better info)

2. bit too much for frontier game disk. I belive few hundred
thousand stars have been mapped and named (numeric names for most
of them but anyway) (I'm no astronomer, correct me if I'm wrong)
and adding a 1:1 starmap with 'randomly' added stars as
the distance from sol grows (you don't have to go far before
you can only see the brightest ones from sol) would
take tons of disk space.

3. bit too much for ANY gamesplayer. 99% of the gamers wouldn't
visit a fraction of those systems anyway.

But I still feel that if they advertise that Frontier has
realistic galaxy, it should be 1:1 to the most detailed
starmaps available (with maybe some common sense I must admit)
- currently all I can say that is as correct as it should be
is the planet formation stuff.

So if you pick a random star from a star catalog I can safely
bet with you that you won't find it from Frontier. I think
this is also the reason why Frontier lacks search-for-star
option as people would see thru the smoke in seconds when
they start looking for <insert-random-star-from-star-catalog-here>
... currently low-IQ gameplayer can play Frontier till hell
freezes without realizing that the galaxy is just a paper-thin
fractal-calculated piece of shit (a DAMN big one but anyway)

No offence meant Jarno, but I think your main problem is that you had
a way too high expectations about Frontier. I mean, Frontier still has
_the MOST realistic_ galaxy map of all computer games I know. So
saying that it's "a ... piece of shit" just because it's not 100 %
accurate is - well - pathetic. I still understand your feelings,
because the same has happened to me many times. You wait and wait for
some piece of software, reading all the rumours and such, imagining
what it will be like to finally get it... And when the software is
finally released, it's never what you expected it to be. I've solved
this problem by expecting all the software (and other things) I buy to
be lousy. If it is, I'm not disappointed (not so much, anyway). If it
isn't I'm really happy. I didn't expect Frontier to be as good as it
is (even with all those bugs in it), so I'm happy with it (although
those bugs should definitely be fixed and an AGA version released).

P.S. I know they advertised the galaxy to be accurate in the box
cover. But then, that cover is written by advertising people, and I
suppose you agree with me that the crap they write should usually be
ignored.

Do the Kestrel/Hawk fighters have lasers at all? I have never seen one 
fire at me... the little buggers just fly around my ship, begging for a 
blast...

Some Frontier improvements (someone add this to a bug/improvement list):

Remove all the stupid bitmap faces... make all the messages that obscure 
the scanner appear below the laser crosshairs! Improve the enemy 
intelligence so the stupid &$#%$#s wouldn't always crash with each 
other/you...

Fight with honour! Death to federal SCUM!

The PC version takes up about 700k of disk space. NOT 4Meg. Furthermore,
this is VERY unusual. Most PC (and Amiga for that matter) games usually
take a lot more. All credit to Mr Braben for being a smart enough coder not
to waste space. The small size means it's likely to stay on my HD for a
LONG time to come.

>>The PC version has nice GFX, crap sound (unless you have a sound board) and

>Yeah right, a ship made of bricks!!!

Hey, I happen to think it looks fabulous, but each to his own. You can turn
the texture mapping off if you don't want it.

>Come on software developers, give the Amiga a chance and write good software
>that uses all of the features on the Amiga instead of going for port overs.

The fact is that when a machine has many variants on the market the
companies will usually write for the lowest common denominator on the basis
of greater sales. The PC games market in VERY usual in this respect.
Mostly, I think, because there is a tremendous drive in the PC industry to
always have the bigger, faster machine (fuelled by such idiots as Microsoft
and Intel).

   Why oh Why, does the Amiga always get the short straw when it comes

Try again, the PC version fits on a 720k floppy.  Also, what is this
"brill" shit?  It has, what, texture mapping on some ships?  IMO, it's
OK, but I think ol' Braben went over the top with it...  Subtle it
ain't.  Otherwise, the PC version even has the same BUGS as the Amiga
version.  Sounds pretty similar to me...

   The Amiga version is just a 600K odds file and is quite a let down.
   It jerks around unless you have an accelerated machine and the
   graphics for ships is the usual bland polygons.

Yeeeeesh...  Define an "accelerated machine".  Is that like a 33MHz
486?  Yes, my version of Frontier is slower than the version a
PC-owning friend of mine has.  On the other hand, he has a 486-66 with
an accelerated graphics card, while I have a stock 1200.  Which do you
THINK is gonna be fastest?

   The PC version has nice GFX, crap sound (unless you have a sound
   board) and the ships are all surface mappedso they look like real
   ships.

NOT!  I say again, the surface mapping could have been great, but as
it is it's just a gimmick and doesn't add to the realism at all.

I think the Amiga version is worth it for the sound; the texture
mapping I can live without.

   I personally think the Amiga can do alot better than this.
   They could have made it A1200/A4000 only or brought out a seperate
   A500 version.

Well, I'm still hoping for an AGA version...

Well, 1) is just the spaceship leaving the spacestation, ramming you in the

It sucks but it WORKS. Braben et al will get their

loses cash - I know its annoying, and my manual is getting
messed with all the opening etc, but its an effective technique
to overcome simple pirating.

Take it this way: most games prompt at the beginning, just
phone the mate you copied from, and hey - leave the machine
on all day. Frontier is the kind of game that can be played
all day.

I think it could have been done better, say when you load or save
a game. Frontier is the kind of game which cant be 'done' in one
session - so pirates would get a look, but not a full game, and
its so good they would have to buy it!

Anyway, count headlines and lower case for all letters.
Some examples taken from the manual:

Page 43, Line 2, Word 3 = s
Page 27, Line 1, Word 2 = t
Page 5,  Line 4, Word 2 = d

Hope this helps anyone out there.

Guess what - another bug. (Forget all this talk about an alt.games.frontier group - a stupid idea if I ever heard one - and just create alt.bugs.frontier instead, or even alt.games.frontier.bugs.bugs.and.more.bugs). Anyway, this one has to do with the MB4
 Mining Machines. I don't think anyone's reported it yet.

Buy one MB4 - fine, no problem. It's when you own more than one at the same time that you start to run into problems. I discovered when returning to the planet on which all three of my rigs were set up that - due to my being slightly too accurate when try
ing to land near to my second rig - the game gurus if a rig is destroyed (so I crashed into the thing. Could happen to anyone). Later, I also discovered that it ALSO gurus if you try to sell a rig, or sell a ship with a rig on it.

All is not lost, however. If you're trying to get rid of your rigs, it turns out that you can safely destroy the last rig on the list (or sell it, if you've only got one rig left). The best thing to do is set all your rigs down on a planet, target the las
t one on the list and proceed to shoot them all in REVERSE ORDER. When you're left with only one, you can then either safely pick it up and sell it (usually not worth the effort) or just blow that one off the face of the planet too.

Suggestion: it's time for David Braben to speak. Maybe some of you who know him (I believe Dino Dini mentioned that he did) could ask him HOW COME FRONTIER WAS RELEASED IN THIS SORRY STATE?? And post his answer to the group?

Salutations to all kind friends,

Hi Everyone!

I have simple question...
I've got Elite2-Frontier-demo.lha from FTP.Wustl.edu.
O.K. I unpacked it and run it on my A500 with Kickstart 1.3.
Screen turned black, there were going some vector texts and goood music.
Now. There was some star on right side and some objects. Music is still
going up but the animations stops there.
So:
Is possible to run Frontier on Kick 1.3 or no?
That is....

You need to set your stack size to approx. 100000 bytes.

Had the same problem on my 1200 so it isn't 1.3. You simply have to set the 
stack to be huge. Try 65k i think.

I think this is another example of how disorganised Gametek/Konami are. If
Frontier isn't released until next year, then HMV, Virgin, WHSmith and all
the other shops are selling very good pirate copies.......

WOW!!
HOLD THE BUS!
ok, seing as how you're probably a new miggy user.
Its dead easy, just click-and-drag the icon to wherever you want it on your
hdisk.
Simple eh?
I dont know, the marvels of modern technology ;)
(and BETTER than using dos like those poor PC owners :)  )
PS, running things like DOPUS, or WBverlauf seem to bugger up colours
somethimes :(
Shame, it takes ages to kill them all.
I'll have to write a script (yuk!) to do it...
(Either that or add it to the frontier bug list to get Mr Braben to fix it..)
(But then again, he's got enough on his plate)

Oh, and just to let you know, the installation process is in the manual
addendum or whatever its called, just in case you've got it but havent read it.
;)

Al.

Sorry I seem to have been stupid. I should have mentioned this
before.

I have tried to install it by just dragging it across, but this
just gives me the error

"Unable to open tool 'Frontier'"

when I double click.

I though this problem had already been covered when I posted
originally.

I had the same problem; the ship never shows up, even when I leave the station
1 minute before the ship should leave. I noticed that after I took the
mission, when I fly directly to the wanted planet, the ship shows up. When
I didn't do this, sometimes no ship. 

hope this helps a bit for the future

seems fair, since I can toast a panther with my cobra and a 4MW beam. I ended
with only 2% remaining hull, but the energy bomb of the panther was tough!.
Actually, seen from another ship, a panther is very slow, and so very easy to
kill.

It does install? if you can call moving a file installing, and WHAT install prog?

Click and drag

One complete galaxy, our own one actually, but not many systems are inhabited

Well, if you like that sort of thing, I know of a few people who hated elite
style games when it was out, but absolutley LOVE frontier and are totally

What are you all talking about.  Being a PC!!!!!!! owner and having this 
game iknow it installs at about 600k.  Where did you get 4 meg from?
And it uses just over 1 meg of memory.

What are you talking about? The PC version is about 500k.. It comes in one
720k floppy.

The Amiga version has nice polygons, PC version has those crappy texture

Hmm, I haven't seen a space ship made of marble before..

After looking around the fronter file I decided that David Braben should have
employed a sound FX man because there si so much bloody room for decent samples. Ok, on a 1meg
old Amiga(1/2 meg chip ram) they probably couldn`t be used, but what about A1200 and 1 meg
chip ram users. There must be enough of them now? I always thought that sound effects could
be better used on games anyway, but to hear the rubbish churned out by frontier..UGH.
Better than nothing, but it could have been improoved vastly. There was even a virtually blank
(and certainly useless) 2nd disk that could have had samples/extra gfx/galaxies stored on
it. All together now.....

WE WANT A DEBUGGED AGA VERSION WITH SOME MORE MISSIONS AND ALIENS!!!!!!!

And we don`t want to have to pay another 30 quid for it. A five quid upgrade?

No, real spaceships are made with little white tiles that fall off.
That's when the ships get up there in one piece.

I like the textures and colours in frontier. Its like buying a car...
now shall I have the red one or the blue one...or maybe the camouflage.
I adds something for me.

Well  don't know how worthwhile that would be if you're going to target AGA
owners specifically and just do an upgrade for them.  I know of 1 (ONE) A1200
owner personally.  That's it.  I know that the A1200 is selling well across
Europe but you'd be limiting your potential market to do this.  Of those 
people who have Frontier, how many have A1200's?  Of these how many would bother
to buy an upgrade?

I wouldn't be buying it.  Of course I don't own an AGA machine, and have no
intention of doing so.  Maybe if the bugfixes were released with the add-on
disks (or even the inclusion of a special AGA version along with the scenarios
sales would be better.  Just have to wait and see I guess.

Nope. and I registered almost a month ago. I suppose they send a notice/
disk to registered users IF/when they do release upgrade/bugfix/whatever...

Register and then sell the game :-)

DEDICATED TO GOD, erm ..... David Braben

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

FRONTIER ....

One and a half years ago we read a work in progress report in THE ONE.  From
then on we devoured any screen shots we could get our hands on.  Two weeks
ago we managed to get our hands on this game, and since then have not stopped
playing it.  Our current year dates are MATT - May 3207, DAVE - November 3204,
and over this time we have experimented with different aspects of the ELITE
universe, and here are some of the things we have discovered :

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

FLIGHT TIPS :

HOW TO ROUGH LAND :

A bit of a tricky one this, if your in a heavy ship!  The trick is to look
at the mass of the planet your trying to land on, anything above 0.25 Earth
masses will be tricky, but it is not impossible!

First an explanation of how the gravity will have effect on your ship.
Yes I do believe old David did think about gravity - either that or it's
a very coincidental bug!! For example an Imperial Courier is labeled as being 
480 Tonnes in weight - this is it's weight on Earth. On a planet on 0.25 Earth 
masses the ship will actually be 120 Tonnes in weight. In other words you will 
float down much more slowly, but still like a brick!

The manual mentions that you must point the nose up to create a little bit 
of lift to act against the gravity, but this means travelling at speed, and 
landing at speed means you will crash! Lower your speed and raise the nose
so that you are falling slowly (about 3 metres per second) and travelling
forwards at about 150kph. When your altitude is about 15-20m cut the set speed
to 0 and throw the nose forwards until it is horizontal. You should be down!

You will notice that the heavier the ship and heavier the planet the more you 
will have to raise the nose to come in. When I had a Imperial Courier on one
planet I came in almost vertically!!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO FUEL SCOOP OFF A GAS GIANT :

Remember you need a fuel scoop and conversion unit to try this one.

Use you're autopilot to get close to the planet to set the ship's speed
relative to that body. Now aim for the top of the planet, at about 15,000kph
and do a bit of time skipping, lowering your speed slowly. Use the targeting 
tunnel to see how fast you're comming in by keeping lines moving at a
consistent speed. Eventually you will see an atmosphere appear around the gas 
giant. Aim for the middle of this - remember to continue to lower your speed!
Soon you will get an altitude reading of 0m, (a gas giant has no surface) by 
this point your speed should be about 4000kph. STOP the time skip. The fuel 
scoop will start working. It will fill your cargo bay first, and then the 
fuel tank. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
HOW TO SLING SHOT :

This ones just for fun, but it is a nice effect.

The idea of a sling shot is to use the gravitation pull of a body to 
gain speed, (used by satelites today!).

Again the effects of this are governed by the mass of the body you are using,
the larger the body the faster you have to be travelling in order to stop
gravity pulling you into it.    

For example, for a large gas giant like Jupiter you need to be traveling at 
about 700+ kps.  Aim just past Jupiter, too close and you'll be dragged you 
into it, too far away and the sling shot will have little effect.  Turn
your engines off to avoid them correcting the pull of Jupiter.  Speed things
up with the time skip, and whatch your ship accelerate!  You'll notice 
that you'll do a part orbit of Jupiter before you actually start flying
away.  Turn your engines on and look at how much speed you've gained!

You might find this takes several attempts to get the speed and distance
right so that you don't crash!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO DO ASSASSINATIONS :

A fun little job this, causing havoc and destruction!

First go to the bulletin board and look for an assassination advert.  If
your Elite rating is high enough (about average!), you'll be offered the
job.  Get to the point of the assassination, make sure your at the right
starport or space station.

If your on a planet, rough land outside the starport and wait until the 
right time.  Use the time skip and save options to get as close to the
correct time as possible.

If your waiting outside a space station, make sure your not waiting
directly outside the doors otherwise a ship may fly out and hit you!  Again
use the time skip and save options.  Make sure you can see the door of the
space station, so you can see the victim coming out!

At the correct time, (down to the second), the victim will emerge from the
station or starport.  If your on a planet, take off a few seconds before the
desired time.

There are two ways you can take the victim out :

The first one requires that you have a hyperspace cloud analyser, and a 
hyperdrive capable of a large jump, (about 15 light years +).  Consult the 
manual about hyperspace jump distances, and the time it takes. It'll be in the
Hyperspace jumps section, (page 32). When the victim hyperspaces, use the 
analyser and jump after him.  If your lucky he will have a lesser hyperspace 
jump capablity than you and you will arrive a day or so before him.  He will 
appear in roughly the same place as you appeared.  When he arrives, KICK ASS!

The second way involves a little more coordination, and cool.  When the
victim emerges from the space station, or starport, target him to get the
distance reading.  Accelerate after him, shooting all the way.  Watch your
speed to make sure you don't fly past him! (Remember look at your set speed
not your actual speed!).  By this time your friendly neighbourhood police
will be hot on your tail, try to ignore them!  Once the victim has been
fried, select communications and pay the fine remotely to get rid of your
fugitive legal status, you will have just gained!  After all this has been
accomplished, pick a nearby system and GET OUT OF THERE!  You will notice 
that you will have a criminal record but your legal status will be clean, so
no bounty hunters will be after you!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO MINE :

Remember that you must have an MB4 mining rig to perform this.

To do this you must have perfected your fuel scooping, and rough landing
skills.  The reason for this is that you must pick a planet or system, which
has a little or no registered settlers otherwise when you get there the
planets will probably be mined out!  This means there will be no starports for 
you to use your autopilot to guide you down to the surface.  This is
where you have to use your fuel scooping skills aiming for the top of the 
planet, i.e. coming in on a low obital path, until you get an altitude 
reading.

You'll need to pick a planet above freezing point otherwise your likely to 
end up mining water!  If you pick a planet with a starport you'll get a
fine and the police will attack.

Guide yourself in and rough land on the planet surface.  Once landed deploy
your MB4.  After about 8 months come back and land near it, (about 0.1 km
away).  Pick up the hopper and fly off with your mined goods.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

SO WHAT'S THE BEST SHIP???

An argument that seems to be going on, recently is "What is the best ship?".

Here's our views :

Asp Explorer -     Small so you don't accidentally colide with 
                   other ships or debris.

                   Manoeuvrable, and little inertia considering 
                   it's size.

                   Very good thruster acceleration, for important 
                   evasive manouvers.

                   Fair light  so good, cheap, hyperspace range.

                   Has a fuel scoop mounting, for cheap hydrogen!

        VERDICT :  Good all rounder though lacking in hull space so you can't
                   have everything at once!

Imperial Courier - Good size to have everything at once.

                   Scores high on looks!!!

                   It's in the intro-sequence!

                   Manoeuvers well for it's size.

          BUT .... Due it's size it hits everything in sight, so at least 7
                   shield generators are needed!

                   Lacks a fuel scoop mounting.

                   Only avaliable from the evil scum EMPIRE!

        VERTICT :  Good trading, and assassination ship, but drinks fuel like
                   mad, so very expensive!  
                   

Tiger Trader -     Good size to have everything at once.

                   Has a fuel scoop mounting.

                   The amount of crew sets you on your way to a Panther.

          BUT .... Not THAT manoeverable.

                   Looks like the back end of a donkey!
                   (except for Matts PINK Tiger Trader!).

                   Have to pay, and find a big crew.

        VERDICT :  Good as a stepping stone for a big cruiser, and as an
                   all round ship it's not bad.

Panther Clipper -  Masive beast!  Anything you want, you've got it!

                   Has a fuel scoop mounting for those long trips.

                   Scores on looks!

         BUT ..... Grotesquely unmanouverable.

                   Gun turrets awkward to use, because they're back-to-front
                   to the flight controls.

                   Eats fuel like THREE Imperial Courier's!

         VERDICT : The ship designed to explore the unexplored worlds, and 
                   designed for the large plasma accelerator - we reckon.
                                                                         

SUMMARY :

So what is the BEST ship?  We think you should buy the ship to suit the
task in hand.  For example I've just gone right back down to an Asp with a 
class 4 hyperdrive so that I can do more military runs!  Matt's currently in a
Tiger Trader (PINK YUK!) because he's in two minds whether to go back up 
to a Courier or Panther.

COMMENTS

Alright, alright - here comes the bugs, or playablity "quirks", as we prefer
to call them.

The one I always seemd to get just recently is that the autopilot sometimes 
won't set the relative speed to the correct body! This might not seem like
much of a problem, but when trying to get near a planet, it stopped me dead 
in my tracks. So I turned off the autopilot and the time skip, and went for a
manual dock. But because the relative speed was set to the nearest star and 
not the planet, I found that to actually close on the planet, and then the 
space station, I had to travel at some 110 kms!! I had no way of knowing how
quickly I was catching the space station, and therefore no way of docking.
I tried the autopilot again, but off it went overshooting and generally flying
anywhere, but towards the space station. I tried manually again but the  
relative speed didn't change, so I just quitted and reloaded!! 

But I must stress this IS the only bug I have found, that cannot be sorted 
out by doing something else, like manual control, and so must go down as a 
bug unfortunatly.

Saying this though, we feel it is still the best game ever written, by such a
huge margin.  With such a BIG game as this you have to expect little things
such as this to crop up - WELL DONE DAVID BRABEN and THANKS!
                                                                  
(just one little comment : Has anybody figured out how to start from MARS?
                           We can't work it out!  Any Solutions Greatfully
                           recieved!)

That's All For Now!

These Are The Voyages Of Just Two Ordanary Games Players,

I believe this should actually be more a warning than a "I found ONE MORE 
bug in Frontier" post. Reason being I have not tested my thesis properly.

Anyway, it happened like this. I was flying at max time compression and
decided to fire my 4MW beam. Whooops, all my fuel disappeared!! At first
I though it was a definite bug, but I would like to know more before 
declaring myself an ignorant, attention hungry gamer.

Does firing weapons suck fuel? Actually it should since firing
a MEGAwatt range weapon requires quite a lot of energy and it doesn't take
it from engines (at least it doesn't seem so).

It would appear according to this example that time compression does truly
affect every aspect and that firing consumes fuel. If not, there is another
bug in Frontier. 

The moral of the story: Do not fire when speeding.

I believe in Elite, the "Right on Commander!" message meant that your
kill count had just hit a multiple of 256 kills. It's probably much
the same in Frontier (although if different ships are worth different
numbers of "kill points" as someone claimed, it probably means your
kill point total had clocked over a certain multiple).

I've had two as well. If anyone gets beyond Competent, could they
please post how many Right on messages they'd received?

The actual game will run on Wb1.3 without any stack alteration,
assuming you mean Frontier the GAME not the demo,
but the demo needs a large stack to run ~100,000.

Why should they bother? They've already got the money ...

I daresay he should fix FRONTIER _I_ first!

   No, real spaceships are made with little white tiles that fall off.
   That's when the ships get up there in one piece.

   I like the textures and colours in frontier. Its like buying a car...
   now shall I have the red one or the blue one...or maybe the camouflage.
   I adds something for me.

Well, I MIGHT have bought that...  Except, of course, you can't
actually CHANGE the textures.  Now, if you had a selection of nifty
textures you could choose every time you bought a ship, I'd be
impressed.  But then again, I'd settle for being able just to change
the colour of the ship.
