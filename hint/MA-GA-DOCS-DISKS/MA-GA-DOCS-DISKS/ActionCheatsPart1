   All cheats have been found on a 1 meg chip Amiga,those who have 512kb chip
   & 512kb fast will find that some or all cheats will not work at all because
   the game will load the data differenty into this configuration.
    A new twist to maybe why it don't work maybe the fact the game loads the
   data differently under another kickstart-have a look at bubble bobble.

   For a start I would like to point out that some games write the Lives,
  Energy, Money etc to a different address every time the game is loaded, so
  if you find that on loading your game at a later date that nothing happens
  this will be the reason and you will have to start over finding Lives etc.
  Hopefully all the cheats below are set addresses as I haven't checked 
  them all out.
  
   All new additions have been checked twice,so I am sure that these games
  will not write to a different address on reloading.
   
   Mega handshakes to MARK ONEILL for finding Weapons Select and Fist Power
  for Majic Pockets 2 minutes after giving it back to him,maybe now you will
  be able to finish the game after finding the lives hack for yuh!

  Invincibility: How is it done?

  Invincibility is the short flashing shield on your ship when you re-enter
  the game after dying,it's there so on re-entry you are not killed outright.
  
  So how do you count a flashing shield? YOU DON'T!

  First find your lives etc then using the M command go to that
  address, scroll till you have filled the screen then put the lives 
  address in the middle of the screen, print the page out using F5 key.
  Do this when the ship or what ever is not flashing, get yourself
  killed then wait till your ship comes back on the screen, if it's
  flashing go into action replay and back to the monitor using M
  command again, print the screen out as above.
  Now look at both print-outs and find any numbers on the second
  printout that are not on the first and mark them. I have
  found that the address for Invincibility has been in either the
  1st 5 lines above or below the line that the lives is on, so if you
  play around with the numbers that have shown up on the second
  print out you may just find the address for Invincibility.
  I realise this may seem a mickey mouse way of finding a number but
  it works,if you have problems finding it then go back into the
  game and wait till the ship stops flashing and do another printout
  so what you have on paper is flash off, flash on, flash off and this
  may eliminate those other numbers that have popped up in the second
  printout,as I've found a few numbers do pop up in the second sheet.
  You may also find you will need to put a number in the address
  in order to make it work before you TFD the address, as I've done
  with rtype 2 and others.

  CHEATING ON AD&D & ROLEPLAYING:
  -------------------------------

  One of the easiest games to cheat on is the ad&d type game - the
  following on how to do this is the shortest.
  Don't bother to use the trainer commands for this, all you need to
  look for is the characters name by using the FS command
  (SEARCH STRING) E.G let's say your char's name is Warmonger, go into
  Action Replay and type FS "WARMONGER", when the search has stopped 
  you will have possibly 1 or more addresses displayed of where Warmonger 
  was found, go to the first address using the M(monitor) command and scroll
  the full screen,in doing so you should see some other characters who are
  in your party and this is what you are looking for. In some instances
  there are two areas of your chars that are the same, so you will
  need to find out which one works.

  SO WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR?

  First write down the stats of your chars (STRENGTH,WISDOM,LUCK)
  and change any over 9 to hex values. You will nearly always find
  these statts just after the char's name and in some cases 2 of the
  same value.E.G
  Warmonger's statts are 9,11,13,10,8,5
  So you should find:
		      09 09 0b 0b 0d 0d 0a 0a 08 08 05 05
                  or  09 0b 0d 0a 08 05
  Change values to what you desire to a max of FF(255),making sure
  that both values are the same.
  You can also find your hit points for each char, but the only
  draw back to this in roll playing games like Curse of the Azure
  Bonds, is that as soon as you rest your party, they change back to
  there original state.To get around this you will need to find the
  experience for your char, put it up to around 16 million and go to
  the guild and boost your char to the max.
  I've played around a lot with ad&d games and have even found all the
  the items that can be found in the game and have even gone to the point
  of adding things to the chars back packs. 
  If you play around a bit you can find a lot of things you wouldn't think
  was possible.

  SOME HINTS ON TIME CLOCKS

  If you are finding it hard to find the address to a clock from a
  game,then move away from the normal search and try something
  different.

  SOME EXAMPLES:
  --------------
  Let's say the clock shows 59.
  You could start your search by looking for the hex value.
		 59 = 3b
  If the address is not found then try the real number.
		    search for 59
  If that also fails then try 0509 or just 509 or  wait till the
  the clock runs down to the last 9 digits and then search. If the
  clock reads 116 then it would look like this E.G 01 01 06.
  
  If all else fails try the search backwards- so if the clock reads 59
  then search for 95 or 0905 etc etc etc

  NOTE 1. NOTE 1. NOTE 1. NOTE 1.
  -------------------------------
  A new addition to time clocks is this.
  If all the above fail try this combination,let's say your clock reads
  45 secs then enter in the search as 34 35 = 45 secs or 150 secs then
  search for 31 35 30.  

  If you are finding it hard to find lives etc for a game then allso try
  using the above method E.G 3 lives search for 33 when the counter goes
  down to 2 then search for 32,you may find that more than one address will
  be found so you'll have to find the one that is the lives address.        
  
  BACKWARDS SEARCHING
  -------------------
  O.K so you can't find those lives,ammo etc etc and you have used every
  combination you can think of-Well how about searching backwards then.
  Lets say your lives counter is 3,lose a life then go into the action
  replay and search for 1(as in 1 life lost) go back to the game and get
  killed again,then search for 2(as in 2 lives lost)get killed again and
  search for 3(as in 3 lives lost).
  This method was used to find MAJIC POCKETS,PINBALL DREAMS/FANTASIES.

  CHECK ALL THOSE NUMBERS
  -----------------------
  Well I've seen some people searching for stuff with the Action Replay and
  wait till the very last entry to have this magical number pop up and to
  there suprise it don't,well stop believing the Action Replay is some Magical
  Device that will find everything for you-if you get 7 addresses after 1st
  entry then print them out cos it may just hold the lives counter and it
  may just not be there at the last entry - so check all your numbers and
  you'll find what you want.

  THE FINAL WORD
  --------------
  YOU WILL HAVE HEARD THAT YOU CAN ONLY DELETE POSITIVE ADDRESSES,THIS IS A
  LOAD OF RUBBISH,YOU WILL FIND THAT YOU CAN DELETE NEGATIVE ADDRESSES AS

    since some librarys move under V1.3 the Lives counter follows.

                    into address and TFD 1718,why put 05 you are saying,
                    well the computer thinks you are on level 5 so when
                    you finish level 1(05 to the computer) you advance a
                    a level to level 6.EASY man......... later

         Note about Pinball Dreams/Fantasies
         -----------------------------------
      Well these 2 Games along with Majic Pockets counts up,so if you lose
    a ball then you search for 1 not the normal 3 or so still there- it's
    a count of lose not a count of whats left.With pinball Fantasies I had
    to lose 9 balls or so to get up to 880a7.

    Enemy Energy = 4794b              value and puts that value in your

      With the level skip,all you need do is put a nuber from 02-0f

    About Rolling Thunder
    ---------------------
    The Rolling thunder cheat was found by using the method mentioned in
    NOTE 1. of TIME CLOCKS above.
    In order to change the lives,bullets etc counters you need to place 
    30 to 39 numbers in. E.G if the bullets counter shows 125 you need to
    enter this as 31 32 35 in order for it to work,so the max you can have
    is 999 or 39 39 39.

  all 3 for over 16 million dollars.Next go into the Platoon section
  and create 4 good Platoons using best armour and weopons,let them
  train to 5 star Generals.Load them in the carrier and speed off to
  the ENEMYBASE,land them on the planet and using the addresses
  below for the Platoons,alter your platoons to become invincible
  against the enemy and in a couple of minutes you have won.

  Do the same as with the 1st dude and then jump to planet 8,not
  forgetting to teraform it first.Refuel on planet 8 then jump to
  the ENEMYBASE,land your troops and kick butt using the addresses
  for the platoons below and you have won this round.

  The third dude "KRART"

  This was the 1st one I hacked into and after getting every address
  for all the planets I got a bit lazy with finding the other planets
  with the other three dudes,so if anyone out there wants to send me
  the addresses to the planets that I haven't found,then do so but
  making sure you follow my planet grid and the way I have numbered
  them.

  Due to the lack of space I've abbreviated the addresses in the
  columns as such.E.G de10+1 = de10 + de11 or ddd6+7 = ddd6 + ddd7.
  If you are wondering what the address between food and minerals
  is,it's the strength,changing this does nothing as it is controled
  by the amount of men in your platoon.

  The forth dude "RORN"

  Everything is the same as KRART so follow those addresses.

  Well I went back into the game and decided to look for some other
  hacks and this is what I found.

  DAY AND YEAR:
  -------------
  You will find the day address at e413,there is only 64 days in a
  year.The year address is e414 + e415.

  Next I tried to find the fuel address for all the ships,I did find
  it but it would have been hard to tell you where cos I wouldn't
  know how your ships are placed on the grid,so I went one step further.
  When you reach the year 2040 all your ships get nuclear drives,so
  that is what I found.

  B-29 BATTLE CRUISER
  -------------------
  ece0 + ece1      FF both addresses for nuclear drives.

  CARGO STORE/CARRIER
  -------------------
  eda0 + eda1      FF both addresses for nuclear drives.

  CORE-MINING STATION
  -------------------
  edc0 + edc1      FF both addresses for nuclear drives.

  HORTICULTURAL STATION
  ---------------------
  edf0 + edf1      FF both addresses for nuclear drives.

  For those of you who are interested in finding the fuel then go to
  e654,this is the top of the ship list.You will allways find
  the fuel at the start of the next craft in the list-E.G

  HACKS FOR THE PLATOONS:
  -----------------------
  PLATOON | ADDRESSES
  ---------------------
     1    | eb54 + eb55
     2    | eb60 + eb61
     3    | eb6c + eb6d
     4    | eb78 + eb79
     5    | eb84 + eb85
     6    | eb90 + eb91
     7    | eb9c + eb9d       These addresses work on all 4
     8    | eba8 + eba9       oponents,a good number to boost
     9    | ebb4 + ebb5       your platoons is 09 ff any higher
    10    | ebc0 + ebc1       and you confuse the computer and
    11    | ebcc + ebcd       both strength scores rise and
    12    | ebd8 + ebd9       fall erratically slowing down the
    13    | ebe4 + ebe5       fight somewhat.You really only need
    14    | ebf0 + ebf1       1 platoon to wipe out a planit,except
    15    | ebfc + ebfd       the enemybase.
    16    | ec08 + ec09
    17    | ec14 + ec15
    18    | ec20 + ec21
    19    | ec2c + ec2d

     Is there anyone out there interested in making Save game Editors like
 that of Dungeon Master & Bardstale 2 that's out.At the moment I've edited
 Bardstale 3 & found every item,hit points etc etc,have also done the same to
 Legend of Faerghail and others,even to the point of bringing your DEAD
 Character back to life if you want to.
     Have done Action Replay versions of these two Games but would like to
 get editors made for those who don't have Action Replays,So if your
 interested in making an editor then write to me at the address below.

       CHARS & CHAR IS SHORT FOR CHARACTERS & CHARACTER
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~       
       To find the addresses of your characters,search for the first
       chars name using the FS command.With Bards 3 there is only one
       address,if you are new to the Action Replay then it is easier to
       edit the char with the name to the far left of the screen 
       (Hex side)and as you go along you will be able to scroll through
       the whole char list and edit it from memory.(yours not the computers)

       We'll start on the first char that I loaded.
       NON-MAGIC USER SECTION:
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       NOTE 1.
       ~~~~~~~
       THE FORMAT BELOW NEVER CHANGES,ALL THAT I WILL SHOW STAYS IN THE
       SAME FORMAT ALL THE TIME,THIS IS THE SAME FOR ALL CHARS.THE ONLY
       THING THAT WILL CHANGE WILL BE UNDOCUMENTED BYTES THAT WILL POP
       UP AT SOME TIME DURING PLAY.

        Do not FF (255)all your statts or when you go to the GUILD to
        advance in level they will reset to 0.About AA would do but
        what ever you do put,make sure you leave room for advancement.
        With Experience you will notice I have marked 3 places even 
        though there is only 2 numbers showing ( 07 D0 ).This is because
        your experience starts from D0 and runs backwards when you gain
        more experience.If you FF all 3 addresses you will have over
        16 millions points - the way it works is the same as money above.
        You will have to reset experience if you change class E.G -
        from Magician to Sorcerer.The money value is not yet shown,the 3
        bytes I have shown is where it will be placed,starting from 
        h (hundred) byte.If you wanna change the level of your char then
        the last 2 bytes is for you.

            HIT POINTS
            ~~~~~~~~~~
         Where you see the Two 21 digits is the HIT POINTS,one counts
         down when you are hit and the other stays the same all the time
         and is the most your char can be healed to.The 00 in front of the
         21 is the thousand value of your hit points.Change both values
         to same amount at first E.G - 02 21 02 21 or  00 FF 00 FF

         Note:- If you change 21 to FF(255)(example), when you advance in
         level you will notice that when the counter on the game screen 
         reaches over 999 it will change to *** , just ignore this as the
         onscreen counter will only go to 999,when you look at the HIT
         POINTS in the Action Replay you will notice that they are still
         going up,so don't worry they have not reset to zero.

         ITEMS IN BACKPACK
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         Byte 01 at the start of each item is the EQUIPED or UNEQUIPED
         item byte.In the game it looks like this: -

                  :HELM  
                  ^
                  |
              In the game this is an EQUIPED item(helm being worn)
              or 01 in Action Replay.

                   HELM
                  ^
                  |
               UNEQUIPED item(helm not being worn) or 00 in Action Replay.
          
          You must have 00 or 01 at the start of each item or you get
          funny ASCII codes instead.

          The next byte E.G 03 (item 1 above) is the item byte,in this
          case 03 is a Broadsword .For a full list of Weapons,Armour,Magic
          items,Figurines,and misc items,see the full list below.
          
          Byte FF at the end of each item is the AMOUNT byte as I will
          call it.With a lot of magic items you can cast spells etc.or
          with TNT you have a certain amount to use.E.G
                       
                      HOLY TNT #28   OR   WIZHELM #32


          Byte FF means off.If we put a number in place (up to FE) of FF
          then the item is active (as shown above).Any number including
          FF is for magic items only,make sure you have only FF at the
          end of any non-magic items.The highest number to place is FE
          and doing so will have the same effect as the HIT POINTS. E.G

                      HOLY TNT #**     OR    WIZHELM #**

          The onscreen counter only goes up to 99 and because FE is 254
          the screen will display ** instead.

                       Start of the spell list.

          E0 is the start of the spell list for 1st level Conjurer,so if
          you want all the spells up to a Archmage (Conjurer,Magician,
          Sorcerer,Wizard,Archmage) then do the following to line 6.

                         THE COMPLETE SPELL LIST

          When you change to a Chronomancer you lose all your spells from
          all other classes,so the full Chronomancer spell list looks like
          this.

          The Chronomancer spells end on LINE 7 as shown above,the format
          may be a bit different from THE COMPLETE SPELL LIST but I
          assure you that all spells are shown.
          I have also found out that even though you are a Chronomancer
          you can still put in the other spell list minus FE cos 01 has
          to be there for the Chronomancer.

        The Geomancer can only acquire up to level 7 spells but I found 3
        hidden spells to add to his/her list.
                 They are :-) GILL,DIVA,NUKE
        To get them just put F9 in place of C0

           BARD
           ~~~~
          If you are a BARD you only need to use the 1st byte marked 01
          as this is the amount of TUNES you have left to use.
                  09 = 9 tunes etc.

           HUNTER
           ~~~~~~
           If you are a HUNTER you only need to use the 1st byte marked 01
           as this is your CRITICAL HIT ability.                           
                  09 = 3 critical hit
                  03 = 1    "      "

           ROGUE
           ~~~~~
           If you are a ROGUE you need to use all 5 bytes shown 01-05.

           01 = DISARM TRAPS   02 = IDENTIFY CHESTS   03 = IDENTIFY ITEM
           04 = HIDE IN SHADOWS   05 = CRITICAL HIT
                   If you put 09 in the above you will get 3 in that spot.

          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
          Over 200 items to be found,the bytes that have a X after them
          mean that there is no item attached to that byte.If you happen
          to find a hidden item anywhere then send me a line.
          
          A couple of hints when putting items in the back pack.
          It is possible to wear more than 1 piece of armour,you can if
          you like wear 12 pieces of armour,EQUIP the items in the Action
          Replay and go back into the game,if you are wearing 4 pieces of
          armour then your AC will be 4 times as great,you will only lose
          this if you UNEQUIP and then EQUIP a piece of armour as the game
          will reset all the other armours.
          It is allso possible for a magic user to wear the the best armour
          so long as you don't try to EQUIP other armour in the game.

          This is the 1st HACK in a series I will be doing so
          if you want me to try and do any particular AD&D then let me
          know by writing to me at:
