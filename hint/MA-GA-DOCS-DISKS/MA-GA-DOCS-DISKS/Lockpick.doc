Loading and Running LockPick

To load, insert the LockPick disk into any available disk drive.  The
LockPick disk icon should appear on your screen.

To open the directory, double-click on the disk icon.

To run, click on the LockPick program icon in the disk directory.
LockPick will then automatically load and slide its custom screen
up into full view.  You will then be greeted with a welcome upon which
a simple mouse click will start the program.  LockPick will then wait
for input.

To install in your hard drive, insert the LockPick disk into any available
disk drive.  The LockPick disk icon should appear on your screen.

To open the directory, double-click on the disk icon.

To run, click on the LockPick install icon in the disk directory.  LockPick
will then automatically begin the hard drive installation procedure.
Please, follow all instructions.

LockPick User Interface

The User Interface of LockPick should be quite familiar to beginner and
experienced Amiga users alike, as it runs as a process off the Workbench.
LockPick will multitask within reason.  The only thing that will not
multi-task is the nibbler, which uses all of the computer's processing
power to ensure clean, fast & reliable copies.

The Slide and Arrow Gadgets, depicted to the left of this text, are located
adjacent to the file requester window.  This window displays fourteen
parameters at a time.  To select different parameters, one may either
hold down the Up Arrow (to scroll up), hold down the Down Arrow (to scroll
down), use the Left and Right Arrow keys which scroll one screen length
(fourteen names) at a time, or grab hold of the Slider and move anywhere
within the available names.

Other gadgets present are located in the top right corner of the screen.
They are (top to bottom): Screen Change, Iconify, Search, Search Next,
and Create Fast Directory.

Screen Change is not your typical Intuition supplied icon.,  Instead,
it only allows screen changes when LockPick deems the action safe.  As
an example, Screen Change is disabled during parameter execution.  Note
that the user may still flip manually through screens via the Right- 
Amiga N and M key combinations, however, it is not recommended on a 
floppy only system as LockPick declares ownership of the drives during 
the copy routines and for all intensive purposes, AmigaDOS thinks that the
disks do not even exist (thus causing requesters).  The sole exception
to the manual screen flipping is during nibble copy where the only
active key is the right mouse button for the abort function.

Iconify is a feature that will shrink the LockPick menu screen down to
a single little window on the Workbench screen.  To reactivate it,
simply place the pointer over the window and click once.  Alternatively,
the Right-Amiga I key combination will enter iconify mode.  (As will
selecting "Iconify" from the Project menu.)

Search will turn the window title bar into an input requester.  You will
be prompted for a search string.  Upon the first occurence of a match
within the parameter list, the parameter containing the search string will
be displayed within the file window.  If a match is not found, you will
be informed as such.

Note that delete, backspace, and enter are the only control keys
available in the title bar.  Right-Amiga S is the key combination to
invoke search mode.  As in Iconify, this is listed as "Search for..."
in the Search menu.

Search Next will find the next occurence of the last entered string.
If not found, you will be informed.  Search next will continue until the 
last occurence is found.  Right-Amiga N is the key combination to
commence searching for the next string or string fragment.  Search Next
is listed as "Find Next" in the Search menu.

Create Fast Directory will immensely speed up loading of the parameter 
directory.  It reads the current parameter directory, alphabetizes it,
crunches it, and saves it as "Params:.faaastdir".  Note that the previous
"Params:.faaastdir", the old fast directory, is overwritten.  A fast
directory may also be created by selecting  the CreatesFastDir menu item
in the Project menu or using Right-Amiga C.

Hence new parameters do not have to be added in libraries or in complete
version upgrades as in other copiers.  Just copy the parameter files
to "Params:parameters" and select Create Fast Directory.  The new
parameters will be added automatically to the new fast directory.

Most version upgrades will only require copying the main LockPick
file and any included support files to the "Params:" volume.    

To exit LockPick, click on the window close for the main window, press
Right-AMiga Q, or select the "Quit: Are You Sure?" item from the Project
menu.  The LockPick will quit and the copier screen will slide off the
Workbench.

Selecting And Executing A Parameter

All one has to do to select a parameter is to move the pointer over the
desired parameter name in the file window then either press Enter or
double click on the name.  The titlebar will then change to "Working..."
while the parameter is executing.  Note that the pointer may be located
anywhere with the filewindow, not just on the name.  The title bar will
change from "Please make your selection now..." to the parameter name
when the pointer is over a name.

Once the parameter has begun execution, you will be presented with
either a Copier Requester or a Copier Front End.  If a Copier Requester
appears, it will query you if you actually need a copy of the original
disk.  If you made a copy with another fast copier and it failed a
protection check (which will happen if one fast copies a protected disk),
you do not have to recopy it.  Simply select "No" in the requester and
LockPick will prompt you for the backup disk to apply the parameter to.
Everything will proceed as usual.  If you do need a copy, select "Yes"
and you will enter the Copier Front End.  Note that "Yes" may be entered
on the keyboard as "Y" or "Return" and that "No" may be entered as "N",
"ESC". or close window.

The fast or nibble Copier Front End will full the file window with one
grid each for source and target disks as well as "OK" and "Cancel"
gadgets.  If multiple drives are detected, LockPick will configure 
itself from the external to internal drive.  The reason for this is
that you should write disks with the drive you intend to load them
with.  Since DF0: is used for boot disks, DF0: is the logical choice
for writes.  For single drive configurations, you will be prompted for
source and destination disks as the need arises.  The number of swaps
is dependent on the amount of memory present in your system.  You will
be warned if the write protect is not set on the source and if it is set
on the destination.  This is used to guard against inadvertently writing
to one's original disk.  As the copy commences, the OK may be entered
as "O" or "RETURN" and the "CANCEL" as "C", "ESC", or window close.  
Please follow all screen directions.  If you leave two of the same disks
in the drives when the filesystem is re-enabled, you will confuse Amiga
DOS and Guru the computer.

For fast copyable disks, Parameters will have to applied.  After copying 
the disk (if it is not present in the drive), you will be prompted to
insert the backup disk and the Parameter will be applied.  If the program
consists of more than one disk, you will be prompted to insert the others
as the copy goes along.  You may abort at any time.
