 BARBARIAN
-----------
How  to  Cheat  at  Barbarian.   If  you  are  totally  dismayed  at playing
Barbarian, here is a neat way to really go through it without dying.  First,
load  the  game, after the game actually starts up (you have to get past all
the intro screens, etc.) and after you have "pressed any key to begin", type
the  following:   04-08-59 Now you will have unlimited lives.  If you happen
to  fall off a cliff you will die but you won't lose any lives.  When one of
the  "bad guys" comes up to where you normally fight them, don't worry, just
walk  right  on  past  them.  It's like you are invisible to them.  (You CAN
still fight and kill them, however if you want to).  This actually makes the
game  kind  of boring, but you can search around and see where all the traps
and treasures are.



 HYBRIS
--------
Wait  until  the game goes into demo mode, when on the high score table type
COMMANDER..   then  in  the  game...   move to the left or right Press F7 to
toggles  the  cheat on/off ..  F1-F6 are for different addons F9 completes a
stage and F10 makes you invincible.

 DEFENDER OF THE CROWN
-----------------------
Hold down 'k' on the keyboard while the game is loading.  This will give you
a home army of 1024 knights and a campaign army of 1024 knights.

 PLATOON
---------
This one's cute.  Type in 'Hamburger' at the title screen.  The word 'Cheat'
will  appear below the credits press your joystck button, then (F5) when the
jungle  screen comes up.  Your man is now invulnerable to the attacks of the
little  Commie @#!!$&*s.  From here (F1) starts you where you are, (F2) puts
you  at  the  location of the explosives, (F3) takes you to the bridges that
you  have  to  blow  up,  (F4)  takes  you straight to the village where the
entrance  to  the  tunnels  is  hidden in one of the huts.  From here on the
cheat  no  longer  works,  the  game  runs  as normal and you can die but it
certainly gets you further along the track.


 ARKANOID
----------
Press  the Spacebar (Pause) then type 'DSIMAGIC' press Space again and catch
the Pill falling from the centre of the screen.  Once you have done this you
can  call  up  extra  paddles,  laser turret, etc, by typing the appropriate
letter  on  the  keyboard.   'F'  will  take you to the final screen and the
confrontation with 'DOH' (He's the dude that trapped you at the beginning of
the game).

 STREET FIGHTER
----------------
Here  is  another one I haven't tried.  It's more strategy than a cheat; All
of your opponents but the last, named Sagat in Thailand can be dispatched by
kicking  them in the ankle.  The technique for Sagat is 'Watch for fireballs
and his long reach.  Jump high, kick and retreat.  Repeat this process until
he falls.'

 WIZBALL
---------
Pause the game (spacebar) and type 'RAINBOW' resume the game and press space
again.  now hit 'C' to fill the pot with the current colour.

allow you to skip levels.

points from the fruit that emerges periodically, if you go to the upper left
corner entrance to the tunnel.

 F/A-18 INTERCEPTOR
--------------------
In  mission  6,  once  you've  fired  all your missiles, you can land on the
Shadow Sub (if it's still afloat) and it will refuel and rearm you.

 S.D.I.
--------
When  you're  in  the Russian space station, pick one man and keep firing at
him  10  to  15  times.   No other men will appear and you can keep doing it
until you get the girl.
