                 DICK TRACY: THE CRIME-SOLVING ADVENTURE

Quick Start Card

Dick Tracy for Amiga

This Quick Start Card contains details on loading and playing the game on 
your Amiga.  For complete details on game play and goals, see the Police
Procedure Handbook.

Equipment You Need

 o Amiga 500, 1000, 2000, 2500, 3000
 o 1 Meg of RAM
 o 3.5 inch disk drive

Getting Started

Before you do anything else, write-protect your original disks so you
can't accidentally copy over them.  You can do this by moving the tab on
the upper right corner of the disk so you can see through the window.

Hard Disk Users

 1. Turn on your Amiga.
 2. Insert Dick Tracy Disk 1 in the main floppy disk drive (df0:).
 3. Double-click on your hard drive's icon to open its window. 
 4. Click on the Empty drawer to select it.
 5. Pull down the Workbench menu and select Duplicate.
 6. Select the drawer you just made (called copy of Empty), pull down
    the Workbench menu, and select Rename.  Replace copy of Empty with
    TRACY for the new drawer name and press Return.
 7. Double-click on the Shell or CLI icon.
 8. Type COPY DF0:#? DH0:TRACY and press Return.
 9. Repeat step 8 with Dick Tracy Disks 2 and 3 inserted in the main
    floppy disk drive (df0:).
10. When the copying is complete, type ENDCLI and press Return.
11. Dick Tracy is now ready for you to play from the hard drive.

Floppy Disk Users

 1. Insert a Workbench disk in the main floppy disk drive (df0:) and turn
    the computer on.
 2. Remove the Workbench disk.
 3. Insert Tracy Disk 1 in the main floppy disk drive (df0:).
 4. Click once on the Tracy Disk 1 icon to select it.
 5. Pull down the Workbench menu and select Duplicate.
 6. There will be a series of requesters asking you to exchange disks.
    Insert the disk that the requester asks for and select Continue or
    Retry until the copying of the disk is complete.
 7. Repeat steps 3 through 6 with Tracy Disks 2 and 3.
 8. Do not write-protect the copies of your disks.
 9. Store the original disks in a clean, safe place.

Starting The Program

1. Hard Disk Users: Double-click on the TRACY drawer and then double-
   click on the Dick Tracy icon.  Note: If you have only 1 Meg of
   memory, press Ctrl-D while Workbench is loading (which is right after
   you turn on the power to your Amiga computer).  This prevents the
   Workbench program from loading, which leaves enough memory for the
   game to run properly.  To start the program, type CD DH0:TRACY and
   press Return.  Then type TRACY and press Return.
   Floppy Disk Users: Insert Dick Tracy Disk 1 in the main floppy disk
   drive and then turn on the computer (if your Amiga is already on,
   press Ctrl-A-A to reboot the computer).
2. You're asked the time a criminal committed a crime.  Using the 
   Criminal Code Wheel, find the mug shot of the criminal on the outer
   wheel.  Line up the gun on the inner wheel with the mug shot and then
   find the crime on the inner wheel.  Above that crime is a window with
   the time that the crime occurred.  Enter the time and press Return.
   You must use the number keys on the main keyboard; the number keys
   on the keypad will not work.  
   -= FUCK THAT: SKID ROW CRACKED THIS MUTHA =-

3. After you enter the correct time, you see the introduction screen.
   You can press Return to continue to Headquarters or wait for the
   program to automatically continue.
