JONAH WAS STOOD IN THE DARK, THE TWO GUARDS HAD AWOKEN HIM, AND HALF
DRAGGED,HALF CARRIED HIM HERE BLINDFOLDED FROM HIS CELL. HE TRIED TO FOCUS, 
BUT WITH NOTHING PIERCING THE DARKNESS, IT PROVED IMPOSSIBLE. THE ROOM FELT 
BIGTHOUGH,FELT COLD, AND FOR CERTAIN DID`NT FEEL WELCOMING.
`JONAH HALFBRIGHT ALOYSIUS TELEMACHUS HAYES` A VOICE BOOMED, YOU HAVE BEEN
FOUND GUILTY OF NON-PAYMENT OF THE MORTAGE ON YOUR CRAFT. YOU ARE 4 MONTHS
IN ARREARS, WITH NO INDICATION THAT YOU CAN EITHER MAINTAIN PAYMENTS OR MAKE
GOOD THE LACK OF PAYMENT SO FAR NEGLECTED. A SPOTLIGHT HIT THE AUTHORITARIAN
FIGURE WHO WAS SPEAKING, AS HIS VOICE CONTINUED TO BOOM AND ECHO AROUND THE
CAVERNOUS ROOM LONG AFTER HE HAD FINISHED SPEAKING. THE TWO GUARDS SUDDENLY
APPEARED, AS DID A DOCK, IN WHICH JONAH FOUND HIMSELF STOOD. HE WAS HANDCUFFED
TO BOTH GUARDS.
THE JUDGE, AS THE VOICE HAD NOW BECOME, CONTINUED TO READ OUT THE CHARGES. YOU
ARE ALSO CHARGED WITH TRANSPORTING ILLEGAL CARGOS THROUGH THE KNOWN SYSTEMS, 
OF THEFT, OF DECEPTION, OF PASSPORT FORGERY, OF...OF, OOOOH AND ALL SORTS OF
NASTY STUFF. AS HE SPOKE THE JUDGE CHANGED INTO JONAH`S MOTHER, HIS MOST HATED
TEACHER, HIS FLYING INSTRUCTOR, TO THE POLICEMAN AND BACK TO THE JUDGE AGAIN,
(Pause)...More(y/n/ns)? ns
BEFORE STARTING THE WHOLE CYCLE AGAIN IT STRUCK JONAH AS NOT BEING QUITE
RIGHT. HE WAS CLEVER LIKE THAT.

HOW D`YER PLEAD HAYES? BOOMED THE FIGURE, AS IT CHANGED INTO THE SHOPKEEPER
WHO HAD CAUGHT THE 14 YEAR OLD HAYES STEALING A BAG OF BULLSEYES FROM HIS SHOP
HAYES LOOKED HIM IN THE EYES. A BIT DIFFICULT AS THEY KEPT CHANGING POSITION
EVERY TIME HE MUTATED. THIS WAS HIS MOMENT, HIS CHANCE TO DEFEND HIMSELF, TO
SPEAK OUT AGAINST THE TERRIBLE TRAVESTY OF JUSTICE THAT WAS TAKING PLACE.
TO MAKE A STAND FOR THE LITTLE PEOPLE, THE PEOPLE LIKE HIMSELF WITH NO POWER,
AND NO RECOURSE TO JUSTICE. HE RAISED HIS HEAD, THREW BACK HIS SHOULDERS, AND
CLEARED HIS THROAT...`THEN HE BROKE WIND` NOT QUIETLY OR DISCREETLY, BUT IN A
WAY THAT INSURED THAT THE JUDGES VOICE WAS`NT THE ONLY THING BOOMING AND
ECHOING AROUND THE CHAMBER. THE TWO GUARDS BEGAN TO SHUFFLE SLOWLY AWAY FROM
HAYES, THE CUFFS CLINKING AS THEY DID.

THE JUDGE TURNED A FUNNY KIND OF PURPLY RED, AND SCREECHED..`HAYES, YOUR
CONTEMPT OOF COURT IS SUFFICIENT TO ENSURE THAT YOU WILL BE SEVERLY PUNISHED`
WITHOUT RECOURSE TO THE CHARGES ALREADY BROUGHT AGAINST YOU. YOU WILL SERVE
TEN YEARS IN THE REVERSE TIME ZONE. YOU WILL BE FORCED TO LIVE YOUR CHILDHOOD
ONCE AGAIN UNTIL SUCH A TIME AS YOU ARE FIT TO RETURN TO THE CIVILISED
SOCIETY. 

JONAHS STUBBLY CHIN DROPPED. `HERE,NO,HANG ABOUT!` A TOUCH OF DIGESTION YOUR
HOMOUR...MOTHER..SIR...A GLASS OF ANDREWS AND I`LL BE FINE...GERROF..LEMME GO.
OY.STOP! THAT. OW, THAT HURTS...

THE TWO GUARDS, NOW ARMED WITH ELECTRIC CATTLE PRODS, WERE FORCING HIM OUT OF
THE DOCK AND INTO A LONG CORRIDOR, AT THE END OF WHICH BEAMS OF LIGHT WERE
EMANTING FROM A BARRED DOOR. AS THEY REACHED IT. THE DOOR SWUNG OPEN OF ITS 
OWN ACCORD.AND JONAH FELL IN. THE DOOR CLOSED WITH A LOUD SLAM AND A SLOW
HUMMING BEGAN.

JONAH DRIPPING IN SWEAT, SPUN AROUND, AND THREW HIMSELF AGAINST THE DOOR, AND
BEGAN POUNDING IT. THEN HE HEARD A SLOW GRINDING NOISE JOIN THE EVER LOUDER
HUM. HE TURNED, AND REALISED THAT THE WALLS WERE CLOSING IN ON HIM...OH NO.
BLIMEY, HEAVENS TO BETSY..WARG!!! THE WALLS GOT CLOSER AND CLOSER, SQEEZING IN
ON HIM. HE TRIED TO PUSH AGAINST EACH WALL IN TURN, AND TO BUST THE DOOR, BUT
ALL WITHOUT SUCCESS. THE WALLS CONTINUED TO CLOSE IN. GETTING CLOSER AND
CLOSER, TIGHTER AND TIGHTER.
WITHIN A MINUTE THEY WERE INCHES AWAY FROM HIS FACE. HE COULD FEEL THEM
GETTING CLOSER, HIS BREATH FORCING BACK INTO HIS FACE, SEE THE TINY CRACKS, 
THE MORTAR, AS THEY BEGAN TO SQEEZE HIM, FORCE THE BREATH OUT OF HIS BODY.

HAYES AWOKE SCREAMING, HIS LIMBS THRASHING ABOUT AGAINST THE SLEEPING COFFIN
WALLS. HE SAT BOLT UPRIGHT, AND IMMEDIATELY SMASHED HIS HEAD AGAINST THE 
COFFIN ROOF. OW!! OUCH, COR BLIMEY...WHAT A NIGHTMARE.
HE LAID BACK, THE RELIEF PATENTLY CLEAR ON HIS FACE AS HE ALLOWED HIS USUAL
IMBECILIC SMILE CROSS HIS FACE.. HE CLEARED SLEEP FROM HIS EYES..
`OH WELL ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE`..
-------------------------==========================--------------------------
                                  BACKGROUND

SUSPICIOUS CARGO IS AN ADVENTURE GAME. IT IS SET IN THE NEAR FUTURE, AGAINST A
BACKGROUND OF SPACE TRAVEL AND MEGA-CORPORATIONS. WORLD WIDE CHAOS AND
DIS-ORDER WAS THE CONSEQUENCE OF HYPER-Z VIRUS WHICH SWEPT THE PANELT TOWARDS
THE END OF THE 20TH CENTURY. AS THE VIRUS SPREAD, SEVERAL MEDICALLY BASED
CORPORATIONS DEVELOPED ANTI-DOTES TO PROTECT THEIR MONOPOLY OF THE VACCINE.

AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THIS STRABGLEHOLD, THESE CORPORATIONS MANOEUVRED
THEMSELVES INTO POSITIONS OF INFLUENCE AND POWER. ONLY THEY COULD PROVIDE ANY
COUNTRY WITH THE VACCINE, AND IT WAS`NT CHEAP. IN ADDITION, ONE VERY 
CONVENIENT SIDE EFFECT WAS THE ADDICTIVE NATURE OF THE VACCINE, WHICH MEANT
MORE AND MORE WAS NEEDED EVERYWHERE. SOON THE MEGACORPS WERE IN THE POSITION
WHERE THEY WERE ABLE TO DICTATE TO GOVERMENTS AND COUNTRIES THE TERMS OF NEW
LEGISLATION AND RULINGS IN EXCHANGE FOR MORE SUPPLIES OF THE VACCINE. OVER
TIME, THE GOVERMENTS BECAME PUPPETS OF THE CORPORATIONS.

THE MEGA-CORPS, EACH BELIEVING THEIR POSITION TO BE UN-ASSAILEABLE, SOON BEGAN
TO ARGUE AND FIGHT OVER THE BEST WAYS TO EXPLOIT THEIR POSITION.EVENTUALLY A
BREAK UP ENSUED, AND ALL OUT WAR BETWEEN THE FACTIONS BEGAN.THEY WERE 
OBVIOUSLY IN A POSITION TO UTILISE CONVENTIONAL WEAPONARY AGAINST THE 
TERRITORIES THAT EACH DOMINATED, BUT BEING BASED IN MEDICINES, MANY SOUGHT
TO EXPLOIT THE EXPERTISE AND INFO THAT THEY ALREADY HAD.

ONE SUCH CORP, UNIVERSAL PRODUCTS(U.P) HAD BEEN DEVELOPING A GENETIC MUTANT
WARRIOR ON TITAN. IT HAS REACHED THE LIMIT OF ITS RESEARCH CAPABILITIES AND
MUST TRANSFER THE MUTANT TO EARTH TO CONTINUE WORK.UNFORTUNATELY, BOTH THE
DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSPORTATION OF GENETIC MUTANTS IS FORBIDDEN. IN ADDITION, 
IF ANY OTHER MEGA-CORP LEARNED OF ITS PLANS, THEY WOULD DOUBTLESSLY ATTEMPT TO
SABATAGE THE MISSION AND DESTROY THE MUTANT.(U.P) HAS THEREFORE DECIDED TO 
KEEP THE PROJECT SECRET AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT IT WOULD 
TAKE SOMEONE INCREDIBLY STUPID, OR WITH A LOT TO LOSE, OR PROBABLY BOTH, TO
EVEN CONSIDER SUCH AN ENDEAVOUR.

THAT MAN IS JONAS HAYES; SMUGGLER, PART TIME CONFIDENCE TRICKSTER AND ALL 
ROUND ANTI-HERO JONAH IS ALSO BY COINCEDIENCE, ALSO ON TITAN, HOLED UP IN THE
CHEAPEST COFFIN HOTAL HE COULD FIND. HE IS STRUGGLING WITH HIS REPAYMENTS ON
HIS SHIP, THE LUCKY LADY - A CONVERTED PASSENGER LINER, AND FACES AN UNCERTAIN
FUTURE, MAKES YER HEART BLEED DONT IT?

YOU ASSUME THE ROLE OF JONAH AS HE IS FORCED TO SMUGGLE THE CARGO FROM TITAN 
TO OLYMPUS SPACE STATION IN ORBIT AROUND THE EARTH. IT WONT BE AN EASY JOURNEY
THOUGH. ON THE WAY YOU MUST ANSWER A DISTRESS SIGNAL FROM A CRASHED SHIP; 
AVOID(U.P) THUGS CHECKING UP; DEAL WITH AN ILLEGAL ESCAPED PET ALIEN, FACE A
PIRATE ATTACK, EVADE AGENTS FROM A RIVAL CORPS,ESCAPE GALACTIC POLICE, FOOL
CUSTOMS, AND FINALLY PROVE YOUR INNOCENCE TO THE AUTHORITIES ON OLYMPUS. A
DIFFICULT TASK SURELY, BUT WITH JONAH AT THE CENTRE OF THINGS, SOME WOULD SAY
IMPOSSIBLE.

-------------------------==========================--------------------------
                                THE MAIN SCREEN

THIS IS THE SCREEN VIA WHICH THE MAJORITY OF YOUR ACTIONS ARE CARRIED OUT.
ALTHOUGH AT FIRST IT MIGHT LOOK VERY COMPLICATED, IN REALITY A QUICK GUIDED 
OUR SHOULD BE MORE THAN SUFFICIENT IN SHOWING YOU HOW TO FIND YOUR WAY AROUND
THE GAME.

THE SCREEN CAN BE SUBDIVIDED INTO FOUR MAIN HORIZONTAL SECTIONS WHICH ARE FROM
TOP TO BOTTOM..

(A) TOP OF SCREEN FROM LEFT TO RIGHT        - THE ENVIROMENT AND GRAPHIC ICONS

(B) JUST BELOW (A) AGAIN LEFT TO RIGHT      - THE MONITORS

(C) MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN FROM LEFT TO RIGHT - THE MAIN MODULE

(D) BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN FROM LEFT TO RIGHT  - THE DIRECTION ICON


THE ENVIROMENT AND GRAPHIC ICONS [A] [TOP OF SCREEN HORIZONTAL LEFT TO RIGHT]
--------------------------------
THESE ICONS ALLOW THE PLAYER TO AFFECT THE WAY THE GAME LOOKS ON SCREEN, AND 
TO CARRY OUT CERTAIN ACTIONS, THE THREE ICONS ON THE (TOP) LEFT ARE ENVIROMENT
ICONS, AND ALLOW THE LAYOUT OF THE SCREEN TO BE CHANGED AS DESIRED. FROM THE
STANDARD SCREEN TO TEXT ONLY SCREEN, FOR EXAMPLE. F1/F2/F3 WILL ALSO ACTIVATE
THESE SCREENS. AND YOU SHOULD EXPERIMENT WITH THEM TO DECIDE ON THE SCREEN
LAYOUT YOU PRFER. THE RIGHT THREE ICONS(TOP) RIGHT ARE GRAPHICS ICONS. THESE
ARE FROM LEFT TO RIGHT, FOR THE MAP SYSTEM, LOCATION GRAPHICS AND INTERACTIVE
PUZZLES. AGAIN F4/F5/F6 WILL ACTIVATE THEM. THE MAP SYSTEM ICON, WHICH IS ONLY
AVAILABLE WHEN YOU ARE ON BOARD YOUR SHIP, IS EXPLAINED IN MORE DETAIL LATER.
THE OTHER GRAPHICS ICONS WILL FLASH AND BLEEP WHEN THERE IS A RELEVANT PUZZLE
TO BE SOLVED.IF, FOR EXAMPLE YOUR CURRENT LOCATION HAS AN ILLUSTRATION, OR
THERE IS AN INTERACTIVE PUZZLE TO BE COMPLETED THE APPROPRIATE ICON WILL FLASH
AND A BLEEP WILL SOUND NOTIFYING YOU OF THIS.

MONITORS [B] JUST BELOW [A] HORIZONTAL LEFT TO RIGHT
--------
BELOW THE ENVIROMENT AND GRAPHICS ICONS ARE THE MONITORS WHICH DISPLAY 
PICTURES OF ALL THE CHARACTERS IN THE CURRENT LOCATION. EACH INDIVIDUAL 
MONITOR CAN BE TURNED ON/OFF BY PLACING THE MOUSE POINTER OVER THE LITTLE 
SWITCH ON THE TOP LEFT HAND CORNER OF EACH, OR BY USING F7/F8/F9.

ICON DRIVER [C] HORIZONTAL LEFT TO RIGHT - MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN - ]
-----------
BENEATH THE MONITORS AND TO THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE SCREEN IS THE ICON
DRIVER. THE DISPLAY VARIES ACCORDING TO THE SPCAE AVAILABLE. A SCROLL BAR
(SHOWN WITH UP/DOWN CURSOR) ENABLES YOU TO SCROLL UP/DOWN THE LIST IN PAGES OR
ITEM-BY-ITEM. THE ICON DRIVER IS HIERARCHICAL, IN THAT  COMMANDS ARE BUILT UP
SEQUENTIALLY. THERE ARE THREE MAIN DISPLAYS; ACTION ICONS PRIMARILY, THEN AN
ITEM LIST AND THEN A PREPOSITION LIST.

INITIALLY THE ICON DRIVER IS AT THE TOP MOST LEVEL, DISPLAYING THE ICONS
REPRESENTING ALL THE CURRENT ACTIONS AVAILABLE. CLICKING ON AN ACTION ICON
BRINGS UP A LIST OF ITEMS WHICH ARE RELEVANT TO THE ACTION AND THE SITUATION 
OF THE PLAYER.SO, FOR EXAMPLE, SHOULD YOU CLICK ON THE `OPEN` ICON, A LIST OF
ALL OPENABLE OBJECTS IN YOUR CURRENT LOCATION WILL BE PRESENTED. IF YOU CLICK
ON AN `ACTION` ICON AND NOTHING HAPPENS, THEN THAT ACTION IS CURRENTLY NOT
AVAILABLE.IF, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU CLICKED ON `OPEN` AND THERE IS NOTHING TO
`OPEN`, THEN THE ICON WILL BE IN-ACTIVE.

THE SENTENCE WHICH IS BEING CONSTRUCTED IS DISPLAYED AT THE TOP OF THE WINDOW.
THIS LINE WILL INFORM YOU OF THE ACTION WHICH ANY ICON WILL CARRY OUT, SHOULD
YOU BE UNSURE AS TO WHAT A PARTICULAR ICON IS.IF YOU CLICK ON IT, THE ACTION
ITS CARRIES OUT WILL BE DISPLAYED HERE.

BELOW THE CURRENT SENTENCE IS A LIST OF ITEMS, CONSISTING OF AN ICON, AND
THE THE ITEM NAME. AN ITEM CAN BE SELECTED BY CLICKING ON EITHER THE ITEM 
ICON OR THE ITEM NAME.

SOME ACTIONS ALLOW PREPOSITIONS SUCH AS IN/ON/UNDER/WITH ect..AND THESE CAN 
COME BEFORE OR AFTER AN ITEM. AN `EXECUTE` OPTION WILL DO JUST THAT; EXECUTE
THE CURRENT COMMAND WITHOUT USING FURTHER PREPOSITION WORDS. SO SHOULD THERE 
BE CHOICE, FOR EXAMPLE; `SEARCH DRAWERS IN THE RED DESK`, WHERE THE FIRST.
SEARCHES ALL THE DRAWERS IN THE RED DESK, IN ORDER TO CARRY OUT THE BRIEFER
COMMAND FROM THE ICON MENU, YOU WOULD NEED TO END IT WITH THE `EXECUTE`
COMMAND. ALSO, MANY ACTIONS YOU WILL WANT TO CARRY OUT WILL HAVE TWO ITEMS,
WITH A PREPOSITION SEPERATING THEM.SO, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU COULD `PUT BAG IN
CUPBOARD` THE ICON DRIVER AUTOMATICALLY HANDLES THE SEQUENCE OF
ACTION-ITEM-PREPOSITION-ITEM. AT ANY STAGE, YOU CAN USE THE `CANCEL`OPTION TO
RETURN TO THE ACTION ICON LIST. ALL THIS MIGHT MAKE USING THE ICON INTERFACE
SOUND VERY COMPLICATED, BUT AFTER A FEW MINUTES EXPERIMENTING WITH THE ICONS
AND THEIR EFFECTS, YOU SHOULD FIND THEM EXTREMELY CONVENIENT AND EASY TO USE.
CONSIDER THIS PRACTICAL EXAMPLE. THE FIRST ACTION YOU MUST CARRY OUT IN THE
GAME IS TO `PUSH PAD`,SO,FIRST OF ALL, FIND THE ICON FOR `PUSH`. WHICH IS THE
FIFTH ICON DOWN ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE. CLICK ON THIS, AND THE WORD PUSH WILL
APPEAR AT THE TOP OF THE ICON PANEL. THE ICONS WILL NOW BE REPLACED WITH A 
LIST OF OBJECTS YOU CAN PUSH. SELECT THE PAD AND THEN CLICK ON THE `EXECUTE`
ICON. SIMPLE AS THAT...

IN THIS SUB MENU CLICKING ON CANCEL WILL RETURN YOU TO THE MAIN MENU.  
-------------------------==========================--------------------------
                             THE TEXT WINDOW

THE TEXT WINDOW TO THE RIGHT OF THE ICON DRIVER IS WHERE ALL COMMANDS YOU 
ISSUE WILL BE PRINTED, AND WHERE YOU WILL BE PRESENTED WITH THE RESULT OF THE
ACTION IN THE FORM OF TEXT. THE WAY THAT THE COMPUTER DOES THIS IS BY USING
WHAT IS KNOWN AS A `PARSER` WHICH INTERPERTS YOUR COMMANDS,ORIGINALLY,PARSERS
WERE VERY SIMPLE AND RUDIMENTERY, BUT THINGS HAVE MOVED ON, AND THE PARSER IN
SUSPICIOUS CARGO IS A FULLY-FEATURED MULTIPLE SENTENCE ANALYSER WHICH ACCEPTS
COMMANDS IN ENGLISH SENTENCES.EACH SENTENCE MUST HAVE A VERB(OR ACTION) AND
MUST BE SIMILAR TO AN ENGLISH COMMAND, SUCH AS `take the credit card`
`eat the greasy hamburger`, put the ming vase in the smelly sack` `ask the old
stooping man for a dime`.
SENTENCES CAN BE SEPERATED USING THE STANDARD FULL STOP,COMMA OR SEMI-COLON.
THE PARSER WILL UNDERSTAND FAR MORE COMMANDS THAN THE ICON DRIVER, BUT IT
SHOULD BE NOTED THAT ALL COMMANDS TO COMPLETE THE GAME ARE AVAILABLE ON THE
ICON DRIVER. PRONOUNS(IT,THEM,ect) PLURALS AND PREPOSITIONS(IN,FORM) ARE ALL
ACCEPTED AND UNDERSTOOD.IN ADDITION SPEECH,EXCEPTIONS AND POSITIONAL 
REFERENCES ARE ACCEPTED.

CONVERSING WITH OTHER CHARACTERS
--------------------------------
CONVERSATION IS GENERALLY HANDLED BY USING ONE OF THE FOLLOWING TWO PHRASES.

ASK PERSON ABOUT (or FOR) SOMETHING
TELL PERSON ABOUT SOMETHING

OTHER WORDS CAN BE USED,BUT IF YOU STICK TO THE ABOVE 2 METHODS OF PHRASING,
THE CHANCES ARE YOU WILL BE UNDERSTOOD EVERY TIME. IN CERTAIN CASES YOU MAY 
NOT BE SPECIFIC ENOUGH ABOUT AN ITEM, IN WHICH YOU WILL BE PROMPTED FOR MORE
INFO. IF THERE ARE 2 PENCILS,FOR EXAMPLE, A BLUE AND A GREEN, THEN TYPING;

get pencil (IS NOT SPECIFIC ENOUGH AND YOU WOULD BE PROMPTED)

which one the blue pencil? or the green pencil? 9TO WHICH YOU WOULD TYPE)

THE BLUE PENCIL /OR BLUE / OR BLUE PENCIL

YOU MAY ALSO BE ASKED: with what?
                       what do you want me to put the item in?

AGAIN, THESE QUESTIONS SHOULD BE ANSWERED BY TYPING IN THE APPROPRIATE ANSWER.
IF YOU WANT TO CARRY ON, YOU CAN IGNORE THE QUESTION AND TYPE ANOTHER SENTENCE

THERE ARE A NUMBER OF EDITING COMMANDS, ALL OF WHICH ARE LISTED, AT THE END OF
THIS DOCUMENT.

THE MOVEMENT PANEL
------------------
THE FINAL SECTION OF THE MAIN SCREEN IS THE MOVEMENT PANEL. THIS DISPLAYS ALL
THE EXITS FROM THE CURRENT LOCATION AS FLASHING ARROWS. THE PLAYER CAN MOVE IN
ANY DIRECTION BY CLICKINGON THE APPROPRIATE ARROW. IF YOU CANNOT MOVE IN A
PARTICULAR DIRECTION OR ARE BLOCKED, YOU WILL BE INFORMED SO.
A LIST OF ALL AVAILABLE EXITS CAN BE DISPLAYED IF YOU TYPE `EXITS` IF YOU KNOW
YOUR DESTINATION THEN THE SHORTHAND `GO` AND `RUN` COMMANDS CAN BE USED TO 
MOVE ANYWHERE VERY QUICKLY. THE FORM IS SIMPLY;
`go bridge` OR `run coffin hotel` (OF COURSE ITS WITHOUT THE `) THE ONLY
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO IS THAT `GO` DESCRIBES LOCATIONS ON THE WAY, 
WHEREAS `RUN` DESCRIBES THE FINAL LOCATION. SHOIULD ANYTHING HAPPEN ON THE WAY
THE ACTION IS STOPPED. IN ADDITION, THE MAP SCREEN CAN BE USED TO MOVE AROUND
THE SHIP.

THE MAP
-------
THE MAP SYSTEM HAS 2 FUNCTIONS, FIRSTLY DISPLAYING THE LAYOUT OF THE SHIP(TO
SAVE MANUAL MAPPING) AND SECONDLY TO ALLOW FAST AND EASY MOVEMENT. IT IS
INVOKED BY CLICKING ON THE MAP ICON, AVAILABLE ONCE ON BOARD SHIP. THE FIRST
MAP YOU WILL SEE IS A SIDE PLAN OF THE SHIP, WITH INDEXED BOXES SHOWING THE
SHIP DECKS.

JONAHS CURRENT POSITION IS REPRESENTED BY A `J`. THE POSITIONS OF OTHER
CHARACTERS ARE INDICATED BY THEIR RESPECTIVE INITIAL LETTERS. BY CLICKING IN
ANY OF THE INDEXED BOXES, A DECK PLAN WILL BE DISPLAYED SHOWING ALL POSSIBLE
LOCATIONS ON DECK. SIMPLY CLICK ON THE DESIRED LOCATION TO MOVE THERE. THE 
MAIN SCREEN IS RE-DISPLAYED AND, BARRING ANY OBSTACLES, THE PLAYER IS MOVED TO 
THE SPECIFIED LOCATION.

ARCADE AND PUZZLE INTERACTIVES
------------------------------
THROUGH OUT SUSPICIOUS CARGO THERE ARE `INTERACTIVES` ARCADE AND PUZZLE
ORIENTATED DIVERSIONS FROM THE MAIN GAME THAT CAN EITHER BE COMPLETED OR 
SIMPLY SKIPPED IF YOU PREFER.
 THE INTERACTIVES ARE DEALT WITH ACCORDING TO THEIR TYPE. THE THREE ACTION
INTERACTIVES ARE AUTOMATICALLY ENTERED, WHEREAS THE TWO LOGIC INTERACTIVES
USE THE INTERACTIVE ICON. THIS ICON FLASHES TO INDICATE THAT THERE IS A LOGIC
PUZZLE IN THE CURRENT POSITION. THE LOGIC PUZZLE CAN BE ENTERED AND EXITED AT
THE SAME TIME, AND SHOULD BE TREATED AS A VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF A TEXT
PUZZLE.

BEFORE EACH INTERACTIVE, YOU WILL BE PRESENTED WITH A MENU TELLING YOU THE 
NAME OF THE INTERACTIVE TO PLAY IT, OR ON THE BOX LABELLED `BYPASS` TO SKIP IT

BYPASS
------
MOUSE OPERATED. WHEN YOU ENTER THIS PUZZLE, YOU WILL FIND A SQUARE CIRCUIT
BOARD MADE UP OF FOUR CIRCUIT SECTIONS, SIXTEEN SECTIONS IN ALL. IN THE TOP
LEFT HAND CORNER YOU WILL FIND 4 DIFFERENT COLOURED SYMBOLS, EACH OF WHICH
IS AT THE TOP OF A PILE OF FOUR, AGAIN, SIXTEEN IN TOTAL. YOU MUST PLACE
SIXTEEN COLOURED SYMBOLS ON THE SQUARES IN THE CIRCUIT BOARDS IN ORDER TO
COMPLETE THE SIXTEEN LINES OF ELECTRICITY FLOW, FOUR VERTICAL AND FOUR
HORIZONTAL. EACH SYMBOL IS PICKED UP BY CLICKING ON IT WITH THE LEFT MOUSE
BUTTON, AND IS PLACED BY MOVING IT OVER THE APPROPRIATE SQUARE AND CLICKING
THE MOUSE BUTTON AGAIN. WHEN A LINE IS COMPLETED, A BLACK FLASHING LINE WILL
APPEAR BEHIND THE SYMBOLS. THE PUZZLE IS LOGICAL, BUT IT MAY TAKE YOU SOME 
TIME TO FIGURE OUT JUST HOW TO COMPLETE IT.

OF COURSE, IF YOU GET COMPLETELY DISTRAUGHT TRYING TO SOLVE IT, CLICKING ON
THE EXIT WILL TAKE YOU BACK TO THE MAIN GAME.

CARGO BAY
---------
MOUSE OPERATED. THE CARGO BAY OF THE LUCKY LADY LIES BETWEEN YOU AND THE COLD
SLEEP CHAMBER. IF YOU WANT TO GET FROM THE MAIN SHIP TO THE CHAMBER, TO GET
BACK TO THE MAIN SHIP FROM IT, YOU MUST TRAVEL THROUGH THE CARGO BAY.

THE CARGO BAY IS REPRESENTED BY A 3 DIMENSIONAL VIEW, AS WELL AS AN OVERHEAD
VIEW. BOTH EXITS FROM THE BAY ARE MARKED BY A `J`. YOU WILL ALSO DISCOVER A
CRATE DOWN THERE. THIS CONTAINS YOUR CARGO, WHO WILL, AT SOME POINT, DECIDE
THAT THE CRATE IS TO LIMITING AND GO ON WALKABOUT IN THE BAY. ITS THE UP TO
YOU TO KILL THE ALIEN BY SHOOTING IT THREE TIMES WITH YOUR BLASTER BEFORE IT
SEALS YOUR FATE, WHICH MIGHT EVEN BE A PREMATURE DEATH IF YOUR NOT CAREFUL.

MOVEMENT AND FIRING IS ACCOMPLISHED BY CLICKING THE MOUSE POINTER OVER THE
APPROPRIATE KEY. BENEATH THIS IS A 4 DIMENSIONAL PAD, ONE POINT OF WHICH WILL
BE LIT. THIS INDICATES WETHER JONAH IS FACING, NORTH,SOUTH,EAST OR WEST. IF 
THE ALIEN IS PRESENT, A PANEL TO THE RIGHT WILL APPEAR, WITH A YELLOW BAR
WHICH INDICATES THE POSITION AND PROXIMITY OF THE ALIEN TO JONAH. THE WIDER 
THE YELLOW BEAM THE CLOSER THE ALIEN. IF THE YELLOW BAR APPEARS ONLY TO THE
RIGHT OF CENTRE, IT MEANS THAT THE ALIEN IS JUST RIGHT OF JONAH,LEFT OF THE
CENTRE..ALIEN IS LEFT OF JONAH.SO, FOR EXAMPLE IF THE YELLOW BAR IS EXTENDED 
TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT, BUT ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE, THEN THE ALIEN IS DIRECTLY 
IN FRONT OF JONAH, BUT QUITE A DISTANCE AWAY, BUT IF IT IS A LONG BAR ALL TO 
THE RIGHT OF CENTRE, THEN THE ALIEN IS IMMEDIATELY TO YOUR RIGHT.

WHEN YOU SHOOT THE BLASTER, REMEMBER TO ALLOW A LITTLE TIME FOR RECHARGE,
INDICATED BY BLASTER RECHARGE BAR ON PANEL.

THERE ARE 2 EXITS ON THE CARGO DECK, ONE TO THE SERVICE LIFT, AND ONE TO THE 
CRYO CHAMBER. EITHER EXIT CAN BE TAKEN BY MOVING TOWARDS THE RELEVANT
DOOR,INDICATED BY NAME.

THE PANEL OF 6 KEYS CAN ALSO BE CONTROLLED FROM THE KEYBOARD BY USING THE
FOLLOWING NUMBERS ON THE NUMBER PAD..

                             7 ] 8 ] 9 ]
                             -----------
                             4 ] 5 ] 6 ]
                             -----------
LANDER
------
THE LANDER HAS 2 STAGES, LANDING ON THE MOON, AND RETURNING TO THE SHIP. BOTH
STAGES ARE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME, EXCEPT FOR THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL. ON
LANDING THE SHUTTLE MUST BE VERTICAL, NOSE TO THE TOP OF THE SCREEN AND MUST
HAVE A LOW VELOCITY. ON RETURN, THE SHUTTLE MUST REACH THE TARGET CROSSHAIR
WHICH WILL APPEAR ON THE SCREEN.

THE KEYS ARE;  Z      ROTATE LEFT
               X      ROTATE RIGHT
               SHIFT  THRUST
               P      PAUSE
               ESC    BYPASS THE LANDER GAME
-------------------------==========================--------------------------
                               REPEL BOARDERS

A SIMPLE SHOOT EM UP GAME REQUIRING ONLY THE FAITHFUL BLASTER .CHARGE IS 
SHOWN AT THE BOTTOM IN BAR FORM AND WILL BE THE SAME AS IS IN THE GAME, AS AN
ALIEN INTERACTIVE. ALONG THE TOP OF THE SCREEN IS THE DAMAGE BAR. JONAH CAN
SUSTAIN A NUMBER OF HITS BEFORE DEATH. IN ORDER TO REPEL BOARDERS ALL PIRATES
MUST BE KILLED. THE MOUSE IS USED TO MOVE CROSSHAIRS ROUND THE SCREEN. YOU 
HAVE A LIMIT OF 60 SHOTS, BUT THAT IS MORE THAN ENOUGH TO KILL ALL THE PIRATES
PRESSING THE RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON WILL KILL ALL THE PIRATES CURRENTLY ON THE
SCREEN, BUT WILL COST YOU 5 OF YOUR 60 SHOTS.

BACKGROUND
Suspicious Cargo is an adventure game.  It is set in the near future,
against a background of space travel and mega-corporations.  World wide
chaos and disorder was the consequence of the Hyper-Z virus which swept
the planet towards the end of the 20th Century.  As the virus spread,
several medically based corporations developed antidotes and instead of
racing to be the first to mass produce it, acted together to protect and
exploit their monopoly of the vaccine.

As a direct consequence of this stranglehold, these corporations
manoeuvred themselves into positions of influence and power.  Only they
could provide any country with the vaccine, and it wasn't cheap.  In
addition, one very convenient side effect was the addictive nature of
the vaccine, which meant that more and more was needed everywhere.  Soon
the megacorps were in a position where they were able to dictate to
governments and countries the terms of new legislation and rulings in
exchange for more supplies of the vaccine.  Over time, the governments
became puppets of the corporations.

The megacorps, each believing their position to be unassailable, soon
began to argue and fight over the best ways to exploit their position.
Eventually, a break-up ensued, and an all out war between the many
factions began.  They were obviously in a position to utilise
conventional weaponry against the territories that each dominated, but
being based in medicines, many sought to exploit the expertise and
information they already had.

One such corp, Universal Products (U.P.), has been developing a genetic
mutant warrior on Titan.  It has reached the limit of its research
capabilities and must transfer the mutant to Earth to continue work.
Unfortunately, both the development and transportation of genetic
mutants is strictly forbidden.  In addition, if any other megacorps
learned of their plans, they would doubtless attempt to sabotage the
mission and destroy the mutant.  U.P. has therefore decided that
smuggling is the only remaining option to keep the project secret as
long as possible.  The only problem is that it would take someone
incredibly stupid, or without a lot to lose, or more probably both, to
even consider such an endeavour.

That man is Jonah Hayes: smuggler, part-time confidence trickster and
all round anti-hero.  Jonah is, by coincidence, also on Titan, holed up
in the cheapest coffin hotel he could find.  He is struggling with his
repayments on his ship, the Lucky Lady - a converted passenger liner,
and faces a bleak and uncertain future.  Makes your heart bleed, doesn't
it?

You assume the role of Jonah as he is forced to smuggle the cargo from
Titan to Olympus Space Station in orbit around the Earth.  It won't be
an easy journey though.  On the way you must answer a distress call from
a crashed ship; deal with an illegal pet alien; face a pirate attack;
avoid UP thugs checking up on you; escape Galactic police; fool customs;
and finally prove your innocence to authorities on Olympus.  A difficult
task surely, but with Jonah at the centre of things, some would say
impossible.


ADVENTURING 1990's STYLE
For the uninitiated, an adventure game is one where the player interacts
in a realistic manner with a computer controlled environment.  The
player will 'ask' the computer to carry out an action, and the computer
will then present the result of that action on the screen.  If, for
example, the player types 'GO WEST', or 'WEST', or 'W', the computer
will move the player a designated distance to the west, then stop and
describe what is found when the player gets there.  On a more
sophisticated level, the player might ask the computer to 'TAKE THE
WOODEN CLUB FROM THE TRAVEL BAG AND HIT THE GORILLA WITH IT'.  Again,
the computer would carry out this action and relay the results via the
monitor.

This doesn't mean, however, that if you can't type the game will take
forever.  Suspicious Cargo can, in fact, be solved without typing a
single word.  This is because the game has been designed to be as
intuitive and user friendly as possible.  Even if you are an adept
typist, you will find that some operations are a lot easier when the
mouse is used, because it's faster, and there are no typing mistakes.

Apart from the keyboard, your mouse pointer will be the means of
interaction.  All aspects of the game are controllable by the mouse, and
it even allows you to configure the game to your particular
requirements.  How the main screen works is explained in the following
section.


THE MAIN SCREEN
This is the screen via which the vast majority of your actions are
carried out.  Although at first it might look very complicated, in
reality a quick guided tour should be more than sufficient in showing
you how to find your way around the game.

      +---------------------------------------------------------+
    A |                                                         |
      +-------------+-------------+--------------+--------------+

    B |             |             |              |              |
      |             |             |              |              |
      +-------------+---+---+-----+--------------+--------------+

      |                 |   |                                   |
      |                 |   |                                   |
    C |                 |   |                                   |
      |                 |   |                                   |
      |                 |   |                                   |
      |                 |   |                                   |
      +-----------------+---+-----------------------------------+
    D |                                                         |
      +---------------------------------------------------------+

The screen can be subdivided into four main horizontal sections, which
are, from top to bottom, the Environment and Graphic Icons (A), the
Monitors (B), the Main Module (C) and the Direction Icon (D).  Each
section is used to control a particular aspect of the gameplay, and
makes playing the game very straightforward.

THE ENVIRONMENT AND GRAPHIC ICONS
These icons allow the player to affect the way that the game looks on
screen, and to carry out certain actions.  The three icons on the left
are Environment Icons, and allow the layout of the screen to be changed
as desired, from the standard screen to a text only screen, for example,
F1, F2 and F3 will also activate these screens, and you should
experiment with them to decide on the screen layout you prefer.  The
right three icons are graphic icons.  These are, from left to right, for
the map system, location graphics and interactive puzzles.  Again, they
can be activated when appropriate by using F4, F5 and F6.  The map
system icon, which is only available when you are on board your ship,
is explained in more detail later.  The other graphic icons will flash
and bleep when there is a relevant graphic to be viewed, or an
interactive puzzle to be solved.  If, for example, your current location
has an illustration, or there is an interactive puzzle to be completed,
the appropriate icon will flash, and a 'bleep' will sound notifying you
of this.

MONITORS
Below the Environment and Graphic icons are the monitors which display
pictures of all the characters in the current location.  Each individual
monitor can be turned on or off by placing the mouse pointer over the
little switch on the top left hand corner of each, or by using F7 to
F10.

THE ICON DRIVER

          +---------------+--+------------------------------+
          |               |  |                              |
          |               |  |                              |
          |               |  |                              |
          |               |  |                              |
          |               |  |                              |
          |               |  |                              |
          +---------------+--+------------------------------+
                  A        B

Beneath the monitors and to the left hand side of the screen is the icon
driver (A).  The display varies according to the space available.  A
scroll bar to the right (B) enables you to scroll up and down the list
in pages, or item-by-item.  The icon driver is hierarchical, in that the
commands are built up sequentially, then an item list; and a preposition
list.

Initially, the icon driver is at the top-most level, displaying the
icons representing all the current actions available.  Clicking on an
action brings up a list of items which are relevant to the action and
the situation of the player.  So, for example, should you click on the
OPEN icon, a list of all the openable objects in your current location
will be presented.  If you click on an action icon and nothing happens,
then that action is not currently available.  If, for example, you click
on 'OPEN' and there is nothing to open, then the icon will be inactive.

The sentence which is being constructed is displayed at the top of the
window.  This line will also inform you of the actions which any icon
will carry out, should you be unsure as to what a particular icon is.
If you click on it, the action it carries out will be displayed here.

Below the current sentence is a list of items, consisting of an icon and
the item name.  An item can be selected by simply clicking on either the
item icon or item name.

Some actions allow prepositions such as in/on/under/with etc. and these
can come before or after the item.  An EXECUTE option will do just that:
execute the current command without using further preposition words.  So
should there be a choice, for example 'SEARCH DRAWERS', or 'SEARCH
DRAWERS IN THE RED DESK', where the first searches all the drawers in
the room, and the second searches the drawers in the red desk, in order
to carry out the briefer command from the icon menu, you would need to
end it with the EXECUTE command.  Also, many actions you will want to
carry out will have two items, with a preposition separating them.  So,
for example, you could 'PUT BAG IN CUPBOARD'.  The icon driver
automatically handles the sequence of Action-Item-Preposition-Item.  At
any stage, you can use the CANCEL option to return to the action icon
list.  All this might make using the icon interface sound very
complicated, but after a few minutes experimenting with the icons and
their effects, you should find them extremely convenient and easy to
use.  Consider this practical example.  The first action you must carry
out in the game is to 'PUSH PAD'.  So, first of all, find the icon for
'PUSH', which is the fifth icon down on the left hand side.  Click on
this, and the word push will appear on the top of the icon panel.  The
icons will now be replaced with a list of objects you can push.  Select
the 'PAD', and then click on the 'EXECUTE' icon.  Simple as that.  The
following diagram and list shows you exactly what action each of the
icons represent, and the sub-menus.

       +----+----+----+
       | 1  | 2  | 3  |    1. TAKE      2. DROP     3. INVENTORY
       +----+----+----+
       | 4  | 5  | 6  |    4. LOOK      5. EXAMINE  6. SEARCH
       +----+----+----+
       | 7  | 8  | 9  |    7. ASK       8. TELL     9. READ
       +----+----+----+
       | 10 | 11 | 12 |   10. PUT      11. USE     12. TURN
       +----+----+----+
       | 13 | 14 | 15 |   13. PUSH     14. PULL    15. MOVE
       +----+----+----+
       | 16 | 17 | 18 |   16. OPEN     17. CLOSE   18. WAIT
       +----+----+----+
       | 19 | 20 | 21 |   19. GIVE     20. SHOW    21. HIT
       +----+----+----+
       | 22 | 23 | 24 |   22. WEAR     23. REMOVE  24. FIND
       +----+----+----+
       | 25 | 26 | 27 |   25. EAT      26. DRINK   27. TASTE
       +----+----+----+
       | 28 | 29 | 30 |   28. SCORE    29. DISK    30. SYSTEM
       +----+----+----+

DISK OPTION: When you choose the disk option, you will be taken to a
secondary sub-menu, which will offer the following choices.

       +----+----+----+
       | 1  | 2  | 3  |    1. LOAD      2. RAMLOAD  3. RESTART
       +----+----+----+
       | 4  | 5  | 6  |    4. SAVE      5. RAMSAVE  6. CANCEL
       +----+----+----+

In this sub-menu, clicking on Cancel will return you to the main menu.

SYSTEM OPTION: Again, choosing the System Option will take you to
another sub-menu, where you will be able to alter the game system.  The
options are as follows:

      +----+----+----+    Text
      | 1  | 2  | 3  |    1. BRIEF    2. NORMAL     3. VERBOSE
      +----+----+----+    Information
      | 4  | 5  | 6  |    4. SCENERY  5. EXITS      6. SCORE
      +----+----+----+    Text
      | 7  | 8  | 9  |    7. SIZE     8. COLOUR     9. CANCEL
      +----+----+----+

In the System Sub-menu, clicking on the Cancel option will take you back
to the main icon Menu.


THE TEXT WINDOW
The text window to the right of the icon driver is where all the
commands you issue will be printed, and where you will be presented with
the result of an action in the form of text.  The way that the computer
does this is by using what is known as a 'parser', which interprets
your commands.  Originally, parsers were very simple and rudimentary,
but things have moved on, and the parser in Suspicious Cargo is a fully-
featured sentence analyser which accepts commands in English sentences.
Each sentence must have a verb (or action), and must be similar to an
English command, such as TAKE THE CREDIT CARD; EAT THE GREASY HAMBURGER;
PUT THE MING VASE IN THE SMELLY SACK; ASK THE OLD STOOPING MAN FOR A
DIME.
Sentences can be separated using the standard full-stop, comma or semi-
colon.  The parser will understand far more commands than the icon
driver, but it should be noted that all the commands to complete the
game are available on the icon driver.  Pronouns (it, them), plurals and
prepositions (in, from) are all accepted and understood.  In addition
speech, exceptions and positional references are accepted.


CONVERSING WITH OTHER CHARACTERS
Conversation is generally handled by using one of the following two
phrases:

ASK PERSON ABOUT (or FOR) SOMETHING
TELL PERSON ABOUT SOMETHING

Other words can be used, but if you stick to the above methods of
phrasing, the chances are you will be understood every time.  In certain
cases you may not be specific enough about an item, in which case you
will be prompted for more information.  If there were two pencils, for
example, a blue pencil and a green pencil, then typing:

GET PENCIL

Is not specific enough, and you would be prompted:

WHICH ONE? THE GREEN PENCIL OR THE BLUE PENCIL.

to which you could type:

THE BLUE PENCIL
BLUE PENCIL
BLUE

You may also be asked:

WITH WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO PUT THE ITEM IN?

Again, these questions should be answered by typing in the appropriate
answer.  If you want to carry on, you can ignore the question and type
another sentence.

There are a number of special editing commands, all of which are listed,
at the end of this document.


THE MOVEMENT PANEL
The final section of the main screen is the movement panel.  This
displays all the exits from the current location as flashing arrows.
The player can move in any direction by clicking on the appropriate
arrow.  The directions available are the eight main compass points, and
Up, Down, In or Out.  If you cannot move in a particular direction or
are blocked, you will be informed so.  A list of available exits can be
displayed if you type EXITS.

If you know your destination then the shorthand GO and RUN commands can
be used to move anywhere very quickly.  The form is simply:

GO BRIDGE
RUN COFFIN HOTEL

The only difference between the two is that GO describes locations on
the way, whereas RUN only describes the final location and events on the
way.  Should anything happen on the way, the action is stopped.  In
addition, the map screen can be used to move around the ship.


THE MAP
The map system has two functions, firstly displaying the layout of the
ship (to save manual mapping), and secondly to allow fast and easy
movement.  It is invoked by clicking on the map icon, available once on
board the ship.  The first map you will see is a side plan of the ship,
with indexed boxes showing the ships decks.

Jonah's current position is represented by a 'J'.  The positions of
other characters are represented by their respective initial letters.
By clicking in any of the indexed boxes, a deck plan will be displayed
showing all the possible locations on that deck.  Simply click on the
desired location to move there.  The main screen is re-displayed and,
barring any obstacles, the player is moved to the desired location.


ARCADE AND PUZZLE INTERACTIVES
Throughout Suspicious Cargo there are 'interactive', arcade and puzzle
orientated diversions from the main game that can either be completed,
or simply skipping if you prefer.

The interactives are dealt with according to their type.  The three
action interactives are automatically entered, whereas the two logic
interactives use the Interactive Icon.  This icon flashes to indicate
that there is a logic puzzle in the current location.  The logic puzzle
can be entered and exited at any time, and should be treated as a visual
representation of a text puzzle.

Before each interactive, you will be presented with a menu telling you
the name of the interactive.  Simply click on the first option box,
containing the name of the interactive to play it, or on the box
labelled 'Bypass' to skip it.

1. BYPASS
Mouse Operated.  When you enter this puzzle, you will find a square
circuit board made up of four by four circuit sections, sixteen sections
in total.  In the top left hand corner you will find four different
coloured symbols, each of which is at the top of a pile of four, again,
sixteen in total.  You must place the sixteen coloured symbols on the
squares of the circuit boards in order to complete the sixteen lines of
electricity flow, four vertical and four horizontal.  Each symbol is
picked up by clicking on it with the left mouse button, and is placed by
moving it over the appropriate square and clicking the mouse button
again.  When a line is completed, a black flashing line will appear
behind the symbols.  The puzzle is logical, but it may take you some
time to figure out just how to complete it.

Of course, if you get completely distraught trying to solve it, clicking
on Exit will take you back to the main game.

2. CARGO BAY
Mouse Operated.  The cargo bay of the Lucky Lady lies between you and
the cold sleep chamber.  If you want to get from the main ship to the
chamber, to get back to the main ship from it, you must travel through
the cargo bay.

The cargo bay is represented by a three dimensional view, as well as an
overhead view.  Both exits from the bay are marked on the overhead view
map, and Jonah's position is marked by a J.  You will also discover a
crate down there.  This contains your cargo, who will, at some point,
decide that the crate is too limiting and go walkabout in the bay.  It's
then up to you to kill the alien by shooting it three times with your
blaster before it seals your fate, which might be a premature death if
you're not careful.

Movement and firing is accomplished by clicking the mouse pointer over
the appropriate key.  Beneath this is a four directional pad, one point
of which will be lit.  This indicates whether jonah is facing north,
south, east or west.  If the alien is present, a panel to the right will
appear, with a yellow bar which indicates the position and proximity of
the alien to Jonah.  The wider the yellow beam, the closer the alien.
If the yellow bar appears only to the right of centre, it means the
alien is just to the right of Jonah, and if the bar is yellow on the
left, then the alien is to the left.  So, for example, if the yellow bar
is extended to the left and right, but only for a short distance, then
the alien is directly in front of Jonah, but quite a distance away, but
if it is a long bar all to the right of the centre, then the alien is
immediately to your right.

When you shoot the blaster, remember to allow a little time for
recharge, indicated by blaster recharge bar on the panel.

There are two exits on the cargo deck, one on the service lift, and one
to the cryo chamber.  Either exit can be taken by moving towards the
relevant door, indicated by name.

The panel of six keys can also be controlled from the keyboard by using
the following keys on the number pad:

                          +-----+-----+-----+
                          |  1  |  2  |  3  |
                          +-----+-----+-----+
                          |  4  |  5  |  6  |
                          +-----+-----+-----+

3. LANDER
The lander has two stages.  Landing on the moon, and returning to the
ship.  Both stages are essentially the same, except for the direction of
travel.  On landing the shuttle must be vertical, nose to the top of the
screen and must have a low velocity.  On return, the shuttle must reach
the target crosshair which will appear on the screen.

The keys are:
   Z        ROTATE LEFT
   X        ROTATE RIGHT
   SHIFT    THRUST
   P        PAUSE
   ESC      BYPASS THE LANDER GAME

4. REPEL BOARDERS
A simple shoot-em-up requiring only the faithful blaster.  Blaster
charge is shown at the bottom in bar form and will be the same as it is
the game, as in the alien interactive.  Along the top of the screen is a
damage bar.  jonah can sustain a number of hits before death.  In order
to repel the boarders all pirates must be killed.  The mouse is used to
move the crosshairs round the screen.  You have a limit of sixty shots,
but that is more than enough to kill all the pirates.  Pressing the
right mouse button will kill all pirates currently on screen, but will
cost you five of your sixty shots.

5. AUTO DESTRUCT
Mouse Operated.  Simply enter the auto-destruct code discovered in the
game.  Click on the numbers to enter them, 'DEL' to delete them, and the
arrow to enter the code.  'Exit' will exit the game.
