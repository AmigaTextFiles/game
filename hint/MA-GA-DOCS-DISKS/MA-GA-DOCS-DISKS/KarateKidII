Karate Kid II Instructions

	Karate Kid II requires a minimum hardware configuratin of an Atari
520ST or 1040ST computer with one Atari 3.5 in. single or double-sided disk
drive plus a colour monitor or TV and one joystick.

Loading

	Place your disk in drive A then turn on your computer. The program will
auto-boot and start a demonstration. Press the number 1 key to start a 1-player
game, or the number 2 key for a 2-player game. Leave your disk in drive A, it
will need to be accessed for some of the later screens. If you have a midi
keyboard, connect it to the midi-out socket of your computer.  The soundtrack
is designed to be played through a Casio CZ101 (or compatible) keyboard as well
as the T.V. or Monitor loudspeaker. For other keyboard, set channels 1-4 to
vibraphone, synth strings, bass and brass - or similar instruments.

Playing the Game

	1-PLAYER GAME. In the main fighting screens, you control Daniel, the
figure in white, with a joystick in port1 (th non-mouse port).  To defeat each
enemy you must reduce his strength to zero by scoring hits on any part of his
body. Some attacks are more effective than others - and usually more difficult
to execute. You will progress from enemy to enemy, each one more skilful, until
you lose to one of them. Your game is then over.
	Your choice of moves when facing to the right are as shown on the
center pages.
	When facing to the left, the controls are reversed left to right so
that, for example, pressing the fire button while walking forward will always
result in a forward kick, etc. These controls have been chosen for ease of use
and the best feel.  While there may seem to be rather a lot to learn, after a
few games, they will become automatic and you will be able to make your
character do what you want him to without even thinking about the joystick.
	On the bonus screens, you cannot die but you can gain valuable bonus
points for success. On the fly-catching screen, move Miyagi's arm with the
joystick and snap the chopsticks with the fire button. Here you gain bonus
points according to how long it takes you to catch the fly. This can be fairly
difficult, but have patience, remember it took Miyagi himself more than 40
years to catch his first fly!  On the ice-breaking screen, change the posistion
of your joystick as fast as possible to increase your energy (reflected by the
speed of the drum), then press your fire button to swing Daniel's arm. Release
the button just as Daniel's hand hits the first sheet of ice to gain maximum
follow-through. Bonus points are awarded according to how many sheets of ice
you break.
	When you finally meet Chozen in the Castle of King Shohashi, fight him
just as the other enemies until you have reduced his strength. At this point,
the drum will appear at the top-right of the screen. Then, just as Daniel had
to, you must learn the secret of the drum, or die!

2-PLAYER GAME
	This option is played as for a 1-player game but with a few
differences. Daniel's enemy is controlled with a joystick in port 0 (the mouse
port). The bonus screens are played by both players, in turn. The winner (not
necessarily the highest scorer) is the first to win three bouts. The Castle of
King Shohashi screen is not played in a 2-player game.
