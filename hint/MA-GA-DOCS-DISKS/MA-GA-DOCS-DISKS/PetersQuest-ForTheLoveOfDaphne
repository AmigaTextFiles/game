**********************    CHAPTER 1 - THE STORY    **************************

   One day, Peter and his girlfriend Daphne went out walking in a nearby
park.  Suddenly, the evil Brutus approached them, knocked Peter out cold,
and stole away with Daphne.  When Peter awoke, he found himself alone in
the park, but he soon discovered a trail of hearts left for him by his
beloved Daphne.  In the distance, he heard Daphne call his name, and his
heart filled with determination to rescue the fair hand of his Daphne back
from the evil clutches of the bully Brutus.

   And so, Peter set out upon his quest to win back his beloved Daphne.
Can you aid Peter in his valiant quest?  Without your assistance, Daphne
will be forever trapped with the evil Brutus...


*********************     CHAPTER 2 - THE GAME     **************************

   The concept behind "Peter's Quest: For the Love of Daphne" is simple.
Your quest is set in a world composed of 20 levels, riddled with porcupines
and movers.  Collect all the hearts on each level and you will continue on
to the next level.  There are 19 levels in all, each harder than the previous
level.  On level 20, you will battle the evil brute Brutus to win back the
fair hand of Daphne.  Defeat Brutus, and you will have won the game and
reclaimed your lost love.

   Daphne is held captive in a cell and guarded by the evil Brutus.  To free
Daphne, you must find the key which is hidden on one of the 20 levels.  Only
this key will unlock Daphne's cell and free her forever!  After you obtain
the key, the status line at the top of the game screen will turn green to
indicate that you are carrying the key.

   To help you in your journey, you may encounter coins, magic mushrooms,
warps, and disappearing blocks.  Each of these special items are hidden
inside one of the many blocks scattered throughout the 20 levels.  Finding
most of these items will greatly aid you in your quest.  But watch out for
the disappearing blocks; eliminating them can hinder your progress and
possibly make solving that level impossible!  Warps are especially
useful for passing levels, but watch out!  Some warps will take you
back to previous levels!

   You must complete each level within 100 seconds. Fail to complete a level
in the allotted amount of time and you will lose one of your lives.  When you
lose all of your lives, the game and your quest are over.  You will have
failed to help Peter reclaim the hand of Daphne.  She is trapped forever!

   You may continue your game once from the level on which you were.  Your
score and your coin amount will be reset to zero.  But you will retain the
key if you had already found it; you will not have to retrace your steps to
reclaim the key!

   New in version 1.2 is the ability to purchase options with the coins that
you find in your journey.  After completing a level, an options screen will
appear that will let you buy options to make your journey easier or just
plain more fun!
 
*********************    CHAPTER 3 - THE CONTROLS    ***********************

   Peter is controlled via a standard Amiga-compatible joystick plugged into
port #2.  This enables you to multi-task the game (although this is not very
useful on a 512k Amiga because Peter's Quest uses about 400k of memory!).

   Once the main menu appears, use the mouse or joystick to selection
options.  Two players can play the game; they simply alternate turns
using the same joystick.  Setting the difficulty simple selects the number
of men that you begin the game with:  5 men for easy mode, 3 men for medium
mode, and 2 men for hard mode (also, in hard mode, options can not be bought
after completing a level -- you will simply be given a free man for every 10
coins you collect).  Select "Begin Quest" to start the game or "Exit" to
quit the program and return to Workbench/CLI.

   While playing, use the joystick to manuever Peter.  Press the joystick
down by itself to make Peter duck and to search for hidden items in the
blocks.  Press the fire button alone or when running to jump in the current
direction.  Press the fire button and press the joystick down at the same
time to make Peter fall.  This will enable him to get items from blocks or
hearts that are below him.  On level 20, push the joystick up to fire a heart
at Brutus.

   When you purchase the rocket pack, press and hold the fire button to
activate the rocket pack.  Release the fire button to turn it off.  You
can steer yourself by moving the joystick up, down, left, and right.  Note:
You are not able to jump when you have the rocket pack.

   There are a few keys that are active while playing.  Pressing 'P' will
pause the game and pressing 'P' again when paused will restart the game.
Pressing 'S' will toggle the sound on or off, while pressing 'M' while turn
the music on and off.  Press 'DEL' to kill your current man and press the
'ESC' key to kill off all of your remaining Peters.  Remember to only press
each key once, since multiple strikes of a key will be buffered and then
processed.  This may cause problems, such as multiple terminated men.

   When you finish the game or run out of men, you will be prompted to enter
your initials, if you have set a new high score.  All of the alphabet and
number keys are accepted, plus various other keys.  Pressing the backspace
key will erase the previous character.  Only three characters are allowed for
input.  Press the RETURN key to end your input.  The high score list will
be displayed and your high score will be highlited in blue.  If you have
completed the game and saved Daphne, a "Peter" will appear next to your high
score to show that you have indeed finished the quest.

************************    CHAPTER 4 - SCORING    **************************

   F.  Hitting Brutus with heart                       100 points
   G.  Killing Brutus                                  500 points

**********************    CHAPTER 5 - THE PROGRAM    ************************

   Peter's Quest can be started either from the CLI or from Workbench.  From
the CLI, simply type "game" and press RETURN.  From the Workbench, open the
Peter's Quest disk icon and then double click on the game icon.

   Make sure that you set the Workbench to operate in 80 column mode.  Text
will be misalligned if Preferences is set to 60 column modes.

   The following files should be on the Peter's Quest disk.  The program may
not work without all of the files!

************************    CHAPTER 6 - CREDITS    *************************

  I would just like to take this opportunity to thank the following people
for all the help they gave me during the development of this program:

   Teijo Kinnunen -
      for composing Peter's song (I love it!) and the code needed to play
      the songs, plus the new code for playing the sounds (plus having so
      much patience and helping me get the code just right!  Thanks so much!)
      He's also the author of MED, a great music editor (and it's
      shareware!).  If you don't have a copy, get one!  Version 3.00 is
      available on Fred Fish Disk #483.

   Bits 'N Bytes Amiga Computer Store, Fairfield, California -
      for providing the digitizing equipment used to record the voices

   Kang Su Gatlin -
      for his testing, suggestions, and time

   Young and Sunny Oh -
      for providing the voices of Daphne

   Albert Penello -
      for drawing the squatted Peter and providing suggestions

   And everyone else who tested and played this game.

   Without their assistance, this program would never have been completed!
Thank you!
