SUPERFROG.. ALMOST A FAIRY TALE

   Hi there and a warm welcome to magic land.. former home of the magic
Prince and his lovely bride to be.  All was peace and harmony until the
wicked witch lived up to those fabled danish fairly-tales and predictably
turned the poor old Prince into nothing more than a little green frog..
But.. it was only a matter of a few hours beside the river-bank (being
Prince's far-less-stately new home) when a strange bottle floated past..
intriguied, he grabbed it and drank from the bottle and the rest is history
or at least it will be sooner or later.

COMPATIBILITY AND OTHER NOTES

   Superfrog has been trested on an extensive variety of AMIGA machines
and works on all varieties, from the A500 to the A4000 including the
CDTV/1200.  Should you experience any difficulties then it is probably
the case of corrupt or faulty disks, in any case please refer to the
Troubleshooting guide.  If you have external drives connected, you may
use those during play.
   Superfrog is NOT harddrive installable.. the disks that Superfrog
are supplied on are not the usual AmigaDOS format and writing to them
will most likely result in damage, so ALWAYS keep them write-protected.

RECCOMENDATIONS

   Superfrog is controlled from the joystick in port 2, the gameport
next to the one where the mouse is usually located.  Turn any auto-fire
off before play as the game will not function correctly with auto-fire
enabled.
   Hooking your Amiga's sound output through an amplifier or your HIFI
will result in even further enjoyment of the excellent music during
the game.
   Your Superfrog disks carry on-disk protection and cannot be backed
up.  So long as you treat them with care and keep them write-protected
they will give you trouble-free operation.  Keep them away from strong
magnetic sources such as the top of TV's/Monitors and Speakers.. if
your disks do become faulty by spilling coffee or whatever else on them
then please refer to the returns guide.

LOADING INSTRUCTIONS

   Turn your Amiga OFF at the power-supply and wait 10 seconds.. turn it
back on and continue the instructions as laid out below - this ensures
your system is clear of all data.
   When the usual insert-disk prompt appears you can insert either the
Story-Disk or Game-Disk 1.
   Inserting Game-Disk 1 will load the game straight away, missing out
the introductory animation.
   If, after a short while, nothing has appeared on screen or the insert
disk prompt still remains then repeat the instructions once more and
consult the Troubleshooting guide for further help and information.

MAIN MENU

   When the game has loaded and the Superfrog character is on screen,
pressing your button will reveal two selections; Start Game & options.

GAME OPTIONS

   You can move through the various selections with the joystick, using
fire to toggle the various options.  When you are satisfied you can 
return to main menu and start the game.

LIVES

   Selectable between 1, 3 or 5 [Default is 3]

SKILL LEVEL

   Easy or Normal.  Easy gives you a slightly slower type of control,
more game-time etc.  [Default is Normal]

SAVE HIGH SCORES

   You can save your high scores to a data-disk to keep a permanent
record of your achievement.  You should NOT use your Superfrog disks
for this purpose.

LEVEL CODES

   During the game you will be given codes to restart at various levels
these can be typed in here.

START GAME

   If you have one of the LEVEL-CODES as described earlier, you may jump
into the game at a later level, so there's no need to cover old ground 
(unless you feel that you need the practise or a big score!) otherwise
you start at the beginning, in the magic-woods as Superfrog sets off in
his quest to vanquish his froggy curse, get back his girl and teach that
old witch a lesson or two!

GAME PLAY

   The game is divided into worlds, of which there are six major ones, 
in each world there are a number of levels and you must complete all 
levels in order to advance through that world and onto the next.

MONEY MAKES THE WORLD GO AROUND

   To complete a level you must collect a certain number of coins, which
acts as a toll fee (even in magic-worlds, bills must be paid, appearance
fee's met and so on..) - this is shown on the large coin in the bottom
right hand corner of the screen.  When all the coins have been collected
the exit will be open and you can progress further.

THE TIME ELEMENT & BONUS AWARDS

   You will also notice that when you start, a timer begins to countdown
this represents the time you have left before your super-powers run out
and you turn into a normal frog once more.. which in effect means that
the game is over.  To counter this effect means that the game is over.
to counter this effect, Superfrog must find and drink bottles of
lucozade scattered about, but as you progress it becomes increasingly
rare and this means that you have to move quicker and be more thoughtful
in your approach.
   Collecting Fruit gives you points and also counts towards the super 
bonus award at the conclusion of each of the game levels.  You are awarded
credits for the amount of time left (increased by collecting more 
Lucozade), the number of fruit collected and also the number of coins 
collected (including all the hidden ones).  You are then given the chance
to change these credits into points, or gamble them on the bonus game.

SPECIAL ITEMS

   You will also find a number of special powers scattered around for
your use, these are detailed below;

WINGS

   Enables you to fly by quickly pressing your button when in the air, 
this helps perform greater leaps.  You cannot stay airborne forever though 
and sooner or later you'll drop back down to earth.

DESTRUCTO-SPUD

   This little green blob does your dirty work, you can throw him at
airborne enemies and knock them to the ground.  To fire spud, hold down 
your joystick button when you are stood still (it will not work in the
air).  You can also fire Spud upwards and to the side by pressing the
revelant direction whilst holding fire down.

INVISIBILITY PILL

   This little red pill renders our hero invisible to his enemies for
a short term, which obviously has it's advantages.

SPEED PILL

   These come in town forms, SPEEDUP (Green) and SLOWDOWN (Red) and are
obvious as to what they do.  Speed pills are usually placed in a position
where speed is either necessary or useful and not in a places where going
fast would be a hindrance, such as a particularly tricky jumping section.

LUCOZADE

   This prolongs your super-energy and also acts to boost your bonus
award at the end of each level.  The more Lucozade you get, the more time
you will have, the better score you will achieve.  It pays to find those
golden bottles!

RESTART PILL

   This red pill with a large "R" on it enables you to re-start at this
point should you lose a life.  On the early worlds, these pills are
pretty frequent, enabling you to get further into the game more quickly.

OTHER ITEMS
  
   other special items, such as jewels, crowns and so on, can be found in
particular worlds and levels.  These add greatly to your score and are 
well worth seeking.  You are awarded an extra frog every 200,000 points.

CONTROLLING SUPERFROG

   The controls have been made as simple as possible, allowing precision
and comfort on the joystick.
   Pushing left/right will move the frog left/right.  Pushing up will
make Superfrog jump, pushing up and keeping the joystick up will make
him jump a little higher.
   Pressing the fire-button has no effect unless he has collected a
special item such as Wings or he is carrying his friend Spud.
   When in flight you can move Superfrog right/left and manouvre him
over dangerous obstacles and enemies.  If you the joystick in the 
opposite direction, he will drop straight down, allowing you to control
where he will land/drop.
   You can attack various enemies from the air, such as the snails and
blue blobs on world one.. this will "splat" them and enables you to
clear the world and collect a fruit bonus in the process.  Some enemies
the bird and hedgehog in world one for example, cannot be destroyed
and it is for you to descover which in other words.. the best way to
find out is to get an invisibility pill and try jumping on the enemies
such as the bats and wasps can be jumped on or blasted by SPUD.
   it's common sense to avoid things like fire, spikes and so on.. frogs
even super-ones are generally soft, gooey creatures that do not enjoy 
such contact.

LEVEL ONE HINTS

   To get you started, you should note that level 1 has two hidden
sections and that the Blobs, Snails and Wasps can be squashed by jumping 
on them.

BONUS GAME - FRUIT MACHINE

   After the super-award at the end of each level, you are gievn credits 
which you can turn into points, or use on the Fruit Machine.  In the Fruit 
Machine you can try and win level codes, extra lives and massive point 
advances (all numbers shown mean thousands of points).  Playing the 
machine is simple enough and can be done with either the joystick or
mouse.
   In general, whenever something is lit on the far right, you have won
that amount (in thousands) and you can either COLLECT it, or opt to
GAMBLE IT, where the outcome could be either of the other two flashing 
squares above and below it.  The HI-LO feature enables you to gamble on 
the spin of a number (1-10) and progress through the features on the right 
side.
   The jackpot (gained by gambling, through the HI-LO feature or by
getting three lucozade cans) rewards you with points for remaining credits
a hefty score bonus and the code to start at the next level whenever you
play again!

GAME OVER

   After each contact with an enemy, you lose one unit of energy.  When
you lose five units of energy, a life is lost.
   The game ends when your supply of lives is spent or you run out of
super-energy time (which shouldn't happen as there is plenty of Lucozade
on each level to enable it to be completed comfortably).
