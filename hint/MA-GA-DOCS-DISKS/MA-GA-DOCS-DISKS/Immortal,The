         DOX TO THE GAME `IMMORTAL` TYPED IN BY SCOOTER-SCOOPEX
         ------------------------------------------------------
                      GENERATIONS AHEAD!!!!


THE MORNING SUN HEATS THE JAGGED PEAKS AS YOU FOLLOW THE FORGOTTEN ROAD DOWN TO
THE VALLEY FLOOR. THE BLEACHED RUINS OF GREAT COLUMNED TEMPLES AND TOWERING
CITADELS RISE FROM THE GRASSY PLAIN LIKE BONES OF SOME COLOSSAL BEAST. THIS WAS
THE ANCIENT CITY OF `ERINOCH` DESTROYED BY THE DRAGONS FIRE OVER A 1000 YEARS
AGO. `MORDAMIR` SPOKE OFTEN OF THIS CITY AND THE LABYRINTH BELOW....

`MORDAMIR` YOU THINK BACK TO THE DAYS WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG AND EAGER TO LEARN
THE SPELLS OF SORCERY. THE OLD WIZARD `MORDAMIR` TOOK YOU IN AND PAIENTLY
TAUGHT YOU THE ARTS OF MAGIC. HE TAUGHT YOU HOW TO READ THE RUNES AND UNLEASH
THEIR POWER. THE POWER OF CHARMS AND FIRE. HE SHOWED YOU THE STRENGTH OF STEEL
AND TAUGHT YOU TO USE YOUR WIZARDS CUNNING, `MORDAMIR` WAS YOUR MASTER, YOUR
MENTOR HE WAS YOUR GUIDE DOWN THE TREACHEROUS PATH OF WIZARDRY. HE WAS YOUR
FRIEND.

MANY YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE YOU LAST SAW THE OLD MAN, YOU ASSUMED HE WAS
DEAD--THAT IS UNTIL A FEW NIGHTS AGO WHEN HE CALLED YOU IN A DREAM. YOU WOKE
WITH AN UNEASY FEELING THAT `MORDAMIR` STILL LIVED--TRAPPED IN A BOTTOMLESS
CAVERN. AND SO YOU SET OUT TO UNRAVEL THE SECRETS OF THE IMMORTAL.

KEY COMMANDS:

MUSIC    --- ON/OFF   -----   PRESS CTRL-S
RESTART  --- TO RESTART A GAME OR LEVEL, PRESS CTRL-R
QUITTING --- REMOVE DISK FROM DRIVE. TURN OFF COMPUTER (REALLY?)

GAME CONTROLS:

YOIU BEGIN IN THE ANTECHAMBER THAT LEADS TO LEVEL1...VITALITY IS LIFE..RUN OUT
OF IT AND YER DEAD..YOU LOSE VITALITY WHEN YOU MONSTERS INFLICT DAMAGE ON YOU,
AND HAVE TO RESTART THE LEVEL OVER(SEE RESTART ABOVE)

USE OF JOYSTICK TO MOVE..THIS IS THE USUAL..IE (IN DIRECTIONAL AGAIN)...TO MOVE
TO THE LEFT JOYSTICK LEFT..UP MOVES YOU UP..DOWN MOVES YOU DOWN(DEAD EASY AINT
IT)..

COMBAT:

WHEN A MONSTER ATTACKS YOU, YOU MUST FIGHT TO THE DEATH. THE BEST STRATEGY IS
TO PARRY WHEN YOUR OPPONENT IS ABOUT TO STRIKE. AND ATTACK WHEN HE`S LEAVING
HIMSELF OPEN.

ATTACKING (PUSH FORWARD TO JAB)
SLASH     (PULL BACK, THEN PUSH FORWARD)
PARRYING  (MOVE JOYSTICK RIGHT AND LEFT) IF THE WIZARD IS FACING YOU, MOVEMENTS
          ARE REVERSED.
FIGHTING WHEN THE WIZARD IS FACING YOU MAY BE TRICKY AT FIRST, ITS EASY THOUGH
IF YOU REMEMBER TO ALWAYS MOVE THE JOYSTICK IN THE DIRECTION YOU WANT THE
WIZARD TO LEAN.
LEAN AWAY FROM THE MONSTERS SWING TO PARRY HIS BLOW..YOUR OPPONENT HAS TO PULL
BACK BEFORE HE CAN SWING. WHEN YOU SEE HIM PULL BACK, LEAN IN THE DIRECTION HIS
SWING WILL TRAVEL.

USING ITEMS IN YOUR PACK:

YOU CARRY A PACK WHERE YOU KEEP THE VALUABLE ITEMS YOU FIND. TO LOOK AT THE
ITEMS IN YOUR PACK, PRESS `SPACEBAR` TO USE AN ITEM IN YOUR PACK, MOVE THE
CURSOR TO THE ITEM AND PRESS FIRE. TO VIEW OTHER ITEMS IN YOUR PACK HIGHLIGHT
`Other` AND PRESS FIRE.

TO GO BACK TO THE ACTION, MOVE THE CURSOR TO A `Black Suare` AND PRESS FIRE,
YOU CAN ALSO SELECT YOUR GOLD OR KEY TO GO BACK TO ACTION(DONT WORRY YOU CAN`T
DROP GOLD OR KEYS)

MOST ITEMS ARE ACTIVATED SIMPLY BY SELECTING THEM. A FEW, HOWEVER REUIRE
ADDITIONAL COMMANDS:

BLINK SPELL ---  ONCE YOU HAVE SELECTED THE BLINK SPELL. PRESS FIRE TO BLINK.

                 FORM.

DONT DROP ITEMS YOU`LL NEED LATER:

SOMETIMES USING AN ITEM CONSISTS OF SETTING IT DOWN ON THE GROUND - FOR
EXAMPLE, YOU USE A GEM BY SETTING IT DOWN. BE CAREFUL!. IF YOU SET AN ITEM DOWN
IN THE WRONG PLACE, MAKE SURE YOU PICK IT UP AGAIN BEFORE YOU LEAVE OR YOU WONT
FIND IT IN YOUR PACK.

NOTE ON USING ITEMS:

EACH KIND OF ITEM HAS A SPECIFIC USE - SPORES CAN ONLY BE PLANTED IN DIRT,
WHILE THE TROLL RITUAL KNIFE CAN ONLY BE THROWN. YOU CAN`T CONTROL HOW AN ITEM
IS USED, JUST WHEN AND WERE. MOST ITEMS ARE USEFUL ONLY IN A PARTICULAR
PLACE..ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING PARTS OF THE GAME IS FIGURING OUT WHICH ITEM
THE SITUATION DEMANDS.

WHEN YOU FIRST GET AN ITEM, THERES NO WAY TO KNOW WHAT IT DOES UNTIL YOU TRY
IT. YOU CAN GUESS AN ITEMS GENERAL USE..YOU WEAR RINGS, YOU DRINK POTIONS..BUT
YOU CAN`T KNOW AN ITEMS MAGICAL PROPERTIES UNTIL YOU TRY IT.

PAUSING THE GAME:

IF YOU NEED TO PAUSE THE GAME..PRESS THE `SPACEBAR` TO BRING UP YOUR PACK..AND
WHEN YOUR READY TO GO BACK INTO ACTION..ITS THE `BLACK SQUARE`..KEYS OR GOLD.
THEN PRESS FIRE.

GETING OUT OF PIT TRAPS

THERE ARE DEADLY PIT TRAPS IN THE LABYRINTH...IF YOU`RE NOT CAREFUL YOU MAY
FIND YOURSELF HANGING BY YOUR STAFF OVER ROWS OF SHARP SPIKES. FORTUNATELY,
THERE`S ALWAYS A CHANCE OF SWINGING OUT BEFORE YOUR STAFF BREAKS.
TO SWING OUT GENTLY ROCK YOUR JOYSTICK BACK AND FORTH AT AN EVEN PACE.

INCREASING VITALITY BY SLEEPING:

PILES OF STRAW PROVIDE COMFORTABLE, SAFE PLACES TO REST AND REGAIN VITALITY, TO
SLEEP, MOVE ONTO THE STRAW AND JUST STAND THERE. AFTER A MOMENT, YOU`LL LIE
DOWN AND GO TO SLEEP...Pay Close Attention To Your Dreams!!!!!!!!!!!!!

MAKING THE TEXT SCROLL FASTER:

WHILE READING MESSAGES, YOU CAN HOLD DOWN THE `FIRE` TO MAKE THE TEXT SCROLL
FASTER..YOU CAN USE THIS TO SCROLL THROUGH MESSAGES YOU HAVE ALREADY READ, BUT
DONT USE IT TO AVOID READING MESSAGES ALTOGETHER..MOST MESSAGES CONTAION
IMPORTANT CLUES, YOU`LL NEED TO FINISH THE GAME.

CLIMBING UP AND DOWN LADDERS:

TO CLIMB UP OR DOWN A LADDER, MOVE UP TO IT AND YOU`LL AUTOMATICALLY CLIMB OR
DESCEND. BE CAREFUL GOING DOWN LADDERS..MOVE ONLY TO THE SIDE OF THE OPENING
WITH THE LADDER ON IT OR YOU`LL FALL TO YOUR DEATH.

COMPLETING A LEVEL IN THE LABYRINTH:

WHENEVER YOU COMPLETE A LEVEL, YOU GET A CERTIFICATE. WRITE DOWN YOUR
CERTIFICATES AND KEEP THEM IN A SAFE PLACE. IF YOU QUIT PLAYING THE IMMORTAL,
YOU`LL NEED THE CERTIFICATE LATER, SO YOU CAN START ON THE LEVEL IN WHICH YOU
LEFT OFF.

ONCE YOU HAVE WRITTEN THE CERTIFICATE NUMBER DOWN PRESS FIRE TO BEGIN THE NEXT
LEVEL. OR QUIT AND START THE LEVEL SOME OTHER TIME USING THE CERTIFICATE.

ONLY USEFUL ITEMS GO TO THE NEXT LEVEL:

LEVEL, THE MAGIC OF THE LABYRINTH WILL REMOVE ANY ITEMS YOU DONT NEED FROM YOUR
PACK.

                                 * GOTO THE PREVIOUS COMPLETED LEVEL
                                 * START A WHOLE NEW GAME

YOU CAN ALSO RESTART A LEVEL AT ANY TIME DURING THE GAME BY PRESSING CTRL-R

COPY PROTECTION:

OCCASIONALLY A PICTURE OF AN ITEM WILL APPEAR AND YOU`LL BE ASKED TO ENTER A
LETTER...LOOK FOR THE PICTURE IN THE MANUAL THAT MATCHES. FIND THE LETTER IN
THE TABLE BESIDE THE PICTURE, TYPE IT IN AND PRESS `RETURN`..(I HAVE LEFT THIS
IN--PLUS THE REQUESTED PASWOEDS..IN CASE EVEN IN THE CRACKED COPY..SOMETHING IS
MISSED...SCOOTER)

GUIDE TO LEVEL 1:THE CANDLE FLAME LEAPS AND HISES AS YOU ENTER THE SMALL
ANTECHAMBER THAT LEADS TO THE FIRST LEVEL OF THE DUNGEON, A SKULL STARES
VACANTLY AT THE DANCING SHADOWS ON THE WALL, A GRIM REMINDER THAT THIS IS "no
place for mortal men" 
AS YOU APPROACH THE TABLE, AN IMAGE OF MORDAMIR, YOUR LOST MASTER RISES EERIELY
FROM THE FLAME. IT SPEAKS...

MORDAMIR IS HERE, YOU WHISPER. YOU TURN TOWARD THE DOOR. `DUNRIC`...YOU THINK,
ANOTHER OF MORDAMIR`S STUDENTS, NO DOUBT. THE MASTER HAS TAUGHT MANY IN HIS
LIFE, THE THOUGHT THAT YOU ARE`NT THE ONLY ONE LOOKING FOR MORDAMIR COMFORTS
YOU...FOR A MOMENT.

"you`ll need to fight soon, so read the section on combat"

GOBLIN ATTACK:

THE SOUND OF CLASHING STEEL RINGS THROUGH THE AIR AS YOU ENTER THE LONG
CHAMBER. BEFORE YOU LIES AN ARMOURED FIGURE - A MAN - THE BLOOD FROM HIS WOUNDS
STILL COOLING BETWEEN THE TILES OF THE STONE FLOOR.

TO THE RIGHT YOU HEAR A SNARL. FROM ACROSS THE ROOM A GIANT GOBLIN LUMBERS
TOWARD YOU, HIS MUSCLES RIPPLING AS HE RAISES HIS MACE OVER HOS HEAD. YOU RAISE
YOUR SWORD..READYING YOURSELF.

DUNRIC`S SERVANT:

WHO WAS THIS UNFORTUNATE YOU WONDER?..YOU SEARCH HIS BODY AND FIND A SMALL BAG
CONTAINING A RING, AND A SCROLL..INSCRIBED ON THE RING IS A NAME "DUNRIC"

A FIGHTER WOULDNT HAVE NEED FOR A SCROLL OR A RING, YOU THINK, THIS CAN`T BE
DUNRIC..PERHAPS A SERVANT?..THE SOUND OF RENEWED BATTLE BATTLE SHAKES YOU FROM
YOUR THOUGHTS, SOMEONE ELSE IS IN TROUBLE..YOU MUTTER PICKING UP YOUR STAFF.

' you can search for items just by moving to the area you want to search. if
there is anything of interest in the area, a message appears telling you what
it is"

FIRE AT YOUR FINGERS:

YOU GLANCE DOWN AT THE LEATHERY PARCHMENT SCROLL YOU`RE CLUTCHING AND REAlIZE
YOUR HOLDING A SPELL OF FIREBALLS, YOU STOP FOR A MOMENT. CLEARING YOUR MIND ,
YOU READ THE RUNES, SPEAKING THE ARCANE WORDS OUT LOUD, SLOWLY UBRAVELLING THE
COILED GLYMPHS AND WEAVING TOGETHER THE INCANTATION. A TINGLING POWER GATHERS
AT YOUR FINGERTIPS. YOU HOLD THE ELEMENT OF FIRE.

" press the SPACEBAR to look throgh your pack. Move the cursor to (3) shots and
press fire." WHEN YOUR READY TO CAST A FIREBALL. PRESS THE FIRE...

MORDAMIRS SERVANT:

AS YOU ROUND THE CORNER, THE FRENZIED MOVEMENT OF COMBAT IMMEDIATELY CATCHES
YOUR EYE, A HUGE GOBLIN HIS HANDS WRAPPED AROUND A WICKED MACE. SWINGS
FURIOUSLY AT AN EQUALLY POWERFUL HUMAN WARRIOR..THE MAN MANGES TO DEFLECT TWO
BLOWS BEFORE HE FALTERS AND FALLS BACK. ITS OBVIOUYS HE`S NEAR EXHAUSTION.

REELING ABOUT THE GOBLIN BARES HIS TEETH AND LEAPS TOWRDS YOU, "DONT INTERFERE"
HE SNARLS. YOU COULD FIGHT HIM, YOU THINK, BUT YOUR FINGERTIPS STILL ITCH WITH
THE ELEMENT OF FIRE..THE WORD OF POWER SLIDES EASILY OFF YOUR TONGUE....THE
FIREBALL EXPLODES ON THE GOBLIN AND HE FAALS TO THE FLOOR, YOU APPROACH THE
WARRIOR. YOU MUST FIND MORDAMIR..THE WARRIOR SAYS. HANDING YOU A KEY, HE
HURRIES OUT THE DOOR.

THE KEY YOU DISCOVER, OPENS A NEARBY CHEST. INSIDE YOU FIND A COLLECTION OF
STRANGE ITEMS:**GOLD**A POUCH FULL OF BAIT**A SACK OF SPORES**A BOTTLE CONTAING
WHAT LOOKS LIKE NORMAL WATER**AND A TATTERED MAP.

YOU PLACE ALL THE ITEMS YOU NEED IN YOUR PACK, :MAY NEED THEM LATER" YOU THINK.
SLINGING THE PACK OVER YOUR SHOULDER, YOU SLIP THROUGH THE UPPER DOOR.

THE LIEUTENANTS TREASURE:

YOU SHUT THE DOOR BEHIND YOU AND LOOK DOWN BOTH ENDS OF THE CORRIDOR, TO YOUR
RIGHT YOU DISCERN THE SHADOWY OUTLINE OF ANOTHER GOBLIN. THOUGH HE`S NOTICED
YOU, HE`S NOT MOVING TOWARDS YOU, YOU WHISPER, LIFTING YOUR HAND, AND THIS
ONE`S FOR YOU.

YOIU SEARCH THE LIEUTENANT AND FIND A NOTE, A KEY AND MORE GOLD. YOU HASTILY
OPEN THE NOTE. THE HAND WRITING, YOU NOTICE IN DISTINCTLY HUMAN. IT ALMOST
LOOKS FAMILIAR...."BEWARE OF SHADES" YOU READ, THEY ARE DANGEROUS, INVISIBLE
CREATURES THAT LIKE DARKNESS. BY FIRELIGHT THEY CAST A SHADOW BY WHICH YOU CAN
DETECT AND AVOID THEM.

YOU DROP THE NOTE AND STEP THROUGH THE DOOR.

STONE SKULLS LINE THE WALLS OF THE CHAMBER IN WHICH YOU FIND YOURSELF. YOUR
WIZARDS SENSE TELLS YOU THERE`S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THIS ROOM...BUT YOUR NOT
SURE WHAT. YOU`VE SEEN THIS ROOM BEFORE..OR A PICTURE OF IT, THAST IS...

YOU OPEN YOUR PACK AND PULL OUT A MUSTY TOME: THE CODEX OF THE SERPENT..(ITS
FURTHER ON IN THIS DOC)

SHADES IN THE SHADOWS:

YOU NARROWLY ESCAPE THE FLYING ARROWS WITH YOUR LIFE!. YOU SLAM SHUT THE DOOR
BEHIND YOU AND FALL AGAINST THE WALL, CATCHING YOUR BREATH. BUT THE ROOM YOU`RE
STANDING IN SEEMS DISTURBING TOO."MORE TRAPS" YOU CURSE.

YOU OPEN YOUR PACK AND TAKE OUT THE MAP YOU FOUND IN THE CHEST. THIS ROOM DOES
RESEMBLE ONE OF THE ROOMS TRACED ON THE PARCHMENT. YOU NOTICE SOME CONSPICUIOS
RED DOTS...THEY MUST MARK DANGER. THERE ARE RED DOTS MARKING TRAPS IN THE NEXT
ROOM TOO, THESE ARE SURELY THE HALLS OF HELL, SKIRTING THE UPPER LEFT WALL, YOU
MAKE YOUR WAY OVER TO THE DOOR.

THE DOOR OPENS INTO A DARK ROOM. YOU NOTICE THE TORCHES ALONG THE WALLS ARE
OUT, AND SUDDENLY REMEMBER THE WARNING ON THE NOTE -SHADES!-.

A FIRBALL COULD LIGHT A TORCH. MOVING ALONG THE WALL, YOU SHOOT YOUR LAST
FIREBALL. THE TORCH LIGHTS, AND JUST AHEAD YOU MAKE OUT THE SHADOWS OF 2
SHADES. ON THE FAR END OF THE ROOM YOU MAKE OUT SOME OBJECTS ON THE FLOOR.
MIDFUL OF THE TRAPS AND SHADES, YOU CROSS THE ROOM AND PICK UP A CURIOUS AMULET
AND A SPELL WITH WHICH YOU CAN CHARM WILL "O" THE WISPS..WITH YOUR EYE ON THE 2
SHADES, YOU CROSS DOWN TO THE DOOR. LOCKED!..FORTUNATELY YOU HAVE THE KEY...

BY THE LIGHT OF ETERNITY:

IN THE ROOM YOU FIND A DEEP,ABRUPT CAVERN IN THE DUGEON FLOOR. WHAT TERRIBLE
POWER, YOU IMAGINE, COULD BORE SUCH A HOLE THROUGH THE EARTH!. NO MAN CAN
PERFORM SUCH A FEAT! THIS IS THE WORK OF A COLOSSAL BEAST. AN ANGRY BEAST...

YOU NOTICE THE BEAM OF LIGHT PEAKING THROUGH THE DUNGEON WALL. THE SHAFT OF
LIGHT FALLS ON A DIAL INSCRIBED ON THE FLOOR. AT THE END OF THE DIAL, EMBEDDED
,ON THE FLOOR, IS A BRILLIANT JEWEL AS LARGE AS A MANS FIST. THE JEWEL AND THE
SHAFT OF LIGHT YOU IMAGINE, MAKE UP A SPECIAL MECHANISM OF SOME SORT.

YOUR CURIOUS ABOUT THE MECHANISM, BUT AT THE MOMENT YOU FEEL TO TIRED TO FIGURE
HOW IT WORKS, YOU CROSS OVER TO A COSY PILE OF STRAW, YOU NOTICED IN THE UPPER
PART OF THE ROOM. SLEEP OVERTAKES YOU QUICKLY, AND YOU DREAM.

WHEN YOU AWAKE YOU STUDY THE MECHANISM MORE CLOSELY. THE SUNLIGHT NEEDS TO
STRIKE THE JEWEL, THAT MUCH SEEMS OBVIOUS, EVERY YEAR THE BEAM OF LIGHT INCHES
CLOSERE TO THE JEWEL. WHAT?! AT THIS RATE THE SUN WONT STRIKE THE JEWEL FOR A
1000 YEARS!..YOU DONT HAVE THAT KIND OF TIME. WHAT MORTAL DOES!!

PERHAPS IF YOU COULD DEFLECT THE LIGHT?...YOU COULD FOOL THE MECHANISM......

                     THE CODEX OF THE SERPENT
                     ************************

LEVEL 1

I MORDAMIR, WIZARD OF THE CRIMSON KEEP. WROTE THESE NOTES FRO YOU, MY LOYAL
APPRENTICES AND STUDENTS, TO EXPLAIN THE MYSTERIES OF THIS DARK LABYRINTH.
TODAY I FORTH TO EXPLORE THE DRAGONS LAIR. I HOPE MY WITS ARE KEN ENOUGH TO
ESCAPE HER CUNNING AGAIN!...THUS I LEAVE THESE WORDS FOR THOSE WHO MAY HAVE TO
COME AFTER ME, MAY THEY KEEP YOU FROM AN UNTIMELY END IN THIS FORSAKEN PLACE!

DUNRIC---MY FAITHFULL STUDENT IN THE ART OF WIZARDRY--WILL BE THE FIRST TO COME
LOOKING FOR ME.HE`S OFTEN ACCOMPANIED BY EREK, A FIGHTER

ULINDOR--MY SERVANT AND BODYGUARD.

UPPER LEVELS--A TRIBE OF PRIMATIVE CREATURES KNOWN AS GOBLINS, HOSTILE TO
STRANGERS, BUT SEEM TO POSSESS REASON.INTELLIGENCE AND INGENUITY WITH TOOLS.

A SAFE PATH PAST THE ARROWS..I GOT THIS FAR BEFORE I SET OF THE TRAP..DANGER
PIT TRAPS..IN THE DARK ROOM THAT FOLLOWS ARE DEADLY CREATURES, INVISIBLE TO THE
EYE. ONLY THEIR SHADOWS CAN BE SEEN LIGHT. KEEP A TORCH LIT AND WATCH THEIR
MOVEMENTS CAREFULLY. THEY MOVE QUICKLY!..THERE ARE PIT TRAPS IN THIS ROOM AS
WELL

RIDDLE OF THE SUN:

DEEP IN THE OMMORTAL DRAGONS LAIR, ONCE IN ONE MILLENIUM, THE PORTAL OPENS TO
THE STAIR, WHEN A SINGLE GEM MEETS THE SUN. A MECHANISM TRIPPED EVERY THOUSAND
YEARS BY LIGHT.....SOMETHING SHINY


LEVEL 2

FROM A TEXT I FOUND ON THE HISTORY OF THIS EVIL PLACE.

AFTER 2 BITTER COMBAT, ARINAR THE ELVEN LORD ESCAPED THE ENEMY, BUT THROUGH HIS
VEINS RAN A FATAL POISON, DRAWN FROM THE KEEN EDGE OF THE SHADOWLORDS BLADE.
ARINAR FLED OVER THE HIGH MOUNTAINS TO THE RUINED CITY OF ERINOCH, WERE HE
ENTERED THE LABYRINTH IN SEARCH OF THE FABLED WATER, SAID BY MANY TO HEAL THE
DEEPEST OF WOUNDS.

DEEP IN THE CHILLY CAVERNS OF THE FORGOTTON LABYRINTH, THE ELVEN LORD SEARCHED
DESPERATELY FOR THE FOUNTAIN. SLAYING THE EVIL MINIONS THAT DWELL IN THAT DARK
PLACE WITH SOLONDUL. A GREAT SWORD OF MIGHT, BUT ON THE SECOND DAY, FOUL SLIME
CREATURES CAUGHT ARINAR OFF GUARD AND STRIPPED THE FLESH FROM HIS BODY. TO THIS
DAY HIS BONES AND SWORD LAY THERE STILL....

LEGENDS HAVE TOLD OF WAYFARERS BEING ATTACKED BY WILL O WISPS, I RECKONED SUCJH
STORIES WERE THE PRODUCTS OF CHILDISH IMAGINATIONS, BUT NOW I HAVE SEEN THESE
HATEFUL CREATURES WITH MY OWN EYES, I KNOW LITTLE OF THEIR NATURE...ARE THEY
INTELLIGENT?..PERHAPS THEY ARE DISEMBODIED SPIRITS OF SOME SORT, OR MAYBE
CREATURES OF THE ELEMENTS, IN ANY CASE, THEY ARE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS---THEY
DESPISE THE LIVING AND EAGERLY ATTACK MORTAL FLESH.

MAYBE I CAN DEVISE A SPELL TO BRING THEM UNDER CONTROL....


SPORES--THE GOBLINS SOMETIMES USE THEM AS A KIND OF WEAPON, WHEN PLANTED IN
SOFT DIRT, THESE SPORES PRODUCE MUSHROOMS THAT GROW TO WAIST HEIGHT IN A MATTER
OF SECONDS. THE FULL GROWN MUSHROOMS IMMEDIATELY FIRE MORE SPORES IN A RADIUS
OF 30 FEET. THE SPORES, IT MUST BE ADDED ARE DEADLY TO HUMANS,GOBLINS AND
TROLLS. THE GOBLINS TYPICALLY CARRY THEM IN SACKS AROUND THEIR NECKS TO PROTECT
THEMSELVES.

THEY CAN BE REGONISED BY THEIR STRONG,SICKENING SMELL.

YEARS AGO, WHEN SORCERERS TOWERS STRETCHED TOWARDS THE HEAVENS AND THE HALLS OF
WIZARDRY PROTECTED THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SPHERES, THE CITY OF ERINOCH HAD NEED
OF LOCKSMITHS, THE MOST CUNNING LOCKSMITH I RECALL WAS A DWARF BY THE NAME OF
LINDLI. HIS LOCKS NEVER INVOLVED ANYTHING AS BORING AS A SIMPLE LOCK AND KEY.
LINDLS MECHANISMS REUIRED THE UNUSUAL--FINELY CRAFTED GEMS, BEAMS OF LIGHT,
PACES AROUND AN OBJECT...

LINDL PROSPERED WHILE SERVING THE WIZARDS OF ERINOCH. BUT WHEN THE DRAGON CAME
OVER 1000 YEARS AGO, HIS HOUSE WAS DESTOYED AND HIS FAMILY PERISHED IN THE
FLAMES. LINDL WENT QUITE MAD AFTER SEEING THE BEAST DEVASTATE HIS DREAMS, AND
HE CURSED THE WIZARDS WHO UNLEASHED THE DRAGONS WRATH. HE VOWED TO SEAL OF THE
LABYRINTH FOREVER..SO THAT MEN COULD NO LONGER SEEK THE WATER.

THE MAGIC DUST CAN BE THROWN TO MAKE AN IRRITABLE OLD FOOL, YOU FRIEND.

THE GEMS MUST BE DROPPED IN THE HOLES. GRESH AND WISE, KING OF THE GOBLINS,
KNOWS THE COMBINATION. ONE MUST DEFEAT HIM BEFORE HE`LL SPEAK.

LEVEL 3

ONLY THE FIERCE MIGHT OF AN ANGRY DRAGON COULD SPLIT THE EARTH AND FORM THIS
GREAT CHASM. THE CRCACK CANNOT BE CROSSED BY ROPE--THE BRISK WINDS RISING FROM
THE DRAGONS LAIR MAKE IT TO DANGEROUS!. THE ONLY WAY ACROSS IS A MAGIC GATE--A
TELEPORT MECHANISM--HIDDEN IN ONE OF THE ROOMS BELOW. THE SHAFT OF LIGHT ON THE
OTHER SIDE IS WERE THE MAGIC GATE LEADS.

TROLLS--THE SHINDRAK, AS THEY CALL THEMSELVES, RULE MUCH OF THE LOWER LEVELS.
FOR THE MOST PART. THEY ARE STUPID AND QUICK TEMEPERED--SOMETHING TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF.

A TROLL WILL THROW HIS RITUAL KNIFE ONLY WHEN HE WANTS TO CHALLENGE ANOTHER
TROLL TO COMBAT.

PROTEUS, A GOD OF THE SEA WAS A SHAPE-CHANGER WHO COULD TRAVEL DISGUUISED AS
IRE AND WILD BOARS. THIS RING WAS FORGED BY PROTEUS WHEN EARTH WAS YOUNG. IT
ALLOWS THE WEARER TO TAKE THE FORM OF A GOBLIN, BEWARE SOME ARE TO WISE TO
BELIEVE ITS CHARMS.

TROLL BOMB. ONE WIFF OF THESE DEVICES AND TROLLS ARE PARALYZED.

RED GEMS LOOK BEST IN PURPLE LIGHT.

LEVEL 4:

WHEN DUNRIC INTERFERED WITH THE TROLLS BATTLE AGAINST THE GOBLINS, THEY
KIDNAPPED HIS DAUGHTER, ANA. AND DRAGGED HER INTO THE LABYRINTH. AS SHE
POSSESSES SOME OF HER FATHERS SKILL IN SORCERY, SHE HAD NO TROUBLE ESCASPING
THE TROLLS, BUT ON HER WAY OUT, SHE LOST A SPECIAL RING GIVEN TO HER BY HER
FATHER.

SOME RINGS ARE NEVER WORN ON THE BODY.

LEVEL 5:

THE POTION TRANSFORMS AND POISONS YOU AT THE SAME TIME. YOU WIL BENEFIT FROM
ITS POWER TO SHRINK YOU. BUT YOU MUST FIND WATER AND DRINK SOON AFTERWARDS OR
YOU`LL NEVER LIVE PAST THE HOUR.

MANY MICE BUT FEWER MICE CAN PASS THROUGH A CRACK IN THE WALL. THIS IS THE ONLY
WAY OUT AT THIS LEVEL.WORM SENSOR--THE FASTER IT CHIMES, THE GREATER YOUR
DANGER.

THE WEIGHT OF ONE WILL OPEN THE WAY, SET DOWN THE FOOD AND A FLYING LIZARD
COULD HOLD THE DOOR.

LEVEL 6:

WHEN SHE REARS UP, SHES READY TO WEB. MOVE BACK!

SHE`S MOST VULNERABLE WHEN ALL FOUR LEGS ARE ON THE GROUND.

NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO IMBIBE THE SPIRITS.

LEVEL 7

THE GOBLINS CRAVE THE WATER AS MUCH AS MEN, BUT HORRID WATER CREATURE GUARDS
THE WAY! IF THE WATER MONSTER WERE DISTRACTED LONG ENOUGH. THE GOBLINS COULD
OPEN A GATE AND THE CREATURE WOULD BE WASHED AWAY INTO THE DEEPEST UNDERGROUND
SEA. ONLY A WIZARD, ADEPT AT SAILING, STANDS A CHANCE OF DISTRACTING THE
MONSTER AND MAKING HIS ESCAPE.

THIS IS THE FINAL STEP BEFORE ENTERING THE DRAGONS LAIR...DO WHATEVER YOU MUST
TO HELP THE GOBLINS OPEN THE WAY. YOU JOURNEY IS ALMOST COMPLETE---IF FORTUNE
FINDS US, WE WILL STAND TOGETHER AGAINST THE DRAGON!!!!!

                               Docs For Immortal

                             Typed  by Xanadu/TSL.  

The morning sun heats the jagged peaks as you follow the forgotten road down
to the valley floor. The bleached ruins of great columned temples and towering
citadels rise from the grassy plain like the bones of some colossal beast.
This was the ancient city of Erinoch, destroyed by the dragons fire over 1000
years ago. Mordamir spoke often of this city and the Labyrinth below.....

Mordamir. You think back to the days when you were young and eager to learn
the spells of sorrcery. The old wizzard Mordamir took you in and patiently
taught you the arts of magic. he taught you how to read the runes and unleash
their power. the power of charms and fire. He showed you the strength of steel
and taught you how to use your wizards cunning. Mordamir was your master, your
mentor. He was your guard down the treacherous path of wizardry. He was your
friend.

Many Years have passed sine you last saw the old man. You assumed he was dead
- that is until a few nights ago, when he came to you in a dream. You woke
with the uneasy feeling that Mordamir still lived - trapped in a bottomless
cavern. And so you set out to unravel the secrets of the Immortal.

COMBAT

When a monster attacks you must fight to the death. The best strategy is to
parry when your opponet is about to strike, and attack when he's leaving
himself open.

ATTACKING JAB   push forward
SLASH           pull back then push forward
PARRYING        to parry move the stick left & right. Remember if the wizard
                facing you, the movements are reversed.

Lean away from the monsters swing to parry his blow. Your opponent has to pull
back his weapon before he can swing. When you see him pull back, lean in the
direction his swing will travel.

USING ITEMS IN YOU PACK

You carry a pack where you keep the valuable items you find. To Look at the
items press space bar. To use an item from you pack, move the cursor to the
item and press the joystick button. To exit back to the action highlight a
blank square and press fire.

Most items are activated by selecting them. A few, however, require additional
commands:
        Blink spell - once you've selected the blink spell press the joystick
        button to blink.

        Carpet - select the carpet to ride through the air select it again to 
        deactivate.

        Fireball Spell (scroll with '3 shots' written under it) - once you've
        selected the fireball spell, press fire to cast a fireball.

        Protean Ring - select the protean ring to activate its magic power.
        select again to deactivate. Note: you can't climb ladders while in
        goblin form.

Sometimes using an item consists of setting it on the ground - eg you use the
gem by putting it down. Be carefull to pick up again an item if you set it
down in the wrong place or you'll not find it in your pack later on.

NOTES ON USING ITEMS

Each kinf of item has a specific use - spores can only be planted in dirt,
while the Troll Ritual Knife can only be thrown. You can't control how an item
is used, just when and where. Most items are only in a particular place - one
of the most challenging parts of the game is figuring out which item the
situation  demands.
When you first get an item, there's no way to know what it does until you try
it. You can guess an items general use - you wear rings drink potions etc -
but you can't know an items magical properties until you try it.

PAUSING THE GAME

If you need to pause the game press space to bring up your pack, to resume
move cursor onto a black square and press fire.

GETTING OUT OF PIT TRAPS

There are deadly pit traps in the Labyrinth - if you are not careful you may
find yourself hanging by your staff over rows of iron spikes. There is a way
out before your staff breaks under weight.
To swing out, gently rock your joystick back and forward at an even pace.

INCREASE VITALITY BY SLEEPING

Piles of straw provide comfortable, SAFE! places to rest and regain Vitality.
To sleep, move onto the straw and just stand there. After a moment, you'll lie
down and go to sleep. PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO YOUR DREAMS!

CLIMBING UP AND DOWN LADDERS

To climb up or down a ladder, move up to it and you'll automatically climb or
descend. Be careful going down ladders - move to the side of the opening with
the ladder or you'll fall to your death.

COMPLETING A LEVEL OF THE LABYRINTH

Whenever you complete a level, you'll get a certificate. WRITE DOWN YOUR
CERTIFICATES AND KEEP THE IN A SAFE PLACE. If you quit playing The Immortal,
you'll need the certificate later so you can start on the level you left off.
Once you've written down the certificate, press fire to begin the next level
or quit  and resume the game after you've been down the pub to get fucking
pissed.
When descending to the next level items not needed are automatically removed.

                  ------------------------------------

Thats basically it!! The rest of the manual is concerned with stories about
the creatures that inhabit the Labyrinth etc if you want to read that buy the
game......
