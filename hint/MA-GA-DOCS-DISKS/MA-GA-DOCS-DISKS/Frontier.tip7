I hope the game's more reliable than the demo. It worked the first
time after I downloaded it: now it crashes every time.

I have.  You need to be an Imperial Baron or the equivalent Federation rank
(whatever is one above Major... don't have it yet).  They give you a nuclear
missile and say 'go destroy this.'  I'm thinking that the space stations may
come next... kinda like they start you out assassinating piddling little spies
and then move you up to enemy governors and senators.

Try using + and -. I think they work the wrong way round, because I'm
always zooming in when I want to zoom out, but they're extremely handy
for admiring the cities, and for jsut having a good look round.

I am curious...  As an old Elite player I found keyboard controls to be
infinitely better than using a clumsy joystick. I could never do any
precision flying in such an imprecise sluggish manner that the joystick
controls offered.  I have not yet purchased Frontier due to its unavailability
in Canada, but could someone please tell me if the 'old' keyboard controls
are still intact in the new game??  I don't know if I want it otherwise..

Still waiting...

Well I dont really know more.
Just that about a yea and a half ago I considered getting an archimedes,
basically because of Elite.
It was awesome.
The only bit I saw was a demo of a hyperspace jump.
WShen the ship came out the other end, there were all these dots in the distance
with laser fire everywhere.
The demo then rolled into the battle, helping out large traders...
And that was all I saw.
I saw screen shots etc, but nothing else about gameplay.
Looked a lot better than frontier for space battles anyway.
Ill see if Ive still got a review and type it in for ya...

(Anyone got an archimedes emulator for the miggy?????!!!)

Alan.

Heard of, to the extent that Gametek are still playing the game of sliding
release dates with it.  That is, they still say it will be released, in a
few weeks' time; a few weeks later, it will be released in a few weeks'
time; etc.

Has anyone heard of a pirate version of the Atari ST version?  I've read
here about the Amiga version being pirated before it was released.  I've
heard of a pirate version for the PC, presumably also pre-release because
it had even more bugs than those discussed here (apparently you can't sell
the 1MW pulse laser from the Eagle fighter because the shipyard doesn't
think you have one).  I have not heard of a pirate version for the Atari ST.
Guess which format hasn't been released yet.

Disclaimer: I'm not looking for a pirate copy for the Atari ST, or any other
machine.  I'm looking for information about them.  What I would like to know
is, did Gametek release Frontier on the PC and Amiga, perhaps prematurely,
because pirate copies were already circulating and they were worried that too
many people would get pirate copies before they could get real copies?

Actually, I was looking around at some of the trading ships in a system
by targeting them on the system map and using the radar mapper, and one of
them had a hull condition of 48%!  I didn't touch him!  Never actually seen
other ships killing eachother, though, except for the police :)

24.  Surface graphics on the planets done like Commanche Maximum Overkill 
(This used the best "texture mapped" type terrain I've seen, the
packaging blurb called it Voxel technology). Often the graphics in this
looked just like the sort of thing JPL comes out with for fly overs
of mars etc.

25  Interior graphics for Ships/Space Ports/Towns done like Doom (or
at least if the game lives up to its screen shots).

Just dreaming I know .... sigh.

Ted.

P.S. applogies for posting comparisons to PC games in an amgia news group
but a) this is the defacto frontier group and b) the graphics
in the above game are better than I've seen in an Amiga game ...
please don't flame me cause I'm not saying that the Amiga can't do this
I'm just say I (that just me) havn't seen it done yet on an Amiga.

I found yet another bug -- I tried using a Boa trader, mounting weapons in
the lower turret. Well I ended blowing myself up in the first battle. It
seems that the bottom turret weapon always hits your own ship.  At first I
thought I was shooting my undercarriage, but even with it up, every shot
would do damage to my ship.  Even with -90' elevation, they'd hit inside.

Actually, I'd manage to blow my Panther Clipper away a few times with
turret shots to my own ship.  This is a tolerable bug -- I just am very
careful when elevation is near 0', but it'd still be nice to have a
'safety cutout' that prevents these kind of accidents...


Oh, um, I experimented with mining a few times.  Landing on planets is a
pain.  And once you've got your miner down, landing again to clean it
would be simpler if the autopilot would remember to drop the landing gear
when it landed. :-7

:   Have any of you seen Privateer or xwing?
:   That's what frontier combat should have been like!
:   If only.....

      No way.

      I played both Privateer and Frontier (I have a PC and an Amiga
      mind you :-)) and Privateer doesn't even come close to Frontier.
      The only thing Privateer has is "intelligent missions" (ala Wing
      Commander). But once you're through with them, you sell your
      game. Not so with Frontier. Not to mention the breathtaking space
      flight mechanism in Frontier, whereas Privateer won't even let
      you approach a base or a planet.

      Being both an Amiga and a PC player, I'm beginning to have some
      understanding of what sort of games are expected on
      these two machines. Frontier has gone almost completely
      unnoticed on PC (the cs.ibm.pc.games group hardly contains one message
      per day about it). PC players want well beta-tested, polished,
      straightforward games. Amiga players are more demanding
      (probably because the game industry is older on Amiga than PC)
      and a masterpice like Frontier is appreciated to its true value.
      PC gamers will only see the bugs and declare the game
      uninteresting. Sad.

      I suspect PC players will reach one day the maturity of Amiga
      ones one day (and I really don't mean to sound superior here, I
      enjoy PC games as well as Amiga's). This seems to be the trend
      as demonstrated by the Wing Commander / XWing / Privateer series
      (from the best to the worst).

Graphically looks like its 320X200X16, color pallette is fairly
monochromatic, although the space scenes use 2-3 more colors. As far as
detail in terms of stellar modeling, it's about as accurate as you're
going to see on a DSDD floppy, perhaps more so. After the ßeta testing

This is very odd. :-)

BTW, can you post the phone number for Gametek USA? I can't seem to find it

I use the mouse and think that is the best control.  The joystick is
the slow, so would be the keyboard I guess (haven't actually tried
it).  Only with the mouse can you yank around your ship fast enough to
follow ships passing close by your own ship.  In Frontier you need
very fast precision movements with your gunpoint, I am best at this
with the mouse.

You can select the old elite pitch/yaw controls on the options screen, but
sadly on the PC (which I have) the keyboard is VERY unreactive. A joystick
is the only way I can do space combat...

It is Ok for me (I mail ordered the version from the Uk) but here my friends
who
bought it have only french manuals.

You may want to ask for a detail of one of the "short stories" pictures for
non-english version?

Hello Frontiers !!

I think there are many more problems for a bug fix than
only the english/french/german/... manuals !!

Even all words in the german version are quiet different from
the english version. So this kind of patch would change a 
german V1.00 to an english V1.05 :-(

Moreover: what about the guys like me, who own a V1.01 or V1.0x ??

It should be there another method of patching FRONTIER to newer versions !


   HELLO  GameTek  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hi there SpaceDiscoverers,

I thought up a add-on to the Cemiess (-2,-2) cheat but havn't tried it out 
yet. Here it is:

- Make sure that you get about 40.000 Credits with the Cemiess-Liafeba
  route. (buy Precious Metals on Cemies' bulletin-board and sell them at
  Liafeba where you buy Robots which you sell at Cemies. Etc...This will
  take for about 2 1/2 months.).
  (+/- 75 tons of Precious metals will be left.)

- Make sure that you are on Cemiess (-2,-2).

- Now take a look at the Ships-Exchange-Market and see if you can buy a
  ship for about 37.000 credits. (Adder or something else)

---------Two possibilities--------:

- (1) There is only one of such a ship.
- (2) There are two or more of those ships.

---------Possibility (1)----------:

- Buy that ship ... +/- 3000 Credits left. The ship will be empty except
  for the hyperdrive-system and will have about 15 tons of free cargo.

- Go to the bulletin board and buy 15 tons of Precious-Metals: 
  15 * +/- 3000 Credits = +/- 45.000 Credits. => total of 48.000 Credits.
  60 tons of P.M. left.

- Buy your old ship back for -37.000 Credits. => total of 85.000 Credits.
  Magically your ship has been stripped from everything except the
  Hyperdrives and has 13 tons of free cargo.

- Buy 13 tons of Precious-Metals and buy the 37.000 Credits ship.
  => you earn 2000 credits with this step (not much but you can
  considder buying a more expensive ship and go on with your
  discoveries.) => Total of 87.000 Credits

- If you go on like this until all the precious metals are out of stock
  you will have earned about 200.000 Credits !!!!! And then there will
  be about 30 tons of Gems left (price -500 Credits).

---------Possibility (2)---------:

- Do the same as above but change between the same sort of ships.

- No prospects on this one ... yet maybe somebody can let me know....

I can agree with your points, but I said that frontier could do with having
the COMBAT FROM PRIVATEER, you must admit frontier combat is not a patch that
on privateer/xwing.

	Well, I disagree very strongly. I'm a PC owner (I do not have
Amiga only because I don't have the time and money to have 2 computers) 
and an avid player of Frontier. The reason PC people don't write about
Frontier in PC.games is simple: they write their messages here. I personally
see no reason whatsoever dividing the discussion on two groups since
Frontier is similar on both machines. And it seems that many others see
it that way, too. Frontier is a wonderful game on PC, too.
	And please explain your last chapter.
	
	jours, Petri

	PS. I do not play WC, X-Wing or Privateer. But that doesn't matter,
does it?

A STORY FROM FRONTIER


As I came out of hyperspace, I noticed the typical imperial navy squabble on the
radio. Among the names mentioned, where those of 'Imperial Cruiser Executor' and
'Fort Roxxan'. My triggerfinger twitched, but I decided to check out how many
there were before I shot them down.

And I had passengers aboard. But Ilika Mansjon, a female b-star of dream-movies,
was quite bitchy towards me and the crew since my ship was three weeks behind
schedule. My ship had run into some rather cheeky pirates in the last system,
even though my 2000-ton Panther Clipper bristled with guns and rockets, the 20-ton
light pirate cruiser pilot bluntly said 'Ha! Surrender or die!'. He lived some
twenty seconds more. And we had to assasinate a mafia topgun, he was reduced to
space-debris within seconds. The plasma accelerator is a mean machine. So no
wonder we were late.

So, after some three days, we arrived at the spacestation. Ohjoy, two imperial
medium cruiser (that big thing in the intro), floated innocently twenty
kilometers from the spacestation, which was of the old hexagon type. 

I dropped of Ilika, she was furios and told she would report me to the
authorities, so I told her to stuff it, and be glad she still was alive. Anyway,
her career was soon over, dream-movies has no use for thirty old women
unfortunately. But I had to admit, her travel hadnt gone as planned, she was some
sixty LY from her destination.

I filled my ship with fuel and left the station. My crew noticed my rather grumpy
mood, and cheered my up with a collage of the latest 50 kills. I smiled at them,
and soon we were happy.

As we exited, I quickly targeted the first cruiser. And fired the front gun. One
second it was there, a mile long battle-ship, the next nothing but burnt metal
and depressurised body-parts. My crew cheered, but a klaxon sounded an incoming
radio-message. 'Piracy and murder cant be tolerated, 10.000 credits in fine'.
Hmm, I had 200 Mcredits, no problem. I lined up my ship against the second
cruiser. By now, cops were leaving the spacestation, but they seemed very bad
pilots, they either chrashed in the space-station or their neighbour, but
ofcourse some managed to get away. I fired the second time. The last of the
cruiser disappeared.

Quickly my Panther Clipper turned 180 degrees and started a continous deadly
plasma beam at the incoming police-ships. Pof, pof! They went down one after the
another. Soon noone remained. My hull had been reduced to 78 percent, but quickly
repaired itself. Now it was the space-stations time. I fired a five minutes
barrage at the hexgon shaped station. Nothing happended except that I was fined
another time for the same amount. How devastating.

Bored at seing the spacestation taking hit after hit, I payed the fine and
entered the space-station. Noone mentioned to me that I've just killed 20 of
their ships and two cruiser, they seemed very neutral they did. We tanked, used
the recreation and I spent 10 Mcredits on some obscure organisation. Shame they
dont have casinoes on the spacestations, easy way to win some (or loose).

We left shortly after.

Stig, Average, Panther Clipper w/what's in the manual, and 192 Mcredits.

Hello all,

Sorry for being a traitor and all - but I own the PC
version of Frontier. Don't slag me off tho' as I am still
an Amiga fanatic! :)

Anyway the point of this post is to say that I've seen my
first slamming of elite II in a magazine - PC Format. It only
got %50ish, whereas Amiga Format and most others have given 
it around 90%.

Basically , they complained that the graphics were nothing
special (so how many times have they seen a game where you
can land on a planet and watch planets, suns and stars all
sail past together with real-time rendering of curved vectors
and light/shadow effects!) They seemed to reckon that the
graphics were not a patch on x-wing (did they stop
to notice the super-space stations off mars - wow!)

So, just feel lucky amiga guys that you don't have to put
up with tosh such as PC Format (incidentally their coverdisk
was crap. Lucky amiga guys getting stuff like Imagine from
Amiga format).

It almost makes me wish I'd bought an A4000 instead :(
but it doesn't quite have true colour.

Oh well, see you.

Alex

Amiga Power (okay, I didn't buy it, read it at a newsagents, honest!)
slagged it off as well. But then unless its a platform game or mindless
shoot-em' up games never get a good review.

Whilst undertaking an assassination mission for the federal military the
target (a Panther clipper) did not jump into hyperspace after leaving the
space station. Since I was bored (after 1/2 an hour of game time) I fired
a missile at the ship and then engaged in a  succesful dogfight.

Since I had fired a missile close to a space station I expected to be
admonished by officialdom, however they were completely silent. Curiosity
fired, I went back to a saved gave and fired a missile at the panther
clipper _immediately_ it left the station, again no criminal record
despite destroying the ship within 100km of the station!

Now my question... is this a legitimate tactic or a bug?

Could the author of the Frontier patch please mail it to me?  I recently
purchased Frontier (v1.05, no less!), and the EXIT thing still doesn't exit the

Okay, I've accepted my first "retirement" contract in FRONTIER, but I
don't know how to carry it out, even though I've tried the obvious. 

I've sat around at the Starport until about 10 minutes before the
"retiree" was expected to depart (at 12:51:01, in this case.) Then, I
lifted off, hovering and hovering, waiting for my prey's ship to lift
off from the pad as well, intending to follow him out of the stratosphere.

Well, nothing happened. Nobody lifted off from the pad at Sirocco at
12:51:01. Well, I figured the game is saying, "Look, the guy's not stupid:
he sees some unidentified craft floating about, he's not going to come out
and play." 

So, I tried again: only this time, I hung around just outside of the
planet's atmosphere, at maybe 4 - 3K kilometers. Nothing. Do I need
special equipment to do this? Can I just do it with the stock Eagle I
start with? Am I going about this all wrong? HELP!

When you are doing assasinations on the planet surface, the best tactic
is to take off about 30 mins before the ship is about to turn up.
Instead of boosting out of the atmosphere, just fly your ship a little
way out of the starport, and rough land with your ship facing the
launch-pad.  Switch on text, and then time-skip to about a minute
before your target is about to take off.  Sure enough, your target
will appear, and you can lock onto him, engage autopilot and start
blasting.

(Be vary careful that you don't ram him - he's much bigger than
 you and the results could be .... unfortunate)

I've had exactly the same experiences. Annoying, isn't it?

No idea how to fix it, either.

God, I hope that's not a bug. I've been trying to get some answers on
assassination attempts, and assumed that I was just doing something wrong
when I was hanging out at whatever station, waiting to kill whoever --and
they never showed up. Someone tell me this isn't a bug. I'm going to be
pissed if this is a bug.

I have been out of the amiga game scene for quite some time.  Today I 
decided to read some game posts and I read about the game Frontier.
I have never seen anything about it before.  It sounds so cool.  So I 
have some questions about, since I can only afford to get 3 or 4 games
a year I like to make sure they will hold my interist for a few months.

Is it hard drive installable?
Does it crash on a 2.1 030 system?
What is the last version, I read that there were some
bugs in v1.00.  How do I know I am buying the latest version?
Where can I get it for a good price?  mail order or in south florida.
Is there a story line or do you just go on randomly generated missions?
What are the main improvements over Elite?  For example, new weapons
or new commands and functions, etc?
Is there a demo version?
Is the manual well done, explaining about the various ships and equipment
and stuff or do you have to figure it out by playing the game.

Since I have an amiga 2000 with an 030, a 486 33, and a mac IIfx
which version is the best, smoothest, best graphics?

(actualy only the amiga is mine, but the other two computers are my
parents, so I can use them all I want)
 
thanks.

Well, alot of people seem to have this problem, but in a total of somewhere
over 100 missions I've only ever had them not show up twice, and both times I
fixed that by restoring an old save and being sneaky.  Here's the deal;

The standard way to catch your target is to land at the port they are going to
be coming out of.  Make sure you have the right day (I once got there on
January 17 for a February 17 assassination).  Wait until the correct day and a
short time before the scheduled departure (how short ranges from 30 minutes to
30 seconds depending on personal preference really).  Now the important parts;

1:  Do not stay directly over the launch site.  If you do they will often not
come out until you move.  The way to spot this problem is if the launch bay
stays open after you leave (if you fly out and stop immediatly it will do this)
Get out of the way and the target will come out.

2:  The target usually comes out within 2 or 3 seconds before or after the
appointed time (see 1 above for an exception... there they come out a few
seconds after you get out of the way).

3:  The target usually does not stick around long.  95% of the time they will
either hyperspace or turn around and go right back to the base (I once had a
target in a Panther at the 82 Eridani system... the only base within range was
the one he came out of... could only hyperspace to one other system and there
were no bases there.  Thus he just came out and turned around and went back...
no matter what.  Had to use the missile bug to kill him right there).
Sometimes they will fly to another base in the same system... this is great but
don't count on it.

4:  If you are too far from the base you will never even see them come out most
of the time.  In this case you want to watch your system map (f2-f2).  At the
time they are set to depart (or right around then) a ship dot will appear on
the planet.  Target it and use communications (f4) to verify that it is the
correct ship (don't place a call, just get the 'Send message to ship xx-yyy'
message and check the registration number)

5:  Anywhere that it still displays your altitude should be close enough to
spot the target.  I prefer to hover over the base at about 10,000.  If they are
leaving an orbital station you want to still be able to make out the writing on
the station... maybe 6-10 km or thereabouts.


If you do all this (right date, exact time, close enough to see or checking
system map (f2-f2)) and they STILL don't show up then you've probably got what
I call the 'forewarned' feature.  I >THINK< this occurs based on a couple of
things.  First if the system the target is at is right next to the system where
the bulletin was posted (a target in Vequess on the bulletin board in Facece
for instance) then they might well hear about it.  Second, if you just sit
around outside the base for a couple of days they are likely to figure it out.
This is characterized by a couple of things;

A:  If you are waiting in the station the police suddenly pounce on you (often
days before the event) for 'piracy and murder.'  If this happens you have to
pay the fine and the target WILL NOT show up.  My suggestion... reload an old
save.

B:  If you are waiting outside the station for a long time the target will just
not show up.  Again I suggest reloading.

FIX:  Time your arrival.  Figure out how long the jump to the system and flight
to the base will take and then wait around in a neighboring system.  Time your
arrival at the target's base for about 5 hours before departure.  Land at the
base, refuel, get all your missiles stocked up, and launch a short time before
the target... they should come out as normal.


If you do ALL this and they still don't come out then all I can say is that it
must be a bug in your version because via this method I have NEVER failed to
complete an assassination.

Just a thought but couldn`t this be a FEATURE? I mean, both sides will have 
advanced intelligence and counter-intelligence staff (this being a cold war).  
It would be quite common for a target to get news of an assassination attempt 
and thus not show up when expected. Has anyone tried wandering around nearby 
star systems to see if the ship can be found in the area?

I think what he was trying to say was that it happens so often. If 4 in 5 
contracts fail because of counter intelligence, then it must be shit hot.

(also have version 1.00 and use wormhole to get to location
 in two jumps)

I found that the station missions are the worst.  Also
those at systems that have more than one star.  The
missions at stations would always be iffy.  The best
method is to hang around for a while at the point
where you jumped in, then make your run so you
will only have to wait at dock for less than two
days.  Take off about 15 minutes before the time,
and I usually backward thrust (-5.2 kmh) at almost
90 degrees from the door.  This seems to work for
me.

Planetary missions, you just take off early, climb
to 12,000km (jump range), and then wait around for
the target.  You will need to run accelerated time,
at normal time your ship will rise or drop.  I
usually kill the target before they jump and pay
the fine.  (missile, then kill = 600cr fine).

I also will take 2-5 missions at a time.  I make
sure that I have enough time between to get there,
and make sure that they are all single star,
and planetary if possible.

It took me 26 assassinations to move to lord, but
I wasn't immediately offered photograph missions.
I ran 6 more assassinations before I got recon.

Don't be so patronising. I had figured this out, but then I got to wondering
what difference the stack size made to a program that shut down the OS
anyway. Any way, it _doesn't_ work. At least, it hasn't for me.

Good grief.

Oh- and here's an AAARGHHH for you, too. ARRRGGGHHH.

Great.

Neil.

Bzzzt.  Spin again.  The program does NOT shut down the OS.  There are 3 ways
to crash Frontier that I am aware of;

1:  There are a couple of obcure bugs in the assassination sequence that can
cause a crash... I doubt you've gotten that far, so this is out. 

2:  You've got the stack size set too low so the game crashes at various
intervals when you do things it can't handle.  100000 seems to work fine.

3:  You've got processes running in the background and one of them suddenly
does something (open a new window for instance) that makes Frontier freak out.

Since you were under the mistaken impression that the OS was shut down it might
be number 3.  It can't be number 1 because that only occurs in specific
instances when you are a ways along in the game... not at random.  My money is
on option 2 though... seems to be the cause of 99.99% of the 'frontier sucks it
keeps crashing on me' cries.

Other than that it might be some problem I haven't seen.  Probably hardware
related.

I'd agree with this. If you're suffering a lot of crashes make sure nothing
else is going on. The number of crashes I've suffered has dropped a lot
since I quit the screen blanker under 3.0 :-( I'm not too impressed but
there you go. I could be paranoid or completely wrong but it's hard
to check.

Yeah- I have got that far. Weeks ago.

Nope. I've set the stack to 10 times this, and I've tried numerous values in
between.

Nope. I only run three background processes. Tool Daemon, Spliner (a
commodity), and Virus Checker. Even when I shut all three, there are
problems.

   I've booted my computer straight into the game, which also doesn't do the
trick.

No-pe. Frontier sucks- It's an excellent game, but for me on my bog standard
'3000 with softkick ROM and 6 meg ram, it's an unplayable game.

Yes, probably. Unfortunately, I have an absolutely bog standard '3000, save
for my extra memory (Have you run Frontier using "Nofastmem"?- It's so
slow.)

   Thanks for your input.

Neil.

You have to get a hex editor and poke through the executable, looking for
something like "Frontier Version 1.00 released to GameTek on (date)," where
(date) is approximately one year too early...

Load the sucker up into a text and/or hex editor and do a search for "Version".

Ooops.....  What I meant to say before is this:

Load it into, heck I dunno... A text editor like CygnusEdPro and search for:

Version

...and you should get something like the following returned to you:

Version to Gametek (Release 4) 1.05

(Thats what I got outa mine, at least)

 Just to know, how do you tell which version of Frontier
you have e.g V1.02? It isn't stated on the box or manual?...

Thanks.

Get a Moray Starboat! It's a bit smaller than Cobra MK III, but bigger than
Cobra MK I..  The hyperspace range is 20.96ly, if I remember correctly.

It is possible to use the traditional Elite keyboard controls which I
am very fond of in Elite, and I used on Frontier for a few days. I
soon learned, howvever, that the mouse is far better in Frontier than
the joystick or keyboard, certainly in combat situations.

Well, I've tried my stack at many many different sizes. I didn't think it'd
make a difference, if Frontier chucks away the operating system, but who
knows. So anyway, it still crashes. I've a hunch that it's certain save
files, ie I can play one save file for ages, but if I load a more recent
one, it's sure to crash. I save it far more (my more recent saves) to try
and "purge" the offending save files, but more often than nt the new file
still causes a crash.

   I wouldn't mind, but I haven't (until recently) exploited any bugs at
all. Then I found a bug so's you can make 300000 credits with two button
presses, and I made 2000000000 credits. :) Maybe unsurprisingly, the credits
thing loops round to - 2000000000ish. wierd. Or not.

    Sporadic crashing is difficult to analyse. I've had the thing
    crash, but only because I forgot to set the stack before starting
    it.

    The bulletin board problem can be avoided by ensuring the board is
    displaying the top item whenever you leave a base, and it can be
    overcome by fast-forwarding to the next day. It gets reset first
    thing very day (same time you get charged the docking fee).

    Fast-forwarding solves other problems too. It prevents the
    autopilot from crashing when you try to land, and I've run into a
    few places where it hasn't been possible to take off because your
    ship crashes just as it's leaving a covered base. A solution is to
    fast-forward straight after getting launch permission, and then
    fast-forwarding again when the message about your launch time
    expiring appears. For some reason the second fast-forward leaves
    you floating in space.

When I was having some fun blasting away Federal Military crafts after doing 
a photography mission for the Imperialists (by the way thanx to all the 
replies to my query as to how to complete these photographical missions...)
I got the message from Elite Federation.....Right On Commander! At last, at 
long BLOODY last I've finally increased my rank from Competant to Dangerous, 
I thought. Upon looking at my achievements screen I was still Competant. In 
fact nothing had changed at all..........So.......my question is why was 
this message sent to me in the first place........Could it be another in the 
long list of bugs whereby I was really awarded Dangerous status but a bug 
in the program did not increase my rank.......Am I doomed to be Competant 
forever? I assumed I had increased rank because this is the message I was 
familiar with when playing Elite on the Amiga. Is there is any other 
likely reason why this message was sent. Did I kill someone important in 
all the blasting? I'd really like to know! Any (viable) suggestions would 
be most welcome.


			Thanx in advance......


			Keep Blastin'...........

    It isn't necessary to target ships. I used to do that, but now I
    just swivel and fire, and leave the targetting alone. I had hoped
    that the little green square would assist in aiming, or that I
    could use the autopilot to aim, or that, like Elite, there'd be a
    beep when the ship was directly in my sights (useful for aiming),
    but none of these things have happened.

    I thought you had to target and then [R]adar ships to get
    bounties, but that isn't necessary either.

Let me put it this way: I sure wasn't looking for bugs either, but I still
found them. 

1) when starting from Mars, I got 100000100 cr. on the display (not in my
account, though).

2) when selling fertilizer on a planet where they had none, it turned from
   4t (after selling) to 65534t (after looking at the BBS and returning to
   stockmarket) I then proceeded to make a nice profit by selling all this
   fertilizer to someone on the BBS (paying twice the value).

3) Oh yeah, I can't remove my 1mw pulse laser, coz' the shipyard says I don't
   have one. When I buy a new one, I can then remove it. When I buy a new 5mw
   laser, it still only shows a 1mw pulse laser (and this is the laser I then
   still shoot with).

4) this is a nice one. When I decided to make a little profit (had only
   2000cr, private, outsider, harmless) by selling illegal animal skins,
   I turned fugitive. Ok so far. I also turned ELITE...


The PC version doesn't have less bugs. They're just different.
(I've got all the usual bugs as well, don't worry :) ).

And bow is what these Federation scum shall do. They call themselves the
galaxies best, why the worst of my slaves could destroy a fleet of these
oh-so-hot pilots of the Federal Army. Though as my comrade in arms notes,
this is not their only shortcoming, as they lack any ability to negotiate at
all. Many times in a battle against 30 Federation ships, I have shown mercy,
offering these pilots the chance to surrender, and making clear the
penalties for non-compliance. Not once have they taken my offer, indeed they
attempt to make a mockery, by laughing in my face. But as always, the last
laugh is mine, for scattered across the voids of space are the imploded
remains of each and every one of these foolhardy soliders.

Long live the Emperor

Hello!

Is there anyway to cancel missions that you have chosen from either the
Federation or the Empire?

It's quite irritating when you accept a missions just to find out that there
are no starports nor spacestations in the system you are supposed to deliver
the stuff provided.

/Annoying!/

BTW, any comments on the Imperial Trader? I'm considering buying it since it
seems to be one h*ck of a ship!

Dunno -- I've never had any problems landing "rough" on a planet, ever.

It's easy. Here's what you do:

- Get to the vicinity of the planet.
- Aim yourself at the limb of the planet and fly towards it at a reasonable
speed. You may wish to use time acceleration to various degrees.
- Eventually, the altitude indicator on the HUD comes on. Shortly thereafter,
your ship will automatically roll so that you are right side up with respect
to the ground.You've finished the hardest part already.
- Tilt the nose down a bit... fly towards the ground... reduce speed... lower
landing gear... at around 20 or 30 meters, you should have _no_ forward
velocity. Point your ship's nose straight at the horizon; let
gravity take you down the rest of the way. And _voila_ (French for "you've
landed on the planet",) you've landed on the planet. The little status
thingy should say "Landed (rough)".

Caveat: The biggest ship I've ever flown is the Constrictor I've got right
now. I've heard that larger ships, with more mass to swing around, tend to
be more difficult to land, but I have no personal experience there.

Now, here's _my_ question. How can you fuel scoop from a gas giant and then
still escape? I've fuel scooped twice -- first time, no problems, got into
the atmosphere, filled the hold, flew away. Second time, got into the
atmosphere, filled the hold, found that my forward velocity was dropping
no matter what I did with the engines. Also, in a gas giant's atmosphere
I get an Altitude: 0 meters reading on the HUD. Just another bug, I suppose?
It does make things rather confusing!

                              Mmmm... floor pie.

Greetings,

Apologise if this has been asked before...

I've done just about everything you can do in FRONTIER except for mining,
the only problem is...how the hell do you land on planets....

1. Ok, I get to the vicinity of a rocky planet by Autopilot.
2. Continue to reduce my speed until its 0 by the time I hit the atmosphere.
3. And then after that my ship explodes...yes I've got atmospheric shielding.

So what am I doing wrong...???
Can anyone help...please...???

Summary: A scientific explanation of some of the stranger features in Frontier


There have been a lot of posts recently about some features in Frontier.
After having tried these I have come up with a plausible explanation for these.

Starting with the wormholes:
As you all know, the Universe is wrapped into itself. This causes 'mirror' 
galaxies to appear at set distances. Hyperspace, which is a completely
different universe, is also wrapped into itself, but this wrapping is
much tighter. I think that it's about 200 ly in diameter.
Because during a hyperspace-jump the hyperspace is 'mapped' to the real space,
'mirrors' of your position are formed about every 650 ly, so that you can
jump this great distance with little fuel.

About the passenger cabins:
If you sell a ship with a passenger on board, the shipyard actually doesn't
complain. But the passenger is quite displeased with the fact that you sell
a ship with him/her on board. Because of lack of care from the government
you don't have any problem with this. The passenger will then buy the ship 
back from the shipyard for you, so in fact you are costing the passenger
money!

Some other bugs actually are bugs, In your on-board AI which you inherited
from your grandpa, so it's quite old (and thus as smart as a horses ass)
This causes various bugs, such as the bulletin-board bug and the songs
which you hear while piloting. Because an AI is something personal,
you are stuck with it.

This is all I can think of right now, so if you have any questions, feel
free to ask.

See you in BrabenSpace !

I agree with most (all) of what Mike Noreen suggests and I have a few 'add-ons'.

1- The game should have a little more depth, I mean, it could trade size
   for  detail.  The  creatures,  individuals,  corporations  and  races
   should   behave   more    intelligently    and   should   have   more
   auto-determination.  On other words there should be  happenning  more
   things "behind the scene".

2- Elite style missions are not that much  important, at least if a good
   "random mission generator" could be implemented.

3- Technically  there  are some  major  faults  but I think  they can be
   handled  easily.  The most annoying of which (on my point of view) is
   the dreaded "police suicide  syndrom" when launching their spacecraft
   from an orbital station.

4- A war  between  the Empire and the  Federation  is an  absolut  must!
   Alien empires on the farthest  reaches of cosmos would also be a good
   adition, Better even if all could be handled randomly.

5- Enemies  should be, at least,  tougher (MUCH  tougher) if they are to
   give any  fight at all.  If  making  cleverer  enemies  is a bit 'too
   much' (from the programmers point of view), then make the NASTY!

6- A major  problem in trade is that,  sooner or later, you are going to
   find  the two  perfect  systems  and  the  two  perfect  goods  to be
   merchandised.  Therefore,  all you  have to do  then  is to wait  and
   trade...  I mean, I can't hold a benevolent  smile when I see someone
   offering me $400 for an information or even 10000 for a contract when
   I can get, at least, 40000 on a single cargo run with a  medium-sized
   ship (robots from Barnards Star to Sol on a Tiger Trader).


All in all this is a great  game  (the  best i ever  played)  and,  most
important , has a lot of features which can be improved in a way to make
this 'the' game of the decade.

I loved  the way  physics  and the  more or less  realistic  orbits  and
gravity are handled.

                                                        J.M.B

Yes, and how dare you call us slave traders. My slaves are
a lot happier than the beggars and starving peasants
littering the streets of the Federation planets. One of my
slaves said only the other day that he'd rather be torn apart
by horses than be a 'free man' in the Federation. So I tore him
apart *8-).

I have never had problems with victims not turning up until today. I was
sent to kill a very slow ship. It didn't show up. I went back a few days
and looked at the system map: the ship was too slow to catch up with the 
orbital station, so it went round in circles for days and days and
couldn't
get in. I killed it after the mission date and will go to see if that is
good enough.

Does giving money to charity do any good? 
What difference do legal statuses make?

I have also seen ships hyperspace immediately or turn round and go back
in,
but this is the first time I have seen one not succeed in reaching the
destination. (I have noticed myself that on some time settings I sometimes
stay at the same distance from things with very short orbital periods.
I suppose this happens to computer-run ships as well.)

Definitely.
If you've wrecked your reputation by not delivering passengers in time,
lying to a information seeker or something like that, you may spend a hell 
of a time trying to find anyone who'll even consider trading with you, let
alone pay in advance..
If you just give a few 10Ks to charity this situation will clear up.

Hi there. I just grabbed a file dissecting program from aminet, and I've had
a poke through the code of Frontier.

Here's what I found:

Version to Gametek (Release 3) 1.02

If the offer is still on, could someone mail me the latest Amiga version? Feel
free to ask me to quote a couple of Paragraphs from the manual just to check
I'm not a pirate.

Yeah- please mail me _first_. I'd hate to have 20 copies all turn up at
once.

Thanks in advance,

Neil.

If you've waited for several days, I would guess that you are using time
accelleration.  Don't!

I have used this technique and the target has never failed to arrive.

1.  Leave the target base 6-9 hours before the due time.
2.  Time accellerate until you are within 2 minutes of the correct time.
3.  Set time to real time.
4.  The target will leave exactly when your contract says.

If you are time speeding, you will never see the victim leave.

Is it a bad thing to have a criminal record?  This is supposed to be a
serious question.

I have been busted a couple of times for trading in illegals, but I have
always paid my fine (or bribed the cops!).

I am still clean, but I have Smuggling on my record.
Will it go away after a while?
Will it impact on my military promotions?

Hi all,

I just heard something that one or two of you might be
interested in. According to a C= rep at the Melbourne Home
Computer Show, Frontier will be released for CD32 in about
4 weeks !!!!

Has anyone else heard this ? Is it really true ???!!!!

If it is, then let's hope it makes use of the 020 and Akiko
for a decent frame rate. 


SUBJECT CHANGE ***  I hope all 3D games for CD32 are written
to take advantage of faster processors. When and if the addons
for the 1200/4000 arrive then there will be plenty of users
who can run CD32 games on an 030/040 (me included). I hope all 
CD32 3D games are written like Frontier, and run at the highest 
framerate the CPU can handle. Otherwise we'll be in for a new
era of lowest-common-denominator games that either run no smoother
on faster CPU's, or worse still, crash.    Just my 2 cents worth :)


Anyway, let's just hope FrontierCD32 isn't vapour....


Steve :)

Just for a change of scenery and a laugh I've decided to have a go at 
asteroid mining, but........Would someone, in their infinite wisdom, let me 
know of a system where I can go mining asteroids. The location of a system 
where asteroids are plentiful and occur at a very regular basis would be 
appreciated. Initially I went, to what I thought would be the most obvious 
choice.......the asteroid belt which exists in our own solar system between 
the orbit of Mars and Jupiter where Ceres is located. Nothing....not a 
sausage......I didn't even find one, and I flew from Mars to Jupiter and 
back about 6 times......seems Braben didn't take this natural phenomenon 
into account in his game (you can correct me if I'm wrong). 

Just a thought.......but the inclusion of little things like comets (
Halley's, for instance) and colouring space black would, for me, make the 
game a little more realistic and enjoyable (bugs notwithstanding.......).


Anyway.........

    What I do is cruise along until the alarm goes, then hit F7-F7 to
    turn the engines off, hold down Enter to thrust forward, and
    swivel around looking for the pirate ship. Try using the mouse for
    this - once you get the hang of it, it's not too bad. Probably
    better than a joystick, in fact. Anyway, eventually the scanner
    comes on, and you just follow the foe with a constant stream of
    fire until it dies.

    Sometimes you have to turn off to one side to avoid being rammed,
    or you have to reverse (Shift), but that's basically it. There is
    no need to target the foe unless you believe in using missiles.

    In Elite, left rotated you counter-clockwise and right rotated you
    clockwise. This can be useful for matching the arcs that enemy
    ships move in, but after some practise you will probably find that
    the mouse and direct left/right movement is easier.

Same here.  I've never seen Elite (though I'm old enough), so I might have
a perspective that is different.  I bought Frontier based on the postings
here.  (Everybody make sure you put "Heard about it on USENET" on the
warrenty card.)  Frontier is an awesome game!

Actually, I think the Autopilot-that-smacks-you-into-stations-and-planets
is worse.  It was a frustrating day, when I first started to play, and
couldn't really survive for long.  Luckily the time skip prevents this.

5A- Give an option for the aggressiveness to enemies.  My nephew enjoys the
game with all the nifty firing of weapons, but he invariably gets toasted
by the first significant enemy.

My father (in his 70s) is fascinated by the game, but would prefer to have
no combat at all.  He wants to explore the galaxy, see faraway places, and
become a trading mogul.  (This would be a great feature for beginners, NO
COMBAT).

I personally get a real kick out of killing Imperial Couriers with an Eagle
Mk I with a 1MW pulse laser and no shields.

Enemies could be:
- non-existant
- brain dead (or just plain stupid)
- reasonably aggressive
- killer fighters
- BLAZEMONGER in space

The purpose in Frontier is not just to have a killer arcade game.  It's
purpose was to exist, survive, and flourish in a UNIVERSE.  I think Braben
may have accomplished both.

Other items for enhancement:

- Click on the star system in the galactic map to select/center it.

- Analog joystick support.

- Piracy on the high seas (space?).  The ability to take (or tow) someone
else's ship if you manage to get them to surrender.

- Click on planets on the schematic summary screen for autopilot targets.

- Ability to center the current system map on the autopilot selected target
with a single keypress (like hitting C on the galactic map).

- Collapsar systems.  It would be pretty nifty to come across a rotating
black hole or Neutron star.

- Trading from large ships to stations.  It's a beast to try to rough land
a Panther Clipper when there is a perfectly good orbiting city overhead.

- Real music.  When I first FTP'd the Frontier Demo, I thought I would
never stop humming the tune.  The melody is simple, the beat is catchy, and
the instruments are the worst since Sonix.  I love classical music, but the
same songs over and over can get to you.

Somebody ought to have a contest for MODs to submit to Braben for inclusion
in future updates  (He could dictate the format, the max size of the
instruments, and max size of the MOD).  Maybe a CD³² version would have
audio tracks of superior quality.  I would _love_ to have a CD or MOD
quality version of the Frontier theme.  (Hey, Michael!  How about it?)

I agree.  The robustness/richness of the game is what makes it so
worthwhile.  Little bugs here and there are annoying, but everything is so
BIG, you tend to forget it.

Yeah- I figured I'd do something I hadn't thought of before- run from
floppy. First time crashed, but the second time lasted pretty good. I'm
pretty sure it's to do with the savegame. Hmm.

I've poked through it with a file editor, and came up with:

Version to Gametek (Release 3) 1.02

.. and I've asked for someone on here to post me v1.05, but no luck yet.

Thanks, anyway,

Neil.

Subject: Missiles in Frontier...
Lines: 48

...aren't quite as useless as generally believed. I've made use of them
quite well, to the extent that I generally try to keep two of them
around. Here's the tips on it:

1. Use NN500 Naval Missiles. The enemy always seems to have ECM -- but no ECM
can kill a Naval Missile. Plus, they deliver a bigger punch, if the manual
is to be believed. However, these are a Federation weapon -- they're not
available outside the Fed. So you Imperial weenies are out of luck... the
only way you're going to get a Naval Missile is up your tailpipe. >;)

2. If you want to cheat, you can fire a missile at any ship and then hit
double time acceleration. Hitting time acceleration causes all missiles
in flight to instantly reach their targets. This also counts for missiles
targeted at _you_... I don't like to take advantage of program bugs, however.

3. Playing fairly: missiles, even naval ones, are of very little use against
any ship that's small or fast-moving or both. They can and do dodge away
until the missile runs out of gas and dies. On the other hand, while running
from the missile, they will be too occupied to fire at _you_... so this may
be a handy technique to chase an enemy away to give your shields time to
recover, or you could attack them while the missile is distracting them.

4. Against Imperial Traders/Couriers or larger ships, the missile _does_
come in handy. For best results, forget everything you learned in F/A-18
Interceptor -- firing at the rear of a ship is not necessarily the best
option, as they will have more time to dodge a missile they're running from.
My favorite technique is to arm the missile then continue steering with the
mouse and engines on, while keeping a finger on the "M" key. When the other
ship approaches to make a close flyby, point the nose ahead of it, leading
the enemy, then fire. This is using the weapon as a "dumb-fire" missile, but
it tends to work. A single Naval Missile will do 50% hull damage on an
Imperial Trader, and knock down half of the shields on a heavily shielded
Panther Clipper.

Now, it may be a little cheaper to just use lasers... but honestly, I think
missiles are a lot more fun. So these tips may help you use them.

(Dream: I'd kind of like to see intership combat carried out at distances
of thousands or millions of KM and handled with launched fighter craft
and guided missiles. Lasers and focused ECM could be used against enemy
missile fire... Sigh. When is a space _battleship_ simulation gonna come
out??)

I've always thought that Naval Missiles are an Imperial weapon, but then again,
I haven't been in Federal space for years.. (except assassinations!)
I mean, Naval missiles can be bought anywhere in Imperial space.

Wrong.  You can buy these at Achenar[1,-4] imperial homeworld, Zaonce[-2,-6]
independent system (part of the old Elite universe) and about any other
planet that has a large technical base.

I took a retirement mission and destroyed a ship without ever hitting it. 
I flew in behind the ship after it took off.  When I got within 0.5 km it
started evasive manuvers.  I went to a higher altitude and then turned 
back down on the the ship and fired a smart missile. In avoiding the missile
the other ship plowed into the planet.  I stilled failed the mission.
I don't know if it was because I showd up to early or if I didn't get credit
because the ship crashed into the planet.

Yep, begin NAVAL missiles, you'd expect to get them in places run my the

I've encountered a similar problem on assassination and photo missions -
some planets seems to have such strong gravity that level flight or
hovering in the atmosphere is impossible (Behoqu seems prone to this, I've
even been unable to take off from here. Effect has also occurred at
Achenar 8b) even with full engines on. The problem is not that I'm going
too fast to turn in time, even from several hundred kilometres up the
velocity indicator slowly creeps down towards the planet despite firing my
engines...

Looking at such system information screen, these planets do not seem to be
particularly massive, nor be out of the ordinary in any way. In addition
my ship is small (Cobra Mk-I) with a class 3 military drive so shouldn't
suffer inertia problems to the same degree as larger ships.

This makes completing these missions very difficult, and I've been
wondering if this was a bug or simply something I've missed...

I've also had problems when landing with the larger ships - I'm finding that I'm still decending at about 100km/h with a 60degree pitch and main engines running. Is there an easier way?

As for fuel scooping from gas giants: I try not to go too far into the atmosphere and keep a good forward velocity. The further into the atmosphere you go, the harder it is to escape. I think the flashing '0 altitude' is a warning of some kind - I've trie
d landing before but always explode. Maybe the mass of the planet is too big (hence gravity is big also?)

If you try to land on a gas giant, you try to land on NOTHING!
As the name says, there is only gas...
And for that, the "Altitude: 0km" is OK... since your on the "surface" of the
planet....

But also if it just have a REALY big atmosphere in relation to it's core:
a gas giant has a gravity of about 100g and more...
How you think you could ever escape?
Your fighter/trader/explorer must have more than that to launch!
And how did you think you could withstand such a gravity?
I didn't have seen any ship with any aggregate to eliminate the strange forces
(think of yourself having a weight of 8t instead of 80kg)...

You could try the federation military fuel research system, around [-1,-1]
there always seems to be loads of asteroids floating around when you 
hyperspace into the system.

I did it by going out of an Imperial space station, and then
starting to shoot at anything that moves.  The police came out,
and fragged my ship, and I suddenly had 150 tons of 'rubbish' -
my hyperdrive was hyperdead.  used the chance to install a size 6
hyperdrive.

Boy, it cuts down on your available space a lot.  15LY max is
much better than 10.42 light years.

Sorry, your right, I have mistyped my laser strength ;)
I "only" have a 1MW beam laser....
But it's strong enough for most ships...
also I now have a fuelscoop so I may travel to my target:
The center of the Galaxie! (Only ~50.000 ly)
I've seen that there are MANY systems with "no reported stations"...
How can this be true when all systems around aren't visited before?

There is _one_ other permit: to YZ Canis Minoris, a wealthy communist system.
It's a couple sectors to the east of Sol. It's worth visiting, but I don't
know if it's on any major trade routes worth mentioning. They do import
luxury goods, though.

Hi,

I've been playing Frontier on my Amiga 1000 for about a week
now and I've had no crashes.  The only "bug" I've seen is
in the Bulletin Board which sometimes won't let you scroll
backwards.  This is solved by waiting until midnight when
the board is refreshed.  Just accelerate game time with the
>>>>> button.  So far it's lots of fun.  I have 8.5MB of
memory and it's installed on one of my hard disks, with
stack set at 100000, I have no problems with the software.
You do have to turn off any mouse accelerators and screen
blankers, but that's true with a lot of games.  I use the
highest detail level and find that response is fine. I have
version 1.05 or some such number.  Combat is difficult
with your initial ship so stay in the SOL <--> Barnard
system running Luxury Goods to Barnard and Robots and
Computers to SOL.  Save your money and upgrade your ship
several times before you take on aggressors.  No one will
attack you in the SOL or Barnard systems. So sell your
missiles and scanner, in fact everything except the autopilot
which you need to land.  You can even get rid of the atmospheric
shields if you're willing to stick to space stations and airless
moons.  This gives you the most room for cargo to make money so
you can get a bigger ship.  Good luck, have fun.

-mjw-

P.S. I also highly recommend Hired Guns

Here's a little trick i found (haven't seen it mentioned yet)
and it doesn't seem to do much but it will wast your time.

 Just before you jump to hyperspace click on the communications button
 then hyperspace jump WHILE you are still jumping click on one of the
 options for communication. 
 you get slowed down in hyperspace and most of the buttons don't work
 if you hit time advance the jump completes but if you don't hit
 time advance you move through hyperspace slowly.

I got offered my first military assassination mission last night.  I had to
destroy a ship en-route between a planet-side base and an orbital.  I had
about 2 minutes to do it an hyperspace out before the vipers arrived.  Of
course I succeeded and was awarded the Golden Spike.

A question to all those who claim that their targets never arrive:
Do you use time speed?

If you do, you won't see them.  My target left the planet-side base, saw me
and fled back to the planet.  If I had been time speeding I would never have
even seen the ship.

I think your right, but a tractor beam with such a great power?
And another question:

    This is an important and useful feature, not a bug! I reckon the
    base or port must have some sort of tractor beam that assists in

Yes, I have it for the Atari, running on my TT030/8.

What can I say.. it looks just like the Amiga version but with naffer
sound.. but who cares, i didn't buy the game for the sound quality!

It runs from the Hard Drive too.. with makes quite a change for an Atari
game, most assume things about the hardware, take the machine over and die.

On the whole, from reading here, it seems to have a few of the bugs mentioned.

(1) The bulletin board bug.
(2) Saved commanders which crash the machine. (Namely the sample BATTLE
	commander will crash the machine directly after you die, giving a
	number (10-ish) bombs on the screen, the music continues to play.)

I've only had the game since tuesday, so I've not had much time to find more
of the bugs. I don't really care, the bugs are merely a slight niggle.

Have you ever tried writing such a large complex program without at least
SOME bugs?

I was getting badly shot up and two other ships came and enaged my attacker.
They blew him up, but he got one of them, then the other one attecked
me.  It was a an easy kill, but this saved me from going back to a saved
position.

I've got Smuggling illegal goods in all systems, Attempted bribery in the
Federation, Piracy & Murder in Imperial and Interpol, and illegal use of
laser somewhere as well.  I get about 30% no-show rate, although I haven't
done all that many assasinations yet.
I'm not ashamed to have a murder record in the Imperial systems - they
deserve to die!  Any of you Imperial bounty hunters out there want to
try your luck you're quite welcome!

Oh, well. Then I have the Amiga version on my 386 PC :-)) I remember
a file on my HD named Frontier.exe with about 600K and some save-files
in a subdirectory. I think, the manual says, you can play it from the
disks. Cannot check, sorry (not at home at the moment).
And I have to say, that the game isn't THAT FAST on my comp (386DX 25MHz
with 4M RAM and CoProc). Maybe it is my slow VGA Card. I have to reduce
details to low in the setup for a playable speed, especially with more
than 2 ships and a spacestation on the screen. 20+ police ships flying
around makes the computer jump instead of scroll the view.

Patric

(Sorry no ranks, I just started to play. Got the game for 3 days now.)
But I got a Viper now and I'm on my way to the galaxy....
Look out Federation, here I come!

It's not just the graphicscard :(
My PC (386/387 DX 25MHz, 8MB) is also very slow (even with lowest details)...
At university we installed Frontier on to PC's different only in speed
(33/40 MHz) on the faster one, Frontier is MUCH faster!
And, on our opinion, better playable (better mouse-reactions) ....

	I have Frontier and think that it's a brilliant game, although it would
have been even better with all the bugs removed :-). However, I am getting
tired of going to read c.s.a.g and finding that virtually all the bloody 
articles are on Frontier! A Frontier newsgroup is desperately needed to take 
away this huge amount of traffic to c.s.a.g, it may not be wanted by everybody
but it is certainly (IMHO) needed. Otherwise I peridict that alot of people
will give up reading c.s.a.g because they are tired with it being all about
Frontier! Anyone who feels the same way as me, or has an opposing opinion,
please post here and maybe we can sort this out.

Please do remember to turn down the time acceleration as you approace your 
destination. The first time I tried a manual approach (one of jupiters moons),
the moon keept evading me. First I thought it was because of my relative speed,
but then I discovered that I had max time acceleration. In fact, I had been
chasing the moon around jupiter for almost a week ;)

I've seen my targets crash into planets as well after firing missiles
at them. But, like you, I've been told I failed the mission, and wondered
whether the target had really crashed or whether it had somehow evaded me by
landing somewhere (and the explosion I saw was just the missile blowing up).

Quickie: this rumored cd32 version of Frontier, will it be AGA/020 enhanced
or just the "normal" version stuck on a CD?

 Help me!

  Scenario- new user of Frontier.
            Made it to barnards star and back (Discovered autopilot when
targeting pirates and learned not to use stardreamer on max setting
 - Pirates kept showing up immeadeatly). I finally was allowed to land at 
station on Merlin (I had to wait a couple of days for someone to leave).
            Went to refuel, took off, tried to hyperdrive back to barnards
star and guess what! It didn't refuel! I landed again tried refueling and
it keeps telling me I'm refueling and fully refueled! 
	    I know there was a workaround for this posted to usenet, but since
Frontier didn't hit my dealers shelves till last week, I missed it.....
(at least I got V1.05)
            Is there a bug list with workarounds available?
	    Better yet does anyone know if a bug patch from Gametek/Braben
            will be available at some point? (Hopefully we won't have to wait 
            for the expansion disks to become available)
	    Anyone know what that small purple dot circleing merlin is? 
            What time it is? :')

I would like to se something like

to be able to join the PC and the Amiga worlds on neutral ground, so to speak...
(Don't jump on me! I like both the Amiga and the PC but I run Frontier on my PC.)

Has anyone experienced problems with military drives in Frontier?  I`ve
repeatedly tried to put military drives in Cobras, Constrictors, etc, but
whenever I try to launch, whether from a planet or a station, my ship "gets
stuck" at the end of the launc sequence.  Is it a bug, or have I just got a duff
copy????  Please enlighten me.

Braben must've hit his head real hard if he really said the above. He only
has to check his own sales on respective format, and then compare to the
actual number of users to see that he's way off base... He's sold ATLEAST
30,000 copies of Frontier for the Amiga, probably much more.

Whoah, back up a minute! Are you trying to tell me that you've finished
100 assassinations and all your targets showed up? And that you don't have
any criminal record (not even smuggling)?

If so, I think we've just cracked the 'targets don't show up' problem. My
targets only show up about one out of three times, and I've got a record
longer than my arm! (including piracy and murder).

Just to clarify: I'm not talking legal status here; I'm clean everywhere,
since I pay my fines, but I _have_ broken every law conceivable in all of
the systems - and have a record to prove it.

Heh, so the targets are spooked by the appearance of a known federal
hitman in their system? Cool. Any ideas of how I can clean up my
record (or lose my rep)? Maybe I should try paying a lot of money to the
Foundation For Medical Research On Small Helpless Furry Creatures? :-)

Sadly not. I haven't been caught breaking any laws ever (well once,
but the police took the bribe - it didn't make the record!) and I have
had problems with assassinations several times, especially in the Lave
system. Most targets _do_ show up, though.

When I'm at it someone mentioned seeing a trader with damaged hull
flying around, indicating that the computer ships can attack each
other. I doubt it. More likely the disastrous auto-pilot is the
culprit - I've tracked docking ships several times and they often get
damaged more or less seriously before they make it (or crash).

It's not very good at all. I have not seen the archie version, but I HAVE
seen the C64 version, and while the gfx is better on the Amiga port, the
enemies are dumber and features are missing. Elite on the Amiga is not a
good game, atleast not in this day and age. Elite also does not make use
of faster processors, and even break under newer operating systems, so I'd
not recommend it if it wasn't dead cheap - chances are you wont be able to
play it. It does have some of that elite feeling (you DO feel good after
wasting a Thargon!) but not like the C64 version.

It might be worth getting because it's a classic, or out of sheer nostalgia,
and it _IS_ elite so it can't be all crap, but it IS a poor port of this
great game.

Frontier, on the other hand... I don't know. I have mixed feelings. It is
a great game, it has the most impressive 3D-engine I've ever seen, and the
level of detail is incredible (from accurate celestial mechanics to working
clocks on the churches!), but it is marred by the fact that it is not a
finished game (it reminds me more of a leaked beta version!).

When the bugs are fixed and there are extra data disks available, then it
will be the best game ever (especially if they hire real artists to do the
sound and bitmapped gfx!). As it is, it is pretty and an impressive
programming feat, but it lacks the staying power of Elite. It is good for a
few weeks of playing, but I wont be playing it a year from now (as I did
with Elite... From time to time I returned to Lave to take my aggressions
out on some poor unfortunate spacepirates).
It's a great game, but it's not the earth shattering game it could have
been.

    I've accepted an Imperial contract to kill a senator who is
    travelling from one planet in a system to another. I can kill the
    guy easily enough, but I always get fined for Piracy and Murder.

    I was hoping that once I was out of "docking clearance" range of
    the origin port I could finish the senator's ship off in peace, so
    I trailed it, using F4 to check my range from the origin port.
    Shortly after the "docking clearance" message stopped appearing, I
    attacked, and still got the fine.

    Is there any way to carry out an intra-system mission without
    getting hit for P&M?

Hi,

The most serious patch would be to work with DRDOS 6, at the moment I
playing Frontier on my sister's machine, but it won't look at mine,
624K Conventional
6.5 Mb EMS.

I've spoken to GAMETEK, in Bath (UK) and they said there would be DRDOS
version, but I've heard nothing since. One useful gem out of this
conversation was there wouldn't be any patches on USENET, you have send
your disks back. I don't know how this applies in the US, but that is
the situation here.

OK, yesterday I encountered a Panther Clipper with *44* *SHIELDS*!
I _couldn't_ take it out with 4MW beam; a good long hit brought it down to
33 shields, but before I could get it into my sights again, it was back
up to 44! I had to reload and equip myself with a 30MW mining laser, and
even then it absorbed several hits before taking damage to the hull.

This panther fired 5-6 missiles at me, it had a 100MW beam laser, and 
offcourseenergy bomb... One of my more enjoyable missions. It the pilot had 
been able
to aim well enough to hit the broadside of a planet, it'd have gotten _REAL_
challenging... He nicked me once, removing four shields and 50% of my hull!

I *think* the latest version is 1.1, but I might be wrong. I'm afraid
there's still quite a number of bugs in your version. Still, it's a great
game, and I think you'll be quite satisfied.

Flying: Slowly. If you go too fast, you'll smash into the planet since you
can't brake fast enough. Remember to lower your gear and request permission
to land.

Money: one easy non-cheating way is to transport robots and luxuries between
Sol and Barnards star. It'll get you started.

Do you want something better than all the bug fixes you can imagine?
Better even than all the improvements to the program, all the sequels you
can ever write?

Make Frontier multi-player and make it running on a mainframe system!
Now, that would be something!

It also might be because when you upgrade a craft/engine you may have
to perform repairs on items like the thrusters at 100 credits each.

well, i looked into my elite program (bought at WOC Toronto) and it is
version 1.05, but there are still the same "bugs" in it.. the bulletin
board bug, and the hard-drive save bug, but that may be an AGA problem,
or an IDE problem possibly...  if you mail ME then i will be able to get
back to you much easier than if you want me to mail you....

i do have some questions on Frontier as well though..  I purposelly
didn't read this group until after I played the game a bit and had more
of an understanding...  

Firstly, how long have most of you been playing this game so that you
can get these ungodly amts of money/ships/etc..  i have been playing for
about a week and a half and just recently got to Average..  I also am
not affiliated with either the Empire or the Federation..  

Secondly, i saw a post yesterday that said there are Worm-holes, I.E.
places where the universe wraps on itself so that you can travel a lot
further on 1 tank of gas...  i still have an Eagle MK fighter and it
just seems that to have any ship worth getting above it is like hundreds
of thousands of dollars..  

Thirdly, when you sell your ship, is it worth more to sell in parts or
just to sell it in one big thing, i.e. will i get the same amt of money
on a trade in if the ship is bare or will i get more if i sell it with
equipment on it, and is there a difference in the total amt you get from
selling in parts or selling as a whole...

Lastly, the elite combat rating, is that based on total kills regardless
of how well you did in the individual battles or does it take the amt of
shots you make and the percentage of hits into account...

any response is appreciated...

Private Ace Deth, average, and poor...

I just started playing Frontier and I need some help getting ahead in this
game.  I've read the hints and I'm starting to build up some money, but it
seems to be taking forever.  I've been trading between Sol and Barnard for
a while now, but the only improvement I've been able to afford is a
Military Drive.  At this rate, I'll be an old man before I get a better
ship.

I don't want any cheats.  I just want some tips on how I build up money
quickly.  Trading Robots and Luxury Goods gives a decent profit, but not
enough.  All the missions that offer decent money involve either delivering
packages to places I can't get to right now or transporting more passengers
than I can fit in my ship.

Also, can someone tell me how to land on a planet?  I tried landing on Earth
several times last night, but I always seem to blow up for no reason.

I'd appreciate email; I don't always get a chance to read USENET.

Thanks!
Rich

>SOME bugs?

Well, I have been reading the occasional Frontier post (I'm mostly avoiding
them because I have to save my money right now anyway and don't have Frontier),
and I must admit to being shocked.  Sure, any large program will have bugs, 
that's humanity for you, but not doing proper beta-testing is another question
entirely.

If Frontier was being beta-tested and had these bugs that would be fine, but
I would feel extremely angry if I forked over my money for yet another game and
found it to be what I would dub a beta version.  I'm not in the loop but it does
sound to me like it was not properly beta-tested before release.

Only once have I seen a game that was released as buggy as this, and that was
Wayne Gretzky Hockey and the Hockey League Simulator.  Both programs I would
advise my friends against purchasing and encourage my enemies to get 
immediately.

Hi Greg,
	I think if you give it some time, this problem will die down.  We've
been waiting for Elite II for a LONG time, and it turns out to be almost
everything we've expected.  I agree, it gets old, but you never know when some
of the info will be useful.  If it keeps up into late January or February, then
I agree that it might be a good idea for a Frontier newsgroup.

	Hello, I just saw Frontier at my local dealership and asked if
this was the NTC version or the PAL version?
He stated that there would be no NTSC version and the PAL version should
be ok.  Is this correct?  How playable is the PAL version (in terms
of truncation, speed, etc.)?  Will there be a NTSC version later?

Thanks in advance,

I pretty much keep my Amiga in PAL anyway, so I can't really verify 
whether or not this program runs in PAL.  If you have a commodore monitor
it is pretty easy to adjust the vertical height knob to get the whole
screen.  The bottom of the screen is filled with controls, so without 
being able to see them the game would be pretty useless.  There isn't 
any difference in computer speed between PAL and NTSC unless you count
the fact that more pixels on the screen means that more need to be drawn
for each frame.

I don't know I've been to every planet deploying my MB4 mining machine, and
every time I get message either it's too cold, to hot, nothing to mine, or
I just get water, and sometimes I get attacked and fined for mining. So far
I've figured out that below 0C, I'll get water, above 200C, it's too hot.
A planet with a name i.e. Jacks's World or Jack's Rock is already mined out.
A planet with a base or an orbiting station, I'll get fined and/or attacked.
But so far I haven't found a planet were I can mine minerals, alloys, precious
metals or Gem stones. (is it possible to mine any of these?)

Also one time I mined something like over a million tons of water, but when
I looked in my cargo bay I only had 5 tons, even though I had 30 more tons
available. Is this another bug?

Thanks.

I sure hope it will be a enhanced/sped-up version, but I don't think it's
a rumour anymore: I was talking to a developer who was testing out the
latest CD32 demo disk and he said that it had a Frontier Demo on it...
(unless he was making a joke).

Well, as for the PC version being "more stable", I've looked at it on a
friends machine (no idea which version of Frontier it was), and here's some
stuff no one has complained about on the Amiga..

Doing the Barnards star to Earth run.  Tried to strip down the ship, sold
everything but the laser and the auto pilot.  Tried to sell the laser and
was told "you have no 1M pulse laser to sell".  Strange really, it's there
in the ship configuration screen.  And I can fire at things..  Maybe the
starbase techs couldn't find it?

Had a LARGE ship with lots of crew and everything that a technophile could
want.  Tried to do a rough landing on a planet some 900ly from earth for the
purposes of mining the **** out of it.  No can do.  Everytime I got close to
the planet my ship "vanished" and I was left sitting in the escape capsule
lokking very foolish and wondering when "man friday" would turn up.  The
only solution was to sell the escape capule, then I could land as I wished. 
Maybe my landing style is a little too scary for the ejection system to
handle?

And of course, QEMM keeps aborting the program complaining about exception
errors.  No big deal really, you get used to that sort of thing when memory
managers are involved.  Does make a long game session rather difficult
though.

Can't say the texture mapping impressed me much either.  Though being able
to play on highest detail without any noticable slowdown was nice.  (Sigh.. 
Wait till I can afford a 4000, that's all I can say ;-)

BTW, this IS NOT meant to be a "IBM flame" note.  Just stating what I saw. 
On the whole I'd say the IBM version I saw was just a little buggier than
the Amiga version.  Mind you, the load/save game menu DOES default to the
frontier directory, and you can exit without patches.  Hey, maybe these bugs
are already fixed, and my friend has an old old copy?  Yeah that must be it
:-)

Well, I was just getting a bit tired with flying boring message
missions and doing the occational very irritating and time-wasting (not
to mention potentially disasterous if they didnt turn up) assassination
missions and then the photograph missions appeared. I have to say its
breathed a whole new life into the game which was going the original
elite way (i.e. get to dangerous or deadly and there was no
interest/challenge left (except doing thargoid invasions with a pulse
laser!)).

Wow, so many ships attacking at once. Pity they are all so small
(lightweight ones).

Does anyone know:
(a) Roughly what distance you need to photograph from? I did it quite
close but I wasnt sure of the distance.
(b) How good a "kill" is of the defence craft? i.e. are they good for
boosting your elite rating or are they like police vipers which do
nothing(?)?
(c) Whats the fastest way of getting near to the bases? I got to the

the fighters got launched and I couldnt use my time streamer anymore

    Imperial bases launch also Couriers, they are a bit more challenging.
    I'm flying Cobra MKI with no shields and 1MW beam laser - one
    hit and I'm gone;-)  Anyway, I like that configuration, I can make

    It looks like the limit is 80 km.  I usually take pictures and

    after distance in less than 80 km.  If you fly really close 
    (between the towers), you'll get excellent pictures.  I got Vermillion

    I use the following method:
    - Autopilot + max compression to arrive to "vicinity of planet"
    - 3-4 compression and 50 000 km/h, fly to 7000-8000 km distance
    - Orbit the planet (outside view for easier target searching)
    - Lock on target when it is in horizon
    - 10 000 km/h and 2-3 compression until distance is 500 km
    - Approach in 30 000 m altitude, accelerating to 40 000 km and 
      fly over the base, I usually take photos and engage hyperdrive 
      before enemies can fire at me.

    I got promoted to colonel yesterday and after that I've completed 17

    I would expect new type of missions for each rank, but I don't know
    for sure.  Any lieutenants, viscounts or higher out there?

Hmmm... you must be real inept ;-)
I encountered a panther with 56 shields and I didn't have an icecubes chance
in hell with my 1MW beam.  However when I reloaded and tried with a 4MW
beam I didn't have a single problem.

I bought the game at WOCA a couple of weeks ago, and it looks NTSC to me...
Meaning my monitor doesn't flicker (no switch to PAL), nor do I lose any
pixels (graphics stop b4 the bottom of the screen).  It doesn't say on the
box whether it's NTSC or PAL, I don't think (I don't have th box at work
with me... :) ).  Perhaps your dealer hasn't tried it yet?  My local dealer
will usually let you try a game if you suspect there might be incompatabilities
(meaning load it onto one of their machines and try it there).

I'm _playing_ the NTSC version, so I guess they came out with it after all.
Ask your dealer to check again (or change dealers...).  You'll be glad you
did :-)

  Thanks for the reply's on my refueling problem.
  As it turns out, I had taken damage to my hull - this is what had kept me
  from Hyperspacing.

    In the mean time I've moved up through the ships quite nicely...
  I went from Eagle 2, Eagle 3, Cobra mk 1, Cobra mk 2, Cobra mk 3 to an 
  Asp Explorer ( I really liked this ship) and have recently purchased an
  Imperial Courier.
    Now for the big disappointment.
    In the Asp I had class 3 military drive that was giving me around a 12
  lightyear capacity. When I bought the Courier, it came with a class 5 hyper
  drive that's limited to 10.5 light year range. I wanted to trade it for a 
  class 3, and was told .... "Drive is an integral part of the ship".
    Does this mean I can't upgrade it ever?
  (I don't want to give up my 20mgw beam laser and go back to the asp!)  

  								Ed

 Imperial Courier, Competent, Independent Opportunist.

According to my HEX editor , i've got Frontier V1.05. My question is
exactly what bugs are fixed in this version? The bulletin board bug is
still there and so is the 'radar map your own arrival cloud' one. The only
one that I can see is the flickering of the 'space clouds' but then I play
with that option turned off.


I hope someone can enlighten me.

I bought the game at the WoC in Cologne some time ago.
I have upgraded my old A500 with a new Agnus, now I can switch my
Amiga from PAL to NTSC very easy before I boot up.
My Version of Fontier (german) runs in PAL and NTSC without problems,
it autodetects, which resolution it has to choose.
I heard even, that it should run on some old graphic cards, but don't
ask me details.
I think it will surely run on PAL and NTSC Amigas.

 Dear frontier users, 
 my friend and I have just come to the point of deciding whether to side
for the empire or the federation. At the moment none of us fancies the
idea of becoming an "indipendent opportunist", however we are currently
debating if there are any eventual advantages/disadvantages of siding with
one side or the other. Any advice will be particularly welcome. Just to
avoid any flaming let me state that at the moment we have decided that one
of us (not me for sure!!!!!) will side for the (particularly spiteful)
empire while the other for the commendable and morally superior FEDERATION.
Bye and hot jets to everybody.
