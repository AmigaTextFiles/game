                     ABC'S WIDE WORLD OF SPORTS BOXING

IMPORTANT
---------

Please read these important additions to the Amiga version of ABC's 
Wide World of Sports Boxing not included in the Boxer's Notebook or
Game Manual.

System Requirements:

Amiga 500, 1000, 2000
1MB RAM.  Color Monitor Required
Joystick Required

Note: This software has been tested using AmigaDOS 1.3.  A3000 or 2.0
upgrade owners may want to test gameplay under DOS 2.0 or use 1.3 to
ensure compatibility.

To Play from Floppy:

Booting from Floppy:  At the Amiga Workbench prompt, insert the Punch
disk in drive DF0: (A1000 owners may need to run Kickstart first).  When
the computer has booted, the game will automatically start.  You will
be prompted to insert the Ring disk as needed.

Hard Disk Installation:

To install the game onto a hard disk, follow these instructions:

1. Boot your hard drive normally and go to the Workbench.
2. Insert the disk labelled Ring disk into any drive.
3. Double click on the Ring Disk icon.
4. In the disk's open window, double click on the icon named "HDInstall".
5. You will be prompted to designate the hard drive partition and folder
   name that you wish the game's files to be copied into.  Make sure to
   type your designation in quotes.  Example "DH0:Boxing".
6. The contents of the Ring disk will be transferred to your hard drive.
7. When prompted insert the Punch disk into any drive.
8. When the contents of the Punch disk have been successfully transferred
   to your hard drive you will receive an "Installation Complete" message.

To play ABC's Wide World of Sports Boxing from a hard drive:

1. Remove any Boxing diskettes, if any.
2. Boot your hard drive normally and go to the Workbench.
3. Go to the drawer in which you copied your Boxing files and open it.
4. Double-click on the icon named "Boxing".  The game will start.

You can also start the game from the CLI by first changing to the sub-
directory where you've copied your Boxing files and then type "Boxing".

Memory Requirements for Hard Disk Users:

ABC's Wide World of Sports Boxing requires at least 1 Megabyte of total
memory and at least 430K of the Amiga's built-in-graphics memory (chip
ram) to run.  If your Amiga has 512K of chip ram (such as an A1000, A500
or A2000 without the 1 Meg. "Agnus" chip) you may have to play ABC's 
Wide World of Sports Boxing by booting directly from the Punch disk.
You can check how much "chip" memory you have in your computer by opening
the CLI and typing AVAIL.  Look next to the word "CHIP" under the
"AVAILABLE" column for the amount of chip memory you have free.  If the
number is greater than 430,000 you will have enough memory to run the
game.  If not, you will need to boot from the Punch disk.

Tips to Maximize Free Chip Ram.

Make sure that your STARTUP-SEQUENCE script loads only the files needed
for hard-disk operation (no programs such as virus checkers, RAM disks,
or multitasking applications).

Make sure that all open Workbench windows are closed.

* Disconnect any external disk drives that may be connected.

* Important!  Never connect or disconnect peripherals such as disk drives
or printers when your Amiga is on!  Doing so may seriously damage your
Amiga or any other peripherals.

MAIN MENU

WATCH OUT FOR KILLER MODE!!!

Following the game intro screens, you will see the following selections
on the Main Menu.

EXHIBITION

Exhibition lets you fight against the computer or against another human-
controlled boxer in an exhibition fight.  This is the fastest and the
quickest way into ABC's Wide World of Sports Boxing, so if you're anxious
to climb into the ring right away.  SELECT Exhibition and move ahead to 
the Exhibition Menu section of this Notebook.  Exhibition fighting is also
a great way to practice power punches and distance of punches.

CAREER

This selection takes you into the sports-role-playing level of ABC's Wide 
World of Sports Boxing.  The intricate detail of this gaming level is quite
involved and requires a more extensive explanation than found in the
Boxer's Notebook.  Starting a career lets you create your own boxer and
guide him from the bottom of the rankings all the way to the championship
belt - if you're able to get him there. 

DEMO

This selection will automatically load a demonstration match between two
randomly chosen computer-controlled opponents.

QUIT

SELECT QUIT to exit ABC's Wide World of Sports Boxing and return to DOS.

THE JAB/STRAIGHT PUNCH IS FASTER THAN OTHER PUNCHES, USE YOUR JABS TO
SET UP YOUR OPPONENT FOR A SLOWER, STRONGER PUNCH. 

THROW POWER PUNCHES - THEY ARE MORE EFFECTIVE AND IF YOU LAND ONE,
YOU MAY GO INTO KILLER MODE.

EXHIBITIONS OPTIONS MENU

KEEP YOUR EYE ON YOUR STAMINA, IF IT STARTS GETTING TOO LOW, REST BY 
CLINCHING WITH YOUR OPPONENT AND THROWING FEWER PUNCHES. 

SELECT from the following options on this menu:

FIGHT

SELECT Fight to get immediately into the action.  This selection will take
you to the Fight Mode Menu, where you will SELECT between a Human vs. 
Human, Human vs. Computer, or Computer vs. Computer fight.  You will then
move on to the Exhibition Boxers Screen. 

KEEP YOUR HEAD MOVING!

At the Exhibition Boxers Screen you will SELECT a boxer for Player 1 and
another for Player 2.  You can choose from among 10 Sparring Partners 
and 10 Specialists.  You can also create 10 Open Exhibitioners.  (Creating
a boxer fully in the Career Guide.)

Once you choose two boxers for your exhibition match, you'll go directly 
to the fight.  See In the Ring Section of this Notebook to learn how to
fight.

IF YOU HAVE MONEY, BUY EQUIPMENT, THE MORE EXPENSIVE ITEMS ARE WAY
COOLER THAN THE CHEAP STUFF.

IF YOU HEAD OR BODY KNOCKDOWN GAUGES GO COMPLETELY BLACK - YOU'RE HISTORY!

VIEW STATS

This option takes you to the Exhibition Boxers Screen - when you SELECT
one of the boxers here, you will get a look at the fighter's dossier
and personal statistics.  (A Full interpretation of all this data is
explained in the Career Guide.)  To return to the Exhibition Boxers
Screen, press either BUTTON 1 or 2.  You can then either SELECT another
boxer to view or SELECT Exit to return to the Exhibition Options Menu.

CREATE BOXER

This selection allows you to create a new boxer for the Open Exhibitioners
list.  Press the ESC key on your keyboard to abort the boxer creation
process and return to the Exhibition Options Menu.

   Note: Creating a new boxer requires a basic understanding of the
process detailed in the Creating a New Boxer section of the Career Guide.

P.S.: Boxers created with this option can only fight Exhibition matches.
For a shot at the title you must start a career.  See "Starting a Career"
in the Career Guide.

DELETE BOXER

To make room for new boxers on the Open Exhibitioners list, SELECT Delete
Boxer.  SELECT the boxer you wish to remove from the Exhibition Boxers 
Screen. 

   Note: Specialists and Sparring Partners are permanent; you can only 
delete boxers you've created.

This selection will take you back to the ABC's Wide World of Sports Boxing
Main Menu.
 
IN THE RING

RULES OF THE RING

o In Exhibition mode you can select the number of rounds, 1 through 12.
  In career fights, the number of rounds depends upon your boxer's ranking.

o The rounds are clocked 3 minutes.

o There is a 10-point MUST system.  (Judges award 10 points to the winner
  of a round, and fewer to the loser.)

o 3 knockdowns in one round is a technical knockout.

o Depending on the referee, 3 or 4 cuts stop the fight.

o A boxer has until the count of 10 to get up after a knockdown.  A boxer
  who is knocked-down cannot be saved by the bell.

IF YOUR BOXER IS RIGHT-HANDED, PUNCHES THROWN WITH HIS LEFT HAND HAVE
MORE RANGE THAN PUNCHES THROWN WITH HIS RIGHT HAND.  OPPOSITE FOR
SOUTHPAWS.

BOXERS ARE NOT EQUAL IN THEIR CHARACTERISTICS; HOW FAST YOUR KNOCKDOWN
GAUGES GO DOWN DEPENDS ON YOUR RATINGS AND YOUR OPPONENT'S POWER.

SLUGGING IT OUT

JUDGES FAVOR HOOKS, CROSSES AND UPPERCUTS.
   
o Once your opponent comes into punching range, the view will change from
  top-down to up-close and personal.

o Joystick LEFT and RIGHT moves your boxer either away from or toward your
  opponent.

o Joystick UP and DOWN controls whether your fighter stands up or crouches
  down.  A punch thrown while standing will be directed toward your 
  opponent's head and one thrown from a crouch will go to his body.

- WAIT FOR YOUR OPPONENT TO THROW A PUNCH - THEN COUNTER.

The diagram below shows all the punches you can throw by pressing Action
Buttons 1 and 2 and moving the Joystick:

Button    Joystick   Right Hander      Left Hander    

1         LEFT       Left Jab          Left Straight     
1         RIGHT      Right Straight    Right Jab         
2         LEFT       Left Hook         Left Cross        
2         RIGHT      Right Cross       Right Hook        
1 & 2     LEFT       Left Uppercut     Left Uppercut     
1 & 2     RIGHT      Right Uppercut    Right Uppercut    

THROWING POWER PUNCHES

Along with basic individual punches, you can throw power punches.  The 
steps to throwing a power punch are:

1. Press the button(s) and joystick to throw a normal punch.

2. While holding the button(s) from the last punch, move the joystick UP
   or DOWN to put your boxer into the desired position (standing or
   crouching).  He will then cock the arm opposite the one used in Step 1.
   Now release the button(s) and joystick.

3. Press the button(s) to throw the punch you want.

Notes: To end a power punch without throwing the second punch, simply
       release the button(s) and move the joystick LEFT or RIGHT.

Power Punches do more damage than normal punches, but your boxer is more
vulnerable when throwing one.

If you can land a good power punch, your boxer might sense his opponent is
hurt and could go into "Killer" mode which is determined by your boxer's
Killer Instinct rating indicated by the boxer's name flashing.  In Killer 
Mode, your punches have maximum impact, so go for the knockout right away.
(See example)

YOU CAN ONLY DELETE A BOXER WHICH YOU HAVE CREATED.

EXAMPLE:

A right-handed boxer is in the standing position.  Press button 2 and LEFT
to throw a left-hook to his opponent's head.  Continue to hold down button
2, move the joystick DOWN, and release the button.  He then crouches down
and cocks his right arm.  Press both buttons to throw the power punch - a 
strong uppercut with his right arm.

We strongly recommend that you practice throwing power punches in two-
player mode.  Properly used, power punches can turn a good boxer into a
great one. 

KNOCKDOWN GAUGES

4 CUTS - TKO!

At the bottom of the screen, below the fighters' names, are three Knockdown
Gauges, these will indicate how close each boxer is to being knocked-out.

Scoring in each round is more than just how much damage has been done.
(Scoring is discussed in the Judges section of the career guide.)
 
1. STAMINA

Stamina is worn away every time you get hit and every time you throw a
punch, especially when you miss.  You can replenish Stamina by avoiding
contact.  Stamina is also restored significantly between rounds -
amounts vary by boxer, depending on his Conditioning rating.


2. HEAD

Punches that land to your head will reduce your Knockdown Head Gauge.
Levels on this gauge are restored only between rounds, again based on
Conditioning.

GET YOUR SHOULDER INTO THE PUNCH!

3. BODY

The Knockdown Body Gauge operates exactly like the Knockdown Head Gauge.

KNOCKDOWNS

As your Knockdown Gauges are worn away during a fight, you may run the 
risk of getting knocked down.  When you go down, it's not always "for the 
count."  You can encourage your boxer to get up by pressing BUTTON 1 while 
the referee is counting.  The longer you wait to get up, the more Stamina 
you'll regain.  Naturally, if the ref hits "10" before you've regained 
your senses... it's all over.

ANTICIPATE THE OTHER BOXER AND THROW PUNCHES TO WHERE YOU THINK HE WILL BE.
REMEMBER, TIMING CHANGES BASED ON HANDSPEED.

BEFORE ENTERING A BOUT, ALWAYS CONSULT YOUR TRAINER FOR NEXT FIGHT
STRATEGY, THE BETTER YOUR TRAINER, THE MORE INFORMATION YOU'LL GET ABOUT
YOUR OPPONENT.

* DURING THE RING ANNOUNCER'S SPEECH, NOTE WHO IS THE "HOMETOWN" BOXER
  SINCE SOME JUDGES WILL FAVOR THIS BOXER SLIGHTLY. 

SURVIVAL TIPS

For practice, choose Human vs. Human mode.  Since there will be no one
controlling your opponent, he won't move.  In this condition, he makes
an excellent practice dummy.

To Learn the controls, fight a human vs. human exhibition match.  Move
the boxers closer until you see the side view.  Practice each punch and
some power punches.  Move the second boxer into position and get a feel
for range and sounds.  Note: In order to select a boxer for Player 2,
you will need to set up the configuration for Player 2 in the Install
Program.

To throw a punch hold down the Button (S) and press the joystick LEFT or
RIGHT.  Don't pound on the buttons, but learn to press and release them
evenly as you plan your punches.

Each punch has a different range.  Practice using punch ranges to hit
your opponent as he moves in and out.  Following are punches in order of
longest to shortest range for a right-handed boxer: Left Jab, Right
Straight, Left Hook, Right Cross, Left Uppercut, Right Uppercut.
  
After creating your boxer in New Career, fight a few Exhibition matches.
This will help you get used to the range and speed of your boxer.

Before deciding on an opponent, check out your opponent's stats by looking
in the Magazine.  Note how he has won and lost his fights (i.e. KOs or
points).  Also take note of his trainer since each trainer adds points to
two of the boxer's ratings.

When moving on to next month's fight, watch the videos of computer vs.
computer fights of boxers near your ranking; you will probably end up
fighting one of these boxers so scout them out first.

When in Training Camp, don't hesitate to fight an exhibition match.
These bouts won't affect your ratings.

You can change trainers according to your boxing style.  You should hire
trainers that will work with you on ratings you wish to improve.

Hitting an opponent in the body reduces his stamina more than hitting his
head with the same type of punch, but landing one to the head might cause
a cut or a quick knockdown.

If any of your knockdown gauges get low, go into defensive mode: back away
from your opponent, mimic his stance so he can't land a punch, or move in
and get into a clinch.
