     *****************  SOLVE FOR VEIL OF DARKNESS  ***********************

     Ok, the solve will work this way: I shall try to deal with each heading
     in the prophecy which you will receive from Kiril, in the house
     where you start off.

     Also, make sure to talk to the people in the bar often.  They will
     reveal new locations.  Also, always keep a lot of silver pieces
     around.  You can earn money by selling herbs and by finding it.
     As well, I have found no apparent advantages to killing creatures,
     rather then avoiding them.  However, some must be killed
     ( werewolf, skeletons in the fortress, zombie Andrei ).
     Vampires can be killed with holy water, and some creatures can only be
     harmed by a torch or a rowan staff.

     "From the ever dark sky shall he descend in a bird of steel"
     "Salvation for those who have been unrightously damned"

     These two parts of the prophecy become automatically done as you speak
     to Kiril.  He will quest you for a carpenters hammer.
     Talk to his daughter again ( you speak to her first as soon as you
     wake up ).  She will give you a ribbon.  You will need it later!
     Go to Kiril, ask him for "PIPE".
     Ask his servant, Ivan for "COINS" and he will give you a pouch with 12
     silver pieces.

     "He shall deny the part he is destined to play"
     "Until he find the bloodied tool most foul"

     Go around the village, talk to the people.  Make sure you go to the
     apothecary and buy the FENNEL SEEDS for 1 silver coin.  You will need
     them.

     He will give you a match.
     Go to the house between the store and apothecary, pick up the prybar.
     Go to the store, and ask for a "LAMP" and he will offer you an oil lamp.
     Also you will need to buy "TOBACCO" and "NAILS".
     Buy it!
     Go to the ruined house at the edge of the town.  Find the trail of
     blood.  Push the bookcase where the bloody trail ends to the left.
     Go through the secret door, get the bloody hammer, and the torn
     shirt fragment.
     Return to Kiril.  He will tell you some things, and the two prophecy
     parts will become solved.  He will also give you the prophecy.
