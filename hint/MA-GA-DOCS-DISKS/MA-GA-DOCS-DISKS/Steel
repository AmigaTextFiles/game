Steel, another crap game, this time from HEWSON...

OBJECT OF THE GAME
------------------

To collect 8 cartriges around the complex and activate the cartriges slots by
More (Y/N/NS)? 
[1Ade-activating the 8 active terminals,allowing the cartriges to be inserted into
the cartriges slots. The 8 cartriges slots are all located in one room 
somewhere in the complex. When your droid is near to the cartrige room you are
warned by the proximity alert in the centre of the score panel.


THE SUB-GAME
------------

To enter the sub-game, push the joystick up at an active terminal (indicated by
a yellow light). Once in the terminal, the object is to shoot the data-bus on
the right hand side of the screen a set time limit. This is made difficult by
rotating drivers in front of the bus. The drivers must be shot away by
continuous laser fire. Also, the prieces fried from the drivers must be avoided
as they deplete the timer in the top left of the screen. As well as the pieces
of the drivers flying towards you, occasionally icons will appear. There are
four of these icons, and to use one, simply let float into your cannon. The
coloured icon with an "R" on it will enable rapid fire if collected. The
metallic looking "S" icon will slow up your cannon for 5 seconds, leaving you
vulnerable to the flying debris from the drivers. The coloured, "D"-shaped icon
More (Y/N/NS)? 
[1Awill decrease the timer by 10 seconds, resulting in you having less time to
destroy the bus, and the last icon, a metallic bullet shaped object, will
increase the timer by 10 seconds.

If you fail to complete the sub-game, your droid loses someof his energy
supply. Each you complete the sub-game, a cartrige slot in the cartrige room is
activated. Then you find the room and insert the cartrige you have collected.
Up to three cartriges can be carried at one time (shown at the bottom left of
the panel).


CARTRIGES
---------

Cartriges are purple, and are found in housing magazines which have a red light
on the top of them.



FUEL
More (Y/N/NS)? 
[1A----

Re-fuelling can be done at re-fuelling points located randomly around the
complex. These are identified by the oscillating graph on their screens.
Pushing up on the joystick and pressing the fire button replenishes energy,
pushing down and pressing fire deplenishes it. Energy costs you score.
Warnings appear on screen when your energy gets low or too high. 


TERMINALS
---------

These resemble computer terminals, and have information scrolling on them.
If the light is yellow, it is active, if its red then its inactive.


DROIDS
------

The droids found throughout the complex different characteristics and
More (Y/N/NS)? 
[1Astrenghts. Some retreat, others continue to bump you, and some bounce off you
and fire a laser at you (WOW!!  Im scared!! -Zike!). The different types of
droid will become apparent during the game.
