Mouse/Joystick Control

	THE MOUSE BUTTONS:
	
	Clicking the right button changes the current selected weapon
	for the next available one.
	
	Clicking the left button fires the currently selected weapon.
	
	Clicking the left button with the right button held down selects
	the next designated target.
	
	
	
	WITH NO MOUSE/JOYSTICK BUTTONS PRESSED:
	
	Moving the mouse/joystick forward causes the helicopter to dip
	down allowing it to move forward.
	
	Moving the mouse/joystick backwards causes the helicopter to
	tip upwards allowing it to move backwards.
	
	At low speeds, moving the mouse/joystick left & right causes the
	helicopter to move sideways. With the mouse/joystick pushed forward
	and to the left or right, the helicopter will bank and turn in
	that direction.
	
	HOLDING THE RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON DOWN:
	
	Moving the mouse/joystick forwards with the right button pressed
	increases power to the main rotor, allowing the helicopter to
	rise.
	
	Moving the mouse/joystick backwards with the right button pressed
	decreases the power to the main rotor, allowing the helicopter to
	fall.
	
	In level flight, at low speeds, moving the mouse/joystick left and
	right with the right button pressed causes the helicopter to rotate
	around its own axis.
