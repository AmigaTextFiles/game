this  tutorial will be divided into two seperate parts:  the
first  being  a  general  outline  for solving deadline, the
second being a detailed description on how to solve it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

                       some general hints about deadline

[1] always keep in mind that you are not limited to two word
    commands, let yourself go and be creative!

[2]  you have the ability to interact with people as well as
     objects.

[3]  always  try  to  get  a  feel  for the vocabulary of an
     adventure  by  typing  words extemperaniously.  in this
     way  you  can  sometimes get the idea of the vocabulary
     needed.

                           how to solve deadline
                           ---------------------


 all  commands are in "quotes" and all directional moves are
in [brackets].

  from  the  front  path of the robner's estate proceed [n].
now  you  should  be  at  the front door of the house.  type
'open door" and then proceed [n] again.  this will place you
within  the  estate.   then  go [n,n,e,] then "climb stairs"
this will place you at the second level of the estate.  then
go  [w,w,w,w,n].   this  will place you in the library to do
your  detective  work.   first "look rug".  you will see mud
spots  (crucial for the arrest).  then "take cup and pad and
calendar  and  pencil".   now  "rub pencil on paper".  after
having   done  this,  "turn  page  on  calendar"  and  "read
calendar".   after having done this, "open balcony door" and
go [e].  this will place you on the balcony.  "look railing"
(this  will confirm our mud theory).  having done all of the
above-procede,  [s,e,e,e,e,d,d,w,s,s].   this will place you
at  the  front  door again.  now go [nw,s,s,e,s,e,se].  this
will  bring  you  to  the  shed (more detective work).  now,
"look  ladder"  (more mud again-i think it is safe to assume
that  the  murderer  used  the  ladder  to enter through the
balcony   and  then  somehow(?)  murdered  our  dear  friend
mr.robner).   now this having been done, return to the front
door.   [nw,w,n,w,n,n,se].   now we have to trek all the way
upstairs  again!.   go  [n,n,e,u,u,n,n] you should now be in
dunbar"s  bathroom.   type  "look lobo" (interesting, heh?).
now  go all the way downstairs again.  [s,s,s,d,d,w,s,s] you
will  be at the front door again.  now you have time to take
a  rest.   type  "wait till 11:30".  it should now be 11:31.
now  we  have  to  hunt  down  mr.mcnabb.  go to the orchard
[e,ne,n].   (note:   due  to  the nature of deadline, mcnabb
might  not  be  there.   if  he is not, hunt him down!  - it
doesn"t  matter  where  you find him).  once mcnabb has been
located  say  "hey  mcnabb"/cr/ "what is wrong".  after this
follow  him.  he will then point out to you two holes in his
rose  garden.   you  then say "look holes" (more mud theory)
and  then  "dig  ground".  then with your new found treasure
type "analyze fragment for loblo".  now we have to catch the
will  reading.   go  [n,n,se,s,sw,w,s].   you will be at the
front door once again.  now go [n,n,w] and wait for the will
to  be  read.  after that say "hey george".  then type "show
george  the  calendar".   he  will  panic  and run upstairs.
follow  him!!   he  then  will duck into his room and you go
[w,w,n,n].   this  will  place you in the library"s balcony.
now  type  "wait  10 min".  once george enters the room wait
for  about  2  min  and  then  [s],  "look bookcase", "press
button",  "get  will",  "look  safe",  "get  papers",  "read
papers" then go to the living room [s,s,e,e,e,e,d,d,e,e] and
say  "hey  baxter",  "what  about  focus",  "show  focus  to
baxter",  "hey  dunbar",  "show  focus  papers", "what about
focus".  then follow dunbar closely.  once outside the house
she  will  drop a piece of paper.  "get paper", "read paper"
then  continue  following  her.   once you catch up, ask her
"hey  dunbar", "show paper to dunbar".  then make tracks for
the  shed.   [e,e,se].   wait  for  baxter.  once dunbar and
baxter are present type "arrest baxter and dunbar"
