Not having seen the movie, the following storyline is from a review in Crash.
The Navy SEALs are a special commando unit of the US Navy. One of their
helicopters has been shot down over the Gulf and the pilots captured by a bunch
of Arab nutters (Iraqis of course). A team of five Navy SEALs storm their HQ
to rescue their chums and destroy the Arab's collection of lethal Stinger
missiles.
You start in Oman harbour, sneaking around killing Arabs and setting time
bombs on the Stinger missile crates (handily marked with the stars and stripes)
and progress through the levels to Beirut, where you rescue the hostages and
go on to destroy the massive cache of Stingers in the city.
Enjoy... it's a nice little game.
