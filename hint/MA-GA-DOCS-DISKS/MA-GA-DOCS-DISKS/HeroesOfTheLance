Heroes  of  the  Lance  is pretty easy.  There are 3 modes, and the keys are
different  for  each  mode.   The  keys you use to fight and move are on the
numeric keypad....Here's a quick doc:

Key    Mode             Description
---    ---------------- ---------------------------------------------------
 1     Close Combat     Move backwards (assuming your character faces right)
 4         "             "
 7         "             "
 3         "            Thrust Low
 6         "            Thrust
 9         "            Thrust High
 2         "            Dodge
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2     Ranged Combat    Dodge
 3         "            Fire Low
 6         "            Fire
 9         "            Fire High
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 4      Movement        Left
 7         "            Left at double speed
 6         "            Right
 9         "            Right at double speed
 8         "            In
 2         "            Out
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Insert  pops up the menu
Escape  exit menu
Return  fire button

To  select  a  different  character,  use  the  menu  option and move to the
character with the cursor keys and hit enter.  A joystick is better for this
game,  and  the moves map into the cursor keys...ie if you want to move left
in  the  Movement  mode, push the joystick to the left where the 4 key is on
the  keypad,  to move at double speed left, push the joystick to where the 7
key is, etc...  Hope this helps!
