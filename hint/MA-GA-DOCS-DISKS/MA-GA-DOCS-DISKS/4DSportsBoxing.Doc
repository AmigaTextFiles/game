QUICKPLAY
---------
Once the game has loaded,you will see the title screen and credits.Press
any key to progress to the main menu.For a brief insight into some of
the game's features,select DEMO with the cursor keys and press ENTER to
run a demonstration show-case
of 4d Sports Boxing.

THE MAIN MENU
-------------
To move around this menu and others within the game use the arrow keys
on the numeric keypad with the ENTER or RETURN key to confirm the
selection.The RETURN and ENTER key will also be referred to as FIRE in
the manual.If you are using a joystick,move the box around with the
stick and press FIRE on button 1 to confirm the selection.When the
program detects a Mouse connected to your computer system,it displays a
pointer on the screen when you need to make a selection from a menu.Move 
the pointer to the required icon and press the left hand button to
confirm your choice.The mouse cannot be used during the fight to control
the boxer.Pressing ESCape during a menu screen has the same effect as
selecting the DONE button.

Move the flashing box over the EXHIBITION option.Press ENTER to select
the HUMAN boxer that you wish to fight with.Cycle through the avaliable
boxers with NEXT and PREVIOUS buttons and move to DONE when you have
made your selection.Now select the COMPUTER boxer with the same
method.Look at the statistics at the bottom of the screen.Choose a boxer
with a similar or lower ranking to you boxer so you don't make life too
difficult.

You will now go up to the ring for the fight.You will be introducted to
the fight.You will be introduced to the fight by the host and two icons
will appear on the status panel.Press FIRE over the two gloves to start
the fight.

Study the key controls in the Reference guide section of this manual for
the various boxing moves that you can perform.For now,do all you can to
get your opponent on the canvas with stars in his eyes - forget the
strategy and have fun getting used to the control method and the way the
boxers move.

Press FIRE to ring the bell and start the fight.At the end of each round
you will see the statistics for the fight so far.Don't worry if your
performance is not exactly Championship stuff quite yet! You will
quickly learn a fighting strategie and style that is most effective in
decking your opponent,but for now just have a bit of fun.

To quit the fight at any stage during the fight press ESCape and select
the "Throw in the Towel" icon.Confirm that you really do want to quit by
selecting the Thumbs up icon.This will register a TKO against you and
end the contest.

In EXHIBITION mode the boxer's results are not recorded and do not
effect his carrer.Use this mode to "test" your own boxer or maybe try
out a friend's champ to see if he matches up to your standards.

During the EXHIBITION fight press the function key (F1 through to F8) to
see the action from different camera angles or experiment with 1st
person views with F9 and F10.You will learn later in this manual how to
move the cameras around and how to become a 4D Sports Vision movie
director.

GENERAL KEYS
------------
During the fight there are a number of keys that act as "short cuts" to
options avaliable through menus:

F1 through to F8 will access the first 8 cameras directly.
F9 and F10 select the 1st person "through the eye" camera view for each
boxer.

ESCape brings up the control menu during the fight.From here the player
can access the camera control menu,4D Sports vision video replay system
and other options.See later in the manual for information on these
options and controls.

Whilst in a control panel the ESCape key has the same effect as
selecting the DONE button.

CTRL P - Pause the game
CTRL S - Sound On/Off toggle
CTRL M - Music On/Off toggle
CTRL X - Exit and Quit to DOS.

- Note that this has the same effect as "Throwing in the towell" and
will mark against you in your career.

The "+" and "-" keys on the top right row of the main keyboard increase
and decrease the rendering level on the boxers.See the later sections
headed "Rendering" and "Frame Rate" for more information.

FIGHTING KEYS
-------------
The following shows the boxing and "showboat" moves avaliable during the
fight.The moves are the same regardless of whether they are controlled
by keyboard or joystick.See the OPTIONS menu for information on how to
select the correct controlling input device.

The boxer is capable of a wide variety of moves depending on the
situtation.For example,the "showboating" moves change depending on
whether the opponent is on his feet or not.There is also a secret move
to help bring back energy to the dangerously exhausted fighter.We think
you should find that one out for yourself.

Each of the eight directionals has three actions associated with it -
depending on whether no button is pressed (NB),Fire Button one (B1) or
Fire Button Two (B2).

                         NO BUTTON PRESSED

             MOVE LEFT     MOVE FORWARD     MOVE RIGHT

direction from the chart above for the type of punch you want to
use.Press on fire button one on its own to jab with the left hand at the
opponent.

THE MASTER PANEL
----------------
During a fight you can press ESCape to bring up the MASTER PANEL.This
allows access to the $D Sports Vision camera and video replay control
systems and other functions of the game.This menu can also be accessed
by clicking on the control icon before the fight and between each
round.There are eight icons on the MASTER PANEL.From left to right they
are:(Refer to Diagrams)

Lets look at these menu options in more detail:(Refer to diagrams)

1.THROW IN THE TOWEL -
Terminates the fight as a TKO (Technical Knock Out) against you except
if the fight hasn't started yet.This allows you to cancel a fight
without penalty - except for maybe incurring your managers wrath.

2.VIEW OPTIONS MENU -
Allows the player to set,position & adjust the 8 user definable cameras.

3.INSTANT REPLAY MENU -
This icon accesses the 4D Sports Vision replay system,allowing the
player to review the fight so far and play back portions of the action.

4.POINT OF VIEW MENU -
Allows quick selection of the viewpoint between action through the
cameras or through either of the boxers eyes.

5.RENDERING LEVEL -
Here the player selects the rendering level and playwindow size.See also
FRAME RATE.

6.STATISTICS -
This icon brings up a list of the fight stats recorded for the fight so
far and the last round in detail.

7.SYSTEM PANEL -
From here the player can save and load camera settings and control music
and sound effects.

8.DONE -
Returns you to the previous menu,or directly back to the fight if the
menu was accessed during a round.

THROW IN THE TOWEL
------------------
This permits the player to terminate a fight before it has reached its
natural conclusion.If you do this,the computer will automatically
register a Technical knockout against you.If this is done during a MAIN
EVENT fight,then this will effect your career standings.This was
included to prevent the unscrupulous boxers amongst you from winning
fights without going the full distance - no chance to take a dive here!

If the fight has not yet started,you can quit without any penalty
whatsoever.

VIEW OPTIONS
------------
Allows the player to enter the VIEW OPTIONS PANEL and manipulate the
various camera viewing systems.Once selected,there are seven icons
displayed.From left to right these are:(Refer to diagrams)

1.Step up to the next camera in the sequence.

2.Step back to the previous camera in the sequence.

3.Adjust the cameras.See also section on "Adjusting Cameras"

4.Flying/Fixed camera.This toggles between a camera that can fly around   
and track the action or is "locked off" in a set position.

5.Cameraman On/Off.This toggles between a camera that is "operated" by
an intelligent computer controlled cameraman who tracks the action
smoothly as you would see on TV or a fixed camera.

6.Crowd On/Off.This toggles between a computer generated rendered crowd
or a blank background.

Note:when this icon is selected,the camera is automatically fixed and
locked off with no cameraman that will not track the action.

7.Control Room.This icon displays all 9 cameras together and allows you
to set up combined camera views that give the best coverage of the ring
and the action.Toggle it to return to the main panel.

8.DONE.Returns you to the MASTER PANEL.

INSTANT REPLAY
--------------
The key to the 4D Sports series is the ability to recreate the
atmosphere and excitement of a full scale sports event.One of the
abilities we have with the 4D Sports graphic system is to record the
action onto a "digital" video tape.You can the rewind and re-play
sections of the fight to impress your friends with your incredible skill
and,more importantly,carefully analyse your opponents strengths and
weaknesses before going in for the "kill".The 4D Sports vision replay
system lets you re-live the last round fought and to rewind and fast
forward through the action so you can find the moment of glory (or
disaster) that you want to see again.

Once selected,there are eight icons displayed.From left to right,they
are:(Refer to diagrams)

1.Rewind to the beginning of the round.

2.Rewind manually."HOLD" this button down until the required portion of
the fight is displayed on screen.

3.Play

4.Frame Advance - allows the action to be examined step by step to
really see the details.

5.Pause.Toggle this on/off to freeze and continue the replay.

6.Fast forward manually."HOLD" this button down until the required
portion of the fight is displayed on screen.

7.Fast forward to end of round.

8.DONE.Returns you to the MASTER PANEL.

FRAME RATE SLIDER - adjust the slider left and right to increase and
decrease the frame rate.100% is normal speed.A lower figure means slow
motion,a higher figure increases the speed.This can be adjusted during
the replay.

POINTS OF VIEW
--------------
From this menu,the player can quickly select the viewpoint from either a
camera,the red boxer or the blue boxer.Once selected,there are four
icons displayed.From left to right they are:(Refer to diagrams)

1.Camera View - shows views from the moveable cameras.See also section
on "Adjusting Cameras".

2.View through Red Boxers eyes [or use F9 during the fight].

3.View through blue boxers eyes [or use F10 during the fight].

4.DONE.Returns you to the MASTER PANEL.

RENDERING
---------
This menu allows the player to adjust the detail of graphics used to
create the boxers shape and features.This has a fundamental effect on
the speed and smoothness of the animation.See also section on FRAME RATE
for more information about processor speed and adjusting frame rates to
get optimum performance out of the game.

Once selected,there are six icons displayed.From left to right,they
are:(Refer to diagrams)

1.Increase detail level.Adds polygons to the boxers to increase detail
level and therefore realism at the expense of frame rate on slower
machines.

2.Decrease detail level.This removes polygons from the boxers to reduce
the detail level and to increase the frame rate on slower machines.

3.AUTO.This puts an automatic system into operation that selects the
optimum graphic level to provide the ideal playing speed and frame
rate,Note:this system will operate constantly and will therefore make
"unexpected" changes to the graphic level during the fight.This is to
compensate for a heavy demand momentarily on your computers processor by
the game for some "hidden" task.

4.Decrease playwindow size.The smaller the playwindow,the faster the
frame rate becomes.On slower machines,it may be necessary to decrease
the size in order to get a better game speed.

5.Increase playwindow size.The larger the window,the bigger the scale
and the better the detail,but the slower the frame rate on slower
machines.

6.DONE.Returns you to the MASTER PANEL.

STATISTICS
----------
This icon brings up a list of the boxing stats recorded for the fight so
far and for the last round in detail.

SYSTEM PANEL
------------
From here the player can save and load camera settings and adjust music
and sound effects.Once selected,there are six icons displayed.From left
to right,they are:(Refer to diagrams)

1.SAVE camera settings.Stores all of the adjustments and settings made
to the cameras so that they can be easily recalled the next time you play.

2.LOAD Camera settings.Puts the camera positions and types back to the
default settings.

3.RESET original settings.Puts the camera positions and types back to
the default settings.

4.Toggle Sound effects On/Off.[Also use CTRL S during play].

5.Toggle music On/Off.[Also use CTRL M during play].

6.DONE.Returns you to the MASTER PANEL.

DONE
----
Returns you to the top level "Fight or Control" menu,or directly back to
the fight if the menu was accessed during a round.

TWO PLAYER MODE
---------------
One of the best features of 4D Sports boxing is the ability for two
players to fight each other on the same computer.

They can even use the same keyboard.

Select a control input device from the OPTIONS panel via the MAIN MENU
for the two players.Assign the correct joystick or keyboard patch for
the player and then procede to either the EXHIBITION or MAIN EVENT
sections for the fight.

A third person can usefully be employed as 4D Sports Vision director -
changing camera angles during the round and showing replays and
adjusting camera angles between rounds.

ADJUSTING CAMERAS
-----------------
During the fight,it is possible to access any of the camera angles by
simply pressing the associated function key (F1 to F10) for each camera
setting.However,it is easy to set up your own camera positions and
angles - and of course much more fun than using the presets.Follow the
instructions below and you will soon become the best TV director in your
street.

To enter the camera adjust menu,go into the MASTER PANEL.To do
this,either press ESCape during a fight,or select CONTROLS from the top
level "Fight or Controls" menu.

Once in the MASTER PANEL select the VIEW OPTIONS icon (second from the
left) to enter into the VIEW OPTIONS panel.Next select ADJUST and you
will go into the panel that allows the cameras to be positioned and
adjusted by the player.Once selected,there are eight icons
displayed.From left to right,they are:(Refer to diagrams)

1.STEP UP to the next camera in the sequence.

2.STEP BACK to the previous camera in the sequence.

3.ADJUST the current camera view.

4.SELECT camera focus on either or both boxers.

5.ZOOM IN

6.ZOOM OUT

7.SAVE

8.DONE.Returns you to the VIEW OPTIONS PANEL.

To select any camera from the nine avaliable for user definition,move up
and down through the cameras with the STEP UP and STEP DOWN icons until
the desired cameras view is displayed.

Go to the ADJUST icon and press and hold FIRE BUTTON 1 or ENTER.With the
button or key still depressed,move around in the 8 directions to adjust
the position of the camera with the joystick or keyboard.Follow the
chart below for the camera move avaliable:

         MOVE UP      FORWARD      MOVE UP
                \        |        /

    ROTATE LEFT -        *        - ROTATE RIGHT

                /        |        \
       MOVE DOWN     MOVE BACK     MOVE DOWN

Using the above moves,it is possible to position the camera anywhere
within the 4D Sports arena.NOTE:it is not possible to adjust the camera
on the F1 key.It is always fixed in the same position.

Next select which boxer,or both,you wish to centre and focus the camera
on.Toggle through the SELECT camera focus icon until the desired choice
is shown.

Use ZOOM IN to get closer to the action and ZOOM OUT to come back out
for a wider camera shot.

Repeat this for all the avaliable cameras until you are happy with the
angles and focuses that you have set up.Remember that you can change the
settings in the middle of a fight with no penalty to your success if you
want to tweak a camera position slightly.

Once the settings are complete,select SAVE to restore them for future
use.

Select DONE to return to the VIEW OPTIONS PANEL.From here it is possible
to set the type of camera and how it follows the action.See the
descriptions of the icons in the previous section headed FRAME RATE
before making your choices.

If you select a camera to be "flying" then it will track the action
smoothly.If a "locked" or static camera is used,then during the fight
press SPACE BAR to re-centre the camera on the action.

CROWDS
------
It is possible to add a textured and rendered crowd into the background
behind the ring.NOTE:it is only possible to have a fixed camera and a
crowd included together,which is why when you select the Crowd icon,it
automatically chooses a fixed camera that has no operator.

With the 4D Sports Vision system it is possible to place a camera right
inside the ring that flies around with the action.No TV sports show in
the world ever gives you the freedom to see the action so close.Mind you
don't get hit,though!

FRAME RATE
----------
4D Sports Boxing uses mathematically generated polygons to create the
on-screen graphics.Because of the complexity of the programming 
algorythms required do the mathematical calculations,polygon graphics 
take a large amount of your computer's avaliable processing power.On 
faster machines with a 286 or 386 processor chip this is not a 
problem,since there is ample power "in reserve" to handle the most 
intensive task.However,if you are running the game on a less powerful 
computer (e.g. one with a clock speed of less than 10mhz) then you may 
encounter situations in the game where the frame rate of animations and 
graphics slow down.

There are a number of features built into this game that allow you to 
speed up the frame rate on your computer.The following is a list of 
suggestions that we recommend you try in order to get the optimum 
performance out of this production.However,since different PC's behave 
in different ways,we suggest you experiment to achieve the optimum frame 
rate by trying these simple options:

1.Decrease the RENDERING LEVEL of the boxers.This removes polygons from 
the human figures and therefore the computer has less graphics to 
calculate for each frame of animation.You can select the AUTO options 
from the RENDERING menu so that the game decides for you the best 
rendering level to use.

2.Decrease the playwindow size.This takes the visible screen area down 
to a more manageable level for slower machines.

3.Cameras.If frame rate is a problem on your machine,then select cameras 
to have no cameraman and for them to be fixed.This will decrease the 
calculations required for the game to follow the action - thus 
increasing visible frame rate.

4.LOW and HIGH SIM.From the OPTIONS panel it is possible to select LOW 
or HIGH simulation level for the game.If LOW sim is selected,it removes 
a proportion of the artificial intelligence for the opponent boxers.This 
means there are less calculations to do for the fight and you get a 
marginally better frame rate.

5.Sound.On slower machines with no sound card,selecting digital sounds 
through the PC speaker can have an adverse effect on the overall frame 
rate - especially during sound intensive portions of the fight.If this 
is no problem select PC speaker (No digital effects) from the SETUP 
menu.

6.Graphics.As a last resort it is possible to drop down to a lower 
graphic mode than the one detected by the SETUP and installation 
program.Although your PC may have a VGA card capable of displaying 256 
colour MCGA graphics,your processor may not be able to handle the extra 
Šworkload of displaying all those colours.In this case,try running the 
game in EGA mode (or the next lowest graphics mode,whichever is 
applicable) and playing again.Although you will have lost a slight 
amount of graphical quality,you will have gained dramatically in frame 
rate and overall playability.

4D SPORTS BOXING - THE CHAMPIONSHIP
-----------------------------------
Once you have tried out a few boxers in the Exhibition match and set up 
the camera angles it is time for the BIG FIGHT.This is where your boxing 
career takes off.Make it big and you are going to be a rich man.If you 
fail...well it will be back to normal life again - no fast cars,big 
houses.Yes,you can wave goodbye to the goodlife and everything that goes 
with it.In the 4D Sports Boxing Championship you aim is to take your 
specially created boxer to the top of the championship hall of fame and 
to be the top of the money earning list.But before you can dream the 
headly heights of stardom you've got some serious fighting to do!

THE GYM
-------
Before you can enter the Championship you must first create your own 
boxer,and for this you must visit the gym.From here you "design" your 
boxer by specifying height,weight and the characteristics of his 
fighting style and even down to the colour of his baggy satin shorts.A 
"camp" of up to ten boxers can be held at any one time.If your gym gets 
full then you will have to "fire" your least favourite boxer via the 
DELETE function.

Enter the GYM via the main menu.Once inside you will visit the locker 
room where you can flick through your database of current fighting 
boxers.Use the NEXT and PREVIOUS buttons to go through them all.

Select HALL OF FAME to view the career progress of your boxers so far so 
that you can choose the best one for the next fight,or the worst if you 
need to give someone the boot.Hit any key to return to the locker room.

BOXER CREATION
--------------
To add a new boxer to the camp,select CREATE.

This takes you to the 4D Sports Boxing Champion generation machine.

You will see your brand new boxer (straight out of the box!) strutting 
his funky stuff to the side of the screen.On the right are a list of 
options that make up the Boxers physique and fighting characteristics.

The cursor box will be flashing over the name option.Christen your boxer 
with his best name you can think of,even your own! Hit ENTER once you 
have made your choice.

Next go through HEIGHT,WEIGHT,SPEED,POWER and STAMINA sliders adjusting 
the value that you think fits for this boxer.There are no hard'n'fast 
rules here.You can fight with whatsoever you create - even if it's a 
6'6" monster with 250ibs of rippling torso and a pink vest and 
shorts.The choice is entirely up to you.It is best to experiment so that 
you can see exactly how speed,stamina and power ratios change the 
effectiveness of your boxer.

Notice how the different weight settings put your boxer in a different 
fighting class.Although heavy weight is the most obvious choice for most 
people,you will be surprised how fun the little guys can be! And they 
really move fast!

HINT:Don't go for maximum of one characteristic and spend nothing on the 
other two.It does not work and any way you end up with a really freaky 
boxer.

Next choose a head from the avaliable mug shots that you think fits the 
personality you have created for the boxer.The heads have no 
relationship with the size of brain,so don't worry if you think your 
boxer looks a little stupid - remember it's you who is doing the fighting!

Choose a colour scheme for your boxer.But remember that if you have to 
show this guy in public give him a little dignity with the correct co-
ordination of outfits.

Toggle the hand icon between left and right handed depending on your 
preference and select DONE when you are happy with your creation.

You can continue to create boxers or you can take your newly made 
fighter out for a quick "test fight" in the EXHIBITION.Select EXIT to 
return to the MAIN MENU.

THE CHALLENGE
-------------
To enter into a fight against a ranking opponent,select MAIN EVENT and 
progress to the locker room once more to pick your fighters for the 
challenge.

Cycle through your camp of boxers until you find the one you want.Note 
their performance from the career statistics indicator on the right hand 
side.Select DONE when you have made your choice.

From the locker room you will procede to the challenge board where you 
choose your boxers international ranking opponent.The ones avaliable to 
you at this stage are marked with a star.They will be the ones with a 
similar ranking and performance to that of your boxer.Use the UP and 
DOWN arrow icons to move through the list and go to the boxing icon to 
enter the fight.The reason for the question mark on the icon is that no-
one knows who will win,yet!

TRAINING
--------
Before each fight,you can take your boxer through a final session in the 
gym to really tone him up to perfection.You have a limited amount of 
training effort that can be spent on any combination of the three 
disciplines.Move the slider bars to select the levels of training 
required.The speed bag increases agility and speed in the ring,the heavy 
bag increases power and the skipping rope helps bring stamina to your 
boxers fitness.Watch the boxer go through the paces as you select each 
training type.Once the training regime has been specified,move to the 
DONE icon to progress to the ring and tonights big fight.

THE BIG FIGHT
-------------
Once you have made your challenge,you go to the 4D Sports Arena for the 
evenings fight.You will be introduced by the host to the two boxers 
competing.After he has finished,you will see the high-level "fight or 
controls" menu.Click on the gloves to start the fight,or on CONTROLS to 
adjust cameras,rendering or point of view options.

The bell will ring for the start of the fight and you will start 
standing in your corner.Move your boxer out into your corner.Move your 
boxer out into the middle of the ring and engage your opponent.From here 
on,Its entirely up to you...

THE FIGHT STATUS PANEL
----------------------
During the fight,at the bottom of the playwindow is the status panel 
that tells you about you and your opponents remaining energy and 
power.Keep an eye on these indicators - they are the key to planning 
your fight strategy.

The main bar across the screen is the Boxer proximity indicator - this 
shows the distance between the boxers,regardless of camera angle.Use the 
bar to judge your distance from your opponent.When the bar glows 
yellow,that indicates that you are on range of his punches - but that 
also means that he is within range of your fists as well.

The clock shows the remaining time in that round.

FIGHTING HINTS
--------------
4D Sports boxing is designed as anintelligent piece of software that 
does not require a detailed knowledge of the workings in the game in 
order to enjoy it thoroughly.The fighting action has a great deal of 
intelligence built into it and you will find yourself making "natural" 
boxing moves - you will learn your opponents strengths and weaknesses 
and begin to build strategy and flow into the fight - just like a real 
champ.

However,to help all you would-be champs out there,here are a few hints 
and tips:

1.Use a combination of fighting moves,rather than just one punch 
repeatedly.

2.Learn to use your guard correctly during the fight - what ever 
happens,never let your guard down totally.Remember also that as you get 
more tired,the harder it is to keep your guard up.

3.Keep moving around the ring.Use all the space avaliable and try and 
trap your opponent into a corner or against the ropes.

4.You will see from his actions when your opponent is getting close to 
dropping.Wait for your opportunity and then make the most of it - you 
may never get a second chance and you will have thrown the fight.

5.Use the camera angles and video replay system to your advantage:if you 
want to see exactly why you got floored during the round then examine 
the replay in slow motion and work out your mistake properly.If you 
can't see the action clearly then choose a new camera angle or make use 
of the point of view cameras - they all help you win.

RETIREMENT
----------
After 40 fights in your boxers career your boxer is nearly ready for 
retirement.On his 40th fight the 4D Sports Boxing board of control will 
review his career and are impowered to remove his fighting license at 
any time.However,if you continue to win fights and prove your fitness 
and agility in the ring,then the rules can be bent a little and you can 
fight on for a few more fights.

End.
