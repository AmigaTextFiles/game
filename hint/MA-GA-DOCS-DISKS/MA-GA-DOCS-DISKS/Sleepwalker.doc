 HIS FAITHFUL, FOUR LEGGED FRIEND ONLY YOU CAN SAVE YOUR MASTER FROM ALL 
 THE PERILS THAT AWAIT HIM IN THE DARK STREETS OF KIPSVILLE.

 FORTUNATELY, FOR LEE AT LEAST, YOUR DESIRE TO SEE HIM SAFELY BACK TO HIS
 BED HAS GIVEN A SUPER-CANINE BEYOND YOUR WILDEST DREAMS. YOU CAN RUN, 
 JUMP AND EVEN BRIDGE GAPS! YOU CAN BE SQUASHED, RUN OVER, AND EVEN ROASTED
 BUT NOTHING WILL QUECH YOUR DESIRE TO SAVE, YOUR MASTER FROM DISATER.
 UNFORTUNATELY, YOUR YOUNG, CUTE, ADORABLE MASTER DOES NOT SEEM TO BE ENDOWED
 WITH THE SAME MAGICAL QUALITIES, AND SUFFERS BADLY IF RUN OVER, SQUASHED OR
 GETS THE SLIGHTEST BIT WET. CAN YOU DO IT? ARE YOU 'DOG' ENOUGH TO SEE THAT
 POOR DEFENCELESS KID SAFELY THROUGH 6 LEVELS OF THE TOUGHEST CITYSCAPE YOU
 HAVE EVER SEEN.

 UNTIL YOU MANAGE TO GET HIM OUT THE EXIT. THE MAIN SCREEN IS LAID AS SHOWN

 NOTE: THE STATUS BAR ON THE PC VERSION APPEARS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN.

 THE SLEEPBAR DISPLAYS HOW DEEP LEE'S SLEEP IS. HE BEGINS THE GAME IN A 
 DEEP SLEEP WHEN IS TO THE FAR RIGHT. IT MOVES GRADUALLY TO THE LEFT
 IDICATING AN EVER INCRESINGLY LIGHTER SLEEP, DEPENDING UPON THE HAZARDS
 THAT LEE ENCOUNTERS. WHEN IT REACHES THE FAR LEFT, LEE HAS WOKEN UP, 
 WATER HAS THE GREATEST EFFECT, AND MAY WAKE HIM UP COMPLETELY. WHEN LEE
 AWAKES, YOU MAY USE ONE OF YOUR 'ATTEMPTS' AND CAN RESTART THE  CURRENT
 LEVEL AT A POINT NEAR WHERE LEE LAST AWOKE. IF YOU HAVE NO ATTEMPTS LEFT,
 YOU RESTART BACK AT THE CURREENT LEVEL.

 SCATTERED AROUND THE LEVELS ARE SOME VARIOUS ICONS THAT WILL GIVE RALPH OR
 LEE A SPECIAL ABILITY. THESE ICONS ARE AS FOLLOWED:

 ICON                      EFFECT
 
 RED NOSE                  LEE IS AWARDED AN EXTRA ATTEMPT
 WHOOPEE CUSHION           MAKES WHOEVER PICKS IT UP INVUNERABLE FOR A TIME
 FALSE BEARD               A HINT FOR SOME SECRET BLOCKS

 NOTE: NOT EVERY ICON APPEARS ON EACH LEVEL, AND SOME ICONS MAY APPEAR MORE
 THAN ONCE PER LEVEL.

 ALSO SCATTERED AROUND EACH OF THE LEVELS ARE FIVE BONUS NOSES. AS YOU
 COLLECT NOSES, THE WORD COMIC IS SPELLED OUT ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF 
 THE PANEL. EACH NOSE HAS A LETTER ON IT WHICH GETS FILLED IN ON THE PANEL
 WHEN THAT NOSE IS COLLECTED. THE LETTERS THAT MAKE UP THE WORD- COMIC- DO
 NOT HAVE TO BE COLLECTED IN THE CORRECT ORDER. ONCE YOU HAVE FOUND ALL THE
 COMIC NOSES, YOU CAN ENTER THE BONUS LEVEL!.

 AS RALPH RESTS AGAINST THE WALL, HE DREAMS OF A HOST OF THINGS THAT COULD
 HAPPEN TO THAT LOVELY, CUTE ADORABLE BOY IF HE WAS'NT SUCH A NICE DOG.

 THE BONUS LEVELS TAKE PLACE IN A LANDSCAPE SIMILAR TO THE LEVEL YOU HAVE
 JUST COMPLETED. LEE IS NOT RALPHS DREAM- WELL, NOT YET ANYHOW. RALPH MUST RUN
 ACROSS THE WILD LANDSCAPE AND COLLECT RED BALLOONS. EVERY 20 BALLOONS 
 COLLECTED GENERATES AN EXTRA 'ATTEMPT'. THERE ARE ICONS FEATURED IN THE BONUS
 LEVELS THAT, WHEN COLLECTED IN THE CORRECT ORDER, SPELL OUT ONE OF THE
 HAZARDS THAT RALPH WOULD LIKE TO SEE LEE GET INVOLVED WITH IF HE WERE NOT
 SUCH A NICE DOG.

 LAMP + POSTBOX - BOX = LAMP POST!

 ON SUCCESSFULLY COLLECTING A HAZARD OF CONGRATULATIONS MESSAGE WILL BE HEARD.

 WHEN THE TIME RUNS OUT, IF RALPH HAS MANAGED TO COLLECT ANY SPECIAL BONUS

 COOL.

 * DONT JUMP WHILE WALKING ALONG TELEGRAPH CABLES. IF LEE IS ON IT WHEN YOU
 LAND HE'LL FALL STRAIGHT THROUGH!.

 * FORMING A BRIDGE IS MUCH BETTER THAN KICKING LEE OVER THE GAP.

 * ALL OBJECTS HAVE A USE IN THE GAME - BUT IT'S NOT ALWAYS OBVIOUS WHERE!.

 * IN EVERY LEVEL THERE ARE SOME SAFE ZONES WHERE YOU CAN LEAVE LEE WALKING
 BETWEEN TWO WALLS. USE THESE TO LET RALPH SCOUR THE REST OF THE LEVEL
 CLEARING ANY HAZARDS HE CAN FIND!.
