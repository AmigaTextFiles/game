WELCOME TO A GREAT WAR
Or 'The Great War', as they once called it.  At the time, it
overshadowed every other conflict in the history of warfare.  Europe had
enjoyed 50 years of relative quiet before all hell broke loose in 1914,
and no-one had ever seen the bloody results of mechanized warfare.
Whole nations were mobilised.  Resources were funnelled into the war
effort.  Industry worked overtime to fill arms quotas.  Machine guns,
airplanes and tanks rumbled onto the world stage and proved that
slaughter would no longer be counted in thousands, but MILLIONS.

To many, it seemed a senseless struggle - power exerted and sought for
the sake of more power.  People swore that men - modern, rational,
civilised men - would never wage war again.  They called it the War To
End All Wars.

BUT AS YOU KNOW, THE HUNGER FOR POWER IS NEVER FILLED.


GETTING STARTED
To begin your conquest of 1914 Europe, use the loading instructions
provided below.  Much of the game is similar to the original
PowerMonger, so you won't need to read much to seize control of the
civilised world.

1. Insert your WWI Edition disk into DF0: and Turn on your computer.
   (Amiga 1000 owners, load kickstart 1.2 or 1.3 and then turn on your
   computer.  At the Workbench prompt, remove Kickstart and insert your
   WWI Edition disk.

2. You're prompted to enter your name.  Type a name and press RETURN.

3. The Option Screen appears next.  Click left mouse button on the
   option of your choice:

   START NEW CONQUEST: Start the conquest from the beginning.  This is
   the 'Standard' game with a pre-set 175 territories to conquer.

   CONTINUE CONQUEST: Choose the next territory to conquer.  You'll be
   asked to insert a saved game disk with the saved game on it.

   PLAY RANDOM GAME: Enter a random computer-generated territory.  Using
   this option lets you go from territory to territory without the
   linear development found in the Standard game.

4. At the prompt, remove your WWI Edition disk from DF0: and insert your
   original PowerMonger game disk.  You MUST have an original
   PowerMonger game disk to play the WWI scenario.  Click left button on
   OK.


THE PATH TO CONQUEST
After the game loads, the Map Selection Chart appears displaying the
territories you can conquer.

There are 175 territories to conquer in the WWI scenario.  At the
beginning of the Conquest game, the only territory you can conquer is
the island at the top left corner.  If you can't immediately find this
island, move the mouse pointer around in that corner of the map.  A grey
rectangle appears when the pointer is over the area.

Like the original Powermonger, you must bring 2/3 of any territory's
population under control to conquer it.  Keep an eye on the Conquest
Meter for when victory is at hand - the needle will be pointing to the
medal.

After you've conquered a territory, you can move onto any adjacent
territory.  UNLIKE THE ORIGINAL POWERMONGER, HOWEVER, YOU MUST CONQUER
ALL 175 TERRITORIES IN ORDER TO WIN THE WAR.


THE WORLD
You can use the overview Map, Map Icons, Conquest Meter, Close-Up Map,
and Map Controls just like you did in the original PowerMonger.


THE OPTION SYMBOL
Select the Option Symbol to set the game speed, pause the game, save and
load games, change maps, or retire from the game.  For details on
loading and saving games, see the Command Summary Card that came with
your original PowerMonger game.

GAME SPEED
For details on Game Speed, refer to your original PowerMonger manual.

GAME BOX OPTIONS
The Game Box Options in the WWI scenario are exactly like those in the
original PowerMonger with the exception of a new option.  Click WORLD
INFO to see information on the territory you're currently trying to
conquer: the territory's name, total population, and the number of
towns, trees, deer, and people on each side (white, blue, and red).
'People in army' refers to the total number of active soldiers on the
map.

FILE BOX OPTIONS
The File Box Options let you format a Save Game disk as well as save and
load WWI scenario games.  For saving and loading instructions, see the
Command Summary Card that came with your original PowerMonger game.


POSTURE SYMBOLS
The Posture Symbols function exactly as described in your original
PowerMonger manual.


COMMAND SYMBOLS
Most of the Command Symbols function as described in your original
PowerMonger manual.  Any exceptions are covered in the following
descriptions.


MILITARY & MOVEMENT SYMBOLS
Though some of the icons are different, Military and Movement option
function exactly as described in your original PowerMonger manual.  Note
that in WWI scenarios there are no sheep to attack, onlly deer.


RATION SYMBOLS
Food in the WWI is referred to as 'rations'.  Get Rations, Drop Rations,
and Supply Rations function the same as Get Food, Drop Food, and supply
Food in the original PowerMonger.  See FOOD SYMBOLS in your original
PowerMonger manual.


INVENT SYMBOLS
The Invent Symbol function as described in the original PowerMonger, but
the objects you can invent are different in 1914.  For details on new
inventions, see 'Inventions' under THE CAPTAINS in this document.  For
details on using the Invent Symbols, see INVENT SYMBOLS in your original
PowerMonger manual.


MISCELLANEOUS SYMBOLS
The Miscellaneous Symbols function exactly as described in your original
PowerMonger manual.


QUERY SYMBOL
The Query Symbol in the WWI scenarios functions exactly as described in
the original PowerMonger manual with the exception of the 'number' of
windows on the screen.  Any object you click on will only have 'one'
window, regardless of the number of people living or working in the
building.  The information provided by the query is also different.

HOUSE NAME:
Type of building: cottage, house, church, factory, hospital, etc.

TOWN NAME:
Name of the settlement.

PEOPLE NAME:
The names of the building's owners.

LEADER:
Which leader controls the settlement: you, Captain Hall, Captain Fox, or
Captain Smythe.

RATIONS:
Number of rations in the entire settlement.

MEN:
Number of people in the entire settlement.  You can recruit these people
if they're on your side.

NEAR FOREST:
Nearest forest to the settlement.

STORES:
Inventions contained in the house: Rifles, Biplane, or Tank.

Note that BIRDS are no longer listed in the Query box.  Thanks to
miracles of telegraph and radio, your communications with subordinate
Captains are instantaneous!  Of course, so are the enemy's...


THE CAPTAINS
The Captain's Status Bars, Selection Arrow, Medals, and Posture function
as described in the original PowerMonger manual.  However, the Captain's
Strength (as it appears when you click on his medals) can be any of the
following: Fit, Well, Weak, Injured, Wounded, Dying, Dead.

INVENTIONS
You can only invent in a village with a factory.  Factories are easily
recognized on the Close-Up Map.  As in the original PowerMonger, what a
factory produces depends on the Captain's Posture, available resources,
the presence of a factory boss, and the occupations of certain locals.

A 'passive' posture will only produce rifles.  Though not heavy arms,
rifles can be produced quickly and issued to every soldier under your
command, thus increasing your firepower significantly.

Inventing in 'neutral' posture is more likely to produce a biplane.  It
takes men, food, lumber, and a good deal of time to invent a biplane,
but the investment may well be worth it.  A Captain in a biplane can
destroy a whole town through strafing and strategic bombing.  Be careful
of enemies with rifles taking potshots at your biplane - it may take
several well-aimed hits, but they can shoot you down.  Keep in mind that
airplanes are your only means of crossing water - there are no boats in
the WWI scenarios.  You'll need one airplane for each soldier you want
to take with you.

A tank is the last and most powerful machine you can make, and only
'aggressive' inventing will earn you one of those.  A tank not only
supplies you with the heaviest firepower available, it gives you greater
protection as well.

EQUIPPING RIFLES, AIRPLANES, AND TANKS
Raw recruits carry bayonets.  Any rifles you pick up are handed out
according to importance - the Captain is equipped first, and then his
original followers, and finally any other troops.

Only one soldier can fly in an airplane.  Your Captain is the first one
to receive an airplane, and again, any additional airplanes are handed
out in according to importance.  If you send a Captain out on a flying
mission, his men will follow behind him and join in the attack when they
arrive.  If he crosses water, his men will wait by the shore until he
returns.  In this situation, you may as well issue a Go Home command,
since they're only using up rations while deployed on the field.

TWO PLAYER GAMES
The WWI Edition is intended only for one player - you cannot play two
player games with the WWI Edition disk.

End.
