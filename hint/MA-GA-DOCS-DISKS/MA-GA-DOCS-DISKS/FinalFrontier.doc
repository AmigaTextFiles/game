Frontier Tutorial

1. First take a look at the system you're in.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 o Select the Galactic Map icon (F2). Ross 154 is in the middle,
   highlighted in green.



2. Select Data icon (F6), and your system will be shown.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 o Two bodies from Ross 154 is Aster. Below Aster is Merlin.

 o Select Economy icon (F7). Major exports are animal meat and
   liquid oxygene.

 o Select Political icon (F8). This system is federation control,
   so it is safe.



3. Find place to sell gods.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 o Go back to the grid by selecting Galactic icon (F6).

 o Use cursor keys to move map until Bernards star. (look up and
   right). Gets highlighted when in middle.

 o Select Data icon (F6). Click on planets until space station
   orbiting Birminghamworld (Boston Base) gets visible.

 o Repeat two last actions under part 2.

 o You'll see that liquid oxygene and animal meat are imports.

 o You can see the orbits of the system bodies using the Orbital
   Map icon (F10), and you can zoom in/out using F7 and F8.
   Left mousebutton centers the screen to the desired planet.



4. Buying gods
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 o Select Communication icon (F4). Choose Stockmarket.

 o Tip up the nose of the ship by moving the mouse backwards
   while holding the right mousebutton.

 o Hold return key to build up boost.

 o Leave atmosphere.



6. Make hyperspace jump
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 o Use Galactic Map icon (F2) and make sure Bernards Star is in
   the middle (green).

 o Return to View mode (F1), then activate hyperspace drive (F8).
   After jump, hold return key to build up boost. It's important
   to leave the hyperspace cloud (F1 to view cloud), since it
   attracts pirates.

 o Select Identification icon (F10) which will overlay names on
   all system bodies (planets).



7. Fly to Birminghamworld using the autopilot
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 o Look at system structure using Galactic Map icon (F2), and then
   the Current Sytem Map icon (F2) to view orbital map of current
   system.

 o Zoom (F7) until you can see Birminghamworld clearly.

 o Centre world with right mousebutton.

 o When you can see the space station (Boston Base) move the mouse
   while holding down the right mousebutton so that you can see
   the space station clearly.

 o Set up destination for the autopilot using Target icon (F10).

 o Return to View Mode (F1).

 o Engage autopilot using F7, until autopilot symbol is shown on
   the console.

 o Speed up travelling time using the "video button" gadgets.

 o Have a space cigar ( or Milkyway Havanna :-) until the
   autopilot docks the ship for you.
