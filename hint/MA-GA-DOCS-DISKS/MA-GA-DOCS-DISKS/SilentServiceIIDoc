                          BY "THE JET" 
 

THE MAP OF THE WESTERN PACIFIC EXACTLY MATCHES THE INTERNAL "COM-
PUTER DATA" USED IN THIS SIMULATION (HENCE THE "JAGGED"  COAST-
LINES, ETC.) 
THE TECHNICAL SUPPLEMENT HAS COMPLETE INFORMATION ABOUT INSTALL-
ING SILENT SERVICE II ON EITHER FLOPPY OR HARD DISKS. 

LEARNING SILENT SERVICE II 

THERE ARE THREE BASIC APPROACHES TO LEARNING THIS SIMULATION.  
PICK THE METHOD THAT SUITS YOU BEST: 
 
(1) PLAY & SKIM: YOU CAN DIVE IN AND TRY THE GAME, SKIMMING WHAT 
YOU 
NEED FROM THIS MANUAL. BE SURE TO LOOK AT THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE 
VIEWS (P 25-38) AND THE CONTROLS (PAGES 42-53). FOR YOUR FIRST 
GAMES, PICK TRAINING THEN THE FIRST TWO HISTORICAL BATTLES 
("WHALES & DUDS" AND "MUSH OR LOOSE"). WHEN YOU'RE READY FOR MORE, 
TRY THE THIRD AND FOURTH HISTORICAL BATTLES ("FLASHER'S TANKERS"). 
 
INITIAL OPTIONS 
AFTER THE TITLE SCREENS, YOU'RE SHOWN A JAPANESE SHIP. TO CORRECT-
LY INITIAL OPTIONS IDENTIFY IT, COMPARE THE PICTURE WITH THOSE IN 
THIS MANUAL (PAGES 116-121), THEN SELECT THE NAME USING THE CURSOR 
KEYS. JUST TYPE IN ANYTHING
 
NEXT A SERIES OF OPTIONS APPEARS.  PLEASE MAKE THESE CHOICES: 
" "TRAINING" IS THE APPROPRIATE TYPE OF GAME. 
 
" "INTRODUCTORY" IS THE APPROPRIATE DIFFICULTY LEVEL. 
 
" TYPE YOUR NAME WHERE REQUESTED. 
 
" "JANUARY 1,1944" IS A GOOD DATE, ALTHOUGH ANY DATE WILL DO. 
 
" "GATO" IS THE RECOMMENDED SUBMARINE CLASS. 
 
YOU'LL BE ASSIGNED A SUBMARINE FROM THE GATO CLASS. PRESS ANY KEY 
TO CONTINUE AND SEE YOUR FIRST LOGBOOK ENTRY, WHICH NOTES THE 
UPCOMING TRAINING EXERCISE.  

FINALLY, CHECK THE KEYBOARD OVERLAY OR TECHNICAL SUPPLEMENT TO 
FIND THE KEYBOARD CONTROLS THAT PAUSE THE GAME. THIS ALLOWS YOU TO 
READ A FEW PARAGRAPHS OF THIS TUTORIAL, DO IT, THEN PAUSE SO YOU 
CAN READ THE NEXT FEW PARAGRAPHS, ETC. 
AT THE START 
 
AT THE START OF THE EXERCISE, YOU'RE VIEWING A CHART OF THE GENER-
AL AREA.  TAKE A MOMENT AND EXAMINE YOUR KEYBOARD OVERLAY.  DURING 
BATTLE YOU FIND EVERY CONTROL HERE. ON SOME MACHINES A JOYSTICK 
AND/OR MOUSE DUPLICATE SOME OF THESE CONTROLS (SEE THE TECHNICAL 
SUPPLEMENT FOR DETAILS) 
 
ON THE CHART YOU'RE A DOT IN THE MIDDLE OF A BOX. THERE ARE FOUR 
SMALL DOTS NORTH OF YOU. THESE ARE FOUR TARGET HULKS, ANCHORED 
HERE FOR TARGET PRACTICE.  YOU CAN USE THE ZOOM AND UNZOOM KEYS TO 
ENLARGE OR REDUCE THE SCALE. FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT CHARTS AND 
SCALES, SEE PAGES 26-28; 
 
BELOW THIS CHART IS THE "INFO PANEL" THAT SHOWS THE STATUS OF YOUR 
1 THE START YOUR SPEED IS 0, YOUR DEPTH IS 000 (I.E., YOU'RE ON 
THE SURFACE YOUR HEADING (HDG)  IS 000 (DUE NORTH).  YOUR VIEW 
BEARING (BEARING) 000 (NORTH), YOU HAVE 6 TORPEDOES LOADED IN THE 
BOW TUBES AND 4 TORPEDOES LOADED IN THE STERN TUBES. THE TARGET 
INFORMATION TO THE RIGHT IS BLANK BECAUSE YOU'VE NOT "MARKED" A 
TARGET. 
 
TO THE RIGHT OF THE CHART IS A PANEL OF TEN TORPEDO TIMERS. THESE 
SH LONG BEFORE A TORPEDO REACHES ITS TARGET (IF THE TDC LIGHT 
BESIDE THE ' ON) , OR HOW LONG BEFORE THE TORPEDO RUNS OUT OF GAS 
(IF THE TDC LIGHT IS OF NOW ALL THE TIMERS READ 0:00 BECAUSE NO 
TORPEDOES ARE RUNNING. 
 
FOR A LARGER CHART SCREEN, TAP THE INFO PANEL ON/OFF KEY. THIS 
GIVES YOU A FULL-SCREEN CHART. TAP THE KEY AGAIN TO RESTORE THE 
INFO PANEL. 
 
HEADING VS. BEARING: TAP THE BRIDGE LOOK OUT KEY. YOU'RE NO LOOK-
OUT POSITION ON TOP OF THE SUB'S CONNING TOWER. YOU SEE THE OCEAN 
AHEAD. THERE ARE SHIPS (THE TARGET HULKS) ON THE HORIZON. DO NOT 
STALL SUB'S ENGINES. INSTEAD, TRY OUT VIEW LEFT AND VIEW RIGHT.  
NOTICE HOW YOUR FIELD OF VISION MOVES LEFT AND RIGHT. WHEN YOUR 
VIEW MOVES, YOUR VIEW (BEARING ON THE INFO PANEL) MOVES WITH IT. 
HOWEVER, HEADING (HDI INFO PANEL) HAS NOT MOVED BECAUSE THE SUB'S 
HULL HASN'T TURNED.

YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HEADING AND BEARING IN 
ORDER TO COMMAND EFFECTIVELY. HEADING IS THE DIRECTION YOUR BOAT 
POSITION IN WHICH IT TRAVELS. BEARING IS THE DIRECTION OF YOUR 
VIEW.  THE LOOK( PERISCOPE, TBT (TARGET BEARING TRANSMITTER)  
BINOCULARS, TORPEDOES ; GUN ARE ALL POINTED AND FIRED ALONG THE 
BEARING, NOT THE BOAT'S HEADING. 
 
THIS CAN BE CONFUSING. THERE ARE TWO KEYS TO ASSIST YOU.  TAP SET 
VIEW TO COURSE TO SWING YOUR BEARING AROUND SO IT POINTS "STRAIGHT 
AHEAD( DIRECTION THE SUB POINTS). TAP SET COURSE TP VIEW TO TURN 
THE SUB SO IT' HEADED IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS YOUR VIEW BEARING. 

FIND YOUR TARGETS: SELECT BRIDGE TBT. THIS IS A PAIR OF BINOCULARS 
IN A SPECIAL MOUNTING.  THEY HAVE A DARK SCALE ACROSS THE LOWER 
CENTER. TURN YOUR VIEW LEFT AND RIGHT OVER THE TARGET HULKS. THE 
SCALE BRIGHTENS WHEN IT IS OVER A SHIP. THIS MEANS THAT SHIP IS 
"MARKED". THE TARGET INFORMATION ON THE INFO PANEL COMES TO LIFE, 
SHOWING THE ENEMY'S RANGE (IN YARDS), SPEED (IN KNOTS), AND COURSE 
(HEADING). 
 
FOR A BETTER VIEW OF A TARGET, TAP ZOOM ONE OR MORE TIMES.  TO 
RETURN TO A NORMAL VIEW, TAP UNZOOM.  
MOVE THE CENTER OF THE SCALE TO THE CENTER OF THE LEFTMOST ENEMY 
SHIP AND TAP TDC ON/OFF. THE TDC LIGHT (ON THE INFO PANEL)  TURNS 
ON AND A SMALL BLACK POINTER APPEARS ON THE SCALE. THIS MEANS YOUR 
TORPEDO DATA COMPUTER (TDC)  IS "LOCKED" ON THE TARGET.  WHILE THE 
TDC IS RUNNING, YOUR VIEW AUTOMATICALLY ROTATES TO KEEP THE CUR-
RENT TARGET POINT CENTERED IN YOUR VIEW. YOU CAN TURN THE TDC OFF 
BY TAPPING TDC ON/OFF AGAIN.  YOU CAN ONLY TURN ON THE TDC WHEN A 
TARGET IS "MARKED", BUT YOU CAN TURN IT OFF ANYTIME. 
 
MAKE SURE YOUR HEADING (HDG) IS 000 AND THE TDC IS ON. TAP AHEAD 
FULL (3). THIS STARTS YOUR SUB MOVING NORTH. YOUR SPEED WILL 
INCREASE TO 1 5 KNOTS BUT THE HEADING WON'T CHANGE (BECAUSE YOU'RE 
NOT TURNING). HOWEVER, AS THE TDC TRACKS THE TARGET, YOU'LL SEE 
THE VIEW BEARING ROTATE AND THE TARGET RANGE GET SMALLER. 
 
NOTE THAT WHEN THE TDC IS "OFF"  (NOT RUNNING) THE VIEW LEFT AND 
VIEW RIGHT KEYS SWING YOUR VIEW LEFT AND RIGHT. WHEN THE TDC IS 
"ON" (RUNNING), YOUR VIEW IS LOCKED ON TARGET. THE KEYS NOW ADJUST 
THE TORPEDO AIM LEFT OR RIGHT.  YOU'LL SEE THE TORPEDO AIMING 
POINTER MOVE ON THE SCALE AS YOU TAP VIEW LEFT AND VIEW RIGHT. 
 
THE ATTACK 
 
SINKING THE ENEMY: TAP SET COURSE TO VIEW. THIS SWINGS YOUR SUB 
AROUND AND HEADS IT TOWARD THE TARGET SHIP. WHEN THE RANGE TO 
TARGET DECREASES TO 1,000 YARDS, TAP ALL STOP (0).  IT'S TIME TO 
GIVE YOUR DECK GUN CREW A LITTLE PRACTICE. 
TAP FIRE DECK GUN ONCE. YOU'LL HEAR THE GUN FIRE AND SEE EITHER AN 
EXPLOSION OR SHELL SPLASH NEAR THE TARGET. THIS IS BECAUSE THE GUN 
CREW DOES THEIR BEST TO AIM THE GUN AT THE "MARKED" TARGET THAT 
YOU'RE TRACKING WITH THE TDC.  IF THE TARGET WASN'T "MARKED", THE 
CREW REFUSES TO SHOOT (THEY DON'T HAVE A TARGET!). 
 
IF THE SPLASH IS IN FRONT OF THE TARGET, YOU'RE FIRING TOO 
"SHORT". YOU N TO ELEVATE THE GUN SLIGHTLY TO LENGTHEN THE FIRING 
RANGE. TAP GUN UP (+) 1 DEGREE ONCE.  YOU'LL SEE THE ELEVATION 
INDICATOR AT THE TOP OF THE TBT CHANGE. 
 
IF THE SPLASH IS BEHIND THE TARGET, YOU'RE FIRING TOO "LONG". YOU 
NEED TO DEPRESS THE GUN SLIGHTLY. TAP GUN DOWN (-) 1 DEGREE ONCE. 
ADJUST YOUR GUN ELEVATION UP OR DOWN UNTIL YOU'RE SCORING HITS.  
SOME MAY SET THE HULK AFIRE, OR CAUSE SECONDARY EXPLOSIONS.  
EVENTUALLY THE TARGET WILL SINK. YOU'VE SCORED YOUR FIRST KILL! 

TORPEDOES AWAY: OBVIOUSLY, THE DECK GUN IS RARELY THE BEST WAY TO 
A SHIP - IT TAKES MANY SHELLS AND A LONG TIME, AND ALL THE WHILE 
YOU'RE ON SURFACE, VULNERABLE TO RETURN FIRE. IT'S TIME TO TRY THE 
TRADITIONAL SUB; WEAPON: THE TORPEDO. TORPEDOES CAN BE FIRED 
SURFACED OR SUBMERGED. HERE WE'LL MAKE A SUBMERGED ATTACK. 

TAP THE DIVE KEY ONCE. ALMOST IMMEDIATELY YOU'LL BE REMOVED FROM 
THE BRIDGE TBT AND GO TO THE CHARTS. AFTER ALL, WHEN A SUB DIVES, 
ALL THE PERSONNEL MUST GO BELOW. ON THE CHART, WATCH THE DEPTH 
CAREFULLY.  WHEN YOU REACH 050 FEET, TAP RISE ONCE. THIS LEVELS 
OUT THE SUBMARINE. IF YOU TAP AGAIN, YOUR SUB STARTS BACK UP. TO 
LEVEL OUT AT A DEPTH, YOU CAN ALSO TAP STRAIGHT & LEVEL.  HOWEVER, 
THIS WOULD ALSO STRAIGHTEN OUT ANY TURNS. 
 
YOU CAN ALSO DIVE OR RISE YOUR SUB TO PERISCOPE DEPTH (50 TO 55 
FEET) TAPPING THE PERISCOPE DEPTH KEY.  YOUR CREW WILL AUTOMATI-
CALLY TAKE YOU TO THE PROPER DEPTH, DIVING AS NECESSARY. 

WHEN YOU'RE STEADY AT 055 FEET, TRY TAPPING PERISCOPE TO LOOK 
THROUGH IT. 
 
YOU CAN MOVE THE PERISCOPE VIEW LEFT OR RIGHT JUST LIKE THE BRIDGE 
TBE.   SINCE THE LAST SHIP IS SUNK, YOUR TDC IS OFF AND NO TARGET 
IS MARKED.  SWING THE SCOPE AROUND TO MARK A NEW TARGET, THEN TURN 
ON THE TDC TO TRACK IT. 
 
IN REAL BATTLE, THE TDC IS EXTREMELY USEFUL BECAUSE IT COMPUTES 
THE ENEMY'S COURSE AND SPEED. IT THEN AUTOMATICALLY SETS THE 
TORPEDO'S COURSE SO IT WILL INTERSECT WITH THE ENEMY.  THE TDC 
CONTINUALLY UPDATES THIS SETTING SO YOU CAN FIRE THE TORPEDO AT 
ANY TIME. WITH THE TDC RUNNING, TORPEDOES ! ALWAYS HIT UNLESS 
EITHER (A) THE ENEMY CHANGES SPEED OR COURSE (OR BOTH) YOU FIRE, 
OR (B)  THE TORPEDO MALFUNCTIONS. HERE THE ENEMY IS ANCHORED A 
HAVE FLAWLESS TORPEDOES, SO EVERY "FISH" FIRED IS A HIT. 
 
TAP FIRE TORPEDO ONCE AND YOU'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. A "TIN FISH" IS 
LAUNCHED, YOU SEE THE WAKE RUNNING TOWARD THE TARGET, AND BLAMMO! 
A HIT. THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE IS SOMEWHAT RANDOM, SO ONE HIT MAY OR 
MAY NOT SINK THE TARGET. IF IT DOESN'T, KEEP FIRING UNTIL YOU SINK 
THE HULK. 
 
NOTE THAT WHEN THE TDC IS RUNNING YOUR VIEW IS "LOCKED"  ONTO THE 
MARKED TARGET. THE VIEW LEFT AND VIEW RIGHT KEYS ADJUST TORPEDO 
AIM, NOT THE VIEW. YOU MUST TURN OFF THE TDC TO CHANGE YOUR VIEW. 
 
FIRING STERN TUBES: SWING YOUR PERISCOPE ONTO THE THIRD TARGET 
HULK TO "MARK" IT, THEN TURN ON YOUR TDC ONCE MORE. 
 
NOW TAP AHEAD FULL (3). NOTICE THAT YOUR SUB IS MOVING AT A MUCH 
SLOWER SPEED THAN ON THE SURFACE. IN REAL BATTLES, YOUR SLOWER 
SUBMERGED SPEED CAN BE IMPORTANT. NOW PRESS TURN STARBD (RIGHT) OR 
TURN PORT (LEFT). YOU'LL NOTICE YOUR SUB'S HEADING SWINGS AWAY 
FROM YOUR BEARING. SHIFT TO THE CHARTS (TAP CHARTS) AND WATCH YOUR 
SUB MOVING THERE. WHEN YOUR SUB IS TRAVELLING ALMOST EXACTLY AWAY 
FROM THE ENEMY, TAP STRAIGHT & LEVEL AND THEN ALL STOP (0).  
DURING ALL THIS, BECAUSE YOU LEFT YOUR PERISCOPE UP, THE CREW AND 
TDC CONTINUED WATCHING THE TARGET.  THE CURRENT TARGET RANGE, 
SPEED AND COURSE SHOULD STILL BE VISIBLE ON THE INFO PANEL. 
 
NOW TAP FIRE TORPEDO ONCE. YOU'LL SEE A TORPEDO LEAVE YOUR BOAT 
AND HEAD TO THE TARGET. NOTICE THAT ON THE INFO PANEL YOU ONLY 
HAVE THREE STERN TUBES LOADED NOW, INSTEAD OF THE ORIGINAL FOUR.  
MEANWHILE THE "S1 " TIMER IS COUNTING DOWN THE SECONDS BEFORE THE 
TORPEDO HITS. 

YOUR CREW AUTOMATICALLY SELECTS EITHER BOW OR STERN TUBES TO FIRE, 
WHICHEVER IS CLOSER TO THE TARGET. SINCE YOUR STERN WAS FACING 
TOWARD THE TARGET, THEY FIRED A STERN TUBE. 

IF YOU'RE QUICK YOU CAN GET BACK TO THE PERISCOPE AND WATCH THE 
TORPEDO EXPLODE.  
AT SOME POINT IN ALL THIS, YOU PROBABLY RECEIVED A MESSAGE THAT 
ONE OF YOUR BOW TUBES HAS BEEN RELOADED. AS YOU FIRE YOUR TORPE-
DOES, YOUR CREW RELOADS THEM AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.  HOWEVER, 
YOUR TORPEDO SUPPLY IS LIMITED. TAP GAUGES AND LOOK IN THE UPPER 
RIGHT CORNER. THE LIGHTED TORPEDO GRAPHICS SHOW :THE NUMBER OF 
TUBES CURRENTLY LOADED. THE NUMBERS BELOW SHOW THE NUMBER OF 
ADDITIONAL TORPEDOES AVAILABLE, BUT NOT YET LOADED INTO A TUBE.  
 
ENDING THE TRAINING CRUISE  
YOU CAN END TRAINING BY SINKING THE LAST HULK WITH GUN FIRE AND/OR 
TORPEDOES.  WHEN THE LAST ENEMY SHIP IS SUNK, THE BATTLE ENDS 
SHORTLY THEREAFTER, BATTLES ALSO END IF ALL SURVIVING ENEMY SHIPS 
HAVE ESCAPED BEYOND 30,000 YARDS). 
 
IN ADDITION, YOU CAN TAP END THIS BATTLE.  YOU AREN'T ALLOWED TO 
QUIT IF YOU'RE TOO CLOSE TO THE ENEMY, OR THEY DETECTED YOU 
(IMPOSSIBLE IN THIS CASE!).  
FURTHER BATTLE TRAINING 
 
TO GET MORE EXPERIENCE IN BATTLE, PLAY SOME OF THE HISTORICAL 
BATTLE SCENARIOS.   
 
THE FIRST TWO SCENARIOS, "WHALES & DUDS" AND "MUSH ON THE LOOSE" 
ONLY HAVE MERCHANT SHIPS. THREE OTHER SCENARIOS FEATURE BATTLES 
AGAINST CONVOYS "FLASHER'S TANKERS (I)", "FLASHER'S TANKERS (II)", 
AND "KILLER O'KANE". 
 
THE MOST DIFFICULT SCENARIOS ARE THOSE AGAINST WARSHIPS, SINCE 
THEY MOVE SO QUICKLY. THESE INCLUDE "SINK THE YAMATO!", "DEATH OF 
THE SHINANO" AND "AN EMBARRASSMENT OF RICHES". 
 
A GOOD FINAL PRACTICE - AND A FINE, QUICK GAME IN ITS OWN RIGHT IS 
THE "RANDOM ENCOUNTER". THIS SCENARIO GENERATES AN INFINITE 
VARIETY OF ALTERNATIVES APPROPRIATE FOR THE TIME PERIOD YOU SE-
LECT, INCLUDING SINGLE MERCHANT CONVOYS AND WARSHIP GROUPS, 
PATROL TUTORIAL  
 
NOW IT'S TIME TO TRY OUT A WAR PATROL.  IN A WAR PATROL YOU LEAVE 
PORT, CRUISE TO TO YOUR PATROL ZONE, SEARCH OUT ENEMIES, AND SINK 
THEM. WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF - TORPEDOES OR LOW ON FUEL, YOU RETURN TO 
PORT. 
 
NEXT A SERIES OF OPTIONS APPEARS.  PLEASE MAKE THESE CHOICES: 
 
" "A SINGLE WAR PATROL" IS THE APPROPRIATE TYPE OF GAME. 
 
" "INTRODUCTORY" IS THE APPROPRIATE DIFFICULTY LEVEL. 
 
" TYPE YOUR NAME WHERE REQUESTED. 
 
" "JANUARY 1 , 1 94-4" IS A GOOD DATE, ALTHOUGH ANY DATE WILL DO. 
 
" "IMP. GATO" IS THE APPROPRIATE SUBMARINE CLASS. 
 
NOW YOU'LL SEE A MAP OF THE WESTERN PACIFIC. USE THE CURSOR TO 
SELECT AN APPROPRIATE STARTING BASE. KEEP TAPPING THE CURSOR UNTIL 
"MIDWAY - SUBPAC" APPEARS.  THIS WILL BE YOUR STARTING BASE.  
PRESS THE RETURN KEY TO FINISH YOUR SELECTION. 
 
NOW A BLACK BOX APPEARS. THIS IS A POSSIBLE PATROL ZONE.  AGAIN, 
USE THE CURSOR TO MOVE THROUGH THE APPROPRIATE SELECTIONS.  STOP 
WHEN YOU REACH THE "EAST CHINA SEA". THIS WILL BE YOUR PATROL 
AREA. AGAIN, PRESS THE RETURN KEY TO FINISH YOUR SELECTION. 
 
YOU'LL BE ASSIGNED A SUBMARINE FROM THE IMPROVED GATO CLASS, PRESS 
ANY KEY TO CONTINUE AND SEE YOUR FIRST LOGBOOK ENTRY, WHICH SHOWS 
YOUR OFFICIAL SAILING ORDERS. PRESS ANY KEY TO BEGIN YOUR WAR 
PATROL. 
  
PATROLLING 
 
THE WAR PATROL BEGINS WITH A MAP VIEW OF THE ENTIRE WESTERN PACIF-
IC OCEAN. YOUR BOAT IS A BRIGHT DOT SURROUNDED BY A BRIGHT BOX. 
YOUR WAR PATROL ZONE IS A DARK BOX OFF THE COAST OF CHINA, SOUTH-
ERN KOREA AND SOUTHERN JAPAN. 
 
CONTROLS: THE KEYBOARD OVERLAY IS NOT USED DURING A WAR PATROL. 
ONLY A VERY LIMITED NUMBER OF CONTROLS ARE USED WHILE PATROLLING. 
 
THE CURSOR KEYS OR NUMERIC KEYPAD MOVE YOUR BOAT ACROSS THE PACIF-
IC TOWARD THE PATROL AREA (FOR JOYSTICK OR MOUSE CONTROLS, SEE 
YOUR TECHNICAL SUPPLEMENT) LAND AND REEF AREAS ARE IMPASSABLE; 
YOU'LL HAVE TO MOVE AROUND THOSE. A LARGER SCALE NAVIGATION MAP IS 
INCLUDED TO HELP YOU NAVIGATE 

TRY EACH OF THE FOLLOWING KEYS, WHICH ARE AVAILABLE DURING A WAR 
PATROL (AS WELL AS IN BATTLE): 
 
CAPTAINS LOG PROVIDES SAILING ORDERS, INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR     
BOAT'S PAST HISTORY. 
 
DAMAGE REPORT ALLOWS YOU TO MONITOR DAMAGE REPAIRS.  
GAUGES ALLOWS YOU TO MONITOR THE BOAT'S CURRENT STATUS IN C 
ESPECIALLY THE NUMBER OF TORPEDO TUBES AND TORPEDOES AVAILABLE. 
 
PORTS IS A SPECIAL KEY ONLY AVAILABLE DURING THE PATROL.  IT 
TOGGLES  ON AND OFF FOR ALL FRIENDLY AND ENEMY PORTS/BASES.  NOTE 
THAT THESE VARY WITH TIME.                           
 
THE COMPUTER CONTROLS (PAUSE,BOSS, SAVE GAME, EXIT TO DOS, 
JOYSTICK ADJUST, VOLUME ADJUST, RESTART GAME. ETC/) ARE ALL AVAIL-
ABLE WHILE PATROLLING. 
 
TIME & FUEL: AS YOU MOVE, YOU'LL SEE THE INFO PANEL IN THE UPPER 
LEFT CHANGE. THE PANEL SHOWS THE CURRENT DATE AND TIME. TIME IS 
KEPT USING A MILITARY CLOCK. THIS MEANS 01 00 IS 1 AM, 1 200 IS 
NOON, I 300 IS 1 PM IS 9 PM, AND 24-00 IS MIDNIGHT.  BELOW THE 
TIME IS THE NUMBER OF DAYS CRUISING YOU HAVE LEFT. MOST SUB TYPES 
(INCLUDING THE GATO CLASS) HAVE 60 DAYS ( 
 
MOVE YOUR SUB ACROSS THE PACIFIC AND INTO THE PATROL ZONE. AS S( 
YOU ENTER THE ZONE, NOTE HOW MANY DAYS OF FUEL REMAIN.  THE DIF-
FERENCE AMOUNT OF FUEL IT TOOK YOU TO REACH YOUR ZONE. A WISE 
CAPTAIN ENDS HIS PATROL WHEN HIS FUEL IS DOWN TO ABOUT 1 1/2 TIMES 
(150%) OF THIS AMOUNT. 
 
FOR EXAMPLE, YOUR PATROL FROM MIDWAY STARTS WITH 60 DAYS AVAIL-
ABLE. WHEN YOU REACH THE EAST CHINA SEA, YOU'RE DOWN TO 45 DAYS 
THEREFORE, IT TOOK YOU 1 5 DAYS TO REACH YOUR PATROL AREA. TO BE 
SAFE, YOU END YOUR PATROL WHEN YOU HAVE ABOUT 22-23 DAYS OF FUEL 
REMAINING (15 * 1.5 = 22.5). IF YOU REMAIN ON PATROL SO LONG THAT 
YOU HAVE LESS THAN 15 DAYS OF FUEL LEFT, YOU WON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO 
GET BACK TO MIDWAY. HOWEVER, YOU CAN LOOK FOR NEARER PORTS BY 
TAPPING THE PORTS KEY. 
 
TIME: CONTINUE CRUISING AND YOU'LL NOTICE THAT EVERY MOVES, TIME 
FLIPS PAST. ALSO NOTICE THAT EVEN IF YOU DON'T MOVE, TIME CONTIN-
UES TO PASS. YOU BOAT CRUISES AROUND AT ITS CURRENT LOCATION IF 
YOU DON'T MOVE IT. TO FREEZE THE PATROL, YOU MUST PRESS THE PAUSE 
KEY. 
CONTACTS: EVENTUALLY YOUR BOAT ENCOUNTERS THE ENEMY.  MOST CON-
TACTS OCCUR IN YOUR PATROL ZONE, BUT AN ENCOUNTER IS POSSIBLE 
ALMOST ANYWHERE. SOME CONTACTS OCCUR WHEN THE ENEMY SPOTS YOU.  
OTHER TIMES YOU SPOT THEM WITH RADAR OR VISUALLY. 
 
BE SURE TO NOTE THE TIME OF THE CONTACT. A NIGHT CONTACT MEANS A 
NIGHT BATTLE, WHERE YOU'LL PROBABLY WANT TO FIGHT ON THE SURFACE. 
A DAY CONTACT MEANS YOU'LL PROBABLY WANT TO FIGHT SUBMERGED. A 
RADAR CONTACT MEANS YOU WILL START FURTHER AWAY FROM THE ENEMY 
WITH MORE TIME TO MANEUVER. A VISUAL CONTACT GIVES YOU LESS TIME. 
A VISUAL CONTACT AT NIGHT RESULTS IN A BATTLE THAT STARTS AT 
POINT-BLANK RANGE, PERHAPS WITH YOUR BOAT INSIDE THE CONVOY'S 
FORMATION! 
 
 
BATTLE TACTICS 
 
IF YOU ENCOUNTER SPEEDY WARSHIPS, JUST GETTING INTO FIRING POSI-
TION IS HARD ENOUGH. WITH SLOWER MERCHANT SHIPS OR CONVOYS YOU CAN 
CIRCLE AROUND AND ATTACK THEM FROM WHATEVER DIRECTION SEEMS MOST 
FAVORABLE. 
 
AS SOON AS YOU HAVE TIME, IT'S WISE TO CHECK THE GAUGES FOR THE 
CURRENT WATER TEMPERATURE AND DEPTH UNDER KEEL. THERE'S NOTHING 
MORE EMBARRASSING THAN MAKING A CRASH DIVE STRAIGHT INTO THE OCEAN 
BOTTOM! 
 
IN DAYLIGHT YOU NORMALLY ATTACK SUBMERGED. AT NIGHT YOUR SUB IS SO 
HARD TO SEE THAT YOU CAN MAKE SURFACE ATTACKS. HOWEVER, AT NIGHT 
DECK GUN FLASHES GIVE AWAY YOUR POSITION. AVOID USING THE DECK GUN 
AT NIGHT IF RETURN GUNFIRE IS A THREAT. 
 
IF ENEMY DESTROYERS PURSUE YOU, DON'T RELY ON WEAPONS TO SAVE 
YOURSELF.  DESTROYERS ARE HARD TO HIT WITH TORPEDOES. THEIR GUNS 
ARE MORE POWERFUL THAN YOURS. YOUR BEST BET IS TO CRASH DIVE, IF 
POSSIBLE BELOW THE TEMPERATURE LAYER (TO COLDER WATER) , THEN MOVE 
AWAY. THE FASTER YOU MOVE , THE BETTER THE ENEMY CAN HEAR YOU. 
WHEN EVADING ATTACK, IT'S BEST TO SNEAK AWAY AT SLOW SPEED. 

COMMANDING A SUBMARINE 
INITIAL OPTIONS 
AT THE START SILENT SERVICE II PRESENTS YOU WITH VARIOUS OPTIONS. 
USING THESE YOU CAN SELECT ANYTHING FROM AN INDIVIDU-
AL BATTLE TO REFIGHTING ALL OF WORLD WAR II. YOU ALSO SELECT THE 
TYPE OF SUBMARINE YOU WISH TO COMMAND AND AN 
APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF REALISM AND DIFFICULTY. 
SHIP IDENTIFICATION 
HERE YOU SEE A PAGE FROM YOUR BOAT'S SHIP ID BOOK.  COMPARE THE 
PICTURE SHOWN WITH THE VARIOUS SHIP PICTURES IN THIS MANUAL (PAGES 
116-121 ). THEN USE THE CURSOR KEYS SELECT THE CORRECT NAME. IF 
YOU FAIL TO MAKE A CORRECT IDENTIFICATION, YOU'RE LIMITED TO THE 
TRAINING SCENARIO. 
 
GAME TYPE 
 
TRAINING: THIS IS A SINGLE LEARNING "BATTLE" AGAINST FOUR MOTION-
LESS, UNARMED FREIGHTER HULKS. YOU'RE FREE TO CRUISE AROUND AND 
ATTACK THEM WITH TORPEDOES AND/OR GUNS. TRAINING TAKES AN HOUR OR 
TWO, MAINLY BECAUSE YOU'LL CONSTANTLY REFER TO THIS MANUAL AND THE 
TECHNICAL SUPPLEMENT. 
 
A SINGLE BATTLE: HERE YOU TO SELECT ONE OF EIGHT ACTUAL SUBMARINE 
ENGAGEMENTS, OR A NINTH RANDOM ENGAGEMENT AGAINST AN UNPREDICTABLE 
FORCE OF JAPANESE SHIPS. INDIVIDUAL BATTLES TAKE A HALF HOUR TO 
TWO HOURS, DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER OF SHIPS INVOLVED AND YOUR 
COMMAND STYLE. FOR A SUMMARY OF EACH HISTORICAL ENGAGEMENT, SEE 
PAGES 98-1 05. 
 
* SINGLE WAR PATROL: HERE YOU TAKE A SUBMARINE ON A COMPLETE WAR 
PATROL INTO THE WESTERN PACIFIC, SEARCHING FOR ENEMIES, ENGAGING 
THEM, AND (HOPEFULLY) RETURNING BACK TO A FRIENDLY BASE ALIVE. A 
WAR PATROL CAN TAKE A FEW HOURS TO AN EVENING OR TWO , DEPENDING 
ON HOW MANY CONTACTS YOU MAKE, AND THE SIZE OF THE RESULTING 
BATTLES. 
 
A WAR CAREER: HERE YOU JOIN THE US NAVY AS A SUBMARINE SKIPPER 
ANY TIME DURING WORLD WAR II. YOU SAIL ON A SERIES OF WAR PATROLS 
IN ONE OR MORE 
TYPES OF SUBS UNTIL EITHER YOU'RE KILLED OR THE WAR ENDS.  THIS IS 
THE LONGEST MOST ELABORATE VERSION OF SILENT SERVICE II. IT MAY 
TAKE HUNDREDS OF HOURS IF YOU START AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR 
(DECEMBER 7, 1941). 
 
RESUME A SAVED GAME: THIS ALLOWS YOU TO CONTINUE A GAME PREVI-
OUSLY SAVED TO DISK. 
 
SEE THE HALL OF FAME: THIS SHOWS THE SUBMARINER'S "HALL OF FAME". 
 
QUIT GAME: THIS EXITS THE GAME, RETURNING YOU TO THE COMPUTERS 
OPERATING SYSTEM. 
 
RECOMMENDED CHOICES:  TRY "TRAIN ADVANCE TO ONE OF THE FIRST TWO 
SINGLE BATTLES ("WHALES & DUDS" OR "MUSH THE LOOSE"). AFTER THAT 
TRY MORE SINGLE BATTLES OR A SINGLE WAR PATROL.  SELECT DATES IN 
1943 OR 1944 FOR GOOD GAMING VARIETY.  FINALLY YOU'LL BE READY FOR 
THE ULTIMATE TEST: A WAR CAREER STARTING DECEMBER 7TH, 1941! 
DIFFICULTY LEVEL 
 
INTRODUCTION:  THIS DIFFICULTY LEVEL IS DESIGNED PURELY FOR BEGIN-
NERS.  JAPANESE CONVOYS DO NOT ZIP-ZAG, YOUR DECK GUN AND TORPE-
DOES DO LARGE AMOUNTS OF DAMAGE AND YOUR SUBMARINE ALWAYS HAS 
RADAR (EVEN BEFORE IT WAS REALLY INTRODUCED!).  JAPANESE WARSHIP 
COMMANDERS ARE SLOW TO REACT, AND IF THEY DO YOUR SUBMARINE CAN 
WITHSTAND A REMARKABLE AMOUNT OF PUNISHMENT.  FINALLY, WHENEVER 
YOU USE THE SHIP ID BOOK, YOUR CREW WILL AUTOMATICALLY SHOW 
YOU THE CORRECT PAGE. 
 
THIS VERSION IS CONSIDERED "EASY"  BY EXPERIENCE PLAYERS.  CONSE-
QUENTLY, POINT SCORING IS GREATLY REDUCED. 
 
NORMAL: THIS LEVEL INTRODUCES YOU TO THE DANGERS OF REAL COMBAT. 
JAPANESE WARSHIPS ARE A BIT MORE ALERT AND ALL JAPANESE SHIPS MAY 
ZIGZAG.  YOU ONLY HAVE RADAR IF IT'S HISTORICALLY APPROPRIATE. 
YOUR SUBMARINE MORE VULNERABLE TO DAMAGE. YOU HAVE A CHOICE BE-
TWEEN "FLAWLESS AND "HISTORICAL" TORPEDOES. 
 
THIS VERSION IS SUGGESTED FOR "NORMAL" PLAYERS FAMILIAR WITH THE 
GAME.  IT'S A BIT EASIER THAN THE REALITY FACED BY SKIPPERS DURING 
THE WAR (A LOT EASIER IF YOU SELECT FLAWLESS TORPEDOES) 
 
ADVANCED: THIS LEVEL IS SIMILAR TO "NORMAL", BUT THE JAPANESE ARE 
YET MORE SKILLFUL AND FREQUENTLY ZIG-ZAG, WHILE YOUR SUBMARINE'S 
ABILITY STAND DAMAGE IS FAIRLY REALISTIC. YOU CAN STILL PICK 
BETWEEN "FLAWLESS "HISTORICAL"  TORPEDOES. 
THIS VERSION IS SUGGESTED FOR "EXPERIENCED" PLAYERS WHO ROUTINELY 
DO VERY WELL IN THE "NORMAL"  VERSION. WITH HISTORICAL TORPEDOES, 
THIS VERSION IS A CLOSE APPROXIMATION OF WWII REALITY. 
                                
ULTIMATE: THIS IS THE MOST DIFFICULT SETTING FOR THE GAME. THE 
JAPANESE ARE SHARP-EYED SCOUNDRELS WHO CAN SMELL YOU COMING AT 
LONG RANGES. YOUR SUBMARINE WAS BUILT SLAP-DASH, SO IT'S A BIT 
WEAKER THAN NORMAL, YOU'RE FORCED TO USE HISTORICAL TORPEDOES, 
 
THIS VERSION IS DESIGNED FOR PLAYERS WHO HAVE EXHAUSTED THE CHAL-
LENGE OF "ADVANCED" PLAY. IT'S PROBABLY A BIT HARDER THAN REAL 
LIFE. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE POINT SCORING AWARDS ARE THE HIGH-
EST. 
ENTER YOUR NAME 
TYPING YOUR NAME HERE MEANS THAT ALL ORDERS AND RECORDS REFLECT 
YOUR NAME. TYPICAL MILITARY FORM IS A FIRST INITIAL AND A FULL 
LAST NAME, BUT MANY SUBMARINER SKIPPERS WERE KNOWN BY A NICKNAME 
AND A LAST NAME (SUCH AS "MUSH" MORTON OR "DICK" O'KANE). 
 
SELECT STARTING DATE 
THIS OPTION DOES NOT APPEAR IN SINGLE HISTORICAL BATTLES, SINCE 
THE DATE FIXED HISTORICALLY. 
 
OTHERWISE, THIS DETERMINES THE DATE YOU TAKE COMMAND OF YOUR NEW 
BOAT. USE THE CURSOR KEYS TO SELECT THE MONTH, DAY AND YEAR.  THE 
DATE AFFECTS SUBMARINES AVAILABLE, WHETHER YOU HAVE RADAR (AT 
"NORMAL"  DIFFICULTY AND HIGHER), AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE WAR. 
IN A WAR PATROL OR WAR CAREER, IT DETERMINES YOUR CHOICE OF START-
ING BASE. FINALLY, IN A WAR CAREER IT DETERMINES HOW LONG THE WAR 
WILL LAST - THE LATER THE DATE, THE SOONER THE WAR WILL END. 
RECOMMENDED CHOICE: ALL AMERICAN SUBMARINES HAD RADAR BY THE 
START OF 1943, AND HAD FIXED ALL TORPEDO DEFECTS BY THE START OF 
1944. NEW PLAYERS ARE ADVISED TO SELECT A DATE IN EARLY 1944 - THE 
"HAPPY HUNTING TIME" FOR AMERICAN SUBMARINES. WAR PATROLS FROM 
NOVEMBER 1944 ONWARD CAN BE FRUSTRATING BECAUSE MOST JAPANESE 
SHIPPING WAS ALREADY SUNK! 

SELECT YOUR STARTING BASE 
 
THIS OPTION IS AVAILABLE IF YOU'RE STARTING A WAR PATROL OR A WAR 
CAREER.  YOUR STARTING BASE AFFECTS WHICH SUBMARINE COMMAND DI-
RECTS YOUR OPERATIONS (SUBPAC OR SUBSOWESPAC), WHICH IN TURN 
AFFECTS THE WAR PATROL ZONES AVAILABLE TO YOU. EQUIPMENT UPGRADES 
AND SOLUTIONS TO MARK 14 TORPEDO PROBLEMS ARE ALSO AFFECTED. 
 
ON MOST COMPUTERS YOU USE THE CURSOR KEYS TO TOGGLE THROUGH THE 
BASE POSSIBILITIES. PRESS THE "ENTER"  KEY TO SELECT THE BASE OF 
YOUR CHOICE. 
 
SELECT WAR PATROL ZONE 
THIS OPTION APPEARS WHENEVER YOU START A WAR PATROL (INCLUDING 
EACH PATROL IN A WAR CAREER).  YOUR STARTING PORT AND HIGH COMMAND 
(SUBPAC OR SUBSOWESPAC) AFFECT THE WAR PATROL ZONES AVAILABLE. IF 
YOU'RE USING AN OLD'S' BOAT, BE SURE TO SELECT A ZONE CLOSE TO

TOURING THE BOAT 
 
                                                                 
THE FOLLOWING SECTION IS A GUIDED TOUR TO ALL THE STATIONS ON 
YOUR BOAT.  LIKE A REAL SUBMARINE SKIPPER, YOU SHOULD BE FAMILIAR 
WITH ALL THE  DETAILS OF YOUR COMMAND! 
 
THE INFO PANEL 
 
THIS READOUT PANEL APPEARS OVER THE BOTTOM OF YOUR CHARTS, BRIDGE, 
AND PERISCOPE VIEWS. ON THE CHARTS IT CAN BE SWITCHED ON AND OFF 
BY PRESSING THE INFO PANEL ON/OFF KEY. 
 
DEPTH: YOUR CURRENT DEPTH, IN FEET. A DEPTH OF "000"  MEANS YOU'RE 
ON THE SURFACE. "RADAR DEPTH" IS 025 OR LESS - AT THESE DEPTHS 
YOUR RADAR IS ABOVE WATER AND FUNCTIONAL. "PERISCOPE DEPTH" IS 055 
OR LESS - AT THESE DEPTHS YOUR PERISCOPE CAN BE RAISED ABOVE 
WATER.                         
 
SPEED: YOUR CURRENT SPEED, IN KNOTS. ONE KNOT IS 2002 YARDS PER 
HOUR, OR 33.3 YARDS PER MINUTE.  THEREFORE, A BOAT AT 10 KNOTS 
TRAVELS 333 YARDS PER MINUTE, AT 20 KNOTS 666 YARDS PER INCH. 
 
HDG (HEADING):  YOUR CURRENT COURSE AS A COMPASS DIRECTION.  ON A 
COMPASS, NORTH IS 000, EAST 090, SOUTH 180, AND WEST 270. 
 
BEARING:  THE CURRENT BEARING TO THE ENEMY. EFFECTIVELY, IT IS THE 
DIRECTION YOU'RE LOOKING (AS A LOOKOUT, WITH TBT, OR WITH THE 
PERISCOPE).  NOTE THAT YOUR BEARING AND HEADING CAN BE QUITE 
DIFFERENT, LEADING TO PECULIAR OPTICAL ILLUSIONS. 
 
LOADED BOW:  THE NUMBER OF BOW TORPEDO TUBES LOADED AND READING 
FOR ACTION.  THE MAXIMUM VARIES WITH THE TYPE OF SUB YOU COMMAND. 
 
LOADED STERN:  THE NUMBER OF STERN TORPEDO TUBES LOADED AND READY 
FOR ACTION.  THE MAXIMUM VARIES WITH THE TYPE OF SUB YOU COMMAND. 
TARGET COURSE: THE COURSE, IN COMPASS DEGREES, OF THE TARGET LAST 
"MARKED"  BY A LOOKOUT, IN YOUR PERISCOPE, OR IN YOUR TBT. 
 
TDC LIGHT: THIS LIGHT IS "ON" WHEN THE TDC (TORPEDO DATA COMPUTER) 
IS RUNNING. IT IS "OFF" WHEN THE COMPUTER IS TURNED OFF. THE TDC 
COMPUTES TORPEDO COURSES AND AUTOMATICALLY "PROGRAMS" YOUR TORPE-
DOES. 
 
TORPEDOES RUNNING: THIS SECONDARY PANEL ONLY APPEARS ON YOUR 
CHARTS (SEE BELOW). IT SHOWS WHICH TORPEDOES (IF ANY) ARE RUNNING, 
PREDICTED "HIT" OR "OUT OF FUEL" TIME. 
 
TORPEDO ID: TORPEDOES FIRED FROM THE BOW TUBES ARE LABELED B1 
THROUGH B6.  THOSE FIRED FROM THE STERN TUBES ARE LABELLED S1 
THROUGH S4. 
 
TORPEDO TDC LIGHT: THIS LIGHT IS ON IF THE TORPEDO WAS FIRED TDC. 
IT IS OFF IF THE TORPEDO WAS FIRED MANUALLY. 
 
TORPEDO TIMER: WHEN THIS READS 0:00, NO TORPEDO IS RUNNING.  
OTHERWISE, IT SHOWS THE MINUTES OF THE TORPEDO RUN. 
 
IF THE TDC LIGHT IS ON FOR THAT TORPEDO, THE TIMER IS COUNTING 
TOWARD THE PREDICTED INTERCEPTION POINT. 
 
IF THE TDC LIGHT IS OFF FOR THAT TORPEDO, THE TIMER COUNTS DOWN 
THE TORPEDO'S FUEL (I.E., WHEN IT REACHES ZERO, THE TORPEDO RUNS 
OUT OF FUEL). 
 
THE CHART 
 
YOUR SUBMARINE HAS A COMPLETE SET OF CHARTS FOR THE ENTIRE WESTERN 
PACIFIC OCEAN AT FOUR DIFFERENT SCALES.  THE LARGEST SCALE SHOWS 
THE ENTIRE OCEAN ON ONE CHART.  SMALLER SCALES SHOW A LARGE, 
MEDIUM OR SMALL AMOUNT OF ARE .  YOU CHANGE CHART SCALE BY TAPPING 
THE ZOOM KEYS. 
 
ALL CHARTS SHOW AREAS OF LAND AND SEA.  LIGHTER-COLORED SEA AREAS 
ARE SHALLOW WATER. THE DEPTH VARIES 
FROM 50 TO 200 FEET EXCEPT CLOSE TO 
LAND OR REEFS, WHERE IT MAY BE EVEN 
SHALLOWER. 
 
YOUR POSITION ON THE PACIFIC OCEAN (LARGEST SCALE) CHART IS A 
SINGLE DOT. ON ALL SMALLER SCALE CHARTS YOUR POSITION IS REPRE-
SENTED BY A SMALL LINE AND A WAKE SHOWING YOUR SPEED AND DIRECTION 
OF TRAVEL. 
THE ZOOM BOX APPEARS AROUND YOUR POSITION ON ALL CHARTS EXCEPT THE 
SMALLEST. IT REPRESENTS THE AREA IN THE NEXT SMALLER CHART. HOWEV-
ER, THE BOX ON THE PACIFIC OCEAN CHART IS OVERSIZED, SINCE AN 
ACCURATELY SIZED BOX WOULD BE A SINGLE DOT! 
 
CHART PLOTS 
 
CHART SCALES: THE AMOUNT OF AREA COVERED BY EACH CHART VARIES, 
DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE INFORMATION PANEL IS PRESENT ACROSS THE 
BOTTOM. 
 
YOUR CREW AUTOMATICALLY UPDATES ("PLOTS") EACH CHART WITH THE 
POSITION OF YOUR BOAT, ALL ENEMY SHIPS, AND ALL TORPEDOES.  EACH 
OF THESE APPEARS AS A SHORT COLORED LINE. THE COLOR VARIES WITH 
THE TYPE OF CONTACT (RADAR, SONAR OR VISUAL, IN ASCENDING PRIORI-
TY).  EACH HAS A "TAIL", OR WAKE.  THE SIZE OF THE WAKE 
ROUGHLY REPRESENTS THE SPEED OF THE SHIP OR TORPEDO. THE DIRECTION 
OF THE SHIP AND WAKE TOGETHER APPROXIMATE THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL. 
SEE THE TECHNICAL SUPPLEMENT FOR SYMBOLS AND COLORS. 
NORMALLY THE CHART BEGINS CENTERED ON YOUR SUBMARINE.  HOWEVER, IF 
THE TDC (TORPEDO DATA COMPUTER, SEE PAGES 47-50) IS RUNNING, THE 
CHART IS CENTERED HALFWAY BETWEEN YOUR SUB AND THE "MARKED" TARGET 
(BUT ONLY IF BOTH CAN FIT ON THE CHART AT THAT SCALE). 
 
YOUR CREW CONSTANTLY UPDATES THE POSITION OF YOUR BOAT AND ALL 
YOUR TORPEDOES.  THEY ALSO UPDATE ALL ENEMY SHIPS WITH THE BEST 
AVAILABLE INFORMATION. IF YOUR BOAT CAN SEE THE ENEMY, OR IS USING 
RADAR, ENEMY POSITIONS ARE VERY ACCURATE. IF YOUR BOAT IS USING 
SONAR ONLY, ENEMY POSITIONS ARE FAIRLY GOOD,BUT NOT PERFECT. 
 
IF THE CREW HAS NO NEW INFORMATION AN A SHIP, THEY REMOVE IT FROM 
THE PLOT. OF COURSE, THE ENEMY IS PROBABLY STILL BE THERE, JUST 
OUTSIDE OF DETECTION RANGE! 
THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IF YOU'RE SURFACING AFTER RUNNING 
DEEP. IT PAYS TO RAISE THE PERISCOPE AND LOOK AROUND FIRST! 
 
THE CREW ALSO PLOTS SINKING SHIPS FOR A WHILE AFTER THEY DISAPPEAR 
BENEATH THE SURFACE. THIS HELPS REMIND YOU THAT A SLOWLY SINKING 
HULK CAN BE A NAVIGATION HAZARD. 

PERISCOPE 
THE PERISCOPE MUST BE RAISED ("UP") BEFORE YOU CAN USE THIS VIEW. 
YOUR DEPTH MUST BE 55' OR LESS TO USE THE PERISCOPE.  YOU CANNOT 
USE THE PERISCOPE IF IT'S LOWERED.  IF YOU PRESS PERISCOPE AND 
NOTHING HAPPENS THE PERISCOPE IS PROBABLY DOWN. TRY TAPPING PERI-
SCOPE UP/DOWN ONCE TO RAISE THE SCOPE. 
 
THE DIRECTION YOUR VIEW FACES APPEARS IN BEARING ON THE INFO 
PANEL.  THE PERISCOPE CAN BE ROTATED TO LOOK IN ANY DIRECTION.  
THE VIEW LEFT, VIEW LEFT FAST, VIEW RIGHT AND VIEW RIGHT FAST KEYS 
CONTROL ROTATION. 
 
VIEW AREA:  THIS IS THE SEASCAPE VISIBLE THROUGH THE PERISCOPE 
LENS.  THE VIEW CAN BE ROTATED LEFT OR RIGHT.  THE VIEW LEFT, VIEW 
LEFT FAST, VIEW RIGHT AND VIEW RIGHT FAST KEYS CONTROL ROTATION.  
HOWEVER, THESE ONLY WORK IF THE TDC IS OFF.  IF THE TDC IS RUNNING 
THESE KEYS CONTROL THE TORPEDO AIMING POINTER. 
 
AIMING SCALE: THIS SCALE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE VIEW AREA IS USED TO 
"MARK" TARGETS AND AIM TORPEDOES.  WHENEVER THE SCALE BRIGHTENS 
YOU HAVE "MARKED" A TARGET.  YOUR CREW AUTOMATICALLY UPDATES ALL 
TORPEDO FIRING DATA TO THE LAST "MARK" GIVEN.  THIS DATA ALSO 
APPEARS ON THE INFO PANEL. 
 
YOUR CREW CAN ONLY TRACK ON TARGET A A TIME.  WHEN EVER YOU GIVE A 
NEW "MARK" (BY MOVING THE SCALE ONTO A TARGET UNTIL IT BRIGHTENS) 
YOU ERASE ALL EARLIER INFORMATION. 
TORPEDO AIMING POINTER: THIS APPEARS ON THE BRIGHTENED SCALE ONLY 
WHEN THE TDC IS ON (RUNNING).  IT AIMS TORPEDOES LEFT, RIGHT OR 
DIRECTLY AT THE TARGET. THE VIEW LEFT AND VIEW RIGHT KEYS 
ADJUST THE AIMING POINTER, NOT YOUR VIEW AREA. 
 
MAGNIFICATION: YOUR PERISCOPE HAS FOUR MAGNIFICATION LEVELS: "1 " 
(NORMAL VISION) TO "4"  (MAXIMUM MAGNIFICATION).  THESE ARE CON-
TROLLED BY THE ZOOM AND UNZOOM KEYS. 
                                                                 
INFO PANEL: SEE ABOVE. 
BRIDGE LOOKOUT 
THE BRIDGE LOOKOUT IS AVAILABLE ONLY IF YOU'RE ON THE SURFACE (AT 
DEPTH 000). IT SHOWS THE VIEW FROM THE TOP OF THE CONNING TOWER 
("BRIDGE"), AS SEEN BY A LOOKOUT. IT SHOWS ONE QUARTER (ABOUT 90") 
OF THE HORIZON AROUND YOUR BOAT.  THE DIRECTION YOU'RE FACING 
APPEARS IN BEARING ON THE INFO PANEL. 
THE VIEW CAN BE ROTATED LEFT OR RIGHT. 
THE VIEW LEFT, VIEW LEFT FAST, VIEW RIGHT AND VIEW RIGHT FAST KEYS 
CONTROL ROTATION. 
THIS IS AVAILABLE ONLY IF YOU'RE ON THE SURFACE (AT DEPTH 000).  
IT SHOWS THE THE VIEW FROM THE TOP OF THE CONNING TOWER (BRIDGE) 
AS YOU LOOK THROUGH BINOCULARS MOUNTED IN THE TBT (TARGET BEARING 
TRANSMITTER). 
 
THE TBT (TARGET BEARING TRANSMITTER) IS USED TO AIM YOUR TORPEDOES 
AND DECK GUN WHILE YOU'RE ON THE SURFACE.  THE DIRECTION YOU'VE 
LOOKING APPEARS IN BEARING ON THE INFO PANEL. 
 
VIEW AREA: THIS IS THE SEASCAPE VISIBLE THROUGH THE BINOCULAR 
LENSES.  THE VIEW CAN BE ROTATED LEFT OR RIGHT. THE VIEW LEFT, 
VIEW LEFT FAST, VIEW RIGHT, AND VIEW RIGHT FAST KEYS CONTROL 
ROTATION. THESE KEYS WORK WHILE THE TDC IS OFF. IF THE TDC IS 
RUNNING, THESE KEYS CONTROL THE TORPEDO AIMING POINTER INSTEAD.  
 
DECK GUN ELEVATION ADJUSTMENT:  THIS INDICATES HOW MUCH EXTRA 
ELEVATION OR DEPRESSION YOU'RE ORDERING TO THE DECK GUN CREW.  A 
"0" MEANS THE GUN IS ELEVATED CORRECTLY FOR THE TARGET'S CURRENT 
RANGE.  A "+1" OR MORE MEANS THE GUN IS ELEVATED ESPECIALLY HIGH 
(USEFUL IF THE TARGET IS OPENING THE RANGE TO YOU), WHILE "-1" OR 
LESS MEANS THE GUN IS DEPRESSED MORE THAN NORMAL (USEFUL IF THE 
TARGET IS CLOSING THE RANGE).  NOTE: "0" DOES NOT MEAN THE DECK 
GUN IS SHOOTING AT "0" RANGE. 
DECK GUN ELEVATION IS CONTROLLED BY ADDING OR SUBTRACTING DEGREES 
USING THE GUN DOWN (-) 1 DEGREE AND THE GUN UP (+) 1 DEGREE KEYS. 
IMPORTANT NOTE:  YOU CANNOT USE THE DECK GUN UNLESS YOUR TDC IS 
ALREADY TRACKING A TARGET.  SEE TDC ON/OFF (PAGE 51) FOR DETAILS. 
AIMING SCALE:  THIS SCALE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE VIEW AREA "MARKS"  
TARGETS AND AIMS THE DECK GUN AND TORPEDOES.  WHENEVER THE SCALE 
BRIGHTENS YOU HAVE "MARKED" A TARGET. 
YOUR CREW AUTOMATICALLY UPDATES ALL FIRING DATA TO THE LAST "MARK" 
GIVEN. THIS DATA ALSO APPEARS ON THE INFO PANEL. 
YOUR CREW TRACKS ONLY ONE TARGET AT A TIME. WHENEVER YOU GIVE A 
NEW "MARK" (BY MOVING THE SCALE ONTO A TARGET UNTIL IT BRIGHTENS) 
YOU DROP THE PREVIOUS TARGET. 
TORPEDO AIMING POINTER: THIS APPEARS ON THE BRIGHTENED SCALE WHEN 
THE TDC IS ON (RUNNING). IT AIMS TORPEDOES LEFT, RIGHT OR DIRECTLY 
AT THE TARGET. VIEW LEFT AND VIEW RIGHT KEYS ADJUST THE AIMING 
POINTER, NOT YOUR VIEW AREA. 
MAGNIFICATION: THE TBT BINOCULARS HAVE FOUR MAGNIFICATION LEVELS: 
"1" (NORMAL VISION) TO "4"  (MAXIMUM MAGNIFICATION). THESE ARE 
CONTROLLED BY THE ZOOM AND UNZOOM KEYS. 
INFO PANEL: SEE ABOVE.
 
GAUGES 
BY TAPPING THE GAUGES KEY, YOU 
CAN SEE ALL THE IMPORTANT GAUGES THAT 
REPORT ON THE CONDITIONS OF YOUR BOAT 
AND THE SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT.\ 
CRITICAL GAUGES 
THESE GAUGES PROVIDE INFORMATION USEFUL IN BATTLE AND UNAVAILABLE 
ELSEWHERE.  YOU SHOULD CONSULT THE GAUGES PERIODICALLY. 
DEPT UNDER KEEL (DUK):  THIS INDICATES THE DEPTH OF THE WATER (IN 
FEET) BETWEEN THE KEEL (BOTTOM) OF YOUR SUB AND SEA BOTTOM.  KEEP 
A CLOSE EYE ON THE DUK IF YOU'RE IN SHALLOW WATER OR  UNDERTAKING 
A DEEP DIVE.  HITTING THE BOTTOM CAN SERIOUSLY DAMAGE YOUR SUB. 
 
WATER TEMPERATURE (TEMP):  THIS INDICATES THE TEMPERATURE OF THE 
WATER OUTSIDE THE HULL.  THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT IF YOU'RE TRYING 
TO EVADE 
DETECTION BY ENEMY SONAR. AT A MIDDLE DEPTH (USUALLY BETWEEN 100' 
AND 200') THE WATER TEMPERATURE SUDDENLY DROPS, THE BOUNDARY 
BETWEEN THE WARM SURFACE WATER AND THE COLD DEEPER WATER IS "THE 
LAYER". THIS BOUNDARY LINE DEFLECTS SONAR, WHICH HELPS HIDE YOU 
FROM SURFACE SHIPS. 
BATTERY LEVEL: WHEN SUBMERGED YOUR SUB IS POWERED BY BATTERIES, 
WHICH DISCHARGE SLOWLY. MOVING SUBMERGED INCREASES THE AMOUNT OF 
DISCHARGE. THE FASTER YOU GO, THE FASTER YOUR BATTERIES DISCHARGE. 
WHILE SITTING STATIONARY, YOUR BATTERY CAN LAST ABOUT 24 HOURS, AT 
QUARTER SPEED ABOUT 12 HOURS, HALF SPEED ABOUT 5 HOURS, AT FULL 
SPEED ABOUT 2 1/4 HOURS, AND AT FLANK SPEED ABOUT 1 1/4-HOURS.  
YOUR BATTERIES CAN ONLY BE RECHARGED WHILE  ON THE SURFACE.  
WHENEVER YOU'RE SURFACED, ANY DIESEL ENGINES NOT USED FOR MOVEMENT 
ARE USED INSTEAD TO RECHARGE THE BATTERIES. IT TAKES ALL FOUR 
DIESEL ENGINES A COUPLE OF HOURS TO COMPLETELY RECHARGE THE BAT-
TERIES.  HOWEVER, YOU MUST BE AT "ALL STOP" TO USE FOUR DIESELS 
FOR RECHARGING. IF YOU HAVE SOME ENGINES MOVING THE BOAT, IT TAKES 
PROPORTIONATELY LONGER TO RECHARGE THE BATTERIES (WITH TWO ENGINES 
MOVING THE BOAT AND TWO RECHARGING, IT TAKES TWICE AS LONG, WITH 
THREE MOVING THE BOAT AND ONE RECHARGING, FOUR TIMES AS LONG).  NO 
RECHARGING OCCURS IF YOU'RE MOVING AT FLANK (MAXIMUM) SPEED. 
 
CLOCK:  THIS IS A 24-HOUR MILITARY CLOCK.  AS ON ALL CLOCKS, THE 
SMALL HAND SHOWS THE HOURS, THE LARGE HAND THE MINUTES.  ON A 
MILITARY CLOCK TIME RUNS FROM 0000 TO 2400.  FOR EXAMPLE 8 AM IS 
0800; NOON IS 1200, 3 PM IS 1500, 10 PM IS 2200 AND MIDNIGHT IS 
2400. 
 
USEFUL GAUGES 
 
THESE GAUGES EITHER REPEAT INFORMATION ON THE INFO PANEL OR ARE 
LESS CRITICAL IN BATTLE. 
 
SPEED:  THIS SHOWS YOUR CURRENT SPEED IN KNOTS (NAUTICAL MILES PER 
HOUR). 
 
ENGINE ROOM TELEGRAPH:  THIS SHOWS WHICH OF THE FOUR ENGINES ARE 
MOVING THE SUB.  IF "4" IS LIT, ALL ENGINES ARE RUNNING FOR MAXI-
MUM SPEED.  WHEN "2" IS LIT, TWO ARE RUNNING FOR HALF SPEED, ETC. 
"STOP" MEANS NONE ARE RUNNING.  "BACK" MEANS ALL ENGINES ARE 
MOVING THE BOAT SLOWLY IN REVERSE. 
 
IF YOU'RE ON THE SURFACE, ANY ENGINE NOT CURRENTLY DRIVING THE SUB 
IS RECHARGING THE BATTERIES - IF THEY NEED RECHARGING. 
DEPTH: THIS INDICATES THE CURRENT DEPTH (IN FEET) OF YOUR SUBMA-
RINE. ONCE YOU BEGIN TO SUBMERGE (GO TO A DEPTH OF 1' OR MORE) ALL 
HATCHES ARE CLOSED AND LOCKED. THIS PREVENTS YOU FROM GETTING TO 
THE BRIDGE LOOKOUT AND BRIDGE TBT.  HOWEVER, AT DEPTHS UP TO 25' 
YOUR RADAR CAN STILL OPERATE. AT DEPTHS UP TO 55' YOUR PERISCOPE 
CAN STILL REACH THE SURFACE. 
 
LEVELING BUBBLE: THIS IS MUCH LIKE A CARPENTER'S LEVEL.  IT INDI-
CATES WHETHER THE SUB IS DIVING, RISING, OR RUNNING STEADY.  WHEN 
THE BUBBLE FLOATS TO THE RIGHT, YOU'RE DIVING; WHEN TO THE LEFT, 
YOU'RE CLIMBING. WHEN THE BUBBLE IS IN THE MIDDLE, YOUR SUB IS 
LEVEL. 
 
COMPASS: THIS INDICATING THE DIRECTION YOU'RE TRAVELING.  NORTH IS 
000, EAST IS 090, SOUTH IS 180, AND WEST IS 270. 
 
FORWARD TORPEDO TUBE INDICATORS SHOW THE NUMBER OF FORWARD TORPEDO 
TUBES CURRENTLY LOADED. A TUBE THAT'S LOADED AND READY IS ILLUMI-
NATED, A TUBE THAT'S EMPTY OR RELOADING IS DARK. 
 
AFT TORPEDO TUBE INDICATORS SHOW THE NUMBER OF AFT TORPEDO TUBES 
CURRENTLY LOADED. A TUBE THAT'S LOADED AND READY IS ILLUMINATED, A 
TUBE THAT'S EMPTY OR RELOADING IS DARK. 

FORWARD TORPEDO RELOADS INDICATES THE NUMBER OF TORPEDOS AVAILABLE 
FOR RELOADING IN FORWARD TUBES.  THEREFORE, THE TOTAL NUMBER OF 
FORWARD-FIRING TORPEDOS ON YOUR BOAT IS THE NUMBER OF LOADED TUBES 
PLUS THESE RELOADS. 
 
AFT TORPEDO RELOADS INDICATES THE NUMBER OF TORPEDOS AVAILABLE FOR 
RELOADING IN AFT TUBES.  THEREFORE, THE TOTAL NUMBER OF AFT-FIRING 
TORPEDOS ON YOUR BOAT IS THE NUMBER OF LOADED TUBES PLUS THESE 
RELOADS. 
 
FUEL GAUGE: THIS "COLUMN" GAUGE SHOWS YOUR REMAINING FUEL OIL. IT 
HAS THREE COLUMNS, WITH EACH DIVIDED INTO A NUMBER OF SECTIONS.  
SINCE OIL IS BLACK, THE DARK AREAS SHOW FUEL REMAINING, WHILE 
LIGHTER SECTIONS SHOW WATER. NOTE -THAT OIL FLOATS ON WATER, AND 
IS THEREFORE ALWAYS AT THE TOP PART OF THE GAUGE. 
 
CHRISTMAS TREE:  THIS AREA SHOWS WHICH HATCHES AND OTHER OPENINGS 
ARE OPEN (RED) OR CLOSED (GREEN).  THE "TREE" IS GREEN WHEN YOU 
DIVE. 
 
 
DAMAGE REPORT 
 
THIS DISPLAY SHOWS THE MAJOR SYSTEMS ON YOUR SUBMARINE, AND THEIR 
DAMAGE STATUS.  WHENEVER A SYSTEM IS DAMAGED, ITS CURRENT CONDI-
TION IS LIGHTED.   IF A SYSTEM IS UNDAMAGED OR COMPLETELY RE-
PAIRED, IT'S DARK. 
 
SOME DAMAGE IS TEMPORARY.  IF SO, "REPAIRING" MAY BE LIGHTED ALSO. 
REPAIRS CAN TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO A FEW DAYS, DEPENDING ON THE 
SYSTEM. 
 
SOME DAMAGE IS PERMANENT.  IT CANNOT BE REPAIRED UNTIL YOU RETURN 
TO BASE.  ONCE AT A FRIENDLY BASE, ALL DAMAGE IS AUTOMATICALLY 
REPAIRED. 
DAMAGE PERCENTAGE:  YOUR SUB CANNOT TAKE DAMAGE FOREVER.  EVENTU-
ALLY THE ACCUMULATED DAMAGE WILL WEAKEN YOUR HULL SO MUCH THAT THE 
SUBMARINE SINKS IN FACT, A QUICK SERIES OF VERY BAD HITS COULD DO 
THIS ALMOST INSTANTLY.  THE DAMAGE PERCENTAGE IS AN ESTIMATE FROM 
YOUR CREW OF HOW CLOSE YOU'VE COME TO A CATASTROPHIC COLLAPSE AND 
SINKING.  SOMETIMES YOU MAY FINS THE PERCENTAGE BECOMES LESS.  
THIS OCCURS AS THE CREW REPAIRS DAMAGE.  IF DAMAGE DOES NOT 
THREATEN THE WATERTIGHT INTEGRITY OF THE BOAST THE CREW MAY IGNORE 
IT FOR PERCENTAGE PURPOSES.  AS A RESULT YOU MAY HAVE A PIECE OF 
EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTIONING WHILE THE DAMAGE READS 00%. 
 
SOME DAMAGE IS UNREPAIRABLE EXCEPT AT A BASE.  AS CAPTAIN YOU MUST 
JUDGE WHEN YOU SHOULD BREAK OFF THE BATTLE OR THE PATROL AND 
RETURN FOR REPAIRS. 
 
PERISCOPE 
 
YOU CANNOT LOOK THROUGH A DAMAGED PERISCOPE--USUALLY BECAUSE THE 
TUBE IS BENT AND/OR JAMMED. THIS MAKES UNDERWATER ATTACKS SO 
DIFFICULT AND INACCURATE THAT YOU'RE ADVISED TO ATTACK ONLY FROM 
THE SURFACE. 
 
PERISCOPE DAMAGE CAN BE REPAIRED ONLY AT A BASE. 
 
RADAR 
 
WRECKED RADAR DOES NOT FUNCTION AT ALL.  AS A RESULT, YOUR CON-
TACTS ARE AT CLOSER RANGES. YOU'LL HAVE TO RELY ON EYESIGHT, 
PERISCOPE OBSERVATIONS AND SONAR, WHICH ARE USUALLY SHORTER RANGED 
THAN RADAR. 
 
IN 1944 AND 1945 WRECKED RADAR IS ESPECIALLY DISADVANTAGEOUS AT 
NIGHT SINCE THE JAPANESE MAY HAVE THEIR OWN RADARS, AND THEREFORE 
COULD (ON THEIR RADAR) BEFORE YOU SPOT THEM (WITH YOUR LOOKOUTS). 
 
WRECKED RADAR CAN BE REPAIRED ONLY AT A BASE. 
 
DECK GUN 
 
A WRECKED DECK GUN CANNOT FIRE.  NOW YOUR ONLY WEAPON IS TORPE-
DOES.  ONCE WRECKED, A DECK GUN CAN BE REPAIRED ONLY AT A BASE. 

TORPEDO ROOMS 
 
THESE ARE THE CREW AREAS THAT RELOAD AND CONTROL THE TORPEDO 
TUBES.  MOST SPARE TORPEDOES ARE ALSO STORED HERE. 
FLOODING/REPAIRING: WHEN A TORPEDO ROOM IS DAMAGED IT BEGINS TO 
FLOOD. THE CREW IMMEDIATELY BEGINS REPAIRS. WHILE REPAIRS ARE IN 
PROGRESS THE TUBES CANNOT BE FIRED.  ONCE THE CREW HAS COMPLETED 
REPAIRS, THE EFFICIENCY OF THE TORPEDO ROOM RETURNS TO NORMAL. 
 
HALF OUT: IF A FLOODING TORPEDO ROOM SUFFERS FURTHER DAMAGE, HALF 
OR ALL OF THE TUBES MAY BE PERMANENTLY OUT OF ACTION. 
 
ENGINES 
 
YOUR SUB HAS FOUR DIESEL ENGINES.  THESE PROVIDE POWER FOR MOVING 
ON THE SURFACE AND FOR RECHARGING BATTERIES. WHENEVER AN ENGINE IS 
WRECKED YOUR MAXIMUM SPEED IS REDUCED (AND BATTERY RECHARGING IS 
MADE MORE DIFFICULT). 
 
DAMAGED/REPAIRING: A DAMAGED ENGINE IS OUT OF ACTION UNTIL THE 
CREW REPAIRS IT. ONCE REPAIRED, IT FUNCTIONS NORMALLY AGAIN.  
ENGINE REPAIRS ARE OFTEN LENGTHY - DON'T EXPECT RESULTS IN JUST A 
FEW MINUTES. 
 
WRECKED: A WRECKED ENGINE IS BEYOND REPAIR BY YOUR CREW.  IT 
CANNOT BE USED FOR THE REST OF THE VOYAGE.  IT CAN BE REPAIRED 
ONLY AT A BASE. 
 
FUEL TANKS 
 
THE FUEL TANKS CARRY OIL FOR YOUR DIESEL ENGINES. IF A FUEL TANK 
IS DAMAGED, YOU IMMEDIATELY LOSE A LARGE AMOUNT OF OIL. THIS LOSS 
CAN SERIOUSLY AFFECT YOUR CRUISING RANGE. 
 
THE CREW AUTOMATICALLY SHUTS OFF VALVES TO ISOLATE THE DAMAGE.  
HOWEVER, SMALL LEAKS CONTINUE.  THE LEAKAGE MAY REVEAL YOUR POSI-
TION TO A NEARBY ENEMY, BUT ISN'T LARGE ENOUGH TO CAUSE ANY FUR-
THER REDUCTIONS IN YOUR CRUISING RANGE. 
 
YOU CAN SUFFER MULTIPLE HIS IN YOUR FUEL TANKS, WITH A ONE-TIME 
LOSS IN CRUISING RANGE WITH EACH HIT.  LEAKING FUEL TANKS CAN BE 
REPAIRED ONLY AT A BASE. 
 
BATTERIES 
 
YOUR SUB USES TWO LARGE BANKS OF BATTERIES, ON FORWARD, ONE AFT, 
TO POWER ITS ELECTRIC ENGINES FOR UNDERWATER TRAVEL.  IF ONE 
BATTER IS DAMAGED YOU'RE REDUCED TO HALF SPEED SUBMERGED.  IF BOTH 
ARE DAMAGED YOU'RE IMMOBILIZED UNTIL AT LEAST ONE IS REPAIRED, OR 
UNTIL YOU SURFACE.  YOU CAN STILL SURFACE AND DIVE, REGARDLESS OF 
BATTERY DAMAGE. 
 
DAMAGED/REPAIRING:  THE BATTER IS OUT OF ACTION UNTIL THE CREW 
REPAIRS IT.  ONCE REPAIRED, IT FUNCTIONS NORMALLY AGAIN. 
 
FLOODED, SURFACE:  IF A DAMAGED BATTERY SUFFERS FURTHER DAMAGE, 
FLOODING REACHES LEAKING BATTERY ACIDS, GENERATING DEADLY CHLORINE 
GAS.  YOU MUST SURFACE IMMEDIATELY, BEFORE THE GAS KILLS YOU AND 
YOUR CREW.  IN THIS SITUATION YOU SHOULD HIT THE BLOW ALL TANKS 
KEY AND SURFACE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. 
ONCE SURFACED YOUR CREW IMMEDIATELY VENTS THE GAS FUMES.  YOU CAN 
DIVE AGAIN IF YOU WISH. MEANWHILE, REPAIRS CONTINUE ON THE DAMAGED 
BATTERY. 
 
DIVE PLANES 
 
 
THE DIVE PLANES ALLOW YOUR BOAT TO DIVE AND SURFACE QUICKLY:  THEY 
ACT AS "WINGS," GUIDING THE SHIP SMOOTHLY UP OR DOWN.  IF THE DIVE 
PLANES ARE DAMAGED YOUR ABILITY TO CONTROL THE SHIP WHEN DIVING OR 
CLIMBING IS REDUCED. @ IT TAKES LONGER TO DIVE AND LONGER TO 
SURFACE. 
 
ADDITIONAL DAMAGE TO THE DIVE PLANES CAN WRECK THEM. IF THE PLANES 
ARE WRECKED YOU CANNOT DIVE AT ALL, AND CAN RISE ONLY BY "BLOWING 
ALL TANK THE SURFACE. REPAIRING WRECKED PLANES IS VIRTUALLY IMPOS-
SIBLE AT SEA TO BE STUCK ON THE SURFACE UNTIL YOU REACH A BASE FOR 
REPAIRS. 
 
FIRE MIDSHIPS 
 
 
SOMETIMES DAMAGE CAUSES FIRES. THE MOST LIKELY AREA IS THE WHERE 
MANY ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS MEET IN THE CONTROL PANELS.  WHEN A  
OCCURS THE CREW WORKS QUICKLY TO EXTINGUISH IT.  HOWEVER, UNTIL 
IT'S OUT OF THE CREW REACTS SLOWLY TO ALL YOUR COMMANDS. IN FACT, 
DON'T BE SURPRISED IF SEEMS TO IGNORE YOUR COMMANDS (YOU MAY NEED 
TO PRESS A KEY MULTIPLE TIMES TO "GET THROUGH" TO YOUR DISTRACTED 
CREW). 
 
A CONTINUING FIRE CAUSES DAMAGE TO YOUR STRUCTURAL STRENGTH AND 
THE SUBMARINE'S OVERALL SURVIVABILITY. 
 
BULKHEADS 
 
YOUR SUBMARINE'S STRUCTURAL STRENGTH LARGELY DEPENDS ON ITS BULK-
HEADS.  THESE ARE THE BASIC SKELETAL STRUCTURE OF THE VESSEL.  IF 
A BULKHEAD BUCKLES OR CRACKS, THE ENTIRE HULL IS WEAKENED.  THIS 
PRODUCES PERMANENT DAMAGE. 
 
WEAKENED/REPAIRING: WHEN A BULKHEAD IS DAMAGED, THE CREW IMMEDI-
ATELY STARTS REPAIRS. THESE REPAIRS ARE MAINLY "SHORING UP"  THE 
WEAKENED MEMBER WITH BEAMS CARRIED ESPECIALLY FOR THIS PURPOSE. 
 
ONCE A BULKHEAD IS WEAKENED AND UNDER REPAIR, YOUR MAXIMUM SAFE 
DIVING DEPTH IS REDUCED TO HALF(50%) OF THE NORMAL VALUE.  FUR-
THERMORE YOUR BOAT CANNOT TURN AS FAST. 
 
SHORED UP: IF REPAIRS ARE SUCCESSFUL, THE BULKHEAD IS "SHORED UP" 
TURNING ABILITY BECOMES SOMEWHAT BETTER, BUT THE SAFE DIVING DEPTH 
IS STILL (50%) OF THE NORMAL VALUE . FURTHERMORE, THE OVERALL 
STRENGTH OF THE SUBMARINE REMAINS LESS THAN BEFORE. 
 
MULTIPLE BULKHEAD HITS GREATLY WEAKEN THE HULL OF YOUR SUBMARINE, 
UNTIL EVENTUALLY IT CRUMPLES. THIS IS TRUE EVEN IF THE BULKHEADS 
ARE SHORE( OR MORE BULKHEADS HAVE BEEN WEAKENED, HEAD FOR BASE 
IMMEDIATE--EVEN 
IF THEY'RE SHORED UP YOU'RE STILL IN GREAT" DANGER.             
 
SINKING: MULTIPLE BULKHEAD 
DAMAGE CAN CRACK YOUR HULL.  THE SUB 
BEGINS TO BREAK UP AND SINK.  IF YOU'RE 
VERY QUICK AND VERY LUCKY, SOMETIMES 
BLOWING ALL TANKS WILL RELIEVE THE PRESSURE 
ON THE HULL AND STOP THIS.  BUT THIS 
IS A LAST AND OFTEN FORLORN HOPE.  USUALLY 
YOUR DOOMED. 
 
CAPTAIN'S LOG 
 
TAP THE CAPTAINS LOG KEY.  AT ANY TIME DURING PLAY, YOU CAN CON-
SULT THE CAPTAIN'S LOG BOOK.  IT CONTAINS CURRENT DATA ABOUT YOUR 
BOAT, YOUR SAILING ORDERS AND OTHER RECORDS.  USE THE CURSOR KEYS 
TO PAGE BACK AND FORTH IN THE LOG BOOK. 
 
STATUS ICONS 
 
THE ICONS APPEAR AT THE BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER OF MOST VIEWS.  THEY 
REMIND YOU OF VARIOUS OPTIONS CURRENTLY SELECTED. 
 
TIME RATE:  DEFAULT SETTING IS "1" WHICH MEANS TIME PASSES AT 
"READ LIFE" SPEEDS.  HOWEVER, TIME CAN BE SET AS HIGH AS "8" WHERE 
TIME PASSES MUCH FASTER. 
 
SOUND VOLUME:  THIS INDICATES WETHER ALL, SOME OR NONE OF THE 
SOUNDS ARE HEARD.  SEE THE TECHNICAL SUPPLEMENT FOR THE DIFFERENT 
SETTINGS AVAILABLE. 
ANIMATIONS ON/OFF: THIS INDICATES WHETHER THE GAME SHOW ANIMATIONS 
OR NOT. 
                                
TORPEDO SPEED: THIS INDICATES WHETHER YOUR TORPEDOES ARE SET TO 
RUN AT HIGH SPEED (SHORT RANGE) OR LOW SPEED (LONGER RANGE). THIS 
ONLY APPLIES TO MARK 14 TORPEDOES. IF YOU HAVE MARK 10 OR MARK 18 
THE SPEED IS ALWAYS HIGH.                                       
 
RADAR RUNNING: THIS INDICATES THAT YOUR RADAR SET IS ABOVE WATER 
AND FUNCTIONING 
 
PERISCOPE: THIS INDICATES WHETHER THE PERISCOPE US UP OR DOWN.  
YOU CANNOT LOOK THROUGH THE "SCOPE"  UNLESS IT'S UP. 
WAR PATROL CONTROLS 
 
 
WAR PATROLS ALLOW YOU TO SAIL YOUR SUBMARINE AROUND THE PACIFIC 
OCEAN. THE BATTLE CONTROLS (SEE PAGES 42-53) ARE INACTIVE UNTIL 
YOU MAKE CONTACT WITH ENEMY SHIPS. 
 
                                                                 
WAR PATROL CONTROLS APPLY ONLY IF YOU SELECT A "WAR PATROL" OR 
"WAR CAREER" OPTION, AND ONLY DURING NAVIGATION BETWEEN BATTLES.  
WAR PATROL CONTROLS DO NOT APPLY IN "TRAINING" OR "SINGLE BAT-
TLES".  (SEE INITIAL OPTIONS, PAGES 19-24, FOR MORE INFORMATION). 
VIEWS 
 
ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF VIEWS, OFTEN WITH SPECIAL CONTROLS ARE 
AVAILABLE DURING WAR PATROL OPERATIONS.  (FORE A MORE COMPLETE 
DESCRIPTION OF EACH VIEW, SEE TOURING THE BOAT PAGES 23-28) 
 
VIEWS AVAILABLE 
 
CHARTS:  ONLY THE TARGETS SCALE CHART IS AVAILABLE, SHOWING THE 
ENTIRE INFO PANEL, A SPECIAL PANEL APPEARS IN THE UPPER LEFT 
SHOWING CRUCIAL PATROL INFORMATION. 
 
DAMAGE REPORT:  THIS IS AVAILABLE SO YOU CAN VIEW THE STATUS OF 
YOUR BOAT. 
CAPTAIN'S LOG:  THIS IS AVAILABLE, WITH YOUR SAILING ORDERS, 
RECENTLY RECEIVED RADIO MESSAGES, AND RECORDS OF YOUR ACCOMPLISH-
MENTS. 
UNAVAILABLE VIEWS:  BRIDGE LOOKOUT, PERISCOPE, AND BRIDGE TBT. 
VIEW CONTROLS-CHART 
IN WAR PATROLS, THE NORMAL ZOOM AND UNZOOM FUNCTIONS ARE UNAVAIL-
ABLE.  INSTEAD YOU HAVE ONE SPECIAL OPTION. 
PORTS:  TOP THE PORTS KEY TO SEE ALL JAPANESE AND AMERICAN 
PORTS/BASES ON THE MAP.  JAPANESE BASES ARE AREAS OF LARGE NAVAL 
ACTIVITY, AND ARE PROTECTED BY WIDE-RANGING ENEMY PATROLS.  THE 
BASE SYMBOLS AUTOMATICALLY DISAPPEAR WHENEVER YOU RESUME NAVIGA-
TION. 
ENTER AN AMERICAN BASE ENDS A WAR PATROL IN A SINGLE WAR PATROL 
THIS ALSO ENDS THE GAME.  IN A WAR CAREER THE GAME CONTINUES WITH 
VARIOUS OPTIONS FOR REFUELING, REPAIR OR EVEN GETTING A NEW SUB 
FRESH FROM THE CONSTRUCTION YARDS. 
 
VIEW CONTROLS-DAMAGE REPORT 
 
AS IN BATTLES, THERE ARE NO SPECIAL CONTROLS ON THE DAMAGE REPORT 
SCREEN.  SELECT ANOTHER VIEW TO EXIT. 
 
VIEW CONTROLS-CAPTAIN'S LOG 
 
THE CONTROLS IN THE CAPTAIN'S LOG ARE THE SAME AS IN BATTLE.  USE 
THE CURSOR KEYS TO PAGE THROUGH THE LOGBOOK, EXAMINING YOUR SAIL-
ING ORDERS, CURRENT DATA, RECENT RADIO MESSAGES AND RECORDS. 
 
NAVIGATION CONTROLS 
 
DURING A WAR PATROL, SIMPLIFIED CONTROLS ARE USED TO "CON" 
(MANEUVER) YOUR SUBMARINE ACROSS THE PACIFIC OCEAN.  YOU MUST USE 
THE CHART VIEW FOR NAVIGATION. 
 
KEYBOARD:  USE THE CURSOR KEYS TO MOVE YOUR SUB NORTH (UP), SOUTH 
(DOWN), EAST (RIGHT), OR WEST (LEFT) ON THE MAP. 
 
EACH TAP OF THE KEY MOVES YOUR SUB MANY MILES AND CAUSES THE CLOCK 
TO ADVANCE A NUMBER OF HOURS. 
 
ON MANY MACHINES WITH A NUMERIC KEYPAD, ALL THE KEYS ARE THE CON. 
THIS ALLOWS DIAGONAL MOVEMENT (USING 1, 3, 7, AND 9 KEYS) AS WELL 
AS LEFT-RIGHT AND UP-DOWN MOVEMENT. 
 
JOYSTICK OR MOUSE:  IF YOUR MACHINE HAS A JOYSTICK OR MOUSE AT-
TACHED IN SOME VERSIONS THIS CAN MOVE YOUR SUB. SEE THE TECHNICAL 
SUPPLEMENT FOR DETAILS. 
TIME: DURING A WAR PATROL, A FEW HOURS ADVANCE EVERY FEW SECONDS. 
IF YOU SIT IN PLACE AND WATCH THE CLOCK, YOU'LL SEE THE HOURS 
ADVANCE. THEREFORE TO PAUSE THE GAME YOU MUST TAP THE PAUSE 
(KEYS). 
 
ENEMY ATTACK:  WHEN YOU SUB ENCOUNTERS AN ENEMY FORCE, THE WAR 
PATROL TEMPORARILY HALTS.  IF THE ENEMY SIGHTED YOU FIRST, YOU'RE 
FORCED INTO BATTLE.  IF YOU SIGHT THE ENEMY FIRST, YOU'RE GIVEN 
THE CHANCE TO ENGAGE OR AVOID THE ENEMY. 

NOTE THAT IF YOU SUB HAS SJ RADAR (NORMAL AFTER THE MIDDLE OF 
1942), MANY CONTACTS (ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT) ARE RADAR CONTACTS.  
WHEN YOU GO TO BATTLE THESE ENEMIES ARE VISIBLE ON YOUR CHARTS, 
BUT NOWHERE ELSE.  THIS IS BECAUSE RADAR "SEES" FURTHER THAN 
EYESIGHT, ALLOWING YOU TO DETECT THE ENEMY BEFORE YOU CAN SEE HIM 
VISUALLY FROM THE BRIDGE LOOKOUT, PERISCOPE OR BRIDGE TBT. 
 
BEFORE RADAR WAS INSTALLED (AND SOMETIMES AFTERWARD), SUBMARINES 
COULD BLUNDER INTO THE ENEMY.  DON'T BE SHOCKED IF SOMETIMES YOU 
FIND ENEMY SHIPS ALL AROUND YOU. 
BATTLE CONTROLS/VIEW CONTROLS 
 
EACH KEY OR CONTROL HAS A NAME IN ITALICS. THIS NAME IS USED ON 
THE KEYBOARD OVERLAY.  THE MASTER LIST OF ALL NAME AND KEYS AP-
PEARS IN THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT SUPPLEMENT (IN CASE YOUR OVERLAY IS 
DAMAGED OR LOST) 
 
VIEW CONTROLS 
 
THESE CONTROLS DETERMINE WHICH VIEW IS ON YOUR SCREEN. 
 
CHARTS: TAP THIS KEY TO VIEW YOUR BATTLE CHARTS.  THIS VIEW IS 
EXPLAINED ON PAGES 26-28. 
 
BRIDGE LOOKOUT: TAP THIS KEY TO GO TO THE BRIDGE LOOKOUT POSITION. 
THIS IS POSSIBLE ONLY IF YOU'RE ON THE SURFACE (AT 000' DEPTH).  
THIS VIEW IS EXPLAINED ON PAGE 29.

BINOCULARS MOUNTED ON THE TBT (TARGET BEARING TRANSMITTER).  AS IN 
THE BRIDGE LOOKOUT, THIS IS POSSIBLE ONLY IF YOUR ON THE SURFACE 
(AT 000' DEPTH).  THIS VIEW IS EXPLAINED ON PAGE 30. 
 
PERISCOPE: TAP THIS KEY TO LOOK THROUGH THE PERISCOPE. THIS IS 
POSSIBLE ONLY IF YOUR AT PERISCOPE DEPTH (55' OR LESS) AND THE 
PERISCOPE IS UP.  THIS VIEW IS EXPLAINED ON PAGE 28. 
 
SOMETIMES THIS VIEW SUDDENLY DISAPPEARS AND YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF 
LOOKING AT YOUR CHARTS.  THIS OCCURS IF YOUR PERISCOPE DROPS 
BENEATH THE WATER--BECAUSE YOUR DEPTH DROPS BELOW 55', OR BECAUSE 
YOU'VE LOWERED THE SCOPE. 
 
GAUGES:  TAP THIS KEY VIEW THE VARIOUS DIALS AND GAUGES IN THE 
SUB.  THIS VIEW IS EXPLAINED ON PAGES 31-33. 
 
DAMAGE REPORT: TAP THIS KEY TO SEE A GRAPHIC DAMAGE REPORT ABOUT 
YOUR SUB. THIS VIEW IS ON PAGES 33-36. 
 
CAPTAIN'S LOG:  TAP THIS KEY TO SEE YOUR LOGBOOK. 
 
VIEW SCANNING CONTROLS 
 
THESE CONTROLS ADJUST THE DIRECTION IN WHICH YOU ARE LOOKING. THEY 
ONLY APPLY TO THE BRIDGE LOOKOUT, PERISCOPE AND BRIDGE TBT VIEWS. 

VIEW RIGHT:  THIS MOVES YOUR VIEWPOINT TO THE RIGHT ON THE BRIDGE 
LOOKOUT, BRIDGE TBT OR PERISCOPE VIEW. 
 
IF THE TDC IS ON (RUNNING), THIS KEY ADJUSTS YOUR TORPEDO AIM TO 
THE RIGHT INSTEAD OF SHIFTING YOUR VIEW.  TO CHANGE YOUR VIEW, YOU 
MUST TURN OFF THE TDC. 
 
VIEW LEFT:  THIS MOVES YOUR VIEWPOINT TO THE LEFT ON THE BRIDGE 
LOOKOUT, BRIDGE TBT AND PERISCOPE VIEW 
IF THE TDC IS ON (RUNNING), THIS KEY AIMS THE TORPEDO TO THE LEFT 
INSTEAD OF SHIFTING YOUR VIEW.  TO CHANGE YOUR VIEW, YOU MUST TURN 
OFF THE TDC. 
 
VIEW RIGHT FAST:  THIS QUICKLY MOVES YOUR VIEWPOINT TO THE RIGHT 
ON THE BRIDGE LOOKOUT, BRIDGE TBT OR PERISCOPE VIEW.  YOUR VIEW-
POINT SKIPS IN LARGE 10 DEGREE JUMPS, SO JUST A FEW TAPS ARE 
NEEDED TO SCAN THE ENTIRE HORIZON. 
 
VIEW LEFT FAST:  THIS QUICKLY MOVES YOUR VIEWPOINT TO THE LEFT ON 
THE BRIDGE LOOKOUT, BRIDGE TBT OR PERISCOPE VIEW. YOUR VIEWPOINT 
SKIPS IN LARGE 10 DEGREE JUMPS, SO JUST A FEW TAPS ARE NEEDED TO 
SCAN THE ENTIRE HORIZON. 
 
SET VIEW TO COURSE:  THIS IMMEDIATELY MOVES YOUR VIEWPOINT TO 
STRAIGHT AHEAD:THE BEARING CHANGES TO MATCH YOUR HEADING.  YOUR 
VIEW IS NOW OVER THE BOW OF YOUR BOAT, LOOKING WHATEVER DIRECTION 
YOUR TRAVELLING. 
 
TDC ON/OFF:  THIS CAUSE YOUR PERISCOPE OR BRIDGE TBT TO "TRACK" A 
TARGET.  IT ALSO COMMUNICATES CORRECT FIRING INFO TO YOUR TORPE-
DOES.  FOR A DETAILED EXPLANATION OF HOW TO USE THIS FEATURE, SEE 
TORPEDO FIRING CONTROLS, PAGE 49 BELOW. 
 
OTHER VIEWING CONTROLS 
 
THESE CONTROLS ARE AVAILABLE ON A VARIETY OF SCREENS, AS APPROPRI-
ATE. 
 
PERISCOPE UP/DOWN:  THIS KEY RAISES AND LOWERS YOUR PERISCOPE.  
YOU CAN TOGGLE YOUR PERISCOPE UP AND DOWN BY TAPPING THE PERISCOPE 
UP/DOWN KEY.  THE PERISCOPE IS ONLY FUNCTIONAL WHEN "UP" AND YOUR 
DEPTH OF 55 FEET OR LESS.  YOU CAN EVEN USE THE PERISCOPE ON THE 
SURFACE. 
 
ZOOM VIEW:  THIS MAGNIFIES (ENLARGES) YOUR VIEW.  AT THE BRIDGE 
TBT OR PERISCOPE, IT SHOWS LESS AREA BUT WITH GREATER DETAIL.  THE 
TBT OR PERISCOPE MAGNIFICATION RANGES FROM "1" (NORMAL EYESIGHT) 
TO "4" (MAXIMUM ZOOM).  ON THE CHARTS, IT SENDS YOU TO A SMALLER 
SCALE (MORE DETAIL BUT LESS AREA). 
 
UNZOOM VIEW:  THIS REDUCES YOUR VIEW.  AT THE BRIDGE TBT OR PERI-
SCOPE IT SHOWS MORE BUT WITH LESS DETAIL.  THE TBT OR PERISCOPE 
MAGNIFICATION RANGES FROM "1" (NORMAL EYESIGHT) TO "4"  (MAXIMUM 
ZOOM).  ON THE CHARTS,  IT SENDS YOU TO A LARGER SCALE (LESS 
DETAIL BUT MORE AREA). 
 
SHIP ID BOOK 
 
THE SHIP ID BOOK IS AVAILABLE WHILE YOU'RE EXAMINING CHARTS, ON 
THE BRIDGE (EITHER AT THE LOOKOUT OR THE TBT), OR AT THE PERI-
SCOPE.  THE BOOK SHOWS PICTURES OF ENEMY NAVAL VESSELS, WHICH 
HELPS TO IDENTIFY TARGETS. 
 
IF YOU SELECT "INTRODUCTORY" DIFFICULTY, YOUR CREW WILL POINT OUT 
WHICH PAGE OF THE BOOK IS CORRECT.  THIS IS, THEY IDENTIFY THE 
TARGET FOR YOU! 
SHIP ID BOOK ON/OFF:  THIS KEY TOGGLES THE BOOK ON AND OFF.  WHEN 
PRESENT, THE BOOK OVERLAYS THE INFO PANEL ON THE LOWER PART OF 
YOUR VIEW. 
 
CURSOR KEYS:  THE UP/DOWN CURSOR KEYS PAGE THROUGH THE BOOK.  THE 
LEFT/RIGHT KEYS PAGE THROUGH DIFFERENT VIEWS OF A SHIP. 
 
IMPORTANT:  WHEN YOU HAVE THE BOOK OPEN THE CON (MOVEMENT) CON-
TROLS MAY BE INACTIVE.  THIS IS BECAUSE IN SOME VERSIONS 
(DEPENDING ON YOUR HARDWARE) THE CURSOR KEYS ARE ALSO THE CON 
KEYS.  SEE THE TECHNICAL SUPPLEMENT FOR DETAILS.  
CHART CONTROLS 
 
THE FOLLOWING VIEWING KEYS ARE AVAILABLE WHILE EXAMINING THE 
CHARTS.  SEE PAGES 26-48 FOR A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF THE 
CHARTS. 
 
INITIALLY THE CHART VIEW IS CENTERED ON YOUR BOAT.  HOWEVER, IF 
THE TDC (TORPEDO DATA COMPUTER) IS "ON", INSTEAD THE VIEW IS 
CENTERED HALFWAY BETWEEN YOUR BOAT AND THE TDC TARGET IF BOTH FIT 
ON THE CHART. 
 
RE-CENTER CHART:  TAP THIS KEY TO RE-CENTER YOUR BOAT IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE CHART.  HOWEVER, IF THE TDC IS RUNNING THE VIEW IS 
CENTERED HALFWAY BETWEEN YOUR BOAT AND THE TDC TARGET IF BOTH 
FIT. 
 
ZOOM:  EACH TAP ENLARGES THE CHART, SHOWING A SMALLER AREA, BUT IN 
MORE DETAIL.  THE CHART ALSO RE-CENTERS AUTOMATICALLY. 
 
UNZOOM:  EACH TAP REDUCES THE CHART, SHOWING A LARGER AREA, BUT IN 
LESS DETAIL.  THE CHART ALSO RE-CENTERS AUTOMATICALLY. 
 
INFO PANEL ON/OFF:  THIS KEY SHOWS OR REMOVES THE INFO PANEL FORM 
THE CHART. 
 
SHIP ID BOOK ON/OFF:  THIS KEY SHOWS OR REMOVES THE SHIP ID BOOK 
FROM THE CHART 
 
CON AND ENGINE CONTROLS 
 
YOUR SUBMARINE AUTOMATICALLY USES DIESEL ENGINES WHEN SURFACED AND 
SLOWER ELECTRIC ENGINES WHEN SUBMERGED.  MANEUVERING AND SPEED 
(ENGINES) CONTROLS ARE THE SAME IN BOTH SITUATIONS. 
THE CON - DEPTH CONTROLS 
 
THE "CON" ARE THOSE CONTROLS USED TO STEER YOUR SUBMARINE.  THE 
DEPTH CONTROLS REGULATE YOUR OPERATING DEPTH--FROM SURFACED (0" 
DEPTH) ON DOWN TO MAXIMUM DEPTH. 
 
DIVE:  TAP THIS KEY TO SEND YOUR SUB DOWNWARD.  THIS WILL SUBMERGE 
A SURFACED SUB, OR CAUSE A SUBMERGED SUB TO GO DEEPER.  THE LEVEL 
OFF, TAP EITHER THE STRAIGHT & LEVEL KEY, OR THE RISE KEY. 
 
WARNING:  IF YOU DON'T LEVEL OFF THE SUB EVENTUALLY EITHER HITS 
THE BOTTOM OR IS CRUSHED BY THE OCEAN. 
 
CRASH DIVE:  TAP THIS KEY TO SEND YOUR SUB DOWNWARD QUICKLY.  TO 
LEVEL OFF TAP EITHER STRAIGHT & LEVEL OR RISE. 
 
RISE:  TAP THIS KEY TO SEND YOUR SUB UPWARD.  THIS CAUSES A SUB-
MERGED SUBMARINE TO MOVE UPWARD.  TO LEVEL OFF, TAP EITHER THE 
STRAIGHT & LEVEL KEY OR THE DIVE KEY. 
 
WARNING:  IF YOU DON'T LEVEL OFF THE SUB EVENTUALLY SURFACES. 
 
BLOW ALL TANKS:  TAP THIS KEY TO SURFACE AT MAXIMUM SPEED.  HOWEV-
ER, YOU CAN ONLY DO THIS ONCE IN A BATTLE.  THAT'S BECAUSE THIS 
COMMAND PUMPS ALL YOUR PRESSURIZED AIR INTO THE BALLAST TANKS 
(PUSHING OUT THE WATER THAT KEEPS YOU SUBMERGED).  AFTER GIVING 
THIS COMMAND YOU CANNOT STOP YOUR RISE.  YOU WILL SURFACE, REGARD-
LESS OF SUBSEQUENT COMMANDS. 
 
USEFUL NOTE:  THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO SURFACE IF YOUR DIVING 
PLANES ARE COMPLETELY WRECKED. 
 
STRAIGHT & LEVEL:  TAP THIS KEY TO "LEVEL OFF" YOUR SUB AT ITS 
CURRENT DEPTH.  IT ALSO STOPS ANY STARBOARD OR PORT TURNS AT THE 
SAME TIME. 
 
PERISCOPE DEPTH:  TAP THIS KEY TO SENT YOUR BOAT TO PERISCOPE 
DEPTH.  IF YOU'VE SURFACED, THE BOAT WILL DIVE TO 55', THEN LEVEL 
OUT.  IF YOU'VE UNDERWATER, THE BOAT WILL RISE OR DIVE UNTIL IT 
REACHES PERISCOPE DEPTH OF 55', THE LEVEL OUT.  
 
NOTE THAT UNLIKE ALL OTHER DEPTH CONTROLS, THIS ONE AUTOMATICALLY 
LEVELS YOU ONCE YOU REACH THE DESIRED DEPTH. 
 
MAXIMUM DEPTH:  THE "TEST DEPTH" OF YOUR SUB IS THE MAXIMUM SAFE 
OPERATING DEPTH.  THIS IS THE DEPTH TO WHICH YOUR SUB IS TESTED. 
 
IN REALITY, MAY SUBS WENT DEEPER THAN THEIR TEST DEPTH--SOMETIMES 
AS MUCH AS 50% DEEPER.  HOWEVER, THE DEEPER YOU GO BELOW TEST 
DEPTH, THE GREATER THE CHANCE OF DAMAGE.  IF YOU'RE GOING BELOW 
TEST, WATCH YOUR DAMAGE CONTROL CAREFULLY.  YOU CAN SUFFER BULK-
HEAD DAMAGE IF YOU GO TOO DEEP, OR EVEN DISCOVER THE ENTIRE BOAT 
COLLAPSING INWARD, KILLING BOTH YOU AND YOU CREW. 
ONCE YOUR BULKHEADS ARE DAMAGED (BY GOING TOO DEEP, OR BY ENEMY 
DEPTH CHARGES) YOUR TEST DEPTH IS CUT IN HALF.  IF YOUR TEST DEPTH 
WAS NORMALLY 300', WITH DAMAGED BULKHEADS YOUR NEW TEST DEPTH IS 
150'.  IF YOU GOT BELOW THAT, YOU MAY SUFFER FURTHER DAMAGE OR BE 
SUNK. 
 
THE CON - HEADING (COURSE) CONTROLS 
THE "CON" ALSO ALLOWS YOU TO CONTROL THE HEADING (COURSE) OF YOUR 
SUB. 
 
TURN PORT (LEFT):  TAP THIS KEY TO START YOUR SUB TURNING LEFT.  
THE BOAT CONTINUES TURNING UNTIL YOU ISSUE THE ORDER TO STOP .  TO 
STOP TURNING TAP EITHER TURN STARBOARD (RIGHT), TURN HARD STAR-
BOARD, OR STRAIGHT & LEVEL. 
 
TURN HARD PORT (LEFT FAST):  TAP THIS KEY TO TURN YOUR SUB HARD 
LEFT.  THIS PUTS THE SUB INTO THE TIGHTEST POSSIBLE TURN.  TO STOP 
TURNING YOU CAN TAP EITHER TURN STARBOARD(RIGHT), TURN HARD STAR-
BOARD OR STRAIGHT & LEVEL. 
 
TURN STARBOARD (RIGHT):  TAP THIS KEY TO START YOU SUB TURNING 
RIGHT.  THE BOAT CONTINUES TURNING UNTIL YOU ISSUE THE ORDER TO 
STOP.  TO STOP TURNING TAP EITHER TURN PORT (LEFT), TURN HARD PORT 
OR STRAIGHT & LEVEL. 
 
TURN HARD STARBOARD (RIGHT FAST):  TAP THIS KEY TURN YOUR SUB HARD 
RIGHT.  THIS PUTS THE SUB INTO THE TIGHTEST POSSIBLE TURN.  TO 
STOP TURNING YOU CAN TAP EITHER TURN PORT (LEFT), TURN HARD PORT, 
OR STRAIGHT & LEVEL. 
 
SET COURSE TO VIEW:  THIS KEY TURNS YOUR BOAT UNTIL ITS COURSE 
MATCHES YOUR CURRENT VIEW (BEARING).  IT'S A FAST AND CONVENIENT 
WAY TO ORDER THE BOAT TO TURN ONTO A HEADING. 
 
STRAIGHT AND LEVEL:  THIS KEY STOPS ALL TURNS AND "STRAIGHTENS 
OUT" YOUR COURSE.  IT ALSO STOPS ANY DIVING OR RISING, SO YOUR SUB 
WILL CRUISE AT THE CURRENT DEPTH. 
 
THE ENGINES - SPEED CONTROL 
 
THESE CONTROL THE SPEED OF YOUR SUB.  YOU HAVE FOUR ENGINES.  THE 
NUMBER OF ENGINES "ON LINE" DETERMINES YOUR CURRENT SPEED.  YOU 
SELECT THIS WITH THE ENGINE KEYS.  THE EXACT SPEED, IN KNOTS, 
DEPENDS ON THE TYPE (CLASS) OF SUB. 
 
DIESEL & ELECTRIC POWER:  ON THE SURFACE YOUR SUBMARINE USES 
DIESEL ENGINES, POWERED BY OIL FROM THE OIL TANKS.  YOUR SUB HAS 
ENOUGH OIL FOR 35, 50 OR 60 DAYS OF CRUISING, DEPENDING ON CLASS. 
YOU CONSUME OIL ABOUT FOUR TIMES FASTER IN BATTLE, SINCE THE 
ENGINES ARE NOT RUN AS ECONOMICALLY. 
 
IN WAR PATROLS YOU SHOULD KEEP A CAREFUL EYE ON YOUR OIL CONSUMP-
TION AND REMAINING FUEL (SEE PAGES 39 AND 86). 
SUBMERGED, YOUR SUB USES BATTERIES TO POWER ELECTRIC ENGINES.  
THIS IS BECAUSE DIESELS RUNNING IN A SUBMERGED SUB EXHAUST ALL THE 
AIR WITHIN A FEW MINUTES, WHICH KILLS THE CREW BY ASPHYXIATION. 
 
THE ELECTRIC ENGINES USE BATTLES THAT GRADUALLY RUN DOWN.  THE 
BATTERIES ARE RECHARGED BY RUNNING THE DIESEL ENGINES WHEN YOU'RE 
BACK ON THE SURFACE.  DIESELS NOT USED TO MOVE THE SUB ARE USED 
INSTEAD TO RECHARGE THE BATTERIES. 
 
AHEAD FLANK (4 ENGINES):  THIS IS YOUR MAXIMUM FORWARD SPEED.  
SUBMERGED IT USES UP YOUR BATTER POWER VERY QUICKLY.  ON THE 
SURFACE, ALL ENGINES ARE USED TO DRIVE THE SUB, SO THE BATTERIES 
CANNOT BE RECHARGED. 
 
AHEAD FULL (3 ENGINES):  THIS IS A FAST FORWARD SPEED.  SUBMERGED, 
IT USED UP BATTERIES RATHER QUICKLY.  ON THE SURFACE, THREE EN-
GINES DRIVE THE SUB, WHILE ONLY ONE RECHARGES THE BATTERIES. 
 
AHEAD HALF (2 ENGINES) THIS IS A MODERATE FORWARD SPEED.  SUB-
MERGED IT USES UP BATTERIES AT A MODERATE RATE.  ON THE SURFACE, 
TWO ENGINES DRIVE THE SUB AND TWO RECHARGE THE BATTERIES. 
 
AHEAD SLOW (1 ENGINE):  THIS IS YOUR SLOWEST FORWARD SPEED.  
SUBMERGED, IT USED UP BATTERIES VERY SLOWLY.  ON THE SURFACE, ONE 
ENGINE DRIVES THE BOAT WHILE THREE RECHARGE BATTERIES. 
 
ALL STOP (0 ENGINES):  YOU SUBMARINE STOPS IN PLACE. SUBMERGED 
YOUR BATTERIES ARE HARDLY REDUCED AT ALL (ONLY MINOR ELECTRICAL 
SYSTEMS DRAW CURRENT).  ON THE SURFACE, ALL DIESEL ENGINES ARE 
USED TO RECHARGE THE BATTERIES. 
 
REVERS (-4 ENGINES)  YOUR SUB MOVES BACKWARDS AT A SLOW SPEED.  
UNFORTUNATELY, DUE TO GEARING IMITATIONS ALL ENGINES MUST BE USED. 
THEREFORE YOUR BATTERIES ARE REDUCED QUICKLY, AND ON THE SURFACE 
ALL DIESEL ENGINES ARE USED FOR REVERSE MOVEMENT.  HOWEVER, SUBS 
RARELY MOVE IN REVERSE EXCEPT IN SHORT PERIODS. 
 
FIRING TORPEDOES 

TORPEDOES ARE YOUR MAIN WEAPON.  THEY CAN BE FIRED EITHER AT A 
"MARKED" TARGET OR USING A "MANUAL PLOT".  MOST CAPTAINS PREFER TO 
USE THE EASIER "MARKED" TECHNIQUE. 
 
TORPEDO FIRING TECHNIQUES 
 
"MARK" TARGET FIRING PROCEDURE:  THIS TECHNIQUE IS THE EASIEST AND 
MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD METHOD OF FIRING.  IT USES YOUR BOAT'S TDC 
(TORPEDO DATA COMPUTER) TO CORRECTLY SET YOUR TORPEDOES.  YOU JUST 
LINE UP A TARGET IN YOUR 
PERISCOPE OR TBE, TURN ON THE TDC, AND FIRE. 
 
FIRST YOU GO TO THE PERISCOPE OR BRIDGE TBT VIEW AND ROTATE (USING 
VIEW LEFT AND VIEW RIGHT) UNTIL YOU FIND A TARGET.  WHEN THE 
VESSEL IS CENTERED IN YOUR VIEW, THE AIMING SCALE BRIGHTENS AND 
THE INFO PANEL DISPLAYS TARGET INFORMATION (RANGE, COURSE AND 
SPEED).  THIS MEANS THE TARGET IS "MARKED". 
 
QUICKLY, WHILE THE TARGET IS STILL MARKED, TAP THE TDC ON/OFF KEY 
TO TURN YOUR TDC.  THIS CAUSES THE PERISCOPE OR TBT TO FOLLOW THE 
TARGET AUTOMATICALLY WHILE THE INFO PANEL UPDATES THE TARGET DATA 
AND TORPEDO FIRING SOLUTION CONTINUALLY.  THE INFO PANEL TDC LIGHT 
SHOWS THAT THE TDC IS RUNNING IN ADDITION, THE TORPEDO AIMING 
POINTER APPEARS ON THE PERISCOPE OR TBT CROSSHAIRS. 
 
WHEN THE RANGE AND FIRING POSITION SEEM GOOD TO YOU (AS CAPTAIN), 
TAP FIRE TORPEDO. 
 
TO FIRE A "SPREAD" OF TORPEDOES, USE THE VIEW LEFT AND VIEW RIGHT 
KEYS TO MOVE THE TORPEDO AIMING POINTER LEFT AND RIGHT OF CENTER. 
THIS SETS THE TORPEDO PATH SLIGHTLY LEFT OR RIGHT OF CENTER, 
CREATING A "SPREAD".  YOU MUST DO THIS WHILE THE TDC IS ON.  THIS 
TECHNIQUE DOESN'T WORK IF THE TDC IS OFF. 
 
TO SWITCH TARGETS, TURN OFF THE TDC BY PRESSING TDC ON/OFF AGAIN. 
ROTATE YOUR VIEW, "MARK" ANOTHER TARGET AND TURN ON THE TDC ONCE 
MORE. 
 
AFTER FIRING, YOU'LL SEE ON THE CHARTS VIEW THE TORPEDO TIMER 
COUNTING DOWN.  THE TDC LIGHT BESIDE THE TIMER WILL BE ON IF THE 
TORPEDO WAS FIRED UNDER TDC CONTROL.  THE TIMER IS COUNTING DOWN 
TO THE ANTICIPATED CONTACT WITH THE TARGET. 
 
"MANUAL PLOT" FIRING PROCEDURE:  IN THIS TECHNIQUE YOU COMPUTER 
FIRING ANGLES YOURSELF.  THIS TECHNIQUES DOES NOT USE THE TDC.  
MAKE SURE THE TDC IS NOT RUNNING (THE TDC LIGHT IS OFF ON THE INFO 
PANEL) BEFORE USING MANUAL FIRING. 
 
THIS METHOD IS EASIEST TO PLAN FORM THE CHARTS.  YOU DECIDE WHAT 
ANGLE TO FIRE A TORPEDO SO IT INTERCEPTS THE ENEMY SHIP'S COURSE. 
TO DO THIS, YOU'LL NEED TO ESTIMATE HOW QUICKLY THE TORPEDO TRAV-
ELS IN RELATION TO HOW FAST THE TARGET IS MOVING, AND THEN FIRE AT 
THE APPROPRIATE INSTANT.  FOR A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF HOW TO 
PLAN A MANUAL SHOT, SEE PAGES 69-72. 
 
IN MANUAL PLOTTING, THE TORPEDO FIRES IN YOUR VIEW DIRECTION 
(BEARING).  THE CREW SELECTS BOW OR STERN TUBERS, WHICHEVER 
IS CLOSER TO YOUR VIEW BEARING.  IF THE TUBES ARE EMPTY, THE CREW 
REPORTS THIS FACT AND DOESN'T SHOOT.  YOU MUST EITHER CHANGE YOUR 
HEADING OR BEARING TO USE THE OTHER TUBES. 
FIRING RANGES:  MINIMUM TORPEDO RANGE IS 300 YARDS.  A GOOD FIRING 
RANGE IS 600 TO 1200 YARDS, DEPENDING ON TORPEDO MODEL AND SITUA-
TION.  AT RANGES OVER 2000 YARDS TORPEDOES ARE UNLIKELY TO HIT A 
MOVING TARGET.  MAXIMUM RANGE IS 3500 TO 9000 YARDS, DEPENDING ON 
THE TORPEDO MODEL.  SEE PAGES 114-115 FOR DETAILED INFO ON ALL 
TORPEDOES. 
 
FIRING POSITION:  NORMALLY THE IDEAL FIRING POSITION IS STRAIGHT 
INTO THE SIDE OF A SHIP.  FIRING AT AN ANGLE TOWARD THE BROADSIDE 
IS THE NEXT BEST (AND GIVES EARLY MARK 14S A BETTER CHANCE OF 
EXPLODING).  SHOOTING AT THE BOW OF AN ONCOMING SHIP IS TRICKY 
BECAUSE THE TARGET AREA IS QUITE NARROW.  SHOOTING AT THE STERN OF 
A SHIP IS THE WORST POSSIBLE SHOT, SINCE THE TORPEDO MUST OVERTAKE 
ITS TARGET. 
 
EARLY VERSIONS OF THE MARK 14 SOMETIMES EXPLODED PREMATURELY.  
THIS WAS GENERALLY CAUSED BY THE DEFECTIVE MAGNETIC EXPLODER.  
DEPENDING ON THE SUBMARINE COMMAND, THIS DEFECT IS IDENTIFIED AND 
FIXED SOMETIME IN 1943. 
 
TORPEDO FIRING COMMANDS 
 
MARKING A TARGET:  YOU DO THIS BY CENTERING THE TARGET IN YOUR 
PERISCOPE OR TBT.  THE TARGET IS "MARKED" WHEN THE AIMING SCALE IS 
LIGHTED AND TARGET DATA APPEARS IN THE INFO PANEL. 
 
TDC ON/OFF:  THIS TOGGLES THE TDC (TORPEDO DATA COMPUTER) ON AND 
OFF.  THE TDC CAN BE "TURNED ON" ONLY FROM THE PERISCOPE OR BRIDGE 
TBT VIEW.  FURTHERMORE, YOU MUST HAVE A TARGET "MARKED" OR ELSE 
THE TDC WON'T START.  A TARGET IS "MARKED" WHEN THE AIMING SCALE 
BRIGHTENS AND THE INFO PANEL BEGINS DISPLAYING TARGET DATA. 
 
YOU CAN ADJUST YOUR VIEW WHILE THE TDC IS RUNNING.  THIS MOVES 
THE TORPEDO AIMING PINT LEFT OR RIGHT, CAUSING THE TDC TO AIM THE 
TORPEDO LEFT OR RIGHT OF THE TARGET.  IF YOU MOVE THE VIEW SO FAR 
THAT THE TARGET IS NO LONGER VISIBLE THE TDC AUTOMATICALLY TURNS 
OFF. 
 
YOU CAN MANUALLY TURN OFF THE TDC BY TAPPING TDC ON/OFF AGAIN. 

TO SWITCH A NEW TARGET, TURN OFF THE TDC, "MARK" A NEW TARGET, 
THEN TURN ON THE TDC ONCE MORE. 
 
CHANGE TORPEDO SPEED:  NORMALLY YOUR TORPEDOES ARE SET FOR THE 
FASTEST POSSIBLE SPEED.  IN ALL NORMAL FIRING CIRCUMSTANCES THIS 
IS THE CORRECT. 
 
CHANGE TORPEDO SPEED:  NORMALLY YOUR TORPEDOES ARE SET FOR THE 
FASTEST POSSIBLE SPEED.  IN ALL NORMAL FIRING CIRCUMSTANCES THIS 
IS THE CORRECT CHOICE.  HOWEVER, THE MARK 14 TORPEDO HAS SLOWER 
SPEED THAT GIVES IT MUCH MORE RANGE THAN THE 4500 AT HIGH SPEED.  
IF YOU THINK THE TORPEDO NEEDS TO TRAVEL FURTHER, TAP THIS KEY TO 
SET THE TORPEDOES TO LOW SPEED (31.5 KTS) AND 9000 YARDS RANGE. 
THIS KEY HAS NOT EFFECT ON MARK 10 AND MARK 18 TORPEDOES, WHICH 
ONLY HAVE ONE SPEED. 
 
AIM TORPEDOES:  YOU MUST HAVE THE TDC ON (SEE ABOVE) TO AIM TORPE-
DOES. USE THE VIEW LEFT AND VIEW RIGHT TO MOVE TORPEDO AIMING 
POINTER LEFT OR RIGHT OF THE TARGET. 
 
FIRE TORPEDO: THIS FIRES A LOADED TORPEDO TUBE. BOW TUBES ARE USED 
FOR FIRING AT TARGETS IN THE 180 DEGREE ARC AHEAD OF THE BOAT, 
STERN TUBES FOR TARGETS IN THE 180 DEGREE ARC BEHIND THE BOAT.  IF 
ALL TUBES IN THE APPROPRIATE DIRECTION ARE EMPTY AND/OR RELOADING, 
YOU CANNOT FIRE IN THAT DIRECTION. 
 
IF YOU FIRE WHILE THE TDC IS RUNNING (INFO PANEL TDC LIGHT IS 
"ON") THE TDC (TORPEDO DATA COMPUTER) AUTOMATICALLY COMPUTES THE 
CORRECT COURSE FOR THE TORPEDO.  AFTER THE TORPEDO LEAVES THE TUBE 
IF TURNS ONTO COURSE AND HEADS FOR A PRE-CALCULATED INTERCEPTION 
POINT WITH THE TARGET. 
 
ON THE CHARTS VIEW YOU'LL SEE A TIMER FOR THAT TORPEDO COUNTING 
DOWN TO THE PREDICTED INTERCEPTION TIME.  THE TDC LIGHT BESIDE THE 
TIMER WILL BE ON INDICATING THE TORPEDO FIRED UNDER TDC CONTROL. 
 
IF YOU FIRE WHEN THE TDC IS OFF (INFO PANEL TDC LIGHT IS "OFF"), 
THE TORPEDO FIRES STRAIGHT OUT OF THE BOW OR STERN. IT CONTINUES 
STRAIGHT AHEAD UNTIL IT RUNS OUT OF FUEL OR HITS A TARGET. THE BOW 
TUBES FIRE IF YOUR CURRENT VIEW BEARING IS CLOSER TO THE BOW THAN 
THE STERN. THE STERN TUBES TIRE IF YOUR CURRENT VIEW BEARING IS 
CLOSER TO THE STERN THAN THE BOW. 
 
ON THE CHARTS VIEW YOU'LL SEE A TIMER FOR THE TORPEDO COUNTING 
DOWN THE PREDICTED TIME WHEN THE TORPEDO'S FUEL IS EXHAUSTED. THE 
TDC LIGHT BESIDE THE TIMER WILL BE OFF, INDICATING THE TORPEDO WAS 
FIRED UNDER MANUAL CONTROL. 
 
DECK GUN CONTROLS 
 
YOUR DECK GUN IS SECONDARY ARMAMENT. ITS SHELLS ARE NOWHERE NEAR 
AS POWERFUL AS YOUR TORPEDOES.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, YOU MUST SURFACE 
TO USE THE DECK GUN, WHICH EXPOSES YOUR SUB TO HOSTILE GUNFIRE.  
ANY WARSHIP LARGER THAN A PATROL BOAT (PC) HAS BETTER GUN ARMA-
MENT.  THEREFORE, MOST SUBMARINES ONLY USE THEIR DECK GUN TO 
"POLISH OFF" DAMAGED MERCHANTMEN, OR IF THEY'RE EXTREMELY DESPER-
ATE. 
 
DECK GUN FIRING TECHNIQUES 
 
 
YOU CAN FIRE YOUR DECK GUN WHENEVER THE SUBMARINE IS ON THE SUR-
FACE.  YOU SHOULD USE THE TBT VIEW WHEN FIRING, SINCE THE GUN 
CONTROLS ARE VISIBLE THERE. TO FIRE THE DECK GUN, AIM AT THE 
TARGET UNTIL IT IS "MARKED", TURN ON THE 
TDC, ADJUST THE GUN ELEVATION, THEN FIRE.  ON SUBSEQUENT SHOTS YOU 
SIMPLY ADJUST THE ELEVATION IF NECESSARY AND FIRE AGAIN. 
 
MAXIMUM RANGE OF YOU DECK GUN IS 4000 YARDS.  THIS LIMIT IS DUE TO 
THE SUBMARINE'S GUN-MOUNTING AND SIGHTS; THE SIZE OF THE GUN HAS 

NO EFFECT ON MAXIMUM RANGE. 
 
UNMARKED TARGETS CANNOT BE HIT BY YOUR DECK GUN.  THE TARGET MUST 
BE MARKED AND TRACKED BY THE TDC BEFORE YOUR CAN FIRE.  THIS 
REPRESENTS THE GUN CREW RANGING AND FOLLOWING THE TARGET. 
MARKED TARGETS: A TARGET IS "MARKED" WHEN THE AIMING SCALE IS 
HIGHLIGHTED AND TARGET DATA APPEARS IN THE INFO PANEL. 
 
TDC AND GUNFIRE: YOU MUST USE YOUR TDC TO CONTINUALLY TRACK A 
"MARKED" TARGET.  WHEN THE TARGETS IS "MARKED", TAP TDC ON/OFF.  
THIS AUTOMATICALLY KEEPS YOU AIMED AT THE TARGET.  YOUR GUN CREW 
ELEVATES THE GUN TO THE CURRENT RANGE OF THE TARGET (AS SHOWN IN 
"TARGET RANGE" ON THE INFO PANEL). TO STOP TRACKING JUST TURN OFF 
THE TDC BY TAPPING TDC ON/OFF AGAIN 
 
ADJUSTING FIRE:  YOUR GUN CREW AIMS AT THE TARGET'S LOCATION, 
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT WHETHER IT'S MOVING LEFT OR RIGHT ACROSS YOUR 
VIEW.  HOWEVER, THE CREW DOES NOT ADJUST FOR THE TARGET'S MOTION 
TOWARD OR AWAY FROM YOU. 
 
IF YOU FEEL THE ENEMY IS MOVING TOWARD YOU, DEPRESS THE GUN ONE OR 
MORE DEGREES (-1 OR MORE).  IF THE ENEMY IS MOVING AWAY, ELEVATE 
THE GUN ONE OR MORE DEGREES MORE (+1 OR MORE).  THE FASTER ENEMY 
IS CLOSING OR OPENING THE RANGE, THE MORE DEPRESSION OR ELEVATION 
YOU NEED. 
 
NOTE THAT IF A TARGET IS CLOSING FAST, EVEN THOUGH YOU DEPRESS THE 
GUN A LARGE AMOUNT, YOU MAY FIND SHOTS STILL LANDING BEHIND THE 
TARGET (BECAUSE OF HIS HIGH SPEED).  CONVERSELY, IF A TARGET IS 
FLEEING FAST, YOUR SHOTS FREQUENTLY LAND BEHIND HIM UNTIL YOU 
APPLY SUFFICIENT ELEVATION. 
 
DECK GUN FIRING CONTROLS 
 
MARKING A TARGET:  CENTER THE TARGET IN YOU TBT.  THE TARGET IS 
"MARKED" WHEN THE CROSSHAIRS ARE LIGHTED AND TARGET DATA APPEARS 
IN THE INFO PANEL. 
 
TDC ON/OFF:  THIS TOGGLES THE TDC ON AND OFF. YOU MUST HAVE A 
TARGET "MARKED" IN THE TBT VIEW TO TURN ON THE TDC. 
 
WHILE THE TDC IS RUNNING YOUR VIEW AND THE DECK GUN CREW'S AIM 
ROTATES TO FOLLOW THE TARGET.  FURTHERMORE, THE GUN CREW AUTOMATI-
CALLY ELEVATES THE GUN TO HIT AT THE CURRENT RANGE (SHOWN ON THE 
INFO PANEL).  THE CREW DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT RANGE CHANGES.  

YOU MUST ESTIMATE HOW FAST THE RANGE IS 
CHANGING, AND MAKE THE APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENT TO ELEVA-
TION/DEPRESSION.  ALTHOUGH THE TORPEDO AIMING POINTER IS PRESENT 
TO ADJUST I DON'T NEED IT WITH THE DECK GUN (THE GUN CREW AUTOMAT-
ICALLY ROTATES TO TRACK THE TARGET). 
 
YOU CAN MANUALLY TURN OFF THE TDC BY TAPPING TDC ON/OFF A SECOND 
TIME. 
 
TO SWITCH TO A NEW TARGET, TURN OFF THE TDC, "MARK" A NEW TARGET, 
THEN TURN ON THE TDC ONCE MORE. 
 
GUN DOWN (-) 1 DEGREE: EACH TAP OF THIS KEY DEPRESSES (LOWERS) THE 
GUN BARREL BY ONE DEGREE.  THIS DECREASES THE DISTANT TRAVELLED BY 
THE SHELL. 
 
WHEN FIRING AT A MARKED TARGET, THE BARREL IS LOWERED IN RELATION 
TO THE CREW'S NORMAL FIRING ANGLE.  YOU LOWER THE GUN ONLY IF 
YOU'RE FIRING AT A "MARKED" TARGET THAT'S MOVING TOWARD YOU. 
 
GUN UP (+) 1 DEGREE:EACH TAP OF THIS KEY ELEVATES (RAISES) THE GUN 
BARREL BY ONE DEGREE. THIS INCREASES THE DISTANCE TRAVELLED BY THE 
SHELL. 
                                                                  
WHEN FIRING AT A MARKED TARGET, THE BARREL IS RAISED IN RELATION 
TO THE CREW'S NORMAL FIRING ANGLE.  YOU RAISE THE GUN ONLY IF 
YOU'RE FIRING AT A "MARKED" TARGET THAT'S MOVING AWAY FROM YOU. 
 
FIRE DECK GUN : THIS FIRES ONE SHELL AT THE ENEMY (ON NARWHAL 
CLASS SUBS IT FIRES A BROADSIDE OF BOTH GUNS IN CLOSE SUCCESSION). 
THE GUN ONLY FIRES IT A TARGET IS "MARKED" AND/OR THE TDC IS ON 

AND FOLLOWING A TARGET.  
THE SHELL FIRES AT THE MARKED TARGET'S CURRENT POSITION PLUS OR 
MINUS A CERTAIN DISTANCE DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF ELEVATION OR 

DEPRESSION CURRENTLY SET.  
IF THE SHELL HITS, YOU'LL SEE AN EXPLOSION ON THE TARGET SHIP.  IF 
IT MISSES YOU'LL SEE A WATER-SPOUT. 
 
ENEMY GUNFIRE 
 
WHILE YOU'RE ON THE SURFACE, ENEMY WARSHIPS OR ARMED MERCHANTMEN 
MAY FIRE BACK AT YOUR SUB. IF WATER-SPOUTS APPEAR, ENEMY SHELLS 
ARE LANDING NEAR YOUR BOAT.  EVENTUALLY HE'LL FIND THE RANGE AND 
BEGIN SCORING HITS, CAUSING DAMAGE AND EVENTUALLY SINKING YOU. THE 
ONLY DEFENSES ARE TO (A) DAMAGE THE ENEMY SO BADLY HIS AIM OR GUNS 
ARE DESTROYED, OR (B) SUBMERGE.  ONCE YOU REACH PERISCOPE DEPTH 
(50-55') YOU'RE INVULNERABLE TO ENEMY GUNFIRE.  
BEWARE OF ENEMY CRUISERS AND BATTLESHIPS. THEIR GUNS ARE SO POWER-
FUL THAT ONE HIT COULD BLOW YOUR BOAT RIGHT OUT OF THE WATER! 

LAUNCHING DEBRIS 

WHEN YOU'RE SUBMERGED AND UNDER DEPTH CHARGE ATTACK, YOU MAY WANT 
TO DECEIVE THE ENEMY INTO THINKING YOU'RE DEAD.  ONE TRICK IS 
TO LOAD YOUR TORPEDO TUBES WITH VARIOUS EXTRA ITEMS (DEBRIS), AND 
LAUNCH IT. WHEN THIS FLOATS TO THE SURFACE, THE ENEMY MAY THINK 
YOU'RE SUNK.  
TO ATTEMPT THIS DECEPTION, TAP THE LAUNCH DEBRIS KEY. 
 
YOU CAN DO THIS ONLY ONCE PER BATTLE, AND IT MAY NOT WORK.  
END THIS BATTLE 
 
TAP THIS KEY TO END A BATTLE.  YOU CANNOT USE THIS TO ESCAPE 
POSSIBLE ATTACKS -- IF ENEMIES ARE STILL IN REASONABLE PROXIMITY, 
YOU CANNOT END THE BATTLE.  IN THIS CASE, SAIL AWAY FROM THE 
ENEMY AS QUICKLY AS YOU FELL PRUDENT, THEN TRY AGAIN

FINAL RETURN TO PORT. AS IN A NORMAL WAR PATROL, PRESS ANY KEY TO 
SEE WHAT YOU EARNED FOR THE PATROL.  PRESS AGAIN TO SEE THE SUBMA-
RINER'S HALL OF FAME. 
 
SCORING 
 
TONNAGE:  DURING WWII THE US NAVY USED TONNAGE SUNK AS A METHOD   
OF MEASURING SUCCESS IN THE SUBMARINE FORCE.  THE MOST SUCCESSFUL 
CAPTAIN WAS THE ONE WHO SANK THE MOST TONNAGE.  MERCHANT AND 
MILITARY TONNAGE ARE RATED EQUALLY.  NOTE THAT THIS RATING DOES 
NO@ TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ENEMIES DAMAGED BUT NOT SUNK, OR THE DIFFI-
CULTY OF ACHIEVING THOSE SINKINGS. 
 
POINT SCORE: AS IN MOST MICROPROSE SIMULATIONS, SILENT SERVICE II 
HAS A COMPLEX FORMULA FOR SCORING YOUR PERFORMANCE. YOU RECEIVE A 
"POINT VALUE" FOR EACH ENEMY SHIP DAMAGED OR SUNK. 
THE VALUE OF ASW(ANTI-SUBMARINE WARFARE) VESSELS IS BASED ON THEIR 
CAPABILITIES. THE MORE POWERFUL THE SHIP, THE MORE IT IS WORTH.  
THEREFORE DDS AND DDAAS ARE WORTH MORE THAN DES, WHO IN TURN ARE 
WORTH MORE THAN PCS.
 
MANUAL TORPEDO FIRE 
 
IN REAL LIFE SOME CAPTAINS FIRED TORPEDOES WITHOUT USING THE TDC. 
INSTEAD THEY USED THE CHARTS, PLOTTED THE PROSPECTIVE COURSE OF 
THE ENEMY SHIP, AND SET UP THE APPROPRIATE TORPEDO INTERCEPT 
COURSE. YOU CAN DO THIS TOO. A RULER, PROTRACTOR (TO MEASURE 
ANGLES), AND SCRATCH PAPER WERE THE TRADITIONAL TOOLS USED BY THE 
"PLOT CREW" IN REAL SUBMARINES. WITH A RULER YOU'LL FIND THAT 1"  
EQUALS = 1000 YDS IS A USEFUL SCALE (THAT IS, 1/2" EQUALS 500 
YARDS, 1/4 EQUALS 250 YDS, 1/8" EQUALS 125 YDS AND 1/16" EQUALS 
67.5 YDS). 
 
AS YOU'LL SEE, MANUAL COMPUTATION TAKES TIME AND WORK, AND IS 
SOMEWHAT INACCURATE.  THE TDC SOLVES MOST OF THESE PROBLEMS FOR 
YOU.  FURTHERMORE, THE METHOD BELOW IS DESIGNED FOR GOOD SETUPS--
FIRING STRAIGHT INTO THE BROADSIDE OF A SHIP.  HOWEVER, YOU CAN 
USE VARIANTS OF THIS METHOD TO CALCULATE SHOTS AT ANY ANGLE. 
 
PLOT:  YOU START BY MARKING YOUR POSITION, A BEARING LINE TO THE 
ENEMY'S INITIAL POSITION, AND BY MEASURING THE RANGE.  THIS GIVES 
YOU THE ENEMY'S STARTING LOCATION.  NOW DRAW A LINE FROM THERE 
ALONG THE ENEMY'S COURSE. 
 
FIRING RANGE:  NEXT PLOT A LINE FROM YOUR SUB TO THE ENEMY'S 
COURSE.  IF YOU HAVE A TRIANGLE, SLIDE IT ALONG THE ENEMY'S COURSE 
UNTIL THE RIGHT-ANGLE SIDE INTERSECTS WITH YOUR SUB.  THE LINE 
ALONG THAT SIDE IS THE TORPEDO'S PATH FROM YOUR SHIP TO THE TAR-
GET.  MEASURE THIS LINE TO DETERMINE THE FIRING RANGE. 
 
ALSO MEASURE WITH A PROTRACTOR THE DIRECTION OF FIRE.  TURN YOUR 
SUB UNTIL IT'S HEADING IN THIS DIRECTION.  THIS MEANS THE TORPE-
DOES DON'T HAVE TO TURN LEFT OR RIGHT AFTER THEY LEAVE YOUR BOAT. 
 
IF THE FIRING RANGE SEEMS TOO LONG, MOVE YOUR SUB ALONG THE LINE 
OF FIRE, CLOSING THE RANGE.  
FIRING BEARING:  ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR FIRING RANGE AND HEADING, YOU 
NEED TO CALCULATE WHEN TO FIRE.  YOU START BY COMPUTING HOW LONG 
THE TORPEDO TAKES TO RUN FROM YOUR SUB TO THE INTERCEPTION POINT. 
ONE KNOT OF SPEED MEANS MOVEMENT OF 0.555 YARDS PER SECOND.  (SEE 
THE BOX TO THE BELOW FOR SPEEDS OF ALL TORPEDOES.) 

PATROL STRATEGY 
 
THE FIRST STEP TO GOOD STRATEGY IS KNOWING THE ENEMY. THEN EVALU-
ATE YOUR OWN CAPABILITIES, EXAMINE THE COMBINATIONS, AND CREATE A 
PLAN FOR SINKING THE MOST ENEMY SHIPS AT THE LEAST RISK.  MANY 
WERE SUCCESSFUL, BUT FEW SURVIVED THE WAR.  
JAPANESE NAVAL TRAFFIC 
 
JAPANESE WARSHIP ANCHORED IN PROTECTED HARBORS UNTIL A MAJOR 
MILITARY OPERATION BEGAN. EVERY FEW YEARS, OR AFTER MAJOR BATTLE 
DAMAGE A SHIP WOULD RETURN TO THE NAVAL YARDS IN JAPAN FOR OVER-
HAUL. IN JAPAN THE LARGE FLEET ANCHORAGES WERE TOKYO BAY AND THE 
KURE NAVY YARD. DURING 1942 AND EARLY 1943 TRUK AND RABAUL WERE 
THE FRONT-LINE BASES. LATER IN 1943 THROUGH MIDDLE 1944 THE FLEET 
FELL BACK TO YAP AND PALAU. LATER IN 1944 IT FELL BACK AGAIN TO 
BRUNEI AND BALIKPAPAN. AFTER LEYTE GULF THE FLEET WAS LARGELY 
DESTROYED, WITH THE REMNANTS FLEEING EITHER TO JAPAN, OR SOUTH TO 
SINGAPORE AND CAM RANH BAY ON THE INDOCHINA COAST. 
 
AT VARIOUS TIMES IN THE WAR THE JAPANESE FLEET LEFT PORT TO GIVE 
BATTLE. IT WAS ESPECIALLY ACTIVE IN EARLY 1942, SECURING THE 
CONQUEST OF THE SOUTHWESTERN PACIFIC FROM BURMA TO NEW GUINEA, 
THEN IN LATER 1942 SUPPORTING THE FIGHTING IN THE SOLOMONS. THERE 
WERE NO MAJOR NAVAL BATTLES IN 1943. IN 1944 BOTH THE FLEET AND 
NAVAL AIR FORCES WERE WIPED OUT IN TWO MAJOR BATTLES (THE FILIPI-
NO SEA AND LEYTE GULF). 
 
THE SOLOMONS CAMPAIGN FROM AUGUST TO NOVEMBER 1942 WAS AN ADDI-
TIONAL EXCEPTION TO THE NORMAL PATTERN OF JAPANESE MOVEMENTS.  
HERE THE "TOKYO EXPRESS", COMPOSED OF DESTROYERS AND SOMETIMES A 
LIGHT CRUISER, RACED AT HIGH SPEED FROM RABAUL OR THE SHORTLANDS 
TO GUADALCANAL, THEN BACK AGAIN.  AT ITS PEAK THE TOKYO EXPRESS 
RAN TWO OR THREE TIMES A WEEK.  
JAPANESE MERCHANT SHIPPING AND ASW FORCES 
 
THE IMPERIAL JAPANESE NAVY APPROACHED THE PROBLEM OF SUBMARINE 
QUITE DIFFERENTLY FROM THE ALLIES.         
IN THE FIRST YEAR OR TWO OF WAR, AMERICAN SUBMARINE PERFORMANCE 
WAS POOR.  THIS WAR PARTLY DUE TO FEW FLEET BOATS ON PATROL AND 
PARTLY BECAUSE OF POOR MARK 14 TORPEDO PERFORMANCE.  AS A RESULT, 
THE JAPANESE LOST FEW SHIPS, WHICH INSPIRED NO MORE THAN MODEST 
ASW (ANTI-SUBMARINE WARFARE) EFFORTS.  AS AMERICAN SUBS BECAME 
MORE EFFECTIVE THE JAPANESE TRIED TO INCREASE THEIR ANTI-SUBMARINE 
MEASURES. 
 
PORT PATROLS:  JAPAN'S FIRST ASW POLICY WAS REGULAR ANTI-SUBMARINE 
PATROLS AROUND MAJOR PORTS.  PORTS ARE NATURAL "CONGREGATION 
POINTS" FOR SHIPS.
