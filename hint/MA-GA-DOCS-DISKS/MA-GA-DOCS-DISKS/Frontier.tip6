The theory is proved.
To test it out, try firing (I tried 20mw beam) laser when your internal tank
is empty, guess what:
IT Wont Work...

Its got to get its power from somewhere....

Well allright. But only if you promise not to use it.

You'll only need one cheat. : - Buy an extra passenger cabin
			      - Get a passenger (any one, it doesn't matter)
			      - Sell your ship  (buy the cheapest one around)
			      - Collect the refund.
			      - Receive your old ship back since you can't
			        sell it with a passenger onboard.
			      - Keep the money.

That's all folks.

	I'm quite happy to do this. The only reason that I haven't is that given the
number of people who are posting stuff about Frontier I assumed that someone would
have already sent the buglists posted on the net to Dino Dini.  

Has anybody done this?

If no-one claims to have done this in the next few days, I'll do it.

Where the hell is it?? I found Part I, but not part two? 
Could someone gimme the post #, so I can locate it ...

Unlike some of the posters here, I havn't really gotten a high Elite ranking
yet. I guess I should get a few more kills ... But my Lion Transporter isn't
really very good at fighting. It manouvers like a brick, and even with 10(!)
Shield Generators and an Energy Booster Unit, I'm still an easy prey for
most pirates or whatever ... kinda sucks...

In Elite, ROC's are awarded on the basis of ``kill points''.  The
different ships are worth different point values.  If I remember
correctly, its 3 ROC's for Competent, 8 ROC's for Dangerous, 16 ROC's
for Deadly and a total of 32 for ELITE.

   After reading the first part of the guide , I compared the list of
   Gazetteer worlds with my own . Seemed to be a few differences ,
   although most were only a sector or so out . ( Except for Zeessze - 
   I think they gave Zeessce co-ords by mistake ).

   Anyway here is my list (including the few marked unknown before)..

   ACHENAR		[ 1 , -4 ]
   Ackwada		[ -5 , -3 ]
   Ackcanphi		[ -4 , -4 ]
   Alioth		[ 0 , 4 ]

   Arexack		[ -1 , -5 ]
   Ayethti		[ -3 , -1 ]
   Aymiay		[ 1 , 4 ]
   Bedaho		[ -4 , -2 ]
   Beta Hydri		[ 0 , -2 ]
   Cemiess		[ -2 , -2 ]
   Enaness		[ -5 , 1 ]
   Epsilon Eridani	[ 1 , 0 ]
   Eta Cassiopeia	[ 0 , 2 ]
   Exbeur		[ -3 , 4 ]
   Exioce		[ -1 , -3 ]
   Extila		[ -4 , -1 ]
   Facece		[ 0 , -4 ]
   Fawaol		[ 2 , -3 ]
   Laedla		[ -4 , 1 ]
   Lave			[ -3 , -6 ]
   Liaedin		[ 4 , 3 ]
   Liaququ		[ 2 , -2 ]
   Phekda		[ 2 , 5 ]
   Phiagre		[ 1 , -3 ]
   Quince		[ -1 , -5 ]
   Quphieth		[ -3 , 0 ]
   Ququve		[ 1 , 4 ]
   Riedquat		[ -3 , -6 ]
   Ross 128		[ 0 , 0 ]
   Ross 154		[ -1 , 0 ]
   Sirius		[ 1 , 0 ]
   Tau Ceti		[ 0 , 0 ]
   Tiliala		[ -4 , -1 ]

   Zearla		[ -5 , 1 ]
   Zeessze		[ 0 , 3 ]
   Zelada		[ 1 , 4 ]
   SOL			[ 0 , 0 ]


	Also , the game seems to have a problem with a large number of
	objects near your ship . A few times I've got a guru when mining
	asteroids . Not really important - I was just bored and trying a 
	few things out .

No arcade features! PRIVATEER!!! You can't be serious. There is MUCH
combat in Privateer, and there is no choice whether you want to fight
or not.

The bug reports on Frontier, which many of you mailed to me, have now
been sent in one batch to David Braben by Snail Mail.

I will be accepting no further mail on the subject for the time being,
the mail has pretty much dried up anyway, but I am sure David Braben
will be grateful for your comments.

The total mail messages passed on to David Braben was 38 from 32 different
people.

Please note that the channel of communication was only one way... this is
why I have not been able to give replys to specific questions.

Best Regards,

Dino Dini

I understand this but it would have been nice to hear
at least a simple 'thank you' from braben with maybe
a line or two on the hot question:
WILL there be Frontier bugfixes/upgrades and when/how they
will come...

Just in case: If you happen to hear anything like this, It
would be very nice to get it to here too..

	Frontier?  What type of game is frontier?  With all the talk about it,
I expect it's good.  The problem is that somewhere I heard it's a shoot-em-up,
somewhere else I heard it was a lot like Star Flight and lately I've heard it's
a role play.  Can anyone enlighten me?

Well hell, someone post this guy their save file. It's obvious he doesn't
want to play the game. Unfortunately having lots of cash isn't very
different from having a tiny amount. In fact, it's probably less interesting
because you're so unlikely to get blown up.

Hey ho.

Right. The time for talking is over. What we need is action, and now. All those
in favour, say AYE...

Seriously, can somebody who knows about these things set up a rec.games.frontier
or similar?

  Ok here is what I am having problems with, I have been playing this game
for about a week now and have built up alot of money.  So I decide to buy
a Panther clipper just to see what there like but the problem is every
time I purchase the ship it will take my money but won't say the usual
congrats or anything and then none of the buttons work anymore.  The mouse
will still move and when I hold the right mouse button it disappears as
usual but nothing else works (i.e. keyboard, or screen buttons).  If 
anyone has any suggestions plase let me know.  Thanks

	The license agreement of all the software I sell says:

	"You may not buy software from any other person but me."

	Since the person agreed to buy the program from me, he has to
obey the license that I write for it.

ok, my first bug is with the mining machine.  I can set it down on some 
planets are lift off again.  But these were when the mining machine reported
nothing found or water.  But when it found minerals i lifted off pressed f8
(hyperspace) and the machine crashed totaly and uterly.

The 2nd bug is when I approach some planets to manually land on them (barron
planets for example), I get very close then seem to pass straight through.
If I then turn back onto course there is total screen corruption where the 
planet should be.

Are there any patches around to fix this?

I posted a brief summary about a week ago, but it has probably expired.
Few of the bugs we have all found have been fixed -- the following are
all still there: Beta Lyrae bug, bulletin board bug, autopilot flies
through planet bug, Police crash into their own space-station bug, 
zoom out too far on the galaxy map and see loads of 'other galaxies' bug,
wormhole bug.

As far as I can tell, the only improvements are that the colour-flashing
has been improved, and the relative-to behaviour has been tweaked to be
a little more well-behaved.

Anyone know how to get the fixes? Will they be freely distributable? I've
registered with Gametek, but received nothing yet (not that I expect to). In
fact, how DO I tell what version of Frontier I have?

   The only bug that's really been annoying me is that the Bulletin Board
doesn't work on many planets. Once I left the Sol/ Barnard's area, I
couldn't get very many a) passengers b) missions or c) tasks to do. Very
bloody annoying.

I run an A3000 with 6meg ram. (Kickstart2)

The trouble is that i can`t manage to get close to the the target without crashing into the ground. Is this a bug or am i just stupid ?

I've seen these ships, but only while carrying out missions that are
"hostile" against one of the two Powers. It seems a reasonable conclusion
that Feddie military ships have an XX*Y naming scheme and Imperial ships,
+NNNL (N = number, L = letter.) FYI, the Imperiates seem to favor
Osprey fighters and once in a great while, an Imp Courier. Not that it
matters, they're absolutely pathetic. Couldn't hit the broad side of
Morgue's Mortuary if they were docked inside it.

The different naming schemes _are_ a nice touch, admittedly.

Subject: Frontier - 'special' ships / ship names
X-Newsreader: Ann 0.10
Lines: 29

Okay, we all know that ships in Frontier are named like 'XX-YYY' where
XX are two letters and YYY are three numbers, right?. But has anybody
else noticed these 'special' names that occure when you accept certain
missions?

Here's an example... I accepted to carry a small package from Vequess
to Facece for approx. $9000. Well, the dude said it contains stolen
data from a federation craft and the Feds are right after him. What
should I say - I needed the money =;). Okay, I hyperspaced to Facece
and on my way to Coates's Mine I was attacked by a total of three
ships - needless to say that I blew them to dust within a few seconds
=:). But all these ships had a name like 'XX*Y' where XX were two
letters and Y was a single number. And this star in the middle of the
name was the thing that initially drew my attention. By the way, my
impression is, that all ships that attack AND send you a message have
these special names - can anyone confirm this?

So what's up with these ships? I assume that they are special agents
from either the Federation or the Empire but is there really anything
special besides the different naming scheme? All I know is that they
fight like my Grandma in her 90s and that they seem to prefer Vipers -
two of the three used one, the other was a Asp Explorer...

I've settled for a cobra mark III with a class 3 military drive and 4MW
beam laser. Jump range is 18 ly I think. This still leaves some space
for cargo/fuel.

I also had a viper, which gives a whopping 27 ly range and is faster,
but you have to have a smaller laser.

For trading I used an Imperial courier, but changed to a smaller ship
for missions and assassinations.

Unfortunately these two options won't actually work. If the drive is destroyed
through a mis-jump, quite apart from the literally astronomical chance of winding
up in any start system, you're still left with an interplanetary drive which you
can't remove either. You're then left with an *extremelely* useless Courier or
Trader. And if your drive is destroyed in combat you're even worse off - without
even an interplanetary drive you'll be unable to dock, land or anything. Escape
capsule time methinks.
Pity really - I'd like to stick a class 7 drive in my Trader. If anyone has any
ideas, send them in!
Quick question time - at what point do titles and ranks become mutually
exclusive? I've been a Sergeant and a Sir for a long time, and I can't seem to
advance either? Do I have to get demoted in one to be promoted in the other?

Maybe somebody can give me some suggestions on how to really challenge
myself in Frontier.

I used to jump around the old Lave system, particularly between Reorte
and Zaonce.  With my 4MW Beam Laser equipped Cobra MK III it wasn't
even that bad.  On Reorte I sometimes get intercepted twenty, thirty
times before actually reaching the space station.  Though none of the
opponents every pose a threat.  There are occasionally some Imperial
Couriers hanging around there, but unless you do something really
stupid, those slow boats won't be able to get a shot at you.  You only
need to watch those nasty Naval Missiles.  If you forget about one of
those and accelerate time forward you are toast.

Somebody suggested Phekda as a good place, so I got myself an old
Gecko and did a few 40ly jumps to that star system. I bounced a few
times between Phekda and another planet near it... a disputed planet,
but it was plain boring out there. There was less action than on
Reorte.

Does anybody have some suggestions?  I think downgrading the ship
won't make things any more interesting.  The Cobra MK III is about the
smallest ship which can hold a 4MW beam laser.  A smaller laser only
drags out the fights for a longer period of time.  That doesn't seem
to make fights more challenging, but only increases the time until you
kill the enemy (and hence until the next promotion).  I do generally
keep 2 - 4 shields around.  I rarely get hit (mostly when I do stupid
things like using the auto pilot to aim at other ships...  hey
everybody needs a break sometimes!), but I doubt that throwing away
the shields will help much.

One thing I haven't gotten to work is to get more than one enemy on my
screen.  Somebody suggested not to use the maximum time acceleration,
but I tried that and used the next lower acceleration.  It just took
longer before the next enemy appeared, but it was still always just
_one_ enemy.  Any hints?

I also tried wiping out whole space stations. In case anybody is
interested, an easy method is to sit right by the door. Police Vipers
get released in pairs, so you just need to kill them off when they
leave. Though I don't quite yet want to make myself a WANTED pirate.
Maybe later, for now I just want to reach ELITE ranking. BTW, space
stations themselves cannot be destroyed.

Oh well, hope this is enough discussion material on this topic.  I
would like to hear some input on how to get the ultimate trip in
Frontier.  :)

Honest to God, I swear this works:

1. You arrive in a star system.
2. Pull up the Current System Map. Spin it around and zoom it so you
get a good close look at your current location (big purple dot.)
3. You're probably surrounded by a couple of other, smaller colored
dots. These are other ships, almost certainly pirates.
4. Use the autopilot icon to select the nearest one. It is somewhat
tricky to select other dots that are very close to your own dot, but
I got the hang of it after a while.
5. Go back to the main view. The HUD tells you how far away the other
ship(s) are. You can scan them with the Hyperspace Analyzer, or call
them up to see if they're really pirates.
6. Turn on your Autopilot. You begin flying towards the pirates.
7. Now you can manipulate the time compression to your heart's content.
Leave it at 4 or 5 if you're really far from the enemy, start cranking
it down when you get close. It should be at either 2 or 3 when the
"under attack" alarm siren goes off.
8. Done everything right? You should be attacked by the entire pirate group
(usually 3 ships). Sometimes, pirates really honestly do go out alone,
so you'll still have one-on-one battles, but I'd say about one-third to
one-half are groups of 3 ships.
9. And, er, that's it. It's not insanely difficult to handle, but it's
much more fun than knocking the pirates over one at a time. Repeat the
above steps for all the nearby pirates on your scanner, and once the
stellar neighborhood is cleared of evildoers, you can autopilot your
way safely to your destination insystem.

Cumbersome, yes, but better than one-on-one battles until the end of
time. I _really_ hope that combat is made more challenging in future
versions, if such exist; it should get more difficult as your Elite
rating improves, and increase in variety. Being attacked by, say,
a Tiger Trader (with active gun turrets, of course -- noticed that
even if the enemy ship has more than just the front gun mount, the
pirates never seem to use theirs? Tch tch tch...) accompanied by
a couple of fighters flying escort would be rather entertaining.

You can do that if you want to rack up your kill rating... of course,
you can save wear-and-tear on your laser by just letting them ram
into each other as they emerge from the station. This has _got_ to be
fixed.

Other ships' AI in general has problems -- there are wonderful things,
like the way an assassination target will try to flee back into the
safety of an underground base, but then there are the things that make
you want to cover your eyes in shame. Like, one time I was hanging out
near a space station and decided to track a cargo ship all the way in.
He sailed in from the edge of the system, got docking permission, the
lights went on and the doors opened (I thought that was cool, that
they dock the same way you do), he flew smoothly up to the station, smacked
into the wall of the bay and blew up. *sigh*

Two conclusions:

1. Other ships in the Frontier universe have an autopilot that's just
as good as the one in your own ship!
2. Ya know, after a horrible space accident like that I would expect
the space station to shut down operations for a couple hours while
police and Red Cross ships swarm the area, and probably the local news
media too... :-)

Yes. I guess original poster didn't 

(a) read the fine manual

or 

(b) think enough before posting this flame

The game has by default a 'correction' system active that
kinda makes dogfighting etc more like Elite 1. To get to
a realistic spaceflight you must use 'engines off' mode, and
use forward/retro trusters with return/r-shift ...

Then again it's a fine way to get yourself killed
by smashing to a planet/space station/star/add_your_favourite_
object_here if you don't know how spaceflight mechanics work.

With the correction system on the flight is utterly
unrealistic but much easier. 

Now about the other thing - the control system not allowing
x/y/z movements - THAT sucks. one should be able to do pitch/yaw/roll
with keyboard control.. and on mouse this would be a great way
to use (AND promote to buy) a three-button mouse: put it
so that you can roll the ship with mouse with the 3rd button pressed.

Erm, on the PC version there is pitch/yaw/roll control and it is chosen
by clicking 'Elite Control in space' option or some such thing... Remember
I used it until I realised only the joystick was fast enough to keep up
with the game

Summary: How to do wormhole jumps in Frontier
Keywords: wormholes
X-News-Reader: VMS NEWS 1.24



What I give here below is a brief description of the use of the
"wormhole" method and the -basic- "wormhole" equations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A "wormhole" jump-point is a location that is an intermediate
position in a 2-step jump sequence;
(start-point) to (wormhole jump-point) to (end-point).

 The -basic- wormhole formulae will produce the ideal coordinates
for a -pair- of wormhole jump-points; you can use either or both locations.
 The actual jump-points are found where there are any star-systems to
jump to that are within the range of the ideal wormhole jump-point;
you should choose the jump-point that gives the best fuel economy
from the available star-systems around the ideal location.

 These equations are a subset of a more general (more difficult)
set of equations. The basic set is most useful for the local/nearby
explored region of space. (The general equations come into play when
going out more than several hundred light-years... I'll post those also
if there's enough interest. Let me know.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let us begin:(as simply as possible)

 For star-systems at coordinates (X,Y) and (U,V),

 Let   a = (U-X)/2 
       b = (V-Y)/2
       m = Mid-range distance
           (a^2 + b^2)^(1/2) ; m equals the square-root of the sum
                                 of [a-squared plus b-squared]

 Use a wormhole distance Wn, defined as follows:
 |
 |  Let:
 |      W = base Wormhole-distance
 |        = 81.92 sector-lengths (=655.36 Light-years)
 |
 |  So then:
 |      Wn = Wormhole-distance-of-order-n
 |         = n*W       ;n-fold multiple of the base Wormhole-distance W
 |         = n*(81.92)
 |  Note: you are free to choose the value of n *PROVIDED* that Wn is
 |        greater than half of the distance between your starting and ending
 |        star-systems; typically you will just use W1 for nearby systems.


 Let   S = Shift-distance
         = (W^2 - m^2)^(1/2)

 then  A = aS/m ;upper-case symbols (A,B) are different from (a,b)
       B = bS/m


 RESULT: THE WORMHOLE IDEAL-NEIGHBORHOOD COORDINATES (WX,WY)
 (remember that a -pair- of ideal locations is produced)

         WX = X+a+B, WY = Y+b-A
 and
         WX = X+a-B, WY = Y+b+A.

 EXAMPLES:
 (fuel usage is shown for a class 8 hyperdrive, as an upper limit)
 (* indicates the preferred choice of jump-point)

 Sol(0.0,0.2)-Phekda(1.5,5.0)/
 ideals=        findings=             stepwise class-8 Fuel-usage (tons)
 (78.9,-21.8)   Esszeand (78.7,-22.1) *(7+11=18)
 (-77.4,27.0)   ...desolate-region

 Sol(0.0,0.2)-Cemiess(-1.5,-2.5)/
 ideals=        findings=             stepwise class-8 Fuel-usage (tons)
 (70.8,-40.9)   Uressmi (70.0,-41.9)  *(4+7=11)
 (-72.3,38.6)   Vephied (-71.7,39.4)  *(7+4=11)

 Cemiess(-1.5,-2.5)-Phekda(1.5,5.0)/
 ideals=        findings=             stepwise class-8 Fuel-usage (tons)
 (76.0,-29.0)   Essface (76,-29.5)      (14+7=21)
 (-76.0,31.6)   Exdain (-75.8,31.7)   *(4+11=15)

 and, by a basic 2nd-order wormhole W2,
                                                            class-8
 Sol(0.0,0.2)-Beta Lyrae(-146.25,85.2)/Vewaay(-143.4,-78.4) fuel=(7+14=21) 

 ...read this verbally as:
 "Sol(#,#) to Beta Lyrae(#,#) by-way-of Vewaay(#,#)"
                              (via)

 If you have the patience to search around the ideal-neighborhood a bit,
 then you can usually find a total fuel-usage solution that amounts to about
 1/4 or less of your maximum range fuel-usage. If not, then try a larger
 wormhole-distance-order (multiple of the basic W=81.92 sector-lengths).

 This will get you from anywhere to anywhere - so explore!
 (For practice, try to land in the Pleiades system (32,32).)


 Final note:
 Within the theme of the game, I'd like this feature to be kept in
 the game in some way - possibly as a provision of a "wormhole resonator
 unit" equipment-modification to the hyperdrive... not more heavy, just
 more expensive in accordance with the range multiples....

This method is described and used by Robert A. Heinlein in his
novel "Number of the beast". It is known as "the drunkard's walk".
In the novel it is used to scan a planet's surface with a ship,
that has a minimum jump distance of 1 mile. They jump in triangles
to scan distances of 300 metres (don't have the exact numbers around).

So:
Thanks for your description and remember, everything is already
there, you just have to look for it B-)

There are _many_ errors with the ship specs in the manual. Just start
comparing the manual to the actual data and you'll know what I mean.

The dedicated manual reader as I am discovered (another bug??) what probably
can be explained as a mis-print.

The ship info on the Imperial Courier says Crew: 3. But when I have 3 crew
members (including myself ofcourse). It won't take off saying:
you can't take off without the appropriate ammount of crews. So I dismiss them
and I take off with only me myself and I (meaning crew=1).

How can this be explained (or is it a bug)?

Slaves, perhaps...

This is also true for Imperial Trader, because it is so big ship that at
least it shouldn't work with only one crew (=player).

    Look at the ship data listing in shipyards, it says that Courier
    has one crew member.  There are other ships also that have different
    crew requirements when compared to manual.  Panther 15->12, Imperial
    Trader 6->1, and so on.

Hi there,

I am playing Frontier on a PC but maybe that the AMIGA guys can help me
too.

When I destroy an enemy fighter my RADAR detects 3 thingies floating
through space right on the spot where my enemy got blown away. The RADAR
shows those thingies as blue flags. My question is: is it possible to
collect those thingies (I recall that it was possible in ELITE but then
you needed a cargo-bay.)

If you can help me out, Thanx already.

Jurriaan.
Just a simple privateer with a bit of credits left :-(

You need to buy a fuel scoop, and get a cargo scoop conversion too.
Not really worth it though, you can make more money faster in other ways
That and the fact its bloody near impossible to scoop anything up...

	You need a fuel scoop and a cargo scoop conversion to pick those
things up. If you press F10, you should get to know what is inside those
'thingies'.

Hey, chip on your shoulder man, don't stereotype PC owners. `Most' really
refers to the type of person who replys to `amiga.pc.advocacy' posts in all

Something that I find rather irritating is the lack of "find-system" which
was in Elite. (Or is it in Frontier? The manual doesn`t mention it
anyway...) When you accept some mission and go out and look for the
star-system on the map it can be rather hard to locate. Especially those
missions which only lists the name of the system on the roster and you
forgot to write down the quadrant.

I can get to these systems which say 'system explored only by remote telescope.
Enter at your own risk'.

But what are you supposed to do once you enter them?

Are there civilisations which have to be found?

If theres no spaceports then you cant trade.

Since there are millions of these types of systems surely there must be
something else to do there other than land rough on a planet!!

Does anyone have any experience with these types of systems?
Some advice would be greatly appreciated.
thanks.

Shoot the programmer for making it so that less than 1% of the systems
are actually important and over 95% are plain window dressing...
(Rough estimate. no time to do actual statistical calculations...)

This is the major fault which makes me NOT to play Frontier
until a major upgrade is out. 

When I have a spaceship with rather unlimited range (Big ship, fuel
scoop, tons of cargo space) I want to go EXPLORING.

Frontier first shows you off : 'look I have 100,000,000,000 places
to visit'
Then you sooner or later find that yes, you can visit them, but there
is ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY NO FU*KING REASON TO DO SO. There's
nothing to find out there.

This was the final straw that killed Frontier in my eyes.

Braben is genius in 3D programming AND in fooling customers
to think their machine contains an universe... with 8-bits
Elite was mega and while the systems always were like clones
of each other, that was acceptable. It's no longer, tech
has advanced. Another great thing is that the galaxy, while
roughly shaped like the real thing when looked above, is
approx 20ly thick. Dig up your old schoolbooks and check
how thick it SHOULD be. Also it really has 
very little in common with our galaxy. very very few of
the known stars are added there like they are in reality.

Summary: ship info and equipment weights

I have written all this in my manual.  I found it easier
to choose a new ship and load it with equipment with this
information.  There are some holes in this.  Anywhere there
is a single question mark "?" is something I either haven't
found out yet, or haven't copied from my manual to this list.

The misprints in the manual are marked with a "*".

Enjoy.

I am flying my Imperial Courier.  I leave to get a drink
from the kitchen, and in the process hear the attack
warning.  When I get back my hull is at 56%.  I fly
to the station and go to make repairs, and notice that
I have to repair 360 tons of hull.  The book states that
the hull is 130 tons, the total ship weight is 480.

This means that I only have to repair 277% of my hull.

I also have seen the same sort of number problems when
flying an asp and constrictor.  The asp has had hull
damage that is more than the total weight of the ship.

This is v1.00 of frontier.

Thargoids DO exist, As an ELITE rated commander from Elite I (Most
of the kills notched up from killing Thargoids) I should know one when 
I see one, and one attacked me in Wolf 630.  No Idea what its weapon
config was (No time to use the mapper) but it made a mess of my Panther
before I wiped it out.  Note that my Panther has 40+ shields and a 
Plasma Accelerator so the Thargoids are MEAN!

...

Well actually, I just figured out how to *reliably* put a class 7 drive in my
Trader last night. However, the method involved some degree of long term 
planning!!

Simply conduct your normal business, but only service equipment NOT the drive,
after about 1 year game time (approx 50 jumps) the drive will fail. The drive
will fail *on arrival* to your chosen destination, with interplanetary
capability still useable. If you're in a high tech system, just fly on in as
normal, land/dock and buy yourself a class 7! If you happen to be in
hicksville at the time, just restore your last save, and jump to the nearest
high tech system, reloading until the drive fails again (it seems to be
statistically weighted with age of drive). Took me about 10 jumps to reproduce
the failure.

Unfortunately, this is only the start of your problems, a class 7 drive is
*BIG*, throw away that 20MW laser, whittle down those shields. I've calculated
useable tonnage for everything (goodies + cargo), assuming what I consider to
be bare minimum (i.e. Drive + enough fuel for one max range Jump), for both
Couriers and Traders (normal and '+' configurations):

    Courier:    Class 5 drive (10.41 ly):    350-150-25t = 175t
                Class 6 drive (15.00 ly):    350-250-36t =  64t

    Trader:     Class 6 drive (10.28 ly):    525-250-36t = 239t
                Class 7 drive (14.00 ly):    525-400-49t =  76t !!

I guess you could say that Couriers/Traders weren't designed with an upgrade
path in mind. Also there is virtually no point in running a 'Trader+'
when you could use a 'Courier+' (except that it looks better IMHO). Courier+
is faster, cheaper with greater jump range for the loss of only 12t capacity.

I was beginning to wish for greater jump range, but I think anything else in
the game looks like a shoe box in comparsion to the Imperial ships. At least
now I have some options.

Hope that helps,

Iain.

Thank you.

Beta-testers is right!...

I spoke to Gametek USA today... they indicated that Frontier is NOT TO
BE OFFICIALLY RELEASED UNTIL NEXT SPRING sometime - without(!) the bugs
(curious, as to how they'd know... THE? bugs..., Hmm.),...
and furthermore, any materials arriving in the states are said to be
"gray-market"... yes, it was (to some office's disappointment) released
in Europe by one of the other offices somewhere (though not in the U.K.,
...HM??)...

Well, I bought mine a few weeks ago now, and, though it is buggy and
missing much variety*longevity, I've still been having fun with it
due to its new-ness... and it's price was quite reasonable over here.
Still, many of the bugs are inexcuseable under the notion of having
been passed by "beta-testing"... the letter alpha seems more appropriate.
For a fuller price (scaled here), I'd have expected a planet/terrain,
ship, and mission-editor... then people could pass adventures around.
Furthermore, since the event timing scales itself to the machine that
it runs on, then a modem 2-player version should be seriously considered....

-and I'm quite suspicious about its speed efficiency...considering this next-

Nagging question:
----------------  if so many of the bugs are the same between the Amiga
and PC versions, and it runs so bog slow on a 500 (in contrast, both
Armourgeddon and StargliderII are good examples that run quite well!),
and the curve routines in Frontier are supposed to be executed with
"no loss of speed" compared to regular polyhedral code (a dubious claim,
in my opinion), then what'd they do?... program essential code in that
gawd-awful language C???... for anything other than *outer-layers*, such
a practice is suicidal for speedy code.

Noooo.... Please don`t! I`m having great fun reading all this but the sysop 
here is very slow in adding new groups to our access.

Okay, I have now set the process going, I think. Soon a Request For Discussion
should be turning up here, on news.groups, on news.announce.newgroups and on
comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.flight-sim. I've used the name rec.games.frontier for
the moment - obviously this is one of the things that can be discussed. Also
the charter's a bit vague - but that's the sort of thing this first stage is
there for...

This is a formal request for discussion for the creation of the newsgroup
rec.games.frontier.  This proposal is being posted to news.groups,
comp.sys.amiga.games, and comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.flight-sim.
The followup is set to news.groups and followup discussion will take 
place there.

Charter:   This group will discuss all aspects of the game Frontier (Elite 
           II), such as bugs, strategies, conversions to other machines.

Rationale: The number of Frontier posts on comp.sys.amiga.games, and the
           depth of the game, have caused a lot of people to request a
           news group to be set up for it. There is so much to the game
           that this level of interest is likely to be maintained.

You may think i`m stupid, but i`ll explain my problem.
If i fly manually to a planet with a starport, I can fly around at variuos
altitudes til my hearts contents. But when i go to a planet with a miltary
base then the planet develops a gravititational pull which needs full thrust 
just to stop me crashing to the ground, That is i have to have my ship 90 
degrees to the surface.

Military base?... as opposed to any-whatever starport?
... develops(?) a gravitational pull?

Name the system and planet please.

Meanwhile, I hope you've considered that atmospheres in general are no more
than a 30 to 60 km thick (you know, thin skin on a big ball?).

To explore the limits:
 I've manually landed on Ceres (large asteroid) and Neptune(!) (gas giant)
 and anything else planet-sized without a shload of gravity.

 No problems!

Also, some ships that have acceleration of something like 22 Gs are
impossible for humans to use.  Humans can only withstand about 10 Gs for
short periods of time (eg. space shuttle).  If the ships were for real,
people would be instantly splatted on the back wall.

However, if these ships somehow do manage 22 Gs, this would imply that
the craft has some sort of a local gravitational field generator,
but then why not make that the main propulsion system?  (so you could
do cool tricks like 90 degree turns).

You don't need a g-field for that.
The whole thing about rocket-based technology in the future is a sad sad
concept... but I have been enjoying the game anyways.

This is not a flame post.

Frontier Wish List (Frontier 2 perhaps?):

- AGA version:

i) real graphics: 256 colour, real faces (aliens too)
ii) able to use different monitors (ie DBLPAL)
iii) real sound: proper modules without reusing instruments
iv) more speed

- aliens... real aliens, and not just one race... millions of them
(friendly aliens, bad aliens etc.)

- who says that everybody speaks the same language? how about
interpreters/universal decoders?

- different propulsion systems (thrusters in year 3200 are a joke)
(how about a local gravitational field?)

- many different ships

- able to own multiple ships

- able to own cities/planets/systems etc.

- more interaction with your crew - ie. able to talk to them.
how about the crew actually doing something?  (ie. using the back laser?)

- better HUD (head up display):  the current one is a joke during combat

- adding components to your ship that weigh less than 1 tonne.
(eg. the automatic pilot should really be a few kilos since it's just
an addition to the on-board computer system)

- better automatic pilot (maybe 2 versions) - ie. 
i) use the main thruster to slow down the ship... 
ii) fly to different cities NOT through planets

- unknown alien aircraft that is snooping around planets perhaps?

- better military missions... full on wars maybe?

- bigger galaxy with more populated planets.

- able to view 360 degrees from inside the ship: not just front and
back views.

- hyperspace:  the only reason I have found so far for coming out of
hyperspace so far away is because you can do some combat.  Since you are
able to enter hyperspace pretty much anywhere (except planets), why are you
limited to exiting it around 10 AUs from the required planet?  Even worse
situations like Alpha Centauri where you are 200 AUs away...

Any additions/suggestions are welcome.

Oh yeah, you forgot to mention the Class 7 hyperdrive, the spare 3000T
cargo capacity - let me put it this way, hyperspace jumps take subjective
HOURS not days, the max jump range is quoted at -200 odd light years,
I still havent found the edge of the circle...

and it's bloody boring flying with it...

you have to go and attack the pirates yourself, because they cant catch you

Neway, in my defence, the above pilot is only for exploring... I do have 3
'legal' commanders on the go...

One who is above average, has no military rank and has oodles of money
with his panther clipper

One who is competent in the good old Cobra mark 3,

and finally my favourite Asp Explorer.......

  NEway, I have sent off a Frontier Bug List to Gametek in the hope
that they may do something about it. It came to around 8000 words
and I have most of the bugs that have been mentioned recently.

I have got an Asp Explorer with a class 5 Hyperdrive.  Gives me
up to 21 l.y. jumps.    I have 2-5 shield generators, depending
on mission, and either a 5 MW pulse laser  or a 30 MW mining laser,
again mission dependent.  Its pretty nippy..  I have no problems
so far....  though it is a Federal ship  :-)

I agree. I like the Frontier posts just where they are, but I don't want to
go through yet another newsgroup. BTW I have the impression the frontier
posts are already lessening compared to a few weeks ago. If things continue
at this rate you'll eventually be left with an almost empty newsgroup.

Just some remarks on that. You will see, in news.groups, a lot of people
not actually interested in Frontier, but quite more interested to maintain
a concise, understandable and longer lasting namespace in netland. 

Those will, quite likely, strongly oppose an own newsgroup for a recently
published arcade type video game. (Please don't argue on that classification 
- I try to explain how others might see that). And you should realize, that 
strong  opposition could, in many cases, mean failure of the group creation.
I would even vote against it myself.

So I suggest setting up this group in the alt.* hierarchy, where it, 
admittedly, might suffer from a slightly worse distribution, but
has, due to the lack restrictions there, good chances to get created.

The ususal way to create a group in alt.* is to post a suggestion to
alt.config (?) and discuss the name there. Then you or someone you ask 
about it (maybe one of the folks in alt.config) can create the group.
My personal suggestion would be alt.games.frontier.

If you really insist on the whole process to establish a "big seven" 
group, then I suggest not only thorough reading of the "how to create
a new USENET newsgroup" document, but also the "primer" published
on that subject by some news.groups regulars, which contains lots of
dos and don'ts you don't find anywhere else.

I've got a few medals while working for the Imperials, so I was wondering
1) Exactly what I did to merit them
2) What medals other people have
3) Why would you call a medal a "Black Polygon" ?  It isn't exactly the most
romantic of names...

Paul.
Above Average Squire, Black Polygon, and some other medal I can't recall..

To answer your questions in a random order...

>2) What medals other people have

As a dedicated imperial servant I have been awarded the Crimson
Brassard, the Black Polygon and the Golden Spike. I've also got a
certificate of valour too, but I won't say what I use it for :)

>1) Exactly what I did to merit them

You seem to get them when you complete the first mission of a given type.

Crimson Brassard	- weapons grade whatever, gravitic detonators etc
Black Polygon		- secret orders/dossiers/plans and stuff
Golden Spike		- assassination

>3) Why would you call a medal a "Black Polygon" ?  It isn't exactly the most
>romantic of names...

I know. BTW I go to Facece when I want missions. They usually have
several screenfuls there. Sometimes I can get about 10 to the same
destination.  Is this true of the federation naval base too? (wherever
it is, I expect I'll be asked to blow it up one day :))

Heh, heh, I didn't think anyone needed this, cos I found it to be pretty useless
but if you want a Imperial Courier or an Imperial Trader with a better hyperdrive read this...

Just fly about as normal, doing your stuff, but never service your hyperdrive. 
Then when your about 11-12 months away from the service date just sit in a 
space station or starport and wait. You can do a bit of trading on the stock market while you're waiting. Eventually the hyperdrive will fail. Sell the rubbish and buy a new one. Trouble is, you will hardly have enough room for
equipment (shields, 4MW beam laser, and the basics) just to fit the fuel on board. I find keeping the original drive and filling up with fuel for about 5 jumps is the best way for doing your assassinations etc.

I could have put this in THE GUIDE PART III, but I feel this one needed urgent attention!

I agree. I just discovered the solution myself a coupla nights ago, and posted
the info to this group also. BUT, I only flew my Trader+ (Class 7 drive) for
a few missions before I missed having:

        ALL the gadgets
	20 Shield Generators (Pirates LIKE ramming big ships !!)
        7 Passenger Cabins (can be sold for cargo space)
	20MW laser (can be sold for cargo space)
	Enough fuel for one max range jump
        35t(ish) left over for extra fuel/cargo space

as opposed to:

	Most Gadgets (don't take up much tonnage)
	10 shields (A crashing Cobra III actually did some hull damage!)
	4 MW laser (makes shielded Panther Clipper assassinations a chore)
	Enough fuel for one max range jump
	***NOTHING ELSE***
	
It's just too limiting to have 76t to play with in a big ship like the Trader.
Still, my current Trader (Class 6) with engine 'spikes', red / blue fairing
flashes and blue faceted engine cowls is "The Biz". That, along with the slick
way the engines extent/rotate at high speeds, make the Trader the *only*
choice for the image conscious space jock!!!

Well, I know of someone who has version 1.2. I don't know what is different/
fixed, though.

We've had LOADS of excellent responses by too many people to name, but rest 
assured email addresses have been noted, we will try and write back a.s.a.p. 

All the beastly tips we've had are being compiled for a furture GUIDE, so keep
talking!!!

Well it's now Wednesday, Saturday was when we wrote THE GUIDE, and as you may 
have guessed we are still playing the game, so here's some new stuff!!



Matt c2mjw@dum.ac.uk - Amiga
Dave c2djm@dum.ac.uk - PC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


COMBAT

You may have noticed that in the first guide we missed out a combat section, but
on finding out from various mail we recieved that most commanders were Average
or above, we thought you obviously know how to fight, but here are some points
some of you may not know... 

Note: For the uninformed Port = left, Starboard = right

EASY KILLS 




Matt's - Thrust 'an spin (Amiga)

This is a good one, one I always use anyway!! Ships usually come from infront 
and straight for you!! So why not try this...

Turn about 10 degrees to the port or starboard, and hit some forward thrust.
Look at your scanner to see when the sucker is about alongside. Then spin round 
to face him and hit full thrust after him, keeping him in your sights. You 
should now be on his tail. Obviously you can choose when to shoot - I can't tell
you that, but I like trying to sit on a ship's tail and see how long I can stay 
there. This tactic works supprisingly well on the smallest of ships, too.




Matt's - Chicken run (Amiga)

This is very effective if you have a 4 - 20MW beam laser, and is very quick to
despatch the skilless little squidler ships that turn up blue on the scanner (I 
think thats about 0 - 16t).

Again this works best when a ship comes from directly in front, but still 
effective when they come from any other direction.

When under attack turn to face the other ship as quick as you can, and then turn
only about 5 degrees the the port or starboard (just enough for the other ship 
to miss when shooting) and hit forward thrust just to get him in range of your 
guns. Then hit reverse thrust for a bit, for him to approach more slowly, then
cut the engines again. Get him in your sights and shoot a short distance ahead
of him, stop turning. The other ship should run straight into your laser. 

This is a bit risky for a big enemy ship with good guns, 'cos he may just turn 
to face you as well, but if done properly they don't have the chance as they're 
already space dust. Little ships however, never have the firepower to trouble 7
shield generators, and are normally wasted by the time they get close enough to 
shoot.




Dave's - Stuka dive (PC)

When a ship attacks from a position close to the front, slam the engines on full
forward thrust and pull up. Look at the scanner to see when the target is nearly
directly below (don't thrust too much or he'll be out of range. Cut the engines
and turn 180 degrees straight down at the enemy ship and thrust forwards letting
rip, try to shoot slightly ahead of him as well. He can't shoot at you from this
position. A beam laser is what is really required for this. Works best on the 
medium class of ship.




EVASIVE MANOUVERS/COUNTER ATTACKS



Matt's - Twister (Amiga, and PC apparently)

A good one for when getting seriously hammered by laser fire. I do this when in
total panic, ie getting shot by some Elite pilot with a beam laser.

If getting shot from head-on (it does happen sometimes) I use this little number
to get out of the laser fire and onto the enemy ship's tail.

Basically if getting shot from the front I turn 90 degrees hard port and hit 
forward thrust forward for a couple of seconds. Then I pull up 180 degrees and 
thrust forward to face the path of the enemy by which time he's just about 
flying past. Then you can return fire when he goes past or turn 90 degrees to 
the port and thrust forward after him. Confusing without a diagram isn't it!!



GENERAL

These are just some of the tactics we use for a laff and for an impresive fight.
Use them if you will, but I ALWAYS find I turn my engines off and use forward 
and reverse thrust to get my out of trouble or into a kill scoring position.

Also I have noticed that on the Amiga and PC versions sometimes the sound FX for
getting hit doesn't work, and the only way you can tell if you getting hit is if
you see the hull getting damaged! One way of noticing if you're getting hit is
to look for a laser hitting the egde of the display, a laser will NEVER fill 
your display. Try going to an external view zooming in and shooting the camera, 
you'll see what I mean. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SHOOTING MISSILES

Not much use this one, more for fun really. YES! Missiles can be shot whether 
you are travelling towards a planet, or not! Missiles at one point or another 
will come from behind - either launched from a ship from behind, or manouvering
themselves into that position. 

Turn your engines off. When a missile is behind hit full forward thrust (if 
you're in a half-decent ship it won't quite hit you). Wait until the missile is
about 0.5 - 1.5km behind, by either targeting it or looking at the scanner, then
spin round 180 degrees and hit reverse thrust. Now let rip!! Missiles are more
visible if you turn the text on and missile will appear alongside the, er, 
missile. It is difficult to hit though and you definately need a beam laser!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


USING MISSILES

Most of you may have noticed that missiles are completely useless in combat, cos
the target keeps on running away. Not so!! Have you every tried launching a 
missile at a target and then hitting the time skip? Well presuming the target
doesn't have somesort of ECM system he should get blown away!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We've read loads of letters that state you need 3,000 shields, just to live not 
so! At the minute I (Matt) have down graded from my Tiger Trader, after 
forgetting that the gun turrets are just too confusing to use after a prelonged 
period shooting ships with a front mounted laser, to an Asp. At the minute both 
of us are doing runs for the Federal military (Not Imperial SCUM!!) in Asp's 
with a Class 4 hyperdrive, NO shields, 4MW beam laser, Scanner, Radar mapper 
and an autopilot. I still haven't come close to getting wasted. 

We hope that some of the above tactics will help convince some of you that you
don't need shields, but just good combat knowlegde.

Oh, by the way Matt had 3 "Right on commander"'s from Elite Federation, to get to Dangerous some people had 2 some had 4 why? Does this depend on how often you save the game? I stopped saving and found that I got attacked a lot more often. Progress to the
 rank was therefore much faster. 

Well that will have to be it for now, we've got loads of coursework to do so we
had better get on with it...

Bye

Email us if you find anything new.

Commanders Welford and Maddison signing off....

I think this is not a bug but merely the fact that the planet is a gas
giant and you are simply passing through gas. Shouldn't hurt your ship
if you have atmospheric sheilding.

Since when has resource been able to de-compile source? It can disassemble
it, but decompiling is completey different from dissasembling it !!!

And this actually works? I only ask because I'd have thought you'd have been
unable to remove the interplanetary drive, either - if you can, then it seems
that Braben actually INTENDED for this to work.

The relationship between hyper and interplanetary drives doesn't seem to be 
properly defined in Frontier. A hyperdrive is said to incorporate an interplanetary
drive, and one of the Class 6 variety weighs 250t. Yet, when lack of servicing 
reduced my drive to 250t of rubbish, my interplanetary drive still got me to the
nearest space station. Frontier has rules, but they are not bound by logic!!!

Also, it seems Mr Braben inserted code to prevent *removing* of drives from Imperial
ships but not *fitting*, since the "drive already fitted" code should (oops!) handle 
that. For example, I tried removing the Class 7 drive in my Trader, to see if I had
somehow permanently removed the interchange restriction, but it wouldn't budge.
The object that 2 seconds earlier I had fitted to my ship, magically became an
"integral part" of it. There is *NOTHING* intentional on Mr B's part about this I'm 
afraid, it's just another loop-hole. It is however an example of the more pleasant
variety of loop-hole, the beneficial kind!!!

No it dosent work (in my German Version). After leaving the hyperspace, U lost all
drives, including the Interplanetary one. So U couldent manage to reach the next
harbour....-8(

I seem to be one of the few people in Australia with Frontier, but
unfortunately it is only Version 1.00.

Despite the fact that there are numerous know bugs in the game, I have only
seen the following:  Bulletin Board, Crashing AutoPilot, and the following
which I haven't seen mentioned before:

Select the star map (F2), not move to cursor to another star system, get
info on it (F6).  Now reset the cursor to where you are now (C), now get
info again (F6) and you get the details from where you were, not where you
are.  The fix is to move the cursor away manually and then back again.

I have also discovered a "feature" not mentioned in the manual.  Select the
orbital map of any system (F2 F2).  Select one of the objects (planet, star,
etc) now double click on the zoom in gadget (F7).  It automatically zooms
all the way into the object.

In the same orbital map I can see a small blue dot.  It moves around when
you reorient the map with the mouse, but it doesn't seem to be in a constant
place.  I originally thought that it was my current ship position, but it
doesn't actually seem to be that.  The manual makes no mention of it.  Any
ideas?

Has anyone heard officially (or otherwise) where it is possible to get
updates to the latest version?

Early in the game you can make lots of cash doing the Barnard's Star -> Sol
route with robots and luxuries, but it is also possible to make a lot doing
the Faerce -> Vequve route taking military missions one way (upto 12 at a
time) and slaves the other.

I currently am running an Asp Explorer and am thinking of trading up to an
Imperial Courier.  Is it worth it?


Thanks,
Phil.

HWell, folks, _I was just mucking about with frontier again last night
and found something of no real use...

It's a system called DAAYA, its at sector 937,789, has no special
features other than being a few thousand light years away...
Oh yeah, it DOES have a starport, unlike these other 'inhabited'
systems I've found

997,1111 DAPHIIA
692,1218 SOCECE
692,1218 ETHPHIEXE

Tading company to boost my cash somewhat... but I couldn't find it on any of 
the planets in the Cemesis system.  Can someone give me a pointer as to 
where to go in Cemesis to find Juds trading comany??

ny trading co, it doesnt have to be juds, as long as its not the polis!
Why cheat anyway??
It'll just spoil the game, it can get boring after getting all the equip you
want...

ps how many imp missions do i have to complete to get above sir??
Ive been doing loads of secret plans/High command orders and still at sir
(my record is 13 missions from Faerce t Vequess in one go, not a sausage

Well, I tried this last night, and what do you know, it works fine in the English
version. I lost both drives all right, but my autopilot *still* managed to slow down
and dock with the space station. Strange.
BTW, I agree with everyone else who's said it - a Trader with class 7 drive is almost
completely useless. The normal one's still a damn good ship though...

Keywords: frontier

 I would just like to put forward my opinions about the game "Frontier".
firstly the game although revolutionary and breaks the mould of most dull
Shoot em' ups , does get quite boring even though of it's huge size.
The games music and soundeffects also leave alot to be desired..
The 3-D graphics engine, although looks very good with those impressive 
curves and bends is very very slow. I am playing it on a 1200 and whenever 
i visit populated planets the game goes about as fast as a dead snail 
(even with the detail level on the LOWEST setting) :-(

I am just expressing my opinions to maybe give potential buyers of the 
game an opinion of what they are getting........

Err.. Oops. I have a pc (soz) but they don't talk about Frontier as much
over there (DOOM, DOOM, DOOM) so I read this one as well. Is it different

I wish pc owners/ amiga owners would stop comparing the 'bog standard' amiga
version (probably on a 500!) with a 386/486 35mhz pc!!
Compare it to an a4000 with an 040 or 030 and then see how crap it is!

Okee. Hier Franks Handige Eliminatie Tips.
Gespeeld op een Amiga2000/'030. Spel is in MS-DOS versie identiek qua
gameplay.

Op het Bulletin Board staan vaak missies die inhouden dat een bepaald
persoon opgeruimd moet worden. Ook als je wat verder bent in de militaire
missies kun je zulk soort opdrachten doen. Ze leveren een bak geld op, maar 
gaan ook regelmatig mis. De schepen die je neer moet knallen zijn vaak van 
het type `groot met veel shields'.


Mijn tips (met een Cobra MKI met Class 3 Military Drive, 1MW Beam Laser):

0. SAVE GAME
1. Neem de missie aan, vlieg naar de betreffende spaceport
2. Zorg dat je schip uitgerust is met minstens twee shields (de meeste
   tegenstanders in deze missies zijn uitgerust met Energy Bombs)
3. Zorg ook dat je een Hyperspace Cloud Analyzer, een Autopilot en zo'n 
   schip-identifikatie ding hebt.
4. Wacht tot de dag dat de vijand op zal stijgen.
5. SAVE GAME onder een andere naam dan bij 0
6. Stijg op, een minuut voordat de tegenstander dit zal doen.
7. Blijf in de buurt van het space-station, activeer F10, en kijk 
   vanuit je schip naar achteren.
8. In de meeste gevallen zal op het juiste tijdstip inderdaad het 
   schip vertrekken. Selecteer het met de linker muisknop. Anders: laad
   het bij (0) bewaarde game en neem de opdracht niet aan.
9. Zend af en toe een message naar het schip: waar gaat u heen? Meestal zal
   het antwoord zijn dat dat nog niet verteld kan worden, of dat het nog
   niet bekend is.
10.Als er een antwoord komt dat aangeeft dat het schip binnen hetzelfde
   system zal blijven, laad dan (om moeilijkheden met de politie te vermijden)
   het laatst gesave'de spel opnieuw. De kans is groot dat het schip nu ergens
   naartoe hyperspace'd. Ga terug naar 6.
11.Als je antwoord krijgt dat het schip naar een bepaald systeem zal vertrekken,
   of als er een Hyperspace Cloud verschijnt (analyseer dat ding!), hyperspace
   dan naar hetzelfde stelsel als de tegenstander.
12.Blijf in `achteruit' view, gebruik [] en > om bij stukjes en beetjes je eigen
   hyperspace cloud uit te zoomen. Er zal als het goed is nog zo'n cloud 
   verschijnen.
13.Analyseer deze cloud. Het is vast en zeker de goede, namelijk: de 
   aankomstcloud van je tegenstander. Selecteer Autopilot op
   deze cloud. Ga in `frontview' mode.
14.Gebruik tijd-compressie tot het moment dat het schip verschijnt. 
15.SAVE GAME!
16.Als het schip nog een paar kilometer verwijderd is: selecteer Manual
   Control. Schieten! Schieten! Schieten! 
17.Als de Energy Bomb vitale/dure onderdelen van je schip beschadigt, laad het
   laatstgesave'de spel en ga naar 16.
18.Als de tegenstander vernietigd is, terug naar de plaats waar je de
   opdracht hebt aangenomen

Het is mij op deze manier gelukt om een enorm schip met 63(!) shields
neer te halen (was wel een uurtje schieten...:-( )

Frank (Elite, Sergeant-Major, Serf) alias Fritz (Competent, Private, die rang
boven Master en Sir)

PS Nog een tip: ga niet voor geld spelen Dat is veel te gemakkelijk. Geld is
   alleen een middel om hogere rangen/medailles te krijgen.

There's  no  such  ship.  I use a Constrictor for a very long time now, and
I'm  completly  satisfied.   However,  there's  no  'adequate room for some
cargo'..   The  Constrictor  is  very fast, and can move around 4 quadrants
with one cargo of fuel (with military-3 drive, 4MW beam, 2 shields, and all
the standard equipment).

I'm  currently  'working'  on  my Federal and Imerial ranking.  Does anyone
know systems to do this fast?  I found out that there is plenty of stuff to
transport  from  Feace to Vequess (both near Achenar) for Imerial Navy, and
95%  can  be  done  in  time  (only  3 or 4 lightyears distance).  What I'm
looking  for is a similar constellation with Federal Military offering many
jobs (5-15) per flight.  Any tips?

I did not radar target it as I did not have time, BUT how many
ships do you know that are octagonal?  It was definitely a Thargoid.

too shocked at its attaking me (Huh? Wah! boom!)

Simple when you now how. First approach the planet until it just about fills
your view. Then look on the surface for a grey dot the size of a pixel. If you can`t find it then speed up time for a few hours, so the planet rotates. If you
still can`t find it then fly to the other side of the planet, then repeat. If you can`t see it your on the wrong planet or your blind. When you find it click on it and then follow the tunnel. If you have F10 on, then as you get nearer it should say a with
 a bar on top (you`ll understand when see it).

For all of you who are not high enough ranked and you want some action (and to seriously improve your elite rating), the goto Ross 128, Grant's Claim. Do as above one grey dot is Mathew`s Starport, the other is a Milatary Base. Get too close then you`ve g
ot some company. 

Disclaimer: If you get blown to bits don`t blame me.

Hope this help.

Hmm... I went there and couldn't locate the military base you speak of.
I did take off from Matthews, fly around the planet, see a small gray dot
and target it... but it turned out to _still_ be Matthews, somehow showing
through from the other side of the planet. (I hate the way you can see
stuff below the horizon in Frontier... try flying from London to Paris
manually to see what I mean...)

Has anyone else, not yet high enough in rank to get photography missions,
found bases?

How many assassinations do you have to carry out to get promoted, anyway?

You'll learn to regret your allegiance, Imperial lackey...

(Here's a dream: Frontier as a net-wide game, controlled from a central
server with people linking into it from around the world. Thousands of
players at once, jetting around the universe, running missions, trading,
pirating, dogfighting each other, being assigned by the Feds or Empire
to head off other players who are trying to complete military missions...
_Damn_, but that would be fun!)

Have you got the patch that lets you get back to Intuition by

I saw this mentioned in comp.sys.amiga.games a week or so ago,
and no, I don't think it is mentioned in the manual.

Imperial couriers can only hyperjump 10.42 light years.  You
can't upgrade the engines since they are 'an integral part of
your ship', and I've never seen one for sale with a size 6
engine.  :-(

People reckon the constrictor is best.  I have my doubts.

Don't forget to take animal skins and live animals from Facece to Vequesse
and slaves back, you can get a few Navy missions done that way round as well.

PS Does anyone know where to buy Naval Missiles in Imperial Space?

There are two kinds of small circles, one is yourself, the other one is for
hyperspace  clouds.   When  you  arrive,  accelerate,  take out the map and
scroll the time-axis, then you can see you moving away from the cloud.

There  are also unlabeled +'s, which represent other ships.  You can target
them and use a radar mapper to identify them, or fire up the autopilot.

This is especially useful when you do an assassination mission and arrive a
few  hours too late in the system where the enemy lifts off.  You then take
out  the map, zoom to the starport/spacestation, and target every spaceship
near  to  it.   Often you still find your enemy, although you're 10 or more
AU's  away.   Keep  it  in  the  radar  mapper and wait for the information
disappear - now the enemy went through hyperspace.  Pause the game, and use
the  Cloud  Analyser to find out his destination (the Analyser works 50% of
all  cases  on  that  large  distance),  and  you can probably complete the
mission although you were far too late.

> Imperial Courier.  Is it worth it?

No,  as  long  as you don't do trading, I strongly recommend a Constrictor.
It's  small  (hard  to  hit)  compared to the Courier, it's faster, and has
enough  cargo  to  hold  29 tonnes of fuel (about 3 jumps  15 lightyears),
although  being  equiped to do missions and beat any enemy if you're not an
absolute  beginner in combat.  I get killed with it about 1% of all fights,
most  times  because  I was smoking a cigarette or drinking something while
the "Ship is under attack" message appeared and therefore had no hands free
to disable the autopilot early enough...  ;^)

You know, maybe this is just a sign that the Amiga software market is
finally maturing. Companies like Origin have been doing this sort of

Say, I just got an idea.

Okay, everyone knows that Frontier is buggy as hell. But why is that? Didn't
Braben/Gametek beta-test the program before they released it? Yes and no.
No, they didn't seem to test it BEFORE the release, but yes, they are testing
it NOW!

What a brilliant concept for a software company. Save money by not hiring
real beta-testers and have the customers act as beta-testers instead. The
best part of course is that now the beta-testers are _paying_ for the "privi-
ledge" of being beta-testers! Brilliant, I tell you! We're all one BIG
group of beta-testers and we seem to have Dino Dini as our leader (sort of),
since he's collecting our bug-reports & game suggestions. What a great 
set-up, isn't it? For the (software) company, I mean...

Of course, it won't work another time, because we all now know this dirty
trick. Next time we'll make Gametek (or any other company that tries to
pull a stunt like this) pay us, won't we?!

Just a thought... :)

OK, up front I'll admit I'm a bit dim (actually stressed out, but who
cares?).
So caveats aside, I'm in need of some basic stratagies in getting started
with Frontier. I've read the manual section on how to get from Merlin
to Barnard's Star where I make a few bucks selling fish. But what then? it
seems that all other inhabited star systems I can find are "OUT OF RANGE"
(i.e. more than the 8ly my ship can go). I can't even seem to get back to
Merlin without constant attacks. I'm still quite bad at combat, especially
with the limited pulse beam weapon on the little ship you start out with.
Am I just supposed to go back and forth between Merlin and Boston Base
doing trade until I get enough cash to get a longer ranged ship and better
weapons? (I hope I'm missing something obvious, so please tell me!) 

I really feel dumb since I was an Elite pilot in the original game several
years back (am I that much older?). Anyway, I need some tips for survival
and travel at the biginning of the game. Thanks to all that reply!

Hey Steve,
  There are several star systems in range of your 8ly machine,
unfortunately alot of them are Anarchic planets and require fair( to good)
fighting skills to get through.
  The safest bet (for awhile anyway) is to go between bernard's star and
Sol, which is in your reach. or to cross the line and smuggle illegal goods
from merlin.  Anywhere usually has illegal goods, but bernard's is
generally the safest bet.  HINT: try to look for Honest John's in the
bulletins to unload your illicit cargo. ( he is usually the safest). 
Mercury in the Sol system is a good place to sell stuff to for a good
profit.  Experiment a bit the more your rotate the star map( with the right
mouse button and moving the mouse) you will notice that alot of systems
LOOK out of range, but they actually aren't.
                             SHADOWLORD
p.s. How do you use the cargo and fuel scoops??  Totally lost on this one,
but I have a theory that it doesn't work unless you have empty space on
your ship.
What is a hyperspace cloud analyser for?

Following the discussion on drives and ranges, some people sugested other ship options, well I have an asp explorer with a military drive (class3) giving 12 ly range. 6 shields, energy booster, 4 MW beam + cooler, hyp analyser, r mapper and other bits and
 bobs but I still have about 25 tons of cargo to play with meaning 
I can still trade, with all my weaponry on board (ie trade in rough systems)

Of course its a good idea to take some spare military fuel with you if you are going to a retarded system. but get this, I ran out of mil. fuel in eta casseopiea (spelling?) . This is the main federal naval base. with no mil. fuel.
stunning. I was so sick - the only way to get out was to sell my ship for an asp with a class three civvy drive and I lost a lotof money because there was such a low tech level there that they couldn't remove my shields or other goodies.
Anyway sorry to rant.
The point is, if 12 ly is enough for you then I would recommend this set up to anyone. The ability to take cargo on misions often pays too. You can take cargo to the base and sell it while you wait for your victim.

Ahh, but you're all forgetting your siliplaston pilots seat
its in the manual folks (I read the manual in bed until my eyes give up, but I only go to bed when my reactions are so shot I cant fly anymore)

The manual claims that the pilot's seat wraps around the pilot like a
fluid, and humans can endure huge accelerations if immersed in fluid.
At a certain point, however, the lungs has to be filled with some kind
of fluid to prevent them from collapsing from their own weight - this is
far above 22 G however.

I cant remember the exact figures, but I seem to remember that a human which
had had all air-filled spaces in the body filled with fluid, and then immersed
in fluid, could withstand several thousand Gs.

It would -unfortunately- make it totally impossible to predict which way
a ship would be heading the next instant, thus making dogfighting impossible.
An invaluable feature in reality, a poor one in a sim.

I know that you all hate to lose the adrenalin rush that the
warning klaxon gives when your ship is under attack, but you
can get around the scanner problem by pausing until the
scanner clears.

A note on the manual, in the ship section, any Guns number
with "+F" means that the ship can take a fuel scoop.  No
"+F", no fuel scoop.

Enjoy,

You should try Veliaze, it's 2 quadrants up and 1 left of Sol.

Dear Frontier users,
 I am just wondering what is the average age of this newsgroup. I am
beginning to think that at 28 I am probably one of the eldest beings
posting to this newsgroup and so I usually refrain from voicing my
(Jurassic?) opinions. However, enough is enough and I am fairly
disappointed to see so many people looking for BUGS in frontier instead of
bloody enjoying the game. I wonder how many of these people ACTUALLY
played the original Elite (as I did) as soon as it appeared on the market.
I remember that at the time only a few could afford a disk drive and that
I had to save my positions on a cassette recorder (probably have it still
around somewhere). Three days ago I bought frontier (and not thanks to
many of the comments appearing in this newsgroup) and, by Gawd, its
exactly what we dreamed of having ten years ago!!!. I feel sorry for those
of you who can't enjoy but, believe me, it's your loss and not mine. 
  Bye to all the oldies.

No you aint. I got it on my ZX-Spectrum when it 1st appeared. I had
a 48k (RAM that is), and Elite was unbelievable then - the whole
street used to play on my machine - the rubber keyboard got worn
out really quickly etc etc - my false teeth stop me from continuing.

These young whipper-snappers havent got a clue. Elite II is an excellent
game - with VAST potential for improvement. Braben has stated that
he is interested in developing a CD-ROM version - the missions could
be so detailed - voice for all interactions - heaven. The cries
for improvements are fair enough, but those who want must wait, updates
themselves must be found to be bug-free - or theres no point. Its hardly
a month since release - patience is a virtue, and its taken 5 years to
get this far. 

As a working person, I cant play this game to death like I did as a 
kid on Elite I. Im not finding some bugs cos Im not looking for them
and luckily the PC version appears to have fewer then the Amiga.

Dont worry old boy, when we get our zimmers we can still use out
joysticks till we die.

I do not second the motion. I like to read about frontier, and I'd
probably have difficulties getting rec.games.frontier. Also, I am not
sure about how long the interest is going to be maintained. It is true
that much/most of the traffic in CSA.Games currently revolves around
Frontier, but unless datadisks are released, this will change.

I say: Wait with setting up a new group until it is known whether
data disks will be released for frontier. AFAIK there's only vague
promises from Braben this might happen, nothing concrete.

Hello!

I've just bought Frontier since I've seen the hughe discussion about it in this
newsgroup. Because I haven't owned the game until now I really haven't followed
all of the postings regarding this excellent game.

I have the following questions (which I'm sure have been brought to your
attention before):

I have problems to complete the missions supplied by the Federation in time. I
thought this was due to the Eagle being a *slow* ship but I bought a Gecko and
the problem still remains. :(

How long has it taken for you other guys to work you up a bit? I have played it
for about 10 hours and I have upgraded my ship only once! Frustrating even if
it prolongs the life of the game...

The cargo space in the ships seem to be very limited. At least in the Eagle and
in the Gecko. You have always (almost) more money than you can spend in goods
alone.

Can you trade in illegal goods on federation planets? Those bl**dy cops always
catch me! :-/

Oh yes. You wouldn't say that Frontier crashing sporadically on my A3000 a
killer? You wouldn't call the fact that I've only ever found a _working_
bulletin board on about 3 planets (all the others show a magnified view of
the stockmarket screen which doesn't even scroll) a killer bug? The former
is only evident on my '3000, but both occured on my A500+. Maybe throwing a
large amount of memory at it isn't good (6meg and 4 meg respectively)?

SOme of us would really like a working version. I'd realy like to do some
missions- at the moment I'm travelling back (from -19,4) to Sol just so I
can get to a working bulletin board. This is't fun when the game keeps
dying.

:(

Neil.

    The original doesn't have any killer bugs. There are some annoying
    bugs, but they can be easily worked around, and some of them are
    good to have anyway, and shouldn't be fixed.

    I'd rather see add-ons.

Hello!

I was just playing Frontier and making a delivery to a system in the outskirts
of the galaxy. I had no idea that there was a *lot* of pirates in this area and
I had to shoot down 7 of them to be able to continue. After doing this I saved
the game and did not check for damage. (Stupid I know). It seems like the last
ship I blew away schratched my autopilot!

My question is:

How can you fly to a planet without the autopilot? (It must be possible.... )

    My autopilot still crashes if it's trying to fly through a planet,
    and if it's trying to get into an orbiting station. Both occur
    with and without time compression. Flying through a planet is
    fatal, but the orbiter damage is always very minor.

I have been playing Amiga Frontier for about a week now, and dispite the
bugs it is a great game.

A friend of mine has just bought it for the PC, and I thought that I would
do a quick comparison:

-  The box and manuals are almost identical.  The only difference is that
   the quick-start guide has a slightly different arrangement of icons on
   the last page.  They both come on two DSDD disks.

-  The PC version uses a 256 colour screen mode, and the Amiga uses a 16
   colour mode.  This doesn't actually make very much difference.  As people
   have said the PC version does texture mapping, and it looks *horrible*.
   I turned it off immediately.

-  The Amiga has square pixels, and VGA has 4x3 pixels, so on the PC all the
   planets look slightly egg-shaped.

-  Neither game allows you to exit.

-  The saved commanders between Amiga v1.00 and PC v2.00 are not compatible.

-  Ceimiss sells Precious metals for -3000 on both.

-  The game "feels" nicer on the Amiga, but my 386DX/40 runs it much smoother
   than my 68000/14 (which is not really a surprise).

-  The Amiga version cost $A70, and the PC version was $A90!


It's a great game on either platform.  Has anyone seen (or even heard of)
the Atari ST version?


Phil.

I am trying to collect a set of undocumented (in the manuals) commands for
Frontier.

Here is what I have already:

-  Double clicking on the zoom icon when in orbital view will zoom the
   current object all the way in.  This has the same effect as holding down
   the zoom icon for ages.

-  After using the communications icon, there are lots of places where you
   have a list of options.  You can select an option buy pressing the
   numbers on the numeric keypad.  The first option is 1 etc.  So to fix all
   the damage on your ship, you can press the following keys in order (no
   mouse-clicks): F4 (comms) KP1 (shipyard) KP2 (repairs) KP4 (fix).  You
   can hold down KP4 and it will auto-repeat, so there is no need to kill
   your mouse!


Have fun,
Phil.

Cant say I noticed any more colours than on the amiga version, apart
from the texture mapping anyway...

Well if you key ctrl-c on the pc version, it exits pretty well...
(And if you get the right patch, X on the Main screen exits with the amiga 
version..)

True, but again as i've said before, try on a 030 or 040 and see it really fly..

  As far as I know, you can use the keyboard number keys [main keyboard]
also. 

BTW- The manual says U can move around galactic chart using cursors,
try using shift-and-cursors.... Much easier isn't it?

16. Ability to build custom ships:
	i.e. design your own completely new ships

17. Better communication with other ships.

18. Intelligent crew that you can order to do things. With your multiple ships,
	you completely crew a ship and order it's commander to trade.

    Each crew member should have talents, whereby some are better engineers,
    	others better helmsmen etc.

19. Ability to dock with other ships, so you can

	(a) Fly a ship that won't fit into a space station, to trade you
		order some of your crew to shuttle the cargo off the
		ship using smaller craft (which are also carried within the
		ship, leading to)

20. New feature of ship, docking bay, plus docks, so that you can fly a really
	massive ship, and carry a fleet of fighters, or smaller scout ships.

21. Map updates as you explore new systems.

22. Ability to settle new worlds.

23. Ability to post messages on bulliten boards, asking for crew, offering money
	to do jobs, issuing contracts etc.


Thats enough for the moment.....

You know, I hear alot about the Constrictor and the Asp... plus a few people
who like those winged crates (Panthers).  I CAN'T be the only one around here
who flies a Tiger Trader can I?  Put in a class 6 drive and you've got a jump

Count the 'Right on Commander' messages you get.  I think it's 5 between
Competent and Dangerous, 7 between Dangerous and Deadly, and 9 between Deadly
and ELITE.  Might be off by 1 on any of those because I wasn't really keeping

It wouldn't be so annoying if they'd come out and said that right at
the beginning: What we've given you is just the first part; there's
plenty more to come, and that's a rock-solid promise. As it is we're
left hanging. Sure, Braben _says_ he wants to do more stuff, and there's
no reason to believe he's being insincere, but the corporate wizards
(snort) at Konami and Gametek might have ideas that don't precisely
coincide with Braben's... they might carelessly delay Frontier add-ons,
or cancel them, or (worst of all) release only the PC version -- which
of course doesn't bear thinking about.

That's it! _That_ is what Frontier's really missing. Yes, there are
other people cruising around, trading and stuff, but the pirates always
make a beeline for _me_. It's not like I usually have anything more
valuable than a couple tons of Radioactives on board when I warp into
a system... the pirates are welcome to that if they want it :-)

I want to go protect people from pirates and earn their undying respect.
Maybe pull a fellow Federation agent out of the fire if he's trapped
by Impies... all sorts of things. There are so many _possibilities_ in
the game engine...

In PC Player which I bought today Braben openly says that Frontier is
just a skeleton on this release, and missions, aliens, ships etc will
be added in upgrade packages using the Frontier engine. His justification
was that he wanted to add viable alien scenarios rather than a rush job.

Can't help feeling ripped off, having to fork out xxx pounds to get the

Yep, sounds like this amazing game that was out on archimedes.
Came in 7 different parts, but at least they offered cheaper upgrades...

Btw did anyone ever see the archimedes version of elite!
BLOODY HELL
thats what frontier should have been like.

It had amazing graphics, and to top it all:
SPACE BATTLES.

Yep, just think of it, other ships being attacked, not just you....

You could help out in navy battles with the Thargoids and everything
Looks like braben could have taken a few pointers from that game....

Btw - how are the pirates gonna get the gargo from the space when they
don't have a fuel scoop? And if all they want is the gargo, it would
be cool to broadcast to them "Ok suckerz you win, I'll give you the /$#$#
gemstones" and the jettison the gargo to space... think about that.
Some kind of Starglider-type tractor beam for collecting gargo would
be much more cool than the fuel-scoop system.

>How can you fly to a planet without the autopilot? (It must be possible.... )

Possible, yes.  Not even particularly difficult.  Just target the port you want
just as you normally would with autopilot.  Make certain you have f10 on so you
can see the names of things and targetting tunnels from the options menu.  Then
just fly down the 'tunnel' until you get where you are going.  Be careful about
your speed though.  Slow down as you get closer, and when you actually go in to
dock you want to be down in the km/HOUR (not second) range.  Then request
docking clearance and put your landing gear down.

Might take a little practice if you aren't used to manual control, but it's
fairly easy... and probably safer than letting that damnfool autopilot do the
docking in any case.  :)

	Well, personally I think that Frontier NEEDS these patches
	[and a newsgroup] VERY MUCH. Even semi-legally-infringing]
	posting of patches would be much appreciated, and _should_
	not be frowned upon, cos if GameTek aren't going to do it
	we should just forget about them. [I'm sending my registration

I have V1.05, and can get hold of V1.00 to create a patch, if somebody
could tell me what software would a) work, and b) be most convenient
for the majority of Amigans out there. Would GNU diff do the trick?

I would be willing to post this patch (by email) to anybody who asks
for it. I am not sure it is legal, but what I'll do is ask each person
for a letter from the manual (Just like the real game, and I'll bet
no Euro-hackers can crack the protection out of MY brain. :-) ).
Anyone who doesn't get it right, doesn't get the patch.

How does that sound to you all? (I would v.much like advice on the
legality of this. Dino?)

Wrong! The PC version DOES allow you to exit (Ctrl-C from the main
menu!) 

And there is patches to allow exit from the Amiga version.

Here's some more:  (I'm running Frontier on my PC, so I can't vouch for these
on the Amiga, but I should think they're the same)

 -  Hold down <Alt> and use arrow keys to move the pointer without using
    the mouse.

 -  pressing h does a hyperspace jump, and this also works when viewing
    the galactic map, so you don't have to switch back and forth between
    the map and the cockpit.

 -  Arrow keys move the camera around in the external view of your ship.
    Does anyone know how to zoom in and out in this view?!

I think that 40 quid for such a limited engine is a joke and the 
corporate rip off merchants will cream their pants at the concept
of 10 or 20 200K modules at 20 quid a throw... I think you'd be
lucky if it was PC only...

I disagree. Braben has obviously put a lot of work into the Frontier ENGINE. 
It`s just the bits around it that havn`t quite been perfected :-)  Gametek et. 
al. would be mad to miss out on the chance to market the add on modules even 
at a low price. Besides, it all depends on who owns the rights to Frontier. If 
Braben wants the game expanded and holds the rights to it then the 'corporate 
rip off merchants' have two choices. One, let him expand the game and market 
the modules. Two, let Braben write the modules and market them himself via the 
public domain reaping in a fortune compared to what he is (probably) making at 
the moment. I mean, ten quid a module direct from Braben, all the profits 
going to him? I guess that Gametek have a stranglehold on the rights to the 
Frontier engine to stop him doing this. Shame! I for one hope that the engine 
is as expansible as rumored and look forward to a good many modules to come.

BTW Whomever posted the article about creating patches for Frontier and 
distributing them with their own form of copy protection; Damn Good Idea! This 
is what Gametek should be doing... Do they HAVE e-mail?

Hi there,

Did anyone notice the possibility of making screendumps? Well it is
possible :-) just by pushing the '*' on the Num. Keypad.

If you do so a few times and quit the game and look in your frontier
directory ... there are some ********.IMG files in the directory. 

My question is ... How do I look at them? The commonly renowned program
VPIC doesn't recognise the .img format (maybe in frontier itself?)

Let me know,

Jurriaan.

Try + and - on the numerical Keypad! (but it describes the distance between 
camera and ship. So - is closer and + is further:)

Hi,

I have detected a trick to avoid the scanner problem:


1. Don't watch the space during flight. Watch the map!
2. If you are under attack switch back to normal view.

ok it works very often (not always :()

It saves some seconds and that can be the difference between life and death.

But badnews: doing so the autopilot doesn't avoid other ships and astroids :)
so sometimes you hit one (i.e. in the near of space station)

and its very boring watching map ;)

    Dangerous, Sergeant-major.  Improved from competent yesterday

I've just finished reading through the article myself. One
of the interesting bits among the actual article itself was where
they *claimed* you could blow up a space station, and to back this
up there was a picture of a space station blowing up. To be quite 
honest though the picture could have been one of all the vipers blowing
up as they exit the space station :-) They also claimed you could blow
up buildings on planets - still haven't managed that.

The interview I though, was pretty unrevealing, with him saying as long
as theres a demand he'll keep churning out add on modules ( no mention
of bug fixes ), including extra mission types and aliens. For the PC
they'll be graphics enhancements ( SVGA driver ), no mention of the 
amiga version. On the add on disks new ships, and planets!!

Finally he said that he'll almost definitely NOT be producing an 
ELITE III, but the chances of a CD-ROM version of Frontier are good!

So the outlook is indeed sunny for the future :-)

I hope the game's more reliable than the demo. It worked the first
time after I downloaded it: now it crashes every time.

I have.  You need to be an Imperial Baron or the equivalent Federation rank
(whatever is one above Major... don't have it yet).  They give you a nuclear
missile and say 'go destroy this.'  I'm thinking that the space stations may
come next... kinda like they start you out assassinating piddling little spies
and then move you up to enemy governors and senators.

Try using + and -. I think they work the wrong way round, because I'm
always zooming in when I want to zoom out, but they're extremely handy
for admiring the cities, and for jsut having a good look round.

I am curious...  As an old Elite player I found keyboard controls to be
infinitely better than using a clumsy joystick. I could never do any
precision flying in such an imprecise sluggish manner that the joystick
controls offered.  I have not yet purchased Frontier due to its unavailability
in Canada, but could someone please tell me if the 'old' keyboard controls
are still intact in the new game??  I don't know if I want it otherwise..

Still waiting...

Well I dont really know more.
Just that about a yea and a half ago I considered getting an archimedes,
basically because of Elite.
It was awesome.
The only bit I saw was a demo of a hyperspace jump.
WShen the ship came out the other end, there were all these dots in the distance
with laser fire everywhere.
The demo then rolled into the battle, helping out large traders...
And that was all I saw.
I saw screen shots etc, but nothing else about gameplay.
Looked a lot better than frontier for space battles anyway.
Ill see if Ive still got a review and type it in for ya...

(Anyone got an archimedes emulator for the miggy?????!!!)

Alan.

Heard of, to the extent that Gametek are still playing the game of sliding
release dates with it.  That is, they still say it will be released, in a
few weeks' time; a few weeks later, it will be released in a few weeks'
time; etc.

Has anyone heard of a pirate version of the Atari ST version?  I've read
here about the Amiga version being pirated before it was released.  I've
heard of a pirate version for the PC, presumably also pre-release because
it had even more bugs than those discussed here (apparently you can't sell
the 1MW pulse laser from the Eagle fighter because the shipyard doesn't
think you have one).  I have not heard of a pirate version for the Atari ST.
Guess which format hasn't been released yet.

Disclaimer: I'm not looking for a pirate copy for the Atari ST, or any other
machine.  I'm looking for information about them.  What I would like to know
is, did Gametek release Frontier on the PC and Amiga, perhaps prematurely,
because pirate copies were already circulating and they were worried that too
many people would get pirate copies before they could get real copies?

Actually, I was looking around at some of the trading ships in a system
by targeting them on the system map and using the radar mapper, and one of
them had a hull condition of 48%!  I didn't touch him!  Never actually seen
other ships killing eachother, though, except for the police :)

24.  Surface graphics on the planets done like Commanche Maximum Overkill 
(This used the best "texture mapped" type terrain I've seen, the
packaging blurb called it Voxel technology). Often the graphics in this
looked just like the sort of thing JPL comes out with for fly overs
of mars etc.

25  Interior graphics for Ships/Space Ports/Towns done like Doom (or
at least if the game lives up to its screen shots).

Just dreaming I know .... sigh.

Ted.

P.S. applogies for posting comparisons to PC games in an amgia news group
but a) this is the defacto frontier group and b) the graphics
in the above game are better than I've seen in an Amiga game ...
please don't flame me cause I'm not saying that the Amiga can't do this
I'm just say I (that just me) havn't seen it done yet on an Amiga.

I found yet another bug -- I tried using a Boa trader, mounting weapons in
the lower turret. Well I ended blowing myself up in the first battle. It
seems that the bottom turret weapon always hits your own ship.  At first I
thought I was shooting my undercarriage, but even with it up, every shot
would do damage to my ship.  Even with -90' elevation, they'd hit inside.

Actually, I'd manage to blow my Panther Clipper away a few times with
turret shots to my own ship.  This is a tolerable bug -- I just am very
careful when elevation is near 0', but it'd still be nice to have a
'safety cutout' that prevents these kind of accidents...


Oh, um, I experimented with mining a few times.  Landing on planets is a
pain.  And once you've got your miner down, landing again to clean it
would be simpler if the autopilot would remember to drop the landing gear
when it landed. :-7

:   Have any of you seen Privateer or xwing?
:   That's what frontier combat should have been like!
:   If only.....

      No way.

      I played both Privateer and Frontier (I have a PC and an Amiga
      mind you :-)) and Privateer doesn't even come close to Frontier.
      The only thing Privateer has is "intelligent missions" (ala Wing
      Commander). But once you're through with them, you sell your
      game. Not so with Frontier. Not to mention the breathtaking space
      flight mechanism in Frontier, whereas Privateer won't even let
      you approach a base or a planet.

      Being both an Amiga and a PC player, I'm beginning to have some
      understanding of what sort of games are expected on
      these two machines. Frontier has gone almost completely
      unnoticed on PC (the cs.ibm.pc.games group hardly contains one message
      per day about it). PC players want well beta-tested, polished,
      straightforward games. Amiga players are more demanding
      (probably because the game industry is older on Amiga than PC)
      and a masterpice like Frontier is appreciated to its true value.
      PC gamers will only see the bugs and declare the game
      uninteresting. Sad.

      I suspect PC players will reach one day the maturity of Amiga
      ones one day (and I really don't mean to sound superior here, I
      enjoy PC games as well as Amiga's). This seems to be the trend
      as demonstrated by the Wing Commander / XWing / Privateer series
      (from the best to the worst).

Graphically looks like its 320X200X16, color pallette is fairly
monochromatic, although the space scenes use 2-3 more colors. As far as
detail in terms of stellar modeling, it's about as accurate as you're
going to see on a DSDD floppy, perhaps more so. After the eta testing
phase is over, I'll probably buy the elta when it comes out in April:)

This is very odd. :-)

I use the mouse and think that is the best control.  The joystick is
the slow, so would be the keyboard I guess (haven't actually tried
it).  Only with the mouse can you yank around your ship fast enough to
follow ships passing close by your own ship.  In Frontier you need
very fast precision movements with your gunpoint, I am best at this
with the mouse.

You can select the old elite pitch/yaw controls on the options screen, but
sadly on the PC (which I have) the keyboard is VERY unreactive. A joystick
is the only way I can do space combat...

It is Ok for me (I mail ordered the version from the Uk) but here my friends
who
bought it have only french manuals.

You may want to ask for a detail of one of the "short stories" pictures for
non-english version?

Hello Frontiers !!

I think there are many more problems for a bug fix than
only the english/french/german/... manuals !!

Even all words in the german version are quiet different from
the english version. So this kind of patch would change a 
german V1.00 to an english V1.05 :-(

Moreover: what about the guys like me, who own a V1.01 or V1.0x ??

It should be there another method of patching FRONTIER to newer versions !


   HELLO  GameTek  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hi there SpaceDiscoverers,

I thought up a add-on to the Cemiess (-2,-2) cheat but havn't tried it out 
yet. Here it is:

- Make sure that you get about 40.000 Credits with the Cemiess-Liafeba
  route. (buy Precious Metals on Cemies' bulletin-board and sell them at
  Liafeba where you buy Robots which you sell at Cemies. Etc...This will
  take for about 2 1/2 months.).
  (+/- 75 tons of Precious metals will be left.)

- Make sure that you are on Cemiess (-2,-2).

- Now take a look at the Ships-Exchange-Market and see if you can buy a
  ship for about 37.000 credits. (Adder or something else)

---------Two possibilities--------:

- (1) There is only one of such a ship.
- (2) There are two or more of those ships.

---------Possibility (1)----------:

- Buy that ship ... +/- 3000 Credits left. The ship will be empty except
  for the hyperdrive-system and will have about 15 tons of free cargo.

- Go to the bulletin board and buy 15 tons of Precious-Metals: 
  15 * +/- 3000 Credits = +/- 45.000 Credits. => total of 48.000 Credits.
  60 tons of P.M. left.

- Buy your old ship back for -37.000 Credits. => total of 85.000 Credits.
  Magically your ship has been stripped from everything except the
  Hyperdrives and has 13 tons of free cargo.

- Buy 13 tons of Precious-Metals and buy the 37.000 Credits ship.
  => you earn 2000 credits with this step (not much but you can
  considder buying a more expensive ship and go on with your
  discoveries.) => Total of 87.000 Credits

- If you go on like this until all the precious metals are out of stock
  you will have earned about 200.000 Credits !!!!! And then there will
  be about 30 tons of Gems left (price -500 Credits).

---------Possibility (2)---------:

- Do the same as above but change between the same sort of ships.

- No prospects on this one ... yet maybe somebody can let me know....

I can agree with your points, but I said that frontier could do with having
the COMBAT FROM PRIVATEER, you must admit frontier combat is not a patch that
on privateer/xwing.

	Well, I disagree very strongly. I'm a PC owner (I do not have
Amiga only because I don't have the time and money to have 2 computers) 
and an avid player of Frontier. The reason PC people don't write about
Frontier in PC.games is simple: they write their messages here. I personally
see no reason whatsoever dividing the discussion on two groups since
Frontier is similar on both machines. And it seems that many others see
it that way, too. Frontier is a wonderful game on PC, too.
	And please explain your last chapter.
	
	jours, Petri

	PS. I do not play WC, X-Wing or Privateer. But that doesn't matter,
does it?

A STORY FROM FRONTIER


As I came out of hyperspace, I noticed the typical imperial navy squabble on the
radio. Among the names mentioned, where those of 'Imperial Cruiser Executor' and
'Fort Roxxan'. My triggerfinger twitched, but I decided to check out how many
there were before I shot them down.

And I had passengers aboard. But Ilika Mansjon, a female b-star of dream-movies,
was quite bitchy towards me and the crew since my ship was three weeks behind
schedule. My ship had run into some rather cheeky pirates in the last system,
even though my 2000-ton Panther Clipper bristled with guns and rockets, the 20-ton
light pirate cruiser pilot bluntly said 'Ha! Surrender or die!'. He lived some
twenty seconds more. And we had to assasinate a mafia topgun, he was reduced to
space-debris within seconds. The plasma accelerator is a mean machine. So no
wonder we were late.

So, after some three days, we arrived at the spacestation. Ohjoy, two imperial
medium cruiser (that big thing in the intro), floated innocently twenty
kilometers from the spacestation, which was of the old hexagon type. 

I dropped of Ilika, she was furios and told she would report me to the
authorities, so I told her to stuff it, and be glad she still was alive. Anyway,
her career was soon over, dream-movies has no use for thirty old women
unfortunately. But I had to admit, her travel hadnt gone as planned, she was some
sixty LY from her destination.

I filled my ship with fuel and left the station. My crew noticed my rather grumpy
mood, and cheered my up with a collage of the latest 50 kills. I smiled at them,
and soon we were happy.

As we exited, I quickly targeted the first cruiser. And fired the front gun. One
second it was there, a mile long battle-ship, the next nothing but burnt metal
and depressurised body-parts. My crew cheered, but a klaxon sounded an incoming
radio-message. 'Piracy and murder cant be tolerated, 10.000 credits in fine'.
Hmm, I had 200 Mcredits, no problem. I lined up my ship against the second
cruiser. By now, cops were leaving the spacestation, but they seemed very bad
pilots, they either chrashed in the space-station or their neighbour, but
ofcourse some managed to get away. I fired the second time. The last of the
cruiser disappeared.

Quickly my Panther Clipper turned 180 degrees and started a continous deadly
plasma beam at the incoming police-ships. Pof, pof! They went down one after the
another. Soon noone remained. My hull had been reduced to 78 percent, but quickly
repaired itself. Now it was the space-stations time. I fired a five minutes
barrage at the hexgon shaped station. Nothing happended except that I was fined
another time for the same amount. How devastating.

Bored at seing the spacestation taking hit after hit, I payed the fine and
entered the space-station. Noone mentioned to me that I've just killed 20 of
their ships and two cruiser, they seemed very neutral they did. We tanked, used
the recreation and I spent 10 Mcredits on some obscure organisation. Shame they
dont have casinoes on the spacestations, easy way to win some (or loose).

We left shortly after.

Stig, Average, Panther Clipper w/what's in the manual, and 192 Mcredits.

Hello all,

Sorry for being a traitor and all - but I own the PC
version of Frontier. Don't slag me off tho' as I am still
an Amiga fanatic! :)

Anyway the point of this post is to say that I've seen my
first slamming of elite II in a magazine - PC Format. It only
got %50ish, whereas Amiga Format and most others have given 
it around 90%.

Basically , they complained that the graphics were nothing
special (so how many times have they seen a game where you
can land on a planet and watch planets, suns and stars all
sail past together with real-time rendering of curved vectors
and light/shadow effects!) They seemed to reckon that the
graphics were not a patch on x-wing (did they stop
to notice the super-space stations off mars - wow!)

So, just feel lucky amiga guys that you don't have to put
up with tosh such as PC Format (incidentally their coverdisk
was crap. Lucky amiga guys getting stuff like Imagine from
Amiga format).

It almost makes me wish I'd bought an A4000 instead :(
but it doesn't quite have true colour.

Oh well, see you.

Alex

Amiga Power (okay, I didn't buy it, read it at a newsagents, honest!)
slagged it off as well. But then unless its a platform game or mindless
shoot-em' up games never get a good review.

Whilst undertaking an assassination mission for the federal military the
target (a Panther clipper) did not jump into hyperspace after leaving the
space station. Since I was bored (after 1/2 an hour of game time) I fired
a missile at the ship and then engaged in a  succesful dogfight.

Since I had fired a missile close to a space station I expected to be
admonished by officialdom, however they were completely silent. Curiosity
fired, I went back to a saved gave and fired a missile at the panther
clipper _immediately_ it left the station, again no criminal record
despite destroying the ship within 100km of the station!

Now my question... is this a legitimate tactic or a bug?

Could the author of the Frontier patch please mail it to me?  I recently
purchased Frontier (v1.05, no less!), and the EXIT thing still doesn't exit the

Okay, I've accepted my first "retirement" contract in FRONTIER, but I
don't know how to carry it out, even though I've tried the obvious. 

I've sat around at the Starport until about 10 minutes before the
"retiree" was expected to depart (at 12:51:01, in this case.) Then, I
lifted off, hovering and hovering, waiting for my prey's ship to lift
off from the pad as well, intending to follow him out of the stratosphere.

Well, nothing happened. Nobody lifted off from the pad at Sirocco at
12:51:01. Well, I figured the game is saying, "Look, the guy's not stupid:
he sees some unidentified craft floating about, he's not going to come out
and play." 

So, I tried again: only this time, I hung around just outside of the
planet's atmosphere, at maybe 4 - 3K kilometers. Nothing. Do I need
special equipment to do this? Can I just do it with the stock Eagle I
start with? Am I going about this all wrong? HELP!

When you are doing assasinations on the planet surface, the best tactic
is to take off about 30 mins before the ship is about to turn up.
Instead of boosting out of the atmosphere, just fly your ship a little
way out of the starport, and rough land with your ship facing the
launch-pad.  Switch on text, and then time-skip to about a minute
before your target is about to take off.  Sure enough, your target
will appear, and you can lock onto him, engage autopilot and start
blasting.

(Be vary careful that you don't ram him - he's much bigger than
 you and the results could be .... unfortunate)

I've had exactly the same experiences. Annoying, isn't it?

No idea how to fix it, either.

God, I hope that's not a bug. I've been trying to get some answers on
assassination attempts, and assumed that I was just doing something wrong
when I was hanging out at whatever station, waiting to kill whoever --and
they never showed up. Someone tell me this isn't a bug. I'm going to be
pissed if this is a bug.

I have been out of the amiga game scene for quite some time.  Today I 
decided to read some game posts and I read about the game Frontier.
I have never seen anything about it before.  It sounds so cool.  So I 
have some questions about, since I can only afford to get 3 or 4 games
a year I like to make sure they will hold my interist for a few months.

Is it hard drive installable?
Does it crash on a 2.1 030 system?
What is the last version, I read that there were some
bugs in v1.00.  How do I know I am buying the latest version?
Where can I get it for a good price?  mail order or in south florida.
Is there a story line or do you just go on randomly generated missions?
What are the main improvements over Elite?  For example, new weapons
or new commands and functions, etc?
Is there a demo version?
Is the manual well done, explaining about the various ships and equipment
and stuff or do you have to figure it out by playing the game.

Since I have an amiga 2000 with an 030, a 486 33, and a mac IIfx
which version is the best, smoothest, best graphics?

(actualy only the amiga is mine, but the other two computers are my
parents, so I can use them all I want)
 
thanks.

Well, alot of people seem to have this problem, but in a total of somewhere
over 100 missions I've only ever had them not show up twice, and both times I
fixed that by restoring an old save and being sneaky.  Here's the deal;

The standard way to catch your target is to land at the port they are going to
be coming out of.  Make sure you have the right day (I once got there on
January 17 for a February 17 assassination).  Wait until the correct day and a
short time before the scheduled departure (how short ranges from 30 minutes to
30 seconds depending on personal preference really).  Now the important parts;

1:  Do not stay directly over the launch site.  If you do they will often not
come out until you move.  The way to spot this problem is if the launch bay
stays open after you leave (if you fly out and stop immediatly it will do this)
Get out of the way and the target will come out.

2:  The target usually comes out within 2 or 3 seconds before or after the
appointed time (see 1 above for an exception... there they come out a few
seconds after you get out of the way).

3:  The target usually does not stick around long.  95% of the time they will
either hyperspace or turn around and go right back to the base (I once had a
target in a Panther at the 82 Eridani system... the only base within range was
the one he came out of... could only hyperspace to one other system and there
were no bases there.  Thus he just came out and turned around and went back...
no matter what.  Had to use the missile bug to kill him right there).
Sometimes they will fly to another base in the same system... this is great but
don't count on it.

4:  If you are too far from the base you will never even see them come out most
of the time.  In this case you want to watch your system map (f2-f2).  At the
time they are set to depart (or right around then) a ship dot will appear on
the planet.  Target it and use communications (f4) to verify that it is the
correct ship (don't place a call, just get the 'Send message to ship xx-yyy'
message and check the registration number)

5:  Anywhere that it still displays your altitude should be close enough to
spot the target.  I prefer to hover over the base at about 10,000.  If they are
leaving an orbital station you want to still be able to make out the writing on
the station... maybe 6-10 km or thereabouts.


If you do all this (right date, exact time, close enough to see or checking
system map (f2-f2)) and they STILL don't show up then you've probably got what
I call the 'forewarned' feature.  I >THINK< this occurs based on a couple of
things.  First if the system the target is at is right next to the system where
the bulletin was posted (a target in Vequess on the bulletin board in Facece
for instance) then they might well hear about it.  Second, if you just sit
around outside the base for a couple of days they are likely to figure it out.
This is characterized by a couple of things;

A:  If you are waiting in the station the police suddenly pounce on you (often
days before the event) for 'piracy and murder.'  If this happens you have to
pay the fine and the target WILL NOT show up.  My suggestion... reload an old
save.

B:  If you are waiting outside the station for a long time the target will just
not show up.  Again I suggest reloading.

FIX:  Time your arrival.  Figure out how long the jump to the system and flight
to the base will take and then wait around in a neighboring system.  Time your
arrival at the target's base for about 5 hours before departure.  Land at the
base, refuel, get all your missiles stocked up, and launch a short time before
the target... they should come out as normal.


If you do ALL this and they still don't come out then all I can say is that it
must be a bug in your version because via this method I have NEVER failed to
complete an assassination.

Just a thought but couldn`t this be a FEATURE? I mean, both sides will have 
advanced intelligence and counter-intelligence staff (this being a cold war).  
It would be quite common for a target to get news of an assassination attempt 
and thus not show up when expected. Has anyone tried wandering around nearby 
star systems to see if the ship can be found in the area?

I think what he was trying to say was that it happens so often. If 4 in 5 
contracts fail because of counter intelligence, then it must be shit hot.

(also have version 1.00 and use wormhole to get to location
 in two jumps)

I found that the station missions are the worst.  Also
those at systems that have more than one star.  The
missions at stations would always be iffy.  The best
method is to hang around for a while at the point
where you jumped in, then make your run so you
will only have to wait at dock for less than two
days.  Take off about 15 minutes before the time,
and I usually backward thrust (-5.2 kmh) at almost
90 degrees from the door.  This seems to work for
me.

Planetary missions, you just take off early, climb
to 12,000km (jump range), and then wait around for
the target.  You will need to run accelerated time,
at normal time your ship will rise or drop.  I
usually kill the target before they jump and pay
the fine.  (missile, then kill = 600cr fine).

I also will take 2-5 missions at a time.  I make
sure that I have enough time between to get there,
and make sure that they are all single star,
and planetary if possible.

It took me 26 assassinations to move to lord, but
I wasn't immediately offered photograph missions.
I ran 6 more assassinations before I got recon.

Don't be so patronising. I had figured this out, but then I got to wondering
what difference the stack size made to a program that shut down the OS
anyway. Any way, it _doesn't_ work. At least, it hasn't for me.

Good grief.

Oh- and here's an AAARGHHH for you, too. ARRRGGGHHH.

Great.

Neil.

Bzzzt.  Spin again.  The program does NOT shut down the OS.  There are 3 ways
to crash Frontier that I am aware of;

1:  There are a couple of obcure bugs in the assassination sequence that can
cause a crash... I doubt you've gotten that far, so this is out. 

2:  You've got the stack size set too low so the game crashes at various
intervals when you do things it can't handle.  100000 seems to work fine.

3:  You've got processes running in the background and one of them suddenly
does something (open a new window for instance) that makes Frontier freak out.

Since you were under the mistaken impression that the OS was shut down it might
be number 3.  It can't be number 1 because that only occurs in specific
instances when you are a ways along in the game... not at random.  My money is
on option 2 though... seems to be the cause of 99.99% of the 'frontier sucks it
keeps crashing on me' cries.

Other than that it might be some problem I haven't seen.  Probably hardware
related.

I'd agree with this. If you're suffering a lot of crashes make sure nothing
else is going on. The number of crashes I've suffered has dropped a lot
since I quit the screen blanker under 3.0 :-( I'm not too impressed but
there you go. I could be paranoid or completely wrong but it's hard
to check.

Yeah- I have got that far. Weeks ago.

Nope. I've set the stack to 10 times this, and I've tried numerous values in
between.

Nope. I only run three background processes. Tool Daemon, Spliner (a
commodity), and Virus Checker. Even when I shut all three, there are
problems.

   I've booted my computer straight into the game, which also doesn't do the
trick.

No-pe. Frontier sucks- It's an excellent game, but for me on my bog standard
'3000 with softkick ROM and 6 meg ram, it's an unplayable game.

Yes, probably. Unfortunately, I have an absolutely bog standard '3000, save
for my extra memory (Have you run Frontier using "Nofastmem"?- It's so
slow.)

   Thanks for your input.

Neil.

You have to get a hex editor and poke through the executable, looking for
something like "Frontier Version 1.00 released to GameTek on (date)," where
(date) is approximately one year too early...

Load the sucker up into a text and/or hex editor and do a search for "Version".

Ooops.....  What I meant to say before is this:

Load it into, heck I dunno... A text editor like CygnusEdPro and search for:

Version

...and you should get something like the following returned to you:

Version to Gametek (Release 4) 1.05

(Thats what I got outa mine, at least)

 Just to know, how do you tell which version of Frontier
you have e.g V1.02? It isn't stated on the box or manual?...

Thanks.

No, everyone ignores it, because it happens ALL THE TIME....  :-)

Get a Moray Starboat! It's a bit smaller than Cobra MK III, but bigger than
Cobra MK I..  The hyperspace range is 20.96ly, if I remember correctly.

It is possible to use the traditional Elite keyboard controls which I
am very fond of in Elite, and I used on Frontier for a few days. I
soon learned, howvever, that the mouse is far better in Frontier than
the joystick or keyboard, certainly in combat situations.

Well, I've tried my stack at many many different sizes. I didn't think it'd
make a difference, if Frontier chucks away the operating system, but who
knows. So anyway, it still crashes. I've a hunch that it's certain save
files, ie I can play one save file for ages, but if I load a more recent
one, it's sure to crash. I save it far more (my more recent saves) to try
and "purge" the offending save files, but more often than nt the new file
still causes a crash.

   I wouldn't mind, but I haven't (until recently) exploited any bugs at
all. Then I found a bug so's you can make 300000 credits with two button
presses, and I made 2000000000 credits. :) Maybe unsurprisingly, the credits
thing loops round to - 2000000000ish. wierd. Or not.

    Sporadic crashing is difficult to analyse. I've had the thing
    crash, but only because I forgot to set the stack before starting
    it.

    The bulletin board problem can be avoided by ensuring the board is
    displaying the top item whenever you leave a base, and it can be
    overcome by fast-forwarding to the next day. It gets reset first
    thing very day (same time you get charged the docking fee).

    Fast-forwarding solves other problems too. It prevents the
    autopilot from crashing when you try to land, and I've run into a
    few places where it hasn't been possible to take off because your
    ship crashes just as it's leaving a covered base. A solution is to
    fast-forward straight after getting launch permission, and then
    fast-forwarding again when the message about your launch time
    expiring appears. For some reason the second fast-forward leaves
    you floating in space.

When I was having some fun blasting away Federal Military crafts after doing 
a photography mission for the Imperialists (by the way thanx to all the 
replies to my query as to how to complete these photographical missions...)
I got the message from Elite Federation.....Right On Commander! At last, at 
long BLOODY last I've finally increased my rank from Competant to Dangerous, 
I thought. Upon looking at my achievements screen I was still Competant. In 
fact nothing had changed at all..........So.......my question is why was 
this message sent to me in the first place........Could it be another in the 
long list of bugs whereby I was really awarded Dangerous status but a bug 
in the program did not increase my rank.......Am I doomed to be Competant 
forever? I assumed I had increased rank because this is the message I was 
familiar with when playing Elite on the Amiga. Is there is any other 
likely reason why this message was sent. Did I kill someone important in 
all the blasting? I'd really like to know! Any (viable) suggestions would 
be most welcome.


			Thanx in advance......


			Keep Blastin'...........

    It isn't necessary to target ships. I used to do that, but now I
    just swivel and fire, and leave the targetting alone. I had hoped
    that the little green square would assist in aiming, or that I
    could use the autopilot to aim, or that, like Elite, there'd be a
    beep when the ship was directly in my sights (useful for aiming),
    but none of these things have happened.

    I thought you had to target and then [R]adar ships to get
    bounties, but that isn't necessary either.
