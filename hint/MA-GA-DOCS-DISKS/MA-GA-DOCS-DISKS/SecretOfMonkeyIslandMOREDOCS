                        THE SECRET OF MONKEY ISLAND 
                      =============================


 READ THIS FIRST 
 IT'S IMPORTANT!
 
 Although you may have played other lucasfilm games, there are a few
 differnces in THE SECRET OF MONKEY ISLAND that you should be aware of.
 
 The interface you see to play the game now has an"auto-highlight"feature
 that hightlights an appropriate verb when the cursor touches an 
 interesting or useful object on the screen. For example, when the cursor 
 touches a door that can be opened, verb OPEN is highlighted on the screen.
 By pressing the right (or second) controller button or equivalent key 
 (see your reference card for details), you can automatically perform the
 highlighted action-in this case , opening a door. Don't worry, though
 , this won't give away solutions to any puzzles! 
 Also, you do not need to "double-click" on objects (or anything) to use
 or activate them. A single click of the controller button should be used
 consistently throughout the game.

 ABOUT THE SECRET 
 OF MONKEY ISLAND

 In the secret of the monkey island, you play the role of Guybrush
 Threepwood, a young man who has just hit the shores of a melee island.
 Our naive hero's travels have led to him to melee island in a quets to
 fulfill his life ambition .. to become a fierce, swashbuckling,
 bloodthirsty Pirate. Unbeknow to Guybrush, however, there have been
 some strange happenings in the area surroundding Melee island and the
 more mysterious Monkey island. As he walks into this maelstrom os mystery,
 Guybrush will soon be very aware that things are not what they appear
 to be, that even bloodthirsty pirates can be scared, and that there's
 more to being a pirate than swinging a sword and drinking grog !

 Here's where you come in ... You direct teh actions of Guybrush as he
 first explores Melee island and then ventures on to monkey island.
 On Melee island, Guybrush will have to prove himself worthy of becoming
 a pirate by completing THE THREE TRIALS. Trough the course of completing
 these trials, you and Guybrush will learn much about pirate life and
 local folklore. But dont be surprised if you find that some of the
 people you meet seem rather anachrosnistic!

 If this is your first computer aventure game, be prepared for an
 entertaining challenge. Be patient, even if it takes a while to
 figure out some of puzzles. If you get stuck, you might need to
 solve another puzzle first or find and use an object. But hang in there
 and use your imagination, and you will guide Guybrush to discover
 THE SECRET OF THE MONKEY ISLAND !


 PLAYING THE GAME

 After the opening title sequence and introduction, Guybrush will meet
 the official lookout for Melee island. When they've finished talking, 
 Guybrush wil walk down to the dock at one end of the town of Melee.
 You may begin directing his actions as soon as he gets to the dock.
 The screen is divided the following sections :

 1.The animation window is the largest part of screen and is where the
 animated action take place. It shows the camera's eye view of the room
 or location that the main character is in. Dialog spoken by the characters,
 as well as game-related, also appear here.

 2.The sentence line is directly below the animation window. You use this
 line to construct sentence that tell Guybrush what to do. A sentence
 consist of a verb (action word) and one or two nouns object).
 An example of a sentence you might construct on the sentence line is
 "Use shovel on dirt". Connecting words like "on" or "will" will
 automatically be inserted by the program.

 3.Verbs must be selected from the words in the columns below the
 sentence line. To select a verb, position the cursor over the word
 and press the left mouse button or the enter key.
 Verbs are highlighted in a bright color when an obvious use for them
 appears in the animation window. For example when GUYbrush is near
 a door that can be opened, positioning the pointer over the door 
 will highlight the verb OPEN. Pressing the right mouse/button or TAB
 key (to emulate the right button) will use the highlighted verb with
 the object , which in this case opens the door. But remember, although
 a verb is highlighted , that one verb may not be the only way to use an 
 object. Try the other verbs as well !

 4.The Inventory is the area to the right of the Verbs. At the beginning
 of the game inventory is empty. When GUYbrush picks up or is given an 
 object is added to the inventory. There is no limit to the number of 
 objects GUYbrush can carry (after all, he's young and strong!). When
 there are more than six objects in the inventory, arrows appear to the
 left of the list . Use them to move the list up or down.
       NOUNS (OBJECTS) can be selected in two ways. You may select a
 noun by placing the cursor over an object in the environment , and 
 all usable objects in the game , have names . If an object has a name ,
 it will apear on the Sentence line when you position the cursor over
 it. If no name appears for an object on the screen , you can be sure
 that it has no significance other than as part of the background. You
 may also select nouns by clicking on them in the inventory.
       TO MOVE GUYBRUSH AROUND, simply point the cursor where you want him
 to go , and click. Notice that Walk to is the default verb in the
 Sentence line-this is because moving around is what GUYBRUSH will be 
 doing most often.
       "CUT-SCENES"ARE SHORT, ANIMATED SEQUENCES-like scenes from a movie
 which can provide clues and information about the characters. They're
 also used to show special animated sequences, as when GUYBRUSH gets 
 himself into a fight while "exploring" a mansion. When you are viewing a
 cut-scene , you do not direct the action.

 Things to try in the town of Melee.

 Look at the poster on the first house at the dock. Select the verb look
 at with the cursor by pressing the left mouse button or the enter key
 . notice that the word "look at" appera on the sentence line. Position
 the cursor over the poster and press the left mouse button or enter key.
 This completes the sentence "look at poster" on the sentence line.
 If Guybrush is not already standing in front of the poster, he will walk 
 over to it and read it to you.
 Open the door of the SCUMM/BAR.
 Place the cursor over the door to the bar. You will notice that
 the verb Open is hightlighted. Press the right mouse button or TAB key
 to open the door.
 Go into the SCUMM/BAR.
 Talk to each of the pirates who pop up on the sentence line inside 
 the bar ... they'll provide you with useful information. See the next
 section entiltled "talking to characters" for more information.
 Talk to the important-looking Pirates seated in the adjoining room.
 They're full of good advice about how to become a pirate !
 See if you can outwit the cook to get into the kitchen for a look around.
 Once the kitchen, step out onto the dock ... you might be able to have
 some fun with that bird !


 TALKING TO CHARACTERS.

 
 There are plenty of colorful characters in the game with whow you can
 converse. Each person Guybrush meets will have something to say,
 wether friendly or unfriendly .. helpful, or unhelpful ! often,
 you can talk with someone at one point in the game, and the return
 to them later to get new information. To talk with a character,
 position the poinetr on them and press the right mouse button or the 
 Tab key to use the talk to to verb automatically.
 In a conversation, you will have to select what Guybrush says from
 among the possible phrases at the bottom of the screen. Just click
 on teh phrase you want him to say. Of course, what Guybrush says will
 affect how other people respond. And, as a conversation continue,
 you could be presented with a new array of dialog choices. Dont worry
 we'll never punish you for selecting the wrong or funny dialog response.
 After all, you're playing this game, have fun !
