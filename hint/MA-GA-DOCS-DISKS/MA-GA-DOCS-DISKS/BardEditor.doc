     Well, here it is.  The easiest method for CHEATING at Bards Tale.  I got
tired of all the mis- and partial information floating around about the
character data format for the Bards Tale Characters.  Use this program at
your own risk.

     Now to more productive notes.

   When you start the program, it will prompt you to put your character disk
in a drive (unless its already there), and will put up a requester with your
characters names.  Click the one you want, or you can type the name into the
string gadget manually.  When your character is loaded, the data for your
character will be displayed on the screen.

****************
NOTE: If you enter a name that doesn't exist on the disk, the program will
	complain to you, but will go ahead and display the character anyway.
	The stats for this new character will be zeros if you have just
	started the editor, or the stats of the last edited character.
      If you enter a null name, the editor will tell you it could not find
      "NIEMAND" on the disk.  DON'T PANIC!  Niemand is the German word
       for "nobody."  Niemand will then be shown with stats as in the note
       above.
****************

     After your character is loaded, you will be able to access several
menus at the top of the screen.

  The menus are:

    Open	- Open up a character file for editing.
    Save	- Save your character.
    Save As...	- Save your character under a new name.
    Quit	- Quit the editor.

Spells

SUPERMAN
    MAX ALL STATS - Here it is, the quick and easy way to make Superman
                    for your party.

    Here are the explanations.  When accessing the menus, you will see
submenus on most of the items.  On the Attributes, for example, there
are three subitems.

Set	  - To set a specific number for strength.
Max Legal - To set the maximum legal value.
Maximum	  - To set the maximum value.

     Now, there may be a problem in translation here - when I say maximum, I
actually mean the maximum the game (Bards Tale) will display without showing
asterisks.
     All the menu options follow the same general format.  When you try to
set one of the data items, an input prompt will appear at the bottom of the
screen.  You cannot enter a number higher than the highest number shown.

****************
NOTE:
 At the number prompt, to enter zero, hit RETURN without typing anything.
****************

     When you modify your possessions, a prompt will appear at the bottom
of the screen telling you what to do.  After you have chosen an item, you
will be asked if you want to equip that item.  Answer with a 'Y' or 'N',
then press RETURN.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
CAVEATS:
     If you equip an item on a character that can't normally use that item,
once you have started the game the only way to unequip it is to sell it,
trade it or drop it.  You will not even be given the Unequip option.

     Your modified character will NOT be saved unless you specifically do
so.  I consider this a safety feature rather than any real bother.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
KNOWN BUGS:
     SOMETHING eats 24 bytes of memory until you reboot, every time you run
the Bards Tale Character Editor.  Solution: do all your mods at the same
time.

CREDITS:
     Many, many thanks to Charlie Heath of Microsmiths for putting the
source code for his file requester out where everbody could get to it.
     Thanks to everyone else contributing to the public domain.  Good
support, without requiring "monetary renumeration", will keep the Amiga
alive and well no matter what happens.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
FLAMES:
     DOWN with SHAREWARE, UP with PUBLIC DOMAIN!  I can't stand someone
telling me I should feel guilty if I don't send them money for a program
I use once or twice, and which may or may not do what I want the way I
want to do it.
     Asking for a few bucks to cover printing costs on a bound manual, or
for source code to a major effort is not unreasonable, but some of these
guys are getting RIDICULOUS!  Come on guys, lets re-think our positions
here!  Hard sell may work on some, but a lot more will turn away.

OH, YEAH!
     This program is hereby released to the Public Domain.  The only thing
I ask is that you leave the copyright notice alone, and that you give this
doc file to anyone you give the main program file to.  I make no claims that
this program won't destroy your disks, on a machine that doesn't have a
finalized version of an operating system.  Its still one Heckuva machine!
