The first part of this game is  a journey into the depths of the Vietnamese
jungle, where the detail attempt to find a village where Viet Cong
querrillas are based. The jungle pathways are treacherous: booby traps lies
in wait for the hapless Gis, and the troop are constanly under the threat of
of ambush from VC assassins. A box of explosives have to be found in order
to blow up the bridge over which the platoon must cross. Failure to do so
allows a large VC band to follow the platoon and wipe them out.

Once in the village, a search of the surrounding huts leads to the discovery
of a torch, map and trapdoor which leads to the secret underground VC tunnel
system - which signals the second stage.

Deep in the tunnel system, the platoon, negotiate the daark labyrinth in
order to find a compass and a box of flares, vital for completion of the
next section. The tunnels are densely populated with VC querrillas who
constantly appear from behind corners or out of the murky water, and are
shot on sight to avoid further platoon casualties. There are several rooms
in the complex which hold caches of equipment. The boxes may be searched,
but are frequently booby trapped...

Succesfully finding the tunnel exit prompts the third chapter - the bunker.
Here the platoon find themselves in a foxhole at night with a group of VCs
after their blood. Firing flares into the air highlights the surrounding
terrain, and silhouettes the attaking querrillas, who are shot before they
manage to get a bead on your muzzle flashes and shoot back.

After the VCs are defeated, the platoon enters the final part, which is set
in the jungle. Following a radio message, the weary grunts find that the
area they're in is about to be napalmed by their own troops, giving them
just enough time to make it to safe ground. The soldiers have to run the
gauntlet of VCs, booby traps and barbed wire to reach safely. There are
several paths through the vegetation, some of which do not allow exit from
the area and thus prove fatal.

Finally, the remaining men, having made it to a supposed safe area, find the
only available foxhole taken by Sergeant Barnes - the officer whom they
blame for the death of their previous Sergeant. In an attempt to protect
himself from their wrath, Barnes opens fire on them. With the air strike
imminent, the platoon's only course of action is to grenade the hole and
kill Barnes. Once the foxhole has sustained five grenade hits, the platoon
may enter the foxhole to escape a fiery grave.
