You can load the game with certain features set the way you like just bytyping an argument after the lodaing command, BUDO:

The program automatically detects the best graphics mode for your computer -you're not required to enter an argument.  However, there are occasions whenyou'll want to change the graphics mode.  Maybe your computer is capable ofhandling EGA mode, but you'd rather view the game in CGA mode.
The program does not automatically detect the best sound driver (except forTandy).  If you want to listen to your Adlib card instead of your internal PCspeaker, you'll need to instruct your computer to use the Adlib card.  Youmust have the card installed to be able to use it.

These are the arguments you can use:

HERCULES               Runs game in Hercules mode.
CGA                    Runs game in CGA mode.
EGA                    Runs game in EGA mode.
VGA                    Runs game in VGA mode.
MCGA                   Runs game in MCGA mode.

CMS                    Plays music on the Creative Music Card (CMS Card)
ADLIB                  Plays music on the ADLIB Card
MT32                   Plays music on the Roland MT32 cards.

JOY1                   Player 1 uses Joystick #1
JOY2                   Player 2 uses Joystick #2

NOSHADOWS              The characters in Budokan cast shadows if the program                       thinks your computer is fast enough to display them.                       You can increase the game speed by removing them with                       this command.
SHADOWS                If shadows don't appear and you want them to, type this                       command.

Let's say you want to load the game with these features:  EGA graphics mode,music generated with the AdLib board (you must have an AdLib board installed),and no shadows.  You'd type:

BUDO EGA ADLIB NOSHADOWS

WELCOME, STUDENT

I am Tobiko-Sensei, a simple teacher.  This dojo exists to offer martial artstraining to those who seek it.  Do you come to the Tobiko-Ryu Dojo to studybujutsu, the art of battle, or budo, the path of life?  That is for you todecide, but be forewarned that either path will require rigorous training andabsolute dedication.  Empty your mind of preconceptions; they will only delayyour physical and spiritual advancement.  And also know that martial arts cannot bestow physical strength on one who is not also strong of spirit.

The Tobiko-Ryu Dojo offers training in four martial arts:  Karate, Kendo,Nunchaku, and Bo.  First you will jiyu-renshu; or practice your skills alone.Then you will kumite; or spar against instructors.  There is also a Free Sparmat where you can spar against students practicing other disciplines.

When you are ready, if you wish, you can travel to the world championshipmartial arts tournament at the Budokan.  There you must match your skillsagainst advanced students in many disciplines, and you will see weapons andtechniques that are not used in this dojo.  How well you preform against theseopponents depends entirely on your experience and dedication.

CONTROLLING THE GAME

Press ESC at any time to display the Game Configuration menu.  This menu letsyou specify how to control different parts of the game.  To choose an item,enter its number.  Press Esc again to return to Budokan.

INPUT DEVICES

Press 1 or 2 to specify how Players 1 and 2 will control the game.  You canchoose the keypad, the keyboard, or a joystick for your input device.  Foreach martial art, the game controls are shown on grids, and the actual controldepends on the input device you choose.  The following grids show the actualcommands, depending on the input device.

  Q  W  E      7  8  9
  A  S  D      4  5  6
  Z  X  C      1  2  3

Keyboard       Keypad

The Action button lets you make selections and perform certain moves.  For thedifferent input devices, the Action buttons are:

Keyboard               Left Shift key
Keypad                 Right Shift key
Joystick               Joystick button

If you select joystick control, a grid appears to help you center yourjoystick.  Press T to tune your joystick, and follow theprompts.  Press anykey when you are done to return to the Game Configuration menu.

Press:

3                      To toggle sound on and off
4                      To specify the way music will be created
5                      To return to DOS

TOBIKO-RYU DOJO -- THE TRAINING HALL

You stand in the main courtyard.  Surrounding you are the various traininghalls.

To begin your training, walk into one of the four dojos: * Karate, Kendo,Nunchaku, or Bo.  Use the eight directions of Player 1's input device to walkinto a dojo.

*  The dojos direction are listed here.  Make a note of this.

Tobiko-Sensei          Top of the screen
Bo                     Middle-right of the screen
Karate                 Lower-right of the screen
Nunchaku               Lower-left of the screen
Kendo                  Middle-left of the screen
Free Spar Mat          Top-left of the screen

In each dojo, you are given three choices:

Jiyu-renshu            Lets you practice alone
Kumite                 Lets you spar with an instructor
Leave Dojo             Returns you to the courtyard

Move the Yin Yang symbol up and down using Player 1's input device or thecursor keys, and press ENTER to make a selection.

At the start of each exercise, Tobiko-Sensei says hajimae (pronouncedha*gee*may), which means "begin" in Japanese.

JIYU-RENSHU

This is a time of practice and self-study where you fight an imaginary enemy.Practice each move again and again until you can perform any of them quicklyand precisely.  When you have memorized every move and can throw any strikeand parry any blow immediately, imagine yourself facing an opponent.  If hethrows a punch to your solar plexus, parry the blow with a mid-range block.If he spins to kick your forehead, drop to a crouch and kick his leg out fromunder him.

The Stamina Bar at the top of the screen tells you how tired you are and howwell you can perform.  For more information on this indicator, see the StaminaBar section.

When you are through practicing alone and want to spar with another student orleave the dojo, press B to bow and conclude the exercise.

KUMITE

This is an opportunity to spar with instructors of various degrees ofdifficulty.  You are given three choices:

Sankyu                 Easiest
Ikkyu                  More difficult
Shodan                 Most challenging

Move the Yin Yang symbol up and down using Player 1's input device or thecursor keys, and press ENTER to make a selection.

In addition to your Stamina Bar above you on the left, your sparring partneralso has a stamina bar.  For more information on this indicator, see theStamina Bar section.

Use your instructors wisely.  They are not there for you to simply fight ordefeat.  They are also there so you can practice combination moves, timing,and correct distance.  Do not think instructors reduce their attacks as yougrow weaker.  It is the quality of your technique, variety of moves, and howcomfortable you are with that knowledge that counts.  Remember, yourinstructors are your partners.

SCORING

Each time you strike your opponent, a number appears indicating the strengthof your strike; the higher the number, the more damage you inflicted.  And youreceive a bonus when you use a move for the first time.  When the match isover, you are shown your score, which is the total of all your strike points.

If you want to stop in the middle of a sparring match, press B to bow and exitthe match.

STAMINA BAR

The Stamina Bar indicates your current strength and endurance; the longer thebar, the more stamina you have.  Performing difficult moves or being struck byan opponent reduces your stamina.  Resting and successfully blocking blowsfrom your opponents lets your stamina increase.

Blocks prevent you from regaining stamina, so only block your opponent'sattacks as they come.  If you perform a block and hold it, your stamina willnot increase until you relax again.

The Stamina Bar is color-coded so you can approximate your status with aglance:

Green                  Full strength.  Your moves are quick.
Yellow                 60% stamina loss.  Your reactions are slow.  Avoid                       making high-energy attacks and try to block your                       opponent's strikes.
Red                    80% stamina loss.  You are very close to exhaustion.                       You cannot perform strenous attacks quickly.  Avoid                       most offensive moves and block your opponent's strikes                       until you regain strength.

KI BAR

Ki (pronounced "key") is the term describing the energy of the universe.  Itis the essential life force that flows through and around us.  Your ability toaccumulate and focus this energy and let it flow freely within you isessential to your understanding and growth.

The Ki Bar is a measure of how much ki you have; the longer the bar, the moreki you possess.  The longer you stay in a match without attacking, the more kiyou collect.  The more ki you focus when you attack, the more damage youinflict.

When you attack, you use half your ki for the blow.  If you strike youropponent, he loses half of his ki, too.  Similarly, if you are building up kiand get struck by your opponent, you will lose half of it from the blow.

If you are forced off the mat during the match, you lose half your ki.

PERFORMING THE MARTIAL ARTS

The grids on the following pages correspond to your input device.  The lineson the grids show the path the joystick must follow, or they connect the keysyou must press.  Wherever a circle appears, press your Action button.  A thickline indicates a path you follow while holding down the Action button.

For example:  The grid below shows you how to perform an attack in karatewhere you first crouch and then kick high.  Next to him is the movement gridshowing how to perform this move.

(My drawing might not be that good so just do what you can with it)

7  8  9         7  8   /
                      /
4  5  6         4  | /
                   |/
1  2  3         1  O  3

With a joystick:

1.  Pull the joystick down to crouch.
2.  Press the Action button and quickly move the joystick to the upper right    corner to kick.
3.  Release the Action button and return the joystick to the center.

With the keypad (keyboard commands are in parentheses):

1.  Press 2 (X) to crouch.
2.  Simultaneously press RIGHT-SHIFT (LEFT-SHIFT) and 9 (E) to kick.
3.  Release all buttons.

To smoothly perform each move, time your controls to the character's movementon the screen.  If you are using the keyboard, each keypress must quicklyfollow the previous keypress.  For instance, in the above example, if yourelease the 2 (X) key and wait too long before pressing the 9 (E) key, youwill stand back up and throw a high punch.  Until you learn to perform a movefluidly, do not release any keys until the move is completed, and you willlearn timing more quickly.

Though each martial art has many different moves, each motion is representedin an intuitive way.  To do high kicks, blows, or blocks, you use the top rowof keys on your keyboard or push the joystick up.  To do low kicks, blows, orblocks, use the bottom row of keys or pull the joystick down.

With practice, you will be able to perform each move quickly and smoothly.Jiyu-renshu to learn them well.  Only when they become second nature will yoube ready to take on human opponents.

(The diagrams for the moves are in a separate file which is named MOVES.DOC.It is for your convenience, since you will want to print them out.  Myapologies if you cannot understand them.)

FREE SPAR

Walk to the Free Spar mat to compete with a human or computer opponent.

Move the Yin Yang symbol with your input device or the cursor keys and pressEnter to make a selection.  sparring on the Free Spar mat is similar toKumite.  See "Kumite" in the Tobiko-Ryu Dojo -- The Training Hall section fora complete description of sparring.  Note, however, that your opponents on thesparring mat are not teachers, but students like yourself.  They will notreduce their attacks as you weaken.

TOBIKO-SENSEI

Walk into the building between the Free Spar mat and the pond to seek wisdomfrom Tobiko-Sensei.  Inside, you are given three choices:

Budokan                Select this when you are ready to travel to the                       Budokan.  Press the spacebar to begin the tournament.
Talk                   This seeks wisdom from your sensei.  Press the spacebar                       when you have duly noted his advice.  Do not pester the                       sensei, for he is a man of great patience, but not                       eternal patience.
Courtyard              Returns you to the dojo.

BUDOKAN

In the tournament, you are only allowed to use any one martial art a maximumof four times.  Under each martial art are dots indicating how many more timesyou can use that art.  To win the Budokan, you must use many arts, thus youmust plan each choice of art carefully depending on the martial art chosen byyour opponent.  Do not fight your easiest four opponents with your best art.

Engaging opponents in the Bodokan is similar to kumite (See "Kumite" in theTobiko-Ryu Dojo - The Training Hall section for a complete description),except you are often pitted against adversaries who practice martial arts nottaught in the Tobiko-Ryu Dojo.  Even if they practice an art that is taught inyour dojo, remember they were instructed in a different dojo, and they willhave different fighting styles and may perform attacks unfamiliar to you.

You are give three chances to defeat each opponent.  If you succeed, you meetthe next contestant.  If you fail three times, you are set back to yourprevious contestant.  (For example: If you last Match 5 three times, you aretaken back to Match 4.) If you run out of weapons to fight with - remember youcan only use each weapon four times - you are taken back to the Tobiko-RyuDojo.

MARTIAL ARTS RANKING

Every school has its own way of ranking.  Most commonly, a beginner wears thewhite belt.  As you grow more skilled in your art, the color graduallyprogresses to black.

Kyu Ranks (Mudansha) Undergraduates

Level    Rank
  6      Rokkyu
  5      Gokyu
  4      Yonkyu
  3      Sankyu
  2      Nikyu
  1      Ikkyu (Most advanced undergradute)

Dan Ranks (Yudansha) Black Belts

Level    Rank
  1      Shodan
  2      Nidan
  3      Sandan
  4      Yondan

Below are the diagrams that you will need to know to be able to block orattack during the game.

The execution of a move is pretty tricky, so don't be discouraged if your movedoesn't turn out like how you planned it.

And that concludes the diagrams that shows you how to block, strike, etc.  Ifyou are using the keyboard instead of the pad, just simply replace the numberswith the letters.  The equivalence of the keyboard to the keypad would be:

Q    W    E            1    2    3

A    S    D            4    5    6

Z    X    C            7    8    9
