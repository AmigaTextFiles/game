Hi there, 
 
I'm playing Frontier for some time now (status Competent, imperial range
Lord) and encountered a problem:
 
I got a mission where I have to photograph the Special Forces Base on
the surface of a planet (there are similar missions where you have to
photograph a research station etc.). The problem is that I cannot find
this base. I flew around the planet for some time, but there seems to
be no base at all, and I don't want to spend hours with boring flights
over planet surfaces.
 
Did anybody complete such a mission? How can I find the objects I have
to photograph?
 
Thanks
 
  Manfred

There are more responses available. Asking traders (generally by target on some

I think I have found a reproductible bug in frontier...

Try selecting the "Greliain" system [4,1] on the galactic map, and then try to
get info on it with the F6 icon... The system freezes and give me a GURU (GURU
#3 I think).

This is with the English version of frontier.

PS: Frontier might not be a "game", but it is definitely a masterpiece of
computer workmanship. It is *impressive*. It reminds me of starglider II: I
bought it, but did not complete it, but was very satisfied with my purchase
because after trying to play it and seeing that the plot was a bit repetitive,
I just played it for the "feel", trying to shepherd space whales off jupiter,
trying to get aestetically pleasing views... I think frontier is in the same
league.

PS2: Do somebody has the address of D.Braben? I understand that he wants to
create add-ons, and I want absolutly to confort him in this way. I even want to
financially contribute to it, Hey, he could start a "fan club" with say a $20
membership to support its programming efforts for the next years... (it worked
for MUI, a kind of shareware-like thing could work for frontier, too!)

PS3: when you get mission to kill somebody, do the victim always show up?
Sometime I had it show up at random time (for 10s to 30mn) late, and now I have
one that don't show up, but when I return to my contractants, they are pissed
off... Could the target be in advance? Have I a way to know?

It's absolutely true, I remember it well on the speccy version, a large thingy
 that when shot at launched loads of vipers and stuff at you.

Sorry, but I can't remember the name of the guy who wrote the thing:
Whoever you are, could you rewrite the patch, and take out that
bit about different versions.
I'd like to try it anyway, and see if it will work with whatever version
it is I've got.
(But obviously i'm too lazy to do it myself!)

Who is this pratt. Michel, did you forget to connect your brain when you
got up this morning!!!

There is a big difference between a game and a stupid demo playing back
frames of information to the screen. Are you insane or something. Do you
think that Frontier does no calculations behind the screen to maintain
the universe. Or do you think these calcualtions are very easily and take
no time at all. 

And for your information, Braben wrote the amiga version himself, the
PC version is ported from this by other people.

I don't know why I am bothering to reply to this, its obvious that you
are as thick as two VERY thick planks.

Yes, kind of an anti-climax. That big ship and that little boom.. :-(

Wow, thanks for that amazing piece of information. God, you are so
intelligent and we are so stupid. I bought a CD last week, and it
cost me 12.99. If I had waited a while (mayeb half a year) I could
have got it reduced in a sale. Boy, what a twat I am 8)

No, Frontier was developed on Amiga...
I think you're a bit confused here. Texture mapping has nothing to do with
the chipset. It is done with CPU, and can be done on any platform.
The problem is that texture mapping is much faster when you have the
graphics stored as chunky pixels, and Amiga uses planar graphics. You
either have to do the mapping in planar, which is SLOW, or render the
picture in chunky pixel, and then convert the pic into planar. With fast
Amigas the latter can be done in kind-of realtime, but it doesn't leave
much time for anything else.
So, it's texturemapping is not a problem. Doing it fast is.

Blah.  Actually, For a game with the hype of Privateer, It really don't seem

not much talk about it anymore, except for a few of the missions.

A lot of 'what.... that's it?' posts, too.

I think I found a new bug (why me?) in Frontier. Yesterday I landed my ship
on a planet without atmosphere and thus of course in an underground hangar.
I  visited this planet often before and I never had any trouble.  But now I
can't launch my ship anymore!  No matter how often I try and no matter if I
let  my  ship  undergo  a  deluxe  repair service, it won't launch from the
planet's surface.  The hangar ceiling opens and my engines turn on, but the
ship doesn't gain any altitude.

Has  anybody else experienced this?  If so, can the problem be overcome?  I
wouldn't  want  to  lose everything I gained in the game due to this stupid
bug.  Unfortunately I don't have another saved game...  :(((

It mentions it in the pamphlet (get started quick) guide

Asp Explorer or Constrictor. Perhaps the constrictor has the edge; with
a class 3 drive (preferrably military) you get 14ly, and it has great
acceleration/deceleration. My Constrictor is fully outfitted, with two
shield, 4MW beam, and so on. I've got 21 tonnes free for fuel, enabling
me to do two full-length jumps and still have some left for lengthy travel.

I tried out the bigger ones (the traders and clippers) and they were too
slow and unresponsive. Couldn't jump far, either.

Imp Courier SMALL??? It's a 480 tonne ship! The constrictor is much smaller
(and faster) but you'll still have room for more add-ons, since you use a
smaller drive.

 CD> Commander Smith, Imp Trader, 2.3Mc, above average

Commander Tarkin, Constrictor, 4Mc, above average (don't ask me how; I've
just traded animal skins and robots between Barnard and Ross 154 - I don't
think I've bumped off 100 ships all together. Can't seem to use the
autopilot for aiming, either; I invariably get shot to pieces if I try. I've
had ONE encounter with more than one ship; i met 8 eagles and 4 geckos at the
same time. Not too hard; they couldn't hit the broadside of a planet - from
the inside).

 CD> PS: you got to visit Lave, lots of pirates over there

Will do. The Barnard-Ross trade is getting boring.

Which is of course completely useless since it gets you there even LATER than
burning all your fuel in acceleration.  It's a military mission... there is a
time limit.  You want to get there quickly.  Not coast for a year and a half.

For the record I have also encountered this little problem and find it really
annoying.  Notice how MANY missions to Alpha Centauri there are?  Almost none
of them completable of course.

Well, I just got my own copy and it says somewhere in the file:
"Version to Gametek (Release 1) 1.00". Am I the only one which such a
low version number or do all people here in the US have this copy? I
got the game from Sideline Software, just today via UPS.

I haven't actually tried it out yet, but the single executable is
really impressive. :)

	Mind if I make a little suggestion... Frontier is not exclusivly
available on the Amiga, but it has been ported to the IBM, and the manual
also hinted at it becoming available on the Atari ST.

	In view of that, might I suggest a cross platform group, for

I think you all are jumping the gun, especially since Frontier hasn't
even come close to taking over this newsgroup.

Also, the entire concept of making a whole new newsgroup for just another
game that will be obsolete in a year or two I think stresses out the
internet infrastructure.  mho.  Unless it is already causing a mess without
the split, of course.

I squirreled away the frontier patch which supposedly lets you
quit the game without rebooting.

I purchased Frontier today (BitStorm, Canberra Centre Arcade,
$A69.95), and it's waycool.

I tried running the Frontierpatch,and it wouldn't 'execute' in
the normal sense of the word.

I then set the script bit on it, and it would say 'cannot open
redirection file'.

Snoopdos reports that Frontierpatch is trying to open a file, but
with no name.

I execute Frontierpatch with parameters, redirection and it just
doesn't work.

I have an A4000/40.
WSHELL 2.0 as my shell.
Amigados 3.0

Any clues? Oh, and looking for 'Version' in the executable
reveals I have V1.00 - the bug filled one. :-(

Keen game though:  as a local said, it is more like what Wing
Commander should have been.

Were those generation ships? They looked just like asteroids, and I was always told that the ships were just asteroid miners who were somewhat enraged by you shooting up their homes. It wasn't Vipers they launched, just pitiful Kraits and Sidewinders ... easily handled. The asteroids themselves weren't *that* tough, either...

Recently, Dino Dini suggested that he could pass on bug reports and suggestions
about Frontier to David Braben. Well, here is my little list:

SECTION A- BUGS!

1) The Bulletin Board Bug.
This has been reported before, so this is basically just a confirmation. Put
simply, the bulletin board will sometimes show about 4 stock market prices
instead of any messages. These are presented as articles, complete with buttons,
but these do nothing when clicked. Current theory suggests that if the last
bulletin board viewing before launch is the bottom of the board, thanb this bug
occurs. (guess.) The problem is easily fixed by fast-forwarding to the next day.

2) 'Attacks' INSIDE space stations.
This one can be quite nasty. Whilst docked at a station I purchased a Python,
intending to use it for passenger transporting as well as cargo. I had a Tiger
Trader at the time, and hence needed two more crew (see the SUGGESTIONS section).
One crew member was soon accquired, but another was not available. After
fast-forwarding for well over two months of game time, none had become available.
I decided to take on a passenger in the hope that this would free space on the
board for a JOB WANTED ad. My passsenger was wanted by some corp. or other. About
one game week later (still no crew) a ship turned up outside the station sending
the message "You'll regret dealing with x....". I ignored it, and went to fast
forward to next day. SHIP UNDER ATTACK!! I was unable to fast forward. Bugger.
OK, I thought, sell the ship and get a smaller one. "Cannot sell ship with
passengers on board." Double bugger. I was, as far as I can tell, irretrievably
stuck. NASTY.

3) Manual/ code mis-types.
There are several of these, but two spring to mind:
a) The Tiger Trader is listed in the manual as having 1 gun mounting. In the game
it has three. (This is probably a manual error- the gun turret works perfectly.)
b) The Imperial Trader is listed as having 6 crew, but in the game needs only
one. (this is definitely a mis-type in the code- the damn thing is a 700+
tonner!!)

4) Peculiar graphics bug.
I apologise for this one, because it is somewhat vague. However, with certain
ships, firing the front laser sometimes produces very odd on-screen effects- as
if the laser were being fired from the middle of the view window, or as if the
laser were being fired FROM the target AT the view window. On one occaison I even
had the smoke effect coming from the front of my Imp. Trader as I looked at it
firing from the outside view. As far as I can tell, the flashing orange beacon
outside some space stations seems to cause this if it is in the view window. (In
case it is useful, the worst occurence of this was at Shifnalport at Diso.
Despite the 'hit/damage' graphical effect, my ship took no damage. Also, in this
case the effect only occurred when my laser should have been hitting the
station...)

5) Missile velocity effects.
I dont know if this is truly a bug or not, but when firing missiles my ship (an
Imp. Trader) appears to be 'pulled' forwards slightly. The effect is most
noticeable when flying very slowly or stationary. I don't know if this is
intentional (the missile's engine firing just before it is released) or a bug
(the effect being supposed to be some kind of 'recoil', but happening backwards.)

Thats most of the bugs I can remeber right now =)
Some others have been posted, but I don't believe I have met any of them. NOW, on
to the :
           NOT REALLY BUGS BUT DAMN ANNOYING ANYWAY SECTION
            COMES FREE WITH HELPFUL(?) SUGGESTIONS!!

1) The complete inability of Vipers to launch without crashing into each other!
This is silly. If I shoot at a space station from behind, the vipers all launch
and either hit each other, or hit the station. Other aberrations include Vipers
crashing into the ground when I am flying in a sedate straight line.

2) The tendancy of computer pilots to ram.
Don't get me wrong, this is not always a bad thing. Many posters to this group
advocate ramming with a big ship as a good way to take out opponents, and I
really felt it when a Panther Clipper I was trying to assassinate decided to fly
through me! However, many small ships (especially those damn Vipers) insist on
ramming my Imperial Trader with 30 shield generators and an Energy Booster Unit.
Needless to say, they barely make a dent. I am NOT deliberately ramming them
either (I usually fight in engines off mode, only thrusting when badly hit.)

3) Crew. This is ridiculous, and EXTREMELY ANNOYING! Case in point. Go to Achenar
(Strictly Capitalist with NO SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS) or any other planet for that
matter, and you find it VERY HARD INDEED to get more than 1 Crew member at a
time. Here I am in my Tiger Trader. I see a Python (2 more crew). Do I dare buy
it? Chances are I'll spend the next game year or so waiting for crew- even in
systems with millions of people! The Imperial Trader mistype is a crippler in
this respect- I went all the way to Imperial space to get one, because it needed
6 crew. (T.Trader- 5 crew -> I.Trader- 6 crew -> Python- 7 crew, a nice
progression since one crewman is usually quite easy to get) Of course, when I
found this needed only 1 crewman, I was gutted (still bought the ship, because it
looks marvellous, but my chances of ever getting a clipper look lower than ever.)
A simple suggestion is to have a 'crew agency' or allow players to advertise for
crew on the bulletin board. Failing even that, allow 'spare' crew to be
accomodated in Extra Passenger Cabins until required.
 
4) Missiles. Apart from massive great ships and space stations, I have NEVER hit
a ship with a missile, even at point blank range (we are talking Naval Missiles
here!) The enemy ships seem to easily outdistance missiles.

5) Removing equipment. It is VERY ANNOYING to be unable to remove equipment which
a planet does not sell. At the very least, one should be able to have it simply
ripped out (no repayment for this though, obviously.)

That's it for now. Alien races, Generation ships, Space Dredgers, Destructible
Space Stations and suchlike would all be nice, but I feel most of these points
are more important. BTW, the explosion for the big ships like Lynx Bulk Carriers
and Light Cruisers are UTTERLY SILLY, and should be modified. (A screen white-out
followed by TONNES of Metal Alloys and cargo would seem to be a quite nice way
out- of course accompianied by an IMMENSE explosion noise!)

PPS (Sorry but this is such a good prog. that comments flow like water) It would
be INCREDIBLE to be able to fly the aforementioned immense ships. Just a thought.

Pah, lucky man. _I_'ve been killed with missiles a couple of times,
enough that I found the ECM system option to come in handy.

I think that some of the complaints we've seen about Frontier have
been people thinking that because (X) hasn't happened in the first
36 hours of gameplay, there is no (X) at all. It may be that we've
all gotten used to games you complete in under a week, watch the
cool ending animation, and then throw in a closet. Frontier, IMHO, is
different; not everything happens right away. For example, I thought
that the line about how there are other people and ships in the game,
going their own way, was exaggeration, until I tried to land at Sirocco
Station and was informed that all the pads were taken. Flew past
the airport and sure enough, there were two other ships parked on
the two pads. The downside of all this, of course, is that I had to
wait five days for one of them to finally leave...

Good bug list. Just two thinkg to add.

i) I have killed things with missiles, but have never been
	hit by a missile.

ii) On the A1200 there seems to be a keyboard reading problem
	where if i use 'z' and '<' or 'z' and '>' at the same
	time nothing happens. I realise this may be a keyboard
	fault though...

I think that about 1/3 of my NAVAL missiles hit their target. Rather good,
when you think of all the evasive manouvers and the ECM that your targets
use.. Just remember to fire your missile when you are close to your enemy,
because if they are far away they have plenty time to prepare evasive
manouvers.

I have also been hit by a missile (I think it was a missile, since
the bad guy's laserbeam was not pointed at me and my ship suddenly
exploded.)

If you have naval ECM, you are very unlikely to be hit by a missile. And if
you have many shield-generators you will hardly notice that you were hit.
(This goes for the missiles fired from small ships. I have not met anything
larger than a Imperial Courier yet, so missiles fired from larger ships may
have more impact if they hit)

Hi!

Frontier is a great game. But isn't the manual protection *REALLY* annoying?
It wouldn't be so bad if you were only asked for a word once per session.

Anyway, here's how to remove the protection. With this patch, pressing any
letter key will do. Of course, any altered copy you make should be for your
personal use only. David Braben deserves to be rewarded for his work.

Use a file editor such as 'Hex' to make the change.

Change the byte at offset $84EB4 from $67 to $60.

BTW: This is for version 1.00 of Frontier.

I know, people have mentioned this before, but the docking computer
kills me every time I want to dock somewhere. It seems to deliberatly
fly into the wall of the space station, just missing the entrance.

I am running this game on an 040 accelerated Amiga 500. Very fast
indeed. :)

The only solution to the above problem is to set time acceleration to
some higher value.  If I sit back and enjoy the full show at lower
speed, it will most certainly kill me.

I seem to have version 1.00 of Frontier.

I have also had problems with docking, but it seems to be avoidable if I
set the target on the station from the orbital-view screen. I'm running an

Bummer, huh? I usually dock at space stations manually myself, it's
reasonably easy to do.

Er, you've just pegged the solution to your problems... :)

The autopilot _cheats_, basically. If you're (say) landed at San Francisco
and you want to go to Moscow, on the other side of the planet, and activate
the autopilot, it will see that Moscow is ^7000 miles below you and eagerly
smash you into the ground. But if you peg the fastest accelerated time
value, you'll be in Moscow safe and sound in the blink of an eye.

This works for space stations _and_ ground bases. Peg the top accelerated
time setting while autopilot is on, and you'll be perfectly safe. Leave it
on a lower setting to watch how the autopilot does it, and you'll discover
that the autopilot _doesn't_ do it. This ought to get some attention
in the next version, no question, but in the meantime just use accelerated
time and you'll be fine. (While we're at it, how about airplane-style
autopilot on planets, so you can make cross-country flights? :) And
move New York back on land, too... :-o)

I once saw a demo named Cube-o-Matic which had a ligth sourced cube
with animated bitmaps on it's sides. It ran quite fast and was even
controllable with mouse so I doubt it was "cheating" in any
significant way. Hmm.. seems that the demo is still in nic.funet.fi:

/pub/amiga/demos/Spreadpoint/Spreadpoint.Cube-o-Matic.lha

The bitmaps "bend" a bit occasionally but I think this kind of texture
mapping would be quite acceptable for a game..

So Frontier is not what every one wants, But you have to admit that it is
bloody good as far as it goes.

Now for the question.

Does anyone know where to get hold of one of those mining rigs that are         mentioned in the manual. As I fancy having a go and have not been able          to find one anywhere.

May thanks ..... =|8^) .....

Yes, yes, yes, no (you are required to look up letters in the manual), and

the case for my v1.00 Frontier. My guess is that you'd get plenty of hits out

there's newer versions out)).

Lame? I've never ever seen 3-d vectors like those in Frontier before. If you
didn't like the gfx, you probably just dont like vector graphics - they don't
come any better than that. The colour cycling problem is far less noticeable
in the game than it was in the demo, but it's there.

The demo is identical to the game, just that there is higher detail

the game.

Funny you'd say that... KillingCloud did not work on my A3000 at all, and
WingCommander jerked unbelievably. Also, it was hard to fire the cannon
and/or steer the ship if one didn't turn off the sound (!) - not to mention
how blocky those enlarged soft-sprites looked. Frontier, on the other hand,
runs perfectly. All I have to remember is to turn off the screensaver. I'm
not saying there's no bugs in Frontier (there certainly are), but they
generally doesn't affect gameplay.

I'll try it out. I had a friend play Frontier yesterday, and he loved it.

There's no shortage of bugs in Frontier, atleast not in v1.00.

I'd pay, that's for sure. When I play Frontier, I sometimes get the feeling

I've had them show up and immediately jump out again. After jumping to their
projected target, turn around and stop. Target their 'arrival cloud', and wait.
If there is no arrival cloud, they probably misjumped.

Yet precalcutated brushmaps or even precalculated anims could be a way of
getting texturemapping to the ECS amigas, provided there's enough storage
available. You could then just blast the appropriate pic to the screen,
without worrying about calculating them. Many texturmapped games are
fairly repetitive (eg: the walls in Wolfenstein 3D), so precalculation
should be perfectly possible.

Hummm... Actually, come to think of it, I believe Wolf uses precalculated
texturemapping. What is gained in speed is lost in storagespace, I guess,
so perhaps it's not much use for ECS amigas.

Yep. ROT was even too fast on my A3000.

I am somewhat disappointed, even though the game looks quite nice.  I
received my copy from Sideline Software ($36) yesterday and it turned
out to be release 1.00.  I have played very little so far, but the
number of bugs popping up is amazing.  For one the docking computer
works only when set at accelerated time (otherwise it kills me).  Also
I have encountered crashes right after running out of fuel and during
combat.

Could a kind person please email me the english non-cracked version
1.02 (which I believe is the most recent version out there)?  I know,
this isn't all too legal, but I don't want to wait for another 6 weeks
to get a replacement copy from GameTEK (they need 4 weeks to deliver,
plus another 2 weeks shipping to the UK).  In a way I feel cheated by
them, how can they send me such a buggy version?

If you want proof that I have my own copy, just ask me questions from
the manual. BTW, my mail server can only handle packages up to 100K,
therefore the uuencoded file should be divided into several ~90K
mailings.

Thanks in advance,

Stefan

Just another little Frontier Bug.

I had a Boa and equiped it with top and bottom turret lasers.
It was very nice when using these, flipping between one and the
other giving an all round view - unfortunately, shooting through
the bottom one just hit my own shield/hull rendering the thing
useless - plus the ship handles like an elephant.

A couple of other things...

What's the most number of ships anyone's been
attacked by at once?

I went to reidquat (the famous anarchy planet near lave) and
had about 20 (!) ships lay into me at the same time - laser fire
everywhere - it was great fun!
Took about 8 of them down before going down in flames myself :)

Also, PC and Amiga save game files don't seem to be compatible
(I tried out of interest) - I wonder why not?

I was suitably impressed enough with the demo of this game to consider
buying it. From reading some of the posts on here, I see that you get sent
out on missions and stuff. How much depth, as opposed to detail, does this
game have? Is there a plot? A purpose? A conclusion? Or do you just go
around shooing from system to system aimlessly forever and ever? I'm
asking this because I have heard some disappointment with the game in
terms of it's depth.
Thanks in advance!

	OK so you are basically roaming the universe "aimlessly" for
	ever and ever but thats not the point of the game. Frontier
	has plenty of depth. And in more ways that one. The depth of the
	universe to explore is immense. There are basically 3 ways of
	playing. Become a space pirate , trader or a pilot for
	passangers. If you get sick of one "way of life" you could try
	another.  

	Come on , if this game lacks depth then i'd like to know what
	other users define a game with plenty of depth as?
	
	Buy the game!

An expensive alternative would be to buy an escape pod, launch, eject
the pod and fly back to the station and buy a new ship.

After playing extensivly over the weekend, I've noticed that after inputting
the letter a few times, the police don't request it much again, though it
seems every time you reload a saved game you need to resatisfy the police
for a while anyway.

yep, but if tyou transport a pass3enger he will be pised off for waiting more
than a month. To get there quick, autopilot to aim the destination, then manual
control, and accelerate as much as you can. Then at about 50 AU, swicth to
autopilot, and more importantly, get on maximum acclerated time, you will land
nicely (if not accelerated you will miss the planet as you cnnot decelerate so
eaily). It uses fuel, though.

white dots? are they all the ships present in the system? only the biggests?

I have found this bug too- it is irritating, and I have no idea what causes it
(Time for Dino to give Braben another bell, methinks...). However, there does
seem to be a solution- after you have tried to lift off, hit the maximum time
acceleration button. For some reason you will end up in the very outer
atmosphere, with a warning about the undercart. Hope this helps.

I believe that the checks occur at greater intervals each time.  I
think it takes twice as long for the next check to come along, and
if you get it right, it will take twice as long again.  I haven't
been checked up on for quite a while, and I've had two reloads
since the last check.  I suppose after a while the check get so few
and far between that you will hardly notice them.

Some hope here for all of us having trouble getting crew- how did you manage to
get enough crew for a Boa? I have a Tiger Trader, and I CANNOT find anywhere
which sells are larger ship + the crew to fly it! (except the imperial trader&
courier, and thats no good when you want to work up to a panther clipper!!). I
hope I soon encounter lots of ships (I've had a couple occaisonally). Anyway,
main question is- HOW DID YOU GET YOUR CREW!!??

On the saved game front, one difference could be the hull texture-maps. Since
each ship has its own associated texture-map, what this is is probably recorded
in the file somewhere, hence the formats are slightly differen1. Perhaps our
code-examining friends can come up with a conversion prog to port saved games,
hmmm?

This is what I did in the end - I tried everything I could think of to get rid 
of them but to no avail.  I have since read the stories booklet and there is a
story about a spy who stows away on ships that looks uncannily familiar...

Here's a problem i got last night.

After deciding to sell my Eagle, and move on up to something more powerful and capable of bigger hyperspace jumps. So I had a look at the Viper et al. It stated that with the Class2 Hyperdrive I should get around 12 ly (dont quote me) BUT when i went to the map to set my course it would only allow 8 ly!!

It was the same for all craft. Is this a bug, OR am I doing something really stupid??

Garry

ps. (joke for UK, Newman & Badiel fans)
    See that autopilot in Frontier??

    Yes, I am aware of it!!

    Thats your best autopilot ever, that is!!!

Not a bug.

Try refueling.  Works wonders when you want to go somewhere.  If you coast
into a port on autopilot when your fuel has run out (risky but it can be done)
then your internal fuel tank is empty... even if you buy more fuel and have an
auto refueler it doesn't check so the tank stays empty.  Just go through the
status screens to your cargo list and click the 'refuel' gadget.  Problem
solved.

Not a bug.

Haven't you noticed that the maps are adjustable?

I'm not talking zooming in and out here... that's basic, but if you hold down
the right mouse button and move the mouse you change the orientation of the
system... so just adjust things so that Pluto is head on right towards you and
then zoom in until you can select it.


Your third item does sound like a genuine bonified insect though.  Not really
TOO much of a problem since it only involves money and there are legitimate
ways to make even more (I once had 3Mc PROFIT from a single cargo run... after
that I retired my Panther Clipper and switched to an Imperial Courier)

Yes, it seems to happen quite often when visiting pressurized spaceports.
I found that a way to break free is to 'go through the motions' exactly as
if you HAD taken off (up gear, increase throttle, pull up nose) even though
nothing seems to happen on the screen. This usually results in the ship
taking off normally. Others has suggested using accelerated time.

Yes, as near as I can tell there is a series of circles around your current
location at which you can jump as if it WERE your current location.  This may
be related to the way the multiple galaxies are all mirror images of each other
in a grid pattern.  The circles around your location occur at intervals of
something like 50 sectors or a little higher.  Once you find one you can trace
it left and right until it starts to curve around to the top or bottom.  You
can jump to the edge of the galaxy this way... now if only there were something
out there worth seeing.

But the point still stands that you'll almost all be bored of
Frontier in a few months...just create an alt group, for christ's sake,
or stick with comp.sys.amiga.games. There's REALLY NO USE in creating
it for ONE game unless it remains ETERNALLY popular.

Why not just apply to set up the newsgroup. Then if the majority of people
think the newsgroup is a good idea, it will be set up, if most people decide
that it will only last a couple of months and then die out, then it will be
voted down.

...and if there was such a newsgroup, 50% of the posts would be "help!

Fortunately that is not possible in Elite I, since enemy ships do not
come as a single block. You have them arranged in a star configuration
like this:

   *     *
      *
   *     *

In the initial phase your three rear and side lasers are useless, so
you have to aim quickly and destroy as many as possible before they
start separating. If none of them are tough ships you can generally
do that, but only one Thargoid and this approach won't work anymore. By
the time the Thargoid is destroyed, the laser as approach maximum heat
and the others have started to separate. So you do end up having to
actually chase them, but as I already mentioned, that is practically
always a very simple process and damage is minimal if at all.

Unless you had a different version of Elite I must say that you must
have either a rotten memory or didn't really mean what you said. It is
not possible timewise to destroy them all in this initial phase if
there is a Thargoid or a Wolf under them, no matter how good you are
and even with Military laser. And once they have left their initial
configuration, you cannot simply "wobble". You must actually move more
than a few degrees and in tough combats you might even need to chase a
few.

I don't think I am too rotten at Elite I. A standard combat starts out
with a quick location of the enemy configuration and from then on my
finger doesn't leave the fire button anymore. It takes me a fraction
of a second to relocate the laser beam on the next ship once a ship
explodes. So I reach maximum efficiency. Still, there are combinations
of enemy ships where my laser overheats and I start getting into enemy
fire. At that point you _must_ change your current flight of path
otherwise you'll be dead meat quickly.

Though I agree, that Elite I combats did not increase in difficulty as
quickly as your increase in aiming efficiency.  But at least a combat
in Elite I was a combat.  In Frontier a combat with the right ship is
not even a combat anymore. Most of the time enemy ships just run into
me and I don't even get a good aim at them. Ship damage is minimal
(20% on shields maybe).

I guess Frontier expects you to adjust the difficulty level on your
own. That means, if you want to get into tough fights, then you should
degrade your ship protection and weapon capabilities until you think
it is difficult enough. I personally don't like it this way, it takes
out some of the challenge.

Maybe you should play in a different way. I'm still trying to upgrade
that Eagle fighter you get in the beginning and I've been playing a little
over one year of game time. It's actually quite a challenge surviving
in the Empire "airspace" with only 1MW Pulse Laser (Can you imagine
the pleasure of _finally_ blasting an Imperial Trader with 1MW Pulse
Laser :-). The game's bound to lose some interest, if you go on and make
a quick buck and buy the deadliest ship ever to be seen in the galaxy.

From Michel Brown...

....demo still sputters and spits..doesn't run properly....

I would think that something in your machine environment is stopping the
demo working. I have had no trouble with crashes. Certainly does not need
a stack size greater than 65K.

As for the game, if you are a space enthusiast, get it. Regardless of the game
component, the space simulation is an educational feast. Accurate rendering
of planet sizes, distances, orbits, declinations, gravitational attraction
(have fun putting your space-ship in geo-synchronous orbit. Take a trip to
Pluto, yes you can find it on the system map with careful zooming. An odd bug
in V1.00 stops you landing on Pluto, but you can land on Charon and watch
Pluto <apparently> revolving around Charon every 7 days). 

The best tool yet for teaching kids about the solar system (and lots of other
systems). They can get really involved. Distant Suns is first-class in an
abstract way and, of course, very accurate, but there's nothing like piloting
your own space-ship across the galaxy. Frontier gives kids that 'experience'.

I congratulate David Braben on a marvellous achievement. The 'avid games
players' have fired lots of criticism about the depth of game-play etc. Some
is definitely justified, some distinctly over the top. However, these people
are narrowly focussed on the 'gaming experience' (after all, they paid
good money for it) 
and have chosen to miss a  wonderful educational dimension. Frontier is more
an 'experience' than a 'game'. 

On the game-play and 'silly' bugs, I am sure that David will capture the
good suggestions and offer the user-community some update mechanism. He is
obviously very interested in something to which he has given 5 years of
dedicated work and is justifiable proud of it.

I tried 50k, 100k, 1000k, and 10,000k! All I get is a flashing, strobing,
flicker that gives me a headache to look at! I would like to believe that
Mr. Braben would put his best foot forward, and produce something which
shows off the best aspects of his labors. From my pov, that would be
wasted $$$, IMHO

That'd be nice, 'cept if the program does'nt work properly, then what do
you do? Pretty pointless to buy a product that misbehaves so badly, don't
you think? Maybe this is system dependant, and since I'm setting up a 3D
rendering engine, I'll be hard pressed to change it for one game that
does'nt play by the rules :-/

Encrypted? Hmm. That sounds like a challenge.
Who is going to be the first to put a savegame-editor on Aminet?

	Yeah, you can swap the bytes of words and long words around,
except you don't know which bits of the file are words/long words or bytes.

	To make it work, the programmers who wrote them would have had to
define a standard byte ordering, and mucked around a bit; not much work
but probably not worth the effort.

Actually on my A1200 elite runs fine with no alterations to the startup,
I have a standard A1200 with extenal DD and version 1.00 elite, the game
is just one large file, and the startup-sequence set's stack to 65600 and just
runs the file, I've had no problems, It even starts up the ramdisk which is
dead handy for those multiple saves ;-)

Asp Explorer is the ship I use now, but it lacks space for decent shields..
(BTW - I have finally encountered an enemy better equiped than me!
 Needless to say, I blew him to Valhall.)

I've noticed many things said about Frontier that under closer examination
turn out to be untrue;

Myth #1:  Sometimes when you try to launch you don't go anywhere.  This is a
bug and the only way to solve it is to use time acceleration.

Truth:  No, this is rather basic oversight.  The way to solve it is to refuel
your internal tank.  Buying the fuel is not sufficient.  If your tank is empty
you have to go to the f3 cargo screen and click the refuel gadget.

Myth #2:  You never run into more than one enemy at a time.

Truth:  Under max time compression enemies get yanked up close to you to
prevent you zipping past their 'window of oppurtunity' at high speed.  This
causes them to appear one at a time as they get in range.  Moving at a lesser
time compression will cause them to approach normally... and results in packs
of enemy ships.

Myth #3:  It is impossible to dock without the autopilot.

Truth:  Hogwash.  On the four or five occaisions when my autopilot got knocked
out by combat or lack of servicing I still managed to dock just fine manually.
It takes longer and requires fine control, but I've never FAILED to do so...
even when all my maneuvering jets were damaged... space stations, underground
bunkers, and flat landings are all possible.  Only thing I can think of is that
the people who haven't been able to do it are forgetting to put down the
landing gear.

Myth #4:  Once you get up in the game combat is so easy that you can't lose.

Truth:  I had an imperial courier with 20 shield generators taken out by a
single foe in about one second.  I never even saw him as more than a blip on
the scanner.  One of the giant ships like a panther could probably have taken
that... but what about two or three of them?  Besides which... the panther is
hard to destroy because of it's size, but it's just not workable for time
constraints on missions.


Future myth updates as they occur to me.  For the record the bit about no
aliens seems to be true... though I hold out hope for the systems of "Special
Scientific Interest."

Sorry but that's wrong.
I was in the same situation and refueling didn't help at all.
I solved the problem by driving through one of the base walls and
start outside:-B

I always use time compression...otherwise it would take too long.
It's probably more realistic but it's not good for the gameplay.

I use a panther and there's no ship(s) yet that could cause some serious
damage. I also don't need an autopilot in a battle.

>Future myth updates as they occur to me.  For the record the bit about no

It's still a superb game but it could be *THE GAME*.
The gfx engine is rather good..i have no real complains here.
Perhaps a texture detail mode but that's not that important.
The little program bugs are also not that serious and could
be fixed quite easy.
But my serious complains are:

1) Combat gameplay isn't good..too easy
2) I want to explore systems and find things/weapons i can use
3) No really personal missions
4) Ship/Equipment isn't optimal...there is no real optimal ship
   configuration.
5) I would like to see alien races...where are my lovely thargoids.
6) I would like to see big battles between the imperium&federation.
7) I would like to see unusual system...black holes,neutron-stars,
   size changing stars,novas....something like a trap system:-B
8) I don't think the fuel/motor system isn't well designed
9) I miss defects in the hyperraum


Frontier looks like it has to be released because of some reasons
be can only think about....it miss some polishing

Regards

(Still playing)

It is playable on a 68000.  But an accelorator definitly
helps!

Hi,
	Has anyone tried to run Frontier on an A600 yet? If so whats the
frame rate like? I ran the demo and found the speed acceptable on that but
I'm not sure if this means the game will still run at a good speed. I really
want to get this game (to remind me of playing Elite on old Acorn machines,
the only true way to play it) , but I don't want it if I'm about to be
lumbered with something slower than your average Skoda.

Thanks,

Mal(mjt@dcs.warwick.ac.uk)

Has anybody ever wondered why there is the real time in Frontier ?
Is it just so that you can take a look how long it takes for earth
to do circle around sol or could there possibly be some events 
coming later in the game ( for example a war starting between feds and
empire in year 3210 ) ?

The manual says something about larger military drives being under developement
maybe there will be military drive 4  some day.
Anyone played long enough ? I am only in the year 3202

HOT TIP for Frontier Elite II

To make millions within one week of trading do the following :

1. Trade between Barnards Star and the Sol system with computers, robots and 
   Luxury goods.
   When you have ammassed enough money by a bigger ship (Asp, Viper etc.).

2. Next goto the Sol system and upgrade your ship to have one - three extra
   passenger cabins.

3. Goto the bulletin board and take on passengers to a system you can get to
   safley. SAVE THE GAME !!!

4. Sell your ship in the shipyard with the passengers on board, notice the
   computer warns you that you cannot sell a ship whilst you have passengers
   on board BUT the computer still refunds you the difference on the ship.
   For example a Panther is worth @ 2,350,000.00 Credits if you take on board 
   passengers and try to trade the ship in for a lifter you will be refunded
   550,000.00 Credits !!!!. This is a major flaw in Frontier as it has allowed
   me to have a Panther Clipper, with 96 shields a small plasma accelerator and
   loads of other goodies for free ! and at the same time I have 35,000,000 CR.

5. After you have got this far donate 5,000,000 CR to a charity, (watch your#
   reputation grow !)

6. Take off and blow the space station to pieces your now practically 
   invunrable.


Thats all for now, if anyone is interested in more cheats or if any one has 
any then mail me on zgp@oasis.icl.co.uk

IMHO, the gameplay of Frontier is not being the Big Guy of the Galaxy.

Hello! Here's version 1.1 of my patch.. This is a bit different from the 
previous version. 

First of all, this works with all versions of Frontier, not just the 1.00..

Also, with this patch you exit the game by pressing X in intro sequence, or
in the 'select start position' menu. This way you don't have to crash your
ship if you want to return to intro, since the exit gadget works as usual.. :)

I was pondering this same question, trying to figure out how difficult
it would be to get to Beta Lyrae, the contact binary star (unexplored,
about 980 or so light years from the Core Systems.) The thing is, if it
takes you more than a year to get there, your drive _is_ going to
fail from lack of servicing! (Don't laugh... this does happen... and
it's embarrassing, not to mention terminal, to see your Class 2 Hyperdrive
replaced with 25 tons of rubbish.)

So traveling out there would require extensive planning, it seems. You'd
need a ship with large cargo capacity, to hold fuel scoop and drive, the
best drive on the market to go over 20 LY in one jump, study the map
to find the most distant frontier system in the direction you're going,
and get the ship serviced there. It should _just_ be possible to make it to
Beta Lyrae; it's in my long-term plans, anyway. And no, I refuse to cheat.

I've noticed that... sometimes you can get a mission to deliver something
to a star system with no settlements. Bizarre. Along the same vein, you
can scroll around the galactic map, find a binary star system with NO
planets, and see it described as "Some mining and ore refinement." Heh.
One wonders where the miners live... of course, perhaps they're in a
little station orbiting a star, mining hydrogen. :) It seems that the
"decide-what-this-system-is-like" routine just checks if there's more
than one body in the system, not if the second body is habitable (or
even a solid planet, as opposed to gas giant or star.)

>Still a great game, no matter what anyone says.....

Amen, brother! The bugs are very annoying, but as far as what the game

There is something out there!!!
I was trying to scroll over to another galaxy, after wedging a penny in my shift
and right arrow keys.
After finding out it is simply the same galaxy :( I left it to start scrolling
back to 0,0.
I just glanced at the bottom, and suddenly it said:
Frontier System....

Shit, I scrolled it back, and there it was.
I think it was at -4096,0.
And the name began with a C.
I had a good scroll about and found about 5 others too.
No major starports, but one had an orbital city.
Now all I need it a drive capable of jumping ~200,000 light years. :(

Btw does anyone know which ships can take a fuel scoop.?
My imp courier cant anyway, and I so want to try sun skimming for fuel...

And another point.
Last night I got an imperial mission to deliver data cards to a system.
It was right next door to the imp capital.
But it had no starports or stations, but it said it had mining operations.
I took the mission, but on rough (yes I actually managed it!!) landing, nothing
happened.
How are you supposed to complete the mission?
I still have the cards, although the time limit has long since expired.
I tried contacting every planet, no luck!
Two pirates did attack me on entry though!.

Still a great game, no matter what anyone says.....

If I buy a big ship that requires like 12 crew members to launch, how in
the hell do I launch if I've just boughten it?  I can probably get about
2 people from the bulletin board, and to get more, I'd have to fly to
other stations, but I can't with only 2 people on board.  How do I go
about doing this?

WAIT AGES!
Its that simple, new people will appear on your bbs.
Giving shitty wages doesnt help, give decent wages and more will ask you
for a job.
Donate to charity will also increase people who contact you.
BTW, I saw a poor bastard on a bbs, so I fired my crew member at 20c and when
I went back to the bbs, he and everyone else offering skills had buggered
off.
Not that I need crew anymore with my imp courier.

The only way I have found is to use maxmimum time compression.  You might have
to wait a long time though (maybe weeks).  Someone else suggested that
donating to charity might tempt more people to work for you...

Also, make sure you buy your ship from a fairly busy starport--more people
are likely to be looking for work then.

Weeks?? Make that months. Especially if you are at a small star-port.

Offering good wages to the people you hire also increase the number of
people wanting to work for you.

Anyway - luckily I don't need any crew for my Imp. Courier, and can happily
jump around in the galaxy not having to worry about crew.. :-))
Imperial Sir, Federal Private, and elite Average. With enough money to
jump around having fun for a loong time..

	I have found 3 star systems more than 5000 light years away
that have SETTLEMENTS!


	One is something like -720,-6, and the other two are near
1022,-4. One has two orbiting stations. I have yet to actually reach
one of these stations though due to fuel problems. I am looking for 
a ship large enough to carry tons of fuel to make it there. I have
come close to getting to one of them though.

	I have the names of the star systems and their exact locations
at home.

	Good luck finding them! The race is on!

I've seen lots of complaints recently from people who are getting either
bored with combat in frontier, or narced off about being killed so
quickly. My humble opinion is that offensive weapons are too powerful
relative to defensive (ie shields and hulls). As a case in point I got
shot to bits last night in about 3 seconds flat (Tiger Trader, 20
shields). What got me was that it was all too fast, to begin with I
couldn't see my enemy because the dratted 'ship under attack' message
covered my scanner, and then I couldn't see because my viewscreen was
covered with junk from the enemy lasers. OK you may be saying, so what?
Well, I think that you could put some of the challenge and skill back into
combat (like there was in Elite) by *reducing* the destructive power of all
lasers (yours and enemy) by a factor of 2 or 3. Combats would last longer,
and have more scope for piloting skill, use of missiles etc. The other
advantage of this is that it's (presumably) a fairly easy change to make
to the program. Anyone out there who works out how to do it could post say
the debug commands (for the pc) that make the change, and then everyone
could do it. Anyone game for a spot of hacking?


		Robin.
		swrglovr@uk.ac.reading

PS. (i) I know that some people are going to say that combat in elite was
no challenge, but that all depends on whether you hacked your lasers to
be mining lasers that fire as fast as beams, doesn't it?

    (ii) For those who are going to start shouting about PC frontier being
compressed and therefore you cant just use debug to change things, all you
need to do is UNLZEXE all the files. You can even still run it once you've
done this.

Have you tried to take out an Imperial Courier with a 1MW Pulse laser?

Well I managed it last night (yahh!) took about 30 hits, as one hit
only did, approx, 3pts of hull damage.

The thing I noticed was that flying around in an Eagle means that one 
shot from nearly any laser means you are toast. So the answer seems to
be, just keep moving :)

I have found yet another bug in Frontier.

Once you come out of hyperspace and analyse your own hyperspace
cloud with a hyperspace cloud thingy then the whole system crashes
and you get a guru meditation.

This is not a bug. Your hyperspace cloud analyser uses Karl Blaze's (2733 -
2891) matter/anti-matter calculation theorems(1). Basically Blaze
discovered that anti-matter is really not such a big deal, and is actually
formed by inverted blueprints from the original sub-atomic structures.
Anti-matter can not react with matter to which it has no relation, i.e.
matter and anti-matter have a strictly uniform relation on a sub-atomic
level. The hyperspace cloud analyzer analyzes the anti-matter in the cloud
(especially military drives produce *lots* of anti-matter - for no apparent
reason), derives the original atomic structure from which the anti-matter
originated, and recalculates the original form, history and sexual
orientation of the ship that has just gone through. 
  The problem is that if anti-matter taken from your *own* ship through
your *own* hyperspace cloud contacts corresponding matter in your analyzer,
a lot of energy gets free (the amount of energy can be calculated by
Monger's formula (2)(3)). The energy produced is not as much as 20th
century scientists believed it would be, but still enough to score the
critical conversion in the classic Superbowl game between the London Lamers
and the Martian Molesters, when both teams played _home_. Or (what seemed
to have happened in your case) still enough energy to guru your Amiga (and
destroy your ship, but you can't see that happen because of the crash,
right?). It is adviced never to look into your own hyperspace cloud. And
don't try to reproduce this *feature*: After five reactions there's enough
anti-matter in your amiga to start a global disaster!

Can anybody enlighten myself (and the numerous other posters who have 
requested this advice) on how to successfully fulfill a contract? I have 
waited for months for my target's ship to appear at the specified location and 
have had absolutely no luck in locating them. I can understand if, on 
occasion, they change their plans and you may need to hunt for them, but every 
time it gets quite frustrating.

I would love to hear from anybody who has succeeded in fulfilling their 
contracts!

Thanks,
Graham

I accepted a contract to "demote" someone on the food chain.
(Or put the candidate on their proper level on the chain...).
This was accepted at Facece, target was to be a Vequess.  I
managed the jump, and waited around the station on accelerated
time.  Nothing.  I restored the save file and accelerated up
to a few minutes before the mission time and went on normal
play time.  At a few seconds after the specified time the
ship showed up (and I missed him).  After a few tries I
blasted the guy.  A missile launch is usually good to keep
the target from hyperspacing on you.

I then went on to the old elite system and accepted a contract
for Zaonce.  Went to Zaonce and waited and no show.  I also
found that you get in big trouble firing a weapon too close
to the station.  Of course, if I don't get the target right
away, my snail of an imp courier is not capable of catching
anything (even the boa freighter that I was supposed to kill).

Anyone have any good tips on how to complete your kill (especially
in the "old" elite system?

Surely this make combat a non event and removes part of the game play, there
seem to be a lot of people complaining about a lack of game play and then
revealing that they have a large ship, 20MW laser and 10+ Shields.

I remember playing the original Elite (BBC micro) and finding that although
combat was difficult to start with practice you became better at it.

I am currently flying a Gecko (yes a Gecko, I had a Viper but it didn't give
me the range I wanted. ) with 1MW beam laser, 1 or 2 Shield Generators (I buy
the second when I am carrying out a hit), and no scanner! I guess I am what
the manual is on about. Seriously though with names on you can find the enemy
and once you target them you can keep track of where they are. So on a small
ship the scanner is a waste of a (valuable) ton IMHO.

Hello everyone!

I'm an amiga user with a plain A500 (1Mb RAM though..). I am thinking of
upgrading to an A1200 before Xmas (a present for myself :) ), but I have
a problem regarding Frontier. There was this rumor about an AGA version,
confirm any1? Now, if there ever _will_ be an AGA version I'd prefer to 
wait for it... 

I had an opportunity to try Frontier at my friend's place. I hate to say,
but it does not only have bugs, they're crawling all over it! The most 
annoying thing was when he (friend) bought a brand new Boa cruiser and
could not use the bottom turret for anything else than shooting at his
own ship :( Then, of course, that's fair play considering what the pirates
have managed to put against him so far...

This is getting a bit long, but I'll have one more question... In case I buy
Frontier in all of it's bug-ridden glory, are there any patches to fix the most
annoying bugs? If so, where? Some1, pleeze...

	I have docked in a star system over 6,000 light years away
from Sol! It was very easy to do and took me about 6 or 7 hypespace
jumps, each of about 10 light years. I loaded my 2000t ton ship
with 1,400 tons of fuel since most jumps require between 10t and
70t of fuel with the 8 hyperdrive.

	I visited a stations called Schneiderport near a plant called
Gold in a star system at 1021,-4 (I think). I think it may have been
called Ururio (the star system that is).

	There is nothing unusual or abnormal about this star system
that would make me want to go there ever again. There is another
system at 1022,-4 I think that also has a port. Ururio has 4 ports
I think.


	Also, when you zoom out of the galaxy, and start seeing another
galaxy creep up on either side, the fact is there are even more galaxies out
there on that map. I have counted 40 galaxies so far, in a perfect 
grid pattern. In my attempt to cross over to another galaxy using the
Worm Hole bug, my system crashed due to Nag.030, but I will make
another attempt (thanks to a stapler and a Supra power supply).


	Do not waste your time going to these star systems in our
galaxy... they do not appear to be exciting. I will check these other
galaxies just to see if they are different. Apparantly the Frontier
executable shows no signs of a Galactic drive or alien races, but maybe
these will be mission disks...

Seems to me that sometimes the target gets wind of the impending
assassination attempt, and decides not to show up at the  appointed
time. I think this is a feature (it's realistic, anyway.)

I've  been pleasantly surprised by how intelligent your assassination
targets behave. One time, I pursued a guy  through hyperspace and
then dozens of AU across another  system, punching through some pirates
along the way who tried to slow me down, and finally matching velocities
and beginning the attack... he zorched me with an Energy Bomb. :) Ouch.
It's probably a good idea to either abort the kill if you find your
target has an Energy Bomb -- either that, or have a tough enough ship
that you can withstand its effects.

Today I was going after the President of Core  Ind. Corp as he left
Matthews (an underground  base in the Ross 128 system.) I pursued his
ship, managed to get above it... and he promptly headed downwards and
landed in Matthews again! Once inside the base, of course, he was
protected from any efforts I made to attack him. Pretty clever.

There are two ways to deal with this problem;

1:  The best way is to prevent it from happening.  Quite simple really... what
is happening is that the game keeps track of the 'mission number' you are
currently on (and displays that one and the next three).  Unfortunatly if you
go to the bottom of the list (say mission #22) and then fly to a port without
many missions (say 15) you are now at a mission that does not exist.  The
solution should be obvious... always go to the first mission on the list before
leaving a port.

2:  If you forgot to go to the top of the list at your last port all is not
lost.  The game resets the missions every day, and thus also resets you to the
first mission on the list.  Simply hit accelerated time until the next day
comes and you will have a mission list... but you've lost a day.

...or remember to go to the top of the previous roster, you browsed through.
The bug seems to appear each time you have browsed through a mission roster
list that is very long and have left it at the bottom. Then when you reach
a roster that is much shorter in another system or in another terminal, it
screws up.

In Frontier, kills make points and points determine you "Elite
ranking". It states in the manual that more points are awarded for
shooting up a heavily armed ship than a lightly armed one, however
what I'd like to know is:

  (1) How many points does one get for each type of ship?

  (2) Does the number of points vary according to the equipment
installed on the ENEMY ship (i.e. if it has 12 sheilds, do you get
more points)?

  (3) Does the number of points vary accorind to the equipment
installed on _YOUR_ ship (i.e. if I kill an Imperial Courier with
a 1MW Pulse Laser do I get more points than if I use a 20MW beam)?

  (4) Are points awarded for other deeds (transporting passengers,
military missions etc.)?

  (5) How many points do you need to progress to each level of
rank?

  (6) Is there anyway to determine the current number of points?

Thanks,

If I get any definitive answers by EMail I'll sumarise and post.

I like the idea of this, but why limit it to Amiga? Why not a group
comp.sys.games.elite ? I mean the game seems quite the same for PC (For I
have the PC version). That way it could be read by both gamer groups, and all
possible tips could be shared. Of course it doesn't stop anyone if the name
says either Amiga or PC, but what's the point in making the group
computer-limited?

Not a bug. You landed on a planet with atmosphere without atmospheric

Well, after reading this I decided I'd better go home and check.  Sure enough
you can't use the map tilt to get Pluto.  However, you CAN get Pluto... I've
viewed both it and Charon up close.  How you wonder?  Well, it involves moving
the system forward or back in it's rotation until one of the outer planets is
in line with Pluto... then you center on that planet and zoom in.  You can't
get Pluto to appear when you are centered on Sol, but if you center the map on
one of the outer planets (while Pluto is near that planet... rather than on
opposite ends of their orbits) then you can zoom in and tag Pluto.

Down in the Imperial region there are alot of mining colonies that produce
slaves as a major export.  You can fly from one to the next and fill all your
holds with slaves... and then fly to one of the Terraformed Imperial worlds
that have slaves as a major IMPORT.  Then if you go to the bulletins menu and
find someone who needs slaves desperately and will pay double... well, the sum
is truly staggering.  BTW, a good spot for this is a cluster of planets down
and to the right of Achenar (still in Imperial space though).  Don't remember
any names because I haven't been over that way in about 4 years of game time.

I agree, but unfortunately it seems that even without using this and other
cheats (like the Cemeiss 'take our gems please' bug) there are legitimate ways
to make millions.  It took me less than one game year and 6 hours playing time
to break 4 million... after that you can basically have as much money as you
want.  I did one 3Mc cargo run and stopped... if I'd kept that up for say an
hour or so the total would have been ridiculous (though not as bad as what Mr
Ponos suggests).  All completely legit and 'in game.'  Course it hasn't dulled
my enjoyment because now I'm flying an Imperial Courier and there ARE enemies
out there that can beat my ship.

Actually, I always assumed that they went after all those rocks that you find
floating around in most of the mining systems.  Tiny little asteroids that can
cream your ship but aren't big enough to show up on the system map.  Have to
get a mining machine and test my theory.  That's one of the few things I

Ok, heres my guess.
If you just hover around outside the station, then the target gets windy
and wont come out.
But if you wait till about 15 mins before target, and then hover above the 
port, outside the staion, then they will come out.

If you accelerate time too much you wont even see them!.

Good tip to kill target without getting crim record.
Is to fire a missile first, then blast them with lasers.
This seems to make the police oblivious to the Murder/Piracy rap.
(Well its worked twice with me anyway!)
(All you get it a dont fire weapons here message fine 400creds instead of10000)

Even better tip:  Don't kill em near a starport :-)

Simply  follow  them  through  hyperspace,  or - if interplanetary flight -
until  your  "Relative  to:"  display  doesn't  show the space station's or
starport's  planet  anymore  but the star or any other planet instead, then
fire.

I've fulfilled a few. Go to the place you were told when you got the contract.
Be SURE to be on time! Just before the time you were given, launch, and wait.
At the exact time, your target will leave the spaceport/station, and hyperjump.
Use your hypercloud analyzer to determine where he's gone, and then follow him.
You MUST have a light ship, so that you get to the target system in advance
of your target. Once there, target his arrival cloud (will appear long before
your target does!), and wait.

If there is no arrival cloud, and if he doesn't appear within minutes of the
designated time, he's made a misjump to evade you, and is impossible
to find.

I did this on my first mission:

I waited outside the station then when the ship i should destroy
(Panther Clipper) came i just waited for him to enter hyperspace. 
I checked the cloud and jumped therebefore he did. 
(I got there about 8 hours before him)
Then when he showed up i just blasted him to hell B) 

You have to be pretty quick when the ship you are going to blast enters
because the ship might do a second jump...

Ahh, but you attacked in the protected area of a Space Station (or
ground station...). I had a similar experience - I couldn't get back
to collect my reward. After cursing for a while, I restored a saved game
and tried again, this time waiting for the target to move out of
protected space. Luckily he didn't jump (he was on his way to a local
planet), although had he done so I had a Hyperspace analyser, so I
could follow him.

Anyway, the upshot is, once out of protected space I blasted him
without any Federation reprisals and went and collected my
reward.

As an aside - I though it *really* clever that when I targeted the
ship close to the planet, he turned and tried to get back to the surface,
getting closer to the police forces that would protect him...

regards,
Darren

  The only reason i killed him on the planet was because as soon as he
  launches he hyperdrives to another system. So basically its the only
  chance i had.

 Alot have asked how to "do in" a contract in frontier... Complaining
why the ships aint showing up at the right time.. Well perhaps the
reason is, that the ship only shiw up for some 20 secs, before jumping
into hyperspace! So if you use just 3x time, you will be sure to miss
it... My strategy is to wait for the sucker just below hyperspace
altitude, and then blast the jerk to heaven, as he takes off!

Good Luck And Remember That Frontier Rulez!

Creating an alt group would be an idea. And if Braben keeps his promises 
and releases add-ons to Frontier, the popularity of this game will
last quite a while. Furthermore if he could release a ship/mission/planet-
editor, this would be THE Game. Oh well, one can always dream...

The problem Im having is similar.
I've got a viper defence craft with a type-2 hyperdrive.
I sell my old one, get a type-3 hyperdrive and put in lots of fuel.
Nothing happens! I can't take off, or eject out of an orbital space port.
I've tried buying the type-3-drive from all places, but the same thing
happens. BTW It also happens when I by any military drive and stock up
with military fuel.

Any ideas.
I dont particularly want to get rid of the viper as its got a pretty
far hyperspace capabilities.

Thanks..

I have tried something like this from starports. In my cases, the internal
fuel-storage was empty so the interplanetary drive couldn't be fed.
Try refuelling.

Another thing: Sometimes when I accelerate time during docking, my ship
crashes with the station/surface. I experienced this once too without
accelerating time (undercarriage WAS intact). Seemes to me, that saving
(often) is essential.

Again: REFUEL. When selling a hyperdrive, the internal fuel-storage is
emptied and needs refuelling (the program even says so).

I don't have any problems with doing it manually.  In fact, often I
turn off the auto pilot, because I can approach a planet faster by
hand than by auto pilot.  This can be very handy when you have some
due date coming up soon. When approaching by hand you can make use of
the stronger forward thrusters for both acceleration and
deacceleration. The actual docking is also much easier in Frontier
compared to Elite, because the on board computer will automatically
rotate your ship when you get close enough.

If you want to pan the sector map around quickly, hold down the right

Last year I was doing the old Sol, Barnard route on my Panther
Clipper. Those ships come standard with a Class 8 Hyperdrive. I
haven't seen those suckers advertised anywhere, though.

Eh. You're quite right -- after posting, I noticed afterwards that every
Panther Clipper is sold with a Class 8 hyperdrive as standard equipment.
I sincerely hope that it's possible to acquire one on the free market,
too (not for my own sake -- such a monster probably weighs more than
the entire ship I'm flying right now -- but it would show that there
is hidden stuff like that in the game.)

I don't know whether you can acquire added equipment through the
military or not, yet. I'm only up to Sergeant in the Feddie military...
at this point, they start actually paying you well for carrying things
like High Command communications and secret orders. No opportunities
to beat up on those slave-trading weenies in the Empire yet, though.

Commander Sachs10, Adder, Competent... hmm, about time to buy a new
ship. Maybe a Constrictor, or Cobra Mark III... decisions, decisions.

	I have a class 8 hyperdrive. And about 109 shields, which never
have been below 97%, even when attacking around 8 police ships (well,
not really attacking, just getting rammed by them).

	Oh, I forgot, I have since sold that 2000 tonner and bought
some dinky think with good range... I can carry 7 tons of cargo
now, but I get to do lots of missions.

Nuclear missiles do exist, I look through the code (PC version), and there was
mention of a mission where they supplied you with a missile with a nuclear
warhead. I've not actually got far enough in military ranking to be given such
a mission yet though :(

I got 50 shield units and moved _into_ the space station, through its walls!
I had to set thrusters to quite a high speed before my ship even moved, once
I was inside. The space station took damage (?) from my ship breaking
through the walls, and of course I fired my large plasma accelelator
continuously. I fired and crashed inside the space station for half an hour.

Guess what happened?


Nothing. Space stations cannot be destroyed, it seems :-(

I also have zoomed out far enough to see these extra galaxies. Their
regular arrangement should give a clue as to their origin. I think you
will find that they are mirror-images of the Milky Way, caused by 
numerical overflow. This is probably the same problem that causes
the worm-hole bug.

Ok... I'm looking for the Fer-de-lance fighter in Elite II (It was a rather 
nice ship in Elite I) But I have yet to find it.  Does it exist in this game?
I have found MANY new ships... and of course many of the old ones.  The 
Constrictor is nice.  I think that was the one you had to kill in one of the
missions in the first Elite.  Something about it being an experimental ship
and it had a cloak.  Anyway, I am looking for the Fer-de-lance fighter.
Does it exist anymore?  If so, where.  If not, someone find Braben, and make 
him put it back!

When in need of time, use this little "feature":

Set your destination when you get out of hyperspace and activate the
Autopilot to set your course correctly. Then go to manual control and
accelerate all you can until you're about 1-2AU from your target.
At this point reactivate the Autopilot and watch the docking sequence.

My Panther Clipper went from 20000 km/s to 0  km/s before I could utter
"Wha...?"

In Denmark, at least, a disk costs the equiv. of 1$ while a standard-priced
game costs the equiv. of 50-60$. Now that's something that seriously affect
me "liking" the game.

I've learned from previous experience, so now I purchase my games in
England. This reduces the price to about 35-45$ a piece, and includes
English tax, postage and (sometimes) Danish tax too. It seems to me,
that piracy lives because too many want's a piece of the cake.
At least in some parts of the world...

As far as I can see, it has nothing to do with distance, but given
your position, there seems to be splotches of space that are somehow
linked to your current position, and any planetary systems within
these splotches can be reached with the proper amounts of fuel
as if you were positioned at it's center.

1) I have played Frontier for a week now - spent my time mostly
trading: first Barnard - Sol and later (with an Asp and then
larger ships) between Cemiess and 36Ophiuchi. I am left ranked
below average with 27M credits - means: no more trading.


2) I lost my first battles, because the enemy ships were too fast
for me... (I know here are some guys, who do fighting really well).
With my new tactics I won each fight - flying an Asp with 4MW beam
laser and 10 shields. When I am attacked I follow the movements
of the enemy with my scanner until he is in sight. Then I do stop time
immediately. With game stopped you can select the enemy and put the
autopilot on him. Turning back to normal time and pressing space bar
to fire at the right moment is enough for the smaller ships. The only
problem is crashing with the enemy. To avoid that - simply stop time -
move to manual control and resume playing. Start again the procedure
from scratch...

3) I don't like to do the missions - I want to go to Achenor for a big fight
and to explore what`s left in the game.

Here is my question, finally: I found a system called Urhoeth (near Cemiess).
It is called Frontier-System. The system itself looks pretty boring - nothing
special inseide. IS A FRONTIER-SYSTEM SOMETHING SPECIAL?? WHAT IS A FRONTIER-
SYSTEM??

I  once  owned a star ship with that drive fitted from scratch.  I think it

   Is this a bug or what? Somehow I managed to shoot myself! I was
  flying a Panther Clipper, and just for the fun of it, started
  shooting a nearby asteroid. I aimed my turret and... the beam
  hit my hull! Oh dear...
   It happens very seldom, though. It usually occurs in the border
  between the top turret and the bottom turret. If you have a beam 
  laser, aim it VERY slowly towards the border (firing all the time), 
  and *kaboom*. Do it at your own risk... ;)

   Another silliness which occurred to me, was when I was landed on 
  the New 'Cisco station on Earth. I had a look around with the 
  external view, and gee, all of a sudden a mountain appeared out
  from nothing and buried my ship underneath. Having a look around
  revealed that the mountain had appeared inside a nearby city-dome.
  
   Upon another landing, I wanted to admire the stars and planets move,
  so I turned on the Stardreamer. The suns and planets rose and set, 
  wow, but the clouds didn't move an inch. Get this aesthetic nitpick
  fixed, Braben! :)

   David Braben, if you happen to read this, I'd find surface dots 
  very helpful when landing manually. If you're ever intending to 
  publish an update disk, please try to include this feature. Another 
  thing helpful while landing would be, that your ship had a shadow 
  right below it (regardless of the light source). It could be 
  explained to be "simulated by your onboard computer", if some people 
  won't otherwise tolerate it.

Well, all that just isn't necessary. I win every battle with my CobraMKIII,
no shields and an 1MW Beam Laser. Just a little bit of practice. No
autopiloting required (the battles are only challenging when I'm attacked
by large numbers of Beam Laser equipped ships).

Love the game, though. I'm now fulfilling Federal Missions (where, by the
way, the Class-3 military drive is recommended to get everywhere in time).

The other day i was flying around in my python, and got the usual
ship under attack warning, so off i went shooting like madman. All of
sudden i heard the sound of missile launch, so i instinctively hit my naval 
ECM nothing happened, then i realised that the incomming missile warning 
didn`t happen. Paused the game, hit F10 to label everything in view and their
next the enemy ship was a mine. Unfortunately the pirate had the brains of
a PC user, and flew straight into its own mine.

So for your info mines are immune to ECM.

Maybe it was a dummy proximity mine -- those don't blow up, although I
suppose it would damage a small ship to run into one. ECM will destroy
ordinary proximity mines.

BTW, here's a solution for those who'd rather run into their pirates in
groups, rather than one-at-a-time: Use the current system map. Select
the dots indicating spacecraft near your current position. Interrogate
them at long range with your communicator icon; if you ask what they're
doing here and they reply "None of your business," they're pirates. Now,
use the autopilot to fly towards _them_! You'll have an indicator on your
screen of how far away they are all the time, so you can crank the time
acceleration slower and slower until you run into them at perhaps only
2 or 3 x normal time... and then they'll come screaming in in a group.
I haven't run into anything bigger than a group of three pirates, but
heck, three is enough for me right now.

Once you've beaten up the pirates, you're free and clear to fly insystem
at maximum time acceleration. I find this is the best workaround for the
pirate bug.

The best way to get multiple opponents is to do a photo mission and just linger
around over the site.  You need a decent military or naval rank before they'll
give you one of these missions, but they are great fun... you CAN sneak in and
get the pictures and blast out before they have any time to react... but it's
alot more enjoyable to just hover over the base for a half hour or so until
you've got something like 100+ enemies weaving all around you.

NOT recommended for those with small ships.  I've traded in my Imperial Courier
for a Tiger Trader with class 5 hyperdrive (more range on jumps was the
important factor).  I've got 17 shields, a 4 MW beam front mounted, and a
turreted 30 MW mining laser.  The above sort of enemy cloud (which includes all
sorts of ships... not just vipers like in police attacks) is survivable with
little or no damage... provided I don't mess up.  Keep going in a straight line
for more than 5 seconds and you've had it.

Hi, 

You have been commenting on problems with running the Frontier demo on
A2500...

I believe the Frontier demo has problems with A2500 configurations, but
that the game itself does not. I believe that you can get preview/rental copies
in your local area, so that you can try before buying to minimise your
financial exposure.

Most demos are derived from early beta-phase software. (This is particularly
true of demo disks available with computer magazines, as they have to be
available to meet publication deadlines.)

To be fair to David Braben and his beta-testers, please try or buy the *real
thing* and send your comments via Dino Dini (amiga@hosta.dircon.co.uk) to
David.

I tried to do as you suggested, but lifting the gear up crashes my ASP

to accept the fact that this saved game is lost... (Big boys don't cry ;)

Anyway, I want to say thank you for all the suggestions and hints. Sadly I

You can definitely get trapped in subsurface hangars, even with a full tank
of gas, half a pack of cigarettes, 112 miles from Chigago... *erm, cough*.
Seriously, this ain't no myth, it's a sad fact. Even with fresh, spotless
engines this can happen.

I've since encountered the non-refueling version of this problem.  Quite right
it >IS< a bug.  Solution; point yourself at one of the base walls (I go towards
the big sign) and hit enter to build up a little motion.  Then, before you hit
the wall hit max time compression.  This gets you outside free and clear
without damaging the undercarriage (going from a standing start will damage
your landing gear).  Sometimes it doesn't work... this always seems to be tied
to the wall you choose... I'd guess you are 'jumping out' into the planet
itself in that case... just try the other walls until you find a good one.

>I always use time compression...otherwise it would take too long.
>It's probably more realistic but it's not good for the gameplay.

Well, slightly under max compression for the short space required to reach the
enemy without 'jumping' them shouldn't be a problem.  However, there IS another
way to get multiple enemies.  Do a photo mission and stick around for a bit.
The target will launch MANY MANY MANY different ships to come after you.  Very
fun in the dogfighting department.

I've run into opponents that could take out a panther.  The above mentioned
'cloud' of enemies around a protracted photo mission would chew a bulky panther
to pieces in no time.  NOT that it's likely to happen since there is almost NO
way a plodding panther could ever COMPLETE a photo mission on time.  The
panther is GREAT one on one if you don't care about getting somewhere fast.
However, for the advanced missions it's basically worhtless.  Indeed, I've had
to trade in my Imperial Courier because IT was too slow.  Now I'm flying a
Tiger Trader... which I believe is the closest to the 'ideal ship' in the game.
Fuel scoops, 12.5 ly (with class 5), 12.x acceleration, room for good weapons,
room for fuel for 2 jumps.  It's not QUITE what I'd want (15 ly and accel with
about 25 more space for cargo and gadgets would be true perfection) but it's
good enough for almost any mission.  The panther is hopeless for anything but
the simple stuff.

I did one removal job just for the fun of it, and my pray showed up at the
precise time mentioned. From what I read in the manual I'm certain that
Braben deliberately makes some "customers" not show up, it is stated that
if the ship is absent at the given time it won't show up at all.

Why don't you fix all the other bugs also?  At least the BBS bug should be

Same here. I started out doing big time trading, mainly between Sol
and Barnard. I am very disappointed that those British programmers
couldn't implement a single German city in Frontier. Where is Berlin?

I tried out that method, but it fails too often for me.  Once you
activate the auto pilot, it seems that not only can you aim very
easily at the enemy, but so can the enemy him/her-self.  50% of the
time I get blown up myself before I managed to land a good shot.  My
best tactic is to do it all by hand...  just aim and shoot with full
thrusters.  With that method I almost never get any damage (especially
if I have a small and fast ship).  It is difficult to land a hit on
the small ships, but since they don't have any shields, every hit
counts on their hull. The bigger the ships, the easier it is to
hit them. Only problem with the bigger ships becomes the shield.

I recommend going to Phekda for getting into battle hassles...

... there I was, cruising along with 86 shields: bleep, I'm under attack.(!),
gee, I'm looking forward to this...
Hmm, check the scanner, gee, I see an orange blob####### POOF!...

Ahem!!! I just got my STUFF BURNT OFF by something that looked rather imperial
cruiser-ish firing a whining beam... I didn't get to see it long enough...
rather embarassing... (well, an '040 at 33Mhz makes it perhaps a tad too smooth,
er, fast?)... 
              ... a cloud of confetti where my ship and I used to be..., dang!

...let's try that again!...

So, now I build up to 100 shields (Panther Clipper, small plasma accel., and
top & bottom turret 4MW beam lasers)... as I said, let's try that again...

...jump,jump,jump,jump,jump... hewwo der, Phekda space... dum de dum de dum...
OoH! I'm being attacked agai#############... eeeYaHHH!!! (dodge,spin,parry,
thrust?...) ahh yes, thrust... where'd that critter go?,... what's that burning
smell?, oh merde, I have 14.3 percent hull remaining (belch)...

I say!...why, that extra 14 shields worked pretty good, didn't it... (sheesh)

...OK, pause mode, where's that thing?,... oh great, my scanner is knocked out
too, that's just perfect... well then I'm just gonna write an alphabet on your
face with the F10 key (heh heh, take that!)... "whoopsy, your code is showing",

...aim turret, test the beam on that frozen image casting venom at me; that's
a nice flashbulb effect were gonna see in a moment,... hm, while I'm at it, I
might as well get some identification details, look at the birdie... uh huh,
thought so, some Imperial cruiser thingy...
                                           hit the space-bar to fire, and click
back to normal time,.. phhZZZZZZODDDDD! (kerflash-squipple-poof) got 'em!!!

OK. So, dispatching a few gnats along the remainder of the flight, I go limping
into a Phekda base for stock and repairs (I hate that waiting for the repairs
to build up...yeah, I thought of using a hull auto-repair swap-in, but wouldn't
you know it, that base didn't have one! (sigh)...)

...grrr...grrr...ah, wait a second, DANG! Where'd my class 8 hyperdrive go?!!!
(Oh, THAT figures... explains that burning smell I got earlier...)

Now I carry 140 shield units when I go there. Hm. Not quite a trivial place
to visit, depending on the mood of the 'natives'...

Where's Phekda you ask? Don't you know your star names? :-)
It's in 'the dipper' (there's a Phekda in your dipper?), so think 'north';
so you get Alioth, Megrez, etc.... Phekda is located above the top edge of the
poster map, a sector or two to the right of Alioth and up just a bit...

(Toasted at 86 shields in Phekda; be careful there.)

Sort of related tale.  Someone asked a while back why pirates don't
surrender when they have virtually no ship left, its simple - you can still
beat 'em.

I was tootling along in my lowly Asp (4MW Beam, 4 Shields (I still carry cargo))
when a good ole Imperial Courier took a dilike to me, one shot wiped my hull 
down to 0.1% and also took out the laser cooler.  It then proceeded to miss
me for the rest of the fight and I took him out and managed to get somewhere
to repair.

So don't dispair!

Frontier clocks over at about 200,000,000 credits, over to
_negative_ credits.  Did this by using 'the bug' -- having a
large 2000 tonne ship, and a passenger, and trying to 'sell' the
ship to buy a Viper, you don't because you have a passenger, but
you get the money.  Do that a few dozen times, at 2.5Mcr a pop,
and you amass serious amounts of money.

Which spoils the game enormously. :-(

I restarted, and I've got an Imperial Courier, which is waycool,
EXCEPT, it can't have fuel scoops, so I can't go exploring like I
wanted to.

Also you cannot upgrade the hyperdrive to level 6! 'The drive is
an integral part of your ship'. Damn.

	Try getting shot up real good.. sometimes this will trash your 
hyperdrive (gives you a huge pile of rubbish) and I assume you can replace
it with something better (unfortunatly this only happens to me in frontier
systems where they don't have anything decent to buy)

I thought about that, too. But your rebuilding idea is really cool.
The information of destroyed airports could be saved to your disk and
after a year or so, they get restored (and hence need not be listed on
the disk anymore).

I think it is quite obvious WHY they can't be destroyed (not that I
wouldn't enjoy it, though;). Every time you would destroy a Space Station
or a Space Port, it would have to be saved with your Commander, to avoid 
you flying to sol, blasting New-York away, jumping to Barnard and back,
and wondering how they rebuild it in less than 20 days. (would be pretty
cool to have half build Space Stations with drones flying around for

There have been several people asking for help completing the assassinations
in Frontier.  The 'method that works' can be laid out as follows;

1:  Get there early.  Actually I've once or twice seen the target ship
arriving at the port, don't know if it would count as a kill to get them
BEFORE the appointed time.

2:  Wait until the appropriate time.  This can be a problem... in ONE of my
assassinations they were charging me with 'piracy and murder' two days before
the event.  If this is the case you've probably lost your shot.

3:  About a minute (or as many as 20) before the time listed on the roster
leave the port.  Fly out (and a little to the side so they don't run into you)
and kill your engines.  Then turn around.

4:  At the exact second listed on the roster the enemy ship will appear.
Target your tracking tunnel on him and get ready to follow through hyperspace
(you need a hyperspace cloud analyzer).  Sometimes he will stay in the same
system... in this case follow until you are out of range of the space station
and then kill him.  If you do not see him leaving at the appropriate time you
may be too far from the station... target the station itself and check the
radar mapper and hyperspace cloud analyzer... if either shows a reading you
have him and can follow as per the above.

5:  Once you've gone through hyperspace find the target.  The analyzer lists
both destination and arrival TIME.  This is important.  If you get there before
him find his arrival cloud and get to it... then, when he appears pounce on him
immediatly.  Otherwise, check the map and find his location... should be on a
line between you and the port he is heading for.  Use autopilot to close in on
him and destroy.

Do not:  Attack while near a starport, leave the base AFTER the appointed time,
or wait outside for a prolonged period.  Saved games are also useful when doing
this sort of mission... there are often unforseen problems that can only be
fixed by backing up (like the target jumping to a system outside your range).

DEDICATED TO GOD, erm ..... David Braben

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

FRONTIER ....

One and a half years ago we read a work in progress report in THE ONE.  From
then on we devoured any screen shots we could get our hands on.  Two weeks
ago we managed to get our hands on this game, and since then have not stopped
playing it.  Our current year dates are MATT - May 3207, DAVE - November 3204,
and over this time we have experimented with different aspects of the ELITE
universe, and here are some of the things we have discovered :

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

FLIGHT TIPS :

HOW TO ROUGH LAND :

A bit of a tricky one this, if your in a heavy ship!  The trick is to look
at the mass of the planet your trying to land on, anything above 0.25 Earth
masses will be tricky, but it is not impossible!

First an explanation of how the gravity will have effect on your ship.
Yes I do believe old David did think about gravity - either that or it's
a very coincidental bug!! For example an Imperial Courier is labeled as being 
480 Tonnes in weight - this is it's weight on Earth. On a planet on 0.25 Earth 
masses the ship will actually be 120 Tonnes in weight. In other words you will 
float down much more slowly, but still like a brick!

The manual mentions that you must point the nose up to create a little bit 
of lift to act against the gravity, but this means travelling at speed, and 
landing at speed means you will crash! Lower your speed and raise the nose
so that you are falling slowly (about 3 metres per second) and travelling
forwards at about 150kph. When your altitude is about 15-20m cut the set speed
to 0 and throw the nose forwards until it is horizontal. You should be down!

You will notice that the heavier the ship and heavier the planet the more you 
will have to raise the nose to come in. When I had a Imperial Courier on one
planet I came in almost vertically!!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO FUEL SCOOP OFF A GAS GIANT :

Remember you need a fuel scoop and conversion unit to try this one.

Use you're autopilot to get close to the planet to set the ship's speed
relative to that body. Now aim for the top of the planet, at about 15,000kph
and do a bit of time skipping, lowering your speed slowly. Use the targeting 
tunnel to see how fast you're comming in by keeping lines moving at a
consistent speed. Eventually you will see an atmosphere appear around the gas 
giant. Aim for the middle of this - remember to continue to lower your speed!
Soon you will get an altitude reading of 0m, (a gas giant has no surface) by 
this point your speed should be about 4000kph. STOP the time skip. The fuel 
scoop will start working. It will fill your cargo bay first, and then the 
fuel tank. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
HOW TO SLING SHOT :

This ones just for fun, but it is a nice effect.

The idea of a sling shot is to use the gravitation pull of a body to 
gain speed, (used by satelites today!).

Again the effects of this are governed by the mass of the body you are using,
the larger the body the faster you have to be travelling in order to stop
gravity pulling you into it.    

For example, for a large gas giant like Jupiter you need to be traveling at 
about 700+ kps.  Aim just past Jupiter, too close and you'll be dragged you 
into it, too far away and the sling shot will have little effect.  Turn
your engines off to avoid them correcting the pull of Jupiter.  Speed things
up with the time skip, and whatch your ship accelerate!  You'll notice 
that you'll do a part orbit of Jupiter before you actually start flying
away.  Turn your engines on and look at how much speed you've gained!

You might find this takes several attempts to get the speed and distance
right so that you don't crash!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO DO ASSASSINATIONS :

A fun little job this, causing havoc and destruction!

First go to the bulletin board and look for an assassination advert.  If
your Elite rating is high enough (about average!), you'll be offered the
job.  Get to the point of the assassination, make sure your at the right
starport or space station.

If your on a planet, rough land outside the starport and wait until the 
right time.  Use the time skip and save options to get as close to the
correct time as possible.

If your waiting outside a space station, make sure your not waiting
directly outside the doors otherwise a ship may fly out and hit you!  Again
use the time skip and save options.  Make sure you can see the door of the
space station, so you can see the victim coming out!

At the correct time, (down to the second), the victim will emerge from the
station or starport.  If your on a planet, take off a few seconds before the
desired time.

There are two ways you can take the victim out :

The first one requires that you have a hyperspace cloud analyser, and a 
hyperdrive capable of a large jump, (about 15 light years +).  Consult the 
manual about hyperspace jump distances, and the time it takes. It'll be in the
Hyperspace jumps section, (page 32). When the victim hyperspaces, use the 
analyser and jump after him.  If your lucky he will have a lesser hyperspace 
jump capablity than you and you will arrive a day or so before him.  He will 
appear in roughly the same place as you appeared.  When he arrives, KICK ASS!

The second way involves a little more coordination, and cool.  When the
victim emerges from the space station, or starport, target him to get the
distance reading.  Accelerate after him, shooting all the way.  Watch your
speed to make sure you don't fly past him! (Remember look at your set speed
not your actual speed!).  By this time your friendly neighbourhood police
will be hot on your tail, try to ignore them!  Once the victim has been
fried, select communications and pay the fine remotely to get rid of your
fugitive legal status, you will have just gained!  After all this has been
accomplished, pick a nearby system and GET OUT OF THERE!  You will notice 
that you will have a criminal record but your legal status will be clean, so
no bounty hunters will be after you!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO MINE :

Remember that you must have an MB4 mining rig to perform this.

To do this you must have perfected your fuel scooping, and rough landing
skills.  The reason for this is that you must pick a planet or system, which
has a little or no registered settlers otherwise when you get there the
planets will probably be mined out!  This means there will be no starports for 
you to use your autopilot to guide you down to the surface.  This is
where you have to use your fuel scooping skills aiming for the top of the 
planet, i.e. coming in on a low obital path, until you get an altitude 
reading.

You'll need to pick a planet above freezing point otherwise your likely to 
end up mining water!  If you pick a planet with a starport you'll get a
fine and the police will attack.

Guide yourself in and rough land on the planet surface.  Once landed deploy
your MB4.  After about 8 months come back and land near it, (about 0.1 km
away).  Pick up the hopper and fly off with your mined goods.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

SO WHAT'S THE BEST SHIP???

An argument that seems to be going on, recently is "What is the best ship?".

Here's our views :

Asp Explorer -     Small so you don't accidentally colide with 
                   other ships or debris.

                   Manoeuvrable, and little inertia considering 
                   it's size.

                   Very good thruster acceleration, for important 
                   evasive manouvers.

                   Fair light  so good, cheap, hyperspace range.

                   Has a fuel scoop mounting, for cheap hydrogen!

        VERDICT :  Good all rounder though lacking in hull space so you can't
                   have everything at once!

Imperial Courier - Good size to have everything at once.

                   Scores high on looks!!!

                   It's in the intro-sequence!

                   Manoeuvers well for it's size.

          BUT .... Due it's size it hits everything in sight, so at least 7
                   shield generators are needed!

                   Lacks a fuel scoop mounting.

                   Only avaliable from the evil scum EMPIRE!

        VERTICT :  Good trading, and assassination ship, but drinks fuel like
                   mad, so very expensive!  
                   

Tiger Trader -     Good size to have everything at once.

                   Has a fuel scoop mounting.

                   The amount of crew sets you on your way to a Panther.

          BUT .... Not THAT manoeverable.

                   Looks like the back end of a donkey!
                   (except for Matts PINK Tiger Trader!).

                   Have to pay, and find a big crew.

        VERDICT :  Good as a stepping stone for a big cruiser, and as an
                   all round ship it's not bad.

Panther Clipper -  Masive beast!  Anything you want, you've got it!

                   Has a fuel scoop mounting for those long trips.

                   Scores on looks!

         BUT ..... Grotesquely unmanouverable.

                   Gun turrets awkward to use, because they're back-to-front
                   to the flight controls.

                   Eats fuel like THREE Imperial Courier's!

         VERDICT : The ship designed to explore the unexplored worlds, and 
                   designed for the large plasma accelerator - we reckon.
                                                                         

SUMMARY :

So what is the BEST ship?  We think you should buy the ship to suit the
task in hand.  For example I've just gone right back down to an Asp with a 
class 4 hyperdrive so that I can do more military runs!  Matt's currently in a
Tiger Trader (PINK YUK!) because he's in two minds whether to go back up 
to a Courier or Panther.

COMMENTS

Alright, alright - here comes the bugs, or playablity "quirks", as we prefer
to call them.

The one I always seemd to get just recently is that the autopilot sometimes 
won't set the relative speed to the correct body! This might not seem like
much of a problem, but when trying to get near a planet, it stopped me dead 
in my tracks. So I turned off the autopilot and the time skip, and went for a
manual dock. But because the relative speed was set to the nearest star and 
not the planet, I found that to actually close on the planet, and then the 
space station, I had to travel at some 110 kms!! I had no way of knowing how
quickly I was catching the space station, and therefore no way of docking.
I tried the autopilot again, but off it went overshooting and generally flying
anywhere, but towards the space station. I tried manually again but the  
relative speed didn't change, so I just quitted and reloaded!! 

But I must stress this IS the only bug I have found, that cannot be sorted 
out by doing something else, like manual control, and so must go down as a 
bug unfortunatly.

Saying this though, we feel it is still the best game ever written, by such a
huge margin.  With such a BIG game as this you have to expect little things
such as this to crop up - WELL DONE DAVID BRABEN and THANKS!
                                                                  
(just one little comment : Has anybody figured out how to start from MARS?
                           We can't work it out!  Any Solutions Greatfully
                           recieved!)

    Asteroid mining?  It is mining and doesn't require planets or 
    starports.  I haven't checked the population of these mining 
    systems, it should be zero.

Maybe they're mining the asteroids? Either my eyes function poorly, or 
there are these little buildings at least on some asteroids.

I remember playing Elite on the 64 and coming across this huge hexagon shaped

Hexagonal, maybe Octagonal.  What ever happened to the Thargoid menace?  Was
it defeated, are the aliens out there still lurking in Witchspace?  Or now
we use Hyperspace are we safe?

That was Thargoids, and the escape pods were child attack ships controlled from
the mother ships. If you killed the big ships, their childs would stop attacking
and you could scoop-em and sell-em. 

You would find them invading on a mission once, but mainly someone found out 
about a key combination which would send you into witch-space (an inbetween
hyperspace) where there would be a few hangin about. They were about the only 
way you could get to be Elite rating since they had such high kill ratings.
Needed the cloaking device tho', and a military laser. They were such FUN!
Hope they appear in Frontier (SLAUGHTER!!!!)

	Where was this?  I've never been (un)fortunate enough to encounter one
.  Did you get to Elite first?  I never quite made it that far (still Deadly),
though I've completed several missions.

> >I spent ages trying to destroy it....

	The manual describes Space Dredgers to be huge (40-mile long!) ships
that carry fleets of reconditioned fighter craft.  It could be one of these.

	Someone has suggested that these might just be Thargoids launching
their thargons.  The Thargoids are 8-sided.  I have never heard of a 6-sided
vessel.  My most recent mission was to destroy a Space Station which the 
Thargoids were using as a base to invade a planet.  Unfortunately, though I
could destroy the station, I never made it any further in the game, since 
whenever I jumped out of the system (even to another galaxy) I had to do it
all over again.  Perhaps if I'd made it past that point I might see a Space
Dredger, since the manual says that they might be found wherever there's been
a Thargoid invasion, or a natural disaster.  Since then I've started over
again (I used a cheat intitially - can't remember what it was - which gave me
an ECM Jammer and a Cloaking Device and I suspect that I might have made a
mess of it, making it impossible for me to complete the mission, amongst other
things).  There might be a possibility of finding a Space Dredger around the
system that went Supernova, though I have been to it many times since and seen
no sign of one.  I'll look again, though.
	Happy flying!

That's weird, because I wasn't very far in the game, and I'm sure I blew up it
with the beginning ship and pulse lasers, because I never had the patience or
time to build up my character.  It did take a long time, though.  I mean a REAL
LONG TIME.

Were you using a 64 or an Amiga?  I'd love to have an excuse to drag my 64 out
of the closet, or even to go down to Digital Arts (my dealer) and buy that
space compilation package that has Elite in it (as well as Wing Commander and
something else).  E-mail me please, if you can remember the cheat.

Or you MIGHT try building your way up in stages.

Is it too tricky to check the bulletin board BEFORE you buy your new ship?  You
look and see that there are 3 crew people... you can then go and buy a ship
which needs 3 more crew than your current one.  Fly to your next port, check
again.  Yes, it costs a little more because you only get 95% of value on trade
in, but if you have the money to afford a panther a few extra 100,000 shouldn't
be a problem.

*rimshot*

Beta Lyrae is a contact binary star, two white dwarfs so close together
that the gravitational pull of each one on the other one distorts its
shape and sends huge streamers of glowing gas pinwheeling into space.
(Er, that's what the scientists guess happens, anyway -- of course, it's
too far away to get a really good look at through our telescopes.)

I am SORELY peeved if Frontier is buggy enough that you just can't go
there! I mean, I think I've cut the game an awful lot of slack already,

Well, I had a hunt around last night in Frontier. I wanted to find
Beta Lyrae, the touching binary star system which is shown on the
galaxy map, but is a very long way from Sol. This system should by
rights be one of the most interesting in the game.

After searching for about 15 mins I found it -- it is in sector
[-146,85].

"Great!", I thought. "I can view it." However, it is an unexplored
system. Luckily, there was a wormhole to a star about 20 Lys
from it. :-) I stripped down my Panther, loaded it up with fuel and
took off.

Half a dozen jumps later I was just about to hyperspace to Beta Lyrae
itself. I decided to save the game at this point, which was a good
thing, because when I made the final jump, my Amiga crashed!

"Ok", I thought, "this was probably bad timing." So I tried it again.
And again. And again. It always crashes.

AAAAAaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrgggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Let me rant at this point:

WHENEVER YOU TRY TO HYPERSPACE TO THE MOST INTERESTING STAR SYSTEM
IN THE ENTIRE FRONTIER GALAXY, THE BLOODY GAME CRASHES! 

I am, to put it mildly, annoyed. If anybody wants to replicate this
bug, I have Amiga Frontier version 1.0, my machine is an A2000 with
hard drive (GVP) and a 16MhZ 68020 accelerator with FPU.

If you like, I could post my save file in a uuencoded form to this
group, and everybody could try it. Maybe somebody can get it to
work, and they could tell all of us about it.

Alternatively, maybe I have found the Frontier aliens -- and they
have a weapon which kills anyone who enters their system. :-)

Regards,


Tom Nettleship (Average/Master/Sergeant/Mighty Pissed Off)



P.S. Just how COULD David Braben have let this one slip through?
     I am stunned by the amount of insectoid life in Frontier. If
     it wasn't for the game's massive scope, I would be very
     disappointed with my purchase.

Now, to carelessly reply to my own post... Just booted up Frontier.
Used the wormhole bug to go to the vicinity of Beta Lyrae; if it's
supposed to be difficult to get to the outskirts of the galaxy, then
this should DEFINITELY be fixed, as with it, you can just cheat your
way around the problems of running out of fuel, drive servicing,
misjumps, and fuel scooping. Beforehand I'd stripped down my Constrictor,
filled it with military fuel, and three large jumps from the "wormhole"
exit and I was at Beta Lyrae.

Well... no, not really. Before the jump completed, the colors spasmed,
the sound and music disintegrated, the screen did fireworks, and my
machine crashed. Nope, can't get there from here.

I'm getting fed up, to be honest. My bug list is several pages long and
gets steadily less good-natured towards the end... frankly, it's quite
obvious that the game was released with no beta-testing _whatsoever_.
That stinks! Now, it's probably not Braben's fault -- I get the
feeling Konami or whoever yanked the game out of his hands and released
it while he was still wrestling with major problems in the code -- but
that doesn't make things any better, does it?

And Beta Lyrae was just the last straw.

To sum up, a big "Boo, hiss" towards the persons responsible. I'm beginning
to get the impulse to shelve Frontier until a _completely_ bugfixed, and
hopefully enhanced, version is released, as it's getting too aggravating
to play. Anyone know just what the situation is with bugfixes?

Has anyone out there successfully picked up cargo (debris,
stuff left after kills). I've given up and sold my cargo scoop.
The combat is difficult, tho possible, but pickup for me always
end up in 15 minutes of chasing, or an autopilot causing it to
smash all my shields....

As for mining, is it worth it? Doesn't it just make you end
up with 30 tonnes of minerals after 8 months, worth about

Looking through the executable I noticed a few things.

- There don't seem to be any chips which are not listed in the manual.
The only exception to this is the Lynx Bulk Carrier and the Long Range
Cruiser. I still hope we can buy these on some system. :)

- There is an ESCORT mission, in which you get paid daily to escort a
ship to some destination. Pretty interesting, he? Has anybody gotten
such a mission, yet?

- There seems to be some kind of INSURANCE in the bulletin. No idea
what it does though.

- There is a fighter launch device in the game somewhere. Must be an
equipment which you can add to your ship.

- It looks like there is no Class 8 Hyperdrive and >Class 4 Military
Drive. Except for the Panther Clipper which has the Class 8 Hyperdrive
already built in.

Has anyone tried going to unexplored systems where data has only been collected
via a telescope?
Well I went to several, even after going around the systems several times,
visiting each of them in turn, the data screen (F6) still said the system was
unexplored, and refused to show any graphics of the (now) explored star and
planets. Surely exploring systems and filling in the unfilled parts of the
galaxy is one of the things you can do in the game?
Has anyone else either suffered the same problem, or better still found a
solution?

btw who said the Panther clipper had a fuel scoop? - they lied!

Dream on. Can't you people see that Frontier is so full of bugs
and so limited in gameplay it STINKS badly. I just MIGHT be a good
game someday, but for now...

there is no way to record your 'findings' .. also there's NO thargoids,
NO aliens, NOTHING unique out there...

Well it just popped up to my mind : long ago when i still played Elite
Actively (once a week atleast on a PC though) I got as far as :
                ARCHANGEL Stalker (Elite)
 soo after a while I quitted but still once in a while I
play for some time and go berserk on the Anarchy planets :)

I`ll admit right now that I have never seen/played it. I`ve been waiting for 
it though and if I can get a job over Christmass.... :-)
What I am thinking is this. Is (whichever company markets Frontier) offering a 
return your disk for latest release policy and if not why not! Think about it. 
Nobody is going to shell out another 30 just for the latest version, they 
have it in storage, they just have to pay someone to copy it onto floppy and 
post it. The result, everyone is happy and the company stand better than a cat 
in hells chance of people buying their software in future when it is released 
(and not waiting for v1.03).  Second point. The company has an internet 
address (I hope). There are lots of very good Amiga hackers out there.  People 
have code that fixes bugs in Frontier. Why the hell arn`t they being asked to 
send it in to be compiled for the next version? Ok, you could argue that it 
would take away the jobs of the employees, but then again, wouldn`t it be 
better for them to be able to work on V2.00 :-) Seems obvious to me, but then 
again I`m an Astrophysicist not a Businessman ! Just a thought...

We (a bunch of three AMIGA Frontier freaks) saw a patch for Frontier here a 
few days ago which should inactivate the frontier copy protection. However,
this hack was for the english version 1.00, but we got the german version 
1.01 from our local games shop.

Does anybody know how to patch Frontier V1.01 german in order to remove the 
rather nasty copy protection (where the hell is manual again :-))?

Any help appreciated
Kasi Mir

BTW: Of course we have a (i.e. three) LEGAL copy of Frontier (only DM 59.95 
at our local shop over here in Hamburg).

You're supposed to be able to buy one when you're ELITE and a PRINCE in

Alright, I haven't checked it too thoroughly (having more interesting things
to examine in the game), but I believe it works as follows;

Wherever your ship is located in three dimensional space is used to determine
the number of tons of fuel required to jump to a nearby system.  Additionally
(likely due to overflow problems) a circle which is the locus of all points
660 lightyears from your current location is treated AS your current location.
A similar circle occurs at 1320 lightyears... and I suspect the next is at
either 1980 or 2640 (multiples of 660 or doubling every time).  Note that this
is true for a Tiger Trader with class 5 warp... I >THINK< the wormhole effect
is constant regardless of ship and drive type, but I might be mistaken...
again, I haven't looked into it for more than about two minutes real time.

The area you can jump to can thus be described as follows where l=your drive's
jump range;

within l lightyears of current x,y,z coordinates   AND
within l lightyears of any point 660 lightyears from current x,y,z coordinates
within l lightyears of any point 1320 lightyears from x,y,z coordinates
etc.....

The 660 figure also might be slightly off... could be 663 or 657... whatever,
it's somewhere around there, and it definitely forms a circle around your
present location.

Thus, if you want to take the express route to some specific distant system
you can move about in the inhabited regions until you have set yourself up
660 (or 1320 or whatever) lightyears from the destination and jump directly
there from 'normal' space.

The Fer-de-lance is not mentioned in the back of the manual, so is unlikely to be in the game.

And here I'm getting e-mail messages from people who tell me my 'how to do
assassinations' breakdown is flawed because it suggests not attacking right
away.

The point of these missions becomes alot more apparent if you let the target
leave the port and follow them.  If they hyperspace then YOU hyperspace.  It
isn't hard.  If you attack them as soon as they leave be prepared to make
little or no money, destroy your reputation, have a permanent criminal record,
and damage your future relations with the government in question.  So much
easier and more effective to kill them outside of regulated space.  I think
you only have to be something like 1/2 angstrom unit out from the nearest port
to be clear from reprisals.

Frontier GUIDE - update...


We've had LOADS of excellent responses by too many people to name, but rest 
assured email addresses have been noted, we will try and write back a.s.a.p. 

All the beastly tips we've had are being compiled for a furture GUIDE, so keep
talking!!!

Well it's now Wednesday, Saturday was when we wrote THE GUIDE, and as you may 
have guessed we are still playing the game, so here's some new stuff!!



Matt c2mjw@dum.ac.uk - Amiga
Dave c2djm@dum.ac.uk - PC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


COMBAT

You may have noticed that in the first guide we missed out a combat section, but
on finding out from various mail we recieved that most commanders were Average
or above, we thought you obviously know how to fight, but here are some points
some of you may not know... 

Note: For the uninformed Port = left, Starboard = right

EASY KILLS 




Matt's - Thrust 'an spin (Amiga)

This is a good one, one I always use anyway!! Ships usually come from infront 
and straight for you!! So why not try this...

Turn about 10 degrees to the port or starboard, and hit some forward thrust.
Look at your scanner to see when the sucker is about alongside. Then spin round 
to face him and hit full thrust after him, keeping him in your sights. You 
should now be on his tail. Obviously you can choose when to shoot - I can't tell
you that, but I like trying to sit on a ship's tail and see how long I can stay 
there. This tactic works supprisingly well on the smallest of ships, too.




Matt's - Chicken run (Amiga)

This is very effective if you have a 4 - 20MW beam laser, and is very quick to
despatch the skilless little squidler ships that turn up blue on the scanner (I 
think thats about 0 - 16t).

Again this works best when a ship comes from directly in front, but still 
effective when they come from any other direction.

When under attack turn to face the other ship as quick as you can, and then turn
only about 5 degrees the the port or starboard (just enough for the other ship 
to miss when shooting) and hit forward thrust just to get him in range of your 
guns. Then hit reverse thrust for a bit, for him to approach more slowly, then
cut the engines again. Get him in your sights and shoot a short distance ahead
of him, stop turning. The other ship should run straight into your laser. 

This is a bit risky for a big enemy ship with good guns, 'cos he may just turn 
to face you as well, but if done properly they don't have the chance as they're 
already space dust. Little ships however, never have the firepower to trouble 7
shield generators, and are normally wasted by the time they get close enough to 
shoot.




Dave's - Stuka dive (PC)

When a ship attacks from a position close to the front, slam the engines on full
forward thrust and pull up. Look at the scanner to see when the target is nearly
directly below (don't thrust too much or he'll be out of range. Cut the engines
and turn 180 degrees straight down at the enemy ship and thrust forwards letting
rip, try to shoot slightly ahead of him as well. He can't shoot at you from this
position. A beam laser is what is really required for this. Works best on the 
medium class of ship.




EVASIVE MANOUVERS/COUNTER ATTACKS



Matt's - Twister (Amiga, and PC apparently)

A good one for when getting seriously hammered by laser fire. I do this when in
total panic, ie getting shot by some Elite pilot with a beam laser.

If getting shot from head-on (it does happen sometimes) I use this little number
to get out of the laser fire and onto the enemy ship's tail.

Basically if getting shot from the front I turn 90 degrees hard port and hit 
forward thrust forward for a couple of seconds. Then I pull up 180 degrees and 
thrust forward to face the path of the enemy by which time he's just about 
flying past. Then you can return fire when he goes past or turn 90 degrees to 
the port and thrust forward after him. Confusing without a diagram isn't it!!



GENERAL

These are just some of the tactics we use for a laff and for an impresive fight.
Use them if you will, but I ALWAYS find I turn my engines off and use forward 
and reverse thrust to get my out of trouble or into a kill scoring position.

Also I have noticed that on the Amiga and PC versions sometimes the sound FX for
getting hit doesn't work, and the only way you can tell if you getting hit is if
you see the hull getting damaged! One way of noticing if you're getting hit is
to look for a laser hitting the egde of the display, a laser will NEVER fill 
your display. Try going to an external view zooming in and shooting the camera, 
you'll see what I mean. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SHOOTING MISSILES

Not much use this one, more for fun really. YES! Missiles can be shot whether 
you are travelling towards a planet, or not! Missiles at one point or another 
will come from behind - either launched from a ship from behind, or manouvering
themselves into that position. 

Turn your engines off. When a missile is behind hit full forward thrust (if 
you're in a half-decent ship it won't quite hit you). Wait until the missile is
about 0.5 - 1.5km behind, by either targeting it or looking at the scanner, then
spin round 180 degrees and hit reverse thrust. Now let rip!! Missiles are more
visible if you turn the text on and missile will appear alongside the, er, 
missile. It is difficult to hit though and you definately need a beam laser!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


USING MISSILES

Most of you may have noticed that missiles are completely useless in combat, cos
the target keeps on running away. Not so!! Have you every tried launching a 
missile at a target and then hitting the time skip? Well presuming the target
doesn't have somesort of ECM system he should get blown away!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We've read loads of letters that state you need 3,000 shields, just to live not 
so! At the minute I (Matt) have down graded from my Tiger Trader, after 
forgetting that the gun turrets are just too confusing to use after a prelonged 
period shooting ships with a front mounted laser, to an Asp. At the minute both 
of us are doing runs for the Federal military (Not Imperial SCUM!!) in Asp's 
with a Class 4 hyperdrive, NO shields, 4MW beam laser, Scanner, Radar mapper 
and an autopilot. I still haven't come close to getting wasted. 

We hope that some of the above tactics will help convince some of you that you
don't need shields, but just good combat knowlegde.

Oh, by the way Matt's had 2 "Right on commander"'s from Elite Federation, now,
what are these for? A certain number of kills? A good kill?

Well that will have to be it for now, we've got loads of coursework to do so we
had better get on with it...

The trick is to jettison all radioactives on exit from hyperspace


And while on the subject...

I have found a couple of niggles in (the pc version) this game:

-In the beginning of the game, i fired a shot with my lasers nearby mars high
 I got fined in the ordynary way... BUT i also got ELITE status

-After the first episode my interpol status was set to fugitive
 later i discovered when i was about to dock in a neutral system that i owed
 ca. 850000, when i settled that i became clean...

I have just got frontier(don`t know the version - where do I find out?)
and have more than once misjumped and not had enough fuel to go anywhere.
Calling for help doesn`t do much! HELP!!!


Also - what a stupid protection system - I put my letter in, saved it, and then
it kept killing me when I went out of the station by claiming 	 had put in
the wrong letter. AAAARRGH!

How fast does frontier run on an A1200 - and does
it take advantage of fast ram? Is a 1200 version planned?

BTW, you should be prepared to be really, really, _really_ cheesed off,
when you finally receive an upgrade, which should fix all the known bugs,
but instead introduces new bugs and isn't compatible with the old
save-files.

I'm playing Frontier on the PC, but as this appears to be the main forum
for Frontier I'll say this here.  I completely agree. I have been seriously
considering writing a letter to Gametek, who distibute it, but a better idea
has occurred to me.  There have been enough reports of bugs and general
dissatisfaction with the game that I wonder if we would get a better response
if a bug/moan list was submitted by a whole load of their customers (that
is what we are, after all).

Whadda ya think?

Version 1.00, needless to say. I've heard 1.01 and 1.02 correct a couple
of things, like the bulletin board bug, but I don't know about the more
egregious bugs and misfeatures.

>I'd really like too get this game, but I'm torn between getting it

Right now, I honestly couldn't tell you which is the better option.
There's a quite excellent game inside that box, but you need to be
_very_ patient and forgiving to enjoy it. I had a lot of goodwill
towards Frontier and, despite my moaning and kvetching, I've enjoyed
playing it and seeing the universe. Your mileage may vary.

If you _do_ buy it right now, you'd probably get 1.01 or 1.02, which are
improvements at least. It might be worth waiting a couple of days to see
if any news comes down the wire about when patches or a completely
repaired version might be released.

Which version of Frontier are you using?  I've heard people talking
about 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2.  Does version 1.2 still contain all the bugs
I've heard discussed in this group?

I'd really like too get this game, but I'm torn between getting it
now, and waiting for a less buggy version.

The best way ive found is:

Land at the base and take off 5 mins before they are supposed to. the almost
always show up then.
Wait till they are more than 10000m away from the station, then blast
them. If they hyperspace then follow them.
Alternativly if they havnt got any shields and you have (say 10 - 30) ram 
them as soon as they take off !!!

Works for me .

Wow! I didn't know Frontier tracked your position right down to subatomic
distances. I think you might have to be a bit further from the space
station than that, maybe 0.5 AU (== Astronomical Unit, the distance
between earth and the sun).

Sorry for being so pedantic, but I couldn't resist. :-)

That close? :)

An Angstrom unit is 1/10000000000 metres! AU in frontier presumably
refers to astronomical unit, which is the distance from the earth to
the sun (~93,000,000 miles).

Thanks to xwebster for some of this info :)

Couldn't you tell your friends to program a true AGA demo on their spare
time? That would really help to advertise the new Amigas I think, which
also would help Team17 (or Digital Illusions) in the long run.

This may sound like a stupid question, but are you in an imperial system?

The main imperial systems, such as Achenar, and the naval base nearby always
seem to have lots of them around.

Ha! But have you been running Elite (the original) on your 1200? That's the
poster's question.

Hello? Frontier is Elite 2. The original question was about Elite..ie
the old game(about 4 yrs i think on Amiga)

  Or at least I want to have some bugs for it. Being a PC owner (BTW: I come in peace), I was rather frustrated when my computer crashed a few times so I phone Gametek (UK) and they suggested I might want to send them a list of bugs.
  That's really what I'm asking for is a list of bugs. If they feel that there are so many that it requires a new version then they might just implement it.
  Please send as much info as possible about the circumstances so it makes it easier for the company to repeat the problem.
  I'm not sure if it's the same company doing the Amiga version. If it is then I'm happy to take Amiga specific bugs and pass them on to.

  Please send them to:

  rdb@uk.ac.nott.cs
or
  rdb@cs.nott.ac.uk

  depending of course where U R.

  Thanx.

Well, a friend of mine just bought the Amiga version, and we looked
through for the version string: V1.05! This is the highest version I
have heard of yet.

I took a copy (to upgrade my *purchased* V1.00 -- perfectly legal in
my book). As far as I can tell, there is little difference. I have
noticed the following things:

    Beta Lyrae bug : Still in there. Not surprising as I was the first
                     one to report it here, and maybe David hasn't got
                     the news / fixed it yet. :-(
    Wormhole bug   : Still in there.
    Bulletin bug   : Still in there. This surprised me. It should be a
                     trivial fix -- make sure the 'top' pointer / counter
                     is reset on docking.
    Colour flashing: Seems to have been improved / tweaked slightly. The
                     space clouds no longer flash to dark as much, but they
                     occasionally flash to a lighter colour now. :-)
    Relative-to bug: You know -- the autopilot staying rel. to a star,
                     resulting in overshoot of the planet / space-station.
                     This one seems to have been improved. It happens
                     less often, though it still does.

Also, there is no sign of space aliens / thargoids / Fer-de-lance cruisers /
black holes / other galaxies / cloud cities / more interesting missions, but
then that's not very likely anyway.

IMHO, David Braben is probably sunning himself on a beach in Hawaii right
now (if he isn't, he deserves to be) and letting somebody else fix all the
little bugs.

Shades of Nethack come to mind.   Another big, long awaited game.  Pretty
buggy for the first two releases (3.1.0 - 3.1.2)  3.1.3 is pretty
stable and much nicer to look at than the MS-DOS port.

The save game files changed, also the bone levels between 3.1.0 and 3.1.3.
A lot of people refused to play the new version until they finished the
older 3.1.0 version as they would lose their save games and bones.

For you guys who have slow machines - try increasing the priority
of Frontier. You should be able to make it a little faster, since it then
will 'compete' more efficiently for CPU clockcycles. To do that, just set
the TOOLPRI tooltype to a largish value. I set it to 5 (TOOLPRI=5) and it
_SEEMED_ faster afterwards.

Yeah, I ran into one of those...errm, well equipped guys too. I think they

wasted by ONE shot! Too bad the really challenging cases are so far between;
mostly one just has to wade through countless hordes of mosquitoes... Which
brings me to the reason for my post:

1) Does anyone know if ships killed by ramming counts as a kill? I've started
to wonder; it seems I've been 'competent' for ages, and since I cant be
bothered to target the eagles and other minor pests, I simply ram them.
Perhaps killing by ramming doesn't count?

I've been there, and the game does indeed freeze when I try to hyperspace
to Beta Lyrae. Add another bug to the list.

If this is true then i think we can safely go to another galaxy cant we ??

Also...i heard 'from a certain magazine' that the thargoids had pissed off to
another galaxy.....anyone managed to get to another galaxy yet????

Also...does resource work to de-compile frontier (HEY!i bought the original...
i OWN the code as well.....imo :) ... as i am thinking off finding the value
of the board when it is at the top....make a note of it...and when the take-off
is activated, then i can simply reset the value .... no???

Most likely it is 665.35. That would make the most sense. This is what you get
if you leave an assembly programmer alone in a room for 8 years...
I really do hope some bug patches are coming out soon. (Of course, I want them
to do the PC-version first!) I heard it rumoured that David Braben is setting
up a team to develop Frontier. Let's hope he also hires himself an artist,
somewhere along the line. If the colour-scheme wasn't so horrible, Frontier
would look beautiful.

I'm not really annoyed by the bugs....i would like to get a deeper
game.

	I have been able to jump as little as 60 ly, and have seen it occur
about 15 times in the first 1200 ly from Sol. WHat I have discovered is that
the bug appears radially from your position. If you are at 0,0, the
bug might appear at 200,0, or maybe 198,10, or maybe 180,20, arcing
all the way around you.
	Also, when zipping through, I ALWAYS find planets which use only
2 tons of fuel. You have to check different planets. You can probably
jump the whole galaxy in 1 ton of fuel.

You can drive it to crap, this happend to my 2 times after a hyperspace

I thought I might try to sum up all bugs found in Frontier. Feel free to add
new bugs should you find one. If you do, remember to write which version of
the game you have.


BUGS I'VE ENCOUNTERED IN FRONTIER V1.00


BUG: Messed up bulletin board.

DESCRIPTION: Sometimes the bulletin board will contain the Stockmarket list
      or Shipyards list instead of the usual messages. Apparently this
      is due to an overflow when the last list you looked at was longer
      than the bulletin board message list.

FIX: Always scroll to topmost message/item in any list before going to
     other spaceport OR fast forward to next day.

---

BUG: The Wormhole Bug.

DESCRIPTION: Using the map and SHIFT/ARROWing away from your current system,
             you will occasionally get 'FUEL NEEDED XX TONS' instead of the
             correct 'OUT OF RANGE', and due to this, you can hyperspace
             across the entire galaxy with a single jump. It seems the
             places you can jump to are placed at certain fixed intervals
             from your starting position.

FIX: Don't use it.

---

BUG: Autopilot stops on a dime.

DESCRIPTION: When you're heading towards a target, you can accelerate
             manually to very high speeds, and when you're very close to
             the target enable the autopilot. Defying the laws of nature,
             the autopilot will bring you to an immediate halt.

FIX: Don't use it.

---

BUG: Autopilot crashes.

DESCRIPTION: If you let the autopilot dock your ship at normal speed, it
             will frequently crash the ship by hitting the surface/station.
             The same is true if you let the autopilot fly you from one
             spaceport to another on the same planet.

FIX: Use accelerated time when docking or moving between spaceports.

---

BUG: The Beta Lyrae bug.

DESCRIPTION: Hyperspacing into the Beta Lyrae system (-146,85) hangs the
             computer. I've tested different kickstarts and ships, but the
             result is always the same - which is a shame since it is one
             of the most interesting systems in the game. A saved game with
             a ship within jumping distance of Beta Lyrae is available.

FIX: None known.

---

BUG: Sometimes impossible to take off from pressurized spaceports.

DESCRIPTION: Sometimes when you're trying to take off from a spaceport on
             a planet without air, you will not be able to gain height.
             This MIGHT not be a bug, since there might be a number of
             reasons why you can't take off, but I do know that sometimes
             you cannot take off normally even with lots of fuel in the
             tank.

FIX: Various, ranging from the brutal (get 99 shields and drive
     through the wall) to the hopeful (use accelerated time OR pull up
     the nose hard while giving thrust).

---

BUG: Missiles can be fired from within stations.

DESCRIPTION: One can lock onto targets using the map, and then fire ones
             missiles although one is docked. Since all other weapons are
             disabled when docked, this is probably a bug.

FIX: Don't.

---

BUG: One enemy at the time.

DESCRIPTION: You will NEVER get more than one enemy at a time if you're
             travelling with the highest time acceleration.

FIX: I don't know. I've only once met more than one enemy at the same time,
     and I honestly don't know how I did it. Possibly if you use no/low
     accelerated time? Possibly not a bug.

---

BUG: The Exit bug.

DESCRIPTION: Pressing EXIT doesn't return you to Workbench, it just returns
             you to the intro animation.

FIX: A patch has been posted to usenet by Teemu Suikki (not connected to
     the original programmers of Frontier AFAIK). It enables exiting
     to workbench by pressing X.

---

BUG: The Multi Galaxy bug.

DESCRIPTION: If you zoom out long enough in the Galactic map, you will see
             many galaxies in a neat grid. Patiently moving the target
             cursor into one of these galaxies reveals that they're really
             our own galaxy.

FIX: None known.

---

BUG: Systems with Import&Export - but no planets and no ports.

DESCRIPTION: Sometimes info on a system will show that it has import and
             export even though there's no planets or ports in the system.
             I've only seen it in binary, tertiary and so on systems.

---

That about wraps it up for bugs I've encountered personally. More bugs have
been reported though.

BUGS I'VE NOT SEEN PERSONALLY:


BUG: Turrets firing at self.

DESCRIPTION: Turret mounted lasers/plasmas can fire on ones own ship.

FIX: Don't use turrets.

---

BUG: Negative value on precious metals.

DESCRIPTION: In one system, I believe it's Cemiess, precious metals cost
             -1500cr. This means you are PAID to take them off their hands.
             Mind you, this might not be a bug.

FIX: Don't trade in precious metals on Cemiess.

---

BUG: Getting paid when selling ship - and keeping the ship.

DESCRIPTION: If you've got a passenger in your ship, you cannot sell the
             ship. However, you will still get _money_ if you trade in an
             expensive ship for a cheap one, meaning that you can sell your
             ship as many times as you wish and still have it.

FIX: Don't. Probably the most boring way there is to get rich.

---

BUG: Missions to systems without a spaceport or station.

DESCRIPTION: When running errands for the Military/Navy, one will sometimes
             be asked to carry objects to systems which does not have a
             spaceport or spacestation, making it impossible to complete
             the mission.

FIX: None known.

There I was floating in space, 10.564 AU from the planet with a spaceport. My
left truster was damaged, but still I hoped that my Panther Clipper would do the
job. I set the autopilot on and watched. And watched. I set on the
time-accelerator and waited. Three months passed and atlest 30 pirate ships had
been blown to pieces and I wasnt even half-way. The Clipper moves at the speed of 
a Voyager droid. I patiently wait three more months. My crew is got restless and 
very bored, the video-library is getting exhausted of unseen films. Not to forget 
the brain-dance experiences. Then finally we get under 1 AU from the planet. And 
what happens? We miss the bloody planet with about 600.000 kilometers!!!! The 
Clipper has been reduced from a high-tech war-machine to a meteroite in a 
parabellum orbit!

My navigation computer quickly computes that we are in a decreasing orbit around 
Gold. Hooray! But it will take some 1.2 million years. 

Guess my crew will get quite unhappy about the situation when (if) I tell them.
Damned that the rescue pod doesnt work.

I thought I'd try to compile a list of all the features I feel are missing
or badly implemented in Frontier. Feel free to add your own.


--------------- THE OPPOSITION --------------------

*SMARTER ENEMIES!

The enemies have the intellect of termites! It's pure dumb luck should they
ever hit you, and if they have a chance, they'll crash into eachother, you, or
unfortunate nearby planets. I can understand that behaviour from large, well
shielded ships - but from _Fighters_???


*BADDER ENEMIES!

Even though there ARE a few pretty tough cookies out there, the vast majority
are small one-man fighters with pulse lasers. After a while, it just gets
boring running over them (I can't even be bothered to target them anymore; I
just let them crash me).


*MORE ENEMIES!

One only encounters the enemies one by one. None of them's good enough to
put up a fight against a well equipped large ship by their own.


*THARGOIDS!

WHERE ARE THE THARGOIDS?!? This ancient, evil, insectoid race were the only
ones who could give you a run for the money in Elite - surely the Federal
Navy hasn't defeated them? Imagine fleets of Thargoid battleships and cruisers 
attacking
the human space, imagine leading a division of warships against them..!


*FLEETS!

If there's to be no Thargoids, atleast the Empire and the Federation should
battle it out somewhere. Frontier needs some real large-scale mayhem!


*TOUGHER POLICE!

The police in Frontier is pitiful - they're far more likely to hurt eachother
than any wrong-doers. Install shields on all Viper policeships, and remove the
blindfold the pilots (seems) to have. Yesterday I watched 20+ policeships fail
to lauch out of a spacestation - not a single one made it into open space. I
didn't fire a shot, and I didn't get a scratch.



-------------- GENERAL STUFF ---------------------

*MISSIONS!

Frontier needs Elite-style missions to keep the player interested.


*BETTER MINES AND MISSILES!

They are utterly useless as it is. Couldn't hit the broadside of a
planet.


*FIND: FUNCTION!

It can be a real pain to find the system you want to go to. How about a FIND
command like the one in Elite?


*LESS POWERFUL WEAPONS AND DEFENCES _OR_ BETTER EQUIPPED ENEMIES!

Buy a largish ship. Put a lot of shields and a big gun in - and presto,
you are now invulnerable. You can equip yourself to the point where
you can *drive* through all opposition, including space stations.


*ALIENS!

Why not scatter a few alien empires throughout the galaxy? It's big enough.


*EXPLORATION!

There's untold numbers of 'unexplored, no data available' systems in the
Milky Way. Why not let the player explore systems, optionally even naming
the planets? And, offcourse, there should always be the possibility to find
something, like an alien race with strange new technology. Even if there
would only be something interesting on one out of every thousand planets, it
would still give the game great staying power.


*LONG RANGE BATTLE!

It should be possible to zoom the normal view, and atleast some lasers should
be able to hit targets much further away than 8km.


*THE LONG RANGE CRUISERS AND LYNXES SHOULD BE TOUGHER AND EXPLODE BETTER!
Taking out a long range cruiser is easy, and produces a pitiful explosion
and no cargo. Why not white-out the screen when it explodes, and have
hundreds of tonnes of cargo scatter about. Offcourse, they should have many
shields, heavy artillery and a few defending fighters aswell.


*BETTER SOUND!

The quality of the samples in the music is poor.


*FIX THE BUGS!!!




I still love the game, though. Too bad it wasn't ready when it was released.

I had a game on the C64 that I bought from someone and played quite a bit
before I broke it, or something happened.  I am wondering if it was Elite I.
:)
 
It was 3D graphics, I mostly remember roaming over a planet's surface
telelporting in objects from the surface.  (Sometimes mines or bombs,
that was nice.)  Usually keys or something.  And I remember there being
buildings on the surface, and an orbiting space station.  When you entered
the space station, you got some kind of menu..
 
I don't remember ever leaving the planet.  Or encountering very many
enemies.
 
It came with a "headset" that when you made about any noise it pushed
the joystick button for firing.  That quickly was shed for the space
bar.
 
Was this Elite I?  If not, what was it?
 
Thanks.. :)

What  about  the  Constrictor, 22/10 g acceleration?  With Military-3 drive
you  get your 15ly.  With hyp.analyser, 2 shields, weapon, radar mapper and
stuff  like this you still have about 30t available for fuel only.  You can
do 3-4 large jumps without landing.

I tried most of the ships, and still think Constrictor is best.

I  once  got a message saying something like "We're sorry annoying you, but
the  person  was  not  on  board while you destroyed the target".  I wasn't
early, everything seemed fine, but I didn't get payed.

I  never land and wait on the port the target is supposed to show up.  As I
did  I  often  had  trouble, the target did not arrive and stuff like that,
this  happened  30%  of all cases.  Now it's far better, I can complete the
missions  90%.   I  *think*  maybe on a small starport I'm occupying one of
very  few  landing  bays  and the target cannot land, which means it cannot
lift off at the time specified.


BTW:   Sometimes  you can kill the enemy even if you come too late.  If you
arrive,  fastforward  time until the ship lifts off, then target it on your
map.   Use  the radar mapper to identify it.  Then wait for the description
vanish,  then  activate the hyperspace-analyser.  This works 80%, even when
you're still 10AU's away from the starport.

I believe the game your thinking of is Echelon.  It was pretty awesome for an
8 bit game, but I liked Elite better.

   Hey, that sounds like Echelon! I also used to have it - it had an 
  eerie resemblance with Mercenary - but presumably not Elite. The 
  story in that game was something like, that a new planet was found
  in our solar system, orbiting far away outside the Pluto's orbit.
  After the first expedition there, it was discovered that an ancient
  civilization had lived there a long time ago. Your job was to explore
  the planet, AND beat the space pirates, who had taken over the place.

>I don't remember ever leaving the planet.  Or encountering very many
>enemies.

   Actually, it was possible to adjust the frequency the enemies attacked
  you. At minimum, NO enemy attacked you, so you could fully focus on 
  exploration.

>It came with a "headset" that when you made about any noise it pushed
>the joystick button for firing.  That quickly was shed for the space

   Er, isn't that an Access LipStick? I remember that the lipstick 
  actually understood words, so that if you said "missile", a missile
  would be fired. 

>Was this Elite I?  If not, what was it?

  As you can see, it wasn't Elite I. It was actually impossible to enter
 planets in Elite I. I'm positive that you're talking about Echelon.

>Thanks.. :)

   You're welcome! :)

I suspect that you do get kill points.  I know for certain that you
will be paid a bounty for ramming ships, so it seems reasonable to
assume that you get points for them as well.  I hope so, anyway :-)

As far as I know it's not there. :(
The nearest thing I have found, looks wise is the Boa freighter, but I ditched that
because it (a) flys like a brick, and (b) has a little bug with the bottom gun turret.

Elite (original) on a 1200? Well when I got my first 1200 back in Jan of
this year, Elite worked fine...no need for turning off caches or using
Degrader. But it had problems with the hard drive fitted that caused 
colour problems. So a few months later when I finally got a newer 1200,
I tried to play Elite.....and it refused to load!

Just recently I tried again using degrader and experimenting with the
startup options, and found that I could in fact load it simply by
turning caches off, disabling all drives except df0: and using ECS chips.

So maybe everyone has been right, and it just depends exactly when your
1200 was made?

Nope, that was Echelon--by Access Software. Never did finish that one.

Pardon me if this is stupid, but if you select a solar system you wish to jump
to, which is out of range, how do you know if the worm hole bug will take 
effect? Does it still say "out of range" but lets you jump anyway, or 
does it just say that you require some amount of fuel which is less than it
should be?

I have tried to use this bug a few times, but havent been able to get it 
to work.

In theory, yes. But:

1) It takes a LONG time (with 68020 turbo) to move the cursor into another
   galaxy. A half an hour or so. And I do know that pressing right shift
   makes it go faster, as does zooming in first.

2) Sector number is a signed 16-bit integer, and wraps around at 32768 (and
   -32767) - I have tested it! Sector [32767, 0] is at the mid-point of
   two galaxies.

3) I'm quite certain that the "other galaxies" are mirror images of the
   Milky Way.

>Also...i heard 'from a certain magazine' that the thargoids had pissed off to

I don't think that the game (= Amiga, version 1.00) has other galaxies.
