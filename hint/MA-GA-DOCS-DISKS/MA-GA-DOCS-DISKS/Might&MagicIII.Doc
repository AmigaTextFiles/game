Rygar Docs for Might And Magic III

                ---- Adventuring Mode ----


To move through the world of Might and Magic III, use the arrow
keys or the mouse pointer in the Display Window. The Up and Down
arrow keys move the party forward and backward, and the Left and
Right arrow keys turn the party left and right. Holding down the
Control key while pressing the Left or Right key side-steps the
party without turning. Wait (pass) by pressing the Space Bar.
This allows time to pass and monsters to advance. Time does not
pass when turning left or right.

Nine options appear in the Options Window of the Game Screen:

S - Shoot: Party members with equipped missile weapons fire them
	   straight ahead, provided there are no obstacles

C - Cast:  Displays the Cast Spell window. All spell casters
	   have a spell ready. To cast the readied spell select Cast again.
           To change the readied spell select Cast again. To change the
           readied spell select New. A list of all spells known by
           the selected character will appear. To the right of each spell
           is its cost in spell points and gems (i.e. 12/2 means 12 spell
           points and 2 gems). Select the desired spell and press ENTER.
           The spell is now ready to be cast.

R - Rest:  Restores the party's hit points and spell points, provided there
           is as least one food for every member of the party.
           From left to right, only the number of party members equal to
           the number party food will be restored. Some conditions worsen
           with rest and can cause a character to die. Use caution whenresting.
           Most monsters love to devour sleeping adventurers.

B - Bash:  Using the combined might of the first two conscious party members,
           attempts to knock down locked doors, grates, and thin walls that
           hide secret passages

             on the roster. At least one character must always remain in

FIXED BY [RYGAR]   ---  M & M III Clues  ----

QB: What's an effective party?

van Caneghem : Make the group as diversified as possible, with a

member of every race and as many different classes as possible.
Secondary skills are critical, so get as many as possible. You
want

someone with Danger Sense and someone with Detect Secret
Passages right away. Next you need someone with Pathfinding and
Mountaineering, for outdoor adventt@ring. Read the manual and
experiment with different characters, because some races start
out with secondary skills.

QB: How about some "jump start" clues for the opening game?

vanCaneghem:First-levelcharacters can use the Mr. Wizard option
to get out of trouble, since they don't suffer the usual penalty
that lowers each character a level. So until your characters hit
level two, you can experiment more freely.

	Finish the mini-quests in Fountain Head right away, then
go to the cave below it. For useful clues and objects, take as
many skulls as possible to the Miser. For gold, b19h the 92c72t
w1ll around the comer from the Inn (be prepared for a battle).
There's a dungeon outside the f"rst town, just a little bit
south, which is the next place to check out. The Fireball spell
is in the Temple of Moo there, in a hidden spot in the
north-central section.

	The Dragonbreath spell is another good one: it lets you
choose which element you want to breathe at the enemy. lf you
know a monster is immune to cold, cast Dragonbreath and set it
for electricity. That spell's location hasn't been decided yet,
so Iet's just make it up right now. Ok, let's put it at w1714ck h3ll.

	For temporary Hit Points that last a day or till a
battle, learn S wim (below Fountain Head), then go to the island
in the lagoon south of town. .
