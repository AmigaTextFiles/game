   Team Suzuki is the result of months of close co-operation between 
Gremlin Graphics and Team Suzuki, both of whom wanted to wanted to make 
sure that this product would be the closest thing to real bike racing 
that could ever be experienced on any computer. Whatever technical circuit
information Gremlin Graphics wanted, Team Suzuki were nore then happy to 
provide, from straightforward general technical information to videos of 
the circuits taken from a camera strapped to the side of a bike. This 
high level of exchange has allowed Gremlins Graphics to produce what we 
believe is the ultimate motorbike racing simulator, and we feel that once
you have shared the Team Suzuki experience, you will agree.

   Obviously, the aim of Team Suzuki is to be the fastest driver in the 
world, and to finish in first position over a season of sixteen races 
round various circuits chosen from some og the most exciting and challen-
ging tracks in the world. It won't be so easy, with seven other racers 
all with the same aim, but it will be an absorning and demanding challen-
ge. Reckon you're up to it?                                            
Only one way to find out ...

   Altough Team Suzuki is more of a simulation than an arcade game, the 
controls and menu systems have been designed to make your way trough the
game as straightforward as possible. As a consequence, most of the infor-
mation you will need is presented on the screen, and to chose any parti-
lar option, just move the mouse pointer over it and hit the left button.
 On loading the game, the first screen you will be faced with will offer 
you the choice of motorbike by engine size, and the choice of practice,
a single race , or a full season. The smallest bike, the 125cc, has 
The autonatic gears, and is therefor the easiest to control. The larger
bikes, as well as having manual gears, are faster, and so winning on this
bikes is much more difficult.                                          
 Practice will also make your choice straight to grid of an empty circuit,
where you will be able to familiarise yourself with the controls of the
bike. You will also make your choice of control methods on this screen. 
There are three sets of controls:                                    
                                                                       
 - Normal controls -                                                  
    As well as being able to chose from the options menu, pressing HELP
    key will toggle between the normal and alternative controls. The

    In any mode, there is an option to look over your shoulder and check

    This option is included to allow tracks other than the sixteen already
    included to be loaded in. These tracks will be made available by 
    Gremlin Graphics a later date.

    five laps each time, and is changing up by clicking on the right mouse
    button, anf down by clicking on the left.

    As you complete a lap in a race, your position will be flashed up to
    the screen as well as when you overtake an opponent.

    Team Suzuki is probably the smoothest scrolling polugon racing game 
    ever, but believe it or not, it can be smoother and faster. Here is
    how. As well as working out the position of all the polygons and them 
    drawing them to the screen, the computer has also to draw your dash-
    board sprite, then try it. Because the computer doesn't have to think
    about the d ashboard, it can spend more of oits time making the 
    ploygons smoother.                                               
    As the default option, the other bikes are left riderless in order to
    keep the game smooth and fast. Howeverm there are riders available, 
    and these can also be toggled on and off.altough the game is quite as
    smooth with riders on the other bikes, it does heighten the realism.
    Of course, wich combination you prefer to use when playing Team Suzuki
    is up to you. The keys to alter the options are as follows:       
    Toggle riders on/off: M                                           
    Toggle bike dashboard on/off: C                                      
    This options can be toggled at any oint during the game, including 
    whilst you are racing. This allows you to experiment to find the option
    with wich you are most comfrtable.

    bike can also be watched from several other points of view when in
