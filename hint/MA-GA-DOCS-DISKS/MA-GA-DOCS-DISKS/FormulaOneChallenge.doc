NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR (S.RENNOCKS)
---------------------------------

I  must  apologise  for  the rather complicated AMOS file requester that is
incorporated  in  F1C.   If  you  have any problems then read the LOAD/SAVE
instructions at hte end of this instruction manual.

Formula  One  Challenge  is  now  far more reliable than older versions and
doesn`t  run out of memory so easily,but,I still advise you save your games
every  5  or  6  races,just  in  case  of  freak  things  such  as Software
Failures/Power cuts that could wipe out your game.

MAIN INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------

When  the program has loaded and after you have gone through the options to
load  a  saved game,choosing the number of players and selecting your teams
you  get  to  the choose engine screen.Here you must choose your engine for
the current season.

ENGINE CHOICE
-------------

Do  not  overspend  here because you have other things to buy later on (i.e
tyre contract,engine power,driver(s) & pit crew skills).

You  start  with  $1,000,000,but as a general tip do not buy an engine that
costs  more  than  60%  of  the money you have.So in the first season it is
unadvisable to buy an engine more than $600,000.

MAIN MENU
---------

If  you  chose to load a previous game at the start you will arrive here on
this  screen.   The  first  thing you should check when you are here is the
weather.

Here are the options that are selectable off the main menu:-

a)CHAMPIONSHIP  :   This is a run down of both the drivers and constructors
championships.Click up & down arrows to move through lists.

b)DRIVERS  :   Here  you  can  look at the skill recordsof your drivers,the
other drivers and you can buy a new driver (or replace one).
 
On  this  screen  you can see the points,skill,racewins and polepositions a
driver has had.

The numbers by racewins,pts.  and polepostions are this seasons figures and
the numbers to the right of these are the drivers career totals.

Selecting  a  new  driver  (or  just  checking out the records of drivers).
Clicking  the  right  mouse  button will bring up a seperate screen showing
four top ten tables including top ten best pitstop times which saves to the
disk,so you should keep your disk write-enabled.

Click  the  up arrow to change your 1st driver and the down arrow to change
or  sign  up  a  second  driver.You  will  be  presented  with a list of 50
drivers.Your  current  drivers  will  be highlighted.If you click the right
mouse  button  on  the  driver  you  are  highlighting  you  will  bring up
information  on  his  career  records  ect.   (Right  mouse button again to
deselect).

You can only buy a driver that does not have a team name by his name and if
you  can  afford  him.To  choose  a driver highlight one and click the left
mouse button.To exit this screen click the left mouse button on quit.

NOTE:   The  divers  are  very  roughly  sorted  into  skill  order,so only
experience of playing the game and of following formula one races will help
you  decide whether a driver is woth signing or not.Very roughly though the
best drivers are at the top left and the worst at the bottom right.

c)RECORDS  :  Can only be selected if you have completed the first reace of
a  season.Click  on the up and down arrows to go through the results of the
race of the current season (only the top 6 finishers are recorded).

d)WEATHER  :  This tells you the tempreture and the weather conditions that
the race will begin as including a full weather forecast.

e)CARS  :   The  screen is split into two the top half for your 1st car and
the  bottom half for your 2nd car.Clicking on the small white boxes next to
the  tyres,engine  power,wing  settings,or  pit crew will take you to these
separate sections.

e)i)TYRES  :   This is the most complex concept to understand,so if you can
grasp this the game should become a lot more playable and enjoyable.

Here  is  a  approximate  selection  of  tyres  depending  upon the weather
conditions:-

			Thunderstorm 	- Rain
			Heavy Rain   	- Rain
			Rain		- Rain
			Drizzle		- Int (Intermediates)
			Overcast	- A
			Mild		- A/B
			Sunny		- B/C
			Heatwave	- C/D

You  should only use the above as a rough guide since other factors such as
the  remaining  race  distance  ect.  will play a part,only experience will
allow you to make the correct judgement under all circumstances.

Your  tyre  selection plays a huge part in the outcome of a race,so correct
selection is vital.

EXAMPLE:   The  weather  is  sunny.If you choose a C you will have a lot of
grip,but  your  tyres will wear out quite rapidly.Whereas if you choose a B
you will have less grip,but your tyres won`t wear out as quickly.

Tyre  selection depends upon the weather,the tempreture,the "twistyness" of
a track ,the total race distance and how good you are at doing pitstops.

e)ii)ENGINE  POWER  :   This  will  determine  the  power  output  of  your
engine.Each  1%  of  power will cost you $100.You are told how much you can
afford for this car and how much you can afford if you split your money for
engine power between both of your cars.

Auto-fill  up  will  increase  your engine power to 100% if you can affford
it,else  it  will go onto enter amount mode :  you enter the percentage you
want  to  increase the power by.The exact engine power is shown to the left
of the bar.

e)iii)WING  SETTING  :   For this you must examine the track diagram of the
current circuit and its statistics.You must determine hoe "twisty" (lots of
sharp corners,few straights) the track is.

			Twisty	   :  Large    (Lot of downforce)
			Average	   :  Medium   (Med. downforce)
			Straight   :  Little   (Little downforce)

e)iiii)PIT  CREW  SKILL :  This option is similar to engine power,but it is
for  the  pit  crew  skill of your whole team so this option works for both
drivers.1%  increase  costs $200.The pit crews skill determines how quickly
you will be able to complete a pitstop.

Options  i,ii  &  iii  must be chosen for both of your cars if you have two
drivers and you wish to/can afford to enter both cars.

f)LOAD/SAVE  :   This is the load/save option.The file selector is a little
confusing  to  use  if  you are not used to the AMOS file selector.To get a
list of devices you can load/save from/to click the right mouse button when
disk accessing has finished,and then select the device.

To  save under a different file name other than GAME1.FO then click next to
this and delete/add what you require.Please rememver to always keep the .FO
extension at the end,otherwise the file selector will not show the filename
when you are attempting to load it back in.

For  more detailed instructions on loading and saving please read Load/Save
documentation at the end of this instruction manual.

g)CREDITS  :  The credits screen.

g)THE  RACE  :  Only click on this when you have your car(s) set up and are
ready  to  compete.If  there is more than one player playing,this will move
onto  the  next player`s team,to allow him/her to enter their choices.After
the  final  players  choices have been made,clicking this option will go to
the qualifying session and then the race.

i)TRACK  DETAILS  :   Gives  a  rundown  of  track  details for the current
circuit,as well as the lap record holder.

QUALIFYING
----------

The cars are displayed on the screen in their qualifying positions,the taop
left  car  being  in poleposition.The grid will scroll automatically up and
down,or  you  can  continue  by clicking the left mouse button.Only 26 cars
qualify  for  each  race,so  if  your  car  is  not shown then you have not
qualified for the race.

WEATHER FORECAST
----------------

This   showsthe  current  weather  details  together  with  the  forecasted
details.Also  shown  is  the  race state i.e whether the race is a wet race
(more  thab 1/2 of cars on rain tyres),mixed race (more than 1/2 of cars on
intermediate  tyres),or  a  dry  race  (more than 1/2 of cars on dry racing
slicks).

THE RACE
--------

Click the left mouse button after seeing the track information and you will
see  the cars lined up on the grid.After a few seconds the lights will turn
green and the race will be on.

**  If after lap one you hold down the left mouse button for about a second
when the huge information scoreboard is being updated or the cars are going
past,you will be taken to the option screen.

THE OPTIONS SCREEN
------------------

Clicking  on  the  race  highlights  word  will  toggle the race highlights
on/off.With  racehighlights  on  you will not see the cars zoom past unless
one  of  the cars is retiring from the race for some reason.The car that is
retiring will travel slowly along the bottom of the track.

Near  the  top  of the options screen will be all the drivers for the human
controlled  teams that are in the race.Next to each driver are two coloured
bars.The  top  green  bar  being  tyre  wear and the lower red bar for tyre
grip.The  grip  is  the all important one,keeping the grip high is vital to
keep  your  car going at a fast rate.The closer the red bar is to the green
tyre bar the better the choice of tyres you have.

If both bars are equal then you have too soft a tyre on and your tyres will
wear out quickly.You should aim to keep the grip bar between 70% and 90% of
the  green  bar wear bar for maximum performance out of the tyres.A pitstop
should  be  considered  when your grip bar falls below 50%,unless of course
you are nearly at the end of the race and then a stop would be pointless.

Next  to  each driver is a request pitstop box.Clicking this will call that
driver into the pits.You can only bring one car per team in to the pits per
lap.(You only have one pit crew!).

SKIP  RACE  :   When selected you will return to the usual race screen with
the  scoreboard.The  cars will not go past at all.Only weather changes will
be  reported  and the positions will not be updated.The race is still being
computed  behind the scenes,but at a much faster rate,this option should be
considered  when  all  human controlled cars are out of a race.Holdind down
the left mouse button will exit from this mode.

The  current  weather conditions can be seen from the options screen and by
looking at he colour of the sky above the scoreboard.

PITSTOPS
--------

It  is  usaully advisable to make a pitstop when either the weather changes
significantly  or  just  before  half  race  race  distance.Once  you  have
requested  a  pitstop  you will be told who is coming into the pits and you
will be given a choice of tyres to fit (Rain,Int.,A`s,C`s or D`s).

After  seeing  you  car come into the pits you will see a huge picture of a
wheel.You  must  click  at  the  centre  of the wheel as quickly as you you
can.If  you  miss  the  time  will continue to tick by and you will have to
click  once  more  to  reverse  the  drill,before  clicking  in  the centre
again.The time ticks away at the bottom of the screen in seconds.

A  good  pitstop  will be about 6 seconds.You do not only lose 6 seconds in
the  pits  though,you may lose about 16 seconds for a 6 second stop,this is
due to slowing down and speeding up in the pit lane.

RACE OVER
---------

You will be told the winner of the race and the championship points will be
awarded:-

	1st - 10 pts		2nd - 6 pts		3rd - 4 pts
	4th - 3 pts		5th - 2 pts		6th - 1 pt.

After  this  you  will  be  shown the drivers and constructors championship
tables.You will return to the main menu for the next race unless the season
has been completed.

SEASON OVER
-----------

You  will  have  to get a new engine contract,tyre deal,ect.  and pick your
drivers again as before.

The  drivers are selected by each team depending on the finishing positions
in  the  constructors  championship.So the constructors champions get first
choice and so on.

PROGRAM DETAILS
---------------

This  version  of  F1C  can  be  updated each new Formula One Season with a
special updater disk (only available from us) which will update all the car
graphics,teams,driver  names,engines,circuit  details  and circuit diagrams
ect.

New  updater  disks  will  be  available  as  soon  as  the  information is
available.The  disk  will  be  available  from  around  the 30th March each
year.Contact us for details around this date each year.

Updater disks will cost around $3 each (again contact us for details).

DISK OPERATION
--------------

The program uses the standard AMOS file requester for disk operations,so if
you are used to it then you should have no problems in loading or saving to
a seperate saved games disk.

Clicking  the  right mouse button while the disk is not being accessed will
display a number a device names (i.e C:  ,Formula-One-Challenge:, L:  ect).
Clicking  on  one  of these names with the left mouse button will display a
directory of the files on that device.

SAVING
------

All  F1C saved games are saved with a ".FO" extension after the filename,so
that  you  can  easily  identify your saved games.If you forgot to add this
yourself then it will automatically be added for you.

Do  not  save on the original F1C disk,but any formatted disk that does not
contain  important  data.It  is  advisable  before you start playing F1C to
format a disk and then use this for your saved games.
(For  instructions  on  how  to  format a disk see your introduction to the
Amiga manual supplied with your computer).

After saving a F1C game,replace the original F1C disk in df0: otherwise you
may encounter problems at a later stage.

Here is a detailed guide on saving your postion in F1C:- (Yawn -Baggy)

1)Format  a  disk  for  your  saved  games  using (CLI/SHELL,workbench,or a
  formatting utility (see AmigaDos manual for more details).

2)Play F1C until you wish to save,click on LOAD/SAVE from the menu,click on
  SAVE and wait for a full list of the original F1C disk to be diplayed and
  the disk drive to stop.

3)Swap disks if necessary and insert your blank (newly formatted disk).Wait
  a couple of seconds while the disk is checked by the computer.

4)Click  the  RIGHT  mouse  button to display a list of devicces.One of the
  items in the list should be the name of your blank disk i.e Empty.

5)Click  the  LEFT  mouse  button on the name of your blank disk and wait a
  couple of seconds for a list of the files on the disk to be displayed.

6)Click  on  "Game1.FO"  at  the bottom of the requster with the left mouse
  button and enter a name for your saved game and press [RETURN].Then click
  the left mouse button on O.K and your game will be saved.

7)You will be returned to the main menu when the game has saved.

8)When  the  disk  drive  light  goes  out,swap  the disks if necessary and
  replace the original F1C disk.

LOADING
-------

You  should  load  all  saved games froma disk other than your original F1C
disk and remember that all F1C games have a ".FO" extension to the filename
so they are easily identifiable.

Loading   is   similar   to  saving,so  please  read  the  detailed  saving
instructions  above.Wehn  a list of your saved games disk files appears,you
can  click  on  the  entries  in  the  list  and  then  on  O.K to load the
corresponding  file.Use  the  drag  bar to the left of the filenames in the
list  to  scroll  through  the  list if there are more enteries than can be
displayed in the given space.

After  loading  a F1C game,replace the original F1C disk in df0:  otherwise
you may encounter problems at a later stage.

PLAYING TIPS
------------

*Dont  overspend  on  your  engine.Spend  around  60%  of your money on the
 engine.Dont  bother too much with the tyre manufacturers in your first few
 seasons (choose  the  cheapest!) and choose a driver with the rest of your
 money,leaving around 10,000 for other things.

*Learn  who  the  high  skilled  drivers are.The drivers tables are roughly
 ordered,but  experience  will  allow you to pick better drivers at bargain
 prices.

*Try  to  get  a second driver as quickly as possible,but make sure that he
 will qualify,if you are not confident that he will qualify then wait a few
 more races and get a better driver.

*Dont  be  too  eager  when  doing  pitstops,keep your finger off the mouse
 button until you are in the centre of the tyre!  Keep calm!

*If  the  weather  does  not change,and you are constantly making a pitstop
 during the race then check the grip/wear bars.Make your pitstop before half
 distance.Due  to a  lightning  fuel tyres will be more heavily used in the
 first half of the race compared with the second.

*Select  the  easist  difficulty  level  to  start with so that you can get
going.If you start doing well then select a harder difficulty level for the
next  season (can also help eo even out the teams when you are playing with
human friends).
