THE MEKA-CHICKEN THREAT
#######################

We the MEKA-CHICKENS have eggnapped Billy and his brothers to use in
our evil cloning experiments!!

P.S.  We have Floella too.

HOW TO CONTROL ALFRED
#####################

Use a joystick plugged into game port 2.

LEFT and RIGHT - As you would expect, moving the joystick left and right
                 moves Alfred left and right!

UP - Moving the joystick up while standing will make Alfred jump, the
     longer the joystick is held up the higher he will go.

     If alfred has bounced off a pring moving the joystick up will give
     him extra lift.

     When falling, moving the joystick up will make Alfred flap his wings,
     allowing him to fall at a reduced rate.

DOWN - Moving the joystick down while standing will make Alfred peck.

       If Alfred is standing in front of a doorway, moving the joystick
       down will make Alfred go through the door.

       When falling, moving the joystick down makes Alfred dive bomb.  
       This is the way to destroy the monsters but be careful, some
       monsters have a defence against it.

IN WATER - When Alfred is in the water he swims by moving the joystick
           UP to go up, DOWN to go down, LEFT to go left and RIGHT to
           go right.

IN THE MEKA-BUSTER - When Alfred is in the MEKA-BUSTER he flies by
                     moving the joystick UP to go UP, DOWN to go down
                     LEFT to go left and RIGHT to go right.

JOYSTICK BUTTON - If Alfred finds a pot of jam in the level, pressing
                  the joystick button will fire bombs.

                  When Alfred is battling with a MEKA-CHICKEN in the
                  MEKA-BUSTER, pressing the joystick button will fire
                  a large bullet.

`P' KEY - Pressing the `P' key on the keyboard at any time while 
          playing will pause the game.  Press `P' key again to
          carry on playing.

ESC KEY - Pressing the ESC key on the keyboard at any time while playing
          will quit the current game and being played.

joystick button to select the option.  If you select `RE-TRY' then

takes one credit away.

TO COMPLETE THE MISSION
#######################

BALLOONS

Alfred must find and release all the balloons on each level.  The last
one will take him to Mr Pekles' space lab where he will be awarded
points and extras according to the bonuses collected.

DIAMONDS

Diamonds and Floella's favorite.  Collect them to earn extra points.
There are sixty on each level, if all are collected then Mr Pekles will
award one extra life.

DOORWAYS

Connecting the rooms on each level are doors.  Some lead to secret rooms
so try them all!

BUTTONS

Buttons, when pushed will turn certain blocks on or off thus giving 
Alfred access to other parts of the level.

BONUSES

On each level there are bonuses to collect.  One extra life is awarded by
Mr Pekles for every hundred collected.  Look out for the following:

MR PEKLES SPACE LAB

This is where Mr Pekles awards Alfred for his bravery.

ON/OFF BLOCKS

Alfred can affect some things in the game by pecking these blocks.

SPRINGS

Alfred can use the springs to reach high or normally inaccessible places.
When Alfred jumps onto a spring it will automatically bounce him into
the air, unless he floats onto it gently by flapping his wings.  If you
move the joystick up while Alfred is ascending then he will go further
up.

ICE

Alfred can peck through the ice, or alternatively he can dive bomb
through it which is much faster.

MR PERSONALITY

Alfred can peck the On/Off block to turn the TV set on and get
Mr Personality to speak.  He can then ride on the BLAHs.

HELPFUL OBJECTS
###############

WATERING CAN

There is one in each of the worlds.  Some are very well hidden so look
hard.  Mr Pekles will award one extra life for every can found.

CAN O' WORMS

When collected, this gives Alfred a worm that spins around him killing
monsters and breaking through ice-blocks.

EGG CUP

When collected this gives on extra life.

PRESENT

When collected this makes Alfred invincible for a short while.

POP CAN

Alfred can use this as a platform.  These can withstand the Terrasawus
for a short while.

LOG

Use this to slow down the Terrasawus.

CLOCK

When collected this gives 150 extra time units.

BONUS GAME & GAME SCREEN
########################

BONUS GAME

After completing a level or defeating a MEKA-CHICKEN Alfred will fly up
to Mr Pekles space lab.  On his way he will encounter lots of floating
presents; he will get 50 points for each one he collects.  If all the
presents are collected then Mr Pekles will award one extra life.

GAME SCREEN

Some very important information appears at the bottom of the game 
screen which may help Alfred.

1.  Score
2.  Number of balloons left to collect
3.  Bonus time remaining
4.  Number of diamonds remaining
5.  Number of Alfreds remaining

THE ENEMY CHARACTERS
####################

Here are some of the enemy characters Alfred will encounter, but
watch out - there are many more waiting to hinder the mission!

MINO THE WHALE

This engine propelled monster is found underwater.  If Alfred comes
into conect he will meet a watery demise.

ALICE LADYBIRD

When Alfred dive bombs Alice she will spin upside down for a short
while.  At this point if Alfred pecks her she will bounce across
the screen, or if he dive bombs her again then he will be bounced
into the air.

MAG-MINE

The Mag-Mine can be activated and de-activated by pecking the On/Off
block.  When active it is attracted to ALfred, the only time Alfred
can touch the Mag-Mine is in a dive bomb which will bounce him up
into the air.  Using this Alfred can get to places which are 
normally inaccessible.

BYRON SNAIL

He looks harmless enough but if Alfred touches him he will prove 
himself to be deadly.

JACK-IN-A-BOMB

Jack fires bombs out of his mouth.  When shot he will hide in his
box; Alfred can then stand on the box ready to be sprung into the
air when Jack re-appears.

WALL OF DEATH

The wall of death descends from the ceiling.  If Alfred is trapped
underneath he will be crushed.  The direction of the wall can be
reversed by pecking the On/Off block.

CONTROL MINE

The control mine is controlled by the control block, depending on 
the direction the arrow is pointing.  The control mine is the only 
thing that can break through the grim blocker.

GRIM BLOCKER

The Grim Blocker is normally found blocking Alfreds' path.

CONTROL BLOCK

If Alfred pecks the control it will change into an arrow.  If pecked
again the arrows direction will change in a clockwise or anti
clockwise direction depending on which side Alfred is standing.

THE TERRASAWUS

The Terrasawus buzzes its way through the level, if it touches Alfred
then it's goodbye!

THE EVIL MEKA-CHICKENS
######################

They designed and built all the obstacles to try and stop Alfred from
ever rescuing Billy and his brothers.  Alfred must fight and defeat
all of the MEKA-CHICKENS before his mission is complete.

When Alfred comes across a MEKA-CHICKEN he will fly in his MEKA-BUSTER
ship which fires large bullets.  They only have one weak point so find
it and blast away!

MR PEKLES' HINTS AND TIPS
#########################

MR PEKLES' SECRET ROOM

On each level, if you look hard enough, you will find a door to my
secret room.  When inside, if you answer the telephone i will give
you a pot of jam!

POT OF JAM

This special jam pot (strawberry - your favorite!) will enable you to
fire bombs at the monsters.  The bombs can also be used to help find
secret blocks, collect bonuses, shoot control blocks and activate
or de-activate On/Off blocks!

MOVING PLATFORMS

Some platforms follow paths around the map.  You can spot these by the
dotted line showing their path!

MORE SECRETS

There are loads of secret and hidden parts to your mission.  Things that
can be triggered by shooting them, invisible springs that appear when
landed on, walls that can be walked through and lots more!
