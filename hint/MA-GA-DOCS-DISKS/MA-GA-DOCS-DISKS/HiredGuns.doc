                                 GUNS FOR HIRE
                                 =============

 Numerous events have led upto this point.From the time he was released from
 military service-five years and an entire star system away-Rorian Deevergh has
 amassed a group of people,some of whom he can even call friends,who are
 collectivly hunted by the authorities.  And in a world where all transactions
 are relayed to a central authority which automatically logs and ID's everthing
 from the purchase of a fuel stick to the destruction of a planetary system,
 that can create problems.
   As for Rorian's gang of fugitives, they found just one way around the problem.
 Killing for a price and without recourse was a job in which they all excelled
 and one that allowed them to retain at least a comfortable style of living.
 Payment in rare metals, No questions.  If you live, that's your business.
   On the surface, this was just a normal job.  The patron funding the current
 operation will probably remain un-known, but the mission brief suggested that
 this particular mission would be a piece of cake.  The political implications
 of the mission were glossed over-they were motivated by money, not politics.
 The payment, half up front, half on completion, was regular.  Nothing seemed
 out of the ordinary.
   The only thing that aroused curiosity was the destination.  A back water
 planet called Graveyard.  The name aroused some faint disturbance in Rorian's
 memory.  But what the hell,so did most names he heard nowadays.

                   attack immediately upon contact with crew.
                   Tesseract Battle Systems excel in simulating lethal close
                   combat theatres.  We are fortunate to have a varied
                   selection to sample.  Each theatre is designed for a
                   specific number of players.
                   Single player scenario's generally require the four
                   characters to work together.
                   Two player scenario's are designed for two opposing teams of
                   two.
                   Three and Four player scenario's are designed for free for
                   all missions.Although any scenario can be played with any

                            NEW GAMES PROCEDURES
                           ======================

   NUMBER OF PLAYERS :
   -------------------
   Hired Guns has been painstakingly developed to allow four players to enter
 Graveyard simultaneously using the same machine.  A number of player interfaces
 are available to facillitate this and are listed in the Character Control
 manual.  Select by pressing the appropriate  F  key.

   CHARACTER SELECTION :
   ---------------------
   The character selection screen allows you to select four characters from the
 existing database of 12.  At the top of the screen is a visual impression of
 the character.  To the bottom left is a character description and to the bottom
 right are four character selection boxes.
   Choose your character by using the cursor keys.  Use the left/right keys to
 scroll the character's across the screen.  To view a character's credentials,
 move a character to the left of the screen where it will become highlighted.
 Once a character is highlighted, his/her credentials will be displayed
 beneath.  Further character details are to be found in the section 'countdown
 to Graveyard'.
   To select a character, first highlight the required character and press
 RETURN to enter the character into the character selection box.  Repeat the
 procedure three futher times to create the full mercenary crew.
   NOTE : You must use the full complement of four characters each time Hirefd
 Guns is played ( unless a character has been killed in combat ).
   You may use the DEL key at any time to de-select the last character.  Once
 the full complement has been selected, press RETURN to view the mission
 progress map.

                      HIRED GUNS,THE GAME, THE CAMPAIGN.
                      ==================================


   MISSION OBJECTIVE :
   -------------------
   Mission dossier to be presented to mercenary team during planetfall, 15
 minutes before dropship touchdown.

   PRIMARY OBJECTIVE :
   -------------------
   TERMINATE PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF illegally bio-engineered ORGANISIMS
 ON SURFACE OF luyten L-7896 3.1( Graveyard ).
   Terminate existence of distribution point ( and it's surrounding enclave ).
   Target : Graveyard Central Spaceport.( lat 3.99 ign 43.22 ) this point and
 it's surrounding installations are fortified and heavily guarded.
   Method of termination :FUSION INDUCED THERMONUCLEAR EXPLOSION.
   Locate and recover four fusion power core rings from shielded storage at....

   1).  Fusion reactor plant. ( lat 2.45  ign 39.19 )
   2).  Satelite uplink tower.( lat 5.00  ign 40.73 )
   3).  Laboratory. ( lat-1.21  ign 42.61 )
   4).  Operations centre. ( lat -0.82  ign 43.47 ).

   Insert these devices into corresponding field coil generator at target site,
 detonation will be automatic after evacuating the site.
   Mission duration : 13 LOCAL days + 4 Hrs.
   Team extraction impossible after mission time expires.
   Ground Support : NONE !
   Air Support : NONE !
   Orbital Support : NONE !

   SECONDARY OBJECTIVE :
   ---------------------
   Reconnnoitre ground installationsindicated on D.T.S.  This information will
 be used for future ground based clean-up operations.
 WARNING.  The majority of ground installations are overrun with mutated
 bio-engineered organisims, proceed with extreme caution.  Note estimated threat
 level provided by master Digital Terrain Scanner.  Terminate hostiles with
 extreme predudice.  All available fire-power WILL be required.
 The following section provides all the necessary gameplay information to
 successfully complete the Graveyard mission.  Training missions and single
 action missions are covered in more depth to the end of this document.  The
 only thing which cannot be provided is the ingenuity and re-flexes of the
 participants.

   MISSION PROGRESS MAP :
   ----------------------
   Guild VII - lo den. 459vfn
   I.R. Penetration 7.
   The progress of your mission can be monitored on this screen.  View the
 extent of the terrain by using the cursor keys to move the cross vector point
 around the map.  Doing so will allow you to see the area surrounding all
 mission complexes.
 On the map you will see a number of circled area's linked by lines.  The
 circles surround identified complexes - any of which may house the hostages.
 The lines indicate route's of (relative) safe passage between them.  From this
 map, you may see your possible routes from each complex and will be able to
 determine exploration strategies.  You will also be given specific information
 about each complex as the vector point passes over it.
  This information panel offers vital information as to the current mission
 status of the area :
		Lat. Lgn. Alt - Displays Latitude, Longitude and Altitude of area.
		Area has not been comprimised - Uninvestigated area.
		Area compromised - Investigated and cleansed.
		Log entry - Guild VII ref, No.

   Estimated threat - From initial Guild VII electronic scanning, the threat to
 rescue forces has now been estimated.  Scale 1 is a low threat, with minimal
 enemy activity.  Scale 9 is a large threat with a high level of enemy activity.
 Your initial position will be indicated by a large flashing icon labelled DROP
 ZONE.  This position was chosen as the most suitable landing area for the drop
 ship and is the point from which your mission will begin.
   Your initial action is therefore to choose your course - not much of a
 selection at first.  Move the vector point accross to the complex to the North
 East of the drop zone using the cursor keys.  Press RETURN to order forces to
 enter that level.
   NOTE : You can only travel to zones linked to your present position with an
 isoterra clearance line for pedestrian movement.  If your party moves to an
 area that has already been compromised ( searched and explored ) you will be
 given the opportunity to futher explore it or pass through the area to a
 non-compromised zone.
   Note the red circles highlighting 6 of the zones.  As well as the dropzone,
 these mark Graveyard Central Spaceport (primary objective) and the locations
 of 4 fusion power core rings.

                                  APPENDIX 1
                                  ==========

                     EQUIPTMENT (use of / descriptions of)
                     -------------------------------------

   FIRING / USING EQUIPMENT.
   -------------------------
   The following section outlines exactly how some pieces of in-game equipment
 can be used.  The descriptions used on the following pages refer to the MOUSE 1
 method of control.  If JOYSTICK, JOYPAD or KEYBOARD controls are used, refer to
 the Control Options Screen for the equivalent use commands.
   Hired Guns contains over 110 different items, what follows is a brief
 overview of the main categories of item you may find.

   GUNS/RIFLES/MACHINE GUNS/
   FLAMERS/ROCKET LAUNCHERS.
   -------------------------
   Providing a character is currently carrying a weapon with ammunition, centre
 the cursor and press the left mouse to fire ( or equivalent fire option ).  If
 firing only results in a single click, the weapon is out of ammunition.
 Pressing the right mouse button will re-load the weapon providing spare
 ammunition is being carried by the character.

   RE-LOADING :
   ------------
   Each magazine loaded into a weapon will eventually run out.  When this
 happens you will normally hear a click and the weapon will not fire.  To
 Re-load, simply press the right mouse button ( or equiualent ) and the weapon
 will once again be ready for action ( provided spare ammo is available in the
 character's inventory ).  Look at the information screen available on the store
 panel for compatible types ammunitions types for a gun.
   See also relevant instruction in Character Control Manual.

   RE-FILLS/AMMUNITION :
   ---------------------
  These essential items are to be found throughout Graveyard.  Once a
 mercenary has an item of ammunition in his possetion it is ready to be loaded
 into the appropriate weapon.

  GRENADES/GRENADE LAUNCHER :
  ---------------------------
   Grenades are used to obliterate enemies when the odds faced by a character
 are great.  Grenades must be used with extreme care because they have a
 substantial spread of destruction.  If they are used in an enclosed space, the
 grenade-throwing character has a considerable chance of destroying himself, not
 just the enemy target.  Therefore, a grenade launcher, which can propel the
 grenade away from the character provides a better method of delivering the
 charge.  However, even at long-range, the blast will most likely hit the
 player.
   To use a grenade, select a cluster of grenades and fire in the same way all
 other objects are used.  The fire cursor allows a character to hurl a grenade
 one of four distances.  These distances are illustrated below.
   The top cursor form allows a character to throw a grenade a short distance.
 to attain this, move the cursor towards the bottom of the screen.
   The bottom filled cursor instructs the mercenary to hurl the grenade a long
 distance and can be attained by moving the cursor towards the top of the
 screen.
   Using mouse 1, centre the pointer and press fire.  To use a grenade
 launcher, hold the launcher and fire.

   SONIC STUNNER/1,3,6
   KILOJOULE CELLS :
   -------------------
   The stunner provides an effective close range clean method of destruction.
 It is less potent than many weapons and a character may need to be a little
 more active on the trigger.  The stunner uses electric cells as a power
 source.  A 1 kilojoule unicell will provide enough power for around 50 stuns.
 A 6 K.joule cell will provide 6 times the number of stuns rather than a stun of
 6 times the power.

   MEDI/DROID REPAIR KITS :
   ------------------------
   Carry the object and use the kit to repair damage to either humans or droids
 by pressing the left mouse button in the same manner as firing a weapon.  Each
 kit will repair a substantial amount of damage to any appropriate character and
 may only be used once.

   AUTO SENTRY KIT :
   -----------------
   The auto sentry kit can be placed by a character where it will self assemble
 and provide a sentry facility for friendly forces.  Thus, it will fire upon any
 enemy but will allow friendly forces to pass unhindered.  Two models of sentry
 kit exist-unidirectional and multidirectional.  The operational difference of
 these units is crucial in order to provide effective cover for a party :
 multidirectional units are fully articulated and can face a target in any
 direction, unidirectional units cannot.
   To use the sentry kit, place it in a clear area in front of a player.

   PROXIMITY MINE :
   ----------------
   When primed and placed, a proximity mine will detonate if any character,
 friendly or unfriendly, enters the area.  The mine will usually wipe out the
 character entirely.
   To prime the mine, the mercenary must be holding it.  Change to the character
 view screen and use the mine in the same way you would with any weapon.  This
 will prime the mine, ready for action.  Next, place the mine in a clear area
 and do not re-enter the area under any circumstances.
   Intense heat will trigger an armed mine.  With this in mind,a player can use
 a flamer to clear a path through a minefield.

   FOOD/RATIONS :
   --------------
   Food can be found in many forms throughout Hired Guns.  Consuming food will
 restore a small amount of energy in humanoid characters.
   To use food, ensure a character is holding the piece of food, return to the
 character view screen and use in a similar manner to any other piece of
 equipment.

   SYRINGE ANTI-TOXIN :
   --------------------
   Cures poison wounds on humanoid characters.  Standard use method.

   KEYS/ACCESS WAFERS :
   --------------------
   Allow access to indestructable entrance panels.  If a panel is impassable or
 locked, the appropriate key or wafer must be found before it may be passed
 through.
   To use, a character will simply need to have the appropriate item in his/her
 possession.  The card/key will be automatically used when the character
 approaches the entrance panel.

   PSIONIC AMPLIFIERS :
   --------------------
   A psi-amp offers the user a variety of effects depending upon the individual
 psi-amp.  Each psi-amp may be used a number of times and a description of each
 can be found in the section 'psionic amplifier glossary'.
   To activate a psi-amp, the character must be holding the item and used in
 the usual manner described at the beginning of this section.  The effect may
 last up to 4 minutes, depending upon the psi-amp used.

   D.T.S. :
   --------
   The Digital Terrain Scanner allows the D.T.S. screen to be activated.  To
 use the D.T.S., View the section 'Amiga instructions'.


                   :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

                               IN-GAME OBSTACLES
                               =================

   ENTRANCES :
   -----------
   Entrances are often covered by sliding panels which automatically slide open
 when approached using movement sensors.  However, security requirements on
 Graveyard means that a large number of doors require security access wafers
 (or in some circumstances, keys) to gain access.
   The character will usually find the required wafer somewhere in the current
 location.  To use the wafer, the character who requires access simply needs the
 wafer in their inventory panel where it will be recognised and allow access.

   FORCE FIELDS :
   --------------
   Force fields are usefull devices for a) containing something behind
                                        b) temporarily denying access to an
                                           area where a permanent wall is not
                                           desirable.
   Force fields are used throughout Graveyard and are impassible.  They may
 however, in some instances, be de-activated.  How this can be achieved is
 dependant upon each situation.

   TELEPORT FIELDS :
   -----------------
   These look simalar to force fields.  They provide instantaneous travel to a
 fixed destination.  If the destination is blocked, the would-be traveller will
 be notified.

   PUSHABLE BLOCKS :
   -----------------
   These large metal cubes are prefabricated building blocks.  They can be used
 to build walls,block passages or fill in large gaps.  Note that they have
 frictionless traction field which allows that to be manoeuvred with only a
 light push or pull.  Also note that they still have their original mass and
 momentum, thus being extremely hazardous to all if they fall from above.

   PUSH PANELS :
   -------------
   These are usually found on a wall and can have several uses, apart from
 operating lifts.  Pushing a push panel will usually have an effect,
 somewhere !!!.
   This could be moving a hidden panel, de-activating a force field, to name
 but two although the effect may not be immediatly obvious.

   LIFTS :
   -------
   Underground locations throughout Graveyard may be accessed using lifts.  The
 lift is unlike more conventional lifts as they are purely functional - allowing
 access from any direction (unless walled-in) and alighting whenever the person
 using the lift decides.  It is thus possible to alight a lift 15 floors up and
 without a floor between them and the ground floor.
   THIS IS NOT HOWEVER RECCOMENDED !!! , but it is worth bearing in mind.
   Lifts are usually operated by using a push panel.
