The actual game flickers much less. It's only visible on planet surfaces,
especially if you've got a beacon in view. The actual game is faster than
the demo aswell, and the demo doesn't even run with the highest level of

Here's the timing of video and CPU memory accesses. The first figure is
the system clock, the next two lines indicate when the various bitplanes'
data is accessed, and the uparrows on the third indicate the times the
CPU will try and access memory.

--------

As you can see, the CPU accesses memory on every other clock cycle.  Or
tries to, anyhow - the DMA circuitry on the Amiga automatically locks
out the CPU if the video circuitry is accessing memory.  This lockout
is on a cycle-by-cycle basis, so if there is *any* video access during
a particular cycle, even if it does not use the entire cycle, the CPU
is still locked out for the entire cycle.

So, when you have four or fewer planes (two or fewer in HiRes), the CPU
has free access to CHIP RAM.  As soon as you add the fifth plane (or the
third, in HiRes), the CPU is locked out *completely* during video access,
which means all the time except during the horizontal and vertical
blank periods.  This results in a *massive* slowdown if the CPU is operating
out of CHIP RAM.  It isn't 50%, it's *much* more than that.  And that
is the reason that any game which is CPU-intensive will not operate well
if it has 32 colors - unless, of course, you have FAST RAM and the
game's operation is from that FAST RAM.  For FAST RAM, there is no
problem with contention at all, as the CPU can freely access FAST RAM,
the video can freely access CHIP RAM, and everyone is happy...

The OCS and ECS chips simply don't have the ability to handle
8 planes.  The time slots are available, but the chips can't use
them.

>Surely that means that OCS machines potentially have enough
>DMA slots to display 8 low-res plane images?

Yep - the slots are there, but the other registers needed to display
those two bitplanes don't exist.  If you were to make an ECS chipset
that would display 8 bitplanes, you would need to add two more sets
of bitplane pointer registers, modulo registers, and the like.  And
worse, you'd need to add *212* color registers. With the technology
available at the time the OCS/ECS chips were designed, this would have
been prohibitive, in both chip real estate and in cost.

Well it's not really going directly from 4 to 5 planes that kills it.. rendering an extra plane is not what slows things down, rather the DMA overhead when you have 5 bitplanes or more on a standard chipset machine.  Same thing.. (except worse) happens 
hen you go to hires screen in 4 bpls.  So the rendering cost
in actuality is MUCH higher than 25% increase.  The nice thing about AGA is
that the DMA bandwidth was increased and so this problem no longer exists...
so your processor can be going full speed, your blitter can be running
unhindered and you can still jam in lots of copper instructions per line :)

Well, basically, 4 hires == 8 lores. The OCS HAS the bandwidth for doing 8 
lores bitplanes, they *just* *didn't* *think* *it* *WORTHWHILE*!!!! Need we 
say that they were, retrospectively, fools? Or perhaps they did have a good 
reason. Whatever.

All that's lacking for doing 8 lores bitplanes is just another two DMA 
channels, and 234 color registers, and of course some internal logic.

Am I right in thinking that the Blitter isn't as badly effected by this
as the CPU??  I understood it that the Blitter lost 25% of it's DMA slots
when the fifth lo-res plane was added - am I fooling myself?!  I know this
is in my Hardware Reference Manual - unfortunately that's on the other 
side of the country from me at the moment ... :-(

On a slightly different note, do you know how the AGA handles the new
DBL modes for scan-doubling??  Specifically, am I right in thinking 
that each line is scanned from memory twice??  That would imply that
DBLPal 320x256 would use which as many DMA slots as plain old PAL 
320x256.  I understood it that the AGA simply has a "scan doubling"
bit, which when set, uses the second bitplane modulo to force the 
display to refetch the last line.  This is sort of a follow up to one
of the postings in the (thankfully now defunct) "Ideas for New Amigas"
thread...

Anyway, any info much appreciated,

Nonono... I play it with Bob Marley as background ;) gives one the 'Dark Star'

On the other side, SoM was quite fun also. Gave the game a totaly different

Oh..btw : I LOVE Frontier. It's the best action/adventure/Tactical game I know

Having just SEEN the game (did not have money with me :-((( ), I can tell

cargo capacity, and needed a crew of 9 (yes, you have to hire your crew too).
There is, however, a 100MW beam laser, which by itself weighs 100 tonnes, more
than the whole ship you start out on. I would expect you need a pretty big
vessel to carry a laser of that power.

Again, I didn't see earth (well, I flew by), but Mars was very nicely detailed.
The level of detail is higher than in any flight-sim I've seen. Have you
seen the Frontier demo? Mars has more buildings than the demo city, and the
demo doesn't run on the highest detail level.

Yes. Both day and night, and atleast the amount of clouds differ.

Dunno.

Don't think so, but my ship had a pathetic 1MW pulse laser. I couldn't
even blow up asteroids. Firing on parked ships just made them take off
and leave.

On each planet you have something like 25-30 different job offers, ranging
from 'take this little parcel to planet X' over 'reward payed for information
about person X' to 'a lot of money paid if person X was to die an untimely
death'. I couldn't accept any of them, since the contractors wanted someone
rated better than 'harmless' for the job...

 The variety of ships you can buy is very large. Just about everything
 upto a space station can be purchased. I'm not sure but I don't think
 space stations can be bought.

   Most moons and planets have mountains and (random?) craters.
   A lot of famous objects in our solar system are modelled correctly.
   Hey, I just past under the Golden Gate bridge. Other highlights are
   mount Olympus on Mars, the sulphury (sp?) color of Io etc...

   Most of the buildings are not real. I.e. try flying through the

   Ofcourse the relevant scenery IS real. As many found out when they
   bumped into a space station.

  I think they are mostly random. They include transporting documents
  for the military, parcels or people. Usually there is a time constraint.
  I.e. if you don't get there in time you don't get paid :-(

  Getting there in time can be difficult. A hyperspace jump for any ship
  with any engine will always take a week for the maximum range of that
  ship/engine configuration.

  This means that a small ship can overtake a large one during hyperspace
  jumps. Since hyperspace gas cloud analyzers are dirt cheap, you can
  determine the destination of a big transporter, when it has jumped,
  then jump after him/her and arrive there first to prepare a warm 
  welcome... :-)

The autopilot should be able to do everything. It sometimes gets confused
and doesn't manage to dock or land correctly, pounding the ship to pieces,
but when you've played a bit, you know when it might do that, and can avoid
the situations.

The combat is definitely harder, and equipping your ship is harder than in
Elite. In Elite, the Cobra could carry more things than in Frontier.

Half true - only until you get 200t or so ship, with 4MW beam laser,
naval ECM and 2-4 shield generators. After that the combat
becomes boring easy. Just aim, shoot for 3-4 secs and target is toast.

What I hate is when it warns that your ship is under attack it blocks
your scanner for few crucial seconds. To go around this is to pause
(ESC) immediately when the warning sound comes, and press 'play' after
scanner is restored but it is ANNOYING!

No it isn't. Just learn to use the F7-key. With the engines off,
you can aim much more accurately, since the ship computer isn't trying to
change the flying direction.
However, when the enemy starts shooting, return to 'manual control', so you
are much harder to hit..

I've had the opportunity to play a pirate copy of Frontier (since its not
out here yet in the UK)

It's absolutely fantastic. Smooth and detailed as hell, really really big.
The best thing about it for me is that its REAL, the galaxy you explore is
our own - and you really feel as though you are Picard boldly going etc.
Wonderful.

The only drawback is that there seems to be a bug in the autopilot which
makes you crash 50% of the time, and the policeman kicks me out after two
dockings. I'm not concerned though, because I have every intention of buying
this game next week - and I'm sure the bugs will be ironed out in the
release version (dunno where this copy came from). It's a good preview, and
has 100% convinced me to buy the game.

Until then, I'm practising on Elite I again from scratch. What a difference!

Hate to break your dream BUT: The auto-pilot 'bug' is in the Release
version, hell you are PLAYING THE RELEASE VERSION (which isn't even
cracked properly I think) - but it's no problem, just
dock to station without fast forwarding time more than double (>>) and
you almost never hit it. Now going around a planet to a destination
in the other side, that's another story. Only way around that
is to fly away from the planet for a while and then set the
course.

Also read my other posts about the bug-fest that is playing around
the Frontier code. I already have found 3-4 other minor things
(Why it says 'not enough space to install' certain item WHEN I ALREADY
HAVE ONE, it should say instead 'you have one' or 'you have one AND
you certainly don't have room for second' even if I AM fully loaded
at the moment..... just to mention one) that could be listed
as bugs or typos ...

Hmm, I've never crashed when using the autopilot at accelerated time.
(And I've done more than a hundred dockings). I'm playing on a 68000.

Well I've seen it too. I liked the texture-mapping, but it has some irritating
bugs, ie. it sometimes overlaps surfaces that should be in front of it.
And they haven't textures on everything. The Earth, Saturn and the other
planets looked just the same as in the Amiga version.

That docking computer is a real stupid bitch in 68000 Amigas, it's way
too slow, and it almost always destroys your ship, if you want to see
the operation at real time.

Here's what to do. After you have entered from hyperspace, click F2
two times. Pick the EXACT target for autopilot where to go now. So,
zoom in enough so that you can see the space station or city or what-
ever. 

(hint: shift+(double-?)clicking zoom_in icon (or F6?) rules).

Now, hit the autopilot on (F7), and use the Maximum ">>>>>" time
acceleration (SHIFT+F5). Don't do a THING until you reach the target.

* When you come close to a SPACE STATION, computer will set the time
scale to realtime ">". Hit ">>" gadget. This prevents the usual crashes
when docking.

* When you come close to a CITY/PLANET, don't do a thing. Don't use
time scale buttons. They'll make you sometimes crash - not always, 
though. 

...and suddenly, the Frontier is a pretty nice game again. :)

-Fernis, btw - I've seen the PC/486-Frontier. AWESOME!!! Texture-bitmaps
               are not slow as I had guessed. Amiga-version looks in fact

Well i finally got it here in Ohio,and to tell you the truth my
version runs just great on my A-2000HD, and at this time its 
still got the 68000. i admit the boot up screen demo is a little
choppy, but game play is smooth as silk. it might even be a 
fast in space combat. I just got it yesterday and havent gotten
very far, but running missions for others looks far more profit-
able than just trading does, at least right now. 

See ya in space

I think mr. Braben knows more about coding than most of us mere mortals.
And if someone should teach him how to code, it certainly wouldn't be
Argonaut Software (the programmers of SG II). Starglider II's graphics
were smooth because the environment used 16 bit coordinates (saves a lot
of time when multiplying and dividing). This resulted in repeating surface
features. And did you notice that you could blow up a something, fly a bit,
and it wold be back. Realistic? Nope... Argonaut programmed Birds of Prey,
one of the slowest flight sims on the Amiga. And it didn't feature curved
objects or lots of surface detail.

Right. Some people wonder why the screen update on flight sims is slower
than the update of the latest 3d demo... Non-coders fail to see that a
lot of calculation must be done before the graphics can be displayed in
a real sim, while demos usually use pre-calculated coordinates. And sims
like Frontier require _lots_ of calculation.

I'm a PC user (just nipping onto this group to read about frontier :).  I would
say that no harm has been done by creating games that required more than the
base machine, as long as the increase has been reasonable.  I don't have a
clue what levels of amiga machines are out there, but if you want the amiga
to progress in power, then more programs need to require higher specs. than

Braben made only the 8 bit Elite versions. As everyone can see from the Amiga
Elite, it's crap, not something Braben would have done.

Oh, how true those words are!  I'd have to say that one of the Amiga's
biggest problems (if not *the* biggest) is that all games cater for the
lowest common denominator.  It's like PC game writers writing *all* games
to work on an XT and if it works on the better machines, then thats a bonus.

I'm dying to see a 4000 specific game (although I doubt there will *ever*
be one, even in PD, as there isn't a market for it).

Some life will return to the Amiga scene if games designers forget about:
1) Non-AGA machines.
2) Non-Hard disk machines.

Of course, this will never happen, and I fear we will be playing Amiga 500
compatible games until the day the Amiga is no longer here.  Perhaps this
will be the very reason the Amiga will/is die/dying out.

Any comments?

Jason.

I don't know, but on my 3000, it never crashes if you use accelerated
time. But i have another problem. Have anyone noticed that sometimes the
ship doesn't launch? I mean, when you "exit" the station, the ship sometimes
just stop right at the exit (Doors open) and doesn't move. When you swith
to manual control the doors close. Has anyone else seen this?

Do you have ANY fuel in the fuel tanks? are your thrusters working?
(they can be damaged)

those are the 2 possibilities that come to my mind... I first thought
that my newly bought Cobra mk III (ages ago, I already have Imperial Trader),
was defective, it always lost it's thrusters. Reason was: no fuel
in interal tanks ... had been buying hydrogen when I had military
engine :(

so... and by the way: anyone got their Federal/Imperial ratings
over Sergeant/Sir so far, I've been completing Imperial missions
for 5-6 hrs and I'm still stuck at Sir... I sure hope I get promoted
soon...

I've noticed this too. It happens when you leave a station with lots
of bulletin board messages and you scrolled low. Now if you go to
station with very few messages the board will be screwed up.

You can avoid this by scrolling the bulletin board up before launching.

The games uses 16 color palette and changes it when it needs new colours.
Sometimes it seems to have trouble in making up its mind :)

Naah, easy to fix - just press 'fast forward' until next day (you
loose 1-4 credits! gasp!) and the bboard has been reseted. Very very
tiny problem, but annoying anyway. The auto-pilot-doesn't-know-how-
to-go-around-a-planet -bug is much more severe. Also mega-annoyances
include: 

1> no way to get crew BEFORE you buy a craft with free crew spaces - 
it's rather time consuming to collect 5+ new crew members. It's possible
but takes upto several months of game tiem.

2> Very high amount of military missions given by federation/imperium
can not be completed. Takes little time to see which ones
are possible.

3> No way to fit better drives to Imperial Transport/Couriers - sales
view claims they can use hyperdrive 7 but ... you can't remove #6 so..

4> Manual has tons of mistakes in the ship stats.

5> FAR Too easy 'random' enemies. Hardest one I've seen is Imperial
Courier which takes about 20 secs to wipe out at worst. Normal
Kraits/Cobras/Sidewinders etc take about 4-6 secs to shoot to bits
(With my 20MW beam laser of course:-)

6> After getting about 600+ ton ship, no visible way to upgrade ships,
I'm getting tired of trading, and I have 3M surplus cash at the
moment. Biggie cargo ships are not really usable in combat, so
my Imperial Trader is - only 525tons - best all-around ship
i've seen so far - only trouble is short range, only about 10.5 ly.

7> no REAL missions (those simple bulletin-board thingies get
really boring very fast) - I want something like in Elite 1, unique
missions which take a lot of work to complete. (Package claims
there is 82 missions, and my Imperial title is still only Sir so
I'm having high hopes something DOES turn out)

8> VERY hard/near impossible to go any great distances manually, I
know this is rather realistic, but still... ohwell, not so big thing.

9> Okey, the galaxy is MEGA-SUPER-HUGE, you can spend hours just
scrolling the map. but what's the point? After about 400-600 ly
from sun, refuelling points/repair stations get very scare, always
scooping fuel gets boooooring and there really isn't much to found,
or is there? I've yet to get myself to the area with 'unexplored'
systems, but considering the amount of them, I really don't
expect to find anything special. just same generated shit.

10> Only way to kill big ships is to play pirate. where are all
the big pirates? Booooring.

11> Oh WHY The music/effects are so bland and boring...?

12> Try repairing 400 tons of hull damage manually. you end up
clicking mouse 2400 times (0.25t/click)... NASTY thing, I end up
buying auto repair, going out, using it, coming in, selling it and
then rocking again. Not logical.


Don't get me wrong. The game is still MEGA MEGA good, but I belive
with little work it could have been so much better. Currently
it feels partially like a work of art, partially like a collection
of bugs. After all the waiting I Can only say it was still rushed.
*sigh* I wish they would take time to release a bug-fixed upgrade version.

(and I DO want hints how to find more, more equipment to ships, other
ship types not listed, secret missions, alien races....etc. etc.
I pray something like this could be found, there is no real
excuse why not!)

Yes. He did everything he could to preserve that Elite feeling. I think the
game could have been released two years ago, if it wasn't for all the bugs
he still had to code :-)

Well, the board was empty. If I remember correctly, the scroll arrow if
always there..

>items from stock market and the buttons beside the items did nothing.

Yes, that happens to me also. However, I think that the bulletin board is
actually empty in that situation. There once was ONE message in bulletin
board, dealing package transportation.. I took the mission, so the ad
was removed from the board. And, after that, the bulletion board started
showing those stock market items...
So, you won't miss any adverts because of the bug, since the board is empty.

The game calculates the best 16 colors for each frame. If there are many
differently coloured items on screen, some colors will flicker..

Yeah, I noticed that, too.  Also, sometimes the bulletin board will have
stock market listings on it!!  But you can't do anything with it.  Ugh.

Just accelerate time until the date changes. The time slows down
automatically as you are informed of the berthing charge and the
bulletin board is okay again.

Thank you for the information. Although this bug never bothered me too
much it is nice to know how to go around it.

given clearance by the police, who checked, absurdly, his knowledge of

informed that he was a scoundrel and was then apparently killed on the

picked the wrong letter, but I find it irritating that the game
allows you to save a position that is irretrievably illegal rather

But the game does allow one to make typo's, and lot's of them. It is
supposed that every time you answer correctly, the time you will be
asked the next question is doubled, and when you answer incorrectly,
it will take half the time for the next question to arrive on your
screen.
	I am not sure how well this works though as the manual(s) do
not say if headlines/titles are counted as lines or not. At least some
of them are as I tried not to count them a few times and Inspector (or
whateve) Braben came...:-) After that I've always counted all the
titles and sub titles and in average I have to pick my manual up every
20th or so station. Also the manual does not say if the manual
protection is case sensitive or not. I'd guess nto, so I won't bother
pressing the "shift" key...

Am I the on who has problems with Frontier? I mean, my copy has crashed,
locked up during the launch from a space station (many times) and the bulletin
board is bad (shows the stockmarket listing or too many arrows) etc.

I run it on my A3000/2+4, no z2/z3-cards...

And those "type-in-a-letter-from-the-manual" request are really starting
to get on my nerves! I think I get them every 10:th docking or something
like that!

But since it's a great game I guess I'll have to live with it.

BTW. I'm avarage, with a imperial trader (20MW beamlaser and all the
necessary equipment (ECM, laser cooler etc)). Is anyone elite yet? And,
do the federal/imperial navy mission getting more exciting? I'm only
a private and all I get to do is transport paper between the systemes. I
want to be ordered to destroy enemy cruisers or spacestations =)

I tried running it on my A1200 with and without caches, aga chipset, etc.
I also tried it on my ECS A500 with 2.04, then I tried removing the
ECS and 2.04 chips replacing then with 1.3 and OCS.

It didn't work. At various stages in the demo it either froze, crashed
or the copper list crashed. Surprisingly it got furthest on the 1200
with caches turned off.

Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong?

	Yep - set the stack higher (try 100K for good measure).  This

Well, I do believe it is available on ANY Aminet site in the game/demo 
directory.

To answer the original poster's question--set the stack HIGH (like 60000 or 
more) and it shall work. I can run the demo successfully on my A1200 w/ 
A1230XA 50Mhz 68030

Hi guys,

There has been talk about Frontier AGA, and seeing as Frontier (normal)
is now available is Australia, I'm *really* itching to buy it, but if
there is an AGA version coming, I'll hold off (I have a 4000/040).

So does anyone know for certain about Frontier AGA??!?!?!!?  Does it exist,
or is it a figment of a poster's imagnation?

See ya,
Jason.

According to many sources, Frontier AGA doesn't exist at the moment. However
Braben has expressed a large interest in doing one, especially if the
original version sells well. Since this seems likely (8-)) we will hopefully
get one. Just don't hold your breath, you will be lucky to see it by Christ-
mas in my opinion.

I know somebody who has contacts with Gametek, and he tells me that if an
AGA version is released, it will be possible to upgrade for a minimum cost.
So I think that all AGA owners should go ahead and buy it, and when you send
in your registration card, put at the bottom "I WANT AN AGA VERSION PLEASE!"
That should do the trick. ;-)

I just bought DOGFIGHT and have been trying to get it to run on my system.
But when I double-click the icon, the screen blacks out and the system hangs!

Can some of you who have gotten it to run from the hard disk give me some
hints?

I have an Amiga 2000 + CBM's A2630, A2065, flicker-fixer, and some HDs,
running AmigaOS 2.1.  I've tried eliminating all the background tasks I can
think of, and when I start it up, I usually have 700K+ of CHIP memory and
roughly 4-5 meg of fast memory.

When will I learn to stay away from MICROPROSE?!?

Well... actually, y'know... they don't sound like bugs.

You're firing off missiles and warheads and dropping mines inside a space
station. I certainly wouldn't be surprised if that resulted in a quick
and messy death, from recoiling into a wall if not from the explosions!

Just feel like reporting few more bugs from frontier. 

(nothing major, won't help you a bit, except in killing yourself!)

1> You can explode energy bomb while in station. Illogical but
doesn't really do anything. (hell you can do it with ECM to, but
it atleast doesn't display the 'disturbances')

2> You can target something in the system (nearby planet's starport,
or something similar) and see the targetting boxes INSIDE THE 
STATION. Somewhat illogical but explainable by the fact that
your onboard computer is 'creating the targetting boxes according
to the object it tracks no matter is there station walls between
you or not'. Similarily you can use radar mapper to a target
outiside the station. 

3> By using above, you can FIRE MISSILES INSIDE STATION causing
you to kill yourself pretty fast. Resulting death
sequence seems to bug a bit. Also it allows you to get about 10000km/h
backward motion caused by the missile launch INSIDE THE STATION
(the motion is what kills you, you hit something and you die)

4> With similar style you can launch mines. They only get you
fine but if you target to a ship outside first, then if you launch a mine,
you make the ship agressive - AND IT FIRES YOU WHILE YOU ARE
IN THE STATION!

5> You can launch escape pod inside station too, causing you to get killed
instantly. Again you get very messy death sequence with bugged
graphics. 

These are only minor problems and won't affect the gameplay, but 
they enforce the feeling that the Frontier has been released in a rush
(after 3+ years that feels like impossible, but it's true, too
little beta testing has been done!)

WE WANT BUGFIXED FRONTIER! THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE! 

Frontier - Partly like a work of true art, partly a nice and smelly
pile of BUGS.

Considering that the laser is disabled while in starports, they should
also be disabled. 

Also try them out - you'll find that the 3D engine bugs pretty badly
when you fire a few missiles for example.

Methinks the coder didn't think about the possibility and the
beta testing was worse than none. (You know the bulletin board bug?
I can't understand how something like that has gone thru beta
testers undetected)

IF YOU WANT TO BE CONFINED BY THE LAWS OF PHYSICS (give or take
hyperdrive) DO NOT READ ONWARDS, FOLLOWING INFORMATION MAY 
SPOIL THE FUN OUT OF FRONTIER! (BADLY)

(going to write a letter to Gametek to be forwarded to Braben
about this and few others too... this game seems to be FULL of bugs,
most harmless and just annoying, but following text uncovers
something that is NOT harmless!)

<shields up, 25 lines generated>




























<LAST WARNING, YOU ARE ABOUT TO BE SPOILED>




































There are actually two bugs. Number one:

Say a distace to a planet in local system is 20 AUs, okey, set it
to autopilot and fly towards it normally with bit of accelerated time
until both crosshairs are locked to it, so you actually are travelling
directly to that place. Then put this thing to manual control
and accelerate (With 10000x time acceleration gets things done faster)
up to the LAST possible second (say 1-2AUs from planet) and then
click autopilot. Against the laws of physics it stops your craft
from 50-100km/sec to a standstill within 1-2AU distance, clearly
impossible. You probably need fastest time acceleration for this, but
really not sure. test it out.

Number two:

Be sure you have some gas onboard and take starmap out, now start
scrolling it to somewhere with SHIFT depressed so it goes faster. Now
keep looking at 'Out of range' text, at certain intervals it turns
to 'Fuel Required: xx t' , try to stop the map at such area, and
BANG! you can jump indefinite distance with very little fuel usage. 
(then just jump with course set to some place 10000 ly away)

But didn't you get the idea? with the bug I described earlier, you can
go from one side of the galaxy to another in notime at all, and with
neglible (few tons) fuel consumption. A bug or what?

So Jarno, you think you have found some nasty bugs? Well
I have found a bug too, and this is a very bad one!
Have you ever used the Hyperspace Cloud Analyzer?
I just tried it on my own cloud, and I get a GURU :(((
I've tried it about 5 times now, with different
stack-size etc, but it gurus every time. B<
(Guru#00000003 - Address error)

I'm playing on an A500 with 0.5Mb chip and 4Mb fast
and a 14Mhz AdSpeed. Don't think I've tried to
disable the AdSpeed, but this shouldn't have caused
an address error?

I haven't tested the HCA on other clouds than my own,
since I haven't found any...

First I thought there would be REAL freedom of movement but it's
just a fake.

You can't go further than 1724.013AUs from a central star, and
the top actual speed is 203062.08 km/sec, only 2/3 of the
speed of light. I'm currently travelling at the speed
stated above away from a star, but I'm still 1724.013 AUs from it,
been for 5 minutes.

And I was hoping for relativistic effects, possibility of non-hyperdrive
travelling from a star to another. Time would go slowly even for you,
but you would see that very much time has passed during your
long voyage from everyone else's point of view.

*sigh* ... Where's Elite III, Frontier is good but not perfect.

 It's not only the time speed facility, but you would also get problems
 when one player would make a hyperspace jump and the other didn't. A
 hyperspace jump can take upto 1 week of game time (max.)

Actually, yes, it had more of a storyline. Tell me, IS there a storyline in 
Frontier? Not a flame, just interested. I remember there was a story in the 
Elite package, but it had nothing to do with the game.

One problem with storylines (even branching ones) is that it must be created 
before the game is in the shops, rather than randomly generated. Such 
efforts result in a far more interesting game, IMHO. It also means that the 
game will be more linear: once played, seen it all, etc.

But, when you've seen a couple of dozen planets in Frontier, you can say 
the same. Except that those planets were basically all the same, and not 
interesting at all.

Come on, Warhead is not that bad, nor Frontier that good.

Frontier:

- ...has a far more funky graphics engine.
- ...gives you complete freedom of movement.
- ...allows you to trade (well, if you *like* trading...)

Warhead:

- ...gives you a *great* storyline.
- ...has far nicer-looking starmaps.
- ...doesn't bother you with trading.
- ...has a really great feeling of being there. Perhaps because the colors 
aren't chosen from a palette consisting of ugly neon colors?

You have inherited an Eagle Long Range Fighter from your grandfather
Jameson (The main char in Elite), and so has all his other
descendants. Now you are free to do what you want with it.

In the Frontier package there are a booklet with some short stories,
and another booklet with info about the main systems of the (known)
galaxy.

Well in my opinion this is not a good thing, but ofcourse
we can't all have the same opinions...

Frontier is more than planets, you know...

Wouldn't hurt if each planet had a complex like in the
Mercenary games, though :-)

   Come on, Warhead is not that bad, nor Frontier that good.

AfterBurner isn't that bad either.  But in Warhead, you don't actually
have to *think* at all (it's REALLY like being in the army ;)  Only
independent thing I can recall was figuring out you had to go to the
black hole to get rid of the Berzerker...  Wow.  In Frontier, on the
other hand, you have to think just to get a game out of it.  Nothing
is defined.  Much more like real life.  See the difference?

   Frontier:

   - ...has a far more funky graphics engine.
   - ...gives you complete freedom of movement.
   - ...allows you to trade (well, if you *like* trading...)

- ...allows you to become a pirate.
- ...allows you to become a miner.
- ...allows you to travel through the galaxy looking for alien races,
as soon as you become a millionaire.
- ...doesn't FORCE you to do any of this.

   Warhead:

   - ...gives you a *great* storyline.

- ...gives you a storyline AND a path to follow.  If Frontier had
invading Sirians, you would have been able to try trading with them,
devise your own strategy if you decided to fight them, run away,
ignore them...  Kinda like you would in RL, huh?

   - ...has far nicer-looking starmaps.

Umm...  Well, the starmap in Frontier doesn't have a search facility,
but otherwise I don't see it being worse than Warhead's...

   - ...doesn't bother you with trading.

You don't HAVE to trade, do you?  That's the point of Frontier.  You
don't HAVE to do anything.

   - ...has a really great feeling of being there. Perhaps because the colors 
   aren't chosen from a palette consisting of ugly neon colors?

In your opinion.  IMO, Frontier is as good as Warhead at making you
feel "there".  Warhead was GREAT in this, but so's Frontier.

   >Oh yeah, in case anyone's interested, I found out how to run Warhead
   >on my 1200 ;)

   Boot kickstart 1.3. Runs on my a4000/30 as well.

Yeah, IF you have fastmem.  Warhead won't work on chip-only machines.
But I don't need to kick to 1.3...  Try just turning the caches off.

I bought Frontier last Friday, and have played it 12 hours a day since then..
:) 

But, I noticed one thing. If I remove the disk from diskdrive, the drive 
starts clicking. It clicks all the time, even when flying the ship.. 

This made me wonder, could it possibly be that the game doesn't disable 
multitasking. So, I made the following script:

run frontier
wait 10 secs
dir dh0:

and executed it. Frontier started, and after ten seconds I could hear my
harddrive reading the directory.. 

So the game does multitask. However, there is no way to get the WB screen
visible, since Frontier has it's own copperlists.. I haven't tried what
happens if I get the OS copperlist from gfxbase and poke that to $dff080.

First, my setup:

  Python Freighter
  20MW Beam Laser + booster
  12 Shield Generators
  Energy Booster
  Naval ECM System
  Class 5 Hyper Drive
  + all the essentials

  2.5 Million Credits

  Federal Rank: Corporal
  Elite Rank  : Competent

  This took me about 30 hours of gameplay.

My problem:

The game is becoming boring and repetitive!!!

Space Combat:

With my setup all you have to do is setting the
docking computer to the enemy space craft and
CRASH into it!!! You loose 20-30% of your shield,
but with 12 shield generators that's no problem.

NO space craft has yet posed any threat! I wiped
out the whole police fleet of a space station
this way.

WHERE'S THE CHALLENGE ?????

Missions:

I poked around the binary and as far as I can see
there are NO tailor made missions, just the randomly
created ones that you all know.

Er... It sounds like you forgot to set the stack size to 100000 man. On my

flicker was close to unbearable.

Huh?  What does stack size have to do with it?  The flicker comes from it
using a 16 color screen...

Just to make sure, I tried it with a 150k stack - no difference.

Hi all.

There were several posts concerning autopilot docking, which sooner or
later would result in a crash. Happened to me yesterday on several
occasions, but only when I had changed the view while docking. I think you
should be in front view, i.e. not behind the ship, or watching its back. As
far as I could see, game speed had nothing to do with it, you can change
the speed during auto-docking with no problems.

I have tried playing Frontier but have only had about 30 mins flying time.
The trouble is I can't seem to kill the pirates. I manage to hit them a few
times but they always either ram me or hit me with a missile. Anyone got any
tips? 

By the way, how do you target a missile? I can't seem to find it.

Yes, it does. If you are running a screen blanker, it might be better to
turn it off before starting the game. Since the game is catching all input
and won't let anything through, the blanker gets active after a while
and can slow the game down. (This happened with SuperDark.)

I don't see any reason why the program doesn't use a proper screen. Also,
it would be nice if one could leave the game without rebooting.

I still love it, though ;-)

I've only crashed (so far) if I used the outside view while docking.

Yes, but there seems to be less flicker than in the demo version. I don't find
it too annoying, though.

Same here.

I count the heading of a paragraph as a line and use upper- or lowercase
letters - had no problems so far. Don't know if case is significant. There's
nothing about it in the manuals.

I think it keeps the system alive. The drives are clicking, and a screen
blanker will get active after some time (although you don't see it).
SuperDark slowed the game down, so remember to turn your blanker off
before starting the game.

You get the preferences by pressing ESC twice. They are not fully
described, only a few hints about it are scattered throughout the manual.

Hi there,

o.k. we all know about Elite I, don't we.

Forget it. That does not mean that it isn't a VERY good game, but
we're talking about Frontier.

IMHO it is meant as a game for itself and not as a real sequel to
Elite I. But now, as I'm ready with reading all those postings
about Frontier, my questions:

1) Is it that slow on 60000 as all of you say ?

2) If there is a lower detail level and does the game get faste
then (perhaps the same minimal graphics as Elite I)

3) Is it possible, with the harder flight controls in mind, to hit
the enemy or even kill him ?

4) Is the game really worth buying for 60000


Thanks

Wolfgang

I had problems like that when I started it with its icon from
Workbench. As someone already mentioned, Frontier doesn't disable
multitasking, so a screenblanker might cause the freezeing you
mentioned. Or a clock program trying to do audio etc. I have such a
customized Workbench (and with many of those "this is a nasty
hack"-type utilities) that I chose to start using PickStartup and boot
directly to Frontier without any utilities whatsoever (and because I
can't come back from Frontier anyway, I don't need those utilities
before I have to boot again).

It's not empty. In the previous station there were more announcements
and you scrolled the screen down. Now you are in station with few
announcements and the program fails to show them. (Apparently programmers
forgot to reset the counter). You can avoid this by always scrolling
the bulleting board all the way up before launching. Time acceleration
works, too.

I wonder what did the programmers do with all the time they got. It
seems that they didn't beta-test Frontier at all. Also I just had
a quick look at the code and there's not too many different missions.
Most of them are stupid delivery missions, few assassination missions
and there appears to be some kind of photographing mission. The best
seems to be destroying some planetary installation with a nuclear missile.
And that's about it. The rest seems to be just variations of these
basic missions. I couldn't find any special missions nor any sign of
alien races. (I hope I just missed them :( )

Nope. Not at all on a A3000. Actually it's pretty hard to target the enemy
'cause they sortof zoom by. I run on the highest detaillevel, and the only
time things get choppy, is on planet surfaces. In space it's smooth as silk.
But, geez, those dogfights are HARD! Either you can't get the enemy into your
sights, and if you can, so can he...

Anyway; Frontier is loads smoother than ie WingCommander, KillingCloud or
Elite I... I can really recommend it. It's smooth, well behaved, and has DEPTH!

Don't talk shit. There is no challenge what so ever in the space
combat after you get a beam laser. period. 

And Frontier SEEMS to have depth but it fact it contains nothing.
Play it for a week or two - you'll see that I'm right. I know - 
I've played it for about 25 hrs, last 5 hrs has been simply boooooring
and I don't think I want to play it any more.

If you really want challenge use Elite style control, pulse laser,
weak ship etc.. no one is forcing you to upgrade your ship :-)

Hey I think the idea is to upgrade ships so you can kill larger
baddies. Problem is thet there is virtually NIL 'baddies' out there,
so you are either underpowered or overpowered. Again one could have
avoided this with some proper playtesting.

I'm getting pretty annoyed at the copy protection of Frontier... It's kindof
tiring to have to look in the manual EVERY TIME I DOCK! I thought it was
supposed to stop after I've answered it a couple of times, but no - it just
keeps going. It seems it asks every time I dock after a SAVE/RESTORE.
Guess I'll have to find a cracked copy.  

Other than this, it's a great game. The protection sucks, tho. As usual.

Every time after restore. Saving has no effect.

Well, it doesn't stop, but it doubles the time between questions every time

  Ok, you now own Frontier.  And its huge, you have little idea of what to do
and less idea how to get rich.  Well read on. 
  If you don't want any help with this game then skip this post. :)
  In the beginning.  It is easiest to start at Ross 154, the autopilot makes
life much simpler.  Load up with animal meat and take the mission to Bernard's
star.  From there go to Sol carring robots.  As your pulse laser is next to
useless sell it and outfit your ship with two Naval missiles.  As they are
immune to ECM and can chase a target for over 300km they outperform your
pitiful laser.  Keep moving stuff back and forth between Sol and Bernard's
Star for a while.  When you can afford a Military 1 Drive get it, it takes up
half as much space as the normal one, now you have to use military fuel.  Be
careful, when used it becomes radioactives, which are illegal in the Sol
system.  Get in the habit of dumping it after every jump and refuel.  And
since you are moving between two space stations you can sell your atmospheric
shielding to give you extra space.  From Sol carry Luxury Goods back to
Bernard's star, and taking any missions going your way.  Eventually you will
have enough to upgrade your ship, a good step up would be the Viper, as it can
carry missiles and has a decent cargo capacity.  Fit it with a 1MW Beam Laser
and you are now ready for some real combat.
  Dogfight Tactics.  Learn to use your autopilot for aiming.  Target your
opponent, hitting escape and pausing the game makes this easier.  Turn on your
autopilot when your opponent is a ways away from your say at least 3km.  Any
closer and you risk a colision.  Be careful, when you are lined up like this
your opponent is also, so save the game before fights.  A good way to get that
3km is to fire a missile at your opponent.  The naval missiles I reccomend may
be enough to kill your target, but given enough lead and speed they can be
outrun.  So when your opponent comes back in you should be facing him already,
just leave the autopilot on and start firing at about 5-6km away.  Bigger and
slower opponents you can kill with manual aiming, but always keep at least 300
kph speed set, any slower and you become an easy target.  You can aim much
easier if you turn off your engines, but you will have a tendency to get
rammed by opponents.  So the lesson is, chase them off with a missile, if they
live through that then laser them on the way back.
  Smuggling.  You can make a lot of credits carrying contraband, but unless
you are going to cheat and save the game right before you dock, say in the
last 2km or so, and reload if you get fined, it won't be worth it.  A word of
advice though.  Any system that has contraband for sale will have plenty of
pirates in it.  So be prepared for combat on the way to the port.  You may
want to carry extra fuel in case you run into too much opposition.  He who
fights and runs away, lives.  The viper gives you 4 missiles and the beam
laser, it should be enough though.  And killing all those pirates is good for
your Elite rating.

  Hope this helps someone.

Sideline Software has it. Their telephone guy told me they have hundreds
of back-orders for the game, but are only receiving it in limited quantities
(20-50 per day.) I put in my order about a week and a half ago and haven't
gotten it yet. :-( Waah, I want my Frontier... (snif)

I beleive that most of the systems in Frontier have no names.
(Especially those that are on the other side of the galaxy).

If so this would provide an interesting mission.  Pilots could 
explore and be given the right to name these systems. 

I propose the following:

Someone could set up a mailing list containing th names of 
new systems, and the date of their discovery.  This would 
be posted to the Internet periodically.

Problems I've already thought of:

a. Should the date be that of now, or the program date?

I am quite willing to be the moderator for this list
(It would look good on my CV :-) )
But hopefully this article should provoke an interesting
debate.

I look forward to hearing from you. It would be better if 
people posted their articles rather than email.

   Nope. Optimizing for 68020+ 32-bit machines makes a really HUGE difference.
One thing comes to mind when I say that. Tmapdemo - by Chris Green. There are
others, but there are two things you can cancel out here. 1. Calculations
per cycle are done faster with bigger words and optimizations so you get
your needed punch for 3D. 
    2. AGA machines wouldn't really be hindered much by using 256-color
screens as ECS with 32. This is especially true if they used 128-color
screens with 7 bitplanes. When people want even more speed, they use
the 128-color option. Not surehow much difference it makes, but any addition
of speed without the ability to see the difference between 7 or 8 bitplanes
in an application, goes in the right direction.

   So there you have it. Just like Anim-5 -> Anim-7, the use of 32-bit and
not 16-bit optimized code makes a heap of difference. It's a good thought
that no AGA machine has a 16-bit architecture.

The PC-version of frontier is SHORTER than the amiga version!
It has many overlay files but the total amount of used bytes is smaller
than on the amiga.
On a 386-40 you have smooth movement ONLY if you switch off texture
mapping!
The sound is WORSE than the amiga sound! There might be hope for owners
of a Roland-soundboard which is supported.
And the Amiga-version is cheaper :-)

If I remember the DMA allocation table correctly (don't have a copy
handy) you'll loose one out of four slots with a fifth bitplane, so
in 32 colours the CPU slowdown is about 25% (I think the actual percentage
is 18, when you consider the horizontal and vertical blanks.) There
is a trade-off when using five bitplanes, but it's definately not 50%
or more.

Do you know how the circles and ellipses are modelled in Interphase?
I'm working on a vector engine at the moment where I really would
like to include circles and ellipses.

(BTW: Does anybody have the e-mail address of Adrian Stevens (the
author of Interphase))

I look close at these objects and came to the conclusion that they are
drawn using lines. I don't think that this is 'incredibly slow' if you
use a processor drawline which may is more efficient at small lines.

Bezier cueves and B-splines need many multiplications for EVERY single

used them to calculate every 10th pixel and draw a line between.

Are you joking? On a normal A2000 with fastram you get only 3 frames
per second on the default detail level. On a accelarated machine the
speed is okay - but NOT fast.

I can confirm this. 6 bit planes means 50% processor speed, 5 means 75%
and 4 or less 100%. If it were true that 6 planes meant 0% CPU speed,
Kick Off, Kick Off 2 and GOAL! would never have run in a frame on a 68000.

I've tried Frontier, and I would pay some serious cash to get an
AGA-version of that game. Whow.. It is GREAT, man!!
And what about a CD^32-version with lots of animations and music??

I am praying that the CD^32 becomes the 'ultimate game-machine', like
C64 and A500 were some years ago. Then we could see some really good
games using AGA/020+.. If I hadn't been a poor student, I'd buy a
CD^32 right away..

|> I think things are looking up :)

So do I.. And if CBM could finish AAA and RTG soon, I really think
that Amiga is going to exist for many decades to come.. :-))

He probably uses views for double-buffering (but then he could have
put in a pause mode which switched back to WB; and an exit option...)
instead of screen double-buffering (which is much more time consuming
on 1.x and 2.x)

If it multitasks what's the purpose of forcing the user to reset his
machine? Is Braben afraid someone might try to rip sound/gfx data?

Some people here like to claim he's some sort of immortal, yet this
great almighty programmer won't provide a proper way to exit the game.

Lame!

Rip *those* sounds? Probably not...

Well, when I've decided it's time to quit today's (read: tonight's) game,
it's time for for bed anyway, so I just switch the whole damn thing off.
I can see your point though, it would have been an easy task to make
an exit option.

Simple. The game was originally meant to be at least so system
friendly it could be exited, BUT in the rush that is smelling
from every corner of the game, I belive that several bugs were
left in that would have caused funny effects after exit, so because
of the pressure of the deadline for release, Braben just made
one jump command to the start of the game in case player pushes
exit.

(Why else it would have been called 'exit' if it would not exit
the game.)

I know one guy who has been looking in the code and he said that
Frontier does multitask, but it does some nasty things it should not
do so exiting would probably result in very unstable machine.

He also said that exitable version would be just a few days
work max with the source code handy. I don't know for sure but
he might do a hack himself to make Frontier exitable and possibly
smootly multitasking. It will anyway be a hard job, but...


OH WHY DID THEY RELEASE SUCH A PIECE OF BUGS! Few weeks worth
of beta-testing/bugfixing would have meant lot. End users should
not be the beta testers.

Info just heard from elsewhere: When the Frontier was released
in Germany, it was V1.01. This means that they are doing something.
Bad thing is that the V1.01 has some ADDITIONAL bugs in it, dunno
about what they've fixed in it. At least it's larger than the
V1.0. I have not seen this version, so all this is 2nd hand info.

MAIL A LETTER TO GAMETEK TODAY, DEMAND A BUG-FREE FRONTIER.
(And an AGA version if you have too new machine:-)

(I'm mailing my letter in a day or two, making the bug-list
wasn't hard, but I want to include a ton of suggestions
to improve the game. Few tiny ones only needing a few byte tweak
and separately few large ones which are just daydreaming...)

After hearing about all the bugs and problems in Frontier I have somehow been
convinced to wait for the next release, hopefully with these bugs fixed.
It sounds like this game that I have waited almost a decade for, was 
sloppily put together.  I bet if FIREBIRD had put it out, there wouldn't
have been so many problems.  What I really want to know is if these bugs
seriously effect the playability of the game, or are they just annoying 
extras features?

Well, in my opinion, they are just annoying extra features. The
playability and the atmosphere are great! If I were you, I'd buy the
current version of Frontier, because GameTek has said that the future
versions depend on the success of this one. So unless people buy
Frontier, there will not be Frontier AGA, Frontier II or anything.

If I remember correctly the article posted here a few days ago, Braben
has said that he wants to develop Frontier further, i.e. there will
propably be new versions. And GameTek has said that they will provide
an upgrade path for people with older Frontiers.

Seems like there would be a need for some group like this, considering
the owerwhelming amount of traffic the game has generated in 
comp.sys.amiga.games, and most probably will generate in the 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.* groups once the PC-version is released released.

Note: I will not create the group, I'm just checking up on the general 
interest of such a group. If anyone creates it, good. If anyone doesn't, fine.
I'm just starting the discussion.

Followups directed to alt.config.

Come on -- Frontier is just a flash in the pan.  6 months ago there
was talk of a Civilization group, 6 months from now there will be
something else.  If there was a group founded for every popular
game we'd have a hundred subgroups, none of them with any resonable
amount of usage.

If you want to break it up, look at what comp.sys.pc.games has done
and make generalized subgroups - rpg, action, stategy, etc.

Totally agreed. Furthermore, in order to start a newsgroup you have to
convince the people at the top why discussion is not suitable in any of the
other groups. Since this is comp.sys.amiga.games and Frontier happens to be
a game for the amiga, you probably have a hard time convincing them that
the new Frontier.group really adds to the repertoire of newsgroups already
available.

Beside, I like the frontier posts just where they are (o.k., actually this
was my *first* argument :-) )

Yeah, the bulletin board thing happens very often! If it wasn't frontier,
I would even bother with it, with all those bugs =(

Sure about that? I don't think you'd want to run into my Imperial Transport!
I have a 100MW beam laser. Kills most other ships with 1 hit!

I also have ~8 Shield generators! Who wants to trade, when you could kill
innocent tradeships, and steal their cargo?

Hmm, I must check this out. Maybe he has used the view-vector
instead of the speed-vector in one of the calculations. Why
haven't the beta-testers discovered this (And most of the
other bugs)???

Cant you already see it? Frontier has not been beta-tested. How else
that stack size shit, bulletin board bugs and few other
very obivious mistakes would have been in the release version?
(belive or not, ran from original disks it doesn't run on some
machines, but when you manually set the stack to 100000 it works
fine.)
Also the manual and the game differ very very much when we are
talking about ship stats. Funniest thing is the Panther clipper:

TOTAL MASS (fully loaded): 1775t
CARGO CAPACITY: 2000t

Oh well, the whole ship weights 1775t with full cargo load and all, but
it can carry 2000t? and more funny things: manual states:

TOTAL MASS (fully loaded): 2500t
CARGO CAPACITY: 2100t

leaving nice 400t for the hull and other tidbits, just like in all other
crafts.

Manual also has other bugs and in the last page THEY HAVE EVEN SPELLED
THE NAME OF THE PROGRAMMER WRONG! 

HOW CAN A BETA-TESTER WITH HALF-A-BRAIN AND OVER 5 MINUTES OF PLAYING
TIME MISS SOMETHING LIKE THIS. First time I saw panther clipper in 
ship sales list, I viewed it and started to wonder which one was wrong,
my calculator and brain, or the game's stats!

Also no beta tester could have passed the ship repair 'feature' which requires
you to click mouse/press button for EVERY DAMN 0.25t of hull you repair,
yes, that means 400 t of hull damage = 2400 CLICKS! Auto repair
helps of course, but if you don't want to spend 40t of cargo space
to a non-essential system, you have to buy it, fly out, wait for repair,
go back in, sell it... not logical.

Oh, I'm having good time flaming, lets continue. How about the combat?
After 20-30hrs of gameplay you can have so good ship that you don't need
to fire a shot, just let the enemy crash your shields. And if you want
to fight anything bigger than Imperial Courier, you need to go after
them (killing missions or plain piracy with hyperdrive cloud
following) and when they are not aggressive to you in the beginning,
toasting them to bits with 100MW beam or better is total bore, they
have no chance what so ever.

Missions? Standard stuff found in bulletin board is bore. Shipping
persons or filling out missin persons stuff is clearly
NOT WORTH THE TIME SPENT. (not to mention cargo space,
5t/cabin makes me laugh. I carry robots or slaves instead, better profit)
Killing missions are better but due to the fact that most targets
are just sitting ducks it's also just race against the clock to
get there , do the kill, exit fast and collect payment. No challenge.

Military stuff is MEGAboring in the beginning, just shipping shit. Assasination
missions are mildy interesting, as targets are usually many lightyears
away, and you need to plan the route to get there in time, and it
clearly affects your military rank (*which I PRAY brings you something
like unique missions/additional equipment)

With a standard 3d-routine and just few thousand non-detailed
star systems this would be piece of shit. With MEGA-good (too bad
it's bit power-hungry) 3d-routine and 100 billion starsystems
(ok, 99.9999% are non-interesting) and some good ideas
it is still a good game but WHAT A WASTE of great 3d/starsystem
thing this is. I would go totally crazy if you could map the
unknown starsystems, receive credit for just the mapping (rank/cash)
and have a good chance of actually finding something unique. (something
like find ancient ruins/alien races/ancient damaged spacecraft etc
etc possibilities are endless) And those unique findings should happen
at least 1-2 times /few hours so they would come not too often but
at the same time you would stay hooked as you would wonder what you
find next. 

Currently I'm afraid that one can suck Frontier dry of anything
worth playing in just a few days and the only thing that makes
you to load it again is the spectacular 3d-routine. 
(even it has it's bugs, but I've learnt that with 3d-routines you
have to draw a line how perfect it is and how fast it is. One must
cut corners to make it run more than 1fps)

I reserve my right to change this opinion in case I find
something good from Frontier, but currently
it's going nowhere. I'm going to play it until i'm ELITE,
so i'm sure I won't miss anything...

create a true, timeless, perfect classic to Gametek. I will do so.)

It seems he did, because whenever you crash in 'behind-view' there is often
a wing hitting the entrance to the orbital station. When you're in front
view, auto-pilot doesn't see wings, so auto-pilot doesn't need to pay
attention to wings (boy, is this *lame*)

I do have to say that I had a planet-crash in front-view yesterday on
Formatur, so auto-pilot is not completely reliable in front-view either.
BTW if you want to discover a real annoying feature/bug, take a look at the
Alcaille 8670 (me thinks...) system. Major imports are fruit&vegs,
industrial parts, and some others. Load your ship, and go and trade in the
Alcaille system: THERE'S NO STARPORT!!! How do these guys import there
stuff!? Am I missing something, e.g. do I need another ship to trade with
Starportless planetary systems?

 Why
> haven't the beta-testers discovered this (And most of the

Let's face it, in real life David Braben has now officially become an
elite-trader, trading unfinished/untested products for full money (Wonder
what his criminal record looks like...) :-)

And people wonder why there's so much piracy...

Well, I get this funny association... Maybe the 2400 clicks indicate
you repaired the ship by hand, and the choice of .25t/click was to
make the player feel, how tedious it is to repair the ship this way
(and thus opt for automatic).
    (I couldn't help it).

First of all when you are playing it for 30 minutes you are not very far in the game and the pirates are not hard to kill.i just did this: find them on your scanner and on your fornt view click on them.When they pass you by and are about 10km away turn 
n autopilot and hit the space bar until really close (eg.1km or les) and disengage the autopilot.there is really nothing to it this way,but wait  until you engage better pirates :) targetting the missle is locking the view on the pirate by clicking on h
s s


hip and then on a missle and then on the launch button.c'est simple!

	I've been playing this game for a couple days and thought I
would share some bugs and maybe spoilers...

BUGS:

	First, autopilot is great, but I noticed that it tends to crash
into planets in groups. For example, I might go all day without crashing,
and then spend an hour crashing into everything that moves. Also noticed
that there is a tendency to crash into the same planets over and over again.

	Also, the enemies appear to arrive at predestined intervals. I
can't remember the number of times I had a conflict at x.xxx AU's from
a planet, to the exact number, 10 times in a row or more.

	Only once have I fought more than one enemy at a time.

	Sometimes it says "You arunder attack", and the enemy either
never attacks or isn't even in range as if it doesn't exist.

	Never received help from the "My ship is broken down" or
"My ship is under attack" no matter where I tried it (even near stations).

	If you are at a planet and want to dock on a city on the
opposite side, it IS possible to use autopilot to ck successfully.
I have done this many times.

	Some ports, such as Hoopertown, do not allow me to take off.

	Sometimes taking off using the fastest time mode will launch 
you and state that your time has expired and you must reapply, but send
you out anyway.

	Stations do not appear to be facing planets anymore like Elite I.

	Enemy missiles are rarely to be feared. They are not very 
threatening. And they seem to also leave a smoke trail.

	Attacking a port based on a planet may cause instant death. :)

	Attacking an orbiting stations is hard (I still use 5MW BEAMS).
They appear to have shields. Some stations send out the cops, while others
just fine you forever.

	If you sell goods through the bulliten board, one might be a cop,\
but the other generally isn't if another is listed.

	Sometimes the bullitens request an item for a huge sum, but by
the time I hop skip and jump, they are no longer offered for sale!

	I am also sick of these kamikazee fighters that keep crashing my 
ship as if on purpose.

	In Elite, sometimes you get attacked right after a hyperspace.
Hasn't happened yet in Frontier.

SPOILERS COMING NEXT:











SPOLIERS:

	If you see abig fight coming, set a close hyperspace jump in case
you need to save your butt at the last minute.

	Fast way to make money is to run drugs. For example, buy in
70 Osomething (-1,-1 I think) and trade at Arcturus stations. You will
make 600-700 CR per sale. 

	Look for people offering parcels for high amounts. Grab
as many as you can. Always ask for more money and advanced payment.
If you have no money and are just starting out, just blow them off
and you'll get yopur money to invest anyway.

	When you are up against some enemies, you can set them as
a target and then turn on autopilot. If you are lucky (probably 
dependent on your actual speed), your crosshairs will line up
with the bad guy. In most cases you might also crash, so turn away at 
around .5km by changing to manual control. Some bad guys (lie the
fighter planes) avoid you on their own.

	When an enemy first appears, use Manual control. As you get
your scanner, turn engines off and you can aim much better. Try
to shoot the bad guys while they are turning or flying towards or
away from you. Also good to hit them when they swing close to your ship.
But with engines off, you are a sitting duck for some missiles and
all the guys with beam lasers, so try varying or reserving it for
later in a fight.

	If you want to take a big chance to get more cargo space,
sell your missiles, scanner, atmosphere protector, and possibly
your laser and autopilot. You will not be able to land on some
planets, and you will have trouble fighting, but you can sell
drugs faster. :)

	Here is what I usually trade at best prices: Narcotics, Robots,
Computers, Fruits and Vegetables, Animal Meat. Sometimes Luxury
Goods. All are often featured by people willing to pay double
market value (also battle weapons). Watch out when you trade
illegal items though... the cops might get you.

	Using the fastest time setting increaes the chances of hitting
a planet or of encountering an enemy. Sometimes I set it to one speed
lower to avoid a troublesome bad guy.

	When you really want to threaten people, buy lots of shields
and a beam gun and a quick laser regenerator and go look for fights.
Practice on the police if you want, but they come out in one big
group which is a problem.

	Work your way up to larger ship tonages as quick as possible,
even if it only leaves you with under 3000 CR. I made it to my 5th
ship in one day (70t or so), even after screaming at the game a million
times due to all the kamikazees and autopilot crashes.

	To fight without a scanner, find the bad guy as quick as
possible and select him as a target. then turn the names of the planets off,
and he will be easier to identify. Also, you may get hints from the
system as to which direction the target is in (meager as they are).

	That's all for now...

Well, I can't be sure, but from what I understand it should be Really Soon
Now (tm)

Gosh it sure feels good to be saying that about an IBM game instead of an
Amiga game, for a change :-)

I'm not quite sure what you mean by locked speed vector here.  If you mean
that if you're going really fast and then change your ship's heading, you
don't immediately start moving in the new direction, then that's not called
a bug, that's called in-real-life,-multiton-spaceships-don't-stop-on-a-dime.

This message is 100% flames to the coder(s) and publisher of Frontier
(others may want to wear asbestos too, this is really hot stuff)

Feel free to disagree, and if you want, do so in public,
but stay behind your comments when you have uncovered the
truth...

I FEEL CHEATED - FRONTIER IS JUST A PIECE OF SHIT COVERED
WITH ONE OF THE COOLEST DRESSINGS EVER. PERIOD.

After going thru the game file (reading all the texts there
is to read etc) I can say that after you own a 500t+ ship
and you have enough cash to do what ever you want, there is
NOTHING left.

(few military missions and experimenting with totally profitless
mining, but I'll skip those, they are not worth mentioning
for reasons stated later)

Ok, galaxy looks HUGE. But it's just smokescreen. In reality
there is NOTHING beyond the area of the starmap supplied
with the game which covers microscopic area of the whole
galaxy. Nothing in the game file indicates that there would be
anything unique outside say 50-100ly from sun, and even those
randomly generated spaceports end around 200ly. - and galaxy
is HUGE, thousands of light years wide. (hell, tens of
thousands, maybe over hundred thousand, but it's irrelevant)

Those simple and boring missions you can see in the bulletin
board are all you can get - most of them are profitless
and all of them are unintersting after you've done them once. no
challenge what so ever.

Trading - that's something you can do, but you can do it even
in FOFT - and without anything else it gets very booooring
in no time. If you find trading interesting, say that
again after you got 200t or so free cargo space and enough
weaponry to kill anything in less than 10 seconds.

Killing pirates - space combat. Has some idea until you get beam
lasers. After that each battle lasts approx 5-10 seconds. Less if
you have enough shields to ram any enemy. In other words
nothing to do after few hours.

Military missions - you can move stuff (data cards etc) from one place 
to another, get assasination missions (pretty much like those
killing jobs in normal board), get filming missions and even
missions to destroy some installation with nuclear missile.
- AND THATS IT, all missions are same random shit and they offer
no challenge what so ever after 1-2 times done.

Mining. IF you ever land on a planet with no spaceports manually, tell me!
Mining is something I have not been able to try, but then again you
can mine ridiculous amount of 10 tons/miner. You make more profit
with plain trading anyday.

And what else is there? Ship upgrading is exciting for first few hours
of gameplay, but as there is no hidden items anywhere to be found
(well hexdump does list class 4 military drive and 'fighter launcher',
but I belive fighter launcher is not implemented as there is no
other references to it.) after 10-30 hrs depending on your skill
you have maxed your ship.

So all you are left with is to wander around the 100 billion stars that
are out there - with no chance what so ever to find anything ever.

Granted, 3D routine rules - never before has someone succeeded this well
in duplicating at least remotely realistic spaceflight, but there
is simply no substance. With totally lame&easy space combat there
is no real reason to go for ELITE status, as there is nothing out
there.

GO DIG BRABEN OUT OF HIS HOLE AND FORCE HIM TO ADD GAME TO THIS
GREAT 3D ROUTINE!

The bug-farm that is living in the game certainly doesn't help,
there is at least 5 major bugs affecting the gameplay and
few dozen illogicalities, typos and clear spots for
improvements.

So to put it short:

Currently Frontier contains no game beyond few hours of fun, hell 
I find ORIGINAL Elite more intersting after all these years simply
because it has working space combat which requires skill.

- Jarnis (overpissed. cheated. wasted 250FIM for 20-30 hrs
          of fun with nothing left when the game promised
          oh so much)

Okey, anyone on the net willing to pay something for a genuine
original FRONTIER (amiga) - all manuals etc. Only thing missing
is the registration card that I already have mailed. (In hope
of upgrades etc.)

I paid 250FIM (approx 45$ or so) and I'm willing to sell it for about that,
plus postage.

Anyone want this?

Heck, I would pay an upgrade fee for less bugs and new features, and I
haven't even received my copy yet!

Perhaps we could obtain the snailmail addresses of one or more of {Konami,
Gametek,David Braben} and deluge them with politely worded, constructive
comments, indicating our willingness to shell out a bit more if necessary
for Frontier 1.1, and suggesting new features to add. We might even
construct a comprehensive electronic letter, sign it with the names of
hundreds of people who read c.s.a.games and send it off.

The only risk is that they'll pull a World Circuits on us and only
develop the PC version, but if that happens then we can always firebomb
their offices.

Perhaps the game writer and game company will take feedback from users and
release a bug-fixed and/or expanded version of the game.  If what people say
about U.S. release date being around December is true, then perhaps there will
be a Frontier v1.1 which fixes most of these problems.  And then there was the
interview that seemed to indicate that there will be add-ons and expansions
released later... maybe.

Note:  I haven't seen the game, only the demo on a 68000.  Understandably, you
are upset, but maybe all is not lost for Frontier.  Would you pay a small
upgrade fee (or no fee) to solve the bugs and/or add new features?  Or are

	Buy a buggy game, then pay for the bugfixes that shouldn't have 
been there in the first place? Are you high? :)

	But if the game was upgraded (read: aga) and new features added, I
think a fee of up to 1/3rd the original price of the game would not be out
of line.

So don't buy a beam laser! I mean, if the game gets too easy IF you do
something (buy beam laser, buy many shield generators and crash into
other ships, etc.), then don't do it and the game is challenging
again. You seem to complain that the game is TOO EASY and that the
autopilot's errors make the game TOO DIFFICULT. I've found that I LIKE
to help the autopilot a bit, to make the docking quicker. I even find
this bug very realistic (except that it seems only to happen when
using external view), I mean, when have you seen a real-life computer
that works? Right, why should autopilot, then?

Frontier is as boring as you make it to be. If you only look at your
rankings as a "score", then you've completely misunderstood the
concept of Frontier. If one way of life gets boring, start another
game (or sell your existing ship and donate your money away, that's
possible you know). Sell your beam laser and shield generators, don't
use autopilot on battles, dock manually, ENJOY THE LIFE!

Oh well, in theory your idea is ok, but the combat is like this:

1MW pulse - very difficult and time consuming with a very high
chance of getting killed by an enemy craft hitting you head-on.

5MW pulse - midly interesting. still good chance of getting
hit by kamikaze guys. And then again you kill almost anything
with 1-2 shots if you hit one.

30MW mining - fire and pray for hit. if you hit, it dies. period.

no feel of dogfight ever.

Also I really expect that if you can upgrade stuff, more expensive ships
would be better. In fact even plain Cobra MKIII is a very good ship, and
anything above Imperial Trader is clumsy and usually not worth the cash.

There should be small but very expensive crafts with some advantages
for example, or very big but relatively cheapo ships with disadvantages
etc.etc. currently ships go up in price and power pretty smoothly, but
at certain point their usefullness drops rapidly as you don't really
need additional cargo space.

What I'd like would be to get one of those Long Range Cruisers you can see
at some spacestations (and in the demo), and use it as a carrier. Equip it
with a fleet of Vipers and attack the Federal naval base at Eta Cassiopeia..
Oh, except there is no Federal navy fleet anywhere near Eta. I haven't even
been able to get a Federal military mission from the Mortuary (the station
orbiting the navy base planet).
BTW: I killed one Cruiser today with a 4MW beam laser. The station I was
near sent one Police Viper, which managed to crash itself to the station
just after launching.
Oh, and how can the biggest ship in the whole Frontier universe be equipped
with a  Class 2 military drive (according to Radar Mapper), and be called
long range?

Sounds like that stack problem. If you start the game from the shell, set the
stack to 70000 first. If you start it from Workbench, make sure that the icon
contains the right stack setting.

How did you do that, I just plastarted to play and I now have just good 1000
 $ ,I think I will continue to trade until I can afford a passenger Cabine,but I just read
 that it will use 5 t. I only have 4 at my ship.:-(((
 I new ship will cost much more that I can made with trade.What Did you do ?

Perhaps it is a little misunderstandable. I mean, is it easy,
normal, hard or very hard to hit the enemy in space dog fights.

Is there any aid like the targeting computer in Elite I, which
BEEPS when you locked the missile or when the enemy was in the
right position to fire your laser.

Your answer makes me believe, that I will never be able to mess
with those pirates ( and that's the fun, isn't it :^} )

Correct me if I am wrong but 32 colours is the limit on a Non-AGA machine

detail.

   It looks like you don't have a manual. Am I correct?

 Oh boy, you really are paranoid, Dino... Perhaps the system is against us
and is spreading copied games and we have to fight it. Let us form a

And I thought combat in Elite was trivial.  I mean, you take your
Military laster, blast away half the enemies make a circle to cool off
your lasers and finish off the rest.  If Frontier combat is even
easier than Elite, then it must be really trivial.

Oh my, oh my...

(No re-flame - Just another point of view)

Well, I will not get my hands on Frontier until monday, so I can not
(yet) back my remarks with hours of playing, but :

ELITE *never* offered any challenge beyond the same firts 10-30 hours
of playing!!!

Combat was too easy (When You had built an Iron-ass, mind You).
Trading got boring.
Mining - don't even mention it
Where were all the space-dredgers mentioned in the manual ?
Did anyone ever find the Black Wheel ?


Why did I go on then ? Easy! The freedom of choice. *I* created the
game - not Mr. Braben.

If You (as me) are born about 300 Years to early in the socalled
spaceage, ELITE is one hell of a compensation!, and I expect FRONTIER
to be even bigger - not because of what David Braben put into the
game, but because of what I can get out of it!

Keep in mind that FRONTIER has been hyped for at least a year now -
It simply has to be a let-down if You want Mr. Braben to make it all
happen.


FRONTIER seems to offer a even greater 'universe' with even more
options for a space-jock (Hell, I plan on finding out all I can about
The Federation and The Empire before choosing sides - and then I'm
going to stick with that side until some bastard gets lucky one
evening and catches me off guard in alien skies.)


For me it's going to be another adventure (and I thank David Braben
for giving me that chance).

Space combat in Frontier is usually very easy - at least if one has
large plasma accelerator, 50-70 shield generators etc. However I
recently started travelling and found a nice little star called
Ayurso. It seems like the local civil war does bring lots of pirates
around and I actually got shot down once very quickly. I just saw a
white mark on my scanner and suddenly shields started to fail rapidly
and just before I exploded I managed to see the Imp trader (or some
ship that looks like it) fireing me for the last time. So, I guess it
is time for me to get rid of the heavy weight large plasma accelerator
and buy a small one and use the extra space with shields...

Me,  and  I'll tell you how.  Right now I'm competent/constrictor, having 4
millions of money left.

You start at Ross 154 system and sell *everything* you have except the auto
pilot.  You don't need missles, or weapons, nothing.  Then you start off to
Barnards  Star, there you land in Boston Base (you should never try to land
on a planet - you sold your Atmospheric Shielding, right?).  Now buy Robots
and  Computers  as much as you can afford/carry.  Then fly to Sol, and land
at  Mars  High.   Here  you  look  at  the Bulletins for people looking for
Computers/Robots.   If  there's  nobody  interested, fast-forward the whole
day  -  next  day's  bulletins  are different.  You'll earn about $1200 per
tonne,  since  people  from the Bulletins pay twice the regular price.  Now
buy  Luxury Goods.  Take them back to Boston Base at Barnards Star and sell
them  normally,  earn about $200-$300 per tonne.  Repeat this until you can
afford a larger ship.  Finally you end up with the Puma or Panther Clipper,
making more than a million per flight.

Note  well,  you will *never* become attacked on this route, as long as you
don't transport sensible small packages from suspicious persons :-)

If  you  feel  you  have enough money for the next few virtual years, buy a
Constrictor.   Equipt it with Auto Refueler, Auto Pilot, A.Shielding, Naval
ECM,  Class  3  Military  Drive,  2  Shield  Generators, Radar Mapper, Hyp.
Analyser,  and a 4MW Beam Laser front mounted.  If I didn't forget anything
you should have 29 tons cargo left for military fuel.  With this equiptment
you  can  follow enemies (removal jobs), win nearly all fights (see below),
fly large distances without refueling (several jumps, 15 light years each),
survive energy bombs with none or 1 tonne damage, and so on.  Excellent.

Now  look  at  the bulletins, people want you to fly small packages to some
systems.   Do  only the $1000+ ones, since they automatically lead you into
trouble.   The  more  trouble  you are in, the more enemies you kill.  Your
Elite ranking raises.

For  fighting,  one  easy  technique  makes  fights  a play for kids.  When
someone  starts attacking you, turn off autopilot and accelerate as much as
you  can.  Turn around your ship that the enemy is behind you.  Look at the
rear view and select the enemy as target.  When you're around 10km far away
from him, turn to front view and enable the autopilot.  Now shoot until the
other  ship  is 3km near, then toggle back to manual control and accelerate
(not  changing  direction).   The  enemy  starts  shooting  at  around  2km
distance,  but  can hardly hit you in manual mode.  Repeat this when you're
again 10km far away from him.  This way takes some time (maybe 5 approaches
average),  but you lose only 1 out of 25 fights (save everytime you dock on
a starport/space station).  And you don't have to train fighting..

That's my whole secret up to now.  Have fun!

You CAN lower the detail, and the lowest level looks pretty much like the
old Elite. Don't know if it gets faster (I always use Highest), but I see
no reason why it shouldn't.

It's DARN HARD, atleast if you're up against some of the smallest and most
agile ships, like an Eagle fighter. Blowing them to bits is easy, getting
them in the sight is not. If you've got a big/tough enough ship, one can
try ramming them.
(It's pretty easy to target a 2000 tonnes Panther Clipper, though. :-))

Doubtful. Seems like a good reason to get a faster machine, though...

Wasn't it the other way around? I have an old poster on my wall with 
Firebird/Rainbird/Whateveritwas logos on it. I think the third label was 
for budget games... and all the old Elite boxes I've seen had that nice 
red Firebird logo on them. The silver-colored one was the rainbird logo... 
Starglider I was a Rainbird game, as was Carrier Command, so they did not 
sell budget games under the Rainbird label.

I think so aswell... It seems to me that Frontier isn't really a game, it's
...how should I put it...it wants to get a Sense Of Wonder across to the
player, and the gaming obscures this. The solar system, for instance, is
correct to the smallest detail: the planets are of the correct size, on the
correct distance from the sun, with the correct gravity and correct lengths
of day and year. You can move around freely, and, for instance, watch Saturn
rising over Titan. You can do complicated space-faring maneuvres like using
planets gravity to increase your speed (slingshot). However, at the same time
you can go around killing pirates and gathering money, and you don't have
to bother about distractions such as multiple sunrises or slingshots. It
feels to me as if the 'game' part is just glued on top of things, as if the
programmer really just wanted to explore space, and threw in a bit of sex,
drugs, and rock'n roll to make it sell...

Frontier has the makings of a monumental game, of being 'the mother of
all games', but it's not ready. It'd have needed perhaps another year of
developing to iron out bugs and reconcile the gaming bit with the exploration
bit.

What's most needed, is better resistance (more big bad enemies -less
'flies'- and smarter and more accurate), more missions (REAL missions), and
the possibility to discover unexpected things when you leave the three human
realms.
Perhaps a few of the add-ons should be modified aswell... Shield generators
should be much bigger and more expensive, the docking computer could be
scrapped altogether... I'd like it if there were 'fleets' out there to
fight aswell, and the possibility of organising one oneself.

Anyway, the space-battle bit has to be redone pretty much from scratch.

Still, it's a great game until you reaches a certain level, no doubt about
that. I heard that Braben plans on releasing 'mission disks'... That might
do the trick.

I think so. But unfortunately Frontier is in low-res (320x200), and could
possibly have handled 32 colours (not sure. have never seen any 3-d game
so detailed before).

I just downloaded the frontier demo for MSDOS and compared it to the
Amiga demo.  The sequence of pictures in the two demos are exactly
identical.

The only big difference I noticed right away was the texture mapping.
I really like the way the galaxies were done in the PC version.  On
the Amiga you just have those blue patches, the PC version offers a
much more interesting background.  The buildings also looked quite
nice, but as a whole, the texture mapping makes things look a little
fuzzy at times.  For example those building look just like a jumble of
pixels when they overlap each other.  The problem is that the texture
mapping eliminates the sharp edges.  For those who have no idea what
texture mapping is, in the Frontier demo the main texture mapping seen
consists of a lot of small grey strips in various grey colors (makes
it look somewhat like a stone surface).  On the enemy ships the
texture mapping looks quite bad.  They look like they were carved out
of stone...  There was practically no variety in the texture mapping.
Only the building had a somewhat different texture mapping which
actually made them look quite real.

I did not have any sound on the PC version, the internal speaker is
not supported.

Speed-wise the Amiga seemed to be doing a little better.  I ran the PC
demo on a 33MHz 486DX and the Amiga demo on a 28MHz 040 (Amiga 500).
The PC version isn't perfectly smooth.  Sometimes the frames seem to
jump back and forth just a tiny bit (like the camera is shaking).  I
noticed a frame rate slowdown when the big space ship approach right
at the end.  This slowdown was not noticable on my Amiga 500.

The color problem does not exist in the PC version, I guess because it
has 256 colors available.  However the graphics _are_ identical.  I
didn't notice any more colors being displayed on the PC version, just
the color swapping is eliminated.  The PC version uses the same low
resolution the Amiga version does (which looks quite awful on the very
sharp NEC monitor I am using on the 486...  on a 1084 things look a
little less jagged).

That's about it.  I believe there is no reason to be jealous for
either side.  They look very much the same.  The texture mapping has
its nice features, but can be annoying, too.  Also it might be the
reason for the somewhat less perfect animation on the PC.

The PC version has several files associated with the demo, but came to
about the same file size as the Amiga.

This won't work, since you can't accelerate time when being attacked.

How about this. When being attacked, selected teh attacking ship and switch
to autopilot. I can't remember for sure (wince I have only been playing
the game for a few hours) but this should turn you around I think. It also
makes targetting much MUCH easier 8)

Argh...
The velocity vector is NOT "locked". It's just shown as relative to the
greatest mass around, usually the nearest star, or when you're very near
to a planet, to that.
When you're traveling several thousand kilometers per second relative to
the star of the system, you are NOT going be able to change the direction
not speed too much during one combat with even the 28G acceleration some
ships give.
However, if your velocity vector was shown relative to the opponent, it would
be much less, usually some hunderds or maybe thousands of kilometers per hour,
and changing constantly. Admitted, it would be nice if you could tell the
computer to show your speed relative to the target.
Remember, things are relative. The attacking ship more or less matches its
velocity with you, that is, you're both traveling at great speed towards
the system you happened to tell the autopilot to go to.
Just ignore the velocity indicators. They are of use only when going to an
orbit.
Speaking of orbits, if you're able to calculate the right velocity vector
to put you on a crossing orbit with the destination planet, you'll be able
to get there either with much less fuel consumption in the same time, or
much faster with the same fuel consumption (or anything in between), than
with the autopilot. In space, the straight line rarely is the fastest (or
shortest, calculated with delta v) route between two points.

With the exception of the 882 you have the SAME system as me!

I'm having a problem with my downloading. If I download (Using my 14.4) and
writing to the HD (Downloading to the HD) I get errors. (It doesnt' seem to
use the cts/rts) but downloading to ram works fine. (as does disk).

Any ideas???

I've been trying to follow the Frontier posts, but might have missed any
discussion on this.

Basically, is there a story?  Or do you just fly, trade, fly, trade,
fight, fight till you have a super-ship?  With, I assume, random
encounters with the Thargoids?  Can you choose a career in the military?
How different will that be, if so?

I'm only familiar with the PC version of Elite Plus.  Yes, I know, not a
Braben game.  In that one, you just received occasional "missions" at
very odd intervals.  Few and far between.  Is Frontier like that?

Thanks,

No there is no story. And NO THARGOIDS!

You can choose to work either with Imperium or Federation, and
rise military rank (known as title in the Imperium). Military
stuff goes alongside everything else. Military mainly gives you
few (4-5) other mission types to choose from. not much. Also
I think you can gain Military drive 4 thru ranks, but I can
not confirm this.

>Braben game.  In that one, you just received occasional "missions" at
>very odd intervals.  Few and far between.  Is Frontier like that?

no, you can choose small missions from bulletin board or ask
them from military. There is very few basic mission types and places,
times and people are randomly generated each time. megabooooring.

It runs real sweetly on my GVP A530 equipped A500 in "Very High" detail mode.
I'd say if you can't get a good price for your machine, buy an accelerator. But
I would still be tempted to buy an A1200 (it works quite well on a bog-standard
A1200) and then if Braben releases a 256 colour AGA version you can play that
too! :-)

Why don't you fix all the other bugs also?  At least the BBS bug should be
very easy to fix.  Then you could release your special bug-free version...

	I disagree... robots are not very good business.

	Let's say you buy them for 500cr and sell for 900cr, maybe 1500cr
if you are lucky.

	Or, you could do what I do and buy narcotics for 500cr, sell them for 1200cr, or 3100cr if you are lucky
at the bulliten boards. You make money much faster, and rarely get caught by
police.

	Also, as far as selling all your equipment except autopilot,
that is true it gives you space, but it is not true that you cannot land
on planest. You can land on planets without the atmospheric device if
the planet has no atmosphere.

	I suggest buying narcotics in 70 Ophiuchi and selling them in
either Arcturus or Wolf. However, usually there is a limited supply when 
buying so you have to go to different stations in order to buy 50t or so.



	And when you fight battles, dont use 2 shield generators. Get around
20 of them. :) Much easier to win battles.

Has anyone found a Federation planet that offers a good assortment of
military missions?  Something along the lines of Facece in the Imperial
Systems.  I can sometimes get 7 or 8 missions all to one planet.

Also, has anyone noticed that about half the time when doing an
assassination mission the target never shows up at the appointed time?
This is really annoying...

Also: what is everyone's favorite 'killing' ship?  Since I have 2.5M+ cash
and mainly want to increase my Imperial ranking, I use a constrictor with
class 3 military drive, 5 shields, and 4MW beam.  I can go 15LY with 1 jump
and can usually beat any target to a hyperspace point (usually by a day or
two).

I'm a Corporal/Squire/Competent.  Has anyone gotten Dangerous yet?  I
remember in ELite it took me forever to get to Dangerous.

See ya...

Hello all you legitimate Frontier players,

There seems to be a lot of talk about bugs in Frontier. Well, as it happens
I can get any bug reports you have to David Braben himself. Mail me with
your bugs and I'll make sure he gets the details.

Please state exactly how, when and where the bug occurs and the frequency
of occurance (i.e. every time you play, very rarely, etc.). *THIS IS MOST
IMPORTANT*. Keep your reports concise and to the point.

I will not bother with unclear bug reports, e.g. things such as "I am not
sure how it happened, but once I was hyperspacing somewhere and I pressed
a button (not sure which one) and the game crashed". Virtualy no help at all
to a programmer I'm afraid.

Regards,

Dino Dini

Ok. guys and girls

I just have read the most postings about this GREAT game called
FRONTIER.

How many of you have accelerated machines ?

How many of you use a harddrive and who not, does he complain when
he had to change disks sometimes.

How many of you have more than 1Mbyte of memory.


Think about it and then tell me please, why is there still a need
to sell such a game with one disk and one executable with
~600kbyte.

I still think, it is a good game, but a little more efford on the
game (All those ideas posted in this group should be realized with
on more disk, perhaps a mission disk with a FRONTIER MISSION DISK
PART II in mind) and all of us never had any time to complain about
FRONTIER, because we would never exit the game. 

But now it's no precaution, it's boring.

Please, Mr. Braben, rethink your work, and if you kept the source,
release a Version called THE FINAL FRONTIER.

The actually released version does not look like that.

Bye

Wolfgang

I've just DL'd and viewed the frontier demo and liked it muchly. For those
of you who have it, how similiar is the demo to the actual game? Also, if
it is exactly the same, what detail level is the demo set at? The graphics
did seem to be pretty...well...simple. OH yes....on an unexpanded A500 the
demo moves at a dead crawl...but with a supraturbo 28, the difference is
incredible! I also had some problems getting it to run..I set my stack to
100K and it worked fine.
Ciao!

The demo is straight from the intro sequence of the game, with the
second best detail level (to which Frontier defaults when you start
it). Otherwise, the game look spretty much like the demo (except that
I run it with the highest detail level on my A4000/040, which makes it
somewhat nicer-looking). If the graphics look simple, well, that's
what you get with vector graphics. In my opinion the best thing about
Frontier is that EVERYTHING is done with vectors, from ships to
planets, clouds and smoketrails of missiles. Makes the game very,
well, consistent. I mean, it gives the impression that you really live
in a universe made out of vectors, not that vectors are just used to
represent things that the computer is not able to show.

  The exit patch recently posted works fine, but there is still a
major problem left: Frontier doesn't use OwnBlitter() (or any other
blitter arbitration protocol). If a background program (fx TrapDoor)
outputs something to screen, there is a good chance of a bad blit.
This won't cause just messed up graphics - it will crash the machine.

  It would be nice if 'frontierpatch' fixes this one, too. An easy
solution is to insert OwnBlitter() in the init routine and
DisownBlitter() in exit. This would block any other blitter using
task, but it's better than nothing.

I have just purchased the UK release of Frontier.
 
 In the binary is    Release to Gametek V1.02


The flickering nebula and bulletin board bugs have been fixed.


So either those people complaining are playing an early pirate version 
or should enquire about getting an upgrade.

In the Elite game there were rumoured to be these large generation ships floating
around. Has anyone a positive identification of an encounter with these ships?
Or heard of any story of this?

I once met in Elite (on my oldie C-128) an asteroid ship in the middle of nowwhere
mining on some asteroids. The ship (which was placed VERY close to some asteroids)
was placed out into nowwhere and the percentage of probality that I should have 
found it, would have been very small. 

Anyway since Braben seem to have implemented a lot of library data from the
TRAVELLER and MEGATRAVELLER role playing game, I hope/suppose that in Frontier,
that aliens such as the Zhodani COULD appear. 
Apart from the libray data, it seems also that he has used the explanations of
the hyperspace rules from the RPG and a lot of the trading stuff.

      Well I was aproverbial d**khead wasn't I. I apologize for slandering
     Frontiers like that. I've sussed out most of the controls now and
     am even mostly harmless. This game is just like Elite (!:-)), I mean
     it really does play like Elite and I am completely hooked. 

     As for the "bugs" that other people mention, the ONLY one I know that 
     really is a bug is the bulletin board one and that certainly doesn't mar
     my enjoyment of the game. I mean I the game would lose a certain
     je ne sais quoi if the docking computer was perfect, I mean you can
     just turn it on and off again quickly if you are going to crash and
     it realigns quite nicely.

     This really is a good game ! I have played it for almost 48 hours non stop
     and am really getting into it and it hasn't crashed once. So all you
     gloom mongers, leave it alone, if you can write a game that has a whole
     galaxy ( whether or not you see much of it ) and then allows you to fly to
     a planet land near a house and even see the doors and the windows
     ( London is a massive city in the game by the way), and is still incredibly
     playable, then you might be qualified to criticize, but me I think it is
     really rather splendid. Once I get my big ship I'm going exploring.....

I agree.  The music from the demo (all I have), while not using the best
instrument samples, is still fairly well arranged and not bad for space
flight.  And the timing of the music to the graphics, in the demo, is quite
good.  I agree with the nostalgic feeling comment, too.

Is there any more music in the game, or is the demo music all there is?

There's a total of eight songs. Six of them are classical pieces of music.
The other two are composed for the game.

RIGHT THEN! I FINALLY have this game, and, as I hoped, I can begin to set some of
our 'bug-spotters' right.
FIRSTLY:
THE DREADED LOCKED SPEED VECTOR!!!
I dont know if I have ever come across this bug in truth, but there is a very
simple phenomenon which could explain most of what has been reported. Ladies,
Gentlemen, Neutered Aliens, please look at your speed indicator more closely.
THRILL as, when you reach a high speed in Km/h, it switches to Km/sec!
GASP as you realise that the reason the damn thing takes so long to change is
that it is now showing a unit of speed 3600 times greater! (yes spacecraft can do
some massive speeds, but it takes a LONG while to slow down!) Another thing to do
is- REMEMBER TO TOP UP THAT INTERNAL FUEL TANK. You will get nowhere fast without
engines.
THE "I HAVE TO CLICK THE MOUSE FOR EACH 0.25T OF HULL DAMAGE" FLAW:
Please examine the desk/table/floor at/on which you play the game. You will
notice an object referred to as the KEYBOARD (ooooh!). This device incorporates a
system called AUTO-REPEAT. Therefore, use the keyboard to operate the repair
screen (I haven't found this in my manual yet, mind you. Press the number key
corresponding to the option you wish to pick, eg if REPAIR HULL is the 4th
option, press and HOLD the 4 key. As an aside, this works for most such choices-
I dont know about the screens with more than 9 options)
THE AUTO-PILOT:
Remeber how much cheaper and yet more versatile this is than the original Docking
Computers. It is not MEANT to be infallible. I find, however, that it is pretty
good if time is set to maximum acceleration- then it usually snaps to realtime
just as it gets docking clearance. Other posts have dealt with this in greater
depth, so I wont harp on, but do realise that if you can see yourself about to be
embedded in the station, switching the A.P. off, then on again will normally save
you (it chickens out every time) As a final word on this one, save often. It
can't hurt, and you may have cause to regret it if you don't.
I think thats enough for now....

Yes -- wake up!  It's not a problem, it's REALITY.  In space, when you are
going in very high velocities, you expect to be able to stop on a dime? 
Elite was bad this way, Frontier is correct!  If you use the auto pilot
you'll notice it starts slowing down halfway to the target: that's because
it needs all that time to slow down!  You can't burn it to a location and
expect to just stop.  The only way to stop a spacecraft is to apply a
force in the direction opposite you are traveling.  Since the only force
is your engines, and it's the same engines you used to get going, makes
sense it takes the same time to decellerate, right?  Don't flame what you
don't have a clue about...

Yes.  Indeed, I found it rather amusing after turning off the computer to take
a break from the 4 200+ ton ship assaults to get on the net and find people
talking about meeting 'two ships AT THE SAME TIME!!!' and bemoaning the fact
that there isn't an enemy in the game that can't stand up to a few hits with a
1 MW pulse laser.  For a while I wondered if we were playing the same game at
all.  :)

Yes it is!  WBverlauf messes up the colours in lots of games.  Too bad, I

I tried getting Pagestream to print out a document and then
running Frontier whilst this was going on....

Ran perfectly (killed the frame rate though) and the program was
still there when I quit Frontier....

Great Stuff! All games should be like this.....

I haven't seen generation ships but a friend of mine claims that he
once met something which could have been a generation ship. I think
this was in C64 version - might be Amiga version.

Anyway he met something very large which looked like an asteroid. When
he shot at it bazillions of vipers emerged from the asteroid. When he
used escape capsule he was informed that he is dead when he arrived at
the local coriolis station. He had a saved game so he tried messing
with the big asteroid several times and the only way to survive after
shooting at it was to use galactic hyperdrive.

Jarkko,
Hit the escape key twice to bring up the preferences screen, this will
allow you to customise your game. (BTW I couldn't find it in the manual
either!!)

Another one of those nice features - if a ship has class 8-drive you
are stuck with it... absolutely no way to get rid of it OR to get new
one (say your drive breaks and you fly to station, you can't buy new
class 8-drive cause it's nowhere to be seen for sale)

Also that 'can only remove if same item is around for sale'-thing sucks
IMHO...

I saw the PC demo yesterday, and I have to agree. Before I saw it, I
hoped that the AGA version could have a similar texture mapping. Now I
really hope Braben doesn't include it in the AGA version! It looks
really bad, and above all it is bitmapped, so it has those ugly huge
square pixels on close-ups. I hope the extra speed gained from the
AGA-conversion (mainly from optimizing for >=68020) is used to get
some more vectorised details (adding some simple vectorised textures
shouldn't be too difficult).

Heh, for once it's nice to live in Finland... I just hope I'd have
more time to play my Frontier... :-)

In my manual there are some fuzzy screenshots which I think are from the 
PC version. These show spaceships with with something that looks like 
millitary camouflage (you know, green/brown spots). Why would anyone have his
ship painted like this?? Surly in space a totally black ship would offer the
best protection agains visual observations (black would be ultra-cool too :)

God, Mr Dino 'Paranoid, no one is buying GOAL! cause its the same as all my 
other games, they must all be PIRATING it!!' Dini
I've just read your quote in this months AMIGA FORMAT.
And i've got two words
'FUCK OFF!'
sorry, but i'm getting pissed off with all this shite
The amiga games market will only die if profiteering bastards like yourself
insist that they will stop writing games if all the pirating doesnt stop.
Just because a game you write doesnt sell megashitloads of copies doesn't
mean that everyone who has a cracked copy would have bought it at 30quid 
or whatever.
Just be thankfull that something like GOAL! is selling at all.
I think you'll have something to moan about when GOAL3! doesnt sell one single
copy, and then maybe either the cracking scene will have become too large
OR maybe its just that no-one wants another bloody football game like all the
others!!

Perhaps an email to the author might sort out this problem in a future version
Yeah, I agree, Wbverlauf is one of the best wb progs i've seen in a long time.
A lot better than the crappy grey (gray?) background, or waiting ages for
a picture to load up and take up all my memory.

Anyone got it handy? Failing that i'll look it up in the docs tonight...

Just to fill in the time until he does get it fixed, I suppose you could
make a a script that re-runs Wbverlauf, then frontier, as I recall that
re-running it kill its completely anyway.

The more annoying thing is that when I forget to turn off AswarmII
I loose my cursor after a while!!
I wish Braben had made up his mind, and either had a proper multitasking game
or not one at all.
Then at least none of the nice wb hacks would cause a problem, cause
frontier would kill them all when it ran.

Could the guy who wrote that wonderfull exit patch try and get frontier 
multitasking properly? (I'm not an amiga programmer so I dont know if this
is possible or not, but hey, I can live in hope)

I recall from about a year ago when they all said that frontier would be out
soon (yeah, right guys, good joke!) that there was an interview with braben
(It was a two issue thingy, cant remember the publication name, well, I know
it was a computer mag anyway ;) )
And he seemed to be writing the amiga version (or just frontier) on a pc

Well, it looked like a pc in the picture, you know, large, ugly, orrible colour.

And I agree about the texture mapping, it looks almost as horrible as an ibm pc
itself!!
The only part that looks nicer is the milky way in the background.
It looks a lot better than the Amiga version...

BTW, has anyone with an outdated (sorry, had to be said) machine
(ie bog standard a500) played this yet?
I saw the deom running in Virgin yesterday, and i'm assuming it was a 500
cause it was sooooo bloody slow.
It was about 1fps if it was lucky.
And that was in the space scene.
When it landed on the planet it went down to about .25fps
And Braben is trying to say it was written for an a500?
(Well thats the reason he's giving for it not being as fast as it could on 
machines with proper processors in them ;) )
(You know the ones; those machines where the processor costs MORE than 12quid )
((or was it 8???))
Just glad I upgraded from that piece of shit.

Not an insult to current 500 owners, I mean it was good in its time, but that
was about 7 years ago, and its a bit outdated now.
Even the 68020 in the 1200 is too slow for my liking.
So all I need to do is save up in time for the GVP1230+
(Lovely 50mhz 68030!!!!!)
(None of yer economy versions here m8)

    Uridium 2 is not such a big deal as Frontier, but it's still an

BTW: Wouldn't it be better (faster) if the auto pilot turned your ship around 
halfway to the target and used (the more powerful) rear thrusters to slow down?
This would burn more fuel, but make your journey shorter (time).

Hi people,

I'm currently enjoying a great game of Frontier, but I have a problem :-) and
was wondering if anyone can help...

I took a passenger for a trip, which she refused to pay for, and also it seems,
she refused to leave my cabins becuase my screen says they're occupied. I
cannot sell my ship, or sell the cabins because the game refuses *because they
are occupied*.  How the hell do I get rid of the occupants?

I've tried selling them as slaves :-)
I've looked on bulletin boards for someone who is looking for her.

No joy.

I'm stuck.

Help

Hmm. At least it calls DisownBlitter() in the cleanup, so I assume it
OwnBlitter()'s too..

And I've many friends who have a BBS, and they've played Frontier while
BBS is running on background. No problems, though it's necessary to 
give Frontier priority -1, or the BBS will be quite slow..

You quitted Frontier ??
I have not bought the game up to now, but all people said,
that you *can not* quit it and return to Amiga-DOS.
If you told us the truth, could you please check your Version
and tell us (me) if it is something higher than 1.01 (or just give me
the date of your file).
I would like to buy V2.0 :-).

Right, I got Frontier on Thursday, not one of the bugfixed versions. (btw, if
someone can post a proggy to fix the bugs I'd be most grateful, and also some
code to kill multitasking before frontier starts, so I can play off my HD)

I currently have an Asp Explorer with 2 shield generators, Hyperspace Cloud Analyiser,
and all the other stuff.

Anyway, the best way to earn money is to remove as much as possible from the ship,
and just trade between Barnards Star and Sol, until you get a decent ship, that
can defend itself.

Basically, targetting a ship manually is nigh on impossible, especially if it's
small. It's much easier to point in roughly the right direction, and let the autopilot
line it up properly, then let rip with the guns.

As to the acuracy, I once ran out of fuel heading towards Mars, and ended up being
catapulted around the sun, and out into space. Very impresive (but rather annoying)

Also, I tried to visit this asteroidal body, very close to a red giant, in one of
these multiple star systems, (can't remember the name off hand), but because the
planet was so close to the star, and on the other side, I couldn't get to it, I
suspect because of the gravity of the star being so close. The ship was shaking
all over the place as the autopilot tried to move, and once I switched to manual
the ship started falling back towards the sun before the stabalisers cut in.

In conclusion, the best kind of ship to have is one which is fairly large, and
able to take hard knocks, if you want to fly a smaller ship, you really need to get
to a point where you can cope with the controls.

One last point, stop flaming Frontier because it's not like Elite. The galaxy is
acurate, and impressivly so. It may have been annoying, but after my encounter with 
deep space, I spent ages trying to get it to swing around a star nicely.

I just hope that there *are* aliens out in the furthest reaches, because it'd
be a great pity if there aren't any. Although I suppose if the scientists are to
be belived, finding another inhabited world that has developped space flight will
be very difficult.......

 I just have one simple question.

 How does one trade or deliver parcels to systems that does not
have any starports?

 When I started to solve this problem I noticed on page 45 in the
manual a picture where a communication screen is activated and
one of the options is: "Send message to Mars..". After seeing
this I thought that it probably would solve my problems because
if I could communicate with the planet I could probably get
the information I wanted but I can't figure out how I would
activate this mode.

 Thank you for any information.

Click on the planet until it makes the chime sound and the green squares

    OK a quick astronavigation problem for you. I have been to the Eden
    space station twice. This is around Proxima centauri. The problem is that
    when you jump to Alpha centauri ( the only way I can find to get to
    proxima centauri ) you end up about 900 AU away from proxima. It takes
    a full internal tank of an ASP to get there and it takes about a month.
    Is there any way to jump there ? Is there an easy way? The reason I
    ask is that sometimes you get military missions to Alpha Centauri and Eden is
    the only place to go and it takes ages..........

I haven't found one, but on a related note, how do I get rid of cargo that
I have, that I originally took because it was a well paying military
mission, but when I get to the star system there are no starports!  I even
scoured the planets looking for SOMETHING (there are sometimes small
estblishments) but nothing.  Now I'm stuck with undeliverable cargo. 
There should be a way to jettison it.  Anyways, the moral: look before you
(hyper) leap!

I'd suggest giving the manual a good read.  F'r instance, you can turn
OFF the autopilot to save a LOT of fuel...  Just wait until the
autopilot has aligned itself with the target, and turn off the
engines.  You'll coast towards the target, not using any fuel at all.
(The longer you wait before turning off the engines, the faster the
trip will be, obviously).  Remember to turn the autopilot back on WELL
before you reach your destination.

Maybe you should try the following:
Lift off and fly as close as possible to a sun. This way you can kill
living animals aboard so why not a stubborn passenger?
Not a nice way, but it might work B->

Yes it would. But the autopilot is stupid.
If you think about it, it wouldn't even burn more fuel. You get a fixed amount
of energy from one ton of fuel. This energy is turned to a pushing force by
the thrusters. F=ma <=> a=F/m means that the more force you have pushing a
gievn mass, the greater the acceleration is.
Now, the more powerful main thrusters burn fuel quicker, and push with a
greater force. This force accelerates (or decelerates) the ship quicker, so
you need less time to reach a given speed. This means that when decelerating,
will will stop quicker, ie. may start decelerating later. Now, you can spend
the time won with this either coasting alog, which will not take any fuel,
but you'll still reach your destination faster, or you can accelerate longer,
reaching higher maximum speed, and get there even more faster.

Since the Frontier simulates celestial mechanics quite correctly, there would
be one even more efficient way of moving around: orbits. You would need even
less fuel, and get there in the same or less time.

Hi,
the subject says it all: what ship do you prefer ?

I tried the 
ASP Explorer, BOA Freighter, Python Freighter, Tiger Trader, Puma Clipper
and i am using now the Imperial Trader. I need it for federal military 
missions (I don't like fighting for an imperium which kills its girls ;-). But
the Imp Trader seems to be to slow for most of the missions and the Imp 
Courier is to small, even for some needed weapons & fuel. (I think you need
14-15AU jumps for most of the missions).

Commander Smith, Imp Trader, 2.3Mc, above average

   It's very easy - switch off the Elite-style control emulation, reverse
the up/down direction and then chase after objects with the mouse. Also, as
the manual suggests, switching off the engines helps - you don't end up
being pushed towards objects that you are trying to fire at.

   I thought that the controls [especially the speed controls] were
particularly badly laid out until I worked this out. It would be better
though if you could toggle a "ship control" mode rather than having to hold
down the right mouse button. Also mouse movements should represent
acceleration rather than movement in a given direction, so that you don't
have to keep scuttering around with the mouse to follow things.

   The only trouble is that space combat then becomes trivial, even when
fighting a number of big bastard ships at the same time.

Well, I think it allmost (!) realistic - if the workers of sme prison
planet do not have any kind of idea on what is a military drive or
plasma accelerator, removing it might be difficult, as could be
estimating it's value.

This is one "feature" of the game I can't stand.  I wish you could
actually have a somewhat intelligent conversation with the enemies, e.g.
"What are you doing here?"  "Commander Ickyfoot of the Puke System
ordered me to have you destroyed for <such & such reason>."  That would
be great, but nooooo... *sigh*

I agree.  You got to think about this:  how many Clone people bought a '386
or better so they could play Wing Commander at it's best?  The Amiga needs a
killer game that'll make people want to upgrade.  I think Commodore is in 
financial trouble not because of competition with other platforms, but because
they made machines that are so fun and usable that no one wants to upgrade. :)

Very. The demo is the intro to the game, but everything you see in the intro
(ships, spacestations, planets..) are present in the game, and looks just
the same. It is not just a pretty animation.

The demo runs on the second highest level of detail; on my A3000 I am able to

Hummm... I've still not found my original Elite game, but I distinctly 
rememberit having a silver rainbird on it, and it was _OLD_, from just after 
Elite
was released for the Amiga... And it certainly wasn't a budget game either;
I believe I shelled out the equiv. of 35 pounds for it...

Perhaps some of the britons in this group can shed some light on this;
was Firebird or Rainbird the original name, and which was it which released
budget games?

Hi all,


A friend of mine just received his copy of Frontier (ordered 6 munce ago) and
found out he was running 1.00 instead of 1.02. He has random crashes (screen goes
black, music lingers on) and his settings seem normal :

A4000/030
4MB/80MB
Frontier ico -> stack 65000

Where can he apply for a quick update to 1.02 ? Or should he increase stack size
or something ?

TIA,

Farid Rahmi

P.S.: I buy mine (PC) next Saturday. I *WILL* open the box !

BTW: In the book describing some of the systems they talk about a planet with 
more mass than earth but since it is so small (!?!) it has less gravity (or 
something worded equally stupid). So this means that black holes would have 
no gravity at all (in Frontier ;-) Guess that's why we'ill never see them. 
Too bad that booklet is at home, would be interesting to know who wrote that...

Well I have three bugs, which I think haven't been reported yet.
BUT since one of them could seriously spoil your enjoyment of
this great game, I will suggest a couple of improvements first, 
and get back to the bugs later...

(1) Trading in illegal goods.
Frontier is a game all about money, so the wise player will use
any means available to become rich. one of these is smuggling.
Problem: The fine of 2500 c is far to low. With a big ship and 
lots of hot goods, this will be a drip in the ocean. Also you
can break the law a zillion times, but as long as you pay your
fines, everything is fine (get it:-).
Solution: Increase fines or put a reward on the criminal. This
would be cool, with booty hunters all over the galaxy looking 
for you. It would also be a ranking in itself, like the old 
outlaws in the wild west. 

(2) Space combat
Problem: Too difficult in the beginning, too easy when you get
big ships, and "space combat, what is that?" when you get huge
ships. 
Solution: Bigger better (and more) opponents. So what about those 
with tiny ships being attacked by larger (or several) opponents. 
Well, surrender (ie. surrender over radio and jettison all cargo),
or outrun the larger (and slower) opponents. Also the manual 
mentions something about turrets on bigger ships. I think the 
whole idea about fixed guns is stupid. It is a fighter thing, and
2000 ton vessels shouldn't need to turn around to fire. So turrets
should be on any ship which requires a crew (it would explain them 
too). Crew members could fire independently, get a hit accuracy and
be fired or kept on this basis. The Plasma guns should be kept spinal 
mounted. So what is left for you the pilot? Either you can take over
a turret and blast away, or you could fire missiles, set targets 
(which you gunners would fire at), take evasive action, etc etc.
Now think about it: A heroic plunge towards the Phanter Clipper, 
avoiding all fire and delivering a fatal blow to it (hull < 20%),
and then demanding their surrender, yess yess. 
And those opponents should get some training!!! I once fired my gun
on a surface starport. I watched 4 vipers crash into the ground as
they tried to blast me, and I NEVER EVEN MOVED.


Now to the bugs:
(I have a A4000/40, and all of these happen every time i run it)

(1) When launching from Kohl City (Umicron Eridian [2,0]) you get
no thrust and never leave the ground. You can't dip your nose 
upwards as you have height 0, only turn around. And after a long 
time you explode. This happens every time, but I haven't seen it 
anywhere else. A work around is to speed the game up max when 
launching. 

(2) Has anyone been able to lock onto Pluto in the Sol system map.
It never shows any name, just an empty space in the orbital circle.
If you try to click on it, it never centers. Same problem in other
systems (mostly objects in far orbit).


************************* SPOILER ALERT *************************************

Do not read on if you wish keep enjoying the game!!!!!!!!!1 




























*********************** LAST CHANCE, STOP READING *************************




























(3) In the Cemiess [-2,-2] system the black marked is totally screwed up.
Listen to this: (from Emerald, Camp Lowing)
At Judd's Trading Company, you can get Precious Metals for -3189.0 c 
(notice the '-' sign) and Gem Stones for -564.8 c (again, notice the 
'-' sign). Jesssir, that's right, we will pay YOU 3189 cool credits 
for each ton of filthy gold you can free us from. Dump it, sell it in
a nearby system, we don't care. Just remember when you get back, there
will be more waiting for you!!! 
Christ, I played for about 3 hours and upped my cash from 30000 c to
600000 c switching ship TWICE. Then I got sick of it and headed as far
away as I could get in my Imperial Trader (w/ all the cool stuff you
could ever ask for).

   OK I went exploring last night and reached THE Frontier. I would say I went
   about 70-90 ly in one direction. Do you know what I found ?

   Very little................


   It got quite rough but they only have small ships out there and so we wiped
   'em. I did find a Frontier anarchy world of tourism ( :-) ). It's major
   imports were slaves and narcotics ( :-))))) ). The only things they had
   in at the ship shop were primitive ( but fairly cheap I have to say )
   ( mainly cargo bay pressurisers, and we all know what they are for ).
   Any way it gave a good impression of going somewhere very seedy and was 
   quite atmospheric, but I did get the impression that if I kept going I would

   galaxy is useless unless you like touring empty systems :-( . However if I
   could find rumours of an alien race to find then the hunt would be on, but
   I have a sneaking suspicion that I will not encounter such things. 

   On the whole as I play Frontiers more I see what the Finnish guys complained
   about, but I still think that David Brabben has created a masterpiece of 
   space simulation which I'm glad I spent my money on. However that space needs
   something in it to make it worthwhile exploring and I already know about
   trading and fighting. I might go exploring but I get the impression

   rock', 'no registered settlements'. Or maybe somebody will prove me wrong....

Just a thought, but maybe that's the point.
NO REGISTERED SETTLEMENTS.
Has anyone thoroughly explored one of these systems??

	And also, why can't the panther have a fuel scoop. It's soooooooo

The manual says that drives above class 7 are 'only available from specialists'....

The first time I went there, I ran out of fuel completely, and ended up going
shooting past Proxima into oblivion. I think the thing is, that the system itself
is Alpha Centauri, but, like most of the multiple-star star systems in the game, it
is very big. The hyperspace tends to drop you in fairly close to the centre of the
system, I suspect because in most other star systems, this is where the inhabited
planets are. In the Alpha Centauri system, this isn't the case.

Another notable multi-star system is Achenar, the Imperial capital, it's a rather
long journey to Capitol in that system too.

It occasionally does. The autopilot generally doesn't go very fast, so it can slow
down easily. Try using manual control, and increase your speed as much as possible
towards the auto pilot target, then, when you're fairly close, cut in the autopilot.
It should flip the ship, and use the main drive to try and slow down.

Having got a ship with gun turrets, fighting seems much easier, as the turrets swivel a lot faster, and seem a lot easier to get pointing in the right direction.....

It's not explicitly mentioned in the manual, but in a lot of cases it is possible
to communicate with what your autopilot has targetted, starports, ships or whatever.
Fairly limited number of messages though.

There is a theory that if the exact nature and purpose of the universe is
ever discovered, it will instantly vanish and be replaced by something even
more inexplicable and bizarre.

There is a second theory which states that this has already happened.

Hi,

I have been playing frontier for a long time now (well actually I have only 
had it a couple of days, but many hours of game play have passed ;-)

I am currently rated as competent and have lots of money.

Now the question ,  Having tryed out lots of ships right upto the panther class 
and also imperial traders etc.  I have settled on a cobra Mk III.

Would you please E-mail me recommendations of ship/equipment combination that you
are using and why you like this combination.

Also I would now like to start doing a lot more military missions,  thus I only
require a smallish, fast, moderatly well armed ship, subsequently the cobra mkIII
with a military class 3 drive.  Does anyone have recommendations for a better 
combination.

Regards,
Darren.

    I have a question. Has anybody in the States managed to get this game?
And if you have, where did you get it from? It seems that everybody I called
doesn't have it. Seems Hired Guns, Frontier, and Alien Breed 2 are the main
talked about things here, but actually, I'd like to know more about Alien
Breed 2. I already know a few friends who are interested in getting this game.

Let me get this straight: you had 4 ships attack you AT THE SAME TIME?

Select a starport as your auto-pilot target and press F4 for the
communcations options... it will allow you to send a message to the
station (either "Surrender or Die!" or "Get stock-market listing (1.0C)".

Hmm... that reminds me... has anyone send a surrender message to a ship
and actually gotten other than "Ha Ha"?  I can shoot em down to 1% hull
and still they insist I blow them to smithereens.  The dummies!

Actually, unless the ships have great big lights on the hull, they
shouldn't be visible from any decent distance.  Space is DARK.  The blue
backgrounds should really be black.  In deep space (away from any near
star -- read no solar system) which happens sometimes with a faulty drive,
you shouldn't be able to see anything except the points of distant stars.
I mean if something floated by 10 m from your ship you shouldn't see it
(unless you had a light on it).  But Frontier is a game, and we can't very
well have that.  ;)

I'm not 100% sure about this, but I seem to recall that thrusters use
the mass of the fuel to apply a force. The force is proportional to
the rate of mass loss. The force is found from pushing the mass
out in the opposite direction to the direction you want to move
in, in other words you give some of your momentum to the fuel
which is ejected out you thruster.

I'm not sure if this effects the basic argument though, I can't see
how it would change the fact about needing the same amount of fuel.

I'll think about it if I get a chance.

Hmm, with a sun behind you and looking at a fairly large ship light tends to
bounce off it. Even lookine at a tiny ship, you would see it. Yes, space 
scenery has a rather dull backround (black with some tiny lights), but
that is just because it is so mindboggingly empty. But, sometimes when
you look at a dark object (spaceship) close bright object (star) you would
have a hard time spotting it. (That's why no planetary systems outside sol
has been detected).

Well you have neublas (not sure if I spelled that one correct), generally large
(read: VAST) clouds of dust blown off super-novas. They are quite frequent, and
come in all colors (depending on the materials the dust is made of). They are 
illuminated from within by newborn stars (pretty, pretty) and so don't need to
'have a light at it'.

Wouldn't it block out the background?? Anyway there is always some light
(however weak) which will bounce off the Paladine Super Clipper (which off
course is white).

BTW: Surly we are talking about encounters inside a solar system (ie. fairly 
near a star), since the chances of meeting something out there 'in between'
is just another infinite improperability.

 In all the comparisons made between Warhead and Frontier I have not
yet heard about the most obvious, and in my opinion, most important
aspects of this simulator - the flight control/orientation system.
 
 I have heard that Frontier follows a "Force = Mass x Acceleration"
equation similar to that of Warhead.
How do the two control systems compare?
 
Things I like about Warheads control system:
 
  Relative ease of use. (still requires practice)
Forward/reverse thrusters are represented by left/right mouse buttons.
(the main thrusters vs the retrothrust performance ratio is 6.3g to 1g.)
 
General ship orientation is accomplished via the mouse - although I
much prefer a trackball for this.
 
  Warhead offers manual in addition to auto control of all the following
attitude functions:
 
1. One keypress auto-orients your ship's nose towards the direction of
   motion.
 
2. One keypress auto-orients your ship's nose opposite to your direction
   of motion. (facing rearward)
 
3. One keypress stops your ship automatically via the retro thrusters -
   or if necessary, during high velocity, it about-faces your ship and
   fires the main thrusters to execute a full stop of your momentum.
 
4. One keypress locks your nose onto a designated target, whether your
   moving or not.(I have heard inferences that Frontier has this feature)
 
5. Fine positioning option.
   Inertial dampers are available at a keypress (if you're having REAL
   trouble with drift).  This doubles as an inertialess flight option.
 
6. Auto Fly & Halt.
   This key flys you close to a designated target and parks you there.
   (the ability to preset the distance from target would have been a plus)
 
7. One other really helpful feature is the way the HUD system graphically
   depicts your relative speed/orientation and trajectory. As you travel,
   intially green colored dots on the HUD appear to move towards, across
   or receed into the distance (depending upon your ships orientation).
   As your speed increased in magnitude the dots shifted to blue, then
   on towards red when entering maximum velocity range.
 
 
 IMHO the above are not features but integral ingredients required for a
TRULY effective and intuitive spacecraft orientation/control system.
 
 Warhead has it's bugs, and it does lack the open endedness of ELITE wich
I still dearly love, but it sets a HUGE precedent in my book insofaras
the nav/control system that it utilizes.
 
Is Frontier's control system the be-all-end-all? No room for improvement?
Any Warheader/Frontierman care to indulge in a point by point comparison?
 
I'd like to know if and how the two sims differ in these respects.
 
 An aspect of the original ELITE that impressed me was it's easy to
use/understand point & click intuition interface as well as it's multi
in cockpit views - does Frontier still remain faithful to these tried and
tested conventions?
 
Detail level vs cockpit window size:
 I've read a lot about detail settings in Frontier, but nowhere do I hear
about an option to adjust the size of the 3D action window - after all
the original ELITE had a window size about 4X3"(?) and was VERY playable.
This would open the game up to a potentialy larger market share as well
as speed the game up considerably for many people. (ref. A-10 by Dynamix)

 PS. An honorable mention must be made in regards to one of Warhead's most
realistic military features - a "Mass Driver Cannon" - missile killer that
took real talent to use in dogfights! ..Is such available in Frontier...??

Does it really make much difference with the accelerated time option on?
Unless when you get to the year 3271 your character dies of old age, in which case

On the practical side of things, will Frontier be hard drive installable,
accelerator friendly, OS 2.X plus compliant, *NOT* copy protected, or
Enforcer compliant? The demo was, IMHO, *LAME*, and the strobing of the
colors on the animated objects gave me a headache, as well as the
background color cycling. BTW will the Enforcer hits be missing? I got
over 300 of 'em in just the demo alone (soft reboot with ram: save file).
All in all this *could* be a fine product, providing that the demo is'nt a

The ECS machines can also handle 'texture mapping', another way of

Imagine 2.0 :^) Seems as if these ports are from the Pea-Sea, and 
they don't make use of the custom chipset for this kind of thing. BTW,
 most of my animations run from between 30 and 60 fps (A2500/030/882)

Well, *this* user can wait. I have *ALWAYS* seen new stuff go for 
half to third, or even a fourth of list in just a few months! Take 
Shadow of the Beast III, original retail was $49.95 US, then after 
just 90 days, I picked up a *new* copy for only $14.95 US! A 
considerable savings. Besides, I only buy entertainment s/w that is 
non-linear so that I can enjoy them for as long as I want. Nothing 
worse than getting something, playing it for 4-5 hours, and then 
beating it, and forgeting it. IMHO, anything else is just a waste of 
money, I'll sit back and wait to see what happens in the *REAL* world 
first, instead of the prognostications of those clairyvoyents out 
there in the virtual world ;-7

You can also get to the options screen by clicking the pause gadget twice.

Hmm, are you sure you've found the correct newsgroup?
comp.sys.amiga.idiot.talk would have been more appropriate.
Nobody's forcing you to pay for a game which you don't like, but on the
other hand, if you didn't like it, why would you have a pirated copy?

Just as you can't simply wander into a shop and grab anything that takes
your fancy without paying, you can't use a pirated copy of a computer
game. People like Dino put effort and dedication into their title, and
while you might not like the result, that still doesn't mean it doesn't
hold some value for someone else.

And mind you, the programmers don't receive the full 30 quid you pay in
the shops, only a certain percentage. I'm not a programmer myself, so
I'm no expert, but I'm sure some of the programmers in the group will
back me up on this.

So cut the crap and come back when you've learned to argue sensibly.

Hi!

1. Does anyone know how to use Military Drives in SOL System
without getting illegal, because of transfering illegal radioactive
substances (I have the german version and I am not sure if this
is the correct name for the garbage that will be created after
using military fuel).

2. Has anyone found a way to become legally after doing things
against the law. You can`t use the rescue capsule, like in Elite I.

3. I have found a bug, you can travel very large distances. Try to
move about 100 light years from your position it will work!

Ciao

I have to say that Frontier is pretty shite. Its only plusses is that it has
more involvment and depth than the first one (elite) but David Braben has
really messed up the navigation and flight parts of the game. He should have
stuck to the original game methods, then it would have been awesome.

Simple: Frontier lacks the various autopilot modes in Warhead, and thus 
has inferior control system. Too bad.

Ok listen to this...
Whilst attempting to hyperspace away from Zanoce , I got a message
saying misjump . When I looked at the map I was 1200 light years off
target . At this distance when you look at systems on the map you
are told that no data is avalible and you enter systems at your own
risk..... I couldnt do anything at this stage as I had no fuel left.
What do you make of this?

I've looked around the code. After few hours of peeking
I can say this as 100% sure fact:

There's nothing out there. You can fly arond the 100.000.000 starsystems
if you like, but after few hundred lightyears out of the SOL there's
nothing out there...

(and there's even a bug in that. Try getting system info out of
unexpored place, it shows how many bodies the system contains if you
click the screen like you normally would to see info on planet)

Ask, ask..

And, BTW - How many parcels do I have to deliver before I can begin to do
some serious missions for the military??? And what system has the most
military missions? Sol?

And how come I never find those guys I have a killing-contract on??
I am at the right place at the right time, but no victim shows up.

Misjumps do happen from time to time. I have had at least 3 so far..
But I have never misjumped more than 20LY away from target..

The misjump might get you real far away from the place you jumped from, but
that exceeds the drives limits, and may damage it.

If someone is chasing you through hyperspace, and you can't get rid of him,
try forcing a misjump with alt-f8. The arrival point of misjumps can not be
detected.

 Sorry to be bothering you again but I can't still activate this.
I have tried the folowing things:
1. Targeting Off/On
2. Many diferent ranges (including "landed rough".)
3. Targeting from local map and by clicking with LeftMouseButton(tm).

 If this works for you my copy does have some problems.

Yes, I think there should be option to put autopilot to
optimize for FUEL(would take extremely long to get anywhere as it
would just give your ship small thrust and then go without
engines for most of the journey) or to TIME (use main engines
for acceleration and breaking) .. it could have a slidebar in
some option thing and at lowest setting it would take
months to do 10AU trip to planet and at normal setting itwould
be like now and at fastest possible setting it would burn
engines all the time, turning ship at midpoint...

Of course i'm just dreaming here. In reality, frontier lets you
accelerate manually to very very high speeds and then autopilot
magically stops your ship in no time... (read one of my bug
reports for more specific description)
