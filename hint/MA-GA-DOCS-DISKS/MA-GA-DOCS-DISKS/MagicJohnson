      In case you were having trouble with this you need to boot up
      with the Majic Johnson's MVP disk and install each module separately.
      Click on the module you want to install and then click on the
      install button and it will install these other modules for you.

      The module's cracked by Skid Row were the SBA League disk and the
      Side-View Modules.  The ones released by Classic are the College
      League and the End View.  So you should be able to install all modules
      except for the Pro Side-View, Pro End-View, Fantasy League, and Print
      Utility.

      To play a particular module just click and the module you want and
      click on the play button.  Its that simple!

      If you try to use the disks through workbench it will only allow you
      to update your masters!
