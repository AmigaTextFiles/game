         Ok dudeS the shit isn't cOmpLete but it will be useful anyway Oh!
   
   Thre game is in German.. But you dudes can still play it because I am 
 gonna tell ya how.


             First when you get to a screen where you see 4 guys
    Well here you must click in the string box at least once and put your
 name!
    Then pick another dude to make him the Amiga #1.  You do that by
 clicking the left box next to the string box! OK?

                     AFTER YOU HAVE YOUR GUYS PICKED
          
    Well now you hit the RIGHT mouse button and then you will see a 
 little loader box! At the loader box you should pick the YELLOW BOX FAR
 LEFT  and then you begin play... Hmm I havent't really played this shit yet
 because it just came out last night!  But now you can see the shit and 
 play it!

                         NOTE TO TARKUS TEAM

    Dudes... You should release the NTSC and make sure the load routine
 works!  We here in the STATES like games also!
    This is not a slam. Just a reminder.  Plus we would like to keep
 seeing more cool shit from you guys... OK LATERZ DUDEZ
