INSTALLATION GUIDE

Before you can use the SimCity Graphics, they must be installed.  The
install Graphics Program updates your SimCity program and installs
the new Graphics to either your hard or floppy disk.  Once you have
completed the installation, you will be able to switch between
Graphics from within SimCity.

WHAT YOU NEED

In order to complete the installation, you will need to know:

   o Whether you are installing to a hard disk or to floppy disks.
   o In which drive and subdirectory (hard disk users only) your
     current SimCity files are located.

In addition, you will need the following:

For FLOPPY installation:

   o Your backup disk of your original SimCity disk
   o The SimCity Graphics disk
   o One blank formatted disk

For HARD DISK installation:

   o The SimCity Graphics disk
   o 185K free hard disk space for each of the new Graphics you install

INSTALLING TO A HARD DISK

Make sure that you already copied the contents of the original SimCity
disk to a subdirectory on your hard disk.

Place the SimCity Graphics disk in your drive.  Double-click with your
mouse on the SimCity Graphics disk icon.  A window will pop up
containing the SimCity Graphics program icons.  Double-click on the
INSTALL GRAPHICS icon.

For the installation type, click on HARD DISK.

Enter the PATH where your SimCity files are located.  Usually, your
SimCity files are in the path WORK:SIMCITY.  If this is the correct
path, just click on the CONTINUE button.  If your SimCity files are
not in WORK:SIMCITY, press the Right Amiga key and the X key at the
same time to erase the path.  Then type in the correct path (for
example:  WORKBENCH:SIMCITY, dh0:SIMCITY, dh1:SIMCITY, etc) and
click on CONTINUE.

Use the mouse to select any or all of the new Graphics for installation.
If you have the space available on your hard disk, we recommend 
installing them all.

The Install Graphics program will now transfer the new Graphics files
to your SimCity subdirectory.

You are now ready to play.

To run your SimCity program with new Graphics, open the drawer where
your SimCity files are located, then double-click on the SimCity icon.

To change Graphics, go into the EDIT window, open the FILE menu,
and select LOAD GRAPHICS.  Next, select an alternate architecture
and watch as your city transforms into a new era!

INSTALLING TO FLOPPY DISKS

Make sure that you already have a backup copy of your original SimCity
on a floppy disk.  To create a backup disk, insert your original
SimCity disk and click on the disk icon.  Select "duplicate" or "Copy"
from the menu.  Switch disks as prompted.

Format one blank floppy, if you haven't already done so, and label it:

       SIMGRAPHICS DISK

Please have all of your disks ready before you begin the Install
Graphics program!

Place the SimCity Graphics disk in your drive.  Double-click on the
SimCity Graphics disk icon.  A window will pop up containing the
SimCity Graphics program icons.  Double-click on the INSTALL GRAPHICS
icon.

For the installation type, click on FLOPPY.

The program will now begin updating your backup copy of SimCity
(your Program disk) and building the new Graphics disk.  Please insert
the correct disks when prompted.

You are now ready to play!

To run your SimCity program with new Graphics, insert your updated
SimCity backup disk in the floppy drive and double-click on the disk
icon.  When the SimCity program window opens, double-click on the 
SimCity icon.

To change Graphics, first insert the new Graphics Disk in your floppy
drive.  Go into the EDIT window, open the FILE menu, and select LOAD
GRAPHICS.  Next, select an alternate architecture and watch as your
city transforms into a new era!

NOTES:

o SimCity Graphics has NO DISK-BASED COPY PROTECTION!  See below for
  more information.  
o We recommend that you play from backup copies of your SimCity
  Graphics disks.  Store your original SimCity Graphics disk and
  your new SimCity Program and Graphics disks in a safe place.
o TERRAIN EDITOR users:  While creating or editing a city terrain
  using your Terrain Editor program (not included) you can only
  view your cities in the original SimCity Classic Graphics.  However,
  you may create or edit a terrain with the Terrain Editor, save it,
  then load it into SimCity.  You will then view your terrain in the
  currently active graphics.
 
NO DISK-BASED COPY PROTECTION!

Versions of SimCity prior to Version 1.2 used disk-based copy protection.
With SimCity Graphics, we have taken the protection off the disk, and
put it onto a lookup chart.

   [Note: If you have been running Version 1.2 or later of SimCity, you
   have already been using the "lookup chart" system of copy protection.]

The lookup chart is a RED SHEET OF PAPER, included in the SimCity
Graphics package.  WARNING!  DO NOT LOSE THE RED SHEET!  YOU CANNOT PLAY
THE GAME WITHOUT IT.

Here's how it works:

Shortly after starting SimCity, you will be asked for either the NAME
or the POPULATION of a city, and you will be shown three symbols.  The
first symbol is the page number - find the page on the RED SHEET that
has that symbol in the upper right hand corner.

Look at the other two symbols, then look down the columns on that page
until you find them next to a city name.  Type in the appropriate 
information - check the window on the screen to see whether you 
should enter the NAME or the POPULATION of the city - and press <return>.

You will have three chances to get it right.  It is very important -
the lives and welfare of many Sims depend on you getting this right.
