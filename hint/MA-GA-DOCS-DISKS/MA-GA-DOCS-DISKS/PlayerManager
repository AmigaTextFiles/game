     WELL HERE IT IS MATES....HOPE YOU ENJOY THE GAME!!!!

     THE INTRODUCTION IS A BIT LONG WINDED..SO IVE PICKED OUT THE BITS
     THAT COUNT.

     1) AN INTERNATIONAL PLAYER CAN USE HIS IMMENSE SKILL AND EXPERIENCE
        TO GAIN HIS CLUB PROMOTION SWIFTLY! FURTHER SUCCESS REQUIRES A
        BALANCED TEAM AND WINNING TACTICS.
        FINANCIAL CONTROL OF THE TEAM RESTS WITH THE BOARD.THERE ARE OVER
        1000 PLAYERS IN THE TRANSFER LEAGUE.
        EACH PLAYER IS AN INDIVIDUAL WITH SEVERAL UNIQUE ATTIBUTES AND
        PLAYING SKILLLS. THE ACTUAL MATCH USES A REFINED VERSION OF KICK OFF, 
        RETAINING THE PACE,CONTROLS AND THE GAME PLAY.
        THE PLAY LASTS 5 MINS EACH WAY AND THE MANAGER IF HE SELECTS HIMSELF
        CAN PLAY IN THE GAME. HE CAN CONTROL THE PLAYER NEAREST TO THE BALL
        OR PLAY IN HIS DESIGNATED POSITION/ ONLY IN HIS ASSIGNED POSITION
        WILL HE PLAY AS AN INTERNATIONAL CLASS PLAYER. HE CAN SUBSTITUTE
        THE PLAYERS AND CHANGE THE TACTICS WHEN THE BALL GOES OUT OF PLAY
        IF WATCHING THE MATCH INSTEAD OF PLAYING IN IT, HE HAS THE OPTION
        TO WATCH ANY ONE PLAYER ON THE FEILD,AND STUDY HIS GAME PLAY IN
        DEPTH, AN INVALUABLE FACILITY TO STUDY A PLAYER ON THE TRANFER MARKET

        BUY PLAYERS, IF EXTRA MONEY IS REQUIRED HE MUST SEEK THE BOARDS
        PERMISSION. THE BOARD MAY ALSO ASK HIM TO SELL PLAYERS IN ORDER TO
        HELP WITH THE CLUBS FINANCES.
        THE MANAGER CAN GREATLY IMPROVE HIS TACTICS OF SUCCESS BY PAYING
        GREAT ATTENTION TO THE PLAYER INFORMATION, THE PLAYER ATTRIBUTES
        AND SKILLS CHANGE WITH EXPERIENCE AND TRAINING. A PLAYER IMPROVES
        IN SKILLS ASSOCIATED WITH HIS PLAYING POSITION. YET HIS TALENTS MAY
        LIE ELSEWHERE. THE MANAGER MAY EXPERIMENT BY TRAINING A PLAYER IN A
        POSITION AND PERHAPS DISCOVER A REAL HIDDEN TALENT. THE REAL TASK
        OF THE MANAGER IS TO UNDERSTAND HOE EVENTS CAN AFFECT THE MORALE OF
        AN INDIVIDUAL OR THE WHOLE TEAM AND THE MEASURE HE MUST TAKE TO
        COUNTER THE AFFECT. THE MANAGER MUST BE AWARE OF HIS OWN CONTRIBUTION
        TO THE TEAM AS A PLAYER, WHEN TO HANG UP HIS BOOTS FINALLY, IS THE
        MOST IMPORTANT DECISION HE WILL MAKE.
        THE MANAGER MUST AT ALL TIMES PAY DUE ATTENTION TO THE INDIVIDUAL
        PLAYER MORALE AND THE TEAM MORALE NOTIFIED IN THE COACH REPORT, THE
        MORALE EFFECTS THE INDIVIDUAL AND TEAM MORALE.

        AND COACH TO KEEP THE MABAGER INFORMED. IT ALSO DISPLAYS IMPORTANT
        NEWS ITEMS WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE A DIRECT BEARING ON MANAGERS
        DECISIONS, HE MUST AT ALL TIMES PAY ATTENTION TO THE MESSAGES,
