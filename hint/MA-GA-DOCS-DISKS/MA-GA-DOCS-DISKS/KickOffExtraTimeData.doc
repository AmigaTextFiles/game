                      ===============================

INTRODUCTION:
The  Extra  Time is an expansion disc for Kick off and provides a number of
enhancements  to  the  original  game.  The pace at all the five levels has
been  increased,  though the difference in pace between the levels has been
reduced.   New attributes of skill in passing, shooting and tackling play a
more  decisive  role in determining the skill level though the teams at the
National level retain some players of International class.

Addition  of  four  new tactics gives the players a choice of eight tactics
altogether.   There is also a choice to play in one of the three leagues at
the  Reserve,  National  or International level.  Four new playing surfaces
are provided which together with the normal Kick Off playing surfaces gives
a  choice  of  five  playing  surfaces.  The playing surfaces have a marked
influence  on the bounce, speed and travel of the ball and also affects the
pace  and  stamina  of  the  players.  Another factor to influence the ball
while it is in the air is the wind.  The strength of the cross wind and its
up and down pitch vector are given.

The  instinctive  control  method of Kick Off has been retained totally but
enhanced  to control the power of the shot and alter its direction from the
direction of player movement.  Similarly, the player can control the keeper
if he so wishes for Goal Kicks.  There is a choice of 9 kicks.

A  new  set  of  Referees  have  been  introduced  to control the game more
effectively  at  the higher levels.  Bring down the opponent at your peril.
You have been warned!

ATTRIBUTES
Accuracy  attribute  in Kick Off has been replaced by three new attributes,
namely  Shooting,  Passing  and Tackling skills.  These attributes together
with  Pace,  Aggression and Stamina give more individuality to the players.
The new attributes play an important part in determining the skill level of
the  players.  The new pace of the players at all levels has been increased
and the difference in pace between the levels has been reduced.

PLAYER CONTROLS
The  player  controls  remain exactly the same as in Kick Off but with some
enhancements.

STOPPING THE BALL
Press  FB  before  touching  the ball.  The ball will stop and is now under
player control.

PASSING
Stop  the  ball.   Move  the joystick in the direction you wish to pass and
release the FB.

DRIBBLING 
The  ball  travels in front of the player.  The distance it travels depends
on the speed of the player when he makes contact with the ball.  The MARKER
line  under  the  player  will turn white as soon as the player touches the
ball  and turn black pixel by pixel.  The process is repeated each time the
player touches the ball.

SHOOTING
Press the fire button after touching the ball.  The strength of the shot is
determined  by  how  many pixels of the marker line are white.  The greater
the  number  the  more  powerful  the  shot.  Timing is all important.  The
direction  of  the  shot can also be changed by moving the joystick left or
right,  up  or  down.   The change in direction will be perceptible but not
vast.

KEEPER CONTROL
The  Keeper  control  for  defending  the  penalties remains the same.  The
player  is  also  given the control of the keeper for goal kicks., if he so
desires.   To  keep the game flow, if the player fails to exercise control,
the  computer  assumes  the keeper control as in Kick Off.  The player must
therefore  exercise  the  option  quickly and well before the computer goes
into default mode.

There are nine types of goal kicks:


                              HARD AHEAD
                    HARD LEFT           HARD RIGHT
           MEDIUM LEFT       MEDIUM AHEAD       MEDIUM RIGHT
                    SOFT LEFT           SOFT RIGHT
                              SOFT AHEAD

Move  the  joystick  in  the  required  position before the keeper kicks or
throws the ball.  Press the fire button to quickly boot the ball upfield to
catch  the  opponents  out of position or to stop keeper wasting time.  Use
the scanner to select the direction and type of goal kick.
