                              GAME MANUAL

HOW TO READ THIS MANUAL

Throughout this manual we will use the following ways of representing
information:

Menu Commands will be CAPITALIZED.  Example: SAVE, RESTORE, QUIT, PLAY

Type commands will appear as bold type.
   Example: 'type cd\sierra`

Portions of the command line not meant to be typed will not appear
in bold type.  For example, in the line 'type cd \sierra`, 'type`
should not be typed.

[Keystrokes] will appear in brackets setting them off from the
surrounding text.
   Example: [Spacebar], [Tab], [PageUp]
The brackets are not keystrokes and should not be typed.

Two or more keys that should be pressed together will be separated by
a hyphen (-).  This hyphen is not a keystroke, and should not be
typed.
   Example: 'Press [Ctrl-I] to view your inventory.`

If a space appears between parts of a command, it is meant to be typed.
   Example: 'type cd \sierra` (the space between cd and \sierra should be
   typed as part of the command)

The term 'diskette` is used to refer to either 3.5" or 5.25" data
storage disks.

Saving Your Game

IMPORTANT!! If you do not wish to save to your hard drive, you must have
a separate formatted diskette ready before you can save a game.  Since 
each disk can only hold a limited number of games, we recommend that you 
have more than one disk formatted, in order to assure adequate space for
save game storage.  To allow for errors in judgement and creative 
exploration, we recommend that you frequently save your game in progress, 
and that you save several different games from different points as you play.
You will always want to save your game before encountering potentially
dangerous situations.  You should also save your game after you have
made significant progress.  You may name your saved games using standard 
English phrases.  For example, if you are standing on a beach, you might 
call you game 'standing on beach`, or simply 'beach`.

Saving to a Floppy Disk

1. Choose the System icon (slide lever) from the icon bar, then select
   SAVE.  The Save Game menu will appear.
2. If you are playing from a hard drive and saving to a floppy drive,
   you will be prompted to insert your Save Game diskette into your 
   floppy drive (example: a:).
   PLEASE NOTE: The first time you attempt to save a game to a floppy
   disk while playing from the hard drive, you will need to change your
   default save game directory as follows: using your [Tab] key,
   select CHANGE DIRECTORY.
3. Press [Ctrl-C] to clear the command line, and type the name of your
   floppy drive.
4. Insert a blank formatted diskette in your floppy drive.
5. Select OK, and press [ENTER].
6. Type the description of your save game, and press [ENTER] to save
   the game.
* The term 'directory` refers to directories, drawers and folders.

Saving to Hard Disk

NOTE: If you choose to save games to your hard disk, we suggest that you
create one or more save game directories or folders on your hard disk.
See your computer's instructions for creating directories.

1. Choose the System icon (slide lever) from the icon bar, then select
   SAVE.  The Save Game menu will appear.
2. If you wish to save the game to a directory * other than the one you 
   are currently playing on, select CHANGE DIRECTORY *.  Press [Ctrl-C]
   to clear the command line, and type the drive and name of the new
   directory * .
3. Select OK, and press [ENTER].
4. Type the description of your saved game, and press [ENTER] to save the
   game. 

Restoring Your Game

1. Choose the System icon (slide lever) from the icon bar, then select
   RESTORE.  You will be prompted to select the game you wish to
   restore.
2. Highlight the desired game and select RESTORE.
3. If the game you wish to restore is in a different directory, select
   CHANGE DIRECTORY, then type the name of the directory * you wish to
   restore from.

* The term 'directory` refers to directories, drawers and folders.

Quitting Your Game

To stop playing, choose the System icon from the icon bar (slide lever)
and select QUIT.

Restarting Your Game

To restart your game at any time during play, choose the System icon
(slide lever) from the icon bar and select RESTART.

Message Windows

Message windows will appear at various times during the game.  When
you have read the message, press [ENTER] to remove the window and
resume play.

NOTE: Some message windows are program controlled, and cannot be cleared
by pressing [ENTER].  These windows will clear automatically, 
dependent on your text speed setting (see TEXT LEVER, page 20).

TIPS FOR ADVENTURERS

LOOK everywhere.  Thoroughly explore your surroundings.  Open doors
and drawers.  Look closely at all objects you encounter or you may
miss important details.  EXPLORE each area of the game very carefully, 
and DRAW A MAP as you progress through the game.  Make a note of each 
area you visit, and include information about objects found there and 
dangerous areas nearby.  If you miss an area, you may miss an important 
clue!

GET objects you think you will need.  You can see an inventory of
items on hand by choosing the Inventory icon at any time.

USE the items you have picked up to solve problems in the game.  
Different approaches to a puzzle may bring about a different outcome.

BE CAREFUL, and remain alert at all times - disaster may strike in
the most unlikely of places!

SAVE YOUR GAME OFTEN, especially when you are about to try something new
or potentially dangerous.  This way, if the worst should happen, you 
won't have to start all over again from the beginning.  Save games at 
different points, so you will always be able to return to a desired 
point in the game.  In effect, this will enable you to travel backward 
through time and do things differently if you wish.

       My limo just arrived at the curb outside the airport, where
       should I go?

       Hint:
       You can go two places; inside  the airport, and to the Automatic

       How do I board the plane?

       Hint:

      by clicking the Hand icon on it.

      Problem:
      What do I need to get from Reverse Biaz.

      Hint:
      He'll give you a cassette tape. You should have the gold record.
      You should have  played the record forward and  backwards on the
      stereo at 78 RPMs to hear the subliminal messages.
