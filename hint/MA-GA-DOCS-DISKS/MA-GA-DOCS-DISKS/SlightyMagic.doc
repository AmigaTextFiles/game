              SLIGHTLY MAGIC From CODEMASTERS Documentation 
              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
LOADING
-------

For A500 + A500 plus user's switch ON computer and insert disc immediately
For A1000 user's LOAD kickstart 1.2/1.3 as normal then insert disc on
workbench prompt.

SLIGHTY MAGIC
-------------

Bigwiz the wizard has left the castle in a hurry, in order to turn the
King's son Newton back into a frog.  Indeed, he was in such a hurry that 
he forgot to pack his spare wand, forgot to lock his laboratory door, and
most importantly, forgot to return his utterly stupid, idiotic, incompet-
ant, brain-dead nephew SLIGHTY to his parents' mud hut in the hills.
Oh well, it could be worse.  A sunburnt dragon could be running off with
the beautiful Princess Croak as we speak.  The wizard's spell cabinet
might have been knocked over by a flaming Octarian Whirlwind, scattering
spells everywhere.  His kingliness the King might, in a fit of blind
panic, have given SLIGHTY the wizard's private spell book to read.  It 
might rain.  Yoo see, it could be worse.  But as it is, there's not a
cloud in the sky, a breeze in the air, or a whiff of dragon's breath to
be sniffed.
Hang on, where's that pink fire-breathing creature going with that 
screaming princess? Is that a gentle wind wafting in through the door, or
is it something stronger?
Oh no.  Get the washing in mother, and lock  all doors.  Cancel the papers
and shoot the cow.  I think it's going to be one of those days...

HINTS
-----

The aim of the game is to rescue the beautiful princess Croak from the 
sunburnt dragon.  To do this you'll need to use the various spells and
objects scattered throughout the game.  You start the game with 3 lives.
Collecting stars increases your magic powers.  Collect 20 stars to gain
an extra life.  You can't travel safely underwater unless you become a
fish!  Certain areas will be out of reach until you can change into a bird!
Watch out for fires, spikes and banana skins!

SPELLS & OBJECTS
----------------

Pressing SPACE/FIRE when you're standing over an object or spell will make
SLIGHTY pick it up.  Pressing SPACE/FIRE at any other time will show you a
list of what you're carrying.  You can select an item to use or drop by
pressing up/down to highlight it and then pressing fire.  To use any of the
spells you'll first need to collect the magic wand and read the spell book.
Each spell needs to be activated by picking up an object to complete its
recipe.
