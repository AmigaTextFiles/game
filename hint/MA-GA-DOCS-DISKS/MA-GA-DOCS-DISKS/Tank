******************************************************************************
                             I. INTRODUCTION
******************************************************************************

MISSION SELECTION SCREEN
************************
This screen allows you to select your mission for this game. You can select
missions from three different areas: Fort Knox (training missions), Germany
(European missions) or Israel/Lebanon (Middle East missions).
   The screen initially gives you a map of the Fort Knox area and a list of
the possible Fort Knox missions. Move the highlight to the Fort Knox title at
the top of the menu with the up and down arrow keys and hit Enter to bring up
the map of the Central Europe area and the mission list for that area. To get
to the Middle East missions, highlight and choose the Central Europe Title,
and so forth. As you highlight a mission, a capsule description of the mission
appears at the bottom of the screen. Hit Enter to pick the mission you have
highlighted. The missions are described further in Chapter III - Missions.
   The missions are sequential. If you wish to play an entire campaign (or
training regimen), play the missions in the order listed. Your score in the
game is strictly mission specific; there is no overall campaign score.

GAME CONFIGURATION SCREEN
*************************
Once you have selected your mission, you proceed to the Game Configuration
Screen. The Game Configuration Screen establishes the parameters of the game
you will be playing. Tank icons initially designate the default option for
each menu and move to your selected option.
   The top of the screen display tells you what area you are playing in and
what the mission is. Beneath that are five Menus. Use the arrows keys to
highlight the menu and selection you wish.

PLAY LEVEL MENU
***************
TANK can be played at one of three levels of difficulty, depending on the
expertise of the player. The higher level of difficulty used, the higher the
potential score for the player.

BEGINNER - This level id for the beginner to the game. A beginner game is like
a tactical exercice fought to give the player some idea of what the equipment
can do without the complications of the real world. The Beginner player has
two advantages:
   Perfect Info: All enemy eqipment and movement is displayed on whatever
screen you are looking at. You know at all times the enemy's location and what
they seem to be doing. There is no need to use the Recon function of the HQ
menu, and the Drone Screen shows everything possible every time you use it.
   Daytime Conditions: The battle conditions are assumed to be clear daylight,
with perfect viewing conditions.

INTERMEDIATE - The more experienced commander can fight an intermediate
battle. There are some differences in what the commanders know which adds to
the complexity and realism of the conflict.
   An intermediate game is like a peacetime wargame fought to try to simulate
the problems of fighting a battle in a real world situation. However, some
complexities cannot be duplicated outside of actual combat.
   Close to Perfect Info: Now you must use the Recon function of the HQ menu
to determine the placements of the enemy, and you can use the Drone Screen to
search the battlefield as if you were using a reconnaissance drone. However,
the Drone Screen may not show everything it passes over, as it takes into
account enemy attempts at camouflage.
   Reduced Visibility Conditions: The time day becomes a factor. Recon and Air
Support missions have trouble with nighttime conditions.

ADVANCED - The experienced commander can fight the Advanced game, which
duplicates most of the hazards of combat.
   Less Than Perfect Info If Recon Plane is Used: Now, use of the Recon
function will probably give partly erroneous or incomplete information,
simulating the problems of human error in warfare. The Drone Screen connot be
used.
   More Skilled Enemies: Adding to the difficulty is the increased shooting
and movement ability of the enemy troops and their improved war plans,
replicating the intricacies of standard Soviet strategy as much as possible.

THE ICONS
*********
The icons you see on the mission map screens are based on the traditional
military icongraphy for displaying units in a two-dimensional setting.
 _______
|  ___  | Armored Unit (tanks)
| /   \ | (An oval circle, not filled)
| \___/ |
|_______|

 _______
| \___  | Armored Cavalry (IFVs)
| /\  \ | (An oval circle, with an diagonal)
| \_\_/ |
|____\__|

|       | Engineers/Trucks
|  ___  | (An E facing down)
| | | | |
|_______|

 _______
|  ___  | Towered Artillery
| /   \ | (A filled circle)
| \___/ |
|_______|

Aircraft, on the other hand, are shown as overhead silhouettes.

TIME SETTING MENU
*****************
Ths allows you to decide the basic visibility conditions you are working
under. Specify whether you are starting out in DAY time (considered to be
about 7:00 AM), NIGHT time (considered to be about 10:00 PM) or the DEFAULT
time, which is preset in the game.
   During the day, you have greater visibility (as does the enemy) and your
reconnaissance missions are more likely to be successful (as are his). Night
gives you more concealment but more confusion.
   You choose.

PLAYERS SCREEN
**************
   Single: This is the default selection for this menu. It recognizes the
usual situation, one player against the computer.
   Multiple: If you want to play with more than one player, using more than
one computer with cable or modem hookups, select this option. This activates
the:

MULTIPLE PLAYERS SCREEN
***********************
If you want to play against another player, this option allows you to fight
the other player directly, with one taking th M1 or larger NATO force and the
other taking a Russian force or individual T-80. Use this screen to set up the
game for a player on each side of the mission. See the Addendum for
instructions on how to use this screen.
   Note that if you are playing another player in an individual tank game, you
are both essentially using M1s, no matter what mission you choose. The
interior screens each of you sees are those for the M1 tank, even though the
exterior views of one of the tanks are those of a Russian T-80.

CONTROLS MENU
*************
This chooses your movement and aiming interface with the computer Whether you
pick the joystick or keyboard, you still have complete keyboard use.

USING A JOYSTICK
****************
The joystick can be used in place of most of the functions of the number pad
in most of the screens, particularly the functions of the arrow keys and
Spacebar. Thus, it can be used to turn the tank and turn and aim the tank gun.
The joystick button can be used to fire the main gun. Other functions (see
next chapter) are still controlled by the keyboard.

IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A NUMBER PAD
*******************************
If your keyboard does not have a number pad, you can use certain letters,
arranged in a similar configuration, instead.

I = 8 or arrow up
U = 7
J = 4 or arrow left
N = 1
O = 9
K = 5
L = 6 or arrow right
M = 2 or arrow down
, = 3

START GAME MENU
***************
EXIT TO DOS - This takes you out of the game and back to DOS. From this point,
you must start the game over if you wish to continue playing.

SHOW SCORES - This takes you to the Top Score Screen to see the current five
best scores for this mission.

CHANGE MISSION - Choosing this option takes you back to the Mission Area
Selection Screen to choose a new mission, as previously descibed.

BEGIN GAME - Check the defaults described above. If they are satisfactory,
choose this option (the default as you come into the screen) and immediately
begin play. Otherwise, you must choose the options you wish and then use this
command to start the game. This takes you to the ARMAMENT SCREEN.
   Once you have started the game, go to Chapter II - HOW TO PLAY.

ARMAMENT SCREEN
***************
Once you pick your mission, the computer shows you the Armament Screen. This
gives you the choice of the main anti-tank armament for the tanks available to
you.
   PLATOON lets you equip all platoons the same, or equip each uniquely.
Strike + or - (or arrow left or arrow right) to switch the choice between ALL
or each platoon by number.
   Russian T-80s and many upgraded T-72s are well protected against HEAT
rounds. If you will be faced mostly other tanks, take mostly SABOT rounds.
Use arrow up or arrow down to go up and down the menu. The numbers given are a
default mix of HEAT and SABOT. You can accept this mixture by moving the
highlight to DEFAULT and pressing Enter to go out of this screen and accept
the default shells for all tanks, no matter what choices you have made before
using DEFAULT.
   To change the ammo mix, move the highlight to either HEAT or SABOT and use
the + and - (or arrow left or arrow right) to increase or decrease the number.
The other number will compensate to keep the total equal to the total possible
shells. When you have a mix you like, move the highlight to LOAD and strike
Enter to set the mix, then move to BEGIN and hit Enter to proceed to the game.


******************************************************************************
                             II. HOW TO PLAY
******************************************************************************

HOW TO PLAY
***********
TANK can be played on one of three levels: the Battalion Operations Level the
Platoon Tactical  Level and the Individual Tank Level. The  player can be the
Battalion commander sending his platoons out to engage the enemy, the platoon
leader taking his four tanks out to fulfill the dictates of the Battalion
colonel, or the Individual tanker trying to perform his tasks and stay alive
at the same time.
   In any one game, the player can play just one of these roles or all three
(actually five, since there are three different positions to play in the
individual game).

   Once you have begun play by entering BEGIN GAME on the Game Configuration
Screen, you are ready to play the game on any level. First, we will deal with
the Operations Level.

THE COLONEL
***********
You look over your map. Your battalion has been given the job of defending
twenty miles of German countryside. Somewhere out there, according to S-2, a
Soviet armored regiment is on its way. You look at the tanks you have
available and the map of the region division wants you to defend. You take
another gulp of coffee and start to plan...

OPERATIONS LEVEL GAME
*********************

MAIN MENU AND MAP F1
Map Colors
Black - Road network
Red - Highest ground
Dark Green - Low ground
Brown - High ground
Light Green - Lowest ground

This screen shows the whole battle area, where the enemy tanks are, where your
tanks are, where the targets are, etc. It tells you how the battle is going,
where you want to move your tank platoons, and where to call for support.
   This screen can be called from most other screens by pressing F1; an entire
operational level game can be played on this screen by going only to the
subscreens on this menu.
   Tank icons on the screen show the location of each platoon. Other icons
show aircraft, enemy tank platoons and objectives. One platoon icon is
highlighted. The Main Menu gives you keys to strike to determine information
about the highlighted icon or move to another platoon.

MAIN MENU
*********
Striking a button on this menu takes you to another menu that deals with some
aspects of the platoon's operations.

MOVE - takes you to a menu that deals with the planned path of the platoon.

SPEED - takes you to a menu that deals with the speed of the platoon.

FORMATION - takes you to a menu that deals with the tactical formations of the
platoon.

HQ - takes you to a menu that deals with the platoon's interface with
battalion and brigade headquarters.

INTELLIGENCE - takes you to a menu that deals with information about the
mission, including a grid map and estimates of enemy units and friendly units
destroyed.

ZOOM -  takes you to a menu that allows the commander to "zoom in" on any area
on the map to get a better idea of the terrain, surrounding units, and so
forth.

NEXT PLATOON - allows you to select and direct an icon (representing a platoon
of tanks or AA vehicles). One icon is automatically highlighted. To select
another icon, push this key and it highlights the next icon in order.

NEXT TANK - allows you to choose which tank of the four listed below you wish
to see on the Tank Info Screen.

TANK INFO - takes you to a screen that gives information about the layout and
functions of the tank and credits for the tank game.

DETACH/ATTACH - allows you to either detach the tank selected on the Next Tank
option from the platoon or attach it to the platoon if it is already detached.
A detached tank operates on its own and must be given individual orders,
rather than following the orders given the rest of the platoon.

EXIT GAME -  takes you out of the game. If your current score is the highest
for that mission, you will see the Awards Screen with the new score.

TANK STATUS SELECTOR -  This menu allows you to go to another menu to give
individual orders to each tank in a platoon. Use 1 to toggle between the
tanks.

TANK INFO SCREEN
****************
This screen is purely informational, and has no bearing on the play of the
game. For information on the current fighting status of the tank, use the
Damage Status Display.

THE CAPTAIN
***********
You knew the job was dangerous when you took it. The colonel just passed the
ball to you. "Here's where the enemy is coming in; here's where you have to
stop him. Good Luck."
   Thanks, Colonel.
   You have three platoons of M1 Abrams tanks - 12 of the finest fighting
vehicles in the world. Somewhere out there is a Russian general with entirely
too many T-74s and, worse, T80s, and Ivan wants the ground you are sitting on.
You sigh and start looking over the local area map. Somewhere there has to be
a point you can stop the Russians from coming through...

MOVE MENU
*********
Use this menu to plot the paths of your platoons. The screen shows the paths
of all your platoons and puts the path editor to work. The active path is the
path of the highlighted platoon. You create the path by using the arrow keys
to draw a line from one node on the map to the next desired change in the
straight-line path of the platoon. At this point hit Enter; this creates a
node. A platoon's path can have up to 5 nodes (counting the starting point).
If its course must change more than 4 times, give it instructions for those
four changes of course and then add to the path after the platoon has been
through some of those nodes. To change the path of the platoon after it has
started, use E to erase each of the nodes you want to change. This starts with
the node farthest away from the current position of the platoon, then
successively erases each closer node and path between the nodes. Then use
arrow keys and Enter to establish the new path.

ORDER MENU
**********
The Orders command (using +) takes you to the Orders Menu. This menu lets you
give general orders to a platoon after they reach the spot specified through
the Move Menu.

PLATOON NUMBER
**************

CURRENT ORDERS - This shows the current order for this platoon.

1 DEFEND - The platoon goes to the area shown and waits for an enemy to come
within striking distance, then attacks.

2 PATROL - The platoon attacks whatever enemy forces it can see in the area it
has been sent to.

3 RETREAT - The platoon goes as fast as it can to its destination point,
ignoring all enemies unless they are directly in its path.

SPEED MENU
**********
This menu sets the speed of the entire platoon or a single detached tank.

PLATOON NUMBER
**************

NAME OF COMMANDER
*****************
SPEED INDICATORS - The main keyboard number keys and + and - control the speed
of the platoon. The percentage of the total possible speed the platoon can go
is shown in the Throttle display when the appropriate key is pressed, and the
Speed display shows the platoon's current speed. Picking a speed sets the
speed for the platoon until you change it.

H HALT - stops the platoon.

B BACK ONE MENU - returns you to the main menu.

X EXIT GAME - takes you out of the game.

FORMATION MENU
**************
This allows you to set your platoon into a formation suitable for your
mission.

PLATOON NUMBER
**************

CURRENT FORMATION NUMBER
************************
Use the main keyboard number keys to pick the formation you wish. The platoon
will attempt to keep that formation, making allowances only for impassible
obstacles as long as you are not personally driving one of the tanks. Once you
are driving a tank, you can move it whereever you wish. Once you leave the
driver's seat, the tank attempts to regain its place in the formation, unless
you have detached the platoon on the Move Screen.

The default formation is Formation #1.

HQ MENU
*******
This Menu provides the possible support missions from Brigade headquerters.

CLOSE AIR SUPP(ORT) -  is used on air support missions to attack an area you
indicate with crosshairs on the map.
   The Close Air Supp command brings up the screen below. Use arrow up, left,
right, down to move the crosshairs, then hit Enter when you center the
crosshairs on the area you want. Once you have established the area for Close
Air Support (CAS), you can either hit S to send your aircraft towards the
spot, or wait and come back to the screen later to put in a command.
   To get to the next CAS mission available, hit N. When you finish giving
commands to the last CAS mission, the N brings you back to the first mission.
A CAS mission can always be altered by coming back to this screen.

RECON - asks HQ to send reconnaissance aircraft to determine the enemy's
precise numbers and locations. Use the same commands used for the Move screen
to trace a route for the Recon plane to follow.
   The Recon mission shows you what is in an area when the mission takes
place. Icons showing the presence of whatever is seen are left in that area
until another Recon Mission is flown to update your information about the
area.
   Use arrow up, left, right, down to plot the path of the reconnais-sance
mission, just as you plot a path for a tank platoon. Then use 1, 2, 3 to give
the missions specific instructions. Strike S whenever you want the mission to
begin, N takes you to the next reconnaisance mission available. To get to a
previous mission, strike N until the cycle comes around to the one you want.
1 RETURN - means the plane goes to the last point of the path, then returns to
its airbase.
2 STATION -  means it goes to the last point of the path, then stays there,
showing anything that passes.
3 SPOT - means that the plane waits until it sees an enemy, then goes back to
base.

ARTILLERY - allows you to pick out a particular area for artillery
bombardment. When you need the artillery, specify the area with the arrow keys
and then call for the artillery. You always have a limited amount of artillery
missions available. The individual mission description, Chapter III, specifies
how many you have.
   Using artillery on an area tells you nothing about what was in it.
   You can call for one of three types of fire mission. Press the given letter
to get the mission you want for the situation.

H HEAVY SHELLING - puts all of its shells into the area in a short period of
time. This intense bombardment hits its target with a very dense pattern. It
is best for attacking a static force, such as another artillery unit or
emplaced armor or infantry.

L LIGHT SHELLING - extends the duration of the shelling. The pattern is less
dense but it has a greater chance of catching targets moving through the area.

C CONTINUOUS - uses of all of the missions at once in a Light Shelling
pattern. The artillery fires one mission after another at the same target
until it has no more shells or you return to the mission and press End
Mission. This uses up a lot of artillery shells very fast, but is good for
softening up a well-defended position.

ARTILLERY RANGE - The artillery provided with this game has a range of about
one quarter the game area. You cannot order artillery to fire beyond that
range.

INTELLIGENCE MENU
*****************
This command operates somewhat different from the other Main Menu commands.
You are given two choices:

G GRID - With this option you can place a grid over the map. Using the arrow
keys you can move a cursor over the grid that will give you the map
coordinates of the area under the cursor. This gives you the relationship
between points on the map and reference points for using Drone Screen, F4.

D DATA - Instead of replacing the menu with another menu, this command
replaces the map screen with an intelligence report that has two sections:

   INITIAL INFORMATIOM - provides the information originally determined by S-2
(intelligence) and given to you for the mission. This is virtually the same
for every time you play the mission, though S-2's estimate of the exact
numbers of enemy forces changes from time to time - simulating the uncertainty
of information on the modern battlefield.

   BATTLE UPDATE - gives a running estimate of the reported destruction of
enemy forces and your own forces. It gives you a quick idea of who is winning,
though it may not have much to do with your final FitRep, or score, for the
mission; the FitRep may depend on other factors besides the number of vehicles
destroyed.

ZOOM MENU
*********
ARROW KEYS - move the box to the area you want to Zoom in on. The + zooms you
in for a closer view, the - zooms you back for a wider, less detailed view.
When you zoom in close enough, the screen turns into a 3-D view.

THE LIEUTENANT
**************
"This section is yours, Joe," the captain said, and you wish you had the
option of saying, "That's OK, Fred, you can give it to Emil instead; I don't
mind."
But that is not an option. You went to a lot of trouble to have the best
platoon in the unit, now you get the benefits of that status that you would
just as soon have passed on. Yours is the lead position, the unit the Soviets
will hit first. Lucky you. Looking over your situation map you evaluate the
probable direction of the Soviet advance against the possibilities of the
terrain. The ground here is hilly, with a lot of steep cliffs. The Soviets'
best bet is the very road you are on, and there is a hillside in enfilade on
the road. Four M1s ready to pounce on a force coming along that road from the
hillside should give the Russians something to think about.
Of course, they might think about it ahead of time. Better put one tank on the
Russian-side approach to that hill, just to discourage any scouts swinging
wide around the hill...

PLATOON LEVEL GAME
******************
If you wish to play on a platoon level, you canleave the guidance of the
Battalion to the default computer plan. Highlight one of the platoon icons on
the Mission Screen, go to the Zoom Menu and expand the mission map to the area
just around the platoon. Use the function keys, as described shortly, to get
to a particular station.
   Otherwise, you can fight each platoon seperately after making the master
plan on the Battalion Mission Map.
   In this mode, you are the platoon leader. Use the Formation Menu to choose
your battle formation, and the rest of the platoon follows your lead. You
cannot control the movement of individual tanks without going to the
Individual Game.
   To see the whole battlefield, scroll the map with the Zoom Menu or use the
Zoom to pull back for an overall view.

INDIVIDUAL GAME F2-F10
**********************

THE TANK COMMANDER
******************
You sweep the horizon again. No helicopters, no planes, no tanks. You begin to
womder if the top brass has screwed up again, and the Russiana are thumbing
their noses in your general direction as they sweep around your little
defense. You look again at the tanks flanking you, hulldown on the reverse
side of the hill with their guns on the road, just like yours. You check out
the road once again, and realize there is something moving on the horizon.
Even as you watch it gets bigger. It is retreating scouts, or the Russians at
last?

Move to the Individual Game by hitting the appropriate Function Key given
below. You play all the important assignments in the tank. You can be the Tank
Commander, the Gunner or the Driver. Either follow the commands you have given
on the Operational and Platoon Level Mission Maps, or follow the
pre-programmed plans if you want to concentrate on the tank-to-tank combat.

Except in the first mission at Fort Knox you start with at least a platoon of
four tanks. You operate the lead tank; the rest of the tanks follow you. You
can move to another tank at any time, if any are still intact.

SWITCHING TANKS AND PLATOONS
****************************
You can go from one tank to another within a platoon by using ] and go from
platoon to platoon by using [.

KEYBOARD USE
************
The same keys can give different results, depending on the screen. Even keys
with only one use may work on one screen, but not on another. However, the
Function Keys get you from one screen to another, and they work the same on
every screen.

ADJUSTING SOUND
***************
Turn all the sound effects on and off with ALT+S, turn just the engine sound
off with ALT+E.

EXITING THE GAME
****************
To exit the game at any time, hit ESC or X. This suspends the game and brings
up a menu with the following choices:

   RESUME GAME lets you start where you were when you hit ESC or X if you did
   not mean to end the game, or left the game for a few minutes and want to
   start again.

   END GAME ends the game, calculates your score so far and compares it
   against previous best scores.

   EXIT TO DOS lets you leave the game immediately, and does not record a
   score.

A tank game cannot be saved. You must either complete the game or choose one
of these alternatives.

READING THE COLORS
******************
In the individual game you are playing on as accurate a representation of real
terrain as we can put on a computer screen. However, some color conventions
were used to show difficulty of terrain and distance from the viewer. These
colors apply to every use of ant screen in the individual game.

LIGHT GREEN        - Flat terrain, best for rapid movement.
GREEN              - Relatively flat terrain or a slight slope - good for hull
                     down position.
LIGHT BROWN        - A much steeper slope.
RED BROWN          - A barely accessible slope. Use low gear when going up or
                     down for maximum speed and control.
BLUE-GREEN CHECKED - Flat terrain over 5km away.
PURPLE LANDSCAPE   - Sloped terrain over 5km away.

THE STATUS SCREEN
*****************
At any time while playing the individual game, you can use ALT+D to get to the
Tank Status Screen. This gives you a quick look at the conditions of your tank
and the amount of materriel (ammuninition, fuel, etc.) you have left.

DAMAGE STATUS DISPLAY
*********************
If the light is on by the item, that item has been damaged and is not longer
available.

   GPS                - (Gunner Primary Sight). The Gunner can no longer acquire
                        targets.
   TRACK              - The tank cannot move.
   THERMAL EQUIPMENT  - The Gunner cannot find targets in the dark and in
                        smoke.
   TURRENT MOTOR      - The turrent cannot move.
   COAX               - The Coaxal machine gun is destroyed.
   ENGINE             - Obvious.
   LASER RANGE FINDER - The laser sight is destroyed.
   SMOKE GENERATOR    - Obvious.

OUTSIDE SCREEN F2
*****************
This screen shows the view from outside the tank. The tank is always in the
center of the screen, but you can move the viewpoint around the tank, move the
viewpoint up yo get a vertical view of the tank and zoom in closer to the tank
and farther away from the tank. The farther you get from the tank, the more
surrounding countryside you see.
This screen represents in abstract form the information your tank crew is
constantly receiving from their senses and the reports from all of their
companions in the field.
   Other terrain features and objects only appear as they relate to the tank
in the center of the screen.
   When using this screen, you see the number pad (or the alternate keys) to
control the tank. Some commands must use an ALT and a number key.

FIRING THE MAIN GUN
*******************
In both this screen and the Trailer Screen F3 you can use the SPACEBAR to fire
the gun, as long as a round is loaded and ready to fire (see GUNNER'S SCREEN
F5).

THE NUMBER PAD
**************
1     - Increase the view angle from 0 degrees (same plane as the tank) to 45
        degrees.
2     - Depress the gun barrel.
3     - Decrease the view angle from 45 degrees to 0 degrees.
4     - Move the tank's heading to the left.
ALT+4 - Move turret to the left.
5     - Align turret with hull.
6     - Move the tank's heading to the right.
ALT+6 - Move turret to the right.
7     - Rotate your viewpoint clockwise around the tank.
8     - Elevate the gun barrel.
9     - Rotate your viewpoint counterclockwise around the tank.
-     - Zoom the viewpoint farther away from tank.
+     - Zoom the viewpoint closer to tank.

THE EXTRA ARROW KEYS - AN ALTERNATIVE TO
If you have an enhanced keyboard, you can use the extra arrow keys to control
the movement of the turret instead of ALT+4 and ALT+6.

5 ALIGNING THE TURRET
*********************
Using 5 aligns the turret so the gun is beared on the tank's heading (in other
words, it is pointing straight ahead). Now you can aim the gun by aiming the
tank. The turret is locked in this position until you hit the 5 again. This
option is available in most other screens.

TRAILER SCREEN F3
*****************
This screen takes you behind your lead tank, as if you were following in a
trailer. While the tank is proceeding in a straight line, your viewpoint is
directly behind the tank. When the tank makes a turn, your viewpoint follows
the path of the turn.

THE NUMBER PAD
**************
Use of the number pad in screen is virtually identical to the use in the
Outside Screen F2 except that, since you always have the same viewpoint, you
cannot use the 7 and 9 to shift your viewpoint around the tank.

1     - Increase the view angle from 0 degrees (same plane as the tank) to 45
        degrees.
2     - Depress the gun barrel.
3     - Decrease the view angle from 45 degrees to 0 degrees.
4     - Move the tank's heading to the left.
ALT+4 - Move turret to the left.
5     - Align turret with hull.
6     - Move the tank's heading to the right.
ALT+6 - Move turret to the right.
8     - Elevate the gun barrel.
-     - Zoom the viewpoint farther away from tank.
+     - Zoom the viewpoint closer to tank.

DRONE SCREEN F4
***************
This screen is called the drone screen because it gives a picture of the
battlefield as if the viewer is getting pictures from a reconnaissance drone.
This screen is available if you are using the Beginner or Intermediate play
options, but is not available in the Expert mode.
The viewpoint can be moved anywhere on the battlefield. A display at the
bottom of the screen shows the viewpoint's heading and its current general
position (accurate to the nearest kilometer) according to the map grid (see
Intelligence). If you get lost press F2, taking you to the normal Outside
viewpoint; you come back to the platoon where the Recon screen started, though
the platoon's location may have changed. Then, you can go back to the Drone
Screen, which will start at the current position of the platoon.
   Alternately, you can snap back to some other screen, but you may have no
idea of where you really are until you activate the Outside screen.

MOVING THE VIEWPOINT
********************
The viewpoint moves in the same way that the Outside View does except that the
commands affecting a tank are replaced by commands that move the viewpoint
away from the tank.

THE NUMBER PAD
**************
1     - Increase the view angle from 0 degrees (same plane as the tank) to 45
        degrees.
2     - Moves the viewpoint straight back.
3     - Decrease the view angle from 45 degrees to 0 degrees.
4     - Moves your viewpoint to the left.
6     - Moves your viewpoint to the right.
7     - Rotate your viewpoint clockwise.
8     - Moves your viewpoint straight ahead.
9     - Rotate your viewpoint counterclockwise.

THE GUNNER
**********
You swing the turret down the road and activate the high magnification
function on your gunsight. You can see the approaching vehicle and realize
that there are more following. The profile is wrong for a Bradley scout; that
silhouette is Russian!
You alert the other as you activate the laser rangefinder. The lead tank is
already in range, but you want a later tank, one that will help clog the pass.
Perhaps its demise will not alert the Russians immediately.
In seconds the last tank in the first formation is in your sights. You lock
him in your laser sight, select a Sabot round and hold your breath. You press
the button, then move the turret to the next tank in line as your shot heads
for its target. On the edge of the sight you can see your first target blow up
as you zero in on the lead tank in the formation, Before you can fire, it
blows up, the victim of one of your comrades. You spin the sight to catch
another and see the remnants of their formation pivot in place and point their
distinctive rounded noses in your direction. The enemy tanks know where you
are, now. You cook off another shot as they start up the hill toward you,
their 125mm guns returning your fire, Time to move!

GUNNER'S SCREEN F5
******************
This presents the Gunner's position in the tank. As gunner you are in charge
of firing the main gun and the coaxial machine gun. You also load the guns in
this position - a function that is normally handled by a loader who is not
featured independently in this game.

COMPASS DIRECTION - This indicator at the top of the screen always shows the
compass bearing of the gun sight.

THERMAL SWITCH - turns on the thermal imaging equipment. Use T to toggle on
and off.

GUN SWITCH - selects whether to fire the main gun or the coaxial machine gun.
Hitting G toggles the choice between those two and a third , "Trigger Safe",
position that keeps both guns from operating.

SABOT - Selects a Sabot round to be fired. Use S to select.

HEAT - Selects a H.E.A.T. (High Explosive Anti-Tank) round to be fired. Use H
to select.

LASER SIGHT - When turned on, the laser sight shows the configuration below.
Use L to toggle this mechanism on when you go into battle. In the side
position it targets the nearest object. In the up position it targets the
farthest object.

Then bring the crosshairs close to a target and press ENTER to get the range
reading shown to the right. This is the distance to the target in meters.
Remember that the M1 gun has a range of about 3000 meters. Hit ENTER again to
lock the Sight onto the target. If the laser lock-on works, the center of the
crosshairs turns red and the sight follows the target as long as it is in
sight. If you wish to stop shooting at that target, hit the ENTER again.

ZOOM - allows the gunner to increase the magnification on his gun sight. The
normal setting is no magnification (1*). Use the Z to toggle between this
setting, 3* magnification and 10* magnification.

TANK ATTITUDE SCREEN
********************
This set of screens tell you:
CLIMB ANGLE  - whether the tank is moving forward on the level, uphill, or
               downhill.
ROLL ANGLE   - whether the tank is moving sideways to a slope.
TURRET ANGLE - how the gun is bearing compared to the heading of the tank.

AMMUNITION SUPPLY SCREEN
************************
This display tells you how many rounds of each type of main gun ammunition
you have left.

THE READY LIGHT
***************
Once you have selected the ammunition you wish to fire, this display will
either read "Loading" (meaning the gun is being loaded and cannot be fired) or
"Ready" (meaning the gun is ready to be fired).

TO STOP THE TANK
****************
There will be times when you want to stop the tank while in Gunner Mode. Just
strike the B and hold it down - this activates the Brakes and is equivalent to
yelling at the driver to stop.

AIMING THE GUN - THE NUMBER PAD
*******************************
8 - Elevates the gun sight (and gun barrel).
4 - Moves the turret bearing to the left.
6 - Moves the turret bearing to the right.
2 - Depresses the gun barrel).

TO SHOOT
********
Once you have selected a target and the ammunition to shoot at it, just hit
the SPACEBAR.

FULL SHOOTING PROCEDURE
***********************
1 - Set Gun to Main (Toggle the G).
2 - Select type of ammo (Toggle the S or H).
3 - Turn on Laser Sight (Toggle L).
4 - Move turret in direction of target (use arrows).
5 - Get range to target (ENTER).
6 - Lock Laser Sight onto target (ENTER).
7 - Wait until Ready light is on.
8 - Fire (using SPACEBAR).

DRIVER'S SCREEN F6
******************
THE DRIVER
**********
You realize that it's time to stop being a spectator and take an active hand
in the festivities. Slamming the tank into reverse, you back down the hill
until the Soviets are no longer visible, then spin left to circle the hill
and strike the enemy tanks on the flank. Just as you start, there is an
explosion ahead and to the left, right where you think the flank tank had been
stationed! The Russian units to the rear of the one you attacked are sweeping
around your position. You slam the tank into Drive and aim for the explosion.
There should be lots of enemy to engage there...

This screen presents the battlefield from the driver's point of view. Using
this screen, the driver controls the movement of the tank.

THERMAL PERISCOPE - This switch turns on the thermal imaging system for the
driver so he can see at night or in fog or smoke. Toggle the T to turn this
feature on and off.

THE GAUGES
**********
RPM - Displays the current RPM of the tank engine.
MPH - Gives the tank's current speed in Miles Per Hour.
COMPASS - Gives the tank's current compass heading.
FUEL GAUGE - Gives the tank's current fuel supply.

SMOKE GENERATOR - Sends a fine spray of oil into the engine exhaust system
that creates a dense cloud of smoke to obscure the area around the tank.
Toggle the 5 to turn the smoke on and off.

MASTER POWER GAUGE LIGHT - As long as this light is on, you have an operating
engine.
TRANSMISSION LIGHT - If on, the transmission has been destroyed.
TRACKS LIGHT - If on, the tracks are destroyed.
BRAKES LIGHT - If on, the brakes are engaged.

STARTING THE TANK
*****************
The tankcan be started by striking one of the throttle keys (described below)
or the + (as described below). After starting the tank, put it into gear.

SELECTING GEARS
***************
Gear Selection is done with the keyboard. Press the following keys to get the
required gear.

D DRIVE - Puts the tank into Drive. Normally there is no need to use any other
gear for forward movement.

R REVERSE - Puts the tank in reverse.

N LOW - Used for tough uphill or dangerous downhill movement, particularly the
latter.

N NEUTRAL - The gear the tank stays in when at rest. This is the setting the
gears should be in when you leave the tank in position for defense.

CAUTION: Stop the Tank before moving from D or L to R and from R to D or L.
Otherwise, the transmission will be damaged!

DRIVING THE TANK
****************
Actually driving the tank can be done with joystick, or by using the number
pad.

- The minus sign decreases the throttle in 1% increments.

+ The plus sign increases the throttle in 1% increments.

4 Steers the tank to the left. The hands on the screen turn the steering
  handle to the left.

6 Steers the tank to the right. The hands on the screen turn the steering
  handle to the right. Removing pressure from the key stops the turn.

OTHER KEYS USABLE BY THE DRIVER ARE:
************************************
1-0 THROTTLE KEYS - Control the throttle of the tank. They represent 10%
    increases in the acceleration of the tank, from 10% (1) to 100% (0).

P   PIVOT - Sets the treads so that one turns forwards while the other turns
    back. This allows for a quick turn in either direction. The tank must be
    stopped before the pivot function is operable.

B  BRAKE - Puts on the brakes. Keep up pressure until the tank is stopped.

TANK ATTITUDE SCREEN
********************
This set of screens tells you:

CLIMB ANGLE - whether the tank is moving forward on the level, uphill or
downhill.

ROLL ANGLE - whether te tank is moving sideways to a slope.

TURRET ANGLE - how the gun bears compared to get heading of the tank.

HINTS FOR GOOD DRIVING.
***********************
1. Stay aware of your surroundings. The Driver's slot gives a very limited
   view of your immediate environment. Make good use of the Outside Screen F2
   to get updates of what is around you. This represents the continued
   information you would get from the Commander and Gunner of the tank and
   information from other tanks.
2. Conserve your fuel. The M1's turbine is a very efficient engine - for a
   tank. It also has a very large fuel tank. This is just as well because the
   M1 consumes up to 5 gallons per mile. Keep your speed down to about 25mph
   except under the most dire circumstances, or you may find yourself out of
   fuel in the middle of an enemy platoon. As a corollary to this advice -
   keep an eye on your fuel gauge.
3. Watch those slopes. The difference between an easy slope you can take in
   Drive and a difficult slope you must use Low gear on is not always obvious.
4. Keep your front to the enemy. Your tank's best armor is on its front and
   turret. If you are facing the enemy, you have the best survival chance if
   the tank is hit.
5. Watch out for your other tanks. Remember that the othertanks in your
   platoon follow your lead slavishly, maintaining formation at all times. Do
   not run them into buildings or trees or enemy vehicles while avoiding
   collisions yourself. You could find yourself in battle alone while the rest
   of the platoon is still hung up on a telephone pole.

COMMANDER'S MACHINE GUN F7
**************************
As Commander you have a .50 caliber (12.7mm) machine gun mounted topside to
use against lightly armored vehicles, aircraft and personnel. The screen shows
the gun and its sight, with displays at the base of the gun showing the
remaining ammo, the compass heading of the gun (this has nothing to do with
the heading of the tank) and the climb, or angle of elevation, of the gun.

AIMING THE MACHINE GUN - THE NUMBER PAD
***************************************
8 - Elevates the gun sight.
4 - Moves the machine gun bearing to the left.
6 - Moves the machine gun bearing to the right.
2 - Depresses the gun sight.

TOO SHOOT
*********
Once you have selected a target, hit the SPACEBAR. Each strike on the space
bar shoots one burst of machine gun ammunition.

SHOOTING PROCEDURE
******************
1 - Aim using arrow keys.
2 - Fire using SPACEBAR.

HELPFUL HINTS
*************
1. Lead Your Targets. Particularly when attacking aircraft, which move
   deceptively fast, aim where you think the target will be when your machine
   gun bullets reach it. The machine gun fires tracer ammunition, so you know
   where the bullets are going; use that information to improve your shooting.
2. Watch Your Ammunition. A machine gun uses a lot of ammunition fast. Watch
   the Ammunition display. It shows your total ammunition since the gun
   reloads automatically. When you run out of this ammunition you are out for
   the rest of the battle.
3. Watch Your Orientation. The machine gun moves by itself. The heading shows
   applies to the compass, not to the direction the tank is travelling. Also,
   note that all the machine guns on the tanks in one platoon will always
   point in the same direction. If you switch from one tank to another, the
   gun will point the same direction as the previous gun.
4. Use The Machine Gun For Finding Targets. The quickest way to find targets
   for the main gun from "inside" the tank is to use the machine gun compass
   bearing to find a target's direction, then go to the Gunner's Screen F5,
   find the same bearing, and find your targets.

COMMANDER'S SCREEN - CUPOLA F8
******************************
This gives you a view from the independently rotating cupola on top of the
turret. The view from this cupola does not match that of either the gunner or
the driver. There is a display at the center top of the window to show the
compass direction of the cupola's bearing. There is also a time readout to
show how many minutes are left in the mission - important for missions with a
time limit.
From this cupola, the Commander can observe areas not currently observed by
the gunner or driver. The cupola can be moved using the joystick or by using
the keyboard number pad.

USING THE NUMBER PAD
********************
4 - Turns the cupola to the left.
6 - Turns the cupola to the right.

OTHER COMMANDS FROM THIS SCREEN
*******************************
S SMOKE GRENADES - can be fired only from this screen. Press S to shoot a
spread of smoke greandes to each side of the bearing of the turret gun that
will obscure all sight in the area for about one minute. Use this to cover
yourself if the tank is damaged.

R RESUPPLY - your tank by taking it to a supply depot (see Missions) and
pressing R. A screen identical to the Armament Screen appears so you can
choose your mix of Sabot and HEAT. The tank is refueled at the same time. This
is done to every tank in the immediate area at the same time by pressing the
R; you do not have to do this for every tank in the area individually.
However, this means that every tank departs from the supply depot with exactly
the same mix of ammunition, no matter what they arrived with.
   The computer will inform you when fueling is completed and you can leave
the depot. While you are at the depot you can be attacked and the depot can be
destroyed at any time.

COMMANDER'S SCREEN - TURRET TOPSIDE F9
**************************************
This gives you a view as if you were sitting on the top of the tank with the
hatch open. It gives you a wide view but leaves you very vulnerable.
From this screen, you can move the turret to give you a view of the whole
area. Note that you are not turning yourself around, you are turning the
entire turret. Your point of view is the same as the bearing of the turret.

TURNING THE TURRET
******************
Use the number keys to turn the turret.

4 - Turns the turret to the left.
6 - Turns the turret to the right.

ENDING AND SCORING THE GAME
***************************
There are four ways to end the game. Each way gives you a Fitness Report
(FitRep), or score:

1. TIME LIMIT: Most missions have a time limit. In modern warfare, time is
   very important. Objectives must be accomplished. Once the time limit has
   been reached, the game is over and you receive a FitRep based on how much
   of the mission was accomplished before time ran out.

2. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED: If all of the objectives of a mission have been
   achieved, the game is over. Your FitRep depends on how quickly you
   accomplished the mission and how many casualties you took accomplishing the
   mission.

3. DEFEAT: If your tanks and other vehicles are all destroyed before you
   accomplish your mission, the game is over. Your FitRep depends on how much
   of the mission you accomplished before running out of resources. This score
   will not be a very high one.

4. PLAYER QUITS: The game ends if you leave it by hitting ESC key and choose
   End Game. See Exiting The Game on the previous page. Your FitRep will be
   compared against the five best for the game and recorded, but you will not
   see the Award/Scoring Screen described below.

SCORING THE MISSION
*******************
You receive a score for every mission you attempt, no matter how much of the
mission you accomplish. In the Mission Descriptions, this score is called a
Fittness Report, or FitRep. Your FitRep is based on four criteria.

1. DIFFICULTY LEVEL: Your FitRep for a mission is increased if you attempt it
   at an Intermediate Level, and increased further at an Expert Level.

2. ACHIEVEMENT: Your FitRep is greater for the number of objectives you
   achieve. You are given points for every enemy tank or other vehicle
   destroyed and every objective area occupied.

3. TIMELINESS: Your FitRep is modified to account for the amount of time you
   took to achieve your objectives, or to achieve whatever you did accomplish.
   The most achieved in the least time earns the highest score.

4. CASUALTY LEVEL: Your FitRep is also modified by your casualty rate. You get
   more points if you achieve your objectives with less casualities.

RECORDING YOUR SCORE
********************
If your score is one of the best five scores on record for that mission, no
matter when you break off the game, you are asked to type in your name beside
your score shown on the Award Scoring Screen. It gives you your score and
shows where it is among the best scores for the mission. If you did not make
the top five, your score is still shown for your reference.


******************************************************************************
                              III. MISSIONS
******************************************************************************

THE MISSIONS
************
TANK is played in missions. Each mission can be played either on an individual
tank basis (with the computer handling all the strategy and tactics) or they
can be played just at a platoon and/or battalion level, with the player never
going beyond the screens available from the Main Menu.
   There are three mission areas to choose from: the Fort Knox Training
Ground, Central Europe and the Middle East.
   Each mission description gives you the S-2 Operations Briefing on what
needs to be done, the S-4 Logistics statement of your resources for the
mission, the S-2 Intelligence report on the expected resistance and the S-1
Personnel statement on the mission's possible impact on your Fitness Report
(FitRep), i.e. your score for the game.

FORT KNOX
*********
Most of the basic training for armored warfare in the United States Army is
done at Fort Knox, Kentucky. All tank commanders get their basic training
here. The missions here are meant to duplicate the training missions a tank
commander or crewman faces while stationed at Fort Knox.

CENTRAL EUROPE
**************
The expected battleground for direct confrontation between American and Soviet
tanks is Central Europe. These missions simulate the problems facing an
American commander who must lead his armored forces against the Soviet
invaders in the first days of World War III. The missions take place around
the town of Fulda and the so-called Fulda Gap, the probable course of any
attack into West Germany by the Warsaw Pact.

MIDDLE EAST
***********
Real tank warfare has been the exclusive preserve of this area since the
1960s. Its broad plains and rocky soil make armored warfare almost mandatory.
In these missions you face the problems of an M1-equipped tank commander
against Soviet-equipped Arab forces in a new Mideast War. The missions take
place along the Israeli/Lebanese/Syrian/Jordanian border, a continuing hot
spot today.

READING THE MAPS
****************
The following mission maps show the basic maps of the area, along with
overlaid lines, boxes and print to indicate the general location of the
important areas in the missions. The maps displayed for each mission on the
computer screen will have more or less detail, depending on what level of
difficulty you are playing at.

FINDING SUPPLY DEPOTS
*********************
Supply depots where you can replenish a tank's ammunition and fuel are
available in some of the missions. Look for mention of them in the S-4
Resources report. When a tank gets close to the depot, strike R as described
in the Commander's Cupola Screen and the tank automatcally fills with fuel.
You will also see the Armament Screen (last seen when starting the game), and
you can pick your ammunition for the rest of the battle. This procedure takes
the tank or tanks out of the battle for five minutes.
   Location of the supply depots is marked on the mission maps herein with
a pyramid shape. The enemy can destroy them.


MISSION NAME: SUDDEN DEATH
MISSION AREA: FORT KNOX

S-3 BRIEFING: Sergeant Waller calls you in to his office. "This is your final
exam. Pass it, and you become a big, bad tank crew. Blow it, and maybe they
can find you a job drivin' a soft drink truck to resupply the PXs.
   "You get one tank. All you gotta do is drive from here at Base Blue over to
Base Red. We expect you to get there in half an hour. You can use any road you
want, but stay off the cross country stuff. You'll have lots of time for that
later."
   "Besides, if you don't take the road, you miss the scenic attractions.
You'll see some other M1s sittin' around out there. Don't run into them. Don't
shoot at them. Of course, you'll see some T-80s and Shilkas out there. Since
you're a beginnin' driver, they won't be movin' while you're around. However,
they will be shootin'. At you. We don't want you shouldn't get into the spirit
of things, so feel free to shoot back. It'll look good on your FitRep if you
hit one or two."
   "But don't get too trigger-happy. It won't look good on your FitRep if you
shoot an M1 or a Vulcan, so make some use out of those briefings and make sure
you know what you're shootin' at."
   "The M1A1 is the best tank on the road. You can take some damage and keep
going. But, if you take too much, it stops workin' and the mission is over. In
that case, you might want to brush up on your truck drivin'."
   "Don't run into any telephone poles or trees or buildings. The grounds
people get annoyed, and I don't want to have a mad groundskeeper chewin' on me
just 'cause one of you eightballs can't tell a telephone pole from a roadbed.
It reflects badly on my teachin', and I hate havin' one of my students actin'
like he didn't learn what he was supposed to."

S-4 RESOURCES: You have one M1A1 tank. There are no supply depots in this
mission.

S-2 REPORT: There are more than five enemy vehicles to be found.

S-1 FITREP: You receive points for destroying enemy targets and completing the
mission within the time given. You will be docked for attacking the wrong
target, arriving late, receiving damage or colliding with any object.


MISSION NAME: DOOM RACE
MISSION AREA: FORT KNOX

S-3 BRIEFING: Captain Hastings addresses your two platoons in the briefing
room of Blue Base.
   "You gentlemen all managed to pass the Sudden Death graduation from basic
tank school. Congratulations. Now, we're going to find out how you handle a
real tactical challenge."
   "You have two platoons of M1A1s. The opposing force has two platoons of
T-80s. Your mission is to race the opposition to the Old Church in the
Northwest section of the training range, then defend the building against the
enemy. You will position one platoon to intercept the opposition before the
race begins. The other platoon must race to the church."
   "Naturally, the opposing force will also have one platoon in an ambush
position somewhere along your route. Let's avoid being destroyed by the
ambushers, shall we?"
   "When your vehicles reach the church, defend it against the opposition. Do
not let the church be destroyed. It looks bad on your Fitreps if you allow
historical landmarks to be blown up."
   "If, by some mischance, you let the opposing force get to the church first,
you must destroy them without damaging the church."
   "Take your time; you have all day to accomplish this mission. It's not over
until either one or the other of you has no tanks left to take the church
with."
   "Remember, you must ambush the opposing force with one platoon, avoid the
opposing force's ambush with the other platoon, take the church, and keep the
opposing force from taking the church. Don't let the church be blown up."
   "Good luck, gentlemen. May you get to the church on time." He smiles at his
own joke and lets you get to your tanks.

S-4 RESOURCES: You have four M1A1 tanks At Base Blue and a platoon to place
anywhere along the probable enemy route. There is a supply depot on the
western road.

S-2 REPORT: The oppposition has a platoon of T-80 tanks at Base Red and others
somwwhere along your probable route.

S-1 FITREP:  You gain points for every enemy vehicle destroyed and every
vehicle you have in operation when the battle is over. You lose points if the
church is destroyed.


MISSION NAME: THE BRIDGE
MISSION AREA: FORT KNOX

S-3 BRIEFING: Captain Hastings brings you into the Blue Team briefing room.
Besides your own men, you see a bunch of men with artillery patches on their
fatigues waiting for the briefing.
   "You gentlemen did so well on the church wargame we have another little
tactical problem for you. Now that you know how to work with a bunch of tanks,
let's see how well you do with some artillery to back your play."
   "You get two platoons of tanks, just like last time. One consists of the
M1A1s you're used to. The other one, however, consists of four brand-new
M1A2s. They've got a bigger gun and tougher armor, but they don't carry as
many rounds, so use them wisely. And try not to get them too dinged up. Your
basic mission is to take your tanks to the bridge on the central highway and
take the bridge."
   "You also get the use of one artillery battery. Lieutentant Harker, here,"
Harker waves to you, "will be on call. You can call on his battery of 155s to
help you out, but they'll only shoot three times for you, so make your fire
missions count."
   "The Red Team is sending the same size force. They also have artillery, so
keep your heads down. You have to fight them for the bridge, and it won't be
any easier than it was fighting them for the church."
   "This time, however, you don't have to worry about keeping the bridge
intact. Assume the world-famous Army Engineers will patch it up if you bang it
up. They'll complain a lot, but they're used to patching up that bridge by
now."
   "If you have the bridge site (whether or not the bridge is intact) and you
still have some operating tanks by the end of a half hour, you win. If you
don't, you get to try it again 'til you get it right."

S-4 RESOURCES: One platoon of M1A1s, one platoon of M1A2s, one battery of
155mm artillery with three fire missions. There is a supply depot to the north
of the Blue Team staging area.

S-2 REPORT: The opposing forces will deploy two platoons of tanks and an
artillery battery.

S-1 FITREP: Your FitRep will improve with every opposing force vehicle
destroyed and for holding the ground on both sides of the bridge.


MISSION NAME: CLOSE ASSAULT
MISSION AREA: FORT KNOX

S-3 BRIEFING: The Battalion Commander, Lt Colonel Schubert, summons you to the
briefing room at Blue Team HQ. As you file in, you realize that not only are
your own mates and some artillery people present, there are some Air Force
flyboys as well. When everyone settles down, Col. Schubert begins.
   "You are going to be performing a close assault of a prepared position. You
must assault and take Red Team's HQ. You have the use of three platoons of
tanks and support vehicles, including air support. The opposing force has a
smaller tank force, though they have more artillery batteries."
   "This is going to be an added challenge for you, as you have to coordinate
artillery, anti-aircraft artillery and air support of your own with your tank
group. Make the maximum use of the suppressive fire of the artillery and the
spotting and neutralization capabilities of the air support. You may use the
anti-aircraft vehicles either as supplementary tanks or as protection for your
artillery."
   "You have superior numbers, but the opposing force has position. You have
one hour to drive them out of their positions and take the Red Base. Remember
that your basic mission is to occupy the base, not destroy opposition
vehicles, though we don't mind if you do that too." He waits for your laugh,
then continues. "If you get your tanks and support vehicles into the town by
the end of the hour, you will have fulfilled your mission."
   "Good luck."
   As you leave the briefing room, the A-10 pilots wave jauntily and say, "See
you groundpounders at Red Base!" They pile into their jeep and head for their
airfield. The Vulcan jockeys, on the other hand. look at you with some
trepidation. How do you intend to use their potentially useful but very
thin-skinned vehicles?

S-4 RESOURCES: You have two platoons of M1A1 tanks and one platoon of M1A2
tanks. You can call on two A-10 Thunderbolt IIs (Warthogs) and five fire
support missions from the 155mm battery. You also have a platoon of M163
Vulcan Anti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA) vehicles that you may deploy in any way
you wish. There is a supply depot in your staging area.

S-2 REPORT: The opposition has two platoons of tanks of undetermined type,
some artillery and some aircraft. They may have AA capability of their own.

S-1 FITREP: Your FitRep rating will improve with every opposition vehicle you
destroy, but will improve even more withevery vehicle you manage to get into
Red Base before the time limit is up.


MISSION NAME: RED THUNDER
MISSION AREA: FORT KNOX

S-3 BRIEFING: After the successful assault on Red Base, you have returned to
Blue Base for refurbishment and R&R. Now your headquarters platoon is called
into the briefing room by Colonel Schubert. Once again, the briefing group
also includes artillery handlers, A-10 pilots and Vulcan jockeys.
   "As you know, our victory over the Red Team was not as complete as we would
like. They still have units unaccounted for. We are going to try to flush them
out as well as get a convoy of needed supplies to the troops now garrisoning
Red Base and the Red Team airfield."
   "You, lieutenant," he says, looking directly at you, "will lead your
platoon and the Anti-Aircraft platoon to guard the convoy going to Red Base.
The convoy consists of six trucks and two jeeps under the command of Captain
Bing." Bing waves to you from his seat amongst his truckers.
   "We are not wasting vehicles by sending them empty. The supplies these
vehicles carry are vital to the force at Red Base. Do not let the opposition
destroy the convoy."
   "I would like to indicate my whole-hearted support of that proposition,"
adds Captain Bing.
   "Precisely," says the colonel. "Captain Bing's vehicles are unarmed. You
must provide any firepower needed along the route. Unfortunately, opposing
force guerrillas have destroyed the bridges on the two most direct routes to
Red Base. You must take the longer, southern route. You can expect the
opposing force to be waiting for you."
   "The artillery batteries here and at your destination can give you some
support. You may call on three fire missions from each of them. Also,
Lieutenant Avery and Lieutenant Dickens," the A-10 pilots wave, "are on call
ant time you need them."
   "Good luck."
   You think, "I'm going to need all the luck I can get."

S-4 RESOURCES: You have one platoon of M1A1 tanks, one platoon of M163 Vulcan
AAA vehicles, three fire missions each from artillery batteries at the start
and end of the convoy route and two A-10s on call. There is no supply depot on
this mission.

S-2 REPORT: Opposition forces known to be in the area include tanks and
Frogfoot aircraft. The opposition may have access to other resources.

S-1 FITREP: Your FitRep will increase with any opposition vehicle destroyed,
and increase more with each convoy vehicle you get to Red Base intact. Your
rating will decrease with every convoy vehicle destroyed.


MISSION NAME: DEFENDER
MISSION AREA: GERMANY

S-3 BRIEFING: For the last six weeks, the papers have been full of charges and
countercharges as the United States and Soviet Union traded accusations over
the latest dispute. It all seemed like Standard Operating Procedure, but this
time it's gotten more press than any incident since the Berlin Wall. Last week
the US Army told you to send your dependents back to the States and put your
unit on 24 hour alert. Now the Captain has come back to your laager at Schlitz
after meeting the colonel at Battalion HQ. He calls you to gather around his
command tank.
   "The balloon's gone up, guys; the Soviets have broken through the border
and are pushing on Fulda. I'm taking the Second and Third platoonswith me to
help out the 42nd at Fulda."
   You wonder what you're supposed to do with your First Platoon. He lets you
know soon. "Smith," he says, looking right at you, "First Platoon's got the
real prime spot. You get to guard the fuel dump here at Schlitz. Ivan's gonna
want to live off the land, and Brigade thinks they might send their empties
over here to get refueled. You get to play fuel monitor and keep the Soviets
from tanking up without paying for it."
   That was yesterday. Today, the Captain was on the horn again. You could
barely hear him through the mutual jamming by both sides.
   "We've stopped 'em so far, but Recon says there's a bunch heading your way
from all over. Keep 'em out of that fuel, and don't let any stray rounds get
into that dump. We're going to need that diesel, too. I've got what's left of
Able Company on its way to help, but we're not going to get there until an
hour after they do."
   "Keep Ivan busy for an hour and everything will be under control. I finally
talked the colonel into moving the dump. Hang in there."

S-4 RESOURCES: You have four M1A1s just to the north and east of Schiltz. You
can resupply at the ammo dump.

S-2 REPORT: Recon reports four sections of tanks, one to three tanks in each
section, mostly T-72s, all vectoring in on your position in an arc from your
north to southeast. The section coming from the direct east should arrive
first, the one from the northeast should arrive last.

S-1 FITREP: Your FitRep will look better and better for every enemy vehicle
destroyed. It will look very good of the fuel dump does not blow up. Your
rating will go down for every tank you lose, every enemy tank in the area of
the dump that has to be mopped up by the relief force, and there will be a big
black mark if the fuel dump is destroyed.


MISSION NAME: ASGARD
MISSION AREA: GERMANY

S-3 BRIEFING: The mutual jamming has been tying up communications for the last
three days. Artillery keeps taking out the phone lines the communications
people set up. You've heard they're running out of wire. This may explain why
your two platoons are the only armored to show up for the briefing from
Brigade.
   The Staff major looks nervous as first you, then an Air Force type and some
joes from artillery come into the tent.
   "As you are only too aware, communications are very bad on this front.
Apparently, the Soviets have decided to do something about it by putting a
communications station on top of the Wasserkuppe, the tallest mountain in the
area. With a ground station there, they can blanket our communications and
relay their own with impunity. We know this because we intend to do the same
thing in a couple of days."
   "I want you to intercept the Soviets with the forces available here. You
have two platoons of tanks, a platoon of Vulcan and the services of some fire
missions from the four batteries of M198 cannon set up at Fulda. There're also
a couple of A-10s at Hosenfeld that we can vector in to help you."
   "You'll be on your own. You have to hold this Russian attempt until they're
all gone. If you destroy their combat vehicles, their engineers will not
advance to construct the station. By the time they can assemble another team
for this mission, our own station should be in place, with enough defenses to
keep the Russians from shoving us out."
   "Be careful out there."
   Working with the FAC and FAO, you work out some frequencies that are fairly
reliable, even with all the jamming. There are some other units with call on
the artillery, so they can only provide sixteen fire missions.

S-4 RESOURCES: You have one platoon of M1A1s in the eastern section of Fulda,
and your other platoon is already positioned to the west of the Wasserkuppe.
The Vulcan platoon is attaching itself to the platoon at Petersburg. There are
four batteries to the south of Fulda that can let you have four missions each,
and two A-10s waiting for orders at the airfield in Hosefeld. The supply depot
is south of Fulda.

S-2 REPORT: The Soviets have some tanks of indeterminate type approaching the
Wasserkuppe from the north and northwest. They can be assumed to have air
support, and we have spotted some field artillery batteries digging in to the
north of the Wasserkuppe.

S-1 FITREP: Your FitRep will be good if you destroy enemy vehicles and
especially good if the enemy does not reach the Wasserkuppe area. Losing
vehicles of your own will seriously impact your FitRep, and leaving enemy
vehicles where they can accomplish their mission will do your FitRep no good
at all.


MISSION NAME: VALKYRIE
MISSION AREA: GERMANY

S-3 BRIEFING: Things have settled down in the ruins of Schlitz. You've fought
over it now three (or is it four?) times. The good burghers are going to have
a lot of rebuilding to do when it's over. Your destroyed and damaged tanks
have been replaced with brand new M1A2s. You're ready to move again.
   But most of the action seems to have switched to the northern German plain.
The call to come to a briefing is kind of a relief.
   The briefing tent used to be a good tavern. Inside, Colonel Hacker is
flanked by Major Hildebrant and an Air Force type. The colonel introduces Air
Force Major Berkeley, who says, "Our Soviet friends got lucky and shot down a
surveillance plane this morning. Unfortunately, that plane has a top secret
'black box' that we need to have back. We doubt that the Soviets know it is
there, but if they got their hands on the box or the pilot, they would know
immediately just how valuable it is."
   "Thanks to your actions at the Wasserkuppe, we received a very good
location report on the pilot, Capt. Gerald Davis, and the box. Unfortunately,
he is behind enemy lines - such as they are."
   "We want you men to break through, get the pilot and the box, and get back
to Hosenfeld."
   Colonel Hacker takes over the briefing. "We're sending in a small force
because a large force would probably cause such a row that the pilot would get
killed by a stray bullet somewhere. You have your two platoons of tanks, the
platoon of Vulcans, and fire missions from three different batteries strung
along the front. The Air Force has also promised us the use of four A-10s when
you need them."
   "Get going now. The longer that pilot is out there, the greater chance the
Russians have him and that box."

S-4 RESOURCES: You have four M1A1s and four M1A2s, with four Vulcans, to make
the dash with. You have cover fire from the artillery batteries northwest of
Schlitz, south of Schlitz and in Fulda. Each battery can supply four fire
missions. A-10s are available to provide covering fire all the way. The supply
depot is in the hills between Schlitz and Fulda.

S-2 REPORT: The Soviets have several platoons of armored vehicles in the area,
though one unit may actually be Shilkas. There is a major Soviet artillery
concentration around Hunfeld, and the Rasdorf airbase has several Frogfoots.
We don't think the Soviets realize how important that pilot is, but they won't
remain ignorant forever.

S-1 FITREP: You can increase your FitRep by destroying enemy vehicles, but it
will look much better if you find the pilot and his box and get him back to
Hosenfeld.

GAME PLAY NOTE - RESCUING THE PILOT: There is no room for a pilot in your
tanks. Once you find him, direct a Vulcan to his position, then protect that
Vulcan with everything you have.


MISSION NAME: BIFROST
MISSION AREA: GERMANY

S-3 BRIEFING: Suddenly, the war heated up again. As if retaliating for your
incursion into their space in search of that pilot, the Soviets blitzed
through Schlitz and brushed your company back to Lauterbach and Fulda. Most of
the attackers pushed on deeper into West Germany and are now somebody else's
problem. But there's still a company or so sitting on the airfield in
Hosenfeld and they look like they intend to stay.
   In a shell-torn warehouse in Fulda you look across the river at the Soviet
platoon guarding that approach to Hosenfeld.
   "We know they're going to want to expand that bridgehead," says Major
Hildebrant, the S-2 who took over the battalion when Colonel Hacker bought the
farm. "Brigade wants us to beat them to the punch while the 32nd is cutting
off their friends' attack in the west. You've got the tanks and Vulcans here,
plus most of our artillery. The boys with the M1A2s in Lauterbach are ready to
go on our signal and we still have two A-10s over there to help out."
   "As far as we can tell, the Sovs are implaced but isolated; if you keep
together, you can take them on piecemeal. Before they can react, you'll
probably have destroyed half their tanks."
   "We figure that it will take the 32nd about an hour to stop the attack and
send them back this way. We want you in place in an hour to meet the
retreating Soviets while they still think Hosenfeld is theirs."
   "Take care of yourselves. They're waiting for something like this so you
can't expect to catch them napping. Do as much damage as you can and drive
them out of Hosenfeld. We want to have dinner tomorrow in the mayor's mansion
- assuming it's still standing."
   Great - Hildebrant is making dinner plans while your platoons have to make
room for the dinner party.

S-4 RESOURCES: You have eight M1A1s in Fulda and four M1A2s in Lauterbach.
You've got four Vulcans with you in Fulda and two batteries with enough
ammunition to give you four missions each. There are A-10s on call at the
Lauterbach airbase. The supply depot is south of Fulda.

S-2 REPORT: The Soviets have approximately three platoons around Hosenfeld and
artillery implaced inside, plus some other artillery emplaced to the south of
Schlitz. They also have a supply convoy that just reached Hosenfeld. They have
repaired enough of the airfield to land a couple of Frogfoots there, though
the Frogfoots may be back in Rasdorf now.

S-1 FITREP: Your FitRep will benefit by getting your vehicles into Hosenfeld
and, incidentally, destroying enemy vehicles. Try to keep your own casualties
down to a minimum.


MISSION NAME: WILD HUNT
MISSION AREA: GERMANY

S-3 BRIEFING: As Hosenfeld burned around you, you could hear the roar of
approaching vehicles. You barely had time to scramble into your tank and dog
down the hatches before the first wave of retreating Soviets hit the town.
They did not find the safe haven they expected, but you had not quite
garrisoned the town to stop this avalanche of vehicles. You pick off what you
can as they pass through and monitor other tanks, aircraft and reconnaisance
planes as they report this mass retreat.
   As the last of the retreating Soviets breaks past your position, a Bradley
IFV pulls up and Major Hildebrants pops out of the hatch. "How many tanks you
got left, Captain?"
   "Four," you answer. The toll has been heavy. A lot of friends won't be
coming to the post-war reunion.
   "Well, you're the senior surviving field officer here so you get to chase
Ivan home. I've got a platoon of A1s and a platoon of A2s for you from Brigade
and some Vulcans to fill out your AA platoon. There're four A-10s waiting for
your call and here are the call numbers for three batteries that can answer
any call within reason. Get after those retreating Soviets and maul them the
best you can. Watch out for their artillery and air cover, but chase them to
Hunfeld if you have to. You can keep going to Rasdorf if you want, but don't
unless you think you can come back."
   You realize that your tanks are low in ammunition, but you have enough to
do some damage. Besides, all the first class Russian armor is long gone,
anyway. All you have to chase are a bunch of cripples - plus any covering
force they've left behind. You also need to watch out for Soviet artillery
pockets. They like to set up killing grounds where they can concentrate all
their artillery.
   Getting the locations of the other tanks and artillery, you turn your
battered tank around and head north. You can still see the dust trail of the
retreating Soviets...

S-4 RESOURCES: You have a platoon of M1A1s that are somewhat damaged and short
on ammunition. You also have another relatively fresh platoon of M1A1s and a
fairly fresh platoon of M1A2s, as well as a platoon of Vulcans.
   There are A-10s waiting for a call at Hosenfeld, and three artillery units,
two at Fulda and one on the Lauterbach road with a total of 13 missions before
they run out of ammunition. The only supply depot is south of Fulda.

S-2 REPORT: Recon says that the closest Soviet forces consist of a mixed group
of somewhat damaged T-72s and T-80s and a unit of Shilkas, the AA vehicle.
There are also Frogfoots known to be operating in the area and masses of
Soviet artillery around Rasdorf and Hunfeld.
   Watch out. The Soviets may try an ambush to delay you.

S-1 FITREP: Your FitRep will improve with every enemy vehicle destroyed, and
decrease with every friendly vehicle destroyed.


MISSION NAME: THE ASS'S JAWBONE
MISSION AREA: MIDDLE EAST

S-3 BRIEFING: How did it get started? How did Syria and Israel actually come
to a real shooting war over Lebanon? And, even given America's traditional
ties to Israel, how did your brigade of American Gls find itself supporting
Israel by guarding a town with the unlikely name of Bent Jbail on the
Lebanese-Israeli border?
   Well, that's a question for later. Right now, it's time to slug down
another cup of coffee and pay attention to what Major Swinburn has to say.
   "A column of Syrian tanks is approaching along the road to Sour." At your
blank look he explains, "That's Tyre on some of your maps.
   "Recon shows us that you are greatly outnumbered even with your attached
Vulcan platoon, so we are seconding the 3rd platoon from across the border to
you. They should get here about the time the lead elements of the Syrian force
do.
   "You're outnumbered but you have artillery support here, and the 3rd
platoon can call on another battery from across the river. They're short on
ammo so make the best use you can of their limited fire missions."
   "You also have two A-10s from Zefat on call."
   "We can get more reinforcements to you about a half hour after the Syrians
get here. Try to hold them until then. Any questions?"
   "Do they have any air cover?" asks Jack Davis, the second looey in charge
of the two-vehicle Vulcan platoon.
   "Yes, they've been using some Frogfoots to clear out opposition ahead of
them. We don't know if they have enough staying power to remain with the tanks
until they get here."
   You look up and see the distinctive silhouette of a Frogfoot over the town.
"I think we just got the answer to that question."

S-4 RESOURCES: You have four M1A1s and two Vulcans laagered just to the west
of Bent Jbail, directly on the road the Syrians are coming down. The four
M1A1s of the 3rd Platoon are on their way. In the town is a battery of M198
155mm howitzers and there is another battery across the border, in range of
the town. There is a supply depot near the 3rd Platoon's position.
   Two A-10s are loaded and ready to go any time you ask for them from the
forward airbase at Zefat.

S-2 REPORT: There are about four platoons coming down the road. Recon shows at
least four T-80s and four T-72s moving in echelon over a line of about 5
kilometers. As many as two Frogfoots may be preceding them to soften up any
opposition. No artillery or infantery support has been noted.

S-1 FITREP: Your FitRep rating will improve with every enemy vehicle destroyed
and decline with any of your units destroyed. You will be in deep trouble if
there are enemy units inside Bent Jbail at the end of half an hour.


MISSION NAME: GOD'S LAST ACRE
MISSION AREA: MIDDLE EAST

S-3 BRIEFING: "They're coming again," says Swinburn. "This time, we can't
depend on the cavalry to help us out. The incursion around Tiberias has bled
off any possible reinforcements until tomorrow."
   "They're coming down both main roads this time; they're bringing along
infantry so they must intend to stay awhile."
   He looks over his notes and continues, "Recon also shows that they've
established artillery along both their routes, so we can expect counterbattery
fire."
   "Brigade says that if we destroy their infantry they'll probably pull back;
the trucks should be the first targets."
   "What do we have going for us?" you ask.
   "Well, we still have Vulcans so we have a weapon against their close air
support."
   "Close air support?"
   "Didn't I mention it? They've got a couple of Frogfoots flying air cover
over the trucks."
   "Do we have any air cover?"
   "Oh yeah, those A-10 Warthog jockeys in Zefat are still on call if we need
them."
   You look at your tank laager and wonder just how you're supposed to defend
this little chunk of Lebanese real estate with four M1A1s and the four old M1s
Brigade sent to replace your damage from the last fight. They must be raiding
all the old National Guard and Army Reserve armories for anything that'll
fight and shipping it over on the next tramp steamer. At least you have your
artillery where you can use it (until they run out of ammo) and some Vulcans
to keep the Frogfoots off your back. It might be enough.
   Let's see, the western column will get here first. Should you go out to
meet it or wait in ambush in the town?

S-4 RESOURCES: You havetwo A-10s on call in Zefat, one platoon of four M1A1s
and one platoon of four M1s and the short platoon of two Vulcans. Your 155mm
artillery have four fire missions each, then they're out of ammo. A supply
depot for your tanks is south of town.

S-2 REPORT: Recon shows a platoon of T-80s and a platoon of T-72s with each
convoy of four trucks. Each convoy also has an accompanying Frogfoot. The
columns slowed up long enough to detach a battery of D-30 122mm howitzers with
just enough range to hit the town.

S-1 FITREP: Your FitRep will improve with every enemy vehicle destroyed and
decline with every unit you lose. At all costs you must keep the enemy out of
Bent Jbail.


MISSION NAME: EXPULSION
MISSION AREA: MIDDLE EAST

S-3 BRIEFING: You look at the ruined town of Bent Jbail through your
binoculars. The frustration gnaws at your gut. After three days of trying to
hold on to the little  burg, you've been tossed out. Even the last minute
addition of another tank company couldn't stop the Syrian tanks. Now your back
is against the border, and the Syrians are bringing in a whole new company of
bright and shiny tanks.
   "Not very pretty, is it?" asks Swinburn as he comes up behind you. You
resist the urge to turn and scream at him. It's not his fault that Brigade
kept telling you to hold this Jehovag-forsaken town beyond any reasonable
need.
   "Now what?" you ask.
   "Now we bug out, of course." He looks as tired as you feel. While you've
been fighting for the lives of you and your men, he's been trying to keep you
alive with Brigade. You wonder who's been through the worse battles.
   "Brigade wants us back at Zefat. They've got enough artillery there to keep
the Syrians off our backs. Pull out as soon as you can. And don't look back."
   "What about those field guns? We don't have any vehicles to haul them
with."
   "The crews will fire them to cover the retreat. When they're going to be
overrun, they blow 'em up and run."
   He pauses, probably thinking about the gunners that are going to have to
become guerillas or refugees to stay alive. "We've got some more A-10s at
Zefat, too. There'll be four flyboys covering us as we go."
   He leaves you to plan your tactics. You know the remaining artillery
battery has about three missions worth of ammo; should they be protected until
they can get those rounds off? All of your tanks have some damage. Which ones
should be pulled out first? Can you turn this disaster into a setback?

S-4 RESOURCES: You have a platoon of three M1A1 tanks with some damage, a
platoon of four M1A1s with damage, and a platoon of three M1s with damage.
Your Vulcan platoon now has one M163 in it. The rest are burning hulks in Bent
Jbail.
   You have one battery of 155mm howitzers with three fire missions left and
no way to move them. The three batteries emplaced at Zefat can just barely
reach you, but they have several missions each available to you.
   There are A-10s ready to go at Zefat. No supply depot is available.

S-2 REPORT: The Syrians have T-72s and T-80s in and around Bent Jbail. They
have two artillery batteries behind their tank lines, one on each road. They
still seem to have access to some Frogfoots.

S-1 FITREP: Your FitRep will be increased with every enemy vehicle destroyed,
but increased more for every vehicle you get to Zefat. It decreases with every
vehicle lost.


MISSION NAME: BLOW THE HORNS
MISSION AREA: MIDDLE EAST

S-3 BRIEFING: "It don't rain but it pours," as Grandpa always says. Except
that rain is in pretty short supply in Israel. But the Syrians seem to be
pouring into the country enough to make rain superfluous.
   You stand on your tank turret and scan the horizon, which is broken up by
the ruined buildings of Zefat. With barely enough tanks to make up one platoon
and one artillery battery, you have to hold the town against a company of
Syrian tanks with artillery backup.
   "Report from Brigade, sir." says one of your other tank commanders.
"They say relief is on the way. We have to be ready to break out in 20 minutes
to join their attack on the airfield."
   About time. You wonder what the commander of the relieving force is
thinking...
* * * * * *
   As your M1A2 rolls off the main road and heads for the airfield, you wonder
how the troops in Zefat are holding up. You remember the briefing you got
before you rolled out of the staging area.
   "The troops in Zefat are barely holding on. You've got two platoons of
M1A2s, a platoon of Vulcans for air cover and a battery of 155s to supplement
the artillery in town. The Air Force is supplying two A-10s with another two
on the way. The Syrians have most of a company of tanks encircling the town
and several artillery batteries, but they must be getting low on ammunitions.
They also have a couple of Frogfoots they've planted at the Zefat airbase."
   "Take the airbase with the aid of the troops in Zefat then try to take the
town again if you have the force available. You have a half hour from when you
approach the base. Good luck."
   You check your watch. The half hour starts now.

S-4 RESOURCES: You have three M1A1s in Zefat, along with one battery with
three fire missions.
   The relieving force consists of two platoons of M1A2s, one platoon of M163
Vulcans, one battery of 155s with four fire missions, and two A-10s in the
air, poised to strike on request. No supply depot are available.

S-2 REPORT: The Syrians have several T-72s and T-80s surrounding Zefat. They
have three artillery batteries to the north of the town and have landed some
Frogfoots in the airfield outside of Zefat.

S-1 FITREP: Your FitRep increases with every enemy vehicle destroyed and even
more with every friendly vehicle inside Zefat at the end of a half hour. It
decreases with the destruction of friendly vehicles and enemy vehicles left
outside or inside Zefat at the end of the half hour.


MISSION NAME: ARMAGEDDON
MISSION AREA: MIDDLE EAST

S-3 BRIEFING: At last you're looking at the cratered rooftops and streets of
Bebt Jbail through your binoculars again. But now you feel you've got a
fighting chance. Strung out around the town are the remnants of the crew you
chased out of Zefat yesterday. Strung out in a line along the border is the
company-strength conglomeration of tanks ans AA vehicles that are left after
you removed the Syrians from Zefat and chasen them back to Lebanon.
   The briefing from the new CO, Colonel Hawkings, had been brief and to the
point.
   "I think we all agree that we're tired of being knocked around. The Syrians
are over there in Lebanon - probably gathering for another attack. We're going
to attack first. Take your company across the border and hit the Syrians. Keep
on hitting them until there aren't any Syrians left." A man of few words, that
Colonel Hawkings.
   You can see a Frofoot wheeling above the town. The Syrians still have air
cover from their airfield in Syria. Their artillery is still around, too, as
you can tell from gun flashes and the occasional shells falling in your
formation. But they aren't shooting much - they must be running low on
ordnance.
   On the other hand, your batteries are fairly fresh. Four collections of
155mms are ready to go. Ammunition is still scarce, but you can get four
missions out of each. That should be enough.
   You know that the Syrians now have some Shilka AAs. The Air Force learned
that the hard way. That makes the Air Force's job a little harder, but not
impossible. The two A-10s should have lots of targets today.
   This will be the first chance you have had to meet those Russian tanks with
equal numbers. It will be a whole new shooting match today.

S-4 RESOURCES: You have one platoon of four M1A1s, one platoon of four M1A2s
and one platoon of four M1s. Supplementing these is an AA platoon of four M163
Vulcans.
   Your four artillery batteries can provide four missions each and you have
A-10s at Zefat ready to come when you call. A supply depot has been set up
south of Bent Jbail.

S-2 REPORT: The enemy has about a dozen tanks, an undetermined mixture of
T-80s and T-72s. The airfield in Syria seems to have endless pairs of
Frogfoots.
   For artillery they have two batteries of 122mm guns which Recon says were
just resupplied. They also have an AA platoon of the very effective Shilka
vehicles.

S-1 FITREP: Your FitRep will increase for every enemy vehicle destroyed and
every vehicle you have in Bent Jbail or its vicinity at the end of the
engagement. You lose FitRep for the destruction of your own vehicles and every
enemy vehicle still in Bent Jbail or its surrounding territory at the end of
the engagement.

******************************************************************************

PLAYING HINTS.
**************
The folowing information is meant to help any tank commander: both the
commander of armored units and the commander of a single tank. The first
section deals with tank tactics and general operational information for
dealing with a tank battalion or platoon. The other pages deal with the
difficulties of fighting various opponents the individual tank will have to
deal with on the modern battlefield.

UNIT TACTICS.
*************
1. Form maneuver teams. US Army doctrine calls for dividing a four tank
   platoon into two maneuver teams of two tanks each. The teams support one
   another just as the tanks in the teams support each other. The best way to
   duplicate this in the game is to use the Detach function of the Move Menu
   and divide your platoons into one two-tank team and one team of two
   detached tanks that you will have to move seperately. Then keep the teams
   together by their orders on the Mission Area Map (Operational Level); in
   the Individual Gamr, skip back and forth between the "platoons" and make
   sure they continue to work together.
2. Leapfrog your mevements. When crossing terrain with a possible enemy
   presence, one team should wait while the other team makes the crossing;
   then the crossing team should stand guard while their backup makes the
   crossing.
3. Keep a reserve. Whenever possible keep a platoon or maneuver team in a
   position to come to the aid of any unit. There are two doctrines as to who
   should be aided in offense. The Russian doctrines says that the reserve
   should be committed to support a successful unit in order to exploit its
   success. The alternate doctrine, which has some adherents in Western
   tactical thinking, is that failing attacks should be supported by the
   reserve, in hopes of turning them into successful attacks. In defense, of
   course, the reserve should be used to support any unit that is crumbling in
   the face of the enemy's attack.

INDIVIDUAL COMBAT HINTS.
************************
When fighting one-to-one against another tank, keep the following in mind.

1. Shoot for the vulnerable areas. All tanks have less armor on their sides
   and back than on their front and turret.
2. Keep moving. One of the Abrams's advantages is its stabilized gun and laser
   sight. You can fire on the move with normal chances of hitting. Some enemy
   tanks have to stop to have a decent chance of hitting. Hit those tanks
   before they can get into position.
3. Find a hull-down position. If you have to take a stationary defensive
   position, set yourself on the side of a ridge opposite to the probable
   direction of the enemy advance if you can. Your ability to do this will
   depend on the degree of slope, since the game does not provide Army
   Engineers to dig out positions for your tanks. In an ideal situation, the
   driver should not be able to see the oncoming enemy, but the gunner should.
   This is called a "hill-down position," and it means that the enemy has only
   the small target of your turret to shoot at, rather than the whole tank.
4. Enfilade. Whenever possible assume a position where you can shoot at the
   sides of a whole line of tanks. With luck, you can take out three or four
   before they realize where the shots are coming from.
5. Use of cover. There is a temptation to hide behind trees and houses to
   surprise an enemy. Do not do this in the middle of a fight. The enemy has
   thermal imaging weapons, and they will pick you out of cover easily.
   However, using the wrecks of burning tanks as cover will work, as the heat
   generated by the fire should cover your own heat signature.
6. Defensively, remember your formation. Make sure the other tanks in the
   platoon are in good defensive positions, and change your formation if that
   will give the other tanks better cover.

THE BEST ANTI-TANK AMMUNITION.
******************************
Use Sabot rounds versus the T-80, as it is protected against the HEAT. Versus
the T-72, HEAT rounds may be successful, depending on the degree of protection
the T-72 has been modernized to.
   Aim for the sides and back if at all possible and, conversely, don't let
the enemy get to your side or back. Never use HEAT rounds on the target's
front or turret of a tank.

VERSUS AIRCRAFT.
****************
Tank main gun rounds are not meant for shooting at aircraft. A hovering
helicopter might be a candidate for a HEAT round - but never shoot at a jet
with a tank cannon.
   Instead, use the coaxial machine gun and the Commander's cupola machine gun
on airborne targets.

INFANTRY WEAPONS.
*****************
In the Yom Kippur war, Egyptian-manned, Russian-made Sagger ATGWs (Anti-Tank
Guided Weapons) did a surprising amount of damage to Israeli tanks. Ever
since, critics of armored warfare have claimed that the tank is obsolete; an
infantryman with an anti-tank rocket could stop any tank.
   While obituaries for the tank are a bit premature, the properly equipped
infantryman can still pose a major problem for the tanker.

ATGW (ANTI-TANK GUIDED WEAPONS) ROCKETS.
****************************************
These weapons have grown more and more sophisticated and more and more
dangerous to the modern tank. However, most of these weapons use HEAT rounds
exclusively because they cannot generate the velocity necessary for an
effective Sabot round. This means the M1's Chobham armor is particularly
effective against it. These weapons are all sight-guided and their main
advantage is their superior range to a tank cannon. However, it takes several
seconds for a rocket to travel two miles to its target. The gunner must stay
glued to his sight and keep his target in that sight the entire time, or the
rocket will miss. A tactic devised by Israeli tankers during the Yom Kippur
war is simply to look for the telltale puffs of rocket smoke and, whenever you
see the puff, duck behind a tree or building to foul up the gunner's aim. The
other, more aggressive, tactic is to shoot at the puff of smoke and hope that
incoming tank rounds will make the gunner flinch and take his eyes away from
the sight. leaving the ATGW without direction.

IFVs (INFANTRY FIGHTING VEHICLES)
*********************************
Infantry Fighting Vehicles come in two varieties from the viewpoint of the
tanker. One form carries troops and mounts a low-power anti-tank gun that is
not much of a threat to an M1. The other form acts as an infantry support
anti-tank vehicle and carries anti-tank rockets such as those described above.
   In this later form such vehicles are a great danger to the tank and must be
disposed of immediately. Fortunately, they cannot fire on the move. A moving
IFV is no real danger, but a stationary one may be lining up its sights on
your tank. Blow it away immediately.
   To fulfill your mission you may need to make targets of other IFVs, such as
those carrying troops toward the area you are defending; but remember to
destroy any enemy IFV that has stayed in the same place too long.

SELF-HELP TROUBLESHOOTING.
**************************
SHOOTING PROBLEMS - LEADING THE TARGET.
***************************************
Keep in mind that most of the opponents worth shooting at are on the move.
Unless your target is moving directly toward or away from you (or are
landscape fixtures, such as a house or telephone pole), it is unlikely to
remain where you shot at it.
   Lead your targets, aiming for where you think they will be when the shell
hits. The faster they are moving and the further away they are, the more you
must lead them.
   This applies mostly to the coaxial machine gun and the Commander's machine
gun. With the tank's main gun, this is alleviated by using the laser sight as
described in the section on the Gunner. If the laser sight is knocked out,
lead your target as described above.

REALITY PROBLEMS.
*****************
We have tried to make this the most realistic tank simulator ever created.
However, we have fallen short of reality. This lack of reality is simply a
function of memory available to the computer. Every picture takes up space and
causes delay when it is brought up for the game. Saving space and time by
eliminating some possible pictures creates an inexact match between game and
reality. Your computer cannot simulate the real actions of the 20+ people it
is trying to simulate. Computer terrain cannot duplicate every gully and road
bump on a German road or even every village on a German map. We have tried to
duplicate all the aspects that make the game an exciting one, while editing
out the aspects that can make a real battle both boring and too uncertain.
   For the same reasons, many actions available in reality are not available
to a game tank. For instance, a real tank has a good chance of knocking over
any house, tree or telephone pole it runs into. In the game, you have to go
around these obstacles.

TRAINING, THE ANTIDOTE TO GENERAL CONFUSION.
********************************************
Trying to keep of a multi-tank battle is very difficult. Make the most of your
Outside, Trailer and Recon screens; memorize what you can do with your the
Outside screen and what you need to go into the Commander, Gunner or Driver
screen for. Remember that your Commander's Machine Gun screen gives you the
biggest picture and provides a compass bearing on any target you see.
   Play and re-play the Dudden Death and Doom Race missions until you have a
good grasp of what you need to keep in your mind. Get used to being shot at
and, in the Doom Race mission, to keep track of more than one vehicle. It will
take you several missions before you learn how to keep your head when everyone
about you is losing theirs.
   Unless you are positive you have learned all there is to know in the Fort
Knox missions, start off as a Beginner in every mission you try. You may think
you have learned all about tank warfare with the training missions and want to
start off the European missions at the Intermediate level. However, you'll
find the unique terrain and problems of European or Middle Eastern combat will
fool you unless you start off as a Beginner, just as any tanker rotated to a
European station must do in the yearly wargames held there. Think of yourself
as a new recruit who must go through the wargames before you find yourself
confronting the real thing.


******************************************************************************
                               V. APPENDICES
******************************************************************************

A. HISTORY OF ARMORED WARFARE.
******************************
THE FIRST ARMORED FIGHTING VEHICLES.
************************************
Mobile, armored, fighting platforms that mounted artillert were first
developed in the 15th century by John Ziska, a leader of the Hussite rebellion
in Bohemia. The Hussites followed the teachings of John Hus, a priest who took
up the views of Martin Luther. Hus was executed by King Sigismund of Bohemia,
but his followers formed a religious sect that rebelled against the oppressive
Bohemian king and the Holy Roman Empire, whose Catholic inclinations did not
tolerate divergent religious views.
   The Holy Roman Empire had lots of knights and heavy cavalry. The Hussites
had some minor nobles among their adherents, but most were peasants. They
could not match the nobility and mercenaries sent against them man-to-man.
   However, John Ziska was a canny old soldier. He hit on the idea of turning
wagons into travelling forts bu lining them with metal and mounting cannon and
crossbowmen (and, later, musketeers) on them. They were called "Wagenburgs" or
wagon forts. The Hussite "armored teams" were highly mobile and brought far
more firepower into a fight than the knights and mercenaries could. The
Hussites protected themselves for decades before Ziska's death and internal
politics within the sect left them open to conquest by Sigismund's successors.
   The final defeat of the Hussite cause and the lack of communication between
middle and western Europe kept this departure from basic medieval tactics out
of the repertoire of most armies throughout the 16th-19th centuries. Settlers
of the American West are rumored to have used more makeshift versions in their
occasional skirmishes with the American Indians, but they rarely mounted
artillery on wagons.
   The 19th century did see the development of armored warships, a major
departure from the traditional wooden ship. Perhaps this form of innovation,
which helped make the British Navy paramount in the world, sparked a response
in the British military.

MOBILE ARTILLERY.
*****************
However, one lesson learned in the intervening years was the need to have
highly mobile artillery support. Until the invention of the automobile, this
was supplied by horse artillery: light field pieces pulled by horses which
accompanied the cavalry and lent support to their attacks and covered their
retreats.
   Once automobiles were invented, military tinkerers attempted to produce a
motorcar equivalent of a horse artillery battery, but they found that
automobiles lacked the cross-country ability found in the steady artillery
horse. By the time of the First World War, the only way to get artillery
moving was still with the old reliable horse.
   Then the advent of the trench/machine gun combanation put a stop to the
movement of artillery or the movement of cavalry. War came to a standstill as
trenches appeared from one end of France to the other.
   Sometime was needed to break the stalemate - something that would have the
mobility of cavalry and horse artillery, the firepower of a horse artillery
piece, and the protective qualities of a trench. The generals needed a
fighting vehicle with armor.

THE FIRST "TANKS".
******************
The first Armored Fighting Vehicle recognizable as a tank was developed by
British Lieutenant-Colonel Earnest D. Swinton in 1916. He adapted the design
of armored cars (relatively useless off a road) to the use of tracks such as
those on some American farm tractors. To keep German spies from realizing what
the machines were, they were labelled "tanks" to make them sound like water
carriers to be used in the desert; the name stuck.
   These tanks were first used on September 15, 1916. A German officer
captured in that attack described the use of the tanks as "Not war, but bloody
butchery." The Chief of Staff of the German Third Army wrote, "The enemy...
have employed new engines of war, as cruel as they are effective. No doubt
they will adopt on an extensive scale these monstrous engines, and it is
urgent to take whatever methods are possible to counteract them."
   Theory about the use of the first tanks divided them into two types whose
descendants are still with us today. The lightweight "whippets" were meant to
surge through enemy lines and roam freely, using their machine guns to raise
havoc and cut supply lines. The larger tanks (called "Infantry tanks" by the
British) were meant to lead assaults on trenches, using their heavier
artillery to destroy enemy positions and support advancing infantry.
   When the Germans tried to match these tanks with their own vehicles, they
followed much the same design lines.
   Essentially, these have been the two major roles of tanks up to the present
day.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICAN TANKS.
**********************************
In the First World War, the American army used French and British tanks.
Between the wars, they toyed with various styles of tanks, swinging back and
forth between the heavily armored infantry support vehicle and the lihgtly
armored independent tank that operated like a cavalry troop. The main
innovation in American design was the use of radical aircraft engines, which
supplied more power than conventional engines but caused the tank design to
incorporate high rear ends.
   The first successful design along these lines was the the M2 Light Tank,
mounting a 47mm gun in the turret. These were supplied to the British army in
North Africa and immediately picked up the nickname of "Honey" because of
their excellent handling characteristics. Unfortunately, their main gun did
not have sufficient power to penetrate the frontal armor of the German Panzer
IV, Rommel's main line tank.
   The M2 was quickly followed by the M3 "General Lee," which mounted the same
47mm turret but also carried a 75mm gun in a side-mounted sponson. One of
these tanks was a featured player in the little-known Humphrey Bogart wartime
film, SAHARA.
   The "General Lee" was followed by the M4 "General Sherman," which carried
the 75mm gun in the turret. Compared to its opposite numbers in the German
army, it was an easy target and light-skinned, but it was easy to build and
easy to maintain. It proved so popular that it was bought by many countries
after the war and was in production for several years after the war.
   The M4 was followed by the M26 "Pershing," then the M48 and M60 "Pattons,"
which were arguably just extensions of the M4 design. The M60 did make the
departure of using a diesel engine similar to those in use elsewhere in the
world instead of the aircraft-style engines used before.

ARMORED VEHICLE DESIGN THEORY.
******************************
Modern tank design has reached a stage where the three main considerations of
designing armored vehicles - guns, armor and speed - can be balanced so that a
vehicle has adequate amounts of all three. American tank design has generally
concentrated on mobility and ease of handling and maintenance, which resulted
in mechanically excellent tanks that were deficient in armor and weaponry,
such as the M2, M3 and M4. Now these deficiencies have been eliminated and the
American military has the M1 Abrams, a tank with protection and firepower to
equal any other tank design, on a chassis that is much easier to run and
maintain than most.

WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE HEAVY TANK?
************************************
During the Second World War, tanks were divided into three classes: heavy,
medium, and light. The heavy tank was considered too unwieldly and was
eventually abandoned for the medium tank, now called the Main Battle Tank (or
MBT). This category describes tanks that weigh more and are heavier armed than
the discarded heavies of WWII, though they still have the maneuverability of
the medium tanks.

CREATION OF THE M1/M1A1 ABRAMS.
*******************************
The biggest battle the M1 has seen so far in its career was the struggle with
Congress to approve its design and production. Cost-conscious Congressmen were
afraid that the tank was a deathtrap and an unneccessary elaboration of the
M60. It is said the testimony that convinced Congress otherwise was not that
of the generals and Defense Department experts who argued that an upgrade was
necessary to meet the challenge of Warsaw Pact improvements, but that of the
tank sergeants who operated the test models and realized how much of an
improvement the M1 is over its predecessors. Their testimony was very
persuasive; most Congressmen were convinced and the M1 has enjoyed the support
of Congress ever since. In fact, Congress ended up appropriating money for
more M1s than the Pentagon had requested.

NATO ARMORED VEHICLE DESIGN THEORY.
***********************************
Current American/NATO theory is that the quality of NATO tanks must offset the
numerical superiority of the Warsaw Pact tanks. NATO military strategy is
based on the assumption that one NATO tank is equal to at least two of their
Warsaw Pact opposite numbers.
   While no one considers a Soviet tank equal to its NATO opposite number in
one-to-one combat, military observers are much less comvinced that NATO tanks
are equal to two of their opposite numbers. There is still a qualitative
difference between the M1A1 and the T-80, but it is less than that between the
M60 and the T-64. Despite its smaller size and tonnage, the T-80 is now
assumed to have a fully-stabilized gun (for firing accurately on the move) and
thermal-imaging (for seeing past smokescreens), two advantages formerly
exclusive to NATO tank design.
   During the Second World War, the Russians fielded the first of their great
tank designs, the T-34. German designers looking at captured versions, said
that the T-34 would never pass their quality control regulations, and
developed the Panther and Tiger tanks. These were two of the finest tanks to
come out of the war. However, the Russians could build five T-34s in the time
it took the Germans to build two Panthers. The Russians won. Historical
perspectives like this one give NATO tank designers nightmares.
   NATO assumes that it will be assailed with three-to-one odds, but that the
quality of its armored vehicles, plus its anti-tank and aircraft forces, will
make the difference. One hopes this theory need only be tested in computer
simulations like this one.

COMBINED ARMS THEORY.
*********************
In the past, tanks either slowed down to the speed of dismounted infantry or
dashed out ahead and attempted to operate independently. In the former case,
they might as well have been artillery pieces and they lost the benefit of
their mobility and speed. In the later case, they were too easily ambushed by
infantry with anti-tank weapons.
   The role of infantry and tanks has changed in theory. Now the Infantry
Fighting Vehicle (such as the Russian BMP and the American M2 Bradley) is
intended to stay with the tanks and allow its cargo to fire from the
protection of the vehicle through gun ports. The vehicle also acts as a mobile
gun platform to back up dismounted infantry, and the infantry can disembark to
take up defensive positions, then reembark to push on to the next objective in
little time.
   This speed allows the infantry to keep up with the tanks and has turned
modern warfare into what is theorized to be a very fluid sort of combat, with
little in the way of "front lines" as they were known in the previous World
Wars.
   Whether this theory will work out as expected is still very much up in the
air. The only modern conflicts to use masses of infantry and armor working
together (and that without the latest tanks ins Infantry Fighting Vehicles)
were the Yom Kippir war in the Middle East in the early 70s and the recently
concluded Iran-Iraq war. Most modern theories still rehash the conduct of the
Yom Kippir war; both sides of the Iran-Iraq struggle were very reluctant to
allow foreign observers.
   Considering the static nature of that war, one might assume that the
practice of the theory of modern armored warfare will have to wait for its use
by modern armored warriors - an eventuality that will no doubt please the
theorists at the same time it terrifies the rest of the world.

B. GLOSSARY.
************
A-10 Warthog - American attack fighter, meant for close-in support work with
ground forces. It is slow in comparison with most fighters and is not as
maneuverable as other fighters, but it is well armored and is thought to have
good survivability on the modern battlefield.

AAA (Anti-Aircraft-Artillery) - This is the military designation for any tube
artillery (artillery that fires projectiles instead of self-propelled
missiles) used against aircraft. The M-163 Vulcan (q.v.) and ZSU-23-4 Shilka
(q.v.) are examples of AAA used in this game.

AAM )Anti-Aircraft Missile) - This is the military designation for
selfpropelled missiles used against aircraft. The hand-held infantry Stinger
is an example of an AAM used in this game.

AFV (Armored Fighting Vehicle) - The official description of what is generally
known as a tank.

AH-64 Apache - An American attack helicopter meant to deliver the most punch
with the most precision.

APC (Armored Personnel Carrier) - This is a tracked vehicle meant to carry a
squad of infantry and protect them from small arms and other anti-personnel
weapons. Its armor is usually aluminium and useless against any form of
armor-piercing ammunition. Troops inside one of these vehicles are strictly
passengers. The vehicle brings them to the site of the fighting, at which time
they must disembark and fight on foot while the vehicle supports them with its
minor weaponry.

APFSDS (Armor-Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sabot) - This is the full
designation for the main gun round commonly called a Sabot (q.v.).

ATGW (Anti-Tank Guided Weapon) - A general designation for infantry support
missiles meant to destroy tanks. The operator must keep his sights on the
target tank until the missile hits the tank, which can take up to ten seconds,
depending on the range. All known ATGWs use HEAT (q.v.) ammunition, which is
not very effective against the new Chobham (q.v.) type armor on the most
modern Main Battle Tanks.

Battalion - A group of two or more companies (q.v.) commanded by a lieutenant
colonel or major. This is generally the smallest maneuver unit considered in
operational planning. American battalions are usually organized as either
infantry or armor battalions. Normal battle doctrine involves battalions
trading companies; an infantry battalion will trade a company of its infantry
for a company of tanks from an armored battalion, so that each battalion has a
combined arms capacity.

Bearing - The direction the main gun of the tank is pointed. This may or may
not have anything to do with the tank's Heading (q.v.).

BMP - Soviet IFV (q.v.). There are two types, the BMP-1 and the BMP-2. The
BMP-1 was the first IFV introduced into any army. Its design flaws were
corrected with the BMP-2. Among the improvements are increased armor, a better
position for the vehicle commander and an improved light anti-tank gun.

Chobham armor - Armor developed by the British at the Chobham Laboratories to
dissipate the effects of HEAT (q.v.) rounds. An inner core of ceramic scales
absorbs the heat and dissipates it inside the armor, significantly reducing
the penetrability of the HEAT missile. The inner core also serves to deflect
penetrating Sabot (q.v.) rounds and dissipate their kinitic energy. Current
tests indicate that the Sabot rounds may destroy the HEAT-absorbing quality of
the armor, and the army is looking into using depleted (non-radioactive)
uranium armor either as a supplement or a replacement. The M1A2 tanks used in
this game are considered to have uranium armor.

Company - An organization of (usually) four platoons (q.v.), usually commanded
by a captain. An armored company is also known as a "troop", a vestige of its
cavalry roots. An artillery company is known as a battery.

Cupola - A mini-turret that rests on top of the tank turret and moves
independently of the main turret. The tank commander uses the cupola slit to
look at areas the driver and gunner cannot see.

D-30 (122mm field gun) - This is one of the standard field guns of the Soviet
army. It has great range and striking power.

Enfilade - A shooting position from which the attacker can attack the side of
a target where the armor is less effective.

FAC (Forward Air Controller) - A field officer trained in calling for air
strikes against enemy formations. Sometimes the FAC is equipped with a laser
device that marks a target for an attacking plane's laser-guided bombs.

FAO (Forward Artillery Observer) - An artillery officer usually attached to a
front line company or battalion whose job is calling for artillery strikes at
the request of the field commander. The FAO coordinates observed enemy
formations with his map and gives the distant artillery map coordinates to
shoot at.

Fire Mission - This is a term for the artillery strike called in by an FAO.
Since there are many calls on an artillery Battery's services, one particular
unit may be given only a few calls (or fire missions) on the services of the
battery.

FitRep (Fitness Rating) - This is the report made on every member of the armed
services by his commanding officer. In this game, it is symbolized by the
score you receive when you complete a mission. If you receive a high score,
you have received a good FitRep.

Heading - The direction the tank's front is pointed, the direction of its
forward movement.

HEAT (High Explosive Anti-Tank round) - When this shell strikes the target's
surface, the contact sets off a shaped charge that releases a jet of
super-heated gas that can burn a hole through the toughest metal armor. Most
infantry anti-tank weapons have HEAT missiles.

IFV (Infantry Fighting Vehicle) - This is an improvement over the APC (q.v.);
infantry inside the vehicle can engage targets with their personal arms
through gunports without leaving the vehicle. The best examples of this form
of vehicle is the American M-2 Bradley (q.v.) and the Russian BMP-1 and BMP-2
(q.v.).

Laager - An Afrikaans term describing a defensive encampment defended by a
circle of armored vehicles. Originally it described an encampment protected by
a ring of wagons, but times change.

Laser Range Finder (LRF) - A laser device used to determine the exact range to
a target.

M1- The Abrams Battle Tank. One of the subjects of this game.

M1A1 - The later version of the M1 Abrams. It differs from its predecessor in
its main armament (a 120mm smoothbore instead of a 105mm rifled) and the
provision of thermal imaging (q.v.) for both driver and gunner.

M113 - This APC (q.v.) is slowly being replaced by the M2 Bradley IFV (q.v.).
It is similar to the Bradley in basic function, but does not have the built-in
30mm turret nor the gun ports for internal use by passengers. It is still the
main base vehicle for several US Army weapon systems, including the M163
Vulcan anti-aircraft vehicle. The M113 is used by many other nations' armies.

M163 Vulcan - This is a rapidfire 20mm cannon mounted on a M113 APC that is
used for anti-aircraft support and anti-personnel missions. It was supposed to
be replaced by the Sgt. York anti-aircraft weapon, but development of the York
was halted when Congress learned that it was over-budget and not fulfilling
its function. The Vulcan has been in service since 1965 and shows its age, but
it is all the US has at the moment, and all it will have for at least another
five years.

M198 (155mm cannon) - This is one of the main field guns of the United States
Army. It is being phased out in favor of self-propelled artillery, but its
relative lightness makes it easily air-portable, and therefore still useful
for forces that must airdrop their artillery support.

M-2 (The Bradley IFV) - A fully tracked infantry fighting vehicle used by
American and some NATO forces. It can carry a squad of men and has provisions
for them to remain inside the vehicle while using gunports to fire outside. It
also mounts a light cannon for engaging other light vehicles and two TOW
rockets for engaging heavy armored vehicles. However, its main function is to
avoid enemy armored vehicles and get its cargo where it needs to go.

M-3 (The Bradley CFV) - This is the Cavalry Fighting Vehicle equivalent of the
M-2. It has an increased load of TOW missiles and is used for infantry support
and reconnaissance. It does not carry a complement of infantry.

MI-24 - Soviet helicopter known by the NATO designation of Hind. It is similar
in form and function to the American AH-64.

MBT (Main Battle Tank) - This is the usual term used to describe the standard
tank of an armored force. It is a development from the former designation of
"Medium" tank, which fell into disuse as new developments in tank design
effectively combined the armor and weaponry of "Heavy" tanks with the speed
and maneuverability of "Medium" tanks.

NATO (The North Atlantic Treaty Organization) - The alliance of most Western
European and North American nations to forestall Russian invasions of Western
Europe. The members include the USA, Canada, England, Italy, Turkey, Greece
and (West) Germany. The member nations have a central command that coordinates
their efforts and tries to mandate (usually unsuccessfully) a unified system
of weapons for all members. France is allied to the alliance, though it
refuses any military control from non-Frenchmen.

Operations - The maneuvering of units of battalion to divisional strength as
part of an overall strategic (see strategy) plan.

Platoon - The smallest group od soldiers commanded by an officer (usually a
first lieutenant). A modern infantry platoon is usually four squads of ten men
each, plus the commanding officer, his first sergeant and a small staff. A
tank platoon consists of four-tank squads plus the commanding lieutenant and
first sergeant's vehicle. Since each tank has a crew of four men, the tank
platoon has about half the personnel of an infantry platoon.

Reactive Armor - Initially developed by Israel, this consists of plastic
explosive behind a steel plate that reacts to a HEAT (q.v.) round by breaking
up the plasma jet and destroying its destructive force. The explosion of
reactive armor also deflects the impact of the Sabot round. It is the main
anti-HEAT expedient employed by the Soviet army.

Reconnaissance Drone - An unpiloted, radio-controlled aircraft meant to scout
enemy forces without (1) showing up on enemy detection devices because of its
small size and (2) risking the life of a valuable pilot. These drones are only
now starting to see use in US military forces, although Israel and other
nations have been using them successfully for years.

S-1 Adjutant - The personnel officer for a unit. This officer makes sure that
there are men available to do the tasks commanded by the commanding officer
and to make sure the men are in shape to do the tasks.

S-2 Intelligence Officer - The officer in charge of telling the commanding
officer what is known about opposing forces. This officer and the S-3
Operations officer (see below) are the most vital officers for planning any
battle. Frequently, the CO of a unit gets the information from the S-2, then
uses that information to give orders to his S-1, S-3 and S-4.

S-3 Operations Officer - The officer in charge of the fine planning of
whatever operation the commanding officer wants done. In planning the route of
a tank battalion or platoon, you are essentially performing the function of an
S-3 officer.

S-4 Logistics Officer - The officer in charge of making sure that supplies
reach the unit so that it can fulfill its objective. This vital function is
provided by the computer in this game, which sets up what materiel you start
the game with and establishes supply depots to resupply from. The computer
then does what the S-4 would do, make sure the supplies show up where the
commanding officer wants them.

Sabot (Sa-BOH) - This is literally the French word for shoe. It refers to the
delivery system for an anti-tank weapon which is simply a rod (usually
finstabilized) of dense material (the current favorite is depleted uranium)
that travels at great speed because the sabot drops off as it leaves the
barrel, giving the rod all the velocity of the high caliber round imparted to
the weight and small cross-section of the rod. The rod punches its way through
most armor very handily, then breaks up inside the tank, raining shrapnel all
around.

Strategy - The overall plan of maneuver and engagement for large forces
(division and above) to accomplish objectives oriented towards ending the
entire conflict, rather than just achieving a battlefield objective. These
strategic objectives are accomplished through operations and tactics.

SU-25 "Frogfoot" - This is a Soviet ground support fighter that is somewhat
similar to the A-10, though it is not as heavily armed and armored. It has
excellent endurance and carries similar weaponry to the A-10's.

T-72 - The Soviet Main Battle Tank most commonly exported to other countries.
It is commonly used in Warsaw Pact countries. It has a diesel engine and is
vulnerable to most NATO tank ammunition.

T-80 - The current Soviet main battle tank. It is the first Soviet tank to be
equipped with a turbine engine and its armor is very effective against the
effects of HEAT shells. It is also thought to use a thermal-imaging system.

Tactics - The use of small units (companies down to individual personnel) to
accomplish limited objectives as part of an overall operation (q.v.).

Thermal Imaging - A passive infrared sight that allows the user to trace
targets by their heat, whether covred by smoke and fog or not. The M1 mounts
this device, while most Russian tanks do not, probably because of the cost -
which is 10% of the cost of an M1 tank.

T.O.W. (Tube-launched, Optically-tracked, Wire command-link guided missile) -
This is a name used both for small missiles meant to destroy a tank and their
launcher. This is a mounted weapon, using a HEAT warhead, frequently found on
IFVs and special jeeps and trucks.

UAV (Unmanned Airborne Vehicle) - This is the military designation for drones
now being developed for battlefield reconnais-sance and possible combat
applications. These vehicles are overgrown radio-controlled airplanes mounting
cameras and other sensors that are flown by a pilot who is safe behind the
lines operating the craft by radio link.

Warsaw Pact - The alliance of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries
formed to offset the perceived threat of NATO (q.v.). It is named for Polish
capitol where the pact was signed. Signatories include the Soviet Union,
Poland, (East) Germany, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Rumania and Hungary.

ZSU-23-4 Shilka - This Soviet weapon is similar in function to the US Army's
M163 Vulcan (q.v.), but it is more powerful and modern; it has a number of
radar-assisted functions that the Vulcan cannot match.

C. TECH SPECS, FRIENDLY VEHICLES.
*********************************
Probably the saddest obituary a soldier can have is "killed by friendly fire."
In the confusion of a modern battlefield, keeping track of friendly vehicles
and distinguishing them from enemy vehicles (see the next section) is of
paramount importance. A lot of lives can rest on your ability to distinguish
friend from foe - fast.
   This Appendix describes the technical specifications of the M1A1 Main
Battle Tank that you will be using in this game, plus descriptions of the
other friendly vehicles you will see and should not shoot at.

M1-ABRAMS
*********
Origin:          USA
Crew:            4
Armament:        One rifled M68 105mm gun; one 7.62mm coaxial machine gun; one
                 7.62mm machine gun at loader's station; one 12.7mm
                 (.50 caliber) at commander's station; six smoke discharges
                 each side of turret.
Armor:           Chobham heavy armor. Reactive armor can be fitted for
                 protection to thinner-skinned areas.
Dimensions:      Length including main gun 32ft (9.766m); hull length 26ft
                 (7.918m); width 12ft (3.653m); height 9ft 6in (2.885m).
Combat Weight:   120,250lb (54,545kg or 60.125 tons)
Ground Pressure: 13.7psi (0.96kg/cm)
Engine:          Avco Lycoming AGT-1500 gas turbine developing 1,500hp
                 (1,118kW) at 3,000 RPM.
Performance:     Road Speed 45mph (72.421km/h), range 310 miles (498km);
                 vertical obstacle 4ft 1in (1.244m); trench 9ft (2.743m);
                 gradient 60%
General Notes:   The M1 was introduced as a replacement for the cancelled
                 joint USA/West German MBT-70 project. It is the first United
                 States tank to feature a turbine engine and Chobham armor,
                 and was accepted into a building program largely due to the
                 testimony of the tank sergeants who tested the prototype. It
                 features many innovations in tank design, including a
                 stabilized gun and laser sighting mechanism that allows it to
                 be fired on the move with little loss of accuracy, an
                 innovation that has caused a major revision of American tank
                 tactics. The change to a turbine engine has met with some
                 criticism, but in general it has proven more trustworthy than
                 the diesel used in the previous M60 main battle tank.
                    The original M1 has been replaced in production by the
                 M1A1, described below. The Army is reportedly pulling all M1s
                 out of Europe because it fears the 105mm gun is ineffective
                 against the Soviet T-80's front and turret armor.

M1A1-ABRAMS
***********
Origin:          USA
Crew:            4
Armament:        One smoothbore Rheinmetal 120mm; one 7.62mm coaxial machine
                 gun; one 7.62mm machine gun at loader's station; one 12.7mm
                 (.50 caliber) at commander's station; six smoke dischargers
                 each side of the turret.
Armor:           Chobham heavy armor, with thicker armor than the M1 in the
                 frontal areas. Reactive armor can be fitted for protection to
                 thinner-skinned areas.
Dimensions:      Length including main gun 32ft (9.766m); hull length 26ft
                 (7.918m); width 12ft (3.653m); height 9ft 6in (2.885m).
Combat Weight:   126,000lb (57,200kg or 63 tons)
Ground Pressure: 13.7psi (0.96kg/cm)
Engine:          Avco Lycoming AGT-1500 gas turbine developing 1,500hp
                 (1,118kW) at 3,000 RPM.
Performance:     Road Speed 45mph (72.421km/h), range 310 miles (498km);
                 vertical obstacle 4ft 1in (1.244m); trench 9ft (2.743m);
                 gradient 60%
General Notes:   The main difference between the M1 and the M1A1 is the
                 substitution of the German-designed 120mm gun for the 105mm
                 gun (originally designed by the British). This part of a NATO
                 policy of standardizing subcomponents of military hardware;
                 the gun and its ammunition is compatible with that used in
                 the German Leopard II. The M1A1 also adds an extra thermal
                 imager for the commander's station and an improved laser
                 rangefinder.
                    In every mission presented in this game, the usual tank
                 available is the M1A1, the current workhorse of the US Army
                 armored divisions.

M1A2-ABRAMS
***********
Origin:          USA
Crew:            3
Armament:        One smoothbore 140mm; one 7.62mm coaxial machine gun; one
                 7.62mm machine gun at loader's station; one 12.7mm (.50
                 caliber) at commander's station; six smoke dischargers each
                 side of the turret.

                 frontal areas. Reactive armor is fitted for protection to
                 thinner-skinned areas.
Dimensions:      Length including main gun 32ft (9.766m); hull length 26ft
                 (7.918m); width 12ft (3.653m); height 9ft 6in (2.885m).
Combat Weight:   110,000lb (50,000kg or 55 tons)
Ground Pressure: 13psi (0.85kg/cm)
Engine:          Avco Lycoming AGT-1500 gas turbine developing 1,500hp
                 (1,118kW) at 3,000 RPM.
Performance:     Road Speed 45mph (72.421km/h), range 310 miles (498km);
                 vertical obstacle 4ft 1in (1.244m); trench 9ft (2.743m);
                 gradient 60%
General Notes:   The M1A2 is still under design and could end up being an
                 entirely different tank from the one described here. The
                 statistics given here are based on the assumption that the
                 new tank will be a development from the M1, rather than a
                 departure, and based on Pentagon statements as to the desired
                 nature of the new tank.
                    The main differences between the M1A1 and the M1A2 are
                 fitted of depleted uranium armor for further protection from
                 HEAT rounds and the fitting of a 140mm gun. This is part of a
                 NATO agreement the British, West Germans and Americans to
                 standardize on a heavy caliber gun capable of penetrating
                 Soviet armor.
                    One criticism of implementing this program is that the
                 tanks cannot carry enough ammunition for a 140mm weapon to
                 make them viable fighting vehicles in any kind of an extended
                 battle. The weight of the 140mm projectile makes an automatic
                 loader necessary, a step which the US military is
                 uncomfortable with. Among the problems of an automatic loader
                 is the necessity to eliminate the blast doors that currently
                 seperate the crew from the ammunition in case of a hit to the
                 ammunition lockers.
                    NATO is currently looking into alternate projectiles and
                 weapons to shoot them, such as solid rounds shot from
                 magnetic accelerators (rail guns) instead of propelled by
                 gunpowder, to try to find more punch for the pound. Some
                 developers think they can have such a gun bt the mid 1990s.
                 It would not depend on penetrating tank armor; it would just
                 provide enough kinetic force to knock a turret off a tank.
                    In the missions presented in this game, the M1A2s are
                 designed after the most conservative estimate of their
                 probable configuration.

                 internal fuel 428 miles (689km).
General Notes:   Initially called for in the early 1960s, the Apache was not
                 finally chosen until 1976 and did not start production until
                 1982. It is a good all-around attack helicopter with high
                 survivability. It is both hard to spot and hard to hurt.

A-10 THUNDERBOLT II "WARTHOG"
*****************************
Origin:          USA
Crew:            1
Armament:        30mm chain driven cannon, plus assorted wing loads up to
                 16,000lbs (7,257kg).
Dimensions:      Length 53 feet, 4in (16.25m); height 14 feet, 8 inches
                 (4.47m); wingspan 57 feet, 6 inches (17.53m).

                 radius 250 miles (400km)
General Notes:   This plane's official designation id the Thunderbolt II, but
                 throughout its development time the groundcrews and test
                 pilot called it the Warthog and the name stuck.
                    The Warthog is no longer in production, but is still the
                 all-purpose ground support aircraft of choice for anti-tank
                 operations. It is slow and clumsy-looking, but it is highly
                 maneuverable, operates under adverse conditions and can land
                 in a (smooth and level) cow pasture.

M2 BRADLEY
**********
Origin:          USA
Crew:            3+7
Armament:        One 25mm cannon; one coaxial 7.62mm machine gun; Twin
                 launcher for Two anti-tank missiles; four smoke discharges
                 on each side of turret.
Armor:           Light
Dimensions:      Length 21ft 2in (6.45m); width 10ft 6in (3.2m); height 9ft
                 9in (2.97m).
Combat Weight:   49,802lb (22,290kg or about 25 tons)
Ground Pressure: 7.52lb/sq in (0.53kg/cm)
Engine:          Cummins VTA-903T Turbo-charged 8-cylinder diesel developing
                 500hp (372kW) at 2,600 Rpm.

                 obstacle 3ft (0.914m); trench 8ft 4in (2.54m); gradient 60%
General Notes:   There are actually two Bradleys. The M2 is an Armored
                 Personnel Carrier meant to carry combat troops into battle
                 and provide some survivability against anti-personnel
                 weapons. It is a departure from the American M113 APC; troops
                 inside have firing ports to shoot from.
                    The M3 version acts as a platform for many infantry
                 support weapons, such as multiple launch rocket system.
                    The Bradley is fully amphibious.

M163 VULCAN
***********
Origin:          USA
Crew:            4
Armament:        One 20mm rapidfire cannon
Dimensions:      Length 15ft 11in (4.86m), width 9ft 4in (2.85m), height
                 including turret 9ft (2.74m)
Combat Weight:   27,082lb (13,310kg or 13.5 tons)
Ground Pressure: 9.52lb/sq in (0.61kg/cm)
Engine:          6-cylinder water-cooled diesel developing 215hp (160kW)
Performance:     Road Speed 42.24mph (67.6km/h), range 302 miles (483km),
                 vertical obstacle 2ft (0.61m), trench 5ft 6in (1.68m),
                 gradient 60%
General Notes:   The M163 is an M113 APC body fitted with a turret containing
                 the famous 20mm Vulcan autocannon. It is primarily used for
                 anti-aircraft support, though it can also be used against
                 personnel and lightly armored enemy vehicles.
                    This vehicle originally saw action during the Vietnam war
                 and was supposed to be phased out by the Sgt. York
                 anti-aircraft weapon, but that program was scratched and the
                 Vulcan will probably be providing support to armored and
                 infantry units for another 10 years.
                    The Vulcan's main problems are a relatively short-range
                 weapon and no real night/fog capability. The radar it uses is
                 only good for range-finding, not search.

M198
****
Origin:          USA
Caliber:         155mm (6.1in)
Length of
Barrel:          240in (609.6cm)
Weight in
Action:          15,791lb (7.163kg)
Muzzle Velocity: 1,850ft/sec (564m/sec)
Rate of Fire:    4rds/minute
Maximum Range:   19,850yd (18,150m)
Shell Weight:    94.6lb (42.91kg)
General Notes:   This gun/howitzer has been the standard US Army and Marine
                 Corps field weapon since 1978. It is a very traditional model
                 and can be airlifted under a CH-47D helicopter, but it lacks
                 the auxiliary power unit and hyraulic actuating circuits
                 featured in most other countries' similar weapons. This means
                 that it must be man-handled into position by sheer
                 muscle-power, calling for a crew of at least 11 men. However
                 it is sturdy and reliable and has been exported to many other
                 nations, including Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Tunisia, Australia
                 and Thailand.
                    The M198 can fire every sort of 155mm projectile,
                 including Rocket Assisted Projectiles (RAP) that extend its
                 range to 32,808yd (30,000m). The US Army is now calling for a
                 new version of the M198 light enough to be carried under a
                 Black Hawk helicopter, but duplicating the older gun's
                 overall performance.

                 scouting and patrolling duties, usually behind the lines of
                 any combat operation. They have been in use since World War
                 II and go under a variety of names and designations. For this
                 description we are using the traditional US military
                 nickname, which originally stood for GP (General Purpose).
                 They are still indispensable for many rear echelon duties and
                 scouting missions where a 30 ton armored vehicle cannot or
                 should not go. Their survivability in a combat situation,
                 however, depends entirely on their speed and the skill of the
                 driver.
                    The usual armament of these vehicles depends on the
                 infantry weapons carried by the occupants. A simple,
                 unarmored jeep can be deadly to a plane if one of its
                 passengers is carrying a Stinger.
                    The classic jeep is now being slowly replaced by the HMMW
                 (High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle) or Hummer,
                 which discards the familiar open sides of the jeep for an
                 enclosed vehicle. The HMMW is used as a weapons platform.

TRUCK
*****
Origin:          USA and other NATO nations
Crew:            1+?
Armament:        Varies
Dimensions:      Varies
Combat Weight:   Varies
Engine:          Varies
Performance:     Road speed approximately 50mph (80km/h)
General Notes:   This designation is given to all wheeled vehicles that are
                 used for hauling troops and supplies to rear-echelon areas
                 where they can be loaded into armored carriers for the final
                 stage of travel to the front.
                    Many current models are built with six or eight wheels to
                 enhance their off-road maneuverability, but they are still
                 much slower than tanks across country and are more easily
                 slowed or stopped by rough terrain. However, they are much
                 cheaper to build and perform a vital service behind the
                 lines. The concept of being behind "lines" is one that has
                 lost credibility in the current atmosphere of rapid
                 deployment and movement. Rear echelon vehicles like trucks
                 can find themselves in the forward echelon only too easily.
                    Like the jeep, the truck can be a surprise to tank or
                 aircraft if its passengers are carrying potent infantry
                 weapons.


D. TECH SPECS, THE OPPOSITION.
******************************
The following are descriptions of the enemy vehicles that your M1A1 is likely
to encounter. Much of the following information is not necessary for game
play, but is very handy if you want to know your enemy. Naturally, much of
this information is a "best guess." In some cases we don't even know enough to
guess about the specifications of a vehicle.

                 gradient 60%
General Notes:   This tank was never part of the USSR armored forces, but is
                 common in Warsaw Pact and other Soviet-influenced countries.

T-80
****
Origin:          USSR
Crew:            3
Armament:        One 125mm Gun; one 7.62mm coaxial machine gun; one 12.7mm AA
                 machine gun.
Armor:           Heavy
Dimensions:      Length including main armament 32ft 6in (9.9m); hull length
                 24ft 3in (7.4m); width 11ft 2in (3.4m); height 7ft 3in
                 (2.2m).

                 gradient 60%
General Notes:   This is the latest Soviet Main Battle Tank and has not been
                 exported out of the Soviet Union. It boasts a thermal-imaging
                 system similar to that in the M-1 and a gun stabilizing
                 system that allows it to shoot on the run with some accuracy.

MI-24 (NATO DESIGNATION - HIND).
********************************
Origin:          USSR
Crew:            2
Engines:         Two 2,200shp Isotov TV3-117 Turboshafts
Dimensions:      Main rotor diameter 55ft 9in (estimated) (17m); length with
                 turning rotors 68ft 11in (21m); fuselage length 60ft 8in
                 (18.5m); height with rotors turning 21ft 4in (6.5m).
Weights:         Empty 18,000lb (8182kg); normal (estimated) loaded 24,000lb
                 (10,910kg).
Performance:     Maximum level speed 200mph (320 [In service] kph); cruising
                 speed 183 mph (295kph); maximum rate of climb 2,953ft/min
                 (900m/min); combat radius up to 600 miles (960 km).
General Notes:   The Hind is an extremely versatile attack helicopter which,
                 besides its primary mission of destroying any target it sees
                 with its small arsenal of cannon and missiles, can also be
                 used to ferry small numbers of troops into combat, ferry
                 smaller numbers out of combat (on stretchers), or transport
                 vital cargo into a battle zone. It is a reliable and
                 well-protected helicopter that is still in production even
                 though the M-28 (Havoc) is beginning to replace it. Most
                 Warsaw Pact countries feature this aircraft in their
                 arsenals.

SU-25 (NATO DESIGNATION FROGFOOT).
**********************************
Origin:          USSR
Crew:            1
Armament:        Varies
Dimensions:      Length 49ft 2.6in (15m); Span 46ft 10.8in (14.3m); Height
                 16ft 4.9in (5m).
Weights:         Empty 19,200lbs (8,709kg); Maximum take-off 40,000lb
                 (12,700kg); Maximum external load 12,000lb (5,443kg).
Engines:         Two Tumanskii R-13-300 turbojets with 11,250lb (5,100kg)
                 military thrust.
Performance:     Max Velocity 0.74 Mach; Ceiling Not Known; Initial Climb Rate
                 Not Known; Take-off run 1,500ft (457m); Landing run 1,200ft
                 (366m); Operational radius 300 miles (556km)
General Notes:   This plane first appeared in 1981 and has been exported to
                 Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Iraq. It is a ground support
                 aircraft that does not have an internal tank-busting cannon
                 like the A-10 but has lots of wing-bearing capacity for guns,
                 bombs and rockets. It has a greater speed than the A-10, but
                 is not considered to be as maneuverable or as survivable.

BMP-2
*****
Origin:          USSR
Crew:            3+7
Armament:        One 30mm cannon; one 7.62mm coaxial machine gun; one launcher
                 for AT-5 Spandrel anti-tank missiles; three smoke dischargers
                 on each side of turret.
Armor:           1.29in (33mm) maximum
Dimensions:      Length 22ft (6.71m), width 10ft 2in (3.1m), height 6ft 9in
                 (2.06m).
Combat Weight:   32,187lb (14,600kg or 16 tons)
Ground Pressure: 9.1lb/sq in (0.64kg/cm)
Engine:          6-cylinder super-charged diesel developing 400hp (298kW).
Performance:     Road Speed 40mph (65km/h), range 372 miles (600km), vertical
                 obstacle 2ft 3in (0.7m), trench 8ft 2in (2.5m), gradient 60%
General Notes:   This is the successor to the BMP-1, the first infantry
                 fighting vehicle that brought heavy firepower and the ability
                 of the troops inside to fire at outside targets through
                 firing ports to the battlefield.
                    The BMP-2 is used by several Warsaw Pact countries as well
                 as the USSR; it carries seven infantrymen and is fully
                 amphibious. The hull is also used to carry other specialized
                 weaponry. The two BMPs look very similar at a distance.

ZSU-23-4 SHILKA
***************
Origin:          USSR
Crew:            4
Armament:        4*23mm cannon
Dimensions:      Length 21ft 6in (6.54m), width 9ft 8in (2.95m), height with
                 radar up 12ft 6in (3.8m), without radar 7ft 5in (2.25m).
Combat Weight:   45,194lb (20,500kg or 22.5 tons)
Ground Pressure: 9.8lb/sq.in. (0.69kg/cm)
Engine:          6-cylinder inline diesel developing 280hp (208kW)
Performance:     Road speed 27.3mph (44km/h), range 280 miles (450km),
                 vertical obstacle 3ft 7in (1.1m), trench 9ft 2in (2.8m),
                 gradient 60%
General Notes:   This is a very modern weapon with target search and
                 acquisition fire control radar. It is slower than its
                 American Vulcan counterpart, but has better cross-country
                 performance and can keep up with the tanks better. More
                 important, it is an all-weather weapon capable of operating
                 efficiently at any time and in any conditions.
                    Unlike most modern tanks, however, the Shilka has to be
                 stopped to use its weaponry effectively, though it can find
                 targets on the move.

D-30
****
Origin:          USSR
Caliber:         121.92mm (4.8in)
Length of
Barrel:          191.9in (487.5cm)
Weight in
Action:          6,944lb (3.150kg)
Muzzle Velocity: 2,438ft/sec (740m/sec)
Rate of Fire:    7-8rds/minute
Maximum Range:   16,842yd (15,400m)
Shell Weight:    47.97lb (21.76kg)
General Notes:   The D-30 is best categorized as a "gun howitzer" because it
                 has the high trajectory of the traditional howitzer, but the
                 long barrel of the traditional field gun. Besides the
                 standard High Explosive (HE) shells described above, it can
                 also fire Rocket Assisted Projectiles (RAP) an additional
                 7,000yd (6,500m).
                    This gun has been widely exported to Warsaw Pact and other
                 countries, and it is now copied and exported by Egypt and the
                 People's Republic of China.
                    The D-30 is unusual in that its recoil mechanism is on the
                 top of the barrel, instead of the traditional
                 under-the-barrel position, and is towed by its barrel. Also,
                 its unique three-leg deployment and the ability to raise its
                 wheels above the legs give it a rapid 360 degree traverse.

TRUCK
*****
Origin:          USSR and Warsaw Pact nations
Crew:            1+?
Armament:        Varies
Dimensions:      Varies
Combat Weight:   Varies
Engine:          Varies
Performance:     Road speed approximately 50mph (80km/h)
General Notes:   This designation is given to all wheeled vehicles that are
                 used for hauling troops and supplies to rear-echelon areas
                 where they can be loaded into armored carriers for the final
                 stage of travel to the front.
                    Many current models are built with six or eight wheels to
                 enhance their off-road maneuverability, but they are still
                 much slower than tanks across country and are more easily
                 slowed or stopped by rough terrain. However, they are much
                 cheaper to build and perform a vital service behind the
                 lines. The concept of being behind "lines" is one that has
                 lost credibility in the current atmosphere of rapid
                 deployment and movement. Rear echelon vehicles like trucks
                 can find themselves in the forward echelon only too easily.
                    Trucks and their personnel are mostly a hazard to a tank
                 commander in terms of the man-portable anti-tank and
                 anti-aircraft weapons they may be carrying.
