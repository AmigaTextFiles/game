            CRIME BECAMES OUR PROFESSION

SCAPEGHOST

Alan Chance was on an undercover mission, trying to infil-
trate a drugs gang.

All was going well, but then something or someone alerted
the gangsters and they killed Alan and escaped, taking his
colleague Sarah as a hostage.

His fellow police falsely blame a mistake of Alan's for
tipping off the criminals.

Alan has three nights as a ghost to disprove this false
accusation,clear his name and gain revenge. Use his detec-
tive skills and growing spirit powers to delay the gangs-
tars, track down thier new hideout and bring them to
justice.

OK.

The light remained off. Ace made as if to applaud, but
thought better of it.

> IN
I went inside and found myself in the vestry of St. Amigas
chapel listening to the drone of PC fans and prayer disks.
a bell, a bottle and a candle.

> SCORE
I scored 15 out of 1000.

> RAM SAVE
OK. (Before doing anything with these strange objects, save
     the positions in Ram - i.e. in the computer's memory
     in case you encounter difficulties and want to return to
     this point using RAM LOAD. To save on disc or anythink
     else.

> EXAMINE ALL BUT THE CANDLE
Bell: it was a small golden ornament. Bottle: as I reached
for thebottle of holy water, I felt my strength drain away.
I could not move, even to step back from the bottle !

> RAM LOAD
Ok. I was inside St. Amiga's chapel, listening to the drone
of PC fans and prayer disks. I could see a bell, a bottle and
a candle.

> TAKE BELL
I took the bell. I dropped the key. (Ghosts are relatively
weak and cannot levitate many things at once).

> GO TO MEMORIAL (letting the computer work out the route
Pressany key to abandon this type of "high level" command)

I floated north and was outside St. Amiga's chapel of rest.

I floated north and found myself beside a fallen oak tree.
I floated east and was outside the Sinclair family vault.
Exists led west and inside.

> RING BELL
Slowly and with a great noise, the side ot the vault swung
open.....................................


HINTS

Draw a map (or a series of maps). Remember that the EXISTS ON
command lists all the paths from each location.

To make life easy for you, the objects that matter in a loca-
tion are normally listed in a sentence like, "You can see Ace
 and a key".

Examine all the objects that you see. Most are useful.

Use the "high level" commands, such as GOT TO CHAPEL, RUN TO
SHED,FOLLOW DOG, WAIT 5, WHICH DO THE WORK OF MANY INSTRUCTIONS.

Pressing a key "breaks" out of such commands.

Try everything you can think of even weird or dangerous actions
sometimes provide clues, and might be fun. You can use UNDO
(or Load if you have previously used SAVE) to recover if the
  results are "fatal".

You can word commands in many different ways. For example, if
there were an axe and a ball on the ground, you could take the
axe by:

> GET THE AXE
> TAKE AXE
> GET ALL BUT THE BALL
> LOOK AT THE AXE AND TAKE IT

If the game doesn't understand your command, try rephrasing it
and using synonyms. If the game still doesn't understand, you are
probably trying something that is not important.



HINTS FOR PART 1
================

* build up your strength as a ghost:
* recruit your fellow spirits:
* buy time by delaying the gang's criminal plans

HINTS FOR PART 2
================

* once in the gang's old hideout, collect clues to help the police
  work out where they have moved to;
* allert the emergency services and make sure that they
  trip over something really dramatic, so they know foul play is
  involved.

HINTS FOR PART 3
================

* distract the lookout while the police are arriving:
* rescue the hostage and prevent the gang destroying
  the evidence.
