[33mCheat Machine[32m Version 1.04, Registered[0m

Thanks for registering the Cheat Machine!  Your registration fee has 
entitled you to an upgraded pfile & database, as well as decryption of the
database and an Index Creator to be used when you make additions or 
deletions to the Database itself.  Also, you now have access to the 
CATPAN BBS (303)494-4825, where you can always find the newest version
of both the pfile and the database.  

Version 1.04 was compiled to work with all variations of Cnet 1.95 through
1.99, but will not work with versions prior to 1.95.
Rest assured that I will continue to support the Cheat Machine, and will
make sure that it is compatible with all future versions of Cnet Amiga.
(Within reason, I guarantee compatibility with all versions up to 2.0,
after that I can not make 100% guarantees.  Hopefully when Cnet 2.0 hits 
town, the format of C-pfiles will not change as rapidly as it has to this
point.  If for some reason I can no longer support the CheatMachine after
2.0, I will provide source code to registered owners.)

Ok, now some things you need to know about this new version:

1)  A configuration file is now included so that you may enter a path where
    you wish the Cheat Machine to reside.  All CM files must reside in the
    same path.  Also, you may enter your BBS name and Sysop name which will
    appear to users during various pfiles processes.  And lastly you may
    declare a maximum # of searches per call if you wish.
    [33mImportant:[0m  CMconfig must reside in the pfiles directory!
    
2)  The database is complete.  At the time of this writing (Dec. 12, 1991),
    there are 367 game cheats.  Also, the database is now decrypted.  It is
    strictly a text file(CMlist) that you may edit/add/delete in any way
    you wish with any text editor, as long as you remember to follow the
    format of the file, ie. ^E following every cheat, and all Cheat Titles
    must be completely in UPPER CASE.  Note:  ^E = <Shift>6 + Captial E,
    this is not a control sequence.  (Alot of work went into compiling
    CMlist, so please do not re-distribute the list in any way, shape or form.
    It is meant to be used ONLY in conjunction with the Cheat Machine.)
 
    Once your editing is complete, use the CreateIndex program from the
    Cnet shell, or your CLI to create a new index for Cheat Machine to use.
    Running CreateIndex with the Argument 'I' will give you instructions.
    Before you run CreateIndex, make sure your edits are complete and that
    CMlist resides in its appropriate Cnet directory.  CreateIndex will
    ask you for a path.  It uses this path to read CMlist, and this is where
    it will save CMindex.  And, as usual, make sure you make a backup of the
    CMlist and CMindex files before you do this.
    
The installation process has changed a bit, but is basically still the
same.  Make sure you review this procedure.
NOTE:  These files should replace the old ones of the same name.

[32mInstallation:[0m
 
The Cheat Machine Disk should contain the following 12 files:
[33mCheatMachine95[0m - The actual Pfile(use with versions 1.95)
[33mCheatMachine96[0m - The actual Pfile(use with versions 1.96)
[33mCheatMachine97[0m - The actual Pfile(use with versions 1.97)
[33mCheatMachine98[0m - The actual Pfile(use with versions 1.98)
[33mCheatMachine99[0m - The actual Pfile(use with versions 1.98+ & 1.99)
[33mCMlist[0m       - List of game cheats/hints/solves
[33mCMindex[0m      - Index to the database
[33mCMabout[0m      - Online instructions for using the Cheat Machine
[33mCMreadme[0m     - The file your are reading now
[33mCMmenus[0m      - Skypix, ANSI, ASCII menus
[33mCMconfig[0m     - Configuration file
[33mCMShareware_Notice[0m - Information regarding the use of this program
[33mCreateIndex[0m  - C program to be run from the CLI that creates a new
                        database index when changes are made to the database
                        file with a text-editor.
                        
First, edit the CMconfig file with any text editor.  Choose a path, SysOp
name, BBS name, and Max searches.  Make sure that your path ends with a '/'
if it is not a device,  and make sure to follow the format of the config
file(; following every variable).  
[33mNow place CMconfig in your PFILES:  If it is not here, the Cheat
Machine will search PFILES: for all the needed files!![0m

Now copy the rest of the files to the directory corresponding to the Path
you set in the CMconfig file.  (CreateIndex can be placed anywhere you want,
and CMShareware_notice/CMreadme do not have to be in the path)

Using the DOS rename command, eliminate the 95, 96, 97, 98 or 99 extension from
the pfile which matches the version of Cnet you are using(In other words,
"rename CheatMachine99, CheatMachine").  Also, eliminate the numeric suffix
from any other files that may require it. (ie. CMAbout.99 = CMAbout)
Next log onto your BBS and using the [33mA[0m command, add the Pfile
"CheatMachine" in the appropriate directory.

Use the following parameters:

Title of Item  : CheatMachine
Subdirectory?  : No
Program File?  : Yes
AREXX program? : No
Access (all)   : <return>
Description    : Amiga Games Cheat Database
Date +/-/*=now : *
Days to Keep   : <return>
MCI Environ (0): 32
Exclusive use? : No

Note:  This program was written in SAS C, so make sure your AREXX flag is set
       to no.  Also, I have been using this program with the Exclusive flag
       set to no and have had no problems with multiple users using it at the
       same time, but should you have any problems, I would recommend setting
       it to Yes.

AUSTERLITZ
 1. Before you can get very far into the game you must understand the
       ordering system. A handwritten order is dispatched by a rider who
       takes it to the relevant corps commander while (hopefully) avoiding
       the enemy and any routing units. If received, orders aren't carried
       out immediately - relevant commanders must be informed and their
       units may be several miles from the HQ. You may never know if your
       orders reach their destination or if they are misunderstood down
       the chain of command.

    2. It is a good idea to ask for battle reports every half-an-hour or so,
       especially from heavily engaged units. The corps commander will
       normally send a couple of messages with the rider who returns his
       combat reports, giving information concerning the status of his men.
       Even if the news seems irrelevant, you will learn more about how
       your troops are doing than if the corps commander only seldom sends
       a report.

    3. Artillery is precious and should not be wasted. Royal Horse Artillery
       can move very fast - they can shell one target and abruptly change
       location to shell another. Move your artillery to high ground as
       soon as possible where it has a clear field of fire all around and
       is difficult to dislodge.

    4. Do not try ordering routing or disordered units because they will
       ignore you. Routing units usually retreat away from the enemy, but
       can blunder into deadly artillery fire. Beware if they pass near
       your HQ because several important riders may be caught up in the
       rush and killed. Routs are worse than disorders and routing units
       may become disordered before they rally and be ordered again. Keep
       a it out of battle for a while when it rallies and when engaged,
       ensure allied units are ready to give support if necessary.

    5. Surround stubborn enemy units instead of assaulting them head-on.
       This will ensure that no messages leave or reach the unit and it is
       completely isolated making it easier to destroy.

    6. It is possible for "Blitzkrieg" tactics to succeed. Your cavalry,
       while being supported by horse artillery, can penetrate the enemy
       lines. When the enemy is weakened enough, he can be routed by the
       slower moving infantry and foot artillery units.

  Hints For Napoleon :

    1. Davout's corps are several miles from the HQ and your riders will
       take time to reach him. He, with Merle, Fery and Maragon, are in
       danger of being cut off from the rest of the army. Order these corps
       as soon as possible or they will form a defence line and retreat if
       they can't hold ground.

    2. Trielhard's divisions can form a rearguard to replace lost or routing
       units. At the end of the day, they can be used to charge the enemy
       off the field when he's weak.

    3. Reinforce Lannes as he prepares to repel the attacks of Bagration,
       two miles to the east. He is heavily outnumbered with his 16 units
       facing Bagration's 24 and although an offensive line will need more
       men, he can defeat Bargration with minimal casualties when defending,
       especially on rough ground.

    4. Girschowitz, Puntowitz and Schlapanitz are usually the scenes of
       fierce battles so try to hold them if you can. Your troops can later
       regroup here. Remember, the terrain favours a defensive stance.

  Hints For Alexander :

    1. The Austrian militia under Kollerwrath are poor quality and can be
       relied on to rout very easily. However, they are good cannon fodder
       and can be sacrificed to hold off artillery fire when you attack the
       enemy elsewhere.

    2. Bagration is in prime position to attack the northern French flank
       and if he advances fast enough (by smashing Lannes' corps) he can
       be a serious threat to the enemy HQ. Napoleon may even have to move
       the HQ futher from his troops and waste valuable time reinforcing
       Lannes' troops.

    3. You have enough forces to split the French army in half, possibly
       at Kobelnitz. If this is achieved, communications will be cut
       because all the riders trying to barge through your troops will be
       killed. Napoleon must now either send his riders on a long detour
       or try to break through your troops, both of which will be costly
       and time consuming. During this period the French commanders will
       their own initiative and (hopefully) launch unsuccessful and
       uncoordinated attacks. It's doubtful the French can now recover the
       position.

AWESOME
To become indestructable, gain infinite money and fuel, complete the first
attack level.  When the shields/weapons screen appears, move the cursor to
the top left corner of the screen. This will place it in the shields box.  Now
press the joystick button while hitting the + key on the keypad.  The screen
will flash, indicating that the cheat mode has been activated.  If the screen
does not flash,  keep pressing fire and hitting the + key simulataneously. It
will work eventually.  Now transfer all the energy to the weapons.  Shields
can still be drained by hits and colliding with objects, but once it reaches
000, the ship cannot be destroyed.

To win at the game, simply choose the last planet as the destination.  Once
you enter the spaceport, there will be a short animation showing your ship
leaving the galaxy.
^E
BAAL
During the load, push the right mouse button for infinite lives as the screen
blanks.

In the second cavern there is a force filed that seems impossible to get
rid of. To get to the time machine chunk beyond it, simply fall off the
right side of the phone booth platform above.

Here  are  all  the coordinates of all the jetpack platforms, in the order
you should go to them to finish the game. X/Y, X being width and Y being
height:

Level 1: 31/16 (cartridge 2), 02/25, 52/30 (cartridge 3), 51/00, 24/38,
62/13,
02/50, 64/49, 33/58 (exit to level 2).

Level  2: 34/30, 54/12 (cartridge 4), 16/12, 00/24, 03/34, 30/47, 54/12 (exit
to level 3).

The jetpack isn't used on level 3.

(untested, dont know what it does yet)
Get a high score over 1,000 points then quit game by holding joystick

BANE OF THE COSMIC FORGE (WIZARDRY)
The password to  enter the door  in the  SE  tower of the 1st level is
SNOOPCHERI. Use the ROTTEN CHEESE on the MOUSEHOLE.

     Some small help for playing the game successfully:

     A tremendous source for playing  the game can be found in getting BANE
     OF THE COSMIC FORGE COMPILATION  released by Baser Evil  on the 6th of
     March, it contains many helpful maps to the game with marked location.

     When you create  your characters,  it may be a  good idea just to make
     all of them Dracons.  This is untested,  but unless  you have at least
     one of this fire breathing race you  surely wont survive the game.  So
     mabey it would  be good  to have more.  Use a good mix of the classes,
     try to take one of each  spell class and a good solid theif that is at
     full strength.  Get a good enough thief  and you dont  need a fighter.
     It may be slow, but keep rolling till you get the best character poss-
     ible. Be sure to make at least  one character female, there are places
     in the game where this is a must. Dont do it and be sorry later!

     Diversify your skills.  Have each character specialise in a few skills
     relative to his class.  Do not worry about  developing weapons skills,
     you have no use for them if you created your party correctly.

     In fights early in the game use Dracons breath attack, just be careful
     not to overextend yourself. Rest after each encounter, backing up your
     hard work. Allways search the rea after a combat.

     Search each square you step in.  Not only this,  but search facing all
     four directions, many things can only be found that way.

     Thieves are  not always true.  If you find a lock  and have your thief
     open it,  allways guess  it is POISON unless  you are 100%  sure (i.e.
     tried it before) because it is better to suffer something else than to
     die by getting this wrong.

     Dont bash  doors early  in the game!  If your characters  are not very
     strong you  will be sorry.  Jammed doors do you no good,  as you might
     never be able to open them again. Same foes for picking the lock. Wait
     till you get a caster capable of conjuring  KNOCK KNOCK  with at least
     18 points (prefereably 24) and do it this way. It is much more sure.

     Once you know  there are secret  panels or buttons,  keep walking past
     them until you discover them. You can find them by looking at the maps
     and know where they are, sometimes it takes awhile to sense them.

^E
BARBARIAN
Boot and run the game as usual, but at some point after the game has started,
type in:  04-08-59   ...It will make the Barbarian character almost
invincible, but he can still be killed by very high falls, and by the
flame-hurling horned demon in the dungeon deep, pictured on the cover. After
you type 04-08-59  the screen will turn gray, telling you that you're
invincible. Once you make it to Necron, you must have a shield.  Face Necron
when he turns to face you.  When he throws a fireball at you, press the
defense button as it hits your shield.

BARBARIAN II
step-by-step walk-thru:

Level 1: left, left, right seven times, left, right, left, in the cave, and
right. Level  2: right, up, left, up, left, left, right, left three times,
up,
and left. Level  3: up, right, right, up, left, right, up, right, left, left,
up, left, left, up, up, right, right, left, left, up. Level  4: hit the
fireballs, then try to leap across. Several low chops will destroy it.  Next
is the Pit Demon; when he reaches out, use an overhead chop to hit his arms;
repeat until death. Next, Drax himself! Wait  until he pauses between spells,
and hit him with a flying head chop!  The End...

BARDS TALE I - TALES OF THE UNKNOWN
To get more gold than you will ever need (and then some), transfer all the
parties gold to one player. Save him to disk then load him back up and
transfer all to another. Keep repeating this process till you have done it to
all the players, then exit without saving. Load back up and all your players
will have the amount of gold equal to that of the entire party before.
Reapeat until satisfied.

BATTLEHAWKS 1942
    1. One useful thing to know is the promotion levels relating to the
       missions. Some ranks are only given to certain nationalities, but for
       the most part they're the same for both Japan and America. The ranks
       are, CADET, ENSIGN, ACTING LIEUTENANT, LIEUTENANT JUNIOR, LIEUTENANT,
       LIEUTENANT COMMANDER and COMMANDER.

    2. Learn the characteristics of each plane before embarking on combat
       missions. While Japanese aircraft are generally more manoeuvrable
       than their American counterparts they don't have the same sturdy level
       of protection. Another thing to remember is that the KATE torpedo
       bomber has no front-firing weapons, so think twice before using this
       plane.

    3. A plane won't necessarily burn up or disintergrate before it crashes
       into the ocean. Sometimes the pilot can be shot while still flying,
       so that his vessel will plunge into the Pacific with little visible
       damage. Keep a look out for pilots attempting to trick the enemy by
       faking a crash - the sneaky basts...

    4. On attack missions, it is sometimes better to devastate the enemy CAP
       before starting your own attack run. Other pilots in your squadron
       should meanwhile have carried out their bombing runs and eliminated
       some of the opposition. If they have, then life should be alot easier,
       since damaged ships fire little or no flack. It is better to bomb an
       undamaged vessel, even if it isn't a carrier, because there is a good
       chance that ships already on fire will sink anyway. Also, your chances
       of promotion are much greater if several enemy vessels have sunk or
       been set on fire.

    5. Torpedo hits generally do more damage than dive-bombing, because thay
       hit vessels at the vital point below the waterline. When torpedoing a
       ship, try to release the missle at the last possible moment. This will
       cause maximum damage and means that the ship has less chance to dodge
       the attack. There is a good chance that a ship will sink after just
       one hit using this tactic, especially if you are using the LONG LANCE
       type torpedo.

    6. Bombers are formidable opponents, since all except the Japanese KATE
       bomber are armed with front and rear guns. These planes are vulnerable
       to attacks from the side, but this tactic isn't always possible.
       Another way to get them is as follows.
          Fly behind and slightly below the enemy plane, so that the rear
       guns can't get you. Now when you get in range you should be able to
       pick them off with relative ease. If any planes break away from the
       formation to get away from your shots, then this will leave them open
       to a side attack. This technique is difficult to use against torpedo
       bombers, as thay fly close to the surface of the ocean will attacking.

    7. The more explosions occur on the decks of ships, the more chance they
       stand of sinking. Hanging around blasting the decks of ships increases
       the possibility of them sinking, so it's a good idea to inflict as
       much damage as possible on the ship as quickly as you can, then at
       least one of the ships will have sunk by the end of the mission.
          A CARRIER will normally sink after taking three torpedo hits. A
       BATTLESHIP can be sunk using a single torpedo, particularly if it is
       launched from close range.

    8. If an enemy plane hassles you and causes problems, dive towards the
       ocean and any nearby ships - even if they're the enemy. You'll have
       to dodge the flack, but so will any planes attempting to follow you.
       They'll be so intent on firing at you that they won't avoid the flack
       and will get it in the neck from their own side!!

    9. Japanese pilots occasionally attempt kamikaze attacks on allied
       shipping. This is usually done for a couple of reasons - either they
       have suffered heavy losses early in the mission or they've missed
       with all their warheads. Occasionally, the pilot of a badly-damaged
       plane will aim it at a ship and bail out just before impact. A
       kamikaze attack causes so much damage that a ship may sink straight
       away. Tricky, but the squadron leader is often well rewarded. Remember
       only to adopt this tactic on the 16th ATTACK mission - just before
       retiring.

   10. Here's a way to dive much quicker than usual - useful for getting out
       of tricky situations. Begin your dive as normal, then switch to the
       rear gunner. The altimeter will now spin round much quicker than usual
       until you switch to front view. This also works when objects in the
       distance seem to take a long time to arrive.

BLOODWYCH
Hints :

  A good way of starting this game is to recruit your way through all of the
  Bloodwych characters taking their stuff, then dismissing them. You can now
  sell all the weapons you don't want, to end up with about 200 coinage. You
  will also have a plentiful supply of food and keys, so remember to have only
  one character carrying the keys to save on backpack space.
      Usually, the best combination of characters is to have two fighters at
  the front and two wizards at the back. It's difficult to say which colours
  are the best, since they all have spells which come in useful fairly often.
  The yellow Vivify spell is probably the best, but aome red spells such as
  Vitalise, Fireball and Firebath tend to be the most frequently used. Note
  that the first time you use the Vivify spell, you will need about 70 or 80
  spell points if the character casting the spell isn't yellow.
      Any items you come across can be sold to any creature, so long as they
  are not one of the characters you robbed at the start of the game. You can
  easily maintain the maximum of 99 coins this way.
      When fighting, make sure you don't get trapped using the "hack and step
  back" method only to realise that you haven't saved the game for some time.
  It is possible to get out of this situation by using the Confuse and Terror
  spells and talking. Keep boasting about how great you are and then threaten
  the creature. Every now and then it will turn and run, but sadly this is
  quite rare.
      Here is a tip called "hiding behind the door" and this is how it is
  done : Stand to one side of a wooden door with a creature on the other side
  and keep clicking on the fight icon until the creature opens the door.
  Sometimes it is possible to get a hit in from both of your front characters
  and close the door before the creature hits you. If the creature then opens
  the door straight away, you won't need to click on the fight icon again.
      If, however there is a delay, then you'll probably have to keep hitting
  it. If you're worried that one of your characters is going to die, then
  lock the door using the Magelock, as it's quite easy to make the mistake of
  locking the door open if you use a key. With the door locked you can give
  your characters a rest, allowing them to recuperate ready for the next
  fight.
^E
BOMBUZAL
When reaching a new level, it's worthwhile to sacrifice a life to see the
explosion pattern.  When trying to detonate a pulsing bomb, pick it up; it's
easier to see its size.  You are invulnerable to explosions when teleporting,
so use it to your advantage!  A blind droid can't activate switches.  Also,
here's a revised list of the level access codes:

BUBBLE BOBBLE
If you can  get to boards  10, 20, 30 & 40  without  dying a door will appear
to take you to a secret level. On boards 7 & 22 wait a few seconds until the
umbrella falls and grab it,  you will warp ahead 6 levels.

     F1 - advance 1 screen
     F2 - advance 6 screens
     F3 - advance 11 screens

While in the first screen, bubble the first two monsters and then fill the
screen with hundreds of bubbles.  Bubble and burst the remaining monster and
the remaining bubbles should turn into fruit (usually bananas), each of which
is worth 500 points.  Also, Hold down the fire button after losing your last
life, and you should get another set of lives, though your score will be
reset.  Beating level 100:  jump on the small platforms to collect all the
green potion bottles.  they will give you lightning bolts.  Jump down
alongside the wall and let that monster have it!!  After 100 hits, he will
turn into a bubble.  Pop him and you've done it!

CAPONE
To find the "special bonus", go to the front of the Post Office.  Shoot the
ball at the top of the flag pole, and your score will go way up.  If you
shoot it again, you'll see a screen of the programmers!  Shoot again and
you'll be invincible, standing in the bank.  At the end of that round, you
will start at the beginning, except you'll be in warp speed.

CAPTAIN BLOOD
Walk-Through:

At the start of the game you will automatically be in orbit around an alien
planet.  Transport down and try to find an alien, preferably Yuko, if it
isn't Yuko, it may be best to restart the game as he is the key to the game.
Talk to Yuko about his father, Maxon, and you will find he is in prison. He
will also give you the coordinates for Croolis Ulv, where you will find
another alien. While you are talking to Yuko, he will give you the code
1010; this always remains the same. Go to Croolis Ulv and you will be given
the co-ordinates for Croolis Var. Go there and destroy  it, then go back to
Croolis-Ulv. The alien will now be nice to you, keep talking to him and you
will get the coordinates for the Forbidden planet. Go to the Forbidden planet
(Sinox), and you will meet a guardian robot.  Give him the code you received
from Yuko.  Now watch what happens. Also, During  hyperspace, hold down the
left mouse button, and right-click repeatedly. This will shorten the
hyperspace sequence.  And now, the complete walk-thru: Go see Buggol (Planet
Mind 137). Land and tell him "me want vote". He will tell you of
another Buggol called morlok who lives on planet Rosko 1. Keep talking until
you get the coordinates. Go see Morlok. Say to him:  "Me not vote Morlok, me
want Yukas president". He will give you the coordinates of a planet called
Female 021. Go and destroy it. Come back to Rosko 1. He will now give you the
coordinates of a planet where an Ondoyante is kept prisoner (you didn't need
to go there, though...). Go  to  exterior  view and destroy Rosko 1.
Go back to Mind 137, and go see  the  Buggol.  He now dislikes you intensely,
and will give you the coordinates  of  Rosko  2.  Go there, and teleport the
Buggol into your ship.  Find an uninhabited planet, and teleport him there.
He will say the planet is good-looking and, if you ask "Me want know
coordinates planet number = Blood", he will give you the coordinates to find
number 2. Go there,  land, and say you like him, and will not kill him. You
must  also get three sets of coordinates from him before disintegrating him
(having  made sure you saved the game beforehand). Now go around using this
method to get the coordinates out of the numbers, always killing them before
you move on.  Kill the last one, and you win!   Also, Use the alien icons and
ask CODE GG  1. You'll get coordinates GG which is another alien.  Go to the
specified planet and ask CODE INFORMATION HELP to get coordinates of all
other aliens around.  Sometimes you may need to type HELP then the name of an
alien.
^E
CARRIER COMMAND
Type  THE BEST IS YET TO BE  with game paused and hit the + key on the
numeric keypad for near invincibilty.

To take  over the island  in an action game,  load up a Manta with two
missles on each side  and three in  the middle.  Launch and fly to the
opposite side of the island, then fly in at top speed firing violently at
the enemy command centre.  This will free the island and only take about
thirty seconds.

While in the Walrus arming menu, select nine Harbinger surface to surface
missiles and put them in the AAV.  Select the Avatar Chemical Laser and place
it over the missiles.  Then select the pod you want (ACCB, Virus Bomb, Fuel)
and place it in the AAV.  Then, when you've launched the AAV, look at it's
weapons and you'll find you have BOTH missiles and laser!  On returning to
the carrier any missiles you have left will be added to the ship's stores.
Carry on doing this and hundreds of missiles can be yours.  Another cheat:
while in the pause mode, type GROW OLD ALONG WITH ME (include the spaces).
You should now see the message "Cheat mode active".  Pressing the + key on
the numeric keypad protects your Mantas and AAVs from missile attacks. The -
key can be used to turn this off.  Pressing the following keys in sequence:
'Help', Q, S, Control, Alternate, gives you a little message. Pressing the 9
on the keypad displays the current level.  6 and 8 have some other effect.
Returning to the title screen, press the + and - keys to view all objects in
the game.

it and a panel  will open up.  Reach in and grab the egg.
^E
CHAMPIONS OF KRYNN
See the entry for Pool of Radiance to find out how to cheat.

Here are some hints:

	After you get your character equipped, check into the Inn to memorize
some spells. Then, on your way to the Commandants office, stop at the bar
and have a few drinks. You can pick up some useful information on the
current situation around the area.
  First, begin by patrolling Throtl and deal with any bands of hobgoblins
you encounter. You will encounter draconians also. Kill them and escort the
women and children to the outpost, eventually reporting to the commandant.
You will then be send back to Throtl to find Caramon.
  After you defeat the hobgoblins defending the entrance, explore the
southeast quarter to determine Caramon's fate. Proceed up the corridor
that runs through the middle of Throtl to the north end of town. Explore
the northwest quarter. Here, you will meet a man who claims to be one of
Caramon's soldiers. You will also meet two friendlies, Kildirf and
Strangbourn who can be added to your party.
  The priest is in the southwest corner, but will only be there after you
rescue Caramon. After you get the key from him, search the north-south
corridor for the secret entrance to the temple. The temple is in the middle
of the northeast quarter. When you encounter the clerics, some will escape
with dragon eggs. They will flee northwest of the temple to the entrance of
an underground maze.
  The maze is fairly easy to navigate. It runs east-west and includes two
treasure rooms. The long tunnel eventually ends at a cave complex. The game
will tell you what direction to go to follow the fleeing hobgoblins. At the
end of the cave, you will be able to catch up with them. The fight is very
difficult and it is advisable to save the game previous to it. After they
are dealt with, take the exit and return to the outpost.
  You should have found a map to the next town, Gargath, in the underground
maze. There are two sets of guards at the gate, one on the ground and one
on the wall above the gate. You only need to fight your way past the ones
on the ground but you can access the ones above by the stairs to the east
or west.
  Inside, you will be met by Sir Karl"s agent who will explain to you the
plan. Begin to search the town. There is a group of commanders that have
a map showing the secret doors in the wooden structure and who also have
some excellent weapons. Once you fight your way into the wooden structure,
you will have to use the look command to find the hidden entrance.
  Once inside, search the first floor and note the back exit. Go up to
the second floor and look for the imprisoned castellan. He will tell you
where the Dragonlance is. Go up to the forth floor and look for the
gambling guards. Join them before attacking them. Proceed up to the sixth
floor where you will find  Myrtani. You will chase him to the top to battle
him. Save the game before this battle. After the battle, go back downstairs
and exit by the secret exit you  found earlier. Return to the outpost. Check
to see if your character can train for a new level.
  Around this time, you will be asked by Sir Karl to go to Jelek and get
him a rose. As you are doing this, check out the magic shop along the way.
You will also find a useful armory and Sykla, who will  be important later.
Finding the rose will set up an interesting side story but it is not
necessary for completion of the game. At outpost 2, you will get orders
about Sir Dargaard's tomb, outpost 3, and the ogre camp. It is important
that you do these missions sometime before Sanction. Sometime, before
Sanction, Sir Karl will be kidnaped. Once this happens, do not visit the
commandant.
  Jelek is the next place to visit. You will meet Skyla at Jelek. You can
explore the town with him and enjoy yourself. Eventually, he will leave
and you will meet Mysellia. Go with her to the graveyard and talk with
the gravedigger. Explore the graveyard. (The rose is in the northwest corner)
Beware of the dragons guarding the rose bush. The building there has treasure
and an exit from Jelek. You can return to Jelek if necessary to buy from the
magic shop.
  Sir Dargaard's Tomb is next. You must have a night to complete this maze
and the potions of healing from the Jelek shop are useful also. Sir
Dargaard's Tomb is in the southeast quarter but can't be entered until your
knight has completed the trials of honor. To start the trial of battle,
go west from the entrance. To start the trial of fear, go east from the
entrance. To start the trial of honors, go north from the entrance. Once
you have completed them, you can enter the tomb and take the treasure.
The armor you will find is excellent but it can only be worn by knights.
Rest before leaving because you will encounter draconians on the way out.
  The Ogre camp is the next maze. Go north of the entrance where you
will meet an old ogre who is friendly. He will tell you a password to get
the patrols to leave you alone. The first thing is to find Morog's quarters.
 The old ogre will tell you the general area. Next, find and kill the
assassins. They are in the northwest corner of the mansion. The assassins
are a tough battle. You will face an Aurak in this battle so be careful.
After this is done, find the ogre meeting in the center room of the
mansion. You will have sufficient evidence to prove Morogs deceit. After
killing Morog, the ogre chief will propose an alliance. Accept it.
  At outpost 3, the key to solving the mystery is to rest in the inn. Find
the back entrance to the jail once you understand the situation. The
information to end the menace is there. Rescue the children, go back
to the jail and an uprising will start. You will have to find the renegade
commander in the commandants office. You will also have to fight the
dragon in the room north of the commandants office. Save before going in.
  The next maze is Neraka. Neraka can be entered with Maya or by yourself.
If you agreed to help her earlier, she will accompany your party to town.
The first door to the south leads to the secret base. Go to the south and
west where you will find Sir Karl. Maya will leave with the body. Next,
you need to rescue the prisoners. Once you have entered the prison, the
door to the west leads to some prisoners being tortured. The doors to
the east lead to some empty cells and some more prisoners. Kill the
prison lord to the southwest after you have freed the prisoners. Save the
game and leave by the back entrance. (More dragons) If you enter the town
by yourself, you will enter in the northwest corner. It is an optional
mission.
  Sanction is the next maze; it has three parts. The first mission is to
clear Santion itself. Kill the minotaur guards at the piers in the west
side of town. There is one other fixed encounter with minotaurs at the
tavern and a fixed encounter with mercenaries in the middle of the town.
The only safe place to rest in Sanction is the Inn in the southeast corner
of town. Avoid the north room of the Inn because it sets the end-game in
motion. Explore the east side of Sanction. You will find a training hall,
an armory, and a weapons shop. You will also find bridges which access the
temple. Do not use them. There is treasure in the south side of Sanction.
Once you are satisfied you have cleared out Sanction, kill the recruiters
in the north room of the Inn. When you leave the Inn, you will hear a woman
scream to the west. Go to the waterfront and walk by the piers till you
locate the woman. Rescue her and she will tell you a secret passageway to
the temples.
  The secret passage will take you to the Huerzyd Temple. There are four
treasure stores in the Temple. Explores the rooms in the northeast end
of the temple. The shadowpeople will contact you there after you win the
battle. First, meet the shadowpeople's conclave, then, talk to their wise
one. They will show you the secret entrance to the Duerghast Temple. They
will also provide you with a map to the Dragonlance.
  On the way to the Dragonlance you will meet Skeletal knights. These undead
cannot be turned except by a level 8 cleric or higher. After you recover
the lance, go west to the exit. You will end up in the northeastern section
of the temple. Explore the rooms south of where you exited the tunnels. In
one of them you will find Skyla again. Check the room within that room after
the battle. South of where you are, you will find a fighter who has something
you need. That will send you to the southwest corner of the temple where you
will find an exit back to Sanction. Go back to Sanction, I.D. your items,
train, and get supplies. Use the bridges to go back to the temple.
  In the temple, go to the arena in the northwest corner. Kill the undead
that are there. Exit the arena and check out the rooms on both sides of the
arena entrance. You can take either set of stairs up. Sir Lebaum will be
waiting for you. You will get two wands from the battle, a wand of
paralyzation and a wand of lightening. Also after you defeat him, a
messenger will flee the scene. Follow him to the south. You will have
to fight some more dragons. After you defeat the dragons, the game will
force you onwards. You will meet Tasselhoff Buffhoof who will  lead you
in the final assault.
  The first step in the final battle is to capture the floating castle.
Once you land on the castle, there is a stairway to the right. Advance
up to the castle tower. Take the control tower, then rest. Move after
you have rested and the tower will crash. Exit the tower, rest, then move
west along the walls. You will eventually spot a stairway down. On the
first floor down, go south then west at the first cross corridor. On the
second floor down, go east to find the stairs. On the third floor down,
go south to find a dragon. Kill some guards and don their clothing. The
dragon will then fly you to safety.
  Once in Kernen, you can wander around safely. Proceed along the east side
and explore the alleys. You will locate some humans who are talking about
revolting. Pretend to join them and encourage them to revolt. Pick up the
cheap crown they offer. Next, locate the ogres and Gravnak. If you have
forged an alliance with him, they will help you attack the mansion. Explore
the southern side of town. Have some drinks with the draconians you will
find. If you handle them correctly, they will make some mischief that will
tie up some of the mansions forces. Give the cheap crown to the dragon.
There is a training hall on the south side if you need any final training.
  When you assault the mansion, you fist want to explore the eastern half
of the place. You should find something useful for getting past the
Guardian. To the north is a treasure room. Myrtani's room is to the west
but you will have to enter through the southwest rooms. The entrance is
in the Dragon Master's room. Save before you enter her room. After you
kill Myrtani, you have to stop the messengers dragons. Tas will show up
with some healing potion so you can begin the final battle fully healed.
After the final battle, you can continue playing the game to advance some
of your players levels for possible future adventures.

CHAOS STRIKES BACK
Find a dragon and cast MON ZO GOR SAR and hit ESC to pause the game. Hold
down the ALT key and type in LORD LIBRASULUS SMITHES THEE DOWN. Unpuse
the game and slay the beast. He leaves behind a firestaff and your party
will be invincible.

Undocumented Spells:
GOR IR KU   - Detects Monsters
GOR IR ROS  - Detects fake walls and "invisible" (actually hard to see) pits
GOR IR DAIN - Detects "magic" on screen?
ZO IR NETA  - Anchors the map at the point of casting so that as you move
              around, the map view stays at the anchored position.

(hint #1)
It's _REALLY_ easy to kill _ANY_ dragon.  Here's how.
1) Prepare all your players with MON IR VEN spells (mega poison cloud)
2) Use the green freeze life box (on the dragon)
3) Cast the spells, and then double up on each player
   (ie. each player casts 2 spells for a total of 8)
4) Wait... dinner will be served soon.

(hint #2)
Using the Vorpal Blade:
If you don't have both Vorpal Blades, you can increase #hits/time by
passing the weapon back and forth between the two attacking players.
(ie.  hit -> pass blade to #2 -> hit -> pass back to #1 -> hit ->...

(hint #3)
Contrary to what I've read on the net, everything is affected by
fireballs, including knights and dragons.  The only exceptions are
slime, black flames, and the thing that pops up from the floor.

CONQUEROR
Hints:

1) German tanks have a worse hill-climbing ability than both American and
   Russian tanks.  This point determines strategies for both the divisions,
   if you're playing as the Germans, a good tactic is to wait on top of 
   hills and rush down at the enemy when they approach, whereas if you take
   control of the allies, then it's a good idea to escape by heading up the
   steepest hill, so as to slow down any pursuers.

2) The program actually works out the angle of incidenc of any shot, and 
   uses the data to calculate the most effective use of armour.  Therefore
   an oblique shot on a tank will have more armour to penetrate than 
   "square on" blast.  So if you are under attack, try to make sure that
   the enemy have to fire angled shots, but if you are attacking, then
   try to get a good, straight (90 degrees) shot to do the most damage.

3) Front armour is always the thickest, giving the best defence on all tanks,
   so always try to face the enemy straight on so as to present the
   toughest, most heavily-armoured face towards them.  for this same reason
   you should also try to attack enemy tanks' flank or rear where they are
   less protected.

4) One of the most sensible tactics to use (the computer employs this) is
   to form the heavy tanks into groups and leave the light tanks to 
   reconnoitre.  This means that the lighter, faster tanks can act as your
   eyes, giving advance warning of enemy manoeuvres (they can also get
   away quickly!)  The tactic they use under teh auto-driver is to get away
   from anything they can't shoot, reporting the sightings to your force.
   You can then move the heavy boys in to tackle the situation.

5) When using map firing, always remember that any shells fired will take
   30 seconds to hit the ground, so try and judge where the enemy tanks
   will be when the missles strike and aim your guns there. Be warned,
   however, that computer-controlled tanks don't look for map fire, so
   keep clear of the area until all the shells have landed.

6) Don't go for a whole bunch of heavy guns; instead try to build a
   balanced tank-force. Light tanks are useful for reconnaissance and to
   act as an emergency reserve, whereas heavy tanks are good for straight
   head-to-head battles. Medium tanks combine the advantages of both light
   and heavy vehicles, but lack the speed and firepower of others.

7) Don't forget to use your drone tanks! Direct one to hold an enemy
   tank's attention while driving your tank to the rear from where you can
   unleash a powerful attack. Watch out when doing this, though, as the
   computer tank has only two objectives - to both defend itself and
   attack any player tanks. Thus it will turn its strongest armour towards
   the most powerful gun and take out the lightest enemy tanks.

The Tanks :

   Various tanks are useful for different things, and experienced players
   will be able to utilise the individual strengths of each. Here are
   some notes on the strengths of different tanks :

   CHAFFEE : Very fast and very cheap.

   M36 GMC : Also very fast and has a good gun, but has fairly weak
             armour.

   SHERMAN FIREFLY : Good gun, medium speed and adequate armour.

   PERSHING : Has the same gun as the M36 with medium speed, but has
              the advantage of good armour.

   PANZER III : Very cheap, but not particularly good at any one thing.

   PANTHER : Excellent front armour, a good gun and average mobility,
             but the side and rear armour are both weak.

   TIGER 1 : Excellent all-round armour and good gun.

   KING TIGER : Best armour and gun of any tank, but travels slowly.

   T34/76 : Good all-round armour (as with the other Russian tanks),
            good gun but has average speed.

   KV1S : Better armour than the T34/76, but has the same gun.

   KV85 : Has a better gun than the KV1S.

   JSII : Excellent armour and gun and has good mobility.

DEADLINE

here is the solution for solving infocom's mystery game, deadline. All
commands which should be typed in exactly as you see them are in quotes.
Directional movements are in brackets. E.G. "Open door" and [n,n,e].

From the front path of the robner's estate, go [n] to the front door of
the house.  Type "open door" and go [n] into the robners' house.  From
inside the door, go [n,e] and type "climb stairs" twice (or you can just
go [u,u]) to get to the second level of the estate.  From there, go
[w,w,w,w,n] to the library where you will start the first of a series of
sherlock holmes-type activities.

In deadline, you need to establish the motive and method for the murder
beyond all reasonable doubt before you can arrest the guilty party.  If you
don't have an air-tight case, the jury will acquit the defendant.  It is here
in the library where we go about establishing the method by which poor
mr. Robner was done in.

First off, type "examine rug" (or just "look rug"). You will find some mud
spots which is your first clue.  Now, "get the cup,pad,calendar and pencil"
and "rub pencil on pad" and then "turn page of calendar".  Aha!  Perhaps a
clue as to the motive?  Let's see if we can substantiate the method a
little more...That mud on the rug was very interesting.  Type "open balcony
door" and go [n] onto the balcony. Check out the railing by typing
"examine railing" and you will see some scratches, lending credence to
the theory that perhaps the murderer climbed up the balcony from the ground

below where he (or she) got mud on his shoes.  Let's have a look below and
check for some indication that the murderer was indeed below the
balcony.

Go [s,s,e,e,e,e,d,d,w,s].  Type "open door" and go [s] back to the front
door.  Now go [e,ne,e,se] to the shed where you will see a ladder.  Type
"examine ladder".  Hmmm!  This ladder-and-balcony theory is looking
good!  Let's see if we can prove the ladder was below the balcony.  This
will have to wait a while, though, because it's getting late in the
morning and we have to do some more checking in the house before the
reading of the will takes place.  And besides that, we need to talk to mr.
Mcnabb and he doesn't seem to be in the mood right now.

Go back to the house by heading [nw,w,s,w] and head back upstairs with
[n,n,e,u,u].  Let's see what else we can find upstairs.  Go [s,s] into
dunbar's bathroom.  Type "open cabinet" and "examine loblo".  Aha,
again!  Now we go back downstairs and see if we can find mr. Mcnabb to see
if he knows anything about a ladder under the balcony.  Go
[n,n,d,d,w,s,s].  Let's take a break for a while.  Type "wait until
11:30".

And now for mr. Mcnabb.  Let's try the orchard first with [e,ne,e].  If
mcnabb is not around, just wait for a while or snoop around the area and he
will soon show up.  Deadline is very unpredictable when it comes to the
various characters moving around the scenario.  Once you spot mcnabb, go to
him and say "hey mcnabb" followed by "what is wrong".  He will tell you
about some holes he found in his garden so, naturally, you say "show me
the holes".  He will take off and you "follow him".  When he stops, type
"examine holes".  Eureka!  The ladder was here and the depth of the holes
proves somebody climbed it up to the

balcony!

To make sure we cover every angle, "examine ground"(holes?) & "Dig around"
holes".  Hmmm...Wonder what this could be about?  To find out, type "analyze
fragment for loblo".  Oops, it's later than we thought!  Back to the house
for the reading of the will.  Go [n,n,se,s,s,w] to the front door and
[n,n,w] into the living room.  Now just "wait" for the will to be read.
Noticing that just about everybody is present, you decide to see if you can
roust some of those present into giving you some clues as to the guilty
party and, perhaps, the motive for the crime.

Let's start with george.  Type "show george the calendar".  He will get
very nervous and start heading out of the room.  Type "follow him" until he
finally goes to his room.  He will keep telling you to leave him alone,
but just keep following him until he gets to his room.  At this point, you
decide to see if george knows more then he's telling.  You aren't going
to get anything from him here, so let's go to the balcony and wait to
see if he does anything.  Go [n,w,n,n] to the balcony and type "wait 10
minutes".  Voila!  Here he comes! Wait until he goes behind the
bookshelf and then type "wait 4 minutes" to give him time to really
get his hands into the cookie jar.

When your 4 minutes are up, go [s], "examine bookshelf", "press button",
and go [e].  Ha!  Caught him red-handed!!  Type "get will", "look
safe", "get papers" and "read papers". Things are beginning to look up!
Let's see if we can substantiate some of this stuff.  Go back to the living
room with [w,s,e,e,e,e,d,d,w,w].  My, isn't this cozy!  Type "hey baxter",
"what about focus".  You know he's lying so you "show papers to baxter".
Ah, that's better!  Now for some clever psycho-detective work.  Type
"show lab report to dunbar" and "show

lab report to baxter".  Whip around and "accuse dunbar".  Hmmm...A tad
nervous, isn't she?  Perhaps we should go off and wait to see what develops.

Go [e] to leave the room and "wait for dunbar".  Just as we suspected!  When
she passes you, type "follow her". Once outside the house, she will drop
a ticket.  Type "get ticket" and "read ticket".  Wow!  This is getting good!
Type "show ticket to dunbar".  You know you've got her on the run now so
head off to the shed to wait and see what develops.  Go [e,e,se] and "wait
for baxter".  When they both show up, "show ticket to baxter" and "arrest
baxter and dunbar".  You didn't believe them for a minute, did you?

Due to the dynamic nature of deadline, there are several ways to end up
accusing baxter and dunbar of the murder.  There are also more puzzles
to solve, but this is all that is necessary to put together an air-tight
case against them.

After
the credits have finished loading, and are being displayed (the red light
will still be on, but no loading is occurring), press the following six (6)
keys, simultaneously:   <ESC> R / L N 7   Yes, all at the same time (use your
nose if ya have to - just press ESC and hold, then press R and hold, etc.).
The screen will flash if you did it right.  THEN PRESS THE FIRE BUTTON on your
joystick.  Sit back and watch all the animation.

Here's the complete Walkthrough:

Dsk1 Screen 1 (Opening Bridge-This will always be first!)

     Watch Dirk The Daring walk across bridge until he falls through.
     When the "Things" come toward you, hit the BUTTON and watch Dirk take a
     swipe at them.  Then, hit UP and you will raise yourself up to the
     bridge again, and run into the castle.

     Screen 2  (DrinkMe Sign-This will always be second!)

     When the "DrinkMe" sign flashes, hit RIGHT; Dirk The Daring will bravely
     kick the door open to the right of him and stomp out.

     -Screen 1 Repeats, laterally inverted!-

Dsk2 Screen 3  (The Falling StairWell-This may come after Screen 4....)

     You will either be walking left or right down the stairwell.  If you
     are moving left, when the stairs ahead of you flash, hit LEFT.  If
     you are going right, hit RIGHT.  You will jump over the hole in bridge
     and continue... Do not mind the bats, they are there for decoration!!

     Screen 4  (The Tentacles-This may come before Screen 3....)

     As soon as the tentacle drops from the ceiling, hit BUTTON!  Dirk will
     then slash it.  As soon as you slash it, hit UP.  You will go to the
     front of the room.  Then hit RIGHT or LEFT (depending on where the door
     is), and you will go to the door.  Then hit DOWN and you will goto the
     back and automatically start going up the stairs, at this point, hit
     LEFT or RIGHT (depending on where the little table is.)  As soon as you
     get on the table, hit UP and you will go out the door in a few seconds.
     WARNING: IF YOU HIT MORE THAN ONE MOVE YOU WILL DIE!  Just hit the move
     once and wait for it to take affect!!

     -Screen 3 and 4 will repeat again laterally inverted!-

Dsk3 Screen 5  (Ye WhirlPools/Ye Rapids-This may come after Screen 6...)

     You will start off with the Ye Whirlpools.  If the whirlpool is on the
     right, hit LEFT; if on the left, hit RIGHT.  You will easily use your
     manouvering abilities to steer carefully around them.  NOTE: Don't hit
     left or right more than once, or you will be sucked in!  Then come
     the Ye Rapids.  Now on my A2000, all you do is hit LEFT or RIGHT
     (depending on the direction of the light blue path), then when I get
     into the middle, I hit UP and go all the way down (Both Screens..)
     But I've heard other stories and this is what I've been able to piece
     together... If you have an A500 (hahahaha): Do what I do (above), but
     the second screen, hit UP one more time.  If you have an A1000, do
     what I do, then on the second screen, hit up twice. (Once on each of
     the two levels).  Experiment.. One of these techniques is sure to work
     but I can only confirm my way.

     Screen 6  (Slime Stew-This may come before Screen 5...)

     On this screen, you mainly watch... You will dodge the slime, then
     pick up a drink automatically.  Then, the Slime Goon will appear, hit
     BUTTON and you will slice him.  Just watch the rest of the board.

     - Screen 5 & 6 will appear again laterally inverted! -

Dsk4 Screen 7  (The Black Night-This may come after Screen 8...)

     First, make note of what side the Black Night's sword is on.  If it is
     on the left, you will have to hit RIGHT first.  You then jump right.
     Right after this, hit LEFT... Then UP... Then LEFT... Then RIGHT...
     Then Left... As jumping left now in mid-air hit RIGHT because you don't
     have anytime to spare once you land.  (Remember, better early than
     never!)  If it is reversed, just do the above backwards.  This is one
     of the "Most-Moves" boards so eventually you'll get the hang of it.

     Screen 8 (Marble Madness-This may come before Screen 7...)

     You will appear in the distance walking casually at the end of the
     half-pipe.  Then, a huge black ball will appear behind you wanting to
     make Autie-Em's World Famous Pancakes out of you.  The screen will
     change angles and you will see a coloured ball go by.  As soon as it
     goes by, hit DOWN.  Then, another coloured ball will go by; again, as
     soon as it passes, hit DOWN.  This is all you do, there will be a few
     more balls to get by, but if you can do one, the rest is really simple!
     WARNING: DON'T HIT DOWN MORE THAN ONCE PER BALL!  When you run by
     successfully, it looks really close... It is supposed too!

     - Screen 7 & 8 will repeat again laterally inverted! -

Dsk5 Screen 9  (The Bedroom Wall-This will come first!)

     Pretty simple.  Just keep hitting UP at a leisurely pace and you will
     get through, listen for when the game records your specific up moves
     and when you get better, you won't have to hit up rapidly... But I
     still do anyway because it guarantees me getting through.

     - This screen will repeat again laterally inverted! -

     Screen 10  (Dragon's Lair Part I-Computer Randomly Chooses Which
                 Lateral Screen You Will Do.)

     You will see a wobling bunch of "furniture".  Hit LEFT or RIGHT
     (depending on where it is...)  Then it will flash to the Dragon who
     starts to wake up and Princess Daphne (or something) says "Oh, save
     me!"  Then it will flash back to you - hit RIGHT or LEFT (the opposite
     direction of the furniture), then DOWN.  You will go onto another
     screen with more furniture.  This time, hit DOWN to catch it.  Then you
     will see the Princess moving around in the bubble saying, "Use the
     Magic Sword!".. As she is saying this, hit the BUTTON and then when
     she stops yapping, you will see the magic sword in a rock.

Dsk6 Screen 11  (Dragon's Lair Part II-Computer Randomly Chooses Which
                 Lateral Screen You Will Do.)

     You will be behind a tree... Hit down to duck Singe The Dragon's mighty
     claws.  * MAKE NOTE OF WHERE THE DRAGON'S HEAD WAS! *  After ducking,
     go in the direction Singe's head was.  Then, you will automatically
     rip the magic sword out of the rock...  Then, you get another screen
     showing you and the Dragon waving his tail.  Hit DOWN to dodge, and
     while you dodge it, on the way down, take note of the timing at which
     your sword glows.  Right after you dodge the tail for the first time,
     Singe will try again, just hit DOWN again.  Again, make note of the
     timing.  After you dodge it for the second time, Singe will try yet
     another time to get you... This time, hit DOWN (like usual), but this
     time when the sword glows (or a touch earlier), hit the button and you
     will whip the sword into the dragon.

                               Your Finished!!!

NOTE: NEVER, IF UNSURE, HIT EXTRA MOVEMENTS AS THEY USUALLY TURN INTO
      DEATHS!!!!!

DRAGON'S LAIR II - SINGES CASTLE

One can play easy mode and still access all the screens. Here's what to do:

Select the hardest possible setting before starting the game,
this includes not only hard mode but also disabling that obnoxious
'flip screen' feature and choosing only three lives. Then click on the
'game' icon and do as if you were to start the game. When the
prompt bar says 'Click to play' instead choose the 'exit' icon and this
will bring you back to the startup menu. Now you can select the easy mode
and more lives and you will still be able to see all the screens assuming
you're deft of hand enough to get to them in easy mode. Hope this helps!

repeat as often as you need.

Get all the experience points you want by going to Prince Haagkens castle.
Make your way past the bats, past the first fireplace with the trap to the
the second fireplace.  In front of the fireplace is a switch that activates
a door two or three rooms farther on in the castle when you step on it. This
door leads to a water fountain. Looking into the fountain transports you to a
room filled with water that has a never ending supply  of water monsters.
Take your  best weapon and armour with you.  Set your character on 'auto
kill' and if he or she is able to hang in there,  you can leave the character
in the room for several hours or  all night killing  off zillions of
monsters.  Do this for each of your characters and  youll easily be able to

^E
DUNGEON MASTER
To see someone interesting face the entrance and cast OH EW RA.  To advance
ninjas have them stand in a hall and throw weapons.  Retrieve and repeat.
Magic Users should cast spells in the air and fighters just slash at empty
space.

For a bit of nastiness, return to the entrance with the Firestaff, but leave
the power gem behind.

Halk isnt as bloody stupid as you think, give him magic objects and he will
gain enough  spell points to cast LO.  Have him keep casting this and his
magic powers will develope.

To advance ninjas a level, stand in a hall and throw your weapons.  Then get
them, and repeat.  This also works with magic and fighter levels.  Cast a
spell at the air, or slash and bash until you gain a level.

     Here are some undocumented spells:

       YA BRO ROS - Leaves a trail of footprints
           VI BRO - Shield poison
       DES IR SAR - Darkness
     FUL BRO NETA - Fire ball shield
       OH KATH RA - Lightning Bolt
               ZO - Open doors
           DES EW - Weakens non-corperal (undead) beings

Other Various Hints:

1. Armour

   Nearing the end of the quest, your Champions should be wearing the
   following gear :

   Helm Of Darc       Helm Of Lyte       Casque'n'Coif       Casque'n'Coif
   Shield Of Darc     Shield Of Lyte     Large Shield        Large Shield
   Plate Of Darc      Plate Of Lyte      Flamebain           Mithral Mail
   Greave Of Darc     Greave Of Lyte     Mithral Mail        Hosen
   Poleyn Of Darc     Poleyn Of Lyte     Hosen               Boots Of Speed
   Boots Of Speed     Boots Of Speed     Boots Of Speed

   Don't bother with the Flamebain if you've already killed the Dragon. The
   Champions wearing the plate armour should be carrying their respective
   shields (Darc or Lyte) and the other two should have the large shields.

2. Weapons

   One of the most important things to get to grip with in you quest through
   the catacombs is the use of weapons. If you're having troubles using them
   then have a butchers at the hints below, they might be just the thing to

   Master Key - Level 7 - Insert into either keyhole at the chamber which
                contains the Firestaff

5. The Creatures

   Agh! This game would be easy if it wasn't for those nasty monsters! So
   how do you deal with them? Read on :

   Mummies - Levels 2,3 and 8 - Not too bad to deal with, just be wary with
             low level characters. Combat with weapons and magic.

   Screamers - Levels 2,3 and 4 - Practice your Ninja skills on these as
               they are quite harmless. The flesh of a screamer can be
               eaten (yuk!!)

   Ogres - Levels 3,4 and 11 - Same as with the Mummies but be even more
           wary as they can kill quite quickly with those wooden clubs.

   Rock Monsters (Poisonous) - Levels 3 and 4 - Covered in debris found
                 around the dungeon, Rock Monsters can soak up a lot of
                 damage. A few fireballs will take care of them especially
                 if you let them attack you and get a quick Fireball to
                 the soft undersides. Prepare some anti-venom potions
                 beforehand.

   Purple Worms (Poisonous) - Weapons and magic are used against these
                monsters. Be careful of being trapped between to lots of
                worms as they are generated behind you as you progress
                through the level. The meat is tasty (but not nutritious),
                Purple Worms can be found on level 4.

   Ghosts - Magic (DES EW) and the Vorpal Blade are the only defences
            against ghosts. Closed doors won't protect you against them
            as they are non-material.

   Giant Wasps (Poisonous) - Levels 4,5,6 and 11 - Very fast and nasty. A
                poison cloud (OH VEN) soon kills them. Count the Wasps and
                use the next power symbol up (4 Wasps - use the fifth power
                symbol to start the spell).

   Slime Creatues (Poisonous) - Level 5 - Not all that fast and not too
                  dangerous either. A combination of weaponry and Fireballs
                  soon does them over.

   Flying Snakes (Posonous) - Level 6 - Nearly as bad as the Giant Wasp.
                 Prepare some anti-ven potions and loads of VI potions. The
                 one that is released from the small room is particulatly
                 powerful.. and it also has you trapped!!

   Skeletons - Levels 6,8 and 10 - Armed with Falchions and Wooden Shields,
               a group of these will sometimes give you a lot of hassle.
               Straight combat usually deals with them.

   Beholder - Levels 6 and 10 - The Beholder mainly uses magic to attack
              you. It can cast a ZO spell so it's no use hiding behind
              doors. Their favourite weapon is a lightening bolt so just
              return the complement with an OH KATH RA spell or two (or
              five!)

   Pixies - Levels 8,10 and 11 - These little fellows aren't that dangerous
            (they are more of a nuisance!). They steal items from the
            champion's "ready" hand. A quick blow to the skull or a low
            level Fireball takes care of them.

   Giant Rats - Level 9 - Use high level Fireballs on these. When killed
                they leave behind nutritious drumsticks (!?!?)

   Mini Dinosaur - Level 9 - A rare inhabitant of the dungeon, the Mini
                   Dinosaur can take its fair share of punishment. They
                   are cumbersome creature and are quite easy to deal with.

   Little Mage - Level 9 - These guys have an annoying habit of disappearing
                 when attacked. They are quite skilled in magic but not
                 very hardy chaps and don't take much to kill. They are
                 always in possession of useful items which are dropped
                 when they die.

   Giant Scorpions - Level 10 - These can take a heck of beating and give
                     one out as well! Fireballs, combat and an escape route
                     are the order of the day here.

   Water Elemental - Level 11 - Very slow moving, the Water Elemental is at
                     its most vulnerable when it rises from the floor to
                     attack. As they are non-material, use the same weapons
                     and magic used to combat ghosts.

   Etheral Triffid - Level 12 - The Triffid can fade from existence as well
                     as being a solid creature. Use DES EW and the Vorpal
                     Blade in the ghostly form, combat and Fireballs when
                     they are solid.

   Giant Spider - Level 12 - A few high level Fireballs and a bit of combat
                  is usually enough to sort these dudes out. The Morning
                  Star is reputedly the best weapon to use against them.

   Chaos Knight - This guy has a couple of swords and is covered in plate
                  armour. Find yourself a door to hide behind because you
                  are going to need plenty of sleep to rebuild your health,
                  stamina and mana. Plenty of Fireballs and lots of combat
                  will eventually defeat him. Don't bother with the armour
                  or swords 'cos they are cursed. Chaos Knights can be
                  found on Level 12.

   Fire Elemental - Level 13 - The Fire Elemental is non-material and can
                    be dealt with in the usual manner. The only problem
                    is most of them can relight themselves!

   Fire Demon - Level 13 - These creatures attack with Fireballs and also
                use their whip-like tendrils for close quarters fighting.
                Give as good as you get to kill these basts..

   Dragon - Level 14 - Now this guy is one big mutha and is going to take
            a while to kill. Take a good rest and make sure all your
            champions can recite the most powerful Fireball spell before
            going into combat. Use the pillars in the middle of the floor
            for protection and as soon as you run out of mana, have a
            quick go with weapons (always good for morale!) and run back
            upstairs. Repeat this procedure until the Dragon is defeated,
            then feast on ready roast Dragon steaks!

   Stone Golem - Level 7 - Very tough but also very slow, the Golem can
                 absorb a lot of Fireballs and combat before defeat.
                 Luckily, there are only a few in the dungeon.

   Dark Lord - This gentleman is waiting at the entrance of the dungeon
               (on level one) to take possession of the Firestaff.

   Lord Chaos - The only way to defeat Chaos is to trap him in a fluxcage
                and fuse him. This can only be carried out with the Fire
                Staff and the Powergem combined. Go to the small room in
                the corner, shut the doors and sooner or later he will come
                to you.

   General tips for creatures : Any living (i.e not non-material) creature
   can be persuaded to move with a good dose of poison cloud. If you are
   trapped in a dead end, just cast a few poison clouds out at your foe
   until the creature moves out of the way.
   Stand in front of a door and wait for the creature to move under it.
   When it does, press the button and the door will repeatedly hit it on
   the head. Stay where you are until the creature is dead or moves back,
   allowing the door to shut.

6. Magic

   Here's how to understand and create the spells to allow you to get the
   most from magic :

   YA                      FUL IR                 OH KATH RA
   stamina potion          fireball               lightning bolts

   VI                      DES VEN                OH EW SAR

   VI BRO                  YA BRO NETA            FUL BRO NETA
   anti-venom              vitality potion        fire shield

   OH VEN                  OH EW RA               ZO BRO RA
   poison cloud            magical vision         mana potion

                      ZO KATH RA
                      plasma to release Powergem

   Other magic tips :

   Keep practising at every available opportunity.

   For users without any MANA, find an item which will start you off with
   a few points.

   Always keep a spell in reserve and when your MANA bar reaches full
   capacity, cast the spell and immediately recite another spell but don't
   cast it.

   You don't have to find a spell scroll to actually know a spell, so high
   level spells are available to novices.

   Even if a spell is unsuccessful, the experience is gained still counts
   towards you next skill level.

   Rather than cast a meaningless spell, recant the incorrect symbol(s)
   and recite the correct one(s). Meaningless spells don't count towards
   experience.

PART 2:  Complete Solve


-Souvenir Shop-

Proceed to the Souvenir Shop.  Collect some hay from outside the stable on the
way.  At the Souvenir Shop, take the large (not the small) shield and USE it.
Once activated, the shield will remain in use until it is dropped or replaced
with a larger shield.

-Armoury-

Enter the castle and go to the Armoury.  Obtain a weapon (a sword is best).
Also take the crossbow.

-Library-

Go to the Library.  Take the magic book.

-Kitchen-

Go to the Kitchen.  Take the honey from the pantry.  Mix honey and hay to make
the Herbal Honey Spell.  USE spell.  (It allows you to recognize all herbs
in the Garden.)

-Upstairs Bedroom-

Go upstairs and search the bedrooms for crossbow bolts.  Don't go into the
Vampire's room yet.

-Garden Shed-

Go to the Garden Shed and collect the key, hammer, and silver cross.  Also,
collect the magic ingredients (poppy, maggots, etc.) both there and along
the way.

-Herb Garden-

Leave the Garden Shed and go to the Herb Garden, collecting ingredients along
the way.  En route to the Herb Garden, take the opportunity to improve your
bow skills by using the Archery Target until the "message of improvement" is
received.  You will have to fight to enter the Garden.  Open the Garden gate
with the key you found in the Garden Shed.

-Living Room-

Return to the castle and enter the Living Room to get the stake -- and of
course, more ingredients (fern, etc.).

-Meadow (Outside Herb Garden)-

Go to the meadow and kill the falcon with the crossbow.  Take the FIRST key
and the feather from the falcon.  Don't forget to retrieve your crossbow bolt.

-Maze-

Enter the maze and obtain the bird's egg.  Make your way towards the center
of the maze.  DO NOT ENTER INTO HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WITH THE MAZE CREATURES.
Use either the crossbow or magic spells to fight them; otherwise, avoid them
altogether.  Find the lily pond in the center of the maze, and take all
available items.

Now find the nest, which is nearby.  Maze creatures are sneaky notorious
thieves.  Take back any items that may have been stolen from you en route --
they will be in the nest.  Make sure you take Elvira's "lost ring" from the
nest also.  If there are "eyes" in the nest when you arrive, cast a spell on
the nest to destroy any remaining creatures.

-Battlements-

Go up to the battlements and fight until you meet the Grey Knight (an archer),
who has another key.  Fire a crossbow bolt at him.  He will fall over the
battlements into the moat below.  (Note this location.  You'll need to find
him later in the moat.)

(If necessary: Return to the castle to replenish your magic spells and/or to
make up new ones.)

-Dungeon-

Enter the dungeon.  Search for magic ingredients (earwigs, caterpillars, etc.)
in the jail cells.  Enter the torture chamber and lift the ring on the floor.
Touch NOTHING ELSE!  Take the bones and the SECOND key.

-Upstairs (Vampire's Room)-

Go upstairs and enter the Vampire's room.  USE the stake to kill the Vampire
and then collect her dust and the crossbow bolts.

-Upstairs (Blue Bedroom)-

Go into the Blue Bedroom.  Search the drawers to find a bible.  In the bible
is a prayer scroll.  (Note about Upstairs:  You'll find more crossbow bolts
in some of the other rooms.)

-Chapel-

Make your way back downstairs to the Chapel.  Insert Elvira's ring into the
cross.  Take the prayer book with the Manticore Hide inside.

-Underground Chamber-

Enter the Chamber under the altar in the Chapel.  Face the Crusader Wall and
USE the prayer scroll.  Put the crown on the Crusader's head and take the
holy sword.  USE the holy sword.

-Kitchen (2nd time)-

Return to the kitchen and MIX as many spells as possible.  If the cook is
there, she must be killed.  You need to use the salt found in the torture
chamber.  When the cook is dead, Elvira will take her place in the kitchen.
At this point, turn to face the dumbwaiter.  Give Elvira a Glowing Pride
spell,
then wait for her to get the THIRD key for you.

-Catacombs-

Enter the catacombs and explore the various burial chambers.  Find the coffin
containing the iron key, and take the key.  In another chamber, find the
empty coffin and put bones in it.

Note: The other coffin in this same room is the entrance to the moat -- but
DO NOT OPEN THIS COFFIN until you have the iron key.

-Torture Chamber-

Return to the torture chamber and take the tongs.

-Well Room-

Go to the well room.  Check to make sure the wellrope is in the "down"
position.

-Catacombs (2nd time)-

Make way back to the catacombs.  If you meet the monster with the stone,
slay him and take the stone.  Enter the burial chamber where you left the
bones.

Now you can open the other coffin.  The room will flood.  Swim DOWN and then
swim until you find a place to swim UP (i.e. the up arrow is highlighted).
This is the bottom of the well.  Swim up for air, or you will drown.

Swim DOWN again, then to the grill at the other end of the tunnel.  Unlock
the grill.  Enter the moat, and find the slain grey knight and obtain the
FOURTH key.  Return to the bottom of the well and go UP.  Take the moss from
the well.

-Foundry-

Go to the foundry.  Find the crucible in the wooden box and take it.  Place
the silver cross in the crucible, then place the crucible in the fire to melt
the cross.  Dip a crossbow bolt in the molten silver.

-Kitchen (3rd time)-

Go back to the kitchen and USE the tongs to take hot coal from the fire.
Make your way immediately to the third tower.

-Third Tower-

Light the cannon wick with the hot coal.  It will fire, blasting the fourth
tower to smithereens.

-Stable-

Go to the stable.  Kill the werewolf with the silver crossbow bolt and obtain
the FIFTH key from behind the stone in the last stall (the stone with the
ring).

There is now only one key left to obtain.  This you must take from the captain
of the guards.

-Armoury (2nd time)-

Go to the armoury and get armor.  (CONSUME strength potions before you put it
on, or you may be left immobile.)  Drop unnecessary items.  CONSUME dexterity
potions.  Enter the captain's room and attack the captain with magic to reduce
his effectiveness.  Use any magic that increases your hit points -- Palmlight,
Fingerlight, Demon's Brew, anything to weaken him.  Then defeat him in
hand-to-hand combat.  Take the bulletin off the captain's bulletin board, then
take the SIXTH key.

-Destroyed Tower (4th tower)-


YOU SHOULD NOW HAVE ALL THE KEYS.


Go to the destroyed tower... the one you blew away with the cannon.  You will
find a chest.  Open the chest using the keys in the correct order.  (The order
can be determined by examining each key.)  Int he chest you'll find a dagger
and a scroll.  Take them... but do not use them yet.

-Catacombs (3rd time)-

Go back to the catacombs (again) and find the stone impression on the floor
(located at the "Y" juncture in the passageway) where you can insert the stone
key obtained from the monster.  This will open a secret passageway -- but be
sure you've taken all the available health potions first!  (You want to boost
your LIF quotient; a good potion for this is wooden heart.)  If you meet
Emelda's handmaidens, they can only be destroyed by magic.

At the end of the corrider, Emelda will confront you.  If you do nothing, she
will drain your life force.  To kill her, place the crusader's sword in the
pentangle, then USE the scroll you found in the chest.  Finally, stab Emelda
with the dagger.

THE GAME IS NOW WON, AND ELVIRA WILL REWARD YOU WITH A DISPLAY OF GRATITUDE!

ENCHANTER
 You, a young enchanter, stand at the point of decision.  You have been sent
by the Enchanter's Guild to destroy Krill, the Evil One! Thus begins the story
of ENCHANTER, the first in a trilogy from Infocom.

 Go southeast twice, then northeast to the Deserted Village.  Standing before
you is a disheveld hut.  Go south into the hut.  You can't see much except for
a pile of rags that seems to be alive!  It hands you a scroll and somehow
pushes you back outside the hut!  Read the scroll then GNUSTO the spell into
your spellbook.  Go southwest, northwest twice then northeast.  You find
yourself in front of a shack.  Go north into the shack and get the Jug and the
Lamp.  Open the oven and get the Loaf of Bread.  Now to find you a source of
water to drink.

 Leave the shack and go northeast, southeast, and northeast again to the Shady
Brook.  Fill your jug with water here.  When you get messages about being
thirsty or hungry, eat the bread or drink the water.  Your bread supply is
limited to the one loaf, but your water supply is endless!

 Go southwest, southeast and east twice.  You are standing outside the western
entrance to the Castle!  The place gives you the creeps, but you must enter!
Learn your REZROV spell, then REZROV the gates.  As they swing open a blast of
cold air assails you.  Go east inside the gate then FROTZ your lamp.  You can
FROTZ anything, including yourself!  So if you find yourself carrying too many
items, you can always drop the lamp and FROTZ something else as a light
source.

 Go north twice to the Northwest Tower and go up the stairs. Inside you find a
beautiful Egg!  Take the egg and go back downstairs and south four times to
the
Southwest Tower.  Go east and and downstairs to the Dungeon. Open the cell
door
and go north into the cell. If you examine the walls, you'll see a loose
block.
 Removing the block reveals a dark passage!  Go east into the passage. You see
a Stained Scroll! Read the scroll then GNUSTO the spell into your spellbook.
Leave the spoon...it's just window dressing.

 Go west, south and up the stairs to the South Hall. Drop your lamp (or other
light source) and go east into the Gallery.  If you'd been carrying your lamp,
you wouldn't have seen this spectacle!  One of the paintings is glowing! Move
the painting aside and you see a black candle burning and a Black Scroll! Take
the scroll only (you don't need the candle) then go west and collect your
lamp.
Read the scroll then GNUSTO it into your spellbook.

 Now for the scariest part of your adventure!  Go north into the closet.  If
you're hungry or thirsty, take care of those problems now. Learn OZMOO then
OZMOO yourself and drop everything (yes, everything!) you're carrying. Go
north
and east two times.  You find yourself at the center of an ancient Temple!  It
is obvious that its use was for sacrifices! Suddenly behind you, you hear a
low noise and hundreds of creatures capture you and throw you into a cell!
Alas, you've been captured!  But fear not!  Wait once.  Eventually, you are
carried from your cell and thrown on the Altar!  You see a jewelled knife
being plunged into your chest!  But, remarkably, you feel no pain and pull it
out!  Luckily, the creatures take no notice of your seeming immortality and
you are able to escape unheeded!  Go down, west twice and south back into the
Closet.

 All your possessions are right where you left them!  Cut the ropes on the
jewelled box with the dagger.  As the rope is cut, it seems to be alive and
squirms away from the box, lands on the floor, then disappears!  Upon opening
the box, you find a Vellum Scroll!  Get everything you can carry, read the
scroll then GNUSTO the spell into your spellbook. If you can't carry the box
or the knife, leave them here.  But be sure you have your spellbook, the lamp,
the egg, the jug of water and the loaf of bread.

 Right about now you may start getting "You're tired" messages.  It's time to
find someplace to go to sleep!  Go south, west and up the stairs.  You find
yourself in a round bedroom with a huge, soft four-poster bed!  Go to bed and
soon you are asleep!  During the night, you have a strange dream about a
damsel carrying a scroll and hiding it in the post of the bed!  When you
awaken, get up and examine the bedpost. Amazingly, you see a button underneath
the outline of a small compartment!  Push the button and the compartment opens
revealing a Gold Leaf Scroll!  Read the scroll then GNUSTO the spell into
your spellbook.

 Go downstairs and east three times, eating and/or drinking as necessary.  At
the South Gate, go south then southeast to the Beach. Lumbering along the sand
is an enormous turtle!  Learn NITFOL then NITFOL the turtle.  The turtle lifts
its head and says "Hello" to you! No time to chitchat now, though!  Tell the
turtle to follow you then go northwest, north and east to the Southeast Tower.
Go upstairs. The noise in the Engine Room is horrible!  Screeching, pounding,
grinding noises issue from an Infernal Machine in the room.  You can see
something that might be a scroll laying across the room, but trying to get it
yourself would be fatal!  If the turtle isn't with you, wait until he arrives.
Learn EXEX then EXEX the turtle.  He shimmers and trembles for a moment but
doesn't seem to notice.

 It is important that you give the turtle a multiple command now since he may
not be able to hear you when he gets across the room.  Tell the turtle to go
southeast, get the scroll, and to go northwest.  The turtle's rapid movements
seems to have made the machine speedup!  But he's so speedy he dodges the
pounding hammer easily!  He races across and picks up the scroll, then turns
around and heads back!  His return sets off a trap, though, and spears fly at
him from all directions!  Luckily, his shell protects him and he races back to
you, drops the scroll at your feet and says "Not bad, huh?"  Thank him, get
the scroll and go back downstairs.  This is one of the "Powerful" scrolls.
You can read it, but because of its complexity, you cannot GNUSTO it into your
spellbook.  You must carry it with you the rest of the game.

 Go west four times, north four times and east to the Hall of Mirrors One.
We're going to pass through the Halls of Mirrors the first time no matter what
happens!  Just ignore the Adventurer if you see him.  We'll deal with him
later!
 Go east four times to the North Gate.  Learn REZROV then REZROV the gate. Go
north into the forest.  There, laying beneath a tree, is a Crumpled Scroll!
Get the scroll (you won't need to GNUSTO it since we'll only be using it
once).

Learn REZROV again then REZROV the egg. The egg opens but unfortunately, as it
is opened, a series of shredders, knives and other cutting implements have
shredded its contents...another Scroll!

 Ah, not to worry!  The scroll you've just found will fix it!  Read the scroll
then KREBF the Shredded Scroll.  As you cast the spell, the Crumpled Scroll
disappears, but the Shredded Scroll is now whole! Read the scroll then GNUSTO
the spell into your spellbook.  Keep the egg, though, you'll need it later on.

 Go east into the Swamp.  Lounging around on lily pads is a group of frogs,
croaking about who knows what!  Learn NITFOL then NITFOL the frog.  It pauses
briefly in its conversation and says "Hello". Suddenly you hear the frogs say
"Look under the lily pads"! Amazing! When you do so, you see a Damp Scroll!
Get the scroll, read it, then GNUSTO the spell into your spellbook.

 Learn both ZIFMIA and VAXUM and go west, south and west into the Hall of
Mirrors Four. Eat and drink as necessary.  Keep going east and west until you
see the Adventurer wandering around.  When you see him, ZIFMIA the poor guy.
He suddenly appears before your eyes looking a bit bewildered and a whole lot
afraid!  Quickly VAXUM the adventurer and he calms greatly!  He eyes your
possessions intently.  Wonder what he wants?  Must be that Jewelled Egg! Let's
make him earn his reward though!

 Go west until you reach the North Gate.  The Adventurer should be following
you.  Don't give him anything yet or he won't follow you!  Go east to the
Guarded Door.  What a horrible sight!  All those tentacles, the sign, the
gargoyles!  Who'd make such an awful thing! Don't panic, though, calmly (if
you can!) tell the adventurer to open the door.  He looks at you nonchalantly
and calmly ignorning all the horrible things happening to him, opens the door
and enters!
  Go north into the Map Room and look at the Adventurer.  He may have picked
up
the items he found in the Map Room before you arrived.  But, if you give the
adventurer any "treasure" items you're holding and then get the pencil and the
map, he should give them to you.  Leave the Purple Scroll.  It's not necessary
for completing your quest. Check your inventory at this time too. You should
be holding the pencil, the map, the Brittle Scroll, a lamp (or other light
source), the loaf of bread, jug of water and your spell book.

 If you're getting tired, you can sleep anywhere, but you'll have weird
dreams!

 Go south, west six times, south four times, east and down twice to the
Translucent Room.  What an odd room!  The walls are creamy and thin.  The exit
to the south is perfectly round and pitch black!  This is perhaps the toughest
puzzle in the game. What you're actually looking at is a black pencil mark! If
you read your pencil, you'll see it's magic!  Now read the map.  The map
consists of a series of lines connected to letters.  You're standing at point
"B" right now. Your pencil only has two draws and two erases left to it.  So
follow closely and don't get lost!  We're off to trap a Demon!

 Go south through the hole, east, northeast and southeast. Now draw a line
from Point "F" to Point "P".  Suddenly a black hole appears on the southwest
wall! You feel something incredibly evil lurking close to you.  But don't
despair!  Go southwest twice and erase the line from Point "R" to Point "B"
and also erase the line from Point "M" to Point "V".  With that out of the
way, look around the room.  You see a Scroll emanating great power here!
Right now, though, your load is too heavy to pick it up.  Drop your lamp then
learn FROTZ and FROTZ the jug.  If you've been drinking your water all along,
the jug should be about empty.  After we're through here, we'll go fill it
up again.

 Get the Powerful Scroll.  You cannot GNUSTO it into your spellbook, though,
because of its strength.  You'll have to carry it with you until you need to
use it.  Go northeast, northwest twice and draw a line from Point "J" to Point
"B" and go west through the new opening you've made.  As you do so, you hear
an anguished cry as the Demon you've trapped with your line drawing and
erasing realizes its plight!

 Go up twice to the South Hall, then go west, north twice, and west twice to
the Western Road.  We're going to refill the jug now.  Go west, northwest, and
northeast to the Shady Brook.  Fill the jug and go southwest, southeast, and
east three times back inside the gate.  Time to wrap up your quest with a
visit to the library!

 Go north twice to the Northeast Tower, and east five times to the North Gate.
Learn MELBOR then MELBOR yourself.  Go south into the Library.  As you enter
the library you hear voices to the south.  If you're thirsty or hungry, drink
or eat as needed.  If you run out of bread at this point, don't worry.  You're
almost through!

 Look at the floor and you see rat tracks!  Follow the tracks to the hole and
reach inside the hole.  You've found and taken a Frayed Scroll!   Right about
now, the voices you heard burst into the room! Since you've MELBOR'ed
yourself,
though, they don't take much notice and soon leave.  Go north to the North
Gate, learn MELBOR and MELBOR yourself once more (just to be on the safe
side),
then read the Frayed Scroll and GNUSTO the spell into your spellbook. Time to
vanquish Krill!

 Go south twice to the Junction.  Drop everything except the spellbook, the
Brittle Scroll and the Powerful Scroll.  If you're sleepy, sleep here.  When
you wake up, eat (if you have any bread left) and drink from the jug.  Drop
these items but retain your spellbook and the two scrolls.

 Learn the following spells:  GONDAR, CLEESH, and FROTZ.  Now go east onto the
landing then east again.  It's pitch black in here!  FROTZ yourself...reaching
up and down as far as you can see is an Endless Stairway!  If you read the
KULCAD spell, you'll see that it removes the illusions caused by great magic!
This is obviously some trick played by Krill to keep himself safe!  KULCAD the
stairs.  As the Brittle Scroll disappears, the stairway you're standing on
begins to dissolve, leaving you standing on thin air!  Blast!  You find
yourself falling toward a pit that is several hundred feet away!

 As you freefall towards your certain doom, you try to grasp the last fading
bannister!  This, too, soon disappears and is replaced by an Ornate Scroll!
Quickly read the Ornate Scroll.  Thank goodness it's a scroll that causes you
to fly!  IZYUK yourself!  Whew!  At least you're not falling any more!  You
flap your "wings" and gently rise back up to the place where the landing used
to be. Go east through the door.

 As you "float" through the door, you come face to face with Krill! As he
practices his illusions and other powerful spells, he takes notice of you and
in a deep, powerful voice scoffs at you and calls you unpleasant names.  As a
final show of his contempt for you, he snaps his fingers and a huge fire
breathing dragon appears before you!

 Quickly GONDAR the dragon!  From nowhere a torrent of water quenches the fire
from the dragon and it disappears with a scream!  Krill appears amused at your
spell and snaps his fingers once more.  This time, a battle-axe bearing
monster
appears and advances toward you! CLEESH the shape and it turns into a somewhat
amusing newt!  The battle-axe, unsupported, falls to the floor, neatly slicing
the newt in half!

 Krill has finally lost all his patience and begins to chant a spell, the
likes of which shake the very tower you're standing in!  Without a moment to
spare, GUNCHO Krill!  As the first words of the GUNCHO spell reach his ears,
he falls back and tries to continue with his spell. However, the GUNCHO spell
is far too powerful for him and eventually, he screams, speaks a spell of
power, and disappears!  As Krill's evil magic loosens its hold on the Castle,
the surrounding towers (including the one you're standing in!) begin to
dissolve and disappear!  You feel yourself falling...falling....

 Suddenly you see a burst of light and find yourself back within the Circle of
Enchanters!  Belboz rises and speaks about how Krill's evil has been ended by
you, a novice, and allows you entrance to the Circle of Enchanters!
Congratulations!

ENLIGHTENMENT - DRUID II
To find secret levels at the start  of the game immediately go left to the
desert,  then continue left  to the fire zone.  Head to  the upper most left
corner of this area and  you should see lava with a patch on it that looks

ESCAPE FROM THE PLANET OF THE ROBOT MONSTERS
If the giant Reptillion is causing a bit of a problem, then try this:

Choose a one-player game (the cheat won't work with two players) and play as
normal until you get to the Reptillion. Run past the robot and go to the
doors, then stand directly infront of the centre line splitting the doors.
Once you are there, press the bomb key and waggle your joystick left and
right. Keep dropping bombs and pushing against the door in this fashion and
you'll eventually squeeze through the thin gap. This works for all the
Reptillion stages.

Select option "2 Free Flight, no enemy confrontation" from the main menu.
Then select zero instead of 1 to 4.  The screen will go into a spiral and
scroll way south to 34 by 117 degrees, placing your plane somewhere without a
runway.  This happens to be in the middle of Edwards Air Force Base, where
the F/A-18 was flight tested.  hmmmm...  To take off you have to use the
afterburners.  117 degrees is the furthest south you'll be able to fly, but
you can go in other directions.  (Is there more to this back door?  hmm)
^E
FAERY TALE ADVENTURE
In the  dungeons and cave you  can go through  opening doors,  restore your
position and you  will still have all your keys.  Repeat as often as you
need.

If you don't want to go thru the hassle of collecting
all those statuettes:

 Go the the dark evil castle
 Stand right up against the force field
 Let yourself starve so that you faint
 When you wake up, you'll be on the other side

Find the green turtle, jump on his back and start attacking.  Nothing will
happen except your bravery points will keep piling up.

On the  Crystal Castle Island press right mouse button while speaking with
the Sorceress and luck increases to 65.  ASK the Sorceress seveal times.

Sometimes you can accumulate all the treasure you want by going near the
item, pressing space bar, and then continue hitting 'T'.  You'll receive an
infinite supply of that treasure.

A secret entrance to the fort exists. On the left side, near even with the
door.

up/left, press fire, then press E.  You now enter the game editor.  Pressing
ESC returns you to the level selector mode (pressing SPACE from the level
selection mode returns you to the game).  While in the game editor, press
these keys:  P - alter the game's palette (use 1,2,3,4,5 and 6 from keypad),
X - modify the exits (use - and + on keypad to select exit number, then press
S, then use + and - again to set the exit level.  Use cursor to set
position), W - weapons distribution, works like the exits distribution mode.

-----------

Start the game as normal, collect the ship and fly to the extreme top
left of the playing area. Disembark from the ship and drive the buggy
into the corner. Type in STONKER and re-enter the ship. Now pressing D
cycles through the available  weapons (including shield plus weapons), and
pressing C cycles through the levels.  NOTE: when entering a level, it's
always best to station the ship at the top left of the screen again, to
avoid  appearing at an illegal position, or even off-screen. On the
second level repeat the above process, getting the buggy back in the top
left hand corner, and retype STONKER again. It now enables the ship to fly
through walls, and pressing F while hovering over switches allows them to
be collected while in the air.

home country.  The land will be safe, but if another leader captures a nearby
land, make sure you put something back in or he will attack on his next turn.

Do not move all your forces into your command unit, or an the enemy commander
will wait till he is  down to his last few men and challenge you to a one on

appear. Start the game and you have more lives.
^E
GLOBULOUS
The most important  thing to remember is that  ALL  the puzzles can be solved
without losing a  life, so if you lose a life and think its the only way to
solve the screen, look closely.  Some of the  puzzles get pretty obscure
after level 10, but once you eventually beat them you'll kick yourself for
not seeing the solution earlier.

Look before  you leap.  Think  about how  the screen  will look from a
flipped
perspective.  A lot of jumps you make  will be unnecessary and waste
time and switches if you dont.

Make sure  you have  enough  switches,  at least 10 per screen.  It is
possible to get stuck on a  downward slope  with no way to get back up or
kill yourself,  and the only way out is to  press ESC and start the whole
game over.

     Here are a few codes you might like to try:

     Level 06 - IVEs8AZ?
     Level 11 - dynle1cJ

HARDBALL
Various hints:
* Allstars are better than champs,
* Only steal if you actually hit the ball,
* Try to get a lot of runs early, as the computer team improves towards the
end,
* Bunting rarely works,
* Halfway through the match, swap Laws for Wells and Wratten for Harris,
* The best pitchers are Oliver, Perez, Leary, Cook.  The others will only be
successful for a short while,
* Never pitch fastballs to the center as they will usually result in home
runs,
* Change pitchers after a few innings, because as they get tired, their
accuracy and speed get worse.

HARD DRIVIN
Attain full speed then hit N.  You continue at full speed with easy steering
and invincibility and unlimited time.

Another trick is to repeatedly hit the 4 key (4th gear) until the program has
an error.  Continue with the right mouse button.  Repeat until you get a high
score.

To qualify for the head-to-head race against the Phantom Photon,
follow these instructions :

  At the start, turn the car around 180 degrees. The display should now show
  the WRONG DIRECTION message. Head off under the bridge until you get to a
  split in the road. Take the right hand branch and keep going until you reach
  a checkpoint. Go through and turn the car through 180 degrees until your
  heading the other way. Go back through the checkpoint in the right direction
  and you should hear a ping. Keep going to the finish and once under the
  bridge let the clock run down to zero. You should now get a message saying
  that you've qualified for the race!!

HERO'S QUEST
Save your game frequently. Don't just overwrite an existing save, either:
give each save a different name to keep your options open. (Incidentally,
this piece of advice is also true of any game with a save option).
In the early part of the game it pays to practice to improve any of your
abilities such as climbing (climb rocks, trees, walls.. anything to get
your points higher). Practice throwing rocks at anything, but if you have
bought some daggers from the shop use the target south of the town for
practice so that you can get them back!
To improve your fighting skills, Goblins can always be found in their
camp and are not too difficult to kill. Each time you enter their camp
you will be attacked by one more Goblin than on the previous visit.
Goblin-killing can also be quite profitable, because searching a body
usually results in finding some silver.
Staying alive is helped considerably if you can afford to buy Healing
Potions and Vigor Potions from the Healer. You can buy them from Zara in
the town, but they are more expensive.

Money Making :

Fairly easy ways of getting money early in the adventure include collecting
Magic Mushrooms from the Fairy Ring and collecting flowers from Erana's
Peace to sell to the Healer. She will buy three lots of each of these, so
PICK three times to save on journeys.
You can earn five silvers for cleaning out the stables in the Castle...
but be careful not to start too late in the afternoon. If it is sunset
before you get back into town you could be in trouble.

Sleep Safe:

In town there's no problem if you can afford to pay the Inn-keeper for a
bed, but outside town there are only three safe places to get your
essential kip. Erana's Peace is safe and you also get all your Health,
Vigor, Magic points etc renewed, By the Dryad's tree is safe, if you can
get to it. Finally the hermit'Enry will put you up for a price of 1 Food,
though unless you can climb you won't be able to get up to his cave.

Thief's Guild :

Contrary to what Bruno by the town gate may tell you, find the Thief's
Guild by going up the Goon in the Tavern and saying "Schweinhund". In the
Guild you can 'fence' any property you have stolen after picking the locks
to the Sheriff's and the Old Lady's houses.
^E
HEROS OF THE LANCE
Some general tips:
Arrange your party so that the first line consists of two strong
warriors,
Raistlin and Goldmoon.  This allows you to use Raistlin's magic  and  the
healing staff of Goldmoon without too much hassle. Save Tanis  and  Riverwind

for the later levels, where the bows come in handy. When fighting Gully
Dwarves, use Tasslehoff who is the same height as them. His sling stones will
never miss. Avoid  fighting  Hatchlings, they're not worth it. Just turn and
run when  you meet one; when you reach an intersection move into a new path
and wait a little. When you return, the Hatchling will have gone. Killing
Bozaks: two methods: 1) get Raistlin to use a web, sleep or charm  spell to
stun it, then send a warrior to clobber it to death, or 2) select  Flint, who
is a dwarf; 9 out of 10 times, the Bozak's shots will  go  over  his  head;
get close to enter melee combat, and use low thrusts to kill it. Spectral
Minions: they're easy to kill, so use a warrior. Wraiths:  a  well-timed
throw  of an axe kills them every time. If you miss,  use  a  sword
andchest-thrust movements. Don't let it get too close to you!  Spiders:  use
low thrusts to keep them at bay. If they get through your guard, retreat
until
you can turn and fight again.  The blue and green potions restore health, red
slows down monsters, and yellow give your characters extra confidence.

When picking locks, press F and all will be revealed.

HORROR ZOMBIES FROM CRYPT

HITCHHIKERS GUIDE TO THE GALAXY

 Ok everyone, hang on to your seats (and your towels!); this is probably
going to be the wildest adventure game you'll ever play...unless Infocom
comes out with a sequel, which they just might do!

  Before  we  get started, a few words of advice.  This is not the only way
of  getting through the game.  Many of the problems and situations (such as
the whale's belly) have more than one solution.  So, you might want to save
the game from time to time, and experiment a little, to see if you can find
other ways of doing things (actually, it's wise to save the game anyway, in
case you make a mistake).

  Also, consult the Guide frequently during play; you will gain some useful
insights to some of the objects you come across, and even some helpful
information (sometimes).  And remember, no matter how bad things may look:
DON'T PANIC!

  Here you are, mild-mannered Arthur Dent, about to start the worst day of
your life, although you don't know that...yet!  Actually, the day is
already getting off to a bad start, since you've just woken up in the dark,
with a really bad headache (and it's all downhill from here).

  The first thing you need to do is stand up and turn on the light.  That's
a little better, anyway!  Or maybe not, since you're having a hard time
getting coordinated.  Grab the dressing gown and put it on, then look in
the pocket.  Ah, an analgesic!  Take that, then get the screwdriver and the
toothbrush, and head South to the porch (did you hear a tree fall?  Rather
omnious, isn't it?).

  Here you find something no modern home should be without:  junk mail.
Take the mail, and go on outside.  Uh-oh!  There's a very big bulldozer on
its way to level your home, and there's Prosser standing by, watching it
all.  Are you going to take this lying down?

  You bet you are!  That's the only way to stop it:  lie down in front of
the bulldozer.  No matter how close the thing gets, don't panic; it won't
run you over (of course, in a short time, it really won't matter what
happens to the house, but you don't know that yet).  Just wait awhile until
Ford Prefect shows up (read the junk mail while you wait).

  Ford seems a trifle preoccupied with the sky, but he is aware enough of
you to try and give you back your towel.  Don't take it, or he'll leave and
you will be a lot worse off than you ever imagined (can things be worse
than this?  They sure can!).

  Instead of taking the towel, ask Ford about your home.  He will
eventually come to his senses, and realize what is going on.  When that
happens, he will be able to persuade Prosser to take your place in front of
the bulldozer while the two of you head off to the pub to hoist a few.

  As soon as Prosser takes your place, go South and West to the pub.  Buy a
cheese (?) sandwich while you wait for him to arrive (when you read the
description, you'll understand about the "?").  When Ford gets there, he'll
buy you a few beers.  Drink only three of them.

  Around about the time you've finished the third one, there will be a loud
crash.  In fact, it's the sound of your home being demolished by the
bulldozer (that will teach you to trust anyone who wears a digital watch!).
Don't take that sitting down, leave the pub and return to where your house
used to be.  Along the way, you'll see a starving dog.

  While you may wonder if anything could eat that sandwich and survive,
give it to the dog, who will (amazingly!) enjoy it immensely, ignoring a
microscopic space fleet that whizzes past (remember that fleet).  Then
continue on to the ruins of your home (Ford will be right behind you).

  And just about now, to put a perfect ending to a perfect day (which has
just barely begun), the Vogon construction ships appear, to demolish the
Earth to make way for a new Hyper-space Bypass (hmmm, maybe Ford wasn't
kidding when he said he was from another planet, or that Earth would be
destroyed in a short time).

  Still, don't panic...wait until Ford drops the Sub-etha signalling
device.  There won't be much time after that, so pick up the device, push
the green button (if you dropped the Aunt's thing, have no fear:  it will
turn up again later), and you will be in....the dark.

  Get used to that, you'll be spending a lot of time there before this
adventure is over.  Notice that, at first, you can't do much.  All your
five senses seem to be out of order.  However, if you wait, and read the
descriptions very carefully, you will see that eventually, it mentions only
4 of your senses.  The one that's missing is the one you can use.  Keep
this in mind, it will come in handy later.

  Right now, your nose seems to be working again, so smell.  Sniff, sniff.
Ugh!  Whatever it is, it sure is strong!  You are also now dimly aware of a
shadow, so look at it.  Well, well, it turns out to be Ford Prefect!  And,
looking around, you find yourself in the hold of a Vogon ship.  Certainly
better than being on Earth (or where Earth used to be).

  There's a glass case with an Atomic Vector Plotter inside, but don't
bother with it yet.  You have something else to do first, namely, obtain a
Babel Fish.  That shouldn't be hard, right?  All you need to do is push the
button on the dispensing machine, and you'll have one, right?
Hehehehehehe!

  Those Babel Fish are pretty slippery characters (but, you may have found
that out already for yourself!).  And the cleaning robots are certainly no
help; they seem to have only one mission in life:  grabbing your Fish away
from you.  Well, we really can't let that happen!

  So, first thing to do is remove your gown and hang it on the hook.  Now,
wait for Ford to curl up, then get the towel and the satchel.  Put the
towel over the drain, and the satchel in front of the robot panel.  Now
comes the part that drives most people crazy:  they don't know how to stop
the upper-half-of-the-room cleaning robot.  But, it's so simple:  just put
the junk mail on top of the satchel.

  Now you can push the button!  Then step back and watch the Rube Goldberg
shenanigans, which end with the Babel Fish stuck solidly in your ear
(squish!).  Bet you never thought outer space would be like this!  However,
now that you have the Fish, you'll be able to understand anyone who talks
to you.

By the way, somewhere along the line, you will get a message that one of
the phrases you've used was instrumental in starting a war that wiped out
most of a small galaxy.  There is nothing you can do about this; no matter
how you try, it will come to pass.  Rather unfortunate, isn't it?  Even
more unfortunate, sooner or later, the survivors will figure out how that
happened, and they will be looking for revenge....but more about that
charming prospect later.

  Right now, press the switch on the case.  This will tell you what the
code word is that will open the case so you can snatch the plotter.  Make
careful note of what word is required; it is chosen randomly each time.
Too bad you have to listen to some pretty rotten poetry to get the word.

  Speaking of poetry, in a short while, you and Ford will be hustled into
the Captain's quarters, and strapped into Poetry Appreciation Chairs
(worser things could happen, but right now, you probably can't think of
any).  After the Vogon Captain has tortured you with the first verse, grit
your teeth and enjoy the poetry.  He will then, to your dismay, read you
the next verse.

  While you could easily live without hearing it, in this case, you do need
to listen so you know the word to type in.  Fortunately, after the second
verse, you don't have to enjoy the poetry.  Unfortunately, since you
survived both verses, the Captain is going to have you and Ford shoved out
the airlock (you have now found something worse than appreciating Vogon
poetry).

  While Ford tries to talk the guard out of spacing the two of you, type in
the word from the poem.  You must put quotes around the word, or it won't
go through.  Then get the plotter when the case opens.  Now just wait
awhile, and you and Ford will soon be in the airlock, with very little time
left.

  In fact, time has just run out, and there you are in the depths of space.
Lucky for you, the Guide explained how to survive all of 30 seconds out
there!  Well, perhaps not so lucky, since, considering the vastness of
space, it's quite improbable that another ship will come by to pick you up
before the 30 seconds run out.  So naturally, 29 seconds later, the Heart
of Gold (the HOG) comes past and picks you up.

  There you are in the dark again.  Wait and watch the display, until it no
longer says you can't hear.  Then listen, and you will hear the sound of
the star drive.  Now it gets cute:  the program will lie to you, and say
there is an exit to port.  Don't you believe it!  Go Aft instead, and you
will be in Entry Bay #2.  You can ignore the brochure, if you like.

  Go Aft again, and you're in the Fore End of the corridor.  Here, Ford
will find you you, and take you up to the bridge, where you meet Zaphod and
Trillian.  Actually, you've seen them both before, at a party you attended
a short time ago.  While you listen to the chatter between Zaphod and Ford,
you can begin to drop some items here.

  You can drop the plotter, screwdriver, gown, and signalling device.  By
this time, everyone else has gone to the sauna, leaving you alone on the
Bridge with Eddie, the shipboard computer.  Don't mind Eddie, he's a little
over-protective, but he's a good sort at heart.  In fact, you can pretty
much ignore him, as well as Marvin the Paranoid Robot, although Marvin will
be important much later on (depressing as that may sound).

  Ok, time to prepare for some pretty weird happenings!  First you'll need
the spare improbability drive.  So, go down, then Aft.  Keep going Aft.
The program will tell you that the Engine Room is dangerous.  It LIES!
Don't listen to it, just keep going Aft.  Eventually, you'll get there.

  Of course, as soon as you're there, you'll want to look around.  The
program will tell you there is nothing to see.  That, too, is a lie!  Keep
looking, and you'll find that there are some things to see here, especially
the spare drive.  Don't worry about the tools for now; you can leave them
where they are.

  Once you have the drive, go back to the Fore End corridor, then head Port
where you'll find the Nutrimat (try consulting the Guide about the
Nutrimat).  Touch the pad, and you will be provided with a delicious (?)
cup of advanced tea substitute.  Fortunately, you don't have to drink it.
Take the cup (ignore the carton, it's useless) and return to the bridge.

  Drop the cup and the drive.  Now, plug the small plug in to the small
receptacle, and put the plotter's dangly bit into the tea substitute.  Ok,
you are about to have some pretty strange experiences, but before you throw
the switch, some words of advice and caution.

  There are five scenarios (all rather short, but all of them important),
that have to be completed.  They come up in random order, so each one has
its own little section of the walkthru.  The lead-in to each of them is
that familiar dark area, where you have to wait until one of your senses is
working again.  You will be in the dark area again when the scenario ends
(and you will have to listen for the drive sound), which will then bring
you back to the HOG.

  Also, be aware there are times that you may briefly go back to one of the
scenarios you have already completed.  You just sort of bounce in and out
of those, but you do have to spend time waiting in the dark.  I couldn't
find a way around this, so you'll just have to live with it.  Finally, it's
a good idea to save the game after you complete each scenario, just in
case.  With that said, it's time, so push the switch!

         The Bugblatter Beast
         --------------------

 When you come out of the dark, you find yourself in the Lair of the
dreaded Bugblatter Beast.  There are, perhaps, better places you could wish
yourself to be in, considering that, among its many charms, the Bugblatter
has those tungsten-carbide vast-pain claws (perhaps he was a dentist in a
previous life).

  However, you are here for a purpose, so you'll just have to do something
about the Beast.  Consulting the Guide tells you that Bugblatters are
incredibly stupid, which is certainly the case.  In the meantime, the Beast
is bearing down on you, demanding your name.  Don't be shy, introduce
yourself, then run like heck East out of the Lair.

  Pick up one of the sharp stones, and then cover your head with the towel.
Old Buggy is so dumb, he thinks that, since you can't see him, he can't see
you.  But, this won't last for very long, so you have to fool him, and
quickly.  Lucky for you, this isn't hard.

  Carve your name on the Bugblatter's memorial.  When he sees the name
there, he will think he's already eaten you, which is why he can't see you
(dumb may be an understatement here).  The Beast will then curl up for a
nap, leaving you free (after removing the towel!) to re-enter the Lair and
then go SouthWest.

  Here you will find the skeleton of some poor soul clutching a Nutrimat
Computer Interface Card.  Take the card, and just wait around for awhile.
You will be mistakenly captured as a Bugblatter Beast (talk about
insults!), but you will eventually be freed, and have some other adventures
along the way, before you find yourself back in the dark again.

  When you get back to the HOG, you can drop the asteroid paint chipper and
the interface card in the Fore End before going up to the Bridge (you'll
need the interface later, but there's no need to drag it around with you
now).  Once on the Bridge, push the switch again, and you'll be back in the
dark.

               Trillian
               --------

 The dark ends with something liquidy to the touch.  In fact, you find your
fingers bathing in a glass of wine.  Coming to your senses, you realize
that you are now Trillian, and you are at the party where you (she?) met
both Arthur and a mysterious man named Phil.

  Take a good look at Arthur, and you will see he has a huge ball of fluff
on his jacket.  Just what you want, but your hands are full.  Drop the
plate you're holding, and get the fluff.  Open your handbag and put the
fluff in it, then get the plate again (otherwise, the pushy hostess won't
leave you alone).

  Now, all you need to do is wait, trying not to be bored to tears by
Arthur's feeble attempts at conversation.  Give Phil a look, and shortly he
will come over, and take you out to his scooter.  As you blast off,
everything once again becomes.....dark.


                 Ford
                 ----

 Now you find yourself standing in a country lane, holding a satchel.  The
place looks familiar.  In fact, it's the lane outside Arthur's home, and
this time you seem to be Ford Prefect.

  Those Vogons will be arriving soon, so there's not much time.  Open the
satchel, and take the satchel fluff, the towel, and the sub-etha signalling
device.  Go North, and there you will see Arthur lying in front of the
bulldozer.

  With a certain feeling of deja vu, you offer him the towel.  However,
instead of taking it, he asks you about his home.  You suddenly realize
what is going on (not that it really matters, considering what will shortly
happen!).  In a moment of magnanimity (or possibly madness), you decide to
take Arthur hitchhiking with you.

  But first, you have to deal with Prosser.  Go over to him, and ask him to
lie down in front of the bulldozer.  He'll make a little fuss, but you'll
manage to persuade him.  Now, you and Arthur can hurry over to the pub, and
drink some beer (remember to buy peanuts).

  Sit there, drinking your beer (no more than three!), meditating on why
Arthur is taking the imminent demise of the world so calmly, until the
house falls and Arthur goes tearing out.

  Follow him to the ruins of his home.  Drop the satchel, and put the
satchel fluff on top of it.  Now wait.  The Vogon ships will appear, the
winds will pick up, and you'll start fumbling with the device.

  Oops!  You just dropped it!  Fortunately, it rolls over by Arthur, who
picks it up and looks at it.  Also fortunately, Arthur manages to push the
right button, and everything becomes....dark.

                Zaphod
                ------

 You come out of the dark to find that you're now Zaphod Beeblebrox, the
President of the Universe.  In fact, you're on your way to steal the Heart
of Gold (with a little help from Trillian).

  As your speedboat zooms towards its destination, search the seat
carefully and you will find seat fluff and a key.  The key opens the
toolbox, but you don't need to do that now.  Just make sure you take the
box; you might be needing it later.

  Now, if you continue on your present course, you'll never make it between
the cliffs and the spire (or maybe you know that already).  The trick is to
make the auto-pilot do the hard work, so steer the boat towards the rocky
spire.

  The spire gets closer...closer....closer....and then, at last!  the
auotpilot wakes up, just in time, and steers you to safety!  Whew, that was
a close one.  Ok, now you can stand up and go North to the Dais, where the
dedication ceremonies will be held.

  Wait around, enjoying the cheers of the crowd (read the banner if you
like), until Trillian appears.  She will jump out of the crowd, and hold a
gun to one of your heads.  The guards are a little hesitant about what to
do, so now's your chance:  tell them not to shoot.

  After a few moments, they will drop their rifles into a pile..just what
you've been waiting for.  Tell Trillian to shoot the rifles.  As the
weapons disappear, you and Trillian make a break for the HOG!  You made
it!!  But...everything seems to be getting....dark.


             The War Room
             ------------

 Ah ha, fooled ya!  I bet when you heard the sound of the star drive, you
thought you were back on the HOG.  But, surprise!  you're in the War Room
of a mighty war fleet approaching Earth (at least you're yourself this
time!).

  Hmmmm, looking around, you see an ultra-plasmic awl.  Pick that up, since
it might come in handy later.  Now, take a good look at the aliens.  They
are Vl'hurg and G'guvunt.  Sound familiar?  Ring any bells?  Remember that
small galaxy you pretty much wiped out with your careless words?

  Well, they finally figured out what happened, and now they are on their
way to Earth to take revenge!  (Uh oh) You can't really stop them, so just
wait around and hope for the best.

  The fleet gets closer and closer, and then arrives.  Amazingly, the first
thing they see is....a huge dog happily munching a cheese (?) sandwich!
The sight of this giant monster, contentedly eating, softens the hearts of
the Vl'hurgs and G'guvunts.

  With a new mission in life, they turn around and go home.  Along the way,
they transport you back to the HOG.  Unfortunately, since the aliens are
microscopic, so are you.....and you end up materializing inside your own
head!

  But wait....maybe there is a madness in this method, after all (or is
that the other way around?).  Move along the maze of synapses (any
direction will do, they're all alike), until you come to the particle.

  Look at the particle, and you will see it's your common sense.  If
there's one thing you surely don't need in THIS adventure, it's common
sense, so take the particle.  Whoops!  Everythig just went.....dark.

 Ok, now you should have collected the four fluffs, the ultra-plasmic awl,
the paint chipper, the nutrimat computer interface, and the tool box.
After you have done the last scenario (whichever one that is), don't go
back to the Bridge.  Pick up the interface, and go to the Nutrimat.  It's
tea time!

  Open the panel on the Nutrimat, remove the circuit board, and replace it
with the interface.  Now, touch the pad.  With a clearer idea of just what
it is you want, the Nutrimat begins to have some problems.  Its own limited
circuitry can't handle it (well, it's just a dumb machine, after all), so
it ties into the main shipboard computer.

  Don't spend time here watching the Nutrimat go through its gyrations.
Head for the bridge, and plug the large plug into the large receptacle.
The moment is almost here:  the HOG has arrived at the legendary lost
planet of Magrathea, and the natives aren't friendly.

  In fact, they are sending up a bunch of missiles to vaporize the HOG
(hmmm, they really AREN'T friendly!).  Now, push the switch on the spare
drive.  Wow!  Talk about improbabilities!  The missiles have turned into a
giant sperm whale!

  After accepting the congratulations of Ford, Zaphod, and Trillian (who
conveniently disappear into the sauna again), return to the Nutrimat, where
you will find, at last, a cup of REAL tea.  Get the cup (you will drop the
No Tea), but don't drink it!!  Bring it to the Bridge.

  Drop the real tea (you will automatically pick up the No Tea).  Remove
the dangly bit from the tea substitute, and put it in the real tea.  You
have one more little trip to make.  First, however, drop everything you are
carrying except the Babel Fish and the Aunt's Thing (yes, you have it
again, you just can't get rid of it).

  Push the switch on the Drive.  After a short stay in the dark, you will
find yourself in the whale's tummy (it may, however, take more than try to
get here, but you will make it eventually).  There's a flowerpot here!  Get
the pot, and put it in the Aunt's Thing.  Now, wait around (you really
don't have a choice), and soon you will be in the dark again.

  Ah, back on the HOG at last.  If you take inventory, you'll notice you
don't have the Aunt's Thing.  Don't panic!  It will, as always, turn up.
In the meantime, go around picking up the various fluffs.  The Zaphod
fluff, along with the tool box, will be by the hatch.  Trillian's, of
course, is in her handbag, and Ford's is on the satchel, and the last one
is in the pocket of your gown (unless you took it out earlier and dropped
it somewhere).

  The Aunt's Thing has reappeared by now, so go up to the Bridge.  Take the
flowerpot, plant all four fluffs, drop the pot, and wait awhile.  When you
see a tiny sprout has formed, take the pot into the sauna.  When you
emerge, a changed man, you will also have a changed plant.

  However, there is another problem!  The HOG has landed on Magrathea, but
Eddie, overprotective as usual, has jammed the hatch shut.  And, he's not
going to open it, no matter how long it takes him to check for dangers on
the planet (which will be quite a few years).

 You are almost ready!  First, eat the fruit from the plant (mmm, tasty!).
You have a vision, and pay close attention to it:  the vision shows you
what tool Marvin will need to open the hatch.  This varies from game to
game, and there is no way to know which one it is until you eat the fruit.
That is also why you have to collect all those tools.  Get the tool that
you saw in the vision.  If it happens to be one you haven't seen yet, then
you'll find it in Marvin's pantry.

  The trick now is to find Marvin, and he's in his pantry, behind the
screening door.  First, get the real tea.  You automatically drop the No
Tea.  But, you don't have your common sense anymore, so....pick up the No
Tea!  Now, you have both Tea and No Tea at the same time!!

  Go to the Screening Door.  Open it.  The Door, impressed by your being
able to have both Tea and No Tea will let you through!  However, WAIT!!!
Don't go through the door yet!  If you set foot in the pantry, you will be
overwhelmed by depression!  So, that magic moment has arrived, the moment
you've been waiting for ever since you left Earth:  drink the real tea!!
(Ahhhhhh, good to the last drop!)

  All right!  Now you can go into the Pantry (yay)!  Marvin will be there,
sulking as usual.  Tell him to fix the hatch.  Marvin will grumble, but he
will agree to it, and tell you to meet him at the Hatch Access Space, with
the proper tool, in twelve moves.

  As you already have the tool (thanks to the fruit), you can go directly
to the Access space (drop everything but the tool and the Fish), and wait
for Marvin.  When he arrives and asks for the tool, give it to him.  Marvin
will fiddle briefly, and the hatch will slide open.

  Go out to the Hatch, and then down the Hatch.  Wow!  You have now set
foot on the legendary lost planet of Magrathea, and........

  And what comes next, will have to wait for the sequel (and let's hope it
isn't too long a wait!!!)!

IT CAME FROM THE DESERT
Before attempting to go into the ants' nest, you should first save Elmer to
get more flame-thrower fuel.  Some time between the 8th and 10th (I don't
remember the  exact day), he will leave  a note in his station saying that he
is going hiking in the SW Volcanic Cone.  Go to the volcano, fight the ants,
and next day, visit Elmer's station.  He'll thank you for saving his  life
and give you more flamethrower fuel.

The entrance to the ants' nest will never appear on the main map, but there
are several other ways to get there:

        - By taking a flight from Hilber's Field.

        - By driving a tank from a battle going on at a nearby location.

        - By going south when you are in a battle at the M1 mine.

The entrance to the nest doesn't stay open long enough for you to get in
before the ants start invading the various locations in the town, so you'll
have to wait until they do. The 11th is the best day to enter the hole since
it is very hot and there are few ants around. If you try cooler days,  there
will probably be too many of them around for you to handle.  Also, if you
decide toget to the hole by plane, you can land safely on the dirt road
parallel to the tracks leading to the M1 mine.

KICK OFF
As your opponent gets ready to make a shot hold down fire and it will be
blocked.

 1. To score within the first few seconds of a restart, trap the ball,
charge straight up the pitch and shoot as you approach the penalty spot
- there is a good chance it'll go in. The computer teams are wise to
this tactic, but they tend to foul you on the way instead of tackling,
so the run can continue from the free kick - you may even get a penalty!
If someone uses this tactic against you, the best thing to do
is intercept the attacker - don't just chase him. Wait for control to
switch to a defender in his path and then move up the pitch towards him
to make the tackle. However, because everything happens so fast, it is
frequently a matter of resorting to hacking the attacker mercilesly to
the ground - brutally effective.

 2. Corners

     Another good scoring chance. There are two main method for putting the
     ball in the net. Either pull the ball back into the middle of the penalty
     area where a waiting player can blast it home, or float it across the
     goal mouth for an incoming forward to nudge it in - there is a good
     possibility that the ball will even curve in and score directly this
     way.
     Never hit the ball low to near post because the keeper will always
     collect it. Also beware of lofting the ball deep into the area because
     in this position it is much harder to control.
     Defending against corners is difficult. You quickly have to spot what
     sort of kick is being taken and then get someone to the ball to clear
     it. The most dangerous kick is the in-swinger across the goal, because
     you are likely to put it in you own net! With these you just have to
     hope everyone misses and it goes past.

  3. Penalties

     A 90% success rate can be achieved by following these instructions. Wait
     until the arrow is approaching the middle point and give a sharp tap on
     the fire button. Anything more than the shortest of taps will send the
     ball sailing over the crossbar. If you leave the shot until the arrow
     has reached or goes past the middle, the ball will almost certainly go
     wide.

  4. Throw-Ins

     Don't hack the ball straight upfield from a throw in, because it
     invariably goes out again. What you have to do is angle the ball infield
     before kicking it. Alternatively, you can dribble the ball, but this is
     more hazadous because there are always opposition players at close range
     to throw-ins that may tackle you.

  5. Passing And Shooting

     There are two main methods for kicking the ball - the kick-on-the-run
     and the trap-and-kick. The KOTR is quicker and goes further, but it is
     very hard to get it to go anywhere other than the direction you've been
     running - although 45,90 and even 180 degree changes of the direction
     are possible with a quick change of joystick angle just as the ball is
     kicked. This is also the method for changing direction when dribbling.
     To perform the trap-and-kick method, the fire button has to be pressed
     down just before the player runs into the ball, then held. He can then
     swivel round freely and kick the ball in any direction by releasing the
     button. Theoretically, it will be passed to another player, but you still
     have to aim. This is particularly handy if you are running in the wrong
     direction and when used well can result in very accurate and satisfying
     safe passing manoeuvres.

  6. Dribbling

     Because the ball i not `stuck' to the end of your boot as in most other
     footy games, dribbling is an art that has to be learnt. Running in a
     straight line is easy, but changing direction isn't. 45 degree changes
     are possible by hitting the diagonal at the moment, but anything else
     requires a quick sidestep or detour around the ball, so that it can be
     approached from another angle. It sounds difficult, but with practice
     you get used to the timing of the actual contacts with the ball while
     dribbling, so that changes of direction can be made quickly and easily.

  7. Tackling

     The easiest method of dispossesing someone on the ball is just to run
     into them. However, if you're approaching from behind and they are
     getting ever nearer to the goal, have no hesitation in hacking them
     down - as long as it is outside the penalty area. Professional fouls
     are best used when the ref is easy-going - or better still blind!!

  8. Referees

     Pay attention early on how the ref reacts to fouls. If he is whistle-
     happy then try to dribble with the ball a lot. Hopefully, several of the
     opposition will get sent off or give away penalties. If he does not give
     yellow cards straight away, then feel free to hack the opposition down
     whenever necessary.

  9. Goal Kicks

     It's crucial to learn how to win the ball from the goal kicks and again
     there are two main methods. Either time the run to collide with the ball
     just as it bounces, allowing you to dribble away immediately, or hit the
     fire button with the joystick centred to leap into the air and head the
     ball on. The second tactic can gain valuable ground quickly. If these
     prove too difficult then try to trap the ball when it comes down by
     holding down the fire button.

 10. Human Opponents

     They are very susceptible to the charge straight up the pitch, so always
     go for it. Try to trap the ball in the penalty area and wait for your
     panicking opponent to hack you down, giving a penalty. It works a treat
     - and will really annoy them, to boot!
     One final tip for when playing against a human opponent...  Whenver you
     score a goal, shout "YEAH!" really loudly and repeatedly punch the air.
     This doesn't half rattle your opponent!

 11. Computer Opponents

     Possession is the key: give them too many chances and they will always
     score. Go for 4-4-2 or 5-3-2 formations so that you have plenty of
     defensive and midfield control. 4-3-3 is pretty useless and 4-2-4 is
     only for the brave who reckon they can out-play the computer - a tall
     order.
     The ultimate challenge is the USSR team because they are so fast. The
     trick to remember with them is not to futiley chase the ball-carrier
     with your (generally slower) players, but to wait for control to switch
     to a player in his path, then clear from the tackle.

^E
KICK OFF II
BEFORE THE MATCH

   1. Action Replay

      Make sure you have a formatted disk ready! Select STORE and fill in the
      match details. For example, the first one for Tom playing Jerry would
      be something like `TvJ1' - that way you can easily find the goal you're
      after.

   2. Pitches

      Normal - is the standard Kick Off pitch, with good bounce control
      Wet - is similar to normal, but with les bounce and roll.
      Soggy - has hardly any bounce or roll. After a high kick, the ball will
              stop dead, so look out for goal mouth scrambles!
      Plastic - is extremely bouncy, causing the ball to leave the picth quite
                often.

   3. Team Selection

      When shuffling the player and formations around, make sure that you have
      enough of the right players to fill the positions, otherwise you could
      be left wide open with no hope of winning.
      If you're playing in position, keep the game speed a bit slower,
      otherwise the game will speed on by without you seeing much action.

  THE MATCH

   1. General Tactics

      As with Kick Off, there are various styles of play. The first is
      dribbling. This isn't highly recommended, since the computer players
      are sharp and will soon tackle you.
      Your best bet is to trap the ball and pass it to a clear player who is
      more likely to have a clean run.
      If you want to get a particularly long clearance, then run to the ball,
      pull back on the joystick and at the same time hit the fire button.
      With a little practice this is useful for belting the ball a long way
      clear after those mad goal mouth scrambles!
      If you are using aftertouch, remember to use it when shooting. Make a
      note of where the goalie is and try to bend the shot away from him by
      moving the joystick left or right just after you kick. This is more
      often than not bamboozles them completely. Try to get into a position
      where you can carry this out effectively. A good way is to run wide
      and cross the ball into the centre. The goalie will tend to run towards
      you, allowing you to bang the ball past him.

   2. The Goalkeeper

      Although the goalie appears to be automatic, you do have a certain
      amount of control over him. When he has hold of the ball, always hit
      the fire button before he throws it to give the ball a hefty belt up the
      pitch. This is the best way to ensure you of a good start to your
      attack.

   3. Throw-Ins

      If you do nothing, the ball will be thrown out to the nearest player,
      but if you are in your own half, give the ball a hefty throw up the
      pitch. If you are close to being level with the opponent's penalty
      area, then give it a good long throw into the centre and try to bully
      it away from the keeper to get a run up for a shot.

   4. Penalties

      Don't just rely on getting the timing as it travels towards the centre
      as in Kick Off - the timing is much tighter. Wait until the arrow is at
      the outermost point of travel, then just you see it move inwards (don't
      anticipate it, or you'll go wide) quickly give the fire button a short
      tap.
      If you are defending against a penalty, move the joystick and hold it
      to the side that the arrow is on (in other words, follow it from side
      to side) then press the fire button as the attacker takes the kick.
      This should allow you to dive in the right direction most of the time.

   5. Setpiece Free Kicks

      These take a lot of practice to get right, but there is one method
      which you can use a basis for more complex moves. Push and hold the
      joystick in the opposite direction from the goal (that is push left
      if you are to the right of the goal and vice versa) and tap the fire
      button. As soon as you press the fire button, move the joystick in
      the opposite direction. The ball should bend in towards the goal, if
      not, then just keep practising!

   6. Corners

      The same directional tactics as Kick Off work, but remember that the
      time you hold the fire button down controls the strength of the kick.

   7. General Tips

      Use a balanced approach to get comfortable in the game.
      Use a blitz if you're losing with only a few minutes left.
      Use a lockout if you want to stay safe for the last few minutes.

KING'S QUEST I

King Edward's domain has been ravaged. Through trickery, three of the King's
items of power have been stolen from him. The Kingdom lies in ruin.  It's
Downfall is imminent.  It is up to you, Sir Graham, to recover the King's
treasures.  Succeed and you shall be crowned King of Daventry!  Fail and the
worst of fates shall befall you!

One word of caution before you start:  Never drop anything until you're
told to do so.  Once an item is dropped in this game, you cannot pick it
up again.  For some reason, you're never weighed down by too many items;
So you should be able to pick up and carry every item with you at all times.
Also, in order to get maximum points, you must pick up everything you can
and look at it, read it, or whatever is required.

Begin your quest by going northwest to the garden.  Once there, pick a
carrot and go west to the other side of the garden, south to the left of
the castle and west to the rock. Stand on the north side of the rock and
move it. Doing so reveals a dark hole. Look in the hole and then get the
dagger. Then go west and swim west across the pond (both screens). Once
out of the pond, go north to the well and west to the gate in the corral.

Open the gate and enter the corral. When you see the goat, show it the
carrot. Now he'll follow you wherever you go. This is important as
you'll soon see.  Exit the corral and head west twice. You may or may not
see a fairy godmother handing out blessings. If you do see her, she'll
give you a short lived protective spell. If you don't see her, no problem.
She'll pop up every now and then.

Now go north to the clover patch and get a clover. This is a four-leaf
clover and will protect you from leprechauns if the need arises. Go
north to the wooden bridge. (Goat still with you?) As you start to cross
the bridge, an ugly troll bars the way and refuses to let you pass
unless you throw him a treasure. However, your goat, which hates trolls,
rushes the troll and butts him off the bridge! The troll is swept
downriver, never to be seen again. The goat, having fulfilled its use,
strolls away. So way goodbye and cross the bridge and continue north.

You've found a crotchety old gnome and when you talk to him, he informs
you that he has something to give you that might be useful...But only if
you can guess his name! The crusty old fellow gives you three chances.
Type "IFNKVOHGROGHPRM" and the gnome, in amazement, says "That's Right!"
and leaves a handful of magic beans laying on the ground. The gnome's
name, by the way, is a cryptogram. The alphabet's been reversed and the
new letter set has been substituted for "RUMPELSTILTSKIN".

Get the beans and go east to another wood bridge.  Be careful you don't
fall in the gorge!  Cross the bridge and go east to the flower patch.
Plant the beans here and all of a sudden, a huge beanstalk stretches up
out of sight into the clouds!  Don't climb it yet, though.  Go east and
swim east across the lake.  When you exit the lake, continue east, look
in the hole in the big rock as you pass...what an odd green glowing!. Go
east again.  A little dwarf may come and make a quick inspection of your
possessions to see if there's anything of value.  You don't have anything
of note and he leaves.  Now go east once more to the little beach by the
river.  Get the pebbles you see laying here then go west back to the
beanstalk. CAUTION!  Save your game here.  Climbing the beanstalk is a
risky business and you'll most certainly fall off it many times before
you reach the top.

Climb the beanstalk until it enters the clouds.  Leave the beanstalk by
going east into the clouds and continue east until you enter an area of
trees.  When you reach the first set of trees, head south then east twice
until you come to a tree with a hole in its base.  Look in the hole and get
the sling.  Go back west twice to the fruit tree then north.  Now this is a
bit tricky.  There is a tree on the upper right edge of the screen that you
should go to before you go east to the next screen.  This area will give you
the most amount of time to evade the giant before he KILLS YOU!

Go east...There he is!  Go as quickly as you can and hide behind the
center tree. Make sure Graham is completely hidden behind the tree. Now
just wait there. Eventually, the gian will become tired and lie down
under the tree and go to sleep.  Now's your chance...

The chest he's carrying is King Edward's Magic Chest!  Get it and head
west back to the beanstalk. Make sure you walk in the right places or
you'll fall out of the clouds!  It would be a good idea to save your game
before you descend. Go back down the beanstalk and head south three
times then east to the well.

Stand on the north side of the well and cut the rope.  Cutting the rope
gets the bucket for you. Now lower the rope into the well and climb down
the rope. When you get to the end of your rope (so to speak!), dive
under the water and head southwest into the hole. Careful not to become
tangled in the weeds!

When you exit the hole, you're face to face with a fire-breathing
dragon! Stay in the middle of your screen and go only as far as the
second rock. Throw water on the Dragon's Fire and he's vanquished! In
fact, he's so embarrassed that he moves a boulder blocking the western
exit from the cave and skulks away! On the northern side of the cave is
the King's Magic Mirror!  Take the mirror and leave the cave by going
west twice.  Outside the cave, you see a large, friendly bird flying back
and forth. We'll get to him later, though, so head south twice to the stump.

Look in the stump and you see an old canvas pouch. Get the pouch and
look inside it. When you so so, you see it's filled with sparkling
diamonds!  Go east and swim east across the lake twice, then continue
east to where you found the dagger and north to the big tree. Climb the
tree and go to the west. Craddled in the nest in a large golden egg! Get
the egg and climb down the tree and go north twice to the tree.

Laying on the ground under the tree are walnuts.  Get a walnut and open
it.  On the inside you find a sold gold walnut!  Go east and get the bowl
you see, then go south.  Running around the banks of the lake is a
friendly little elf.

Talk to the elf and he's so impressed by your manners that he gives you
a magic ring!  Wearing it will make you invisible...But only once!  So
save it until you need it!

Go north, east twice and north twice to the back of the woodcutter's
house.  Now go west and enter the front door.  Inside you see a deplorable
sight.  A starving woodcutter and his wife sit dejectedly at an empty
table.  Too bad you can't help them..say perhaps that bowl...?  Look at
the bowl and you see the word "FILL" written on its bottom.  Give the
bowl to the woodcutter.  He looks at you wondering why you'd give them
an empty bowl.  Say "FILL" and the simple ceramic bowl fills to the brim
with hot stew!  For this precious gift (an unending supply of food!), the
woodcutter gives you his only other possession, an old fiddle laying in
the corner.  Get the fiddle (careful you don't fall through the floor!)
and leave the cottage.

So, go south from the woodcutter's house, swim across the lake in a southerly
direction, then continue south and go around to the front door of the witch's
cottage.  (Taste her house, if you must, it's quite good!).  Save your game
at this point.  Open the cottage door and make your way to the bedroom. Now
wait. Eventually, the witch will come home.  She won't see you because you're
in the other room.  Sneak up on her and push her into the stove!  You done
the old hag in and can move about her house without fear now.

Go to the cabinet on the north wall, open it and take the cheese wedge.
Now go back south and leave the cottage.  Now comes the fun part.  Go west
and south to the front of the cave where you found the magic mirror.  The
large friendly bird seems to be waiting for you!  Go down to the lower
middle portion of your screen and keep jumping up until the bird (which
is actually a condor) catches. you.

The condor flies high up in the air and carries you to a small island
which lies in the moat in front of the castle.  When he drops you, your
head spins as you try to regain your bearings.  There's an odd hole in
the ground here, but don't go down into it just yet.  Head west and get
the mushroom you see growing here.  Now go back east and down into the
hole.  Oops, the long drop seems to have set your head spinning again!
When it stops spinning, go south to the end of the tunnel then
*CAUTIOUSLY* head west.

There's a hungry rat running in circles here and when you talk to it,
he says he won't let you pass until you give him a treasure.  Don't get
too close to it!  Throw the cheese to the rat.  Being hungry, he's just as
satisfied with the cheese as he would have been with a treasure, and he
scurries away into some unseen crevice in the rocks.  Go to the door,
open it, and go west through the door.

On the other side of the door is a tiny leprechaun, who, upon seeing
your clover, lets you pass unmolested.  Go south and play the fiddle for
the King of the Leprechauns.  They dance and dance to your music then
finally they all leave the hall.  As the King of the Leprechauns leaves,
he forgets to take his sceptre!  Get the sceptre and look!  Next to the
leprechaun king's throne is King Edward's Magic Shield!

Get the shield and go west up the stairs.  Continue west until you come
to the little hole in the western wall.  Now, eat your mushroom and
you're shrunken down to a size small enough to allow you to enter the
hole.  Go west into the hole and you find yourself in front of the big
rock where you saw the strange green glow!  Eventually, you regain your
former size, but wasn't it fun being so tiny?

Go north twice then east three times to the left hand side of the castle.
Walk (carefully!) across the bridge and open the door.  Enter the
castle and follow the hallway to the throne of King Edward.  Bow to the King
and he descends his throne.  You've managed to recover the strength of
Daventry and the king places his crown upon your head!  As he does so, he
falls to the ground in a seizure and dies.  Heavy lies the head that
wears the crown.  You ascend to the throne to govern Daventry as Kind
Edward had...Guarding the treasures of power that you labored so long to
recover.

KINGS QUEST III
The King's Quest series of games uses the debug command and interpreter for
the programmers (up to KQIII) KQIV doesn't have it because of the tremendous
size of the game.   Have some fun and press the "ALT" key then "D" then
"Return or Enter" (I think twice) then type in either GET OBJECT (and type in
a random #) or "TP" for transport (and a random #) and see what happens.  It
works., and if you're tired of looking for a certain object the "Get Object"
function works great!  If you want to go to a room, use the ALT-D thing, then
type (TP.  The computer should ask you which room you'd like to go to.  Enter
a three digit number from 008 to 045.
When casting a spell and asked to recite a verse just hit RETURN.

KRISTAL
Fights - Proficent swordplay is  essential if your to  get anywhere in the
game.  The neck chop is one  of the more effective blows,  but the program
blocks repetition of single moves. To get around this, occassionaly switch to
a differnt move in order to enable the neck chop once again. Give generously
to the poor and youll  be a step closer to obtaining the Sword of the
Spheres.

The Palace - To enter  the palace,  youll need  to get  the invitation
from the elusive Gloop, found in Novala. Once you have it, keep out of
fights or you  could lose  it for good.  When you get into the palace,
ask Nedrod  three questions  and he will give you the talisman,  which
can help you find another useful item.  Answer the Princess's question
with "Its a secret".  She will give you the  Ring of Belz,  which will
only work in conjunction with the spell scroll.

In General - Objects are not always found in the same places from game to
game, so a detailed search of both fore and backgrounds is often in order.
To survive the final  confrontation,  a high psychic rating is needed, which
can be increased by donating skringles to the poor. Disorderly conduct can
have the opposite effect.  The safest technique in the space battles, is to
slow right down as soon as you see the aliens shoot them all,  then power at
full  steam until the next lot.  Follow Readheads ship  if you see it.
Heatpro  tablets are  necessary if you beam down to one  of the hotter
planets.  Makes notes of  what you are told, and use any new  names or
subjects to  weavel out every last bit of information from the characters.
^E
KULT
    First, how to complete the five ordeals:

    THE TWINS - OBJECT = GOBLET

      Go to the source on the left hand side. Inspect the fountain and press
the eye. Fill the Goblet and go back to the room called 'THE TWINS'. Open
the left-hand serpent and empty the goblet into it. Get the die that emerges
from the serpent then open the right hand serpent. Throw the die, and note
the number thrown. Put the die into the right-hand serpent and go to the
room facing you. The hands are in a dice formation (except for the middle
one) Pull up the hands until they resemble the formation you threw earlier,
then push the serpent's head on the wall. The sliding partition should open;
note down the shape which it covered. Go back to the fountain room and
inspect each cube (each is patterned). Lift the cube which resembles the one
you found behind the sliding partition.

   IN THE SCORPION'S PRESENCE - OBJECT = FLY

      Pray to the statue then enter the room called 'THE WEB'. Look at the
web on the floor and crawl on it. Give the mistress the fly; show affection
but don't be too saucy with her. Feed the fly to the blue spider and get the
red one. Leave the room, and then put the red spider into the statue's
mouth. Don't listen to the man who pops out, just pass through trapdoor.

   THE WALL - OBJECT = DAGGER (CAN USE PSI-SHIFT !)

      First choose the third zone, then the second zone; this means that you
can unlock the sliding wall when you open either door. Go through either
door, left or right, and inspect the step. Then take a look at the slot on
the Sculpted Warrior and climb onto the step. Either put your dagger into
the slot, or if you haven't got one, use Psi-Shift. You will be spun around
by the wall. There are now TWO seperate gaps in the wall, one which goes
straight on, and the other is a dark, black strip; it depends on which door
you have taken. Move the cursor to go down the black passage, not straight
on. Stick your hand in the gap on the floor. Return the way you came, and
this time go straight on.

   DE PROFUNDIS - OBJECT = ROPE

      First of all, wait. Then lasso your rope onto the hook on the ceiling.
When the Granite Monster lurks towards you, jump onto him. Wait a few
minutes.

   THE NOOSE - OBJECT = none

      Do not do as the Poormouth says. Use either the lantern, or your Solar
Eyes Power. Grab hold of left hand rope and climb up. Push the lever, remove
the noose-rope and he will fall. Take the left-hand piece of rope. Inspect
the hollow on the platform. Finally, leave and go to the Master's Orbit.

   WHAT TO DO AFTER YOU HAVE GOT THE FIVE SKULLS

      Give all five skulls to the Protozorg underneath the trader. He will
announce that you are a divot. Go to the concourse outside the ring, and
remember, if you are asked any questions, show the egg you were given. Once
you are in the concourse, ignore the guard and use all the violence you can
muster on the upper right-hand guard; then enter the upper right-hand
passage.
      Go left. Inspect the toad's head and poke it's eye. Use the Lantern
(if you have it) or the Solar Eyes to see. Inspect the lever and the
trapdoor. Use Psi-Shift on the lever and pass through the trapdoor. Next
keep going straight through until you meet Norma Jean and Ash. You MUST do
as Norma Jean says. Don't move !! Tell her the truth...talk to both of them
and then use your Zone Scan. Lift your block on the floor and get both
objects, the beam and the flask. Unwrap the bandages from the mummy, go to
the left and keep going forward.
      By going through the trapdoor you will enter the Threshold of Truth.
Kill the priestess and put the egg in the opened mouth. Next off, take a
look at the Lantern. Read the book, then use your Psi-Shift on the statuette
to retrieve it on the left-hand side, near the ceiling.
      Leave and go to the refectory, then go to Saura's Repose. Put the
statuette you found into the niche then go to the Presence of God, and then
to Placating the Powers. Kill the first priestess, then make use of
Psi-Shift on Saura's Mark, aiming it at her dagger. Use Brain Warp on the
character, Sci-Fi, then giver her the flask to drink. Go to Saura's Repose,
putting the monkey into the small tunnel. Enter the Presence of God and
wait. Go into the passage. Wait. Use aggro on the god, Zorg, and then use
Brain Warp on Pratozim, who is holding Sci-Fi hostage. Use Psi-Shift on trap
door, and finally, throw the knife or dagger at Pratozim.

LASER SQUAD
Hints :

   1. The most appropriate type of fire is usually determined by the distance
      from the target. Auto fire is usually best at close range or when
      firing at more than one target, whereas Aimed fire is best at long
      distances. Snap shots can be used at medium distances or when you want
      to preserve ammunition at close range.

   2. Always leave some, if not most, of your units with enough action points
      for Opportunity fire, unless you are absolutely sure that there is no
      enemy nearby.

   3. Armour is often a luxury on the higher levels. It's better to spend
      your credits on decent weapons.

   4. Give grenades to units with high strength values, as it determines how
      far thaey can be thrown.

   5. Give accurate weapons such as Sniper Rifles and Marsec Auto-guns to
      units with high weapon skills, as they can naturally make best use of
      them.

   6. You can scavenge weapons and ammunition from dead bodies. This is
      especially useful on higher levels when you can't afford good weapons
      or you're running short of ammunition (or `ammo').

   7. Buy ammo for weapons which are likely to run out before the end of the
      game. uch a some automatic weapons.

   8. Weapons with explosive ammo (rocket launchers and auto-cannons) should
      not be used in enclosed areas or you may blow yourself up!

   9. If see an enemy, but are unlikely to be able to kil him that turn, it
      may be best to move into cover, otherwise you will alert other enemy
      units to your presence.

  10. Grenades can be used to kill enemy units you suspect may be hiding
      around a corner without triggering their Opportunity fire.

  11. Be careful when firing near oxygen tanks or gas cylinders as they can
      explode. If you're not near any cylinders, but enemy units are, then
      you can fire at the cylinders (as they are a bigger target) to take
      them out.

  12. Don't carry too much equipment, as this will inevitably slow you down
      considerably.

Ok...well, we'll start out in Joe's Bar.  This is where you decide whether
you want to be a boy or a girl.  If you want to be a boy, go NW; if you
wanna be a girl, go NE.  The next thing to do is to GET STOOL.  Then PISS.
Then go back the way you came, either SE or SW.  Now for the fun
part...type LEWD, then 19(for your age).  Now WAIT until you're in the

hatch now.  So, DISMOUNT, GET SUIT, WEAR SUIT, OPEN HATCH, N.  Now you are
matched up against an assassin with bad breath.  So, you gotta kill him
before he kills you.  HIT THORBAST WITH SWORD, then press G until it says
that his sword is coming toward you.  This may take a long time, but it
will work.  If you wish, you may want to alternate between commands like
swing sword, hit sword, kill assassin, etc.  Anyway, once you see that
happen, GET HIS SWORD and then OFFER HIS SWORD TO THORBAST.  Now with
Thorbast out of the way, HIT MONSTER WITH SWORD and UNSTRAP YOUNG WOMAN.
Now FOLLOW YOUNG WOMAN and you'll get the photo of Jean Harlow.  Now OPEN

LEISURE SUIT LARRY I
You can go to any location in the game by by hitting ALT-D and entering (TP).
It asks for a location number, so enter 008-045.

Skip the proof of age questions by hitting ALT X.

Complete Walkthrough:

This solve didn't get all the points, But it finishes the game.

  The 1st step is to enter the bar, go to the bathroom and read the walls
several times until you get the password. Then go to the sink and get the
ring. You can use the toilet if you want. Go to the bar and buy a whiskey.
Go to the drunk next to the bathroom wall and give him the whiskey. he'll
give you the remote control. Get the rose too. Go back into the bar and
knock on the big door.. when he asks you for the password.. tell him
"Ken sent me", Then enter. Turn on the T.V. with the remote. Keep changing
channels until you find a channel he likes.. he'll move from the stairs.
Climb up and voila! The prostitute. Don't hop into bed with her until you get
the rubber. You just need the candy on the bench. Get it. Go out the window,
and go to the fire-escape ladder. You'll fall into a dumpster. Search it and
get the hammer. Exit the dumpster and go left. Call a cab at the street.

  Now go to the casino and go through the lobby. Get the card in the ashtray.

Now gamble a bit until you have about 250 dollars. Go outside. Sometime in the

game when outside the casino, a guy in a barrel will come up and ask you to
buy an apple. Buy it. Call the cab.. tell him to go to the Store. Enter the
store and buy a rubber. Also get the cheap wine in the back.(Never enter the
cab with the wine.. the cabbie will get drunk and kill you) Pay for the wine
and exit.. wait for the russian looking guy to come from the left.(Ignore
the dog) When he comes, give him the wine.. not money. Once you have the knife

go right and show the pass to the Bouncer at the disco door. Go in and sit
down at the table with the lady. Smile and give her the ring, the candy, and
the rose. Ask her to dance. When you finish off with the dancing ask her to

marry you. She'll ask you for 100$. Give it to her and meet her at the marrage

chapel. It's east of the casino front. Enter and go up to the front. Type
"marry", and you'll get married. Go up to the honeymoon suite.( fourth floor,
door with the heart.) Knock, and enter. She'll be on the bed, and "Not in the
Mood!?!" Turn on the radio and listen to it. You'll get a number to call to
get the wine delivered that she wants. Go to the casino and get some taxi fare

money. Go to the fone in front of the store, call the number and have them
deliver it to the "honeymoon suite". If they say it probably won't show up,
you screwed up on the typing. Go back to the casino and go to the suite.
Be sure that you have the knife. Enter and pour the wine. Things will take
they're course and you'll find yourself tied to the bed.( The Bitch! ) Use
the knife and free yourself. Get the rope and leave. Go to the casino again
and using some saving, use the dollar and get about 50$. Once you have it, go
to the bar and Knock on the door again. Go up the stairs and screw her now
that you have the rubber. Remove the rubber after you've used it. Go out the
window and this time go to the right of the balconey. Tie the rope to your-
self and tie it to the railing. Type "Go window" or something so your hanging
infront of the window on the right. Break the glass with the hammer. Get
the pills. Pull on the rope and untie yourself. Go down the fireescape and
call a cab again. Go to the casino and go to the eighth floor.. Talk to the
lady at the desk untill the game tells you that you'll need some medicine or
something. Give her the pills. She'll run off and leave the desk unguarded.
Push the button and enter the open doors on the right.

	FINALLY, THE FINISH...

Enter and go up and right. When you're in the room with the bed, open the
closet door. Enter it and type, "look". Get the doll... then wait as you run
after it. When you're near the hottub, enter it. Look at the lady. Smile, and
give her the apple. Things will then run they're course, and Voila! You have
finished the adventure!

LEISURE SUIT LARRY II
** Complete Solve

You start out outside Eve's house. You recall Eve (if you played the
first game): she's the one you thought was going to be your perfect match.
Naturally it didn't turn out that way (you know all about this if you managed
to sit through the opening sequence).

Anyway, she doesn't really want anything to do with you (hmmf!), and in fact
she's pretty much thrown you out, with not a penny in your pocket. So, the
first thing to do (as even the manual will tell you) is to go into the garage,
maneuver Larry to where you can't see him, and get the dollar bill that's
tucked away in a pair of jeans. Now you're ready for fame and fortune.

Leave the garage, go all the way north to Krod Studios, then due east to the
Quikie Mart. Buy a lottery ticket, entering any six numbers you please; they
won't be the right ones, but it won't matter. The soda machine comes later, so
don't touch it now.

Ok, back to Krod Studios, and enter this time. Show your ticket to the pretty
but not especially bright receptionist. Get your pen ready, and write down the
six numbers she mentions as being the winning numbers. This is cheating, of
course, but it's a mean world out there, and you won't get much further in the
game if you're honest. Now, when she asks for your numbers, tell her the ones
she just gave you. How about that, you're a winner!

She opens the green room for you to wait in, so just have a seat when you
enter.
A rather interesting person will come by eventually and hustle you off to a TV
show, although it's not the one you expected: The Dating Connection. If you
thought the receptionist was bad, this is worse.

No matter, just sit there (try not to be sick) and type in whatever you want
when it's your turn to say something. When the show is over, you will be the
lucky winning bachelor (but say...do you REALLY want to be alone for a month
with Barbara??), and have a cruise ticket handed to you. Wait again in the
green room, and shortly afterward you'll be on the lottery program.

Note that almost all of this is automatic; except for the two times when you
say something on Dating Connection, Larry is operated entirely by the program.
So for the most part you just sit there and watch, which isn't all that bad,
at
least you can't screw up (grin).

Ok! Larry spins the wheel and wins the big one, a million dollars a year for
life! Not bad for someone who just spent his last dollar (and lied about his
lottery numbers). So where is he going to spend all that loot? Not to mention,
where is he going to get change for a million dollar bill?

Why, at Molto Lira of course. Head for this appropriately-named store, and buy
the one thing Larry can afford, namely a bathing suit. Fortunately, the clerk
can change your million-dollar bill, so you will be able to buy a few other
things you need.

Once that transaction is complete, return to Eve's house. If you're going on a
trip, you're going to need your passport. The garage is shut now (good thing
you
found the money earlier), but there is a load of trash out front. Search in
that, and you'll find your passport. Messed up your suit a bit, but who cares?
You're on your way to a big vacation.

Hanging on to your passport, trek on back to the Qmart, where you can now
purchase a grotesque gulp. I don't recommend that you drink it now; your
bladder will have some problems. After that, head south to the drug store, and
move to the middle shelf on the far left. Get the sunscreen and pay for it. We
don't want Larry coming down with sunburn under the hot tropic sun.

As long as you're in the vicinity, head on over to the barber, who will do
wonders for your hair (it's a wonder you still have some!). After paying him
for doing nothing, move along back to the music store, which is now open (how
about that) and enter. Make casual quasi-Spanish chat with the clerk, who
gives
you a strange musical instrument called an "onklunk". Good thing Larry can't
read the subtitles like you can!

This part of the game now moves into automatic, as you see what happens after
Larry leaves the store. Hmmm...looks like Larry could be in for some trouble,
what with the KGB and the Henchettes on his tail. Better be careful around the
pretty girls, Larry.

All right! Once the auto-sequence ends, just make your way over to the port
(the lower-right hand part of the map where the gate is) and show your ticket
to the man standing behind it. Everything's in order, and you're on your way
to
a glorious vacation! (suuuuuuure)

So here you are on the beautiful cruise ship. Well...when you see all those
stairs you know you'll be climbing, maybe not so beautiful. Anyway, head right
into your cabin (maybe cubbyhole would be a better term; these freebies ain't
all they're cracked up to be).

On the table in back is a basket of fruit. Take that, then open the door in
the
right-hand wall. Who could be on the other side? Lovely bachelorette Barbara?
Well, not quite. There's a Bimbo in there, but it's Mrs. Bimbo, Barbara's
mother (chatting with her may explain Barbara). This is not a woman you want
to
get intimate with (especially if you take a look in her closet).

When she's finished talking, go back to your room, walk around it a little
bit,
then return to her room. She should be gone now. If she isn't, leave and come
back a little later. Once the room is empty, head for the nightstand and open
it. Inside is Mother's sewing kit. Grab that and hurry out (because she could
come back at any time, and you DON'T wanna be there when she does. Larry may
be
a bit of a masochist, but not that much!).

Back in your own room, change clothes. You're now wearing that expensive
bathing suit (hmm..Larry doesn't look too bad in it..wonder where he got that
tan?). Head for the pool. There's one deck chair left, but before you sit in
it, Larry would be wise to apply some sunscreen. Ah, that's better.

While Larry lounges in the chair, a beautiful woman arrives and gives him a
big
come-on. Rather suspicious, isn't it? If Larry is smart (or if he isn't, you
should be), he won't go trailing after that luscious babe (oh, all right, save
the game and then follow her, just to see what happens).

Instead, take a dip in the pool. Remember to type "swim" as soon as Larry hits
the water, or he'll drown. Move him to about the middle of the pool, then type
either "go underwater" or "dive" (this is the only place you can do this). You
may want to save the game first, as there is only a limited amount of time
down
below.

When swimming down, don't stop for anything or to take a look around. Just
head
right for the bottom, get the bikini top, and reverse direction. Keep your
finger on the arrow key until the scene changes. Whew! Just made it! Now, swim
over to the ladder and climb out. Walk carefully around the pool, and go back
to your room.

After another change of clothes, climb on over to the barber. This one is a
little better than the last...at least you get something for your money, the
very latest in hairstyles: a mop wig. Just what you've always wanted. It'll
really come in handy when you have your own cable channel.

From there make the long trip up to the nightclub. While you may be dying for
a
drink, dying is what you'll be if you order one. The bartender is actually a
KGB agent, just waiting to get you in his clutches. So, just mosey on over to
the left end of the bar and grab the spinach dip (always refer to this as dip,
not spinach).

You're doing pretty well here. It's about time to leave this luxury cruise
tho.
After all, it's hardly safe with all these secret agents running around. Take
the stairs to the bridge. Very carefully, walk over to the lever on the
machine
in the middle of the room. Pull the lever. Do NOT walk any further forward or
try to leave by the other door at the far end. This will have rather
unpleasant
consequences (of course, you can always save and find out what they are).

Larry has just started the lifeboat timer, so he'd better hurry on over to the
lifeboat deck. Note that once on the deck, he won't be able to leave (at least
not the way he came), so check to make sure he has everything he needs before
going up there. Move him over to the safety chain, and jump into the boat.

Now comes the tricky part. Watch as the lifeboats are lowered. As soon as
Larry's boat hits the water, type in: Wear wig (the ONLY place you can put it
on), followed by: wear sunscreen, and then: throw dip overboard (you really
don't want this with you later).

After this, everything goes back to automatic again. As long as you have all
the items you need, Larry will survive his stay on the ocean. The game will
inform you (as time passes) of what's being used.

Eventually, a storm will arrive and toss Larry off to the shores of a
beautiful
resort island. Does this mean Larry's luck has taken a turn for the better?

How about that, Larry actually managed to survive everything, even sand in the
face! Then again, when you find out what's coming next, you may wish Larry had
drowned out there after all.

From your starting point on the beach, there are three ways to go (you can
ignore the umbrellas, by the way). To the right is a nest of KGB agents, and
you aren't ready for them yet. A good place to avoid.

To the left is the nude beach. Trudge over that way to see what's there (naked
people, of course, what else would you expect?). One of the women seems to be
really interested in you. Again, highly suspicious! I wouldn't trust this one,
whether she's nude or clothed. When she tells you to follow her, just wait
until she's entirely off the screen, and a little longer besides. Then go in
that direction, which brings you back where you started. Now comes the dull
part.

South of the beach is a jungle. You will have to go through it a total of
eight
times (or more, if you make a mistake, so don't make any mistakes). I suggest
having a book handy so you can read while you travel through the jungle. This
part is again automatic: you just sit there while Larry wanders around the
screen looking for an exit.

The first time, watch carefully, until Larry is close to the bush in the
middle
of the screen. As soon as he is, type: "get flower" (the one in the pot under
the tree is a red herring and you can't get that one). This is the only
important thing you need do. Having done that, you can open your book (War and
Peace is a good choice) and just read it while you wait for Larry to find a
way
out. Of course, you can also watch Larry's antics on the screen. They're
pretty
cute...the first time. However, they never change on subsequent visits, so you
might as well stick with your book.

The first place Larry finds is a snooty restaurant. Talk to the maitre d', who
will have you sit and wait while he takes other people to their tables (you
have to sit through this five times...boring). Eventually the maitre d' will
get around to you. A special folding table is set up right near the kitchen
door (choice location). There is food on the table, but I don't recommend
eating it.

Instead, meander over to the buffet and get the knife. That's all you need
from
this place, so you can leave as soon as you have it. Of course, you're back in
the jungle again; a good time to resume your reading.

Eventually, Larry comes out into a guest room. A maid appears soon after, to
inquire if everything is all right. If you say no, she'll ask if you want
something that isn't on the room service menu. She means herself. You can have
a romp in the bed with her, but I advise against it. Her brother Carlos, and
his gun, will turn up while you're enjoying her charms, at which point it will
be bye-bye Larry.

Just wait until she leaves then pick up the matches from the table and the
soap
from the bathroom. Now you can leave, to wander yet again (lucky fellow!) in
the jungle. This time, you come out at the barber shop (they're all over the
place, aren't they?).

This one is even better than the last. He really makes your hair grow long and
luxurious. So what if you also just turned blonde? Blondes have more fun
anyway
(and isn't Larry having fun?). Time for another trek through the jungle, which
brings you to...the beach where you started. Hmmm..wonder if anything has
changed since last time? Hop over to the nude beach, and you'll see a bikini
bottom on the rock. Ah, now you have a complete suit...wonder what that means?
Let's find out!

Yes, you guessed it...you have to go back through the jungle again (see, i
told
you to read War and Peace!). The restaurant has nothing important, so just
leave it as soon as you enter. When you arrive at the guest house, go around
behind the bathroom and change clothes. My my, don't we look pretty!

However, Larry is somewhat underdeveloped in the upper chest region, and this
will never do. So, "Stuff bikini top with soap". Wow, what a beauty! Gee,
Larry
could almost pass for female now. Except that he's kinda hairy.

Don't worry, the barber will take care of that for you with a total body wax.
Ok, it's a trifle painful, but hey, you want to get out of here, right? Right!
Now that you're properly dressed, stuffed, and waxed, you can just sashay on
by
the admiring KGB agents to the cliffs.

These cliffs look a little formidable. Maybe even a lot formidable. Bet your
hands are shaking already. Well, I'll tell ya: you don't have to worry too
much
about these cliffs. Larry will slip now and then...that's built in and can't
be
avoided. However, he won't fall (but go ahead and save the game if it makes
you
feel more secure).

Now, after you round the last cliff, the game will tell you that Larry pauses
for a breather. As soon as you see that, type in "change clothes". Your getup
may be good enough to fool the dumb KGB agents, but the sharp-eyed guards at
the airport will know better.

Now that you're more like yourself again (in spite of the long blonde hair),
you can walk up to the airport door. However, there are two KGBishna agents
standing in front of it. This is the time to spread some peace and love. Give
your flower to the agents. Overwhelmed, they wander off, leaving you free to
enter the airport.

The first thing you see is a ticket counter and three lines. No matter which
line you stand in, you won't get anywhere. Instead, walk left to the next
room,
where you will find...a barbershop! Not only that, but the barber looks
vaguely
familiar...haven't we seen her somewhere before (something to do with a king's
quest, wasn't it?).

Anyway, under her expert ministrations, Larry's long blonde hair is turned
back
into receding dark hair again. To make up for this, she gives Larry a bottle
of
hair rejuvenator. How nice of her...just don't light any matches.

All right, time to buy a plane ticket. Go back past the ticket desk (ignoring
any beautiful women who may approach you) and keep going right to the customs
area. Show your passport to the man at the desk, then continue right through
the gate.

On the other side is the luggage examination area. The inspector is asleep,
however, which gives you the perfect opportunity to snoop through other
people's belongings (haven't you always wanted to do that?). As each piece of
luggage moves in front of you, just say "get suitcase". What you're waiting
for
is the suitcase with the bomb in it. That's right...bomb (as in BOOM).

Don't worry tho, it's not as bad as you think (it's not even worse than you
think, either). Once again, this is an auto-sequence. Enjoy the show as Larry
goes running around with an explosive suitcase, shouting about it to all the
world and everyone else, too. Well, that's one way to buy a ticket.

Which is what you should do, now that the lines are gone. Then return to the
customs area, where you show your passport again, and pass through the gate
again. This time, keep going past the luggage inspection area and you will
come
to the slidewalks.

You'll see a couple of vending machines. One is broken, but the other is
selling flight insurance...in the form of parachutes. It would be a smart move
on Larry's part to buy some flight insurance.

Hey, it's been a long time since you had anything to eat. Why not slip over to
the counter and order the "Blue Pate" special? It's only a buck. Hmmm...makes
you wonder what could be in it, at that price. Better not eat it, after all.
In
fact, why not examine it more carefully...never know what you might find.

How about that, there was a bobby pin lurking in the gravy! Good thing you
decided not to eat that stuff after all. Anyway, now it's time to get to your
plane before it takes off without you. Just get on the slidewalk and you'll be
there in hardly any time at all (almost).

Before you show your ticket to the clerk, look at the counter. There's a stack
of religious pamphlets sitting on it. Go ahead, take one. If nothing else, you
can always use it as bathroom stationery in an emergency (grin).

Now you can board the plane. After making an impression (of the wrong kind) on
the stewardess, Larry makes his way to the next compartment, where he finds
things are a bit of a tight squeeze. Nevertheless, he does manage to get into
his seat (maybe a diet is in order...).

Once the plane has taken off, Larry finds he is stuck next to a bore. Not just
any old kind of bore...a dangerous one. Given enough time, he'll give Larry a
hair job that will fry his brains. Standing up doesn't help; as soon as Larry
is on his feet, stewardesses will roll in drink carts...and roll them out
again
as soon as Larry is back in his seat.

What we need here is a distraction, and that's where the pamphlet comes in
handy. Just give it to the bore, and he will no longer be a problem. With that
taken care of, look at your seat...a convenient barf bag has been thoughtfully
provided by the airlines. Grab that, because it's time to take the long way
out.

Stand up (hah! no more drinks) and head into the smoking compartment. There
are
three doors here, of which only two are visible on the screen. The third
(which
is the exit) is in the lower right portion. Move Larry over to that and wear
the parachute (there won't be time later). The door is not only shut, it is
locked. But that's easy, just "use pin" (hmmm, wonder where Larry learned this
skill?). Then pull the lever and push the door. WHOOOOSH!

As soon as Larry is out of the plane, open the parachute. Whew, that was a
close
one! And so our hero floats merrily to earth, to what appears to be a tropical
island. Has he found paradise at last? (With that volcano in the background,
no
way!).

Of course, Larry ends up tangled in the trees. Still, this is no problem;
that's
why you have a knife. In no time at all, Larry will be free to plummet to the
ground below, losing some of his stuff (like the money...but hey, there's more
where that came from, right?), and smashing his precious onklunk. No matter,
Larry is alive and in one piece, and that's what counts.

Then again, with the trials ahead, possibly Larry might wish he hadn't worn
that parachute. First things first, get the hefty stick that's lying on the
ground; it will be useful later.

Now maneuver Larry carefully over to the bush near the lower left. A swarm of
killer bees is sitting on the bush, and you don't want to disturb them.
There's
no way around, but there's a way under: crawl under the bush. That was pretty
easy, wasn't it? Too bad the rest won't be. It's a good idea to save the game
as you get past each obstacle...just in case.

The next delightful denizen you come across is a hungry anaconda, stretched
out
across the branch of the tree. He's a little hard to see, but take my word for
it, he's really there. Walk carefully under the tree. Right after the box
comes
up that says "maybe he won't notice you", type in "use stick".

Sonuvagun! It worked! The humiliated snake crawls off, leaving you free to
move
on to the next problem, everyone's favorite jungle peril: quicksand. Here you
might want to adjust the speed so that Larry walks slowly. If you look
carefully at the ground, you'll see that there is a line across the quicksand,
which is a different color. Larry has to follow this line over to the end of
the screen. There's no trick here, just careful movement.

Ok! You're almost there (wherever there is). The last thing you have to do is
cross the piranha-filled river (for a laugh, save the game and then plunge
right in). Hey, you've always wanted to play Tarzan, right? It's easy (suure).
Just walk Larry over to the edge of the bank by the rock, so he's near the
sixth vine from the left.

Now, type in "swing vine". As soon as that takes effect, type it again (use
the
F3 key, it's easier). Right after that, type in "release vine"...we don't want
Larry falling into the river after all that hard work. However, before you go
running off to the beach, stand next to the longest vine on the right and get
it. You'll need it later.

So now you can go to the beach, where you find....Larry's true love. Really!
Honest! It's really her. And once again, Larry goes on auto-pilot. Just sit
back
and read the screen as events unfold. Eventually, having proved himself
partially to his love's daddy, Larry gets his big chance: to climb the volcano
and put an end to the evil Dr. Nonookee.

Daddy leaves you the chasm's edge, but you have to go back to the village for
something you need before your assault can begin. Go all the way back to the
first village screen and get ashes from the dying fire. If you have been
wondering, there is nothing important about the woodchopper; he's just a red
herring. The ashes are all you need from here.

Ok, back at the chasm, position Larry carefully at the edge, at about the
middle, and use the vine. It will wrap around the tree branch and Larry can
swing across. Too bad the branch breaks; Larry won't be able to come back this
way, but I'll bet you suspected that anyhow.

Onward and upward! A short trek through a jungle-like area (with nothing
special) and Larry arrives at the glacier. This is no sweat (considering
you're
surrounded by ice, sweating would be difficult); move to the middle of the
screen, just below the ice, and use the ashes. Larry will continue to do this
and he will climb up to the top and beyond.

After this is a pathway with steep cliffs on both sides. Walking up is
actually
easy, as long as you aren't careless. Just don't try flying, because you
can't.
And there, at last, is the top of the volcano! Complete with mysterious
elevator.
No, you can't get in there....yet!

First you have to cause some underground disturbance. Checking your inventory,
you see that all Larry has left is the barf bag, rejuvenator, and matches. Not
much, but just enough to do the job. Provided you can get around the
weirdities
(not to mention stupidity) of the parser.

Here's what you have to do: first get Larry over to the left side of the big
hole, just in front of the rock. This is the only place he can do anything.
Now (are you ready for this? probably not): say "put matches and bag in
bottle". You MUST say that, or else it won't work. The matches don't actually
go into the bottle, only the bag does. However, if you try just putting the
bag
alone in there, the program screws up and Larry dumps the bottle by itself
into
the fissure. So, make sure you say "matches and bag".

All right, light the bag and drop the bottle into the fissure. Move Larry over
to the elevator and inside when it opens. After that, sit back and
relax...this
is the end of the game (a rather protracted ending) and from here on in Larry
goes through his paces with no help from you. However, at least it's a happy
ending! Really! Leisure Suit Larry finds love at last...in the right place!

Or type FREIBIERIC and the screen will flash and tell you you have
discovered the secret of Leonardo, giving you unlimited lives.

LIGHT CORRIDOR
First a little hint: The green diamonds are essential as these award you
with an extra life. Some of the red diamonds will allow control over two
bats but this is more of a hinderence as the two bats prove confusing.
Avoid the blue squares as they will shrink the size of your bat.

LOST PATROL
Keeping up your men's strength and morale is vital. Giving your men
50 minutes' rest a night, or during the day when it's too dark to
carry on, will slam your energy and morale levels to max. Even if
you don't have much food, you don't have to worry, as your men will
not eat it.
On reaching the first village (the first white cross on the map),
search the area to find a hole in the ground where the villagers
appear to be hiding. You then have two options: ENTER TUNNEL or
USE GRENADES. Gomez is useful at this point, but if he is dead, go
for the USE GRENADES option.
Start off questioning the villagers normally by aking them "Where
VC?" Once you have an answer, start the hard questioning, or a
village boy will get hold of a gun and shoot one of your men...
^E
LOTUS ESPRIT TURBO CHALLENGE
During a two player game type player one's name as FIELDS OF FIRE and
player two's as IN A BIG COUNTRY.  This eliminates the lead to qualify in
the Top Ten and allows you to crawl around the track at a much safer speed.

Also, try entering the names as 'Monster'(player 1) and 'Seventeen'(player
two) for a surprise.

MIGHT & MAGIC II
To earn lots of experience make a backup of your original play disk.
Now boot and insert the disk that contains your characters.  Save them onto
your second backup by going to the inn.  Buy three tickets and try to win in
all three arenas.  Remember to save after each victory. Once you have a
victory in each arena, go to the castle where the bishop is held captive.
Before entering flick the write protect tab to protect your disk.  Then enter
and free the  bishop with the correct key.  He will give you experience if
you have won three fights  of the same color.  Exit and go to town.  Open
write protect tab and save at the inn.  You can repeat as often as you like.

Some more hints:

Red Message Decoded
To right ancient wrongs, the solution is very long.
The Triple Crown must first be done with Arena, Monster Bowl and Colosseum
to be won.
Next, the party must split individually so that each may fulfill their
personal destiny.
Request an audience with the Queen so the Chosen one can be seen.
Travel through time with Talons and Orb. Save the dead King from destruction
and get the password.
Then visit the lake geometric to find passage to that which you must
hurriedly
fix. JVC
Green Message Decoded
For each individual to become true, see the jury which resides at Mount
Farview.  Travel in groups of appropriate class.  A Robber can aid all
others with their tasks.
Yellow Message Decoded
If Personal statistics you'd like to enhance, with circus games you should
take a chance.  Win dumb prizes, but don't feel bad. You can offer these toys

to an old man who can be had.  His hut in the wilderness is dwarfed by a
tree.
For the toy, he gives you a tip for free.  Drink from the Inner Limits pool.

Though once it was acid, now it is cool.  With thirst now thoroughly sated,
go back to the Circus and play games to raise those statistics which you
truly
hated.

 This by no means all of the locations or items in this game !

MONTY PYTHON
Type SEMPRIMI on the high-score table to start on the level you died on.

    MUNICION - Boost your ammo to 200
    NOAMETZ# - Turn off the machine guns. Put the number of the sector
               where the # is.
    NOCAMZ#  - Turn back on the machine guns. Remember the sector number.
    NOENEMIG - Get rid of the enemies.
    COMENZAR - Bring them back if the game gets boring.
    ABRIR    - Open any security door.

^E
NAVY MOVES
786169 takes you to part two of the game.
^E
NEBULUS
Type  HELLOIAMJMP  on the title page.  This gives you unlimited Pogos, and
you can go to each of the eight unfinished towers by hitting a F-Key.  You
can do the same with the second group by accepting the second mission before
typing in the password.

NEVERMIND
At the main screen type 328GTS.  A message, 'cheat now on steve', will

NEUROMANCER
When you first begin, sell all your body parts. You can get along just fine
without them for now,  and it gives you enough to get a half way decent deck.

You will eventually need to buy them back before you start entering
cyber-space, or you will be killed easily.

OVERLANDER
Just a few tips - When cruising the highway don't stop shooting, and always
choose the highest paid mission.  Buy fuel carefully - only enough for that
level, after level 1 you MUST buy a leanburner.  Try to stay in the middle of
the road and travel fast, travelling slowly only burns more fuel.  Fire bombs
are more useful than smart bombs when you learn how to use them.
Bulletproofing is necessary after level 2.  When travelling through the
barriers the best speed is 90-120mph.

PACLAND
While loading, type AVALON. The screen will freak out. This is normal. You
now
have infinite lives!  Also, during round two, push the third cactus you come
to, and you will be invincible for that round only. On round one, push the
third fire hydrant, and the baby ghosts won't be able to harm you. In the
forest, push the first log you find, and it will release balloons (worth
extra
points!). On level three, push the first log and it will warp you through the
level!  Another way to get `infinite lives' is to:  Start a two player game.
Kill player one. On the screen right after you get your magic boots push the
third cactus and an extra man will appear. Get it. Now kill player two.
Continue play with player one and every time he dies get the extra man with
player two. As long as you do this, player one will never die.

Also try this...
Level 1 - In  the  one  player  mode,  run to the right, and when
you get to the third  fire hydrant, jump over it and push it to
the left.  This will give you a blue hard hat which protects you
from falling ghosts.
Level 2 - On  this  level,  go  right, and when you've jumped
over the third cactus,  push it to the left.  This will make you
invincible for the rest of the level.
Level 3 - At the end of this level you will be given a pair off
magic boots.  On the  way  back,  push  the  cactus  on the edge
of the lake to make a big yellow Pacman appear, then collect it
for an extra life.
- Jump on the roof of the approaching ghosts' cars to escape.
- Only collect power pills when ghosts are in range, otherwise,
it's wasted.
- When you approach the Breaktime sign, jump about one inch away
from it to receive the maximum bonus.

Complete Walkthrough:

 New Phlan
	In the town of New Phlan, you cannot camp out on the street, so
 don't try it. Locate the shop at 11-12 to change your gold pieces into
 platinum. You can then stay at the Inn at 4-12. There is a Jewelry shop
 at 8-10 where you can exchange heavy gold for light jewelry. Visit the
 taverns at 8-9 to pick up gossip and gain experience. Visit the hiring
 hall and hire whatever help you deem necessary (7-2). Finally, visit the
 city clerk at 5-5 who will give you your mission.

 The Slums
	The first few blocks will encounter a Goblin Armsmaster. Use a
 detect magic spell after you defeat them to detect their treasure. There
 is an illusionary wall at 0-0 with treasure behind it. Meet Ohlo at 13-10
 and he will ask you for a potion. Go to 15-12 to get the potion, return it,
 and you will be paid. Be careful with the trolls and ogres at 0-14. If
 you have mapped the block completely and had about 15 random encounters,
 the mission is completed.

 Sokol Keep
	Return to the city and rest. Collect you reward from the clerk and
 you will be sent on you next mission; the keep. Go to the docks and book
 passage. Outside the main gate are the bones of some elves with a scroll
 6-13. The words on the scroll translate to LUX, SHESTNI, and SAMOSUD. Enter
 the keep and use the word Shestni to keep the undead away. After turning or
 killing off several patrols, you should be allowed to rest in peace. Enter
 the room 8-5 north of the Alter room and be prepared to fight. Use sleep
 spells on the archers and as many of the front ranks as possible. Proceed
 to the alter 7-9 and a specter will materialize. Use the word LUX to talk
 with him. Tell him about the state of the city and he will give you useful
 information about a secret treasure room (northwest corner of the armory
  15-0). There is another illusionary wall at 15-2. In another room,
 6-2 use the word LUX again and you should be told about more treasure.
 The keep is considered cleared once you have told Martinez the truth.
 Once you are satisfied, return to the town and train for higher levels.

 Podol Plaza
	Next, you should get a commission to attend an auction in Polol
 Plaza. Disguise yourself and head for the center of the block 7-4. Listen
 for information then leave. Return to clear the block in particular the
 textile house. There is a temple at 2-15 that is helpful in healing wounds.
 The only thing of value in the plaza is the bar called The Pit where magic
 items can often be won. Podol Plaza is considered cleared after 10 random
 encounters. Return to the town for you training and your next mission.

 Textile House
	Your next commission will come personally from one of the councilmen.
 Another adventurer was sent to the councilmans textile house to recover his
 treasure but he never made it back; you are to rescue him. First, visit the
 well in the northwest section 0-3. It is difficult to climb down except for
 thieves. It is the headquarters for the thieves guild. The guild master will
 take you via tunnels to another well inside the textile house compound 5-11.
 Enter the first building 3-11 and kill the priestess and get her key. Use it
 to free the missing adventurer. He will join you and help you find the
 treasure located at 11-14 in a secret door. Take the box back to the thieves
 guild. The guild master will open it, help you steal some of the contents,
 and reseal it. Return the box to Cadorna and he will reward you. Defeating
 the ogre leader and having 10 random encounters clears the area.

 Mantor's Library
	Head for the library and use a knock spell to open it. Search
 through the books and you will find many useful. The book of health for
 instance is worth 25,000 gold pieces. Kill the basilisk at 5-4 before he
 can turn anyone to stone. You might also have trouble with a spectre
 librarian. Use a dispel to hurt him then finish him off.

 Temple of Bane
	You will be sent to the Temple of Tyr who will request that you
 clear the Temple of Bane across the river. Take a boat over to the
 wealthy area and fight your way through the mansion. There is hidden
 treasure in almost every room. Pay attention when you slay followers
 of Bane. Take the leather symbol from their bodies. The symbol will
 allow you to pass the blind orc at the temple entrance. Search the
 interior of the temple for treasure. Eventually, you will be attacked
 by Mace. Kill him and destroy the alter. The temple is now considered
 cleared.

 Kovel Mansion
	North of the wealthy area is Kovel Mansion. Explore the mansion
 being careful to avoid traps and ambushes. Take you time and explore the
 rooms. You cannot rest until the thieves have been cleared. After clearing
 Kovel, head back to the town for some rest in the inn. Sell off all the
 heavy gold and treasure.

 The Wilderness
	Take a boat to the west to pick up the silver dragon 10-9. He will
 send you to a kobold cave due east to find a silver bottle. On the way
 to the cave you will encounter nomads at 12-11. Join them in fighting off
 the Kobold attackers. Next, locate the cave at 6-15 and take the left
 entrance. Search through the cave until you find the throne room of the
 king. You will be attacked by several waves of monsters. Use Continue
 Combat between rounds to heal. Chase the king after defeating his monsters
 and he should do away with himself. You will find the bottle your looking
 for at 12-0. It is brass and not silver. The bottle contains an Efreeti who
 will ask you some questions. Answer him and he will help you later. Leave
 the cave and follow the river north to the sorcerer's island 6-16. Search
 around Lake Kuto and you will find a rowboat. Row across the lake to the
 island and enter the pyramid. Inside is a long hall with two doors. One
 of the doors leads to a room with a transporter. You can throw stones into
 it to make it reset. Move down the hall, turn right at the intersection
 and go to the end of the hall to find another transporter. Throw a stone
 and teleport. Repeat this until the third floor. Read the password over
 the door NOKNOK and move through it. Break the machinery and run out of
 the room. Re-enter the room and you will find some lizard men. Paralyze
 them and talk to them to get their word SAVIOR. Search until you find Yarash
 and his guard. Kill them and find another teleporter. The first three
 settings on this one will teleport you to a treasure room and back. The
 final setting will send you back to the main level. The pyramid is
 considered cleared after defeating Yarash and destroying the machinery. Use
 the friend word you learned and enter the keep  in the eastern wilderness
 at 11-8. Dual the chieftan for control of the tribe and, after winning, the
 tribe will pledge not to trouble you. Next, rescue the young heir at 12-31
 who has been captured by Buchaneers. Finally, go to the Zhentil Keep. You
 will be given rooms for the night to stay there. Stay awake because you
 will be attacked during the night. Escape out the front gate if possible
 as early as you can. This will fulfill the mission.

 The Graveyard
	Having exposed the councilman for being a traitor, you will be
 given a mission to kill him. First, go back to the graveyard and try
 to clear it. Use protection from evil and prayer spells before dangerous
 encounter areas 10-11 1-13. Use dispel to defeat the various specters and
 monsters. Refuse the help of the magic user you encounter here. You will
 eventually locate the vampire. There is a secret entrance through a wall
 at 15-1. Kill him and go to his crypt at 12-3 where you can finish him off.
 Keep in mind that you can leave the graveyard to rest and heal.

 The Gate
	Storm the Stojanow gate and use the knock spell to eventually open
 it. Once the gate has been cleared, guards from Phlan will hold it open.

 Valjevo Castle
	Head for Tyranthaxus's castle. The first section you enter will be
 the southwest section. Go to the laundry room at 12-13 and disguise
 yourself to avoid the patrols. There is a smithy at 3-14 from whom armor
 can be stolen. Kill the priest and take his necklace. Each bead is a
 fireball spell. Continue into the southeast section where you will find
 gates to the castle 12-8 and Cadorna 14-11. Free him and he will give the
 password for you to get through the castle gates. Once through the gates,
 use the maps you found earlier to get through the hedge maze. Go north to
 the northeast part then to the northwest. You will see a backdoor to the
 tower and next to it, an illusionary wall with stairs. Avoid the room with
 the trap door. Talk to the messengers who work for Genheeris and you can
 find him in his office and kill him. You can then go into Ty's lair where
 he will be in dragon form. Defeat him and you've won the game.

QUADRALIEN
Access codes: level 1- 170961, level 2- 010655, level 3- 610169.  And now,
some tips: once in the core, you can't quit. So choose droids with good
lasers, Jack and Spud for example. The Quadralien mother is made up of 4
separate pieces grouped together and surrounded by Earthling boxes.  The
mother can only be destroyed by blowing up each box from a different
direction.  From the starting point there are three exits: north, east, and
west. Go east and destroy the first box, return to the starting point,  and
go north to destroy the second box. You will now have both droids to blow
the remaining boxes. Go west through the one-way force field, and get the
other.
Don't forget to keep recharging.
^E
R-TYPE
Enter 'SUMITA' on the high score table for unlimited lives.

(2nd cheat)

Load the game; when you get the "insert disk 2 and press space" prompt,
press HELP and type ME, then press the up arrow (between INSERT and CLR
HOME).  Now insert disk 2 and press space.  While playing the game, you can
become impervious to collisions (F5), impervious to enemy fire (F6), get
infinite credits (F7), and put the orb in the control of a second player with
a stick plugged in the mouse port (F8).  Neat!

^E
RAINBOW ISLANDS
Type these codes on the title page:
BLRBJSBJ - Fast Feet
RJSBJSBR - Double Rainbows
SSSLLRRS - Faster Rainbows
BJBJBJRS - Displays hint
LJLSLBLS - Displays another nint
SJBLRJSR - Unknown
LBSJRLJL - Continue on all rounds

We all know that collecting the seven different-colored gems gives you an
extra life and a 100,000 Bonus Gem once the Boss is defeated.
But collecting all of the gems in the correct order of color (from left to
right on the gem counter) not only awrds you the life and Bonus Gem, it also
grants you access to a magical secret room. When you reach the end of the
level, a silver door appears. `You don't have to fight the Boss. (Hint A)

Even more useful is how to create any color gem. The screen is split into
several invisible vertical stripes of color. When a gem falls, its color is
determined by the `color' of the area into which it fell. Now all you have to
do is guage carefully where the dead enemy will fall to create the gem color
of your choice. (Hint B )

Complete Walkthrough:

 Go all the way to the left until you reach the guy who is being captured
 by a gargoyle. Shoot the gargoyle until it releases him. Ask the man
 about: Traps. The man will tell you wither upper switch or lower switch.
  Go down through the branches and make the first left into this tunnel.
 As soon as you see a gargoyle fly over, follow it to the rope and kill
 it. Once you kill it, wait at the edge of the tunnel facing left and
 wait for the guy pushing the stone. When the guy nears the edge, start
 shooting at him and you can kill him.
  Go left into the tunnel until the drive spins. When it stops, you
 should see a gargoyle flying over. Kill it, take the key he throws, and
 continue left. Ignore the next gargoyle, go up the rope and jump to the
 right. Use the key to open the iron door and continue right until you
 reach the wall with two switches.
  Hit which ever switch the man told you to earlier and an elevator will
 come down. Get inside and it will take you back to the surface.
  Go right until you get to the chain. Get on the chain and climb part of
 the way down until you see a sleeping gargoyle. Climb back up the chain
 and jump against the wall where you fall straight down into the pit. Act
 quickly here. Once you land, turn around, fire a quick shot or two, make
 a short jump, and while in the air, fire as many shots as you can. If you
 succeed, the gargoyle will not be able to hit the lever on the wall. Once
 the gargoyle flies away, hit the lower lever, jump on the chain, and exit
 the pit.
  Once out of the pit, go right to the second chain. Go up the chain and
 jump to the upper ledge. Shoot the chest and get the gold coins. The coins
 only stay for a few seconds so pick them up quickly. For the rest of the
 game, repeat this when you see a chest.
  Now, jump down and go right again and pick up a key on the far table at
 the end of the hallway. Go  all the way left and get back into the elevator.
 Push down on the joystick.
  Once you get to the bottom, go left, down the rope, and keep going left
 until you find two pits of acid. One of them should have a bridge across
 it. Keep going left and you will find a wall with three switches on it
 and a large stone. Do not break the stone with your mace. Use the switches
 to move and lower the hook over the top part of the rock. Once it is
 fastened on the rock, lift the rock and move it to the right. Use the top
 switch to release the rock and drop it on the other side of the exposed
 acid pool. The rock will land on a spike and break.
  Push the fragments of the rock up to the left side of the see-saw. Climb
 the rock almost 3/4 of the way up and jump to the right. If you succeed,
 the rock will fly up. Run quickly to the left and get in the elevator. The
 elevator will take you up.
  Go left and you will find a dragon. Kill the dragon and shoot the hanging
 sack. The released prisoner will tell you a password you will need. Go
 right, down the branches, then go right all the way down the hallway to
 the entrance of the tunnel.
  When you reach the rope, go down and jump right. When you get to a hole
 in the ground with branches in it, go down. Then, go right again. You will
 reach a stone gate and you will be asked for a password. Type in the
 password whispered to you earlier by the prisoner.
  Once you enter, go up the rope and you will meet Barloom, a good dragon.
 He has a parchment in front of him that contains a spell. Take it then
 back track. Go down the rope and go to the right get the coins from the
 chest. Go left and leave.
  When you get out, go back up the branches and go left. Cross the acid
 pool and keep going left. When you come to the large monster, just keep
 hitting him until he falls into the acid. Keep going left and you will meet
 another one. Repeat the process, continue left, and you will find your
 third chest.
  When you reach the Oasis, go inside, left, up the stairs, and get the
 jug. Exit and go all the way back to where the game started you off.
	Go right until you get back to the pygmies. Cross their forest
 and keep going right until you get to the place where there is a rock
 above the ground. Right under the rock, on the ground, you will see a
 thin green piece of grass that covers the entrance to the crystal caverns.
 Continue right until you get to the rocks that progress like steps. Jump
 from one to the other going up and to the left as you jump, until you
 find the green monster.
  Kill the monster and he will drop an axe. Get the axe but don't use it.
 You will be carrying too many things at this point so put the arrow on the
 parchment, and then pick up the axe. Then, get the coins out of the chest.
  Go up the little rope, jump over to the rock, and go up on the ledge.
 Break down the green column with your mace. Go right and get the coins
 out of the chest. Now, go back down to the entrance of the caverns.
  Get on top of the layer of grass covering the entrance and keep jumping
 until you break through. Go down into the hole and you will be asked to
 switch disks. Once you are in the caverns, go left and you will find the
 last chest.
  Stop going left when you reach the right edge of the stone bridge. Switch
 you weapon from mace to axe but don't use it yet. Run left and don't stop
 until a stone wall drops and stops you. Follow the little goblin who starts
 to run and when the wall comes down, start firing the axe at the goblin
 retracting the bridge. Once you kill the top goblin, kill the one directly
 behind the wall. Remember the axe only lasts a few seconds. Use you mace to
 break down the wall and get through.
  Once you get through the outer defenses, go left then go to the chain that
 leads upward and go up it. Go left across the hallway until you reach a
 locked door. Kneel and use your mace to hit the lever on the other side
 of the door. Run back across the hallway, go down, and then go down the
 other chain into a room with goblins. Go right and get the key on the
 table. Go left and allow yourself to be captured by walking under the cage
 above the ground.
  Once captured, you will be led to a cell and locked up. Offer the jug to
 the guard and he will take it and fall asleep. Break the door down with your
 mace. As soon as the door breaks, jump on the chain and climb up and kill the
goblin guard at the top.
  Once you kill the guard, you will see a prisoner come behind you and he
 will jump on the ledge and start pulling on the door. Go back down and kill
 the sleeping guard. Get the key from him, go back up and free the prisoner
 from the cell above yours.
  Go all the way up the chain and you should see both prisoners waiting in
 front of the door. First, jump left, then, go left and get the ring. Go
 back to where the prisoners are, move the arrow the last key, and push
 the button. The door will open and both prisoners will start running.
 Run right next to the first prisoner, so that you can barely see him, so
 he can't be killed. The second one is not needed. At the end of the
 hallway, he will disappear.
  Once you get to the end of the hallway, keep going right and leave the
 crystal cavern. Once you get back to the surface, go back up and get the
 parchment you left their earlier. Go right, to the rope, and go down the
 rope and onto the stone in the waterfall. Jump right, on the stones and
 kill the monster on the third one. When you jump from the third stone,
 there will be two small stones next to each other. The first one is a
 creature so don't jump on it. Jump on the second stone and then jump
 to the rope and climb up.
  Cross over the strip of land and get to the second rope. Climb down
 the rope and half way down, jump right to land again. You will come to
 a bridge. On the other side of the bridge is a guy with a sword. Lure him
 to your side of the bridge and when he gets to the weak spot of the bridge,
 it will collapse. Jump over the hole and go to the right and greet the old
 man.
  Offer the ring and the parchment to the old man and he will make you a
 weapon. Pick up the weapon, go back to the bridge, and fall through the
 hole. After you go through the whirlpool, you will be in a new place.
  Go all the way right, fall down, and keep going right and pick up the
 horn. Go down the rope and jump right. Go right until you get to the
 snail and ask him about: Karamoon. He will ask you if you want to go
 their and tell you it will cost 36 coins. Say yes. He will take you back
 to the surface and leave you where the old man used to be.
  Go right and use the mace to kill the two guys with shields. Keep going
 right and fall off the edge into the swamps. Keep going right past the
 tree trunk with the snakes. Continue all the way to the edge of the land.
 Point to the horn and hit the button and a sea monster will appear. Climb
 on its back and it will take you across the channel to an island. Jump
 off onto the island and go to the castle and enter. 	Go into the castle
 and go all the way right. You will find the mage. Kill the mage with
 the weapon given to you by the old man and you've won.

SHADOW WARRIORS
During the intro sequence hold down CTRL, J, ESC, 5, F2, RIGHT ALT (,V,
ENTER, and HELP. In the game hit HELP for next level and Q for
invulnerability to punches and kicks.

NOTE:  the bracket and Enter keys refer to the numeric keypad.

Another cheat:

When you reach the continue option screen and, if after the word credit, it
says 1, start tapping the 1 and 2 keys alternately, all the way through
the change disk prompt until both men fall from the sky. This gives you
infinite lives.

SHOCKWAVE
Hints :

   A few hints and tips follow on how each of the four zones (armies,
   factoriess, mines and rigs) effect the game :

   MINES - Each time a mine is purchased the income you receive for each
           'time pass' doubles.

   FACTORIESS - The more factories you have the faster more weapons are
                produced, these are essential.

   RIGS - These supply you with the fuel for each mission run. The more rigs
          you have the greater the amount of fuel you receive for each
          'time pass'.

   ARMIES - For every army unit you own, the enemy slows down, eg. you have
            one army unit, for each four 'time passes' that occur the enemy
            won't move for one 'time pass'.

   If more than 50% of the sector is occupied by the enemy then you will lose
   one of your assests for each 'time pass' rhat occurs. The best solution is
   when 30% of the sector is occupied go an attack the enemy.

reveal the message:  "Congratulations! you have  found the cheat mode...
unfortunately it has been ZAPPED!".  If this happens goto the control
selection and type "SCRAP 28' and start the game.  You'll now have the same
cheat as mentioned above.
^E
SIM CITY
Hold SHIFT, type FUND and get $10,000.  It will cause an earthquake every
third time, so do it before you start your city.

Another tip is to set the citizen's taxes to 0%.  Then just before tax
collection (December or November if playing at fast speed) quickly set the
taxes up to 20%.  Then after you collect taxes, put it back down to 0%.  This
way the citizens think they are not paying any taxes.

You can build land on water. Find a straight (horizontal or vertical),
stretch of coastline and string a powerline along it. Next, move one
square over, out into the water and string another powerline parallel to
the first. Repeat as many times as you want. Then just
bulldoze all the excess powerlines and you can build on the new land.

To MAKE land you simply make a 3 lane highway across any water source.
When you make a road by putting 3 sections of road on top of three section
of road on top of three sections of road (3 by 3) you make 1 section of
land in the middle.                WWWWW   WWWWW     To make more land, just
                                   WRRRW   WRRRW     move you roads over, or
           L= land                 WRRRW = WRLRW     make your roads 4 by 4,
           W= water                WRRRW   WRRRW     5 by 5 etc.  Play with
           R= road                LLRRRLL LLRRRLLL   it.  It'll work.
                                  LLLLLLL LLLLLLLL

** City Building Hints

The following tips on city building come from long experience on my Amiga. Each
city has taught me a great deal and playing the scenarios has helped test new
theories. I wish someone had told me some of this stuff when I was getting
started.

In general, there are no lies in the User's Guide and the basic guidelines
mentioned so briefly form the framework of the Sim City legal system. I
subscribe to the victory criteria for a good city as stated in the user
documentation and have firmed that up as follows:

  My victory criteria for a good city:

   Happy people, 10% or less on all complaints.

   Low taxes, 6-7% taxes, (adds challenge, but speeds growth) but still a
   positive cash flow (even if I started with a gigabuck).

   Visually pleasing (Tends to limit population to 250-300,000. Going for max
   population is a challenge but the resulting city is uninteresting.

   Complete police and fire protection

To build a good city, one needs the right mind set. "Sims are not people, they
are tax payers". You're running a business here with a need to meet customer
wants (Quality service) at the minimum overhead. Their demands are guidelines
on how well the city is developing but if they get out of line, they meet
Godzilla.

Defs:  (I=industrial, R=residential, C=commercial, PD=cops, FD=fire)

City layout: in general, go for a center of solid C zones, surrounded by R
zones, with I on the outer edges. Modify according to tips below. Like zones
tend to be mutually supporting. Plan on that basis and build in "wedges". Place
a couple C's at what will eventually be the city center, then some R's, I's on
the outside. Factories will grow and provide jobs anywhere but the good high
tax paying R's and C's only appear toward the middle. In general, make the
rails be the most direct route to the city center. Make roads the round-about
alternative.

Roads and rails: Roads are cheap but traffic is a pain. Where does traffic come
from and who complains? Residents! (as in residential) You can run roads all
through the I and C zones and you will not have appreciable traffic, plus you
will save a fortune in construction costs and 3 fortunes in maintenance. I have
cities that can be traversed from end-to-end by road with no traffic pollution
except in the industrial areas where it doesn't matter. As soon as houses get
access, traffic mushrooms. Use I, C, and municipal zones as the recipients of
road access and only a few widely scattered R zones, and you'll save 1-2% alone
on the tax rate while still having positive cash flow.

Road and rail: Somebody pays for each section of road or track. A tax paying
zone on each side of a section makes for efficient tax coverage. Avoid long
sections of track with Sims only on one side. Definitely avoid stretches of
side-by-side road and rail. Double roads (boulevards) mean you have too many R
zones with road access and they'll complain about the smog as they drive to
work. Avoid transport along shore lines and on the outer edge of the city. Put
zones on the shoreline to maximize land value modifiers and have the transport
sandwiched between two rows of tax paying Sims.

Bridges and tunnels: these are stretches with no adjacent tax payers. Keep these
short, especially tunnel. Plan crossing points in advance to reduce their
length. Got a cute little island in the river big enough for one or two zones?
Ask yourself if those zones are going to generate enough taxes to pay for the
transport to the island before giving them a bridge (forget tunnel). If an
island is a handy stepping stone to connect two sides of town together, that's
different. C zones do well on islands and don't generate much traffic.

Police stations: You need them or crime will drive tax payers away. PD's will
be in a checkerboard pattern. PD and FD zones are like transport. You minimize
their cost by ensuring there is someone in as much of their coverage area as
possible, being protected, and paying for it. Avoid placing PD's on shorelines
and the edge of the map where much of the coverage is wasted. Use them as
buffers between I and non-I zones or on roads.

Pollution: I zones, sea ports, and airports all produce a pollution dead space
3 tiles wide around them. R and C zones do not develop well if any part of the
zone touches this dead space. Worse, Sims living in R and C zones trying to
develop in this space are the sniveling weenies complaining to city hall about
the pollution. Busy roads passing through R and C zones leave a pollution pall
and produce the same effect on the evaluation and composite score. Use PD and FD
zones as buffers. Otherwise, leave a 3 tile wide green strip with maybe a rail
through it. As mentioned, keep roads out of residential areas. Busy roadbridges
are fine as the pollution is over water and fish don't vote.

Crime: Some level of crime can be tolerated in the industrial zones (like
pollution) where most of the crime is generated, but R and C zones start wining
as population density increases. Cops are needed. Crime drives out taxpayers.
Crime can also be reduced by increasing land value. In practical terms, avoid
any zone that does not have any tree or park tiles next to it. Tight banks of
zones with transport down each side, touching no green tiles, will foster crime.
Some city examples have roads all the way around most blocks. Wrong! Blocks
only need a single tile frontage for transport so leave gaps between them.
Every open tile adjacent to any zone must have trees or a park. This does help
supplement the fuzz while making the map more attractive.

Airports and Seaports: These generate pollution (noise) as for I zones. Place
these zones in I areas or out on an island (with road access). There is no
benefit to multiple seaports or airports.

Airports and crashes: (on the Amiga) Expect plane crashes. You can't turn them
off. Always (he said ALWAYS) place a FD adjacent to an airport (notice he didn't
say 1 or more tiles away). If a fire isn't quickly extinguished, the airport
explodes, dies, and you're out 10K bucks. Worse, very quickly, the C zones in
a mature city back paddle and mess up the tax base. Crashes most frequently
occur when the airplane hits that loud mouth DJ chopper jock and they both
plow into one of your prize highrises, burying countless Sims under burning
rubble. "Sky watch One" picks its favorite stretch of road and hovers around
it until the airplane eventually flies into it. That's why most crashes happen
in the same area. Put FD's along what semi-congested roads you have. Make sure
the city is covered. For overnight fund building in a younger city, "unplug"
the airport (disconnect power. The aircraft stop flying after a short while if
the a airport is unpowered) In a mature city, this may cause significant
regression of C zones.

Healing: all municipal zones (PD, FD, power house, airport, seaport, stadiums)
will heal themselves if they still have power and the rubble tile is bulldozed.
If they don't, they are too far damaged to regenerate. Replace them. The other
zones are sometimes left with those annoying notches after a crash or
earthquake. There are still lots of taxpayers in the rest of the building so
don't dump the developed zone too quickly. One remedy is to maintain power to
the building but bulldoze the rubble and ALL transport access. The building will
immediately drop one notch of density, but the new icon will fill the WHOLE
zone. Immediately replace the transport access and soon the now undamaged zone
will be at full density again (note: queries shortly after doing this show
"declining". Don't sweat it). Again, this works to a limited point of damage
and the center must be intact. If the bulldozed transport will cost more than
rezoning the building, make a choice.

Terrain editor: Use the terrain editor to add trees, tighten shorelines, place
a real waterfront on harbors. Careful on smoothing. If you smooth the trees on
an existing city, the trees trapped between buildings will be smoothed away and
you have to paint them back in. Paint in a few reflecting pools too for added
land value. When creating a new land plot from scratch, start with a city that
has money, erase it redraw the ground and save under a new name (carefully).
There is zero benefit to going with Medium or Hard game levels. They just
reduce starting money and slow tax growth. Never change the game level in the
Terrain Editor. It will reset the starting cash to the default for that game
level. Reset the year. Nobody needs to know how much time you spent on this
thing.

Summary: this is not a trivial game. The designer has done some interesting
work that has some of the meanest and rottenest victory criteria of any game
(your own standards). I'm still learning and like to see other cities and hear
tips and conjecture. (Why won't Maxis just send me the bloody source code?)

SORCERER
Oh my goodness!  What's happening?  A hellhound is racing toward you and it
looks hungry!  Is death anyway to start your new position with the Guild of
Enchanters? Keep telling yourself this is only a dream...wait awhile and you'll
wake up snug and safe in your bed inside Guildhall!  Whew!  But why is it so
dark?  Oh!  Your FROTZ spell must've worn off during the night.  Oh well, just
FROTZ yourself and get up and go west into the hallway.

 Hmmm, what's this?  A note's been tacked to your door.  Read it if you want,
but you have other things to do...like locating Belboz! Head south twice to the
Lobby and go west into the Store Room.  Take the Ochre Vial and the Matchbook
then go east back to the Lobby.  Reading the matchbook tells you about a nifty
new potion you can order!  Open the receptacle, put the matchbook in it then
close it.  Now go east into the Library. Later, after you finish the game, come
back in here and read the Encyclopedia Frobizzica.  It's loaded with all sorts
of information about your favorite Infocom games!  But for now, just get the
scroll, GNUSTO MEEF into your spell book and go back west to the Lobby.

 Now go north once and west into Helistar's Quarters. She's left behind a shiny
new scroll!  Get the scroll then GNUSTO GASPAR into your spell book.  Learn
GASPAR then GASPAR yourself (just in case!).  If you should happen to
inadvertantly die during the game, the GASPAR spell will restore your character
and put you back to where you last cast the GASPAR spell on yourself.  I hope
you won't have to use it!  But if you do, at least you'll have it. Don't forget
to re-cast it on yourself if you *do* die!  Go east back into the Hallway and
north and west into Belboz's Quarters.  If you start getting hungry or thirsty
messages, open the Ochre Vial and drink the potion. That will take care of any
hunger or thirst for the rest of the game.  When you've used the option, just
drop the vial.

 In Belboz's Quarters, look behind the tapestry and get the key that falls to
the floor.  Now open the desk drawer, get the journal, unlock it and read it.
You'll learn what's happened to Belboz and what he has designated the current
code to be.  Remember this code. Then look at the Infotater that came with your
game.  Look up the name of the monster that Belboz named as the code and note
the colors that correspond to the monster.  Write this color code down. You'll
need it to open the trunk in the basement.

 Drop the journal and the key and go east and south twice back to the Lobby. By
now, the mailman has arrived and put your package in the receptacle.  Open the
receptacle and get the Orange Vial. The issue of Popular Enchanting is useless.
 Time to take your leave of the Guildhall and start your journey to look for
Belboz!

 Go down the stairs into the Cellar and push the buttons that correspond to the
monster's color code.  You must do this correctly or else you'll have to start
from scratch!  So it's a good idea to save your game before you start doing any
button pushing!

 As you push each button, you'll hear a click.  After pushing the last button,
the trunk should pop open revealing  a moldy old scroll!  If it doesn't open,
restore your game and push the buttons again.

 When you read the scroll, you see it's called AIMFIZ and by casting it you'll
be transported to someone else's location! Okay, let's AIMFIZ BELBOZ and see if
that works!

 Oh well, it didn't find Belboz for you, but at least you're out of the
Guildhall!  But look at where you're at!  There's that blasted hellhound again
and this time it's not a dream!  Quickly!  Go northeast to the Forest Edge.
Whew!  The hellhound stops in its tracks and bellows at you.  Finally, it turns
tail and slinks back into the trees. Looking around, you see a signpost next to
a northern path, the road you just came in on back to the west, a wide rolling
meadow to the east.  At the base of the signpost you see a slimy (ugh!) hole
leading down.  Might as well take our chances with the hole right now. So grit
your teeth and go down into the hole.

 Upon going down the slimy hole you find yourself in a Snake Pit. Uh, let's not
spend anytime here, okay?  Go down once more into the Slimy Room. It's not much
better here, but at least there aren't any snakes or beetles! Go south to the
Crater and west to the Edge of the Chasm. Now is a good time to read your Spell
Book and see what new spells you've acquired since defeating the evil Krill in
ENCHANTER.  Hmmm, a few new ones have been added! And it seems as if one of the
new ones, IZYUK, is needed right here!

 Learn IZYUK twice, then IZYUK yourself and you gently leave the ground!  Go
west twice across the Chasm to Elbow Room.  Now go north to the Tree Room. What
a splendid sight!  Who said Zorkmids didn't grow on trees? As you take a coin,
though, the entire sight shimmers then disappears! Well, it seems that there's
only one to a customer.  Go south and east back to the Bare Passage, IZYUK
yourself again, then fly east twice back to the Crater.

 Time to leave this strange place (for now!) so go north, up twice back to the
Forest Edge then east and northeast to the River Bank.  Don't spend much time
here since the River Bank may deteriorate beneath you! Learn PULVER then PULVER
the river and go down into the dry River Bed.  As you look around at the
flopping fish, you see a cave entrance to the northest. Go northeast into the
Hidden Cave.  Looking around, you see a pile of Bat Guano, a Soiled Scroll and
an Amber Vial.  The Amber Vial is useless in the game, so you can leave it. But
be sure to get the Soiled Scroll and the Bat Guano!  GNUSTO FWEEP into your
Spell Book and go down the hole to the Pile of Bones.

 Now go southwest and up to the Ruins.  Nothing to see or do here, so learn
IZYUK and go west twice back to the Meadow.  IZYUK yourself and fly northeast
and southeast to the Fort Entrance.  If you hadn't been flying, you most
certainly would've fallen into the river! (That river bank has started looking
awfully unstable!)  If you're feeling sleepy, you can go to sleep here.

 Go east onto the Parade Ground. You see a flagpole and high above, the flag of
Quendor fluttering in the breeze!  Lower the flag and examine it.  While doing
so, you notice a secret pocket and in the pocket you find an Aqua Vial!  Take
the vial and go east to the Gun Emplacement.  Looking down into the barrel of
the huge cannon, you see what appears to be a pile of ordinary scrolls!  But
when you try to take one, your fingers get nipped by sharp little teeth! If you
read about YIPPLES in your Infotater, you'll soon learn that that's what you've
found inside the barrel!  Put the Bat Guano into the cannon barrel. As you do,
dozens of little scrolls pour out and run away in every direction!  When you
look back inside the barrel, though, you see one ordinary scroll is left! Take
the Ordinary Scroll.  You can't GNUSTO it because of its complexity. Just carry
it with you.

 Time to leave, so go west twice to the Fort Entrance.  You'll have to learn
IZYUK twice again because you'll have to go back via the River Bank.  IZYUK
yourself and fly northwest and southwest to the Meadow.  Now IZYUK yourself
again and fly east twice into the Ruins. The reason for this second IZYUK is
because the Drawbridge has the same bad habit of disintegrating!

 Go down twice to the Highway and east to the Toll Gate.  A fat gnome is
sleeping soundly behind the toll gate.  Waken him and give him the Zorkmid. As
you hand him the coin, he lifts the gate allowing you to pass through, then he
promptly falls back asleep...poor old thing! Go east twice then north twice to
Outside the Glass Arch.

 Learn FWEEP three times, drop all your possessions and prepare to enter the
strangest maze you've ever seen!

 Go east to the Inside of the Glass Maze.  All around you, you see Glass!  The
walls, the floors, the ceilings are all clear!  It's impossible to tell what's
there and what isn't! This is where FWEEP will help you out, so FWEEP yourself
once.  Amazing!  You've turned yourself into a Bat! But, better yet, you've now
got a built-in sonar and can "see" where the openings are! Follow closely, now,
and don't get lost!

 Go north, east, south twice, west, down, east twice, north twice, up twice,
south and east.  Whew!  Solid ground again!  You're outside the Maze and see a
parchment scroll here!  But as you pick it up, you hear fiendish laughter and
out of the corner of your eye, you see the glass in the Maze shift ever so
slightly!  Now what?  Someone's shifted the paths inside and it's the only way
out of here! Drop the scroll down the hole (you can't possibly carry the scroll
when you become a bat again!).  FWEEP yourself again and....

 Uh-oh.  Now you've done it!  From the base of the cliff, a huge Dorn Beast
comes galloping and roaring toward you!  Quickly re-enter the Maze!  Remember,
though, that the panels have shifted and with that Dorn Beast on your, uh,
"heels," you can't afford to make any mistakes!

 Go west twice, south and east.  The Dorn Beast, not realizing it can't fly
comes charging after you! It lets out a high-pitched squeal and goes plummeting
to its death!  Thank goodness!  Now you can continue at a more leisurely (but
not TOO leisurely!) pace.  Go down twice (past the splattered remains of the
Dorn Beast), west twice, up twice, north twice, down and east. Here, the FWEEP
spell will wear off, so FWEEP yourself again and continue by going south, east,
north, down, west, south, west, up, and west to the Outside of the Glass Arch.

 You'll continue to fly for a few more turns, so wait until the FWEEP spell
wears off, then pick up all your possessions, go south twice and enter the Hut.
Inside the fireplace of the Hut you see the Parchment Scroll!  Get the scroll
and GNUSTO SWANZO.  You should be getting pretty tired by now, too, so go to
sleep and take a breather.

 Once you're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed again, go out, and west twice back to
the gnome.  With a little petty larceny in your heart, search the (still)
sleeping gnome.  In one of his pockets you find and take your Zorkmid back. No
time for guilty feelings, though, so go west twice back to the Bend, southwest
to the Edge of the Crater and down into the Crater.

 From here go down into the Winding Tunnel and southwest to the Park Entrance.
When you try to enter the Park, though, a force field bars your way and soon, a
gawdily dressed gnome appears and tells you admittance to the Park is one
Zorkmid!  Well, crime doesn't pay afterall!  Give the pilfered Zorkmid to the
gnome and go west twice and south to the Arcade.

 A hawker is standing here inside a "Bash the Bunny" booth and is asking you to
try your hand at this innocent passtime!  Time to put the Aqua Vial to use.
Open the vial and drink the potion. Suddenly, your muscles vibrate and you feel
stronger!  Drop the vial and take the ball from the hawker.  As you throw the
ball at the bunny, it goes spinning around!  The hawker gives you a Glittering
Scroll as your prize and tells you to "scram"!  No time to argue with him right
now.  Go north, east twice, northeast an south to the Hall of Carvings.

 On the southern wall, you see an extremely lifelike carving of a dragon! Read
both the Ordinary Scroll and the Glittering Scroll.  You'll see that YONK
augments the power of one scroll and that MALYON gives life to inanimate
objects.  Do you think we should bring this dragon to life?  It's certain you
can't go any farther and that dragon might be hiding a secret entrance!

 YONK the MALYON scroll then MALYON the dragon. The words of the MALYON scroll
glow brightly for a moment and the dragon comes impossibly to life!  As the
stones from the wall fall around it, it roars with pain and anger! When it sees
you, it thinks all this pain is caused by you!  It rears back its huge head and
with smoke billowing from its nostrils, prepares to turn you into a crispy
critter!  Just as the dragon takes a step toward you, it suddenly reverts to
stone!  Whew...saved!  But look!  Where the dragon used to be, there is now an
entrance into a southern passage!

 Before you go south into the passage, wait until your muscles feel limp. Then
open the Orange Vial.  You should only be carrying the Orange Vial and your
Spell Book now.  Go south into the Sooty Room. The noxious odor of sulfur comes
from the room to the east.  But there is no other way to go, so go east. As you
enter the Coal Bin Room, you hear a thunderous roar behind you as the entrance
is sealed shut by the collapsing tunnel!  Not only that, the air in here isn't
going to be breathable for long!  Quickly drink the potion from the Orange Vial
then drop the vial.  As you do so, someone slides down the coal chute!  As you
look closely, you seem to be looking at your twin!

 Make careful note of the number your "twin" gives you, then give him your
Spell Book.  When you hand him your book, he takes it and makes a mad dive
down the coal chute leaving you quite alone!  No time to waste, however, since
your potion won't last long!  Go east into the Dial Room and set the dial on
the door to the number your older self gave you.  Open the door and go east
into the Shaft Bottom.  You should be empty handed.  If you're not, drop
everything you're carrying!  Get the rope you see here and go up and southwest
to the Coal Mine. Tie the rope to the beam you see here and get the beam. Now
go northwest and west to the Top of the Chute. Put the beam across the chute,
drop the rope down the chute and climb down the rope.

 As you climb down the rope, you clamber inside a small opening you see off to
the side of the chute and find yourself in the Slanted Room.  If you'd been
carrying anything, you wouldn't have been able to get in here.  Looking around
the room you see a Shimmering Scroll and an odd lantern with an open drawer in
it.  Read the scroll and you see it's for a spell that will take you back in
time!  GOLMAC yourself and open the lantern.  Inside the lantern you find a
Smelly Scroll! Take the Smelly Scroll (leave the Shimmering Scroll) and quickly
go east down the coal chute!  Your VILSTU potion has about run out and it's
doubtful you will survive unless you can get out of here quickly!

 When you arrive back in the Coal Bin Room, standing before you is your younger
self!  He/You is dropping an Orange Vial!  Quickly tell your younger self what
the combination to the Dial is!  When he gives you the Spell Book, go down the
chute and outside to....

 Fresh air and a Lagoon!  As your VILSTU potion wears off, you get incredibly
sleepy -- an unfortunate side effect -- so go to sleep. When you wake up, learn
MEEF twice and SWANZO once.  Drop everything you're carrying and go east into
the Lagoon and dive.  On the bottom of the Lagoon you see a tangle of
spenseweeds.  MEEF the weeds and get the crate they were hiding.  Go west back
to the Lagoon Shore, drop and open the crate.  Get only the Grue Repellent. Get
the Smelly Scroll and go northeast and north to the Mouth of the River.  Those
are stinging vines around the cave entrance and they'll kill you!  MEEF the
vines and read the Smelly Scroll.  The scroll is a protection scroll!  VARDIK
yourself, spray the Grue Repellent on yourself and go west twice past the Grue
Lair into the Mammoth Cavern.

 Before you stand three doors.  Belboz is behind the White Door. The other two
doors open to miserable, everlasting, certain pain and agony!  Open the White
Door and you see Belboz lying here in a trance of some sort!  SWANZO Belboz. As
you do, you see the translucent shape of Jeearr rise from Belboz's body.  It
wafts towards you and "feel" a disembodied voice threatening to take possession
of your body from wherein it will reign in terror for a thousand thousand
years.

 As it begins to contract around you, it suddenly senses your protection from
the VARDIK spell!  Screaming in terror and agony, Jeearr knows he has been
beaten!  With a final scream, he disappears and all is quiet.

 Slowly, Belboz rises, questions you briefly, then speaks a spell that returns
you both to the Chamber of the Circle of Enchanters. There, he tells the others
what you have done and that he has finally found one to replace him when he
steps down as the Head of the Circle...you!

SPELLBREAKER

 I would like to express gratitude, no, EXTREME gratitude to Wayne Shipley
who is the real mastermind.  He solved Spellbreaker and helped me along with
hints when I needed them.  A thousand thanks Wayne!

 Now, onto the solve.  In ENCHANTER, you were a beginning magic-user who was
struggling to build your skills.  Your mentor, Belboz the Enchanter bestowed
upon you a mission: to enter the castle of the evil wizard Krill and destroy
him.  Krill could not detect you because of your low experience level.  In
the end you destroyed Krill and gained yourself a position in the Circle of
Enchanters.
 In SORCERER, the second of the trilogy, you as a member of the Circle of
Enchanters had been moved to the guild hall where you lived.  One morning you
awake and find Belboz is gone.  One of your fellow Enchanters has left a note
saying he (your fellow) has taken the beginning magic-users to the town.
Through investigation, you find Belboz has been missing for some time and you
set out to find him.  At the end of the game you confront Jeearr, the demon,
who has captured Belboz and destroy him.  Thus, you gain yourself the honor
of being the Head of the Circle of Enchanters.
 That brings us to SPELLBREAKER.  Magic is failing the land and your fellow
guildmasters are getting uneasy.  At a session of the circle, the
guildmasters express their problems and ask you for help.  Before the end of
the meeting, a bizarre happening occurs.  All of the guildmasters (except
you) are turned into, yes, amphibians!  The stage is set, you glance a figure
in a dark cloak fleeing the room, and your quest has begun.  To find what is
causing the magic to fail.  The solve begins!

 After waiting through the speakers at the meeting and seeing the
dark-cloaked figure flee the chamber, follow the figure out of the building.
Unfortunately, the figure disappears in a cloud of orange smoke.  There is
not way for you to prevent this, so don't fret over it.  Learn the lesoch
spell from your spell book and use it.  (You may have to do this up to 15
times as your magic is very unsteady at the beginning of the game).  After
the smoke clears, you will find a cube.  Take it and return north.  Get
either the bread of the fish (it doesn't matter) and go back south.  When
back in the square, read your spell book.  (???) That spell was not there
before!  Interesting (we're referring to the "blorple" spell in case you
haven't figured it out)....learn this spell and cast it on the cube.

Note: When playing the game, DO NOT FROTZ YOURSELF!

Packed Earth
------ -----
 The spell combined with the cube has teleported you to this room.  The cube
is gone for now, but you'll get it back.  Go east and there ya go, you have
it back.  From the ruins room, go south and pick up the zipper.  Open up the
zipper and get in it (!) (yes, do it).  Now 'l'ook.  Get the scroll and exit
the zipper.  Learn the blorple spell again, and....hold on...

 While I'm on the subject, I suggest you write something on the cubes you
find to identify them.  You need the burin to do so.  It doesn't matter what
you right on them, but I suggest it make sense (I wrote 'earth' on the cube
that takes you to the Packed Earth, etc.).

 Ok, continuing....blorple the 'earth' cube (as I will now call it) and you
are back in the earth room.  Go south and get the 'throck' scroll.  Gnusto
the throck spell.  Now blorple 'earth' once again and this time go down.
You'll have to do so twice as the first time to reel back.  Whoosh!  Ah here
we are falling towards the ground at very high speeds...fun eh?  Don't worry,
a bird will catch you (I hope) and take you to its nest.  When in the nest
get the scroll you find there and gnusto it.  It should be the caskly spell.
Blorple 'earth' once again, go south, then up.
  This place here is very unsteady, but just wait and what do you know, the
rocks start tumbling down to crush you.  No problem, wait until the
description says something like "...the boulders create a curtain above
you..." and then cast the girgol spell (the one on the scroll that was in the
zipper).  Time will stop, and you can climb up the boulders.  Do so, and when
at the top, get the coin.  Go west to the hermit's hut and try to take the
cube.  This should give you a hint for what you do next...anyway, you caskly
the hut and it will reform so that it doesn't need to cube to support it.
Get this cube and blorple it.

Soft Room
---- ----
 Go south from this room into the meadow.  When the cube reappears, write
"soft" on it.  Oh, in case I haven't mentioned it (which I haven't) you can
put a LOT of things in the zipper so feel free to push it to its limit.  Now,
in the meadow, get the shears, and try to get the plant twice.  On the second
time it should come out.  Blorple 'earth'.

 From Packed Earth, go west, then north.  The ogre here is suffering from hay
fever (how nice).  Plant the ragweed and cast the throck spell on it.  While
the ogre is writhing on the ground, go down into his lair.  Get the box and
the scroll.  Go back out of the lair, and then exit the cave itself.  Read
the scroll and gnusto the espnis spell.  Open up the box and (!) another cube
(yes, these cubes do mean something) will be revealed.  Take this and blorple
it.

Water Room
----- ----
 Now, learn blorple a couple of extra times and put the spell book in the
zipper (and close the zipper) then retrieve the bread or the fish from
wherever you put it.  Make sure nothing that would be ruined if it got wet is
exposed and then go south.
Splash!  Into the ocean you go.  Floating nearby will be the cube you got to
the water room with and a bottle.  There should also be a pesky grouper
swimming nearby.  Drop whatever food you brought with you and the grouper
will eat it and depart.  You can now get the bottle and the cube.  It will
take you two turns as they are floating different directions.  Now, get out
of this place by 'blorple'ing the cube that got you here.  You should be back
at the Water Room.  Now, open the zipper, and get your spell book out.  Open
the bottle and get the scroll you find inside.  Gnusto the liskon spell.  Now
you can do the next thing two ways, in two steps, which is long, or in a more
direct route.  We'll be taking the direct route.  Go north from the Water
Room.  In this area, learn the liskon spell and once again put the spell book
in the zipper and close the zipper.  Now liskon yourself, and go down.  You
should be in the channel of water.  The current will shove you along, so you
might as well go west.  Once inside the pipe read the descriptions carefully,
for in one of them it mentions a indentation in which a white blockish item
is.  Yes, it is another cube so retrieve it before the current shoves you on.
When you reach the ruined pipe, go up and get out.  I might as well tell you
now, write 'change' on the cube you just got and put it away.  You won't need
it just yet.  Now go north twice.
 Whoa!  Pretty big serpet huh?  Well, we'll just have to correct that won't
we?  Use the liskon spell to shrink that baby down to size and saunter on
past.  Go north once again and you should be in the temple.  Take the shears
and climb the rodent idol.  Say "PRY EYE WITH SHEARS" and the rodent's opal
eye should pop out.  Grab it!  With that done, climb back down and learn the
spells malyon, and espnis.  Malyon the idol, wait one turn, and then espnis
him.  Keep on waiting until he falls into dreamland.  When he is asleep,
climb him and get the cube that is in his mouth.  Blorple the cube.

Air Room
--- ----
 Go north, get the tinsot scroll and gnusto it.  Blorple the white cube (it
should be the only one without any writing on it).  When back in the air
room, go west.  When you reach the Bazaar, you might as well label the white
cube 'air'.  With that done, go into the shop to the east.  The merchant will
come up and offer you some carpets.  Be sure to say "BUY BLUE CARPET FROM
MERCHANT".  Even though he won't react, the statement will be put away for
later.  Now, offer 200 to the merchant.  The merchant will tell you his price
is 800.  So, go up a hundred and offer 300.  He'll go down to 700.  You go up
to 400, he'll drop to 600.  And there!  You both will settle on 500.  Before
you leave, check your inventory.  Ah ha!  He gave you the red carpet, but you
wanted the blue!  So say "TRADE RED CARPET" and he'll give you the blue
carpet, and the magic carpet, which are one and the same.  Now exit the man's
shop before he really becomes unmanagable.  Once outside, put the blue carpet
in the zipper and blorple the water cube.  From here go north.  Learn the
tinsot spell four (4) times.  Put the spell book in the zipper and close it
(yup, you're gonna get wet again).  Now, tinsot the outflow pipe.  Do so once
again and the water should start rising.  Wait until the water has moved you
up to near the trap door and then tinsot the water once again.  An ice floe!
Well get on it!  Now rezrov the trap door, and go up.  Get the cube you find
here and write 'bones' on it.  You'll never have to use this cube so put it
away.  Go east and then north into the cell.  Rezrov the cabinet and you'll
find a book that is a bit trashy.  Fix it up!  Use the caskly spell on the
book and you'll be able to read the snavig spell.  Gnusto it.  From here go
back south and west.  Then get the carpet from the zipper and go up the
stairs.  Drop the carpet then "SIT ON CARPET".  You'll now see a bird flying
at you (the same one!).  (You should have sometime before the next move.  Put
everything but the 'water' cube in the zipper).  When the bird reaches the
tower and is circling it, go 'u'p.  Zoom!  You wing your way into the air and
startle that bird so much he just takes off.  Now go west four (4) times.
You should be above a bird's nest.  Descend into the nest.  Don't
dilly-dally, do the next movements one after another.  Get off the carpet,
get the cube, sit back on the carpet and take off.  Write "string" on the
cube you just got.  Fly back east four times to the tower and land.  The bird
will begin coming again so stand up, get your carpet, and go down.  Blorple
the "string" cube.

String Room
------ ----
 From this room go south.  Ah, here is Belboz!  Good old Belboz!  Say
"BELBOZ, HELLO".  Hmmm, not happy to see you huh?  Now say "BELBOZ, WHAT
ABOUT MAGIC".  He will begin explaining what is going on how someone is
impersonating you and he wants to know if you are real.  He'll ask you a
question and to find the answers you must refer to the cards which came with
your package.  On the cards are the answers to Belboz's questions.  After
correctly answering, Belboz will give you a key (put it in the zipper, you'll
need it).  Just for fun, show Belboz a cube and he'll explain a little of
what they are.  Say bye to Belboz, and blorple 'water'.
 Ok, major move here.  Learn the snavig spell and put all perishables in the
zipper, and close the zipper.  (You mean you don't like getting wet?).  Go
south, and grab the cube before the grouper can eat it.  The fish will begin
swimming around, so you can make your move.  Enter "SNAVIG GROUPER" and you
will turn yourself into a grouper.  Swim down now to the grouper's nest and
wait.  Yes, wait until you turn back into a human.  When this happens, type
"GET ALL".  This having been done (you're running out of air!), go up.  Gasp!
You made it!  Blorple the 'water' cube.  When you reach the Water Room, write
"light" on the cube you just got, put everything but your book and the
'light' cube in the zipper, and go north once again.  From here, blorple the
'light' cube.

Light Room
----- ----
 Here, go west to the volcano.  Learn the tinsot spell while you are waiting
around.  Sooner of later a red hot lava fragment will appear from the lava.
Tinsot this and get it.  Put it in the zipper.  Now, get that 'change' cube
you got some time ago and blorple it.  On we go...

Change Room
------ ----
 Go north from this room.  Get the compass rose and blorple the 'change' cube
once again.  When back in this room, go west.  You should now be in a room
with a sculpture of the compass rose.  When here, insert the rose itself into
the carving.  A small hole should appear, why not go through it?  Not yet!
Get the rose you just inserted, and THEN go through the hole.

 This is one of the trickier problems of the game.  Follow these commands
exactly.  Touch west wall with rose, west.  Touch northeast wall with rose,
northeast.  Touch northwest wall with rose, northwest.  Rezrov alabaster.
West.  Get the cube.  Write 'none' on this cube.  Blorple it.

No Place
-- -----
 This is another strange place in the game.  Admire it all you want, but
eventually go south.  Here you will encounter a talking rock.  Try getting on
him.  Ooooo.....how can we manage this?  He wants food...(try feeding him the
fish if you have it just for fun)....give him the lava fragment you got.  Oh!
There ya go!  That is what he wanted.  He'll now let you ride him.  So do so.

 This is another of the more puzzling sections of the game.  Actually, what
you are trying to do is cut off the brown-eyed rock in the distance who has
the cube on its back.  But, you see the brown-eyed rock moves at random
whenever you move so there are no set commands.  Here is a map of the valley
so you can trap him in a corner of something:

    *--*--*
   /|  |  |
  / |  |  |
 *--*--*--*  <- You start on the spot second from the left on this row.
 |  |  |  |
 |  |  |  |
 *--*--*--*
 |  |  |  |
 |  |  |  |
 *--*--*--*

 When you do corner the rock, type "JUMP ONTO BROWN ROCK".  You'll leap onto
him from the green rock.  Get the cube he has and write 'dark' on it.
Blorple it and onward......

Dark Room
---- ----
 (Quite a variety of places in this game, no?)  Here we are in the Dark Room.
Opposite of the Light Room.  You can't figure out where the exits are by
looking so just try to move around....(in case you are really inept, the
exits are up and down).  Go down.  You should now be in a dark cave.  What
you do now, is take your current light source (whatever you frotzed) and put
it in the zipper.  Then take some object you care little about and frotz it.
Drop this second frotzed item.  Close the zipper and the only source of light
should be what you dropped.  Ok, that done, get your spell book (if you put
it in the zipper) and learn the snavig spell.  Remember!  If your spell book
is your light source, put it back in the zipper and close the zipper!  Now,
go down once again.  You should be in pitch black...but wait!  No!  I can't
be!  Yes it is, your good old friends the grues are here, as they are in just
about every Infocom game, but you see them only as shapes.  Cast the snavig
spell on the shapes, and you become a grue (never thought you would stoop
this low huh?).  The description should now be listed in a grue's point of
view.  Wait four (4) (I believe it is four, perhaps you should save the game
in the Dark Cave in case four is not right) times and then go down or say
'enter pool'.  You'll immerse yourself in the light which begins to burn at
your eyes, you are a grue you know...go up, and you'll be on top of the
pillar.  By now you should have changed into a human but the grues will not
enter the light to get you.  Ah, what have we here?  Another cube!  Take this
cube and write 'fire' on it.  Blorple the 'fire' cube.

Fire Room
---- ----
 (Water Room, Fire Room...hmmm) Ok, to solve the puzzles of this room, you
need to figure out the nature of the gold box you have (you didn't drop it
did you?).  Go north from the room and you should be on top of the volcano
you were at the base of before.  In the distance you can see an outcropping.
Go ahead and examine outcropping.  Too far to jump...this is where the box
comes in.  You take the 'fire' cube, and put it in the box.  (Gasp!) I hear
you say, didn't know that happened...well later on you can waste your time
putting all of the cubes in the box to see what happens, right now, remove
the 'fire' cube from the box and throw the box to the outcropping.  Blorple
the 'fire' cube.  From the Fire Room there is a west exit.  You couldn't get
through this exit before if you had tried.  Now you can.  Go west.  On the
outcropping you are!  Get your gold box, and put it in the zipper.  Take the
cube you find and watch things happen.  You see, this is the last cube you
are trying to find (well there are four more, but you will see what happened
to them later).  Label it 'power'.  You see, this cube is indeed a power
cube.  When you have it, you can learn/memorize unlimited spells, and your
spells are strengthened themselves.  From the outcropping, get the 'none'
cube and blorple it.  When back in No Place, go east to the Inner Vault.  If
you had come here before and tried to rezrov the vault door, you will know it
doesn't work.  But look at what I told you a few sentences before.  Yes,
rezrov the vault door and it will open.  I suggest you save the game now.
Learn the jindak spell and go north into the Outer Vault.

 This is another random place in the game so there are no set commands for
it.  There are cubes in piles like so:


                 x1                                x7
             x2      x3                        x8      x9
        x4       x5       x6             x10      x11       x12

 (Well perhaps they don't look like that but that is a good way to see them)

 Jindak the cubes.  One of the piles will glow brighter then the other.  Get
a cube from the brighter pile and blorple it.  If you are taken to
'Nondescript Room' then go south and get another cube from that pile and
blorple it.  If this also takes you to the 'Nondescript Room' then just
restore the game and try again.  The thing is: there is one cube in the
brighter pile that means something.  Just keep blorpling until you find it.
When you do, you shall behold....

Sand Room
---- ----
 This is my favorite part of the game.  It sort of appeals to me.  Perhaps
you'll see why because this part of the game deals with rooms you have
already been in....somewhen....
 To begin with save your game, and then you must go down.  You can't go up
first or everything will be screwed up.  Go down and you will reach the
prison cell you were at before, but look!  It is not in ruins anymore.
You've moved back in time.  Just for fun, try blorpling the 'x' cube to get
you back to the Sand Room and read the description carefully.  It has to do
with your memories, so to get out of the room safely, you must arrange the
room so that with the effects of time, the room will be exactly the way it
was when you entered it in the beginning of the game.  Back to the
Cell....let's analyze what it was like when you went in it the first time:
(1) The cabinet had to be rezroved as the lock was intact.  If you try
rezroving the cabinet now, the lock will be destroyed, so that won't work.
You must use the key to unlock the cabinet and get the vellum scroll you find
inside.  (2) A decaying book was in the cabinet.  Book?  Yes, your spell book
must go.  So learn a few extra blorples and put the book in the cabinet.
Close the cabinet up and lock it with the key.  Now, one more thing to make
it right...(3) The door to the cell had been torn off, as if by a 'rezrov'
spell.  It's fairly simple, you must rezrov the door.  The door will be blown
off and you'll hear guards outside.  Everything is right and it's time to go.
So blorple the 'x' cube and you'll make it safely back to the Sand Room.
 Ok now take EVERYTHING out of the zipper and drop it on the ground.  When
this is done, get all the cubes, and put them in the zipper.  In addition,
get the vellum scroll, the burin, and the opal eye.  This is all you need to
finish the game.  So leave the rest of the stuff where it is and go up.
 Here you appear in the ruins room back in the time when it was being
flooded.  Think again how the Ruins room was before when you entered it the
first time.  The zipper was here with a girgol spell in it.  Get the sack and
open it, ha!  There is your girgol spell.  Now don't make useless commands as
the water is rising and you must do this quickly.  Get the girgol spell out
of the sack and enter:
>Write girgol on vellum scroll
 Using the burin you will copy the girgol spell onto the vellum scroll (which
is blank in case you didn't examine it).  Now put the girgol spell in the
zipper, and put whatever else you are holding EXCEPT the zipper in the sack.
Now get all the cubes out of the zipper.  You'll only be able to take about
7, but don't worry cause you'll have some more time.  Watch to see when you
take the 'power' cube because it is the one cube you want to keep out of the
sack.  Keep typing 'get all cubes from zipper' and 'put all cubes (but
'power') in sack' until you are sure you have all the cubes out of the zipper
and only the girgol scroll is inside it.  Then close the zipper, and drop it.
By now the water is probably up to your waist but you're done so blorple the
'power' cube.

Magic Room
----- ----
 That was the last time you need to use a cube.  You're approaching the end
of the game, but you still need some items.  Get the vellum scroll, and the
opal eye out of the sack so you have them handy.  Then go east.

Castle
------
 This is the last room in the game.  This part of the game gets my vote as
second favorite.  The descriptions are very enthralling to read and in the
end, you feel like you really have done something.  Just wait until the
figure appears on the throne.  Keep waiting and listen to what he is saying
(it really is interesting....he tells you how he found the 'earth' cube along
with four other cubes (I wonder what they are?) and let you find the rest for
him...devious character, isn't he?).  When the figure says "...have become
almost as powerful as you!..." you'll have your cue.  Hit the figure.  He'll
freeze you with some spell.  Wait now and read the descriptions carefully
because they are fasinating...he uses the cubes to construct a hypercube
which will give him ultimate power.  You'll also notice as you are waiting
that his freeze spell is wearing off.  If I timed it right, the freeze spell
should totally end just as the figure takes the 'power' cube, places it in
the hypercube, and prepares to jump in.  You have one move left before the
shadow destroys everything...what to do?  It's obvious, use the girgol spell,
stop him from jumping in.  Cast the girgol spell and he'll be caught in
mid-leap.  Now, take the 'power' cube out of the hypercube (just say 'get
"power" cube') and put the opal eye in.  This will take two turns, and at the
end of those two turns the girgol spell will wear off.  The shadow no longer
wants to jump into the hypercube, but he has no choice, he is already in
mid-leap.  He plunges into the tesseract and the game is won.  The ending is
quite interesting.  Since you put a non-magical item in the hypercube, all
magic was destroyed from the world along with the shadow.  A new age has
begun, Belboz explains.  Magic is gone from the world, never to return, but
the new world without magic will serve us better.  What age are they talking
about?  The game offers an explanation as to where magic has gone to and why
our present day world has none.  Just looking at your class will tell you
what the new age is: Scientist.  Later on...

(Since I never told you, the 'bones' cube will take you to the Boneyard,
which is where you would have gone if you had died...but you didn't..right?)

STARCROSS

 Is it Earth approach time already?  No, that's the alarm bell ringing!  Now
what?  Time to get up and see what's up on board the Starship STARCROSS. Up and
at 'em and don't forget that tape library. Go starboard and push the red button
to turn off the bell.  Push the blue button and go starboard. Get the suit and
safety line then back port to the control panel.

 Ah, peace!  Since you can hear yourself think again, sit down and fasten your
seatbelt.  Let's see what the hullabaloo's about.  Read the screen.  So that's
it, a mass is out there...maybe it's another black hole or asteroid, or who
knows!  Look up the mass's location on your starchart and key the coordinates
into your onboard computer as follows:

 TELL COMPUTER "RANGE IS xxx"
 TELL COMPUTER "PHI IS xxx"
 TELL COMPUTER "THETA IS xxx"

 After several seconds of blinking lights, the computer should say the
coordinates have been fed into the navigation prograam and it's waiting for
confirmation.  Tell the computer "confirmed" and wait for the countdown.  Good
thing your seatbelt was secured or you would've bounced all over the cabin! Now
you're on your way to the mass.  So you'll have to keep typing in LOOK or WAIT
until the STARCROSS is held firmly by the grappling hooks of the....

 Alien Artifact?!?  My stars, what have you gotten us into?  Well, too late to
worry about that now.  May as well have a look around.  So unfasten your belt
and stand up.

 Open the inner door and exit.  Close the inner door and put your suit on. (In
space, no one will hear you explode if you come into contact with vacuum!) Open
the outer door and go outside.  Your first problem stares you in the face. An
alien sculpture beckons you.  This is actually the red airlock's welcome mat.
But before it will allow you entrance, you have to tell it where you're from.
Upon closer examination, you see it's really just a bas-relief of the solar
system.  So push the fourth bump (which represents Earth). The whole sculpture
recedes except for one hexagon. Push it and a black rod is thrust forth.  Take
the rod and voila!  The airlock opens!

 Enter the airlock and close the outer door.  Remove your suit and open the
inner door.  The air is breathable...for a while, that is. We're off to collect
rods to repair the systems that have failed and stalled the Artifact in space.
The black rod is not one of the required rods, so drop it here and head out.

 You're in a long red hall with side corridors.  In the Artifact, the standard
directions can replace the fore, aft,starboard and port directions, so if you'd
prefer using north, south, east and west, feel free!

 First, we're going to repair the air supply. So go fore, starboard four times,
fore and starboard. You're in some sort of Intergalactic Zoo and there's a nest
of creatures that look like a cross between rats and ants! Ferocious little
beggars aren't they?  Look closely at their nest and you'll see a red rod has
been used as part of the structure.  Trying to just take it isn't notably
helpful since these little critters nip at you everytime you try. So the only
way to get the rod is to destroy their nest and divert their attention.  Throw
the tape player at the nest.  The rat-ants go into furious activity repairing
your handiwork!  While they're busy, get the rod and your tape library back.
Now go port, aft, port, and aft.  There's a blue airlock here.  So open the
airlock and go down.  Now close the inner door and open the outer door. There's
an umbilical connecting the blue airlock to a series of bubbles. Go aft to the
bubbles and another umbilical connects the bubbles to a ship grappled just like
yours is!  Go aft to the ship and look!  There's a multi-eyed creature staring
at you.  It looks like a spider, but don't worry, it's friendly and certainly
very lonely.  Wonder what would perk it up? Say, turn your tape library on and
play it.  Well, well, well, look at that guy!  He's all ears!  Give the spider
the tape library and, in gratitude, he gives you a yellow rod!  Nice guy! Take
the rod, bid farewell to your new-found friend and head back fore to the blue
airlock.  Enter the airlock, close the outer door, open the inner door and go
up twice.

 We're now going to repair the lighting and air supply aboard the Artifact.
You're standing inside the Inner Region of the Artifact. Evidently, the aliens
recreated an ecosystem which sheltered a race of weasels and their food
supply...Unicorns!  But you haven't got time to explain to the weasel hunting
party that unicorns are extinct. If you don't fix the air supply, more animals
will become extinct...including you!  So go aft and you see a covered hatch.
Open the hatch and go down.  You're now in the Repair Room. Get the metal and
ceramic square you see lying here then take a look around. My goodness look at
all those slots!  What goes where?  Well, logical deduction tells you that you
should put the yellow rod in the yellow slot.  Do so.  Now about those red
slots: There are three of them and depending on what sort of gas you're used to
breathing (the aliens thought of everything!)will dictate which slot you choose
to put the red rod in.  The dots are representations of gases, and if you look
very carefully, you'll see the second slot's dots represent oxygen. So put the
red rod in the second slot.  You hear hidden machinery hum to life! Nice going!
Okay, back up and fore then down back to the blue airlock area.

 Now, go aft and port.  You've found the Weapons Deck and there's a strange
looking raygun laying here.  Get the gun and look inside.  Aha! A silver rod!
Get the silver rod and keep the gun.  Go back starboard, aft, port, and fore.
You're in the yellow airlock area.  Open the inner door and enter the airlock.
Now close the inner door, put your space suit on and open the outer door. Hmmm,
it's a bit tight, better try opening it again.  Oomph! Finally!  Okay, go
outside and attach your safety line to the suit and the hook you find here.
This will keep you from floating off into space!

 Go port and look!  There's a dead alien here tangled in the debris and it's
clutching a pink rod!  Get the rod and go back starboard, detach the line from
the hook and enter the airlock.  Close the door, remove the suit and get that
strange basket you see here.  It'll help you carry your rods. Insert the pink
and silver rods in the basket, open the inner door and go back up to the yellow
hall.

 Now go aft twice and then starboard.  You've found the laboratory! And look at
that!  There's a strange silver globe seemingly floating in mid-air!  If you
turn the dial to 1, the globe shrinks in size revealing a blue rod firmly
embedded in the globe!  Very curious!  Turn the dial back to 3 for now. Get the
red and blue disks you see hanging on the wall here. These disks are extremely
important since they are teleportation disks!They will help you out of several
tight squeezes later on.  But for now, they are instrumental in acquiring the
blue rod.

 Drop one of the disks on the floor and put the other one under the silver
globe. It doesn't matter which disk you use where since they both have the same
properties.  Now place the basket on top of the globe.  Let's see now, turning
the dial to 1 made the disk smaller, so turning it to 4 should make it larger,
right?  Right!  So turn the dial to 4 and...gracious! The globe expands to a
point where it is resting on the floor (and, o. ains the blue rod!Turn the dial
back to 3 and retrieve both of the disks, your basket and all the rods.

 Now head port and go fore four times, then port and aft.  You've located the
Computer Room and it's awfully quiet in here.  Let's see if we can get the old
girl humming again!

 Open the access panel and you see one of the cards is missing.  The metal and
ceramic square you're carrying would probably fill the gap!  So insert the
square, close the panel and turn the switch on.  Shoooom! The computer comes to
life with a bewildering blinking of lights and gauges. They won't mean much to
an alien (you!), so don't bother trying to decipher them.  The object of this
lesson, though, is in an output hopper...a gold rod! Get the rod and insert it
in your basket.  We're off to locate a janitor and a chief!

 Go fore out of the Computer Room then go starboard and start heading aft until
you see the mechanical maintenance "mouse."  When you do find it, drop one of
the disks and do an occassional "examine receptacle" until you see the disk you
dropped in its receptacle.  Then head aft until you get to the farthest aft
yellow hall.  From there go port twice then fore twice and starboard twice.

 You are now in the Village Center of the Weasel's Warren. If the Weasel Chief
isn't here, wait until he arrives.  He will start pointing at your spacesuit.
When he does, give it to him. He will be very grateful and offer you his wives
and children, but don't accept them.  Instead do as he did and point to the
brown rod he has hanging around his neck!  When he gives you the brown rod,
he'll leave.  But don't lose him!  Follow him everywhere he goes.  If he stops
and is just standing there, do a "look" and he'll take off again. But whatever
you do, don't give up following him!

 Eventually, he'll lead you to the Center of the Warren and the entrance to a
green airlock, then he'll sit down and patiently await your return. So go down
to the airlock, and close the inner door. Open the outer door and exit into the
umbilical that's connecting the airlock to yet another alien spacecraft moored
port of here.  Inside, you find yourself in a cargo hold. Get the visor you see
lying here then go fore to the Control Room.  Shhhh! An alien commander's
skeleton reposes here in eternal sleep.  You seem to have discovered some sort
of altar, for scattered about are fruits and vegetables. Move the skeleton and
something falls to the ground.  It's a violet rod! Get the rod and insert it in
your basket.  Now you can also insert the brown rod in the basket.  You didn't
have a chance to do so before because you were so involved following the chief!
Now drop the other disk you have and step on it.  You're instantly transported
to....

 Say...where the heck are we?  Looks like some sort of garage or something. And
look over there...a garbage dumpster filled to overflowing with trash! Let's go
do some trash searching and see what we come up with.  Hmmm, there's our other
teleportation disk.  Further digging reveals all sorts of junk, but finally you
find a green rod! Get the green rod, insert it in your basket and let's get out
of here.  There's only one exit so go fore and you're in a room on Ring Four.
Go port twice, fore twice, starboard, fore and port.  You've found the
Observatory!  What a strange projection! Use the visor to look inside the
projector and you see a crystal clear rod there!  Get the rod and insert it in
your basket, drop the visor and go starboard.

 Time to get the artifact re-programmed and moving again! Go aft twice then up
to the Inner Region.  Go aft twice then starboard. You're at the base of a very
tall tree and it's climbable.  So go up the tree twice to the top.  Gravity is
very light up here and you can see, within jumping distance, a silver slot next
to a door leading into a Drive Bubble.  So jump and insert the silver rod into
the silver slot.  Glory be!  The door opens and you scamper inside.  There,
floating in the weightlessness of this place is a white rod. Get the white rod
and insert it into the white slot.  Now exit the Drive Bubble and go up on the
Drive Bubble.  On the other side of the Inner Region you can see the Control
Bubble.  But how to get there?  Well, let's jump to get started in that
direction.  Now if we just had a propellent of some sort.  Ah...the raygun!
Fir le.  So go down and insert the gold rod into the gold slot and enter the
Control Bubble.

 This is it, the very heart of the Artifact.  Looking around all you see is a
crystal clear slot.  Insert the crystal rod and long-dead machinery hums to life
and reveals five different colored slots...blue, green, violet, brown and pink!
Insert your remaining rods in their correspondingly colored slots.  As you do
so, spots of the same color appear next to each slot.  These spots are the
trajectory, speed, course and map controls. First press the large pink square
until you see the inner solar system from the Sun to Jupiter.  Now press the
brown spot until you see Earth displayed.  Select the speed of the Artifact by
pressing the green spot until you see a slowly flashing series of dots.
Finally, set the orbital course to a circular one by pressing the violet spot.
Now we're ready to start the Artifact heading toward Earth.  Press the blue spot
to start the age-old engines and look.  You're heading toward Earth in a slow,
grand trajectory!  As you approach Earth and slowly slide into permanent
planetal orbit, the viewscreen comes to life showing one of the Aliens who built
the Artifact.  His congratulations and warmth pour from the speakers and all
Earth rejoices with the return of the Galactic Overlord!

STUNT CAR RACER
LITTLE RAMP

 Take the first corner at full belt and tackle the ramp at 150 mph.

HUMPBACK

 Accelerate around to the hump, so that you reach 200 mph by the time you
 are half way up. At this speed you should have a fair jump and landing.
 On the other ramps, either keep below 130 mph or above 180 mph. Anything
 between these speeds will result in hefty damage. The rest of the track
 should be taken at about 170 mph.

BIG RAMP

 Take the first two small ramps at 170 mph, then get up to 210 mph for the
 main ramp. The rest of the course should be a doddle.

STEPPING STONES

 Head down the starting straight at 110 mph and take the second gap at 100
 mph. When you get to the steps, push up to 140 mph and nudge the speed up
 if it falls below 110 mph.

HIGH JUMP

 Get up to 210 mph from the start to clear the jump and keep under 200 mph
 for the small jump. You can tackle the slanted road in two ways - either
 keep at the top and keep the speed up, or give the car a nudge to the
 right every now and then. If you slip off, push fire and push forward and
 right instantly.

ROLLER COASTER

 Keep under 110 mph on the first hill and you should take the bumps fairly
 easily. Remember - don't push too hard!!

SKI JUMP

 Keep below 100 mph on the first hill and on the second keep to around 140
 mph, slowing down after the jump. For the big jump, get to about 220 mph,
 but if you can't manage it just crawl around and you'll live.

DRAWBRIDGE

 At the drawbridge, put the pedal to the floor when the bridge has gone down
 about halfway. Tackle all the hills for the next ramp at 140 mph, then on
 the bumpy section head down the middle of the track at 170 mph. Lastly, get
 up to top speed for the downhill jump.

UNINVITED
Complete Solve!

  Part 1

 What a night to be out driving! How it happened doesn't matter; but, boy, are
you in a mess. The last thing you remember is that something jumped out in
front of you while you and your little brother were out for an evening drive --
you swerved the car smack into a tree. The smell of a ruptured gas tank signals
your instinct to survive. You OPEN the car door and go out with your first move
. As soon as you click your mouse to get out of the car you hear an explosion
-- better get moving. With the car gone, you have no choice but to go inside
that haunted-looking house that looks like it came straight out of a comic book
.  Before you go inside the House, it would only be fitting to find out where
you are. A good place to check would be the mailbox. OPEN the mailbox. Guess
what?  It looks like you're in luck because there's a letter inside. EXAMINE
the envelope. Oh, no! You're at the Crowley House on 666 (sign of the Devil)
Blackwell Road, Loch Ness, Scotland. Loch Ness: doesn't that mean monsters? If
only you could turn around -- well it's too late. If you're in this much
trouble, you might as well snoop around some more. OPEN the envelope. EXAMINE
the letter. The letter contains a clue that the amulet might be good against
the undead. DRAG the amulet into your inventory. It might come in handy.

 Now OPEN the front door and go through it. What a creepy house. The door has
slammed shut behind you and it doesn't want to open up. What kind of trouble
are you in now? EXAMINE the various pictures and the furniture. After your
ordeal,  why don't you sit down (OPERATE) and rest your feet on either of the
chairs.  Ouch! One of the chairs hurt you! (Remember this: You'll want revenge
later.)  OPEN both doors. First, go inside the room to your east (all orientat-
ion in this game is northern).

 You're in the Library. Notice the book on the table. EXAMINE the book. OPEN
the book then EXAMINE the book again. There are some definitions that you would
be well advised to write down in your notebook. Go out of the Library back into
the Entrance Hall. Now go out the door to the northwest to the Hall. There are
five exits, including the one you just passed through. Your best bet is to go
upstairs first. Maybe that's where you'll find your little brother.

 The Upstairs Hallway has six exits, including the stairway you just came up.
OPEN all the doors. Now to check out all of the rooms. First, go through the
lower right door into the Storage Closet. EXAMINE all the items. Pretty mundane
stuff, huh? Bet you've never seen a product at the supermarket called "No Ghost"
DRAG the bottle into your inventory. "Spider Cider" looks interesting, too:
DRAG that along into your inventory, also. By this time, you'll get the first
signal that something is really wrong in this haunted house -- the evil is
starting to get to you in very tangible ways. Go back into the Upstairs Hallway.

Now go into the middle right door. Another stairwell! What's this? A weapon!
DRAG the axe into your inventory.   If you venture upstairs to the Tower, well all I can say is don't open the
Prison and don't go inside no matter how tempting it looks. It might be the
last thing you ever do! Go back to the Upstairs Hallway. Go through the door on
the lower left side into the Master Bedroom. On the nightstand is a candle and
a book. OPEN the book. DRAG the candle to your inventory. EXAMINE the book.
Well now you know the name of the bad guy -- Dracon, huh? "A key is hidden
someplace beyond his stare, a chair knows where."

 Go out of the room back into the Upstairs Hallway. Go down the stairs (south
exit). Go through the open door (upper right) back into the Entrance Hall.
Remember the chair that hurt you before? Now is the time for revenge! OPERATE
the axe on the chair. In the rip is a golden skeleton key. DRAG the key into
your inventory. Take the axe and leave it in the Entrance Hall -- it's too
large to carry for now. Now go straight back upstairs.

 From the Upstairs Hallway go into the first room on the left. OPERATE the key
on the large chest behind the bed. Now that the chest is unlocked, OPEN the
chest. Take everything from the chest and put it in your inventory. OPEN and
EXAMINE both scrolls. They contain clues that will be very important to
finishing the game. OPEN the door in the upper left corner. Though everything
in the room looks interesting, there is really nothing inside here that is
worthwhile. Go back into the Master Bedroom. EXAMINE the pictures on the wall.
They contain some clues to the Master's relationships with others.

 Go back into the Upstairs Hallway. Go through the door in the upper left
corner into the Bedroom. EXAMINE, then OPEN and, once again, EXAMINE the book
on the nightstand. Reading the egomaniacal rantings of Dracon gives you quite a
clue into just what you are up against. OPEN the nightstand. Aha, another
scroll!  OPEN and EXAMINE the scroll. The scroll contains some important magic
spells that use words you should be familiar with from the book in the library.
Write these spells down on your notepad; you will be needing them soon.

 OPEN the door in the upper right corner and go into the Bathroom. OPEN the
hamper. A blood stained towel -- yech! Could the blood belong to someone near
and dear, like your little brother? You had better find out soon. Go out of
the Bathroom through the Bedroom, back into the Upstairs Hallway. There is one
last room you haven't explored. Go into the room in the upper right corner.
  OPEN the black dresser and DRAG the star into your inventory. Go out of the
Bedroom,  through the Upstairs Hallway, and back downstairs to the Hall.

 Remember that bottle of "No Ghost"? You had better OPEN it just in case you
need it in a hurry. Now OPEN the lower right door. What's this? Out of nowhere
a woman dressed like Scarlet O'Hara has appeared in the Hall! Anyone dressed in
clothes from a century ago must be a ghost. OPERATE the bottle of "No Ghost"
on Scarlet and see what happens. Well, that takes care of that as another ghost
bites the dust.

   Part 2

 OPEN all the doors in the Hall. First, go through the lower right door that
you first opened before "Scarlet O'Ghost" pranced in. That takes you into the
Parlor.  OPEN the outside door and go to the Veranda. There's a quick spider
going by too fast for you to stop him. OPERATE the "Spider Cider" on the
railing. Go back in the Parlor. On second thought, go back outside on the
Veranda to see if the spider might come around again. Here it comes, slowing
down in its tracks due to the numbing effects of the "Spider Cider." Pretty
good stuff! DRAG the spider into your inventory. You never know when a spider
might come in handy for stirring up a brew or something. Go back through the
Parlor into the Hall again.

 Remove the "Spider Cider" and the "No Ghost" from your inventory and leave
them in the Hall. Go through the lower left door into the Rec Room. OPERATE the
gramophone. Pretty neat, huh? Too bad you broke it. It must be quite a valuable
antique on today's market. But, then again, a lot of the creepy things you see
in this house might fetch a high price at a graveyard auction.

 EXAMINE the cabinet at the back of the room. OPERATE the key on the cabinet.
OPEN the unlocked cabinet and SPEAK to the doll. Say "SPECAN HEAFOD ABRAXAS"
(like the scroll in Dracon's room said). The doll tells you to speak to her
brother. OPEN both remaining doors in the Rec Room. Go through the right side
door into the Dining Room.

 DRAG the flowers from the table into your inventory. EXAMINE all the pictures
in the room. Be aware that some strange things will float out of the pictures
as if they have a life of their own. OPEN all the doors in the Dining Room. Go
through the upper left door to the Kitchen first.

 OPEN both the left and right doors. Go through the room on your left to the
Bedroom. OPERATE the lamp. Something strange happens. (Actually, in this game,
everything is strange! So maybe what's strange for the real world is normal
here at 666 Blackwell Road.) Too bad that "No Ghost" was used up. Neither the
amulet nor the star has any effect on the ghost. Maybe the ghost is frightened
by small living animals the same way the mouse is legend for scaring elephants?

 OPERATE the spider on the ghost and it vanishes! EXAMINE, OPEN, then, again,
EXAMINE the diary that was hidden in the wall behind the picture. It contains
a clue for whatever is inside the box that was locked in the large chest
upstairs in the Master Bedroom.

 Fire and ice -- where to find either would be helpful right this moment. Go
out of the Bedroom through the Kitchen to the Pantry (the room off the Kitchen's
right). DRAG the box of matches from the second shelf from the top. OPEN the
matchbox. OPERATE one of the matches on the matchbox itself. OPERATE the newly
lit match on the candle you took earlier from the Master Bedroom. Great! Now
that should shed some light on the situation. Everything in the Kitchen, the
Pantry, and the downstairs Bedroom is interesting but will not help you to
complete the game. In fact the more mouse clicks that you waste in these
rooms, the more time you lose. And those mouse clicks become valuable with time.

 Go out of the Pantry through the Kitchen back into the Dining Room. Go through
