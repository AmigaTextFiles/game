Why another Editor?

I usually get VERY angry when something happens to my 'men' in games
such as Pirates! and Gunship. Since that isn't very good for my health
and the surrounding things, I program an editor instead of kicking the shit
out of the house walls.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(And, of course, it's really fun coding these editors)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

How do you use Bridge Over Troubled Water ?

Simply type 'botw' followed by the name of (and path to) your saved captain.
Don't add the .pir extension. (OK, maybe I should have allowed you to do
that, but...) 

botw loads and shows you an info display and a menu.

1...Change Name Of Captain. Self Explaining.

2...Personal Status.

	Here you may alter your personal wealth. Follow the on-screen prompts
	and enter what you want. I don't recommend that you enter more
	than 600000 gold pieces or so, coz' it MAY go around and get negative.
	(Not nice, stupid!)

3...Party Status

	Alter amount of men, guns, cargo, gold. 
	As mentioned above, strange things may occur if you enter
	crazy values.

4...Ships
	
	Follow the on-screen instructions to expand your fleet.
	When you select this option, all damaged ships will be automatically
	repaired. 

	'Extra cargo what-ever-it-is-called' (Short Memory)
	If you answer 'y' here, you'll get 780 tons extra cargo hold.
	(This little option is rather funny, 'coz it really looks great
	 with a 800 ton pinnace...)

	I think you loose the extra cargo space when you divide the plunder,
	but I havn't tried it.

5...Quit and Save  
	
	If you don't understand this, sell your Amiga.

DISCLAIMER:

Werner's Hint About Editing Pirates! Gamesaves:

Always Divide the plunder before you start editing. This makes sure
that you don't get 3000 angry crewmembers.
