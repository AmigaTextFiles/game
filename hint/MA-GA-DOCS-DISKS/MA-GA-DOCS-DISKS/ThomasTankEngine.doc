Control Thomas as he tries to complete all of his tasks before the week is over.

 You must avoid the other trains on the track otherwise you might crash.

 On the normal level you will also have to watch your speed as there are 
objects that have fallen onto the track. You will have to find another way
round them. 

 You may come off the track if you try to go around the corners to quickly.

 Complete each task before the sun goes down or the jobs will be given to 
another engine.

So come on and help Thomas complete all is tasks - it's GREAT FUN !!!
