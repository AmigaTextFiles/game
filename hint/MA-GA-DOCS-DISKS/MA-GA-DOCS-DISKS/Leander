LEANDER (THANATOS TREVENGE)
---------------------------
IT WAS PRINCESS LUCANNAS 18TH BIRTHDAY. THE WHOLE OF HONSHU SEEMED TO BE THERE
FOR THE CELEBRATIONS.FROM THE MOMENT LUCANNA ROSE TO MEET THE SUN SHE WAS
SHOWERED WITH WONDERFUL GIFTS.DRAGONS DANCED FOR HER,MAGICIANS CAST BEAUTIFUL
SPELLS FOR HER AND ENCHANTING MUSIC PLAYED FROM DAWN TO DUSK.THE PRINCESS
LAUGHED AND SANG HER WAY THROUGH WHAT SHE THOUGHT WOULD BE THE BEST DAY OF HER
LIFE.

FROM THE FILTHY PIT OF ANGUISH,HE ROSE.TOWERING ABOVE HIS ONE TIME-PRISON,HE
BREATHED DEEP THE FRESH AND FRAGRANT AIR OF THE NEW DAY.
LIFTING HIS MAGNIFICENT HEAD,THANATOS SCREAMED HIS FREEDOM AT THE CLEAR BLUE
SKY.THE CHILLING SOUND ECHOED EEERILY ACROSS THE LAND,THUNDER ROLLED THROUGH
THE DISTANT HILLS AND THE BLUE SKY DARKENED TO A LIFLESS GREY. THANATOS CLOSED
HIS EYES AND SMILED..`FREE,AT LAST!`

DRIFTING ON AN ETHERAL CARPET OF ABSOLUTE EVIL HE LOOKED DOWN AT THE PIT THAT
HAD HELD HIM PRISONER FOR SO LONG AND FELT PURE HATRED.THEY HAD DONE THIS TO
HIM.TRAPPED HIM WITH THEIR TRICKS AND LIES.WELL,NOW IT WAS TIME REVENGE.THEY
WOULD KNOW THE ANGUISH AND TORMENT HE HAD ENDURED FOR THE LAST 1000 YEARS,AND
THEY WOULD LOOK DEATH IN THE FACE,AND KNOW FEAR!,YES THEY WOULD KNOW FEAR....

THE PRINCESS`S DAY WENT ALL TO QUICKLY AND EVEN THOUGH SHE PRAYED IT WOULD LAST
FOREVER,THE SUN SLOWLY BEGAN TO SINK TOWARDS THE HORIZON,SIGNIFYING AN END TO
CELEBRATIONS. THE MUSIC PLAYED MORE SOFTLY THROUGH THE HALLS OF KIROMO,NOW.NO
MORE DANCING DRAGONS,NO MORE MAGIC SPELLS...NO MORE GIFTS.
LUCANNA WALKED OUT TO THE GARDEN WHERE THE SOUND OF MUSIC WAS REPLACED BY THE
QUIET GIGGLING OF RUNNING WATER AND THE SONG OF THE BIRDS PREPARING TO ROOST.
THE LITTLE DOG LUCANNA HAD BEEN GIVEN BY COUSIN SUSONNE SNUGGLED CLOSE TO HER
NECK TO KEEP AWAY THE CHILL OF DUSK.
LUCANNA SAT BY THE STREAM AND THOUGHT ABOUT HER DAY..BRIGHT COLOURS AND SOUNDS
FILLED HER MIND AS SHE REMEMBERED THE ENCHANTMENT OF THE PREVIOUS HOURS.

THANATOS LUXURIATED IN THE RUSHING OF THE WIND AS HE RACED TOWARDS THE TEMPLE
OF KIROMO.DEATH AND DECAY SHADOWED HIM AND THE EARTH OVER WHICH HE
FLEW;CREATURES OF LAND,SEA AND AIR MUTATED INTO MOCKERY OF THEIR FORMER SELVES
AND DEADLY TRAPS MANIFESTED INTO THE VERY GROUND ITSELF THANATOS FLEW FASTER
WHEN HE ESPIED HONSHU ON THE HORIZON.HIS MOUTH WATERED WITH THE EXPECTATION OF
VENGEANCE,REVENGE WOULD TASTE SWEET.

LUCANNA STROKED HER DOG AND WATCHED THE GARDEN SLOWLY FADE TO GREY,SHE HUMMED
QUIETLY TO THE ANIMAL AS SHE UNWOUND FROM THE EXCITEMENT OF THE DAY.
THE DOG SAT BOLT UPRIGHT,ITS EARS PRICKED.
LUCANNA SPOKE REASSURINGLY TO HER NEW PET BUT SHE HERSELF FELT SOMETHING
STRANGE IN THE AIR.THE COLD THAT SUDDENLY POURED OVER HER WAS INTENSE AND IT
FELT STRANGELY CLAMMY AGAINST HER SKIN. A SUDDEN RUSH OF AIR WHIPPED AROUND
HER,BENDING TREES AND SHRUBS AND UPROOTING FLOWERS AS IT RACED THROUGH THE
GARDEN.
FEAR CLAWED AT LUCANNAS THROAT.THE DOG YELPED AND LEAPT FROM HER GRASP,SHE
TRIED TO RACE AFTER IT BUT FOUND THE WIND TOO STRONG TO FIGHT AGAINST.

`ARE YOU SURE YOU DONT WANT THE LATE DUTY, LEANDER?.I HEAR THE PRINCESS IS IN
THE GARDEN`.
`YES.AND SHE MAY WANT A HAND CONTOLLING THAT VICIOUS ANIMAL,SUSONNE GAVE HER
FOR HER BIRTHDAY!`
`COME ON LEANDER,WHY DONT YOU CONFESS THAT YOU LOVE PRINCESS LUCANNA?`
`AND DREAM OF HER BEING YOUR BRIDE`

right enough of this drivel..theres 2 more pages of him staring at her and
wanting to marry her...ect..so i`ve started from the main part FIRSTLY THE 
NASTY GUY THANATOS HAS HAD IT AWAY WITH PRINCESS LUCANNA AND ITS HIT `LEANDER` 
PRETTY BADLY 

LEANDER!.SHOUTED THE GUARD,THE EMPEROR WANTS TO SEE YOU....

A SUMMONS FROM EMPEROR ETOROSHI WAS NOT A THING TO TAKE LIGHTLY,LEANDER RAN TO
THE IMPERIAL THRONE ROOM.
2 MAGNIFICENT GOLDEN DOORS SILENTLY SWEPT OPEN AS LEANDER APPROACHED THE THRONE
ROOM,IN THE FLICKERING LIGHT,HE COULD SEE,AT THE FAR SIDE OF THE ROOM,THE
EMPEROR KNEELING BEFORE THE GHOST-LIKE IMAGE OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.LEANDER
LOOKED IN AWE AT THE FACE OF JANOON,MYSTICAL AID TO THE EMPEROR,AND HE TOO
DROPPED TO HIS KNEES.

JANOON SPOKE TO ETOROSHI BRIEFLY BEFORE GLANCING AT LEANDER.THE EMPEROR TURNED
HIS HEAD TOWARDS THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD AND AS HE DID SO,JANOONS IMAGE FADED.

EROTOSHI GOT TO HIS FEET AND BECKONED LEANDER TO APPROACH.LEANDER STOOD AND
WALKED,HEAD BOWED,TOWARDS THE EMPEROR.

`IT IS A DARK DAY FOR HONSHU,LEANDER.WHAT THANATOS HAS DONE MUST BE QUICKLY
UNDONE IF WE ARE TO SURVIVE AND CONQUER THE EVIL THAT IS NOW SPREADING ACROSS
THE LAND.THANATOS WILL USE LUCANNAS LIFE FORCE TO REPLENISH HIS OWN...SHE WILL
DIE AND HE WILL FLOURISH.THEN WE SHALL ALL DIE.`

THE EMPEROR SAT ON HIS THRONE AND HEAVED A GREAT SIGH.

JANOON HAS SPOKEN TO ME.SHE TOLD ME OF YOUR LOVE FOR LUCANNA...LEANDER LOOKED
UP....DO NOT WORRY,LEANDER;IT IS YOUR DESTINY.AND THAT CAN NEVER BE DENIED,FOR
IT IS THE LOVE YOU FEEL FOR MY DAUGHTER THAT WILL SAVE OUR LAND.YOUR FEELINGS
FOR MY DAUGHTER.AND HERS FOR YOU,WILL HELP PROTECT YOU AGAINST THE EVIL OF
THANATOS.YOU,LEANDER,MUST MUSTER ALL YOUR STRENGTH AND BRAVERY TO FACE THANATOS
CHALLENGE AND FREE LUCANNA.HOWEVER,YOU WILL NOT BE ALONE.JANOONS THREE SIRENS
WILL GUIDE YOU THROUGH EACH OF THE THREE WORLDS.THEIR HELP WILL BE LIMITED,
I`M AFRAID,BUT INVALUABLE TO YOUR SUCESS.

SAY NOTHING,LEANDER.GO NOW,AND FACE YOUR DESTINY.I AWAIT YOUR RETURN.....

HINTS AND TIPS.
---------------
KILL LEANDERS MOMENTUM BY PULLING THE JOYSTICK IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO THE
WAY HE`S WALKING FOR A FRACTION OF A SECOND.THIS WILL HELP HIM LAND ON SMALL
PLATFORMS AND LEDGES AND PREVENT HIM GETTING A SPIKE UP HIS WOTSIT.

PREDICT THE PATHS OF FAST MOVING PLATFORM;JUMP TO LAND ON THEM WHEN THEY ARE
TRAVELLING TOWARDS YOU.IF YOU JUMP WHEN THEY`RE CLOSEST TO YOU THEY WONT BE
THERE BY THE TIME YOU LAND!..AND YOU MAY HAVE ANOTHER NASTY EXPERIENCE WITH A
SPEAR.

LEARN THE HABITS OF ENEMIES;THERE ARE NO RANDOM PATHS IN `LEANDER`

USE YOUR COINAGE WISELY;DONT GO BUYING FUNKY WEAPONS WHEN YOU HAVE ONLY 2
HIT-POINT ARMOUR.WHAT USE IS A BIG WEAPON TO A DEAD HERO?

WHEN LEANDER LOSES A LIFE(AS LONG AS ITS NOT HIS LAST ONE)HE WILL RETURN TO THE
SCREEN AND FLASH FOR ABOUT 5 SECONDS,DURING THIS TIME(IF HE DOESNT GET
ARRESTED)HE IS INVINCIBLE TO ENEMY BLOWS - BUT THOSE SPEARS CAN STILL DO HIM A
LOT OF HARM!!

THE QUEEN SPIDER.
-----------------
TO DEFEAT THE QUEEN SPIDER AND COLLECT THE TELEPORT KEY YOU WILL NEED TO
DESTROY HER HEAD FIRST THEN HER TAIL AND FINALLY HER STOMACH.

GIANT OTTER.
------------
THIS CREATURE MUST BE HIT MANY,MANY TIMES.HOWEVER,ONE STRIKE OF HIS CLAWS AND
ITS CURTAINS

THANATOS.
---------
YOU WILL NEED TO COLLECT A POWERFUL SWORD BEFORE YOU CAN HOPE TO DEFEAT
THANATOS.
