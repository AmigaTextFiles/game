             THIS IS A WALKTHROUGH-YOU WILL GET DIRECT ANSWERS

Getting your paws on the Pages and Getting friendly with the Simulator

     You are facing a gear. Proceed inside the fortress. Go left. As you
enter the room, face the throne. There is a small indentation on the bottom
right-hand corner. If you click on it, a door appears. Go inside. Inside
the bottles is the red page. You can grab it and skip to the rest of my
instructions. To get the blue page, go into the other room. There is a
wierd looking object next to the throne. It's a simulator. Next to the
throne is an indentation where the blue page is. (Also amoung the rooms on
a wine shelf is a note from Achenar to Sirrus. Achenar claims that Sirrus
is greedy)
     Go over to the simulator. It demonstrates the rotating of the Island.
Push up the left handle, then the right. Pulling them back down again after
rototating will yield a sound depending on the degree of rotation. You will
need to be familiar with all 4 sounds for 90, 180, 270, and 360 degrees. 90
degrees sounds like a high ping, 180 like a spring coiling, 270 like a bird
flapping its wings, and 360 is a dull, hollow, metallic sound.

Finding and using the Elevator

     If you retreat into the hallway, you will see a small red button on
the wall. When you click it, the floor drops down. You will see a display
with two upside-down "c"'s. Line them up until they are red in color. Turn
around and go back up the stairs, click the red button (thus elevating the
floor back again). Walk into the elevator.
     In the elevator, choose the "up" button. Once on the top floor, click
the middle button and hurry and get out of the elevator. It will descend
the half a floor and you can climb in top of it. There are controls on top
of the elevator. You can now rotate the fortress by pushing first the left
and then the right lever, waiting, and then pulling them both back down to
check your progress. You need to move it 180 degrees. (Spring coiling
sound)

The Islands, mon! and Getting back to MYST

     Rotate the island 180 degrees and 90 degrees to get to those
respective islands. Each one holds 2 of the 4 symbols that you will need to
enter to get back to MYST. There really isn't anything on the islands but
the symbols. (remember, the second time around to get the page you didn't
get before-don't move the fortress! Just grab the page and enter the
symbols. It's still the same!) Once you have the 4 symbols, simply enter
them into the machine on the original island you started at (yes you have
to move the fortress back!). The symbols are: 1. upside down "c", 2.
opposite pointing triangles flanking a retangular box, 3. three small
triangles pointing up towards a ball, and 4. the left side half of a full
moon. Hit the red button, and the MYST book appears. Click and get home!
