             THIS IS A WALKTHROUGH-YOU WILL GET DIRECT ANSWERS

Finding the Pages and "Buttons"

     You start in the spaceship. After you step off the path, you pass a
door on your right. Two clicks forward from the door, turn and face left.
If you follow the path, you will come to a small creek or stream that you
can hear. There is both a button to press, and the blue page here. The
button turns on a microphone. There are 5 microphones in all, and 5
different symbols for each. Get back on the main path. Go up the the stairs
in front and to the left of you. Click on the button at the top of these
stairs. You can hear the volcano like chasm. Get back on the path and go
until the large clock. Click on this microphone. Continue forward and take
a right at the fork. Continue down the path, down some stairs, and find a
mike for a tower looking symbol. You will find the red page here. Retrace
your steps back to the fork. Go right. You will find the final button to
click at the wind symbol.

Playing with what is known in MYST circles as: the Rebroadcast Station

     There is ladder here, go down it. Turn on the light. Turn around and
walk down the tunnel. Climb the ladder, and climb the stairs. There will be
a box looking thing with metal doors. Click it to open. There are tuner
buttons, 5 symbol buttons, and a "sigma" or playback button. The objext
here is to "tune" in the sounds of each object with where they are on the
display. You can do this by hand, letting the display tell you when you are
close (the hand will blink a lot). Or, you can enter the following numbers.
To enter them, click on the symbol for stream, volcano, clock, tower, or
wind, tune in the number, and move on to the last one.
     stream --- 153.4
     volcano --- 130.3
     clock --- 55.6
     tower --- 15
     wind --- 212.2
     After entering the numbers, press the sigma or playback key and listen
close. The order played back is different. You need this order to get into
the shack. The order is: tower, stream, wind, volcano, clock. Enter them
into the panel on the shack you passed earlier. Push the button and enter!

I'm inside the shack-Now what?

     This demented donkey-kong country nintendo action sucks. It takes
forever of trial and error to map out where to go. Just follow these
instructions: Get into the driver's seat and press "FORWARD". Here are the
steps:
N, W, N, E, E, S, S, W, SW, W, NW, NE, N, SE, exit the vehicle, click on
the book and get back to MYST.
