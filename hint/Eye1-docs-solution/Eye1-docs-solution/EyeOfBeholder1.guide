@{b}THE MEETING@{ub}

Piergeiron, the chief Lord of Waterdeep, has called the party to a meeting and
gives you the following letter:

 Piergeiron,

  I have investigated your concerns, my friend, and I am afraid the news
is not good. More than that, it is maddenin and frustrating. THe signs
of evil are clear, as you know, and growing. Before I left I heard
rumors of assissins in the city, by Tyr, in Waterdeep! I am not sure
what to believe anymore.

  I have visited both Amn and Calimshan, these cities have given us
trouble in the past. I suspected that our problems now might be their
doing, but I find no evidence of it. My informants seem clear on this
point at least. None have even heard of our elusive Xanathar. No, these
traces of evil are not from outside Waterdeep, but from within...or
perhaps below? My magics did detect the evil, but not its source. All of
our attempts to find its cause have been for naught. The only thing we
have "learned" is that the name Xanathar recurs with grave persistence.
When have we NOT looked, Paladinson my friend? Where is it the City
Watch never patrol? Where would YOU hide from the Watch and the Lords of
Waterdeep without leaving the area of the city? I can only think that we
are overlooking something under our very noses.

  I will return to the Council soon, my investigations here are clearly
fruitless. But do not wait for me - hire adventurers as the others have
suggested. They may not have our biases. Perhaps a new outlook will
help.

Your trusted friend,

Khelben

@{b}THE COMMISION  @{ub}

  "The sewers" Piergeiron says. "I would hide in the sewers. And that is
where I think you should start". He hands you an official document with
the seal of Waterdeep prominently displayed.

@{b}COMMISSION AND LETTER OF MARQUE @{ub}

  This document is a binding commission of service to the Lords and
sovereign city of Waterdeep. THe bearers of this document are agents of
the Lords of Waterdeep and are granted full rights of passage beneath
the city of Waterdeep. Any who would dare interfere risk the full
penalty or our wrath.

  Information has been presented to us that there is a plot afoot in our
city. Evidence points to the sewers that run beneath Waterdeep. We have
no information about the exact nature of teh threat, but we feel the
urgency is grave. We commission you to find the nature of the danger;
and to destroy it if you are able.

  You are granted full rights of marque. All treasures, artifacts, or
other valuables are yours by right of conquest.

  This writ is made legal and binding bu our mark on this fifth day of
Marpenoth in the year of Shadows.

@node INTRODUCTION "INTRODUCTION"
@{b}INTRODUCTION@{ub}

@{b}THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER WORLD @{ub}

  Eye of the Beholder is an all 3-D, Legend Series computer role-playing
adventure based on the popular Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition
game rules and an original story created for this game. The action takes
place in the sewers and catacombs beneath the City of Waterdeep in TSR'S
FORGOTTEN REALMS game world.

  Everything in Eye of the Beholder is from your point of view. Watch the
walls pass by as you move through the sewers beneath the ancient city of
Waterdeep. Pick up itms by grabbing them. Open doors with keys or by
pressing buttons or pulling release levers. See monsters draw nearer to
you and close for battle. Attack by using the weapons your characters
have in their hands, or cast spells by using your clerics' or paladins'
holy symbols and your mages' spell book icons. Those in the front of the
party may attack with weapons suck as swords and maces, while characters
in the rear ranks may attack with spells or ranged weapons such as bows.

  A key to playing Eye of the Beholder is understanding the difference
between Take, Use, and Select. Taking involoves actions suck as pickup
or dropping items. Using involves actions suck as attacking monsters
with weapons, or indicating that a cleric or mage wishes to cast a
spell. You can only Use items from the main Adventure Screen. Selecting
involoves choosing buttons such as spell Level Buttons or the Camp
Button, or choosing from lists such as picking spells to cast or
memorize. Exactlyhow to Take, Use, or Select items and options with your
mouse or keyboard (some systems only) is described in the DATACARD.

  This Rule Book explains how to play the game, the effect of magic
spells, and so on. THe Actions section explains specifically how to
perform a number of activities in the game.

  The Data Card contains information on how to load the game and play it
on your specific computer. It also explains how to get right into the
game with the pre-built party.


@{b}COPY PROTECTION @{ub}

  There is no physical copy protection on your Eye of the Beholder disks,
so please make copies and put the originals away for safekeeping.

To assure that you have a legitamate copy of the game there will be a
verification question whenever you begin playing the game (Not any more,
hahaha). A picture will be displayed on the screen. You must find the
matching illustration in the upper right-hand corner of the Rule Book,
and answer a question from that page.

@{b}PLAYER REFERENCE @{ub}

@{b}Characters @{ub}

  Your adventuring party is made up of up to four characters, each with
his or her own unique strengths and weaknesses. Every character has a
race, class, and set of attribute scores. Race is the charater's species
and there are six races to choose from: dwarf, elf, gnome, half-elf,
halfling, and human. Class is the character's occupation. Some races are
allowed to have more than one class simultaneously, these are called
multi-class characters. The basic choices of class are: cleric, fighter,
mage, paladin, thief, or multi-class. Attribute scores define the
character's physical and mental prowess, and they are: strength,
dexterity, intelligence, wisdom, and charisma.

@{b}RACES @{ub}

@{b}DWARVES @{ub}

   Dwarves  are a short, heavily built demihuman race. They stand between 4
and 4 1/2 feet tall, but generally weigh more than 150 punds due to
their heavily muscled build. Dwarves live from 350 to 450 years. They
are famous for their skill in all manner of crafts, from metalworking to
stone masonry. Dwarven weapons command high prices in markets around the
world, and pieces of theif fine jewelry are literally part of every
king's ransom. In addtion to intricate workmanship, dwarves are known
for tremendous courage and tenacity that borders on the fanatic.
Dwarves are by nature non-magical, and have innate resistances to spells
as well as many poisons.

although they are known to be fiercely loyal to friends.

carefree and lively. Never turn your back on a gnome however - they are

taller and heavier than most elves, approaching human norms. While not
as long-lived as true elces, they live, on average, about 250 years. For
the most part, half-elves can travel and mingle in both elvish and human

Typically they live around 70 years. Human societies are more

acquisitive. Where the longer-lived races wait patiently and take a
long-range view of the world, humans tend to muster theif efforts for
immediate gain.
 @{b}Ability Score Modifiers: @{ub}None
 @{b}Allowable Classes: @{ub}Cleric, Fighter, Mage, Paladin, Ranger, Thief
 @{b}Level Restrictions: @{ub}None

@{b}CLASSES @{ub}

  Each class has its own unique strengths, and each offers valuable
talents and skills to a party. Fighter-types - fighters, rangers, and
paladins - are needed to battle past the creatures that stand in the way
of victory and glory. Thieves are very handy when the party runs acrooss
traps. Mages offer powerful spells, and clerics can both fight and
heal the wounded.

  Each class has one or more prime requisites, or ability scores that are
important to the class. A character with prime requisite score(s) or 16
or greater advances somewhat faster in levels.


@{b}CLERICS @{ub}

   Clerics  are warrior priest, men and women who carry their faith in their
weapon-arms as well as theif hearts. Cleric training includes the use of
divine magic and a limited selection of weapons. They can use any type
of armor, but their selection of arms is limited to blunt, impact-type
weapons such as maces and flails.

  Cleric magic differs from mage spells in that cleric magic is of divine
origin. Clerics do not carry tomes of spells and rituals. They receive
power directly from the gods and cast spells through their holy symbols.
While mages study and pour over their spells to imprint the rituals in
their minds, clerics enter a meditative trance where they are receptive
to the divine magic. Clerics also have powers again undead monsters such
as skeletons and zombies. Clerics automatically attempt to turn undead,
driving them away, or possibly even destroying them. As clerics advance
in level then gain more spells and greater power against undead. Clerics
with wisdon of 13 or higher gain extra spells (See Cleric Wisdom Bonus
Table).
 @{b}Prime Requisite: @{ub}Wisdom
 @{b}Races Allowed: @{ub}Human, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Half-Elf, Halfling
 @{b}Weapons Allowed: @{ub}Mace, Flail, Staff, Sling

@{b}FIGHTERS @{ub}

   Fighters  are warriors, experts in weaponskills and battle tactics.
Fighter training includes use and maintenance of all manner of weapons
and armor. Fighters can use any type of armor or weapon without
restriction. Whether for glory or profit, fighters can be found in the
thickest parts of battles, where only skill and bravery triumph.
Fighters cannot cast any type of magical spell, nor would they as a rule
want to, preferring to rely on a strong sword-arm. They can use any type
of magical weapon or armor and magic items such as rings and gauntlets.
Fighters gain speed as well as skill when they go up in levels. High
level fighter-types including fighters, paladins, and rangers, are able
to attack more often with melee weapons such as swords than other types
of characters.
 @{b}Prime Requisite: @{ub}Strength
 @{b}Races Allowed: @{ub}All
 @{b}Weapons Allowed: @{ub}All

@{b}MAGES @{ub}

   Mages  are individuals trained in the arcane and mysterious secrets of
magic and spellcasting gestures. mages tend to be poor fighters,
preferring to rely on their intellect and magical abilities. While
warriors and clerics may charge to the fore of a battle, mages tend to
hang back and pummel foes with mystic attacks. Mages tend to be
reclusive and spend most of their time researching new spells and
ancient magical lore.

  Mages cannot wear any type of armor. This is because they have no
training or aptitude for martial skills, and armor is restrictive and
interferes with some spellcasting. Also because of their lack of martial
inclination, mages are severly limited in the weapons they can use.
Mages become very powerful as they increase in level.
 @{b}Prime Requisite: @{ub}Intelligence
 @{b}Races Allowed: @{ub}Human, Elf, Half-Elf
 @{b}Weapons Allowed: @{ub}Dagger, Staff, Dart

@{b}PALADINS @{ub}

   Paladins  are elite warriors who battle in the name of Truth and Justice.
Lawfulness and good deeds are their meat and drink, and they lead lives
of such chaste piety that even clerics stand respectful. Paladins will
not join a party that includes evil characters. Like other high level
fighter-types, paladins are able to attack more often with melee
weapons, such as swords, than other types of characters.

  In addition to skill in all types of arms and armor, paladins have
seceral divine magical abilities conferred for their piety. Paladins
have extra resistance to magical attacks and poison. Paladins are immune
to all disease. Paladins can heal once per day (2 hit points per level
of advancement). They are always surrounded by a Protection Versus Evil
aura that encompasses the entire party. All evil attackers suffer a
small penalty to their attacks if a paladin is in the party.
At third-level, paladins can turn undead as a cleric two levels below
their own. At ninth-level, paladins gain the ability to cast certain
cleric spells, although they can never use cleric scrolls. Paladins pray
for their spells and cast them exactly as clerics.
Paladins can use the following cleric spells:
Bless, Cure Light Wounds, Detect Magic, Protection From Evil, Slow
Poison.
 @{b}Prime Requisites: @{ub}Strength, Charisma
 @{b}Races Allowed: @{ub}Only Human
 @{b}Weapons Allowed: @{ub}All

@{b}RANGERS @{ub}

   Rangers  are trained hunters, trackers, and woodsmen. They are taught to
live as much but their wits and skills as by their swords and bows. Like
fighters, rangers can use any type of weapon or armor, although heavy
armor interferes with their special abilities.

  When wearing studded leather or lighterarmor, rangers can fight with
weapons in both hands without any penalties. Like other high level
fighter-types, rangers are able to attack more often with melee weapons,
such as swords, than other types of characters.
 @{b}Prime Requisites: @{ub}Strength, Dexterity, Wisdom
 @{b}Races Allowed:@{ub} Human, Elf, Half-Elf
 @{b}Weapons Allowed: @{ub}All

@{b}THIEVES @{ub}

   Thieves  are hard to clasify as a group. Some are malcontents, who prey
on the unsuspecting. Others are basically good, but are a little wanting
in strength of character. Adventurers long ago learned that a skilled
thief in the party increases overall party survival - espicially when
dealing with trapped locks. As thieves gain levels they become more
proficient at picking locks, and avoiding any attached traps.
Because they need to move freely and quietly thieves' abilities are
restricted when they wear anything except leather-type armor. Thieves
have a greater choice of weapons than clerics or mages, but less than
fighter-types.
 @{b}Prime Requisites: @{ub}Dexterity
 @{b}Races Allowed: @{ub}All
 @{b}Weapons Allowed: @{ub}Any


@{b}Alignment @{ub}

  Alignment describes a character's outlook and how he deals with life.
The possibilities encompass a range of views from believing strongly in
society and altruism (Lawful Good) to completely selfish and without any
regard for others (Chaotic Evil). Alignment is presented in two parts:
the character's world view and personal ethics.

@{b}World View @{ub}

   Lawful indicates that the character understands himself to work
within the frameworks and rules of a society.

  Neutral indicates that the character moves between valuing society and
its rules, and the value of the individual.

  Chaotic indicates that the character values the individual (himself)
above society and others.

@{b}Ethics @{ub}

  Good indicates the character tries to act in a moral and upstanding
manner.

  Neutral indicates the character leans towards "situational ethics,"
evaluating each set of circumstances.

  Evil indicates the character acts either with no regard for others or
in an overly malignant manner.

@node THECHARACTERSTHATMAKEUPTHEPARTY "The characters that make up the party"
@{b}THE CHARACTERS @{ub}

There are many strategies for putting together an effective party of
characters. Certain combinations of character classes and race are
more effective than others.

@{b}Single-Class vs. Multi-Class @{ub}

Non-human characters can be multi-classed characters, but that does not
mean that they must be multi-class characters. Single-class characters
have a number of advantages over multi-classed characters with the same
amount of EXP.

Single-class fighters have several advantages. With the same amount of
EXP, they will average many more HP and have a better chance to hit than
multi-class fighter combinations.

Single-class clerics and mages will gain higher level spells much sooner
than multi-class cleric or mage combinations. Spell casters become much
more useful when they reach 5th level and can cast the 3rd level spells
Fireball and Create Food.

Characters can more effectively specialize in EOB than in other AD&D
computer role playing games. With careful play, rear rank characters
will seldom get into melee combat. This makes a single-class mage a
viable character by reducing the effect of his limited abilities in
melee. Also, the real time nature of EOB means that a character can only
do one thing at a time; a character's ability to do many different
things is often not as important as the ability to do one thing very
well.

The advantages of multi-classed characters are obvious, they combine
the abilities of several different classes of character in one. Thus,
fighter/mage can both melee effectively and cast spells, though he can
do neither as well as a single-class fighter or mage with the same
amount of EXP. Multi-classed characters are often useful to add an
additional capability to a party, such as thieving skills or additional
clerical healing spells.

@{b}Racial Advantages @{ub}

Because of the monsters and situations in EOB, certain race/class
combinations are very effective. The following are some specific types
of characters and their advantages.

@{b}Dwarven Fighter: @{ub}A dwarven fighter with a high constitution has a high
resistance to poison, which makes it much easier to fight giant spiders.
A dwarf fighter can also have a Constitution of 19, which can further
increase his HP. A dwarf also allows the party to read the writing on the
wall in the dwarvish levels of the game.

@{b}Human Paladin:@{ub} Only humans can he paladins. Paladins can fight as well
as any fighter, plus they have the ability to heal by laying on hands
and, they have the ability to cast some low level clerical healing
spells when they reach ninth level.

@{b}Elven Mage: @{ub}A single-class mage gains levels swiftly and will quickly
gain the ability to cast useful spells like Fireball. An elven mage
with a high dexterity has a high AC, which makes it easier to survive
stray thrown weapons. As a mage, an elf's maximum constitution of 17
does not limit his HP and his maximum dexterity of 19 can increase his
AC. As mages cannot wear armor to increase their AC, a high dexterity
is essential to a mage. An elf also allows the party to read the writing
on the wall in the drow levels of the game.

@{b}Human, Half Elven, or Elven Cleric: @{ub}A single-class cleric swiftly gains
levels and the ability to cast useful spells like Create Food. Humans,
Half Elves and Elves can all have a maximum wisdom of 18 (thus gaining
the maximum bonus spells) and have no level restrictions in this game.

@{b}Half Elven Fighter/Mage/Cleric: @{ub}This is the character with the most
diverse talents in the game. This character can use almost every item in
the game (excluding lockpicks), and has a limited ability to fight, can
cast offensive spells, and heal. Unfortunately, a half elven fighter/mage/
cleric will go up levels extremely slowly, and will have very few HP for
most of the game.

@{b}Elven Fighter/Mage/Thief: @{ub}The thiefly counterpart to the half elven jack
of all trades listed before. This character can use literally every
item in the game and can pick locks as well. Unfortunately, an elven
fighter/mage/thief will also go up levels extremely slowly, and will
have very few HP for most of the game.

@{b}Gnome Cleric/Thief: @{ub}A gnomish cleric/thief makes a good character to
fill out a party that already has a single-class cleric. The cleric/
thief gives the party additional clerical healing spells plus the
thieving ability of picking locks.


@{b}The Party @{ub}

A party should include a good mix of classes and races to deal with the
many honors in EOB. The player will need to decide upon his overall party
strategy before making the characters in his party.

In general, a party should have at least two characters who can fight
well for the front rank, a character who can cast mage spells, and at
least one character who can cast clerical healing spells.

@{b}Fighters  @{ub}

The party has many choices for the two front rank characters who can
fight well. Most races make reasonable fighters, and fighter, paladin,
and ranger class characters can all fight well. Even single-class cleric
and dual class fighter/cleric characters can be effective front rank
characters in the beginning levels of the game. Also, most of the NPC
characters the party meets later in the game can fight well and could be
used in the front rank.

@{b}Spell Casters @{ub}

The choice of the various spell casters is also important to the
strategy of the party. One character who can cast mage spells is
normally sufficient for most parties. Mages must find their higher
level spells on scrolls; the supply of scrolls is limited, so it is not
efficient to divide those spells among several mages in a party.

It is often useful to have two characters who can cast clerical healing
spells. It is important not to get caught after a battle without a
conscious cleric. A conscious cleric with a few Cure Light Wounds spells
can heal as many HP in hours, as a party without a conscious cleric
could heal in many days of rest.

@{b}Party Makeup @{ub}

One strategy is to create a party of specialists who go up in levels
with the fewest number of EXP This party works well so long as the
warriors in the front rank never let the spell casters in the rear rank
get into melee.

@{b}Specialist Party: @{ub}Dwarven Fighter, Human Paladin, Elven Mage, and Half
Elven Cleric.

Another strategy is to create a party of generalists who are multi-
classed characters. This party should always have some character
with the appropriate skill for a situation. But, such a diverse party
will take a lot of EXP to get to higher levels.

@{b}Generalist Party: @{ub}Dwarven Fighter/Thief, Half Elven Fighter/Cleric,
Elven Fighter/Mage, Half Elven Cleric/Mage

A further strategy is to have a mixed party with specialist warriors in
the front rank and generalist spell casters in the rear rank. This
strategy makes sure that the fighters gain levels (and HP) as quickly as
possible, but that the spell casters will have a wide variety of spells
available.

@{b}Mixed Party: @{ub}Dwarven Fighter, Human Paladin, Half Elven Cleric/Mage,
Gnome Cleric/Thief.

@node COMBATMECANICS "COMBATMECANICS"
@{b}COMBAT MECHANICS @{ub}

Understanding the combat mechanics used in EYE OF THE BEHOLDER allows
the party to use the most effective weapons and tactics in different
situations. Each character's ability in combat is defined by his AC,
THAC0, and damage.

@{b}AC @{ub}

A character or monster's difficulty to be hit is represented by his
Armor Class or AC. The lower the target's AC, the harder it is to hit
the target. AC is based on armor and a dexterity bonus. Some magic
items also help a character's AC.

@{b}THAC0 @{ub}

A character's THAC0 represents his ability to hit enemies. THAC0 stands
for To Hit Armor Class 0. This is the number a character must `roll'
equal to or greater than to do damage on a target with an AC of 0.
The lower the attacker's THAC0, the better his chance to hit the target.
A character's THAC0 is based on his class and level.

  @{b}Note: @{ub}the generation of a random number is often referred to as a
  `roll'. In determining if an attack hit, the number generated is from
  1 through 20. The base roll is modified by the character's ability
  scores and any magic weapons.

An attack is successful if the roll is greater than or equal to the
attacker's THAC0 minus the target's AC.

  @{b}Example: @{ub}A fighter with a THAC0 of 15 attacking a monster with an
  AC of 3 would need to roll: (THAC0 15) - (AC 3) = 12+. But to hit a
  monster with an AC of -2 he would need to roll: (THAC0 15) - (AC -2) =
  17+

@{b}Damage @{ub}

When a hit is scored, the attacker does damage. Damage is the range of
HP loss the attacker inflicts when he hits an opponent in combat, and it
depends on the attacker's strength and weapon type. The damage each
weapon can do is summarized in the Weapons List.

Some monsters take only partial or no damage from certain weapon types.
Skeletons, for example, take only half damage from sharp or edged
weapons.

@{b}Attacking @{ub}

Characters generally engage in melee combat, which is face-to-face
fighting with weapons such as swords and maces. Characters also
have other options, such as casting spells and ranged combat, with bows
and slings.

In general, a character attacks the enemy in the front rank on his side
of the screen. When there is only one enemy left in a battle, it
moves to the center of the square and characters from both sides can
attack it.

@{b}Combat Strategies @{ub}

To succeed in combat, a skilled player deploys his party well, casts
effective spells before and during combat, maneuvers his characters
into advantageous positions, and attacks using his most powerful
characters and weapons.

@{b}Deploying the Party @{ub}

Keep the heavily-armored fighters in the front rank and the vulnerable
mages and thieves in the rear ranks.

@{b}Equipping the Party @{ub}

Equip characters in the front rank with the most powerful melee weapons
you can find. See the Weapons Table to see how much damage each type of
melee weapon can do. As soon as you find enough weapons, warriors should
carry a one handed weapon in their primary hand and a short sword in
their secondary hand.

Equip characters in the rear ranks with the most powerful ranged
weapons you can find. See the Weapons Table to see how much damage each
type of ranged weapon can do. Spell casters should have their holy
symbols and spell books in-hand, ready to cast spells.

Characters who use thrown weapons should carry weapons both in-hand and
in their belt pouch for quick reloading. Front rank characters who use
thrown weapons may wish to carry a shield or short sword at the top
of their belt pouch. This shield or short sword will be readied
automatically after they attack with the last of their thrown weapons.

Be sure to recover your ranged weapons after each battle and to collect
all of the ranged weapons you can find. Ranged weapons get used up
quickly in battle, and they may have special uses later in the game.

@{b}Wounded Characters @{ub}

Characters who are seriously wounded should be moved out of the front
rank if possible. It is much easier to heal a wounded character than
it is to bring a dead character back to life.

@{b}Moving and Fighting @{ub}

If you are exploring an area, move with the compass on the screen to
facilitate mapping. If you are moving through an explored area,
move with a spell menu on the screen and an attack spell showing.
Always move with the Adventure Screen up, you can't fight from the
Equipment or Character Screens.

With both the adventure screen and spell menu up you are prepared for
battle. Prepare for battle before you open any door, climb or descend
stairs, or push a button that could open a door or secret wall. Monsters
often lurk behind closed doors or secret walls, and monsters are always
ready for combat.

Remember that you can move and fight at the same time. You can move
backwards to dodge an enemy melee attack. You can move sideways to dodge
an enemy ranged attack. You can even run away and close a door behind
you to get away from a particularly nasty fight.


@{b}Fighting from the Keyboard @{ub}

Fighting from the keyboard takes a little more planning than fighting
with a mouse. To fight effectively, quickly choose the item you want
to attack with and press the U key to Use it.

There are two ways to move the item high-light and choose the item you
want to attack with: the A, S, W and Z item cursor keys, and the F1 - F6
character selection keys. The party's equipment should be set up to take
maximum advantage of the way you move the item highlight.

If you use the A, S, Wand Z, item cursor keys to move the item highlight,
place the six weapons the party uses most in the primary and secondary
hands of the front rank characters and in the primary hands of the
first two rear rank characters. Before a battle, start the item
highlight on the primary hand of the character in the upper right hand
comer. Practice quickly moving the item highlight in a circle through
these six items, Using each item in turn. By the time the cursor gets
back to the first item, that item should be ready to Use again.

If you use the F1- F6 character selection keys to move the item
highlight, place the four to six weapons the party uses most in the
primary hands of each of the characters. Before a battle, start the item
highlight on the primary hand of the character in the upper right hand
corner. Practice using the F1 - F6 keys to quickly moving the item
highlight in a circle through these four to six items, Using each item in
turn. By the time the cursor gets back to the first item, that item should
be ready to Use again.

Once you can move the item highlight and use weapons quickly, add moving
and casting mage spells to the combat rhythm. In general, if the combat
situation requires that the party move, then interrupt your combat
rhythm and move! To cast spells effectively in combat, take the first
spare instant to Use a mage's spell book and open the spell menu. Resume
attacking with weapons until you have another spare instant, then choose
the spell level, the spell within that level, and then cast the spell.
You can eliminate choosing the spell within a level if you memorize only
the attack spells Magic Missile, Melf's Acid Arrow, Fireball, Ice Storm,
and Cone of Cold.

With a little planning and practice, you can fight as effectively with
the keyboard as you can with the mouse. While the party's attacks may
sacrifice some flexibility, they will gain in consistency and rhythm.

@node TACTICSOFCOMBAT "tacticsofcombat"
@{b}TACTICS @{ub}

The monsters on the first several levels are each designed to require a
different combat strategy for maximum effectiveness. The player should
try to learn different combat strategies to fight each type of monster
most effectively.

@{b}Level 1 @{ub}

The monsters on level 1 do not have special abilities or weaknesses. It
only requires that the party learn to melee effectively to survive.

@{b}Level 2 @{ub}

The monsters on level 2 are undead. The party should learn that these
monsters can be turned by a cleric who has his holy symbol ready and
in-hand.

@{b}Level 3 @{ub}

The kuo-toa have ranged attacks. The party should learn to dodge the
ranged attacks before closing with the monster to melee.

@{b}Level 4 & 5 @{ub}

The giant spiders have a poisonous bite. The party should learn `shoot
and scoot' tactics to keep out of melee. These tactics consist of
learning to move backwards while attacking with ranged weapons and spells.

@{b}Level 6 @{ub}

The kenku have multiple ranged attacks, travels in groups, and can
surround a slow moving party. The party should learn to keep dodging
until the flock has expended all of its ranged attacks. The party also
needs to learn to use area effect damage spells, like Fireball, to
clear out the flocks quickly and to move swiftly so as not to get
trapped in a corridor with foes both in front and behind.

There is a wizard on level 6 that has many area effect spells. Here the
party needs to learn `hit and run' tactics. These tactics are to dodge
back around a corner, strike at their foe as he presents his flank, and
then dodge back again as he turns to face the party. The object of this
tactic is to always avoid the enemy's devastating fire power.

@{b}Level 7 @{ub}

The drow have weapons coated with a paralyzing poison and have a
significant resistance to magic. The party should learn to rely on
missile fire and maneuver instead of magic and melee, to defeat their
foes. Once the party has learned all of these tactics, they have a
chance against any of the monsters in the game. All the party has to
do then is decide which tactic is most effective in each situation.

@node WEAPONSANDARMOR "Weapons and Armor"
@{b}WEAPONS AND ARMOR @{ub}

@{b}Weapons @{ub}

Weapons are divided into 3 classes: melee, thrown, and fired. Melee
weapons are used only in close combat, while thrown and fired weapons
are used at range. Characters in the front rank can use melee and
ranged weapons. Characters in the rear ranks can only use ranged
weapons. Note the Classes sections starting on page 23 in the rules
that limit some character classes to certain weapons.

The Weapons Chart lists the weapons with their range of hit point
damage versus small, medium, and large-sized creatures. The damage done
by a melee weapon is adjusted by the attacking character's strength and
any magical bonus the weapon may have.

@{b}Weapons Chart  @{ub}

* These two-handed weapons must be used from the primaryhand.

@{b}Armor @{ub}

Armor provides a character a base AC. The lower the character's AC, the
harder it is for an attack to hit. AC is based on the character's
armor and his dexterity bonus. Some magic items also help a character's AC.

Note the Classes sections starting on page 23 in the rules that limit some
character classes to certain types of armor. The Armor Chart lists the
types of armor in E0B and the base AC they provide a character.

@{b}Armor Chart @{ub}

Leather Armor    B
Scale Mail       7
Chain Mail       5
Banded Armor     4
Plate Mail       3

* A shield subtracts 1 AC from any armor it is used with. Boots, helmets,
and non-magical bracers may look like armor, but they do not modify a
characters AC. They can safely be left as weights on pressure plates.
Magical bracers, however, can modify a characters AC.

@node SPELLSBYKIND "Spells By Kind"
@{b}SPELLS @{ub}

Spells are an important part of a party's capabilities. The spells that
the party's spell casters memorize will have an important effect on the
party's tactics.

In the following section, the spells have been divided into types:
Offensive Spells, Defensive Spells, and Other Spells. There are specific
hints on when each type of spell is most effective. Spells that are
available only to clerics are marked with an *.

@{b}Offensive Spells @{ub}

@{b}Burning Hands, *Cause Light Wounds, Shocking Grasp, *Flame Blade, @{ub}
@{b}Vampiric Touch, *Cause Serious Wounds and *Cause Critical Wounds: @{ub}These
are hand to hand magical attacks. The spell caster must be in the front
rank to attack with them. Because of the time it takes to cast these
spells and the vulnerability of many spell casters, they are normally
the offensive spells of last resort.

@{b}Magic Missile, Melf's Acid Arrow and Flame Arrow: @{ub}These are ranged
magical attacks that affect only one monster at a time. They allow the
spell caster to attack from the safety of the rear ranks. They are the
favorite offensive spells of lower level mages.

@{b}Hold Person, Fireball, Lightning Bolt, Fear, Ice Storm, Cone of Cold, @{ub}
@{b}*Flame Strike and Hold Monster: @{ub}These are ranged magical attacks that
can affect several monsters in an area. Because of the damage they can
do, they are often the preferred offensive spells of higher level spell
casters.

These area effect spells are especially effective when fighting many
monsters. Look closely at the area of effect of the various spells. The
spells that affect several squares are more effective against monsters
that cannot attack in groups. The spells that effect a single square
are most effective against monsters that attack in groups.

Two of these spells take special care when they are used. If the target
of an Ice Storm spell is within melee range of the party, the party will
also take damage from the spell. The Hold Person spell only affects
kobolds, dwarves, and drow.

@{b}Defensive Spells @{ub}

@{b}Armor, *Protection from Evil, Shield, *Magical Vestment, *Protection @{ub}
@{b}from Evil 10' Radius and Stoneskin: @{ub}These spells mainly provide
protection against physical attacks. Cast these spells on your front
rank characters just before dangerous battles. Stoneskin is often the
preferred physical defensive spell of higher level spell casters.

@{b}*Bless and *Prayer: @{ub}These spells mainly provide protection against
magical attacks. Cast these spells on your front rank characters
just before dangerous battles.

@{b}Healing Spells @{ub}

@{b}*Cure Light Wounds, *Aid, *Cure Serious Wounds, and *Cure Critical @{ub}
@{b}Wounds: @{ub}These spells replace a character's lost HP. The Aid spell
can increase a character's HP over his normal maximum value, but only
increases HP temporarily. Cleric class characters should always have a
few Cure Light Wounds spells memorized to quickly heal the party while
resting.

@{b}*Slow Poison, *Remove Paralysis, *Neutralize Poison:@{ub} These spells slow
or remove the effects of poison or paralysis. Keep a number of these
spells memorized whenever the party is anywhere near a monster who can
poison or paralyze the party.

@{b}*Raise Dead: @{ub}This spell will bring a character back from the dead. Keep
one of these spells memorized once your cleric gets to a high enough
level.

@{b}Other Spells @{ub}

@{b}Detect Magic: @{ub}This spell is very useful in evaluating the items the
party picks up during the game. The spell causes all magical items
carried by the party to glow blue.

@{b}Invisibility and Invisibility 10' Radius: @{ub}Invisibility is a useful
defense for a character in the rear ranks who avoids attacking.
Invisibility 10' Radius is useful to hide the entire party from mystic
sensors and prying eyes.

Even when the party is invisible, most monsters will sense the party's
general location, though the monsters get big penalties on attacks
against invisible targets.

@{b}*Create Food & Water: @{ub}This spell is very useful in the lower levels of the
dungeon where food is scarce. Be sure to memorize this spell before
the party begins starving not after!

@{b}Haste: @{ub}This spell is especially useful when fighting monsters who are
very fast. The Haste spell allows a party to make melee attacks much
faster. Cast this spell on your party just before dangerous battles.

@node PORTALS "Portals"
@{b}PORTALS @{ub}

The dwarves that built the halls beneath the Waterdeep sewers used a
series of magic portals to move quickly through their underground
empire. These portals are now used by Xanathar and his minions as a
system of high-speed transportation. These portals and the stone
items that trigger them make it much easier for the party to move and
explore. There are 16 different portals, each one requiring a special
enchanted stone item as a key. There are 7 different stone items
in EYE OF THE BEHOLDER: holy symbol, necklace, orb, dagger medallion,
scepter and ring.

@{b}Level 1 @{ub}

@{b}Kobold: @{ub}These creatures are weak alone, but they can be dangerous when
they attack in packs. All types of weapons are effective against these
creatures. The clerical spell Hold Person is especially effective against
Kobolds.

@{b}Leech, Giant: @{ub}These creatures are slow and can only attack one at a time,
but they are much tougher than kobolds and can do a lot more damage when
they hit. All types of weapons are effective against these creatures,
but a novice party might want to keep their distance and attack leeches
with ranged weapons and spells.

@{b}Level 2 @{ub}

@{b}Skeleton: @{ub}These creatures attack quickly and can pack together to
attack as a mob. The best defense against a group of skeletons is to
turn them by readying the holy symbol of the party's highest level
cleric. Skeletons take half damage from piercing and slashing weapons
like swords and daggers.

@{b}Zombie: @{ub}These creatures attack more slowly than skeletons but they too
can pack together to attack as a mob. All types of weapons are
effective against zombies, but the best defense against a group of
zombies is to turn them by readying the holy symbol of the party's
highest level cleric.

@{b}Level 3 @{ub}

@{b}Kuo-Toa: @{ub}These creatures are slow and can only attack one at a time, but
they can throw lightning bolts at range. When you spot a kuo-toa,
sidestep its initial lightning bolt, then rush in and kill it in melee
before the creature can get another lightning bolt off. All types of
weapons are effective against these creatures.

@{b}Flind: @{ub}These creatures can only attack one at a time, but are fast and
can do a lot of damage. They have a fondness for ambushes, so be ready
for battle as you open doors, turn corners, and move through areas they
inhabit. All types of weapons are effective against these creatures.

@{"  Flind - OS 3.0+" LINK "game/Level3-flind.gif/MAIN"}

@{b}Levels 4 & 5 @{ub}

@{b}Spider, Giant: @{ub}These creatures are extremely dangerous due to the lethal
poison in their bite. These creatures can only attack one at a time, but
are quick and takes several hits to kill.

The best strategy when fighting a spider is to retreat and engage the
spider with ranged weapons and spells. Dwarves with high constitution
scores are resistant to poison and should be in the front rank in case
the spider catches the retreating party. After each battle, be sure to
quickly pick up your ranged weapon ammo and keep an eye out for other
spiders.

Your cleric plays an important role in the party's survival after a
character is poisoned. If a character is poisoned, its is best to cast
a Slow Poison spell on them and look for a Potion of Cure Poison, or a
friendly NPC cleric with a Neutralize Poison spell.

@{b}Kenku: @{ub}These creatures can pack together to attack as a group and can
throw two Magic Missile spells at range before they close to melee.
When you spot a flock of kenku, sidestep until they have expended their
Magic Missile spells. All types of weapons are effective against these
creatures, but area effect spells like Fireball are the most effective
way to break up their groups.

There is an entire community of kenku on level 6. Groups of them will
continue to attack the party as long as they are on level 6. Be careful
not to get surrounded, and move swiftly through the level to complete
your objectives before too many of the kenku are alerted.

@{b}Drow Elf: @{ub}Most drow, outside of the area covered in EYE OF THE BEHOLDER,
kill strangers on sight. The drow elf community in EOB has a pact with
Xanathar and are used to dealing with non-drow They may even be willing
to bargain with wandering adventurers.

The drow can pack together to attack as a group and have a high
resistance to spells. In melee, they attack with long swords coated
with a short-term paralyzing poison. Use the party's maneuverability to
stay out of melee with the drow and use ranged weapon attacks against
them as long as you can.

@{b}Skeletal Lord: @{ub}These creatures are an elite force of evil warriors
created from the bones of fallen heroes. They can attack quickly, are
very tough, and can pack together to attack as a group. The best
defense against a group of skeletons is to turn them by readying the
holy symbol of the party's highest level cleric. Skeletal lords take
half damage from piercing and slashing weapons like swords and daggers.

@{b}Drider: @{ub}These creatures have powerful melee attacks, a high resistance
to spells, and are armed with two spears that they used as ranged
attacks. When you spot a drider, sidestep until he has expended his
spears and then engage with ranged and melee weapons. All types of
weapons are effective against these creatures, but most spells are
ineffective.

@{b}Hell Hound: @{ub}These creatures attack with a powerful bite and by breathing
fire. They are resistant to some spells. They often attack in packs, but
keep sufficiently spread out to avoid area effect spells. Maneuver to
keep from being surrounded All types of weapons are effective against
these creatures.

@{b}Level 9 @{ub}

@{b}Displacer Beast: @{ub}These creatures have powerful melee attacks and have
the power to `displace' their image up to three feet from their actual
location. Because of this ability, displacer beasts are difficult to hit
with melee and ranged weapons, so it is best to engage them with spells.

@{"  Displacer Beast - OS 3.0-" system "sys:utilities/multiview game/Level9-displace.gif"}

@{"  Displacer Beast - OS 3.0+" LINK "game/Level9-displace.gif/MAIN"}

@{b}Rust Monster: @{ub}These creatures have an insatiable appetite for all metal.
When you encounter a rust monster, immediately move characters without
metal armor to the front rank and keep retreating to protect the party's
metal equipment. While retreating, engage the rust monsters with ranged
weapons and spells.

@{b}Level 10 @{ub}

@{b}Mantis Warrior: @{ub}These creatures are extremely fast and carry two weapons,
a thrown dagger and a halberd for melee attacks. The halberd is coated
with the mantis warrior's paralyzing saliva. When you spot a mantis
warrior, sidestep until he has expended his dagger retreat to keep out of
melee, and engage with ranged spells.

@{b}Level 11 @{ub}

@{b}Mind Flayer: @{ub}These creatures are almost completely resistant to magic
and their invisible psionic attack can paralyze the entire party. When
a mind flayer turns to face the party, sidestep quickly to avoid its
psionic attack. Retreat around corners and engage the mind flayer on its
flank with ranged and melee weapons. All types of weapons are effective
against these creatures.

@{"  Mind Flayer - OS 3.0+" LINK "game/Level11-mflayer.gif/MAIN"}

@{b}Xorn: @{ub}These creatures are slow and tough, do a lot of damage when they
hit, and are resistant to some spells. Engage the xorn by closing
to melee, attacking, and then retreating before the xorn can execute
its own powerful attack.

@{b}Level 12 @{ub}

@{b}Golem, Stone: @{ub}Xanathar's stone golems are less powerful than classical
golems because they are built using short cuts and non-traditional
materials. Still, these monsters are extremely tough, do a lot of
damage when they hit, and are resistant to most spells in the
game. Engage a golem by closing to melee, attacking, and then
retreating before it can execute its powerful melee attack.

@{"  Golem - OS 3.0-" system "sys:utilities/multiview game/Level12-golem.gif"}

@{b}Beholder: @{ub}Xanathar the beholder has been watching your party since
you accepted the Lord's commission and knows what you are capable of
doing. Defeating him will not be an easy task!

@{"  Beholder - OS 3.0-" system "sys:utilities/multiview game/Level12-beholder.gif"}

@{"  Beholder - OS 3.0+" LINK "game/Level12-beholder.gif/MAIN"}

Beholders are almost completely resistant to magic because of the anti-
magic effects of their central eye. A beholder has ranged attacks,
that can devastate the entire party. To defeat the beholder, use the
tactics that have worked against other monsters, and remember the
clues that you have received throughout the game.

@node HINTS "Hints"
@{b}Spell Boxes: @{ub}

 a Yellow Spell Box represents a spell that mainly defends
against physical attacks and a Red Spell Box represents a spell that
mainly defends again magical attacks. A White Spell Box represents a
spell that mainly defends against physical attacks and a Cyan Spell Box
represents a spell that mainly defends again magical attacks.

@{b}Character paralysed: @{ub}

  When a character is paralyzed of effected by poisin his name will be
highlighted. When a character is paralyzed the items in both of his
hands will be greyed out. An indicator at the botton of the equipment
Screen will list if a character is paralyzed, poisoned but under the
effects of a slow poison spell, unconcious, or dead.

@{b}Weapons: @{ub}

  When you have a weapon in your primary hand, you can only use a seconday
or small weapon, like a dagger dart, or short sword, in the secondary
hand. All other weapons cannot be used and will be greyed out. When you
have a two handed weapon in your primary hand, all items in your
seconday hand connot be use and will be greyed out.

@{b}Character near death: @{ub}

When a character is near death, his hit point bar will change color.
When he is unconcious, but not dead, it will change color again. When a
character is dead, the hit point bar will be empty.

If you answer Yes to the question "Will you rest until healed?", your
part will rest until it heals naturally. While healing naturally, your
party will have all of their spells memorized if they are interrupted by
monsters, but they will use up food quickly.

@{b}Bows: @{ub}

  Bows will take arrows from either the secondary hand or the quiver.
Slings will take stones from the seconday hand, the belt pich, or the
backpack. Bows and Slings are two-handed weapons, and so any ammo or
other items in the secondary hand will be greyed out.


 Unmemorized spells are not highlighted in the camp spell menu. There is
no backgroup music to turn off.

  A cleric must have his holy symbol in-hand to attempt to turn undead.
You can Use the Commission to read it.

  Races do not receive special combat bonuses with specific weapons. A
high Charisma has no effect when talking to NPCs.

  Burning Hands effects all monsters next to the party, Invisibilty and
Invisibility 10' radius are not lost when a character is hit.
Invisibility 10' radius is lost on a character by character basis. A
Flame Blade may appear in either hand. There are no Stinking Cloud,
Cloudkill, or Protection from Lightning spells in the game.


Hints: Make sure that your party contains at least two characters who
can fight well, one who can cast mage spells, and one who can cast
clerical spells. Create the fighters first and then the spell casters.
After you have created all of your characters, Select Play to begin the
game. Once in the game, find your location at the the Main Entrance of
Level 1 on the Sewer Systems Map.

  Experiment with manipulating objects. Place the mouse pointer over one
of the rocks at your feet and press the left mouse button to Take it.
Move the mouse pointer over the movement button and press a mouse button
to turn to the right. Place the rock shaped mouse pointer over the
ground and press a mouse button to drop the rock. Take the rock again,
place it high in the 3D view and press a mouse button to throw the rock.
Move forward to see how far it flew.

  Move around and pick up the rocks and any other items you find. Select a
portait to access the Equipment Screen. Place items into the backpack.
Select the portrait again to return to Adventure Screen. Before you go
too far, enter camp, have your spell casters memorize and pray for
spells, and then rest to gain the spells.

  Anytime you see an interesting item on the wall, place the mouse pointer
over the item and press a mouse button. Read the description in the
Message Area at the bottom of the screen. Watch out for items that you
can manipulate, like levers that move and button that depress.
When a monster approaches, make sure that your fighters in the front
rank have weapons in their primary hand. To attack, place the mouse
pointer over each weapon and press the Right Mouse Button. Once you get
comfortable fighting with the front rank characters, you can also have
the rear rank characters throw weapons and spells at the monsters.
Experiment by equipping your characters with various combinations of
weapons, shields, spell books, and holy symbols to maximize their
fighting ability.

  Once you master manipulating objects, moving, and fighting, you are
ready to tackle the quest in Eye of the Beholder. Good Luck!
