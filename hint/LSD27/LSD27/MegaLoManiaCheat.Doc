                        MLMLI - the Documentation
                        -------------------------

   This little utility is meant to be little cheat for all of you who have
   always wanted to be good in Mega-Lo-Mania (c) 1991 by Imageworks. With 
   MLMLI you can get the kind of a password that you like. You just punch 
   in some numbers and you get a brand new password.

   Of course, if you do not have Mega-Lo-Mania (c) 1991 by Imageworks, you 
   can always get in touch with your local retailer and purchase the great 
   game for yourself. Do not use any copies of the game ! It is illegal and
   immoral ! If you play a game - BUY IT !

   OK. Back to docs.

   So now you have decided you want a password for level 3 with 800 men ?
   -> Just run MLMLI with the following procedure :

   MLMLI p0 l3 m0800 <return>

   With 'p(n)' you can choose the player with which you want to play.
   Where 'n' stands for the number of the player. 0 meaning the one on
   the top and 3 meaning the one on the bottom of the screen (you know).

   With 'l(n)' you select the level and with
        'm(nnnn)' you select the amount of men you want to have; remember
                  to type in 4 digits ! For example , if you want 1 man,
                  you should type 'm0001'. Get it ??

   OK.... That's it for the docs.....

   Now you just have to sit and wait for the next cool WIZZCAT-releases.

   And remember..... WE ARE STILL ALIVE !!! ...(and kicking well! .ed)
