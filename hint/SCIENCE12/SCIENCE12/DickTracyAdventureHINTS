     DICK TRACY

     Ok, while i am at this I played dick tracy for a very short
     while before i got into larry V and i aint coming back to old
     dick.  For those who want to try this cross between the PQ1
     street scenes and Carmen San Diego's clue searching, here are
     the keyboard commands that I figured out -

     S is to Save
     Q is to Quit
     P is Tracy's voice saying I am on channel 7.  Purpose unknown.
     Space bar is to fire
     L is to Load a game
     R is for Rogue's Gallery
     Enter key turns on the sirens
     End key in numeric keypad - this is the only key I could find
     that would pick up clues.  Very strange.
     Arrow keys for movement, pressing a second time in car will
     speed it up, plus in the Rogues gallery, the left and right
     numeric keypad arrows would cycle through the Rogues, and the
     lower arrow keys would cycle through the clues I had found. 
     Streets numbers and addresses go left to right and up and
     down, Police Headquarters (for crime lab and cars) is  at 138
     7th street, garage and tess' are on first street, Club ritz is
     on 5th street, and cutting off the bad guys cars lets you
     grill them or shoot them.  If they have more than four bad
     guys with them you will be shot dead, in my opinion.

     After you cruise in the car for awhile, the wrist radio will
     give you the crime scene address.  Go there (it is labeled),
     get clues and what not, I found you could crawl down into the
     sewers but I did not accomplish anything there.
