------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		 	        * 1 *

 Pick a starting sector with the best elements for the inventions you 
 wish to make this time round.

				* 2 * 

 Some elements suit certain designs (see ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON! box).

				* 3 *

 Note the components and sector of any 'Ergonomically Terrific' designs.
 This is probably the best way to design that object and reduces design 
 time by half. If you see another sector later in the game with the same
 elements available you'll know this design can be knocked out in next to
 no time.


				* 4 *

 Look out for sectors with a plentiful supply of gatherable elements. These
 are often the best places to quickly produce weapons for a 'Surprise Attack'!

				* 5 *

 During later stages, especially in Epoch Three, it's advisable to find a
 sector with more sophisticated elements.

				* 6 *

 Eventually you should be able to pick the best seams to mine and know the
 ones to leave alone.

				* 7 *

 It's always best to check the design menu whenever a new seam is mined. A
 new design may have just become available.

				* 8 *

 What should you do if a seam or element is totally used up when designing
 an object? Bin the design on the blueprints menu and there's a chance you
 may be able to redesign it with the elements you have left. Phew!

				* 9 *

 Shields and building weapons can sometimes increase your tech level and
 reveal an element which could lead to the design you require.

			       * 10 *

 Inventions made from gatherable elements save valuable time and manpower.

			       * 11 *

 Always wait until the clocks have ticked down to zero before changing the
 factory to produce a new object.

			       * 12 *

 Knowledge of the different elements in each sector can help you figure out
 what the computer opponents are likely to arm themselves with.

			       * 13 *

 Try to keep your men balanced between tasks to maximise effciency. Only thorw
 all your men into a single task during an emergency.

 			       * 14 *
				
 If time is on your side, try to leave as many men as possible to reproduce
 in the tower. Men are your currency, bank wisely. There are no overdrafts in
 Mega lo Mania!

 			       * 15 *

 Designing shields from just gatherables can be a lifesaver if you're under
 fire but with some spare time.

			       * 16 *

 Play sensibly. Don't send unarmed men to attack buildings as they will have 
 no effect. Play sneaky. Send one or two lambs to the slaughter as a tester
 to see what sort of armies your opponents have hidden away.


			       * 17 *


 Use the map to see what your enemies are up to.

 			       * 18 *

 Remember a building weapon man is twice as strong as an armed man on the
 ground from the same area.

			       * 19 *

 If an opponent is too close for comfort at the beginning of a game, try to
 make him an ally before he starts attacking you.

			       * 20 *

 What should you do if your back is against the wall and you're about to die?
 Try allying with your aggressor! You have nothing left to lose.

			       * 21 *

 Use as few men as possible. See how low you can go...

                     ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR WATSON!

                  Designs that elements are good for...

 Rocks, Wood and Bones                Slate, Moonlite Planetarium 
 ---------------------                ---------------------------
 Rock Weapon      Catapult            Pike             Longbow
 Spear            Bow & Arrow         Giant Catapult   Stick Weapon
 Crossbow                             Spear            Musket 

 Bethlium, Solarium Araldite          Herbirite Yeridium
 ---------------------------          ------------------
 Catapult         Pike                Longbow          Giant Catapult 
 Longbow          Cannon
 Boiling          Crossbow

 Valium Parasite                      Aquarium Paladium
 ---------------                      -----------------
 Bow & Arrow      Boiling Oil         Giant Catapult
 Musket

 All elements can be used in all designs with the exception of rock and stick
 weapons, but the listed weapons are more likely to be designed from these
 elements.

                       TRICKY TEAMSTER TACTICS

               Should you trust or trash these people?

 SCARLET - Red
 -------------
 Usually a good bet for a quick alliance but prone to infidelity. Tends to
 attack frequently and with unpredictable armies can be quite easily tempted
 into a battle in order to divert her men away from duties at home. Try to
 avoid picking a starting sector next to her or she could cause trouble. She
 likes designing army weapons.

 OBERON - Yellow
 ---------------
 Likes to offer himself in alliance more than most and unsurprisingly veers
 towards the less reliable side of remaining faithful. Oberon is prone to 
 erratic retaliation attacks but is a useful ally in battle. Puts his hand
 towards any weapon design.

 CAESAR - Green
 --------------
 Not so easy to persuade to ally, but worthwhile and fairly reliable. Seems
 to have the best balance between defence and attack. Prefers builing weapons.
 You should attempt to limit his territory.

 MEDCAP - Blue
 -------------
 A real tough cookie to turn into an ally but faithful as the day is long. A
 careful tactician he rarely makes a false move. Hit Medcap early to put him
 off balance. He likes designing building shields. Tends to thorow occasional
 but devastating attacks.
