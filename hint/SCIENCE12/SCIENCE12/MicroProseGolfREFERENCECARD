                   -------------------

                   TECHNICAL SUPPLEMENT


CONTENTS       Your Microprose Golf package (?) should contain
               a manual, this Technical Supplement, 3 disks, a
               club selectiton guide, course maps and a 
               registration card.


REQUIRED       COMPUTER & DISPLAY: This simulation requires 
EQUIPMENT      either a Commodore Amiga with a minimum of 1
               megabyte of RAM or an Atari ST of 512k of RAM,
               and a colour monitor. Please prepare a blank 
               formatted disk in advance for a use as a Data
               Disk.
               CONTROLS: The simulation can be run enirely from
               the keyboard or with a joystick, but a mouse is
               strongly recommended for playing the game.


INSTALLING     Boot up your hard disk as normal, insert the 
ON HARDRIVE    Program Disk in Drive df0: and type the 
               the following:
               cd df0:
               golfinstall
               The Program Disk will then be copied into a folder
               on your Hard-disk root directory called "GOLF".
               You will then be asked to insert the two course
               disks so that the course data can be copied into
               the "GOLF" folder.
               NOTE: Golf runs from a folder that is situated in
                     your root directory. If you copy the files
                     into a sub-directory the program won't run
                     correctly.


INSTALLING     To install future courses that may be released,
FUT. COURSE    open the folder "GOLF", and type 'courseinstall'.
DISKS ON A HD  All the course data form the new disk will be 
               copied into your "GOLF" folder.


LOADING FROM   If your computer has KickStart in ROM, insert the 
FLOPPY DISKS   Program Disk into the internal drive. Power up the
               computer. The program will then auto-load.
               (oh really?)


LOADING FROM   Boot up your hard-disk as normal. Open the "GOLF"
A HARDDISK     folder and type 'GOLF'.


SAVED GAMES,   Whenever you wish to save a game, replay or player
REPLAYS AND    profile, the file will be saved to the device that
PLAYER         your first booted the game from. (eg: if you booted
PROFILES       the game from Hard-Disk, files will be saved to
               Hard-Disk). You can, however, save to Drive A, Drive
               B or Hard-Disk, depending upon what you have 
               connected at the time by clicking on the appropriate
               icon at the time of saving.


               OPERATING DIFFICULTIES AND LOADING PROBLEMS!
               --------------------------------------------


               In the vast majority of cases a loading problem
               is not of faulty software, but either an incorrect
               procedure or a hadware fault. Please ensure that the
               loading instructions have been correctly executed.
               The most common hardware failures are due to a
               misalignment of the heads in the disk drive. 
               Such faults may be detected by loading the game on 
               another computer.


               Alternatively, a virus may have transferred into your
               hardware from another piece of software.
               Pirated copies of games are an incredibly common 
               source of viruses. It always pays to own orginal 
               software. (a virus killer is a cheaper solution -RBL)


               In the unlikely event of a software fault, please 
               return the complete package, with receipt to the 
               place of purchase. Microprose regret that goods can't
               be replaced unless bought from the company directly.


               If you have any difficulty whilst loading MICROPROSE
               GOLF, or need help in geting the simulation to run.
               Microprose will be happy to help you on the helpline.
               Please ring UK (0666) 504399, Monday to Friday 0900
               to 1700 hrs. Have a pen and paper handy when you call.


PROTECTION     We regret that organised (FairLight) and casual pircay
               forces us to use manual protection. When the game has 
               loaded, you will be asked to indicate which language
               your manual is in, by clicking on a nationalflag icon
               (English, French or German). You will then be asked to
               type in the word corresponding to the given manual
               ref. in the form Page number, Line number and then
               word number. Simply open the manual at the appropriate
               page, count down to the required line and then across
               to find the correct word. Type this word in and press
               Return. the game will then load.


               CONTROLLING MICROPROSE GOLF WITH KEYBOARD OR JOYSTICK
               -----------------------------------------------------


               We strongly recommend that the mouse is used as a
               control method for playing this game. However, if you
               prefer to use Joystick or Keyboard as a control method
               you may do so. The game is configured on both Atari ST
               and Commodore Amiga to read from Mouse, Keyboard or
               Joystick all the time, so it is not necessary for you
               to select which you require. The alternative Keyboard
               and Joystick controls are listed below:

               Distances are given for average pitch and finish 
               distances for each club, in yards, for both novice
               (28 handicap) and scratch players. The distances
               assume a perfect lie and no wind.
