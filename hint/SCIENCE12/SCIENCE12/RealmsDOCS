        SCOOTER OF SKID ROW -TYPED IN THE DOX TO - REALMS - 9/12/91
        +_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+

IN A MOMENT THAT LASTED FOREVER,A BOLT OF LIVING ENERGY SHOT FROM THE
HEAVENS,SPANNING THE GREAT DIVIDE OF ETERNITY.

AS THE KINGS FUNERAL SHIP SAILED WEST,THE YOUNG HEIR REFLECTED ON THE SAD
EVENTS THAT HAD RECENTLY OVERTAKEN HIS PEOPLE,`ONCE AGAIN,FAMINE,POVERTY AND
WAR THRIVE IN A WORLD THAT IS NOW DIVIDED`. ONCE AGAIN,EACH REALM VIES TO
BECOME THE ULTIMATE POWER...HE MUSED.

IN A FIT OF RAGE, THE HEIR RAISED HIS FIST TO THE SKIES,SWEARING VENGEANCE.HIS
MIND IN TURMOIL, HE APPEALED TO THE NORDIC GODS FOR JUSTICE,AS IF IN ANSWER TO
HIS CRY,THE GROWING STORM CLOUDS REPLIED WITH A DEAFENING CLASH OF THUNDER.

BLINDED BY GRIEF,THE HEIR FAILED TO NOTICE THE CLOUDS BILLOW AND GRADUALLY
CHANGE THEIR SHAPE TO THE FORM OF THE GREAT GOD WOTAN.

IN A MOMENT THAT LASTED FOREVER,A BOLT OF LIVING ENERGY SHOT FROM THE
HEAVENS,SPANNING THE GREAT DIVIDE OF ETERNITY.ALL SOUND WAS LOST AS THE DEVINE
MESSENGER CUT AN ELECTRIC PATH TOWARDS OBLIVION.

THE HEIR STARED IN AWE AS THE PURE FORCE,SILENCED BY ITS SPEED HURTLED TOWARDS
HIM. A BILLION VOLTS BURNED INTO HIS WRIST AND FLOWED OVER AND THROUGH HIS
BODY,AND YET HE FELT NO PAIN...ONLY THE UNPRECEDENTED POWER OF THE HEAVENLY
SERPENT.

FOR AN INSTANT HE STOOD BETWEEN 2 WORLDS OVERWHELMED BY VISIONS OF AGES PAST
AND EVERY POSSIBLE FUTURE,THE REALITY SUPERIMPOSED ON THE IMAGE OF THE
PRESENT...THEN IT FADED LEAVING ONLY WHAT WAS AND WHAT SHALL BE.

WITH A FINAL BURST OF COSMIC FORCE,THE SYMBOLOF THE SERPENT MATERIALISED AND
THE HEIR UNDERSTOOD.HIS DIVINE MANDATE TO RULE FIRMNLY IN HIS GRASP,THE HIGH
KING TURNED TO FACE HIS COWERING PEOPLE....

`THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE`.

THIS ICON TURNS OFF THE DISPLAY.

TAX ROUTES      (BOTTOM LEFT) NO 3 ICON - A REALM COMPRISES OF AT LEAST ONE
CITY AND HAS A CAPITAL TO WHICH FLOWS ALL TAX AQUIRED FROM OTHER CITIES WITHIN 
THE REALM.SELECTING THIS ICON WILL SHOW ON THE MAP THE TAX FLOW FROM CITY TO
CITY AND ULTIMATELY THE CAPITAL CITY FOR A THE REALM CURRENTLY SELECTED.

TAXES FROM CITIES NOT CONNECTED TO THE CAPITAL CITY DO NOT REACH IT AND CANNOT
BE SPENT.IF A TAX ROUTE IS SEVERED,THE CITIES WILL ATTEMPT TO DIVERT TAX,BUT
MAY NOT TAKE THE BEST ROUTE.

THE EMPIRE CAN BE STREAMLINED BY CHANGING THE TAX FLOW ROUTES. WITH THE TAX
ROUTE INDICATOR ACTIVE,POINT TO THE PLAYERS CAPITAL CITY AND PRESS MOUSE
BUTTON.POINT TO ANY CITY WITHIN THE PLAYERS REALM AND PRESS A MOUSE BUTTON -
THE TAX ROUTE WILL CHANGE TO THE NEXT TO THE NEXT AVAILABLE ROUTE BUT ONLY IF
AN ALTERNATIVE IS AVAILABLE.NO CHANGE MEANS THERE ARE NO ALTERNATIVE ROUTE IS
POSSIBLE. A CITY MAY BE COMPLETELY CUT OFF AND SO BE INCAPABLE OF FORMING ANY
ROUTES AT ALL, IN WHICH CASE THE PLAYER SHOULD CONQUER ADJACENT CITIES TO
RELINK THE STRANDED ONE.

FOCUS           (BOTTOM LEFT) NO 4 ICON - THE PLAYER IS NOT A DIETY AND SO
LACKS OMNISCIENCE.THE PLAYER DOES HOWEVER HAVE THE GIFT OF FAR SIGHT - THE
ABILITY TO VIEW ANYWHERE WITHIN THE KNOWN WORLD.PRESS A MOUSE BUTTON WHILE THE
ARROW POINTS TO THIS ICON - THE ARROW WILL CHANGE INTO A FOCUS CIRCLE
POINTER...

THE FOCUS CIRCLE POINTER / NUMBER 2 POINTER ( O )
------------------------
MOVE THE FOCUS CIRCLE POINTER TO ANY POSITION ON THE MAP AND PRESS A MOUSE
BUTTON TO VIEW IN GREATER DETAIL THE DESIRED AREA(SEE THE PLAYFIELD)

TO TURN OFF THE FOCUS CIRCLE POINTER,SIMPLY CLICK ON THE FOCUS ICON.

TAX RATE ALTERATION (BOTTOM LEFT) ICON 5 - INCREASE OR DECREASE THE TAX RATE.

ONE COIN EVERY ALTERATION.THE SCALES TO THE TOP RIGHT OF THE SCREEN(ICON 1) OF
THIS DISPLAY WILL ALTER TOO, TO SHOW THE PREDICTED TAX EFFECT ACHIEVED.

THE GREATER THE QUANTITY OF COINS, THE HIGHER THE TAX RATE. EACH COIN
REPRESENTS 10 PER CENT OF A CITIES TOTAL PRODUCE.

TREASURY        (BOTTOM LEFT) ICON 7 - THESE 4 PILES OF COINS REPRESENT THE 
TREASURY OF THE PLAYERS REALM. THIS COMPRISES THE BALANCE OF ALL TAXES AND
OTHER MONIES AND GRAIN WHICH HAVE REACHED THE CAPITAL CITY. A SINGLE COIN
REPRESENTS THE PAY OF ONE THOUSAND MEN FOR A YEAR ON THE LOWEST POSSIBLE PAY,
OR IT COULD FEED 4 THOUSAND PEOPLE FOR A YEAR DEPENDING ON GRAIN PRICES.

TREASURY (AGAIN) THESE SHOW WETHER THE TAX ACCRUED FROM THE PLAYERS REALM CAN
SUPPORT ITS ARMIES. THE TAX IS REPRESENTED BY THE COINS ON THE LEFT HAND
SIDE,WHILE THE ARMIES ARE REPRESENTED ARE REPRESENTED BY THE SOLDIER IN THE
RIGHT HAND SCALE,WHEN THE SCALE HOLDING THE SOLDIER IS LOWER THAN THAT HOLDING
THE COINS,THE REALMS TOTAL INCOME IS NOT SIZEABLE ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THE ARMIES
AND MONEY IS LOST EACH SEASON. WHEN THE SCALE HOLDING THE COINS IS LOWER THEN
THE REALMS INCOME IS LARGE ENOUGH TO SUPPORT ARMIES AND SO THE TREASURY WILL
GROW. THE PREDICTED TAX CHANGE WHICH DETERMINES THE STATUS OF THESE SCALES IS
BASED ON THE AMOUNT COLLECTED IN THE PREVIOUS SEASON. NOTE THAT IF CITIES ARE
WON OR LOST OR THEIR LINKS SEVERED FROM THE TAX ROUTE THEN THIS MAY NOT BE THE
AMOUNT OF TAX ACTUALLY COLLECTED.

OR AWKWARD ROUTES THEY MAY GET LOST AND FURTHER ASSISTANCE WILL BE NEEDED.

WHEN A SHIP REACHES A PORT IYT IS REPLACED BY A UNIT OF MEN.NOTE THAT YOU CAN
TARGET THESE MEN ON THE PORT FROM WHICH THEY CAME,BUT ANY OTHER SEA OPERATION
REQUIRES THE POSSESSION OF AND ENTRY TO A PORT CITY.
NOTE ALSO,THAT FLEETS WHICH MEET OTHER FLEETS ON THEIR OWN JOURNEY MAY FIGHT
INDEPENDENTLY OF THE PLAYER.

ARMIES.
-------
LARGE ARMIES CAN BE BUILT BY ORDERING TROOPS TO FOLLOW EACH OTHER. ITS
FAVOURABLE TO BUILD UP LARGE ARMEIS TO INVADE ENEMY TERRITORY,ESPECIALLY AS
ITS EASIER TO CONTROL A FEW LARGE ARMIES RATHER THAN DOZENS OF INDIVIDUAL
UNITS. THE POSITIONING OF LARGE ARMIES WILL BE STRATEGIC.
THE EASIEST WAY TO BUILD AN ARMY IS TO TARGET UNITS ON A CITY.ALL UNITS IN THE
CITY WILL FORM A SINGLE ARMY WHICH CAN BE ORDERED OUT OF THE CITY BY SELECTING
ANY FLAG.
BY TRAGETING THE LEADER ONTO AN OPOSSING ARMY THE TRAIL OF TROOPS WILL CLOSE
FOR BATTLE.WHEN ENEMY UNITS COLLIDE AND ONLY A FEW UNITS ARE INVOLVED A
SKIRMISH RESULTS,CASUALTIES ARE IMMEDIATELY CALCULATED AND ONE SIDE MAY
RETREAT. IF MANY UNITS ARE INVOLVED IN BATTLE THEN THE BATTLE SCREEN IS
PRESENTED SO THE PLAYER CAN ACT AS GENERAL AND ORDER INDIVIDUAL UNITS(SEE THE
BATTLE SCREEN)

TARGETS.

OWN UNIT.
THE MEN WILL FORM A LARGER ARMY.FROM THEN ON,ONLY THE LEADER HAS TO BE
TARGETTED. THE ARMY WILL SPLIT IF UNITS ARE FORCED TO RETREAT BY AN ENEMY.

ENEMY UNIT.
THE MEN WILL INTERCEPT THE ENEMY,LAYING SIEGE IF THEY ARE INSIDE A CITY.

SIEGERS.
THE MEN WILL ATTACK THE SIEGERS

CITY.
THE MEN WILL ENTER THEIR OWN CITY,MERGING WITH ANY OTHER UNITS ALREADY
THERE.DURING ITS STAY,THE ARMY RECOUPS MORALE AND RECRUITS.IF THE CITY BELONGS
TO ANOITHER REALM,THE MEN WILL LAY SIEGE. IF THE MEN WERE ALREADY SIEGING A
CITY THEY WILL STORM THE WALLS.THIS CAN PROVE COSTLY IF THE CITY IS WELL
DEFENDED BUT IT IS A QUICK MEANS OF WINNING A CITY.

SELECTING A MAN AND SELECTING A TARGET WILL CAUSE THAT MAN TO BECOME A LEADER
OF TROOPS FOLLOWING HIM IN THE CHAIN.

SILVER ARROWS BELONG TO THE CITIES THAT ARE NOT PART OF THE PLAYERS REALM. THE
GOLD ARROWS ARE FOR CITIES WITHIN THE PLAYERS REALM. THIS PROVIDES A USEFUL
SHORTCUT TO CHECK ON SEVERAL CITIES WITHOUT RETURNING TO THE MAIN DISPLAY.
SIMPLY POINT TO THE RELEVANT TITLED ARROW AND PRESS A MOUSE BUTTON.

THE BUY OPTIONS.
----------------
GRAIN.
THE PRICE OF A YEARS WORTH OF SEEDS FOR THE CURRENT POPULATION IS SHOWN,BEWARE
OF PRICE FLUCTUATIONS.
REMEMBER;IF A POPULATION IS INCREASING,THE GRAIN MAY NOT LAST AS LONG AS
EXPECTED.

LAND.
ALLOWS GROWTH TO CONTINUE.WHENEVER THIS OPTION IS CHOSEN AN AREA OF LAND IS
CLEARED AND PLANTED.
EVENTUALLY A CITY WILL REACH ITS MAXIMUM SIZE AND THERE WILL BE NO MORE
LAND.LAND AUTOMATICALLY FALLS OUT OF PRODUCTION IF THE POPULATION FALLS AND SO
WILL HAVE TO BE RECULTIVATED. CULTIVATED LAND CAN BE SEEN ON THE MAIN DISPLAY.

HEALTH.
THE COST OF CLEANING UP THE CITY AND CARING FOR THE SICK IS SHOWN. THIS OPTION
MAY HAVE TO BE USED SEVERAL TIMES IF A PLAGUE HAS STRUCK THE CITY. NOTE THAT
PLAGUE QUICKLY AFFECTS CROWDED CITIES AND SPREADS ALONG THE TRADE ROUTES.

BUILD CITY; A STANDARD COST IS SHOWN FOR ENCOURAGING NEW CITIZENS TO THE CITY.

WOODEN WALLS; THE FULL COST IS SHOWN,BUT THEY TAKE TIME TO BUILD.

STONE WALLS;
THESE ARE EXPENSIVE AND TAKE LONGER TO COMPLETE THAN WOODEN WALLS
BUT THEY PROVIDE THE BEST PROTECTION AGAINST LOOTERS. THE ERECTION OF STONE
WALLS CAN BE BEGUN BEFORE THE WOODEN WALLS ARE COMPLETE.

PAY TRIBUTE;
A SIEGING ARMY MAY DEMAND A TRIBUTE TO LEAVE. THE SIZE OF THE TRIBUTE DEPENDS
ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEIR REALM AND THE PLAYERS. A PAYMENT MAY RELIEVE
THE SIEGE BUT THEY MAY SOON BE BACK FOR MORE.

RECRUIT ARMY;
THE TEXT AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN DETAILS THE QWUALITY OF THE NEXT 1000 TROOPS
AVAILABLE.THE RECRUITMENT COST SHOWN IS THE BASIC COST FOR BASIC TRAINING AND
THE CHEAPEST EQUIPMENT. WHEN THE OPTION IS CHOSEN THE ARMY SCREEN IS
DISPLAYED.(SEE THE ARMY SCREEN)

RECRUIT CAVALRY;
THIS IS SIMILAR TO THE ARMY OPTION EXCEPT A HORSE REGIMENT IS FORMED.NOTE;THAT
SOME RACES MAKE BETTER HORSEMEN THAN OTHERS.

THE TAKE OPTIONS;
THE AMOUNT OF TAX THAT CAN BE RAISED IS SHOWN,THIS IS TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM THE
PEOPLE AND NEVER PROVES POPULAR, SO ONLY USE THE CITIZEN LEVY FOR INSTANT CASH
IN EMERGENCIES.

TAKE TRIBUTE;
WHEN SIEGING AN ENEMY CITY,THE PLAYER MAY BE OFFERED A TRIBUTE TO END THE
SIEGE. ACCEPTING THIS TRIBUTE AUTOMATICALLY SENDS THE PLAYERS TROOPS HOME.

SURRENDER OPTIONS;
IF A CITY SURRENDERS FOLLOWING A SIEGE,THE FOLLOWING OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE.

LOOT CITY;
THE CITY IS LEFT UNTOUCHED BUT ITS WEALTH IS TAKEN IN A CIVILISED MANNER.

RAVAGE CITY;
THE ARMY IS GIVEN FREEDOM TO PILLAGE THE CITY. THIS WORKS WONDERS FOR THE
ARMY`S MORALE BUT ENRAGES THE ENEMY.

RAZE CITY;
THE ULTIMATE SANCTION.THE CITY`S PEOPLE ARE SOLD,THE BUILDINGS ARE BURNED AND
ALL THE WEALTH TAKEN.
THE ENEMY WILL TAKE TIME TO RECOVER AND WILL MORE OFTEN THAN NOT
DESIRE -VENGEANCE!!!-

ANNEXE CITY;
THE BEST OPTION OF ALL FOR REDUCING THE ENEMY`S STRENGTH AND IMPROVING THE
PLAYERS - PROVIDED THE MONEY AND MEN ARE AVAILABLE. THIS COSTLY EXERCISE
ENRAGES THE ENEMY BUT THE PEOPLE MAY BE MORE APPRECIATIVE DEPENDING ON HOW
THEY HAVE BEEN TREATED IN THE PAST.

BATTLE SCREEN (AGAIN I`LL TRY MY BEST TO DESCRIBE IT)

THERE ARE 5 ICONS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN,I`LL DETAIL THEM FROM LEFT TO
RIGHT AND NUMBER THEM ICONS 1 - 5,

ICON 1 - ORDER ATTACK
ICON 2 - CHANGE FORMATION
ICON 3 - ROTATE UNIT
ICON 4 - ROTATE UNIT
ICON 5 - FIRE MISSILE

FULL SCALE BATTLE TAKES PLACE AGAINST A BACKDROP SIMILAR TO THAT USED FOR THE
MAIN LANDSCAPE DISPLAY. ARMY UNITS ARE SHOWN AS GROUPS OF MEN WHICH MOVE
REALISTICALLY OVER THE CONTOURS.BEFORE THE FIGHTING TAKES PLACE,THE UNITS FROM
BOTH SIDES MARCH ONE AT A TIME ONTO THE FIELD AND TAKE UP POSITION.THE UNITS
ARE POSITIONED IN EITHER A CENTRE OF FLANK POSITION DEPENDING ON THEIR
STRENGTHS. THE FASTER OR MISSILE BEARING TROOPS WILL TAKE FLANKS AND THE
HEAVIEST TROOPS THE CENTRE.

THE OUTCOME OF THE BATTLE DEPENDS ON TACTICAL ELEMENTS AND NOT JUST THE SIZE 
OF THE ARMIES. TERRAIN POSITION IS ALSO A FACTOR - UNITS ON HIGH GROUND HAVE
AN ADVANTAGE.

PLAYER TIME TO VIEW TROOPS ON BOTH SIDES AND FORM A STRATEGY.NOTE; THAT EXTRA
UNITS MAY ENTER THE BATTLE AFTER IT HAS BEGUN.
