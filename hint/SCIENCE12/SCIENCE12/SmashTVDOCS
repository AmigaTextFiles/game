 Gameplay
 --------

 The cheering from the ecstatic crowd fades away as you leave the safety of
 the studio and enter the first of the four insanely dangerous and devious,
 gaming arenas. Instantly you are set upon by horeds of thugs wielding
 baseball bats. Each with only one intent - beating the living daylights
 out of you! Deal with these guys if you can, there are lots of them. Use
 your skill to navigate the arenas and collect power-ups, speed ups, spinning
 shurikans, Mace balls, grenafe and rocket launchers,
 multiples and, of course, smart bombs. All of these items will increase your
 ability to wreak havoc pon the mindless meatheads. Watch out for mines
 though! Wall mounted gunners and tanks will constantly make your task just
 that bit harder than it already is. However, you will find yourself
 relentlessly  driven on by the lure of the countless prizes awaiting you.
 It dosn`t seem so bad to be risking life and limb when you are winning
 holidays, sleek roadsters, luggage and of course, mindbending amounts of
 cash. As you progress through the game zones you will encounter floating
 droids, electric pulse generating orbs, poisonous snakes, walking time
 bombs, mutant lizard men, and countless other mechanical and biological
 opponents. However, you havn`t seen the worst of it yet Prepare yourself
 for the end-of-level baddies who will make you regret your dicision to
 enter this gladiatorial-like game at all! For example, at the end of level
 one, you will encounter a huge mutant skinhead on a tank. He will do his
 upmost to cruse you underfoot (and track) - and he is the easiest opponent
 of them all! If you make it through all four of the nightmarish game zones
 you will confront your final and most lethal challenge. The game show host
 himself. Sounds Easy? Thank again - he`s insane enormouse and can only
 understand one thing...

 TOTAL CARNAGE

 Defeat him if you can - the rewards are well worth it. Good luck, And
 Remember....

 Smile Your On TV!.
