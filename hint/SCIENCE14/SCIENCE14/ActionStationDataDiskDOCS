ACTION STATIONS! SCENARIO DISK AMIGA ADDENDUM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. For your convenience it is not necessary to copy "SHIP FILES" onto
   existing dleet disks as all ships from orginal "Action Stations!S
   have been included in the ship files for the scenario disks.
2. Owing to technical reason DDFGEN33 Was not able to be implemented on
   the Amiga Version..
3. The "Swap/Add" utility isa now included under the new version of
   "C SCENE" on Scenario/Fleet disk. To use this feature load a sceanrio
   and then use modify/delete to alter ships.

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Thank You for purchasing SSU Data Disk Utility programs,
28 new ship classes and 13 new scenarios we're sure you are in for a
great gaming experience.

You will need to do some disk housekeeping to get things rolling.

If you have a HARD DRIVE, you should have all your Action Stations!
programs on one directory, Use the XCOPY command to copy the contents
of the SSUI disk onto that directory

If you hava FLOPPY DRIVE, you will have to copy some files on to specific
FLEET disks. Make sure you have room for them by deleting on or more
scenario files off the disks(of course, keeping the scenario files on another
disk!).

(all of the files listed below have the suffix .SHP.)

Copy on to your PACIFIC disk the files MI IV TN TS BZ DM WI SU YS OZ 65 F1 M4
N4 F2.

Copy on your ATLANTIC disk the files LN VD IC RW BK SW CX FU SY D2 H2 H5
CP HO RU DK LA.

S -1. UTILITY PROGRAMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A. Swap Add
~~~~~~~~~~~
Swap - Add is a simple program which allows you to take an existing scenario
and swap ship clases, add additional ships, or delete ships. It is both
simpler and quicker to use this program instead of loading the scenario
into the CSCENE scenario editor.

1. Starting the program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hard drive: The program SWAP - ADD.EXE should be placed on your hard disk,
in the same directory as the rest of your ACTION STATION! files.

Floppy: SWAP - ADD.EXE and BRUN20.EXE should be on the floppy in the drive
which  is currently active.

To start: Type SWAP - ADD <RET>

2. Loading The Scenario
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The program will load, and then ask you to "type the file name of the
scenario (without .SCN) and <RET>". For example, the file name of the mers
- el - Kabir scenario is KABIR.SCN;to load it, you would type KABIR
followed by hitting the return key.

Throughout this manual, <RET> means hit the return key. in all the utilities
, data and choices will be entered and followed by a <RET>.

3. Initial Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The program then gives you the option to list the Blue ships, the RED ships,
or both sides, By selecting to display only one side, you can preserve some
of the uncertainty as to the other sides exact compostition of forces.

4. Ship Listing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Ship display lists the number of the ship, the individual ship's name,
and the ship's class. For example,

5 MISSOURI/IOWA
indicates that ship number 5 is named the MISSOURI, and is one of the IOWA
class.

Blue force ships are printed in white text on a blue background. Red force
ships are printed in black text on a grey background.

5. Operations Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
5.1 Swap a ship allows you to replace a ship with a new ship. you can use
any ship class for which you have a .SHP file - there are no restrictions
as to the nationality or size. You will be asked for the number of the ship
to be replaced, and the two letter code of the new class. For example,
to replace

5 MISSOURI/IOWA

with a four piper destroyer, you would enter 1 <RET> to begin the swap:
the program would then ask you to enter the ships number (5), and two
character class code of the class (FP).

Floppy disk owners must have the disk containing that ship file in their
active drive. if it is notm you will get an error  message and the program
will terminate (think of it as a challenge...).

The new ship will be placed in the scenario with the course, speed, and
location of ythe ship that it replaces. Iyt will be undamaged and with
full ammunition loads. You will then be requested to enter the new ship's
name (which must be 8 characters or less), radar,crew quality, and number of
aircarft onboard (aircraft will not be requested if that class did not have
the ability to carry them.)

5.2 Add a ship allows you to add additional ships to the scenario. The
program will ask you the number of the new ships, prompting you with the
range of numbers available to add a ship to either the Blue or the Red side.
The other ships will be moved over in number to make room for the new ship.
for example. if the Blue side had ships #1 and #2, and the Red ship #2 would
be renumbered as #3, and the Red ship#3 would be renumbered  as #4

After entering the desired ship number and two characters class code is
entered, you will be prompted to supply the ship's name,rader, crew quality
and number of aircarft(if installed). Since this ship is not replacing
another, you will aslo be asked to provide the ship's speed, course, X and Y
coordinate, formation number, and posisition number within the information

You will not be able to add ships in the scneraio will axceed 49.

5.3 Delete a ship allows you to cut ships out of the sacenario. You will be
asked foe the number of the ship to be cut. The numbers of the other ships
willbe adjusted as appropriate to fill in the gap.

5.4 Save scenario - when you are completed with modifications, select this
option. You will be prompted to provide the name for the file. The file
name must be 8 characters or less, and conform to the DOS file naming
restrictions. The scenario will be saved in standard Action Stations!
scenario file format, with a .SCN suffix. For example, if you call your
new scenario TORPEDO. SWAP - ADD will save the scenario in the file
TORPEDO.SCN

Note that if you name the scenario with the same name as an existing scenario,
the old file be overwritten, and you will loose that scenariol

5.5 Abort - several menus include an ABORT option, invoking this option will
terminate the program. The file loaded into the program (+ any changes) will
NOT be saved.

B.DDFGEN33
The program DDFGEN33 allows you to create fleets for use in the GEN33 program.

Gen33 creates scenarios pitting various nation's fleets against each other.
It is told which individual ship classes are in each fleet by the DDF file
(DDF stands for Disk Definition File). for use with a hard drive and the
original GENERATE program, there is one DDF file which defines all the Fleets
if you are using floppy disks, there is a DDF file on each disk which defines
the fleets and ships classes on that disk. for example, the DDF file on
the PAC disk defines the ships that are in the Japenesed and U.S fleets.
GEN33 is the replacement for the GENERATE program, and you can build the
replacement DDF file using the utility DDFGEN33.

The program DDFGEN33 allows you to define your own fleets. By Running
this program. you will be able to tailor the composition of the fleet to
ypour own desires, including limiting the numbers of ships in each class.
There are no restrictions on how you mix - and - match your fleets.: if you
want to have a mixture of British and Russian battleships, japanese cruisers
and italian destroyer classes marking up a single fleet, have fun!

For floopy disk owners, the DDF file you create allows you to specify which
nationality is on the disk. All of the ship classes named in the DDF file
must be on that disk. When you run GEN33, and the DDF file states that a
particular class ship is in that navy, GEN33 may try to include it in a game;
if that class file is not on the disk, you will recieve a "file not found"
error message and program will terminate.

Because of the DOS limitation on the number of files which can be on a
single disk, you probably will be limited to only one or two navies per disk.

The different DDf file and identified to the DDFGEN33 and GEN33 programs by
the letters A through Z. They are stored with the file names DDF - A.
DDF,DDF - B. DDF, etc. There are two files provided. The "A" file (DDF -A.
DDF) is the historical fleets, including limits on each class. It includes
all the ship files issued to date in the PAC,LANT,MED,SSU#1 and SSU #2 disk
The "Z" file (DDF-Z.DDF)is the "ZERO" file, and has no ships assigned to
any of the fleets; It is provided as a clean slate, if you should want to
build up a fleet from scratch.

Because of space limitations on SSU disk #2, you will have to run the
DDFGEN33 program to build the DDF files for the FLEET disks that you
already own. If you want to use them with the new GEN33 program. Just run
the DFFGEN33 program, selecting the historical option, and selecting
the following combinations of fleets to be included:

- for the PAC disk, build a DDF file containing the Japanese and Us fleets
- for the LANT disk, build a DDF file containing the UK and German fleets
- for the MEd disk, build a DDF file containing the Italian,French,Russian
  fleets

Gen33 includes the capability of loading different DFF files. The program
will tell you which nationality has been selected for the battle
(or that you have manually selected), and requested that you designate
the appropriate DDF file to be used. It will then use the ships in the fleet
as designated in the DDF file to create the battle.

1. Starting The Program

Hard Drive: The program DDFGEN33.EXE and the files DDF - A.DDF and DDF-Z.FF
should be placed on your hard disk. in the same directory as the rest
of your Action Station! files.

Floppy: DDFGEN33.EXE should be on the floppy in the drive which is currently
active. After the program is begun, you can remove that floppy.

To Start: Type DDFGEN33<RET>

2. Initial Menu

The initial menu asks you for a starting place from to begin constructing
your tailored fleets:

- Option 1 is to begin with the historical fleets.
- Option 2 is to begin with a previous DDF file. if you have previously
  create a fleet, and now wish to modify it, you can reload the old DDF
  file. You identify that you eant to retrieve by a single letter, A through
  Z. The "A" file is provided on the SSU#2 disk, and is the "historical"
  fleets. The "Z" file is also on the SSU#2 disk, and is a blank file.
- Option 3 is a "clean slate", where you begin without any ships in any fleet

To choose an option, you enter the number followed by <RET>. if you
should desire to begin with a pevious DDF file (Say."X"). you would enter
2 <RET> where upon you would be prompted to enter the letter of the
desired DDF file. In this case. enter X <RET>. A note would be printed
identifying the fiule (more on this later) . you would then be given
the opportunity to load a different file, if you had accidently requested
the wrong file.

3. Initial Class Limits Options

The nest option is to select whether you desire "historical class size" or
"unlimited class size". The descision simply determines the starting
point, and does not mean tha you are locked in to using those numbers. You
can always enter the program and change them, as described below.

For the "historical" option, the computer uses pre-determined limits based
on what was either planned or built of that particular class. if you do not
agree with these numbers, you can go back and change them.

For the "unlimited" option, the computer will just use 50 as the maximum
number of ships in a class. Considering that the GENERATE program has room
for only a maximum of 22 ships on a side, this is more than enough!

5. Ship Listing

You will then enter the display of the specific ship included in each fleet.
For each nationality. you will page through a seperate display of the
battleships,cruisers, and destroyers assigned to the fleet. It is possible
to crossassign types, i.e list a destroyer class ship in the battleship
type display, but that wull cause some weird scenarios to come out of the
GEN33 program (result not guaranteed!).

The ship displays will sequence through each nation, with the first page
for battleships, the second page for cruisers, the third for destroyers.
The top labels:
           Class Number : The Numerical Order Of The Classes In The Display;
           Class Code: The Two - letter code associated with that ship file;
           Class Name: "IOWA", "BISMARCK", ETc;
           Limit:  The Number Of Ships In That Class.

6. Ship Listing Options

From the ship listing screen. you have the following options:

6.1 Add class allows you to add a class of ship to the nationality and type
currently displayed. you can add any of the ships included in either the
original game disks or the SSU disks. The menu selection will walk you
through the process. You will need the two - character class identidier.
A maximum of 20 classes can be specidied per type. You can add. for
example, destoryers to the battleship list; however, you will then have the
potential to get odd results when you use GEN33 to generate scenarios.

6.2 Delete Class removes a class from the list. You will be asked to enter
the number of the class the SHIP LIST display

6.3 Change limit allows you to change the number of ships associated with
that class. For example, the British battleship HOOD class had only one
ship - using CHANGE LIMIT. you could increase that number to whatever you
desired.

6.4 Re list refers to the SHIP LISTING screen.

6.5 Next Type moves you to the next type of ship. If you were working
on British battleships, the next type would be cruisers, followed by
destroyers.

6.6 Next Nation sequences to the next nationality.

6.7 Saves shifts you to the SAVE FILE routine. You will be asked to
specify  the letter identifying this file, and a comment. The comment
allows you to imbed an identification of the file, in case you forget the
file contents!. The comment is displayes in the DDFGEN33 and GEN££ programs
after you load the file, with an option to back up and load a different file.

6.8 Abort terminates the program. no files are changed or saved.

6.9 Summary shifts you to a summary display. It shows you how many classes
of each type are included in the fleet, and the total number of ships of
each type. From this display you have the option to go to the save routine,
or to go back and make further modifications to your fleets.
