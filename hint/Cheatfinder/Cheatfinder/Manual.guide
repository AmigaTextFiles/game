@node Intro

With Cheatfinder it's possible to examine games for cheats and passwords.
It's even possible to view messages, which are normally only seen
in the game.

Cheatfinder works with every game where cheats or passwords are displayed
as text on the screen. The game has to a file which is not compressed.

The gadgets

Load game:
Opens a file selector to choose a game you want to examine for cheats.
Depending on file length this can take some time.

Cheat length:
If you click inside this textzone, you can choose the minimum length of
cheats and passwords. "5" for example means, that the program searches
only for words larger than five characters.

Output file:
With this textzone you can choose the output file for the cheats
file.

Text viewer:
Here you can choose the text viewer for the cheats file.

View:
Views the cheat file. After the text viewer has been loaded you'll see
every found word. It's very unpossible that all of these words are
cheats. Most of them will be:

 screen text of the game
 names of libraries, devices or files the game needs to run
 program code

So if you see something like "graphics.library" it won't be a cheat
it's just a file the game needs to run.

So how do I know if it's a cheat or not?

If you've already found a cheat or password, which consists only of numbers
for example, and you'll see many numbers in the cheats file, it's very
possible that you've just discovered a password.
Or just look for words that look like other cheats or passwords
(eg. "infinite").

To activate a cheat you have to enter the word at the title picture or
while you are playing the game.

The four tick gadgets:
With these gadgets you can choose, what is to be examines.
You can choose whether the program should search for everything, uppercase
lowercase or numbers.
If a password in a game consists only of uppercase-letters, you must only
click the uppercase-gadget. It's the same with numbers or lowercase-letters.
Everything searches for everything but even for characters like 키⒭.
