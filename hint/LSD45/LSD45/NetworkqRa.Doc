this option allows players to try out the cars on any of three special

to fuckup first on :)

RESULTS
~~~~~~~

here you can view the best times for the current stage of the game in
progress. ie if you are twelth then the best times up to 12th will be
shown. time is shown as that behind the leader ie if leader is 02.30.00
then car 2 may be shown as +00.05.00 ( 5 secs down) . If you manage to
complete all 35 stages you will go to the trophy screen listing to shown
all top three champions. clicking mouse will go to the reults list.

PLAYING THE FULL GAME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before embarking on a full rally you should go to the rally setup menu to
setup the number of human players required and decide which cars they will
drive. You can even force the computer to drive the cars of your choice
(except a Skoda :) )

to start a full rally click on new rally and 3 screens will appear to show
the stages from a world map to the rally course and to the day 1 stages.

the rally covers 350 miles of special stages, and as you progress through
the event a pulsing red box will show your progress on the event and day
maps. continue past these maps to a map of the next stage your on.

before you start a stage you are given a map of the route which gives info
on conditions mileage road type and weather. use this info to choose tyres
to fit. ordinary tarmac tyres get seriously fucked on forest roads !
click on the tyres option to select the type you want then click on change
to fit them. when you are happy  continue to the time report screen.

before beginning a stage you must decide whether or not you can afford to
spend time on repairs. you must reach the checkpoint before a certain time
to avoid going out of the rally. so you dont always have the time. so make
repairs when you can or risk getting bombed out of the event!

It is vital you repair the car to be competitive...performance is affected
and will slow you down. bear in mind the event is very hard and the harder
you drive the more wear and tear you will get on the car.

WHAT CAN GO WRONG !
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Exhaust:  this will slowly deteriorate through normal wear and tear, but
landing hard after the car goes airborne wont do it much good.

Turbo: Constantly driving flat out will shorten its life.

Windscreen:  hitting bushes,trees and other objects will chip the screen,
and eventually the whole screen will shatter..the car becomes undriveable!

Gearbox:  changing down gears too soon can damage the box ..just think of
changing down from 5th to 1st at 100MPH ! hehehehe BOOM !

Sump: flying over humps at high speeds will damage the sump

Cylinder Head: if you change gears manually and keep over-revving the
engine will go " pop " and you blow the cylinder head..silly person ! :)

Suspension :  Braking hard and jumping crests will seriously fuck the
suspension buddy !

Clutch :  The clutch wears out through normal usage

Brakes : hard braking too often " cooks " the pads and when hot you get
brake fade ... no brakes 100mph woosh...off the stage into a ditch hhehehe

Any problems that do occur will be listed with colour codes. a green fault
isn't to bad and the car can continue on the next stage. Yellow is fairly
serious and should be fixed when time allows... its slowing you down! A Red
fault is TERMINAL and must be dealt with immediately or the car DIES :) on
the next stage.... out you go !..early to bed.

When servicing is complete you can drive to the next stage and start.


DRIVING A STAGE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Rally requires a lot of practice to handle the car. remember the default
keys... the simple rule is GET TO THE END OF THE STAGE within the current
time limit and your time is recorded when you pass the red flag at the
flying finish. when you reach the end of the stage it is up to you to stop
the car at the STOP sign... if you dont the car may be damaged. during the
stage you will pass checkpoints each one gives your current time and that
compared to the fastest on the stage. the difference will be displayed at
the top right of screen.

keys to use during the game :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+		increase drawing depth of the road
-		decrease drawing depth
+ (num pad)	increase depth of sprites
- (num pad)	decrease depth of sprites
F8		turn road texture on/off
F9		turn playfield texture on/off
F10		Pause on/off
F11		calibrate joystick
F1-F7		toggle various display and cheat modes on/off
control+ESC	retires driver from Rally


PC-only MEMORY MANAGEMENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Rally does its best to load the entire game to memory. more than 640K is
recommended to play the game.Some animation is discarded to preserve
memory. if not enough then rally will quit. try to reconfigure your pc's
boot up options by changing the CONFIG.sys and AUTOEXEC.bat files. try
removing unnecesary memory resident programs and if you have MS Dos 6 use
MEMMAKER utility to free base memory.

RALLY also requires EMS memory to load the following:

Sound sample for 3-2-1-GO!
Sampled speech for spoken pace notes.
sampled Sound Effects.

Rally attempts to load each item in the order listed until all are loaded
or untill Rally runs out of EMS memory. If you have a memory manager such
as QEMM or EMM386 set up in your CONFIG.sys file, make sure that the NOEMS
command is not included on the command line, as follows:

change:
       DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE RAM NOEMS HIGHSCAN
                                    ~~~~~
TO:    DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE RAM HIGHSCAN



PACE NOTES
~~~~~~~~~~

Ina rally car the driver is only one half of the team. The co-driver has an
important role in telling the driver what to expect on the road ahead. He
does this with pace notes which are short decriptions of various raod
features and obstacles such as corners and dips. the standard dialect used
for pacenotes consistes of :

spoken				Dashboard
~~~~~~				~~~~~~~~~
long straight			LONG STRT
left x 				L x
right x 			R x
up left x			UP L x
up right x			UP R x
down left x 			DOWN L x
down right x			DOWN R x
left hairpin			L HP
right hairpin			R HP
narrows				NARROWS
hump in road (ooer!)		HUMP
road dips			DIPS
flying finish			FF

" x " will be a number between 1 and 7. these number tell the driver how
severe the corner is.

1 =    _____     2 =     ____    3 =    ____    4 =   ______
       |                /              /             /

       |                |            |             /
       |                |            |             |
         90∞              75∞           60∞            45∞


5 =       ._/     6 =        _/         7 =        ./
        ./                  /                    ./
       /                   /                   ./ 
      /                   /                   / 
        30∞                  15∞                    slight bend


WARNING
~~~~~~~

the pace notes are done a 15mph and dont reflect every bend or dip/crest to
beware of hidden twist and turns not noted on the pace notes ! it happens
in real rallying ! too.
