COMPATABILITY NOTE
We  have  found  that  several other painting and viewing programs incor
rectly  assume  that  the  palette will contain no more than the maximum
number of colours in the pictures display mode.  These programs will not
correctly  load  a picture saved with the Colour Set.  At this time, for
maximum  compatability any pictures you are distributing should br saved
with  no  colours  in  the Colour Set beyond the Palette colours You can
delete  the  colours in your Colour Set with the Delete button in just a
few  steps.   We hope that in the near future these other pro grams will
correctly  ignore  the  extra  colours in the Colour Set if they are not
able to use them.

Modifying Colours
DeluxePaint  V  lets  you  modify colours with either the RGB or the HSV
colour  mixing  systems.    Let's  say  you want to modify an individual
colour to use in the foreground.  Here's how to do it.

Click  the  colour  you  want to modify either in the requester's row of
colours or wherever the colour appears on the page.  The selected colour
is displayed in the sample-colour box.

You  can  use  the up and down arrows at the right end of the palette to
expose  the  next  row  of  16 colours.  You can also Shift click on the
arrows to scroll directly to the first or last row of colours.

Move  the box(es) inside the slider(s) to modify the selected colour, by
varying  the  proportions of Red, Green, and Blue (RGB).  To move a box,
click  on  either side of it (inside the slider) or drag the box left or
right.

The  HSV  method  of colour mixing yields identical results.  HSV breaks
each colour down into its Hue, Saturation, and Value. 

Hue  refers to the colours position on the colour spectrum.  As you move
the  box  along  the  Hue  slider (starting from the left), your current
colour  changes  to  a  shade  of  the  following colours - Red, Orange,
Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, and Red.

Saturation  refers  to the strength of the particular hue and the extent
to which the strength is "diluted" by some proportion of white.  If your
current  colour  has  a  saturation  setting  of  zero,  your  colour is
necessarily white.

Value refers to the amount of light a colour reflects off a surface (and
therefore,  the  absence  or  presence  of black).  A colour with a high
Value  setting  has  little  or no black, whereas colours with low Value
settings contain more black.  No matter what settings you've entered for
Hue and Saturation, a Value setting of zero produces pure black.

In  the  requester,  the  RGB  system uses a 256 point scale (0-255) for
colour values in AGA or 24-bit mode, while HSV method uses two different
types of measurement.  Hue is referred to in degrees of the Coloyr Wheel
(0-360  degrees)  and  saturation  and Value are measured in percentages
(0-100%).

(See Tutorial One in Chapter Four: Painting Tutorials for an explanation
of colour mixing in RGB or HSV).

Copy
Use the COPY button to copy a colour from your picture or the palette.

Select the colour you want to copy.                                  

Click COPY. The dropper icon cursor appears attached to the cursor.

Click  the  slot  in  the  requester into which you want to copy the new
colour.

Spread
Spread helps you quickly create a spread of shades between two colours.

Select the first colour from the palette                              

Click SPREAD. The dropper icon cursor appears attached to the cursor.

Click the second colour.

Deluxe  Paint  creates  a uniform spread of colours, taking into account
the  beginning and ending shades and the number of colours in between in
your palette.

EX
Use  the  EX  button  to  exchange  the  positions of two colours in the
palette.

Select the first colour from the row of colours.

Click EX. The dropper icon cursor appears attached to the cursor.

Click the second colour.

If  you  use  EX to rearrange the colours in your palette, the resulting
screen  image will likely be in the wrong colours.  You can correct this
by choosing Remap from the Colour menu.

You should remap immediately after you change the colour arrange ment in
the  palette.    If  you  modify the palette a second time without first
re-mapping, you will not be able to remap to the original palette.

SELECT
SELECT lets you select a range of colours from the palette.

Select the first colour from the palette.

Click SELECT. The dropper icon cursor appears attached to the cursor.

Click the second colour.                                              

The  colours from the first colour up to and including the second colour
are selected.

You  can  also  use  keyboard shortcuts to select a contiguous or discon
tiguous range of colours:

To  seolect  a  contiguous range of colours, click the first colour, and
then hold the Alt key while clicking the second colour.

To  select  a  discontiguous range of colours, Shift-click on any colour
The  colour  you  Shift  clicked  on is added to the previously selected
colours, which are still selected

DELETE
Use DELETE to remove one or more colours from the colour set.
 
Click a colour you want to delete.

Click DELETE. The dropper icon cursor appears attached to the cursor.

If  you  want  to  delete  only  one colour, click on that colour in the
colour  set.  The colour will be deleted and the slot it occupied in the
colour set will be empty.

If  you  want to delete more than one colour, a range for example, click
the  first  colour  in  the  range;  click SELECT; move the dropper icon
cursor  to  the  last  colour in the range; and click the colour.  Click
DELETE, and Deluxe Paint deletes all colours between the selected colour
in the sample colour box and the colour you clicked on.

Use  the  eye  dropper  icon  in  the lower right corner of the panel to
select a new foreground or background colour for your palette.

Click  the  Dropper  icon.  The pointer changes to an eye dropper cursor
(You  can  also display the eye dropper cursor by pressing the comma key
",").

Position  the  point of the eye dropper on the colour you want to become
the new foreground or background colour.

Click  to  make  the  colour  you clicked on the new foreground colour. 
Right click to make it the new background colour.

To copy your new colour into the palette, use COPY.

REVERT
You  can  clear  the  changes  you  made in the Colour Mixer by clicking
REVERT.    With  the  exception  of  the  mixing  area, this returns the
requester to the condition it was in before you displayed the Mixer.

UNDO
You can reverse the last change you made in the Colour Mixer by clicking
UNDO.

SCALE
You  can  convert your old IFF RGB4 values (0 to 15 - almost any of your
IFF  pictures created with previous programs) to RGB8 values (0 to 255).

GRID
Click  the GRID check gadget to turn the highlight on the top left edges
of the colours in the palette on and off.

Colour Mixing Area
Use  the  mixing  area  to interactively mix colours to create new ones,
and,  if  you wish, add colours to your palette.  You can use colours in
the picture, colours from the palette, and colours you mix to create new
shades.    Using  your  current  built in or custom brush you can select
colours  from the palette (one at a time), paint with them in the mixing
area, and mix them with other colours.

Creating a New Colour
You can create a new colour in the Mixing Area in three basic ways:

1.    Mix  a  selected  colour in the mixing area with one or more other
select  ed  colours.  The resulting colour can be a new colour.  Use the
Pick icon to select the colour and add it to the selected colour cell.

2.bb  Edit a colour by adjusting its values with the RGB/HSV sliders.

3.    Drop  colours  in  the  mixer 'wells' at either end of the mixer. 
Deluxe  Paint  creates a spread between the two colours at either end of
the  mixer.   You can then add any of the spread colours to your palette
or colour set one at a time.

Here's  a  step  by  step example of how to select a colour from the cur
rent  picture,  edit  it,  mix it with another colour, and add it to the
palette.                                                                

Selecting a Colour

With  a  picture  on your screen and the Colour Mixer exposed, click the
dropper action button.

Move the dropper cursor to the picture and click on a colour.

The  colour you clicked on automatically becomes the current fore ground
colour.    It appears in the sample colour box, so you can paint with it
immediately.   The colour slot of the new colour appears high lighted or
indented in the colour set.

To  select  multiple  colours from the palette, use the SELECT button or
Shift-click to select each colour.

To select a range of colours from the palette, click to select the first
colour  in  the range, and then Alt-click on the last colour you wish to
select in the range.
 
Only one colour can be edited at once. To edit the selected colour:

Drag  one  or  more of the RGB/HSV sliders to change the colour val ues,
which changes the colour itself.

Mixing a Colour

Click a medium sized built-in brush and paint in the mixing area.

Choose  another  colour  and  paint  over the first colour in the mixing
area.   As you combine the two colours, new shades are created.  You can
repeat this step as often as you like.

When  you  have  created a colour you want to use, click the slot in the
colour set where you want to place the new colour.

Click  the  eye  dropper  button: click the colour in the mixing area to
make that shade the new colour.

Clearing the Mixing Area

You can clear the Mixing Area to any colour by copying the colour to it.
Here's how:

Select the colour you want to clear the Mixing Area to.

Click COPY. The dropper icon appears attached to the cursor.

Click the in the Mixing Area. It is cleared to the colour you selected.

Arrange
Keyboard Equivalent:P 

Shows  the  Arrange  requester.  It displays all 256 colours of a Colour
Set  (8  rows  [128  colours]  at  a time).  Clicking on the up and down
arrows scrolls through the colour set one row at a time (16 colours in a
row).  Shift-click ing on an arrow scrolls 4 rows at a time.  Arrange is
helpful  if  you  want to copy exchange or spread colours over more than
one  row at a time.  The Arrange requester will replace the Colour Mixer
if it is open.

Use the Arrange requester to create and organise colours in your palette
or  delete  colours.    It  lets  you  delete colours easily so that new
colours can be added to the current 256-colour set.

The  action  buttons in the Arrange requester work exactly as they do in
the Colour Mixer.  See above.

Use Brush Palette
When  you  load  a  brush  from  disk, Deluxe Paint continues to use the
current  picture  palette,  even though it may be different from the one
the  brush  was  created  with.  Use Brush Palette switches to the brush
palette,  and  includes  any  information  about colour cycling that was
saved  with the brush.  If the newly loaded brush uses more colours than
the current picture, Use Brush Palette switches to the brush palette and
reduces  the  number of colours to that of the picture palette.  It does
so  by  recomputing  the  palette  to  match  the original as closely as
possible  with fewer colours.  After choosing Use Brush Palette, you can
still revert to the original picture palette by choosing Restore Palette
(see below).

Compare  Use  Brush Palette with Remap in the Colour menu: this com mand
lets  you  keep  the  current picture palette, but maps the brush to the
picture palette to match the original brush as closely as possible.

Restore Palette
Returns  you  to  the palette you were using before the current palette.
Thus,  if  you  load a picture with a different palette, Restore Palette
reverts  to  the  palette in effect before the load.  See also Use Brush
Palette, above, and Default Palette, below.                            

Default Palette
The  default  palette  is  the  palette Deluxe Paint uses when you first
start  the  program.    The Default Palette command replaces the current
palette  with  the  default  palette  and resets any ranges you may have
created to its (their) default state.

Load
Load a palette that you have previously saved, without loading an image.
The  Load  Palette  requester works just like the Load Picture requester
(see Load under the Picture menu).  When you load a palette, the palette
colours  overwrite  your  current  palette  directly.    Compare this to
loading a Colour Set, explained below.                                 

Save
Save  a  palette  without  saving the image.  The Save Palette requester
works  just  like the Save Picture requester (see Save under the Picture
menu).   Only the Base Register colours (those colours that appear below
the Toolbox) are saved, NOT the entire colour set.

Colour Set

Load
Displays  the Load Colour Set requester.  This requester works just like
the Load Picture requester (see Load under the Picture menu).

Once  you've  selected  the Colour Set file you want to load and clicked
Load in the first requester, a second Load Colour Set requester appears.

This  requester lets you choose which colours from the Colour Set are to
be  loadcd  into  your  current colour set.  To select colours, click on
them.    Click on a colour a second time to deselect it.  The All button
selects  all  colours  in the Colour Set.  The None button deselects all
colours.   The Base button selects only the colours in the palette (base
registers).                                                            

Once  you have selected the colours you want to load, you can either Add
them  to  your  Colour  Set or Overwrite the current Colour Set.  If you
choose  Add,  the colours are added beginning in the first empty slot of
your  current  Colour  Set.  Colours will be added only until the Colour
Set is full.

If  you choose Overwrite, the colours you have selected are entered into
your  current  Colour  Set  beginning  at  colour  0 and the new colours
overwrite the previously existing colours.                             

If you change your mind and decide not to load any colours, click Cancel
in the requester.

Save
Saves  a  256  colour  set  as  a  separate  file.   The Save Colour Set
requester works just like the Save Picture requester (see Save under the
Picture menu).                                                         

Bg>Fg
Changes  all  pixels  that  use the current background colour to use the
current  foreground  colour.    This provides an easy method of changing
colours  glob  ally  all  pixels in the current background colour in the
picture are changed to the current foreground colour.  The change occurs
on-screen  only  and  does  not  affect the order of color in the colour
palette.   This is a quick and easy way to swap the colors of your image
without modifying the palette.

Undo does not reverse this change.

Bg<->Fg
Swaps  all pixels in the current background colour with the current fore
ground  colour.  This is similar to the Bg->Fg option above, except that
the  change occurs in both directions.  The change occurs on screen only
and does not affect the order of colours in the colour palette.

Undo does not reverse this change.

Remap
When  you  create a picture, Deluxe Paint "remembers" each colour on the
screen  by remembering its location in the palette.  If a picture on the
screen  was  created  with a palette other than the current palette (for
example,  if  you  have modified the palette since loading the picture),
Remap finds the loca tions in the current palette of the colours it used
in  the  original  palette  and  tells the picture to look there for its
colours.    Bg->Fg  and Bg<->Fg, above, are special cases of Remap.  See
also Remap under the Brush option of the Colour menu, below.

Undo does not reverse this change.

Recompute
This  option  is  only  available  in HAM mode or higher.  Choosing this
option  recomputes  the  picture  data by doing a remap with the current
palette.    If  you  have  loaded  a HAM image from a different program,
Recompute  may  reduce  the fringing effects you see when moving a brush
across the screen.

In  24-bit  mode,  Recompute  produces  the best screen palette from the
24-bit  data  currently  in  memory.  See Appendix E: The 24-Bit Backing
Store for more information.

Brush >>

Use the options in the submenu to modify the current brush colours.

Bg->Fg
Changes  all  pixels  in  the  brush  that are in the current background
colour into the current foreground colour.  This provides an easy method
of  making  a  global  colour  change  - all instances of the background
colour  in  the  brush  are  changed  to  the current foreground colour.
Because  you can select any colour in the brush as either the foreground
or  the  background  colour  at  any time, you can make intricate colour
changes  easily.  This operation affects the brush colours only and does
not affect the picture or the order of colours in the palette.

Bg<->Fg
Swaps  the  current background colour in the brush with the current fore
ground  colour.    This is similar to the Bg->Fg option, except that the
change  occurs in both directions.  The change affects the brush colours
only  and  does  not  affect  the picture or the order of colours in the
palette.

Remap
Use  Remap  when you load a brush that uses a palette different from the
current palette.  Remap looks at the colours used in the brush and tries
to  find  the  closest  fit  within the current palette.  This option is
different  from Use Brush Palette in that it does not change the picture
palette.    Instead  it changes the palette locations the brush looks at
for its colours.  You can per form this operation on AnimBrushes and all
frames of the animated brush will be remapped.

Change Transparency
Lets  you change the transparency colour of the currently selected brush
to the current background colour.

Effect Menu

The  Effect menu contains several special features.  Its options let you
create  stencils, "freeze" the background, and define planes for drawing
in perspec tive.

Stencil >>

Creating  a stencil allows you to paint around an image without painting
on it, as though it were protected by a frisket.  Create a stencil of an
image  in  either  of  two ways (painting and locking), or by using both
ways  together.   You can "paint" an area to mask.  See Paint, below, or
"lock" the colours that comprise that image.
 
A  stencil  will  also apply to the brush when it is captured.  Whatever
colours  in  the  brush  were  locked  when  the stencil was made become
transparent in the brush.

When you have a stencil active, an "S" appears in the Title Bar.

Show
Show  dims the colours in your picture and displays the stencilled areas
of  your  picture  (if any) in a contrasting lighter colour.  The "S" in
the  Title  Bar  changes  to "s".  You can't paint on your picture while
Show is active.  Click to return to your picture.                      

Make
Keyboard Equivalent: ~ (tilde, below Esc)
This  displays  the  Make  Stencil  requester.    You can reposition the
requester anywhere on the screen by dragging the Title bar. 

To make a stencil:
 
Click the colours you want to use to create the stencil.  You can select
colours by clicking them in the requester's palette, by clicking colours
in your picture, or by clicking colours in the main palette.

When you have clicked all the colours you want to protect, click MAKE.
 
The  colours  you  select define a mask that protects an area from being
paint  ed  over.  The shape of the stencil is what is created and saved,
not  the colour information, which means you can change the colours of a
"stencilled" shape, and still retain the stencil.

If you have several animation frames, Deluxe Paint automatically remakes
the  stencil  as you move from one frame to the next, either manually or
while using the Move requester.

CLEAR: Clears the current colour selections in the requester.

INVERT:  Inverts  the  current colour selections.  This is useful if you
want to mask more colours than you want to leave unmasked.

When  you  are using HAM or 24 bit backing store mode, your Make Stencil
requester  also  contains  a  Show  button,  a  Fine  Tune  button and a
Tolerance  edit  field.    These  options  are explained in detail, with
examples, in Turorial Five of Chapter 4: Painting Tutorials.

Show  toggles the show stencil function on and off.  This works like the
Stencil>Show option in the Effect menu.                                

Fine Tune lets you add or subtract individual colours from the stencil.

The  Tolerance  edit  field  lets  you  click on a singlc colour in your
picture  and  simultaneously  lock (or unlock) all "similiar" colours in
the  image.   The Tolerance number determines how different a colour can
be  and  still be considered "similar" to the one you clicked on.  A low
Tolerance number requires that the colours be very similar, while a high
Tolerance  number  locks  colours  that  may  be very different from the
colour  you  clicked.  The range of Tolerance values from 0 to 48.  At 0
tolerance,  only  colours  that are identical to the colour you click on
will be affected.  At 48 tolerance, all colours will be affected.

Remake
When  you  have  a stencil active and you apply colours to your picture,
the  colours you apply are not protected, even though they may be locked
in  the  Make  Stencil requester.  You can lock newly applied colours by
bringing  up  the  Make  Stencil  requester  and  clicking  Make,  or by
selecting Remake from the Stencil submenu.

If  you  have  several  animation  frames and you make a stencil, Deluxe
Paint  automatically  remakes the stencil as you move from one screen to
the next.

Paint
Keyboard Equivalent: Ctrl-s

Uses  your  current  built-in or custom brush to paint the area you want
sten  cilled.   The image under the stencil will be displayed in a "half
tone"  mode.    When  you've finished painting the stencil, choose Paint
again  to  exit this mode and activate the stencil.  Stencils you create
using  Stencil  Paint  are  "area  based".   Also, if you choose Make or
Remake  to  create  a  "colour  based"  stencil, your painted stencil is
discarded.                                                             

Reverse
Has  the  sanme  effect as clicking Invert in the Make Stencil requester
(see Make, above).

On/Off
Keyboard Equivalent: (below Esc).

Toggles the stencil on and off.  This maintains the stencil but turns it
off temporarily so you can paint on the protected colours.

Free
Creating  a  stencil  uses memory even though you may have it turned off
(see On/0ff above).  Free deletes the stencil and unallocates the memory
it was using.

Load
Stencils can be loaded as separate items.  They are full screen only and
can be loaded only to the position they occupied when they were created.
In  other  words,  you  cannot create a page larger than screen size and
load  the stencil into the middle of the page.  The Load requester works
like  all  other Load requesters in the program (see Load in the Picture
menu).                                                                 

When  you  load  (or save) a stencil, you are loading (or saving) only a
layer of data that indicates which pixels in your picture you can or can
not  paint  in.    You  are  not  loading  settings for the Make Stencil
requester.    In other words, stencils you load are area based, like the
sten  cils you create in the Stencil>Paint mode.  Area based stencils do
not  apply  across  animation  frames  and  are replaced by colour based
stencils you subsequently create using the Make Stencil requester.

Save
You  can  save stencils just as you can any other file, such as pictures
or  brushes.   The Save requester for stencils works like all other Save
requesters  in the program (see Save in the Picture menu).  See the note
above  regarding  the  nature of the data you are saving when you save a
stencil

LightTable >>

On/Off
Keyboard Equivalent: 1

Turns  the  LightTable  on  or  off.    The  LightTable lets you see the
animation  frames that immediately precede and/or immediately follow the
current frame (or the spare page), which gives you greater control while
creating  your  animation.    This  effect  simulates  the  "onion skin"
techniques  used  by  traditional  animation  artists.      By   using a
combination  of LightTable options, you can see a maximum of four frames
simultaneously.

The  lighttabled frames appear behind the current image (in the BG area)
and  can  be dimmed to a darker colour in all screen format modes except
HAM.

Merge 
Merges  all  of  the currently viewed images into the current frame, and
turns  off  the  LightTable  so  you  can  see the result as it actually
appears.                                                         

WARNING
You cannot UNDO this Merge command.

Dim
Keyboard Equivalent: Alt-1

When  Dim  is  On,  all  frames  displayed on the LightTable, except the
current  frame,  appear  dimmed.   You can easily see at a glance, which
frame you are working on.  Dim is on by default.  This option applies to
all screen format modes except HAM.

If you dim a frame that contains very dark colours, those colours may be
difficult to see.

Layer 1-4
Keyboard Equivalent: Ctrl-1 to Ctrl-4

Shows/hides the frames defined for each Layer in the LightTable Settings
requester (see below).  If a layer is checked, it is shown: if it is not
checked, it is hidden.

Settings
Displays the LightTable Settings requester.

Layer:  You  can  use these checkboxes to show/hide the four Layers just
like selecting the Layers directly from the Effect>LightTable menu.

Frame:  Define  the  frame associated with the Layer 0 = spare page, 1 =
next frame, -1 = previous frame, -2 = 2 frames back, etc.

Dim: Click this box to activate the current dim slider values.

<  >:  Click  the  left  and  right arrows (< >) to globally increase or
decrease the dim values for all four layers.  Each mouse click moves the
values  up  or down by 5 units.  Alt Click adjusts the values by 1O, and
Ctrl Click adjusts the values by 1.

Sliders:  The  sliders set the dim values for each Layer.  The dim value
(-255  to  255)  is  the  amount  of  black to add to the colours in the
selected  layer.    The  larger  the number, the darker the colours: the
smaller  the  number,  the lighter the colours.  Zero leaves the colours
unaltered.    Adding  a  negative  amount of black will make the colours
lighter (ie, add White).

Anim  Lock:  Click this checkbox to lock out any page that is not within
the current animation play range.  This will lock out the first frame of
an  anima  tion  if  a  layer  is set to show the next frame (1) and the
current  frame  is the last frame in the animation, or lock out the last
frame  of  a animation if a layer is set to show the previous frame (-1)
and the current frame is the first frame of the animation.

Background >>

Fix
Fixes  the background by "locking" the current picture.  This allows you
to  draw  on it without losing any of the background.  You can erase any
paint  you  apply  after  fixing  the  background  by clicking CLR or by
painting with the right mouse button.

Fixing  the  background  uses additional memory.  When the background is
fixed, no colours may be picked up from that background.

Free
This  "unlocks"  the  background,  and  merges it with anything that was
paint  ed  over  it, so that clicking CLR will clear the entire picture.
It also frees up the memory that was allocated to fixing the background.

LockFG
The  Make Stencil requester lets you create stencils based on colours in
the  palette.    By locking a colour, you make it impossible to paint on
that  colour  wherever it may be on the page.  By using a combination of
Fix  Background  (see  above)  and  Lock  FG,  however, you can define a
stencil by area rather than colour.  When you select Lock FG, you define
as  a stencil those areas on the page that you have painted since fixing
the background, regardless of the colour of those areas.

Anti-alias >>

Anti-aliasing  is  a  smoothing  process which eliminates or reduces the
jagged  edges  apparent  in  lines  that  aren't  precisely  vertical or
horizontal.    The  effec  tiveness of anti aliasing is dependent on the
range of colours in the palette.  For example, to draw a smooth, oblique
black  line  on a white background, you'll need to have two intermediate
shades  of  grey  in the palette.  Anti aliasing works with straight and
curved  lines,  and  with  filled and unfilled shapes.  It is especially
good  at smoothing the jagged lines in a brush that result from rotating
or shrinking it in Perspective mode.

None, High, Low
Keyboard Equivalent: Alt-/

Set  the level of anti aliasing used on your brush when you paint.  None
is  the  default  setting  and  applies  no anti aliasing.  Low lets you
eliminate  some  of  the jagged outline in your images and brushes.  The
cost  of removing jagged lines is painting speed, but it is still faster
than  smoothing  out  an  image  by  hand.  To use anti aliasing, select
either  Low  or High before you lay down the brush image.  Anti-aliasing
is  most effective when you have reduced the size of your original brush
(for example, by moving it back along the Z axis).  Anti aliasing in the
High setting can be very slow if your brush or fill area is large.

Process >>

The  effectiveness  of  the  Process options is dependent on the colours
availablc  in the palette.  Deluxe Paint combines your foreground colour
with  the  colour  in  your  image and then looks for the colour in your
palette  that  most  closely  matches  the  colour  it  needs.  For best
results,  your  palette  should  contain  a range of colours between the
colours  in  the  palette  and  the  colour  you are using to tint.  The
Process  option  obviously  give the best results in higher colour modes
because all Amiga colours are available for painting.

You can combine Translucency with any of the Process options to increase
your  control  over the effect of these options.  For example, Hue would
nor mally directly substitute the hue of your brush for the hues in your
picture  If  you  turn  on Translucency with a setting of 50% instead of
substituting  the  hue  directly,  the  resulting  hue  will  be a 50/50
combination of the brush hue and the picture hue.

On/Off
Keyboard Equivalent: Alt-p

When you choose Process On a P appears in the middle of the Title Bar

Tint (default setting)
The  colour  you  are painting with tints the colour(s) underneath it in
the  direction  of  the colour you are applying.  Use this option if you
want  to cre ate a shading or tinting effect over a number of colours on
the screen, or to colourise a black and white or greyscale image. 

Hue
Use  this  option with any painting tool to adjust the hue of a coloured
area  of  your  image.    This  option  is   useful   for   converting a
multi-coloured  image into a monochromatic image.  Note that this option
will  have  no  effect  on  greyscale  images  because  a colour with no
Saturation is grey regardless of its hue.

Value
Use this option to paint the Value of the current brush into the colours
in  the  image.  This is an effective way to create shading effects.  If
you  choose  a  light colour to paint with in Value mode, darker colours
you  paint on will become lighter.  If you choose a dark colour to paint
with, lighter colours will become darker.

Translucency >>

On/Off
Keyboard Equivalent: Alt-t

When you choose Translucency a T appears in the middle of the Title Bar.
Painting with Translucency on has the effect of laying a transparency or
coloured  filter  over  a  portion of your picture.  The transparency is
tinted  toward  the current foreground colour.  The degree of tinting is
determined  by  the level (percentage) set in the Translucency requester
(below).

Settings
Keyboard Equivalent:Ctrl-t

Displays the Translucency requester. The default setting is 50%.

To  change  the  setting click on either side of the slider, or drag the
slider  to a particular position.  Click OK to confirm your new setting.

Here's  an  example of how Translucency works.  Let's say you have a red
object  in  your  painting with the RGB values R: 15 (100%) G:0 B:0, and
that  blue  (R:0  G:0 B:15 (100%) is your foreground colour.  If you set
the  translucency  level  to  50%  and  painted over the red object, the
resulting  colour  would be equal to 50% of the objects colour, red, and
50%  of  the  foreground  colour,  blue.  The RGB value of the resulting
colour  is  R:7  (50%)  G:0  B:7.  If this colour (purple) is not in the
current palette, the clos est colour to this value will be used instead.
Like  the  Process functions, Translucency gives the best results in HAM
mode.

The  percentage  value  for  translucency  refers  to  the amount of the
original  object  that  will  show  through the newly applied foreground
colour.    For  instance, in the above example if the translucency level
was  set to 75%, the resulting colour would be 75% of the listing colour
in  the  painting, red, and 25% of the foreground colour, blue.  The RGB
value of the resulting colour would be R:11 G:0 B:3.

Translucency  works  with  all  the  painting tools (except text, single
pixel  Airbrush,  or  the  3-  and  5-pixel  built-in  brushes),  and in
combination  with  the  Process options.  By combining Translucency with
Tint for example, you can control the degree of tinting.

Perspective >>

The  Perspective  submenu  contains  options for manipulating a brush in
three dimensions.

Do
Keyboard Equivalent: Enter (on keypad)

Puts  you  into  Perspective  mode.  Your brush is represented by a four
cell matrix, which you can manipulate with keypad commands (listed later
in  this  section).  The amount of rotation for axes x, y and z is given
in  degrees  on  the  right  side  of  the  Title  bar.    The centre of
perspective  (see  Centre, below) is indicated by a cross hair.  You can
paint an image of the rotated brush at any time by clicking.

To  exit Perspective mode, click a tool in the toolbox or press Enter on
the keypad.

FillScreen
Keyboard Equivalent: - (minus) keypad

Fills  the  screen  with  the  current  brush,  in  its current state of
rotation in 3D.  The entire brush size (not just the opaque part) is the
default size for the Perspective Fill pattern.

Reset
Keyboard Equivalent: 0 on keypad

Resets  the brush to its original state before rotation, and returns all
of  the settings in the Perspective Settings requester to their defaults
(see Settings below).

Note: The keyboard equivalent does not reset the perspective centre This
is  useful  if  you need to reset your brush to its original orientation
without changing your perspective plane.

Centre
Keyboard Equivalent: . (period) keypad

Allows  you to set the Perspective centre or horizon in your perspective
"landscape".

When  you select Centre, your cursor changes into a large cross hair The
smaller  stationary  cross  hair  on  the  screen indicates the existing
centre.   Move the large cross hair to the new centre you want and click
either mouse button.

Once your have set the Perspective centre, the position of the unrotated
brush relative to that centre determines the position of the perspective
planes  when  you  rotate  the brush.  the greater the distance above or
below Perspective centre, the less pronounced the perspective effect.

Settings
Displays  the  Perspective  requester.  When you are in Perspective mode
you can also display this requester by right clicking the Grid tool.

The following options are available:

Grid
You  can  use these edit boxes to set the dimensions for a grid in three
dimen  sional  space.  When you first open the requester, the numbers in
these  boxes correspond to the dimensions of your brush: the Z dimension
automatically  takes the same value as the Y dimension.  It is important
to remember that the entire brush size (not just the opaque part) is the
default size for Perspective Grid and Perspective Fill.

From Brush
Clicking  From  Brush  sets the X and Y grid values to correspond to the
width  and height of the brush.  This is the quickest way to restore the
per  spective grid settings to the same dimensions as your brush without
affect ing any other settings.

Angle Step
Specifies  the rotation increment used in conjunction with the Shift key
and  the  appropriate  keyboard rotation key (see Perspective Rotations,
below).  This value defaults to 90 degrees.

Screen
The default setting, uses the screen coordinate system when rotating the
brush  on  the  x,  y, and z axes.  (If you are familiar with coordinate
systems, you will know this coordinate system as the Euler method, which
measures all three angles of rotation from absolute zero).

Brush
Rotates the brush relative to the current brush coordinate system.

Display
The  Angle and Pos buttons let you choose whether the angles of rotation
or the position of the brush in three dimensional space are displayed in
the Title Bar.

If  Coords  from  the  Prefs  menu is turned on, the Title Bar shows two
dimensional  coordinares; be sure to turn Coords off if you wan't to see
three dimensional coordinates.

Perspective Rotations
All  perspective rotations are controlled through the keypad on your key
board.

Pressing  Keypad  0  resets  all three axes to zero and fixes the Z axis
below),  but  retains the apparent distance settings.  Pressing Keypad 0
in  con junction with the Shift key resets all perspective values to the
default state

Other Perspective Keyboard Commands

Ctrl temporarily fixes the Y axis so that you can move the brush forward
or backward in 3D space by moving the mouse forward or backward.

The  ;  and  ' keys move the brush plane forward or back along its fixed
axis  (see  below)  without  changing  its  orientation,  moving it in a
direction  per  pendicular  to the brush plane.  This is the same effect
described  in the above discussion on brush position prior to rotation. 
Thus,  with  the Z axis fixed brush position relative to the Perspective
centre  at  the moment of rotation determines the brush's distance above
or  below eye level.  You can achieve the same effect after the brush is
rotated  by using the ; and ' keys to move it for ward or back along its
Z axis.

Up Arrow
Pressing  these  keys  with  the  shift  key held down results in larger
increments  of  movement.    In  addition  you  can  modify the apparent
distance  from  the  observer  by  pressing  the  < and > keys (ie.  the
Shifted  "," and "." keys) Thus when the apparent distance is great, the
perspective foreshortening is at a minimum, becoming greater as apparent
distance decreases.

Fixing Axes: Whenever you start in Perspective mode, the Z axis (the one
perpendicular  to  the  screen)  is "fixed," that is, the mouse does not
move  the brush through that axis.  You can selectively fix any axis, as
follows:

To fix the X axis, press Shift-9
To fix the Y axis, press Shift-6
To fix the Z axis, press Shift-3

As  noted  above, you can move along the axis that is currently fixed by
using  the  Shifted or un Shifted ; and ' keys (use the Shifted keys for
larger incre ments).  You can also temporarily fix the Y axis by holding
down the Ctrl key.

Pressure >>

On/Off
Deluxe  Paint  supports  pressure  sensitive  tablets.   (TriMedia, Inc.
software  dri ver required).  When painting on canvas with a traditional
brush,  your  strokes  vary  in colour intensity and width depending how
hard  you press the brush down.  Pressure sensitivity allows duplication
of  this  effect, as well as other effects not possible with traditional
media.

Settings
Keyboard Equivalent: Ctrl-p

Displays the Pressure requester and turns on pressure on exit.

Translucency:  When  this  option is on, your brush paints from the back
ground  colour  to  the foreground colour, so the order of light to dark
changes  depending  on the background colour.  For example, if your back
ground  colour is white and you're painting with a red foreground colour
your  brush  strokes  change  from  light  pink  to  red with increasing
pressure.    You  can  change  the  amount  of  translucency  with   the
Translucency  Settings  requester.  The higher the Translucency setting,
the wider the variety of shades available for pressure.

Cycle:  This option causes pressure to be translated into colour cycling
using  the current colour cycle range.  The colour cycle range must have
a cycle speed associated with it for this option to work.

Size:  When  this  box  is checked, the setting of the slider is used to
modify the brush size (in pixels) depending on how hard you press on the
tablet.

Reverse  Size: Invert the Size modification so that pressing harder will
reduce the brush size by the selected amount.

Pressing OK from the requester automatically turns Pressure on.

Media >>

Open
Use  a  standard  open  requester  to  open a Media Library file.  Media
Library  files  shipped  with Deluxe Paint (in the Media drawer) include
chalk, felt tip marker, oil pastel, crayon, and water-colour.

Media types and textures work together - in order to use a Media type, a
texture must also be turned on.  When both Media and Textures are turned
on,  you  can  duplicate natural drawing effects such as water-colour on
paper, oil on heavy canvas, etc.

The  use  of media and textures and their effects will vary depending on
which  colour  you  are  using  and  what  kind of effects you are using
Experiment  with  media types, translucency options, and colour modes to
get different effects.

Close
Close the currently open Media Library file.

Texture >>

On/Off
Keyboard Equivalent:Right Amiga-t

This  turns  the  current  background texture on or off.  If there is no
texture the Load Texture requester is displayed.

Load
Use  standard  ASL  requester  to  load  any  IFF  image as a background
texture.   For optimum effect, images should be tile-able and 16 colours
or  greater but different effects can be achieved with even simple black
and  white  or colour images.  Only bitmap data for the selected file is
read; any palette data associated with the file is ignored.

Invert
Keyboard Equivalent; Right-Amiga - I

Inverts the data of the Current background texture.

Free
Clear the current background texture from memory.

Macro Menu

The  Macro  menu is a new menu that lets you record, load, save, assign,
and  execute  Arexx  macros.  Macros enable you to save actions and then
repeat  them  -  you  can  even  assign macros to function keys for easy
access.

Record Macro
Keyboard Equivalent: Right - Amiga - M

When  this  check  item  is selected, Deluxe Paint begins recording menu
choices  and  mouse actions.  When selected again to stop recording, the
Assign  Macro  requester appears.  Select one of the ten slots and press
OK  to  assign the macro you've just recorded to a function key.  Macros
are kept in RAM:T until you save them.

Record Details

When this option is checked, all mouse drawing movements are recorded in
the  macro.   When unchecked, only necessary mouse drawing movements are
recorded.    For  instance,  when unchecked, only the two endpoints of a
straight  line  would be recorded.  If checked all the mouse movement in
between  the  two clicks to set the endpoints would be recorded, leading
to a more complex macro file.

Execute Macro

Opens  an  "Execute  Macro"  window  in  your  default  open ARexx macro
directory.    Choose  an  ARexx  macro file, and press OK to execute the
macro file immediately.

Load
Open  a requester to simultaneously open a macro file and assign it to a
function key

Click on the question mark next to a macro slot to bring up an open file
requester.    Select  a macro file and press OK to load the macro in the
macro slot.

Save As 
Opens  a  standard ASL "Save File" requester to save the macro currently
in memory to an ARexx file

Prefs Menu

The  Prefs menu contains a list of options that you can toggle on or off
to  suit  your  work  habits.    When you choose an option, a check mark
(tick) appears to the left of the option to indicate that its turned on.
Choosing the option again turns the option off and removes the tick.
 
You  can  toggle  multiple  options  by clicking on the option while the
Prefs menu is exposed. 

The  AutoGrid  is  turned on by default for all Deluxe Paint users.  For
artists  using  HAM  screen  format,  FastAdjust  is  also  turned on by
default. 

New  additions  to  the  menu allow you to save and restore your default
pref erences to and from disk. 

Coords
Keyboard Equivalent: Shift-\
 
This  option  turns  on  the  coordinate display in the upper right hand
portion  of the Title Bar.  Simply moving the mouse displays the current
position  of  the  cursor  with  the origin (0, 0) set to the lower left
corner of the screen Holding down either mouse button temporarily resets
the origin to the cur rent cursor position and displays the displacement
value  from  that  tempo rary origin as you move around the screen.  The
readout is scaled in pixels.  See also OriginUL, below. 

FastFB
Fast  feedback.   Turn on Fast FB when working with large or complicated
brushes  while using the line or unfilled shape tools.  Fast FB lets you
draw  your  lines  and  shapes  using the smallest (one-pixel) brush for
feedback  and  then  completes  the  design using the currently selected
brush.  This increase response speed while you are drawing, but does not
affect the final image

MultiCycle
Works  in  conjunction with the Cycle paint mode from the Mode menu With
MultiCycle  turned on, painting with a multicoloured brush in Cycle mode
cycles  each  colour  in in the brush, provided the colour is in a cycle
range.    When Multicycle is turned off (the default) using Cycle with a
multicoloured  brush  treats the brush as though it were a single colour
(the current foreground colour).

Be Square
Because the Amiga's pixels are not perfectly square, circles and squares
drawn  with  the  shape tools are not perfectly round or square.  If you
wish  to  draw  "true"  circles or squares, select Be Square.  This will
square  all  the  built  in  brushes,  the  appropriate shape tools, and
symmetry.  Be Square does not square gridding or perspective, and should
be turned off when you are using those features.

Workbench
Toggles the Amiga Workbench on and off. Default setting is off.

ExclBrush
If  you pick up a brush with ExelBrush (and the Grid) selected, you will
exclude  a  one-pixel border on the right and bottom edges of your brush
(see  Figure  30).    This is useful if your brush has a coloured border
around  it  and  you  want  to use the brush to create a pattern fill or
perspective  fill  (using  the  Fill Type requester).  When Deluxe Paint
creates  your  pattern, the border will be uniform throughout instead of
being  twice  as  wide  where  one  copy  of the brush is placed next to
another.

ExelBrush has no effect on brush pickup when the Grid is off.

AutoTransp
Modifies  the way brush pickup works.  With AutoTransp turned on, Deluxe
Paint determines the transparent colour by looking at the corners of the
capture  rectangle  or  the points of the polygon to see if they are the
same  colour.    If  the  four  corners are the same colour, that colour
becomes  the transparent colour, otherwise the current background colour
remains the transparent colour.

AutoGrid
With AutoGrid turned on the perspective grid is resized automatically to
match  any  custom  brush you choose to load or pick up.  lt's as if you
had  clicked  the From action button in the Perspective requester.  When
AutoGrid is off, the perspective grid is not automatically resized.

This option affects only the grid in Perspective, not the standard grid.

OriginUL
When Coords from the Prefs menu is on, Deluxe Paint displays the current
position  of  the cursor on the right side of the Title Bar.  By default
the  pro gram calculates the origin, or zero point of coordinates (0, 0)
of the cursor position from the lower left corner of the screen.  If you
would  rather  have  the  origin  calculated from the upper left, choose
OriginUL.  To return to the default origin, choose OriginUL again.

FastAdjust
This  option  is  available  only  in HAM mode, where it is turned on by
default.    FastAdjust  tells Deluxe Paint NOT to attempt to correct the
fringing  effects  that  appear along the right side of your brush while
the  brush  is moving.  This improves the speed of brush movement and is
especially  help ful if you are using large custom brushes.  If you find
the  fringing  to be annoying or difficult to work with, turn FastAdjust
off and the fringing will be reduced.

MouseTrack
This  check  option  is  available  only  on  Amigas with a 68020 CPU or
greater.    When mouse track is on, Deluxe Paint buffers your mouse move
ments during freehand drawings so that your lines look smoother.

Appendix A: Memory Management
-----------------------------

The amount of memory available varies from machine to machine depend ing
on the machine model, amount of RAM installed, version of the operat ing
system,  the  screen mode and colour depth you're working in, floppy dri
ves  connected,  ARexx,  and  tablet support.  You can measure available
memo ry by selecting About from the Picture menu (or by pressing Ctrl-a)
any  time  you need a memory check.  Deluxe Paint will warn you when you
have  insufficient memory to accomplish a task, or when you run the risk
of los- ing data.

Memory  shortage is manifested in various ways.  For example, if you are
at  the  limits of available memory and you select a large brush, Deluxe
Paint  conserves  memory  by  displaying  just the outline of the brush.
When you paint with the brush the image will appear on the screen in the
normal fash ion, even though in may not be visible as you move the brush
around  the screen.  When this happens and your brush is not larger than
the screen and the Brush Frame Only option is not checked, consider it a
sign  that avail able memory is low.  In that case, you should take some
action  to reallocate memory (for example, by deleting the spare page or
by  removing any sten cils, see below), or at least to save your current
image or animation to disk.

Here are some of the ways Deluxe Paint V consumes memory:

Increasing  the  amount of change in an animation after you've allocated
frames for animation (see below for further discussion).

Creating  and  holding  a large brush.  When you see just the outline of
the  brush  (and  your brush is not larger than the screen and the Brush
Frame  Only  option is not checked) this is a sign that you are near the
edge of yoyr memory limits.

Creating and holding a large AnimBrush.

When  your  spare page is active, it uses up as much memory as the first
page  even  if you cleared the image from it.  You can regain the memory
used  by  the  spare  page  (40K or more) by selecting Delete This Page,
while viewing the spare page, from the Picture menu.

You  use  memory  by  leaving  the  WorkBench open while you work Deluxe
Paint.   The WorkBench can be opened and closed through the Prefs menu. 
The  Workbench  can  only be closed if there are no other custom screens
open.

Creating  a  stencil  uses up one bit plane.  The exact amount of memory
used depends on the screen format and page size you've selected.  Fixing
the background has a much larger overhead, similar to that required by a
spare page.

AnimBoard  printing  requires  slightly  more  memory than the currently
displayed page for printing.

Multiple  Palettes  can  use as little as .25K per Palette (in black and
white modes) to a little over 1K per Palette in 256 colour modes.

The  Standard airbrush uses a little more memory than 1 bitplane for the
screen mode you are currently using.

Other  things that require memory are loading the disk directory loading
the system fonts, and creating a fill pattern from a brush.

Animation and Memory Management

You've probably discovered that animation requires a lot of memory.  And
the  two  animation  methods,  Expanded  and  Compressed, have different
memory requirements.

The Expanded method of animation requires that there be enough memory to
duplicate  the  entire screen for every frame.  So if you are in 320x200
32  colours,  which  takes  40K  per  screen, you'll need 800K to get 20
frames.

Memory requirements for animation in the Compressed mode is based on the
difference  between each animation frame.  The more a frame is different
from  the  one  before it, the more memory will be needed to store it in
mem  ory and on the disk.  The frame that requires the minimum amount of
memory  is  simply a copy of the frame before it.  The maximum amount of
memory  is  required  when  every pixel in a frame is a different colour
than in the frame before it.

It's possible to set the number of frames to a large number and then, in
the course of painting on the different frame:, run out of memory.  What
is  hap  pening  is  that  you are increasing the amount that the frames
differ  from  each  other.   When this happens you'll see a message that
explains  that  you  don't  have enough memory to save the change you're
making.

What If You Run Out of Memory

Eventually  everyone  gets  in  a situation when they run out of memory.
The  first  thing you should do when you get messages saying "Not enough
mem  ory"  is  to save your work.  The following is a list of things you
can do to get a little more memory to finish your work.

Close the WorkBench from the Prefs Menu.

Delete your Spare page.

Delete your custom brush by choosing Brush>Free from the Brush menu.

If  you  have  an  AnimBrush, choose AnimBrush>Free option from the Anim
menu to free it.

If  you have a stencil, choose Stencil>Free from the Effect menu to free
it.

If you have an animation, delete some frames.

If you have an open Media library close it.

If you have a texture in memory free it.

Reduce your page size if it is larger than the screen.

Work  with  the  minimum  number  of colours that you can to achieve the
effect that you want.  Choose the screen format you are working with and
reduce the number of colours.

If  you receive the System Message "Not enough memory for requested page
size"  when  you try to change the Deluxe Paint V screen format from one
to  another you may be experiencing memory fragmentation.  To solve this
problem, either reset screen format from the Screen Format option in the
Picture  menu,  or  quit the program and restart Deluxe Paint V fresh in
the mode you wanted.

Appendix C: The Player Utility
------------------------------

The  Deluxe  Player  utility  on  the  program  disk  lets  you play the
animations  you  have  created  with  Deluxe  Paint V.  You can boot the
utility  from the Workbench or use CLI arguments to start Deluxe Player.
This version of Deluxe Player will display any ILBM or op5/op8 Anim from
hard disk or memory.  It supports AGA multiple palettes, colour cycling,
pictures, AnimBrushes, ARexx and several new options.

From the Workbench, open the Program disk and double click on the Deluxe
Player  icon.    This loads the program in the default screen format (lo
res, 320 x 200, with 32 colours) and displays an Open File requester.

From the Open File requester specify which drive you want to make active
and  then  load  a  picture  or anim from the directory of the drive you
choose.

To play choose a play mode from the Play menu.

The  Deluxe  Player Menu Bar does not display automatically.  To see the
utili  ty's  menu, move the pointer to the upper left part of the screen
and press the right mouse button.  Project, Play and Prefs appear in the
Menu Bar.

Menus
The Deluxe Player menus are described below.

s changes display to indicate an average frame rate.

Show Loading
Keyboard Equivalent: Right Amiga-B

Displays frames as they are loaded

Set Rate
Keyboard Equivalent Right Amiga-R

Opens  a  requester that lets you set speed in frames per second to play
the  current  animation.    The  default  setting  uses  the setting the
animation  was  saved with.  Vary by frame plays the animation using its
variable rate per frame info.

Using Deluxe Player from CLI or the Shell

Deluxe  Player  can  be run from the CLI or Shell, open the CLI or Shell
from  the  Woekbench.    On  the command line type cd dpaintv: and press
Return.

This  will  change the current directory to the drawer or disk where the
Deluxe Player utility is located.  At the next prompt, type dplayer (add
a  space)  and the complete path and filename of the picture or anim you
want  to  load.  For example, if you wanted to load the animation called
"walk.anim"  from  Deluxe Paint's Anim drawer, you would type the follow
ing:

dplayer File dpaintv:gallery/walk.anim <enter>

NOTE
For clarity, commands in these examples are capitalized, but that is not
nec essary.  Deluxe Player commands are not case sensitive.

If  you want to show the anim for a certain number of seconds, press the
space bar and type that number after the filename.  For example, to play
the anim "walk" for five seconds type:
 
dplayer File dpaintv:gallery/walk.anim Time 5
<enter>

If you would like to indicate that the number is a loop count instead of
time  in  seconds,  press the space bar and type the number of loops you
want to run.  Press the space bar again and type loops.  For example, to
play five loops of "Walk" type:

dplayer File dpaintv:anim/walk.anim Loop 5 
<enter>

You're now ready to issue player commands for your animation (or you can
press Return right now and your animation will play and take you back to
the CLI when it's finished).

You can also issue commands to Deluxe Player from a script file.  Script
files  are  ASCII  text  files  from  which commands are read.  They are
created  with a text editor such as ED or EMACS included with Workbench.


To  instruct  the  Deluxe  Player utility to read commands from a script
file (we'll call the filename TEST) type:

dplayer Script File TEST

A  sample  script  where  files are stored in a drawer called work would
look like this:

File DH1:work/File1.anim Playdisk
File DH1:work/File2.anim Loop 2
File DH1:work/pictureFile Time 5

Play Commands from CLI or Shell

Here are some sample commands and their meanings.

Command                             Meaning
dplayer                             Load Deluxe Player
dplayer File (path & filename)      Open and/or play file
dplayer (path & filename) Time 10   Open and/or play file for 10 seconds
                                    and exit back to CLI or Shell
dplayer (path & filename) Loop 20   Open and play file for 20 Loops and
                                    exit back to CLI or Shell
dplayer Script TEST                 Read commands from script file
                                    "test"

The  following  command switches will preset the corresponding option in
Deluxe Player.  Some of these options are only available via the command
line. 

pd=PlayDisk/S, pf=PlayFast/S, sm=SmallMem/S, ac=AutoCycle/S,s,

A command line starting with a semicolon (:) is ignored

ARexx Support

For general information about ARexx, refer to Appendix F

Notice:  ARexx  is  an advanced programming language than can be used to
write  macro scripts.  Scripting is only recommended for expert computer
users.    The  ARexx command set and examples listed in this section are
spe  cific only to Deluxe Player operations, and are intended for use by
those  experienced  in  ARexx scripting.  Electronic Arts does not offer
technical  customer  support  for  ARexx  scripting  issues.    For more
information  please  consult  the  ARexx  portion   of   your   system's
documentation (Amiga DOS 2.04 or greater).

The ARexx port is named 'Deluxe Player 1'.

Appendix D: Amiga display Modes
-------------------------------

Deluxe  Paint V supports all of the built-in Amiga graphic display modes
low  resolution, high resolution, extra-Halfbrite, and hold and modify. 
You  don't need to know much about the different display modes to create
great  art  with  Deluxe  Paint  V.    But some understanding of how the
display  modes  work,  and  in  particular how they affect the number of
colours available in the palette, can help you work more effectively.

This  appendix  explains  how  a  pixel  derives  its colour and how the
display  mode  and  the  number  of  bit  planes determine the number of
colours  avail  able  in  the  palette.    We've  tried  to avoid overly
technical  explanations,  but  the material is still very technical.  If
you  don't  understand  everything  you read here, don't be discouraged,
just remember that you don't really need to know this.

What Is a Bit Plane

A  bit plane can be thought of as a flat grid of dots - a plane of dots,
where each dot represents a bit.  So when we say "bit" think dot.

If  you look ahead to Figure D-1, you'll see that we drew the bit planes
as  flat  surfaces.   The best way to think of this surface is as a flat
grid  behind  your  computer screen.  (This isn't actually how it works,
but  it may help you visualise how the colours are assigned to pixels). 
The grid is the same dimensions as your screen resolution.  For example,
if  your  screen is 320 pix els wide and 200 pixels high, each bit plane
is also 320 x 200 bits.

Bit Planes and Available Colours

Now  imagine  that each dot is either filled in or it's not.  If the dot
is  filled in, it has a value of 1 and is said to be "on".  If it is not
filled  in,  the  dot  has a value of 0 and is said to be "off".  In the
simplest case of a display mode with only one bit plane, the picture can
have  only  two colours.  A pixel is one colour if its corresponding bit
is on or a different colour if the bit is off

The  bit planes themselves don't determine the colour of the pixel, they
sim  ply  determine  which  colour  register  the pixel looks to for its
colour.  With a single bit plane, the pixel points to either Colour 0 or
Colour  1.  If you add another bit plane behind the first, the number of
possible  colour  registers  doubles to four.  Each additional bit plane
doubles  the  number of colours again.  The colour register contains the
numbers for the amount of red, green, and blue in the colour.

Low rsolution and High Resolution Display Modes

Figure  D-1  illustrates  how  the  bit  planes  determine  which colour
register  a  pixel  points  to  in  Low Resolution display with five bit
planes.    Take  a  look at this figure for a moment.  Notice that we've
numbered  the  bit  planes  0 through 4.  Notice also that the number of
each  bit  plane corresponds to the power of two by which each bit plane
value is multiplied.  For example, the dot in bit plane 3 has a value of
1,  and  because  it  is in bit plane 3, the 1 is multiplied by 2 to the
power  of  3 which equals 8 (2 x 2 x 2).  The numbers from the five bits
are  then added together to obtain the number of the colour register the
pixel points to.

Low and High Resolutions work exactly alike, except that High resolution
does  not  support  as  many  bit  planes,  and therefore provides fewer
colours.    Figure  D-2  lists  the graphics modes and the number of bit
planes and colours each supports.  Notice that Hold And Modify mode is a
departure  from  the  notion  that each additional bit plane doubles the
number  of  colours  available.   Hold and Modify is a special case that
we'll explain in a moment.

Extra-Halfbrite Display Mode

Extra Halfbrite uses a trick to increase the number of colours available
on the screen.  The Amiga supports only 32 colour registers directly but
Extra  Halfbrite  uses  a  sixth  bit plane to indicate an additional 32
registers  that don't really exist.  The first 32 registers are standard
colour registers; the sec ond 32 are Halfbrite equivalents.  Pixels that
use  Halfbrite colours point to one of the standard colour registers and
indicate  that  the  colour  should  be  displayed  at  half  its normal
intensity.   This means that the second 32 pixels are not independent of
the  first  32;  you  can  change the colour values only in the first 32
registers,  and  the  change is automatically reflected in the Halfbrite
equivalent.    Figure  D-3 shows how Extra Halfbrite uses the bit planes
and colour registers.

Not  all  Amiga 1000 computers support Extra-Halfbrite.  The easiest way
to  find  out whether or not your computer supports this display mode is
to try it.  Open an Extra-Halfbrite screen and look at the Palette (make
sure  the  pointer  is  not in the Menu Bar or Toolbox).  If the last 32
colours  are  the  same  as  the first 32, your computer doesn't support
Extra-Halfbrite.

Hold and modify Display Mode

Hold  and Modify display mode uses only 16 colour registers, but manages
to  display  all  4,096  colours  on  the  screen  at the same time.  To
accomplish  this,  HAM  display  mode  uses the first four bit planes to
address  the 16 colour registers, and uses the fifth and sixth bit plane
to determine whether the register colour or a HAM colour should be used.

A HAM colour is formed by taking the RGB value of the preceding pixel on
the screen, and substituting a new value for one of the RGB compo nents.
The new value is the number derived from the first four bit planes.

Here's a quick example;

Assume  the  colour values of one pixel (a register colour) are R3, G15,
B11.    The  following pixel (a HAM colour) would have the colour values
R13,  G15, B11, if bit planes 0 through 3 pointed to register 13 and bit
planes  4  and  5  indicated  that  the register value should be used to
modify the red component of the preceding colour.  (Figure D-4 shows how
the six bit planes are used to select a colour in Hold and Modify mode).


Because  HAM  colours are based on colour values of the preceding pixel,
and  only one colour value can be changed at one time, it may take three
pixels  to  reach  the colour you really wanted.  In Figure D-5 it takes
three  pixels  to  change  black  (R0, G0, B0) to white (R15, G15, B15).
Note that this exam ple assumes there are no intermediate colours in the
normal  colour registers This gradual change from one colour to the next
is  sometimes  referred  to  as "ramping" the colour, and appears on the
screen  to  the  left  of  HAM pixels.  If you need fine details in your
picture,  you  will  want  to  use  a  colour from the colour registers,
because those colours do not require ramping.

In  Deluxe  Paint  V  if  you  hold  a brush over an area made up of HAM
pixels,  you  may see an effect called "fringing".  The fringing appears
as  streaks  run  ning  to  the  right from the edge of the brush.  This
effect  is  only  temporary.  When you paint the brush onto the picture,
Deluxe  Paint  corrects  the  fring  ing,  but you may see the "ramping"
effect  where Deluxe Paint recreates the HAM colour to the right of your
brush.


Appendix E: The 24-Bit Backing Store

This  appendix  describes the operation of Deluxe Paint's 24-bit Backing
Store function.

Overview
When the 24-bit Backing Store choice is selected (from the screen format
requester), Deluxe Paint will keep track of the RGB data associated with
each  colour in your picture, animation, custom brush or animbrush, inde
pendent  of  the screen mode you've selected.  This means you can select
any  screen  mode  and any screen depth/number of colours that best fits
your  needs and your available memory.  The program will approximate the
RGB  inforrmation  on  screen  using the colours available to the screen
mode  select  ed the more colours available to the screen mode, the more
accurate the RGB approximation will be.

To  determine  the  number  of colours available for a particular screen
mode,  bring  up the screen format requester click on the desired screen
mode and (screen) palette size, then look at the "Max Colours" attribute
in the "Display Information" area of the screen format requester.

The  Amiga  Hold  and Modify (HAM) screen modes are RGB based modes that
offer  the  widest  range of available colours on the Amiga display hard
ware to date.  In HAM screen modes, the program will convert from 24-bit
RGB to 6 or 8 bit HAM with a slight loss of the RGB accuracy.

In non-HAM screen modes, the program will convert each RGB colour to the
closest  primary  or  secondary  colour  in  the screen palette using an
ordered dither, or chequered-box pattern.

Palette Handling

When using the RGB Backing Store, it is important to distinguish between
the  screen  palette  and  the  user palette.  The screen palette is the
palette  the  program  will  use to approximate RGB data on screen.  The
user  palette  is  the  palette or "colour set" that you, the user, have
complete  control  over.   The user palette is basically a repository of
colours  that  you  will use while painting.  All of the commands listed
under  the  "Colour  Set"  or  "Palette"  submenus  in the "Colour" menu
directly apply to the user palette.

Since  user  palettes are easy to load and save, Deluxe Paint only keeps
track  of  one user palette.  This one user palette is in effect for the
main page.  All ani mation frames, and the spare page.  When you wish to
work/paint  with  a different set of colours, simply load the new set of
colours  into  your  user  palette  and  begin work.  Modifying the user
palette will not change the underlying RGB image in any way.

It  is  important  to remember that the colours displayed in the toolbox
area are only a screen approximation of the colours in the user palette.
To  get a more accurate representation of the user palette, bring up one
of  the colour panels: the mixer, the arrange palett panel, or the range
definition  panel.    The  colours  displayed on these colour panels are
probably  the  best approxi mation possible, on standard Amiga hardware,
to the colours you've defined in your colourset.

The Recompute Option

As you paint with colours in the user palette, the colours in the screen
palette  may  become  inappropriate to accurately represent the range of
colours in your image.  For example, if you select a 320x200 screen mode
with  32  colour  registers,  the  program  will set up a default screen
palette  with a variety of reds, blues, yellows, and grey.  If the image
you're painting contains mostly yellows and oranges, the default palette
may  not  contain enough of the colours you're using and too many of the
colours that you're not using.

When  you  select  "Recompute"  from the "Colour" menu, the program will
analyse  your  image, compute the best screen palette for your image and
the   current   screen   mode,   then   refresh   the   entire   display
re-approximating  your  RGB  data  using  the  new screen palette.  Once
again, it is important to remember that modifying/recomputing the screen
palette does not alter the underlying RGB image in any way.

Multiple Screen Palettes

Since  recomputing  screen  palettes  can  take a considerable amount of
time,  Deluxe  Paint  will keep track of multiple screen palettes.  When
you  create  a  spare  page,  the  program will keep track of the screen
colours  used  for  the spare independent of the screen colours used for
the  main  page  or  anima  tion  frames.  If you select the "Recompute"
option  from  the  "Colour"  menu while viewing the spare page, only the
screen palette for the spare will be recomputed.

When  creating  an RGB animation, the Set Frame palette option under the
Anim>Frame  submenu  allows  you  to  create  or attach different screen
palettes to selected animation frames.  By default, Deluxe Paint creates
one  screen  palette  for  an entire animation.  Whenever you select the
"Make  Palette"  option  in the Set Frame Palette requester Deluxe Paint
will  create  a new screen palette filled with the current set of screen
colours  and  attach  it  to  the  current animation frame.  If you then
select  Recompute  from  the  Colour  menu  while  viewing  the  current
animation  frame,  the  program will compute the best screen palette for
the  current frame then refresh the screen using the new screen palette.


Loading Pictures

When  you load any picture into Deluxe Paint while using the RGB Backing
Store,  the  program will convert the image into RGB data and, if you're
not  loading  the  picture  into  an   animation,   the   program   will
automatically com pute the best screen palette for your image.

When  loading  a  picture  into your current RGB animation, Deluxe Paint
will  convert  the picture to RGB and approximate the RGB data using the
screen palette associated with the current frame.  If you want to better
approximate the RGB data on a particular animation frame, make sure that
the  anima  tion frame has its own screen palette, then select Recompute
Colour menu.

Colour Fonts

This  is  a little tricky.  ColourFonts are non-HAM, non-RGB fonts using
up  to  32  colours.  When you use a ColourFont, with or without the RGB
Backing  Store, the program will ask you if you want to 'use this font's
palette?.  If you select "yes", the program will load the font's colours
into  the  first  32 entries of the user palette.  When you're not using
the  RGB Backing Store, loading the font's colours into the user palette
will change the screen palette; when you are using the RGB Backing Store
loading the font's colours will not change the screen palette.  When you
type using the selected ColourFont and an RGB Backing Store, the program
will use the first 32 colours in the user's palette to render the colour
font.   If you load a different palette or you say "no" to the 'use this
font's palette?' requester, the program will ignore the font palette and
use the palette you have defined instead.

For example;

1. Select the 320x200 32-colour screen mode with a 24-bit Backing Store

2. Set your font directory to the Karafonts directory.

3. Bring up the font requester and select "Chiselscript" 58.

4. Say "Yes" to use the Chiselscript palette.

5. Place the text cursor down somewhere and type something.

6.    Select Recompute from the Colour menu so you can see what the text
colours really look like.

7. Bring up the font requester and select "'KaraGRANITE" is.

KaraGRANITE requires that you have Caps Lock on.

8.   Say "No" so Deluxe Paint will not load the KaraGRANITE palette into
your colourset.

9.  Place the text cursor down somewhere and type something; now you are
typing  with the KaraGRANITE, font using the Chiselscript colours If you
select  Recompute  from  the Colour menu you shouldn't see too much of a
difference.

10. Bring up the font requester and select "KaraGRANITE" is again.

11. This time say "Yes" to use the KaraGRANITE palette.

12.   Type something else and select Recompute from the Colour menu; you
should see a significant difference.

Memory Management

The  24-RGB  Backing Store consumes a lot of memory.  For this reason we
do not recommend using the RGB Backing Store on a machine with less than
4 MB of available fast memory.

For  each colour on the page, the program will use approximately 5 bytes
of  memory.   If your page size 320x200, the program will allocate 320 *
200  * 4 bytes = 250K for the colour information on the main page alone.
The  pro gram will allocate an additional 320 * 200 * 4 bytes = 250K for
its  undo  area.  It is important to remember that your page size may be
different  than  your  screen size; if your page size is larger than the
screen, Deluxe Paint will be allocating RGB data for the larger area.

Deluxe  Paint  will  always try to allocate RGB data in fast or extended
memo  ry  instead  of chip memory whenever possible.  This allows Deluxe
Paint  to  conserve  precious chip memory for the screen and other Amiga
specific  needs  and  to take full advantage of the performance benefits
when  using  the processor to manipulate RGB colour information.  Deluxe
Paint  will  also  try  to allocate memory in large contiguous blocks to
reduce the amount of memory fragmentation whenever possible.  If you are
running low on con tiguous memory Deluxe Paint will try to break the RGB
data up into strips.

If  you're running on a system with lots of available chip memory Deluxe
Paint  will try to allocate a "screen representation" for its undo area.
This screen representation will increase overall performance for the RGB
Backing  Store by allowing Deluxe Paint to simply copy the data from the
"screen  representation"  to  the main page whenever it needs to refresh
the  screen  or perform an UNDO.  If the screen representation could not
be  allo cated, Deluxe Paint will recompute the screen data from the RGB
data whenever it is needed.

When  you create a spare page, Deluxe Paint will allocate and keep track
of only the RGB data for the spare page.  If necessary Deluxe Paint will
reallo cate the undo area.  Since the program only keeps one copy of its
undo  area,  the  screen representation of the undo area will have to be
recomputed each time you swap between the main and spare pages.

When  you  create an animation, Deluxe Paint keeps track of both the RGB
data  and  the screen data for each animation frame.  This allows Deluxe
Paint to play the screen representation of your animation without having
to  do  any  colour  computations.    When  you create a custom brush or
animbrush,  Deluxe  Paint only keeps track of the RGB data.  The program
does  not  keep  track  of  the  screen  data for the brush or animbrush
because  the  actual screen data depends on where the brush or animbrush
is displayed/painted

Printing

Deluxe  Paint  makes  extensive  use  of  Commodore's  printer  device. 
Unfortunately  this  means  that  Deluxe  Paint  currently has no way to
output  24 bit data directly to the printer.  Instead, Deluxe Paint will
print  the  screen  reptesentation  of  your  picture or anim.  For best
results, try printing your RGB image when using a HAM screen mode.

Performance Troubleshooting

If  you're having performance problems when using the RGB Backing Store,
please watch for the following:

Are you running very low on memory?  Perhaps there was not enough memory
to  allocate the closest Deluxe Paint colour tables, so dithering to the
screen might be very slow.

Are  you running low chip memory?  If so, Deluxe Paint may not have been
able  to  allocate  a  screen  representation for the undo area and this
means  that  every  time  you  scroll your page or toggle the toolbox or
title  bar  or  bring up a requester Deluxe Paint will have to recompute
the screen representation of your image, dithering if necessary.

Is your memory very fragmented?  If so, Deluxe Paint may have split your
image  up  into  many  strips.    Adding  more  memory   or reducing the
fragmentation (after a reboot) may help.


Appendix F: ARexx Reference
---------------------------

What is ARexx?

ARexx  is  a  programming language designed to allow you to flexibly cus
tomise  your  working  environment.  ARexx acts as a central hub through
which  applications  may  send  data  and  commands to each other.  This
allows software created by different companies to interact, and in turn,
allows  the  user  to  create   custom   applications   by   integrating
off-the-shelf  software  prod  ucts.    For  example,  with  ARexx it is
possible  to  bring  in  a  file  to  Deluxe Paint, perform an automated
operation, and return the modified file to its original application with
the execution of an ARexx script.

ARexx is useful for writing small batch-style programs (called macros or
scripts)  that  allow  the automation of repetitive tasks.  Deluxe Paint
allows  beginning  users to create macros by recording the menu choices,
mouse  clicks,  and  toolbox  choices they make, and allows them to save
those  record  ed  movements  and  menu  choices as macros (simple ARexx
scripts that can be edited by knowledgeable ARexx programmers).  You can
automate  a  process like drawing your signature so that you can save it
out as a macro and use it automatically with all of your images. 

Who is ARexx for?

We've  tried  to  make Deluxe Paint's implementation of ARexx useful for
everyone  -  Deluxe  Paint  permits  the   recording   of   mouse/screen
interactions,  menu choices, and toolbox choices, so simple Deluxe Paint
actions  can  be saved as macros.  Nonetheless, keep in mind that custom
ARexx  script  cre  ation  is  for  the  advanced  user  who  has become
well-acquainted  with  the Amiga and with the ARexx programming language
in  general.    A basic understanding of both the Workbench and AmigaDOS
will aid in under standing how ARexx works and how it can be put to use.


ARexx  is  used  to customise the manner in which Deluxe Paint interacts
with other applications and the Amiga's working environment.  You should
be thoroughly familiar with that environment before attempting to tailor
it  to suit your needs.  Using ARexx programs and scripts do not require
previous  Amiga  experience,  but  a  working  knowledge  of the Amiga's
operation  will  permit  you  to  change the scripts to suit your needs.
There  are  many  books and references for ARexx scripting on the Amiga.
Please  consult  with your local user group, dealer, on line service, or
computer bookstore for more information.

Notice about Deluxe Paint ARexx Script Programming

ARexx  is  an  advanced  programming  language that can be used to write
macro  scripts.  Scripting is only recommended for expert computer users
The  ARexx  command set and examples listed in this section are specific
only  to  Deluxe  Paint  operations,  and  are intended for use by those
experi enced in ARexx scripting.

NOTE:
Electronic  Arts  does  not  offer  technical customer support for ARexx
scripting issues.  For more information please consult the ARexx portion
of your sys tem documentation (Amiga DOS 2.04 or greater).

Script Writing

You  cannot  write  actual  ARexx  scripts  from within Deluxe Paint.  A
primitive  command  console  called DPrx.rexx is included, and from DPRX
you  can  execute a script or a 1 line ARexx command like you would with
the Amiga DOS Shell.

To  write  scripts,  use  your favourite text editor to enter the actual
script  text  that  you are programming.  All scripts must be saved with
the  ".dprx"  file  name  extension  in the assigned Macrodir: drawer of
Deluxe  Paint.    Scripts  can  be  assigned  to the User menu using the
Load...   option from the Macro menu in Deluxe Paint.  See the Tooltypes
section  of  the  Reference  section  for more information on setting up
ARexx scripts to automatically load into Deluxe Paint.

DeluxePaint's port nanme is DPaint.#, where the # is the order of Deluxe
Paint's  running.    For  example, if you have two Deluxe Paints running
concurrently  the  first  one  launched will be called DPaint.1, and the
second  one  Dpaint.2,  and  so  forth.   Port names are how you address
information  from  one  application  to  the  other.   Think of it as an
application's mailbox.

The  following  is  a  simple  ARexx script (as viewed in a text editor)
which sets the number of frames of the current page to 30:

/* Sample DPaint ARexx Macro Script * /

Address "DPAINT.1"
LOCKGUI
SETFRAMES NUMBER 30
UNLOCKGUI

/* End Script */

How to Use this Section

This  ARexx  appendix is set up like the Referenee section of the manual
Toolbox  commands  are listed first, followed by menu item commands, per
spective commands, and user feedback commands.  For an alphabetical list
ing  of  the  commands available please check under the ARexx heading in
the  index.  For additional information on how a certain tool or feature
works in the software itself please consult the Reference section or the
tutorials.

ARexx conventions

This  section introduces general guidelines and hints on how ARexx works
within Deluxe Paint.

Here  are  some  of the common parameters used in this section.  We have
attempted to keep them in line with Amiga DOS and ARexx standards.

/s = switch keyword
/a = argument always required for command to work.
/k = keyword required for the command parameter to work
/n = number
/t = toggle keyword

X,Y  coordinates  in Deluxe Paint are always using a system starting 0,0
at the upper left corner of the screen.  If you want the programs visual
coordinates  to  match  your  script  coordinates,  make  sure  you have
OriginUL checked on in the Prefs menu.
 
Because  DPRX  is  a very basic command console, it converts all text to
uppercase.  Therefore, any saved filename or string issued from the DPRX
shell will be in uppercase.

ARexx  requires a double set of quotes when issuing strings that contain
spaces.  For example: SAVEBRUSH FILE "Ram:My Brush".
 
Variables and negative numbers must be enclosed in parenthesis.
 
Strings and load/save paths must be enclosed in quotation marks.
 
Whether  or  not  the  menu  bar is on affects drawing commands that are
dependent  on  coordinate  areas,  and also affects how you use the UNDO
command.

Animation  playback commands require that the GUI is unlocked before the
commands are issued.

Using more than one switch in your command can have varying results.  As
a  rule  of thumb, you can use these commands as you would use them from
within  the  program.   If you try to use a combination that the program
does not perform, the command will usually default to the last parameter
given.    Consult  the Reference section if you are unsure how a feature
works.

File  I/O  commands.    All Load/Save commands can take file patterns or
directories  in  place  of  the  FILE  parameter.    In  this  case, the
appropriate  requester  will  come  up  with  the  directory and pattern
pre-loaded (directories must end in "/").

Commands for Scripts or Command Line use.


No Operation performed

Format: NOP
Function: Performs no operation.

Command Help

Format: HELP Command/ A
Function: Returns the command structure for the keyword "COMMAND"
Example:  Typing "Help Brush" at the command line would result in: BRUSH
LEFT/N, TOP/N, WIDTH/N, HEIGHT/N, CUT/S, RESTORE/S.


Screen to Front or Back

Format: SCREENTOFRONT
Function: Brings the currently addressed Deluxe Paint Screen to the front. 

Format: SCREENTOBACK
Function: Moves the currently addressed Deluxe Paint Screen to the back


Version Checking

Format: VERSION
Function: Returns the internal version number of the currently addressed
Deluxe Paint V.


ToolBox Items

NOTE:  It's  generally a good idea to turn off the menu bar toolbar, and
any other panel while drawing commands are issued, as the panels or bars
may interfere with the drawing and use of the UNDO command.


Built-in Brushes

Format: SETPEN PENNUM/N
Function:  Sets  the  current  brush  to  one  of the toolbox's built in
brushes.   Accepts val ues from 0 (single pixel brush) to 9 (5 dot pixel
brush).
Example:  The command "SETPEN 3" will set the current pen to the largest
circular brush in the toolbox.

Format: SETPENSIZE SIZE/N
Function: Sets the size of the current built in brush.  Different screen
modes will have different maximums.  In lower resolutious the maximum is
approximately  100  pixels  across,  in   higher   resolutions   it   is
approximately 200 pixels across.


Dotted Freehand Drawing

Format: DOTTED
Function: Sets the current draw tool to dotted freehand


Freehand and Filled Freehand Draw Tool

Format: FREEHAND FILL/S,OUTLINE/S
Function:  Sets  the  current  draw tool to Freehand draw.  The optional
switches  set  the tool to its special modes.  Uses the current brush to
draw the Line

FILL 
Switches  Freehand  draw  to Filled Freehand Draw which uses the current
Fill Settings as its default fill.

OUTLINE 
Switches  Freehand  draw  to  Filled  Freehand Draw and uses the current
brush  to  outline the drawn shape.  This switch is the same as the user
using  the 'i' key in the Deluxe Paint interface to outline their filled
shape  with  their  cur  rent brush.  See the Reference section for more
information.


Line Draw Tool

Format: LINE X1/N,Y1/N,X2/N,Y2/N
Function:  Sets  the  current  draw tool to Line draw.  Starting X,Y and
ending  X,Y  screen positions can be entered optionally to set the start
and  end  location  of  the  line  being drawn.  Deluxe Paint's internal
