                               CHAPTER ONE

                        INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW

 Thank you for purchasing Directory Opus 5. We believe you will be
impressed by its new power and features.

 This user manual has been designed to lead you through using Opus 5, or
allow you to quickly skip to chapters of interest. This chapter is
designed to tell you something about the concepts behind Directory Opus 5.
It will provide you with a general overview of its operation, so you can
start using the program immediately. Even if you read nothing else in this
manual, you should read this chapter! Chapter two provides you with a
simple introduction to the Amiga filing system while the subsequent
chapters discuss the individual parts of the Directory Opus 5 system in
more detail.

           DIRECTORY OPUS 5 - THE POWER OF THE AMIGA REALISED!

 There are now many directory utilities for the Amiga, but nothing like
Directory Opus 5. Whatever program you used before, Opus 5 heralds a
totally new generation of directory utilities. Directory Opus 4 reached
the effective limit of power and flexibility for a static directory
utility program. Opus 5 breaks out of the mould! It uses the power of the
Amiga in a way rarely seen before, giving you the most powerful Amiga disk
utility ever.

 PAGE 1

 There are directory utilities, then there's Directory Opus 5!

 Directory Opus 5 is the result of a total rethink on the nature of
directory utilities from authors who have been developing Amiga software
for many years. By using a strict object orientated design methodology to
harness the often hidden, multi-tasking power of the Amiga Operating
System, we have been able to create a totally new program, which is not
only smaller, faster and more efficient than Opus 4, but which is much
smarter in the way it delivers this new power and flexibility.

 No longer are you  confined to a simple two-windowed display. Opus 5 uses
the full potential of the Amiga OS to provide rapid access to an unlimited
number of directory displays, button banks and icon/image banks. Although
Opus 5 is simple and easy to use, it still gives you the ability to
configure the display exactly as you desire. And, all this is done in full
compliance with the Amiga Style Guide principles.

                    MULTITASKING AS IT SHOULD BE DONE!

 Being specific, Opus 5 is a fully mult-threaded, internally multitasking
suite of programs, which are called in to operation when required. These
programs invisibly control the operation of each system object, whether it
be the visual display of a directory list, or a specific action such as
copying files. Each visible component of the Opus 5 display, whether the
main backdrop window, a directory Lister, a Button Bank, or other object,
is actually controlled by an independent program task which interacts with
the objects in the system as required. Commands can pass instructions to
source and target objects to perform actions on demand, independently of
the other objects of the visual display.

 So what does all this technical design talk mean to the user? Simple!
Opus 5 now has more power than ever before, but is even easier to use!.

 PAGE 2

                           NO WAITING, NO DELAY

The object design concept, with its inherent multi-tasking is what
actually gives Opus 5 its, impressive power and makes it so fast and
efficient, Once you understand how it works, with Opus 5 you will no
longer need to wait while one action finishes before starting another, For
example, while de-archiving into one directory, there is now no need to
wait for this to finish before doing something else. Once the action has
been launched, you can immediately open a new directory Lister and start
performing other tasks, all while the first task completes,

The power of Opus 5 is also demonstrated when editing any of the Opus 5
objects or system configuration items. The configuration items and actions
of each object can be edited separately and independently, while never
blocking the actions of other objects. So, while you are editing the
commands attached to a set of custom buttons in a button bank, you can
still be performing jobs with other component object such as the file
Listers.

                   THE OPUS 5 VISUAL DISPLAY OBJECTS

Opus 5 can be run with a myriad of different configurations for almost
every conceivable use. However, the essential nature of the Opus 5 display
consists of a few simple component windows and objects -


     The Main Window: The parent window of the Opus 5 system. It displays
     icons representing devices, Opus 5 groups and any left out icons.
     This may be opened on any public screen in your system including
     Workbench. It provides access to all other objects in the Opus 5
     system.

     Listers: Independent Windows which display lists of files and
     directories. Have only one Lister open to view contents of a
     disk or have as many as you

 PAGE 3

     desire. Each Lister may be a source or destination for actions and
     you may have multiple sources and multiple destinations if desired.

     Button Banks: Windows which display custom action buttons showing
     text or graphic images.

     Configuration and Options: Requesters which allow you to customise
     the visual display and procedural operations of Directory Opus 5.
     These aspects of the program may be changed at any time while the
     program is performing other tasks.


 Apart from the Main Window, each of the above components is actually the
visual footprint of a completely separate program task, which is invoked
only when required. There can always be only one Main Window, but, at any
given time, you may have none or any number of Listers and Button Banks in
any configuration.

                             THE MAIN WINDOW

 When you run Opus 5, the first component opened is the Opus 5 Main
Window.
This is the foundation object in the Opus 5 system. From here, you can
easily access all the volumes and directories in your system, launch the
other Opus 5 components, and, from the menus, double right mouse button
clicks, and hot keys, you can create, edit and adjust Lister displays,
Button Banks, and other items which control the Opus 5 configuration
system. Initially , control over Opus 5 is provided by global menus from
this Main Window. These actions are fully explained later.

 However, the Opus 5 Main Window is much more than just a simple place
holder window. It is actually very similar in concept to the standard
Amiga Workbench with which you are familiar. The Opus 5 Main Window
displays the disk and device icons representing all the volumes in your
system. Just like the Workbench window, you can also

 PAGE 4

leave out your favourite directories, files, and programs. Unlike
Workbench, Opus 5 provides the special ability to create several 'Program
Groups' so you can organise your favourite programs more easily. Opus 5
also supports full Drag add Drop actions for all objects on the Opus 5
Main Window.

 One of the powerful options provided by Opus 5 system is the ability to
use the Opus 5 Main Window as a complete Workbench replacement - so you
never need to run the  Workbench program itself! The Opus 5 main window
provides all the functionality of Workbench, but with the extra power of
Opus 5.

                               FILE LISTERS

 The working heart of the Opus 5 system is the file Lister window. This is
used to display a list of directories and files in the order and format
you desire, Traditionally, one uses two Listers, one as a source and one
as a destination, when copying files between directories. But, often only
one Lister is required, for example, when you wish to view and delete
files from a specific directory, On other occasions, you may wish to copy
files to more than one destination or compare files in multiple
directories. Opus 5 gives you the flexibility to use as few or as many
Listers as you require to get the job done.

 As one of the axioms of Opus 5's object orientated design, file Listers
are designed to be dynamic. Do not consider them as the old-style, static
file display windows which you must leave open and on screen all the time.
Each Opus 5 Lister is a fully independent program with its own in-built
functionality. They have been crafted to be transient objects, to be
brought into existence for the specific job in hand, then discarded.
Alternatively, if your application requires it, you can readily create a
dual or multi-Lister display, lock the Listers in place, and save the
complete configuration setup for use at a later time.

 PAGE 5

                           LISTER DISPLAY MODES

 A file Lister can show files in one of two modes, either Icon Mode, which
displays icons just like Workbench, or the more powerful Opus 5 File Mode,
which provides a host of extra functionality.


 As well as the usual ability to select, display, and drag and drop single
or groups of files and directories, in File Mode each opus 5 Lister has a
range of extra features already built-in. These features include :-

 * a status display showing information on the files in the selected
   directory.

 * the ability to customise the file display by field, type, date, file
   type and other features. You can also customise the font and colours
   used to display the different types of files.

 * a quick access toolbar of custom, icon-image style buttons, each having
   separate actions for left, middle and right mouse buttons

 * a custom popup command menu which by default provides instant access to
   the main internal Opus 5 AmigaDOS commands such as copy , delete, etc.

 * a popup menu giving instant access to directory functions and to the
   history of previously seen directories

 * a popup menu to quickly switch the Lister's status between source or
   destination, between icon and file display, to lock the Lister's status
   as desired, and other functions.

 PAGE 6

                           CUSTOM BUTTON BANKS

 Just like Directory Opus 4, Directory Opus 5 provides you with the
ability to create a bank of custom buttons giving separate functionality
to left and right mouse button clicks. (Opus 5 also adds the middle mouse
button as well.)

 As you may now have come to expect with Opus 5, a Button Bank is not just
limited to the traditional old style, static group of buttons. With Opus
5, you can have as many Button Banks as you wish. The banks can be of any
dimensions which fit on the screen, and the buttons can show either a text
string or a graphical icon-style image.

 Each button has the potential of executing an unlimited set of
instructions made up of any mix of AmigaDOS, Workbench, ARexx, Script or
internal Opus 5 commands. Additionally, each button may have a separate
set of actions invoked by either a left, middle or right mouse click.

 Again, as a result of the object design concept of Opus 5, the custom
buttons used in button banks are a special class of an internal Opus
Button Object. The same class of object is used for the Lister toolbars,
Lister Menus and custom User Menus. This means that not only are custom
buttons fully interchangeable between different banks, but buttons are
fully interchangeable with toolbars buttons and menus. So, as well as
being able to edit multiple buttons from different banks at the same time,
you can even drag and drop 'buttons' between button banks, Lister toolbars
and custom menus!

 Further, since the editing of button banks is independent of other
program operations, you can open, edit and save button banks at any time.
The extra flexibility provided by this approach greatly enhances your
productivity when creating your own buttons or when editing existing sets.

 PAGE 7

                            USER DEFINED MENUS

 You are not limited to custom buttons. Opus 5 also provides two custom
menus systems for you to use; the User Menu is a global menu available
form the Main Window; and the Lister Command Menu is a special set of
menus available from each file Lister.

 Each of these menu sets is fully user definable and each menu may execute
an unlimited set of instructions made up of any mix of AmigaDOS,
Workbench, ARexx, Script or internal Opus 5 commands.
                         CONFIGURATIONS SETTINGS

 Because Directory Opus 5 follows the Amiga Style Guide recommendations as
closely as possible, we have been able to rationalise some of the
excessive and now redundant configuration options presented by some other
programs.

 However, Opus 5 still provides extensive user control over the essential
- elements of the visual environment, plus gives control over the
operational behaviour of the Opus 5 command functions. These settings are
presented in two independent requesters which separately control the
Environment and procedural Options.


 From the Environment section you can save the complete layout of a
particular visual display. This includes not only The screen mode and
colour selections but also encompasses all the Listers and button banks,
their paths and screen positions. It is very easy to tailor a custom
display for a specific job.

 PAGE 8

                      AUTOMATIC RECOGNITION OF FILES

 A very versatile feature of Directory Opus 5 is the ability to recognise
files by type using a system called Filetypes. By using Filetypes, you can
Configure Opus 5 to play  animations when they are double-clicked, to load
a database program when you attempt to "Read" a database file, or to
uncompress an archived file when you drag and drop it to a new directory.

 Opus 5 Comes with several predefined Filetypes for many of the common
types of files you may encounter on the Amiga. We also provide a full
Filetype editor where you may edit current Filetypes and associated
actions. It is relatively easily to teach Opus 5 to recognises new types
of files and provide commands to be executed when you double-click, drag
and drop, Or apply special Opus 5 functions to such files.

 PAGE 9

                               CHAPTER TWO

                     INTRODUCTION TO FILE MANAGEMENT

 The theory behind a directory utility such as Directory Opus 5 is quite
simple. Instead of having to struggle with a primitive Command Line
Interface and 'mysterious' AmigaDOS commands, you are presented with an
easy-to-use interface which shows the contents of multiple directories,
and presents the various commands in a manner which makes them much easier
to use.


 On the screen, you open up one or more 'directory windows' or file
Listers. Into a Lister you can read and display the contents of a
directory from any device or volume accessible by the Amiga . You select
files and / or directories, then manipulate them almost any way you like.
Selected entries can be copied to other Listers, deleted or renamed; text
files can be read, picture files can be viewed, and sound files can be
heard. Directory Opus 5 offers much more than these "barebones" features,
and you will learn more later in this manual.

                          FILES AND DIRECTORIES

 The Amiga's DOS (Disk Operating System) deals with two kinds of data
arrangement:- files and directories.

 PAGE 11

 Each file and directory must be given a unique name; within a directory
you cannot have two files, two directories, or a file and a directory with
the same name.

                                  FILES

 Any data you record on a disk is stored in a file. Files contain
information, which may be from a database, from a word processor, from a
painting program, or the entire contents of a program.

 The size of a file is expressed in bytes, each byte being equivalent to
one character. Storing the string "Hello" in a file would use five bytes,
since the word "Hello" is five characters long.

 Whether a file can be displayed, executed, deleted, edited, or considered
as a script file, depends upon its attributes.

 All files have a datestamp which shows the system time and date when the
file was last written to.

 Files may also have a comment of up to 79 characters attached to them.

                               DIRECTORIES

 To store information in a logical manner, disks are generally organised
into directories, which are often referred to as drawers. If you picture a
disk as a filing cabinet, with your programs, database files and pictures
as the actual files, than directories are the drawers of the filing
cabinet. Some of these drawers have further drawers inside  them, called
subdirectories, which themselves contain drawers, and so on, indefinitely.

 The directory or subdirectory containing any given subdirectory is known,
as its Parent Directory.

 PAGE 12

 The highest level of organisation is the Root Directory. If the directory
is a filing cabinet, then the root directory is the room it stands in. The
route you take along a directory tree to reach a file is called the path.
As you proceed along the path, each branch of the tree is separated from
the next by a ' /' character. For example, on your hard drive, the path to
the Directory Opus 5 directory should be Work:Opus5. To refer to the
Directory Opus 5 program, you would use what is called the pathname. This
Consists of the file's path followed by the name of the file. For example,
Work:Opus5/DirectoryOpus.

 The number of files and subdirectories any given directory can contain is
limited only by the amount of space on the disk,

 For a more complete explanation of file structure, please consult the
Amiga Users Manuals.

                       INSTALLING DIRECTORY OPUS 5

 You cannot run Directory Opus 5 directly from the master distribution
disk. It is designed to run ONLY after being installed ON your hard drive,

 Installation of Opus 5 is handled by the standard Amiga installer program
and an associated script. Do not attempt to install the program parts
yourself. For the correct operation of Opus 5, you MUST use the
installation procedure provided. Don't worry, the installer script does
everything for you, offering you few choices.


 Insert the master distribution disk in your floppy disk drive and open
the disk icon from your workbench screen. Double-Click on the
'InstallOpus' icon to start the installation procedure, then follow the
instructions on the screen to install Directory Opus 5. The program,
related files and directories will be installed into a new directory on
your hard disk called 'Opus5'.

 Once the installer script has done its job, Directory Opus 5 will be
automatically run so that you may serialise your installed copy to
complete the installation. (See Serialising Directory Opus 5 on Page 19).

 PAGE 15

                    TECHNICAL DETAILS OF INSTALLATION

 Although there is no need for you to be concerned about the installation
process, the following is a brief technical discussion about how Opus 5
expects to be installed.

 Directory Opus 5 is designed to run ONLY from its own directory on a hard
disk.

 It also expects to have certain subdirectories installed under the Opus5
directory. Briefly, these are

                               ENVIRONMENT

 Contains the "Environment files. These define the total environment under
which Directory Opus 5 operates. As well as defining the visual display
characteristics for screen mode and palette etc, and links to the other
items in the program configuration. Environment files also keen track of
any the default Listers you wish to open, including the position, current
path and current list format. By default, on startup Opus 5 will use
Environment/Default.

                                 SETTINGS

 Contains the Options files, which define most of the user- configurable
options and special flags. By default Opus 5 will use Settings/Default.

                                 BUTTONS

 Contains files detailing the various button bank definitions. Note that
all function definitions are stored as button banks. This means that
button banks, Lister toolbars, Lister menus and user menu files are all
interchangable. Even graphical and textual button banks may be
interchanged, but they may look slightly odd!. By default, Opus 5 will
look for Buttons/Toolbar to use as the Lister toolbar , Button/Lister Menu
to use for the Lister menu, and Buttons/User Menu for the user menu.

 PAGE 16

                                  IMAGES

 Contains the various image files for toolbar and other button images. All
images are stored as IFF ILBM brushes. (The default images are " x 14
pixels.)

                                  ICONS

 Contains the default icon files ('.info') used by Opus 5 when creating
new drawers and associated files.

                                  GROUPS

 Contains all the stored special Program Groups you create.

                                FILETYPES

 Filetypes are global to the Opus 5 system and are stored in individual
files, rather than being stored in any specific configuration file. Any
Filetypes present in this directory will be loaded automatically . Opus 5
uses file notification to keep track of changes you make while it is
running. Each physical file stores only one actual Filetype definition.

                                 STORAGE

 Contains extra blank Filetype definitions.

                           MODULES, LIBS AND C

 Contains various programs, program modules and libraries to control Opus
5 operations.

                                   HELP

 Contains various programs, program modules and libraries to control Opus
5 operations

 PAGE 17

                           INSTALLATION OPTIONS

 Apart from allowing you to select where to install the Opus5 directory,
the installer script offers you the choice of having Directory Opus 5 run
automatically when you next boot up your computer. If this is not
required, choose option (d) and you may then run Directory Opus 5 from the
Workbench or from the CLI at a later time.

 You will be presented with choices similar to the following

     a) Start Opus 5 on boot

     b) Start Opus 5 Iconified

     c) Use Opus 5 as Workbench Replacement!

     d) Do not start Opus 5 on boot

 Options (a) and (b) will place a small file in your SYS.WBStartup drawer
which will automatically run Opus 5 when you boot your computer. Option
(c) will install Opus 5 as a default Workbench replacement. Specifically,
it replaces your old 'LoadWB' program in the , C:' directory with a new
version which will load Opus 5 instead of the usual Workbench program. For
safety, the original 'LoadWB' program is renamed to 'LoadWB_old'.

 If you have installed the 'LoadWB' program from Opus 5 and wish to boot
your computer with the old workbench instead, simply hold down the SHIFT
key while the computer is booting.

                       SERIALISING DIRECTORY OPUS 5

 In the program package you will find a registration card with your
personal serial number. Before you can use your new Directory Opus 5
program, it must be personalised with this serial number. When prompted,
enter your serial number and other details as shown on the screen. Select
'OK' when done and Opus 5 will be ready for use.

 This would be a good time to complete and return your registration card
to the address an the back of the card. Please remember that technical
support and upgrades are only available to registered users.

 Please safeguard your personal serial number. If you need to re-install
Directory Opus 5, you will need to serialise the program again with this
number. You will also have to quote this number for technical support and
upgrades.

*************************************************************************
 Be sure to enter your registration number EXACTLY as shown on your
registration card, including correct upper case and lower case characters
as shown.

                         RUNNING DIRECTORY OPUS 5

 There are several ways of starting Directory Opus 5.

     * Automatically on Boot

     * From the Workbench

     * From the CLI

 Each of these options is discussed below.

                        AUTOMATIC STARTUP ON BOOT

 The modern method of starting a program on boot is to put an icon in the
WBStartup drawer of your boot disk. You could place the whole Directory
Opus 5 program (and icon) in there, but this is a severe waste of space.
We have provided a special icon named 'Opus5_Startup' especially for this
purpose. If not already installed by the InstsllOpus script, you  will
find this icon in your Opus5 drawer in the subdirectory WBStartup. To
start Opus 5 when you boot your computer, simply drag this icon into the
WBStartup drawer of your boot partition on your hard disk.

 The older method of starting a program from boot was to add lines to your
startup-sequence or user-startup files. We recommend that you use the
WBStartup options as above instead of modifying these files.

 You can modify the startup behaviour of Opus 5 by changing the ToolTypes
in Opus5 - Startup icon. (See page 22.)

                         STARTING FROM WORKBENCH


 The easiest way to run Directory Opus 5 is from the Workbench. Double-
click on the Directory Opus 5 icon and, a few seconds later, the program
will appear. It will

 PAGE 20

 load the default Environment settings and appear either on its own screen
or on Workbench, as defined in the Environment. You can modify the startup
behaviour of Opus 5 by changing the ToolTypes in the program icon. (See
page 22.)

                         STARTING FROM THE CLI

 To run Directory Opus 5 from the CLI enter:-

     DOpus5:DirectoryOpus

 This assumes that you have installed the program on your hard drive using
the InstallOpus script provided and that the correct assignment of
"DOpus5:" has been made. (The InstallOpus script should have done this for
you.)

 The more technically inclined may notice that there is no RUN command on
the instruction line. Directory Opus 5 detaches itself from the CLI,
leaving the CLI free to be used for other commands and ultimately allowing
you to close the CLI window completely.


 Directory Opus 5 can take a series of extra command line arguments to
modify the initial startup behaviour. (See page 22.)

 PAGE 21

                    TOOLTYPES, COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS

 By changing the ToolTypes in either the program icon or the Opus5_Startup
icon, you can modify the initial startup behaviour of the program, The
ToolType settings have the following meaning


 ENVIRONMENT=filename

     The filename is the pathname of a special
     Environment file to be loaded and used.


 CX_POPUP=yes/ no

     This defines whether Opus 5 will open its main
     screen on startup or not. To start Opus 5
     iconified, set this to No.

 CX_ POPKEY=key

     This defines the Opus 5 Hotkey combination, The
     default combination is Ctrl - left shift - left Alt.

 QUIET

     Tells Opus 5 not to display the "Loading
     program..." requester.

 When starting Opus 5 from the CLI, the above arguments may also be used
as command line switches.

 PAGE 22

                            CHAPTER FOUR

 USING DIRECTORY OPUS 5

 This section gives you a short tour of Directory Opus 5. It describes
the operation of the program when using its default configuration. Other
configuration options are described in later chapters.

 ABORTING OPERATIONS

 Before using the program, it is important to know how to abort an
action. Most functions can be aborted once they have begun. This can be
quite useful if you accidentally start deleting the contents of your hard
drive.

 To abort an operation, select the 'Abort' gadget shown in the file
Lister. Do not be alarmed if the action does not abort immediately; some
functions such as copy, may have to finish with the file they are working
upon before exiting.

 Because Opus 5 uses extensive multitasking, it will often internally
spawn another task or program to perform your selected action. Or, the
selected action may be spread over a number of Opus 5's internal tasks.
For example, when de- archiving, Opus 5 will spawn your selected
archiver, for example, LHA, with the arguments to perform that job.
After this Opus 5 will return to monitoring its main screen. To abort
such actions, it will be the LHA tash you must abort not Opus 5.

 PAGE 23

 OPUS CONTEXT SENSITIVE HELP

 Directory Opus 5 provides extensive context-sensitive help. Simply move
the mouse pointer over an object in the current window and press the
'Help' key. This will lookup the object in the Opus 5 AmigaGuide-based
help system and display the details of the object, button, or command
pointed to by the mouse pointer.

 If the mouse pointer is over an Opus 5 Custom Button, the help system
will display information on the first Command attached to that button, Of
course, Opus 5 can only show details of its own internal commands. It
Cannot show details for script files or calls to AmigaDOS programs.

 See Fig 4-1 Opus Context Sensitive Help

 PAGE 24

 DIRRECTORY OPUS 5 COMPONENTS

 As discussed in the introduction, Directory Opus 5 consists of a number
of inter-related objects, each running as its own task or process but
communicating with the other objects as required.

 The main objects of the Directory Opus 5 system are a base window,
called the Opus 5 Main Window, plus any number of the following objects:-
a window displaying files and directories, called a Lister; a window
displaying custom buttons, called a Button Bank; secondary
requesters for functions such as DiskCopy and Forma t; and from time to
time, various windows used to edit and adjust the configuration settings
or other operational parameters of the Opus 5 system.

 This may all seem a little complicated at first but in practice it is
not! It just uses the capabilities of the Amiga to allow you to do
several things a t once, if you w ant. In reality you will find the power
and flexibility easy to master.

 THE OPUS 5 MAIN WINDOW

 When Opus 5 is started, it first opens its main display window. This is
the handle by which you initially access basic Opus 5 functions.

 This window, and its underlying process, provides similar functionality
to that of Workbench, In fact, as discussed on page 18, you can run Opus
5 instead of Workbench and use the Opus 5 Main window as a replacement
for the standard Workbench window.

 Like Workbench, the Opus 5 Main Window shows icons representing the
disks and volumes available. Once you have mastered using Opus 5 itself,
you may also wish to

 PAGE 25

'leave out' other icons for your favorite files, directories and
programs.

 You can select to open the Opus 5 Main Window on its own custom public
screen, on the Workbench screen, or on any public screen available in
your system. You may also use the Opus 5 Main Window in place of
Workbench as discussed elsewhere

 PROGRAM APPLICATION ICONS

 Opus 5 can display the AppIcon images which application programs may
open as special handles on workbench. The display of these may be
controlled by a switch in the Environment requester as discussed later,
If You turn this option on, Opus 5 will hear about these events from the
Amiga OS whenever a program attempts to add these to the Workbench
display.

 SELECTING ICONS

 To access any icon displayed on the main window, simply double-click on
the icon with the left mouse button. This will open the volume or device
and read its contents into an Opus 5 file Lister display.

 Alternatively, you may use the keyboard to select and activate the icons
as follows:-

     the SPACE key toggles keyboard selection mode,
     the Arrow cursor keys move the highlight,
     the RETURN key activates the selected icon.

 LEAVING ICONS OUT

 If you wish to leave out other icons representing files, programs or
directories, simply drag and drop the item(s) onto the main window from a
file Lister display.

 PAGE 26

 PROGRAM GROUPS

 On the Amiga, the concept of Program Groups is unique to Opus 5, Instead
of having to leave out all your favourite applications on the main
window, Opus 5 gives you an easy way to organise your files by allowing
you to creat custom drawers called Groups. In a Group drawer you can
 Collect your favourite applications for immediate access.

 As examples, you could create a Group called 'Graphics' and store in it
programs such as DPaint, Brilliance, Photogenics or other painting
programs, you could then create a group called 'DTP' to hold programs
such as Wordworth, Final Writer, PageStream or similar.

 So,instead of 'having' to search all over your harddisk for  each
program, you could then simply open the 'DTP' group, for example, and
double-click on the required program such as PageStream.

 To place applications in a specific Group drawer, open an Opus 5 Lister
showing the application's current directory then drag and drop the
application icon into the Group window.

*************************************************************************
 Not all icons may be placed into a Group drawer. If a file does not have
an associated TOOL or PROJECT icon, it cannot be placed in a Group
drawer. Also, you connot place other drawers in a Group drawer.
*************************************************************************

 MENUS

 Access to other main Opus 5 functions is provided by global menus
attached to this window. (See The Global Menus on page 43.)

 PAGE 27

 THE OPUS 5 FILE LISTER

 The hub of the Opus 5 system is the file Lister. Each file Lister is an
independent process with its own output window. You may have as many of
Lister windows open at any one time as you desire. Often, you will select
two or more windows to act in concert to, say, copy files between one
directory and another. Alternatively, you may only require one lister to
view files in a directory and play a series of sound files.

 See Fig 4-2 File Lister

 Opus 5 Listers can display files in one of two ways, in Icon Mode or
File Mode.

 We shall discuss File Mode first since this is the native mode of the
Lister display. This mode is designed to display the file list in greater
detail, as well as providing many extra commands to make file
manipulation easier.

 PAGE 28

 LISTER FILE MODE

 In File Mode, the Lister display window has the following features

 LISTER WINDOW TITLE BAR

 The title bar is at the very top of the Lister display. It is used to
display various status or error messages, Usually, this will show the
disk volume name, the name of the current directory, and the amount of
free space on this drive.

 As with normal Amiga windows, if the Lister window is active, the window
title bar will be highlighted. If you are unsure what Directory Opus 5 is
doing, it is a good idea to look in the title bar for a hint.

 LISTER STATUS BAR

 See Fig 4-3 Lister Status Bar

 Immediately underneath the title bar, is the Lister status display with
three imbedded gadgets. This area shows details about the current
directory and selected items. It also defines whether a Lister is the
source or destination for file operations. From the Environment/Lister
Display menu, bars of source and destination Listers. This gives you an
instant visual clue to the status of each Lister.

 The Lister status bar has four parts which are described in detail over
the following pages.

 PAGE 29

 a) THE LISTER MESSAGE AREA

 The large area on the left shows either a message about the Lister
display, or, more usually, when a device or directory has been selected,
it shows information about the directories, files and byte size in the
current Lister display. The number of directories, files and bytes is
shown in the following format:-

      D:[xxx/yyy] F:[xxx/yyy] B:[xxx/yyy]

 where yyy is the total number of items, and xxx is the number of each
item currently selected,


 b) THE LISTER COMMAND MENU

 See Fig 4-4 Lister Command Menu

 This special gadget provides a popup menu which may be used to hold your
favourite Opus 5 commands, These commands act only on the Lister to which
they are attached. Opus 5 comes with a pre-defined set of commands for
this menu. By default, Opus 5 will load the file Buttons/Lister Menu, but
you may readily customise these defaults to your own requirements.
(See The Menu Editor on page 140.)

 PAGE 30

 c) THE LISTER DEVICE GADGET

 See Fig 4-5 Lister Device Gadget

 This special gadget provides a popup menu with quick access to the
current Parent and Root directories, the system device list and Opus 5's
internal cache list, and the history of previous directories seen by this
Lister.

 d) THE LISTER STATUS GADGET

 See Fig 4-6 Lister Status Gadget

 This special gadget displays the current status of the Lister. It also
provides access to a popup menu to change the Lister status and display.

 Each Lister may be temporarily defined as a source (SRCE) or destination
(DEST) for file operations. When activated, a Lister usually becomes the
source, and the previous source (if any) becomes the destination. If
more than two Listers are displayed at one time, when activated, the
Listers will cycle between SRCE, DEST and OFF in turn.

 PAGE 31

 Alternatively, a Lister may be permanently locked as a source or
destination. Listers may also be OFF, that is neither SRCE or DEST.

 Other options available from the popup menu include

      Iconify: Reduces the window to a small icon on the
      Opus 5 Main Window. This saves memory but
      retains the contents of the Lister directory, To Un-
      iconify a Lister, simply click on the icon.

      Lock Position: Normally, each Lister is displayed in
      a standard Amiga window, which may be d ragged
      to any position and may also be resized. However,
      Opus 5 provides the option to lock the Lister
      window in a set position at a set size. A useful
      option if you wish to mimic other directory utilities
      such as Directory Opus 4.

      Edit: Allows you to edit the list format display
      options for a specific Lister, This can also be
      accessed from a double-click of the right mouse in
      the Lister window. (See Lister Format on page 33.).

      View icons: Switches the Lister display to Icon
      Mode. Note that once you switch to Icon Mode, you
      lose the Lister Status Bar, popup menus and
      Toolbar. To return to File Mode, you must use the
      global menus and select Lister/View As/Name.

 PAGE 32

 LISTER DISPLAY FORMAT AND SORT ORDER

 When first opened, a Lister uses the default display format as defined
in the current Environment file, This may be set from
Environment/Edit/Lister/Display/Default Format. However, you may change
the display format for each Lister on a temporary basis.

 See Fig 4-7 List Format

 The Lister format editor may be invoked from the Lister status menu
(Edit) or by double-click of the right mouse  button in a Lister window.
The format of each Lister may be changed independently.

 The display forma t used in each Lister can be made up of any of the
following fields, in whatever order you wish

     File Name File Size
     Date Stamp Protection
     Comment File Type
     Owner Group
     Net Access

 The chosen display order is shown in the Display/Sort list with the
field by which the data is sorted tagged with a check mark.

 PAGE 33

 You can move items from the Available list to the Display/Sort list by
clicking on them. Alternatively, if you click and hold a given item, you
can drag and drop it between the lists, and also drag it to a new
position in the Display/Sort list.

     Entry Separation: Choose between a display with
     Directories shown first, files shown first, or a mix of
     files and directories, sorted in order as selected above.

     Reverse Sorting: By default, the display is sorted in
     alphabetical order, or, if the item starts with a number,
     then the item is sorted in numerical order. Tick this
     gadget to display the list in reverse order.

 Normally, the Opus 5 file Listers will display all files and directories
in the selected directory. By using the filters you can restrict the
files displayed.

     Filter icons: By default, all the `.info' icons files are also
     displayed in the list. Check this gadget if you wish to
     not display these files.

     Hidden: When checked, tells Opus 5 to NOT show any
     files with the 'H' or hidden bit set.

     Show and Hide: These text fields allow you to select a
     pattern of files to show or files to hide. The pattern may
     be defined using the standard Amiga wild cards of `#`
     and '?'. For example, putting '#?.o' in the Hide field,
     will cause the Lister to hide any file ending in `.o'.

 DYNAMIC RESORTING

 Lister support dynamic resorting so it is easy to quickly change the
sorting method in a specific Lister, For example, you may wish to see
recently added files in a directory  To do this, double-click the right
mouse button over a Lister to bring up the format editor, select Date
Stamp as the sort method, and tick Reverse Sorting and select OK.

 PAGE 34

 SPECIAL FORMATS FOR DEFINED DIRECTORIES

 In some cases, you may often wish to define a specific display format
for a particular directory. For example, you may wish normal directories
to be sorted in file name order, but with a 'Downloads' directory, you
may wish to see the latest files you have received, From the global menu
Settings/Options/Edit/Path Formats you can specify a display format for a
specific defined path. (See page 73.)

 LISTER TOOLBAR

 Immediately beneath the status bar, is an optional toolbar showing small
graphic images or icons. each of these images is actually a normal Opus 5
action button for which you may define separate actions for left, middle
and right mouse clicks.

 By default, Opus 5 uses the file Buttons/Toolbar, but you may easily
define your own Toolbar, The images and actions of the Toolbar buttons
can be edited from the global Lister/Edit Lister Toolbar menu. (See page
140.)

*************************************************************************
 Because the Opus 5 Lister is a normal Amiga windows it will not see
middle or right mouse button events unless it is the Active window,
clicking the right mouse button on the window activates it, Clicking the
left mouse button on a Toolbar image will activate the window AND perform
the action you have defined for that icon.
*************************************************************************

 DIRECTORY PATH

 At the bottom of the Lister display is a string gadget which contains
the full directory path. To go quickly to a specific directory, you may
enter the full path in this box and press return.

 PAGE 35

 HIDDEN PARENT BUTTON

 Each directory window contains a hidden Parent button on the outer edge
of the window area which will move you to a Parent directory. From any
Lister in File Mode, when you click the left mouse button on the left-
hand window border, Directory Opus 5 will display directory's parent if
it has one. When you click the right mouse button on the hidden Parent
button, Directory Opus 5 will display the root directory.

 ICON MODE DISPLAY

 Icon Mode provides a simple workbench tvpegraphical display where files
are displayed by their associated icons. It is best used for running
PROJECT applications which can be run more easily from their associated
icons, or for quick  access to a new disk.

 In Icon Mode, the Lister window does not have the status bar and
toolbar, nor its associated gadgets, only a standard window display is
shown.

 Icon Mode is not designed to be used for extensive file manipulation, If
you wish to do this, switch to File Mode, However, you may still copy
files using the simple drag and drop operation,

 The prime purpose for Icon Mode is to provide extra compatibility with a
standard Workbench display. In Icon Mode, when you double-click on an
icon, if the object is a PROJECT or TOOL icon, Opus 5 will launch the
application as if run from Workbench, Otherwise, the normal Opus 5 rules
apply and Opus 5 will look at the file type and follow the instructions
you have provided under the particular FileType definition. (See
FileTypes on page 99)

 PAGE 36

 The different modes of operation can be seen using the master Opus 5
disk as an example, In File Mode, if you double-click on the
'InstallOpus5' icon on the master Opus 5 disk, Opus 5 will call the text
viewer and display the script file as text. In icon Mode, because the
'InstallOpus5' is actually a PROJECT icon, a double-click will run the
`Installer' program with the 'InstallOpus5' script.

 Once you switch to Icon Mode, you lose the Lister status bar, popup
menus and toolbar, To return to File Mode, you must use the global menus
and select Lister/View As/Name.

 USING THE FILE LISTERS

 A Lister is used to display the list of directories and files in a
selected directory, You may also display the list of available devices
and assigns, or internal Opus 5 cached directories.

 Most actions and commands only apply to the highlighted items in the
list, although some commands, such as MakeDir, obviously, act to create a
new directory in the current directory as shown in the Lister,

 Actions such as Copy , CopyAs, Move etc, act between a Lister defined as
the Source (SRCE) and a Lister defined as a Destination (DEST). If you
are using a multi-windowed multi-Lister display , be careful that you
have set the SRCE and DEST Listers correctly before you attempt a semi-
destructive action such as Copy, Move, Delete and so on.

 Actions selected from the Toolbar or popup menu in a particular Lister
act only on that Lister, Actions selected from Button Banks, act on the
defined source Lister or between the source and destination Listers
depending on the particular command or action.

 PAGE 37

 USING A MOUSE WITH A LISTER

 Activating a Lister

 Single left-click on the Lister window title to activate the Lister
 window.

 Left-click on status bar to make the Lister the source (SRCE).

 SHIFT left-click on status bar to make the Lister the destination
(DEST).

 ALT left-click on status bar turns the Lister OFF.

 CTRL left-click on status bar toggles the LOCK option. This toggles a
 SRCE to locked SRCE! or DEST to locked DEST!

 Double right-click over Lister to bring up the Lister Format Editor.

 MOVING AROUND

 If there is more information available than will fit into the Lister
display, either horizontally or vertically, a limited display will be
presented. Use the window's horizontal or vertical scroll bars to reveal
the rest of the display.

 Alternatively, you can also scroll up and down, and left and right, by
holding the right mouse button and moving the mouse.

 SELECTING FILES AND DIRECTORIES

 To select or highlight a file or directory, simply click on it with the
left mouse button.

 To highlight multiple items, click and hold the left mouse button and
drag downwards or upwards to select the adjacent items,

 PAGE 38

 DRAG AND DROP

 Dragging selected items horizontally allows you to pick them up and move
them out of the Lister, you can then drop them either in another Lister
or on the main Opus 5 window. This is called Drag and Drop.

 Specifically, to drag and drop, select one or more files and/or
directories, and either

    move horizontally outside of the window while
    holding button down
 or
    press right button while holding left button.

 Unless otherwise defined, drag and drop of a file copies the item to the
new location, For consistency, drag and drop operations on a directory
perform the same copy function.

 DIRECTORIES

 Double-click on a directory to enter and display that directory.

 Drag and drop a directory to copy the directory to the new location, or
leave it out if dropped onto the Opus 5 main window.

 SHIFT drag and drop of a directory does not copy the directory but
displays the contents of the directory in the destination Lister,
(Actually, it is holding down the SHIFT key when you drop the directory
which does the trick!)

 SHIFT double-click on a directory to open up a new Lister for that
directory.

 SHIFT ALT double-click on a directory to split the current Lister
display and open a new directory Lister.

 PAGE 39

 DOUBLE CLICK POWER!

 Some of the power of Opis 5 is revealed by a simple double-click on a
file. Opus 5 examines the file to determine if it knows the specific
Filetype. If file matches a previously user-defined Filetype, for which
the appropriate function has been defined, the function is executed.

 If file does not match a user-defined Filetype, it is tested against the
internal Filetype definitions, which are as follows:

 FILETYPE                    FUNCTION

 Executable program          Run
 ILBM picture                Show
 Picture (DT)                Show (via datatypes)
 ANIM animation              Show (plays animation)
 8SVX sound                  Play
 Sound (DT)                  Play (via datatypes)
 Icon                        Dispaly IconInfo
 Opus 5 Button file          Load Buttons
 Opus 5 Environment file     Load Environment
 Opus 5 Options file         Load Options


 If none of these match, then the SmartRead function is called, This will
display the file as ASCII (with or without ANSI sequences) or in
hexadecimal, depending on its contents.

 The default action for drag and drop for all internal Filetypes is to
Copy the file, but, this can be Overridden by user-defined Filetypes.

 PAGE 40

 USING THE KEYBOARD WITH A LISTER

 SPACE toggles the keyboard selection mode. The cursor keys or keypad
cursor keys may be used to move the highlight up and down the list, These
actions are:-


 Key                           Function
 -----------------------------------------------
 Home / CTRL cursor up         top of list
 End / CTRL cursor down        bottom of list
 Pg Up / SHIFT cursor up       up one page
 Pg Dn / SHIFT cursor down     down one page


 Other key sequences include:-

 TAB activates the next (non-busy) Lister.

 RETURN (in keyboard selection mode) toggles selection status of a file.
In non-keyboard mode, it activates the path field at the bottom of the
Lister.

 Enter (in keyboard selection mode) performs the same action as a double
mouse click.

 SHIFT-ESCAPE closes the Lister.

 Other key functions include:-


 Key                          Function
 ------------------------------------------
 Del                          Format Editor

 QUICK ACCESS TO A FILE NAME

 To scroll quickly to the first file entry starting with a particular
letter, press that letter, the list will scroll as close as it can get to
the first entry, Press a letter in conjunction with either SHIFT key to
scroll to the first Directory beginning with that letter.

 CONVERTING DIRECTORY OPUS 4 CONFIGURATION FILES

 Directory Opus 5 is able to detect and convert the old configuration
files from Directory Opus 4 ONLY. Opus 5 is not able to convert
environment files from earlier Versions. If you have a version earlier
than version 4 then you will have to convert the files using version 4
first!

 See Fig 4-8 Convert configuration

 If you select Environment/Open in Opus 5, and try to load an old version
4 configuration file, you will be asked which parts of the old
configuration you wish to convert, The basename you specify will be used
when creating individual files corresponding to Button Banks, etc,

 Opus 5 does not use the old 'Hotkeys' concept, so these will not be
converted, but Opus 5 will convert your old Buttons, Menus and Filetypes.

                            CHAPTER FIVE

 THE GLOBAL MAIN MENUS

 Many of the main functions of Directory Opus 5 can be accessed from the
menus from the Opus 5 Main Window, These are known as the Global Menus and
may be accessed in the usual manner with the right mouse button from the
main, window.

**************************************************************************
 The right mouse button is used for other functions in Opus 5, depending
on the actual position of the mouse. For example, when the mouse is over
an active file Lister or Button Bank, pressing the right mouse button will
not access the global menus. Instead, it may attempt to activate the
function attached to the button. Remember that the file Listers have their
own popup menus as well which are accessed with the right mouse button.
**************************************************************************

 EXECUTE COMMAND

 Allows you to start an AmigaDos command without having to open a new
Shell. Opus 5 will open a requester for you to enter the command and any
arguments.

 See Fig 5-1 Directory Opus Requester

 If required, Opus 5 will open a new CONSOLE window to output the results
of the command, The window will remain open until you select the close
gadget.

 For shell and AmigaDOS commands, the current directory for the Execute
Command is RAM:

 ABOUT

Displays information about Directory Opus 5 including
the version number and your registration details.

 HIDE

 Iconifies Directory Opus 5. This command closes the Directory Opus 5
window and screen, deallocates as much memory as possible, and then opens
a small

 PAGE 44

window on the Workbench screen, This is known as iconifying, and allows
you to have Directory Opus 5 constantly available, while using the minimum
amount of memory.

 To determine the initial position of the iconified window, especially if
you start up Directory Opus 5 in the iconified state, position the
iconified window where you would like it to appear, then un-iconify and
re-enter Directory Opus 5, and save the Environment. (See Environment
Editor on page 61.)

 To re enter Directory Opus 5, simply activate the iconified window with a
click of the left mouse button in the window, then press the right mouse
button, If you wish to quit Directory Opus 5 without going back into it,
just click the Close button at the far left of the iconified window.

 ICINIFY OPTIONS

 There are several options which allow you to define the iconify method
you prefer. For more details see the Settings/Options/Options/Hide Method
menu.

 If you have the Hide Method set to AppIcon, you can drag icons from
Workbench and drop them on the Directory Opus 5 icon. This will have the
same effect as if you displayed the file in Directory Opus 5 window and
double-clicked on it. For example, if you drop a picture on the window, it
could call the Show function.

 If you have the Hide Method set to hotKey only, the only way to re-enter
Directory )pus is by using the defined hotkey combination. This defaults
to CTRL-left SHIFT-left ALT (the CTRL key, the left SHIFT key and the left
ALT key held down simultaneously). This may be changed by setting the
CX_POPKEY tooltype in Directory Opus 5 icon to a different combination.

 PAGE 45

 QUIT

 Shuts down all open windows and quits Directory Opus 5, If Opus 5 has
launched any associated tasks on its main window, you will have to quit
any Such programs before Opus 5 can fully close down.

 THE LISTER MENU

 NEW

 Opens up a new blank Lister relative to the mouse position. When the new
Lister opens it initially displays the Device List. Either select the
desired Volume or press RETURN to activate the path gadget where you can
manually enter a path.

 CLOSE

 Closes the current active Lister. Note that no warning is given, the
currently active Lister will close immediately.

 Make Source
 Make Dest
 Lock as Source
 Lock as Destination
 Unlock
 Turn Off

 These menu selections apply to the currently active Lister while it is in
File mode ONLY. The actions are identical to those chosen from the Lister
ToolBar popup menu. See Lister Toolbar for more details.

 UNLOCK ALL

 Unlocks the SRCE or DEST status of all Listers on the screen. If multiple
SRCE or DEST Listers are present, they will be changed to SRCR, DEST or
OFF depending on the order in which they were invoked.

 PAGE 46

 CLOSE ALL

 Closes all Listers currently on the screen.

 EDIT

 Displays the Format Editor and allows you to change the display format of
the currently active Lister's display. You may also invoke the Format
editor from the Lister Toolbar popup menus or by double-clicking the right
mouse button on a Lister display area.

 (See Lister Display Format on page 33.).

 EDIT LISTER TOOLBAR

 Displays the ToolBar Editor which allows you to customise the icon images
and commands used in the Lister ToolBar.

 The Toolbar Editor may also be invoked by holding down the ALT key and
clicking on one of the toolbar icon images.

 (See The toolbar Editor on page 134.)

 EDIT LISTER MENU

 Displays the Menu Editor which allows you to customise the user popup
menus in the toolbar. (See the Menu Editor on page 140.)

 TILE - HORIZONTALLY OR VERTICALLY

 Arranges the displayed Listers to fit equally within the Opus 5 Main
Window with either horizontal or vertical priority . If the main window is
in Backdrop mode, this will tile the Listers equally over the whole
screen.

 PAGE 47

 The tile function provides Some easy methods of setting up a multi-
windowed display. For example, if you have button banks on the screen, set
the main window to non-backdrop and arrange its position and size to just
inside the borders of your button windows. Then, tile the Listers in the
required fashion. This will neatly arrange the Listers and your button
banks.

 CASCADE

 Opus 5 Main Window. If the main window is set as a backdrop, this will
cascade the current Listers over the full screen.

 SNAPSHOT

 Snapshots the size and position of the currently active Lister. This
function will only work if the directory has an associated icon Or '.info'
file since Opus 5 stores the positional information in the icon itself. If
Opus 5 cannot find the icon, it will flash the screen as a warning. This
function cannot be used to snapshot icons (See the Icons/Snapshot menu on
page 49.)

 VIEW AS - NAME OR ICON

 Selects the type of display to be shown in the current Lister, either
Workbench style Icon mode or the normal Opus 5 File mode.

     Name: Selects the normal Opus 5 file display which
     shows extended file name and associated details.
     This is the default mode for Opus 5 file management
     operation. In File mode, the Lister display has the
     extra features provided by the Status Bar, Toolbar
     and popup menus.

     Icon: Selects to display files by their icons instead
     of by the extended file names. Normally only files
     with associated icons will be displayed.

 PAGE 48

     Show All: Only available in Icon Mode. It tells
     Opus 5 to display all the files and directories using
     pseudo-icons for those which do not have real icons.

 THE ICONS MENU

 OPEN

 Acts the same as a double click on an icon. 1 f the icon is a disk or
drawer, it will open a new Lister and display the directory contents. If
the icon is a PROJECT or TOOL, Opus 5 will examine the file to determine
if it knows the specific Filetype. If file matches a previously user-
defined FileType, for which the appropriate function has been defined, the
function is executed.

 If the file does not match a user-defined Filetype, it is tested against
the internal Filetype definitions and is action is taken accordingly. (See
Filetypes on page 99.).

 INFORMATION

 Display status information about selected icon. It also allows you to
edit the ToolTypes and other information in an application icon.

 SNAPSHOT

 Saves the current layout position of the selected icon or icons within
the currently active window or group, or the layout of the icons within a
group window. The next time you run Opus 5, icons which have been
snapshotted will appear in the previously saved positions. (Also see
Program Groups on page 51.)

     Icons: Snapshots the current position of the selected
     icons in the active window. Only highlighted icons
     within the active window are stored.

 PAGE 49

     Window: Snapshots the current position of the
     currently active window. Only the window position
     is stored, not the position of the icons.

     All: Snapshots the full layout of the currntly active
     window including the positions of all the icons
     within. This function effectively does a Select All
     followed by a Snapshot Icons plus SnapShot Window.

 UN-SNAPSHOT

 Cancels the snapshot position of the selected icon or icons. The next
time you run Opus 5, the icons will be repositioned automatically.

 LEAVE OUT

 Moves the selected file from a Lister onto the Opus 5 Main Window for
easy access. Files and directories left out in this manner will appear in
the Main Window next time you run Opus 5. Note that the actual file is
not moved from its original directory, Opus 5 only stores a reference to
the file.

 Files may be temporarily left out on the Opus 5 main window. To position
a file permanently on the Opus 5 window, you must highlight the file and
select Leave Out.

 PUT AWAY

 Removes any icons which have been left out on the Opus 5 main window.

 SELECT ALL

 Selects all the icons on the Opus 5 Main Window. This gives you an easy
method of snapshotting all the icon positions at once. Once you have
selected all the icons, use Snapshot from the icon menu to save the
positions.

 PAGE 50

 When you have multiple icons selected, holding down SHIFT key and
selecting any icon with the mouse allows you to pick up and drag all the
selections as one.

 CLEAN UP

 Attempts to adjust the position of all the icons in the Opus 5 Main
Window to their optimal positions within the confines of the window
dimensions.

 RESET

 Resets all the icon positions to those currently stored in the icon
itself from the last snapshot operation.

 RENAME

 Provides the option to rename the elected icons

 FORMAT DISK

 Displays the Opus 5 Format Requester and allows you to format disks. (See
The Format Requester on page 117 for more details.)

 DISK INFORMATION

 Displays some information about the disk the active directory resides on,
including space used and free, date stamp and number of errors on the
disk.

 PROGRAM GROUPS

 A unique feature of Opus 5 is the ability to create Program Groups;
pseudo-directories in which you place a reference to commonly used
applications, Instead of having to leave out these favourite programs
on the main window, or search through multiple them easily by opening that
group.

 PAGE 51

 For example, you could create a GROUP Called 'Graphics' and store in it
programs such as DPaint, Brilliance, Photogenics and so on.

     New: Creates a new program group under the
     name you specify.

     Delete: Deletes a program group and its contents.

     Remove Program: Removes the highlighted item
     from the opened program group.

 To place an application in a particular Group, open the group window,
open an Opus 5 Lister showing the original application directory and drag
and drop the application icon into the Group window.

 Not all icons may be placed into a Group drawer. If a file does not have
an associated TOOL or PROJECT icon, it cannot be placed in a Group drawer.
Also, you cannot place other drawers in a group drawer.

 To snapshot all the icons in a Group window, arrange the window and the
icons as you wish (maybe use the menu Icons/CleanUp), then select
Icons/Snapshot to save the positions of the icons within the window. Then,
select the Group Icon itself and select Icons/SnapShot to preserve the
position of the window itself.

 PAGE 53

 THE BUTTONS MENU

 NEW

 Creates a new Button Bank for either Text or Graphic buttons. When first
opened, the button bank will have only one button. The size of the button
bank and the definitions for each button may be changed by calling the
Button Editor.

 LOAD

 Loads an old Button Bank from disk, The loaded bank will appear on the
screen in the position last saved with the button bank, or in the position
it was in when you saved the Environment settings.

 SAVE

 Saves the selected Button Bank to disk using the name under which it was
loaded.

 SAVE AS

 Saves the selected Button Bank to disk under the name you specify.

 CLOSE

 Closes the currently active (selected) Button Bank

 EDIT

 Displays the Button Editor and allows you to edit the definitions of all
buttons in all Button Banks currently open. You can readily edit several
Button Banks at once.

 While the Button Editor is open, the buttons cannot be used as normal
function buttons.

 PAGE 53

 THE SETTINGS MENU

 CLOCK

 Toggles the display of a clock in the Opus 5 main window title bar.

 CREATE ICONS

 When Opus 5 creates a new directory, this option toggles whether Opus 5
will create the associated icon or `.info' file as well.

 RECURSIVE FILTER

 Toggles the filter option. If the Recursive Filter is enabled, Directory
Opus 5 will prompt you for an which operates recursively on files within
sub-directories. If you enter a file pattern, only files matching that
pattern will be operated upon. For matching that pattern will be operated
upon. For example, you could select a group of directories and delete only
files within those directories ending in ".o" by entering "#?.o" as the
file pattern.

 With this option turned off, all files within selected sub- directories
will be acted upon.

 Commands affected by the recursive filter are


     Copy
     Copy As
     Move
     MoveAs
     FindFile

 PAGE 54

 ENVIRONMENT

 The Environment provides user control over the visual elements of the
Directory Opus 5 display. It holds information on such things as the
screen display mode and backdrop pattern options, the colours and default
format used globally for Lister displays, the user selected colours and
other items.

 The environment also keeps track of all the other settings used to make
up the current display. This includes the current settings for

    Options (Menu Settings / Options)
    Listers - the position and formats of Listers
    Lister toolbar definition
    Lister user menu definitions
    Global user menu definitions
    Button Banks currently loaded

 When an Environment is saved, all current and saved positional
information will also be stored in the file if the Save Layout option is
checked.

 The actual items such as Button Banks, Lister Toolbar and so on are not
actually stored in the Environment file. Only a reference to the items by
file name is stored in the Environment file itself When you load a
different Environment, it sets the display to the new values then attempts
to load other elements of the display by reference to their file names.
if, for some reason you rename or delete an item such as a Button Bank,
outside of the Opus 5 references this item, opus 5 will not be able to
find this element.

 PAGE 55

 If no custom Environment has been specifically saved, when Opus 5 is
first run, it will attempt to load the following settings files as the
system, defaults

    Dopus5:Environment/Default
    DopuS5;Settings/Default
    Dopus5;Buttons/Toolbar
    DopuS5:Buttons/Lister Menu
    Dopus5:Buttons/User Menu

 and any file types defined in DOpus5:Filetypes

 EDIT

 Displays the Environment Editor which allows you to change the visual
display characteristics used by Opus
 5. (See The Environment Editor on page 61.)

 LOAD

 Loads an Environment file from disk and resets the
 visual display of Opus 5 to that defined therein.

*************************************************************************
 Load Environment resets the screenmode to that as defined in the stored
file. If the stored environment uses a screenmode of Workbench:Clone, the
Opus 5 screen will be changed to clone your current workbench screen. If
this is not the same as when you saved this environment, Opus 5 will
adjust the positions of Lister, buttons, and left out icons automatically
to fit this new (current) screen size.
**************************************************************************

 SAVE

 Saves the selected Environment using the name under which it was loaded.
If no Environment had been loaded, Save will save the current Environment
under the name 'Default'.

 PAGE 56

 SAVE AS

 Saves the current Environment to disk under the name you specify.

 SAVE LAYOUT?

 When checked, the current layout of all file Listers and Button Banks on
the screen will also be saved along with the environment.

 OPTIONS

 The Options settings provide control over the various operation commands
and associated behaviour provided by Directory Opus 5. These functions and
commands include Caching, Copy, Delete, Hide Method (lconify), Icons,
Locale and special Lister format for specific directory paths.

 EDIT

 Displays the Options Editor which allows you to change the operational
modes of Opus 5 commands and other details. (See the Options Editor on
page 67 for more details.)

 LOAD

 Loads an Options file from disk and resets the operation of Opus 5 to
that defined therein.

 SAVE

 Saves the selected Options settings using the name under which it was
loaded. If no Options file had been loaded, Save will save the current
Option settings under the name 'Default'.

 PAGE 57

 SAVE AS

 Saves the current Options settings to disk under the name you specify.

 FILE TYPES

 Displays the FileType Manager which shows the currently known FileTypes
and allows you to edit the Filetype definitions, events and actions. (See
page 99.)

 USER MENU

 Displays the Menu Editor which allows you to edit, delete and define new
menus for the global User menu.

 THE USER MENU

 The User menu may be configured to use any of the internal Directory Opus
5 commands or any calls to other functions you may wish to use. (See the
menu Editor on page 140 for details.)

 Directory Opus 5 comes shipped with a default set of user menus. We
strongly urge you look at these supplied menus from the Menu Editor. This
will help you learn how to add your own selections.

 The actual default user menu shipped with Opus 5 may change from time to
time. Some of the default menus may include

     Format: Calls the internal command Format. It
     displays the Opus 5 Format requester which allows you
     easily format new or old disks. (See the Format
     Requester on page 117 for details.)

 PAGE 58

     DiskCopy: Calls the internal command Diskcop
     which displays the Opus 5 Disk Copy Requester to permit
     you to make copies of your disks. (See the Diskcopy
     Requester on page 115 for details.)

     Device List: Calls the internal command Devicelist. It
     displays the current device list in the current SRCE
     Lister or opens a new window if required.

     Cache List: Calls the internal command Cachelist. It
     currently defined SRCE Lister or opens a new window
     if required.

     LHA Add: LHA View and LHA extract: These menus
     use AmigaDOS calls to the LHA program to perform
     the respective functions.


 The LHA program itself is not supplied with Directory Opus 5 and must be
installed in your system for these Options to work correctly. Because they
are Shareware, archive programs such as ARC, ZOO and LHA are not included
on the Directory Opus 5 distribution disk. They are available free on most
bulletin boards.

 THE ENVIRONMENT EDITOR

 The Environment provides user control over the visual display elements of
the Directory Opus 5 display. This includes the Display Mode, Display
Options, Layout of the file Listers, Colour Palette and more.

 See Fig 6-1 Environment Requester

  PAGE 61

 DISPLAY MODE

 The screen Display Mode requester allows you to specify the mode, size
and depth of the Directory Opus 5 screen. It displays the list of the
available display modes. The modes available will vary depending Upon the
version of your Amiga Operating System and the monitors currently active
in your system.

 The characteristics of the selected Display mode are shown at the bottom
of the screen.

 There are two special items on the list:-

 See Fig 6-2 Display mode Requester

     Workbench:Use Causes Directory Opus 5 to open a window on the
     Workbench screen and not to open a custom screen. The width and
     height of this window, may be changed, but the number of colours is
     fixed at the current Workbench depth.

     Workbench:Clone Causes Directory Opus 5 to open a screen in the same
     mode and exactly the same size as the Workbench screen. The size of
     this screen cannot be changed, but you may modify the number of
     colours,

 PAGE 62

     Width: This field allows you to specify the screen width.

     Weight: This field allows you to specify the screen height.

     Default: When this button is checked, the width or height field can
     not be changed and the field will display the default value. Un-check
     this button to edit the field. When you are using Workbench:Clone,
     the Default button cannot be deselected.

     Colours: Select the screen depth.

 DISPLAY OPTIONS

 Allows you to define whether to use backdrop pattern on the Opus 5 Screen
plus Workbench Application functions.

 See Fig 6-3 Backdrop Pattern Requester

 The Backdrop Pattern tells Opus 5 to use the screen backdrop pattern as
defined  in the preferences file defined in the Prefs: string below.

 The Workbench Emulation allows Opus 5 to intercept Some of the system
calls to Workbench to provide the same functionality. The options are :-

     Display Applcons: Tells Opus 5 to display all
     application icons in the Opus 5 window.

     Display Tools Menu: Tells Opus 5 to add any
     WorkBench Application Menus to a global 'Tools'
      menu.

 PAGE 63

 LISTER DISPLAY

 This allows you to choose the default values for Colours, font and format
for the Opus 5 Listers.

 See Fig 6-4 Lister Elements Requester

 Lister Elements: Select the item then select the foreground and
background colours as desired.

 Select Font: From a font requester you may select the font and size you
wish to be used in the Lister display. The font selected will be used to
display all the elements in the Lister  display. Only one font can be used
in a Lister.

 Default Format: From the List Format requester, you may select the
default format you wish to be used whenever a new Lister is opened.

 OUTPUT WINDOW

 This allows you to set the title and size of the Output Window used by
Opus 5 to display CLI tasks and associated messages. To adjust the size,
click on the Set button and adjust the position and size of the window as
required, then close the window with the close window button.

 PALETTE

 The Palette displays the current colours used by the Opus 5 screen plus
any User Colours available.

 See Fig 6-5 Palette Requester

 On its own screen, the display will show up to 16 colours depending on
the chosen screen depth. The first eight colours displayed are the Amiga
OS colours, the bottom four and top four colours from your Workbench
palette Depending on the screen depth, you may also have up to eight user
colours.

 When on Workbench, only the user colours are displayed. The actual screen
colours are determined from Workbench.

 USER COLOURS

 The User Colours system provides a mechanism to make the management of
colours practical and useful under V39 of the Amiga OS. (V37 is slightly
different but Opus 5 provides similar functionality.)

 With the pen allocation system of V39, it is possible to have your own
colours even when running on another program's (or the Workbench) screen.
The User Colour systems allows you to define up to 8 colours which Opus 5
will attempt to allocate. You may use these on custom buttons and as the
colour of Lister elements.

 You can choose how many pens to allocate, from zero to eight. If you
limit your choice to only those pens you actually need, all others are
left for other programs.

 PAGE 65

 As well as the optional User Colours, you always have the standard Amiga
OS colours to use (4 colours under OS V37, 8 under V39).

 You can specify the desired number of user colours with the slider
gadget. Once you have changed the number to what you want you need to
select "Use". The opus 5 window (and screen) will be closed and re-opened,
and the new number of pens will be allocated (if possible).

 Note that you can only change the colours of these pens if they were
successfully allocated. If you slide the RGB sliders and nothing seems to
happen, that's because there were no shareable pens available for Opus 5
to use.

 Also note that you cannot have any User Colours unless your screen is at
least 16 colours (8 under V37), as the Amiga OS grabs the top and bottom
four colours for itself.

 THE OPTIONS EDITOR

 While the Environment controls the Opus 5 visual display elements, the
Options settings provide control over the operation commands. These
functions a re:-

 CACHING

 For speed of operation, Opus 5 can internally buffer each directory list.
This is known as the Directory Cache.

 See Fig 7-1 Options Requester

 Maximum number of dirs cached: Specify the number of internal buffers to
be allocated for directories. You may use any value from one to 255.

 Disable directory caching: When selected, this turns off directory
caching.

 PAGE 67

 Re-read modified caches: When this option is selected, each cached
directory is monitored. If the contents of a cached directory have changed
when it is next activated, Opus 5 will re-read the directory.

 COPY

 This controls the actions taken when Opus 5 copies files.

 See Fig 7-2 Copy Requester

 Check destination free space: If this option is checked, Opus 5 will
check the destination directory to ensure that there is enough free space
in it to hold the selected files and/or directories to be copied. If there
is not enough space to fit all the files in the destination directory, you
will be alerted and given the option of abandoning the Copy process.

 Update destination free space: Once the copy has finished, this option
causes Opus 5 to recalculate the free space remaining on the destination
drive.

 Set source archive bit: After Opus 5 copies a file, the archive bit of
the original file will be set if this option is checked. This action can
be used to indicate that the file had been archived.

 Also copy source's: These flags tell Opus 5 that when it copies a file,
it must also copy these parts of the file information as well. You may
select all, none, or any combination of these options.

 PAGE 68

 DELETE

 Major warning messages can be provided when deleting files and
directories. Select as required.

 See Fig 7-3 Delete Requester

 Commencing delete: Tells Opus 5 to check with you before actually
starting to delete. This is a very useful option because it's always
better to be safe than sorry.

 See Fig 7-4 Warning Requester

 Deleting files: Tells Opus 5 to ask for confirmation before deleting
every file.

 Deleting directories: Tells Opus 5 to ask for confirmation before
deleting directories.

 PAGE 69

 HIDE METHOD

 These options allow you to specify and Control the method Opus 5 will use
to iconify itself.

 See Fig 7-5 Hide Requester

 Clock: Opus 5 will iconify to a one line clock display window on
Workbench. To un-iconify the window, simply activate it by clicking on it
with the left mouse button, then press the right mouse button.

 Hotkey Only: Opus 5 will close all windows and not place any visual
indication on the Workbench screen. To un- iconify, press the hotkey
combination. This is set in the ToolType of the Directory Opus icon. By
default, it is set of the left-Alt, left-SHIFT and CTRL key combination.

 The hotkey combination is always active, even when Opus 5 is not
iconified.

 Pressing the hotkeys will have the following effects

     * If Directory Opus 5 is iconified, it will be un-iconified.

     * If the Directory Opus 5 screen is open, but at the
       back of the display, it will be brought to the front.

     * If the screen has been pulled down using the
       screen drag bar, it will be brought to the top.

     * If the screen is already at the front of the display
       it will be moved to the back.

 PAGE 70

 AppIcon (Workbench Only): Opus 5 will open an icon on Workbench. Simply
double click on the icon to un-iconify it. When iconified as an appicon,
you can drop Workbench icons on the Directory Opus 5 appIcon. This will
have the same effects as if you displayed the file in a Lister window
and double-clicked on it. For example, if you drop an IFF picture on the
appicon, it will show it.

 AppMenu (Workbench Only): Opus 5 will add a menu to The Workbench's
application `Tools` menu. To un-iconify, simply select the Directory Opus
5 Menu item

 ICONS

 These options define how Opus 5 processes files with associated icons or
`.info` files

 See Fig 7-6 Icon Requester

 Perform all actions on icons: When selected, whatever happens to a file
will happen to that file's icon as well. For instance, if you delete the
file DATA, and the file DATA.info also exists, it will be deleted too. If
you rename the file FROG to BUFFALO, then FROG.info (if it exists) will be
renamed as BUFFALO.info automatically.

 Select icons automatically: This option works in a similar way. Whenever
you select a file, its associated .info file will also be selected (if it
exists).

 PAGE 71

 LOCALE

 Directory Opus 5 uses the Amiga Locale system to al low you to use Opus 5
in a variety of countries with different languages. This is determined
automatically from the Locale options you have selected when you installed
your Amiga OS and Workbench. Opus 5 also provides some extra Control over
the display of certain strings of data.

 See Fig 7-7 Date Requester

 Date Format: These options control the way Directory Opus 5 formats
dates. The Amiga's operating system uses the first setting (DD-MMM-YY) by
default, but you may choose whichever one you prefer.

 Misc. flags ...

     Name substitution: Causes words like Today,
     Tomorrow or Tuesday to be substituted for a date, if
     appropriate.

     12 hour clock: Choose whether the clock format
     used by Directory Opus 5 is displayed in 12 hour or
     24 hour format.

     Thousands seperator: Determines whether
     number have a separator between thousands. The
     character is determined from the current languages
     You have selected from the Workbench Locale
     installation.

 PAGE 72

 PATH FORMATS

 These options allow you to customise the Lister display format for
specific directories. For example, you may wish normal directories to be
sorted in file name order, but with a telecommunications 'Downloads'
directory, you may wish to see the latest files you have received. Here
you could specify the Lister display format to show files by file
date in reverse order.

 See Fig 7-8 Paths Requester

 Path: Allows you to enter the full path to the directory. Alternatively,
select the folder button immediately to the left of the string field to
display a file requester where you may select the path directly.

 Key: Allows you to enter a special hotkey definition using combination of
Alt, SHIFT, Ctrl and normal keys. When pressed, the hotkey combination
will read this special directory into the currently active Lister and
display it using the pre-defined special format.

 Add: Adds a new blank entry to the path list and allows you to enter the
details for a new directory.

 Remove: Removes the highlighted entry line from the stored list.

 Edit: Displays the Lister Format Requester allowing you to change the
stored special format for the highlighted directory.

                            CHAPTER EIGHT

 CUSTOM BUTTON BANKS


 With Directory Opus 5 you can create your own custom buttons which
execute your desired commands at the click of the mouse. Buttons are
grouped together in a window called a Button Bank. Any given bank of
buttons may show either graphical images or text, but you may not mix
graphics and text in the one bank. You may have as many banks open at any
one time as you desire.


 The modular design of Opus 5 means that Buttons Banks are fully
independent tasks and the buttons themselves are interchangeable between
different banks. Even editing of button banks via the Button Editor is
independent of other program operations, so you do not need to stop other
activities to create, load, edit or save banks.


 Each button can execute an unlimited set of instructions, or right mouse
click on the custom button. instructions may include any mix of AmigaDos,
Workbench, Arexx, Script or internal Opus 5 commands.

 Right mouse button commands are indicated by a "dog-ear" in the upper
right of the button. For middle mouse button commands, the 'dog-ear'
appears on the bottom left. This also applies to graphical Button Banks.

 SCOPE AND FOCUS OF BUTTONS

 Many button commands act on the selected files in the current source
(SRCE) directory, or between the Source and destination (DEST)
directories, When creating and using buttons, it is very important that
you understand both what the Command does, and what files and directories
it will effect. This is known as the scope and focus of a button.

 Novice Opus 5 users can be confused when they have clicked on a custom
button and nothing happens. Often they have no SRCE window selected!

*************************************************************************
 Before clicking On a custom button, verify that the intended
 SRCE and DEST directory windows are set correctly.

                         INTERNAL OPUS 5 COMMANDS


 As already explained, each button can execute set of instructions
including AmigaDos, Workbench, ARexx, Script or internal Opus 5 commands.
The list of internal commands which Directory Opus 5 offers for each
custom Button or Menu is shown below. Each command is discussed in detail
in the following section.

 AddIcon     Delete         GetSizes         Parent     Show

 ALL

 Selects all entries in any and all of the current SRCE directory Windows,

 TOGGLE

 Causes selected entries in all SRCE directories to be deselected and
deselected entries to be selected, This Command is often used as a
Complementary right mouse button action for a button using the All
Command, The right mouse button would then Toggle or reverse the state
of all entries,

 NONE

 Desclects all entries in the current SRCE directory windows.

 PARENT

 Reads and displays the parent directory of the current directory open in
the SRCE directory window. If the parent directory is Contained in Opus
5's cached buffer list, it will be displayed without re-reading it.

 When the current directory is an assignment, for example, C:, the
assignment will be expanded to the full path (SYS:C),, wherby the parent
command will move to the parent directory (SYS:) of the assigned
directory.

 This command acts on the first SRCE directory only.

 ROOT

 Reads the root directory of the SRCE directory window. As with the Parent
command, the buffer list will be searched before the parent directory is
re-read.

 When the current directory is an assigned directory, the

 PAGE 77

 Root command will display the root drive of the assigned directory. When
the current directory is a subdirectory to an assigned directory, the Root
command will display the assigned directory.

 This command acts On the first SRCE directory only,

 COPY   NAME/K, TO/F

 Copies the selected file from the SRCE directory to the DEST directory.

 If any directories are selected to be copied, the global setting of the
Recursive Filter will be used to determine which files will be copied. See
Global Menus Settings/Recursive Filter for more details.

 If multiple SRCE or multiple DEST directories are selected, the copy
command will copy all selected items from the SRCE directories to all the
DEST directories in turn.

 COPYAS NAME/K,NEWNAME/K,TO/F

 Is similar to Copy except that the entries are copied to the DEST
directory using new names that you specify. Wildcards can be used here:
consult your AmigaDOSS manual for standard wildcard usage.

 See Fig 8-1 Opus 5 Requester

 If any directories are selected to copy, the Recursive Filter will be
used to determine which files will be copied.

 Copies Multiple SCRE to DEST directories if more than one is selected.

 PAGE 79

 MOVE NAME/K, TO/F

 Moves all selected entries from the SCRe directory to the DEST directory,
The entry will no longer exist in its original place.

 If any directories are selected to move, the ReCursive Filter will be
used to deterine which files will be copied.

 If the Move operation is on the same device, Opus 5 actually uses the
Rename command, On different devices, Copy and Delete commands are used.

*************************************************************************
 Be careful with this command!. Opus 5 will delete the file
 if you are moving it to a different device.
*************************************************************************

 Move acts to move files to a single destination ONLY .

 MOVEAS NAME/K, NEWNAME/K, TO/F

 Performs the same command as Move but allows you to give each entry a new
name before it is moved.

 MoveAs acts to move files to single destination ONLY .

 RENAME

 Allows you to give new names to all selected entries in the currently
selected SRCE directory windows. A requester will appear for each entry in
turn, asking for the new name. one. You will usually just edit the name in
the lower of the two to the new name.

 A limited type of wildcard rename is possible. Entering an '*' in the
bottom field allows you to add prefixes or suffixes. For instance,
entering '*.pic' will add a '.pic' suffix to all selected entries.
Entering 'A*' will add an 'A' prefix. Only one '*' may be used in this
process.

 PAGE 79

 You cannot give a file a name that contains an '*'.

 If you enter an '*' in the top as well as the bottom field, you can
replace sections of the name. for example, entering '*.pic' in the top
field and '*.iff' in the bottom field will replace the '.pic' suffix of
any entries with the '.iff' suffix. If an entry does not have a '.pic'
suffix, it will be left untouched. The '*' may also be embedded. For
instance, renaming 'FOO*BAZ' as 'GEE*WlZ' would rename 'FOOBARBAZ' to
'GEEBARWIZ'. Again, only one '*' may be used in each of the string Fields.

 The Rename command works on ALL SRCE Listers in turn.

 DUPLICATE NAME/K, NEWNAME/K

 Allows you to make a copy of selected entries in the same directory, but
with different names. A requester will appear for each entry, asking for
the new name.

 The Duplicate command works on ALL SRCE Listers.

 DELETE NAME/F

 Deletes all the selected entries in ALL currently defined SRCE Listers.

 Be careful with this, as it is easy to wipe out valuable data if you are
careless. Directory Opus 5's default configuration brings up a requester
before deleting files. Nevertheless, you should always double check the
selected files before clicking any button which uses this command.

 The Delete command works on ALL SCRE Listers in turn.

 MAKEDIR  NAME/K,NOICONS/S

 Allows you to create a new subdirectory in the SCRE directory window; its
name is limited to 30 characters.

 PAGE 80

 See Fig 8-2 Opus 5 Requester

 From the displayed requester, you can choose whether to create an icon
along with the new directory or not. Entering a name and just pressing
RETURN, will either create an icon, or not, according to the status of the
global Setting menu, Create Icons. The name of the directory is limited to
25 characters if Create Icons is enabled.

 If the optional NAME is used, the command will not ask for the directory
name, but will make it immediately in the command SCRE directory.

 If the optional NOICON switch is used, the directory will be made without
an associated '.info' file. Otherwise, the command obeys the global Create
Icons setting.

 MakeDir works on the first directory ONLY.

 CHECKFIT

 Tests whether the selected files will fit on the destination drive. A
requester displays the number of bytes needed, the available space, and
the percentage of files which will fit on the destination drive.

 CheckFit works between ALL SRCE directories to the first DEST directory
ONLY.

 GETSIZES

 Causes any selected subdirectories in ALL SRCE Listers to be scanned. The
scanning process calculates the total size, in bytes, of all files
contained in the subdirectory. Once scanned, the subdirectory will be
displayed.

 PAGE 81

 If a subdirectory has been previously scanned, it will not be rescanned
when you select the GetSizes button. See ClearSizes below.

 The GetSizes button also displays in the status bar the number of files,
directories and bytes that have been selected out of the total number of
files, directories and bytes. If there is enough space for the total
selected bytes on the disk in the destination directory window, all
selected files would fit on the destination disk if they were Copied,
and a 'Y' will be displayed after the count. If they won't fit, a 'N' will
be displayed.

 If you select an operation which causes a subdirectory to be scanned
(e.g., Copy, Protect, FindFile, etc.), the size will be displayed as
though you had performed a GetSizes.

 GetSizes works On ALL SRCE Listers in turn.

 CLEARSIZES

 Clears the sizes for selected directories in all SRCE Listers, but not
for selected files.

 If a subdirectory has been scanned already, GetSizes will not work. It is
possible that a previously scanned directory's size is no longer accurate
since any application, including Opus 5, might have changed the contents
of the subdirectory since it was last scanned. To rescan a subdirectory,
the size must be cleared with ClearSizes.

 FindFile

 Searches all selected subdirectories in all SCRE Listers for a specified
file or files.

 See Fig 8-3 Opus 5 Requester

 PAGE 82

 A requester will appear asking for the pattern to search for. You can use
full pattern matching for this search.

 If a file matching the pattern is found, you are asked if you wish to
enter the directory containing it, or to continue the search. If you elect
to enter the directory, the directory will be read and all matching
enteries will be highlighted.

 SEARCH

 Searches the contents of all selected files in all SCRE Listers, and the
files within selected directories, for a specified string. A requester
will appear, asking for the string to search for.

 See Fig 8-4 Text String Requester

 There are also several options available within the requester.

     Case insensitive: When checked, any upper and lowercase letters are
     treated as the same.

     Wildcard search: When checked, you can to use a question mark (?)
     character as a limited wildcard, to mean "match any character".

     Match whole words: When checked, the string you enter must be matched
     in a whole word (if the string is embedded within a longer string it
     will not be matched).

 PAGE 83

 You can specify how the results of the search are presented to you.

     Ask: If a match is found, Opus 5 will ask whether you wish to read
     the file. If selected to do so, the text viewer will be opened and
     the file will be read automatically.

     Leave selected: If enabled, any files that contain the matching
     string will be left highlighted. All files that did not match will be
     deselected, enabling you to see quickly the files that contained a
     match.

     Output results: If enabled, the names of files that contained the
     matching string will be written to a temporary file. Once the search
     has finished, this temporary file will be displayed in the text
     viewer.


 RUN NAME/F

 Runs each selected file in turn, providing that the file is an executable
program. The action is similar to double- clicking on the file's icon, or
running it from the CLI. A requester will appear, asking for any arguments
(should you require any).

*************************************************************************
 Directory Opus 5 does not provide an 'Execute' command This function is
handled by the Run command which functions in the same manner as the
AmigaDOS 'run' command if a file has the 's' (script bit set, the run
command will execute it as a script,
