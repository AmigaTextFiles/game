HAM RAMPING

When  you  paint in HAM, any colours that are not in your Palette (group
"a"  of the colours below the Toolbox; see Note above), are displayed on
the  screen by copying the colour in the pixel to the left and modifying
one  of  the  RGB  components  of  the  colour  (You'll find a technical
explanation  of  how  this  is accomplished in Appendix D).  Because HAM
mode can change only one of the colour components at a time, it can take
up  to  three  pixels to reach the colour you really want to paint with.
This  transition  from one colour to the next is called a "ramp".  Let's
take a look at an example.

Choose the largest square built in brush and the Freehand tool.

Press P to display the Arrange Palette Colour Panel.

In  the Mixer, COPY colour 0 (black) to colour 15 (lavender).  Now click
SPREAD  and spread between the two blacks.  This will change all of your
palette colours black.

AGA  users  can copy colour 0 to colour 63 and do a spread between these
two colours.

Click  on white in your colour set, paint a filled square on the screen,
and press m to magnify it.

You should see that your white square has a ramp on the left side.  From
black  the colour changes to green, then to yellow and finally to white.
The  ramp  required  three pixels to reach white because the change from
black  to  white  requires  a  modification  to  each of the R, G, and B
components of the colour, and there are no intermediate colours.

If  there  were an intermediary colour in the palette, the ramp might be
accomplished  in more or less than three pixels and result in a smoother
transition from black to white.  Let's look at an example:

Choose Palette>Default Palette from the Colour menu.

Now  you  are  back  to the standard HAM palette.  This palette contains
some  intermediate  greys and an assortment of colours spaced throughout
the colour cube.

Click  on  color 16 or choose a white that is not in the palette.  Paint
another  square  on the magnified screen.  (AGA users can choose a white
in the colour set).

Notice  that  this  time the ramp is four pixels across, but the colours
used  in  the ramp are much closer to the target colour of white, so the
ramp is not as noticeable.  Deluxe Paint chose a colour from the palette
to  start  its ramp with.  The colour it chose is colour 3, which has an
RGB value of 13, 13, 13, very close to white.  When Deluxe Paint chooses
a  colour from the palette to begin a ramp, it searches the palette from
the  left  and  chooses  the  first  colour  that is acceptable.  And to
determine  which  colour is closest, the program compares the colours in
the palette with the colour you are painting with.

So  far  we've  been showing you what happens to the HAM colour that you
are  painting  down  and  how  Deluxe Paint ramps to create that colour.
Keep  in  mind,  however that if the colour you are painting ON is a HAM
colour,  the  program  will have to compute a ramp to create that colour
also,  so  you  will  see  a ramp on the right side of your brush.  When
Deluxe  Paint  creates  this ramp, priority is given to the brush colour
when selecting a colour from the palette to begin a ramp.

When  you  paint with a HAM colour using the single pixel brush, you are
actually  painting  with the closest colour that the program can ramp to
in  a  single  pixel.  If you need to do detail work, you should put the
colours for the fine details in the palette (the first 16 colours of the
colour set, or 64 in AGA HAM8 mode).

The  construction of a useful palette is an important part of successful
painting in HAM.  With a little experience, you'll find the palette that
works best for you.

COMBINING IMAGES

If you plan to combine images in HAM by loading in custom brushes, it is
best  to create all of the separate images using the same palette.  This
is  especially true if you are using HAM animbrushes to be combined with
a HAM background.

We  included  a  HAM  background  (Aquarium  Background)   and   two HAM
animbrushes  (AngelFish  and  BettaFish) on the Examples disk for you to
experiment with.  These images all use the same palette, so they combine
fairly  well.    Load  the background image and create frames to use the
anim-  brushes against the background.  The brushes look especially good
when stamped with Translucency set to 30 percent.

When  you load a 32 colour or higher brush into a HAM picture, the brush
is  automatically  remapped  to use the current picture's palette so the
brush  will immediately look correct on the screen.  The brush's palette
is  also  loaded  intact, so you can choose Palette>Use Brush Palette if
you  want  to use the brush palette.  Then load the brush again to remap
to the brush palette.

When  you load a brush that is 16 colours or less into HAM, the brush is
not  remapped.   You can choose to either use the brush palette or remap
the brush.

Remember  that  DeluxePaint  V loads and saves palettes and colour sets.
This  should make it much easier and faster for you to combine palettes.


HAM Fringing

Fast Adjust
Sometimes  when  you  are  moving a brush on the screen in HAM mode, you
will  see fringe on the right side of your brush.  This happens when the
colours  in the picture are HAM colours, that is, not from the 16 colour
palette.    Deluxe  Paint attempts to correct the fringing when you hold
the  brush  still  so  that you can see how the image will actually look
when you stamp down the brush.  If you turn off the FastAdjust option in
the Prefs menu (this option in ON by default), Deluxe Paint will attempt
to  correct the fringing effect even when you are moving the brush.  The
advantage  is  that  your brush will always look its best, but the brush
will also move more slowly when you move it around on the screen.

Recompute
HAM  Fringing  will  be  espccially noticeable when you load images from
some other programs that support HAM.  If you load an image from another
program  and  find that the fringing effect along the right side of your
brush  is  severe, choose the Recompute option in the Colour menu.  This
option  remaps the picture to its own palette to eliminate the fringing.

Changing a Pictures Colours in HAM
Many  artists  are accustomed to adjusting the colours in their image by
changing  the  RGB  values  of  the  colour  in  the  palette  and  thus
automatically  changing  all  instances  of  the  colour in the picture.
Since  HAM  colours  are  not  tied  to the palette, you cannot directly
change  them  by  changing the RGB values.  You can, however, change the
colours  globally  with  the BG>FG option in thc Colour menu.  Here's an
example of how to do it:

Choose Palette>Default Palette from the Colour menu

If it is not already displayed, press p to display the Colour Mixer

Click on an empty colour slot in the Mixer

If  there are no empty slots, create some using the Delete button in the
Mixer.  Make sure the empty slots you create are not one of the first 16
colours

Change the RGB slider settings to 12, 13, 0, (AGA users: 63, 53, 0)

This  should  produce  a bright yellow colour that is slightly different
from  the  yellow in the palette.  Because it is not one of the first 16
colours,  it is a HAM colour.  Paint on the screen with this new yellow.


Click  on  another empty slot in the Mixer and change the RGB sliders to
15,  3,  4,  (AGA  users:  63, 6, 8,).  This should produce a bright red
colour.

With  the  right mouse button, click on the yellow colour you created to
make it your current background colour.

At  this point the Colour Indicator in the Colour Mixer should show that
your  foreground  colour  is  bright  red  and your background colour is
bright  yellow.    You  should  also  have  some  of  the  bright yellow
background  colour  painting  in  your picture.  In the next step, we'll
change the yellow colour in your picture to the red colour.

Choose BG>FG from the Colour menu

After  a few moments, Deluxe Paint repaints your picture with all of the
yellow turned to red.

The  BG>FG  option changes every instance in the picture of your current
background colour into the current foreground colour.  In our particular
case  this meant that every pixel in the picture that had the RGB values
15 3, 4 (yellow) changed to the foreground colour (red).

As  you  saw  it  takes a moment for Deluxe Paint to search through your
image  to change all of the pixel colours, but it performs this function
much more rapidly than you ever could.

Colour Processing Options

To  give  you  greater  flexibility  when  working  with  HAM  images in
particular, Deluxe Paint V includes some effects for painting.  The most
notable  of these are the Translucency and Process options in the Effect
menu.  We'd like to show you a couple of these very quickly just to give
you an idea of why they are there and how to use them.

Before you begin:

Load the picture titled Retrospective from the Examples Disk.

Translucency
The  translucency  option lets you combine a specified percenrage of the
colours in your brush with the colours in the image.  This is especially
useful  for overlaying one image on another.  Let's try a quick example.

Select  the  Brush  Selector tool and pick up the eye image in the upper
right portion of the picture as a brush

Press F10 to hide the Menu Bar and Toolbox.

Choose Translucency>On/Off from the Effect menu (or press Alt-t)

Press F9 to redisplay the Menu Bar

Notice that a T appears in the Menu Bar to tell you that Translucency is
on.

Move  the  brush over the image of the earth viewed from space and stamp
down the brush

You'll  see  Deluxe  Paint  overlay  50% of the eye image over the earth
image.    You  can  also  change  the  level of translucency by choosing
Translucency>Settings  from  the  Effect  menu  or  press Ctrl-t.  Since
Translucency  is  an  effect rather than a mode, it will also change the
way  shapes  are  painted  on  the  screen.    And,  you can combine the
Translucency  effect with any of the Process effects to exercise greater
control over the strength of the process effect.

Choose Translucency>On/Off from the Effect menu to turn Translucency off

The  Proecss  options  in  the  Effect menu let you paint with different
combinations  of  the  HSV  levels  of  your  brush.  Tint paints with a
combination  of Hue and Saturation.  Hue paints with only the hue of the
brush,  if  you're  painting  with a solid colour, this is a good way to
convert  a  colour  image  to  a  monochromatic  image as we'll see in a
moment.  Value paints with only the value of your foreground colour, and
is  a great way to add shadows or highlights to an image or even just to
lighten the image overall.  We'll take a quick look at the Hue option to
give you an idea of how the Process options work.

Choose  Process>Hue  from the Effect Menu to make it the current process
option.  Then Choose Process>On/Off to turn the Proeess option on.

A  P appears in the Menu Bar to tell you that one of the Process options
is active.

Press F10 to display the Toolbox.  Choose the light pink as your current
foreground colour.  Select the Filled Rectangle tool.

Press  F10 again to hide the Tool box.  Draw a filled rectangle over the
eye image in the upper right corner of the picture.

In a moment, the eye is painted over with pink and all of the colours in
the image are shifted to pink.  Using the Hue option does not affect the
Saturation or Value, of the colours in the image, so the resulting image
is  a  monochromatic  version of the eye.  If you want to see the effect
against the original, repeatedly press u to undo and redo the change.

As  we  mentioned  above,  the  Translucency  and Process options can be
combined.      Try  some  combinations  of options on other areas of the
picture.    For  example, try the Tint option with Translucency set to a
high number to very lightly tint an area of the picture.

Tutorial Four: Gradient Translucency

A  new  feature  of  Deluxe  Paint V allows you to create gradients with
variable  translucencies.  This feature can be used in any mode, but the
more  colours  available, the better the effect.  This effect works best
in HAM modes, 24 bit backing store mode, and if avilable, AGA modes.  To
get  a good effect in lower colour modes, create good colour spreads and
build  contiguous colour ranges.  In this tutorial you will learn how to
create  a  gradient  translucency  in HAM and how to use some of the new
features to Deluxe Paint's Range Colour Panel.

To  begin  this tutorial, please reload the Retrospective ham image from
the picture drawer of the Examples Disk.  Select Yes if the program asks
you to change modes.

Hit F10 to turn off the menus and toolbox.

Display  the  Range Colour Panel use the menu or press Ctrl-r to display
it.

If  there  is a range already defined for range 1, click CLEAR to delete
it.

Select  the  yellow colour in your palette and place it on the left-most
bead of the range line.

Now that the yellow colour is selected (white outline) you can give that
colour a starting fade value/translucency.  Click on the Fade slider and
move it all the way to the right.  As you do this you will notice that a
small square bead appears below the yellow colour and changes from black
to  white  as  you  increase the fade slider.  Black is an indication of
pure  colour or opaqueness and white is an indication of no colour (100%
translucency).    The  values  range from 0 (fully opaque) to 255 (fully
translucent).    Deluxe Paint will allow you to place fade values on any
individual colour bead in your range up to 256 colours.

NOTE 
You  can  add fade values to bead positions even if there are no colours
attached  to  that  bead.   This is useful for extra customising of your
gradient translucency.  Select a bead line (it will turn white) and give
it  a  fade value You'll see that the square fade bead appears below the
bead line even though there's no colour attached.

Slide  the slider under your colour bead all the way to the right.  (The
number  at  the  right of the slider and under the pick icon should read
224;  this  indicates  the  bead number that is at the right edge of the
bead line).

Select  the  red  colour  in your palette and place it on the right most
bead line.

We  don't  need  to  adjust  the  fade  value of the red colour for this
tutorial,  but if you wanted to you could.  For this tutorial lets leave
it at 0 fade.  If you click on the fade slider, you will in fact see the
black square bead appear.

We've  now created a HAM gradient that goes from a translucent yellow to
an  opaque  red.  Deluxe Paint automatically interpolates the in between
fade  values.    Click and hold the SHOW button to see what the gradient
looks  like.    You  should be able to see through of the screen and see
that it gradually gets opaque to the right.

Let's  do  a  gradient  fill  to see what it looks like combined over an
image.

Click  OK  to  close  the range requester, then press F10 to display the
menu bar and Toolbox.

Press F (Shift-f) or right click on the fill tool in the Toolbox

The Fill requester should have range 1 as its current range.

Choose the Hi button and Smooth Dither and click OK.

Press C (Shift-c) or choose the Filled Circle tool from the Toolbox.

Draw  a circle over the little girls head in the Retrospective.ham image
to give her a space helmet.

Experiment  with the gradient translucency effect.  It's a very powerful
feature  and  can  be  combined  with  lots of different features within
Deluxe Paint V.

This section covered only a small part of the world of HAM painting.  We
hope  that  the  ideas we've presented here helped you better understand
HAM mode and that you'll experiment freely with the new options designed
for this mode.

Tutorial Five: The World of Stencils

In  the  following set of exercises you will learn how to create and use
stencils  within  Deluxe  Paint V.  Although stencils are primarily used
for producing quick, uniform lettering by amateur signwriters, they have
uses  that  go  far  beyond  that.    Airbrush artists, for example, use
stencils (which they call friskets) to cover certain areas of their work
while they airbrush other areas.

Deluxe Paint makes it easy to create a stencil for any part of an image,
without the need to redraw the image.  All you do is specify the colours
that  make up the stencil, and Deluxe Paint does the rest, no matter how
intricate the image.

Here's  how  it  works:  when you make a stencil for a particuiar set of
colours,  you  lock (and thus protect) any parts of the picture that are
made up of those colours.  This means that when you have a stencil for a
particular set of colours, you cannot paint over those colours until you
turn  the  stencil  off.  It also means that you can essentially paint a
picture  backwards,  from  the foreground to the background, because you
can use stencils to mask any foreground objects from the colours you are
using for the background objects.

Before You Begin

Choose  Load from the Picture menu and load the picture named StencilSet
from the Picture drawer.

Click  "Yes"  when  Deluxe  Paint  asks  if  you want to change modes to
320x200 32 colours.

Distant Snowcaps

The  left  part of the StencilSet picture shows a distant mountain range
behind  a  green  field and under a colourful sky.  (If you followed the
preceding  tutorial,  you'll notice that both the sky and the field were
created  with  a  Gradient Fill, in a fraction of the time it would take
using  more  traditional  techniques).   Note that the mountain range is
actually  made up of three ranges, with the more distant ones painted in
lightest  shades  than the nearer ones.  In this exercise, we will put a
snowcap on the most distant range with out disturbing any other parts of
the  picture.   This would be a tall order for any other graphic medium,
but  is  surprisingly easy with Deluxe Paint.  Lets see how Deluxe Paint
does it:

Choose  Stencil>Make  from  the  Effect menu to display the Make Stencil
requester.    Click  Clear, click on Colour 8 (the one at the top of the
second column), click Invert, and then click Make.

With  four  simple  clicks  you  have created a stencil that locks every
colour  in  the  picture except Colour 8, the colour of the most distant
mountain  range.    The first click created the picture of any stencils,
the  second  selected  the  stencil colour, the third click inverted the
stencil configuration (making everything except Colour 8 a stencil), and
the  fourth  made  the stencil.  To let you know that you have a stencil
active, an "S" appears on the Title Bar.

Note  that  clicking  Invert  simply   inverts   the   current   stencil
configuration, saving you the trouble of clicking all the colours except
the  one  you  want to paint on.  This is useful if you want to paint on
one or two selected colours to the exclusion of the rest; if you want to
create  a  stencil  to lock only one or a few colours, you don't need to
use invert.

The next step is to paint the snow on the distant mountain range:

Press p to display the Mixer.  Change Colour 1 (the second colour in the
palette)  from  grey to white by dragging the RGB sliders all the way to
the right.

Select  white  as  the  foreground  colour and then select the one pixel
brush  and  the  Airbrush  tool.    Move  the cursor over to the distant
mountain range and spray a snowcap on it.

Because  every colour except that of the most distant mountain range has
been  locked,  you  can  spray without fear of splattering any adjoining
colours. 

Note  that  although the white you are spraying on the mountain range is
onc of the locked colors, it is not itself locked while you are applying
it.   This means that you can paint over it with another colour (such as
the  final  colour  of  the  mountain, if you don't like the look of the
snowcap) redo as though it were unlocked.
 
To  lock  a  recently  applied  colour, just select Stencil>Remake.  You
don't  need  to  display  the  Stencil  requester  again,  because   the
configuration is still as you want it.  This also means that you can use
the "Again" key (a) to update your stencil, if Remake was your last menu
command

Tip
The  Again  rule  is  simple:  press  a  whenever you want to repeat the
immediately  preceding  menu command, to save you moving the mouse up to
the  Menu  Bar  and through menu and submenu options.  If your last menu
command  produced  a  requester,  then pressing a will produce that same
requester, without the need for menu selections.

Sunrise in the Rockies

In  this exercise, we make the sun rise behind the mountains, so we need
to lock every colour except the sky.  Here's how:

Display the Make Stencil requester (Colour 8 should be the only unlocked
colour  in  the  requester).    Now  click Colour 8 to lock it, and then
click.   Colours 0 (black) and 12 through 16 (the sky colours) to unlock
them.  (Colour 12 is halfway down the second column, and Colour 16 is at
the top of the third column).  Click Make.

You have now locked every colour in the landscape except the sky colours
Now let's make the sun rise:

Choose Stencil>On/Off from the Effect menu to turn the stencil off.

In Deluxe Paint V your stencil affects picking up a brush - you can only
pick  up  areas that are not in the stencil.  Since the orange shades in
the  sun are part of the stencil, you turned off the stencil momentarily
to pick up that area of the picture.

Click  the  Brush  Selector,  move  the large cross hair over to the sun
image  (on  the  far  right  of the screen) and pick it up with the left
mouse button.  Move the brush over to the mountain range.

Choose Stencil>On/Off from the Effect menu to turn the stencil on.

Did  you  see  the sun move behind the mountains and then peek through? 
This  is because every colour except the sky colours and the back ground
is  locked,  and  so  will  not accommodate the sun brush.  When you are
satisfied  with  the placement of the sun, click to stamp an image of it
there.

Cutting some Z's

In  this  exercise  we  will  explore  further aspects of Deluxe Paint's
powerful  stencil editor.  In particular, you'll see how to turn stencil
colours on and off from any part of your picture, not just from the Make
Stencil requester.

(Display  the  Make  Stencil  requester  and  click  Clear  to clear the
stencil.   Now move the cursor outside the requester and click the large
Z  shape.    Click  Invert and then click Make to return to the painting
screen.

Did  you  notice  that when you clicked the Z the Make Stencil requester
responded  by  locking  that  colour?   This means that you can lock and
unlock  colours  directly  from  your image just by clicking them.  Note
that  clicking  with  the left mouse button adds a colour to the stencil
and  clicking  with  the  right  mouse  button deletes a colour from the
stencil.    And  to make it easy to find the colours you want to lock or
unlock,  you  can  move  the  Make  stencil requester to any part of the
screen  just  by moving the cursor to the top of the requester, pressing
the left mouse button, and dragging it to a new position.

Now let's see what we can do with the stencil we just created:

Press the ' (accent grave/tilde) key to turn off the stencil.

Pressing  ' is the same as choosing Stencil>On/Off from the Effect menu.
This  is a very important keyboard equivalent for working with stencils.

Click  the  Brush Selector and pick up the textured area to the right of
the Z.

Press ' to turn on the stencil.

Move the cursor over to the Z and watch what happens.

Did  you  see  the  textured brush appear behind the Z?  Because all the
colours  except  the  Z  are  locked,  it  looks like you're viewing the
textured  brush  through  a  Z  shaped  window.   Now when you place the
textured  brush  behind  the  Z  and click, you will fill the Z with the
textured pattern.

Fixing the Background

By  using  a  combination of stencils and fixing the background, you can
define  a  stencil  by area rather than colour.  This lets you confine a
stencil  to  a  particular area of the page, without forcing you to lock
every instance of a particular colour.  Let's take a closer look:

Make  sure  the  stencil is off and then pick up the small clump of pine
trees  from  the  right  hand  side  of the page.  From the Effect menu,
choose Background>Fix.

You  have just fixed the picture to the background (the "B" in the Title
Bar  tells you so), which means you can always return to that picture by
clicking CLR.  Thus, you can stamp pine trees all over the landscape and
then  return  to the original picture at any time.  You can also fix the
background  successively, updating the picture from the previous "fix". 
(As  we  saw  earlier,  you  can  use  the "Again" key (a) to repeat the
immediately preceding menu command).

For  the  purpose  of this exercise, go ahead and stamp at few clumps of
pine  trees in front of the closest mountain range.  Now let's turn that
collection of pine trees into a stencil:

From the Effect menu, select Background>Lock FG.

This last action turned the foreground (ie.  everything you added to the
picture  since  fixing  the  background)  into  a  stencil  but  without
affecting  any  other  part of the picture that uses those same colours.
Try  it  and  see your pine tree bush over to the pine forest and you'll
see  that your stencil goes behind the forest but in front of everything
else.    You can remove the stencil either by turning the stencil off or
making a stencil by locking colours. 

The  colour and area methods are mutually exclusive, so using one method
automatically  negates  the  other.    And  as  is the case with regular
stencils,  clicking  CLR  does  not  clear  the  stencilled area - it is
protected until you turn it off just like the fixed background.

Painting a Stencil

A  more  powerful way to define a stencil by area is to "print" it.  You
can  do  this  with  Deluxe  Paint V's Stencil>Paint option.  Painting a
stencil  can  be  invaluable  for  protecting  areas that are not easily
defined  by  colour.    In  the  next  few  steps  we'll show you how to
"cookie-cut"  an area of your image to create the first of the two logos
in the StencilSet image.

At  this  point  you should still be working with the StencilSet picture
from the exercise above.  If you still have Fixed Background active from
the previous exercise, choose Background>Free from the Effect menu.

Choose  Stencil>Make  from the Effect menu.  Click Clear and Make in the
requester to clear your stencil.

When  you  use  Stencil  Paint,  you  can  either  add  to  an  existing
colour-based  stencil  or  you  can start from scratch.  When you choose
this  option.   Deluxe Paint calculates the stencil based on the colours
that  are  selected  in the Make Stencil requester and then presents you
with  a  screen  that you can use to add or subtract areas from.  So, to
start  from  scratch, you need to clear the Make Stencil requester as we
did above.

In  the  next  few steps, you'll pick up a brush to print in the stencil
with  and turn on Stencil Paint to paint down your stencil.  Then you'll
reverse the stencil and pick up a new brush.

Click the Brush Selector tool and pick up the red, yellow and green logo
as a custom brush.

Choose Stencil>Paint from the Effect menu.

In  a  moment,  your image is dimmed and a lower case "s" appears in the
Menu Bat to show that you are in Stencil Paint mode.

Move your brush over to the mountain range so that the sunrise is in the
lower part of the circle and click with the left mouse button.

Painting  with  the left mouse button adds to the stencil (which you see
as  lighter  colours) and painting with the right mouse button subtracts
from the stencil.  By clicking down your brush, you created a stencilled
area that is the shape of the brush.  Now exit Stencil Paint and reverse
the stencil.

Choose Stencil>Paint to turn off the mode and create your stencil.

It's important to correctly turn off the Stencil Paint mode the same way
you entered it.  If you try to use other options while in Stencil Paint,
Deluxe  Paint  may  turn off the mode for you, but there is no guarantee
that in those instances it will save the changes to the stencil.  If you
think  you'll  be  using  this feature a lot, you should get used to the
keyboard equivalent: Ctrl-s.

Choose  Stencil>Reverse  to reverse your stencil so that all areas exept
the logo shaped area of the mountain range is protected.

Choose  the Brush Selector tool.  Pick up the mountain range as a brush.
And press the ' (accent grave) key to turn off the stencil.

Now  you  should  be  holding a brush like the first of the logos in the
StencilSet.

With  a  little  creativity  you  can  combine Stencil Paint and the new
gradient  fills  we  showed  you  earlier  in the chapter to create some
stunning effects.

Stencils in HAM

When  you're  working  in  HAM  or  24  bit backing store mode, the Make
Stencil  requester  is  a  bit  different  from the one you see in other
modes.  This requester doesn't attempt to show you which of the possible
colours  you  have  locked.  Instead, it gives you powerful ways to lock
colours  individually  or  based on a tolerance level.  It then lets you
view  the  stencil  as  you would by choosing Stencil>Show.  In the next
pages  we'll  take  a  quick  look  at  the features of the Make Stencil
requester in HAM mode.

Due  to  the  heavy  computational  and  memory requirements of the Make
Stencil  option  in HAM, this feature will be somewhat slow on lower-end
Amigas.   If your Amiga has no more than 2MB of RAM or 512K of Chip RAM,
we  recommend  that you use the Stencil>Paint feature to create stencils
in HAM.  However, if you are patient you might want to work through this
section: it might be just the thing for you.

Before we begin:

Choose Screen format from the file menu and change your screen format to
Lo-Res 320x200 HAM.

If you don't already have the StencilSet picture loaded, load it now and
choose NO to converting to the Screen format of the file.

Choose  Stencil>Make  from  the  Effect menu.  You'll see a Make Stencil
requester like the one in Figure 4.18.

The  Clear,  Invert,  Make  and Cancel buttons in this requester perform
essentially  the  same function as they do in the Make Stencil requester
in  other  modes.    The  important new concepts we want to show you are
Show, Fine Tune, and Tolerance.

Tolerance

The  tolerance setting lets you click on a single colour in your picture
and  simultaneously lock (or unlock) all "similar" colours in the image.
The  tolerance number determines how different a colour can be and still
be  considered  "similar"  to  the  one you clicked on.  A low Tolerance
number requires that the colours be very similar, while a high Tolerance
number  locks  colours  that  may  be very different from the colour you
clicked.    The  range  of  Tolerance  values  runs  from 0 to 48.  At 0
tolerance,  only  colours  rhat are identical to the colour you click on
will be affected.  At 48 tolerance, all colours will be affected.

TECHNICAL NOTE 
Tolerance is calculated in the RGB cube colour space.  Each increment of
tolerance  represents  a  change  of  1  on any of the RGB values of the
colour you clicked on.

To  see  how tolerance works in a practical application, we'll use it to
lock the green colours in the StencilSet image.  When you first open the
Make  Stencil  requester, Tolerance is set at 4.  We'll leave it at four
as we choose our first colour.

Move the cursor down to the bottom of the green grass area of the sunset
image and click once on the lightest green.

Click  on a colour with the left mouse button tells Deuxe Paint that you
want  to  lock  that  colour.    Notice that the colour appears in a box
beside  the  Tolerance  option and a black "lock" bracket appears beside
the  colour  to  show  that you have locked it.  You could click Make to
exit  the  requester  with your stencil, but instead, we'll use the Show
button to confirm that we locked the colours we wanted.

Click the Show check box to show your stencil.

After  a  moment  of  calculations, Deluxe Paint will dim your image and
show your stencil as lighter areas in the imagejust as if you had chosen
Show  from  the Stencil sub-menu.  You'll see that many more greens than
the  one  you  clicked  on  are  stencilled.    But  not  all greens are
stencilled,  because  your tolerance was set to only 4.  You'll also see
that  part  of  the green triangle from the Electronic Arts logo and the
green of the trees is also stencilled.

Now suppose that you actually wanted to select more greens than the ones
that were stencilled in this first attempt.  You can do this in two ways
either  click on another green that is not stencilled to lock it and all
colours  to  it or increase the tolerance setting.  Let's try the latter
method now.

Click  in  the  tolerance  edit field to the right of the number 4, back
space to delete it, and change the number to 8.  When you press Enter or
click  outside  the  requester,  Deluxe Paint automatically recalculates
your  stencil, and after a moment it shows you your stencil with the new
tolerance value.

Now you'll see that two thirds of the greens are selected in your image.

If you need to select a large area of your image quickly, high tolerance
numbers  can  help  you  a lot.  However, to get that help you sacrifice
some  control  over  which  colours  get stencilled.  Of course, you can
always  go  back  and  adjust  the  stencil with the Fine Tune option as
you'll see below.

Fine Tuning the Stencil

Now  that  you've  seen  how to add to the stencil and use the Tolerance
setting,  we'll  take  a  quick  look at fine tuning the stencil.  We're
going  to  use Fine Tune to subtract a colour from your stencil, but you
can also use Fine Tune to add colours to the stencil.

Click the Fine Tune option to turn it on.

Activate  the  screen  by left clicking on one of the greens not in your
stencil.

Move  the  cursor  over  to the middle of the stencilled grass and click
with the right mouse button to subtract a colour.

Deluxe  Paint  recalculates your stencil and shows your stencil with the
colour removed.

Fine  Tune  lets you add or subtract single colours from your locked set
without  having to change the tolerance level.  Fine Tune always adds or
substracts  only  the  colour  you  click  on,  though you are certainly
welcome to click on wharever colours you like.

Tutorial Six: Textures and Media

Deluxe  Paint  and  its  creator have always tried to bring the best and
latest  computer  graphics trends to all Amiga users.  One of the latest
trends  has  been  to  emulate  natural media printing and compositing. 
Every  major computer platform has a print program that emulates natural
media.  We are the first commercial Amiga program to bring natural media
painting  and  effects  to  all  Amiga  users, and no special additional
hardware or files are needed.  In this section you will learn how to use
textured  backgrounds,  media  libraries  and  how to best combine these
tools  with  other  Deluxe  Paint  features  to  create some interesting
natural looking artwork.

Switch Screen format to Lo Res HAM.

Load  the  file TextureMap.Lores from the Picture drawer of the Examples
disk.

Click No if the program asks you to change modes

Select Palette>Default Palette from the Colour Menu.

Your map should turn to two shades of grey and black.

Open the Ranges colour panel or press Ctrl-c

Click to range 2, then press the CLEAR button if there is a range defined.

Select the light blue colour in your palette (colour 10) and place it in
the left most bead line.

Slide the Range slider below the bead line all the way to the right.

Select the purple colour in your palette (colour 13) and place it on the
right most bead line.

You  should  now  have  a gradient that goes from light aqua colour to a
deep purple colour.

Click OK to close the ranges colour panel.

Now  let's  create  a  stencil  to  lock  out the continent when we do a
gradient rectangle fill.

Select Stencil>Make from the Effects menu or press the - key to bring up
the Make Stencil requester

Click the Fine Tune check box, and left click on any continent (the dark
grey colour)

Click  on  the  Make button in the requester to create a stencil for the
continents.

Select  Texture>On/Off  from  the  Effect  menu.   (When you select this
choice  for  the  first  time  in  your  work session, Deluxe Paint will
automatically  bring  up the Load Texture window and turn on the texture
for  you  once  it is loaded).  Select the Brush Stroke texture from the
textures  directory  of  the  Media  disk.    You  now  have  a textured
background loaded into memory.

Right  click  on  the  Filled  Rectangle  tool to bring up the Fill Type
requester

Choose  the  standard  Vertical Fill and the Smooth Dither gradient Make
sure the blue gradient you created is the current gradient.  Click OK to
choose the filled rectangle tool.

Press F10 to turn off the Menus and Toolbox

Take  your  cursor  and  create a filled rectangle from the bottom right
corner  of your image to the top left corner of your image.  In a moment
you will see that Deluxe Paint has allowed you to create a textured fill
with  a gradient.  You need not combine the texture with a gradient, but
as  you  can  see  the  effect  is a very nice one.  You can repeat this
process  one  or  two more times and Deluxe Paint will act as if you are
building up layers of paint on a textured background.

You  won't  need  your  stencil anymore, so choose Stencil>Free from the
Effect Menu.

Select  Texture>Load  from  the  Effect  menu  and load the EmbossedHair
texture file.

Press  F10  to  turn  on the toolbar if it isn't on already.  Select the
light green colour in your toolbox palette.

Bring  up  the Fill Type requester by right clicking on the fill tool or
pressing  F  (Shift-f).    Choose  Solid and click OK to choose the Fill
tool.

Click  on  the continent of Africa with the Fill tool.  You should see a
hair-like texture fill the area you clicked on.

Choose  another  colour,  load  up  another  texture  and   fill another
continent  or  go  on to the next step when you are ready - don't let us
interrupt your creative endeavours.

Press  j to swap to the spare page or select Spare>Swap from the Picture
Menu.

Load  the  WorldMap.Lores  file  from the Picture drawer of the Examples
disk.  Click No at the change format message.

Press  j to swap back to your TextureMap image.  Load the Wall file from
the textures drawer of the Media disk.

Turn on translucency (Alt-t). It should be set to 50% by default.

Select Rub Thru from the Mode Menu.  Press F10 to turn off the menus and
toolbar.

Select the sketch tool (press s) and start rubbing through part of North
America.  Because you have translucency on you are not rubbing through a
full  opaque  image only 50% of the image (or whatever your translucency
settings  are)  rubs  through.   The amount rubbed through is also being
affected  by the texture currently loaded.  You can turn off the texture
to  see  the difference in how it reacts as you paint.  You can also try
different  combinations of having the translucency off, process on, etc.


Select Colour from the Mode menu or press F2.

Now  let's see what effect media types have on images.  Please note that
media  type libraries will not work by themselves, they require that you
have a texture loaded into Deluxe Paint V.

Select  Media>Open...  from the Effect menu and load the file Chalk from
the media drawer of the media disk.

Choose  the Sketch tool or your preferred drawing tool and start drawing
some lines on the screen.  You'll notice that you get a slow build-up of
colour  depending  on  what  your current colour is and what texture you
have loaded.  Change your foreground colour and draw again.

Load the felttip media library as you did the chalk one.  Drawing on the
screen  with  this media library will affect the colours underneath your
brush  more  rapidly  than  the  chalk brush, and the colours under your
brush  will  lean  to dark values very quickly, just as a dirty felt tip
pen going over other colours would.

The other media libraries will give you different effects.  Oil will mix
much  more  with  the  colours  underneath  your  brush just like an Oil
Pastel.   Water colour will give you a soft textured tint of the current
foreground colour.

Experiment  with  these  and any other media libraries, we've made Media
libraries  and  Textures  as flexible and customisable as possible.  The
combina  tions  of effects in Deluxe Paint V are endless, so be creative
and  experiment  with  as much of the program as you can.  With a little
practice you'll be creating digital masterpieces in no time. 

Tutorial Seven: Using Macros

In  the  following  tutorial, you'll learn how to record your actions as
macros.    Once  you record a macro, you can save it to a file, edit it,
and  execute  it as many times as you need.  Macros are great timesavers
for repetitive tasks.

Recording Your Actions

The Record Macro command lets you record your keyboard and mouse actions
and save them as a macro you can execute from the User menu

Menu Commands

Sure,  Deluxe  Paint has many keyboard shortcuts, but there are probably
some  menu  commands  that you use frequently that don't have a built in
keyboard  shortcut.    You  can  create  your  own  macros  to  bring up
requesters  at the touch of a button.  Let's create a macro for bringing
up the Load Media requester.

Choose  Record  Macro  from  the  Macro  menu.    Your  actions are auto
matically  recorded  from the time you select this menu command (and the
menu  item is checked while recording) to the moment you reselect Record
Macro.

Choose  Effect>Media>Open  to  open  the Load Media requester.  Select a
Media  file  if you wish to open one; otherwise click Cancel (it doesn't
matter which action you take for the purposes of our macro)

You  can  record your mouse and keyboard actions when using Deluxe Paint
menus and requesters, but you can't record file specific actions such as
opening  a Media file.  That's why it doesnt matter whether you click OK
or Cancel in the preceding step.

Choose Macro>Record Macro again to stop recording the macro.  The Assign
Macro requester appears.

Select macro slot Macro #1 and press OK.

To  test  the macro you just created, select User>Macro #1 (or type A-1)
thc  Load  Media  requester appears.  You just created a macro!  For the
remainder of your Deluxe Paint session, you can type A-1 to bring up the
Load Media requester without having to select it from the Effect menu.

Automatic Signature

Let's  try  something  a  little  more  fun.    How about recording your
signature so you can automatically put your signature on a painting?

Make  sure  that  the  Record  Details  option  in the Macro menu is not
checked  (it  is  checked  by  default) this will reduce the size of our
macro file.

Choose Record Macro from the Macro menu

Click  on  the  smallest  brush in the toolbox (the 1-pixel brush in the
upper left corner).

Write your name in the lower right corner of the screen.

Choose Macro>Record Macro again to stop recording the macro.  The Aasign
Macro requester appears.

Select macro slot Macro #2 and press OK.

Clear  the  screen,  and  then select User>Macro #2 (or type A-2).  Your
signature is written on the lower right corner of the screen.

Recording  your  signature is hardly the most useful task you can assign
to  a  macro.  Try recording and saving actions such as drawing a figure
and then cutting it out as a brush.

Saving And Loading Macros

Now that we've recorded a couple of macros, let's experiment with saving
and loading macros.

Saving a Macro

The  macros  you've  created so far are stored only in RAM - if you exit
the  program,  they will be lost.  Let's save the first macro to disk so
we can permanently assign it to a macro slot.

Select  Save  As...    from  the  Macro  menu.  The Save Macro requester
appears.

Click  the  Macro  #1 radio button, and then click OK.  A standard Amiga
save requester appears.

Type  the filename LoadMedia.dprx in the File text gadget.  (Macpaint the brush.

Press 0 on the keypad to return to the brush to its original orientation.

When  you  use  the  Shift  key  with  one of the keypad keys, the brush
rotates  by  the  Angle Step.  The default Angle Step is 90 degrees, but
you can change it to any angle you like in the Perspective requester.

Choose  Perspective>Settings  from  the  Effect  menu  to   display this
requester,  or right click on the Grid tool while you are in Perspective
mode.

When using perspective, 90 degrees is the most coe first macro
slot.

Select  Load...  from the Macro menu.  The Load Macro requester appears.

You may notice that our LoadMedia.dprx file is in fact already placed in
the  Macro #1 slot.  Deluxe Paint automatically places the macro file in
the  appropriate  slot  when  you  save a macro.  But we'll pretend that
you're loading a macro file from the beginning.

Each  of  the  ten  macro  slots  has a question mark (?) to its right. 
Clicking  this  button  brings  up  an Amiga file load requester for the
respective  macro  slot.  Click the button to the right (of Macro #1.  A
Load Macro file load requester appears.

Double  click  on  the  file  LoadMedia.dprx.  The macro file we created
above is selected, and you return to the Load Macro requester.

Click OK to accept the macro assignment

You have now created a permanent macro file and assigned it to the first
macro  slot.    However,  if you quit the program now, no macros will be
assigned when Deluxe Paint is restarted.  If you want to save your macro
assignments permanently, choose Prefs>Save to save all your Deluxe Paint
preferences settings as tooltypes.

Only  macro  files  that  have been assigned to macro slots are saved as
tooltypes.    If  a  macro has been created in memory but not saved to a
file  and  assigned  to  a slot, the macro will be lost even if you save
your preferences before you exit Deluxe Paint.

In this tutorial you've learned how to record your actions and save them
to macro files that can be assigned to keyboard shortcuts.  However, you
can  do  much  more  with ARrexx macro files than simply record and play
back  your  actions.    You  can  also write your own macro scripts from
scratch, or edit macro files recorded in Deluxe Paint.  See the Appendix
F for more on the world of ARexx macros.

This  section  explaines  Deluxe   Paints   powerful   Perspective mode.
Perspective  lets  you  paint  in  three dimensions, which can give your
pictures a true feel ing of depth.  perspective is a complex feature, so
we  strongly  recommend that you become familiar with the program before
you  venture  into  this  area.  We've tried to make this explanation as
clear  as  possible,  but be sure that the steps we list assume that you
understand other program features. 

Three Dimensional Model

When  you paint in Perspective mode, you are working with a three-dimen-
sional  representation of the two dimensional space that is available on
your  screen.    To  visualise this model it might help to think of your
computer screen as the front side of a box.

Usually,  when  you  paint,  the  mouse  moves  your  brush  in only two
directions;  horizontally  and vertically.  But when you move and rotate
your  brush in Perspective mode, you add a third direction to the motion
backward  and  forward.   To move the brush into the distance or towards
you, you'll move it on the Z axis of th system shown above.

You'll  learn  more  about  the coordinate system later in this chapter.
For  now  just  remember  that  in  its  default  settings,  the  screen
coordinates  operate  as shown in Figure 5.1; the axis runs horizontally
across  the  screen,  the  Y  axis  runs  vertically and the Z axis runs
backward into the screen

Rotating a Brush in 3D Space

The  key to working in Perspective is rotating the brush.  In this brief
section,  we'll  show  you  how  to  rotate your brush using the numeric
keypad.  Before you begin, you need a brush to rotate.

Load the Dolphin brush from the Media disk.

If  you are NOT in HAM, choose Palette>Use Brush Palette from the Colour
menu.  If you are in HAM, move to the next step.

After you have a brush, you can enter Perspective mode.

Choose  Perspective>Do  from  the  Effect  menu to enter the Perspective
mode.
 
A  small  cross hair appears in the middle of the screen to indicate the
Perspective  Centre  (or  line of view), and your brush is enclosed in a
wire  frame  with  a large cross-hair over it.  In our example, you will
also see three zeros on the right half of the Title Bar.  These indicate
the  current  rotation  angles  of the brush.  The numbers are all zeros
because we haven't rotated the brush yet.

The  cross  hair  on your brush makes any brush rotations easier to see,
and  it  will  help  you  position  the brush when it changes sizes.  An
important  feature  of  the  cross hair is that it indicates the X and Y
axes  of  the  brush.  The Z axis of the brush runs perpendicular to the
other  two  axes,  just  like the screen's Z axis.  Figure 5,3 shows the
Brush axis system.

To  rotate  the  brush, use the numeric keypad on the right side of your
keyboard.  Figure 5.4 shows how each of the keys rotates the brush.

All  numerical  keystrokes  in  Perspective  mode  refer  to the numeric
keypad.    You'll use the keypad to rotate images.  Sometimes you'll use
the Shift key in combination with the keypad to rotate an object a fixed
number of degrees (more about this in Angle Step, below).

We'll  try each of the rotations in the next few steps so you get a feel
for  moving in 3D.  We'll start off with the simplest rotation, that is,
a rotation on the Z axis with the brush in its normal 0,0,0 orientation.
This  is  the  simplest rotation, because no part of the brush moves off
the plane of your computer screen.

Hold down 2 on the keypad for about 5 seconds.

The  Dolphin  disappears  and  the  wire  frame rotates clockwise on its
centre  (the  position  of  the  pointer).  Notice that the third number
along  the  right  side  of  the Title Bar has increased as the rotation
angles increased.  Figure 5.5 illustrates rotation on the Z axis.

Press  1  repeatedly until the numbers along the right side of the Title
Bar show 0, 0, 0 as the brush rotation.

When  the  brush  is  back  to the 0,0,0 position, the Dolphin reappears
inside  the  frame.  This is a handy visual cue that the brush is at its
orientation.    Later,  when  you  begin  moving  the   brush   in three
dimensional  space,  you'll see that the same rule applies to movement -
if  the  brush  is  back  on  its original plane it reappears inside the
frame.

Displaying  the brush is dependent on memory availability your brush may
not  appear  even  when  in  its  original orientation if it is large or
memory availability is low.

Rotating  on  the other axes works just like rotating on Z, but when you
rotate  on  the  other axes, the brush moves off the plane of the screen
and  into  the third dimension.  Let's see how this works by rotating on
X.
 
Move  (don't  drag)  the  brush  to the lower left corner of the screen.
Hold down 7 on the keypad.

When the brush frame has rotated to about -45 dgrees, release the 7 key,
and click to paint the brush.

As you rotate the brush on the X axis, it appears as though the top half
of  the  brush is turning into the screen and the bottom half is turning
outward.    As  a  result,  your painted brush is set at an angle to the
screen as shown in Figure 5.6.

To return your brush to its original orientation, press 0.

Resetting the Brush Rotation

The  last  step introduced an important keystroke.  Any time you need to
reset  the  brush  to  its original orientation of 0,0,0, press 0 on the
keypad.   If you get lost in the world of 3D, you can always get back to
the beginning with this simple keystroke.

The Angle Step

To rotate on the Y axis, you use 4 and 5 on the keypad.  This time we'll
use the Shift key to rotate by a larger increment, automatically.

Move  your brush to the lower right corner of the screen.  Hold down the
Shift  key  and  press 4 on the keypad.  Your brush instantly rotates 90
degrees on the Y axis.  Click to paint the brush.

Press 0 on the keypad to return to the brush to its original orientation.

When  you  use  the  Shift  key  with  one of the keypad keys, the brush
rotates  by  the  Angle Step.  The default Angle Step is 90 degrees, but
you can change it to any angle you like in the Perspective requester.

Choose  Perspective>Settings  from  the  Effect  menu  to   display this
requester,  or right click on the Grid tool while you are in Perspective
mode.

When using perspective, 90 degrees is the most common angle, so leave it
there for now.

Click OK to return to the painting screen.

Rotation around the Handle

When  you  rotate  a  brush  in  Perspective, the rotation always occurs
around the brush handle to the preceding examples, the brush was held by
the  centre  (the  default  position),  so the rotations always occurred
around  the  centre  of the brush.  Let's look at the difference between
rotation  around the centre and rotation around the corner of the brush.

Click  CLR  to  clear the screen.  Position the brush near the middle of
the screen.  Hold down the Shift key and press 2 on the keypad to rotate
90  degrees  on  the  Z axis.  Press Shift 2 three more times to set the
brush back to 0,0,0 or press 3 on the keypad to reset the Z axis.

You've  seen  this  rotation before, but we had you repeat it to compare
this with rotation around the corner of the brush.

Keep the brush in the same location. Press Alt-x on the keyboard.

This moves the brush so that it is held by the lower right corner.  Note
the  position  of  the  arrow  cursor.  You can also do this by choosing
Handle>Rotate from the Brush menu.

Press Shift-2 to rotate the brush around the new handle position.

Figure 5.8 illustrates the difference between rotation around the centre
and rotation about the corner.

So  far  in  our discussion of brush rotations, we've always rotated the
brush  on  one of the two possible coordinate systems.  If you look back
to  Figure  5.7,  you'll  see  that  below Angle Step in the Perspective
requester  there  is  an item labelled Type with two buttons: Screen and
Brush.    We've  been  rotating in the Screen coordinate system.  In the
next  few  steps,  we'll  demonstrate  the  difference  between  the two
rotation systems.

INFORMATION

If  you  are  familiar with rotation systems, you'll recognise that this
Screen coordinate system is based on Euler angles.

Before  beginning  this  brief  example, make sure your screen is clear.
When it is:

Choose  Handle>Rotate  from  the  Brush  menu (or press Alt-x until your
handle  is  at  the  centre);  and  press  o  to reset your brush to its
original orientation.

To  make  this example clearer, it will help if the Angle Step is set to
something other than 90 degrees.  In the next step we'll have you change
it to 45 degrees.

Choose  Perspective>Settings  from  the  Effect menu (or right click the
Grid icon) to display the Perspective requester.

Click in the right side of the Angle Step edit field, backspace to erase
the 90 setting and type 45.  Click OK to close the requester and use the
new setting.

Now let's try a rotation in the screen coordinate system:

Position  your  brush  in  the  lower  left corner of the screen.  Press
Shift-2 to rotate 45 degrees on the Z axis.  Now press Shift-7 to rotate
-45 degrees on the X axis.

Click to paint the brush down.

Notice  that when you rotated the brush on the X axis, the Screen's axis
was  used.   The brush's X axis was tilted sideways, but the brush still
rotated back ward into the screen.  Also notice that the rotation angles
appear in the Title Bar.

NOW we change see the difference.

Right  click  the Grid tool to display the Perspective requester.  Click
the button labelled Brush and click OK.

Press 0 to reset your brush to its original orientation.

Position  the  brush  in  the  lower  right corner of the screen.  Press
Shift-2 to rotate 45 degrees on the Z axis.  Now press Shift-7 to rotate
45 degrees (or the X axis.

Click to paint the brush down.

In  the  Brush coordinates system, rotations always take place about the
brush axes, regardless of the current orientation of the brush.  In this
example,  the  X  axis  was  positioned  diagonally after you rotated 45
degrees  on  the  Z axis; as a result, the brush rotated on the diagonal
axis instead of rotating straight backward into the screen.

You'll  also  notice  that the angles shown in the Title Bar are not the
angles that you rotated.  The Title Bar always shows the rotation angles
for  the  Screen  coordinate  system.  This allows you to reproduce your
brush  rotation  by  switching to Screen angles and rotating the amounts
indicated in the Title Bar.

Deluxe  Paint  offers  both  Screen  and  Brush  coordinate  systems for
rotation, because each of the systems has unique merits:

The Screen coordinates system is often consistent with the notion of the
three  screen  coordinates defining the 3D space.  More importantly, the
Screen coordinates system is reproducible: you can jot down the rotation
numbers  in the Menu Bar and reproduce the same brush orientation simply
by  rotating  to the same angles.  The results of multiple rotations are
the same no matter what order you rotate in.

The  Brush  coordinates system is usually easier to visualise if you are
rotat  ing  at  angles  other  than  90.  So you can usually produce the
desired  brush  orientation without much difficulty.  Unfortunately, the
cumulative  effect  of  separate  rotations  on  the  brush axes are not
reproducible  unless you make the exact same rotations in the exact same
order.    You'll  notice  that the angles given in the Menu Bar when you
rotate  using  the  Brush  coordinates  are  actually the angles for the
Screen coordinates system: this is so you will be able to reproduce your
brush rotation, though you will have to use Screen angles to do it. 

Now  that  you've seen how to rotate your brush in three dimensions, the
next  section will show you the ins and outs of moving a brush around in
all three dimensions.

Moving in 3D Space

Before you begin this section clear the screen.
 
Choose  Perspective>Reset  from the Effect menu to reset all perspective
settings, including Angle Type, to their defaults.

Load  the  brush  named  Block.brush  from   the   Media   disk.  Choose
Palette>Use Brush Palette from the Colour menu.
 
Make sure you are in Perspective mode.

Moving on the Z axis.

When  your  brush  is in its original orientation (0, 0, 0), moving your
mouse moves your brush along the X and Y axes.  Try it right now:

Move your mouse forward and watch how your brush moves up on the screen.
Move  your  mouse  backward  and  your  brush  moves down on the screen.
Likewise,  moving the mouse left or right moves the brush left or right.

Because  your mouse can move in only two dimensions (the third direction
would  require  you  to lift it off the desk), it can move your brush in
only  two directions.  you can move your brush in the third dimension by
using the keyboard.  One method is to move the brush straight back along
the Z axis only:

Position  your  brush  in the lower left corner of the screen, hold down
the Shift key and press the quote key (") several times.

Each  time you press Shift-" the brush moves backward along the Z axis. 
It  appears  as  though  the  brush is getting smaller but in fact it is
moving  away  from  the  front of the screen.  To move the brush forward
along the Z axis, you use the colon key(:).

Hold down the Shift key and press the colon key (:) once.

Notice  that  the  "  and : keys move the brush toward and away from the
cross  hair  in  the  middle of the screen.  This cross hair defines the
Perspective  Centre,  which is best thought of as the point of view.  No
matter  where  you  place the brush in the screen, if you move the brush
using  the  quote  key, the brush will move into the distance and toward
the Perspective Centre.

When you use Perspective, you'll often want to move your brush backwards
and  left  and  right  along  a  plane.  The effect is of a brush moving
across  the  floor.    Deluxe Paint lets you do this by holding down ates and take note of the cursor position before
you  rotate your brush, you'll be able to recreate the perspective plane
exactly.

Press Shift Keypad 7 to rotate the brush 90 degrees on X.

Notice  that at this point you don't have angles in your Title Bar.  You
can  turn  off  Coordinates if you want to see the angles, but you don't
need  them  for  this  exercise,  since  all  of our movements are on 90
degrees and based on sight, not numbers.

Choose Perspective>FillScreen from the Effect menu.

Buildin you are in Perspective mode.  This is useful if
you need to align your brush precisely.

Press the \ key and look at what happens to the angles in the right side
of  the  Title  Bar.   Now hold down the Ctrl key and move the mouse for
ward and backward.

Pressing  the  \  key  toggles  the  Display  option  in the Perspective
requester between Angle and Pos (position)

Press the \ key again to return to displaying angles in the Title Bar.

Laying Down the Brush to move in 3D.

Another  way to move into the distance is to lay the brush down and then
move  it on its own Y axes.  Rotating the brush 90 degrees on its X axis
makes the brushes Y axes act like the screens Z axis.  Figure 5.11 shows
what happens to the different axes during perspective rotation.

Let's try it once to see how it works.

Press  0 to reset the brush to its original orientation and position the
brush in the lower left corner of the screen.

Press  Shift-keypad  7 to flop the brush down into the screen.  Now move
the mouse around.

You  will  quickly  discover  that moving the mouse forward and backward
moves  the  brush  into  the screen and back out instead of up and down.
This  is  because  the mouse moves the brush on the plane defined by the
brush's X and Y coordinates.

Move  the  brush to any new position and press Shift-keypad 8 to turn it
back up on end.  Paint the brush down.

Use  the  combination of Shift-keypad 7 and Shift-keypad 8 several times
until you are comfortable with how these keys help you move in the third
dimension. 

Perspective Plane

You  might have noticed that when you flopped the brush down by rotating
on  its X axis, the brush moved on a plane below the Perspective Centre.
Remember  that  when  the brush is in its original 0,0,0 orientation, it
moves  on a plane that is roughly the equivalent of the computer screen.
When you rotate the brush, you change the orientation of the plane.  The
plane can be at almost any angle to Perspective Centre.  The easiest way
to see this is to fill the perspective plane you've defined.

Press  0 to reset your brush.  Position the brush so that your cursor is
at the bottom of the screen.

Press Shift-7 to rotate the brush on the X axis.

Choose  Perspective>FillScreen  from the Effect menu and watch as Deluxe
Paint fills the perspective plane with a pattern of your brush.

The results of this last step should look something like Figure 5.12

As  we  said,  you can set your perspective plane at almost any angle to
the  Perspective  Centre.    In the next step, we'll draw a plane to the
right  of  centre  with  the brush rotated sideways.  This will create a
"wall" on the right.

Press  0  to  reset  your  brush to its original orientation.  Place the
brush in the lower right corner of the screen.

Press Shift-4 to turn the brush into the screen.

Choose Perspective>FillScreen from the Effect menu.
 
Practice  creating  different  planes.   For example, position the brush
above perspective centre to create a "ceiling" from your brush.

The Perspective Horizon

The  position  of  perspective  centre  plays  an  important   role   in
determining  the  angle  of the plane to the viewer.  It also determines
the  horizon point.  The horizon point is the farthest edge of the plane
when  you  rotate a brush to 90 degrees.  To demonstrate how this works,
we'll  load  a  picture that has a horizon and fill the plane out to the
horizon.

Load  the  picture  Seascape   from   the   Examples   disk   and choose
Palette>Default Palette from the Colour menu.

You  might  remember this picture from the Guided Tour.  In the picture,
the  ocean stretches to a flat horizon on the right side.  We'll set our
Perspective Centre in line with this horizon and then fill a perspective
plane.

Choose  Perspective>Centre from the Effect menu.  Your cursor changes to
a large cross hair.

Position  the  cross hair so that it is halfway across the screen and so
the  horizontal line of the cross-hair lines up with exactly the horizon
in the picture.  Click to place the perspective centre.

Now load your Block.brush brush, and enter Perspective mode.

Press Shift-7 to rotate your brush 90 degrees.

Choose  Perspective>FillScreen  from  the  Effect  menu  to fill the per
spective plane.

When  you  are  done,  your screen should look like Figure 5.13.  Notice
that  the  horizon of your perspective plane exactly matches the horizon
of the original picture.

The Angle of the Plane

In  the example above, the perspective plane matches the horizon because
you rotated the brush by 90 degrees.  If you had rotated by more than 90
degrees  the  plane  would  not  reach  the horizon, as though the plane
sloped  downward  If  you  had rotated by less than 90 degrees the plane
would  extend  above  the  horizon  as  though  it  sloped upward like a
mountain.    It  is  difficult to see the differences unless you have an
existing  horizon  to  compare  the  plane  with.    Without an existing
horizon, the sloping of the plane will appear to be only a difference in
the  distance  between  the  position  of  the brush and the perspective
centre when the brush was rotated.

When you create a perspective plane, the position and angle of the plane
are determined by three things:

The position of the Perspective Centre.

The position of the brush handle (cursor) when you rotate the brush.

And the degree of rotation.

In  our  examples above, we rotated the brush in 90 degree increments so
the  plane was always either parallel to our point of view or at a right
angle.    If you want to create a sloping surface, you do so by rotating
the brush to an angle less than 90 degrees.  Here's a quick example:

Choose Perspective>Reset from the effect menu or press Shift-keypad 0.

Position  your  brush  so  that  the cursor is at the very bottom of the
screen.    Hold  down  7  on  the keypad until the brush has rotated -60
degrees on the X axis.

Move  the  mouse forward and backward to see how the brush moves on this
new plane.

You'll notice that the vanishing point of the brush is above the horizon
in  your picture, this is because the plane is not parallel to the point
of view.  It is as though you were looking at a gradual incline.

Putting Things in Perspective

We've  covered  the  fundamentals  of perspective.  Now it's time to put
what  you've  learned  into  practice.  In this exercise, we'll create a
perspective  land  scape  and build a three dimensional arch as shown in
Figure 5.14.  In the process you'll learn some of the tricks about using
perspective that you can only understand when you see them in context.

Creating the Plane

The  first  step  of our tutorial is to create a perspective plane.  You
don't  need  to  create  a  plane every time you use perspective.  We're
doing it here, so you can readily see the "depth" of your picture.

Load the Block.brush brush from the Media disk.

Notice that this brush is held by the lower right corner.  If you expect
to  use  a  brush  in Perspective, it is best to save the brush with the
handle in the lower right corner for two reasons:

1.    Rotations  always occur around the handle, so holding the brush in
the corner helps make the rotations consistent and useful.

2.    If  you  establish  a  Perspective  grid, you can make all of your
brushes conform to that grid if their handles are in the same corner.

Choose Coords (short for Coordinates) from the Prefs menu or press the |
key (Shift \)

Press the Enter key on the keypad to enter Perspective mode.

Position  the  cursor  at  196, 25 and press Shift-G, which turns on the
grid and uses 196, 25 as one of the grid points.

If  you  turn on Coordinates and take note of the cursor position before
you  rotate your brush, you'll be able to recreate the perspective plane
exactly.

Press Shift Keypad 7 to rotate the brush 90 degrees on X.

Notice  that at this point you don't have angles in your Title Bar.  You
can  turn  off  Coordinates if you want to see the angles, but you don't
need  them  for  this  exercise,  since  all  of our movements are on 90
degrees and based on sight, not numbers.

Choose Perspective>FillScreen from the Effect menu.

Building the Arch

Load the RedBlock brush from the Media disk.

A  this  point  you  are  no longer in Perspective mode, but the Grid is
still on.

Press the Enter key on the keypad to enter Perspective mode.

Your  brush  is  automatically laid down on the perspective plane in the
same orientation you left it in last (that is, rotated 90 degrees on the
X  axis)  This  is an important point to remember, because it means that
you  can  easily bring in new brushes at the right perspective simply by
loading  them with the per spective plane defined by the previous brush.

You'll  notice  that  the grid has been adjusted to your new brush size.
It  is  not  necessarily true that your new brush will line up currectly
with  the grid point you used to define the plane (196, 25), because the
brush  handle  is  tied  to  the  closest  grid  point  when  you  enter
perspective  and there is a three-in four chance that it will be tied to
one  of  the  other  corners.  If you want the brush to line up with the
grid  point  you  specified when you created the grid, press Keypad 0 to
reset  the  brush to 0, 0, 0 orientation, align the handle with the grid
point, and rotate the brush again.

If  you  don't  want  your  perspective  grid automatically sized to new
brushes, turn off the AutoGrid option in the Prefs menu.

Press  G  to  turn  off the Grid so you can move the brush freely on the
plane.

Position  the  brush so that the Y axis of the brush is aligned with the
Perspective  Centre and the bottom of the brush is aligned with the edge
of the second full row of tile on the floor.  (The coordinates will show
this point as 175, 46).

Press  Shift-G  to  turn on the grid and use your new handle position as
one of the grid points.

Press  Shift  Keypad  8  to rotate the brush up on the X axis.  Move the
brush  two  grid  points to the left and stamp it down.  Paint the brush
three times above the current brush position so you create the face of a
column.

Paint  the brush four times to the right to form the top of the arch and
the  top  of the right column.  Then paint the brush three times down to
form the right column.

At  this  point  you  have a two dimensional arch on a three dimensional
plane.  Our next task is to give the arch a third dimension.

Move  the  brush  so that it is directly on the bottom block of the left
column  of  your  arch.    Press  Shift Keypad 4 to rotate the brush -90
degrees  on  the y axis.  Paint the brush where it is and twice above to
form the left side of the column.

Move  the  mouse  a  bit to the right to move the brush back along its x
axis and paint another set of blocks so your column is one block wide at
the face and two blocks deep as shown in Figure 5.14.

Press  Shift  Keypad 5 to rotate the brush back on its Y axis so that it
is  facing you head on.  If the brush is not the same size as the facing
blocks  of your arch, hold down the Ctrl key and move the mouse for ward
or backward to bring it closer or move it back.

As  we  explained  in  Chapter  Five,  Using  Perspective,  the Ctrl key
temporarily  fixes  the  Y axis of your brush so that you can move it on
its Z axis.  As you become adept at painting in Perspective, you'll find
yourself using this key often.

Position  the  brush to the left of the bottom block of the right column
Press Alt-x to change the brush handle to the other side of the brush.

Your  brush  jumps  so  that  it  is  over the bottom block of the right
column,  but  the, brush is now held by the lower left corner.  Remember
that  Alt-x  repositions your brush handle.  This keyboard equivalent is
especially  useful while working in Perspective, since you usually don't
want to move your mouse to choose from the menu.

Press  Shift  Keypad  5  to  rotate  the brush 90 degrees on the Y axis.
Paint the brush where it is and twice above to form the left side of the
column Paint another column just behind this first one so your column is
one block wide at the face and two blocks deep.

Press  Shift  Keypad  4  to rotate the brush back on the Y axis.  If the
brush  is not the same size as the facing blocks of your arch, hold down
the Ctrl key and move the mouse forward or backward to bring it clos- er
or move it back.

Move  the brush up so that it is over the block in the upper left corner
of  the  arch.   Press Shift-Keypad 7 to rotate the brush -90 degrees on
the X axis.  Move the brush to the right and stamp it once below each of
the  three blocks that form the top of the arch.  Paint another row just
behind  this first row so the top of your arch is one block high and two
blocks deep.

Now  your  arch is complete and should look just like the arch in Figure
5.14.

Inserting the Seascape Picture

To give your perspective painting a bit more colour, and a landscape for
the  background,  we'll  load the Seascape picture and add it behind the
arch.

Choose  Spare>Swap  from  the Picture menu to display the spare page (or
press j).

Load the Seascape picture from the Picture drawer on your Examples disk.
Choose Palette>Default Palette from the Colour menu.

Jump back to your main page (press or choose Spare>Swap from the Picture
menu).

Choose Spare>Merge in back from the Picture menu.

In a flash, your arch has a nice seascape backdrop.

This  exercise gave you a quick example of perspective, but you can do a
lot  more.    For  an excellent example of perspective at work, load the
picture New Star-Hall on your Examples disk.

This  chapter introduces you to Deluxe Paint V's animation features.  It
begins  by explaining the basic model for animation and then covers such
as  the  different  ways  to  create  animations  with  the program.  We
recommend  that  you  work through this chapter in one sitting.  It will
take you approxi mately 45 minutes to complete.

Before You Begin

If  you've  been  experimenting  with  Deluxe  Paint  for a while before
starting  this  chapter  it would be a good idea to quit the program and
restart.   If you start the program fresh, there is less chance that the
results  you get from fol lowing our instructions will be different from
what we describe.

When the Choose Screen Format requester appears, select Lo-Res, 320x200,
and 32 colours, and click Use.

The Basic Model

The  basic  idea  behind  animation  in  Deluxe Paint is that instead of
having  a  single page to paint on, you have multiple pages that you can
paint on and flip through.  By creating images that differ slightly from
page  to page and then playing them back in rapid succession, you create
the illusion of motion

This section shows you how to:

Create frames for your animation
Paint on individual frames in the animation
Paint while the frames are flipping - this is called Animpainting
Use the Animation Control Panel

Creating Frames

The first step in building an animation is to create the frames to paint
on

Choose  Frames>Set  # from the Anim menu.  The Set Frame Count requester
appears.

Click in the count edit box, change the frame count to 10 and click OK.

You now have 10 frames to paint on.  Notice the numbers 1/10 at the left
side of the Title Bar.  This means you are positioned on the first frame
of a 10 frame animation. 

Painting One Frame at a Time

The most basic way to create an animation is to paint on each successive
frame individually.

Select  the  largest  round  built-in brush and paint a dot in the upper
left area of your screen

The dot you just placed is on frame 1.  The trick of animation in Deluxe
Paint is to paint a slightly different picture on successive frames.  So
you need to move to the next frame.

Choose  Control>Next from the Anim menu to move to frame 2.  of the two memory methods in
Reference.

Simple Moves in Three Dimensions

The  Move  requester  does exactly what its name implies - it moves your
brush  on  the  screen.    There  are many impressive animations you can
create  with  only  the Move requester and a brush like our DPaint Title
brush,  but  to create those impressive animations, you need to know how
each  feature  of the Move requester works.  This brief section explains
the most basic Moves.

Stamp your brush in the centre of the screen.

C menu  beside the options).
Follow  the  numbered  steps below and we'll use keyboard equivalents to
complete and play our little animation.

1.    Position  your  brush  just to the right of the dot you painted on
frame 2.

2.    Press  2  on  the keyboard once to advance to the next frame, then
click to paint a new dot.

3.    Repeat step 2, painting each dot to the right of the previous one,
until your first dot appears again in the left side of the screen.  (The
Title Bar will show 1/10 as your frame position).

You've just created a brief animation. Now let's play it.

4.  Choose Control>Play from the Anim menu (or press 4 at the top of the
keyboard).  You should see your dot moving from left to right across the
screen.

5. To stop the animation, press the space bar.

Animation Control Panel

Selecting  animation options from the Anim menu or using keyboard equiv-
alents  for those commands are only two of the ways Deluxe Paint has for
controlling  your  animations.   Those two methods are handy but perhaps
the  most  efficient  way  to  control  your  animation  is  through the
Animation Control Panel.

Select Control>Panel from the Anim menu

The  Animation  Control Panel appears at the bottom of the screen.  It's
use-  ful to have it visible while you work on your animation sequence. 
If  you  want  to remove it while you're animating, choose Control>Panel
from  the  Anim  menu again.  (Notice that there are check marks next to
items when they're on; no check mark when they're off).

The  Control  Panel  contains a Frame slider, scroll arrows, and fifteen
control buttons for working through and playing with your animation.

Frame Slider

The Frame slider helps you keep track of where you are in your animation
sequence,  when you've hidden the Title Bar.  Even when the Title Bar is
showing  you  can  move to a specific frame by dragging the slider or by
click  ing  on  it.  One click to the left or right of the slider handle
moves the ani mation one frame.  Clicking on the scroll arrows will take
you to the first (left arrow) or last (right arrow) frame.

Anim Control Buttons

Play Backwards Continuously
Play  your  animation  sequence in a continuous loop, from last frame to
first frame.  Press the space bar or click to stop play.

Play Backward Once
Click  to  play  through your animation sequence one time, from the last
frame to frame 1.  Animation ends on the first frame.

Previous Frame
Click  to  move backward one frame.  Steps from the current frame to the
pre  vious frame in the animation sequence.  If the current frame is the
first framc in the sequence, the position is set to the last frame.

Next Frame
Click  to  move  forward one frame.  Steps the current frame to the next
frame in the animation sequence.  If the current frame is the last frame
in the sequence, the position is set to the first frame.

Play Forward Once
Click  to play through your animation sequence one time, from Frame 1 to
the last frame.  Animation ends on the last frame.

Play Forward Continuously
Play  your  animation sequence in a continuous loop, from first frame to
last frame.  Press the space bar or click to stop play.

Play Ping Pong
Plays  your  animation  sequence  continuously  as  above, but plays the
sequence  forward then backward then forward and so on.  Press the space
bar or click to stop play.

Add a Frame
Adds  a  frame  after  the current frame, and copies the contents of the
current  frame  to  it.  Press Ctrl while choosing this icon to bring up
the Add Frames requester.

Delete a Frame
Deletes  the  current  frame  and  makes the following frame the current
frame  (unless  you're  already  at  the  last frame).  Press Ctrl while
choosing this icon to bring up the Delete Frames requester.

You  can't  UNDO  a  delete command, so Deluxe Paint asks you to confirm
that you really want to delete a frame.

Repeat Last Go To
Takes  you  to  the  frame  last  defined  in  the Go To Frame requester
(default  =  frame 1) of your animation.  Press Ctrl while choosing this
icon to bring up the go To Frame requester.

The  LightTable  and  the four associated icons on the right side of the
Control Panel will be described later in this chapter. 

Painting With Animation

You  saw above that one way to create an animation in Deluxe Paint is to
paint  on a series of frames individually.  For creating animations that
involve  simple  movement  of  an  object,  Deluxe Paint provides a much
easier  method  called  animpainting.    Essentially,  the   frames flip
automatically while you paint.

Right click CLR in the Toolbox. The Clear requester appears.

HINT
Left-clicking  on  CLR when there are animframes clears only the current
frame.

When  you  click  CLR  with  multiple frames, Deluxe Paint gives you the
option  of  clearing  only  the current frame, a range of frames in your
animation, or all frames.

Click All Frames in the requester. Click OK.

In a moment all of your frames are cleared and you are automatically set
back at frame 1.  Now let's do some animpainting.

Select the large round brush, and the Dotted Freehand tool

Hold  down the Alt key, and paint by holding down the left mouse but ton
and dragging across the screen from left to right.

As you paint, the frames flip automatically so you place only one dot on
each  frame  of  your  animation.   Notice that the frame counter in the
Title  Bar  changes  to  show what frame you are on.  When you reach the
last  frame  you  loop  back to frame 1, where you'll see your first dot
again.

The  Alt  key is your animpainting key.  If you hold down the Alt key at
the time you press the mouse button down, the animation frames will flip
with  each stamp of the brush so that you stamp only once on each frame,
Remember  that  you  only need to hold down the Alt key as you press the
mouse  button down.  Then you can release Alt to press other keys if you
need to.

After  you  have painted for a few seconds, stop and choose Control>Play
from the Anim menu or press 4 on the keyboard

You  can  also  use  the  Animation Control Panel to activate any of the
commands that are called for in this chapter.

Press the space bar or click to stop the animation

Now you know these basic elements of animation:

How to create frames,
How to move through the frames one by one and paint How to animpaint

Animpainting  is  especially  powerful  if you have an animated brush to
paint  with:  we'll  show  you  how  to create and use one later in this
chapter.  Right now we want to show you more ways to move objects on the
screen

Automatic Animation Using the Move Requester

The Move requester lets you automatically move and rotate a brush over a
number  of  animation  frames.  More importantly you can move and rotate
the  brush  in all three dimensions.  In essence, you are painting using
Perspective,  but  Deluxe  Paint  makes  all of the calculations for the
individual frames.

This  section  will  take  you  through  a  detailed explanation of each
feature  of  the  Move  requester  and  give  examples  for  most of the
features.

To  begin,  right  click  CLR  and  clear  All  Frames from the previous
animation sequence

Choose  Frames>Set  # from the Anim menu.  Change the frame count to 20,
and click OK.

Press Shift-1 to move to frame 1.

Load the brush DPaint Title from the Brush Drawer

Choose Palette>Use Brush Palette from the Colour menu.

These  instructions  assume  that your memory method (Method in the Anim
menu)  is  set  to  Compressed  -  the default setting.  Amigas with two
megabytes  of  RAM  can  create  only  9 to 10 frames using the Expanded
method.    You'll  find a brief description of the two memory methods in
Reference.

Simple Moves in Three Dimensions

The  Move  requester  does exactly what its name implies - it moves your
brush  on  the  screen.    There  are many impressive animations you can
create  with  only  the Move requester and a brush like our DPaint Title
brush,  but  to create those impressive animations, you need to know how
each  feature  of the Move requester works.  This brief section explains
the most basic Moves.

Stamp your brush in the centre of the screen.

Choose Move from the Anim menu. The Move requester appears.

The first row in the Move requester lists the three axes (X, Y and Z) in
the  three  dimensional  space of your screen.  If you are familiar with
Perspective  you  know  that these axes run left and right, up and down,
and  in  and  out  from  the  screen respectively.  Figure 6.7 shows the
orientation of the three axes to the screen.

Directly  below  the  X,  Y, Z letters there are edit boxes for entering
Distance  (Dist:)  numbers.  You enter numbers here to tell Deluxe Paint
how  far  to  move  your  brush  in  any  direction  or  combination  of
directions.    (If  your  brush  is moving only on the X and Y axes, the
numbers  are  equal  to  pixels, but once you move along the Z axis, the
units  are either smaller or larger than pixels).  Lets look at a simple
example:

Click in the Dist edit box below X and set the number to 200.

Make sure that the Count edit box (in the middle of the requester) shows
20  as  the current setting.  If the number is not 20, click in the edit
box and change the number.

Click Preview to see a preview of the movement of your brush.

You  will  see  your  brush  enclosed  in a wire frame move to the right
across  the  screen.    If  you want your brush to move to the left, you
enter a negative number for the X Distance.  Try it.

Set the X Dist edit box to -200. Click Preview.

This  time  your  brush  moves to the left across the screen.  A similar
rule  applies  to the other two axes: Y Distance moves your brush upward
if  the  number  is  positive and downward if the number is negative.  Z
Distance  moves  your  brush  out to the distance (away from you) if the
number  is  pos itive or inward to the screen (coming toward you) if the
number is negative

You  can  use  any combination of the three Dist edit boxes to move your
brush  anywhere  in three dimensional space.  Try it if you like.  Set a
number  for  each  of the three boxes and click Preview to see where the
brush would move.

Simple Rotation

In addition to moving the brush along an axis or several axes in combina
tion,  the  Move  requester lets you rotate the brush around one or more
axes You rotate the brush by entering numbers in the Angle edit boxes.

In  the  Move  requester,  click  Zero,  which  clears all data from the
Distance and Angle edit boxes.

Click  in  the  Z Angle edit box and enter 360 as the angle of rotation,
(This tells Deluxe Paint that you want to rotate the brush 360' on the Z
axis).  Click Preview.

You'll see a wire frame representation of your brush rotate clockwise on
the  screen.   Just as negative numbers change the direction of movement
when  using  Distance  moves,  negative  numbers change the direction of
rotation when you use Angle moves.

Change the Z Angle setting to -360 degrees and click Preview.

The wire frame rotates counter clockwise.

If  you're familiar with Deluxe Paint, you'll notice several new buttons
here  in the Move Requester that will make it easier for you to position
and  move  your  brushes  around.  Using the knowledge you learned about
perspective in Chapter 5, you'll feel right at home with the way the key
frame "Adjust" button works.

Again using the DPaint Title brush, let's try it out.

Click the Zero button to reset the distance and angle settings

Select  the  Start  key  frame  button  and  choose the Adjust key frame
button.

You  will see a wireframe representation of the DPaint Title brush as if
you were in perspective.

While  in  this  Adjust  mode you can move your brush around and set the
starting position you would like your brush in.

Click  and  drag  the  brush to the top of your screen.  Press Return or
Enter  (Either  key will accept your position and exit you out of Adjust
mode).

Press  the  End  key  frame button and choose the Adjust button one more
time.

Click  and drag the brush to the bottom of your screen.  Press Return or
Enter.

Select the Preview button to see the move you just created.  Notice that
Deluxe  Paint  enters  the distance for you automatically.  You can edit
the values manually as you learned in the previous section as well.

The  Fade slider will fade in or fade out your move using a translucency
value  between  0  and  255.    0  is  full  opaquness  and  255 is full
translucency.

The  effect  Deluxe  Paint  will  achieve  for  you is dependant on your
palette  and  screen  mode.    The  more  colours  to transition to full
translucency  the  better  the fade effect will be.  You can have a fade
value for both the Start key frame and the End key frame.

As  explained earlier, "Adjust" mode is very similar to perspective, not
only  can you move your brush in the screen's X and Y axes, you can also
rotate  your  brush using the perspective rotation keys (1, 2, 4, 5, and
7,  8  on  the  keypad)  and reset your axes using (3, 6, 9, and 0).  In
addition,  you can move your brush in the Z distance by holding down the
Ctrl  key and clicking and dragging until you set the brush size to your
liking.

We  hope  the  addition  of  setting  Start  and  End key frames and the
addition  of  a  fade  effect over a move will make it easier for you to
create  the  animations  in  your  head.   Click Zero and try some brush
rotation  and  moving  your  brush in the Z distance while in the adjust
mode  and  press  Preview to check it out before you move on to the next
section.  Have fun!

Brush Check Boxes

At  this  point  you  may  be wondering about those two options labelled
Brush  beside  the  Distance  and Angle edit boxes.  The short answer is
that  these options determine whether your brush moves and rotates based
on  the  screen axes or based on the brush axes.  The default setting is
for  the  brush  to  move along the screen axes and to rotate around the
brush  axes.    To  fully  understand  this  feature,  you'll need to be
fimiliar  with how Perspective, described in Chapter Five, works.  We'll
explain the Brush check boxes in more detail later in this chapter.  For
now just leave them as they are.

The Go Back Command

The  Go  Back button has a similar function to the Clear button, only it
affects  the  location of the brush rather than the settings in the Move
requester.   When you use the Move requester to move your brush in three
dimensional  space,  Deluxe  Paint  remembers the ending position of the
brush  when  the move is complete.  If you want to do a second move from
the final brush position, click Go Back to reset the brush

We'll  show  you  the  results  of two different move paths, one without
using  Go  Back  and  one  using  Go  Back.  In this example you'll also
actually draw and play the animation instead of simply previewing it.

Successive Moves without Go Back.

Click  Cancel in the Move requester.  Click CLR and clear all frames (if
you've been following the steps, the frame count should still be 20)

Choose Perspective>Reset from the Effect menu to reset your brush to the
original orientation.

Position the brush at the bottom of the screen, and paint it down.

Choose Move from the Anim menu to display the Move requester

Click  Zero  to  clear the edit boxes and then set the Y Distance to 200
and the Z Distance to 400.

The  frame  count  should  be  set to the number of frames you currently
have.  If it's not, make it so.

Click Draw

You  just  created  the  first  part  of the brush's movement, now we'll
create the second part to continue from where the brush ended.

Instead  of  choosing Move again, this time press Shift-m to display the
Move requester.  M is keyboard equivalent of choosing Move from the Anim
menu.

Set  the  X  Distance to 800, leom the Anim
menu  (or press 6) to play the animation forward and backward You should
see a bouncing ball.  Press Tab for added effect.

Let's  take  a  moment  to review what you just did.  You positioned the
Start and End frames to make the ball move from the top of the screen to
the bottom of the screen.  When you entered 10 in the Slow Out edit box,
you told Deluxe Paint that the brush should gradually increase its speed
over  the  first  10 frames and then move at the same speed for the lasr
ten.   You the  next  set  of  steps, you'll use the same settings as the first
example,  but  you'll  also  click the Go Back button before drawing the
second part of the brush movement.

Click CLR and clear all frames.  This time press Shift-KeyPad 0 to reset
your  brush  to  the  original  orientation.   Position the brush at the
bottom of the screen, and paint it down.

Press  m  to display the Move requester.  Set the X Distance to 0, the Y
Distance to 200, and the Z Distance to 400.  Click Draw.

Press  m again.  Set the X Distance to 800, leave the Y Distance at 200,
ans set the Z Distance to 0.  Click the Go Back button.  Click Draw.

When Deluxe Paint is finished drawing the animation, choose Control>Play
from the Anim menu and watch your animation.

This  time you see your animation shows a title splitting into two, with
one  title  moving  into  the  distance  and upward and the other moving
diagonally off the screen to the right.

Cyclic and Non-Cyclic Moves

You  use  the  Cyclic  button to tell Deluxe Paint which of two kinds of
animation you want:

An  animation  that  will  loop back on itself (cycle) or chain from the
current move to another move of a similar type: or

An animation that is linear and will end at the last frame you requested
in the Move requester.

Deluxe Paint draws your move differently depending on whether or not the
Cyclic  button is selected.  In this section we'll give you a very quick
example of the difference between the two moves.

Cyclic Animation

Load  any  brush  that contains features to help you tell whether or not
the brush has been rotated.  (The DPaint Title brush will do very well).

Right-click  CLR  and  clear  all  frames.  Choose Perspective>Reset (or
press  Shift Keypad 0) to reset your brush to the original orientation. 
Stamp the brush in the upper half of the screen.

Display  the  Move  requester.   Click Zero in the requester.  Set the Z
Angle to 360.

Click the Cyclic button so a tick appears in the box. Click Draw.

When  Deluxe  Paint  is finished drawing your animation, notice that you
are  on  frame 1 of your animation.  Deluxe Paint moved you to the frame
past the ending frame of your Count.

Press  Shift-2  to go to the last frame of the animation, (20/20 appears
in Title Bar).
 
Notice  that  on  the  last  frame  of  your animation, the brush is not
rotated  360  degrees,  even  though you asked for a 360 rotation in the
Move  requester.   This is because Cyclic tells Deluxe Paint to create a
"cyclical" animation one that completes the move on the same frame where
it  began.    With  this ani mation, you can play continuously without a
seam.

Press  4  and  watch the animation for a moment.  Press the space bar to
stop the animation.

Non-Cyclic Animation

If  Deluxe  Paint had painted the brush fully rotared on the last frame,
you  would  have  the  same  image on frames 1 and 20, and the animation
would hiccup when you played it continuously.  Let's draw the same thing
with Cyclic turned off to see how that works.

Press Shift-1 to move to frame 1 of your animation.  Paint your brush in
the lower half of the screen.

Display  the  Move  requester.   Click Cyclic to turn it off (remove the
tick), and click Draw.

Even as the new move is being drawn you can see that the new rotation is
in larger steps than the first one.  When the draw is complete, you will
be  left  at frame 20, where you can see that the new move completed the
360  degree  rota tion on frame 20 unlike the Cyclic move which left you
on frame 1

Press  4 and watch the animation.  Press the space bar to stop the anima
tion.

You  should be able to see that the rotation at the top of the screen is
smooth, but the rotation at the bottom of the screen hiccups noticeably.

You might ask yourself at this point why anyone would want Cyclic turned
off.   The answer is simple: you might want to rotate exactly 90 degrees
by  a  particular frame or you might want to move an object from point A
to exactly point B.  Generally if you are creating an animation sequence
that runs for less than the full number of frames you have allocated for
your animation, you don't want Cyclic turned on.  For a clear example of
why you would want Cyclic turned off follow the next set of steps.

Clear  all  frames of your animation.  Press Shift-2 to move to the last
frame.

Select  the  Unfilled  Circle tool and the single-pixel brush and draw a
small circle on the right side of the screen.
 
Choose  Coordinates  from  the  Prefs  menu to turn on Coordinates.  The
coordinates are displayed on the menu bar.

Select  the  Dotted Freehand tool and the largest round built-in brush. 
Position  the  brush in the middle of your unfilled circle and note what
the Coordinates show as the location of the brush.

Move the brush 200 pixels to the left of that position, press Shift-1 to
move to frame 1 and stamp down your brush.

TIP
When  you  need  to  move  your brush in a straight line horizontally or
vertically  as you did in the step above, hold down the shift key.  This
constrains  your  cursor to horizontal or vertical movement depending on
which direction you move in first.

Display  the Move requester, click Zero, set the X Distance to 200, make
sure Cyclic is selected, and click Draw.

When  Deluxe  Paint  finishes drawing the animation, notice that you are
left on frame 1.  Now look at frame 20 (Press Shift-2).  You'll see that
even though the distance from where you stamped your brush to the centre
of the circle was exactly 200 pixels and the move you requested was 200,
the  dot  did  not  reach the centre of the circle.  If you want to move
your brush to a specific location by your ending frame, turn Cyclic off.

Although  you can't see it, Deluxe Paint has positioned the brush in the
cen  tre  of  the  circle  on frame 1.  If you want to prove this, go to
frame  20  and display the Move requester.  Click 0, change the Count to
1, and click Draw

When  you  complete  a  move  with   Cyclic   selected,   Deluxe   Paint
automatically advances you to the frame beyond the end of your Count and
the  brush position Deluxe Paint remembers is the position you specified
in the Move requester.

Smooth Moves Slowly

The  Slow  Out and Slow In edit boxes let you specify a number of frames
over  which  the  brush  can accelerate or decelerare in your animation.
The  primary  advantage of these features is that you can make the brush
move ment smooth at its beginning and ending points.  Also, some effects
require  a  gradual  acceleration and deceleration to be realistic.  For
example,  a  bounc  ing  ball  should  accelerate  on the way down.  The
bouncing  ball is a good example of how this feature works, so let's try
it.

Clear  all  of  your  frames.  Load the Ball.brush brush from your Brush
direcrory  and  then  choose  Palette>Use  Brush Palette from the Colour
menu.

Press h to halve the size of the ball.

Display the Move requester.  Click Zero to zero the location values, and
then click Start.

Click Adjust.  The screen changes to a blank background with ball brush.
Click and drag within the boundaries of the box that surrounds the brush
and  position  the  brush  near  the  top of the screen.  Press Enter or
Return to accept the positioning and return to the Move requester.

Click  End,  and then click Adjust again.  This time, position the brush
near the bottom of the screen.  Press Enter or Return.

Change  the  Slow Out Edit box to 10.  Make sure the Count is set to 20,
and  then  click Draw.  The animation of the ball moving from the top to
the bottom of the screen is created.

After  the  animation  is  drawn, choose Control>Ping-pong from the Anim
menu  (or press 6) to play the animation forward and backward You should
see a bouncing ball.  Press Tab for added effect.

Let's  take  a  moment  to review what you just did.  You positioned the
Start and End frames to make the ball move from the top of the screen to
the bottom of the screen.  When you entered 10 in the Slow Out edit box,
you told Deluxe Paint that the brush should gradually increase its speed
over  the  first  10 frames and then move at the same speed for the lasr
ten.   You could have achieved the same effect by typing values into the
X  and  Y  edit boxes for the Start and End positions, but the method we
used is simpler and more intuitive.

More on the Move Requester

What  remains  in the Move requester is fairly straightforward.  For now
we'll  summarise  what each of the buttons does.  You'll find additional
explanat  ions and more examples of the features below, in the following
chapter, and in Reference.

Direction
 
The  Direction  options  control  the  direction  of  the  move  and the
direction of the recording.

The  Go  From  button  is  the  default setting for movement.  With this
option  selecred,  the  settings in the Move requester are used to paint
motion  away  from  the  point  where  you last stamped your brush.  For
example,  an X Distance of 200 moves to the right from where you stamped
your  brush,  over  the number of frames set in the Set Number of Frames
requester.

With the Come To option selected, the settings in the Move requester are
used to paint motion toward the point where you stamped your brush.  For
example,  an  X  Distance of 200 moves to the right to where you stamped
your  brush.  This option is most useful when it's easier to specify the
posi-  tion  where  you  want  the move to end than it is to specify the
beginning.    Remember that you want to stamp the brush on the frame you
want your animated move to end on.  Here's a practical example.

Assembling the Pieces

Suppose you want pieces of a picture to fly onto the screen and assemble
neatly  on  the  last  frame.  If the pieces are coming from off screen,
it's  diffi_  cult  to position the brush there for the beginning of the
move!    And  you  don't  want  to  calculate  backwards from the ending
position  to  figure  out  just  where  the  starting position should be
anyway.    The answer is to go to the last frame, paint down your brush,
and  tell  Deluxe  Paint  to  paint  the brush moving toward this point.
That's what the Come To option is all about.  Let's do it.

Clear all frames.

Choose  Frames>Set  # from the Anim menu and set the number of frames to
20.

Press Shift- 2 to go to the last frame of the animation.

Remember,  when  you  use the Come To option, you always paint the brush
down on the frame where you want the move to end.

Choose  Load  from  the Brush menu.  Load the file named pie1.brush from
the  Media disk.  Choose Palette>Use Brush Palette from the Colour menu.

Paint the brush down in approximately the middle of the screen.

Display the Move requester, and click Zero.

Set the X distance to 200.  Set the Y distance to -150.  Set the Z angle
to 180.  Click the Come To option.

Set Slow In to 5, and click Draw. Reset Slow Out to 0.

Play the anim that you have so far.

You'll  see  the  piece of pie chart fly in from off the screen.  Notice
how the Slow In setting of 5 frames smoothed the landing of the pie.  If
you  continue with the other two pieces to construct the full pie chart,
you'll  see  that  this Slow In element is very important to the look of
the animation.

NOTE 
You can also accomplish these types of assembly moves with the Start and
End buttons as well, without having to use Come To.

If  you  get  the  point of this exercise and don't want to complete the
flying  pie  chart,  you can continue on.  Otherwise, (or if you want to
continue  for fun) there are two more pieces of pie chart to load.  Load
each  one  and  stamp  it  in  place (with the black edges of the slices
overlapping)  and  set any move you want that will send the slice flying
onto the screen.

This  is  a  great  opportunity  to  experiment  with the Move requester
settings;  no  matter  what  numbers you enter, the pie will come to the
proper end point on frame 20.

Record
 
The  Record  options let you specify the direction in which Deluxe Paint
paints the frames of your move.

Forward is the default and prints the frames by flipping forward.

In  Place  causes  Deluxe  Paint to print all of the move on the current
frame.

Backward  paints the frames by flipping backward - this option is useful
with Trails.

Trails  and  Fill  are best explained by vivid example - you'll find two
exam ples of each in the next chapter.

Load

Displays  the Load Move requester.  From here you can load Move settings
that  you entered and saved with the Save Move requester.  When you load
a  move,  you are loading only the settings for the Move requester.  You
still  need  to  startup  your  brush in the correct position and on the
correct  frame  to  duplicate  the  move you had in mind.  If you aren't
absolutely  sure  of the setting you want to load, try using the feature
this  way:  stamp  your brush in the centre of the screen: load the move
settings  you  think you want; click Preview to see the move as it would
look  if it started from the middle of the screen.  This will give you a
good  idea of what the move looks like when it is actually drawn, and it
will  also  help  you  determine  where  your brush should be stamped to
produce the best move for these settings.  The requester works just like
the Load Picture requester.

Save

Displays  the  Save  Move  requester.    Deluxe  Paint lets you save the
settings  (though  not  the  images)  of any move you set up in the Move
requester.    You  can  load  a saved settings and use them as a kind of
template to automatical ly describe the movement of another object.  The
requester works just like the Save Picture requester.

Animated Brushes

So  far  we've  shown  you  how  to create an animation by painting on a
series  of  frames.    Deluxe  Paint  also  lets  you  select an area of
animation  as  a  brush and paint with it.  The result is that the brush
changes  while  you  paint,  and,  depending on whether or not the frame
changes, you create either anima tion or interesting effects.

In  Guided  Tour  (2),  we  showed  you  how  to load and use one of the
AnimBrushes  included on the Examples disk.  In this section, we'll show
you how to create a simple AnimBrush of your own and paint with it.

Creating an AnimBrush

To  begin, let's create a simple animation that we can easily pick up as
a brush.

Choose Palette>Default Palette from the Colour menu.

Clear  all of your animation frames.  Print a circle about the size of a
quarter  and  filled  with  a  gradient.  Pick your sphere up as a brush
using the right mouse button to pick it up off the screen.

Paint  your brush down and rotate it 360 degrees over twenty frames.  To
do this:

Display  the  Move  requester.   Click Zero to set all of the options to
their  defaults.  Set the Z Angle to 360 and select Brush angle.  Select
Cyclic and make sure the Count is 20.

Make sure Slow In and Slow Out are set to 0.

Click Draw.

Your  brush  will  rotate  in  place to create an animation that looks a
little like a spinning planet.

Picking Up an Animbrush

When  Deluxe  Paint  is finished painting the animation, step to frame 1
and choose AnimBrush>Pick Up from the Anim menu.

A  large  cross  hair  like  the one you use to pick up standard brushes
appears,  bur it is special in that it picks up from a series of frames.

Pick  up the sphere animation as a brush as you normally would using the
left mouse button.

In the Pick up AnimBrush requester that appears, 20 should appear in the
Number of Cels edit box.  If it does, click OK.

After  you click OK, you will see each of the frames flip as the area is
picked  up.    When  it's done, you have your AnimBrush.  Another way to
pick  up  an AnimBrush is to select the Brush Selector and hold down the
Alt key as you pick up an area of your animation.

Painting with y  adding  these  features  to  the face may not be as easy as it
seems,  especially  if  the face is moving.  This tutorial will show you
how  to  add the smile and the eyes to the face to the in-between frames
fairly easily using the LightTable.

Choose  LightTable>Settings...    from  the Effect menu.  The LightTable
Settings requester appears.

Click  on  the  first  two boxes on the far left of the requester.  This
will  activate  layer  #1  and  layer  #2.  You will notice a check mark
appear next to ll see a ball roll from left to right across the screen.

AnimBrush Settings

When you begin to combine AnimBrushes into large animations, you'll find
that  occasionally  you  want  to  change the rate at which an AnimBrush
trans  forms.    You might even want to change the direction in which an
AnimBrush  plays.    For  example,  you might want the gradient ball you
creat  ed above to turn in the opposite direction.  You can do this with
the AnimBrush Settings requester.

Choose AnimBrush>Settings from the Anim menu.

Direction

Click the (backward) direction button and click OK.

Now  your gradient circle will rotate in the opposite direction when you
paint with it.

The  other  direction  setting is called Ping Pong.  This setting causes
the brush to alternate between forward and backward play.

Duration

The  Duration  box in the AnimBrush Settings requester let's you specify
how  many stamps of the brush the AnimBrush uses to complete its cycle. 
If  the  Duration  number  is  larger than the number of cels, the brush
seems  to  move more slowly.  If the Duration number is smaller than the
number  of  cels,  the  brush  seems  to  move  more quickly.  Let's try
painting  normally  with  a  brush  and then paint with the Duration set
higher.

Choose  AnimBrush>Load  from  the  Anim menu.  Load the file named Sweep
from  the AnimBrush directory of your Examples disk.  Choose Palette>Use
Brush Palette from the Colour menu.

Display  the  AnimBrush Settings requester and set the Direction to play
forward.  (Notice that this animated brush has 1O cels).  Click OK.

Position  the  karate  figure on the left side of the screen.  Hold down
the  Alt  key  and  click the mouse button repeatedly without moving the
mouse to paint one cel of the animbrush on each of the 20 frames of your
animation.

You  now have an animation of a karate character performing a sweep kick
twice.    You'll notice that the sweep kick is fairly rapid.  Next we'll
paint  the same animbrush with a longer duration to slow down the motion
of the character.

Choose  AnimBrush>Settings  from the Anim menu.  Set the Duration box to
2O.   Set the Current box to 1 to put the brush at its first cel.  Click
OK.

Now  position  the  karate figure on the right side of the screen.  Hold
down  the  Alt  key and paint one cel of the AnimBrush on each of the 2O
frames.

When you've finished painting your AnimBrush on the 2O frames, press the
4 key at the top of the keyboard to play the animation.

Compare the speed of the two characters.  If you step through the frames
of  your  animation  one at a time, you'll see that the man on the right
takes  two  frames  before  changing position, while the man on the left
moves  on  every  frame.    You  can  also  use  Duration to speed up an
animbrush  by  setting the Durarion number lower than the number of cels
in  the  brush.  In that case, cels of the brush would be skipped as you
painted with the brush.

Note:  If you increase the duration of an AnimBrush, it is best to set a
durarion  that  is  a multiple of the number of cels in your brush.  For
example, an animbrush that has 10 frames will generally look best if you
set the duration to 10, 20, 30, etc.

Metamorphous AnimBrushes

Another way to create AnimBrushes is to transform the image and shape of
one  custom  brush  into  those  of a second custom brush.  This special
feature,  called metamorphosis, can create some stunning effects.  We'll
show  you  a  couple  of very simple examples just to give you the idea.
The  first  example  metaomorphoses between very different brushes.  The
second  example  meta  morphoses between two transformed versions of the
same brush.  In both examples, you'll use the Spare options in the Brush
menu to work with two custom brushes at the same time.

The Chicken and the Egg.

In  this  example,  you'll  load two different custom brushes (a chicken
egg) and create an AnimBrush that metamorphoses between the two.

Clear all frames of your animation.

If  the  Animation  Control  Panel is NOT on your screen, press Alt A to
display it.

Choose  Load from the Brush menu, and load the file named egg brush from
the  Brush  drawer  of the Media disk.  Choose Palette>Use Brush Palette
from the Colour menu.

Choose Spare>Brush>Spare from the Brush menu.

The  Brush>Spare  option  copies  your  custom brush to the spare custom
brush  buffer.    Now that you have the first brush in the spare buffer,
you can load a second brush without losing the first one.

Choose  Load from the Brush menu, and load the file named "chicken" from
the Brush drawer on Media.

Now you have two custom brushes what you can swap back and forth between
by  choosing  Spare>Brush<->Spare  from  the  Brush menu.  Try it if you
like.    Make  sure  that  the  chicken is your current brush before you
proceed.

Now  choose  Spare>Morph>Spare  from  the Brush menu (The Make AnimBrush
requester appears).

Enter  11  in  the edit box as the number of cels in your new brush, and
click OK.

It  will  take  a little while for Deluxe Paint to morph your two custom
brushes into one AnimBrush.

Go to AnimBrush settings on the Ping Pong direction button and click OK.

The  Ping  Pong option automatically plays your AnimBrush to the end and
back  again  repeatedly  without  doubling  the first or last cel of the
brush  This  means  that  the brush is effectively twice as long minus 2
cels.  (In this case, we had you create an 11 cel brush so that the Ping
Pong  version  would play over exactly 20 frames).  You'll find the Ping
Pong option very useful for converting linear brushes into cyclical ones
without having to create the extra frames.

Hold  down  the  Alt  key,  and click the brush repeatedly, to paint the
brush over 20 frames.  Press 4 to play the anim.

You'll  see an egg meramorphose into a chicken and back into an egg over
and over until you press the space bar to stop the animation.

The LightTable

The  LightTable lets you view a few frames of animation overlaid on each
other  like  clear  sheets of cellophane to help you position brushes or
paint  the  in  between frames of a character animation.  The LightTable
also  allows  you to set multiple levels of dim so that you can view any
frames  in  your  animation  behind (or after) your current frame.  This
enables  you  to  more  easily  see the frame you are working on.  (This
dimming effect is available in all modes except HAM)

Traditional  animators  work by painting the key positions or poses of a
char  acter  and then paint the "in-between" frames to create the smooth
transition  between  poses.    The  LightTable  is  ideal   for creating
animation with this tra ditional approach.  In the next few pages, we'll
introduce the basics of using the LightTable.
 
A  new  LightTable  feature   is   the   LightTable   Settings requester
(Effect>LightTable>Settings...)  You  can  use this requester to control
all  four LightTable layers - you can turn each layer on or off, set the
anima-  tion  frame  associated with the layer, and set 'dim' levels for
each  layer.  The Dim level for each layer can be set with a slider from
-255  (Maximum  brightness; even lighter than the original frame) to 255
(completely dimmed out).

Simple Tweening

We'll start out with a simple example of painting some in between frames
of an animation.

Choose  Load  from  the  Anim  pull  down  menu  and  load the animation
LightTable.anim

When  you  load  this  animation  you will notice that this is a 5 frame
animi-  tion  showing a face moving left to right.  You will also notice
that  the  smile  and  the  eyes  are  missing from frame 2 and frame 4.
Normally  adding  these  features  to  the face may not be as easy as it
seems,  especially  if  the face is moving.  This tutorial will show you
how  to  add the smile and the eyes to the face to the in-between frames
fairly easily using the LightTable.

Choose  LightTable>Settings...    from  the Effect menu.  The LightTable
Settings requester appears.

Click  on  the  first  two boxes on the far left of the requester.  This
will  activate  layer  #1  and  layer  #2.  You will notice a check mark
appear next to box #1 and #2.

Now  we  need  to tell it which frame you want it to affect and how much
dim  you want to add to this layer.  On Layer #1 change the frame box to
I and move the slider on the right until it is at -200.

This  means  that  layer  1  shows  1  frame  ahead of the frame you are
currently  on and it will appear somewhat transparent because of the dim
setting  that  you  adjusted.    Moving the slider to the left adds more
white to the image and moving it to the right will add more black.

NOTE 
The  LightTable settings will have optimum perfomance if your background
is  either  black  or white.  Once you are finished using the LightTable
you  can  colour  in  your  image  and change the background to whatever
coloyr you desire. 

On  Layer #2 change the frame box to -1 and move the slider on the right
until it is at -175.
 
This  means layer 2 will show 1 frame behind the frame you are currently
on.

Click OK to leave this requester.

Press  the  3 key on your keyboard (not the numeric keypad), to bring up
the GO TO FRAME requester.  Enter 2 in this requester and click OK.

Hold  Down  the  Alt key on your keyboard and press A at the same time. 
This  will bring up the anim control panel.  You will notice that button
#1  and  button  #2 to the right of the light bulb button is activated. 
This is because we selected these two layers in the light table settings
requester.

Press  the  light  bulb  button  on  this panel.  Notice that their is a
dimmed version of frame 1 and frame 3 superimposed on the current frame.
This gives the illusion of drawing on very thin paper.

Now  that the LightTable is activated draw the eyes and the mouth on the
face  on frame 2.  You may need to toggle the LightTable on and off with
the L key on your keyboard.

Go to frame 4 and draw the in-between frame here as well.

Pres  play  on the Anim control panel, turn on some music, and watch the
face move his head to the beat.

If  you  like  your  animation, save it before moving on to the next sec
tion.

Evolution of an Animation

In  this  section  we'll  look at how a traditional animation evolves in
Deluxe Paint V.

The Background

Turn off the LightTable

Delete all of your animation frames.

Choose   Load   from   the   Picture   menu   and    load    the picture
DoggieBackground.LoRes  from  the  Picture drawer on your Examples disk.
When the message appears asking whether or not you want to change format
to that of the file, click Yes.

The  picture  you  see  is a simple background image of a lawn and tree.
This  image  is  the background for the DoggieOutline animation.  Before
anima  tors  begin  to draw an animation, they create a background image
against  which  the animated characters will move.  The background image
can  be  as  complex  as a city scene or as simple as a straight line to
indicate  the  ground level for the characters to walk on.  Whatever its
level  of complexity the background helps keep all of the pieces working
in harmony.

In  the  next  brief section, we'll load a wire frame animation over the
back- ground image.

The Outline
 
Now  we'll take a look at the first step of creating an animation over a
background.
 
Choose Spare>Swap from the picture menu to put the background picture on
the spare page.

Load  the anim DoggieOutline from the Anim drawer on your Examples disk.
When  the  message  appears  to  ask if you want to change the number of
colours to that of the file, click No.

Note!  You just performed an important operation; you loaded an 8 colour
wire  frame  animation  into 16 colour mode.  Deluxe Paint lets you load
animations  into  screen formats that use more colours and thus makes it
possible  for  you to create the initial animation outline in just a few
colours  and  load  it into a format with more colours later on when you
want to paint the frames.

DoggieOutline  is  a few frames of a simple wireframe animation that was
created  by an animator who uses the traditional method of first drawing
the  outline  version  of  the  animation and then filling it with solid
colours or pat- terns to create a finished piece.  Traditional animators
call the outline version of an animation the "pencil test".

Turn  on  the  LightTable  to  view the animation frames overlaid on one
another.

Click  the  4  button  in  the Anim Control Panel to view the Spare page
behind the animation.

See how useful it is to view the background image through your animation
frames?   With the background visible, the animator can easily align the
ani- mated characters without having to worry about accidentally ruining
the  background  image.  Even if you aren't working on an animation, you
might find it useful to view a background image while you paint.  If you
turn  off  the  Dim  option  (from the LightTable submenu of the Effects
menu) you can view the background in its original colours and thus treat
your anima tion frame as a transparent page.

Choose  different  combinations  of  settings  (1,  2,  3, and 4) in the
LightTable  area  of the Anim Control Panel.  Move the Frame Slider back
and forth to view the different animation frames and background combined
with the various settings.

Merging in the Background

One of the powerful features of the LightTable is its ability to let you
merge  your  viewed  frames.    We'll  try  it  right now by merging the
background image into the image on one of the frames

Make  sure  LightTable is on, but turn off all of the LightTable options
other than 4 (for Spare).

You  should  see  your current frame against the background on the Spare
page with no other frames visible.
 
Choose LightTable>Merge from the Effects menu.
 
In  a  moment, your background is merged with your wireframe animation. 
Notice  that  the  LightTable  is automatically turned off after a merge
opera  tion.  This is done so you will see the frame in its actual state
and not be confused by LightTable effects.  One caution is in order: you
can't  Undo a merge, so you should be very careful that the image as you
see it in the LightTable is correct before you merge it.

Another  way to merge the background image with the frames is to use the
Spare>Merge  in  Back  option in the Picture menu.  This option lets you
merge  to the current frame, to a range of frames, or to all frames in a
single  operation.  This is generally the last step an animator takes in
the creation of a finished traditional piece.

The Painted Animation

Before  we  leave  this  section,  we'd  like  you  to load in a painted
animation  that  was  created  using  the  techniques  described in this
chapter.

TIP 
If  you  are  going  to  be saving your animations to video tape and you
don't  have  a lot of RAM in your Amiga, it might be best not to merge a
back  ground  into  your  animation.   Instead, you can create a painted
background  and  use a GenLock device to combine the video signal of the
Amiga  with  the signal of a camera focused on the painted background as
you record the two to a videotape.

Load the walk.anim from the Gallery drawer of the Extras disk.

This  High  Res  16  colour  animation  was  created  by  an animator at
Elecrtonic Arts using Deluxe Paint and traditional animation techniques.

Brush Axes vs Screen Axes

Now  that  we've covered pretty much everything else, it's time to cover
the  sticky  issue  of  brush  vs  screen axes.  We've tried to make the
example very clear but if you feel you need further help, review Chapter
Five:  Working  with  Perspective.  We should also mention that you will
not need to change the default settings for these options very Move  requester to stamp your brush saves you from having to
carefully  position  the  brush  on each frame.  You can also accomplish
this  by  positioning  the  brush  once  and  then  using  the  keyboard
equivalent Amiga Left Alt to click the left mouse button.  (We recommend
that  you  press  the Amiga key first and then press the Alt key quickly
once for a single stamp, because pressing the keys in the opposite order
will start animpainting over many frames).

Since  you  didn't  use all 40 of your fraen  Format  from  the Picture menu and change your format to
Lo-Res 320 x 200, Screen size page, and 32 colours palette.

Choose  Page  Size  from the Picture menu and change page size to Screen
320 x 200.  Click OK.

Choose  Frames>Set  # from the Anim menu and set the number of frames to
20.

Choose  Load  from  the  Brush menu and load the brush named DPaintTitle
brush from the Brush drawer on your Media disk.

Choose Palette>Use Brush Palette from the Colour menu.
 
You should now have a clear page and the DPaintTitle brush ready to work
with.

Choose Perspective>Do from the Effect menu to enter Perspective mode.
 
Move  the  brush  down  near  the  bottom of the screen and Press Shift-
Keypad 7 to flop the brush over on its back.

Click to paint down the brush.

To  flop  the brush over on its back you rotated it -90 degrees on the X
axis  (see  the  Title  Bar)  and shifted the brush axes so that they no
longer correspond to the screen axes.  Figure 6.8 illustrates the change
in the brush axes.

Now  if  you  use the Move requester to move the brush along the Y axis,
you  will  get  different  results  depending on whether or not you have
selected the Brush button.

Display the Move requester, and click Load.

When  the  Load   Move   requester   appears,   load   the   file called
Animbasics1.Mov from the Move drawer of Examples.

Click Preview from the Move requester.

The  wire  frame  model  of  your  brush moves upwards just as you would
expect when moving along the screen axis.

Click  the  Brush  button  beside the Distance edit boxes.  A check mark
appears in the box.  Now click Preview and watch the direction the brush
moves.
 
This  time  the  brush  moved  into the distance along the Y axis of the
brush.    As  Figure 6.15 above shows, the brush's Y axis is the same as
the screen's Z axis when you rotate backwards 90 degrees on X as we did.

Rotation on the Brush's Axis

You  may  have already guessed what will happen when we rotate the brush
on  its  own  axes rather than on the screen axes, but this is sometimes
difficult to visualise, so we'll give an example.

Click Cancel to close the Move requester.

Right-click  CLR  and  select  All  Frames in the requester to clear all
frames.

Choose  Perspective>Reset  from  the  Effect  menu  to  reset all of the
Perspective settings.

At this point you once again have your brush in the original orientation
and  are in Perspective mode.  Now we'll rotate the brush on the Z axis,
so  that  the X and Y axes of the brush no longer match the X and Y axes
of the screen.

Hold  down 2 on the keypad until the brush has rotated 45 degrees on the
Z  axis.    You'll  see the degrees of rotation in the right side of the
Title Bar.

Paint down the brush in the middle of the screen.

Press M to display the Move requester.

Click Zero in the requester.

Click  Load.  When the Load Move requester appears, load the file called
Animbasics2.Mov from the Move drawer of the Media disk.

Make sure the Brush button beside the Angle edit boxes don't have a tick
on it.

Click Preview.

With  the  settings above, you'll see the brush tumble toward the screen
on  the  X  axis.  Remember that the brush is rotating on the Screen's X
axis.  Now let's look at a rotation on the brush's X axis.

In  the  Move  requester  click  the  Brush button beside the Angle edit
boxes; click Preview.

This  time  the  brush  spins  around its own X axis instead of tumbling
toward  the  screen.   The idea is the same for all rotations, though it
isn't  always  easy to predict what a complex set of rotations will look
like.   You'll probably find that most of your moves can be accomplished
with rotation around only.

TIP
If  this  last  exercise  was  less  informative than you had hoped, you
should  probably review the chapter on Perspective.  There you will find
more  examples  that  might  help  you  better understand the difference
between screen and brush angles.

Now  that  you've  seen  some  of Deluxe Paint's animation features, you
might  like  to  play  around  a  little.   Load the animations from the
Examples  disk and play them.  There are several AnimBrushes on the disk
that  you  can  combine  with  the  Ocean  Background.picture to form an
aquarium  scene.   When you feel you're ready to see some more of Deluxe
Paint's  animation  features,  move onto the next chapter.  It shows you
how  to create some interesting animation effects by combining different
features of the program.


CHAPTER 7 - ANIMATION EFFECTS
-----------------------------

This chapter introduces several interesting animation effects and a host
of  animation  tips.    We strongly recommend that you work through this
chapter  and complete the Amazing Bouncing Ball section, which serves as
a good test of your knowledge of Deluxe Paint.

Effects

In  the  following  sections  you'll  create  some interesting animation
effects.      Many of these effects are not obvious, so it is worth your
time to follow closely and work along.

NOTE:  As you begin each section that uses the Move requester, reset the
requester  to its default settings.  Our instructions will tell you only
which  settings  you  need  to change out of the defaults when you first
open  the requester.  Figure 7.1 shows the Move requester in its default
settings; use this as a guide if you need to check your own settings.

Before You Begin

Make  sure  you  are in Lo Res mode with 32 colours.  Set your number of
frames to 40.  Make sure you are using the Compressed memory model.

Make sure FastFB is selected in the Prefs menu.

Quick Effects

These effects are good examples of how multiple features of Deluxe Paint
combine to make simple animation easy to create.

Receding or Approaching Shapes

This  technique  creates  the  effect  of  a  shape  moving off into the
distance  Notice  that  this involves using a keyboard command while you
paint with the mouse button down.

Right  click  the  largest round brush and stretch the brush to be about
the size of a nickel.

Select the Dotted Freehand tool.

Position the brush near the upper left corner of the screen.

Hold  down the Alt key and begin animpainting in a curve downward toward
the  lower  right area of the screen.  As you paint, release the Alt key
and  press the - (minus) key repeatedly to shrink the brush as it moves.

When  you  play  back  the animation, the gradual shrinking of the brush
makes  it  look  as  though  it is receding into the distance.  Play the
animation  backwards,  or  create a new one using the = (equals or plus)
key to enlarge the brush, and the brush will appear to approach from the
distance.    This example used a built-in brush, but you can do the same
thing with a custom brush.

Brush Erosion

The  Edge>Trim command in the Brush menu makes it easy to have an object
dissolve into nothing.  You stamp the brush, trim some away, step to the
next  frame,  and stamp again.  The real trick is to use the keyboard to
do all of your frame changes, trimming, and brush stamps.

Select black as your background colour and clear all of your frames.

Load  the  DPaintTitle  brush  from your Media disk.  Choose Palette>Use
Brush  Palette  from  the Colour menu.  Stamp the brush in the middle of
frame 1.

Display  the  Move requester.  Click Zero to set all of the Distance and
Angle edit fields to 0.

Set  the Count to 1.  Make sure that all of the other options are set to
their defaults.  Click Draw.

Press  Shift  0  to  trim  the brush.  Press Shift-m to display the Move
requester  and  click  Draw.    Repeat this step until the brush has com
pletely disappeared, (It will take about 11 frames).

Using  the  Move  requester to stamp your brush saves you from having to
carefully  position  the  brush  on each frame.  You can also accomplish
this  by  positioning  the  brush  once  and  then  using  the  keyboard
equivalent Amiga Left Alt to click the left mouse button.  (We recommend
that  you  press  the Amiga key first and then press the Alt key quickly
once for a single stamp, because pressing the keys in the opposite order
will start animpainting over many frames).

Since  you  didn't  use all 40 of your frames, we'll use the Control>Set
Range option in the Anim menu to play just the frames you painted.

Choose  Control>Set  Range in the Set Play Range requester, set the From
field to 1 and the To field to 12.  Click Range.  Click OK.

Now  press  4  to play your animation and you'll see your brush dissolve
repeatedly  until you press space bar or click to stop the animation (If
the  animation is moving too quickly press the left arrow key to slow it
down).

Before  you leave this example, choose Control>Set Range again and click
the All Frames button.

Animated Fades

This  example  shows you how to use the Fade feature in Deluxe Paint V's
Move  requester.   We will create a simple 40 Frame animation of a title
fading out to the background.

Load the DPaintTitle brush from the Brush drawer on your Media disk.

Choose  Palette>Use Brush Palette from the Colour menu.  Select the dark
grey from your palette as your background colour.

Clear all frames of you animation and go to frame 1 (Shift-1)

Press  M  (Shift  m) to display the Move requester.  Click Zero to clear
out  the  distance and angle fields.  Set the count to 40 if not already
so

Click  Start  and then click Adjust and place the Brush in the centre of
your  screen.  Press Return or Enter to exit Adjust mode.  Make sure the
Fade slider is it 0.

Click  End  and  then  change the Fade slider to 255 (all the way to the
right).

For  added effect, type 360 in the Z angle edit field with Brush checked
on.

Click  Draw  and  when  the move requester is done with your anima tion,
press  6  to  watch it fade out and back in as it ping pongs.  Keep your
animation  in  memory  you  may  want to use it for the next animi- tion
effect tip.

The  larger your palette size and the more like colours you have between
the brush and your background, the better your fade turns out.

Often  an  animator  wants  to  pause on a certain frame for a second to
several  seconds  to  give an animation that certain effect or feel.  In
the  past,  the  only  way  you  could  do  that  in Deluxe Paint was to
duplicate  the  frame  you wanted to pause on several times.  This works
fine, but it wastes precious memory you could be using for other things.

Deluxe  Paint  V now allows you to perform Anim Pauses on a single frame
or  multiple  frames without adding the memory overhead.  Here's how you
can use it:

Using  the  animation  you  created in the last effects tutorial we will
modify  the  animation  so  that  the  first  frame pauses for 3 seconds
continues  at full speed, then pauses in the last frame for 3 seconds as
well.  Here's how to do it:

Go to frame one (Shift-1).

Select Frames>Set Frame Rate from the Anim menu.

Click on the Vary by Frame button (this tells Deluxe Paint you are about
to create a variable frame rate animation).

Click in the Jiffies edit field and type in 180 (this is assuming you're
in  NTSC  1/60 frame rate).  Hence to get a 3 second pause we have multi
plied 60 X 3 = 180.  In PAL modes you would type in 150 or 50 X 3.  As a
rule  of  thumb just remember this: Scan Rate or Frame Rate multi- plied
by  the number of seconds you would like to pause is equal to the number
of Jiffies you must enter in the edit field.

Make  sure  that  Current Frame is selected in the bottom portion of the
requester.  Click OK.

Play  the animation (press 4), you'll notice that the first frame pauses
for approximately 3 seconds.

Let's put a pause at the end. Go to the last frame (Shift-2).

Select Frames>Set Frame Rate from the Anim menu again.

Click  in the Jiffies edit field and type in the same number you did for
frame 1 (180 for NTSC, 150 for PAL).

Again, make sure Current Frame is selected and click OK.

Play  the  animation  forward  (press  4)  or ping pong it (press 6) and
you'll see that you've easily modified an existing animation to pause at
the  beginning  and  end very easily.  You may never have to duplicate a
frame for speed effect ever again.

Animations you have modified using vary by frame will save out with that
information,  so  that  when  you play them back in the Deluxe Player or
reload them into Deluxe Paint you don't have to set up the pauses again.


Expanding Circles

This  example  shows  you how to create the effect of a circle expanding
out ward like a "sonar blip".  You use two Deluxe Paint features to help
you  align  the circles and make them grow uniformly: Grid and the 2 key
(the Next Frame keyboard equivalent).

Clear  all frames of your animation and go to frame 1.  Turn on the Grid
with X and Y spacing of 8.

Select  the  second  largest round built in brush and paint a dot in the
centre of the screen.

Choose the Unfilled Circle tool.

Start  from  the  dot  in the centre of the screen and drag out a circle
that  is  just  one grid point wider than the dot, but don't release the
mouse  button.   Press the 2 key to move to the next frame.  Now release
the mouse button.

At this point you have a dot on frame 1 and a small circle on frame 2.

Continue  to  follow  the  last  step  above  to paint larger and larger
circles  on successive frames until your circle reaches the sides of the
screen.

When  you play your animation, you'll see one circle expanding outward. 
If  you're  adventurous,  try  picking  up  your  entire animation as an
AnimBrush and animpainting it onto your existing animation by sitting it
on  frame  5  This  will  give you an animation of two circles expanding
outward.

Trails

This example demonstrates the use of Trails.  You'll find this option in
the Move requester makes it easy to create impressive title effects.

Clear all frames.

Load  the  brush  DpaintTitle  from  the Media disk.  Choose Palette>Use
Brush Palette from the Colour menu.

Press Shift-2 to go to the LAST frame. You should be on frame 40.

Stamp  the  brush  at  the  bottom  of  the  screen.    Display the Move
requester.    Click Zero.  Set the Z Distance to -1500.  Select the Come
To  option  for your Move Direction, (Make sure the Fade slider is reset
to 0)

The  Come To option tells Deluxe Paint that the position of the brush is
where  you  want the animation to end - you want the animation to " come
to" the brush position and frame.

Click Preview.

There  is  a  slight  delay, and then the preview plays, starting at the
distant position [Z=1500] and coming closer.

Instead of clicking Draw, click Trails, and let it record.

By clicking Trails, you tell Deluxe Paint to carry the cumulative effect
of  each frame forward as it draws.  The result is that the brush leaves
a trail as it moves through three dimensional space in your animation.

Press 5 on the main keyboard for a singly play of the animation.

For added effect, add a Fade to the start or end of the animation.

The Slinky

The  Slinky  is a modified version of the standard Trails title.  You've
probably  seen  this  effect on many television sports shows.  A special
feature  of  this effect is that it uses the Stencil in combination with
the  Move  requester  This  combination  can  be very powerful when used
properly.   When a stencil is used with the Move requester, Deluxe Paint
remakes the stencil for each frame as it renders the move.

Clear all frames.
 
Load  the  DPaintTitle  brush  if  you  don't  already  have it.  Choose
Palette>Use Brush Palette.

Step  to  the  middle  frame of your total.  For example, if you have 40
frames as we suggested, move to frame 20 by typing 3 to access the Go To
Frame requester.  Stamp the brush down near the centre of the screen.

Display  the  Move  requester.    Click Zero.  Make sure that both Brush
buttons are unchecked.  Also, be sure Fade is set to 0 at Start and End.

Set the Z Distance to -1500, and set the Z angle to 0.  Set the Count to
20.  Select the Come To option.  Click Trails.

As  in  the Trails effect above, Deluxe Paint paints your title with the
cumula tive image carried forward to each successive frame.

Step to frame 40 (use Shift-2 to go to the last frame quickly).

Now you need to create a stencil so you can "paint behind".

Choose  Stencil>Make  from  the  Effect  menu.     In   the Make stencil
requester,  click the background colour (black), click Invert, and click
Make to lock all colours but the background.

Display  the  Move requester.  Leave all of the other settings the same,
but select the backwards Record Direction ().  Click Trails.

Because you reversed the Record direction, Deluxe Paint begins this move
by  by  painting  on  frame  40.   It then steps one frame backwards and
paints  the the cumulative effect of frame 40 and the new brush position
on  frame  39.    This  39.   This is where the Stencil comes into play.
Because  the  colours  in  the title the title are stenciled, the second
brush  stamp  appears  to  be painted "behind" the single image that was
stamped  on  frame  40.  Though, in fact, it was painted over the single
image.

The  resulting animation should have your brush moving from the distance
leaving  Trails,  until  it gets to the nearest position, at which point
the Trails start erasing from the back forward.

Before  you  move  on  to  the next effect, choose Stencil>Free from the
Effect menu.

Curving Titles

This example shows you how to create the effect of a title moving across
the  screen  on  a  curved path using the curve tool instead of the Move
requester.

Clear all frames.

Load  the  DPaintTitle.brush  from  your Media disk.  Choose Palette>Use
Brush Palette from the Colour menu.

Go  to  the last frame (frame 40) and stamp the brush near the bottom of
the screen.  Click Undo.

TIP
Clicking  UNDO  immediately  after  stamping the brush helps ensure that
your results are what you expect.  This is particularly important if you
are  using a Brush Mode in your move, because Deluxe Paint paints on the
screen you stamped on when it paints the move, and stamping twice on the
same screen will give a different result from a single stamp.

Of course, with Deluxe Paint V you can also use the Start and End Adjust
buttons to place your starting or ending positions without stamping down
the brush at all.

Display  the  Move  requester  and click Zero.  Be sure Record is set to
forward () and set the Count to 40.

Set the Z distance to -1200. Select the Come To option. Click Draw.

Deluxe  Paint  paints  the  brush  moving  toward  the  screen  from the
distance.

Pick up the animated title as an AnimBrush.  (Be sure you are on frame 1
when  you  pick up the brush and that you enclose the entire area of the
move - the bottom half of the screen in this case).

Press  Alt-x  to place the brush handle in the lower right corner of the
brush so you will be able to click it off-screen.

Clear all frames.

Right  click the Curve tool to display the Spacing requester.  Click the
N Total button and set the total to 40.  Click OK.

The  Spacing requester lets you tell Deluxe Paint exactly how many brush
stamps you want to use to paint your curves, lines, and unfilled shapes.
By  setting  the  Spacing  to N Total of 40, you'll get 40 stamps of the
brush.    Since you have 40 frames, when you use the brush to animpaint,
you'll get one stamp of the brush on each frame

Position the brush at the left side of the screen and midway between the
top and bottom.

Hold  down  the  Alt  key and the left mouse button and drag down to the
lower  right  corner  of the screen.  (You'll see your title drawn along
the path of your curve).

Release  the  mouse button and define the shape of the curve while still
holding  down  the  Alt  key.    When  the  curve  is  a shape you like,
left-click to begin animpainting.

When  Deluxe  Paint is finished painting your curve, press 5 to play the
ani  mation once.  You'll see the brush move into view and curve its way
down to the lower right corner of the screen.

Tumbling 3D Objects

Like  the  Curving  Title  effect above, this effect also uses the curve
tool to move an AnimBrush along a curved path.  However, in this effect,
you use an object that looks three dimensional, and you tumble it at the
same time you move it towards the screen.

Clear all frames.

Load  the  brush  named  GradientCube  from the Brush drawer on your Art
disk.  Choose Palette>Use Brush Palette from the Colour menu.  Go to the
last  animation  frame (frame 40).  Stamp the brush in the centre of the
screen.  Click Undo.

Display the Move requester.  Set the Z Distance to -1200 and the Z Angle
to 720 (with Brush check).  Select the Come To option.  Click Draw.

Deluxe  Paint  paints  your cube rotating 720 and moving toward you from
the  distance.  Now you need to pick up this tumbling object as a brush.
You  must  pick  up the entire animated area, beginning at frame 1 where
you see only a tiny object.  Here's how:

Click the Brush Selector.

Go to frame 40, where the object is largest.

From  this frame you can easily see how large an area you need to select
to enclose the entire animated area of the gradient cube.

Hold  down  the  Alt key and enclose the object with your crosshair, but
don't release the mouse button.  (You can release the Alt key).

Press 2 to step forward to frame 1. Release the mouse button.

Now  you  have  your  AnimBrush of the object tumbling and moving toward
you.   In the next step, you use the curve tool and Spacing to give it a
trajec tory across the screen.

Clear all frames.

Right click on the Curve tool. Set the Spacing requester to N Total 40.

Place  the  brush  handle  in the lower right corner of the brush so you
will be able to click it off-screen.

Press Shift 7 to go to the first cel of the AnimBrush.

Position the brush at the left side of the screen and midway between the
top and bottom.

Hold  down  the  Alt  key and the left mouse button and drag down to the
lower right corner of the screen.

Release  the  mouse button and define the third point of the curve while
still  holding  down  the  Alt key.  When the curve is a shape you like,
click to begin animpainting.

Notice that even though the cube has only two true dimensions, the combi
nation  of  the three-sided view and the tumble make it appear as though
the brush is three dimensional.

Planetary Orbits - Brush Handles.

This  example  shows  you  how to create an animation that simulates the
orbit  of a planet.  This demonstrates the importance of brush handles -
when  you  rotate  a  brush,  the rotation always takes place around the
brush handle.

Paint  a circle about the size of a quarter and filled with a gradient. 
Pick the circle up as a brush.
 
Clear all frames.

Stamp a copy of the brush in the middle of the screen.
 
Display  the  Move  requester  and  click Draw to draw 40 frames of your
brush.

If  you  are holding the brush by its corner, first choose Handle>Rotate
(Alt-x)  from  the  Brush  menu  until the brush is centred.  Now choose
Handle>Place from the Brush menu.
 
Your brush now has a cross-hair running through the centre of it.

Position  the  brush about an inch and a half above the circle you paint
ed  in  the middle of the screen.  Hold down the left mouse button, drag
straight  down  to  the  centre of the ball you painted, and release the
mouse button

Now your brush is offset from the cursor by about two inches.  We'll use
this brush to create an orbiting planet.

Point  at  the  centre of the stamped circle with the cursor and click. 
(This  stamps  your  circle  brush above the circle in the middle of the
screen).
Display the Move requester. Set the Z Angle to 360. Click Draw.

Play  the  animation  back and you'll see that your planet orbits around
the central circle!

Using  the  brush  handle  effectively becomes a little more complicated
when  you  rotate over more than one axis, but you might want to spend a
little time trying different settings to see the effects you can create.
