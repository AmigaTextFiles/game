Rest for at least 10 to 15 minutes per hour while playing a game.



INTRODUCTION
------------

Deluxe  Paint  V  is an upgraded and enhanced version of Elevtronic Arts
premier  colour  paint  program  for  the  Amiga,  Deluxe Paint IV.  Its
improved  and  more versitile range of paint and animation features were
designed  to  meet  the basic needs of amateur artists, while satisfying
the rigorous requirements of graphics and video professionals.

If you're new to computer graphics, you'll want to read the next section
For New Artists Only, before you move on to the rest of the introduction
to  Deluxe  Paint V.  If you're an experienced computer graphics artist,
you might want to move directly to About this Manual.

FOR NEW ARTISTS ONLY

You  are  about  to  discover  that  Deluxe  Paint V can help you create
prototypes  of your designs more quickly and easily than any traditional
medium.  You'll move from inspiration to execution in minutes instead of
hours.    We  think that Deluxe Paint V's power and versitility can help
you develop a new approach to graphic art.  You'll soon find that Deluxe
Paint  V  is  ideal  for  creating  graphic  design  comps,  video   and
traditional  animation,  video titling, desktop presentations, and other
desktop publishing applications.

Deluxe  Paint  V  lets  you  do  things  that would be difficult, if not
impossible,  using  traditional  methods.    For example, you can easily
rotate  a  picture  or  flip  it  to create its mirror image.  Shrink or
expand an image as you wish, pick it up, and place it precisely.  Or you
can  create  a mathematically exact tonal range for your colours just by
specifying  the  beginning  and ending shades and the number of steps in
between.

You  can  also  move  images from one part of the picture to another, or
copy an image and paste it anywhere in your picture.  Create a forest of
leaves  just  by  drawing  a  single leaf and pasting it throughout your
picture.   And make global changes to the colours in your artwork with a
few keystrokes.

Deluxe  Paint  will  also  help  you  find more efficient ways to create
traditional drawing, painting, and animation effects.

You  can  save  all  your  work  on  disk  so  you  don't have to create
everything  from scratch each time you work on a design.  This means you
can  collect  a  library  of  images  (called clip art) to use in future
designs.    Because you can save versions of your picture as you go, you
can  always  return  to an earlier state of a design and pick it up from
there,  if you like.  Finally because you can print as many originals of
a  picture as you need, or make unlimited copies of your data disks with
no degradarion from one generarion to the next, there need never be just
one original of a picture to lose or spill coffee on.

So,  welcome  to the world of computer generated art.  As you begin this
great  artistic adventure, we think you'll be impressed and delighted by
Deluxe Paint V.

ABOUT THIS MANUAL

When you need help or simply want more information about Deluxe Paint V,
this  manual  is  the best resource.  But you don't have to memorise the
manual  to  master the program.  We've organised the information here so
you can quickly learn how to use the program in a manner that best suits
your style and experience.

The  manual  assumes  that  you know your way around your Amiga.  If you
just  recently  acquired  your  computer familiarise yourself with Amiga
terminology and techniques before using Deluxe Paint V.  You do not have
to  become  an  Amiga  expert.    But, selecting, dragging, pointing and
clicking  should  not  be  a mystery to you; nor should menus, submenus,
windows, and requesters sound strange.

If  any  of  these  terms  are  unfamiliar, take a few minutes to browse
through  your  Amiga  User's  guide,  and  make  sure you read Hints and
Reminders  while  using  Deluxe  Paint,  below  for  some  special tips.
Knowledge  of basic Amiga operations and features will help you learn to
use Deluxe Paint V quickly and adeptly.

EVERY USER SHOULD READ

Before  starting to work with Deluxe Paint V there are three things that
every user ought to do.

Read  Whats  New at the end of this introduction for a brief description
of Deluxe Paint V's exciting new features.  It's especially designed for
artists  who  are  familiar  with previous versions of Deluxe Paint, and
beginners will also find much useful information.

Briefly  review  the  Table  of  Contents  to  locate  areas  of special
interest.  Note that Chapters 4-7 assume familiarity with the more basic
parts of the program.

Carefully  read  Getting  Started  to  be  sure  you have all the proper
equipment  and  software.    If  you  have  a  hard  drive,   follow the
instructions  in  Installing on a Hard Drive below for installing Deluxe
Paint V on it.

After  you've  read  Whats  New,  reviewed  the  Table  of Contents, and
installed  DeluxePaint  V,  use the manual in whatever way suits you and
your  work.   Follow our Guided Tour or strike off on your own.  You can
always  consult  Reference  if  you  need help or want more information.
Here  are  a  few  approaches  you  can  take  to  learn Deluxe Paint V,
depending on your knowledge of computer graphics programs.

BEGINNING COMPUTER GRAPHICS USERS

Work  though  Getting  Started  and  the  Guided  Tour - in order and in
detail.    These  chapters  describe the fundamentals of the program and
introduce  some  advanced techniques.  You'll start creating with Deluxe
Paint  V right away and learn about its more complex functions as you go
along.    After  you've  worked  through the Guided Tour move On to what
interests you.  We highly recommend Chapter 4, Painting Tutorials.  Keep
the  manual  close  by  so you can consult Reference to learn more about
other program features when you're ready.

EXPERIENCED COMPUTER GRAPHICS USERS

If  you're already familiar with Deluxe Paint IV quickly scan Whats New,
for  new information.  You'll find an introduction to some of the unique
paint  features of Deluxe Paint V there.  Move on whenever you're ready.
Use  Chapters  4  -  8,  and the Appendixes to learn more about powerful
program  features  like  colour  mixing,  the  LightTable, stencils, and
animation.

THOSE WHO DONT READ MANUALS

If  you  don't  read  manuals  as a rule, we still hope that you'll read
Getting Started.  Keep this manual nearby so you can consult it when you
need to.

HINTS AND REMINDERS WHILE USING DELUXE PAINT V

Manual Conventions
Several  special  elements  in  the  manual  text  are  designed to make
learning Deluxe Paint V easier.

Filled  squares  indicate  action  items  or  steps.    They mark how to
sections  that  present  something you should do to understand a program
feature or function.

Outline  squares  indicate  a  list of features, functions, or contents.
They do not indicate action items.

A  note  preceded  by  this  symbol   indicates   important   additional
information,  a  warning,  or  a  condition.  Be sure to read every item
that's labelled this way.

DeluxePaint V's menu options and keystrokes appear in the text in simple
boldface  type.  Every menu option is thoroughly described in Chapter 8,
Reference.

This  special  monospace  typeface  indicates characters that you should
type.

Refers  to  the  Return  key  (sometimes  called  the Enter key) on your
keyboard.  Return is indicated on some keyboards by the Enter symbol.

Refers  to  the Backspace key indicated by the left arrow symbol on some
keyboards.

Refers to the Control key (Ctrl) on your keyboard.

Refers  to  the  Amiga  key(s)  on  the bottom row of your keyboard Some
computers show these as Commodore key(s) "C=".

You  can access many Deluxe Paint tools and functions directly from your
keyboard.   For example, typing the capital letter S activates, the Show
Page option, just as if you had chosen the option from the Picture menu.
These  keyboard  commands  ARE case sensitive, so when we show a command
that requires a capital letter, like Q for Quit, make sure you hold down
the  Shift key as you type the letter.  As you become more familiar with
the  program,  you'll  find  that  these keyboard shortcuts can save you
time.

USING THE MOUSE

In  this  manual,  we'll  use  the  term  click  a few different ways to
describe some standard mouse actions

CLICK means press and quickly release the left mouse button.

DOUBLE CLICK means press and quickly release the left mouse button twice.

RIGHT CLICK means press and release the right mouse button.

DRAGGING THE MOUSE

When you are asked to DRAG the mouse to perform some operation, we mean,
hold  down  the  LEFT  mouse button and move the mouse, unless otherwise
indicated.

PAINTING WITH THE MOUSE

The  two  mouse buttons let you switch between foreground and background
colours while painting.

Pressing  the  left  mouse  button  paints  with  the current foreground
colour;  pressing  the  right  mouse  button  paints  with  the  current
background  colour.    You can paint with either colour using any of the
painting  tools.   Likewise, clicking a colour in the palette selects it
as  your  foreground colour, while right clicking a colour selects it as
your background colour.

REQUESTERS

Requesters  display items that you can choose.  They always require some
input from you.  Some requesters let you modify the way a tool operates;
other requesters let you load or save files.

ACTION BUTTONS

Action buttons activate operations or commands made in the requester, or
respond  to  a  prompt.    Clicking  an action button usually closes the
requester.  The OK button accepts any changes made to settings since the
requester was opened.  Cancel closes the requester without accepting any
changes.

The  highlighted  item  in  the requester is the one currently selected.
Any action buttons you click will affect the item currently selected.

SCROLL BARS

Scroll bars are used to move (scroll) through a list of items that's too
large  to  appear  in one window of a requester.  For example, there are
too  many  file  names  to  fit  in one window of Figure 2.  You have to
scroll the window to see the names of files that are not visible.  There
are three ways to scroll through a list.

Click the arrows on either end of the scroll bar.

Drag the scroll box to either end of the scroll bar.

Click the shaded area on either side of the scroll box.

EDIT BOXES

Edit  boxes  let  you  enter  file  names  or other information from the
keyboard.    Click  in  the  edit  box to place the cursor then type any
prinitable  characters.    Press  the backspace key to delete characters
left of the cursor.  Press Del to delete characters under the cursor.

Review  these  brief  descriptions if you see something on screen that's
unfamiliar.    When you're ready to paint, move on to Chapter 1, Getting
Started.

CHECK BOXES

Check  boxes  indicate if an item is turned on or off.  When on, the box
has  a  check mark.  When off the box is empty.  To change the check box
setting, click on the box.

CYCLE GADGETS

Cycle  gadgets  contain  a list of options.  The displayed option is the
selected  option.    Position the cursor over the cycle gadget and click
the  selection  button  to  cycle  through the options.  Cycle backwards
through the options by Shift clicking.

RADIO BUTTONS

Radio  buttons  allow  you  to  select one option from a fully displayed
list.  Each option in the list has a radio button next to it.

Selected  radio buttons are highlighted and appear indented.  Unselected
radio buttons are one colour and appear raised above the screen.

Select  a  radio  button  by clicking on it.  Clicking on a radio button
deselects any previously selected option in the list.

CHAPTER 1 - GETTING STARTED
---------------------------

This chapter briefly describes the contents of your Deluxe Paint package
and the computer hardware and software you will need to use the program.
It also describes how to:

Organise your disks
Install Deluxe Paint on a hard drive
Start Deluxe Paint
Open a file
Quit the program

SOFTWARE

Your Deluxe Paint package contains four (4) floppy disks.

The  Program  disk  contains  the  installation  program, Deluxe Paint V
program, Deluxe Paint font, Deluxe Paint Libraries, ReadMe file, and the
Deluxe Player animation player.  The Deluxe Player program lets you play
your  animations  outside of Deluxe Paint (you'll find information about
the Deluxe Player in Appendix C).

The  Media  disk contains textures, media types, brushes, example moves,
colour sets, and two colour fonts that you can use in your own work.

The  Examples  disk  contains  pictures, a few animation files, and some
AnimBrushes  to give you some ideas of what you can do with Deluxe Paint
V's animation features.

The Extras disk contains the gallery, AGA art, and system patches.

THE READ ME FILE

Before  you do anything else, read the ReadMe file on your Program disk.
This  file contains information about the program that was not available
before the manual went to press.  To read the ReadMe file:

Double click on the ReadMe icon.

This  opens  a  text window that, at a minimum, lists the title, version
number,  and  copyright information about the program.  If you need help
using  the  ReadMe file, press h on the keyboard to see a screen of text
viewer key board commands.  To exit the ReadMe file:

Press q on the keyboard

HARDWARE

To use Deluxe Paint V you need:

An Amiga computer with at least 2 megabytes (MB) of random access memory
(RAM).   Four MB of RAM (or more) are highly recommended For AGA models,
2 MB are required (4 MB required for 24-bit RGB buffer editing);

Amiga DOS 2.04 or greater (2.1 or 3.1 recommended):

Analogue RGB or Multisync Colour Monitor;

One  floppy  drive  and  a  hard  drive or two floppy drives (hard drive
highly recommended):

If  your  Amiga has only floppy drives, we recommend that you not double
click on file icons to start DeluxePaint and load a file.  Instead start
Deluxe  Paint  and  then  load  the  file  by  choosing  Load   from the
appropriate menu.

Some initialised floppy disks, or a hard drive for saving your work.

If  you  want  to  print  the  artwork you create, you'll need a printer
capable of reproducing black and white or colour graphics.  Consult your
Amiga  Users  Guide  for information about connecting printers and other
peripherals to your computer.

RECOMMENDED CONFIGURATION

Amiga 68040 CPU, Amiga DOS 2.1 or higher, AGA chipset, 2 MB of Chip RAM,
2 MB Fast RAM, 100 MB hard drive, multisync monitor.

ORGANISING YOUR DISKS

We assume that you already know how to initialise and copy disks, create
and rename drawers, and move files from one disk to another.  If you are
not  familiar  with  all  of these basic actions, we suggest you consult
your Amiga Users Guide before going any further.

INSTALLING ON A HARD DISK

If  you  use a hard disk drive, you will probably want to install Deluxe
Paint  on  it  (if  you don't have a hard disk, see Installing on Floppy
Disks  below)  The  following steps assume that you started the computer
with a standard Workbench that has been configured properly to support a
hard disk.

IMPORTANT

You'll  need  a  minimum  of 1 MB (3.5 MB recommended) of available disk
space and to install Deluxe Paint V on your hard drive.  If you choose a
mini mum install, the art samples will not be installed.

The  install  program  will  install  Deluxe Paint V to a drawer of your
choice,  and lets you copy the program fonts, which need to be installed
in your sys tem, in your FONTS; drawer.

1.    Insert Program Disk into drive DF0;, The Program Disk icon appears

make  new  copies  if  necessary.   Also, make sure you have one or more
blank initialised disks handy for saving your work.

FLOPPY USERS

Before installing on floppy disks, read the following notes:

You must have four (4) formatted Amiga disks prepared before you install
to floppies.

Floppy disk installation requires two disk drives.

When  prompted  to  insert a Workbench disk during a floppy install, you
must insert your Workbench disk in DF1; (not DF0:)

You  must  have  the rexxsupport.library and rexxsyslib.library files in
your sys:libs drawer.  The program will not function without them.

When  you  are  sure  you  have met the above requirements, proceed with
floppy installation;

1.  Insert Program Disk into drive DF0; The Program Disk icon appears on
your workbench.  Double click the disk icon to open the disk.

2.    Double click on the ReadMe icon.  The ReadMe file contains informa
tion  that didn't make into this manual before press time.  When you are

if  you'd  like  to  run  the progtam now.  Click Yes.  The registration
screen appears.

5.   At the registration screen, enter your name, your company name, and
the  Deluxe  Paint registration number on the registration card included
in your Deluxe Paint package.

6.   When you're finished with registration, click Use.  Deluxe Paint is
now  installed  on  your  floppy  disks, and the Screen Format requester
appears (see below).

STARTING DELUXE PAINT V

Double click the Deluxe Paint program icon to run the application.

When  you start Deluxe Paint, the program presents a requester (a window
that  requires  some  input  from  you)  inviting you to select a screen
format.   The screen format requester is updated from Deluxe Paint IV or
AGA, and contains new options.

You  can  choose  your  display  mode  from the list that appears in the
Choose  Display Mode window or type in your own mode in the Display Mode
text  gadget.    Text  Overscan and Standard Overscan dimensions are now
found in the Preferences directory of your system.

There  are  several  factors that determine which screen modes appear in
the Choose Display Mode window; The chipset you're using, the version of
your  operating  system, your Monitors setting, and Mode Names setting. 
Adjusting  any  or  all  of  these  items may change the availability of
certain screen modes and dimensions.

Choose  Display  Mode;  Click  on  one of the available display modes to
select  that  mode.  The display modes that appear are dependent on what
is  in  your  Monitors  Drawer  at  boot  up.   Deluxe Paint reads which
monitors you have available for use and automatically makes their screen
modes available to the Screen Format requester.  Note; Your monitor must
be  capable  of  displaying  the modes you have in your Monitors drawer.
For example, a 1084 monitor won't display Multiscan modes.

Screen Size; Click the button to cycle through the available sizes.  The
Custom  option allows you to choose the size of the screen using the two
text boxes (width, height).

Page  Size;  Select Screen to make the page size the same as the current
screen  size  dimensions.    Select Keep Same to retain the current page
size  for  new documents.  If the current page size is too small for the
current screen dimensions, it is incrased, but won't affect the image.

Palette  Size;  This  slider  defaults  to  the  maximum colours for the
selected display mode, but can be set to a lower number if desired.

Retain Picture; Click this check box to retain the current picture (this
is on by default).

Backing  Store;  Cycle  between  None (default) or 24bit RGB for using a
backing store to enable 24 bit colour.

Click Use to use the current settings.

You'll  see  the Workbench screen for a moment, then the Painting Screen
appears. 

The  Painting Screen is your canvas or paper.  It's where you'll create,
colour,  edit, and manipulate your art.  Animations you load also appear
here.

The Toolbox contains the brushes, shape tools, and tool-modifiers you'll
use  to create and edit your artwork.  You can select a tool by clicking
on it.

The  Palette contains the colours representing a portion of your current
colour spectrum (sometimes called a colour universe).  This is where you
select the colour you want to paint with.

Directly  above the palette is the Colour Indicator.  The two rectangles
dis  play  the  colours  you're  currently  using  to  paint.  The inner
rectangle  shows  the  foreground  colour  -  the  colour  your brush is
currently using.  The default foreground colour is grey.  You can choose
a  different foreground colour by clicking on any colour in the palette.
The outer rectangle shows the current background colour - the colour you
are  painting  on  or  over.   This colour is black by default.  You can
choose a different background colour by right clicking on it.

If  this  is  your  first time using Deluxe Paint, we recommend you work
through the next chapter, where you will learn how to use many of Deluxe
Paint's tools and techniques.

LOADING A PICTURE

Before  we  leave  this chapter, let's load a picture so you can see how
it's done.

Let's load the one called Venus.

Venus  is  on  the Deluxe Paint Examples disk.  If you don't have a hard
drive  (so  that the files from the Examples disk are not in the DPaintV
drawer  on  your hard drive) make sure your copy of the Examples Disk is
in one of your floppy drives.

Move  your  cursor to the top of the screen so that it is over the Title
Bar.

Whenever you move the cursor to the Title Bar, the cursor changes into a
pointer.

Press and hold down the right mouse button.

The  Menu  Bar  replaces  the  Title Bar and you see a row of menus.  In
addition,  you  see  one  of  the menus extending down into the painting
area.

As you move your pointer from left to right along the Menu Bar, one menu
after  another  extends down, each one displaying its options.  We'll be
look  ing at each menu item in detail later, but for now we just need to
use tbe first two options from the left most menu, the Picture menu.

Hold  down  the  right mouse button, and drag the pointer all the way to
the  left  on  the Menu Bar to display the options in the Picture menu. 
Drag  the  pointer  down to Load, and release the button.  This displays
the Load Picture Requester.

Click  <VOL>  Examples;  in the requester to look at the contents of the
Examples Disk.
 
DPaintV;Picture  appears in the Drawer edit field, and the names of four
directories appears in the window.

Click the Picture Drawer in the requester.

If  necessary  you could scroll through these file names by dragging the
scroll  box up and down.  Or you could scroll through the names one at a
time by clicking the up and down arrows.

Click on the file named Venus.LoRes.

Notice that when you click on the file name the name appears in the edit
field beside File.  If you wanted, you could type the file name into the
edit field, though it is usually easier to click it.

Click OK, or Double-click the filename.

The  disk drive spins for a few moments, and then the picture appears on
the screen.

QUITTING DELUXE PAINT

To  exit  Deluxe  Paint, choose Quit from the Picture menu.  If you have
made  changes to the current image since it was last saved, Deluxe Paint
will  ask whether you want to save your current changes.  If you wish to
save  your  changes  before  quitting,   click   Save.      (You'll find
instructions  on  saving  docu-  ments  in  the  next chapter).  To exit
without saving changes to the image, click Don't Save.

WHATS NEXT?

The  next  chapter, Guided Tour (1), introduces you to many of the funda
mnental  features of Deluxe Paint V.  We've designed the exercises there
to  be  both  easy  and  informative.  If Deluxe Paint is the first high
quality  paint program you've used, we recommend that you go through all
the exercises, in order.  This will give you a solid foundation that you
can  build  on  when  you  move  on  to  other  parts  of   the program.
Experienced  graphic  artists  should  at  least page through the Guided
Tour.


CHAPTER 2 - GUIDED TOUR
-----------------------

The  next  two  chapters  take  you  on  a tour of Deluxe Paint Vs basic
features  They  serve as an introduction to the programs painting tools,
and  provide  several  advanced painting techniques using simple step by
step instructions.

If  you  are a relative newcomer to computer graphics, we recommend that
you  work  through  these chapters from beginning to end.  If you are an
experienced  computer  artist,  you might quickly review the material to
become  familiar  with  Deluxe Paint Vs unique paint features.  Once you
are  comfortable  with  the program, you can turn to chapter 4, Painting
Tutorials  to learn more about graphic techniques, or go off on your own
if you wish Use Chapter 8, Reference, to answer any questions that might
come up.

In this chapter you'll learn how to:

Start a new Deluxe Paint V picture

Select basic tools and paint with them

Create edit, and move objects

Modify the screen, selected shapes, and tools

Create a custom brush

Save your work

The  step  by  step  instructions in the Guided Tour assume that you are
using  Deluxe  Paint on a floppy system.  If you have installed all four
Deluxe  Paint  disks  on  your  hard drive, you wont have to insert your
copies of the various program disks when we request them.

PAINTING SCREEN

Start  Deluxe  Paint  V.  If you need a reminder of how to start the pro
gram, see Starting Deluxe Paint V in Chapter 1.

From  the Choose Screen Format requester, select a Lo-Res mode with a 32
Colour palette and click Use.

After you have selected your screen format, the Painting Screen appears.

The area to the left of the Toolbox is called the page or printing area.
The normal page size is the same as the screen size.

In  the  next chapter Guided Tour (2), you'll learn how you can make the
page larger than the screen, See Page Size.

TITLE BAR

The Title Bar lists the name of the program and the current brush mode.

It  also  reports  whether or not you are using certain program options.
For  example,  if  you  choose  to see the coordinates of the mouse, the
current  fill  type,  or angles of rotation, you can turn those features
on, and see that they are active in the Title Bar.  See User Feedback in
the Title Bar in Reference for more detailed information.

MENUS

The  menus  in Deluxe Paint work just like other Amiga menus.  To select
an  option from a menu, point to the Title Bar and press the right mouse
button to display the Menu Bar.

Drag  the  pointer to a menu name to open that menu.  Pull the highlight
down  to  one of the menu options and release the mouse button to select
that option.

PALETTE

You  select  the  colour  you  want to paint with from the palette.  The
maximum  number  of  colours in the palette depends on the screen format
you  are  using.    You'll  learn more about screen formats and how they
affect  the  number of colours available when you read the next chapter,
or  you  can skip ahead and look in Reference under Screen Format in the
Picture Menu.

THE COLOUR INDICATOR

The Colour Indicator looks like one rectangle sitting on top of another.
The  smaller  rectangle shows the foreground colour.  This is the colour
your  brush  paints  with.    You  can change this colour at any time by
clicking one of the other colours in the Palette.

Move the pointer to one of the colours in the Palette and click.

Notice  that  any  changes to the foreground colour are reflected in the
Colour  Indicator,  and  that the colour you selected is surrounded by a
grey border in the palette.

The larger rectangle, the page, and the first colour in the palette, are
all the same colour - black.  Black is Drluxe Paint's default background
colour.    If you were to paint with the background colour directly onto
the  background,  it  would  appear  to  have  no effect, as if you were
applying  black  paint  to  a  black page.  Painting with the background
colour is a way of erasing an image on the page.

You  can  change the background colour at any time by right clicking one
of the other colours in the palette.

Move the pointer to one of the colours in the Palette and right-click

Although  the  larger  rectangle  is  now composed of the new background
colour,  the painting area (page) is still the prior background colour. 
This is because Deluxe Paint assumes that you want to maintain the prior
background  colour  as  a  "wash"  over  the  current background colour.
Deluxe Paint will keep the painting area.  Try it now.

Click  the  Toolbox  icon labelled CLR directly above the Palette.  This
clears  the screen of the old background colour and replaces it with the
new one.

UNDO

Before  going  any further, lets look at UNDO, one of the most important
tools  in  the  Toolbox.   Clicking UNDO will generally "undo" your last
paint ing action.

Click UNDO now to bring back the old background colour.

UNDO  reverses  your  last  action,  provided  there  has  not  been  an
intervening  mouse  click.  For example, if you were to click CLR twice,
UNDO would not reverse the clear command.

PAINTING WITH THE MOUSE

Now that you've seen how to choose colours from the Palette, let's use a
brush to create our first freeform drawing.

Select  foreground  and  background  colours  from  the palette.  Choose
contrasting  colours, such as blue for the foreground and light grey for
the background.

Click CLR to cover your page with the new background colour.

Move the pointer over to the page, where it turns into a cross-hair with
a dot (the brush) in the centre of it.

Hold  down the left mouse button, and draw a small circle on the screen.
Dont  worry  about  quality  for  the  moment.   Fill in the circle with
foreground colour.  Release the mouse button to stop painting.

Now  press  the  right  mouse  button  and draw all over your filled -in
circle.

The  right mouse button has the effect of erasing your drawing, although
what  you  are  really  doing  is  painting over it with the back ground
colour.  This is called erasing to the background.

REMINDER 
Follow this simple rule: use the left mouse button for painting with the
foreground colour, and the right button for painting with the background
colour.    This  parallels the rule we noted above for selecting colours
from the Palette: select the foreground colour by clicking with the left
button and the background colour by clicking with the right button.

PICKING COLOURS OFF THE SCREEN

So  far  you've  been  selecting  your  colours  by clicking them in the
Palette.    Deluxe  Paint also lets you select colours directly from the
screen.    This  is useful if you are working on fine details, or if you
are  working with many shades of the same basic colour.  For example, if
you are painting a rose using eight different shades of red, it might be
easier  to pick the colour you need directly from the screen rather than
choosing it from the Palette.

Click  anywhere in the Colour indicator and move the pointer back to the
screen.    The  pointer  changes  to  an eye dropper cursor.  Point to a
colour on the screen and click either the left or the right mouse button
to select a new foreground or background colour respectively.

KEYBOARD EQUIVALENTS 
An  even  easier  way  to  select  a  colour from the screen is to use a
keyboard  equivalent.    Keyboard  Equivalents  are  shortcuts for doing
something  you  would otherwise do with the mouse in this case, it might
be  tiresome to click the Colour indicator every time you wanted the eye
dropper  to  choose a colour from the picture.  The shortcut is to press
the  comma  (,) key to get the eye dropper, and then click a colour.  By
using  the  keyboard  equivalent, you never have to move the cursor from
your picture.

Practice  painting  with the mouse for a while and try selecting colours
from  the  screen.    Remember you can always click UNDO to reverse your
last  action,  or  CLR to clear the screen and start afresh.  As soon as
you're  ready  move  on  to the next section, where we will be examining
Deluxe Paint's collection of brushes and tools.

BUILT IN BRUSHES

So  far  you've  been  painting  with the single pixel brush that is the
default  brush  selected when you start the program.  Pixel is short for
picture  element.    A  pixel  is  the  smallest unit you can see on the
screen.

The Deluxe Paint Toolbox includes ten built in brushes; four round ones,
four square ones, and two made up of a number of separate pixels.

To  select  a  brush,  move the pointer over the desired brush shape and
click.

Clicking  a  brush  shape  highlights  it  to  indicate  that  it is the
currently  selected brush.  As you'll see this convention applies to all
the other tools in the Toolbox.

You  can  enlarge or reduce the size of the current brush without contin
ually returning to the Toolbox, Press the equals (=) key to increase the
size  of  the  brush.  Press the minus (-) key to reduce the size of the
brush.

Another way to size your built in brush is to click on it in the Toolbox
with  the  right mouse button.  This gives you a size icon (four outward
pointing arrows).  With the cursor on the page, hold down the left mouse
button and drag the mouse to size the brush.  When you release the mouse
button, your brush is the new size.

With  your new brush selected, paint as before, using the left button to
draw  with the brush colour and the right button to draw (or erase) with
the background colour.

In  the next section we will look at the other drawing tools and see how
they interact with the brushes.

THE PAINTING TOOLS

The  ten  icons  below  the  built  in  brushes (in two columns of five)
control  the  printing  tools.    Because any brush can operate with any
given  painting  tool,  you  have a wide variety of combinations at your
fingertips.

ITS A RULE! 
To select a painting tool, click on it.

We'll describe the tools in order moving left to right and top to bottom:

The  Dotted  freehand  tool allows fast freehand drawing.  No matter how
fast you draw this tool keeps up with you, making it ideal for sketching
out  a  shape  quickly  before  concentrating  on the intricate details.
Note,  however,  that  the  faster  you  go, the bigger the gaps in your
drawing.    Once you have roughed out a shape, you can refine your image
using  some  of  the  other tools at your disposal.  Try drawing with it
using some of the other brushes to get a feeling for how it works.

The  Continuous  Freehand/Freehand Shape tool paints unbroken lines, but
it  doesn't  keep up with you if you draw fast.  It's better suited than
the Dotted Freehand tool for slower more precise drawing.

Try  the  Continuous  Freehand  tool  with different brushes and see how
brush  size  affects  speed.  The smaller the brush, the better it is at
keeping up with your painting strokes.

Notice  that  the  Continuous  Freehand  tool  icon  has a diagonal line
running  from  its top right to its bottom left corner.  This is because
it  is  actually  two  tools  in  one  - the top left one draws unbroken
freehand  lines,  while  the one at bottom right creates freehand shapes
filled with the current foreground or background colour

To create a filled shape:

Click the lower right part of the Continuous Freehand tool and paint any
shape.

When  you release the mouse button, the shape you painted is filled with
either  the  foreground  or  background  colour depending on which mouse
button you pressed when you painted the shape.  If you release the mouse
button  before you close the shape Deluxe Paint closes the shape for you
with  a  straight  line from your cursor position to where you began the
shape.

The  Straight  Line  tool lets you draw straight lines of any length and
angle just by dragging the mouse.

Select the Straight Line tool, and then move the cross hair to the point
on the page where you want the line to begin.

Now  hold  down  the  left mouse button to anchor the line at that point
and, drag the mouse to the point where you want the line to end.

When  you  release the button, you have a straight line in your selected
brush  colour and brush size.  You can also draw straight lines with the
background colour by using the right mouse button.

The  Curve  tool  draws a curved line between two points on the painting
area.  It works just like the Straight Line tool except that it requires
an additional mouse click to complete the shape.

Select the Curve tool and move the cursor to the painting area.

At the spot where you want to begin the curve, press the mouse button to
anchor the shape.  This is the first endpoint.

Drag  the  line to the point where you want the curve to end (the second
endpoint), and release the button.

Slowly move the ursor away from the endpoints.

You'll  notice  that the line is still "active" and forms an arc between
the  endpoints.    The line will curve to follow the cross hair wherever
you move it.

When  the  curve  is  the  shape  you  want,  click to freeze it at that
position.

With  a  little practice, you'll be able to make curves of any shape and
size,  giving  you  much more flexibility than any collection of plastic
templates with their limited selection of shapes and sizes.  Try joining
a  series  of  curves  to  make  flowing  shapes  with  changes in curve
direction.

The  Fill  tool  fills any enclosed shape with the current foreground or
background colour.

Select the Continuous Freehand Shape tool.

Draw  an  enclosed  shape,  a circle for example, with the largest round
built-in brush.

Select  the Fill tool, and move the cursor (which now looks like a paint
can) to the enclosed shape.  Click to fill the shape.

You  can  fill  with  the current foreground colour by clicking the left
button,  or  with  the  current  background colour by clicking the right
button.

The  fill tool fills all the way to the boundaries of an enclosed shape.
If  the  shape  is  not completely enclosed, the paint will leak out and
fill  the  entire  page.  If this ever happens, you can stop the filling
process by pressing the space bar.  This aborts the current fill command
and returns the screen to its pre-command state.

The  paint  can spout, the so called activation point, is the small (one
pixel)  gap  at  the base of the fill cursor.  You must put this part of
the  tool  inside  the  enclosed  shape  before you click to fill.  With
careful manoeuvring, you can fill a space as small as one pixel, so long
as the point coincides with that space.

Deluxe  Paint  has  a  full  featured  airbrush with adjustable tips and
nozzles.    By  using  the  Airbrush  in  combination with the different
brushes,  you  can  create a variety of effects, ranging from a fine one
pixel  spray  to a coarse spray made with the big brushes.  In addition,
you  can  choose  between  two  distinct  modes:  the  Old  Style  pixel
"splatter" airbrush used in previous incarnations of Deluxe Paint, and a
new  smooth Standard airbrush that more accurately emulates the painting
style  of  a real airbrush.  In the following chapter we will see how to
adjust  the  width  of the spray and other airbrush options, but for now
let's try it as is.

Select the Airbrush and try painting with it using the various brushes.

Try  it  with the three and five-pixel brushes, and then try it with the
big brushes.  Note that, just like a regular airbrush, if you press down
on  the  mouse  button  without moving the mouse, the paint continues to
build up in one spot.

If  you  want to try the Standard Airbrush, click the Airbrush tool icon
again.   Try painting with the Standard Airbrush - note how the paint is
applied  more  smoothly  and  the  paint gradually becomes opaque as you
spray an area.

The  Rectangle tool lets you draw squares or rectangles, either unfilled
or  filled  with  the  current  brush  or  background  colour.  Like the
Continuous Freehand tool, the Rectangle tool has a diagonal line running
from  its  top  right to its bottom left corner.  Let's try making a few
rectangles.

Click the top left half of the icon.  Move the pointer onto the painting
area, where it changes into a large crosshair.

Hold  down  the  left  mouse  button to anchor one of the corners of the
rectangle, and drag the mouse away from the anchor point.

You  can  drag  the mouse down and to the right (in which case the first
button  press  anchors the rectangle's top left corner), or in any other
direction  you wish.  In any case, the rectangle is completed as soon as
you  release  the  button.  Note that it is unfilled and bordered by the
current  foreground  colour.   You can also create an unfilled rectangle
bordered by the background colour by using the right mouse button.

To  create  a  filled  rectangle,  click  the  lower  right  part of the
Rectangle icon and repeat the procedure above.

This  time,  the  rectangles  you  create will be filled with either the
foreground  or  the  background colour, depending on whether you pressed
the left or right mouse button.

Making Squares
If  you hold down the Shift key as you draw with the Rectangle tool, you
can constrain the rectangle so that its height and width are equal.

Because  the  Amiga's  pixels  are  not  perfectly square, "constrained"
rectangles will not appear square on the screen.  You can compensate for
this  at  the  painting  stage, or by selecting Be Square from the Prefs
menu.

The Circle tool works like the Rectangle tool.  Select the top left part
of  the  icon to get an unfilled shape; select the bottom right to get a
filled  shape.    Whether  your  circle  is  drawn  in the foreground or
background colour depends on which mouse button you press down while you
draw.

Circles  are  painted  from  the  centre  outward, so it's easy to put a
circle around anything just by starting to paint from where you want the
centre of the circle.

The  Ellipse tool works just like the Circle tool, except that the shape
is still "active" after you release the mouse button.

Select  the  Ellipse  tool.  Remember, top left for unfilled, and bottom
right for filled shapes!

Move  the  pointer to the painting area, and draw an ellipse by dragging
the mouse.  Release the button.

Slowly  move  the  mouse.  Even though you have released the button, the
ellipse continues to change shape as you move the mouse.

When  your  ellipse is the shape and size you want, press down the mouse
button and hold it there.

Now you can rotate your ellipse until it has just the right tilt.

Drag  your  cursor around the ellipse and watch your shape rotate.  When
it  is  in  just the right position, release the mouse button.  The menu
bar displays the angle of rotation.

When  you  complete  your ellipse, the small cross hair changes into the
large cross hair to let you know that Deluxe Paint is ready for the next
ellipse.

The  Polygon  tool  lets  you keep drawing straight lines until you have
created  a  closed figure.  Like the Rectangle, Circle, and Ellipse, the
Polygon  tool  can create both filled and unfilled shapes.  Heres how it
works.

Select the Polygon tool.

Move  the  cross hair into the paining area and click once to anchor the
starting point of your polygon.

Drag  out a line, and click a second time to complete the first line, as
if you were using the Straight Line tool.

You'll  notice that your cross hair is still connected to the first line
by a second straight line.

Click  again  to finish that line, and so on until you have created your
shape.

To complete the polygon:

Move the cross hair to your starting point, and click.

If you are creating a filled polygon, it will be filled with the current
foreground  colour.    If  you right click on the starting point, you'll
fill with the current background colour.

TIP 
Because it can sometimes be a little tricky to end up on the exact pixel
you  started  with,  you  can  complete  a filled polygon at any time by
pressing  the  space  bar.  This automaically connects the last anchored
point  to  the  point of origin and fills it with the current foreground
colour.

Use the filled Polygon tool to draw several five pointed stars.

ANYTHING CAN BE A BRUSH 

The  Brush Selector is a special tool that is an essenial part of Deluxe
Paint's  versatility.  With the Brush Selector anything can be a brush -
any piece of artwork or text you put on the screen.

Select  the  Brush  Selector,  and  move the cursor over to the painting
area.

Your  cursor  is now a large cross hair that reaches to the edges of the
screen Let's make one of the filled stars you drew with the Polygon tool
into a brush.

Put  the  centre  of the cross hair to the upper left of the star.  Drag
the  cursor  to  the  lower  right of the star, as if you were using the
Rectangle  tool to enclose the star in a box.  Release the mouse button.

When  you  release  the  mouse button, the cursor has a copy of the star
attached to it.  This star is your new brush!

To  stamp  a  star  in a new location, simply click.  There's no need to
stop with one - go ahead and star spangle the screen.

If  any  parts  of  your brush consist of the current background colour,
those parts will be transparent.  In other words, whenever you pick up a
brush, its as if you are picking up only the non background colours; any
background  colours  in  the  brush will remain invisible even after you
change  to  a  new  background  colour.   This means that you can create
brushes  with  intricate outlines without fear of picking up a rectangle
of the surrounding background colour.

Let's try one more trick.

Click the Brush Selector again and select a star from the painting area.
But this time use the right mouse button to drag the cross hair over the
star.

Unlike  the  last  exercise,  which  yielded  two  stars  - one unmoving
original,  plus the one on your brush - this time you are picking up and
moving  just  the  one  star.  While the first feature lets you copy and
move  anything  on  the screen, the second lets you move images from one
part of the screen to another, while leaving no trace behind.

Deluxe Paint's text editor lets you place text anywhere on the page, and
the Brush Selector lets you pick it up and reposition it if you dont get
it quite right the first time.

To enter text on the page:

Select the Text tool.

Move the cursor to the page. The pointer turns into the text cursor.

Click where you want to begin a line of text.

Type on the keyboard.

The  text  will  automatically  "wrap"  around  to the next line when it
reaches the end of the line.

You  can  delete  text by pressing the backspace key as long as you HAVE
NOT  clicked  elsewhere  on  the  screen.  When you click elsewhere (the
Toolbox for example), text becomes a bit mapped image, and can no longer
be edited as text.

CHANGING COLOURS

You  can change the colour of your text as often as you like by choosing
a different foreground colour from the Palette.

Select a new foreground colour and type some more.

To leave the text mode, click on another tool, or press ESC.

You'll  learn  how  to use the Choose Font Requester to select different
fonts, type sizes, and type styles in the next chapter, Guided Tour (2).
See the section Modifying Tools.

The  Grid  lets  you  apply  paint  on  the  page  in accordance with an
invisible grid and restricts your painting tools to the grid points.

If you need some room to work, click CLR.

Select  the Grid, and then click the Dotted Freehand tool.  Now paint on
the screen.

With  Grid  and the Dotted Freehand tool selected, you can print only on
the  points  of the grid, making it easy to fill the screen with a polka
dot pattern (we'll see other methods for pattern design later).

You'll  learn  how  to adjust the spacing between the grid points in the
next chapter, Guided Tour (2).  See the section Modifying Tools.

The  Symmetry  tool  lets you print symetrically over the entire page at
the same time.

Click  the  Symetry  tool,  [If  the  Grid is selected from the previous
exercise,  turn  it  off] Use the Dotted Freehand tool to paint whatever
you like.

Your  brush now consists of a number of mirror images of itself.  As you
move  the brush around, all the mirror images move as well, producing an
effect much like that of a kaleidoscope.  When you paint, you are laying
down a number of identical mirror images about a fixed origin.  With all
tools  except  the Dotted and Continuous Freehand tools and the Airbrush
tool,  the  mirror  images are drawn after you release the mouse button.
With the Dotted and Continuous Freehand tools and the Airbrush tool, all
the images are drawn at the same time.

You'll learn how to customise the Symmetry settings in the next chapter,
Guided Tour(2).  See the section Modifying Toolws.

You  can  magnify  any  section  of  your work and view it alongside the
standard-sized image.  To magnify a section of your work:

Click  the  Magnify  icon.    When you move the cursor onto the page, it
becomes a rectangular outline.

Move the outline to the part of the image you want to magnify and click.

The part of the image included in the rectangle now appears magnified on
the  right  part  of  the  screen.   You can use any tool to perform any
function on either side of the screen.  You can scroll around your image
using  the  four  arrow  keys;  this  moves  the  image around under the
"magnifying glass." In addition, by pointing your cursor anywhere on the
unmagnified  portion  of the screen and pressing n, you can magnify that
part of the picture.

Once  you  have  magnified  a  part of your picture, you can increase or
decrease the amount of magnification by clicking the Zoom tool.

Click the Zoom icon to increase the magnification.  Right click the icon
to reduce the magnification.

Deluxe  Paint's  Magnify and Zoom tools let you carry out precision work
on  your  pictures by magnifying each pixel up to 400 times its original
size.

To quit magnify mode, click the Magnify icon a second time.

TOOLBOX SUMMARY

This  completes  our  brief  review of Deluxe Paint's versatile range of
tools.  You'll find additional and more detailed information about every
tool scattered throughout the manual, and gathered in Reference.

Before  we  continue  our  tour  of  Deluxe  Paint V in the next chapter
[Guided Tour (2)], take a moment to learn how to save your artwork.

SAVING YOUR WORK

It's  important  to  learn  how  to  save  the pictures (or "files") you
create.    We'll  begin  by  saving  whatever  you drew in the preceding
sections.

Move the pointer up to the far left side of the Title Bar.

Press  and  hold down the right mouse button.  This exposes the Menu Bar
and extends the Picture menu.

Select Save.

The Save Picture requester appears.

Notice  that this requester is like the Load Picture requester in almost
every  respect.  You'll use the Save Picture requester to provide Deluxe
Paint  with  the  information  it needs to save your files in its proper
classification.   The Drawer edit box tells Deluxe Paint which drawer to
save  the  file in.  By using drawers to classify your pictures, you can
keep  related  images  together, in the same way you keep related papers
together  in  one  file  folder.    For  example  the  setting  might be
DF1:lo-res,  which means that the drawer exists on a disk in your second
disk drive ("DF1") and that the drawer is named "lo-res".

The  File edit box is where you enter the name of your picture the first
time you save it.

If you want to save your current creation, this is your chance to do so.

Insert a blank, formatted disk in any drive, for example, DF1.

Click  the Volume button.  The name of the drive that contains the blank
disk should appear in the window (<DEV> DF1;)

Click  on  the  disk name in the window.  In our example DF1; appears in
the Drawer edit box.

Click  anywhere  in  the  File  edit box and type in a name for your new
file.

Click Ok.

The  disk drive will spin for a few moments; when the red light goes out
the file is saved.

The  next  time  you  save  this  file  (its a good idea to save work in
progress  every  15  minutes  or  so,  so  that  power  failure or other
breakdown  doesnt  turn  hours  of  work into a bitter memory), the Save
Requester  uses this same information, which means you wont need to type
anything  more  unless you want to change the file name.  You might want
to  do  this  to  save  it  under another name, if you want to save each
version as a separate file.  In that case, you would click the File edit
box as before, backspace over the old file name (or over those parts you
wish to change) and type in the new name.  Or you could just keep adding
suffixes, such as 1, 2, 3, etc,, to signify succeeding versions.

You  can  specify drawer names in the same way: click in the Drawet edit
box, backspace over the old name, and type in the new name, You can open
any  drawer already on the disk, but you cannot create one from the Save
Requester.    See  your Amiga User Guide for information on creating new
drawers.

For more information on all the options available from the Load and Save
requesters, see Reference.

Right  now  you might want to take a break.  When youre ready move on to
the next chapter Guided Tour (2), where you'll learn how to modify tools
and work with many other powerful features of Deluxe Paint.


CHAPTER 3 - GUIDED TOUR (2)
---------------------------

This  chapter  continues  the tour of Deluxe Paint's painting tools.  It
concentrates on the programs sophisticated editing tools, describes tool
modifiers,  previews  the  Anim  menu,  and  introduces several painting
techniques using simple step by step instructions.
 
If  you are a relative newcomer to computer graphics, we again recommend
that  you  work through this chapter from beginning to end.  If you have
some experience with computer graphics software, you can probably become
familiar  with this material quickly.  You can use this chapter to learn
how  Deluxe  Paint  handles  features  you  have  encountered  in  other
programs.    Feel  free to skip around and read only those sections that
interest you at the time.

When  you  are comfortable with the program, turn to Chapter 4, Painting
Tutorials  to  learn  how  the  program  creates  and handles colour, or
Chapter  5,  Working with Perspective to learn more about Deluxe Paint's
graphic  power.   If you go off on your own, use Chapter 8, Reference to
answer any questions that might come up.

In this part of the Guided Tour you'll learn how to:

Create and edit custom brushes

Manipulate the variaty of program screen formats

Modify tool functionality and operation

Mix and cycle colours from the Palette

Use keyboard equivalents with the mouse button down

Use the various painting modes

Control AnimBrushes and Animpainting

WHAT YOU'LL NEED TO CONTINUE THE TOUR

To  complete  the  examples  in  this  section, you'll need your working
copies of the Deluxe Paint Program and Media disks.  If you want to save
your  work,  you'll  need  an  initialised  disk  with  a fair amount of
available space for saving large files.

The  step  by  step  instructions  in the tour assume that you are using
DeluxePaint  on  a  floppy system.  If you have installed all the Deluxe
Paint  Disks on your hard drive, you won't have to insert your copies of
the Deluxe Paint disks when we request them.

Start  Deluxe  Paint and use the default screen format settings.  If you
already  have the program running, we recommend that you restart so that
the tools and option settings are all set to their defaults.

CUSTOM BRUSHES

As  we  saw in Guided Tour (1), Deluxe Paint's "anything can be a brush"
feature  lets  you  select  any  image  on the screen and define it as a
brush.    If  you  wish, you can keep a selection of brush images on the
spare  page  (use  Spare  in the Picture menu) and move them over to the
main  page  by  picking  them  up as brushes.  Or you can have two spare
custom brushes in RAM (use the Spare and Copy/Paste options in the Btush
menu).    In addition, you can load and save brushes as though they were
pictures.

CREATING A RECTANGULAR BRUSH

Here's a reminder of how to create a brush out of an on screen image:

Select the Brush Selector

Move  the cursor to the painting area.  The cursor becomes a large cross
hair.

Drag  the  cross  hair  to form a rectangle around the image you want to
pick  up.  When you release the mouse button, an exact copy of the image
is attached to your cursor.

REMEMBER! 
When  you drag the Brush Selector with the left button held down, Deluxe
Paint makes a duplicate of the image and attaches it to the cursor while
leaving  the  original image in place on the page.  If you use the right
mouse  button to surround the image, the image itself becomes the brush,
as  if  the  original  image  had  been  lifted  up  off the page.  This
technique  provides  an  ideal  method for picking up objects and moving
them around the page as you experiment with different compositions.  See
also Fixing the Background in Painting Tutorials.

Paint with your new brush or use it to create filled or unfilled shapes,
just as you would with any of the built-in brushes.

CREATING A BRUSH WITH AN IRREGULAR SHAPE

Though  it's often convenient, you arent limited to creating rectangular
brushes.    Deluxe  Paint  lets you corral any image, so you can pick up
shapes  from  a  "crowded" background, and make a brush in any shape you
wish.  Here's how to corral an image:

If  the  Brush Selector icon is highlighted, click the tool icon.  If it
is not selected, double-click it.

The  Brush  Selector  icon  changes  to a polygon shape to show that the
polygon/ corral brush selector is active.

Click  around the shape you wish to define, just as if you were making a
polygon  with  the Polygon tool.  Or click and drag to draw in free hand
mode as you would with the Freehand drawing tool.

As  soon as you complete the polygon, the complex shape becomes your new
brush.

Another  useful  method is the "magic wand" Brush Selector mode.  To use
the magic wand:

Triple  click  the Brush Selector to select it.  The Brush Selector icon
now looks like a magic wand.

Clicking  the left mouse button picks up the entire area contiguous with
the  seelected  pixel  (ie.  the contiguous shape connected to the pixel
without  being  broken  by the background colour).  For instance, if you
click  in  the middle of a filled circle, the entire circle is picked up
as a brush.

The  left  button-right  button  convention works with both of the above
methods,  too.  Corralling the shape with the left button duplicates the
shape,  while  corralling  with the right button lifts the shape off the
background.   As with the Polygon tool, pressing the space bar completes
the  polygon  for you, so you dont have to search for the starting pixel
in order to complete it.

THE TRANSPARENT COLOUR

When  you  pick  up  a  custom  brush,  some  parts of your brush may be
transparent.      There  are  two  rules for determining which colour is
transparent:

If  AutoTransp in the Prefs menu is turned off (the default setting), or
if  any  one  corner of the brush is a different colour from the others,
the current background colour is transparent.

If  AutoTransp  is  turned on and every corner of your brush is the same
colour, that colour is transparent.

Lets  see  how  these  two rules work in practice with a couple of brief
examples.

To  set  up  for our example, click black in your palette with the right
mouse  button  to  make it the background colour, and click CLR to clear
your screen.

Use  the  Dotted  Freehand tool to scrawl randomly over the screen using
several different colours.

THE BACKGROUND COLOUR IS TRANSPARENT

Now  you  should  have  a  black screen, because by default black is the
background colour with several colours scrawled over it.

Click  the  Brush Selector icon, and move the cross hair to the painting
area.

Select a rectangular area that contains some black.

When  you  release  the  mouse button, the black areas of your brush are
transparent  because  black  was the background colour when you selected
the  brush.    Move the brush around to confirm this: the painting shows
through  the areas where there used to be black.  Any parts of the brush
that  consisted  of  background  colour when the brush was first created
remain  transparent,  even  after you change background colours.  But if
you  want  to  change the tansparent colour you can do that, too.  We'll
show you how in a moment.

When  the  Solid  Body  option  from  the  Brush  menu is turned on, the
translucent  pixels  of  a  custom brush that are surrounded by a colour
change  to  the  solid  colour.    The outside area of the brush remains
transparent.

THE CORNER COLOUR IS TRANSPARENT

Now  let's see what happens when you select an area with all corners the
same colour.

Move  the pointer to the far right of the Title Bar, and press the right
mouse button.

The  Menu  Bar appears.  Drag the mouse left, and the Prefs menu extends
down.

Choose the AutoTransp option.  Display the menu a second time to confirm
that  AutoTransp  now has an check mark beside it.  This means that it's
turned on.

Double  click  the  Brush  Selector icon to activate the polygonal brush
selector.

Select  an  area  of  any shape.  Make sure that you always click on the
same  colour,  but  not on black (since this is the background color and
wont illustrate what we want to see).

This  creates  a brush in which the colour you clicked on is transparent
because  AutoTransp  is turned on, and all corners of your brush are the
same colour.

We used the polygonal Brush Selector for our example, but the AutoTransp
option  is  especially  useful  for  picking  up  a shape from any solid
background without having to change the current background colour.

CHANGING THE TRANSPARENT COLOUR

You  can  change which colour in your brush is transparent by choosing a
new  background  colour and then choosing Brush>Change Transparency from
the Colour menu.  Let's try a quick example.

Click  the  Brush  Selector  and select a rectangular area that contains
some  of  the  current  background  colour  so  that your brush has some
transparent areas.

Choose  a  new  background colour by clicking on a colour in the Palette
with the right mouse button.

Notice  that  simply  changing  the  current  background colour does not
change  the  transparent  areas of your brush.  You accomplish that with
the next command.

Choose Brush>Change Transparency from the Colour menu.

The  transparent  areas  of  your  brush  change  from  the areas of the
original  background  colour  to  the  areas  of  the current background
colour.  You can do this as many times as you like to change transparent
areas.

A BRUSH IS A LITTLE PICTURE

From  the Brush menu you can treat brushes just like full pictures.  You
can  Load and Save them just as you can other pictures.  When you load a
saved brush, it comes equipped with its own palette and ranges, the ones
that  were  in  effect  when  the brush was first saved.  If the current
picture  is  using  a  palette  different  from that of the newly loaded
brush,  you  can  change  the  current  palette to the brushs palette by
selecting  Palette>Use Brush Palette from the Colour menu.  On the other
hand,  if  you  want  to  use  the  newly  loaded brush with the current
palette,  select  Brush>Remap  from  the  Colour  menu.   The "Load With
Palette" check box gadget in the Options panel allows for automatic "Use
Brush Palette" loading.

Other options in the Brush and Colour menus let you resize, reshape, and
recolour brushes in various ways.

Your  Deluxe Paint Media disk contains a number of saved brushes.  Let's
load one now just to see how it works:

Insert  the Media disk into any drive, Select Load from the Brush menu. 
Click <VOL> Media: in the Load Brush requester.

Click <DIR> Brush. The Drawer edit box reads Media:Brush.

Double click Bobsled and the file will load automatically.

The  Bobsled  brush  is attached to your cursor but it's colours are not
correct.

Choose  Palette>Use  Brush  Palette  from  the  Colour menu.  Select the
Continuous Freehand tool and paint with the brush.

Do  you  see  why this brush is called Bobsled?  Feel free to experiment
with  some  of  the  saved  brushes.    Select Palette>Use Brush Palette
whenever  you  load  a  brush to ensure that you are seeing it as it was
when it was saved.

If you would like to see colour cycling in action, load the brush called
Fireworks.

Select MultiCycle from the Prefs menu.

Select Cycle from the Mode menu.

Select  Palette>Use  Brush Palette and then press the Tab key before you
start drawing with it.

"Fireworks"  comes  complete  with  colour cycling information, and is a
spectacular  example  of  the  power of this feature.  See Tutotial Two:
Working  With  Ranges  in  the  next  chapter for more demonstrations of
colour cycling.

ADDITIONAL FEATURES

The following are some additional features relating to custom brushes.

HANDLE
This  feature,  which  is  available  from the Brush menu, allows you to
specify  where the cursor will sit in your custom brush.  In the default
setting  the  cursor  sits  at the centre of the custom brush.  When you
select  Handle>Rotate,  the  brush  handle moves to the lower right hand
corner  of the brush.  Each successive choice of the Rotate option moves
the handle to a different corner, and then back to the center.

Once  you  have  selected  the  handle attached to the corner, the brush
handle  attaches  itself  to the ending corner when you enclose a brush.
For example, if you pick up your brush by dragging downward from left to
right,  the  brush  handle  will  attach  itself to the lower right hand
corner,  whereas  if you pick up the brush by dragging upward from right
to left, the handle will attach itself to the top left hand corner.

The  Handle  feature  is  especially  important in the perspective mode,
because  you  can rotate a brush about its handle, whether the handle is
at the centre or on one of the corners.

PERSPECTIVE

Deluxe  Paint's Perspective feature (in the Effect menu) lets you rotate
a brush about any of the three axes of three dimensional space to define
a  plane  of  operation,  and  then  work  within  that  plane to create
perspective  effects.    Perspective is a big subject to cover, so we've
dedicated  an entire chapter to cover it.  Working with Perspective.  If
you  are  interested  in 3D painting or in 3D animation, be sure to work
through Chapters 6 and 7.

FAST FB

Fast  FB  stands  for  Fast  Feedback, and with Fast FB selected (it the
Prefs  menu), lines, filled shapes, and unfilled shapes are drawn with a
single  pixel  line  instead  of  the full custom brush until you finish
drawing,  at which point your shape is repainted with the custom brush. 
This  makes for faster drawing.  Try painting an unfilled rectangle with
a custom brush both ways to see how Fast FB works.

DELUXE PAINT V SCREEN

Some  of Deluxe Paint's features affect the entire screen, while others,
such  as the tools and the brushes, affect the screen selectively.  This
section considers those features that have a screen wide effect.

HIDING THE TOOLBOX AND TITLE BAR

Deluxe Paint lets you paint on the entire screen, even under the Toolbox
and the Title Bar

To  remove  these  two  items  from the screen, press the F10 key.  This
removes  them both if they are both present.  Press F10 a second time to
bring them back.

To hide just the Title bar (or to bring it back, if its hidden) press F9.

Note that you can still access the Menu Bar even when its invisible.

Move  the cursor to the top of the screen (except upper left corner) and
press  the  right  mouse  button  to  display the Menu Bar.  You can now
select any menu item in the regular fashion.

You  can access the tools as well, even with the Toolbox hidden, through
the  keyboard  equivalents.    See  Appendix  B  for  a complete list of
keyboard commands.

PAGES

Deluxe Paint gives you two separate pages with which to work.  You could
use  one  of  the pages for creating background images and the other for
creating  foreground images.  You could then move parts from one page to
the  other  to  complete  your  composition.   When you are working on a
picture  the  spare  page  is always the page you are currently viewing.
When  you are working on an animation, the spare page is identified with
the  word  Scratch  in  the  menu  bar; this page can be larger than the
screen.  This makes it possible to create scrolling backgrounds and such
with  the  new  Camera Move requester.  As we shall see in a moment, the
spare  page  is  not entirely independent of the other page or animation
frames.

SWITHCHING PAGES

When you first open a new file or load a picture from disk, Deluxe Paint
opens one of the two pages.

Load  any image from the Picture Drawer on your copy of the Deluxe Paint
Examples disk.

To  move  from one page to the other, choose Spare>Swap from the Picture
menu, or press j on the keyboard to "jump" to the other page.

In  addition,  because  the  Toolbox is not really part of the page (but
actually  sits  "above"  it), whatever tools you had selected before you
switched  will  still  be selected after you switch pages.  This way you
can  retain  the  same tool settings, giving you continuity as you work.
Note  that this continuity rule does not apply to the Fix Background and
Stencil  commands,  which  do not carry over from one page to the other.
See  the following section for information on fixing the background, and
Tutorial  Three: The World of Stencils in the next chapter for exercises
involving the Fix Background and Stencil features.

PAGE SIZE

Deluxe Paint lets you work on page sizes ranging from 320 pixels wide by
200  pixels  high  and  up.   The page size limit depends on your screen
format,  memory  size, and the number of colours in your palette.  Note,
however,  that  your  page  size  can  never be smaller than the current
screen  resolution  For  example,  if you are using HiRes 640x400 screen
format,  your  page  cannot be smaller than 640x400.  In addition to the
three  pre  set  page  sizes (Screen: Full Page: Overscan), Deluxe Paint
lets  you  specify  any  height  and  width  through  the  Set Page Size
requester  (by  selecting  Custom  and  enter ing width and height pixel
settings).  To display this requester, choose Page Size from the Picture
menu.

If  you  are  working  on  a  page  size larger than the screen, you can
preview  the  entire page at any time by selecting the Show Page command
from the Picture menu.  Your current work area will appear surrounded by
a  rectangle.    You  can move this rectangle to work on another area by
holding  down  the  left  mouse  button.    Dragging  the rectangle, and
releasing  the mouse button when the area you want to paint is enclosed.
You  can  return  to  your  current page without moving the rectangle by
pressing the space bar.

SCROLLING THE PAGE

If  you  are  working  on a page that is larger than the screen, you can
also scroll the page with the arrow keys on the keyboard.  Think of them
as  moving  the  screen rather than the picture: pressing the down arrow
moves  the  screen  down,  so  it  looks like the page is moving up.  To
scroll  the  page  in  screen size increments, hold down the Alt key and
press the arrow keys.

A more efficient way to scroll the page is to place your cursor over the
area  you want to move and press the n key.  If the page can scroll that
far,  the  area under your cursor will be centred in the screen.  If the
page  isn't  big  enough  to  centre  the  area,  it will move as far as
possible.

SCREEN RESOLUTIONS

Deluxe Paint supports many different screen resolutions.  You can switch
from one to another even during a single work session, but be aware that
changing formats in he middle of a job can result in loss of information
(such  as  your  current brush, the spare page, the last requester used,
etc).  Its important to save your work before changing screen formats.

You  should develop the habit of saving your work every 15 or 20 minutes
in  any  case,  but  it becomes especially important to do so if you are
about to change formats.

As  we  noted  in Guided Tour (1) you're asked to select a screen format
each  time  you  start  Deluxe  Paint,  through the Choose Screen Format
requester.    In  addition,  you  can  display  the Choose Screen Format
requester  at any time by selecting Screen Format from the Picture menu.
Each screen format has its own linitations and memory requirements.

Please  note  that  to  switch on the 24-bit backing store and work with
true colour, you need 4MB of free RAM.

PALETTE

This section introduces you to the basics of the Palette.  You can learn
about the colour requesters by working through the tutorials in the next
chapter  or  by reading the relevant parts of the Reference section (see
Palette in the Colour menu).

COLOUR MIXER

The  Colour  Mixer  lets you mix your own custom set of colours from the
total  number  of  available  colours  (4096  on  non-AGA machines, 16.7
million  on  AGA Amigas, or 16.7 million on any Aniga with backing store
turned on).  You can mix colours using either the RGB (Red, Green, Blue)
or  HSV  (Hue, Saturation, Value) colour systems.  The number of colours
you  can work with at any one time is dependent on the screen format and
number  of colours you selected in the Screen Format requester.  See the
Display  Information  box  in  the  Screen  Format  requester  for  more
information on your currently selected screen mode.

To  Display  the  Colour  Mixer  choose Palette>Mixer On from the Colour
menu, or right click the Colour Indicator.

You can quickly modify the currently selected colour on any of the three
variables  (RGB  or  HSV)  by  dragging  the appropriate sliders left or
right.

To  select  more  than  one  contiguous colour click to select the first
colour,  and  then Alt click on the last color.  All the colours between
the two colors are selected.

To  select more than one discontiguous colour, click to select the first
colour,  and  then Shift-click on any other colours you wish to select. 
Only  the  colours  you  click  are selected; the colours in between the
selected colours arent selected.

ARRANGING COLOURS IN THE PALETTE

EX  (for  "Exchange") and COPY let you swap or copy colour from one part
of the Palette to another.

To  exchange  the  position of two colours; Click a colour, click EX and
then  click  a  second  colour.   The two colours exchange places on the
Palette.

To  copy  a  colour  over another; Click a colour click Copy and click a
second colour.  This copies the first colour into the second

These two functions make it easier to create the colour spreads for your
work.

CREATING SPREADS

The  Palette Requester lets you create colour spreads to give you subtle
shades of the same hue or equally spaced gradations across hues.

To  create  a spread of colours, click the first colour for your spread,
click SPREAD, and then click the last colour for the spread.

Deluxe  Paint  looks  at the first and last colours in the spread and at
the  number  of  steps  in  between,  and  then calculates the series of
intervening  shades  For  example, if your first colour is blue and your
last  colour  is  yellow, Deluxe Paint calculates the intervening shades
and  hues,  to  give  you a series of blues, blue-greens, greens, yellow
greens,  and  yellows.    Unlike  traditional  colour  mixing,   if your
modifications  are  not to your satisfaction, you can always reverse the
last change by clicking UNDO, or you can cancel all the changes you made
by clicking Revert.

DEFINING RANGES

Good  colour ranges are important for effective Colour Cycling, Gradient
Fill,  and  some  Painting  Modes.  Colour Cycling and Gradient Fill are
treated  in  the  Tutorial Two: Working with Ranges in Chapter Four, and
you'll  find  information about Painting Modes later in this chapter and
in  the  Reference  Right  now, we'll take just a quick look at where to
define ranges.

You can define up to eight colour ranges of up to 256 individual colours
each (in AGA modes) and assign a cycling speed (RATE) to each range.

Choose  Ranges...    from the Colour menu.  The Range requester replaces
the Palette at the bottom of the screen.

The  Range  requester lets you put colours from your palette along a bar
to  define a range.  This flexible way of defining ranges lets you place
the  colours  in  different  orders from how they appear in the palette.
Also,  it  is  now easier to use the same colour in more than one range.
You'll learn how to use this requester in the next chapter.

PALETTE AND SCREEN FORMATS 

Deluxe  Paint works from a colour universe that contains as many colours
as  your  Amiga  supports (4096 on non-AGA machines, 16.7 million on AGA
Amigas, or 16.7 million on any Amiga with backing store turned on).  The
maximum number of colours available in each format is listed below.  The
number  of  colours  you  can have at any time depends on your available
memory  and  compurer  model:  if your page is large or you have a large
brush, you may not be able to choose the maximum number of colours.
 
Lo-Res 
256 (AGA) or 32 (non-AGA) colours in standard LoRes (64 if your computer
supports Extra Halfbrite: 4096 in the special HAM mode)

Med-Res 
256 (AGA) or 16 (non-AGA) colours

Interlace 
256 (AGA) or 32 (non-AGA) colours in standard LoRes (64 if your computer
supports Extra Halfbrite: 4096 in the special HAM mode)

Hi-Res 
256 (AGA) or 16 (non-AGA) colours

HAM 
262000+ (AGA) or 4096 (non AGA) colours

24-bit Backing 
16.7 million colours available

See the Reference for general information on the various Screen formats.
Appendix  D:  Amiga  Display  Modes gives a technical explanation of the
relationship between screen formats and the number of colours available.
See  also  Appendix  A: Memory Management for more information on memory
usage.

MODIFYING TOOLS

You've  already  learned  that you can activate any tool by clicking its
icon  in  the  Toolbox.   A tool remains active until you select another
tool  or in some cases, deselect it by clicking the icon a second time. 
Examples  of  the  latter kind of tool are the Grid and the Symmetry and
Magnify tools, which are toggled on and off by each mouse click.

In  most  cases,  right  clicking  a  tool  icon  lets  you  modify some
fundamental  aspect  of that tool.  The following summarises the effects
of right-button mouse clicks on the tools in the Toolbox:

BUILT IN BRUSHES

You can change the size of any of the built in brushes in the Toolbox.

Right-click the brush.

Move  the  cursor  over to the painting area.  The cursor changes to the
size icon (four outward-pointing arrows)

Hold  down either mouse button and drag diagonally to adjust the size of
the brush.

AIRBRUSH

You  can adjust a number of Airbrush settings with the Airbrush Settings
requester.

Right click the Airbrush icon. The Airbrush Settings requester appears.

The available options are:

Airbrush Type
Choose between Old Style or Standard.  Old Style is the airbrush used in
previous  incarnations  of Deluxe Paint: pixels of the foreground colour
are  randomly  sprayed  within  the radius setting of the airbrush.  For
Standard  the  program paints similar shades of the foreground colour to
create  a  seamless,  blending effect.  In Standard mode the colours you
paint with are affected (tinted) by the colour you paint on.

Radius
Use the slider or text box to set the airbrush radius from 1-100 pixels.
The larger the number, the larger the sprayed area.

Flow
Changes  the  opacity  of  paint sprayed when Standard mode is selected.
Use  the slider or text gadget to set a value from 1-100, with 100 being
maximum opacity.

Size
This button lets you resize the nozzle.

Click  the  button and then move the cursor over to the painting area.  
The cursor changes to the size icon.

Hold  down either mouse button and drag diagonally to adjust the size of
the solid circle, which represents the spray area.

You can also adjust the airbrush size while painting by typing + or - to
increase or decrease the size.

STRAIGHT LINE, CURVE, AND UNFILLED SHAPE TOOLS

A right click on any of these tools brings up the Spacing requester.

The  Spacing requester lets you control the distance between "splats" in
your  lines.    This  lets  you  choose  whether a line is continuous or
dotted.   If you want a dotted line, you can define the line in terms of
the  total  number  of dots (N Total) or by the number of pixels between
dots (Every Nth Dot).

Choose Airbrush to use the Airbrush tool with any of the tools that uses
the  Spacing requester.  This is especially useful for smooth airbrushed
curves and circles.

FILL AND SHAPE TOOLS

Right clicking any of these icons brings up the Fill Type requester.

This  requester lets you choose one of several fill types for your fills
and filled shapes.  Many features of the Fill Type Requester are covered
in Tutorials Two: Working with Ranges and in the Reference section.

BRUSH SELECTOR

Right-clicking the Brush Selector restores the last custom brush.  Thus,
if  you  had  created a custom brush (see Custom Brushes in this chapter
for  details) and then made some modifications, right clicking the Brush
Selector  would  restore you to the previous custom brush.  This feature
is  also  useful if you create a custom brush and then select a built-in
brush.  Right clicking the Brush Selector restores the custom brush.

TEXT TOOL

Right-clicking  the  Text  tool displays the Choose Font requester.  You
use  this requester to choose fonts and styles for the Text tool to use.


To  select a different type font, size, and/or style, display the Choose
Font requester.

Click  a  font from the window.  Choose from the available font sizes by
clicking  on  the  up  and  down arrows.  Click any of the Style buttons
(Bold,  Italic,  Underline),  to  apply any font style you want.  If you
like the results, click OK.

A  special  feature  of the Choose Font requester is the ability to load
fonts  from  a fonts directory on a different disk.  To do this, use the
Font  Dir...    command from the Prefs menu.  In addition, your Examples
disk contains two special coloured fonts.

Insert the Deluxe Paint Examples disk in any drive.

Select  Font  Dir...    from  the Prefs menu.  The Choose Font Directory
requester appears.

Click  the Volumes button, and select the Examples disk from the list of
volumes that appears.

Select the Karafonts drawer, and then click OK to select the drawer.

Right  click  ion  the Text tool, and the Choose Font requester appears.
In a moment, the fonts list from your Examples disk appear in the Choose
Font requester.  Let's use one of the fonts.

Click  the  font  named ChiselScript and click OK, A message asks if you
want  to  use the font's palette.  Click Yes, Place your text cutsor and
type away!

If  you  want  to  move your text once it's on the screen, use the Brush
Selector  to pick it up and move it around.  If you are adding text to a
picture,  there  are  two  good  tips  you  should know.  If you fix the
background  (Effect>Background>Fix)  before you type the text, you'll be
able  to  move  the text without harming the picture.  Another way to do
this  is to jump to the Spare page to type your text and then pick it up
as a brush to place on your picture.

GRID AND SYMMETRY TOOLS

Right-clicks  on these tool icons let you modify aspects of gridding and
symmetry.

You can also control the spacing between the points.

Click on the Grid icon to turn on the grid.

Use  the  Dotted  Freehand tool to paint in the painting area.  The dots
show you the current position of the grid.

Right  click  the Grid icon to bring up the Gridding requester.  You can
now  set  the  spacing for both the X and the Y coordinates by typing in
the  actual spacing in the calibration boxes.  The spacing is calibrated
in pixels.

Click  in  the  X  spacing  edit  box, delete or backspace to remove the
existing  value,  and  then type in the new value - try 20.  Do the same
with the Y spacing.  Click OK.

Now  try  painting with the Dotted Freehand tool to see how the grid has
changed.

You can also recalibrate the gridding by using a visual method.

Display the Gridding requester.

Click Adjust.

You  are  returned  to the page with a cursor that looks like a matrix. 
This  matrix  represents  the  current  grid values in graphic form.  To
change  the  values, press and hold down the left mouse button, drag the
mouse  until  the matrix is the desired size and shape, and then release
the button.

The  new  grid  is  based  on  this matrix.  You can also reposition the
points  of  the grid using Adjust: move the matrix so that its cells are
in the desired position and click the left button.

If  you  are  in perspective mode and you right click the Grid icon, the
Perspective  requester  appears.  This requester lets you set a grid for
three  dimensional  space  and  also  lets  you choose other Perspective
settings.    (See  Chapter Five; Using Perspective or the description in
Referenre of the Perspective>Settings option in the Effect menu).

You  can  change  the settings for the type of symmetry you use by right
clicking the Symmetry tool.  This brings up the Symmetry Requester.

You'll  find  a brief explanation of each of the options in the Symmetry
requester  in Reference.  For now, if you feel adventurous, try changing
the settings and paintind with different shapes.

PAINTING MODES

The options in the Mode menu control the way your brush applies paint to
the  page.    In this section, we'll look at a few of the modes.  You'll
find information about all modes in Reference.

To look at some of these modes, you'll need paint on the screen, so lets
load a picture.

Load the picture Venus from the Art Disk.

First  lets  look at a couple of modes that change print already the the
page - these are Smear, Shade, Blend, and Smooth.

Select  the  largest round built in brush, the Dotted Freehand tool, and
Colour 0 (black).

Choose  Smear from the Mode menu, move the brush down to Venus eye, hold
down the left mouse button, and drag back and forth across her eye.

Notice  that  instead  of laying down black paint, your brush smears the
paint  already  on  the  screen.  Smear mixes the existing pixels rather
than changing their colours.

Choose  Smooth  from  the Mode menu, hold down the left mouse button and
drag your brush once along the edge of Venus' chin.

Again,  the  brush  uses colours other than black to paint with.  Smooth
reduces  the  contrast  between  two   adjoining   areas   by   painting
intermediate  shades  along the boundary of the two areas.  Smooth looks
at  the  current palette and finds the colours closest to the ones under
the brush.  If the palette contains a wide selection of colours close to
the  ones under the brush, it will have more colours to choose from.  In
our case, there are many colours between the dark brown of the chin line
and  the  yellows  of  Venus'  face,  so Deluxe Paint does a good job of
smoothing the edge.

Some  of the painting modes change the way the colours of your brush are
used.    In particular Matte and Colour determine whether a custom brush
will  paint  with  the  colours  in the brush, or the current foreground
colour Let's see how that works.

Click CLR to clear the screen.

Choose  Load  from  the Brush menu and load the brush named MultiCycleMe
from  the  Brush drawer of your Examples disk.  Choose Palette>Use Brush
Palette from the Colour menu.

When  you  load  a  custom  brush,  your  painting mode is automatically
changed to Matte.  Matte paints with the colours in your custom brush.

Drag the custom brush straight down your page to paint a broad stripe of
several greenish blues and reds.

Now choose Colour from the Mode menu and drag the brush down again.

This time your stripe is all one colour, because Colour uses the current
foreground colour and the shape of your custom brush to paint.

Choose Cycle from the Mode menu and drag another stripe.

Now  your  brush  paints  a  stripe  with  bands   of   colour   running
horizontally.    Notice  that  the  colours  change  in the order of the
colours  in  your palette.  Cycle uses the ranges in the Range requester
and  cycles  the  colours as it paints.  This is a good example of where
ranges affect the way a painting mode works.

Finally choose MultiCycle from the Prefs menu.  Select the Straight line
tool and drag a line straight down from the top of the page

MultiCycle  tells  Deluxe  Paint  to  cycle  each  colour  in your brush
individually  when  you use the Cycle mode.  Since your brush is made up
of many colours, they create a many coloured pattern.  Press the TAB key
to see how psychedelic you can paint with colorcycling and MultiCycle.

EXTRA HALF BRITE MODE

Hbrite  mode  is  only available if you are using 64 colours.  So, let's
change our screen format now.

Choose  Screen Format from the Picture menu.  In the requester, select a
Halfbrite mode and click Use.

Now  your  palette  should contain 64 colours.  The first 32 colours are
the  same  colours  you had in Lo Res format.  The second 32 colours are
Halfbrite equivalents of the first 32.

Let's take a look at how Hbrite paints.

Choose  Load  from  the  Picture  menu  and  load  the picture named New
Star-Hall  from  the  Picture  drawer  of  your Examples disk.  When the
requester asks if you want to change the screen format, click NO.

Now  select  the  largest  built in brush and the Dotted Freehand tool. 
Choose Hbrite from the Modes menu.  Scrawl anywhere on the picture using
the left mouse button.

Notice  that  when  you  paint  with the left button in Hbrite mode, any
colours  that  are  the  first 32 in your palette are changed from their
Halfbrite  equivalent.    This  makes  it look as though your picture is
getting  darker.    Hbrite  mode  is  a great way to add shadows to your
pictures.

Now scrawl over your picture again, but use the right mouse button.

Any  areas  of  your  picture  that  are  already in one of the first 32
colours of your palette are unaffected by your paint, but areas that are
painted with any of the 32 Halfbrite colours become lighter.

We've demonstrated only a few of the painting modes in this section.  Be
sure  to  take  the  time  to  review  the  description  of the modes in
Reference.

Clever  use  of  painting  modes  can  save you time and help you create
interesting effects.

Before you move onto the next section, choose Colour from the Mode menu.
This is the default mode.

KEYBOARD EQUIVALENTS

Most  artists  have found that Deluxe Paint's extensive list of keyboard
equivalents  helps  them  work  more  quickly  and  efficiently.  We are
committed  to  making  the  keyboard  commands an integral and important
feature of Deluxe Paint.  The most important thing to remember about our
keyboard  equivalents  is  that you can use most of them while the mouse
button  is  down!!!    This  means  that  you  can use multiple features
simultaneously.

A  simple example of where using the keyboard equivalents comes in handy
is in the case of trying to pick up a brush very precisely.  Here's what
you might do:

Click  the  Brush Selector.  Move the cross hair to the area you want to
magnify  and  press  m  to turn on magnification.  Begin surrounding the
area  you  want  to pick up and, while the mouse button is down, press m
again  to  turn  off  magnification.    Move the cross hair to the other
corner  of  the area you want to select and press m again to magnify for
precise  selection.  Finally, release the mouse button and you have your
brush.

This  is  just  one example.  There are more throughout the program.  In
particular,  when  you begin working with animation you'll find that the
keyboard  equivalents  let  you  do  many things that otherwise would be
impossible.    If  you  ever  need to use a menu option or other command
while  the  mouse  button  is  down,  go  ahead  and  try  the  keyboard
equivalent; it usually works.

You'll  find  a  complete listing of keyboard equivalents at the back of
this manual in Appendix B.

LOOKING AHEAD

Before  you  move  on to the next chapter, or off on your own to explore
Deluxe  Paint,  we want to introduce you to a few of the interesting and
powerful  features  of  the program.  You'll find more information about
these features throughout the manual.

FIXING THE BACKGROUND

This  section  shows a very powerful feature that lets you paint on your
picture without fear of accidentally messing it up.

Load  the  picture WorldMap from your copy of the Examples disk.  If you
are  prompted  by  a screen message asking you if you want to change the
Screen format or the number of colours, click Yes.

Choose Background>Fix from the Effect menu.

What  you  have  just  done  is  remarkably  simple,  and yet remarkably
powerful.      You have fixed the picture onto the background so that it
cannot be removed.  Try it.

Click CLR and see what happens. Thats right - nothing.

The picture is fixed, which means you can draw over it any way you like.

Select a thick brush and scrawl on the picture.  Do it with the airbrush
if  you  like.    Then  scrawl using the right mouse button and see what
happens.

When you have the background fixed, painting with the right mouse button
is  truly  erasing!  Note that you can paint on the picture and then fix
the  background  again to fix the new version.  You can erase everything
you  painted  since the last fix with a single click and you can "unfix"
the  background  as  easily as you fixed it: just choose Background>Free
from  the Effect menu.  This restores everything back to normal, so that
clicking CLR clears the entire picture.

We'll look more closely at this feature in the next chapter when we look
at  custom  brushes  and  the  way  they  interact  with the background.
Meanwhile,  feel  free  to  experiment  further  with this feature.  Art
restorers should have it so easy!

In  particular,  the combination of right button brush selection and Fix
Background  lets  you  lift  any  complex  shape  off a fixed background
(provided the shape was applied after the background was fixed), without
lifting  up  any of the background, Deluxe Paint preserves in memory all
those  parts  of  a fixed background that are covered by unfixed shapes,
which means that you can move the shapes around the page and uncover the
previously hidden background.

ANIMPAINTING

We realise that you may have just started painting on a computer for the
first  time.  But we'll take a daring leap forward to show you animating
on  a  computer.  Right now we'll show you a special kind of painting on
multiple  frames.    Just follow the steps carefully and you'll see some
wonderful results.
 
Choose  AnimBrush>Load  from the Anim menu.  Insert the Examples disk in
any  drive and click the Volumes button so that Examples disk appears in
the window.

Click Examples to select the disk volume.

Click the AnimBrush drawer in the window.

Double-click the file named "Sweep anbr"

When  the  requester  closes, you'll have an AnimBrush of a Karate black
belt  attached  to  your  cursor.  An AnimBrush is special in that it is
made up of many cels (short for celluloids) that flip as you paint.

Choose  Palette>Use  Brush Palette from the Colour menu to see the brush
in its own palette.

Click the brush down once.

Move the mouse, and click the brush down again

Notice  that  now  your  brush looks different.  Each time you click the
button the brush moves to the next cel.

Paint freehand across the screen to see all of the cels of the AnimBrush.

ANIMATION FRAMES

Above,  we  had  you painting with an AnimBrush on a single screen.  Now
let's  look at what happens if you paint one cel of the brush on each of
several  screens.   This is one way to create animations in Deluxe Paint
V.

Select Dark blue as your background colour and clear the screen.

Choose  Frames>Set # from the Anim menu.  (The Set Frame Count requester
appears).    Enter 20 in the Count field (You do this by clicking at the
right end of the field, backspacing over the existing number, and typing
the new number) Click OK.

In  a  flash,  you  have  20  animation  frames to paint on.  Notice the
numbers 1/20 on the left side of the Title Bar.  This tells you that you
are on frame 1 of 20 frames.  Let's paint!

ANIMPAINTING

Animpainting  is  simply  the  process  of painting at the same time the
animation  frames flip.  In most ways it is like regular painting, since
Deluxe Paint flips the frames for you.

Right  click on the Straight Line tool to display the Spacing Requester.
Click  the N Total button to highlight it.  Click in the edit field next
to  N  Total  and  set the number to 20.  Click OK to exit the requester
with the new settings.

Now  your  lines  will  paint exactly 20 stamps of the brush between the
start  and  end  points  of  the  line.  Using the N Total option of the
Spacing  requester  is an effective way to animate across a simple path,
as you'll see in a moment.

Press Shift 7 to set your AnimBrush back to its first cel.

Select  the  Straight  Line  tool.  Hold down the Alt key and drag out a
line from left to right across the screen.

When  you  let  go  of your line and the Alt key you'll see Deluxe Paint
paint your AnimBrush on each frame of your 20 animation frames.

When Deluxe Paint is finished painting press 5 on the keyboard.

The  Karate  expert shows all of his best moves.  Press 4 if you want to
see  your  aninmation  play  continuously.    If the animation moved too
quickly, press the left arrow key repeatedly to slow down the play rate.
Press the Spacebar to stop the animation.

TEXTURES AND MEDIA

A powerful new feature of Deluxe Paint V is the ability to mimic natural
textures  and media.  Using these tools, you can duplicate the effect of
drawing  with  traditional media such as water colour on rough paper for
example.    While  media  and textures work best in higher colour modes,
they can be used in any screen mode.

Here's  a quick demonstration to get you started.  First, we'll load and
use a background texture.

Select  Texture>Load...    from  the  Effect   menu.    The Load Texture
requester appears.

Click on the Textures drawer (in your Deluxe Paint directory or from the
Media disk), and select the Heavycanvas texture file.  Click OK.

When  you select a texture, the screen's appearance doesn't change until
you paint the texture onto it.

Select  a  light grey foreground colour and a background colour of black
to show the canvas texture.

Use  the  filled  square tool to paint the texture onto a portion of the
screen.

You  can actually see the background texture on the screen, and when you
paint  on  it  your  brush  will  react as if you were printing over the
texture.

Next, we'll load a media library to fully take advantage of our texture.

Select  Media>Open...    from  the  Effect  menu.    The Media requester
appears.

Click  on  the  Media drawer (in your Deluxe Paint directory or from the
Media disk), and select the Oil media library.  Click OK.

When  you draw on the screen now, you'll get the effect of an oil pastel
crayon  on  heavy  canvas.  There isnt any difference between drawing on
the  square where the canvas texture is visible other than the fact that
you  can  see  the  background texture plainly - the oil foreground will
appear  the  same in either case, and will show the effect of drawing on
the canvas texture.

Try  drawing  with both the freehand tool and the airbrush (try both the
Old  Style  and  Standard airbrush modes from the Airbrush requester and
compare  the results).  Now your Amiga can duplicate natural drawing and
painting methods with no messy cleanup!

SUMMARY

This  chapter  completes  the  Guided  Tour of Deluxe Paint V> Chapter 4
presents  some  painting tutorials, which will help you learn how to get
the  most out of the way the program uses colours and palettes.  Because
Deluxe  Paints colour capacity is one of the programs strongest and most
versatile  features,  we  highly  recommend  that  you  work through the
exercises we have described here.


CHAPTER 4 - PAINTING TUTORIALS
------------------------------

The  six  tutorials  in this chapter introduce some of the most powerful
painting  features of Deluxe Paint V.  Each tutorial is independent from
the  others,  so  you  can  choose  to  complete only the exercises that
interest you.

TUTORIAL ONE: WORKING WITH COLOURS

This  tutorial  will  walk  you  through using the Deluxe Paint V colour
requesters.

Start  Deluxe  Paint V fresh, and at the Screen Format requester, choose
Lo-Res 16 colours.

Sixteen  colours  is far from the maximum number of colours you can work
with,  but  it  is  a  good  place for us to begin explaining the colour
manipulation features of Deluxe Paint V.

MANIPULATING THE PALETTE

In  this  section  of  the  tutorial,  we'll  look  at  the ways you can
manipulate  your  palette.    This  will  help  you make best use of the
colours available to you in non HAM modes.

THE TOOLBOX PALETTE (WHAT YOU CAN PAINT WITH)

You may remember from the Guided Tour that the number of colours you can
paint  with  depend  on  the  Screen  Format you choose to work in.  The
important  thing  to remember in all modes except HAM and 24-bit backing
store  modes is that all of the colours you can paint with appear in the
palette  area  below  the toolbox.  If you are ever confused about which
colours  are  available to you, look at the Palette below the Toolbox to
see your colours.

Of  course,  you can change these colours to create the ones best suited
to the artwork you have in mind.  The common way to change colours is to
use the Palette Mixer.

THE PALETTE MIXER

Move the cursor over the Colour Indicator and click with the right mouse
button.

Right  clicking on the Colour Indicator displays the Palette Mixer.  You
can  also  display  this  requester  by  choosing Palette Mixer from the
Colour  menu, or by pressing p on your keyboard.  Use the method that is
most natural for you.

Palette vs. Colour Sets
One of the first things you'll notice about the Palette Mixer is that it
may  contain  more  slots  than  there  are colours in your Palette.  In
Deluxe  Paint  V  you  are  able  to mix and spread colours outside your
palette  as a way to "experiment" with colours before committing to them
in the picture.

There  are  16  colour slots to a row, and 16 rows numbered 0 through 15
for 256 colour slots in the Mixer.  We call this collection of slots the
Colour  Set.  The Palette is a smaller number of colours included in the
Colour  Set.    In the Palette Mixer the Palette colours are arranged in
rows 0-3.  When the Grid is turned on (it is off by default) the top and
left edges of each colour are outlined in white.  The top and left edges
of  non-palette colours are outlined in blue when the Grid is turned on.

When you first open the Palette Mixer, you have only palette colours and
the  rest  of  the  slots  are  empty.  Empty slots are indicated with a
checked  pattern.    If you try to paint with one of these colour slots,
you'll see that the colour is white by default.

RGB/HSV Sliders
First let's look at how you can change the colours that already exist in
your pallette.

Click on the bright red in the Palette Mixer and paint on the screen.

As you can see, you can still paint on your image when the Palette Mixer
is displayed.

Now,  drag the RGB or HSV sliders in the Palette Mixer to alter the red.

Notice that the colour on the screen changes as you change the colour in
your  palette.   The red in the Colour Mixer is a Palette colour, so the
colour  you  placed  on the screen is tied directly to the colour in the
Palette.  This is true of most Screen Format settings in Deluxe Paint V.
HAM and 24-bit backing store modes are the exception.  In these modes it
is  possible  to  paint  on the screen with colours that are not in your
palette.    We'll  explore  these  two  colour  models  in  a  moment in
Introduction to RGB and HSV Colour Models.

Deluxe  Paint  V  lets  you  set your colour values using either the RGB
(red, green, blue) or HSV (hue, saturation, value) models.  You'll learn
more about both of these colour models in a moment.

UNDO
Click  UNDO  in the Mixer to undo the change to the palette.  You'll see
both the colour in your palette and the colour on the screen restored to
red.

You can undo any change to a colour in your palette so long as you don't
click  any  other  colour  before  you  click  UNDO.  Undo remembers and
reverses  only  the  most recent change.  If you wanted to return to the
palette  and colour set you had when you first opened the Palette Mixer,
you would click REVERT.  The UNDO button makes it possible to experiment
with  colours  in  your picture and return to the original easily if you
don't like your experiment.

Copy and Exchange
You  can  rearrange  the  colours  in your palette by using the COPY and
EX(change) buttons.

With  the  red  colour selected, click COPY and click on the first empty
slot of your palette to copy the red there.

Click  the  Yellow  in your palette and copy it to the empty slot beside
the new red.

With  the  new yellow colour selected, click EX and click on the new red
to swap the positions of these colours.

Copy  and  Exchange  are  straigtforward ways to arrange colours in your
palette.    Perhaps the most important way you'll use them is to arrange
your palette for creating spreads between colours.

Spreading Colours
Spreading  colours is an effective way to get subtle shades of a colour.
Let's create a spread of colours from white to dark blue.

Click  on  the white in your palette colours.  Click SPREAD and click on
the dark blue at the right end of your palette colours.

Now  you  have  a  spread  of colours from white to blue with the colour
settings for each of the slots mathematically calculated to give you the
most  evenly  spread  colours  based  on the number of slots between the
white and the blue.

*  Note  that Deluxe Paint uses the HSV model to build its spread.  This
means  that  when  you  spread  between  blue  and yellow the colours in
between will run through the greens in the colour wheel.

Nany other functions in the program (including Ranges) use the RGB model
to  calculate  spreads  of  colour.    It is important to understand the
distinction  between these two colour models and how to use them to your
advantage.   If you arent already familiar with these two colour models,
be  sure  to  work  through  the section Introduction to the RGB and HSV
Colour Models below for an explanation of basic colour theory.

Colour Set
Now  that  there are no red; or yellows in your palette (though there is
one  of  each  in  your  Colour Set), we want to illustrate an important
concept.

SPECIAL NOTE

In any colour mode other than HAM or 24-bit backing store, if you try to
paint  with  a  colour  from the Colour Set that is not in your palette,
Deluxe  Paint  paints  with the colour in your palette that most closely
matches the Colour Set colour.

Here's an example:

Click on the red in your colour set and paint with it on the screen.

You should see that you are painting with the darker of the two greys in
your  palette,  because  this grey is the colour in your palette that is
closest to red in the RGB colour cube.  (You'll learn more about the RGB
colour cube later in this section).

Click on the yellow in your colour set and paint with it on the screen.

You  should  see that you are painting with the lighter of the two greys
in  your  palette.    As  we mentioned above, the best way to know which
colours  you  can  actually paint with when you are in any screen format
other  than  HAM  or  24  bit  backing  store  is to look at the palette
underneath the Toolbox.

The Mixing Area
The  mixing  area  lets you mix colours together the way an artist mixes
paint.    Like the extra colour slots in the Colour Set, the Mixing Area
can contain any of the possible colours, but unless you are using HAM or
24  bit  backing  store  modes,  you will be able to paint only with the
colours you place in your palette.  Lets mix a new colour right now.

Choose  the third round built in brush from the toolbox.  Choose the red
colour  from your Colour Set and paint with it in the Mixing Area.  Then
choose the yellow and paint into the red.

You'll  see  the  two colours mix together to form oranges.  As you mix,
your brush spreads the mixed colours, but each time you click down, your
brush starts over with yellow automatically so you can gradually add the
yellow to the red.

A second way to mix a new colour is drop exitting colours into the Mixer
Wells  on  either  side  of  the  Mixing  Area.    The   two colours are
automatically  blended  together  in  the Mixing Area to create a colour
spread.

Choose  red  from  the Colour Set, and drop it into the well on the left
side of the Mixing Area.

Choose  yellow and drop it in the right well.  The colours are gradually
blended together across the Mixing Area.

To  move  any of your new colours into the Colour Set, use the Pick icon
button at the lower right of the Palette Mixer.

Click  on  an  empty  slot  in the Colour Set, Click the Pick icon (Your
pointer  changes  to  an  eyedropper).   Click on a colour in the Mixing
Area.

The  colour  you  clicked  on is added to the Colour Set in the slot you
chose.

To clear the Mixing area to any colour and start over, you copy a colour
to the colour mixer.

Click  on black in the Mixing Palette.  Click the COPY button.  Click in
the Mixing Area to clear it to black.

Arrange Palette Requester
Although  we moved a few colours in the palette using the Palette Mixer,
the  best  place  to  accomplish palette color set arrangement is in the
Arrange Palette requester.

Choose Palette>Arrange from the Colour menu.

This requester lets you see eight rows of colours at a time, and you can
quickly scroll through the other eight rows with the up and down arrows.
Each  click on the arrows to the right of the colour rows moves the rows
up  or  down  by  one.   The number in the upper center of the requester
shows  the  number  of  the  row  at  the top of the list.  When you are
looking  at  the  first  eight  rows  (rows 0-7), this number is 0, when
you're  looking  at the last four rows (rows 8-15), the number is 8.  If
you  hold  down  the  Shift  key  when you click on the arrows, you move
directly to the first or last eight rows.

The  buttons  in  this  requester work just like the ones in the Palette
Mixer.    The  SPREAD option is especially useful in the arrange Palette
requester  because  it  lets you easily spread over multiple rows in the
set without having to scroll time rows.
 
The SELECT button allows you to select a contiguous range of colours.

Select the first colour in the range, and then click SELECT.  The cursor
changes  to an eyedropper.  Move the pointer to the last colour you want
to select and left click.  All the colours in the range are selected.

You can also select a contiguous range with the keyboard by Alt clicking
with the mouse.

To select a non contiguous range, Shift click on each colour you want to
select.   The colors in between the selections are not selected.  Deluxe
Paint  remembers  the  order  of  the  colours selected when you copy or
exchange them.

LOADING AND SAVING PALETTES AND COLOUR SETS

Deluxe Paint V also lets you load and save Palettes and Colour sets.  If
you continue on to the Ranges tutorial, you'll see an example of loading
a Colour Set.  Otherwise we recommend that you look in the Reference for
information on how to use these features.

INTRODUCTION TO THE RGB AND HSV COLOUR MODELS

In  this  exercise,  you'll be looking at the Reference Palette to learn
how  Deluxe  Paint  mixes  red,  green,  and blue to form other colours.
You'll  also  see  the  relationship  between  the  RGB  and  HSV  (hue,
saturation, value) colour systems.

Choose  Load  from the Picture menu and load the picture named Reference
Palette from the Picture drawer of the Examples disk.

If  you  see  the  message asking if you want to change screen format to
that of the file, click Yes.

The  Reference  Palette picture shows you a matrix of the colours in the
colour  spectrum:  Red,  Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, and Violet.  These
are  the  colours  that  are produced when you mix coloured pigment.  In
effect  these  are  the  colours  a traditional painter would work with.
This  is  not  the  spectrum produced when you mix coloured light.  That
spectrum  produces  the  colours  Red,  Yellow,  Green,  Cyan, Blue, and
Magenta.

Choose  Palette>Mixer On/Off to display the Palette Mixer.  Click on the
main screen to activate it.  Press F10 to hide the Menu Bar and Toolbox.

Now  let's  look at the RGB and HSV values of some of the colours in the
Reference Palette.

Click  the  Dropper  icon  in  the  Palette Mixer and then click the red
square  in  the  row  labelled  Pure Colour.  Look at the sliders in the
Mixer.

In RGB terms, your Mixer shows that a pure red is all red colour with no
green or blue.

In  HSV  terms,  pure red is hue 0 with full saturation and full value. 
Saturation  is  the relative amount of colour to white, and value is the
relative  lightness or darkness of a colour.  Value is often referred to
as Luminosity.  To see exactly what this means, let's change the sliders
a bit.

Drag  the  saturation  (S)  slider  all  the way to the left to see what
happens  to  the  colour.  Drag the saturation slider back to the right.
Now drag the value (V) slider all the way to the left.

As you drag the saturation slider left, the red gets lighter until it is
white.   As you drag the value slider left, the red gets darker until it
is  black.   Regardless of the hue or saturation, a value of zero always
produces black.

The  meaning  of  the  saturation  and value sliders is exactly what the
matrix  in  the Reference Palette shows.  Notice that the colours in the
Low  Satutarion  row are all pale - they don't contain much colour.  The
colours  in  the  Low  Value  row  are  dark  they  don't  contain  much
luminosity.   The colours in the Pure Colour row contain full saturation
and full value.

Hue  simply refers to the position of a colour on the colour spectrum or
rainbow  -  Red,  Yellow, Green, Cyan, Blue, or Magenta, and the various
shades  in  between.    Figure 4.6 shows the positions of colours on the
Colour Wheel.

Let's look at another colour in the Reference Palette.

Click  the  Dropper icon and then click on the yellow square in the Pure
Colour row.

The  RGB sliders show that yellow contains the maximum amount of red and
green,  but  no  blue.    Yellow is said to be the "complement" of blue.
Each of the primary colours has a complement.  In the RGB colour system,
the  relationship  of the primary colours and their complements are best
thought  of  as a cube in which each dimension is measured in one of the
three  primary  colours, as shown in Figure 4.7.  The complement of each
primary  colour is positioned at the opposite corner of the cube.  Thus,
moving  downward  on  the  edge of the cube to add red to green produces
yellow (R15, G15, B0) the complement of blue, which is positioned at the
opposite  corner  from  blue.  If you look back at Figure 4.6 you'll see
that  in the HSV colour system, the complements are also directly across
the circle from the primary colour - yellow is directly across the wheel
from blue.

Notice that black is the absence of colour (R0, G0, B0) and white is the
maximum  level  of  the three colours (R15, G15, B15).  The line running
diagonally  through the centre of the cube from black to white shows the
positions  of  the greys, which are formed by combining equal amounts of
red, green, and blue.  Thus R8, G8, B8 would yield a medium grey.  Let's
try this in practice.

In the Mixer, drag each of the RGB sliders to 8.  Once all three primary
colours are at 8, you have medium grey.

Look  at  the position of the value slider in your Colour Palette; it is
at the same level as the red, green, and blue sliders.

Note  that  if you are using an AGA machine the RGB scale is from 0-255,
not 0-5, so in the example above, to get a medium grey you'd set the RGB
sliders to 129, 129, 129.

The  mixing  of  greys  is one area where the HSV system excels.  Rather
than  moving all of the RGB sliders to the same position, you can simply
drag  the  saturation  slider all the way to the left and move the value
slider  to  the  level of grey you want.  The position of the hue slider
will have no effect, because there is no colour (no saturation) in grey.

Move  the hue slider left and right and notice how the grey you produced
doesnt  change.  Now move the value slider left and right to see how the
RGB  sliders  move  along  with  the  value  slider, always staying in a
perfect line.

Can  you  change  the  colour  back  to  yellow?  Remember yellow is the
complement of blue.

Move the red (R) and green (G) sliders all the way to the right and move
the blue (B) slider all the way to the left.

Now  that  you  know the basics, try mixing a few colours you like using
either  one  of the two colour mixing systems.  Here's a trick you might
also consider; mix a few palettes that you particarly like and save then
using  the  Palette>Save  option  in  the  Colour  Menu.    You can then
automatically  produce that palette by loading it from the Colour Menu. 
There is also some sample palettes included in the Colours drawer of the
Media disk.

Before  we leave the topic of colour mixing, let us just summarise a few
important points.

Your  Amiga  and Deluxe Paint mix colours using the RGB system, and this
system is represented by the colour cube.

If  you want to find any pure colour, you can do so using the HSV system
by  moving  the  saturation  and value sliders far to the right and then
scrolling the hue slider until you find the colour you want.

I  you need to produce a grey, you can do so by setting all three of the
RGB  colours  to  the same level, or by setting the saturation slider to
the left and adjusting the value slider to the grey level you want.

Besides  providing a sample spectrum for our colour mixing tutorial, the
Reference  Palette  is  useful  for adjusting your monitor to match your
printouts  Reload  the picture to restore it to its original colours and
print out a copy on your colour printer.  Then adjust your monitor until
the colours on your screen look the same as those on the paper

TUTORIAL TWO: WORKING WITH RANGES

In  this  section  you'll learn how to build a Range for use in gradient
fills  and  as  colour  cycling.    Deluxe  Paint  V has moved the range
functions  out  of  the  Palette  Mixer  requester  to  make ranges more
versatile in all colour settings.  First we'll show you how to work with
ranges in 32 colour mode, since this mode illustrates the basic concepts
you  need  to  master.    The  tutorial Painting in HAM will explain how
Ranges work in HAM.  So, before you begin:

Change your Screen Format to Lo Res 320 x 200 with 32 colours.

Before you begin building a range, we'll have you load a Colour Set that
contains a pleasant spread of colours to paint the range with.

Choose Colour Set>Load from the Colour menu.

When  the  first  Load Colour Set requester appears, load file Range.set
from the Colours drawer on the Media disk.

Once  the  Colour  Set  is  loaded, you are presented with a second Load
Colour Set requester that is similar to the Arrange Palette requester.

This  requester allows you to choose which colours you want to load from
the colour set to add to your current colour set.  And you can choose to
add  colours  to  your  current set, or you can overwrite the colours in
your  colour  set  with  the  new  colours.   This requester chooses all
colours  by  default.   We want to load all of the colours from this new
colour set and overwrite the colours that are in our current colour set.
To do this:

Click the Overwrite button.

The Overwrite button loads colours into your current colour set starting
at  colour  0.    After  the  Colour  Set is loaded: the Arrange Palette
requester is automatically displayed so that you can arrange the colours
as you like.  The Palette you'll see contains two spreads of colour that
paint smooth gradients even in the Low Resolution mode we are using now.
These spreads of colour were created by mixing the colour at each end of
the  spreads  in  the  Palette Mixer and then using the SPREAD option to
generate the colours between.

BUILDING THE RANGE

Choose Ranges from the Colour menu to display the Range requester.

The  Range Requester is Deluxe Paint's way of building ranges for use in
painting gradients or cycling colours.  You can build up to eight ranges
for  each  document, and these ranges are saved with the file.  When you
start  the  program,  it  contains a default set of colours in the first
range.    In  our case the default range contains the greys in the lower
half  of  the  palette.  We'll leave this range in place and build a new
one.    The  slider  in  the upper left corner of the requester lets you
choose the current range being used by the program.

Click to the right of the slider to move to range 3.

Range 3 should still be empty and ready for us to work with.  To build a
range,  you  place  colours on the bar just as you saw them in the first
range.  If Range 3 is not empty, click the CLEAR button.

Click on the last yellow in the requester.

Your  cursor becomes a rectangular bead, and the colour indicator in the
upper  right corner of the requester shows that you are holding a yellow
colour.

Move  the  cursor  to  the first mark on the range bar and click.  (Your
yellow  colour  appears  on the bar and your cursor reverts to an arrow)
Place the second yellow on the bar the same way.

TIP 
You  can speed up the process of placing colours on the bar by selecting
a range of colours and placing them on the range bar.  We'll do it now:

Select the red colour in your palette.

Click  SELECT or hold down the Alt key and then click on the last yellow
color  in  the  range  you  want  to select.  All colours in between and
including the two selections are highlighted.

Click the co1ours in place on the range bar.  The entire range is placed
on the range bar.

You don't need to put the colours right next to each other on the bar to
build  an  effective range.  And you dont need to put the colours in the
same  order  that  they  appear  in  the palette.  We're doing this only
because  this  is  the most conveinient way to work with ranges in modes
other  than HAM.  We'll show you some other variations on ranges when we
look at gradients in HAM and at Colour Cycling later in this tutorial.

Click and hold the SHOW button to see the range painted as a gradient.

You'll  see  a  gradient  painted  with  your  current range in both the
requester  and  in  a  bar above the requester.  The gradient inside the
requester  shows you the gradient using all of the colours available for
that  gradient in the Amiga colour universe of 4096 colours.  If you are
not  working  in  HAM  mode  (and we're not) the second gradient appears
above  the  requester  to show you how the gradient will look using your
current  palette.   Since our range was built from colours that exist in
the  palette,  and  we  placed  all  of the colours on the range bar our
gradient looks spectacular.

THE REVERSE BUTTON
 
The  REV (Reverse) button beside your new gradient does exactly what its
name implies - it reverses positions of your colours on the range bar.

Click  REV  once to see how it reverses the colours on the range bar and
repaints the gradients.

SMOOTH, PATTERN, AND RANDOM DITHER

At  the moment, the gradients you see for your range are painted using a
regular  pattern  that  produces an even transition between colours.  If
you want to exercise a little more control over your gradients or if you
want  to  eliminate  the  smooth transitions altogether, you can do this
with the Random button and Dither slider at the bottom left of the Range
requester.  When vou click the Random button, your gradients are painted
using a Random dither that you control with the Dither slider.

Click the Random button at the left of the requester.

Notice  that this cycles from Random to Pattern to Smooth, and then back
to  Random.   Click and hold SHOW and notice that now your gradients are
redrawn using a random dither.

Drag  the Dither slider all the way to the right to see how this affects
your  gradients.    Drag  the  slider all the way to the left to see the
gradient with no dither.

Click  the  Random  button  again  to  check  out the Pattern and Smooth
dithers.

Now  that you've seen how most of the Range controls work, let's move on
to painting with this range to see how it is used in gradient fills.

Click OK to close the Range requester.

GRADIENT FILLS

As  we  mentioned above, one of the areas of Deluxe Paint V where ranges
are  used  is  in the painting of gradient fills.  There are two general
types of gradient fills to know about in Deluxe Paint V.  The first type
of  gradient  is  the  linear style that has been supported since Deluxe
Paint III.  The second is a "directional" gradient that lets you specify
the  angle  of any linear gradient, and the central point for any radial
style  gradient.    We'll  show  you  how  to  draw one of each of these
gradients.

FILL TYPE REQUESTER

As  mentioned  in  the Guided Tour, the Fill Type requester is where you
choose  what type of fill your filled shapes and the Fill tool will use.
You  display  this  requester  by right clicking on the Fill tool or any
filled shape tool.

Right-click  on  the  Fill  tool in the Toolbox to display the Fill Type
requester.

The  lower  section of the Fill Type requester contains an assortment of
options  for  filling with a range.  You can choose which of your Ranges
you want to fill with, and how the program should perform the fill.  The
requester also shows you a representation of your current range and lets
you set the Dither just as you would in the Range requester.

LINEAR FILLS

The  first  three  icons  in the gradient area of the Fill requester are
fills  that  were  supported from Deluxe Paint III on.  Let's paint with
the first of these options to see what they are like.

Click the left/right arrows icon in the requester.

If  you  aren't  already  looking  at  Range  3  (yellow  to red) in the
requester, click in the Range box, delete the current number, type 3 and
press  Return to change to range 3.  You'll see the range painted in the
requester, Click OK.

Select the Filled Circle tool and draw a circle that is about two inches
wide.

In  a  moment  Deluxe  Paint paints a circle that is filled horizontally
with  your  gradient  from left to right.  The other two options in this
row  work  essentially  the  same  way.   They paint linear fills either
horizontally  or  vertically.    Try them out for yourself or see Figure
4.13 for an illustration of these gradients.

DIRECTIONAL GRADIENTS

Deluxe  Paint  V  introduces  new gradients that allow you to define the
direction  of  the  gradient  at  any  angle.    There are two styles of
gradients: linear gradients and radial gradients.

Linear Gradients
The two linear gradients are LINE and SHAP(E).  When you fill with these
gradients,  you  use  a "Directional" line to indicate the angle of your
gradient.

Select  the  Filled Circle tool, and press Shift - F to display the Fill
Type Requester.  Select the LINE option and Pattern dither and click OK.

Draw another filled circle that is about two inches wide.

When  you  release the mouse button, your cursor changes to a cross-hair
with a line connecting it to the centre of the circle.  We call this the
"directional"  line,  and  you  use  it  to define the direction of your
gradient.  Let's paint this linear gradient at an angle.

Position the cross hair so that your line extends up and to the right at
an angle of about 45 Degrees (as in Figure 4.11) and click.

This new circle is painted with a gradient at 45 degrees.

Radial Gradients
The  three radial gradients are CIR(CULAR), CON(TOURS), and HI(GHLIGHT).
When  you  fill  with  these gradients, you use the directional line and
cross hair to indicate the point from which the gradient will radiate.

Display  the  Fill  Type  requester.   Select the CIR option and Pattern
Dither  and  click  OK.    Draw  another filled circle that is about two
inches wide.

When  the directional line appears, place the line at a 45 degree angle,
but  this time make sure the cross hair is mid-way between the centre of
the circle and its edge as in Figure 4.12.  Click the mouse button.

This  time  your  circle is filled with a gradient that radiates outward
from  the  point  where  you  clicked.  The gradient is painted with the
first  colour of your range as the highlight colour where you click.  If
you  clicked  outside the circle, the gradient would still use the point
where  you  clicked  as the point from which the gradient would radiate,
and the effect would be different.  Give it a try if you like.

The  figure  below  shows  an  example  of  each  of  the gradient fills
available  in Deluxe Paint V drawn using the yellow to red gradient.  If
you  like, experiment with the other gradient fill types and play around
with  the Random dither setting too.  We also recommend that you try the
radial  gradients  with  different  shapes  to  get  a  feel  for  which
combination  of fill and shape gives the best results.  Of course "best"
is entirely a matter of personal taste

COLOUR CYCLING RANGES

In  the  Gradient  Fills  section you learned how to use a range to fill
shapes  with  a gradient.  You can also use these same ranges and others
to  create  colour  cycling  animations.    The  simplest type of colour
cycling  uses  ranges  of consecutive colours just like the one we built
for painting the gradients in the example above.  Deluxe Paint also uses
two other types of colour cycling that allow you to use colours that are
not  in  your  palette  in  a colour cycling range.  We'll walk you very
quickly  through  each  of the different versions of colour cycling, and
then  have  you look at some colour cycling brushes that are included on
your Media disk.

CONVENTIONAL COLOUR PALETTE CYCLING

The  simplest  form  of  colour cycling makes each of the colours in the
cycling range move over to use the colour in the next slot in the range.
This  type of colour cycling requires that you use multiple colours from
your  palette  to  perform  the  colour  cycle.    By cleverly combining
colours,  you  can  simulate animation with this kind of colour cycling.
There  are several examples of this type of colour cycling on your Media
disk.  Let's take a look at two of them now:

The Running Man
Choose Load from the Brush menu and load the Cycle2 brush from the Brush
drawer on the Media disk.

Your Brush is now several images of a running stick figure.

Choose  Palette>Use  Brush  Palette  from the Colour menu to change your
palette to the palette of the brush.

Make  Colour 0 your background colour and click CLR to clear your screen
to black.

Stamp down the brush and press the Tab key to start colour cycling.

Each  position  of  the running man was drawn in a different colour from
Range  1.  Because five of the six colours in this range are black, only
one frame shows at a time, as the white colour cycles into each position
in  the  palette.    The remaining five images are invisible against the
black  background (Display the Colour Mixer and change the black colours
in this range to any non-black colour to see all the frames).

The Spinning Wheel
Load  the  brush  Cycle1  from your Media disk; stamp down the brush and
press Tab to turn on colour cycling.

This  colour  wheel  was drawn as a circle with lines radiating out from
the  centre.    The  pie-shaped  pieces  were then filled with adjoining
colours  in Range 2 of the Range requester.  Thus, as the colours in the
wheel cycle, the wheel appears to spin.

The  brushes  Birds,  Snowball,  StormNight,  and  Fireworks  are  other
examples  of  this kind of colour cycling animation.  Load each of them,
change  to  the  brush palette or use the "Load With Palette" option and
turn on colour cycling to see how they work.

SINGLE REGISTER COLOUR CYCLING 

Cycling Deluxe Paint V also allow you to cycle a single register through
a  range  of  colours.  Rather than have you load an example to see this
effect, we'll have you build one from scratch.

Choose Palette>Default Palette from the Colour menu.

Display  the Ranges requester and move the slider to range 2.  Click the
Clear button beside the range to clear it.

Click  on  the  third colour in the palette (bright red) and place it on
the  left  side of the Range bar.  Place the bright yellow in the middle
of the range bar.  Click the Show button to show your new range. 

Now  you have a gradient that runs from red to yellow in the requester. 
(The  gradient  above  the requester looks a bit less impressive because
you  dont  have  all of the in between colours in your palette to make a
smooth  gradient)  At the moment, your range uses two colour "registers"
that is colours from your palette to build the range.  You can tell that
the  colours on the Range Bar are colours from your palette because each
of  the  colour  beads  has  a  little  dot  above  it.  This little dot
indicates  that  the colours are from the palette.  The secret now is to
change  the yellow to a non palette colour.  We do that by "picking" the
RGB value we want from the gradient in the requester.

Press  the  Comma  (,) key on the keyboard or the eyedropper icon to get
the eyedropper cursor.  Move the cursor to the bright yellow area of the
gradient in the requester and click to pick that bright yellow colour.

A  new bead is now your cursor and the colour indicator in the requester
shows that the colour is bright yellow.

Click this new colour bead directly over the yellow bead in your range.

Notice  that  the  new  yellow bead on the Range Bar does not have a dot
above  it.   This indicates that the colour is not from the palette, but
instead  is  an  RGB  value  that the program will use for gradients and
colour cycling.

Press the comma key or eyedropper icon again, pick a bright red from the
left  side  of  the  gradient,  and place it on the far right end of the
Range Bar.

Your Range Bar and gradient should now look like the one shown in Figure
4.14.
 
Move  the  Rate  slider in the requester to 50 and click OK to close the
requester.

Choose  the bright red in the palette and paint with it.  Then press Tab
to start the colours cycling.

You  should  now  see  your  bright  red colour cycle through orange and
yellow  and  back to red repeatedly.  Notice that the red colour in your
Toolbox  also cycles through orange and yellow but that no other colours
in  the  Toolbox  change.  You are cycling the colour on your screen but
using only a single colour register!

As  you  might  well  imagine,  this  new form of colour cycling is very
useful for stobing effects of causing an area of your picture to fade in
and out without giving up a lot of colours to do it.

HYBRID CYCLES

You  can combine the conventional colour cycling with RGB colours in the
range to create moving images that also strobe.  We've included a couple
of  these  on the disk to give you the idea.  Take a look at them now if
you  think  that you'll be using colour cycling in your pictures.  These
cycles are of special interest.

Choose Load from the Brush menu and load the Cycle Circle brush from the
Brush drawer.

Choose  Palette>Use  Brush  Palette  from the Colour menu to change your
palette to the palette of the brush.

Your Brush is now a blue and white circle.

Stamp down the brush and press the Tab key to start colour cycling.

Notice  that  although the original brush did not contain any yellows in
it,  as the wheel turns, yellow and gold colours strobe into the cycle. 
If  you  display  the  Range  requester and examine Range1, you'll see a
combination of palette colours (colour beads with the dot above) and RGB
colours (without the dot).  The brushes Fountain and Lighthouse also use
this  range  and  demonstrate  practical  uses  for  this type of colour
cycling.

TIP 
If  you  want  to  create your own colour cycling pictures that use this
hybrid  style of colour cycling, create a conventional cycle range first
and  paint  the  picture  so  that it animates correctly when you cycle.
Then  add the RGB colours to the cycle range to incorporate the strobing
effect.

TUTORIAL THREE: PAINTING IN HAM

Through  the wonders of HAM mode, the Amiga computer lets you paint with
4096  colours  simultaneously.   In the right hands, this mode can yield
wonderful results.  If you are not already familiar with painting in HAM
from  some  other product, it will likely take you some time to get used
to this mode.  This section will walk you through a tour of HAM as it is
implemented  in Deluxe Paint V.  If you are unfamiliar with HAM and plan
to  work in HAM at all, we strongly recommend that you work through this
section.

BEFORE YOU BEGIN

Start  the  program  fresh  and  at  the Screen Format requester, choose
Lo-Res 320 x 200 and HAM.

THE HAM PALETTE

The  first thing you'll notice when you start the program in HAM mode is
that  the Toolbox Palette now has arrows and a letter in the space below
it.

The  arrows  let  you scroll through the colours in your Colour Set, and
the letter tells you which of the groups of 16 colours you are currently
looking at.

Click  the right arrow below the palette several times to scroll forward
through the Colour Set.  Click the left arrow to scroll backward through
the Colour Set.

You  can  move quickly to the beginning or end of the Palette by holding
down the Shift key when you click the arrows.

Hold  down  the  Shift key and click the right arrow to move to the last
group of colours.  Shift click the left arrow to move to the first group
of colours.

The  first  group  of colours in the Colour Set (the "a" group) contains
your  actual  Palette colours.  The other colours are simply part of the
Colour Set, but unlike in other modes, you can actually paint with those
extra colours.

NOTE
The HAM8 Palette consists of 64 colours in 4 groups of 16.

So whats the difference between a Palette colour and a Colour Set colour
in HAM?  We're glad you asked?
