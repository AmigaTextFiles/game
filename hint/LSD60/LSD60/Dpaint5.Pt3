Display the Move requester. Set the Z Angle to 360. Click Draw.

Play  the  animation  back and you'll see that your planet orbits around
the central circle!

Using  the  brush  handle  effectively becomes a little more complicated
when  you  rotate over more than one axis, but you might want to spend a
little time trying different settings to see the effects you can create.


Scrolling Backgrounds

This  section  shows  you  how  to  create a scrolling background from a
single picture.  We'll use the new Camera Move requester to do this.

Horizontal Panning

First,  we'll  pan  horizontally  across  a background.  All you need to
create  this  effect is a picture with left and right edges that meet to
form a seamless image.

Load  the picture named WorldMap.lores from the Picture drawer (from the
Examples disk).

Type  Ctrl-j  (or  select  Spare>Copy to Spare from the Picture menu) to
copy  to  the blank spare page.  (We will use the spare page as the main
animation page).

Now  we'll  use the Camera Move requester to make the background picture
scroll seamlessly from left to right.  Because the image was designed to
wrap  seamlessly  from  edge  to  edge, the edge of the picture won't be
noticeable  -  it  will  appear that we are continually scrolling to the
right.

Open  the Camera Move requester (Anim>Camera Move...) by typing Shift-n.

Change the Count to 32 - this means that we will be creating a scrolling
animation  over 32 frames.  Make sure Wrap and Cyclic check mark gadgets
are  checked.  When Wrap is checked, the left edge of the screen appears
when you scroll past the right edge of the screen.

Press  Start.    This  means that we will be setting the position of the
first  frame  of  animation.   Click Adjust, and the Adjust bounding box
appears on the screen.

Click  and drag on the "field guide" bounding box so that the right edge
of the box is flush with the left edge of the screen.
 
You  can  use the Shift key to constrain your mouse movement so that you
only move in the X plane.  Press Shift, then left click and drag to move
the bounding box.

Press  Enter  or  Return to exit the "Adjust" mode (just like in perspec
tive).

Press End, and then Adjust

Place  your  screen  cursor  directly  on  top  of the crosshair that is
already  on  the  screen, and press .  (period key) on the keypad.  This
centres your field guide under your cursor (use it as a short cut).

Press Enter or Return to exit the Adjust mode.

Your  X  Dist box should read 319 or 320, and all other values should be
0.    Click Preview to check the preview to make sure the box moves from
the left edge of the screen.

If the Preview looks OK, press New to create new animation frames.

When Deluxe Paint has finished, press 4 to loop play the animation.  You
now have a scrolling Earth animation.

Press  s while in the animation to view the new frame rate speedome ter,
which shows the current frames per second value.

Save  the  animation  you've  just  created - you'll need it for another
effects  tutorial  later  in  this  chapter  where we'll show you how to
create a revolving globe animbrush from this animation.

This  example showed you how to create a scrolling background that moves
left  to  right,  but  you can create one that moves in any direction by
follow  ing  the  same  basic  steps  You can also use a picture that is
larger  than an animation frame to create your scrolling background.  To
do this you create or paint your large picture on the spare page without
changing the dimen sions of the main page.  Then repeat the steps above,
substituting  a  larger  X  move distance to move the width of the spare
page.

Vertical Panning
 
In  the following example, we'll pan upward on a screen background using
the Camera Move requester.

Load  the  EarthCore.HAM  image  from the Picture drawer of the Examples
disk.   Press Yes if the program asks if you want to switch screen modes
to  the image.  (The image is in 32Ox200 HAM6 mode with a screen size of
320x1080).

Press j to switch to the spare page.

Choose  Page  Size...  from the Picture menu, and click Screen to change
the animation page size to 32Ox200 pixels.

Select  Camera  Move  from  the  Picture  menu (Shift-n) to bring up the
Camera Move requester.

Click Zero to clear the distance paramerer boxes to 0.  Change the Count
setting to 40.

Click Start, and then Adjust.

Click and drag on the bounding box so that the bottom edge of the box is
flush  with  the bottom edge of reduced image on the screen.  If the box
isn't visible, press period (.) on the keypad.

Press Return or Enter to exit Adjust mode.

Click End, and then Adjust.

Click  and  drag  on the bounding box so that the top edge of the box is
flush with the top edge of the reduced image on your screen.

Press Return or Enter to exit Adjust mode.

Do  a  Preview to see if the box moves from the bottom edge of the image
to the top of the image.

Press New to create a new 40 frame animation.

Press  6  to  ping pong play the animation you've just created.  Use the
Set Frame Rate requester to slow down the animation if it's too fast (or
press  the  left  cursor  key  repeatedly while the animation is playing
back).

For added effect, add a pause at the beginning and end of the anima tion
using the Set Frame Rate requester

Filled Plane Effects

The  following  effects  use  the  Fill  option in the Move requester to
create  filled  planes that move.  In the first example, the plane moves
toward  you  so that it seems as though you are traveling, in the second
example,  the  filled  plane  rolls as though you are doing a roll in an
aeroplane.

Set the number of frames to 20.

Create  a simple filled circle brush to use for your filled planes.  (If
you  are  on a 1 megabyte Amiga, don't add any gradient or other detail,
because  these  filled  plane  moves require a lot of memory even with a
simple brush).

TIP
For  the  Moving  Ground  example,  it  helps  if your brush height is a
multiple  of  the number of frames you have.  This will produce smoother
results.  (Use Coordinates in the Prefs menu when you draw the brush and
pick it up to confirm that it has the dimensions you want).

Moving Ground
 
Enter Perspective. Press the Enter key on the keypad.
 
Position  the brush near the bottom right corner of the screen and press
Shift  Keypad  7  to  rotate the brush -90 degrees on the X axis.  Stamp
down the brush.  Click Undo.

Right-click  the  Grid  tool  and  note the number listed for the Y Grid
value in the Perspective requester.  Click OK.

Display  the  Move  requester.  Set the Y Distance to the same number as
the Y Grid value only make the number negative.  Click the Brush but ton
beside  the  Distance  boxes  so  that  you  move along the brush's coor
dinates.  Make sure the Count is set to 20.  Click Fill.
 
Deluxe  Paint  will  take  a  while to paint your 20 frames.  When it is
finished,  the animation will show a plane of circles moving toward you.


Rolling Horizon
 
Clear all frames. Choose Perspective>Reset from the Effect menu.

Press  Enter  on the keypad twice (this takes you out and then back into
Perspective).

Position  your brush near the bottom of the screen.  Rotate the brush to
-90 degrees on the X axis.  Stamp down the brush.  Click Undo.

Display the Move requester.  Click Zero.  Set the X Distance to -640 and
the  Y  angle to 360.  Make sure both Brush buttons are selected.  Click
Fill.

Again  Deluxe  Paint  takes a while to paint your 20 frames.  When it is
fin  ished  the animation will show the filled plane of circles rotating
around the perspective centre.

Spinning Effects

Here  are  two  terrific  spinning  effects.  In the process of creating
these  effects  you'll need to use a range of Drluxe Paint features.  At
this  point we assume you are familiar with all of the features, and our
instructions  are  at  times general.  These exercises are a good way to
test your knowledge of the pro gram; if you get stuck you should look up
how to perform the task we describe.

Amazing Bouncing Ball

A bouncing ball sounds complicated, doesn't it?  With traditional media,
it  would  indeed  be  tedious, but with Deluxe Paint you can master the
effect in no time at all.

To  produce  the spinning effect we want for the bouncig ball, you would
ordinarily need to do several things:

Create a range of colours to cycle.

Create a checkerboard pattern and wrap the pattern onto a circle to make
it appear spherical.

Create a ball shaped brush and rotate it so the ball spins on an angle.

These  steps  are  not  necessary for this exercise, however, because we
have cre ated a ball for you to use.

Load the brush named Ball.Brush from the Media disk.  Choose Palette>Use
Brush Palette from the Colour Menu.

Set the number of frames to 10 and clear all frames.

Press h to make the ball half its original size.

Go to Frame 1.

Display the Move requester, and click Zero.

Click Start, and then Adjust.  Place the ball so that the bottom edge is
near  the  bottom  of  the screen.  Press Enter or Return to exit Adjust
mode.

Click  End,  and  then  Adjust.   Place the ball close to the top of the
screen.  Press Enter or Return to exit Adjust mode.

Set  Slow  In  to  10.    Set  the  Count to 10.  Select Go From.  Click
Preview.

The  brush  should  move  upward  until it almost reaches the top of the
screen.    If it goes too far or not far enough, adjust the end position
and try Preview again.

Click Draw.

Noew  that  you've given the ball some bounce, you pick it up as a brush
and  send it bouncing off into the distance by using the Move requester.

Pick  up  the  animated  ball as an AnimBrush (make sure you enclose the
entire  area over which the ball moves).  Choose AnimBrush>Settings from
the Anim menu.  Click the Ping Pong icon.  Click Ok.

Clear  all  frames.  Set the number of frames to 40 and Go to Frame 1 of
the animation.

Move the brush handle to the lower right corner of the brush.

Go to cel 7 of the AnimBrush.  Place the cursor in the lower left corner
of frame 1 (so the brush is off the screen) and stamp down the brush.

Display  the  Move requester, and click Zero.  Set the X Distance to 600
and  the  Z  Distance  to 500.  Set the Count to 40.  Set Slow In to 0. 
Click Draw.

Turn on Colour Cycling and play the animation.

You'll see a remarkably realistic animation of a spinning bouncing ball.
If  you are adventurous try creating a plane for the ball to bounce on. 
You'll  need  to  adjust  the planes position to match the bottom of the
ball  where it bounces.  Then you create the plane on the Spare page and
merge  it behind the animation.  When you choose the Spare>Merge in back
option,  Deluxe  Paint  asks  if  you  want  to merge behind all of your
frames.  This fea ture makes it easy to build up animations from several
elements.

Creating the Spinning Ball

Here  are  the  steps for creating the spinning ball.  first you need to
create  a  range  of  colours to cycle.  These will ultimately produce a
spinning effect.

Display  the  Colour  Mixer dialogue and create a spread of eight identi
cal reds and eight identical whites.

Choose  Ranges  from  the  Colour  menu to display the Range requester. 
Select  an empty range or clear the first range and define these colours
as a range by setting the eight whites and eight reds next to each other
along the Range bar.  Set the Rate for colour cycling to the maximum.
 
Select Random Dither and move the slider all the way to the left to turn
dither  completely  off.  (Make sure that your reds and whites aren't in
any other ranges.)

Now you create a checkerboard pattern and wrap the pattern onto a circle
to make it appear spherical.

Display  the Fill Type requester.  Select the first gradient fill option
for a plain horizontal fill.

Select the red and white range you created.  Select the Filled Rectangle
tool.   Turn on Coordinates.  Select black as your background colour and
clear  the  screen.    Paint  a  rectangle that is 44 pixels wide and 22
pixels high.

You should now have a rectangle thar is white on one side and red on the
other.

Pick  up  your  rectangle  as a brush and create a red and white checker
board  pattern.   Then pick up exactly a 5 square by 5 square section of
the checkerboard as a brush.

Tip 
Using  the grid tool can help.  Set the spacing to 22x and 22y to easily
place the brush.

Clear  the  screen.  Display the Fill Type requester.  Select Brush Wrap
fill.

Turn  on  BeSquare  in  the  Prefs  menu (so your circle will be truly a
circle  cle).    Paint  a  filled  Circle that is approximately 3 inches
across.

There it is.  Press the Tab key to see the ball cycle.  You'll find more
informa  tion  about colour cycling and colour ranges in Tutorial Two of
Chapter Four: Paint Tutorials.

The Spinning Globe

This  example shows you how to create a spinning globe from the WorldMap
picture  on your Examples disk.  To accomplish this effect, you create a
scrolling  background,  pick  up  a  section  of  the  background  as an
AnimBrush, and use it to animfill a circle using the Wrap fill type.

If  you  are  working  on  a 2MB Amiga, we recommend that you start this
example from a fresh start of the program.  This fresh start will ensure
that you have no memory fragmentation and you have enough memory to work
with.    This  example is very memory intensive and may not work on some
2MB configerations.

Load  the  scrolling  earth animation you created and saved a few tutori
als  ago.    (If  you didn't save it, or haven't done that tutorial yet,
please do so now and then continue the steps below).

Press  the  4  key  to confirm that you have a scrolling map without any
glitches.   If it's moving too fast for you, slow it down using the left
arrow key.

Now you need to pick up half the scrolling image as an AnimBrush.

Go to frame 1.

Choose  Free  from the Brush menu to free up any brushes you may have in
memory.

Choose  AnimBrush>Pick  Up  from the Anim menu.  Select the left half of
the  image.   Enter 32 in the requester to pick up the left half of your
animation as an AnimBrush.

Now  you  have an animbrush of a scrolling map.  The trick is to convert
that to a ball shape.

Clear all frames to a black background.

Choose BeSquare in the Prefs menu.

Draw  a  solid colour filled circle in the middle of frame 1.  (Make the
circle about 3 inches across, and preferably a blue colour).

Choose  Frames>Copy  frames from the Anim menu and select the All Frames
button.  This will copy frame 1 to all of the animation frames.

Right click on the Fill tool to display the Fill Type requester.  Choose
Wrap as your fill type, and click OK.

Choose  AnimBrush>Use  from  the  Anim menu.  Press Shift-7 to posi tion
your  AnimBrush on its first cel.  (You will not actually see the brush,
but it will be ready in memory).

Press F3 to place your animbrush in replace mode.  (This is done so that
your globe's background is the same as your animbrushes).

Select  the Fill tool.  Hold down the Alt key and click on the centre of
your solid coloured circle.

Deluxe  Paint  will  automatically "animfill" to wrap the map image into
each  of  your  circles.   When it's finished, play the anim to see your
spinning  globe All that's left now is to pick it up as an AnimBrush and
move  it through three dimensions.  We'll leave that part up to you.  Or
if  you  like, try creating spinning balls with other images, like faces
or interesting patterns.  Once you've mastered this feature, you'll find
it hard to resist.

Multiple animation palettes

Deluxe  Paint  now  supports  multiple  palettes  in an animation.  This
tutorial  will  show  you how to force a different palette in a specific
amount of ani mation frames.

The  last tutorial showed you how to create a spinning globe.  Before we
show  you  how to force a multiple palette let's add an animation with a
dif ferent palette to the end of the spinning globe anim.

First save your spinning globe animation somewhere on your hard drive or
to a floppy disk.

Press Shift-2 to go to the last frame.

Go  to  your  spare page by pressing the letter j on your keyboard.  The
title bar should say SCRATCH.

Load DOGGIE BACKGROUND from the picture pull down menu.

Toggle back to your globe animation by pressing j again.

Let's  use  the Camera Move Requester to create a new animation which we
will put after the current one.

Press N to bring up the Camera Move Requester.

Lets  adjust the starting frame by pressing Start followed by the Adjust
button  in the requester.  This will bring up the Doggie Background from
the Scratch page.

Move  your  cursor  all  the  way up to the far upper left corner of the
screen and press the "." key in the perspective keypad.

The  period  key  centers  the camera view where the cursor is currently
posi tioned.

Press the Enter key in the perspective keypad to exit the adjust screen.

Press  End  followed  by  the adjust key again to adjust the end of this
camera move.

Move  your  cursor  all  the way up to the far lower right corner of the
screen and press the "." key in the perspective keypad.

Press the Enter key in the perspective keypad to exit the adjust screen.

You  will  notice  that  when you are adjusting these frames the palette
does not appear correctly.  Do not worry about this.  We will fix this a
bit later.

Make sure that you have WRAP checked in the requester.

Set the Frame count to 20.

Press  AFTER  in the requester to tell Deluxe Paint that you want to add
this new animation after the spinning globe.

Play  the  animation  to see the results.  You will notice that spinning
globe  animation  is  followed  by  a  diagonal  wrap  animation  of the
DoggieBackground  Picture.    You  will  also   notice   that the Doggie
Background  animation has scrambled colors.  Let's solve this by forcing
a palette to the second animation.

First  let's  tell  Deluxe  Paint  what  frames you want to add this new
palette to.

Select SET FRAME PALETTE...  from the ANIM/FRAME pull down menu.

Since  the  new  DoggieBackground animation covers frames 33 through 52,
enter these numbers in the range frame count.

Select the Range button, then select Make Palette.

This tells Deluxe Paint that you want a separate palette for these range
of frames.

Click OK.

If  you  look at FRAME PALETTE INFO in the ANIM/FRAME pull down menu you
will see that there are two separate palettes assigned for two ranges of
frames.  Now all we need to do is change the palette for the second anim
so it looks correct.

Press  3  on  your keyboard to open the Go To Frame requester, and enter
33.

Press j to go to the spare page.

Pick up any part of the screen as a brush.

Press j to go, back to frame 33.

Select USE BRUSH PALETTE from the COLOR/PALETTE pull down menu.

Now the two anims have their correct palettes.

NOTE:
There are three other ways you can force a specific palette.

1.    You  can save a color set for a particular picture and then reload
the color set into frame 33.

2.    You  can  save  a  color palette for a particular picture and then
reload the color palette into frame 33.

3.    You  can go to frame 33 and adjust the palette manually by editing
the colors in the color mixer or the arrange palette requester.

TIPS

This  brief  section  lists some tips for using Deluxe Paint's animation
features.   This is not a complete list of tips, so be sure you at least
scan  the rest of the manual if you are not inclined to read everything.


You  can  use Fixed Background to see the current frame as you modify it
for  the  next  frame.    This  is  very useful for freehand animations.
Here's how it works:

Create  some  animation  frames  and  draw  a figure on frame 1.  Choose
Background>Fix from the Effect menu.  Choose a different colour to paint
a  modified  version  of the first figure.  Press 2 to step to frame 2. 
Choose Background Free to stamp the modified figure on frame 2.  You can
repeat this process to paint the next modification, and so on.

If  you  want  your  brush  to grow (move toward the screen) in your ani
mation,  but  you need to stamp it in the small size for proper position
ing,  you  will  get nicer results if you paint the brush large and then
use  the  '  or Ctrl key in Perspective to shrink it before you paint it
down  for  the move.  This way the brush moves toward its original large
size  as  it  is drawn by the Move requester and the large size will not
suffer from "jaggies"

Slow  Out  and  Slow  In  from the Move requester always affect both the
Distance  and  Angle  motions.  So a falling, tumbling object won't look
right  -  the  tumble  accelerates  along  with the fall.  Here's a work
around:  Use Move to make a tumbling object without Slow Out or Slow In.
Pick the object up as an AnimBrush.  Now use Move to make this AnimBrush
fall  with  Slow  Out  for acceleration.  The tumble stays at a constant
rate, but the fall accelerates!

Sinmilarly Move can't Slow Out one Distance parameter and not the other.
That  means  it  can't make a cannonball fly at a constant x speed but a
decelerating  Y  speed  (to  form a parabola).  You can overcome this by
creating  the animation in steps as in the Amazing Bouncing Ball effect:
Use  Move  to paint a ball falling with Slow In Pick up the falling ball
as  an  AnimBrush.    Use  Move  (or the Straight Line tool with N Total
spacing)  to  paint  the  falling  ball  moving  across  the screen at a
constant rate.

If you want an object to completely disappear when it flies off to infin
ity  heres  a  trick: Set the x rotation to 90 degrees so that the brush
turns  "edge  on"  as  it  approaches infinity.  This way no more than a
single pixel line will remain of your brush.

When  you  paint your brush down to begin a move, Undo immediately after
you  stamp the brush.  This guarantees that the brush appears cor rectly
on the current frame when the move is painted.  Painting down your brush
before a move is how you tell Deluxe Paint where to start the move from.
You  don't  need  to leave the paint in place, since Deluxe Paint paints
that frame again as the first frame of the move.

You can't stamp the brush behind you, but you can Move it there.  If you
want  an object to start from behind the viewer and drop into the screen
with a perfect, unbroken motion, do this: Start from the centre position
and  use the Move requester set to a Count of 1 to move the brush out to
the position you want (for example, -1000 from the front of the screen).
Now  clear  the screen or reload the background for the aninmation.  Use
the  Move  requester  to  move the brush forward enough Z Distance to go
from behind you past the centre position and off into the distance.

If  you  have  a  series of pictures that use the same screen format and
palette,  you  can  use  Deluxe Paint V to give a slide show.  Just load
each  picture  into  a  frame  (see Load in the Picture menu for loading
multiple pictures) and set a slow frame rate or flip the frames manually
with the 2 and 1 keys.

Spacing Tips

When  you  animpaint  with the shape tools, use the Spacing requester to
control  the  number of brush stamps used to draw the shape.  In effect,
this setting determines how many frames you will paint over.

Instant Marquees: Set the Spacing requester to N Total and the number of
frames  you have, and animpaint unfilled shapes using a built in brush. 
Using  the  Spacing  set  to N total for animpainting is especially good
with  the  Circle  tool,  which otherwise paints a non cyclical pattern.
Also try set ting Spacing to Every Nth Dot, especially with the unfilled
Polygon tool.


CHAPTER 8 - REFERENCE
---------------------

Deluxe  Paint  V's Reference chapter contains all the information you'll
need  to  master the program, arranged in a way that's easy to use.  The
Tools  sec tion covers the Toolbox, explaining how to select, modify and
use the tools to draw basic shapes or otherwise manipulate your image by
colour,  size,  shape, or orientation.  The Menus section covers all the
options  available  in  the  pull  down  menus.  The menus are described
individually  moving left to right across the Menu Bar, and down through
each option.

Some  entries  in Reference cross-reference other parts of the manual or
other  sections  of  Reference.  We recommend that you look at the cited
section for more information about any cross-referenced entry.

Tools

When  you  start Deluxe Paint V the Toolbox appears on the right side of
the  screen.  It contains built in brushes, tools, the Colour Indicator,
and the Palette.

Select a tool by clicking its icon in the Toolbox.

You can hide the Toolbox to expose more of the painting area by pressing
F10 (this hides the Toolbox and the Menu bar).  You can then press F9 to
display  the  Menu  Bar  without  the Toolbox.  Press F10 to display the
Toolbox again.

The  following  tool  desctiptions include any keyboard equivalents that
are  available.    And  to  help  you  learn  these, we have suggested a
mnemonic  for each one.  You'll find these especially useful if you want
to  hide the Toolbox as explained above.  You can also find all keyboard
equivalents in Appendix B.

Built-In Brushes
There  are  ten  built in brushes you can paint with in the Toolbox.  To
select any built in brush, click on it.

Right-clicking  a  brush invokes the resize brush option.  When you move
the  brush  to  the  screen,  your  cursor  has diagonal arrows pointing
outward.  To increase or decrease the size of the brush, drag the mouse,
and when the cursor is the size you want, release the button.

You can also change the size of the current brush dynamically even while
you're  painting.    Press the plus (+) key to increase the size of your
brush  (no  need  to  press  the Shift key).  Press the minus (-) key to
decrease  its  size.    The icon in the Toolbox reflects any changes you
make.

The  smallest  a  resized  built  in  brush can be is 1 x 1 pixel.  The
largest it can be is 100 x 100 pixels.

Dotted Freehand
Keyboard Equivalent: s - mnemonic - sketch
Lets  you  paint  freehand  with the current built-in (or custom) brush.
Hold  down the left mouse button to paint with the foreground colour, or
the  right  mouse  button to paint with the background colour.  The tool
paints in a series of "splats" or "stamps" of the current brush shape.

The  spacing  between  each stamp depends on how fast you move the mouse
the  faster you move the mouse, the greater the spacing between stamps. 
If you move the mouse slowly there is no space between splats.

We  recommend you use this mode for drawing with custom brushes, or when
using the different paint modes.

Holding  down  the  Shift key while painting constrains the tool to move
either  horizontally  or  vectically depending on the direction you move
the cursor immediately after pressing Shift.

Continuous Freehand/ Filled Freehand Shape
Keyboard Eqnivalenr: d - mnemonic - draw D - Filled draw
Click  in  the  upper  left  corner of the icon to select the Continuous
Freehand  tool.    Click  in the lower right corner to select the Filled
Freehand Shape tool.

The  Continuous  Freehand  tool paints the brush in a continuous line as
you  drag  the  mouse.    This tool works like the Dotted Freehand tool,
except that

The  slower  you draw the smoother the lines.  Fast freehand drawing may
result in angular looking shapes, especially in higher resolutions.

Holding  down  the Shift key while painting with the Continuous Freehand
tool  constrains  the  tool  to  move  either horizontally or vertically
depending  on  the  direction  you  move  the  cursor  immediately after
pressing Shift.

Use the Filled Freehand Shape tool to draw filled freehand shapes.  When
you  release  the  mouse  button, your shape is filled using the current
setting  of  the  Fill  Type  requester (If you release the mouse button
before  you reach the starting point for your filled shape, Deluxe Paint
completes  the  shape  by drawing a straight line from the current mouse
position to the stating point of the shape).

Holding down i as you click on the Filled Freehand Shape tool causes the
tool  to paint shapes that are filled and then outlined with the current
brush  using  the  settings of the Spacing requester.  (See the Straight
Line  Tool below for an explanation of the options in this requester) If
you  use  a  custom brush as your current brush, it is possible to paint
shapes  that  are filled with one colour and outlined with another.  The
outline  is  painted  by tracing the shape with the current brush.  Note
that  the  shape  is traced by the brush handle; if the handle is offset
from the brush, the outline will be offset from your filled shape.

Right-clicking  on the Filled Freehand Shape tool displays the Fill Type
requester.   From here you can set the fill type for all filled shapes. 
See Fill Tool for an explanation of the options in this requester.

Straight Line Tool
Keyboard Equivalent; v - mnemonic - vector V - Spacing requester
Paints  a  straight  line  in  any  direction.  The width of the line is
determined by the current built in (or custom) brush.  To paint a line:

Select  the  Straight  Line tool, and position the cursor where you want
the line to begin.

Use  the  left  mouse button to paint with the foreground colour, or the
right mouse button to paint with the background colour.

Drag in any direction to create a line.
 
Holding down the Shift key while painting a straight line constrains the
line to be either horizontal or vertical, depending on the direction you
move the cursor immediately after pressing Shift.

Holding  down the Ctrl key as you paint a straight line, causes the line
to leave "traces" as you paint. 

Right  clicking  the  Straight Line tool displays the Spacing requester.
The  Spacing  requester  lets  you  specify  the space between the paint
"splats"  deposited  by  the  brush.    Click  to choose any of the four
options in the requester.

N Total 
Defines  the  total  number  of "splats" that will occur along the line.
You  can  define  the  number  of  "splats"  by  clicking  the edit box,
backspacing  or delet ing over the existing value, and typing in the new
value.    This  setting  is  espe  cially  useful for ensuring that when
animpainting over a series of frames you get exactly the number of brush
stamps you need.

Every Nth dot
Spacing  sets  the  number  of pixels between each "splat" of the brush.
This lets you space your brush splats accurately.

Airbrush
Paints  using  the  Airbrush  tool  along  the  path defined by any tool
affected  by  the  Spacing  requester.    The number to the right of the
button  sets  the  number of airbrush sprays to be applied at each pixel
along  the  path.  This creates a fuzzy line or shape.  You can use this
feature  with  the  painting  modes  from  the  Modes  menu  to   create
interesting  effects.  For example using Smear with the Airbrush spacing
can  create interesting textured effects on a coloured background.  This
option  can only be used with the "splatter" Old Style airbrush, not the
Standard airbrush.

Continuous
This  spacing  paints  an  unbroken  path  with  no space between pixels
Continuous is the default setting.

Curve Tool
Keyboard Equivalent; q - mnemonic qurve
Use  the Curve tool to draw an arc between two points.  The width of the
line is determined by the current built-in (or custom) brush.  The Curve
works like the Straight Line tool, except that the line remains attached
to your cursor, so you can specify the third point in the arc.

Select  the Curve tool, and position the cursor where you want the Curve
to begin.

Drag  to where you want the curve to end, and release the mouse but ton.

Move  the  mouse  in  any  direction to form the arc shape you want, and
click.

Holding  down  the  Shift  key  while  painting  with  the  Curve  tool,
constrains  the  tool  to  move either horizontally or vertically as you
paint  the  initial line, depending on the direction you move the cursor
immediately  after  pressing Shift.  This is useful if you want the ends
of your curve to line up horizontal ly or vertically.

Holding  down  the  Ctrl  key  as you paint a curve, causes the curve to
leave "traces" as you paint.

Right  clicking  the  Curve  tool  displays  the  Spacing requester (see
Straight  Line  Tool,  above,  for an explanation of the options in this
requester).

Fill Tool
Keyboard Equivalent; f - mnemonic fill. F - Fill Type requester
Use the Fill tool to fill an enclosed area using the current settings in
the Fill Type requester.  To use the tool:

Move  the  paint  can cursor over the enclosed area you want to fill, so
that the tip of the spout is within the area.

The spout is the one pixel opening at the bottom of the "splash,"

Click to fill the enclosed area.

Holding  down  i when you click with the Fill cursor fills any irregular
shape,  including gradients, outward to the background colour.  In other
words,  the  fill  spreads outward until it reaches areas of the current
background colour.

Holding  down the Alt key when you click with the Fill cursor, animfills
the  shape.  This means that the frames of your animation will flip, and
the  fill  tool will fill outward on each frame from the point where you
clicked.    This  option  works  with  all  of the Fill Types except the
gradient  fills  that  use  the  gradient  direction  line to define the
gradient.

Right-clicking  the  Fill  tool  displays  the Fill Type requester.  The
options  in  the  requester  are  explained in the following paragraphs.
When  you  return to the painting screen after choosing a fill type, the
current  gradient  (or  pat tern, if Pattern or Perspective is selected)
and  its  orientation  are shown in the Colour Fill box in the Title Bar
(see User Feedback in Title Bar later in this chapter)

Fills  with  the  current colour.  If you paint or fill your shape using
the left button, the shape is filled with the foreground colour.  If you
paint or fill your shape using the right mouse button, it is filled with
the background colour.  This is the default mode.

Brush
Fills with one image of the current custom brush and sizes it to fit the
filled area.  See Figure 8.8.

Wrap
Fills  with  one image of the current custom brush and adjusts it to the
hori  zontal  and  vertical  shape  of  the filled area.  This gives the
illusion  of  wrap ping the brush around a 3D solid.  The effect is most
pronounced if you use it to fill a shape that is very different from the
shape of the custom brush.  See Figure 8.8.

Perspective
Fills  with  a  pattern  of the current brush in the current perspective
setting (see Perspective under the Effect menu).

Rub
Fills  using Rubthru mode, where the picture on the spare page is rubbed
through  to  the  area  to  be filled.  The current Translucency setting
determines  how much of the picture is rubbed through (100% translucency
equals  0%  of  the image being rubbed through).  This option is ghosted
unless a space page is available.

Hbrite
Fills using the Hbrite painting mode.  In effect, this is a special form
of  tint  ing  that  only works if you are working in a Halfbrite screen
mode  (see  HBrite  in  the  Mode  menu,  below).  When you are not in a
Halfbrite screen mode, this option is ghosted in the requester.  Drawing
with  the  right mouse button over Halfbrite areas reverts them to their
full colour counterparts.

Pattern
Fills  with  a  pattern made from a brush.  To use this option, you must
first  click  the  From  Brush button to create a pattern of the current
brush.    This  pattern remains the current fill pattern until you click
From Brush again to create a new pattern from your new custom brush.

Range
Fills  a  enclosed  object  with  a  spread  of colours (a gradient, see
Gradients  below) from the selected range.  Type in a number from 1-8 to
specify  the  range  you  want  to use.  Click to select one of the fill
options, which specify the direction and type of the gradient fill.  You
can only use one fill option at a time.

Horizontal paints the gradient horizontally.

Vertical paints the gradient vertically with an even distribution.

Horizontal  Line  paints the gradient one line at a time and adjusts the
gradi  ent  on  each  line  so that it follows the contours of the shape
being filled.

Gradients

Deluxe  Paint  supports  two  types  of gradients: Linear and Radial.  A
Linear  gradient  fills  an object in one direction (in a line), and can
either  take  the  object's  shape into account, or ignore it.  A Radial
gradient  fills  an  object  in all directions (radially) from the point
where  you  click,  until it reaches the boundaries of the object.  Like
Linear  gradients,  a Radial gradient can either take the object's shape
into account, or ignore it.

Linear Gradients
The  linear  gradients  are  Line and Shap(ed).  When you fill an object
with either of these options, a gradient directional line stretches from
the  centre  of  the object to the cursor.  Use this line to tell Deluxe
Paint  the  direction in which to fill the shape with the gradient.  For
example,  if  you move the directional line to the top of your shape and
click, Deluxe Paint fills your shape with the selected gradient from top
to  bottom.   The first colour in the gradient (in the far left position
in the range) appears at the bottom of the shape.

Line fills the object with a uniform linear gradient, ignoring the shape
of the object.

Shaped  fills the object with a linear gradient, taking the shape of the
object  into  account,  so  gradient  lines  tend to follow the object's
contours.

Radial Gradients
The  radial  gradients  are Cir(cular), Cont(ours), and (Hi)light.  When
you select any of them and click on a shape, a gradient directional line
stretches  from the centre of the object you filled to the cursor.  Move
the  cursor which is attached to the directional line, to the spot where
you  want  the gradient to begin and click.  Deluxe Paint will fill your
shape  radially  outward  from  the  point  where  you  clicked.  Radial
gradients are especially useful for drawing shadows and other consistent
three dimensional lighting effects.

Circular  fills  the  object with a circular (shaped) gradient radiating
outward  from the point where you click.  Like the Straight linear fill,
above, Circular does not take the shape of the object into account.

Contours  fills  the  object  with  the gradient taking the shape of the
object  into  account.    This  creates a contour effect, reminiscent of
topographical maps.

Highlight  is  similar  to Contours, but optimised to create a highlight
effect.    Like Contours, the object is filled with its shape taken into
account.  See Figure 8.12 for a comparison between the two methods.

Dither
Deluxe  Paint  draws patterned gradients by dithering, which reduces the
con  trast  between  adjacent  colours  (without  changing  the  colours
themselves).    Clicking  the  cycle button cycles through the following
choices:

Random
When  Random  is selected, you can adjust the degree of colour mixing in
the  gradient fill.  Drag the Dither slider left or right to decrease or
increase  the  amount  of dither.  Setting the slider all the way to the
left  gives  almost  no mixing between shades.  Moving the slider to the
right increases the amount of mixing at the colour boundaries.

Pattern
When  Pattern is selected, Deluxe Paint creates a fixed pattern dither. 
This mode is useful for creating fills in modes with fewer colours.

Smooth
When  Smooth  is  selected,  Deluxe  Paint  utilizes  a  Floyd Steinberg
dithering  technique  that  smoothes the contrast between the colours in
your  gradient as best as possible.  This mode is most useful in HAM and
24-bit backing store modes, where more colours are available.

Airbrush Tool

Simulates  the action of an airbrush by spraying with the current brush.
Two  styles  of spray distribution are available: Old Style (random) and
Standard.

Select  the Airbrush tool.  Position the cross hair on the page and drag
to paint.

Click twice on the Airbrush tool to select Standard mode rather than Old
Style (the default).

Holding  down  the  Shift key while painting with the Airbrush tool, con
strains  the tool to move either horizontally or vertically depending on
the direction you move the cursor immediately after pressing Shift.

Press  the + and - keys to increase or decrease the size of the airbrush
when it is active.

Airbrush Settings requester

Keyboard  Equivalent:  Alt-A  - open requester.  A - Cycle Airbrush Type
Right  clicking  the  Airbrush  icon  displays  the  Airbrush   Settings
requester This requester lets you select the type of airbrush and radius
and flow para meters.

Airbrush Type
Choose between Old Style or Standard.  Old Style is the airbrush used in
previous  incarnations  of Deluxe Paint; pixels of the foreground colour
are  randomly  sprayed  within the radius settings of the airbrush.  You
can  per  form brush stamp painting with the Old Style airbrush, but not
in Standard mode.

In  Standard  mode,  the program paints similar shades of the foreground
colour  to  create  a  seamless,  blending  effect.    Just  like a real
airbrush,  paint  builds  opacity  gradually as you continue to spray an
area  (the  rate  your colour becomes opaque is controlled with the Flow
slider below).  In Standard mode the colours you paint with are affected
(tinted)  by  the  colour  you  paint on.  Note that only the four round
brushes  are  available with a Standard airbrush; the square brushes are
grayed out.

To  cycle between Old Style and Standard airbrush types without open ing
the Airbrush Settings requester, type A.

Radius
Use  the  slider  or  text  gadget to set the airbrush radius from 1-100
pixels The larger the number, the larger the sprayed area.

Flow
Changes  the  rate  of paint opacity build up in Standard mode on higher
settings equate to faster opacity.  Use the slider or text gadget to set
a value from 100.

Size 
This button lets you resize the nozzle.  After clicking the button, move
the cursor onto the page and drag the mouse until the nozzle is the size
you want, then release the mouse button.

Clear Area
Clear  the  test  area, which is a window/view onto your page.  Clearing
this area doesn't affect the underlying image.

NOTE
Airbrushes  are  palette  dependent.    Therefore,  if  you paint with a
Standard  airbrush,  but  see  nothing,  you  need more contrast between
background and foreground colour.

Unfilled/Filled Rectangle

Keyboard Equivalent: r unfilled. R - filled; mnemonic - rectangle

Use  the Rectangle tool to paint a rectangle shape using any brush.  The
upper left half of the tool paints a rectangle outline using the size of
the  cur  rent  brush and the current settings of the Spacing requester.
The  lower  right  half  of the tool paints a filled rectangle using the
current settings of the Fill Type requester.

Select the Rectangle tool, and position the cursor on the page where you
want the rectangle to begin.

Drag  the  cursor diagonally to form a rectangle.  When the rectangle is
the size you want, release the mouse button.
 
Holding  down  the Shift key while painting with the Rectangle tool, con
strains  the  rectangle  to  be the same number of pixels wide and high.
You'll  notice  that  this  shape  is not necessarily a square.  This is
because  the  pixels  in  the  Amiga display are not square.  To paint a
square,  turn on the Be Square option in the Prefs menu.  When Be Square
is  on,  Deluxe  Paint  V adjusts the height and width of your square so
that it appears square rather than being square in terms of pixel count.

Holding down the Ctrl key as you paint a rectangle, causes the rectangle
to leave "traces" as you paint.

Holding down i as you click on the Filled Rectangle tool causes the tool
to paint shapes that are filled and then outlined with the current brush
using  the  settings of the Spacing requester.  (See Freehand Shape Tool
for more information).

Right  clicking  on  the  Unfilled  Rectangle  tool displays the Spacing
requester.    Use  this requester to set the spacing between "splats" in
the sides of your rectangle (See Straight Line Tool, above).

Right  clicking  on  the  Filled  Rectangle  tool displays the Fill Type
requester.   Use this requester to set the type of fill you want in your
rectangle.    See  Fill  Tool  for an explanation of the options in this
requester.

Unfilled/Filled Circle

KeyboardEquivalent: c - unfilled. C filled; mnemonic - circle

Use  the  Circle  tool to paint circles using any brush.  The upper left
half of the tool paints a circle outline using the current brush and the
current-set tings of the Spacing requester.  The lower right half of the
tool  paints a filled circle using the current settings of the Fill Type
Requester.

Select  the  Circle  tool, and position the cursor on the page where you
want the centre of the circle.

Drag the cursor in any direction to from the circle.  When the circle is
the size you want, release the mouse button.

The  circles  that  Deluxe  Paint  V  paints  may  not  appear perfectly
circular.    Circles are painted to be the same number of pixels high as
they are wide.  The circles do not appear perfectly circular because the
pixels of the Amiga display are not square.  If you want your circles to
appear  circular,  turn  on  the Be Square option in the Prefs menu (see
Prefs Menu below).

Holding  down  the  Ctrl key as you paint a circle, causes the circle to
leave "traces" as you paint.

Holding down i as you click on the Filled Circle tool causes the tool to
paint  shapes  that  are filled and then outlined with the current brush
using  the  settings of the Spacing requester.  (See Freehand Shape Tool
for more information).

Right-clicking  on  the  Unfilled  Circle  tool  displays  the   Spacing
requester.    Use  this requester to set the spacing between "splats" in
the sides of your cir cle (See Straight Line Tool, above).

Right  clicking  on  the  Filled  Circle  tool  displays  the  Fill Type
requester.   Use this requester to set the type of fill you want in your
circle.    See  Fill  Tool  for  an  explanation  of the options in this
requester.

Unfilled/Filled Ellipse

Keyboard Equivalent: e - unfilled. E - filled; mnemonic - ellipse

Use  the  Ellipse  tool to paint an ellipse.  The width and shape of the
line  is  determined  by  the current brush.  The upper left half of the
tool paints an ellipse outline using the current settings of the Spacing
requester.    The  lower  right half of the tool paints a filled ellipse
using the current setting of the Fill Type requester.

Select  the Ellipse tool.  Position the cursor where you want the centre
of the ellipse to be and click.

Move the cursor in any direction to form the shape you want.

Drag  the  mouse in a circular motion to rotate the ellipse.  The degree
of rotation is shown in the menu bar.

When  the ellipse is positioned in the orientation you want, release the
mouse button.

Holding  down the Ctrl key as you paint an ellipse causes the ellipse to
leave "traces" as you paint.

Holding  down  i as you click on the Filled Ellipse tool causes the tool
to paint shapes that are filled and then outlined with the current brush
using  the  settings of the Spacing requester.  (See Freehand Shape Tool
for more information).

Right  clicking  on  the  Unfilled  Ellipse  tool  displays  the Spacing
requester.    Use  this requester to set the spacing between "splats" in
the sides of your ellipse (See Straight Line Tool, above).

Right  clicking  on directory affects
your system globally not just in Deluxe Paint.

If  you  have  a hard drive and keep your fonts in several drawers or in
drawers  a  couple  of  levels deep, you may want to add assigns to your
existing  FONTS:  assign  so  that  you  can access your font collection
quickly in the Font requester.  Please consult your Amiga owners manu al
or  Amiga  DOS  manual  to  learn how to properly use the Assign command
before  you  experiment with this.  Following is an example of an Assign
you  cannts  a  filled  polygon  using  the current settings of the Fill Type
requester.

Select  the  Polygon tool, and position the cursor where you want one of
the corners of the polygon.

Click and then move the mouse in any direction to pull out a side of the
polygon.

Click  to  tack  down  each  corner  of  the  polygon.   Clicking on the
Polygon's point of origin completes it.

You can complete a polygon without having to search for the point of ori
gin by pressing the space bar.  This automatically completes the polygon
by  connecting  your last corner with the origin however if you're using
the  Unfilled Polygon tool, pressing the space bar will not complete the
polygon.    You'll  need  to  connect  the last corner with the point of
origin yourself.

Holding  down  the  Ctrl  key as you paint a polygon, causes the polygon
sides to leave "traces" as you paint.

Holding  down  i as you click on the Filled Polygon tool causes thc tool
to paint shapes that are filled and then outlined with the current brush
using  the  settings of the Spacing requester.  (See Freehand Shape Tool
for more information).

Right  clicking  on  the  Unfilled  Polygon  tool  displays  the Spacing
requester.    Use  this requester to set the spacing between "splats" in
the sides of your polygon.  (See Straight Line Tool, above).

Right  clicking  on  the  Filled  Polygon  tool  displays  the Fill Type
requester.   Use this requester to set the type of fill you want in your
polygon.    See  Fill  Tool  for  an  explanation of the options in this
requester.

Brush Selector

Keyboard  Equivalent:  b  -  new  brush, cycle through pickup modes; B -
previous brush; mnemonic - brush

Use  the  Brush  Selector to create a custom brush from any image on the
page, or to recall your most recent custom brush.

To select a rectangular brush:

Select  the  Brush  Selector  and  move the cursor to the page, where it
becomes a large cross-hair.

Drag diagonally to enclose the area you want to use as a brush.  Release
the mouse button to select it.

To select a polygonal brush:

Double  click  the Brush Selector to select it.  The Brush Selector icon
now looks like the Polygon tool.  In this mode you can select an area to
use as a brush in both polygonal and freehand modes.

Polygon
You  can  now surround the area you want to pick up as a brush as though
you  were  drawing  with  the  Polygon  tool.  As with the Polygon tool,
pressing the space bar completes the brush selection automatically.

Freehand
If you hold down the left mouse button, you can draw in freehand mode to
select  the  area  you  want to pick up as a brush.  As in Polygon mode,
pressing  the  space  bar  completes the brush selection automati cally.
You can also combine straight line clicking and freehand drawing to pick
up a brush area.

To select a magic pickup brush:

Triple  click  the Brush Selector to select it.  The Brush Selector icon
now looks like a magic wand.

Clicking  the left mouse button picks up the entire area contiguous with
the  selected  pixel  (ie.   the contiguous shape connected to the pixel
without  being  broken  by the background colour).  For instance, if you
click  in  the middle of a filled circle, the entire circle is picked up
as a brush.

NOTE
If the selected colour is the same as the background colour, the program
will pick up a 1 pixel transparent brush.

The  Magic  Pickup tool provides a quick way to pick up irregular shapes
in one simple action.

Holding  down the Ctrl key while selecting with the magic pickup selects
only  the contiguous area the same colour as the selected pixel.  If the
pixel  is  the same colour as the brush's transparency colour, the Magic
Pickup  tool  will pick up a completely transparent brush, the bounds of
which match the shape of the contiguous background-coloured pixels.

Left vs. Right Button
Using  the  left  mouse  button  to  pick  up  a brush simply copies the
selected  area  as  a brush.  Using the right button to select the brush
cuts the selected area from the page to make the brush, and replaces the
area with the current background colour.

When  you pick up a brush, any colours that match the current background
colour  are  transparent.  If you have AutoTransp turned on in the Prefs
menu,  this  additional rule applies: if all corners of the brush are of
the  same colour, that colour becomes transparent, regardless of whether
it is the back ground colour.  (See AutoTransp in the Prefs menu).

You  can  retrieve  your  most recent custom brush or AnimBrush by right
clicking the Brush Selector or pressing Shift-b.

Holding  down the shift key while selecting a brush with the rectangular
Brush Selector will constrain the brush to be a square.  This means that
it  will  be  the same number of pixels high as it is wide.  Because the
pixels  of  the  Amiga display are not square, your brush may not appear
square.    If  you want the brush to appear square, turn on Be Square in
the Prefs menu before you select the brush.

Text

Keyboard Equivalent: t - mnemonic - text. T - Choose Font requester

Use the Text tool to add text to your picture.

Select the Text tool, and move the cursor to the page.

Click  to  place the text cursor.  Type on the keyboard to enter text in
the current foreground colour.

The  text  will automatically wrap around the right edge of the page and
restart below the original cursor position.  If your page size is larger
than  the  screen,  the  page  scrolls  as  you type off the edge of the
screen.    The  text  tool  does not automatically word-wrap like a word
processor.

You can use the Backspace key to erase text, and the Return key to begin
a new line.  To exit text mode, press Esc or click a painting tool.

You cannot backspace over typed characters if the screen scrolls.

Right  clicking  the  Text Tool displays the Choose Font requester.  Use
this requester to choose fonts, sizes, and styles for your text.  Deluxe
Paint  V  uses  the  standard Amiga ASL font requester.  For information
about how this requester operates, consult your system's user manual.

The  scrolling  font  list  displays the fonts that are available in the
FONTS: directory.  To choose a font, click on its name.

Choose a size for the font by clicking on the up and down arrows next to
the  size  edit  box.   The scrolling list of sizes is restricted to the
currently avail able sizes for the font that you have chosen.  To choose
a  font size that is not available from the menu, type the point size in
the size edit field.

Choose  a  style  for  the  font  by  clicking  on the Bold, Italic, and
Underline  check  boxes.    You can use these styles in any combination.
Clicking an active (checked) button turns it off.

The  display  box  under the font gadgets shows a sample of the selected
font at its current point size.

Some  fonts are CAPS only fonts, so if you are typing and all you see is
an outline, turn on the Caps Lock key and try again.

FONT TIPS
To Load and Assign Fonts from other Disks or Directories:

Make  sure  that  you  know the correct disk name or storage device name
and/or  the  full path name of the fonts location.  For example, say you
have  some  video  fonts  stored on a disk called EXTRAFONTS in a drawer
called  FORVIDEO,  then in the Drawer field of the Font Dir requester in
the Prefs menu you would type EXTRAFONTS : FORVIDEO and press the Return
key or simply choose it from the file list.  Similarly if the fonts were
stored on a hard drive partition called dh0 in a subdrawer called FONTS1
under  a  drawer called PAINT then you would select or type dh0 : PAINT/
FONTS  T  to access them.  Note that changing the font directory affects
your system globally not just in Deluxe Paint.

If  you  have  a hard drive and keep your fonts in several drawers or in
drawers  a  couple  of  levels deep, you may want to add assigns to your
existing  FONTS:  assign  so  that  you  can access your font collection
quickly in the Font requester.  Please consult your Amiga owners manu al
or  Amiga  DOS  manual  to  learn how to properly use the Assign command
before  you  experiment with this.  Following is an example of an Assign
you  can  use  to access the two Colourfonts included on the Media disk.
The assign to access the fonts would be:
 
ASSIGN FONTS: dh0:DpaintV/Karafonts Add
 
After  this  Assign  has  been executed, the Karafonts subdirectory auto
matically  is added to your existing FONTS: Assign.  When you reopen the
Choose  Font  requester  the new fonts are listed.  (If they aren't list
ed, choose Rescan Disk from the Choose Font requester's Control menu).

This  example can be used widely for other font drawers as well.  In the
LOAD  and  SAVE  requesters throughout the program.  Assigns can also be
quite  useful for saving and loading Pictures, Brushes, AnimBrushes, and
Animations to long path names.
 
Please  note that not all font sets have complete attributes, some fonts
may  not  be  able  to be Italicised or Underlined; most fonts should be
able to be set to Bold.
 
Deluxe  Paint  V  is  compatible with most Standard Amiga fonts, and can
also  load  Colour  Fonts of up to 16 colours.  Your Amiga dealer, local
Amiga  Users  Group,  or Amiga magazines are good sources for obtain ing
Public  Domain  fonts or for Purchasing additional commercial fonts like
the KaraFonts included with Deluxe Paint V.
 
Grid

Keyboard Equivalents: g - grid on/off.  G - grid on and use brush handle
location as a grid point; mnemonic - grid

The  Grid  constrains some of the painting tools so that they paint only
on  the coordinates of a grid.  If you press G to turn the grid on while
using  a  brush,  the grid will use the current brush handle position as
one of its grid points.
 
The tools affected by the grid are:
 
Dotted Freehand 
Straight Line
Rectangle
Circle 
Ellipse 
Brush Selector
Text

Right  clicking the Grid icon displays the Gridding requester.  Use this
requester to adjust the x and y spacing of the grid.

You  can  specify  the  grid values in pixels by deleting or backspacing
over  the existing values and typing in the new ones.  Alternatively you
can  click  Adjust,  which  lets  you visually place and adjust the grid
cursor  on  the work area.  The upper left corner of the adjustable grid
is  anchored  as  you  drag  the  lower right corner.  Release the mouse
button to complete the adjustment.

Right  clicking the Grid tool while you are in Perspective mode displays
the  Perspective Settings requester.  See Perspective>Settings under the
Effect menu.

Symmetry

Keyboard Equivalent: /

The  Symmetry tool helps you print symmetrical patterns around a central
point or based on a tiling scheme.  Symmetry works with all tools except
Text and Brush Selector.

Right-clicking  the  Symmetry tool displays the Symmetry requester.  Use
this requester to choose between the two symmetry modes (Point and Tile)
and to set parameters for each of the modes.

Point Symmetry
Works  around  a  central  symmetry point in either Mirror (mirror image
duplication  of  each  point)  or  Cyclic  (direct  duplication  at each
symmetry  point) In Point Symmetry you can select the number of symmetry
points  by  using  the Order edit box.  You can also set the location of
the  symmetry  centre by clicking Place and then the point on the screen
where you want the centre of symmetry to be.

Place
Lets  you  position  the  central point of your symmetrical pattern.  To
reposi tion the central point, click Place, move the large cross-hair to
the  new  loca  tion, and click.  Subsequent symmetrical drawing will be
centred on the new location.

Tile Symmetry
Creates  "tile"  patterns.    You  can  set  the horizontal and vertical
dimensions  (in  pixels)  of the tile in the width and height edit boxes
(Tile  Symmetry  requester  only).    Tile  is  useful  in creating fill
patterns  once  you've created your symmetrical pattern, set the Grid to
the  same  spacing  as the tiles to pick up exactly one tile as a brush.
Tile  lets  you  create  an  entire  pattern  just by drawing one of its
elements, and is an ideal tool for textile designers.

Because  Tile  Symmetry gives immediate feedback as you draw it replaces
the  picture  beneath  each  of  the  tiles  in the symmetry.  This will
effectively destroy any picture that was on the screen before you turned
on Tile Symmetry.
 
If  you  want  to  use  Tile Symmetry to paint over an existing picture,
choose  Background>Fix  from  the  Effect  menu  before you turn on Tile
Symmetry.   This will protect your existing picture from any inadvertent
alteration.

Magnify

Keyboard Equivalent: m - mnemonic - magnify 

The  Magnify  tool  divides  the  screen into two parts and displays the
right  hand  side  in magnification.  This tool is especially useful for
detail  work.   When you are in Magnify mode, you can use any other tool
on either side of the screen.

Select  the Magnify tool.  Position the Magnify box over the part of the
image you want to enlarge and click with either button.

This  divides the screen into two parts, with the right part magnified. 
You  can  scroll  the magnification window using the arrow keys or the n
key, which centres the area under the cursor.

To  change  the  magnification  scale  click  the  Zoom icon (beside the
Magnify  tool).    Clicking  Zoom  enlarges  the  magnified  area: right
clicking shrinks it.

You  can  set  the  Zoom level before you magnify an area.  Changing the
Zoom  setting will change the size of the rectangle attached to your cur
sor when you are in the process of magnifying an area.

To return to normal display mode, click the Magnify tool again.
 
The  Magnify  tool  is especially useful for detailed work.  You can use
any other tool on either side of the screen in Magnify mode.

Drag  the pointer down to one of the menu options, and release the mouse
button to select that option.
 
In  a  file requester, press F1 to toggle the Options panel on/off.  The
Options  panel  provides information about the selected file and in some
cases, file loading or saving options.
 
File requesters have a Control menu that is available when the requester
is open.  The Control menu options are:

Last  Name  and  Next  Name  move  up  and down through the file list.  
Restore  recalls  the  list and text gadget contents that were displayed
when the requester was opened.  The Parent, Volumes, OK, and Cancel menu
items work just like the corresponding gadgets in the requester.
 
Delete  deletes  the  file  currently  selected  in  the  requester.   A
requester  appears,  requiring  confirmation before the file is actually
deleted.    Select  OK  to  delete  the  file or Cancel to return to the
requester without deleting the file.

Some  menu  options  have  submenus  indicated  by  to the right of the
option.    You  can drag the highlight down to the option to display the
sub  menu, then drag the highlight to the right and down again to select
an option from the submenu.

When  we reference a submenu option in this manual, we use the following
convention: "Choose menu option>submenu option from the X menu " So, for
example,  "choose  Spare>Swap  from the Picture menu - means display the
Picture menu and highlight Spare".  This exposes the Spare submenu, From
the submenu highlight Swap and release the mouse button to activate your
command.

In  many  cases,  you  can  select  a  menu  item  by using its keyboard
equivalent  A table of keyboard equivalents is included as Appendix B at
the back of this manual.

TIP
One  keyboard  equivalent  deserves  special mention: a, the "Again" key
invokes your last menu command, whatever it may have been.

The  menus  are  discussed in the order they are displayed, reading from
left to right across the Menu Bar.

Picture Menu

The  Picture  menu lets you save, load, and print your pictures, as well
as  allowing  you  to make various global changes to the colour palette,
screen resolution, and page format.

Keyboard Equivalent: Right-Amiga-l

The Load... command displays the standard Amiga file requester.

Clicking  the  Volumes gadget displays a list of available floppy disks,
hard  disk  partitions, and assigned directories.  Click on drawer names
to  list their contents.  The file size, date, and time are displayed to
the  right  of  each  file  name.  Use the sizing gadget to increase the
window size if the window isn't wide enough to display this information.

Clicking the Parent action button moves you into the parent directory in
which the current subdirectory resides.  This may or may not be the root
directory.    If you click a drawer [subdirectory] name you will see all
the files in that subdirectory.

If  you swap disks while this requester is displayed, Deluxe Paint reads
the  new  disk's  directory  but does not display it until you click the
Volumes but ton.

If  there  are  more  items  in  the directory than there is room in the
window,  you  can  scroll through the window by clicking the up and down
arrow keys, or by dragging the scroll box up and down.

Note  that  devices, volumes, and directories are shown in the requester
in white type, while files are shown in black type.

Assigns  are denoted as Assign in the file window and are shown in white
type.   Assigns are beneficial to users with large storage devices, such
as  hard  disks,  removable  media,  etc.   You can create assigns to go
directly  into  deep  levels  of  subdirectories.    By  using an assign
command,  you can avoid having to move through multiple drawer levels to
find an image file.  Please consult your Amiga owners manual or an Amiga
DOS manual for more informa tion regarding this feature.

Pattern Edit Field
When  used  with the proper pattern matching parameters, this field lets
you  selectively  view  the  files  you want.  You may have noticed that
there  are  two types of character extension patterns that were used for
files  in  the  Picture drawer of the Examples disk, filename.LoRes, and
filename.Ham  for  example,  if you only wanted to look at the filenames
that  end  with .LoRes, you would type #?,LoRes.  Your file window would
show you only the files that end in .LoRes.  A good practical example of
how  this  could be used is for the loading of a sequence of pictures as
an  animation.   If your sequence of Pictures were numbered sequentially
or  alphabetically  and  started  with  the  word Space and ended a .Ham
extension  then  you type Space#?.Ham in the Pattern edit field and only
those  files  would  be  viewable.   Select the first file, set the # of
frames  (see  below  for  a more complete explanation of the # of frames
edit  box),  click  on  load,  and  your  animation will be put together
automatically for you.

The recognised pattern parameters for this edit field are:

?            Matches single characters
#<pattern>   Matches occurrences of <pattern>.
^<pattern>   Matches only occurances of <pattern> at the beginning of the 
             line. 
~<pattern>   Filters out all entries that contain <pattern>, 

Examples: 

#?                  Shows all files
#?A#?               Shows all files whose name contains the letter A
AN#?                Shows all files that begin with letters AN and end 
                    with a period followed by a 3 character extension.
#?.ANIM             Shows all files that end with an ANIM extension.
^NTSC               Shows only files that start with NTSC.
~NTSC#?HALFBRITE    Filters out all NTSC and DBLNTSC Halfbrite modes.

Control menu
The  Load  Picture  file  requester has a Control menu with eight items.
Last  Name and Next Name move up and down through the file list, Restore
recalls  the  list and text gadget contents that were displayed when the
requester  was  opened.   The Parent, Volumes, OK, and Cancel menu items
work just like the corresponding gadgets in the requester.

Delete  deletes  the  file  currently  selected  in  the  requester.   A
requester  appears,  requiring  confirmation before the file is actually
deleted.    Select  OK  to  delete  the  file or Cancel to return to the
requester without deleting the file.

Loading a File
Click  the  file  you want to load, and then click the OK button to load
the  selected file.  Or if you prefer you can simply double-click on the
filename  to  load  the  file.  Pictures load with all their attributes:
palettes,  stencils,  and per spective information.  Click Cancel if you
don't want to load a file.

When  you  load  a  picture,  the  loaded  picture replaces any existing
picture.    If you have multiple frames, the loaded picture replaces the
current  frame,  and  is  remapped  to  the Anim frame's palette.  A new
palette isn't automatically loaded.

Load Picture Options panel
The Options panel displays attributes of the selected file, and lets you
load multiple images as an animation.

Bytes:            File size in bytes
Screen/Page Size: Screen/Page dimensions in pixels
Colours:          Number of colours in the file
Name:             Name of the file or Name chunk if available
Author:           Author name (if available)
(c):              Copyright information (if available)

Load  #  of frames: Check this box to load multiple pictures at one time
as  frames  of  an  animation.  To select multiple files, Shift click on
files  that  you  wish to be placed in the animation.  The pictures must
all  be  in  the same format, and the files are loaded in the order that
they're  listed,  not  necessari ly the order that they're selected.  To
create multiple frames from a single pic ture, select one file and enter
a  number  in  the  text  gadget  to  set  the  number of frames for the
resulting animation.  If you already have animation frames, those frames
are discarded and Deluxe Paint creates new frames as you load.

If you want to add pictures to your animation without discarding it, you
must load the pictures one at a time.  Deluxe Paint loads a single image
in your current frame.

Deluxe  Paint  loads the pictures starting with the picture you selected
in  the  requester  and  continuing  down  the listing shown to load the
number  of  frames you requested.  If any of the files in the list is an
animation,  Deluxe  Paint  loads the first frame of that animation as an
animation  frame  in  the  new animation.  The newly assembled animation
uses  the palette of the picture loaded, and adds additional palettes as
needed.

Save

Keyboard Equivalent: Right-Amiga-s

Displays the Save Picture ASL file requester.  This requester works like
the Load Picture requester, except that it saves the file to disk rather
than load ing it.

To save a picture from the requester, click on the disk name you want to
save  to.    Click  on the subdirectory you want to save your picture in
(Both  the  disk  drive  and directory you selected appear in the Drawer
edit  box,  for  example  DF0:Examples).  Click in the File edit box and
type a name for your picture.  Finally click OK to save the file.

You can save in a particular subdirectory by clicking in the Drawer edit
box and typing in the subdirectory name, or by clicking the subdirectory
name directly from the file names displayed in the window.

When you type in either the Drawer or File edit boxes, you can erase the
existing  type  by  clicking  at  the  end  of  the  existing  name  and
backspacing  or  by  clicking at the beginning of the name and Deleting.
You  can move over the text without deleting it by using the arrow keys.

Tip 
Typing Right Amiga X deletes the current line of text.

You can save a picture under an existing file name by clicking that file
name  in  the  file  listing  or you can enter a new file name (up to 29
characters  long)  by  clicking  the  File edit box and typing the name.
Whenever  you  save  a  picture  under  an  existing  name, Deluxe Paint
displays  a  requester for you to confirm that you want to overwrite the
existing file.

Pictures  are  saved  and  reloaded  with  all their attribures, such as
palettes,  stencils and perspective information, 24 bit pictures are not
saved  with  any  palette  information.    See the Appendix E: The 24Bit
Backing Store for more information.

Save Picture Options panel 
Press F1 to toggle the Options panel on/off.

Name:  Enter  the  name of the picture image in this text box (this name
can be different from the filename if you wish).

Author: Enter the name of the author of the image here.

(c): Enter copyright information in this text box.

Frames:  Specify a frame range to save, if applicable when you save more
than  one frame, each frame is saved as a separate picture, and a number
is  appended to the end of the filename.  For example, if you enter 5 to
10  as the frames you want to save, frames 5-10 are saved as Filename005
through Filename010.

Control menu
The  Load  Picture  file  requester has a Control menu with eight items.
Last  Name and Next Name move up and down through the file list, Restore
recalls  the  list and text gadget contents that were displaycd when the
requester  was  opened.   The Parent, Volumes, OK, and Cancel menu items
work  just  like  the  corresponding gadgets in the requester.  Keyboard
short Cuts for the options are listed in the menu.

Delete  deletes  the  file  currently  selected  in  the  requester.   A
requester  appears,  requiring  confirmation before the file is actually
deleted.    Select  OK  to  delete  the  file  or  Cancel to turn to the
requester without deleting the file.

The Pattern edit box and Volumes gadget work just as in the Load Picture
requester (see Load, above)

Delete

Keyboard Equivalent: Right-Amiga - d

Displays ASL Delete File requester which lets you delete a file from the
disk without leaving the program.  This is especially useful if you find
that your data disk is full and you need to delete a file before you can
save  your  work  The Delete File requester works just like the Load and
Save  requesters described above.  You can enter a file name by clicking
that  name  in  the requester window or by typing the name directly into
the File edit box.

You can use this option to delete any kind of file on the disk, not just
pictures.  Thus, you can delete brushes, animations, etc.

Print

Keyboard Equivalent: Right-Amiga - p

Displays  the  Print  Picture  requester.    Before you start to print a
picture,  make  sure  you  have selected the correct printer driver from
Preferences, and that your printer is connected and turned on.  See your
Amiga Users Guide for information on Printer Preferences.

The Print Picture requester provides the following options:

Frame  Range:  Click All to print all the frames (if applicable), or use
the  From  and  To text boxes to select a range of frames to be printed.
This option is only available if an animation is loaded.

AnimBoards:  This cycle gadget can be used to print multiple frame anima
tions on a single page by selecting 1Up, 2Up, 4Up, 6Up, 9Up, or 16Up sto
ryboards.    Note  that  4,  9,  and  16Up AnimBoards preserve the tiled
picture  aspect  ratios  best.    This  option is only available when an
animation is loaded.

Copies: Specifies how many copies of the picture you want printed.

Shade: Cycle between B & W, Grey, or Colour to specify whether the print
out will be in black and white, shades of grey or colour.  Make sure the
set  ting  is  appropriate  for your printer.  If you are using a single
colour  ribbon,  click  B  &  W.   If you want to translate your image's
colours  into shades of grey use the Grey setting.  If you have a colour
printer and wish to print in full colour, click Colour.

Density: Use the slider to set the print density.

Image:  Specifies  whether  the  printout will be a positive or negative
image, Click to cycle between Positive and Negative.

FF: Lets you set whether or not you want the printer to move to the next
sheet of paper before printing each image.  This lets you easily print a
single picture per sheet of paper.

Placement:  Specifies  whether the picture should be printed against the
left margin of the page or centred on the page.

LF:  Specifies  the  number  of  line  feeds  you want to insert after a
picture  is  printed.  This way you can easily print two pictures on the
same page with a specified amount of space in between the pictures.

Aspect:  Specifies  the  orientation of the picture on the paper, either
Portrait,  the  default,  or Landscape.  Click to cycle between Portrait
and Landscape.

Scale:  Cycle between Dots Wide or Percent.  When Dots Wide is selected,
use  the  Wide  and High text boxes to enter the height and width of the
printout  in printer pixels.  Values of 0 for width or height will cause
the  aspect  ratio limitations to be ignored and the printout will be as
large  as the margins will allow.  When Percent is selected, you can use
the  Wide  and  High  text  boxes to set the aspect ratio for height and
width.

You  can use the Percent feature to compensate for elongated squares and
cir  cles  that result when you change screen formats.  If you just want
to  shrink  the  picture while maintaining the same aspect ratio, change
the  Wide  value and leave the High value at 0.  To change either value,
click  the  appropriate  gadget,  Backspace  or Delete over the existing
value, and type in the new one.

Cancel  if don't want to print and don't want to save any new settings. 
Click Exit if you don't want to print, but want to save your settings to
print  later Click Print to print the currenusing a
backing store to enable 24-bit colour.

Retain  Picture: Click this checkbox to retain the current picture (this
is on by default).

Display  Information:  This  box  displays  information for the selected
display mode.

this box.  Use the scroll bar to scroll up and down through the listing.


Menus

Right  click  the  Menu  Bar to reveal the four menus available when the
Screen  Format  requester  is  displayed.    Menu shortcture  about  its  X or Y axis.  If you have
multiple  frames,  you  can  flip  one  frame, a range of frames, or all
frames  of  your animation The submenu offers two ways to flip an image,
horizontally or vertically.

Horiz
Flips the current picture about the horizontal or X axis.

Vert
Flips the current picture about the vertical or Y axis.

Spare >>
The Spare option presents a submenu with options for manipulating Deluxe
Paint's  spare  page.    Note that the spare page now has its own unique
colour palette.

Swap

Keyboard Equivalent: j

Conceals  the  current page and displays a second or "spare" page.  This
means  you  have two pages to work on.  The concealed page is always the
spare page.

When  you  first  select the spare page, it is the same size as the main
page.    If you wish to use a larger page size on the spare page, you'll
need  to  make  the appropriate selection from the Page Size option (see
below).  Note, however, that you can increase the size of a page only if
you  have sufficient memory available.  Note also that a spare page uses
up memory even if there is noth ing on it.

Copy to Spare

Keyboard Equivalent: Ctrl-j

Copies  the picture and palette on the current page to the spare page so
you  can  experiment with your picture on the spare page without fear of
losing anything.  If you do not have sufficient memory for a spare page,
save  the  image to disk if you wish to experiment with it.  If you copy
to the spare from a page that is larger than the spare, only the visible
portion  of  the page is copied.  If you copy to a spare which is larger
than  the  screen,  a  copy  is made to the spare at the location in the
spare that was visible when you last viewed it.

Merge in Front

Merges the spare page in front of the current page.  When the spare page
is  brought  forward,  all pixels matching its current background colour
will  appear  transparent,  allowing  images on the current page to show
through  You  must  be  viewing  the  page you want to merge to when you
choose this option.

Merge in Back

Merges  the spare page in back of the current page.  When the spare page
is put behind the current one, all pixels which match the current page's
back ground colour will appear transparent, allowing images on the spare
page to show through.  You must be viewing the page you want to merge to
when you choose this option.

Delete this Page

If  you  no  longer  wish  to have memory allocated for a second "spare"
page,  use  this  option  to  delete the current page (the one currently
showing  on  the  screen) and to deallocate the memory set aside for it.
Be  sure  you  have  saved a copy of the picture you are deleting if you
think  you  may need it later.  When you select Delete this Page, Deluxe
Paint  asks  you  to  confirm the deletion, and then switches you to the
other page.

Page Size

Displays  the Set Page Size requester.  Select the page size (in pixels)
you  wish  to  work on.  Screen is the normal Amiga display size for the
selected resolu tion.

Full  Page  gives  you  a  full  page image (8 1/2 by 11 inches) on most
printers,  Overscan presents a full-screen display which lets you create
pictures  that  fill  the entire screen.  This is particularly useful if
you  wish to videotape your images.  In order to paint on the edges of a
full  video screen, you need to scroll the image around using the cursor
keys  or  the  n  key  unless you set the screen format to Overscan (see
Screen  Format, below).  Alternatively you can view the entire screen by
selecting Show Page, below.

Clicking  one  of the first three settings automatically sets the height
and  width  in  the  corresponding edit hoxes.  You can also type in any
other  size  you  wish  by  selecting  Custom  and  then  clicking   the
appropriate edit field, Backspacing or Deleting over the existing value,
and  typing  in the new size.  Although Deluxe Paint will recognise page
sizes up to 1008 x 1024, you may need to reduce the number of colours in
your palette to create a picture this large.

Show Page

Keyboard Equivalent: S

Hides  the  Toolbox  and  Title Bar and displays the entire document, if
neces  sary in a reduced format.  For example, in 640 x 400 page size in
Lo  Res,  it  shows  only  every  other pixel.  If the page is oversized
(larger than the screen), you can move the rectangle to view a different
area  of  the screen by holding down the left mouse button: dragging the
rectangle  to the area you want to view: and releasing the mouse button.
You  are  returned to the current page with the area of the rectangle in
view.    Pressing  any  key  returns  you  to  the  current page without
repositioning the view.

For  more  exact  positioning  of the rectangle you can move it with the
arrow  keys.   The arrow keys move the rectangle one unit at a time.  (A
unit  is  the  page  size dimension divided by the screen size.  So with
320x200  screen  for mat with 640x400 page, the rectangle moves 2 pixels
at  a time).  Holding down the Alt key and pressing the arrow keys moves
the rectangle in screen size increments.

Screen Format 

Displays  the  Screen Format requester.  The items in this requester are
arranged  a  little  differently  than  in Deluxe Paint IV, and some new
options  have been added.  Be sure to save a copy of your current screen
before  changing screen formats because once you have reduced the number
of  colours, the original colour information is lost.  In addition, note
that  changing  formats  eliminates most items from memory including the
Font Directory.

Choose  Display  Mode:  Click  on  one of the available display modes to
select  that  mode.  The display modes that appear are dependent on what
is  in  your  Monitors  drawer  at  boot  up.   Deluxe Paint reads which
monitors you have available for use and automatically makes their screen
modes available in the Screen Format requester.  Note: Your monitor must
be  capable  of  displaying  the modes you have in your Monitors drawer.
For example, a 1084 monitor isn't capable of displaying Multiscan modes.

In 640x200 modes pixels are tall and narrow compared to other screen for
mats.    This  means if you switch from a 320x200 mode to a 640x200 mode
such  as  NTSC:Hires, objects will become flattened or elongated because
of  the different pixel shape.  You can compensate for this by using the
Double Horiz and Double Vert options from the Brush menu (see below).

Screen Size: Click the button to cycle through the available sizes.  The
Custom  option allows you to choose the size of the screen using the two
text  boxes (width, height).  The maximum height and width of the screen
is listed in the Max Size parameter in the Display Information window.
 
Page  Size:  Select Screen to make the page size the same as the current
screen  size  dimensions.    Select Keep Same to retain the current page
size  for  new documents.  If the current Page size is too small for the
current  screen dimensions, it is increased, but won't affect the image.

Example #1: Screen - If you start in 320 x 200 screen format and move to
640  x 400 format, your image will fill only one quarter of the screen. 
If  you  go  from 640 x 400 to 320 x 200, you will only retain the upper
left quarter of your image.

Example #2: Keep Same - If you start in 640 x 400 format and move to 320
x  200  format,  you  will  retain the entire image but you will need to
scroll the screen to see all of it.

Palette  Size:  This  slider  defaults  to  the  maximum colours for the
selected display mode, but can be set to a lower number if desired.

Backing  Store:  Cycle  between None (default) or 24-bit RGB for using a
backing store to enable 24-bit colour.

Retain  Picture: Click this checkbox to retain the current picture (this
is on by default).

Display  Information:  This  box  displays  information for the selected
display mode.

Credits:  A  listing of the people who created Deluxe Paint V appears in
this box.  Use the scroll bar to scroll up and down through the listing.


Menus

Right  click  the  Menu  Bar to reveal the four menus available when the
Screen  Format  requester  is  displayed.    Menu shortcuts for the menu
options are listed in each menu.

Control:  The Control menu provides another way to move through the list
of  display modes, as well as Use the selected mode or Cancel out of the
requester.    FirstMode  and  LastMode select the first and last display
modes  in  the list respectively.  NextMode and PrevMode select the next
or  previous display modes.  Use and Cancel work like the Use and Cancel
buttons in the requester.

Edit:  Reset  To  Defaults  restores  the  system  default display mode.
Restore  Last  Saved  restores the display mode last saved as a tooltype
Save Settings saves the current display mode as a tooltype.  The Default
Pattern    item  allows  you  to  Use or Define the default pattern for
listing display modes The Deluxe Paint default pattern is '#?' (show all
files), but you can Define any pattern you like to constrain the listing
to your desired parameters.

Monitors:  This  menu lets you constrain the display mode listing to ALL
monitor  types  or a specific monitor type (DOUBLENTSC, MULTISCAN, NTSC,
or SUPEG72).

Settings:  The  Display  Names  item lets you view the display modes by
standard  Monitor  name  or  by Mode ID.  The History >> item displays a
list of the last ten patterns you've entered, so you can use the menu to
select a pattern you've set previously rather than typing in the pattern
again.    The  patterns  are  maintained in memory only for your current
Deluxe Paint ses sion: they are not saved when you exit the program.

HAM
The  Hold  and  Modify display mode (HAM) uses either 64 colours for the
262,000+  AGA colours or 16 colour registers to display 4,096 colours on
the  screen  at the same time.  A HAM colour is formed by taking the RGB
value of the preceding pixel on the screen, and substituting a new value
for one of the RGB components. 

Because  HAM  colours are based on colour values of the preceding pixel,
and  only  one  colour value can be changed at a time, it may take three
pixels  to  reach the colour you really wanted.  In Figure 8.25 it takes
three  pixels  to  change  black  (R0, G0, B0) to white (R15, G15, B15).
Note  that  this example assumes there are no intermediate colour in the
normal  colour  registers.  This gradual change from one colour the next
is sometimes referred to as "ramping" the colour, and appe on the screen
to  the  left  of  HAM pixels.  If you need fine details in picture, you
will  want  to  use  a  colour from one of the sixteen colour registers,
because those colours do not require ramping.

When  you paint with a brush over an area made up of HAM pixels, you may
see  streaks of colour running to the right from the edge of the brush. 
This  is a temporary effect called "fringing".  When you paint the brush
onto  the  picture,  Deluxe Paint corrects the fringing, but you may see
the  "ramp ing" effect where the program recreates the HAM colour to the
right of your brush.

In  HAM  mode  there is a selector button displayed under the palette on
screen.    Click on the arrows to move through the 16 sets (A through P)
of  colours  available  in your total colour set.  The "a" group is your
palette  or  base register colours; the other colours in the set are HAM
colours.

Overscan
The  system  Overscan  preferences  are  used  by default.  Std puts the
screen  into  standard  Overscan mode allowing you to view and edit your
image in the border area around the normal viewable screen area.  Notice
that  the  dimensions  of  all  four  screen formats get larger.  If the
Toolbox  or  Title  Bar  are  showing when you choose Overscan mode, the
screen  is  Shifted  down  and  to the left to make sure you can see the
controls.

At  Max setting the viewing area gets even larger.  The new vertical and
hori zontal dimensions of the screen appear beside the screen formats.

If  you  need  to  adjust  the position of your screen, you can do so by
holding down Ctrl and using the cursor keys.  This saves you the trouble
of exiting the program to adjust your screen through Preferences.

About

Keyboard Equivalent: ?

The  About  requester  shows  the  program  version number, the authors'
names,  the  copyright  notice,  and  information  about  the  amount of
available  memory  and  the size of your brush, animation, or AnimBrush,
and the number of palettes currently being used.

Quit

Keyboard Equivalent: Right-Amiga - q

Exits Deluxe Paint

Brush Menu

Load

Keyboard Equivalent: Right - Amiga - b

Displays the Load Brush requester.  This is identical in function to the
Load  Picture requester, except that you are loading brushes rather than
pictures.   When you load a brush that has a palette different from that
of  the  current  picture,  the  picture   palette   remains   in place.
Nonetheless,  the  brush  palette  information  is loaded along with the
brush:  you  can  change  to the brush's palette at any time by choosing
Palette>Use  Brush  Palette from the Colour menu.  If you wish to revert
to the previous palette, use Palette>Restore Palette option.

The  Load  With  Palette  option  in  the Load Brush Options window auto
matically uses the brush's palette.
 
Save 

Displays  the  Save  Brush  requester.    This requester is identical in
function  to  the  Save  Picture requester (see Save in the Picture Menu
above).    Brushes  are saved with their palettes, which includes ranges
and colour cycling informa tion.

The Save with Mask option in the Save Brush Options window allows you to
choose  whether you want to save the brush with its transparency or not.


Copy

Keyboard Equivalent: Right - Amiga - c

Copy  the  current  brush to the system clipboard.  You must have a user
defined  brush selected for this command to work.  This is a good way to
transfer bitmaps from one program to another.

Paste

Keyboard Equivalent: Right - Amiga - V

Paste the current contents of the system clipboard to a brush.

Restore

Keyboard Equivalent: B

Restores  as  the  current  brush  the custom brush you last used, after
you've  used  an  AnimBrush,  a  built-in brush, or modified your custom
brush  with an option from the Brush menu.  Restore does not reverse the
effect  of  all  brush  manipulations  in the Brush menu.  Generally the
options that cannot be reversed with Restore can be reversed by choosing
the  option again.  For example, Restore does not reverse the Flip>Horiz
option,  but  choosing  Flip>Horiz  again (with no intervening commands)
returns your brush to its previous state.

It's  a  good  idea  to  save your custom brush, or stamp it down on the
spare  page  if  you want to do a lot of experimenting.  This way you'll
have your original brush to go back to.

Spare >>

The  Spare options submenu has options for using and manipulating Deluxe
Paint's spare brush.

Brush->Spare

Keyboard Equivalent: Alt-n

Moves  the current brush to the spare brush position (which is hidden). 
If  your  current brush is an AnimBrush, the current cel of the brush is
copied to the spare brush position.

Brush <-> Spare

Keyboard Equivalent: Alt-b

Swaps the current brush and the spare brush positions.

Morph -> Spare

Keyboard Equivalent: Alt-m

Lets you create a special AnimBrush that metamorphoses between the shape
and  colours of the current brush and the shape and colours of the spare
brush.    To  use  this option, you must first have a custom brush and a
"spare" custom brush.

When  you  choose  Metamorph, the Make AnimBrush requester appears Enter
the  number of cels you want in the AnimBrush.  Enter a number and click
OK.  Deluxe Paint creates the AnimBrush automatically.

For  best results, your custom brush and spare brush should be picked up
with the same dimensions.  This does not mean that the brush images must
be  the same size; but the area that you surrounded to pick up the brush
images should be the same size.

The  resulting  first  and  last  cels of the AnimBrush generally do not
contain  exactly the same images as your original custom brush and spare
brush.   Usually you will see some change in the colours of the first or
last frames.

See  the metamorphosis exercise in Chapter 7: Animation Effects for more
information.

Size >>

The Size option lets you resize the current brush.  The submenu presents
the following options.

Stretch or Shrink
Keyboard Equivalent: Z
Lets you freely stretch the current custom brush in any direction to any
size.    To  stretch  the  brush,  drag  it to the desired size.  Select
Restore from the Brush menu to negate the effect of the stretch.

Holding down the Shift key constrains the stretch operation so that your
brush maintains the same aspect ratio (relative width and height).

Stretching  a  brush uses a lot of memory; if you try to stretch a brush
to  a  size  bigger than the available memory can accommodate, the brush
will snap back to its original size.

Halve
Keyboard Equivalent: h
Reduces  the  size of your brush by 50% in vertical and horizontal dimen
sions.  For instance, a 20 X 20 brush is resized to 10 X 10.

Double
Keyboard Equivalent: H
Doubles  the size of your brush in both dimensions, for a quadrupling of
the total area.  For instance, a 20 X 20 brush is resized to 40 X 40.

Double Horiz
Keyboard Equivalent: X
Doubles the size of your brush in the horizontal dimension.  This option
is uscful for reproportioning images that you created in Lo Res and then
moved to Med Res (see Screen Format under the Picture menu).

Double Vert
Keyboard Equivalent: Y
Doubles  the  size of your brush in the vertical dimension.  This option
is  use  ful for re-proportioning images that you created in Med Res and
then moved to Lo-Res (see Screen Format under the Picture menu).

Doubling  the  size  of  a  brush  may require more memory than you have
available.    In  that  case,  the  resized  brush may appear only as an
outline.

Flip >>

Lets  you  flip  a  brush  about  its  X  or  Y  axis.  When you Flip an
AnimBrush, all frames of the animated brush will flip.

Horiz
Keyboard Equivalent: x
Flips the current custom brush about the horizontal or X axis.

Vert
Keboard Equivalent: y
Flips the current custom brush about the vertical or Y axis.

Edge >>

Modifies a one pixel boundary around the current brush.

Outline
Keyboard Equivalent: o
Adds  a one pixel boundary around the current custom brush using the cur
rent  foreground colour.  This is ideal for outlining text.  To increase
the  thick  ness  of  the  outline,  one pixel at a time, select Outline
repeatedly.

Outlining  in  HAM  mode  with a HAM colour may supply different reults.
The boundary colour you get may be different from the fore ground colour
if one pixel is not sufficient to "ramp" to the HAM colour.

Trim 
Keyboard Equivalent: O
Deletes  a  one  pixel  boundary around the current brush.  You can trim
repeatedly.

Rotate >>

Rotate the current custom brush in any of three ways.

90 Degrees
Keyboard Equivalent; z
Rotates the current brush clockwise 90 degrees.

Any Angle
Lets you rotate the current brush any number of degrees.

Choose  Rotate>Any Angle from the Brush menu.  Hold the left button down
and  drag  the  rectangular outline about its bottom left corner Release
the button at the desired orientation.

If  you  select  this  option  more than once, your brush reverts to its
original orientation before you rotate it again.

Shear
Gives  you  controlled distortion of the current brush.  The top part of
the  brush  is  anchored,  and  you  can drag the bottom of the brush in
either direction.

Bend >>

Use this option to bend a brush horizontally or vertically.

Horiz
Lets you bend the current brush in a horizontal direction.

Choose  Bend>Horiz  from the Brush menu.  Drag the brush outline left or
right until it is the desired shape.  Release the mouse button.

The  vertical  position  of the cursor to the brush determines where the
brush bends.

Vert
Lets you bend the current brush in a vertical direction.

Choose  Bend>Vertical from the Brush menu.  Drag the brush outline up or
down until it is the desired shape.  Release the mouse button.

The  horizontal position of the cursor to the brush determines where the
brush bends.

Handle >>

Lets  you  specify  whether the cursor holds a custom brush by is centre
(the  default),  by  one  of its four corners, or by an offset position,
which  you can define.  Use the keyboard equivalent to rotate your brush
handle  when you need to move your cursor without moving the brush.  You
can move the brush handle with the mouse button down this way.

Rotate
Keyboard Equivalent: Alt-x
Rotate the arrow cursor, which represents the handle, from the centre of
the  brush  (the  default  position)  to  any of the four corners of the
brush.    Selecting  the  command  or typing Alt-x cycles from centre to
bottom right, bottom left, top left, top right, and back to centre.

Place
Keyboard Equivalent: Alt-z
Lets  you  position  the  brush  handle  at any position relative to the
brush.   To place the handle, pick up your brush.  Choose Handle>Place. 
Drag  in  any  direction  to offset the cursor from the brush.  When you
release  the  mouse  button,  the  cursor  will  hold  the  brush as you
specified.

Once you set a new brush handle.
The  location  of  the  arrow  cursor  the next time you pick up a brush
depends  on the direction you drag the mouse when you pick up the brush.
If  you  drag down and to the right, the cursor will remain at the lower
right.   If you drag up and to the left, the cursor will move to the top
left.    The same prin ciple applies if you drag down and to the left or
up  and to the right.  In other words, the corner you drag to is the one
to which the arrow cursor will attach.

Positioning the cursor on a corner is particularly useful in Perspective
mode (see the Effect Menu, below).

Solid Body
Turns  the  translucent pixels of a custom brush that are completely sur
rounded  by any non transparent colour to the solid colour.  The outside
area of the brush remains transparent.

Frame Only
Keyboard Equivalent; Alt-f - mnemonic frame
Displays  only  the bounding box of a custom brush as you move the mouse
This speeds up movement when you have a complex brush or are running low
on  memory.    When  you press the mouse button, the brush is stamped on
your page.

When  memory is very low custom brushes are displayed in frame only mode
automatically.

Free
Deletes all custom brushes from memory.

Mode Menu

The  Mode  menu  contains  different brush modes.  These modes determine
which  colour(s)  in  your  brush  are used when you paint.  Most of the
modes have keyboard equivalents, using the function keys (F-keys) on the
top row of your keyboard.

With  the  exception  of Shade, none of the modes affect the colour used
when  you  paint  with the right mouse button.  In any mode except Shade
mode  the right mouse button paints using the current back ground colour
in Colour mode.

Matte
Keyboard Equivalent F1
Uses  a  custom  brush  in its original form.  These areas of the brush,
which  match the background colour that was in effect when the brush was
first  created  are  transparent.    Matte  is the default mode when you
create a custom brush using the Brush Selector.

Colour
Keyboard Equivalent: F2
Uses  the  shape  of  the brush and fills it with the current foreground
colour  Those areas of the brush, which match the background colour that
was in effect when the brush was first created, are transparent.

Replc
Keyboard Equivalent: F3
Uses  the custom brush in its original form (ie Matte see above), except
that no colours are transparent.

Smear
Keyboard Equivalent: F4
Smears any colours on the page when you drag a brush over them.  This is
like  smearing  a  wet water colour with your fingers, so the bigger the
brush,  the  more  pronounced  the  effect.  Smear uses only the colours
under the brush, and does not add any new colours.  Current brush colour
is irrele vant.

Shade
Keyboard Equivalent: F5
Shade  helps  you create subtle shading effects on those colours in your
pic  ture  that  are-in  a  cycle  range.  Like Smear, Shade ignores the
current  brush  colour  but  uses its shape.  By dragging the brush over
those  colours  in your picture that are in the currently selected cycle
range, you can paint over each colour with the next colour in the range.
You  can  paint  with  the  next-higher  colour  by using the left mouse
button, and the next lower colour by using the right mouse button.

"Higher"  and  "lower" are relative to the colour under the brush at the
time.    Shade  has no effect on colours outside the current range.  You
select  a  range  equivalent from the Range requester, ant the Fill Type
requester, or by using the keyboard equivalent (Alt-[ and Alt-]) to step
through the ranges.

Blend
Keyboard Equivalent: F6
Like  Smear,  Blend  affects the colours under the brush by running them
together.    Unlike  Smear,  however  Blend  uses  additional  shades by
averaging the blended colours, whereas Smear uses only the colours under
the  brush.   Thus, when you Blend two shades by painting over them, you
are  selecting  a  third  shade  from  the  palette, the closest one the
program can find to the average of the two original shades.

Cycle
Keyboard Equivalent: F7
Uses  the  current brush shape and cycles through all the colours in the
cur  rently  selected  range as you draw.  A range is selected if one of
its  members  is  selected.    If  a  colour  is a member of two ranges,
selecting  it  selects  the  first of those two ranges.  If your current
brush  colour  is  not  within a cycle range, it paints with that colour
only.    Use  MultiCycle  (in the Prefs menu) to achieve the same effect
with  a  multicoloured  brush,  where  each  colour  in the brush cycles
through its range independently of the others.

Smooth
Keyboard Equivalent: F8
Softens  hard  lines  and reduces the contrast between adjoining areas. 
Deluxe  Paint  finds  colours  in  the palette between the two bordering
colours and paints the boundary in intermediate shades.  Smooth looks at
the cur rent palette and finds the colours closest to the ones under the
brush.    Thus if the palette contains a wide selection of colours close
to  the  ones  under the brush (eg the selection of greys in the default
Palette),  it will have more colours to draw from to create its weighted
averages.    Smooth  is  useful  for  creating  airbrush effects and for
eliminating jagged edges.

Mix
The colour of your brush mixes interactively with the colours already on
the screen (in your image).  This is particularly effective in HAM.

HBRITE
This  mode  is  only  available if your computer supports it, and if you
have  selected  a Halfbrite screen mode from the Screen Format option in
the  Picture  menu.  When you are in HBrite mode, painting with the left
mouse  button  darkens  colours  on  your  painting  to  their Halfbrite
equivalent;  painting  with  the  right button lightens colours that are
Halfbrite.    This mode is especially useful in pictures with shadow and
highlight effects.

The  Amiga supports only 32 colour registers directly but Halfbrite uses
a  trick  to  double the number of colours available on the screen.  The
first  32  registers  are  standard  colour registers; the second 32 are
Halfbrite  equiva  lents  of the original 32.  Pixels that use Halfbrite
colours  point to one of the standard colour registers and indicate that
the colour should be displayed at half its normal intensity.  This means
that  the second 32 pixels are not inde pendent of the first 32; you can
change  the colour values only in the first 32 registers, and the change
is automatically reflected in the Halfbrite equiva lent.

Not  all  Amiga  computers support Halfbrite.  If there are no Halfbrite
screen  modes  in  your  Screen  Format  requester  your machine doesn't
support it.

Rubthru
Use  this  mode  to 'rub through' portions of the current picture to the
spare  page  -  sort  of like using a crayon and tracing paper to make a
rubbing  of  a  texture.   The current Translucency setting controls how
much of the picture is rubbed through (0% equals 100% of the image being
rubbed through).

Rubthru also works with textures, translucency and process modes

To rub through an image;

Press  j  to go to your spare page (j toggles between the spare page and
your picture).

Paint on the spare page.  Adjust the Translucency (Effects>Translucency)
slider to control the amount of the image that is rubbed through.

NOTE
If  your  spare  palette  is  different from the current palette, Deluxe
Paint will use the closest colours to do the rubthru.

Anim Menu

Load
Displays  the  Load  Anim requester.  This requester works like the Load
Picture  requester  (see Load under the Picture menu).  When you load an
ani mation, it replaces the one currently in memory.  When you append an
ani  mation,  the appended animation is added to the end of your current
anima tion.

It  is also possible to load individual pictures into the frames of your
anima  tion using the Load Picture requester.  To do so, go to the frame
you  wish to load a pictute into, display the Load Picture requester and
select  the  picture  you wish to load.  Your animation will take on the
palette  of the picture loaded unless you are editing a multiple palette
animation,  in  which  case  the  picture  you load will only affect the
palettes  of  the  frames associated with the key palette you load into.
If  you want to restore your animation's palette, choose Palette>Restore
Palette  from  the  Colour  menu.  If you want to remap the picture just
loaded to the Animations original palette, choose Remap from the colours
menu and select current frame from the requester that appears.  See Load
in the Picture menu for more information.

Press  F1  to toggle the Load Anim Options panel, which displays informa
tion  about  the  selected animation file.  There are two options in the
panel;  Show  Loading  and  Append.   When Show Loading is checked, each
frame  is shown as the animation is loaded.  When Append is checked, the
loaded file is appended to any listing animation frames.

Save
Displays  the  Save  Anim  requester,  which works like the Save Picture
requester  described under Save in the Picture menu.  The one difference
is  that  the Framnes edit boxes in the Save Anim Options requester lets
you  save  a  section of your animation as an animation rather than as a
series of pic tures as in the Save Picture requester.

Move...
Keyboard Equivalent: M
Displays  the Move requester.  Use this requester to define a path along
which  your  brush  is painted in 3D, either on a single frame, or while
stepping through an animation sequence.

To use the Move requester:

Stamp your brush on the screen at the starting position you want.

Choose Move from the Anim menu.

Click  Start,  and  then click Adjust to interactively set the beginning
position and size of the brush.

Click and drag the bounding box to set the position of the brush.

Ctrl-click and drag up/down to set the size (Z axis) of the brush.

Press  Enter  to  accept the current position of the brush and return to
the Move requester.

Click  End,  and  then click Adjust to interactively set the ending posi
tion  and  size  of  the  brush.    Press  Enter to return to the Move -
requester when the brush is properly positioned.

Set  the Count edit field to the number of frames over which you want to
animate the brush.

Select any other settings that apply to your animation.

Click Draw to paint the animation with the settings you specified.

Dist:  The  Dist edit boxes let you specify the total distance in pixels
that the brush will move along the X, Y and Z axes in your animation.

You  can set the brush to move along the brush axes (tick) or the screen
axes  (no  tick) by clicking the Brush action button to the right of the
Dist edit boxes.

Angle: The Angle edit boxes let you specify the total angle, in degrees,
that the brush will be rotated about the X, Y and Z axes.

You  can  set  the  brush  to rotate around the brush axes (tick) of the
screen  axes  (no tick) by clicking the Brush action button to the right
of  the Angle edit boxes.  Brush axes are active by default, which means
the rotation is always based on the brush coordinate system.

The  brush  coordinate system will change during the course of a Move if
you are rotating on more than one axis.

If  the  Brush action button is unchecked any angle rotation takes place
along  the  current  axes of the screen coordinate system.  The "screen"
rotation sys tem is an Euler (pronounced oiler) system, and the order of
rotation  is always X, Y and Z.  When you rotate on more than one angle,
or  when the brush has been rotated previously the rotations produced by
the screen angle system are not always around the axes that are used for
the  Distance  moves  along  the  screen axes.  Generally it's better to
think of the screen angle rotations as "non-brush" rather than screen.

All  rotations occur around the brush handle.  If you want your brush to
appear  as though it is orbiting around a point away from the brush, you
would want to offset the handle from the brush.

Brush:  Click  these  action  buttons  to toggle a tick on and off.  The
options  select whether the Dist and Angle movements are relative to the
coordinate  system  (tick  =  on)  or  relative to the screen coordinate
system (no tick = off).

Zero: Click to zero out all of the Move and Angle numbers.

Go  Back:  Click  to  restore the brush's sitting position (for the next
move ment) to the last place you manually clicked it down.

Cyclic: Click this button to turn it on (tick), if you are creating that
is cyclic (that is one that starts and ends at the same position).

For  example,  if you have 10 frames, and you want a brush to rotate 360
degrees over the 10 frames to make it look as though it is spinning when
you  play the animation, you would turn Cyclic on.  Deluxe Paint V would
calculate  the  rotation  to  end  on the 11th frame (which in this case
would be the 1st frame).  The result is that the brush is not rotated to
a  full 360 degrees on Frame 10.  Instead, the brush reaches 360 degrees
on  Frame  1,  Deluxe  Paint  doesn't print the brush on the last frame,
since  its  position  would normally be the same as your original frame,
but  it  does move for ward to that frame and positions the brush in the
event that you want to click it down.

Slow  In:  Set the number of frames over which you want the brush motion
to gradually decelerate.

Slow  Out: Set the number of frames over which you want the brush motion
to gradually accelerate.

Count:  Set  the  number  of  times the brush is printed to complete the
total  movement  and  rotation  as  specified by the Dist and angle edit
boxes.

Move: The Move action buttons control the direction of your move and the
order  in  which the frames of the animation are printed.  There are two
choices:

Go  From  starts  the  movement  of  the  brush from the point where you
stamped your brush (indicated by the large dot) and prints forward.

Come To starts the animation at an earlier frame and moves the brush for
ward to the point where you stamped your brush.

Record  lets you choose the order in which the frames of the brush moves
are printed.  These buttons are available only if you have more than one
anima tion frame.

Forward  paints  the  move  by stepping forward from the point where you
stamped  your  brush.   This is the default setting and the one you will
use most often.

In Place paints all of the move on the current frame.

Backward paints the move in reverse order by advancing to the last frame
and  painting  backwards.    This  option  is  useful when you are using
Trails. 

Start: Set the starting frame to the current values.
 
End: Set the ending frame to the current values.

Fade:  Specify  a  value  from  0-255 to control the amount the brush is
faded  from  its  original colour values.  A setting of 0 has no effect,
while  a  setting of 255 completely fades the brush from view.  The fade
effect  you  get  is  very  dependent  on  the number of colours in your
palette, as well as the number of transitional colours.

Adjust:  Click this button to go to a screen where you can interactively
adjust the X, Y and Z positions of the brush for the beginning or ending
frames.  Which frame you set depends on whether Start or End is selected
when you press adjust.

While  in Adjust mode you can use the perspective control keys to change
the Z axis as well as the brush's X, Y, and Z angles.  Refer to Appendix
B:  Keyboard  Command Summary for a more complete listing of the perspec
tive keyboard commands.

Click and drag with the mouse to move the bounding box on the screen.

Press  the  Ctrl key while dragging the mouse up/down to adjust the size
of the bounding box (Z axis)

Press Keypad 0 to set the size of the box to the screen resolution.
 
Press  Enter  to set the Start or End position to the current values and
return to the Move Camera requester.

Press  Esc  to  return  to the Move requester without saving the current
values.

Preview:  Click  to view (in "wire-frame" mode) the move you have set up
When  the preview is complete, the Move requester returns.  To interrupt
the preview and return to the Move requester, hit the space bar.

Trails:  This  button  is  available  only  if  you  have  more than one
animation frame allocated.  Clicking Trails is like clicking on the Draw
button except on each frame you get the sum total of all of the draws up
to  this point.  The net effect is that of leaving "trails" of the brush
as it moves.

Fill:  Works  like  draw  except  that  when  you click it, the move you
specified is used to draw a filled perspective plane on the whole screen
based on the rotation of the current brush.

Draw: Executes the move that you have specified, causing the brush to be
drawn into animation sequence.

Exit:  Exits  the  requester and keeps all of the settings that you have
entered.

Load: Load listing Move file from Load Move requester.

Save: Save current settings to a Move file using Save Move requester.

Cancel:  Restores  any  settings  that  have been changed and exits this
requester.

Camera Move

Keyboard Equivalent: N

The  Camera  Move  requester is used to create scrolling backgrounds and
camera zoom in/out moves.  The appearance and operation of the requester
is  very  similar  to the Move requester except that you're manipulating
the  entire  screen  background  rather  than  a brush.  The Camera Move
requester  requires  a  spare  page  (which can be larger than your main
page).  When in Adjust mode the Camera Move requester displays a reduced
size spare page so you can more effectively position your camera view.

Dist: Set X, Y, and Z distance that the camera will move in pixels.

X  and  Y  are the horizontal and vertical positions, respectively and Z
con trols the camera in/out position.  Negative Z values display more of
the  background  screen;  positive  values  zoom  into display a smaller
portion of the background.

Zero: Set X, Y, and Z values to 0.

Cyclic:  Click  a check mark in this button to make an animation that is
cyclic  -  ie  it ends and begins in the same place for seamless looping
animations.

Slow  In: Set the number of frames over which you want the camera motion
to gradually accelerate. 

Slow Out: Set the number of frames over which you want the camera motion
to gradually decelerate. 

Count:  Enter  the  number  of frames over which you want to animate the
camera move.
 
Move:  Set the direction to either Go From (start animation from the cur
rent  frame  and move forward) or Come To (start animation at an earlier
frame and end at the current frame.
 
Wrap:  Put  a  check  in this box to automatically wrap the edges of the
image in a camera move when the camera moves off screen.

Start: Set the starting frame to the current values.

End: Set the ending frame to the current values.

Adjust:  Interactively  place  the  beginning  or  ending  frame  of the
animation  sequence that Deluxe Paint will build.  Which frame is set is
determined by whether Start or End is selected when Adjust is activated.

Click and drag the mouse to move the bounding box on the screen.

Press  the  Ctrl key while dragging the mouse up/down to adjust the size
of the bounding box (Z axis).  Use this feature for camera zoom effects.

Press Keypad 0 to set the size of the box to the screen resolution.

Press  Enter  or  return to set the Start or End position to the current
values and return to the the Camera Move requester.

Press  Esc to retuen to the Camera Move requester without saving the cur
rent values.

Preview:  View  a  wireframe preview of the camera move animation.  When
the  preview  is  complete,  the  Move  Camera  requester  returns.   To
interrupt the preview hit the space bar.

New:  Create  a new animation in memory using the current settings.  Any
listing animation is deleted (no warning is issued).  This action cannot
be undone.

Before:  Insert  an animation generated from the current settings before
the cur rent frame

After: Insert an animation generated from the current settings after the
cur rent frame.

Exit: Exit the requester while maintaining the settings you have entered

Load: Load an existing camera move file.

Save: Save current settings as a camera move file.

Cancel:  Restores  any  settings  that  have been changed and exits this
requester.

AnimBrush >>

An  AnimBrursh  is  a  special  type of brush that has more than one cel
associ ated with it.

Load
Displays  the  Load AnimBrush requester.  This requester is identical in
func  tion  to  the  Load  Picture requester described under Load in the
Picture menu, except that you are loading an AnimBrush.

When you load an AnimBrush that has a palette different from that of the
current  picture,  the picture's palette remains in place.  Nonetheless,
the  brush  palette  information is loaded along with the brush; you can
change  to the brush's palette at any time by choosing Palette>Use Brush
Palette from the Colour menu.

Press  F1  to cycle the Load AnimBrush Options panel on/ off.  Check the
Load  With  Palette  check  gadget  to load the brush's palette with the
AnimBrush file.

Save
Displays  the  Save AnimBrush requester.  This requester is identical in
func  tion  to  the Save Brush requester described in the Save option of
the Brush menu.

Press F1 to cycle the Save AnimBrush Options panel on/off.

Pick Up
Selecting  Pick  up  is  similar  to  selecting   the   Brush   Selector
(rectangular  mode)  from  the  Toolbox.    However, when you pick up an
AnimBrush, you pick up all the "cels" that make up the animated sequence
in the AnimBrush.

Cels are to an animated brush what frames are to an animation.

When  you  paint  with an AnimBrush, the brush cycles through its frames
automatically  :as  you paint.  The brush will continuously cycle on the
current  animation frame unless you hold down the Alt key when you press
the  mouse  button  down, in which case the brush will paint each of its
cels sepa rarely into each of the animation sequence frames.

Choosing  Pick  up displays the Pick up AnimBrush requester.  To pick up
the  whole animation, click OK; drag the cross-hair to select the entire
"animat  ed"  area.    When  you  release the mouse button, Deluxe Paint
attaches  an  ani  mated brush to your cursor.  You can use an AnimBrush
with any painting tool, just as you would use a custom brush.

If  you  want  to  make  an  AnimBrush  from  only  a few frames of your
animation,  you  only  need  to pick up those frames.  Move to the first
frame  in your intended AnimBrush, and choose AnimBrush>Pick up, Type in
the  number  of  cels  that  will  compose your AnimBrush in the Pick up
AnimBrush requester, Click OK.

For  example,  let's  say you have an animation of 5 frames and that you
want  to  make an animated brush out of what appears on frames 6 through
10.    You  would  move  to  frame  6,  type  5 in the Pick up AnimBrush
requester and click OK.  Frames 6 through 10 make up cels 1 through 5 of
your new AnimBrush.

Note, however that you cannot pick up an AnimBrush of only one frame.

Holding  down  the  Alt  key  while  picking  up  a brush with the Brush
Selector  is  the  same  as  choosing  AnimBrush>Pick  up.   The Pick up
AnimBrush  requester  appears.    Type  in  the number of cels that will
impose your AnimBrush and click OK.

Settings
After  you  have  picked  up  an  animated  brush, Settings displays the
AnimBrush  Settings  requester.    Use  this  requester  to  control the
AnimBrush.

Number  of  cels:  Shows  you  how  many  cels  of animation are in your
AnimBrush.

Direction:  These  three  icons give you the choice of flipping forward,
flip  ping  backward, or ping ponging through the cels of your AnimBrush
as you paint.

Duration:  Lets  you  set the number of frames it takes the AnimBrush to
move  completely  through  its  cels.  You can also think of this as the
rate  at which the AnimBrush transforms.  For example, if your brush has
10  cels  and  you set duration to 20, your brush will stamp each of its
cels twice before flipping to the next cel.

Current:  Lets you type in the value for the brush cel you want to start
with.    This  is  very  useful  if you want to continue painting from a
particular cel of your brush.

When  the  requester is not displayed, you can step backward and forward
though  the  cels  of  your AnimBrush by pressing 7 or 8 on the keyboard
(not  the  keypad) shift-7 steps to the first cel, and shift 8 steps you
to the last cel.

Use
Makes  the  last AnimBrush you "picked up" the current brush.  This lets
you  pickup  an AnimBrush, then pick up a regular brush, and then return
to  your  AnimBrush.    You   can   also   restore   your   AnimBrush by
right-clicking  the  Brush  Selector.    This toggles between a standard
custom brush and an AnimBrush.

Free
Releases the memory used by the current AnimBrush.

You  cannot retrieve the brush once you free it!  Any time you think you
are  low  on  memory  but before you throw away brushes or frames, press
Ctrl-a.    This  displays information about available memory in the menu
bar.

Frames

Presents  a submenu of options for manipulating the frames in your anima
tion.

Set #
Displays  the  Set  Frame  Count  requester.    Deluxe Paint will try to
allocate as many frames as are requested.  If there is not enough memory
to  allocate  the requested number of frames, Deluxe Paint will allocate
as many as memory will allow.

You  can ,use this requester to add or delete frames to your animation. 
For  example,  you  could  add  several  frames  to  the  middle of your
animation  stepping  to  the  frame  you  want  to add frames after, and
changing  the  num ber of frames to the current count plus the number of
frames you want to add.

Similarly,  you  could  delete  several  frames  from  any point in your
animation by stepping to the first frame you want to delete and changing
the number of frames to the current count minus the number of frames you
want  to  delete.    For example, if you have 100 frames and you want to
delete  frames  41 to 50, step to frame 41 and set the number off frames
to 90. 

Add frames
Displays  a  requester  that lets you add any number of frames after the
cur  rent  frame.  Deluxe Paint copies the contents of the current frame
to the added frames, and makes the last new frame the current one.

Keyboard  Equivalent:  Ctrl-click on the + icon in the Animation Control
Panel.  Alt-= will automatically add a single frame to the animation.

Copy Frames

Keyboard Equivalent: Ctrl-f

Displays  a requester that lets you copy the current frame to a range of
frames  or to all the frames in your animation sequence.  Use the Insert
Before  Frame edit box to place the copied range of frames in your anima
tion  before  a  certain  frame.  This is the only requester option that
will actu ally add/insert newer frames in your animation.

Delete Frames
Displays  a requester that lets you delete the current frame, a range of
frames  or  all  frames  in  your animation sequence.  If you delete the
current  frame, Deluxe Paint makes the following frame the current frame
unless you are already at the last frame.

Keyboard  Equivalent:  Ctrl-click on the - icon in the Animation Control
Panel.    Right-Amiga  - (A-minus key) automatically deletes the current
frame of your animations

Set Frame Rate

Keyboard Equivalent: Right Amiga - R

This  requester controls the frame rate(s) of your animation on a global
or frame by frame basis.

Play  Rate:  Click  either a Global (fps) rate or Vary By Frame setting.
If  Global  (fps)  is  selected, type the desired frame rate (frames per
second)  in the text gadget at the right.  The maximum frames per second
is  deteremined  by how large your animation is, your Amiga CPU, and the
screen  mode  and  resolution the animation is displayed in.  If Vary By
Frame is selected, use the options at the bottom of the requester to set
the frame rate for a single frame, a range of frames, or all frames.

Specify Frame Rate In: Use the slider or text gadgets to set the Vary By
Frame  rate  in  Frames  per  Second  or  Jiffies (a jiffie is a unit of
measurement equal to one divided by the frame rate of the current mode).
Note  that dou ble-buffered modes are'nt as fast as regular modes.  When
using  the  Frames  Per Second slider, you can select a legal frame rate
(based on even divisibles of the frame rate of the current mode; see the
Display Information window in the Screen Format requester).

The  jiffies  text gadget lets you set a pause based on Jiffies (1/frame
rate  of  the  current  mode).   To set a frame pause in seconds, type a
number that is the multiple of the frame rate for the current mode.  For
example,  in NTSC Lo-Res the maximum frame rate is 60 fps, so to pause a
frame for 3 sec onds, you would enter 180 jiffies (3x60).

After  you  have chosen a variable frame rate, you can apply the rate to
the following frame choices:

Current Frame: The default, this will make the current frame use the fps
or jiffies value entered above.

Range:  This  radio button applies the frame rate to the range of frames
speci  fied in the text gadgets (first frame to last frame) to the right
of the button.

All  Frames: Apply the frame rate in fps or jiffies to all frames in the
anima tion.

Set Frame Palette
Displays  the  Set Frame Palette requester where you can set up multiple
palettes  for  an  animation.  To create multiple palette animations you
must first create unique palettes, then apply the palettes to the frames
you  wish  to change.  Once you've made a unique palette, you can modify
its  colours,  load  in  a  new  palette,  or  load an image and use its
palette.

Palette  Number:  Enter the number of the palette you wish to apply to a
sin gle frame or a range of frames.
 
Current  Frame:  Apply  the selected palette to the current frame of the
ani mation.

Range:  Apply  the  selected  palette to the specified range (set in the
text boxes to the right of the box). 

All  Frames:  Apply  the  selected  palette  to  all  the  frames of the
animation.
 
Make  Palette:  Creates a new palette from the palette currently used in
the  selected frame(s).  On exit, Deluxe Paint creates a unique palette,
which  you  can  modify without affecting the palettes used in any other
frames.

Frame Palette Info
Displays  the  Frame  Palette  Info  window which shows a list of frames
associ ated with the current palette. 

Palette  #:  The  number of the current palette - the one applied to the
cur rent frame.

Frames  Using  Current  Palette:  A  list of frames that use the current
palette.

Free:  Click this button to purge the selected palette from memory.  The
frames  using this palette are given the palette from the frame previous
to the first occurrence of the 'freed' palette.  Use the close gadget in
the top left cor ner of the window to exit this requester.
 
Control
Control  displays  a  submenu of options for moving around in your anima
tion frames and for playing the animation. 

Panel

Keyboard Equivalent: Alt-a

Displays  the Deluxe Paint Animation Control Panel.  It contains a Frame
Counter  scroll  bar  and  15  control  buttons  for working through and
playing  your  animations.    Click an option on the Panel to select it.
When  the panel is displayed, a check mark appears next to the option in
the menu.

The options represented by the control buttons can also be selected from
the  Anim  and Effect menus, which is where these features are described
in  detail.  It is conveinient to have them all in the Control Panel, so
you  don't  have  to  access  a  menu,  or use the keyboard while you're
working on your animation.

Frame Counter
The  number  of the current frame and the total number of frames in your
animation appear in the left corner of the Title Bar.  You can move to a
spe  cific  frame  by dragging the Frame Counter scroll bar, clicking on
either  side  of  the  scroll  box,  or  by  clicking  the Next Frame or
Previious  Frame  icons  in the Control Panel.  Any movement you make is
reflected in the numbers on the Title Bar.

Set Range
Displays  the  Set Play Range Requester.  Use this requester to instruct
Deluxe  Paint  to  play  any  range  of  frames  or  all  frames in your
animation.

The From number in your range must be smaller than the to number for the
range to play correctly.

The  range setting is used by the Play Once and Ping Pong options in the
Control submenu, but the Play option is not affected.

This option is especially useful if you are editing a small section of a
large  animation.   You can edit the frames and play only the frames you
are editing to see your changes.

Previous

Keyboard Equivalent: 1

Steps the current frame to the previous frame in the animation sequence.
If the current frame is the first frame, the position is set to the last
frame.

Next

Keyboard Equivalent: 2

Steps the current frame to the next frame in the animation sequence.  If
the  current  frame  is the last frame, the position is set to the first
frame.

Go to

Keyboard Equivalent: 3

Displays  the  Go  to Frame requester.  This requester lets you position
the  cur  rent  frame to any of the available animation frames.  You can
also  display  this  requester  by  Ctrl-clicking  the Go to icon on the
Animation Control Panel.

Repeat Last Go To
 
Keyboard Equivalent: Shift-3

Clicking  on  this  icon brings you to the frame number set in the Go To
requester.  You can display this requester either by choosing Control>Go
to from the Anim menu, or by Ctrl-clicking on this icon.

Play

Keyboard Equivalent: 4
 
Plays  the  animation  at  the speed set in the Set Rate requester.  The
anima tion sequence will continue cycling until you press the space bar.
(You can reverse the direction of playback by pressing r on the keyboard
while the animation is playing).

Play Once

Keyboard Equivalent: 5

Plays the animation sequence once through from Frame 1 to the last frame.

Ping-Pong

Keyboard Equivalent: 6

Plays  the  animation  sequence continuously as in Play above, but plays
the sequence forward then backward then forward then backward and so on.
Click or press the space bar to stop the animation.

Method >>

The  Method  menu  contains  two  submenu  options  which can be used to
specify the "memory model" of the animation sequence frames.  The memory
model  refers  only to the animation in RAM, not to the disk file.  When
you load an animation it is loaded into your current memory model.

Compressed
The  Compressed  Method  while  a  little more complex than the Expanded
Method, offers the advantage of permitting many more animation frames in
memory  at  one  time.    The  compressed memory model only needs enough
memory to store the differences between frames.  While this model allows
for more frames, it has a couple of disadvantages: it is slower than the
expanded  method  while  animpainting, loading and saving are slower and
memory tends to fragment, making it easy to run out of memory.

Expanded
The  Expanded  Method  represents  the simplest of the two memory models
where  all  of the memory for each animation frame is allocated.  If you
are  in  low  resolution mode, 320x200 and you have 10 animation frames,
then  you would need enough memory to hold 10 complete 320 x 200 images.
Two  advantages  of  this  method  are  that  the  frame  flipping   for
animpainting  is  very smooth, and you will not run out of memory to add
an element to your animation within the allocated frames.

If  you  set this option and then request animation frames, Deluxe Paint
auto matically inserts the maximum number of available frames in the Set
Frame  Count  requester  so that you don't have to guess how many frames
you can create.

Colour Menu

Ranges

Keyboard Equivalent: Ctrl-r

Displays  the  Range  requester  which  you can use to define customised
colour  ranges for the colour cycling, gradient fill, and Shade features
of DeluxePaint.

Range 

The  Range requester lets you specify the colours in a range (maximum of
256 colours) and how the colours are mixed.  You can define eight ranges
for each picture or animation.

To define a range:

The  RANGE slider indicates the number of the current range.  By default
this  is  range  1.    You can see the range of colours displayed on the
range  bar.   Click to the right of the slider or drag the slider to the
right to access an empty range bar.

All  range  based  features  depend  on  the  Range  number  set in this
requester.    Once  you've created ranges to work with, you can step for
ward  and  backward  through  them  without  entering  the  requester by
pressirng Alt-] and Alt-[.

To  select  a  colour for the range, move the arrow cursor to the row of
colours in the requester and click on a colour.

When  you  click  a  colour, it appears in the sample square.  The arrow
cursor  becomes  the  colour  bead cursor.  If you don't want to use the
colour  you  chose, click another with the colour bead cursor.  When the
colour you want is in the sample square:

Move  the  bead  cursor to the range bar.  Position the cursor where you
want  the  selected  colour to fall in the range, and click.  The colour
appears in the range.

The  position  of  colours  in the range control the cycle direction for
each  range, and also sets the direction of the range when it is used as
a  gra dient.  The start colour is the colour furthest left on the range
bar.  Any colour cycling begins with this colour.

Each  colour  you  place  on  the  bar appears in the range sample.  The
gradient  between  colours,  that  is  the transition of shades from one
colour to the next, is calculated automatically.  You can place original
colours  far  apart  to  create  subtle  blending  of  colours, or close
together to create more abrupt transitions between original shades.

In  modes  other than HAM or 24 bit backing store mode, Deluxe Paint can
use only colours currently in the palette to make these transitions.  If
the  transitional  shades  are not in the palette, colours may appear as
discrete  or  unevenly  mixed bands in the range.  You can overcome this
limitation by adding the transitional shades to the palette.

COPYING TIP
It  is possible to copy a range to the next range set in the requester. 
To  do  this:  Move  to a defined range you want to copy; drag the Range
slider  to  the  range  number  you  want to copy to; click Undo.  (It's
important to click Undo with no intervening clicks after you display the
range number you want to copy to.

Rate
The  Rate  slider  lets you control the speed of colour cycling for each
range.  Drag the slider to the right for faster cycling.  While dragging
the  slider  you  can  monitor  the  colour cycling on the page, even if
Colour  Cycling  is  turned  off.   The number to the rate of the slider
indicates  the  current  speed setting.  This number is intended to help
you  set  different  ranges  to  the  same  speed.   The number does not
indicate  the  relative speed of the cycling since the increments from 0
to 63 are not equal.

Fade
This  slider  sets  the  gradient  translucency  mount for the currently
selected  bead  in  the range bead line.  The values range from 0 (fully
opaque)  to  255  (fully  translucent).   Deluxe Paint will allow you to
place  fade values on any individual colour bead in your range up to 256
colours.

To create a gradient with translucency values, select a colour and place
it on the range bar.  While the colour is still selected (if you want to
select  a colour that is already on the range bar click to select it and
then  put  it  back  down on the bar in its original position), drag the
FADE  slider to set the translu cency value for the selected colour.  As
you  do  this you will notice that a small square bead appears below the
selected colour and changes from black to white as you increase the fade
slider.    Black is an indication of pure colour or opaqueness and white
is an indication of colourless 100% translucency.

When  you manipulate fade values for any colour in the range bar, Deluxe
Paint  interpolates to create a spread of fade values between the select
ed  colour and the nearest colour that has a fade value assigned to it. 
You  can  set  fade values for beads in the range bar even if no colours
are  assigned to the bead location - a box will appear below the bead to
show the selected fade setting.

Show
Click  SHOW to see the results of your colour selections and placements.
The  band  beneath  the  bar shows the gradual transition from colour to
colour  as  it would appear if you had access to all 4096 colours in the
colour  universe  (as  you  do  in  HAM mode).  The band above the Range
requester  shows  the  gradient  as  it  will appear using the available
colours in the palette of your current mode.

Select
To  select  a range of colours, click the first colour in the range, and
click  SELECT.   The dropper icon appears attached to the cursor.  Click
the  second  colour,  and all the colours up to and including the second
colour are select ed.

Clear
To  eliminate  a  colour from the bar click it, move the bead cursor off
the bar, and click again.  The arrow cursor returns.

To eliminate all colours from the range, click the CLEAR action button

Rev

Keyboard Equivalent: Alt-r

You  can  reverse  the  direction of the colour range, and therefore the
direction of cycling and gradient by clicking the REVERSE action button.

Select  another  colour  and  position  it on the bar.  Repeat this step
until  all  the colours you want are on the bar.  To reposition a colour
on the bar click it, move the bead cursor to another position, and click
again.

Dither
There  are  three dither options.  When Smooth is selected, Deluxe Paint
tries  to  blend  the  colours  of  the  range  as smoothly as possible.
Pattern splits the colours more, but uses a slight dither at each colour
border.    Random allows you to set the dither from no dither to smooth,
using the dither slider

Dither Slider
The  slider  beneath the Random button reduces the contrast between adja
cent colours (without changing the colours themselves).  Drag the Dither
slider  to  the  right  to  increase  the amount of dither.  Setting the
slider  all  the  way  to the left gives almost no random mixing between
shades.    Moving the slider to the right increases the amount of mixing
at the colour boundaries.

If  you are not in HAM or 24 bit backing store mode, and you have placed
colours  on the gradient bar with empty notches between the colours, you
may  not  see  the  dither  effect  you  expect.  When you leave notches
between colours on the bar Deluxe Paint calculates the spread of colours
that  would  fill  the  notches  and  then  looks in the palette for the
closest  matching  colours  to  fill  in  the range.  In many cases, the
closest  colour will be one of the colours already on the bar.  A dither
between two identical colours will look like no dither at all.

In  modes  other  than  HAM  or 24 bit backing store, it is advisable to
always  place  all the colours you want in your gradient on the bar with
no  empty  notches  between  them.    This  way you will get exactly the
colours you expect, and the dither will appear as you would expect it to

If  you  are working in HAM mode, you won't see the dither effect in the
gradient  sample  painted  in  this requester.  To see the gradient with
dither effects, go to the Fill Type requester.

OK
Click Ok to accept the changes and exit.

Undo
You  can  reverse  the  last  change  you  made  in the palette or Range
requester by clicking UNDO.

Revert
This  returns  the Range requester to the condition it was in before you
dis played the requester.

Grid
Click  this  check  box  to  display  a  grid  around the colours of the
palette.   Register colours have a white grid highlight and non-register
colours have a blue grid highlight.  The grid is off by default.

Cycle
Keyboard Equivalent: Tab

Toggles  colour  cycling  on/off.  Colour cycling uses the colour ranges
you  define  in the Range requester.  (See Range above).  If a colour is
not  included  in  any  range,  it  does not cycle.  See "Animation with
Colour Cycling" in Tutorial One of Chapter Four: Painting Tutorials

Palette >>

Mixer On/Off
Keyboard Equivalent: p

Displays/removes  the  Colour Mixer.  You can also display this Mixer by
right-clicking  the  Colour  Indicator  (between  the  Palette  and  the
Toolbox).

There  is  a subtle but important difference between removing the Colour
Mixer  by  choosing the menu option and by clicking OK.  When you choose
the  menu  option  or  press  p,  the  Colour Mixer is hidden behind the
current  screen  and the data in the Mixing Area remains intact when you
redisplay  the  requester.    Clicking  OK  in the requester accepts all
changes in the Colour Mixer and clears the Mixing Area.

The  Colour Mixer is the master colour control panel.  From here you can
mix and modify colours, create spreads, and copy or exchange colours.

The  Colour  Mixer and the Arrange Palette requester described below let
you  work  with  a  256  colour  Colour Set, regardless of the number of
colours  you  are  actually using in your current screen format.  If you
are  in  a mode other than HAM, you can paint only with the colours that
are in the Palette.  The Palette colours are arranged in the first slots
of  row  0.  You can identify them by the white highlight on the top and
left  edge  of each colour when the Grid is turned on.  The other Colour
Set  colours  have  a light blue highlight on the top and left edge when
the  Grid  is  turned  on.   Occassionally you will see us refer to your
Palette colours as your "base register" colours.                        

In  Extra  Halfbrite mode (64 colour mode) you cannot modify the colours
in  rows  2-3.    These  are  the  Halfbrite colours and always take the
Halfbrite  value  of  the corresponding Palette colours in rows 0-1.  If
you  attempt  to copy to, exchange with, delete, or spread the Halfbrite
colours, nothing will happen.

In  HAM,  HAM8  or 24-bit RGB mode, you can paint with any colour in the
available  colour universe (4096 colours in HAM, 262,144 in HAM8 etc.). 
The  Colour  Set  is merely a holding spot for extra colours beyond your
"base register" colours.
