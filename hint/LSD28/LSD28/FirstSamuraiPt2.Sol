PART 2.
-------

LEVEL 7.
--------


A light step to the  immediate  right,  bounce  over what looks like a
stick of  celery  (  but  probably  isn't  ),  along  right  (  ignore
retracting platforms ), seize bell, jump  up, slash, walk over special
and return to start ( get the  grenades but use extremely sparingly ).
Left, avoid acid drip, fully  left  (  avoiding  acid ) for food. Back
along, jump up right hand side of  ladder  and right if you need food,
otherwise left. Climb down ladder, quickly slashing when you reach the
bottom for rat killing purposes. It's probably best to scarper here in
preference to standing around getting killed.
Left ( avoiding acid )  and  jump  onto platform.Jump over leeks, left
and jump over pits ( position samurai  so that his front foot is fully
over the platform in order to  make  it  ). Ring bell, croos stars and
fall directly downwards to obtain  another  special. Up via retracting
platform, left across bridge and  use  pot.  Continually hit left hand
side of the stone tablet, this will  move  it  to the right so you can
use it to jump  on  to  the  first  retractingplatform  to collect the
special. Left, directly down and  down  again. Right, climb ladder,get
bell and take potion (  go  down  right  to  kill  baddies if the bell
has'nt appeared ).
Head right from the position to  which you are teleported, spring over
celery and go  down  ladder.  Carefully  manoevere  yourself  onto the
ladder below and summon the Wizzard Mage  to  lend a hand or two. Some
stars will appear below the retracting platforms to ease your crossing
of the gap (  climb  up  ladder  before  jumping  ),  but DON'T CROSS.
Instead , go up ladder, along right, up ladder, and right for ages.Get
bell, slash at nearby ceiling for  food  and treasure, return to where
you just rang the bell, stand on platform ( not ladder ) and cross pit
using stars to support you.  Down  steps,  move  stone tablet along by
hitting it until it's under the  projecting platform ( and lashing out
at the large moving statueas it  comes  towards  you ),jump up, and up
again for another special and a bell.
Jump over statue and right. Ring bell  next to water jetty and hack it
when it solidifie's. Slash at  ceiling  to  the right for treasure and
use pot. Go back left, use  stone  tablet  to get onto the platform so
that you can jump over  the  statue,  and  get  bell.Back right to the
second water jetty and ring bell. Slash ice, right, sslash ceiling and
left for end of level nasty number one - a big red dragon's head. He's
easy. Stand at either the left or the  right - hand side of the dragon
and and slash at his head every  time  he come's towards you. To speed
things up, jump around a bit using  fly  slashes to hit him. Don't get
stuck underneath his torso, though, in fear of being fired at. There's
food to be gobbled if  you  jump  and  slash from the first projecting
platform you get to. Right, climb wall, get bell, drop onto the yellow
platform, jump left. Jump up  retracting platforms for another special
and ring bell next to water  jetties,  then hit them when solid. Left,
up retracting platforms, and that's it.....


LEVEL 8.
--------


Right, sock all  passing  windows  for  suitable  refreshment, and the
third group preceeding the soldier for  a yellow object to ring. Right
( do not save position ),  bash  windows for food, right, call Wizard,
ring bell whilst  to  left  of  pillar  underneath  firing gun turret,
right, fetch ball and utilise potion.  Slash windows to your immediate
left for food. The Wizard  should  come  in  handy for blowing up that
doorway with the resulting special coming in double handy.
Right and up the first  lift.  Jump  left  onto  the lower roof, punch
windows and jump via same lift onto the green roof directly right. Use
lift, manically hurling yourself  left  weilding  your sword ceiling -
wards for a bell. Left and up first visible lift. Bound left onto blue
roof, then onto lift which moves up  and down directly over the other.
Jump right when top lift reaches  it's  high  point. Ring bell to calm
the firing down a tad, right  and  use  pot.  Take out cracked part of
platform, sink downwards and  slash  windows.  Say  thank  you for the
special. pounce from right hand side of platform, trundle fully right,
collar the bell and exercise the potion.
Chime bell at end of platform,  tumble  down right, right, and I doubt
anyone else will be  wanting  that  bell  or  potion. Once teleported,
right is the direction you'll be  wanting - over bridge, save position
via second pot and fling yourself  off  the  end  of the roof with the
joystick wrenched rightwards to land  on  the  blue roof. Ring bell in
the vicinity of the force - field,  and hack repeatedly at the crystal
until the barrier breaks.
Right ( don't teleport yet ), up  ladder, up ladder, make off with the
bell and special, slash  at  cracked  part  of  the platform, down and
teleport. Hack left behind the scenery for treasure, and jump and hack
for a special. Ring bell, hit  crystal, right, use pot, slash windows,
right, slash  windows  and  teleport.  Walk  to  right  side  of roof,
carefully get down to lower level  of  roof  and enter house. Slash at
ceilings for food, snitch bell and  withdraw  to roof. Leap from right
hand side of roof onto  middle  platform,  use  pot, ascend ladder and
pinch special.Left to get your  feet  back  on  terra ferma, ring bell
when both force - fields come into  view, hit crystals and and proceed
right. Onto oil drum, onto first retracting platform, left above where
barriers were and cleve ceiling for booty.
To bump off  end  of  level  baddie,  simply  slash  at  it  using the
retracting platforms on left when necessary, avoiding it's shots. It's
very very easy.Complete  level  by  going  up  platforms, jumping onto
projecting scenery to right, and slashing  for two more specials. Back
to top retracting platform, grabbing ladder ( by standing on the right
edge of the top platform,  jump  right  then  quickly  left ). Up. And
left.


LEVEL 9.
--------


Gasp loudly at  the  three  -  speed  parallax  scrolling.  Then treat
yourself to that smartbomb,  jump  left  and heartlessly murder enough
baddie's to enable you to swipe bell, and plunge left. Depart right as
far as poss to pocket three  specials. Scale right side of third-from-
right pole ( jump in order  to  clutch  to  it ), jump right onto next
platform, down and that special is  your's.  Up ( by vaulting left out
of cabin and abruptly pulling right on the joystick to grab outside of
the ladder ), and up again. Cavort  right, slash ceiling and down onto
ground level. Get special  on  left  and  at  far  right ( slashing at
ceilings for food ). Climb first  pillar  from right, reach smart bomb
and drop down to collect special. Up right side of pillar again, hurry
onto shorter platform, slash up left for another special, collect, and
up and down other side back to ground level. Up into cabin on left and
continue upwards as far as possible, collecting special on the way.
Continue up by using the tower to  the leftand jumping between the two
when necessary, slashing ceiling and  video camera's when appropriate.
Following the  above  information  should  get  you  to  a  horizontal
platform with a bell and  the  nine  required specials ( and hopefully
enough energy ). There  are  plenty  more  food and specials scattered
about it if you can be bothered  to  locate  them ( i couldn't ). Move
right until a force-field  is  reached  and  ring  that bell. Hack the
remaining force-field once,  kill  the  resulting  baddie, hack again,
kill, and so on. You can abandon this  part to find food if you really
muck it up. And thats just about the size of the level.


LEVEL 10.
---------


Left, apprehend smart bomb, left,  nab  special, right, lay your hands
on the bell, right, hop onto  potted  plant, thrust joystick up again,
grab ladder on left and  heroically  clamber  out.  Right for age's to
abduct another special, and back left  again and cross gap. Left, jump
onto shortest brown barrel,  leap  left,  left  again,  left again and
slash at grey ceiling for a  little  something  to put behind your ear
for later. Drop directly down  and  slash  onto second ground level of
level and show your weapon to the grey thing for a smart bomb.
Walk right over barrels, grab ladder and climb up. Right, up steps and
left into black room with computers  in.  Project yourself to climb up
ladder, enter house, hit the ceiling to purloin food and special. Walk
down ladder, left along  grey  platform,  jump  and  slash for another
special. Left onto brown  ledge's,  hooraying, truncating for treasure
and food.
Up ladder, hail Wizard when you  can,  go no further right, claim that
bell you just lapsed and  ascend.  Left,  jump onto gray platforms and
slash twice at end  ceiling  for  a  light  snack  and a special. Back
right, up twinkling stars and right.  Watch  out for the blue baddie's
who blow deadly rings at you -  they deserve nothing more than instant
death as soon as they appear. Continue  along the platform and lob our
hero off the end. Right, onto small grey platform and onto ladder, up,
and up ladder on level above.
Left, up steps and up ladder. Left  as  far as feasible ( slashing for
treasure ), up ladder, right,  onto  potted  plant, get smart bomb and
get special. Right, past chequered scenery, get lamp, hit scenery in a
variety of shown places, back to  either  side of chequered part, ring
bell and kill  the  end-of-level  nastie-possibly  the  easiest end of
level nastie to kill in the whole game.
