                            BY DR. BUTCHER


LEVEL 1.
--------

ACCESS CODE :EDJI
-----------------


     Go left, notice hanging  vine.  (  As  this  is  a Delphine game,
you've probably realised that you are  going  to need this !) Go right
past the water. You'll  be  confronted  with  three deadly creatures -
kick to kill them. Right again  to  confront  more creatures - kick to
kill them too. Watch out for more nasties falling from the roof.
     Go right until you come across  a  black beast, then turn and run
back to the hanging vine. Take  a  running  jump  at the vine - do not
hesitate !
     Jump off the vine and  run  right,  back  to  the place where you
first encountered the beast.


LEVEL 2.
--------

ACCESS CODE : HICI
------------------


     Wake up in a cage with an alien. Rock the cage left then right in
order to make it swing  back  and  forth  until  the  cage drops on an
alien. Now pick up the gun  that  the  alien you landed on dropped and
run to the right, protecting your alien friend by shooting the guards.
Use the shield to protect him while  he opens the door. Now follow him
through the door to the lift and go to the bottom level. Go to the end
and shoot out the flashing light  on  the  wall.  Take the lift to the
next level up, blast the door,  run  and  jump  up. Wait for the alien
before you open the door, then walk in.


LEVEL 3.
--------

ACCESS CODE : FLLD
------------------


     Into the small tunnels  underground  -  left,  drop, right, drop,
right drop, left, drop, right, drop...and out !


LEVEL 4.
--------

ACCESS CODE: LIBC.
------------------


     Left through door, and charge your gun. Right, then blast through
three doors. Run to the right to  the  exit. Kill the guard, then walk

to the end of the  broken  bridge.  Leap  onto  the lower right ledge,
blast a hole in the wall and go through it.


LEVEL 5.
--------

ACCESS CODE: CCAL.
------------------


     Go right, down first  shaft,  right  again,  then down onto large
rock. Jump right, go right and jump  over  the spiked pit. Walk to the
next screen, wait for the large rock  to  crash to the floor, then run
to the small spike on the floor ( watch out for the flying creature ).
When two rocks fall together and hit the floor, run. ( Repeat the rock
sequence on the next screen ).
     Beware of the tentacles ( they can  be  shot, or you can just run
past them ). Go right  to  encounter  more tentacles and some snapping
traps. Jump over the traps, continue  right  to  the end and blast the
wall.


LEVEL 6.
--------


ACCESS CODE: EDIL.
------------------


     Backtrack to the  screen  with  the  falling  rocks.  Walk up the
slope, turn and shoot at  the  flying  creature.  Walk  on to the next
screen and watch. Take a running jump  at the stalactite, climb to the
top and jump to the next one. Repeat this procedure with each one - if
you do it correctly, you should end up on a large rock.


LEVEL 7.
--------


ACCESS CODE: FADK.
------------------


     Walk left off the rock, turn and blast the rock, then walk up the
rock. Go right, jump over two  pits,  then  one pit. Walk right, blast
the wall to release water, then  turn  and run rather quickly, leaping
over the pits like Wayne Sleep !
     Logic wins every time -  go  right,  blast  the wall, go past the
steps and across the dried up waterfall.


LEVEL 8.
--------


ACCESS CODE: KCIJ.
------------------


     Observe the alien trapped below, exit left over the waterfall and
go through the door. Go down the steps, walk right and kill the guard.
Go back up the steps and shoot at  the light chain ( this releases the
alien above ).
     Go back down the steps and run to the right as far as you can go.
Kick the guard, then run and pick  up  the gun. Kill the guard and run
right - don't stop ( ignore the guards ).


LEVEL 9.
--------


ACCESS CODE: ICAH.
------------------


     Dive into the water,  swim  across,  climb  out  and  take a look
around. Swim down to the hole in  the wall, left along the tunnel, and
go up the second shaft for air.
     Swim right down to the bottom of the shaft, go right, get out for
air and fire at the pulsating line. Reverse manoeuvre back to the pool
surface.


LEVEL 10.
---------


ACCESS CODE: FIEI.
------------------


     Go left and kill the guard. Go right and up the stairs, then kill
the guard on the left at  the  top  of  the stairs. Jump across right,
blast the two doors down and  get  your  blaster  ready to fire at the
last door as the shield fades. Accurate timing and speed are needed to
kill the guard ( alternatively, you  can  blast the last door, shield,
jump the fireballs and the fire to kill the guard ).
     Go right, blast the door, right, then jump up to charge your gun.
Go right and watch the reflection  of  the  guard on the bottom of the
green sphere -  fire  at  the  sphere  when  the  guards reflection is
directly under it. Left to  the  stairs,  go  down them, then down and
right to the pool. Swim across,  get  out  and find the guard dead. Go
right.


LEVEL 11.
---------


ACCESS CODE: LALD.
------------------


     Jump down the opening, go right,  blast  the door, run to the end
of the corridor. Turn and put on  a  shield, then wait until the alien
puts his arm down and  pulls  you  up.  Stay  on  the left side of the
opening till the rocks fall,  then  follow  the  alien to the tank. To
escape, press the top left hand green button ( but first have some fun
pressing a few others ).


LEVEL 12.
---------


ACCESS CODE: LFEK.
------------------


     Exit from the pod,  run  right  onto  the  next  screen, kill the
guards and run to the  right.  Sit  back  and  leave machine in drive.
Crawl across the floor to the  levers  on  the  right and wait for the
guard to walk towards you. Pull the  lever  to kill the guard with the
laser, pull the second lever, then  crawl  back to the light circle on
the floor to escape from ANOTHER WORLD.....
