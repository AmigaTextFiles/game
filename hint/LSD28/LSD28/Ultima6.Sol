     Ok, by now just about everybody in the country has this game
from one source or the other, but a lot of people are having a
hard time figuring out what to do, so I wrote up this little
phile to help you get unstuck.  You may not want to read too far
ahead, because this tells everything you have to do in the game
and you don't want to ruin the all the fun, do you?  I heard from
some people who have the cracked version that they can't use
their orb of the moons.  This is becuase the crack removed the
doc check you have to face when you talk with Lord British right
when you start the game.  Unfortunately, right after the doc
check, is when you ask British how to use the orb and he tells
you.  This is the only way you can learn how to use it.  The
people with the cracked version can't get him to respond.  Having
the orb is really useful, but there are ways to get around it
which I will describe later.

     When you start the game, you see a nifty intro and you end
up in British's Castle.  After doing the doc check and asking
British about the orb, you can wander around and pick up anything
you want.  Make sure you get both keys (I think British gives you
one to begin with), the spell book, the magic wand (from the
mage's room), all you gear, reagents, lockpicks, etc. from your
room.  You can get the potions from the alchemy room.  Be sure to
get some cheese from the kitchen pantry.  Give the cheese to the
little mouse in the alchemy room, by the ladder.  She will join
your party.  You need her in several places later in the game. 
To get out of the castle, you need to use one of the keys to open
the gatehouses to get at the winch and lever to raise the
portcullis and lower the drawbridge.

     Before I go any further, I'll tell you about the two cheats
I know about for this game.  The first is the Alt codes.  You can
use either Alt-2-1-3 or Alt-2-1-4 to go to anyplace on the map. 
I never tried these (I heard about it after I won the game and
took it off my hard drive), but I heard that they do work.  You
may have to put in some coordinates, I dunno.  The second cheat I
have used.  You can get any item, give yourself and teammates
free levels, boost your hit points and karma pts, and do a few
other things.  Talk to Iolo.  The conversation will go something
like this:

"What do you want my friend?"
@SPAM
"Ask Shamino about that."
@SPAM
"Ask Shamino about that."
@SPAM
"Ask Shamino about that."
@HUMBUG
"Cheat menu:...."

Got it?  I'll give you a few of the items.  58 is a spell.  Hit
quality 255 and you'll get every single spell.  8 is a magic
helm.  23 is magic armor.  16 is a magic shield.  28 is swamp
boots (a must).  48 is a glass sword (kills anything - 1 blow). 
54 is a magic bow, 55 is arrows.  79 and 80 are wands.  57 is a
spellbook.  65-75 are the reagents.  88 is a bunch of gold coins. 
77 is gems.  107 is a shovel (I threw this in because you get
into a lot of situations where you need one).  This cheat lets
you get into the game without having to run all over looking for
monsters to fight for experience or money or items.

NOTE: be sure to buy a skiff ASAP and have someone carry it
around with them.

     Your first major task is to free the shrines.  To do this,
you need the runes.  There's one in each city.  The rune of
compassion is in Britain.  The kid in the conservatory has it,
but you have to ask her parents if it's ok if she gives it to
you.  The rune of justice is in Yew.  Get permission from the
mayor to see the prisoner.  Ask him about the rune.  He'll feed
you a story about his "6 kids to feed", but just tell him he's
lying and he'll give you the location of the rune.  The rune of
honesty is in Moonglow.  Go to Manrel (he's the dude with the
star on his forehead) and ask for the key to Beyvin's grave.  You
can get to the catacombs where Beyvin's buried through the pantry
of the tavern.  There's lots of good crud in the tombs for you to
take and the rune's in Beyvin's tomb.  The rune of honor's in
Trinsic on a pedestal in the middle of the city.  To get the rune
of humility, talk to the mayor of New Magincia.  He'll give it to
you when you tell him the name of the humblest person in town.  I
don't remember the name, but it's the one who keeps saying he's
not humble, etc.  The rune of sacrifice in Minoc is hard to get. 
You have to join the artists guild to get it.  For this you need
to learn "Stones" and make some pipes.  Go to Yew and to the
northwest, you can buy a log from the logger.  Take it to the
sawmill east of Minoc and he'll make you a board.  Julia in Minoc
can make you pipes from the board.  Gwenno, in Britain ( I think
she works at the bow place) can teach you stones.  Then the chief
artist dude will give you the rune.   In Skara Brae, the rune of
spirituality is in a basket in someone's house.  The rune of
valor is in Jhelom in a hole in the wall in a tavern.  Send the
mouse through the hole to get it. 
     Now that you have the runes, you need to take them to the
shrines and use them to get the moonstones.  Use the orb of themoons for this.  Below are the positions for using the orb.  They
are in relation to your avatar.

Moonglow       Sh.Honesty     Britain   Sh.Compassion  Jhelom

Sh.Humil       Sh.Control     Castle    Sh.Passion     Sh.Valor

N.Maginc       Void            YOU      Void           Yew

Sh.Spirit      Slab           Sh.Dilig  Isle Avatar    Sh.Justice

Skara Brae     Sh.Honor       Trinsic   Sh.Sacrifice   Minoc

     Go to the shrines and use the correct rune on the moonstone. 
You will be prompted for a mantra:
Compassion: MU
Honor: SUMM
Spirit: OM
Valor: RA
Honesty: AHM
Sacrifice: CAH
Justice: BEH
Humility: LUM

Then grab the stone.  Note that gargoyles may be wandering around
the shrine while you do this and might even attack you.  Unless
you're in deep, don't waste your time fighting them, just get you
stone and zip out with the orb.


     Next you need to track down the parts of a pirate map.  This
is very long and very annoying, so I'll try to make it as easy as
possible.
     Iolo starts the game with a book.  Take it to the Lycaeum
(north of Moonglow) and show it to Mariah.  She says she could
translate it if she only had the other half of a tablet.  Guess
what you need to find?  Go to Buccanner's Den and talk to Homer. 
He tells you he'll only deal with you if you join the thieves
guild, so go out the secret door in the bar's kitchen and talk to
the guy in the house behind the bar.  He'll tell you that you
need to get a thieves' belt to join.  Go back to British's Castle
and go down the ladder to the sewers.  On the third level,
there's a retired thief named Phoenix living to the north.  Use
the pickpocket spell to steal her belt or just waste her (tho
this screws your karma).  To the west of her cave, she has a
bunch of chests full of some nifty stuff you can steal.  Take the
belt back to Homer and he'll tell you the story of Captain
Hawkin's treasure.  You need to find nine pieces of the treasure
map.  He gives you a bunch of leads.  I'll just tell you the
final resting places of the pieces.
     One piece is on a shipwreck on the chain of islands in
southern Brittainnia by Serpent's Hold.
     One is on the body of a guy in the ant mounds (in the desert
east of Minoc).
     One is in the dungeon Wrong.  The entrance to the dungeon is
to the south of Minoc (ya' need a boat).  On the third level,
there's a room with a big plant.  There's a secret door on the
east wall that takes you to the map.
     One piece is in the dungeon Shame (in the mountains to the
west of Britain, you need to go to the west coast and come in by
boat).  The owner is on the fourth level and will trade it to you
for some food.
     The cook, Sandy, in Trinsic, helps you if you get him a
dragon egg.  Go down the path leading west from Trinsic and go to
the fourth level of the dungeon you reach.  There's lotsa eggs
and good magic items.  I suggest a mass invis spell for this
dungeon.  Sandy tells you to go to the mayor of Trinsic and gives
you a name to tell him.  When you do this, the mayor gives you
his piece of the map.
     On the island north of Moonglow's island, there's a house. 
Go in the house and go to the basement (under piano).  The piece
of the map is in a bag in a chest down there.
     Another piece you can buy from a gypsy to the east of the
Trinsic/Britain road.
     Bring the pieces to Homer and he tells you what to do and
gives you the last piece.  He wants you to bring him back a storm
cloak.  Now you go to the island on the map and dig at the spot
he tells you.  There's a huge dungeon in there.  The treasure's
on the fourth level.

     Now you take the tablet back to Mariah, she translates it,
and yipee, you find out about the gargoyles.  Now before you go
to Gargoyle Land, you need a hot air balloon (remember it from
Ultima IV?).  You need to go to an island east of Serpent's Hold,
where Blackthorn's Palace was in Ultima V.  Use the telekinesis
spell to lower the drawbridge.  When you get in, search for
secret doors.  You need to get the right combo of three levers to
get into the room that takes you to the dungeon.  The dungeon is
pretty easy, BUT SAVE YOUR GAME BEFORE YOU GO DOWN.  There are
one or two places where you can get sent halfway across the globe
if you choose a wrong passage.  There's a stiff on level four
with some plans for a balloon.  You need a kettle from the sewers
under Britain (on lvl 1), rope (from Paws), a basket (from
Minoc), 40 pieces of spider silk (use the cheat) which you take
to Paws to be sewn into thread.  Take the thread to New Magincia
to the girl there who makes it into cloth.  Then take it back to
Paws to some other person, a real snobby bitch who will make the
cloth into a bag.  Then (U)se the plans and you have a balloon.

     To get to gargoyle land, go thru Hythloth (on isle of
avatar).  On level four, talk to Cpt. Johne and he'll teach you
the gargoyle language.  Now go down again and you're in the garg.
world.  You meet this little hoser name Beh Lem or somethin' and
he joins and you all go off to talk to his daddy, who lives to
the north.  Talk to daddy (he tells you that you accidentaly
nuked the gargoyle world when you borrowed the codex in Ultima IV
and now you have to fix things) and then go north, then west till
you hit gargoyle main street.  Find the Draxinosum guy andsurrender to him.  He gives you an amulet to wear.  He tells you
to talk to this wise old gargoyle next.  You go there and the
wise guy sends you to the Hall of Knowledge to read some books
and to get a lense.  You come back and then get sent to find the
lensmaker to fix the lense.  Follow the PATH going east from
behind the garg houses and you'll get to the lensmaker's house
and get the lense fixed.  Then go back to the main street and go
up to north till you get to mountains.  Put down your balloon and
float north to the temple, where you get a quest to go see the
codex.  Be sure to tell the speaking stone there that you seek
the codex for the good of BOTH races.  Make sure you have a good
karma value when you do so (use the cheat).  You have to go to
three gargoyle shrines and purify yourself.  In the shrine of
Diligence, go 2 doors south and 1 door west.  Right after you go
through the west door, there will be secret doors to your north
and south.  Go through one of them (it doesn't matter which) and
you can get to the top of the shrine.  The shrine of Control is
hard because you need to have a complex combo of levers set to
get through a bunch of portculli.  The left SWITCH should be
DOWN, the right SWITCH UP.  Going clockwise from the east side of
the doorway, the levers should be: left, left, left, right,
right, right, left, right, right, left, left, right, left, left,
right.  Now you can get throught the portculli.  The shrine of
Passion is easy, you just have to walk through hot lava.  In each
of these shrines, you learn part of a mantra.  You have to go
back to the temple and tell the stone the completed mantra.  

     Then you go back to Brittannia.  Go to the island where
Moonglow and the Lycaeum are.  There is a human lensmaker living
on this island.  Get him to make you a concave lens (you need a
glass sword for him to melt down).  Next go to the bay that Minoc
is on.  Go all the way to the south, beach your boat, and walk
down till you see a castle.  Go in and talk to the cyclopi.  Papa
gives you a key to their basement after you catch him a fish with
his fishing rod.  You have to go look for a secret door in the
center of the ground floor.  This take you down to a little room
with GUESS WHAT??? MORE LEVERS!!!  Flip the levers and go down
one of the other ladders.  Play around with all the different
ladders until you get to level four.  There are two different
secret doors you need to find on this level and you will end up
finding a codex cube.
     Go to the isle of the avatar and go to the codex building. 
You need to read the codex and set up the lenses as described and
put all the moonstones in the codex cube.  Then put the cube
where the codex tells you and sit back and watch the game take
you through the ending.

               Hope this walk through helped you!
