                        INTERNATIONAL NINJA RABBITS
			---------------------------

               Typed by NEC and supplied by, erm....... NEC!

Having destroyed the local factory, the NINJA RABBIT must now travel abroad
in his continuing quest to rid the worls of pollution.

Following further leakages at more chemical plants, the worlds atmosphere is
now contaminated by the nasty nerve gases.  These gases have caused the 
normally peaceful animals and people to become aggressive, especially toward
our friendly rabbit.

The Ninja Warrior travels to America, Europe and Asia to rid our planet of the
affected creatures, and so make the world a safer place.  From Guardian Angels
and demented Panda's, Italian thugs to street fighting Dogs, the rabbit meets
his toughest opponents yet, and the only chance he has is to make use of his
newly aqquired skills.
To save energy, he has to duck down to avoid flying objects, and he has found
that different enemies, can be overcome more easily if he chooses the correct
form of attack.  One final piece of help in this toughest of missions.  The
Ninja Rabbit can gain mystery bonuses by hitting the packages that float 
down from the sky.  But Beware!!!!!!  Some of them are not helpful!!
