This supplement discusses the additional features found in Quarter-
back 6.01 which are not covered in the Quarterback User's manual.
Many new features have been added to Quarterback, such as:

* Faster compression during backups. In many cases, Quarterback
can compress the data as fast as it can be written to your floppy
disk.

* Support for multiple tapes per backup session. This means that
you can back up the entire contents of very large hard disks onto
several smaller-sized tapes.

* Support for special features of newer, more advanced tape drives.
There is support for hardware-based compression, fast tape
advance, and quick erase features.

* Several new AREXX macros commands, and existing commands
have been extended, giving you greater control over
Quarterback's operation.

* Many new user options have been added, so you can customize
Quarterback even further to your own particular preferences.


But best of all, there is a completely new program -Schedule Pro-
which allows you to set up Quarterback for unattended backup
sessions! Not only can you use Schedule Pro to set up Quarterback
to automatically backup your hard disk at any time, or on any
schedule, but you can use it to automatically start ANY program or
AREXX script at a particular time or on a particular schedule. You
can even use it to automatically display reminders when you need
them.

In addition to the major changes and enhancements discussed on the following 
pages, there are a few minor changes and rearrangements of Quarterback's
commands and operations, as well as a couple of typographical errors in the
manual. Before discussing the new features in detail, mention should be made 
of these changes:

. Some options in the "Backup" and "Restore" requesters which are typically
not changed very often have been moved to sub-requesters. You display these
sub-requesters by clicking on the "More" button in the main requesters.

. The "Page Setup" requester now uses pop-up menu buttons for selecting paper 
sizes. This reduces the clutter in the requester and lets you more quickly see
what paper size is selected.

. Pop-up menus are also now used to select some options in the "Restore" sub-
requester. Again, this makes the display easier to read and understand.

. Two options from the "Tape Control" requester have been moved to a new
requester. The "Auto-retention inserted tapes" and "Rewind after backup or
restore" settings have been moved to a new "Tape Options" requester" which
you bring up by choosing Tape Options from the Options menu .

. By default, Quarterback now looks in a drawer called "Macros" in the same
location as the Quarterback program for AREXX macros. To execute macros
which are in a different location, simply specify a full path name to the
macro.

. On page 13 of the manual it states that to select items you click on them
with the right mouse button. This is incorrect. To select items you click on
them with the left mouse button.

. On page 43 of the manual it states that the name of the auto-execute macro
is "Quarterback Startup" . This is incorrect. The name of the auto-exec macro
is "QB Startup" .

Page 3

 In addition to the start-up options discussed in the user's manual,
Quarterback 6.0 supports the following additional start-up options:

"DumbWindows" or "DW"
Use "simple refresh" (i.e." non-smart refresh) windows. Quarterback 6.0 now
defaults to using smart refresh windows, use this option to disable this 
default.
This option makes window displays slightly slower when dealing with several
overlapping windows, but uses less graphics memory.

"ASL"
Use the "ASL" file requesters for choosing files to open or save. This option
works with Kickstart 2.0 or later" and only if the "asl.library" file is
installed on your Amiga.
Note that since there is no way for Quarterback to add its own
buttons to the ASL requesters, all saves will be done in their default format.

"NoSCSI" or "NS"
Disables all SCSI I/O. When Quarterback starts up, it normally polls all SCSI
devices attached to your computer to see which ones are tape drives. This way
it can automatically select the first tape drive it finds as the default tape
device.
(unless you have saved a preferred setting that overrides this). However, some
older SCSI controllers do not properly handle this initial inquiry stage, and
some older SCSI devices may not properly respond. If Quarterback seems to lock
up when you start it, you can disable this SCSI inquiry, and all other SCSI
I/O by including this start-up option. Most users will never need to use this
option.

"NoAutosense" or "NA"
Disable SCSI autosense commands. The SCSI command set provides for having
devices automatically responding to error conditions, rather than waiting for
the computer to ask them about errors. This is called "Autosense" and
Quarterback uses this feature to speed its SCSI I/O. However, some older SCSI
controllers do not properly handle autosense commands, and may lock up your
Amiga when they are used. If you are experiencing erratic behavior when using
tape drives, you may need to use this start-up option. Most users will never
need to use this option.

Page 4

If you are starting Quarterback from the CLI, you can specify a command
argument to Quarterback. There are several types of command arguments you Can
supply, and Quarterback's start-up behavior differs depending upon the type
of argument you specify:

. If you specify a path name as an argument, Quarterback will prepare to
backup the files in that location, just as if you had selected that location
and clicked on the "Backup" button 

. If you specify a preferences file name as an argument, Quarterback will load
those preferences settings instead of the default settings.

. If you specify an AREXX macro as an argument, Quarterback will begin 
executing that macro instead of the default "QB Startup" macro. Any addi-
tional arguments on the command line will be passed to the macro, and will
not be examined by Quarterback. For example, if you have a macro named
"Backup" in your "Macros" drawer, and you start Quarterback by typing:

Quarterback Backup Work:

Then after Quarterback starts it will immediately begin executing the macro
named "Backup" and pass the parameter "Work:" to the macro.

Page 5

There are several new features available when using Quarterback to back up
your data, such as a new backup mode as well as faster compression.

Backup Type

Quarterback now gives you a choice between a "Complete" or "Selective"
backup.

In a complete backup, Quarterback will read the disk catalog and proceed
immediately to the backup display, bypassing the file selection mode. If you
are backing up all of the files on your disk this will make working with
Quarterback faster and more convenient.

In a selective backup, the file selection display is shown after the disk
catalog has been read. This is the same mode of operation that Quarterback
5.0 used.

Since you need to specify the backup mode before a catalog is read,
Quarterback will now display the "Backup Options" requester immediately
after you click on the "Backup" button (unless you have disabled
the requester display).


Backup Options

Most of the seldom-used options in the "Backup Options" requester have been
moved to a sub-requester. This reduces clutter in the "Backup Options" 
requester, and makes reading the requester easier. To display the "Backup
Options" subrequester. choose Backup Options from the Options menu, and click
on the "More" button. A sub-requester will appear.

Page 6

There are also two new options in this requester: "Backup entire directory 
structure" and "Use device compression". The second option enables tape drive
built-in hardware compression. It is discussed in the section on tape handling

If you turn on the "Backup entire directory structure" check box, Quarterback
will make a backup of the entire directory structure of the disk even if you
are backing up only a few files from the disk. This is generally a safer thing
to do, since you can have the restore operation not restore the entire
directory structure even if you have backed it up. However, if you wish to
disable this feature you can turn this check box off.

Compression

Quarterback's compression routines are now considerably faster than before. 
In most cases this means that Quarterback can read and compress data from your
hard disk just as fast as your machine is capable of writing it to floppy
disks.

Page 7

In addition to the features mentioned in the previous section, there are
a few more options that have been added to Quarterback which apply only to the
restore options. This section describes the new options.

Restore Options

Most of the seldom-used options in the "Restore Options" requester have been
moved to a sub-requester . This reduces clutter in the "Restore Options"
requester, and makes reading the requester easier. To display the "Restore
Options" subrequester, choose Restore Options from the Options menu, and click
on the "More" button. A sub-requester will appear: 

In place of the "Replace existing files" option in Quarterback 5.0 there
are two options.
"Replace earlier versions" and "Replace later versions" . The "Replace earlier
versions" setting controls whether Quarterback will automatically replace
existing files that are older than the one in the backup set. The "Replace
later versions " controls replacing existing files that are newer than the
one in the backup set.
 
Each of these options has a setting of "Yes","No", or "Prompt". Choosing
"Yes" will have replacements always occur, choosing "No" will have them never
occur, and choosing "Prompt" will have Quarterback ask you for each file that
already exists whether or not to replace it. 

Page 8

Several new tape handling features have been added to Quarterback, as well as
support for features in advanced tape drives such as built-in hardware
compression and fast tape advancing.

Multiple Tape Support

You can now automatically back up a disk that is larger than the size of your
tapes. Quarterback will detect when the current tape is full, and prompt you
for another tape. When restoring files, Quarterback will prompt you for the
tapes in the correct order.

Note: Different tape drives report a tape-full condition differently. While we
have tested Quarterback with several different types of tape drives, including
all of the most popular drive types, there may be some less common drives that
have problems with this feature. If you encounter a problem with this feature
please contact our technical support department. Please have information about
the type of tape drive you are using and the size of the tapes you are using
available.

Tape Drive Compression

Some advanced tape drives support built-in compression. Since this compression
is handled by the tape drive hardware, it is much faster than the compression
built into Quarterback.  

If your tape drive supports compression you can use this feature by choosing
Backup Options from the Options menu, clicking on the "More" button, and
then selecting "Use device compression" as the compression type.

Page 9

Tape Control

Several new capabilities have been added to Quarterback"s "Tape Control"
requester. To display this requester, choose Tape Control from the Utilities
menu.  A requester will appear:


Some advanced tape drives support a quick erase mode.  To use this mode when
erasing tapes, turn on the "Quick Erase" check box before clicking on the
"Erase" button.

You can now specify a number of sessions to advance over on a tape (in
Quarterback 5.0, this was called "Spacing" over sessions). To advance past
several backup sessions on a tape, use the up and down arrows next to the
"Advance" button (or use the up and down cursor keys) to specify the number
of sessions to advance past, and click on the "Advance" button.

On tape drives which support it, Quarterback will automatically use a fast
advance mode (also called a "fast search" mode). On these tape drives, this 
can significantly reduce the time spent advancing a tape.

Page 10

This section contains information on additional features
which are new in Quarterback 6.0, as well as information which may help you
when using Quarterback.

Disk Change Notification

You can have Quarterback notify you when you need to change floppy disks,
either by flashing the screen, beeping, or both. To set the notification
method, choose Preferences from the Options menu and under the section "On
disk completion" select the type of notification you wish.

Buffer Memory Type

In the "Buffer Options" requester there is now a "24-bit" option for buffer
memory type. This option will allocate buffer memory only from within the
CPU's 24-bit address space. Choosing "Any" will allocate a buffer from
anywhere in the full 32-bit address space.

Not all SCSI controllers support DMA (direct memory access) to memory 
outside of a 24-bit address space. If you have your buffer memory type set to
"Any" and are experiencing problems with Quarterback, try changing it to
"24-bit".

If you select "24-bit" but do not have any expansion memory in the 24-bit
address space, Quarterback will allocate its buffers from graphics memory.
Depending upon your computer's configuration, this may slow down Quarterback's
operations. 

Note: Quarterback 5.0's "Any" buffer memory type option was in reality a 24-
bit memory type option, since at the time Quarterback 5.0 was developed few
SCSI controllers supported DMA to memory outside of the 24-bit address space.
If you are upgrading from Quarterback 5.0 and have set your default to "Any",
it will be set to "24-bit" in Quarterback 6.0. If your SCSI controller
supports 32-bit memory buffers, you can change it to "Any" 

SCSI Interrogator

The "SCSI Interrogator" requester now shows the media size of the selected
device, if the device reports this information. Most hard drives and some
removeable cartridge drives will report this information, whereas most tape
drives do not (since the drive has no knowledge of how long the tapes are that
you insert).

Page 11

Secondary Catalog

  When backing up to direct-access removeable media (i.e., floppy disks or
removable cartridges), Quarterback automatically writes the file catalog to
both the beginning and end of the backup session. If, when restoring, the
catalog at the beginning is unreadable, Quarterback will ask you to insert the
last disk in the session so it can use the secondary catalog. If for any
reason you wish to force Quarterback to use the secondary catalog, you can do
this by holding down the ALT key when you click on the "Restore" button.

Hardware Issues

  Since SCSI device units can only be in the range of zero through seven, it
may seem odd that Quarterback lets you specify device numbers higher than that
when selecting a tape drive for backup or restore. The reason for this is
because some device drivers use the higher numbers for other purposes, such
as accessing drives attached to a second expansion card, or to access non-SCSI 
devices. For example, the A2090 card from
Commodore uses unit numbers of two through nine for SCSI devices zero through
seven; units one and two are used for the ST-506 ports on the card.

 Quarterback has been designed to work with as many different SCSI 
expansion cards, hard disks, and tape drives as
possible. However, Quarterback can only as good as the device driver software
for the cards installed in your system.  If you discover a problem with your
particular configuration, please contact the manufacturer of your expansion
card first; often times they have a new updated device driver that will
correct the problem.  

  In particular , because of problems in Commodores's device driver software
for the A2090 and A2090a cards, Quarterback may not support all tape backup
units when connected to the SCSI port on these cards.
We recommend you replace your card with a newer one, such as the A2091.

Page 12

Several enhancements have been made to Quarterback's macro system and
AREXX commands. These enhancements provide both greater control over
Quarterback's internal operations, as well as more user conveniences in using
macros.

Selecting Macros

In the "Other Macro" requester there is a new "?" button next to the macro
name text box. Clicking on this button will display Quarterback's "Open File"
requester which you can use to find the macro you wish to execute. When you
find the macro and click on the "Open" button" the full macro path name will
be automatically entered into the macro name text box. You can then specify a
parameter for the macro, and click on the "Execute" button to execute this
macro.

New AREXX Commands

There are several new AREXX commands supported in Quarterback 6.0, as well as
some additional features added to existing commands. In the following command
descriptions, an item in parentheses () indicates an optional text string, an
item in brackets [] indicates an optional keyword. If several keywords are in
brackets separated by a vertical bar [|] then only one keyword in the list is
allowed.

Supplied Macros

On the Quarterback disk are some sample macros, If you are new to AREXX,you
might wish to study these examples to see how you can use Quarterback's macro
commands and AREXX to accomplish complex tasks. These macros are also useful
for automating Quarterback with the Schedule Pro program, which is described
later in this supplement. A brief description of the included macros is as
follows:

Backup (disk name)
This macro performs a backup of disk name specified as its argument, and then
quits from Quarterback. If no disk name is supplied, then it will prompt you
for the name of the disk to backup. Not only does this macro give you an
example of how to use macro arguments, but it can be used with the Schedule
Pro program included with Quarterback to perform scheduled backups. For
example, if you set up Schedule Pro to run Quarterback and supply the command
line argument of:

  Backup Work:

Then when Quarterback is started it will automatically back up the drive named
"Work:" and then quit. See the section on Schedule Pro for more information on
scheduling Quarterback or other programs to automatically run.

Mutiple Backups
This macro allows you to set up and automatically perform several backups in
one step. You can use this macro as a fairly sophisticated example of how to
control Quarterback through AREXX. For example, you could use the
"SetBackupOptions" command to automatically set the backup options and bypass
the "Backup Options" requester entirely. You could even modify the macro to
automatically start Quarterback, perform one or more backups, and quit. 

Page 15

Schedule Pro
------------

Schedule Pro is a brand new addition to Quarterback which allows you to have
Quarterback perform automatic backups, either one-time or on a regular
schedule, But Schedule Pro goes far beyond that. Not only does it work with
Quarterback, but you can use it to automatically execute any AmigaDOS program,
or even ARExx macro programs, at the times you specify. You can even use it to
display reminders on your screen! 

Schedule Pro requires AmigaDOS 2.0 or later.
If you are using Amigados 1.3 or earlier on your computer you will need to
upgrade your system. See your Amiga dealer for information on upgrading.

Using Schedule Pro

Schedule Pro has two modes of operation: A window display mode where you can
create new and change events, and an icon-only mode where it is waiting to
execute scheduled events. When running in its icon-only mode, Schedule Pro
uses very little of your processor's time. 

. Double-click on the Schedule Pro program icon.
Schedule Pro will start up, display its main window, add its "Application
Icon", or "AppIcon" , to the Workbench screen, and add its name to the
Workbench's "Tools" menu. 

. To switch from the window display mode to the
icon-only mode, click in the window's close box. The Schedule Pro window will
be removed and only its AppIcon will remain. 

. To switch from the icon-only mode
to the window display mode, either double-click on the Schedule Pro AppIcon or
choose it from the "Tools" menu. Do not double-click on the program icon a
second time, as this will load and run a second copy of Schedule Pro. 

. To have Schedule Pro always start up in the icon-only mode, add the tooltype 
"NoWindow" (or simply "NW") to Schedule Pro. 

. To quit Schedule Pro and remove it from memory,
click on the "Quit" button in the main window.  No scheduled events will
be executed until the next time you start Schedule Pro. 

Page 16

IMPORTANT:   To be most useful,
Schedule Pro should be left running on your computer at all times. You can
easily do this by putting it into your "WBStartup" drawer. That way it will
always be started whenever you start up your Amiga. If you do this, you will
need to add the tooltype "DoNotWait" to Schedule Pro; otherwise Workbench will
wait for Schedule Pro to quit before proceeding with its startup. You should
also add the "NoWindow" tooltype discussed above to keep Schedule Pro from
displaying its window when your computer is started. 

Schedule Pro's main window
displays all of the events that you have created.

The buttons in this window let you create and schedule new events, change
existing events, and delete events. 

. To create new events, click on the "New"
button. The event creator/editor requester will appear.  

. To change an existing
event, click on the event name and then click on the "Change" button,
or simply double-click on the event name. 

. To delete an existing event, click on the event name
and then click on the "Delete" button. You will be asked if this is what
you really wish to do. Click on the "Yes" button to delete the event.

Page 17

Creating and Changing Events

When you create new events or change existing events, Schedule Pro will
display the event editor, where you specify the event name, type,
and schedule:

Before you specify when an event is to occur, you should first specify its
name and type. You use the items in the upper portion of the requester to 
do this.

. To name the event you are creating, type a name in the "Schedule" text box. This
This name will be displayed in Schedule Pro's main list of events.  

. To set the type of event,
choose either "Program" or "Reminder" from the event type pop-up
menu. A "Program" event will run a specified program, either an AmigaDOS
program or an AREXX program. A "Reminder" event will display a reminder on
your screen at the specified time.  

. If this is a program event, type the location
and name of the program in the "Program" text box. There must be a full path
name to the program in order for Schedule Pro to find it. You can click on the
"?'" button and use the standard "Open" requester to locate the program. If
you do this, Schedule Pro will automatically enter the full path name to the
program you have located.  

. For program events, you can also enter program
arguments in the "Arguments" text box. These items will be passed to the
program when it starts up, they are equivalent to the command line arguments
you would give a program when you start it from the CLI.

Page 18

. If this is a reminder event,
type the information you wish to appear as your reminder in the
"Reminder" text box.

. If you wish to simply create a new event but not have it
active yet, select the "Inactive" option. Normally you will just leave the
"Active" option set. 

Once you have set the event name and type, you need to
specify the schedule for when the event should occur. You use the items in the
lower portion of the requester to do this. Schedule Pro defaults to having the
current date set for the schedule, you can alter this if you need to have it
occur at a different time, or if you want to set it up as a repeating event. 

. Click on the month or months in which you want this event to occur. Click
once on the month name to select it, click on it again to de-select it.  

. If you want the event to occur
every month, turn on the "Monthly" check box. 

. Click on the day or days in which
you want this event to occur. Click once on the day
number to select it, click on it again to de-select it.  

. To have the event occur
on the same day every week, click on the day name above the list of days.
You can select more than one day of the week for an event.

. If you want the event to occur on a particular week in the
month, click on the  "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "4th"
or "Last" buttons to select which week in which
you want this event to occur. You can select more than one week of the month
for an event. 

. To have the day you select for the event be relative to the end
of the month, turn on the "From End of Month" check box. For example, if you
want to have the event occur on the last day of every month regardless of how
many days are in that month, click on the last day displayed and turn on this
check box. 

. If you want the event to occur every day, turn on the "Daily" check box.

. In the "Year" text box, either type the year in which you want this event to
occur, or use the up and down arrow buttons to specify a year.  

. If you want the
event to occur every year, turn on the "Yearly" check box.  

. In the "Time" text box,
either type the time in which you want this event to occur, or use the up
and down arrow buttons to specify a time. 

. If you want the event to occur every
hour, turn on the "Hourly" check box.  

Once you have specified all the
information for the event, you must save it in order for it to be added to the
list of scheduled events.

. Click on the "Save" button. The event will be saved
and you Will be returned to Schedule Pro's main window.  

Schedule Pro saves its events
in a file called "Schedule Pro Events" located in the "s:" directory.
Normally this file is not visible to Workbench users. CLl users should be
careful not to delete this file, because if you do then you will have deleted
all of your events!  

After a non-recurring event has been executed, it will
remain in the event list in an "inactive" state. Inactive events are displayed
in italic type. At this point you can either delete the event or reschedule
it for a later time.  

. Click on the event in the event list and then click on the
"Change" button, or simply double-click on the event. The event editor will
appear with the selected event's information.  

. To activate an event, click on
the "Active" option button. If this was a one time event that has already been
executed, you will need to specify a new date and/or time for the event.

. To inactivate an event, click on the "Inactive" option button. An inactive
event will not be executed, but its information will be kept in the event
list for your future use. 

Examples

Here are two examples of how you can use Schedule Pro . One
example shows how you can use it to perform automatic backups of your hard
disk, and the other shows how to set up a simple birthday reminder. 

If you have installed Quarterback
and the sample AREXX macros that come with it, then
there is an AREXX macro program named "Backup" in Quarterback's "Macros"
drawer. If you wanted to set up Schedule Pro to use this macro to back up the
"Work:" partition of your hard disk to a tape drive every Friday at 9:00 pm,
follow these steps:

. Make sure Quarterback's settings are set for backing up to your tape drive,
and save these as your default settings. 

. Run Schedule Pro and click on the "New" button to create a new event.

. Type a name for this event--for example, "Backup Work Partition".

. Click on the "?" button and use the open requester to find
Quarterback. Click on "Open" once you have found Quarterback on your hard disk
The full path name to Quarterback will be placed in the "Program" text box.

. Type "Backup Work:" in the "Arguments" text box. This will make 
Quarterback execute the AREXX macro "Backup" and pass it the AREXX parameter
"Work:" when Quarterback is started.  

. Click on the "F" button in the "Day" display to
have it execute every Friday. 

. Click on the "Monthly" and "Yearly" check boxes
to turn them on. 

. Enter the time of "21:00" (which is 9:00 PM, when written
in 24-hour time) in the time text boxes. 

. Click on the "Save" button to save the event.

Your automatic backup is now scheduled and will occur on every Friday at
9:00 PM . Make sure you have your computer turned on at that time, and that
Schedule Pro is running.


Lets say you have a friend whose birthday is on June 22 and you want Schedule
Pro to remind you of it. To have Schedule Pro display a birthday reminder on
your screen at 9:00 AM every June 22, follow these steps:

. Run Schedule Pro and click on the "New"' button to create a new event.

. Type a name for this event--for example "Lorelei"s Birthday".  

. Choose "Reminder" from the pop-up menu.

. Type the text of the 
reminder in the "Reminder" text box--for example, "Call Lorelei and wish her
a happy birthday".  

. Click on the "Jun" button turn it on (and click on the
buttons for any other months that are selected to turn them off).

. Click on the "22" date in
the day list (and click on the buttons for any other days that are
selected to turn them off).  

. Click on the "Yearly" check box to turn it on. 

. Enter the time of "9:00" in the time text boxes.  

. Click on "Save" to save the reminder.

Schedule Pro will now remind you about the birthday at 9:00 AM on
every June 22. As before, your computer must be turned on and Schedule Pro
must be running for it to give you this reminder. 

These are only two of the
many possible uses there are for Schedule Pro.
