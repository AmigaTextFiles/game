   I JUST LOOKED AT THE ROBOCOP 3 RELEASE FROM FAIRLIGHT,BECAUSE I
   THOUGHT ABOUT TRAINING IT.BUT I DONT LIKE THE GAME AND THERE'S
   NOT MUCH TO TRAIN IN IT,SO SIMPLY USE THIS BUILT IN CHEAT:

     PRESS 'P' TO GO INTO PAUSE MODE! HERE HOLD DOWN THE *RIGHT*
     SHIFT KEY AND TYPE 'THE DIDY MEN' . RELEASE THE SHIFT KEY AND
     PRESS THE 'P' KEY AGAIN TO LEAVE THE PAUSE MODE.
     YOU SHOULD HAVE UNLIMITED ENERGY NOW. ENJOY THE GAME,I DONT! :)


                                Toxic!/Hoodlum  (SOON TRAINING AGAIN!)


   PS: IT'S THE SAME CHEAT AS IN THE OLD VERSION I THINK! :)
  PPS: REMEMBER THAT THE ENERGY WILL BE STILL SUBSTRACTED,BUT YOU
       ARE NOT DEAD WHEN IT REACHES 0 !
