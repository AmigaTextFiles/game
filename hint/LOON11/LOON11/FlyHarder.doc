                        FLY HARDER CD32 Typed By Wizz

  THE STORY
 
 The  interstellar  space  ship  Irata is on its way towards the planet Zarkow,
 where they are to replenish their water and food supplies.  Settlers are taken
 on  board  who give information that the Targoid insect people, have installed
 powerful reactors in the cavern system of the planet.  These reactors will use
 up  the  entire energy supplies and raw materials of the planet.  The Targoids
 invented  an  intricate  security  system which makes it almost impossible for
 strangers  to  enter.   Captain  Nokdar  of  the  Irata decides to atttack the
 reactors.   For  this  he  sends  a  special  force of 5 of his best pilots to
 disable  the  reactors.  Their job is to find the energy spheres in the cavern
 and  drop  them on the reactors.  This overheats the reactors, destroying them
 at the same time.
 
  STARTING THE PROGRAM

  AMIGA CD32
 
 Put  the  "Fly  Harder"  CD  into  your  CD32  drive.   The  program will load
 automatically.  Act according to the instructions on the screen.
 
  AIM OF THE GAME
 
 Your  task is to collect all energy spheres and drop them on the reactors.  To
 do so you have to fly quite close to a sphere, this is collected automatically
 and  follows  your  space ship.  You must fly close to the reactor so that the
 sphere  touches  it.   After  having  dropped  all spheres within a level on a
 reactor,  you  will then progress to the next level.  This isn't as easy as it
 seems,  as  some  aggressive  Targoids are after you.  On some levels, though,
 you'll  find "fuel pods" and "energy-pods" that help you to fulfill your task.
 The  Targoid's security system consists mainly of laser barriers that you have
 to  switch  on  or  off  to  pass  unhindered.  This you do by operating small
 switches  that  are  hidden  on  the  level.   Some switches are only there to
 irritate you, e.g.  they can change the gravity, etc.
