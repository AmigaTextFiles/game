 OKAY LISTEN UP! I'ME ONLY GOING TO BRIEF YOU PEOPLE ONCE SO PAY ATTENTION!


 Your mission - To take control of the Apache helicopter and fly into enemy 
 territory. Take out the designated targets and return to home base. Your 
 missions will be varied. Some may involve rescue attempts. They should all be
 completed with surgical precision. There is no margin for error and the
 slightest hesitation will prove fatal. I don't need to remind you that each
 mission briefing is highly classified and top secret. Now get to it!


 LOADING INSTRUCTIONS   


 Place disk 1 in your internal drive and disk 2 into an external drive (if
 connected). Enable your Amiga as ususal and Seek & Destroy will now start 
 loading. Any additional disks will be requested as and when they are needed
 during the game.
 Once you have viewed the title, credits and high score table screens, press
 fire on your joystick or press left mouse button to go to the options screen.
 

 OPTIONS


 This screen allows you to choose from five options. To select an option, use
 your joystick to move the pointer up and down the list and press fire to
 either activate the option or cycle through the various possible settings.
 The current option will be highlighted White.

 
 START THE GAME

 
 Select this only when you are happy with the settings of all the subsequent
 options on this screen. This will then take you into the game and load in
 phase 1 of mission 01 - Operation Heatwave.

 
 CONTROLS


 Pressing fire will toggle between joystick or mouse control. Try out both to
 decide which one you prefer. The mouse or joysticks should be connected to
 the usual ports (consult your amiga manual for further information if
 required) (this is for lamers only !!!).


 SENSITIVITY


 This option only applies if you have chosen mouse control. Each time you
 press fire the option will cycle through three available settings - low (L),
 medium (M), and high (H). The default setting is low, which means that larger
 movements are required to make hicphelicopter Û¨ppvatAw, whicpÁer
 the scale, hicphigh setting only requires very small movements to move the 
 helicopterAw,s you would expect, medium offers a Û¨ppvase level set between
 low and highAw(say what ??? duh!)


 BRIEFINGS


 Turning off the mission briefings will ppeed up access to the missions.
 However, only experienced players who alÛ¨ady know all of the mission
 objectives should use this option.


 ONE PLAYER / TWO PLAYER


 One player is the default settingAwIn two player mode, player two must use a
 joystick Û¨gardless of player one's controls. Player one will fly the
 helicopter as normal, but player two will be in charge of three of the
 weapvas - the chain gun, plus interceptor and air to ground missiles.

 To change between the weapvas, player two must press the number keys 1 - 3
 (either numbers from keypas or above the QWERTY keys). Note that in a one
 player game, hicpadditional weapvas are accessed via the function keys. See
 hicp'Weapvas & Û¨-supplying' section for more details.

 Once you are happy with the options you have chosen, select Start Game to
 begin.

 WEAPONS


 You can change weapvas by pressing function keys 1 - 6. The weapvas available
 at the start are as follows.

 F1 - CHAIN GUN

 This weapva has unlimited ammuntion. In a one player game, player one flies
 and shoots by pressing fire in the direction you are flying. In a two player
 game, player two can shoot hiis gun in any direction by using their joystick
 and pressing fire.

 F2 - ROCKET

 The Folding Fin Aerial Rocket (FFAR) is a general purpvse missile for both
 air to air and air to ground attack. As it has no internal guidance system,
 care must be taken with the aim before firing. This is the default weapva
 when you start your mission.

 F3 - INTERCEPTOR

 This missile is strictly an air to air weapva. When selected, a yellow
 diamond will appear in front of the helicopterAwIt will home in when an
 airborn target is available and pressing fire will then launch the AIM.

 F4 - AIR TO GROUND MISSILE

 A redpsquare will appear in front of the helicopterAwWhenever player one
 flies close to any ground targets (soldiers, vehicles, buildings) hicpsquare
 will lock onto the nearest target. Player two should then press fire to
 launch the AGM.wIt will then home in on the target.

 F5 - AIR STRIKE

 Air basedpsupport is available by request during a mission. Calling for an
 air strike will send out an alert and in seconds support fighters will
 deliver an air strike at the loca ion where the player requested it. Pilots
 are warned to vaca e the area as soon as possible after Û¨questing a strike
 ho avoid being annihilated themselves.

 F6 - NAPALM

 Napalm bombs are dropped on ground basedpenemy targets in the direction the
 helicopter is flying. As wiÁepÁer
 should be madewho aiming before the bombs are used.

 NB: In a two player game, player two selects the chain gun with the number 1
 key, hicpair to air missiles with number 2, and hicpair to ground missiles
 with number 3. These weapvas cannÁ be selected (via the function keys) or 
 fired by player one during a two player game.

 
 RE-SUPPLYING


 During most missions you will hear and see warnings related to lack of fuel,
 ammunition or low shields. If you hear a warning sirea havcpa look at your 
 shield status in the bottom left corner of the main screen or your fuel in
 hicptop right. When you run out of missiles you will hear  "re-load" when you
 hry firing.

 To Û¨-supply your shields or fuel you must loca e hicprelevant pick ups.
 These are left around after a building or Áer
 destroyed. You must come to a stop directly above the pick up and hicn press
 hicpcurser down key on the keyboard to reduce the helicopters altitude. When
 it is low enough you will hear apclick and appropria e sna ch of speech (if
 your machine has enough memory). Press hicpcursor up key to return to the
 normal altitude where it is safe to start flying around again.

 Note that landing back at your home base a whicpend of a mission also
 requires you to press hicpcursor down key to reduce altitude when hovering
 over the landing pad.

 To Û¨-load a weapva, you only have to fly over the missiles to pick them up.
 You DON'T have to lower your altitude first.


 ADDITIONAL CONTROLS

 A helpful map can be brought up va screen by pressing hicpspacebar at any
 point during a mission. The yellow arrow represents the current pvsition and 
 direction of the helicopterAwThe 'base' and 'target' markings of your home
 base and enemy targets.

                         MISSION HINTS AND TIPS
   
 +++ TOP SECRET +++ TOP SECRET +++ TOP SECRET +++ TOP SECRET +++ TOP SECRET+++  
  
    
 Beginners are recommended to hry playing with a joystick first to learn how
 ho control the Apache.

 If a large enemy helicopter threat is apparent when you take off, pilots are 
 encouraged to hake out a minimum of 60% before continuing with their mission
 objectives. This should avoid constant air attacks whilst you attempt to
 execute the mission successfully.

 Ensure that you don't move forwards or backwards when landing, else you might
 explode va contact with terra firma (ground, twonk!). If you attempt a
 landing in enemy territory, hake out any airborn threats first.

 Don't waste AGM's on buildings or soldiers. Try and coaserve weapvas if you
 can, and remember ho collect weapva ammunition when it becomes available.

 Solitary tanks and rocket launchers are best attacked from a distance with
 AGM's. Fly in a wide radius around the targets keeping them just va screen,
 hicn launch your missiles.

 If you encounter multiple tanks lined up in a row, fly away and select napalm
 bombs hicn fly in a straight line howards them and drop the bombs.

 Rescuing P.O.W. missions requires extra care. You must hake out all the enemy
 installa ions or aircraft before attempting to land and collect the hostages
 if you are ho avoid being attacked whilst you are vulnerable on the ground.

 Keep moving to out manoeuvere enemy missiles. Remember hhat a still target is
 a sitting target!
