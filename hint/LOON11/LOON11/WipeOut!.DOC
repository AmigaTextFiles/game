WHAT IS "WIPEOUT!" ?

	Briefly: The Ultimate non-commercial shoot'em up :-)
	
	Well, Wipe-Out! is the first game I've ever got finished. That
	statement of course exludes numerous lame examples done by me
	with programs like "Game Maker" or "S.E.U.C.K" during the past
	10 years (on both Amiga and C=64, the only TRUE computers ever).

	Wipe-Out! is of course 100% optimized METAL BANGING assembly.
	(AMOS is for lamers ... C is too slow (and messy) ... ) 

	My aim with this project was mainly to prove my capabilities
	as a game graphics artist. (Check out the Giger-inspired 4th
	level ... )
	

REQUIREMENTS:

	-512Kb Chip RAM (Minimum, of course! More RAM won't hurt!)
	-Kickstart 1.2 or later (2.0+ recommended on 68030+ CPUs)
	-PAL capable machine (and monitor!). Note: you don't need
	 to switch to PAL with some magic utility, WipeOut! does
	 that itself (and returns the old display on exit).
	-Joystick

	
CREDITS:

	Take a look at the scroller! Briefly; all programming, graphics,
	design and SFX by me, Tero Lehtonen alias Teeme of Fist! ultd.

	The following software was used one way or another and must
	therefore be credited:

	 -DeLuxePaint 3			 -PixMate 1.0
	 -IFF-Master v1.0		 -ProTracker v2.3b
	 -AudioMaster II		 -A68k v2.71 + Blink v6.7
	 -CygnusED v2

	And  my lovely hardware setup looks like this (again I want
	to send my best regards to the manufacturers!):

	 -B2000 (KS 2.04 / WB 2.1, 1Mb CHIP, 2Mb FAST)
	 -SupraTurbo28 (68000 speeding at 28MHz, I LOVE it)
	 -Supra WordSync + 105Mb Quantum ProDrive (850Kb/sec!!!)
	 -External 3.5" floppy drive	

	I want to especially thank the big C= for the most exciting and
	revolutionary machines on the face of the earth! THANK YOU!
	And PLEASE gimme the RISC-based AAA-Amiga!!! :-)


HISTORY:

	Longer than you'd believe... I planned to release WO at the
	Party III in Herning, Denmark at X-mas '93, but failed...

	I can just tell I've been *VERY* lazy with this project...

	I have also been slowed down by my stupid decision of using
	SEKA assembler in the beginning (SEKA really SUCKS!!!). It
	was quite a mess to change to a68k later.

	And then there have been the interfering studies....
	

INSTALLING:

	The game can be installed on a hard disk by just copying the file
	"Wipe-Out!" to a directory of your choice. If you want to get your
	high scores saved, copy the file "WO-HiScores" to the same directory
	and make sure that directory is the CURRENT DIRECTORY when starting
	the game.

	If you play from a floppy I recommend you to pack WipeOut! with
	a good cruncher like Powerpacker or TurboImploder. That way the
	loading time will be greatly reduced. On the other hand, more
	free RAM is required.

	Wipe-Out! can be launched from CLI, Shell or WorkBench. It takes
	over the machine, but it's also supposed to return everything
	back to normal after exit. Disk accessing is naturally via the
	OS, works on any storage system (theoretically!), takes care of
	write protection etc and doesn't f*** up the disk structure.


PLAYING:

	Simple: shoot everything that moves!

	Complex: Use joystick in the port #2. Use fire to fire (:->) and
	to enter the game from the intro. Pushing the stick will accelerate
	the ship and pulling will slow it down (logical, eh?). Turning the
	stick to left/right will rotate the ship around its Z-axis. 

	Right mouse button will freeze all action (as long as it's pressed)
	and left one will exit to WB/CLI. At this point the game will try
	to save the high scores.

	Short description of the game display:

	|        PLAY   AREA          |
	|_____________________________|

	 ______________________________
	|         |  2.               |		1. RADAR 
	|  1.     |___________________|
	|         |  3.               |		2. SCORES

	| 4.                          |		4. COMMENTS
	|_____________________________|


	RADAR shows the enemies around you and is therefore very useful
	in order to find them. But don't trust it too much! SCORES show
	your current score and the highest score in the Hall of Fame.

	SLD means your protection shield. It will be weakened by hits
	and collisions with the enemies. Shooting will also temporarily
	weaken the shield. SPD shows your current speed.

	In the COMMENTS box different messages will be shown upon your
	actions. 


PROBLEMS:

	-Due to the direct access of display (and other) hardware, there
	 may be all sort of weird problems with some external hardware,
	 especially 3rd party video cards.

	-Problems may arise with the next generation (post-AGA) chipsets
	 for the previously mentioned reason.

	-If WipeOut! doesn't get what it wants it will simply return
	 under the OS control without any sort of error messages (I was
	 too lazy to write requesters or something!). These things include
	 for example ALL 4 sound channels (they are allocated through the
	 Audio.device), version 1.2 or better of system libraries,
	 successful installing of input-event handler etc, etc.

	 An easy way to get WipeOut! to fail (not to start) is to keep
	 any sort of well written music player (like DeliTracker) active at
	 the background.

	-WipeOut! runs with all interrupts DISABLED (this also means no
	 multitasking!), which will almost certainly cause problems if
	 you are transferring data through the serial port (i.e using
	 a modem).

	-If you are using 68030 or better CPU under pre-2.0 versions of
	 the OS strange things may happen. 

	-I haven't tested WipeOut! on 680x0 machines nor under 3.0 so
	 strange things may happen in any case ...

	-Also note the 3 second pause after starting the game; that delay
	 is required to let the disk drive motors to stop running (when
	 playing from floppies).

	-If your Amiga supports PAL (all ECS/AGA machines), but your
	 display device (TV/Monitor) does not, problems WILL occur;
	 WipeOut! will force a PAL display, but you won't see it...
	 I can't tell exactly what you'll see, probably a blank
	 screen... anyway, that won't crash your system (software
	 wise, that is). On the other hand, your monitor/TV may blow
	 up ... :-)


FURTHER INFORMATION:

	The game has been quite intensively tested on an A500 (512Kb
	Chip + 512Kb Fake Fast, KS1.2, OCS, PAL) and a B2000 (1Mb Chip
	+ 2Mb Fast, KS1.3/KS2.04, Fat Agnus, 28MHz 68000, Supra SCSI HD).
	But I guarantee it still contains swarms of bugs... :-)

	For all programmers (coders :->) I want to tell that WipeOut!...

	 - runs WITHOUT INTERRUPTS!
	 - features *16* coloured parallax-scrolling on standard OCS
	 - has system friendly disk accessing, keyboard reading and
	   hardware allocation
	 - doesn't require ANY additional fonts, libraries etc
	 - fits in 350Kb without any sort of packing!

	All source codes are also available for US$20, FIM100 or an equal
	sum in your country's currency (only cash). For that money (and an
	empty disk!) you'll also get all the used gfx, sound, include-files
	etc.

	Oh, my addy... please, prefer e-mail whenever possible!

	probably be writing a new (MUCH better) game!)
