* FORMATTING TEXT
 Formatting Text Characters

 The "Font Format" requester ( Font command, Format
 menu) is used to change the appearance of selected
 text or any new text you are about to type.

 You can change the appearance of your text by:
    ° Using a different font (design of character)
    ° Using a different size
    ° Applying a text style to the character
      (italic, bold, underline)
    ° Using a different colour
    ° Applying typographic functions (such as
      kerning and tracking)

 Kerning makes certain pairs of characters overlap
 to give a narrower appearance, but slows down the
 screen speed slightly.

 Tracking is used to increase or decrease the
 amount of space between characters.

 The  RULER TOOLS  and the  MENUS  can both be
 used to change the style, size and font itself.

 The "Print Method" ( PRINT SETUP  command,
 Project menu) will determine which fonts you can
 use in your document.
 
 
 IMPORTANT
 In the Font pop-up gadgets, you will notice several
 MathsRoman fonts. These fonts contain maths symbols
 which can be used for writing equations, for example.
 
 These fonts cannot be deleted from the list as they
 are stored within hidden files.

   ° Bold Text        [B] - Embolden text to make
                            it appear thicker

   ° Italic Text      [I] - Italicise text so that
                            it slants to the right

   ° Underlined Text  [U] - Underline text.

   ° Superscript Text     - Place text above base
                            line of text.

                            line of text.

 Formatting The Document

 The Document command (Format menu) sets the page
 size (for example, A4, US Letter), margins,
 number of columns and if you wish to spread
 objects over pages ("Double Page Spread").

 The Landscape option is used to rotate the page
 anticlockwise so that a page can be printed on
 its side (like a banner). This option is only
 available in the Normal "Print Method" ("Print
 Setup", Project menu).

 The left, right, top and bottom margins for the
 entire document can be set from this requester.
 If you select facing pages, the margins are
 mirrored onto left pages. For example, the left
 margin becomes the right margin and the right
 becomes the left margin on left (even) pages.

 The number of columns used in the entire document
 is specified from this requester, along with the
 gap between each column.

 If you wish to have a page with a different
 number of columns, you will need to
  CREATE A TEXT FRAME  and specify the number
 of columns for that frame.

 Click the Options button to display a requester
 from which you can turn on or off headers and
 footers and set the header and footer margins.

 The page numbering style, date and time formats
 can also be set from this Options requester.

  PAGE BREAKS ,  PAGE NUMBERS ,  DATES ,
 and  TIMES  can be inserted using Insert
 (Edit menu).

 Auto is the method you should use with Agfa
 Compugraphic Fonts. With Internal Printer Fonts,

 The "Line Spacing" options let you switch between
 Single, Double and 1½ line spaces between each
 line. This is commonly used for educational or
 legal documents.

 Indenting changes the width and horizontal
 position of a paragraph relative to the left and
 right page margins. You can indent the first line,
