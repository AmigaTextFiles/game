                           Welcome to SPACE-TAXI
                           ---------------------
                                Version 2.0

             SpaceTaxi is Freeware. Play it and spread it.

             This  is  a  clone from the old game on the C64.
             There  can be up to three players simultaneously
             or  six players after another.  You must pick up
             those tiny men and bring them to another pad.


                               Installation
                               ------------
             First you have to copy the fonts into the FONTS:
             Directory.

              1> copy FROM SpaceTaxi2/Fonts/#? TO Fonts: all

             Also  the  'diskfont.library'  is  needed in the
             LIBS:.   The  game  should  run  on  all Amigas.
             There  is  an OptionWindow to switch between PAL
             and NTSC.

                                  Scores
                                  ------
             After  a passenger has enterd your taxi, a clock
             starts   to  count  down.   When  the  passenger
             arrives,  you  get  the  remaining  points or at
             least 10 points.  If you complete a level before
             the bonus-time has run out, you'll get 10 points
             for  every remaining second.  After you made all
             levels  of one skillgroup, you'll get 100 points
             for every remaining taxi.  Crashes will cost you
             points.   At  first  100,  then  50  and then 25
             points for each.


                                  Keys
                                  ----

             Keys in the titlescreen:

                    F2 - teammode or singlemode

                 SPACE - start game
                   F9  - option-window
                   ESC - end game
                   F10 - clear hiscoretables

             InGame keys:

                     P - pause game


                            Technical Details
                            -----------------
             Tested  on  A2000  and A1200, should also run on
             all  others.   Multitasking is switched off only
             temporary  while  on  gamescreen.   The music is
             replayed  by  a  routine  from  Teijo Kinnunen's
             great MED3.2.

             If     you     have     problems    with    your
             harddisk-controller,  then  you  should  try  to
             start   the   game   by  clicking  on  the  icon
             "SpaceTaxi_from_ram".  This script will copy all
             data into ram:  and after the program ended will
             copy  back  the hiscore and pref-files.  But you
             may need 2 MB ram for that.


                              OptionsWindow
                              -------------
             If  you  press  F9 in the titlescreen, an option
             window  appears.  Here you can make your choices
             via mouse or keyboard:

          -Music on/off
            : turns on/off titlemusic and jingles between levels

          -SFX on/off/music
            : if switched to 'music' a med-module will be played
            : in game. Use your own modules by copying them
            : into data/meds/ and renaming them to 'med.0' to 'med.4'

          -Intro on/off
            : if you turn it off, the intro won't come
            : up the next time you run the game

          -Anim Speed slow/fast
            : 'fast' means faster fade in and out
            : and faster passenger-animations

          -Thrustsound on/off

          -Path to SpeechSamples
            : here you can specify a path to a different sampleset

          -Display NTSC/PAL
            : NTSC 236 rasterlines overscan or Pal 256 lines

          -4PlayerAdapter on/off
            : turn it off if a printer is connected or some
            : minor errors in the joystick-routines may occur

          -Load from HD/Disk/Ram
            : if switched to disk, the program will wait
            : after loading to let the diskdrive turn off
            : ram means, that datas are loaded from ram:
            :  the "SpaceTaxi_from_ram"-script uses this option

          -Speed slow/medium/fast
            : the joystick-sensibility

          -Port1,Port0,Keyboard
            : if you choose keyboard you also can use
            : a joystick plugged into a 4PlayerAdapter
            : port0 is the mouseport

          -AutoGear on/off
            : if on, the landing-gears are drawn in
            : automatically after lift-off

             If  you  leave the window via the 'save'-Gadget,
             the settings are written to the file 'data/pref'
             and will be loaded the next time.


                           Your Own SampleSet
                           ------------------
             If you have an audiosampler, you can sample your
             own  set  of  speech-samples.   Put your samples
             into  a new directory as IFF-8SVX samples.  Then
             specify the path in the options-window.  Now you
             should  hear  your own samples.  You'll need the
             following ten sample-files:

                        1.8svx       6.8svx
                        2.8svx       heytaxi.8svx
                        3.8svx       pad.8svx
                        4.8svx       please.8svx
                        5.8svx       thankyou.8svx

             Send  me  your  own creations (uuencodet E-mail)
             and  I  will  add  them  to  the next version of
             SpaceTaxi.
