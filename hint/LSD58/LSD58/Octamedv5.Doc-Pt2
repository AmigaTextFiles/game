Part Two.


MIDI gadgets  (see the MIDI Menu and MIDI Commands)
---------------------------------------------------

Before  using  a MIDI instrument, you need to set the functions in this part
of the window to the required values.  They are:

MIDICh
This slider sets the MIDI channel for the instrument (0 - 16).  For example,
setting  it to 5 means this instrument's notes are sent through MIDI channel
5.

Preset
Sets the preset number of the instrument (max. 128 or 2800).

With  this  set to zero, OctaMED uses your keyboard's default preset for the
instrument's MIDI channel (see above).  But by giving this gadget a non-zero
value, you may use more than one preset on the same channel: OctaMED sends a
program change message whenever a note is played.

If  you want to send a preset change command without playing a note, use the
C00 command with any note played by the instrument with the new preset.

Suppress NoteOff
Suppresses  Note  Off messages for the current instrument.  Some devices may
have some instruments (e.g.  one-shot drum sounds) which actually ignore the
Note  Off  messages.    When this is selected, Note Offs aren't sent for the
current  instrument,  reducing  unnecessary  output  (and therefore slightly
faster).

Extended Preset
When  off,  the  maximum  value of the Preset gadget is 128, but when on the
maximum  is  increased to 2800.  However, this can only be used on some MIDI
devices which support the exact method of sending the preset:

* Presets 1 - 100 are sent in the normal manner.

* Presets  above 100 are sent by first sending the "hundreds" part and then
  the 0-99 part.  For example, the number 1156 is sent as 11 followed by 56.

Consult your manual to see if this is the way supported by your device.

In order to hear a MIDI instrument, you must also set its default volume.

Note:  a  MIDI  instrument's  name  doesn't  really have any use.  It's good
practice,  however,  to  type the name of the presets into the Name gadget. 
This way you can easily see the presets, and if you give the song to someone
else  who  may have different MIDI equipment, he / she can easily change the
preset numbers to use the correct presets on his / her MIDI device.

**  The loop, tuning, default volume, and MIDI values, and the default pitch
    can  all  be  set  in  the  path file using the sample list editor.


The Instrument Type Window   [ Keyboard shortcut: Left Alt-T ]

This window, brought up either by using the Instr menu or by clicking "Type"
on  the  upper  screen,  chooses which type the current instrument is to be.
The options are:

Sample
The  "normal"  instruments, played either through the Amiga® or using a MIDI
device.

OctaMED  can load both "raw" (pure binary) samples and IFF 8SVX 1 - 7-octave
samples.    In  addition  to these, OctaMED Pro V4 introduced the loading of
"delta-compressed"  samples.   These samples' lengths are exactly halved (in
fact  they  are  converted  to a kind of 4-bit resolution of Fibonacci delta
codes:  much  simpler than it sounds!).  There is, however, a slight loss in
sound  quality.    Currently  OctaMED can't actually create delta-compressed
samples,  but some dedicated sample editor programs such as Audiomaster can.

Note  that  raw and 1-octave IFF samples can only use octaves 1 - 3: octaves
higher  than  3  play  using  octave  3's range.  Also note that the highest
octave of a 7-octave sample can't be played.

For MIDI use, the instrument is not strictly an instrument, but simply a few
settings  which  result  in the notes played with that instrument being sent
through  a  MIDI  interface;  therefore, MIDI instruments aren't loaded into
memory  like  other sounds.  They can also use the full 10.5-octave range.  
(For more information on MIDI, see MIDI Menu and Instr Params)

Hybrid
As  "Sample"  above,  but  can  be  controled  using  the  same "programming
language"  as  synthsounds.   (See the Synthetic Sound Programming Language.

ExtSample
ExtSamples  are  like  normal  Amiga®  samples, except two lower octaves are
added  to  the octave range (octaves 1 and 2).  The octaves used with normal
samples  are  moved  up  two  places  to  make way for the new octaves (i.e.
octave 1 becomes octave 3, octave 2 becomes octave 4 etc.).

However,  because  of  an  undesirable  feature  in  the  Amiga®'s hardware,
especially  under  faster  processors,  ExtSamples should be used with care.
After  playing  a  note  with an ExtSample using one of the new octaves, the
following  note  will  often not be correctly triggered.  The solution is to
use the FFF command before the following note is played.  For example:

             C-1 20000 <- ExtSample
             --- 00000
             --- 00FFF <- use FFF before the next note
             C-2 10000 <- this instrument doesn't need to be an ExtSample
                          for the bug to occur

However,  in  "split"  channels  in  5-8-channel  mode, this problem doesn't
appear at all!

Note:  more  experimentative  users  may  discover that octaves 8 and 9 of a
normal  sample also appear to play two lower octaves.  These octaves should,
however, *NEVER* be used in songs (apart from with MIDI): believe it or not,
it  is  in  fact  a complete coincidence that they work!  ExtSamples are the
only "legal" way of using the two lower octaves.  In any case, octaves 8 and
9 are also one finetune step sharp :-)

Synthetic
These  special  instruments,  known  as  "synthsounds", are made from simple
waveforms  which  can  be  joined  together  and have their volume and pitch
altered by using a simple "programming language".  Synthsounds usually sound
quite  simple,  but  they  can be very effective and don't take up nearly as
much  memory as normal samples.  In addition, they can play from octaves 1 -
5,  two  octaves  greater  than  normal  samples.  For more details, see the
Synthetic Sound Editor.

The  Octaves  slider  shows  the  number  of octaves that the current sample
consists  of  (1  -  7).    Changing  the slider's value often messes up the
sample, so it's best not to :^)

The Exit gadget closes the window.


The Transpose Window   [ Keyboard shortcut: Amiga-T ]

This  window  contains  functions that "transpose" (change the pitch of) the
notes  in  a  particular area of the current project.  It is activated using
the Edit menu.

The  gadgets  under "Affect" choose which area of the song the transposition
should  affect,  and  the  notes played by which instruments.  These gadgets
should be selected before choosing a function, and are:

Song
Affects the whole song (default).

Block
Affects the current block.

Track
Affects the current track (the track that the cursor is on).

Selected Tracks
Affects  selected  tracks  (tracks  are  selected by setting the track cycle
gadget on the upper screen to "Select").

Range
Affects  the  range,  selected  using the mouse.  (The button used to mark a
range is chosen in the Mouse Options window).

All
Affects all instruments (default).

Current
Affects the currently selected instrument.

The  "Transpose"  functions are Octave Up / Down and Halfstep Up / Down, and
should  be  self-explanatory.    (Note  to  British  users: "halfstep" means
"semitone").

The "Change Notes" operations act on the Source and Destination notes, which
are  selected  by clicking and holding the left mouse button on the note box
and pressing a key (for example, the I key selects note C-3).

Change
Allows  occurrences  of a single note to be changed throughout the specified
area.  It changes all notes in the selected area from the source note to the
destination note.

Swap
Swaps all source notes in the selected area with the destination note.

The  "Change Instrument" functions perform on notes played by the Source and
Destination  instruments,  which  are  picked  by   selecting   the required
instrument  (using  Shift  - <left> / <right> etc.) and clicking "Source" or
"Destination".

Change
Changes  the notes (in the selected area) played by the source instrument to
the destination instrument.

Swap
Swaps  the source and destination instrument numbers of notes having either.


Delete
Deletes the notes with the source instrument number.


The Spread Notes Window   [ Keyboard shortcut: Amiga-F ]

This  window  allows  you  to spread the notes in the currently marked range
across consecutive tracks to the right of the range.  If notes already exist
in  the tracks, the operation replaces them.  The window is opened using the
Edit menu.

The  "Width"  slider selects the number of tracks to spread the notes across
(2 - 10).

Clicking "Spread" spreads the notes, and shift-clicking "Spread" spreads the
notes _and_ closes the window.

"Exit" closes the window.


The Note Echo Window   [ Keyboard shortcut: Amiga-E ]

With  this  window,  opened  using  the  Edit  menu,  you may produce echoes
automatically  with  the "C" command (see Commands A - F.  The volume halves
with each echo.  For example:

        C-1 10000   (the initial note)
        --- 00000
        C-1 10C32   (half volume. Decimal volumes are used in this example)
        --- 00000
        C-1 10C16   (quarter volume)
        --- 00000
        C-1 10C08   (eighth volume)
        ...

Echoed  notes  will  only  be  placed in empty note positions throughout the
marked range.  The range may cover more than one track.

The gadgets are as follows:

Distance
The  distance in lines between echoes, e.g.  4 means echo every fourth line.

Minimum Volume
The minimum volume of an echo.  Echoes with a smaller volume than this won't
be generated.

Do Echo
Creates the echo. (Shift-clicking it also closes the window).

Exit
Closes the window.


The Input Channel Window   [ Keyboard shortcut: Amiga-\ ]

This  small  window,  activated using the MIDI menu, contains the MIDI input
channel  number  through  which  notes will be received when MIDI Menu/Input
Active is on.

If it is zero, OctaMED will accept input from all MIDI channels.


The Mouse Options Window     [ Keyboard shortcut: Amiga-W ]

This  window  contains  three  cycle  gadgets,  which are used to select the
function  of  each  mouse  button  when the button is clicked in the Tracker
editor.  It is opened using the Settings menu.

The available functions are as follows:

No Operation
The button has no effect.

Track On/Off
The button switches the clicked track on or off.

Select Track
Switches  the  clicked  selected  track  on or off.  (The status of selected
tracks  are  displayed  by  setting  the cycle gadget on the upper screen to
"Select").

Position Cursor
Sets the cursor position under the mouse pointer.

Select Range
Marks a range. (See the Tracker Editor)

Note: due to conflicts with the menu system, the right mouse button can't be
used to select a range as it has done in previous versions of (Octa)MED.

Also  note  that  if  the Right Mouse Button gadget is set to anything other
than  "No  Operation",  the menu shortcuts (Right Amiga + key) can't be used
when  the mouse pointer is over the tracker editor.  (They instead act as if
the right mouse button has been pressed: OctaMED has no control over this!)

The  default  for Left Mouse Button is Select Range, and the default for the
other  gadgets  is No Operation.  Of course, the Middle Mouse Button setting
is ignored if you own a two-button mouse!

The Exit gadget closes the window.


The Keyboard Options Window  [ Keyboard shortcut: Amiga-K ]

This  window contains many settings used when editing in the Tracker editor,
and  also holds settings for the numeric keypad.  It is brought up using the
Settings menu.

Cursor advance
--------------

The  three  gadgets  at  the top of the window are the directions the cursor
should advance after entering something in the editor.  They are:

Line Up / Down
Advances up / down a line.

            [ Ctrl-A toggles Don't Advance / Down ]

Track Prev / Next
Advances to the previous / next track when the cursor is on the note.

Cursor Left / Right
Advances left / right when the cursor is on the command digits.

Advance Line Down is the usual preferred setting, and the default.


Numeric keypad mapping  (Amiga 600 owners may ignore this section)
------------------------------------------------------------------

The two cycle gadgets select a total of four different ways to configure the
function of the keypad.

The  first gadget cycles "Tracks On/Off" and "Select Instr".  With the first
option you may turn tracks 0-F or 0-9 on/off, and with the second option you
can select instruments quickly.

The  second  gadget  selects  the  "Normal"  or  "Alternative" layout of the
keypad, and are as follows:

     Normal layout (button = selects track no. / selects instrument no.)
     ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        ( = 0 / 01      ) = 1 / 02      / = 2 / 03      * = 3 / 04
        7 = 4 / 05      8 = 5 / 06      9 = 6 / 07      - = 7 / 08
        4 = 8 / 09      5 = 9 / 0A      6 = A / 0B      + = B / 0C
        1 = C / 0D      2 = D / 0E      3 = E / 0F      . = F / 0G

     Alternative layout - Tracks On/Off
     ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Keys 0 - 9      Turn tracks 0 - 9 on/off.
        Keys ( ) / *    Turn tracks A - D on/off.
        The . key       Turns all tracks off.
        Enter key       Turns all tracks on.

     Alternative layout - Select Instr
     ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Keys 1 - 9      Selects instruments 1 - 9
        The . key       Changes the first instrument digit (for example,
                          from 05 to 15 or from 15 to 05)
           '0'          Selects instrument 10
           '+'          Next instrument
           '-'          Previous instrument
           '('          Decrease volume of the current instrument by one
           ')'          Increase volume of the current instrument by one
           '/'          Select last used instrument
           '*'          Pick instrument number nearest the cursor
          Enter         Activates "alpha-enter": after pressing Enter,
                          press an alphabetical key (A - V) to select the
                          corresponding instrument

Default is Alternative Tracks On/Off.

Spacing  (see Upper Screen)
---------------------------

The  slider  sets  the space value.  A space value of 3, for example, enters
notes every third line.  The maximum value is 16 (and minimum 2).

Placing  spaces  between  notes while entering music makes editing and tempo
changes  much easier.  After you have entered the music you may want to turn
this spacing function off so you may move into the lines between notes.

Other spacing options are:

Destructive Spacing
When selected, any notes that lie between the lines used for entering spaced
notes will be deleted when a note is entered.

Auto-Round Spacing
When on, restricts cursor movements to lines divisible by the spacing value.
For  example,  with  a  spacing  value of 2, you can only move the cursor to
lines  000, 002, 004 etc.  Note that this only applies to movement using the
cursor keys.

By  default these two options are on, which has been the normal operation in
previous versions of OctaMED.

Other options
-------------

Chord Reset
When on, after entering a chord (see Upper Screen) the cursor returns to the
initial track.

Space = DEL
Some users prefer using the space bar to enter blank notes, in preference to
the Del key.  This check box allows this.

Protracker Shortcuts
This  switch  changes the keyboard layout so that the most common Protracker
keyboard  options are recognized.  This is helpful for those who have become
used  to  the  Protracker  keyboard  layout.  The following PT shortcuts are
recognized:

           Right Shift      Turns editing on, plays the block (record)
           Right Alt        Continue Song
           Right Amiga      Play Block
           L-Alt+curs.L/R   Previous / next block
           Shift+curs.L/R   Increase / decrease playseq position
           Space bar        Stops playing / toggles editing
           Tab              Next track
           Shift-Tab        Previous track
           Shift-F3 - F5    Cut / Copy / Paste track
           Alt-F3 - F5      Cut / Copy / Paste block

Advance with Sound
When  activated,  the notes in the block are played when the cursor is moved
up or down.  Useful for non-real time editing.


The Programmable Keys Window  [ Keyboard shortcut: Amiga-Y ]

The  programmable  keys  ("progkeys"  from now on) allow music to be entered
much  more  easily  and  quickly.   You can assign notes or groups of notes,
including  commands,  to  10 different keys.  The assigned notes can then be
inserted in the Tracker editor by holding down Shift and pressing key 0 - 9.

This  window contains the functions necessary to view and edit the progkeys,
and is opened using the Settings menu.

The  cycle  gadget  is  used  to  select whether you wish to edit the normal
Shift-  0  - 9 definitions (default) or the Right Alt definition.  The Right
Alt  definition  consists of the command digits only, and if you enter notes
with  the  Right  Alt  key held in the Tracker editor, the specified command
will be inserted with the notes.

The  slider to the right of the cycle gadget selects which progkey you would
like  to edit (0 - 9).  By default key 1 is selected.  The slider is ghosted
when "Right Alt" is picked.

The  box below this, containing a note and command digits, is the definition
of  this progkey.  A note or digit may be edited by clicking and holding the
left  mouse  button  on  the note / digit, then entering a new note / number
using the keyboard.

A  note  /  digit being "x" indicates "transparency", which means that, when
entered  in the Tracker editor, the corresponding existing note / digit will
remain  unchanged.   The Right Alt key's definition always has a transparent
note part (the first three characters).

For  example, the definition "xxxxx0000" would clear the command digits, but
leave  the  notes.   Since the note is "xxx" and the instrument number "xx",
they won't be changed, so only the command is set to zero.  (This definition
is the same as pressing Alt-Del).

To make a note / digit transparent, hold down the left mouse button over the
required note / digit as above, then press the Return key.

The Clear gadget clears the current definition, i.e.  sets it to "--- 00000"
for a normal progkey and to "xxxxx0000" for Right Alt.

The  Pick  gadgets copy either the note under the cursor, the current range,
or  the  copy  buffer  to the current definition.  If a range is picked, the
definition  box  shows the word "=Range=".  [ Shortcut: Shift-Ctrl-0-9 picks
note under cursor ]

The  Save/Load  Keys  gadgets open a file requester allowing you to save and
load a set of progkey definitions.  The default name is S:OctaMEDPro.defkeys
(OctaMED  attempts  to load a file of this name on startup), but definitions
can be saved under any filename.

The Exit gadget closes the window.

(Note:  when Caps Lock is on, the programmable keys may be entered simply by
pressing the 0 - 9 keys: Shift doesn't have to be held).


The Palette Window

With  this  window,  activated  using  the Settings menu, you may change the
screen's colors.

A  color  is  selected by clicking on it, with the chosen color appearing in
the recessed box at the top left of the window.

The  Red,  Green and Blue sliders alter the intensity of red, green and blue
light in the selected color.

The  sliders'  range is set using the Palette Type cycle gadget.  With 8-Bit
selected  (default),  the  range is 0 - 255, allowing compatibility with the
new  AGA  chip  set  present  in  the A1200 and A4000 computers.  With 4-Bit
selected, the range is 0 - 15, more suitable for use with older Amigas.

Note  that  either  setting  can  be  used with either chip set; but with an
inappropriate  setting,  AGA  computers  could  only  select 1 in every 4096
available  colors, and with other computers the color would only change once
every 16 slider values (which is a little uncomfortable!).

The  OK  and Cancel gadgets accept or reject the color changes and close the
window.


The Instrument Load Window

This  window,  activated  using the small gadget immediately to the right of
the  instrument  number  on the upper screen, is a convenient way of loading
instruments contained in the sample list.  (See the Sample List Editor.

The  right-hand  list  contains  the  directories,  and  the  left-hand list
contains  the  filenames in the current directory.  The current directory is
set  by  clicking  on a directory name, and an instrument is loaded into the
current slot by clicking on an instrument name.

The other gadgets in this window are:

Flush
Removes the current instrument from memory.

           [ Keyboard shortcut: Ctrl - G ]

Prev / Next Inst
Selects the previous / next instrument.

           [ Keyboard shortcuts: Shift - <left> / <right>

Prev / Next Free
Selects the previous / next empty instrument slot.

          [ Keyboard shortcuts: Shift - Ctrl - "<" / ">" ]

Exit         Closes the window.


The Main Screen

The main screen is split into several parts:

Tracker editor 
Notation editor
Upper screen   
Lower screen   

Note  that  EITHER the Tracker editor OR the notation editor is displayed in
the  middle  of  the  screen  (not  both  at  once).   Which editor is to be
displayed is chosen in the Display menu


The Tracker Editor

OctaMED  Pro started off its life as MED, a public domain clone of a program
named  "Sound  Tracker".    Although  as  MED  grew it incorporated numerous
features  that Sound Tracker lacked, separating it from the competition, one
basic feature remains that Sound Tracker pioneered: the Tracker editor.

The Tracker editor notation is easily interpreted by the computer and allows
controls  that  would be impossible to describe using a traditional notation
system.    It is a grid-like system, where the rows are known as "lines" and
the columns "tracks".

Assuming  a  standard  4-track,  non-MIDI  setup  is  being used, each track
corresponds to one of the Amiga®'s "sound channels", of which the Amiga® has
four.    These  sound  channels  are  used for playing instruments, and each
channel  can  only  play one note at a time.  So using the above setup, four
notes  can  be  played  simultaneously  (not  necessarily  all  by  the same
instrument).    This  is  not  as  limiting  as it sounds: in practice, many
instruments can share a single track.

The  exact time at which these notes are played is set by entering the notes
on the appropriate line.  When playing, OctaMED plays each of these lines in
turn,  with  a  user-defined pause between the playing of each line.  So the
greater the number of lines between notes, the greater the time span between
them.  The line numbers are displayed on the extreme left of the screen, and
the current line is highlighted in white.

A typical note looks like this:

                           octave  command digits
                            |     / |
                        D # 3   5 0 C 2 0
                        \ |     |     \ |
                         note   |      \|
                                |       data byte (more information
                          instrument    about the command digits)

The  note  can  be C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, and H (or B), as in
standard music.  The octave number is which octave the note should be played
on, and three octaves can be used with normal Amiga® samples.

The  instrument  number is the number of the instrument that the note should
be played with.

The  command  digits  are  the  number  of the command or effect to play, in
hexadecimal.   If there are no effects or commands for this particular note,
the  digits  are  "0000".    Commands  and  effects are documented in Player
Commands.

A blank note (silence) looks like this: --- 00000.

Now  for  a  few  examples.    To  play a C major chord (notes C, E, G) with
instrument number 1, a line could look like this:

                000 C-2 10000  E-2 10000  G-2 10000  --- 00000
                |                                          |
      line number      "blank" note simply indicates no note on this track

To  play  a  C  major  scale  from  C  to G (i.e.  notes C, D, E, F, G), the
following could be used:

                        000 C-2 10000
                        001 D-2 10000
                        002 E-2 10000
                        003 F-2 10000
                        004 G-2 10000

To  play a C major scale from C to G AT HALF THE SPEED of the above example,
this could be used:

                        000 C-2 10000
                        001 --- 00000 <= In this way, these blank notes
                        002 D-2 10000    are used as "spacers" between the
                        003 --- 00000 <= other notes. A blank note doesn't
                        004 E-2 10000    stop the previous note, it allows
                        005 --- 00000 <= it to carry on. To stop the note,
                        006 F-2 10000    player command FFF is used (see
                        007 --- 00000 <= Commands A - F).
                        008 G-2 10000

So  in that instruments are triggered using a vertical list, Tracker editing
somewhat resembles programming a drum machine.


Entering notes
--------------

Notes  are  usually entered using the Amiga®'s keyboard (a MIDI keyboard can
also  be  used, see MIDI Menu.  Not all keys will enter notes.  The keys are
ordered  in a piano-like style, as follows (note that the keys correspond to
the  standard U.S.  keyboard; users of other keyboards should refer to their
Amiga®'s manual for any changes needed):

         2 3   5 6 7   9 0   = \    (Notes C# D# F# G# A# C# D# F# G#)
        Q W E R T Y U I O P [ ]     (Notes C D E F G A B C D E F G)

          S D   G H J   L ;         (Notes C# D# F# G# A# C# D#)
         Z X C V B N M , . /        (Notes C D E F G A B C D E)

The  upper two rows of keys are the upper octave, the lower two rows of keys
are  the  lower octave.  Note that keys to the right of the "U" key enter in
an  even  higher octave, and that there is a slight overlap in the lower and
upper  octaves:  the  keys to the right of the "M" key are duplicated in the
first few keys of the upper octave.

The  upper  and lower octave "keyboards" represent octave numbers 1 and 2 by
default.  Other consecutive octave numbers can be selected using the octaves
cycle gadget on the upper screen.

If  you  have an instrument loaded into the current slot, you can hear it by
pressing  one  of  these keys.  In addition, if editing is on (selected with
the  Edit  gadget on the upper screen, the note is entered at the cursor.  A
blank note is entered using the Del key.

The cursor is the small grey patch on the current line.  As well as being on
a  note,  it  may  be  on a digit (to the right of the note), and digits are
changed by simply by typing the new number (with editing on).

If  you  need to change the sixth digit (which lies between the note and the
second  instrument  digit,  and  is usually a blank space), which means that
sample 10 - 1V is used, position the cursor over the second instrument digit
(that  is  always visible), hold a Shift key and enter the second instrument
digit.   For example, to change the instrument number to 1E, press Shift-E. 
Because  Shift-  0  -  9 have another use, use Alt-Shift-0 - 9 to change the
instrument  number  to  10 - 19.  This isn't very convenient, but songs with
over 31 instruments are rare, so it is seldom a serious problem.

The  cursor  can  be  moved  using  the cursor keys, and also by using these
keyboard shortcuts:

        Alt - <left> / <right>        = Previous / next track
        Ctrl - <left> / <right>       = Previous / next screenful of tracks
        Shift - Ctrl - <left / right> = Track 0 / last track

        Shift - <up>        = Previous block (see the next section for a
        Shift - <down>      = Next block      description of blocks)
        Left Alt - <up>     = First block
        Left Alt- <down>    = Last block

        Ctrl - NM(          = Previous song
        Ctrl - NM)          = Next song / Add song
        Shift - Ctrl - NM(  = Delete last song
        Shift - Ctrl - NM)  = Add song with no requester

        F6   =  First line of block
        F7   =  Second quarter of block
        F8   =  Middle of block
        F9   =  Last quarter of block
        F10  =  Last line of block


Blocks and the playing sequence
-------------------------------

As  mentioned  in the introduction, a song is made up of "blocks", which are
simply  defined numbers of tracks and lines.  A block can contain up to 3200
lines,  and up to 8 tracks (using the Amiga®'s internal sound chip) or up to
64  tracks  (using  a MIDI instrument).  You can set the number of lines and
tracks  in  each block using the Block Properties window.  There can be 1000
blocks in a song (numbered 000 - 999).

The default number of lines in a block is 64, which allows 4 measures of 4/4
time,  and  means that each line represents a sixteenth note (British users:
sixteenth  note  =  semiquaver).    Notes may be more easily positioned in a
block  by  using  line  highlighting  in  the  Highlight Options window (for
example, with a default block a highlighting of 4 would mark every beat).

Again  as  touched  on  in the introduction, the order in which these blocks
should  be  played  is  defined in the "playing sequence", which is simply a
list  of  block  numbers.    (See  the  Playing   Sequence   window for more
information).

Each  block may have its own name, and block names may be edited both in the
Block Properties window and in the Block List window.  The current block and
its name is shown on the upper screen.

A  list  of  blocks  and their names, and gadgets for inserting and deleting
blocks can be found in the Block List window.


The Range
---------

A  "range" is a rectangular area of notes that is marked by dragging a mouse
button.   (Which mouse button is used is chosen in the Mouse Options window.
It may be as small as one note or as large as an entire block.  The range is
highlighted as you define it.

Many editing functions act on the notes in the current range, including some
in the Edit menu, Transpose window, and Programmable Keys window.

A  range  can  be canceled by simply clicking the chosen mouse button when a
range is marked.  This is useful, for example, if you have pressed the mouse
button by mistake.


The Notation Editor

The notation editor, activated using the Display menu, offers an alternative
to  the  normal  Tracker editor.  It can display notes and rests in standard
musical  notation,  which  is  both  useful for those who read music and for
printing songs to be played on an external instrument.

Note, however, that although notes can be entered using the notation editor,
player commands and effects may only be entered using the Tracker editor.

One  line  of  the  Tracker  editor is displayed in the notation editor as a
sixteenth  note,  so  a quarter note would be four lines long in the Tracker
editor.  The notation editor displays and prints one measure at a time.

The  notation editor consists of the notation itself on the main screen, and
a  Notation  Control  window  which  contains various editing options.  This
window may be closed using its close gadget, then reopened using the Display
menu.

Note  that  when  the notation editor screen is active, the mouse pointer is
displayed  as  the  current note instead of the default pointer symbol.  The
pointer's "hotspot" (the pixel used to "point" the pointer) is in the note's
circle, not at the top of the note's stick.  So for example, to click on the
Play  Block  gadget in the upper screen, position the note's circle (not the
top of the note's stick) over the gadget and press the left mouse button.

Selecting displayed tracks
--------------------------

The  editor  quickly becomes cluttered if all tracks are displayed at once. 
For  this  reason, you can select exactly which tracks should be displayed. 
This is achieved with the three rows of small square track gadgets:

Shown
Simply select which tracks are to be shown.

Ghost
Show the tracks in a "ghosted" (semi-visible) form.

Select
Clicking  a  track  gadget clears all Shown tracks except the track clicked,
and ghosts the tracks that were previously shown.

The  two  large arrow gadgets to the right of the track gadgets operate like
the  track  arrow  gadgets  on  the  upper  screen  - clicking them show the
previous/next  fourteen  tracks, and shift-clicking them show the first/last
fourteen  tracks  in the song.  (They only really apply to blocks containing
over fourteen tracks).

Presets
-------

You  can  choose five different combinations of selected and ghosted tracks,
and select them using the Preset cycle gadget immediately to the left of the
track gadgets.  The default is preset number 1.

Usually  it's convenient to put different components of the song on the same
tracks  throughout  the song.  For example, drums and percussion could be on
tracks  0  and  1, the bass line on track 2, the chords on tracks 3-5 and so
on.    Using  the preset function you can quickly display different parts of
the song.  For example:

Preset 1     All tracks
Preset 2     Only the chords (tracks 3 - 5)
Preset 3     Only the bass line (track 2)
Preset 4     The chords and the bass line (tracks 2 - 5)
Preset 5     Only the melody line (e.g. track 6)


Signatures
----------

You  may  set  the key signature of the song using the Key Signature window,
opened  using  the  appropriate menu item.  It contains a slider setting the
number  of  accidentals  -  sharps  or flats - required (0 - 6), and a radio
button  selecting  whether  the  accidentals  should  be sharps (default) or
flats.

A reminder of the number of accidentals used in different keys:

 Number of   |        Sharps         |         Flats
 accidentals | Major key | Minor key | Major key | Minor key
-------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------
      0      |     C     |     A     |     C     |     A
      1      |     G     |     E     |     F     |     D
      2      |     D     |     B     |     Bb    |     G
      3      |     A     |     F#    |     Eb    |     C
      4      |     E     |     C#    |     Ab    |     F
      5      |     B     |     G#    |     Db    |     Bb
      6      |     F#    |     D#    |     Gb    |     Eb

The  time  signature  is  set to 3/4 or 4/4 by using the Time Signature menu
item.  3/4 is three quarter note beats per measure, 4/4 is four quarter note
beats per measure.

Instrument settings
-------------------

Two  options  relating to the current instrument can be found in the Instr. 
Notation window, activated using the Current Instrument menu item.

The  Tranpose  slider is the display transposition value (-24 to 24) for the
current instrument.  This can be used, for example, to shift the main melody
one  octave  up to separate it from the bass line on the display (its actual
pitch  is  not  affected).    Usually you'll want to use steps of one octave
(i.e.  -24, -12, 12, 24), but any value can be chosen.  Note that the editor
can  display  just over four octaves (C-1 to D#-4), whereas OctaMED supports
10.5 octaves.

If  the  Hide Instrument check box is selected, the current instrument won't
be  displayed  in  the notation editor (although its notes are played).  For
example,  if  notes  of a chord extend into the drum track, you can hide the
drum instrument(s), showing only the chords.

Also  relating  to  instruments, if the Show Instrument Numbers menu item is
selected,  instrument  numbers  will  be  displayed  above  the notes on the
selected track.

Entering notes
--------------

After  making  sure editing is on (in the upper screen), you can enter notes
either  using  the  keyboard or with the mouse.  Before editing using either
method,  you need to select which track the note should be entered to, using
the  Select  track  gadgets.    Make sure the track you select exists in the
current  block,  or  you'll get a warning message: for example, don't select
track 6 in a 4-track block.

Edit  using  the  keyboard  in  the usual way, noting that the cursor is the
large blue block.

To  edit  with the mouse, you must first select its length.  This is done by
clicking  on  one  of the diagrams of notes or rests at the very left of the
Notation  Control  window.  The length of the note in multiples of sixteenth
notes  is  shown  in  the  Length  display box (this also corresponds to the
number of lines in the Tracker editor).

Next  you  position  the mouse pointer (which now resembles the chosen note)
over  the point on the stave where you wish to place the note, and press the
left  mouse button.  If you hold down the mouse button and move the mouse up
and  down, you can hear the note corresponding to its position on the stave,
and this note is shown in the Note display box.

The  cycle  gadget  below the two display boxes sets which entering mode you
require  when  using  the mouse to edit.  Replace (the default) replaces the
notes  -  a  bit  like the Overwrite option found in wordprocessors.  Insert
inserts the notes, pushing the following notes to the right.  Delete deletes
the notes you click on, moving the following notes to the left.


The Upper Screen

This  part  of the main screen, above the Tracker editor or notation editor,
contains some important general functions and displays.

The  upper  screen  is  laid  out  in five rows, which contain the following
functions and status displays:

The first row
-------------

Play Song
This  gadget  plays  the  current  song  from the start of the first playing
sequence.

        [ Keyboard shortcut: Shift-Alt-Space ]

Cont Song
Plays  the current song from the current playing sequence position, starting
at  the  current line (or the first line if the gadget is clicked with Shift
held).

        [ Keyboard shortcut: Shift-Space ]

The remaining gadgets on this line have to do with instruments.

The  display  box  to  the  right of "Cont Song" contains the current sample
number,  and is followed by a gadget which opens the Instrument Load Window.

To the right of this gadget is a GetFile gadget which opens a file requester
to load one or more instruments (see Instr Menu/Load Instrument(s) ).  After
this  is a text gadget containing the name of the current instrument.  A new
instrument  may  also  be  loaded into the current slot by typing a new name
into this gadget.

If  there's no instrument in this position, the text box will be blank.  You
may  sometimes  run  across  a  song from which the composer has removed the
instrument  names  from  the text box, though still using the instruments in
the  song.    To  determine  whether  this is the case, make each instrument
number  current and see if it plays from the keyboard.  There's no advantage
in removing the instruments' names.

The  display box after this displays the size of the sample, or "-Synth-" if it is
a synthsound or "-------" if the slot is empty.  The size is prefixed by an "H" if
the sample is a hybrid sound.  The last gadget on this line opens the Type window,
with which you may select the type that the current instrument is to be.

The second row
--------------

Play Block
Plays  the  current block from the first line.  It will be replayed when the
last line is reached.

           [ Keyboard shortcut: Amiga-Space ]

Cont Block
Plays the current block from the current line.

           [ Keyboard shortcut: Alt-Space ]

The  display  box  contains  the channel mode of the current song, an "M" if
MIDI is active, and an "I" if MIDI Input is active (see MIDI Menu).

The remaining gadgets open certain instrument windows:

Instr Params
Opens  the  Instrument  Parameters  window, which allows you to edit various
instrument parameters.

Edit Sample
Opens the Sample Editor window.

Edit SynthS
Opens the Synthetic Sound Editor window.

The third row
-------------

D
Continues  the  block from the current line when a note is entered.  Editing
must be on.  The display box in the lower screen changes to "Waiting Input".

STOP
Stops  playing  the  song  /  block.  Sometimes notes will continue to sound
after  you  stop  the  cong.    Click STOP again, or press the space bar, to
silence them.

Shift-clicking  STOP (clicking it with Shift held) stops playing and inserts
command FFE at the cursor.  (See Commands A - F).

        [ Keyboard shortcut: Space bar ]

The  next gadget, four digits with a ":" between them, is the timer gadget. 
This  is  the  number  of minutes and seconds since Play Song/Block has last
been  clicked.    Clicking  STOP, Cont Song or Cont Block doesn't affect the
elapsed  time.    You  may  reset  the  timer (to 00:00) by clicking the "R"
gadget.

 The  timer gadget also remembers the current song position.  When you click
the  R  gadget,  the  current  line / playseq position / section position is
stored.  Clicking the timer gadget itself moves back to the stored position.

The  remainder  of this row contains the tempo gadgets, that are used to set
the  playing  speed.  The first cycle gadget cycles BPM, which allows you to
set the tempo in Beats Per Minute, and SPD (default), with which you may set
the tempo in the usual way.

To  understand  this completely, technical aspects need to be known.  Timing
is  handled  using  the  CIAB  timers,  which give out "timing pulses" which
trigger  OctaMED's  player  interrupt.    On  each  timing pulse effects are
handled  (see  Player  Commands), but a new note is usually not played every
pulse.

In  SPD  mode,  the  time  between pulses can be changed using the left-hand
slider.  This is called the "primary tempo".  Usually notes are played every
6th  pulse,  but this also can be changed using the right-hand slider (it is
called  the "secondary tempo").  For example, if a new note was played every
3rd  pulse,  the  playing speed would be twice as fast.  This doesn't affect
the speed of effects.

Graphically:

pulse   \         PLAY NOTE  \
         the time between pulses is the "primary tempo"
pulse   /         DO EFFECTS   \
                                \
pulse             DO EFFECTS     \ The number of pulses between notes
                                 / (4 in this example) is the "secondary
pulse             DO EFFECTS    /  tempo"
                               /
pulse             PLAY NOTE   /

The  primary  tempo  can  be 1 - 240.  The higher the number, the faster the
speed,  and the default is 33.  For 4-channel or MIDI songs, values 11 - 240
should  be  used  (1  -  10 can also be used, but they only exist for Sound/
Noise/Protracker  compatibility).    For  5 - 8-channel songs, values 1 - 10
should be used; 11 - 240 are equivalent to 10 (to techies: this works in 5 -
8-channel  mode  not by changing the time between pulses but by changing the
size of the mix buffer).

The  secondary  tempo  can be $01 - $20 (in HEXADECIMAL, i.e.  33 values are
possible),  and  the  default  is  6.  The lower, the faster.  This allows a
fairly  rough  tempo  setting  (it's  the  way  the other Trackers set their
tempos).    For  MIDI use (especially for synchronization), you should leave
this  at  6  and  adjust the primary tempo instead.  Note that the secondary
tempo doesn't affect the speed of effects, unlike the primary tempo.

In  BPM  mode, the first slider controls the number of beats per minute (for
example,  60 is one beat per second).  The second slider controls the number
of  lines  per  beat (for example, 8 means eight lines are considered as one
beat).    Make  sure that the secondary tempo in SPD mode is set to 6 before
using  BPM; otherwise, the timing won't be accurate.  (This may, in fact, be
useful  to  some  users.  For example, double the normal BPM accuracy can be
obtained by setting the secondary tempo to 3).

   [ Keyboard shortcuts:  Ctrl- - (minus)     Decrease primary tempo
                          Ctrl- + (plus)      Increase primary tempo
                          Shift-Ctrl- -       Decrease secondary tempo
                          Shift-Ctrl- +       Increase secondary tempo ]

The  cycle gadget on the far right of the row plays at normal speed when NRM
(default),  two-thirds  speed when at 2/3, and half-speed when at 1/2.  This
is  useful for editing while the song is playing: you can slow the song down
without changing the tempo values, to make entering notes easier.

NOTE: It's possible to make a song which takes up all of the processor time.
It  will  therefore  be  impossible  to  stop  it.     This shouldn't happen
accidentally, but it can be done, for example, by filling a block with notes
and  setting  the  primary  tempo to 240 and the secondary tempo to 1...  To
stop playing, hold both mouse buttons down for about five or six seconds.

The fourth row
--------------

This row contains many status displays and the octave cycle gadget.

The  "Sg"  gadget  opens  the  Song  Selector window, and the status display
immediately  to  its  right displays the current song and the last song in a
multi-module.    (A  multi-module  is  a project consisting of more than one
song, but which all share the same set of instruments).

The  arrow gadgets are used to decrease / increase the current song number. 
If the current song is the last song, and the right arrow gadget is clicked,
an "Add new song?" requester appears, and OctaMED will add a new song to the
project  if  you  click "Add".  Shift-clicking the right arrow gadget adds a
new  song  without the requester.  Shift-clicking the left arrow deletes the
last  song  in memory after displaying a requester.  (Equivalent to the "Add
New" and "Delete Last" items in the Song menu).

The  "Sc"  gadget  opens  the Section List window, and the following display
shows  the  current section list position and the total number of entries in
the section list.

The "Sq" gadget opens the Playing Sequence window, and the following display
shows  the current playing sequence position and the total number of entries
in the playing sequence.

 Clicking the "B" gadget opens the Block List window, and shift- clicking it
opens  the Block Properties window.  The following display shows the current
block  number  (starting  at  000),  the  number  of the last block, and the
current block name.  The last block number + 1 is the total number of blocks
in the song (since the numbering starts at 000).

The octave gadget shows which octaves are currently in use when you play the
Amiga's  keyboard  (see  the Tracker Editor).  The first digit is the octave
number  of  the  lower row of keys, the second is that of the upper row.  If
the  current instrument has a MIDI channel of 0, keys F1 - F5 select octaves
1+2, 2+3, 3+4, 4+5, and 5+6.  If its MIDI channel isn't zero, F2 - F4 select
4+5 to 6+7, F1 toggles 1+2 to 3+4, and F5 toggles 7+8 to 9+A.  To clarify:

   Function key | Octave selected (non-MIDI) | Octave selected (MIDI)
   -------------+----------------------------+-----------------------
        F1      |            1+2             |    3+4 / 2+3 / 1+2
        F2      |            2+3             |          4+5
        F3      |            3+4             |          5+6
        F4      |            4+5             |          6+7
        F5      |            5+6             |    7+8 / 8+9 / 9+A


The fifth row
-------------

This  row  contains  three  important  check  boxes  and the track selection
gadgets.

Edit
Toggles  editing  on/off.   With editing on, you may insert notes or numbers
into the song (see the Tracker Editor).

     [ Keyboard shortcut: Esc ]

Space
With  this  switch  on,  a  set  number  of lines are skipped when a note is
entered  into  the  song.    (The number of lines skipped, and other spacing
options, are set in the Keyboard Options window).   Useful for entering slow
pieces of music, since you don't have to press the Del key as often.

When  you  enter  notes  during  playing (in "real-time") with Space on, the
notes  will be quantized.  For example, with a spacing value of 2, the notes
will  only  be  placed on even-numbered lines (if Auto- Round Spacing is on,
see Keyboard Options).

When  shift-clicked,  spacing is switched on and the Keyboard Options window
is opened (with a view to editing the spacing options).

     [ Keyboard shortcut: ~ (the key just below Esc) ]

Chord
When on, the chord entering mode is active.  You must still know which notes
of  a  chord  you want to use, but OctaMED will place them on the tracks for
you.

First  you  should select the tracks which the chord entering affects (using
the  Select  track  gadgets documented below).  The chord always starts from
the  current  track  and  continues  to the following selected tracks on the
right.

Now,  holding keys down will enter a chord.  For example, to enter a C major
chord:  hold  down  the Q key, press the E key and keep both keys held down,
then  press  the G key.  On releasing the keys, the cursor moves back to the
initial  track (if Chord Reset in the Keyboard Options window is on).  Chord
entering also works well using a MIDI keyboard (see the MIDI Menu).

(Chords may be deleted using Left Amiga-DEL: see Edit Shortcuts).

     [ Keyboard shortcut: Shift-Esc ]

The  remaining  gadgets  are  the track selection gadgets.  The row of small
gadgets toggle the tracks on/off.  The cycle gadget toggles On/Off (default)
and  Select.   On/Off mode allows you to mute some tracks while listening to
others  by clicking the track selection gadgets.  This is often useful while
editing.  (You can also use the numeric keypad for this, see Keyboard Opts).
Select  is  used in many editing functions (including Chord, Edit Menu/Paste
to Sel Tracks, and Transpose).

Shift-clicking  a track selection gadget "solos" the track, i.e.  clears all
tracks apart from the one selected.

The  arrow  gadgets display the previous / next fourteen tracks in the small
gadgets.    Shift-clicking  the  arrow  gadgets  displays  the  first / last
fourteen  tracks  in  the  current block.  The "Set" and "Clr" gadgets set /
clear all tracks.


The Lower Screen

This  part  of the main screen, below the Tracker editor or notation editor,
contains a few display boxes and one gadget.

On  the  left-hand  side  is  a display box showing the free memory.  "Chip"
memory  is  the memory used to store graphics and samples, and "Fast" memory
stores  everything  else.  So if you have a song with many samples in it, it
will probably be the Chip memory status you'll be watching.  A more detailed
account of the free memory can be obtained on the title bar by pressing Ctrl
- F.

The  smaller display box in the middle of the screen shows the status of the
song's  playing  ("Playing  Song",  "Playing  Block", or "Stopped"), and the
current  disk activity ("Loading", "Saving").  It also shows "Waiting Input"
if the D button (beside STOP) is clicked.

When on, the "Freeze Display" check box turns off parts of the display.  The
Tracker  editor  is  removed and replaced with "Frozen", and the two sets of
equalizers  are  disabled.   This releases more processor time, advantageous
when  multitasking.  The screen is automatically frozen when it isn't at the
front if Settings menu/Auto-Freeze Screen is on.

The  four  larger  boxes  at  the bottom of the display showing the waveform
currently being output by each of the Amiga®'s sound channels.  The displays
take up quite a lot of processor time when using a standard 68000 processor,
so  they  may be turned off in the Settings menu.  When enabled, the line in
the center of them is blue: when disabled, it is white.


Player Commands

Player  commands  provide  a  way  of  composing  music   that   sounds more
interesting.    They  consist  of  numbers  that are attached to a note, and
generally  they  perform  effects  on  the  notes  they are attached to (for
example,  pitch  /  volume  sliding  etc.).    Some commands control various
functions not directly applicable to notes: for example, changing the song's
tempo, jumping to a new playing sequence entry, or sending a MIDI message to
a MIDI device.

The  data  byte  allows  you to control the command's intensity, depth etc. 
Both the command number and data byte are in HEXADECIMAL !!!

They  are  entered in the command digits using the Tracker editor, by simply
positioning  the  cursor  on the digit and typing a new number (with editing
on).  In addition, the left command digit can be set to 1 by positioning the
cursor over the right command digit, holding down Right Alt and pressing the
right command digit's value.  For example, Alt-9 inserts command 19.

                C - 2  A 1 2 3 4
                         \ | \ |
                     command  \|
                               data byte

Advance  Cursor  Right  is often a help in editing the command digits.  (See
the Keyboard Options Window).

You'll  notice  that  some  commands  are  indicated   as   being ProTracker
compatible.    When loading and saving ProTracker modules, OctaMED makes any
necessary command conversions automatically.

The player commands can be split into four groups:

         Commands  0  - 9  (These topics contain descriptions of each
         Commands  A  - F   player command)
         Commands 11 - 1F 
          MIDI Commands   

Before  you read the descriptions, make sure you understand timing pulses (see the
Upper Screen) !!

Commands 0 - 9

Command 0:  ARPEGGIO                (MIDI: controller value)
------------------------------------------------------------

This  command changes the pitch of the note quickly (once every timing pulse).  It
can  be  used  to create "chords" or special effects.  If you've listened to music
made with the Commodore 64, you MUST have heard arpeggios!

The pitch is changed between three different pitches during one note:

        Pitch 1:  The original note
        Pitch 2:  Pitch 1 + the first data byte digit halfsteps up
        Pitch 3:  Pitch 1 + the second data byte digit halfsteps up

Note:  Pitch 3 is played first, then pitch 2, pitch 1, pitch 3, pitch 2 etc.  (the
number of pitches for each note depends on the secondary tempo).

For example, to create a C major arpeggio:

        Pitch 1:  C-2   (for example)
        Pitch 2:  E-2 = 4 halfsteps higher than C-2
        Pitch 3:  G-2 = 7 halfsteps higher than C-2

This produces:  C-2 10047
                --- 00047
                --- 00047 and so on... Note that the data byte with a
                          blank note continues the arpeggio.

The data byte for a minor chord would be 37.

Arpeggios sound better with some instruments than others

(Note that this works differently with MIDI, see MIDI Commands)


Command 1:  SLIDE UP                (MIDI: pitchbender up)
----------------------------------------------------------

This command slides up the pitch of the current track.

It  actually works by decreasing the period of the note the amount of the databyte
every  timing pulse.  Sounds rather technical??  Yes..  but a detailed description
is  not  really necessary, since slides can be made automatically: see Edit Menu /
Pitch Slide / Type 2.

If  you  use this function for special effects, experimentation is the key...  For
example:
     
     A-1 10000 --- 00000 --- 0010F <- slide up a bit


Command 2:  SLIDE DOWN              (MIDI: pitchbender down)
------------------------------------------------------------

Same as command 1, except slides down.


Command 3:  PORTAMENTO              (MIDI: set pitchbender)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Another  slide  command, with which you can create perfect slides more easily than
with  commands  1  and 2.  The difference is that commands 1 and 2 replay the note
they slide to: command 3 doesn't replay the note.

The data byte is the slide speed.  An example is the easiest way to explain this:

    C-2 50000 <- Note C is played
    --- 00000
    E-2 50305 <- This note isn't played! Instead, the slide target is set
    --- 00300    to E-2 with a slide speed of 5
    --- 00300 <- When the speed is zero, the previous speed is used
    --- 00306 <- The speed may be changed during a slide

This example would slide from C-2 to E-2, but the slide stops EXACTLY when a pitch
of E-2 is attained (with commands 1 and 2 you can slide beyond the note).

Again, slides can be created automatically in Edit / Pitch Slide / Type 1.

Command 4:  VIBRATO                 (MIDI: modulation wheel)
------------------------------------------------------------

Rapidly  increases  and  decreases  the note's pitch.  The first digit of the data
byte  is  the  vibrato speed, the second is the vibrato depth.  If either digit is
zero, the previous speed and/or depth is used.

The  higher  the digit's value, the greater the speed / depth.  (Remember that the
digits  are  in hexadecimal: values 0 - 9 and A - F can be used, giving a total of
16 possible values for each digit).


Command 5:  SLIDE AND FADE          (MIDI: controller number)
-------------------------------------------------------------

ProTracker-compatible.

This command combines commands 300 and Dxx.  The slide speed is the previous speed
entered with command 3, and the fade speed is the data byte.

    C-1 10000
    D-3 10303 <- slide at speed 3
    --- 00300 <- continue sliding
    --- 00502 <- continue sliding and fade at speed 2 (see command D later)
    --- 00502


Command 6:  VIBRATO AND FADE   [ ProTracker-compatible ]
--------------------------------------------------------

Combines  commands  400  and  Dxx.  Again, the vibrato speed is the previous speed
entered with command 4, and the fade speed is the data byte.

Command 7:  TREMOLO   [ ProTracker-compatible ]
----------------------------------------------

This  command  is  a  kind  of "volume vibrato".  The first data byte digit is the
tremolo  speed,  the second is the depth.  The depth must be quite high before the
effect is audible (try A - F).

The higher the digit's value, the greater the speed / depth.


Command 8:  SET HOLD/DECAY          (MIDI: set hold only)
---------------------------------------------------------

This  command  must  be  located on the same line as a note.  The command sets the
hold and decay values for the note (see Instrument Parameters).

The first digit is the decay value, the second is the hold value.

    C-3 30824  (decay = 2, hold = 4)
    -|- 30000
    -|- 30000
    --- 00000


Command 9:  SECONDARY TEMPO         (MIDI: no action)
-----------------------------------------------------

Sets  the  secondary  tempo (the number of timing pulses per note).  The data byte
must be $01 - $20.

(See also Player Commands, A - F, 11 - 1F, and MIDI Commands)


Commands A - F

Command A:  VOLUME SLIDE            (MIDI: polyphonic aftertouch)
----------------------------------------------------------------

This  is exactly the same as command D, for Sound/Noise/Protracker compatibility. 
However, please use D instead of this.

Command B:  PLAYING SEQUENCE POSITION JUMP
------------------------------------------

Allows  you  to  make  songs that have a beginning, which is played only once, and
another  part,  which  is repeated continuously.  The command causes a jump to the
playing  sequence  number  given  by the data byte.  If the data byte is zero, the
song is played from the first playseq entry.

Note  that  when more than one playing sequence is defined, the specified entry in
the  CURRENT playing sequence is jumped to.  At present, no command exists to jump
to an entry in the section list.

Example:    --- 00B02 <- start playing from playseq number 003


Command C:  SET VOLUME
----------------------

You can override the default volume of the instrument with this important command.

For example, "A-3 40C20" is played with volume 20.

There  are 65 volume levels (0 - 64), 0 = silent, 64 = maximum.  The data byte may
be either 00 - 64 or $00 - $40 (decimal or hex: see Song Options.

It is also possible to change the volume of an already played note:

    A-3 40000
    --- 00000
    --- 00C10 <- change volume to 10

In  addition,  you may actually set the default instrument volume.  The value MUST
be  in HEX!, and is between 80 and C0.  80 = volume $0, C0 = volume $40 (hex).  In
other words, add 80 to the normal volume in hex.

Note  that setting default instrument volumes can cause trouble in multi- modules,
since  all the songs share the same set of instruments.  So it is recommended that
default instrument volumes are only changed in non-multi- modules.

Command D:  VOLUME SLIDE            (MIDI: channel pressure)
------------------------------------------------------------

You  can  increase  /  decrease volume smoothly with this command.  The first data
byte digit is the amount of volume increase ("crescendo"), the second digit is the
amount  of  decrease  ("decrescendo").    If  crescendo  is  zero,  decrescendo is
performed:  otherwise,  only  crescendo is performed regardless of the decrescendo
value.

    C-2 30C40
    --- 00D01 <- a bit quieter
    --- 00D01 <- even quieter
    --- 00D20 <- and crescendo back to original volume

In  this  command  the  volume is changed every timing pulse.  So if the secondary
tempo was 6, a decrescendo value of 1 would decrease the volume by 6.  The example
above would look like this using C commands (except it doesn't sound as smooth):

    C-2 40C40 (volumes are decimal in this example)
    --- 00C34 <- -6
    --- 00C28 <- -6
    --- 00C40 <- +12


Command E:  SYNTH JUMP              (MIDI: pan control)
-------------------------------------------------------

This  command  only applies to synth/hybrid (and MIDI) instruments.  It is used to
trigger  a  jump  in the waveform sequence.  The data byte is the jump destination
(line number).

    C-4 40000 <- should be a synth/hybrid instrument
    --- 00000
    --- 00E05 <- causes a jump to line #5  (see Synthsound Programming)


Command F:  PRIMARY TEMPO / MISCELLANEOUS
-----------------------------------------

Command F has many different actions depending on the data byte.

If  the  data  byte  is  00,  it causes an immediate jump to the next entry in the
playing  sequence  (or  the  beginning  of  the  block if you are only playing the
current block).  This function is better to implement by making the block shorter,
as it takes less memory, so it mainly exists for Tracker compatibility.

    C-2 40F00 <- this is the last note that will play in the current block

When  the  data byte is $01 - $F0, the command changes the primary tempo (the time
between timing pulses).

If  the  new  tempo is 01 - 0A, it is compatible with Trackers, but you should use
command  9  instead  of this command as it's directly Tracker-compatible (but make
sure the primary tempo is set to the default 33).

    E-3 60FF0 <- quickest tempo (240 decimal)
    --- 00000
    --- 00F0B <- slowest (11 decimal)

Data bytes FF1 - FFF are reserved for special actions, most of which are currently
in use:

FF1  causes  the same note to be actually played twice.  In this way it's possible
to  create  fast rhythms.  It's identical to command 1F03.  With a secondary tempo
of 6:

        C-3 20FF1 is the same as C-3 20000
                                 C-3 20000 with double tempo (i.e. 3)

FF2  plays  the  same  note  only  once,  but it is not started immediately.  It's
identical to command 1F30.  Again with a secondary tempo of 6:

        C-3 20FF2 is the same as --- 00000
                                 C-3 20000 with double tempo

FF3  works  like  FF1  except  the  note is played three times (very quick).  It's
identical to command 1F02.  Again with a secondary tempo of 6:

        C-3 20FF3 is the same as C-3 20000
                                 C-3 20000
                                 C-3 20000 with triple tempo (i.e. 2)

FF4 delays the note one-third of a line.

FF5  delays  the note two-thirds of a line.  FF4 and FF5 can be used, for example,
to create triplets:

        C-2 10000  Here, the three notes will be evenly spaced throughout
        D-2 10FF4  the four lines (they'll have a length of one-and-a-third
        E-2 10FF5  lines each)
        --- 00000

    They only work accurately when the secondary tempo is divisible by 3
    (3, 6, 9 etc.).

FF8 turns the low-pass filter off (see the Song Options Window)

FF9 turns the low-pass filter on

FFD  (doesn't  work  with  MIDI)  causes the pitch of the channel to be set to the
pitch of the new note, but the new note is not replayed.

        C-1 20000 <- play note
        --- 00000
        C-2 20FFD <- don't replay the note, just set the pitch to C-2

This is especially useful in playing long samples or samples with a loop set (like
strings, choirs etc.), as the undesirable "click" that you can sometimes hear when
playing a new note is eliminated.

FFE stops playing immediately.  (When used in 5 - 8-channel mode, the song's notes
are  also  stopped).    If you want to make a song which only plays once, put this
command at the end of the song.  It can be easily inserted by clicking STOP with a
Shift key held.

FFF  stops the note on the current track.  Is almost like C00 with Amiga® samples,
but  while  C00  sets  the  volume  of  the  note  to zero, FFF turns the note off
completely (there is a subtle difference :).

(See also Player Commands  0 - 9, 11 - 1F, and MIDI Commands)

Commands 11 - 1F

Command 11:  SLIDE PITCH UP ONCE   [ Equivalent to ProTracker command E1 ]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whereas command 1 slides the pitch smoothly, this command only changes it once per
note (for greater accuracy).

    C-2 31105 <- slightly above C-2

To  techies: with this command, you may play a note at any period value you wish. 
For example, C-2 is 428.  To play at period 431, simply enter "C-2 31103".

Command 12:  SLIDE PITCH DOWN ONCE   [ Equivalent to PT command E2 ]
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Equivalent to command 11, except slides down.

Command 14:  PT-COMPATIBLE VIBRATO   [ Equivalent to ProTracker command 4 ]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In  Protracker,  the  vibrato  command was changed from NoiseTracker.  The maximum
depth  was  halved  to give greater accuracy.  This command is compatible with the
new  Protracker  vibrato  (loading  Protracker  songs automatically changes the PT
vibrato command to this command 14).

Command 15:  SET FINETUNE
-------------------------

Overrides the default finetune value of the instrument.

Since these are hexadecimal numbers, negative numbers must be expressed as:

    -1 = FF        -3 = FD         -5 = FB          -7 = F9
    -2 = FE        -4 = FC         -6 = FA          -8 = F8

    C#3 21503 <- finetune = +3
    D-2 315F8 <- finetune = -8


Command 16: LOOP   [ Equivalent to ProTracker command E6 ]
---------------------------------------------------------

This  interesting  command  enables  you  to construct a loop within a block.  For
example:

    ...
    004 C-3 11600 <- data byte = $00: mark loop beginning
    005 D#2 10000
    006 --- 11603 <- data byte = $03: loop three times
    ...

This  example would play lines 004 - 006 three times before continuing.  You can't
nest loops!

Command 18:  CUT NOTE               (MIDI: no action)
-----------------------------------------------------

Almost  like  hold  (command  8),  except  it  sets  the volume to zero instead of
actually  switching  the  note  off.  This is Protracker-compatible (equivalent to
command EC).

Command 19:  SAMPLE START OFFSET    (MIDI: no action)   [ PT command 9 ]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

When playing a sample, this command sets the starting byte in steps of 256 bytes (
= $100 hex).  Useful for speech samples.

    C-2 11904 <- play the sample starting at byte $400 = 1024


Command 1A:  SLIDE VOLUME UP ONCE   (MIDI: no action)   [ PT command EA ]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Allows you to make slow volume slides, since the volume is slid only once per line
(on the first timing pulse of each line).

    D-2 11A01 <- a looped string, perhaps, default volume 0
    --- 01A01
    (and so on..)


Command 1B: SLIDE VOLUME DOWN ONCE  (MIDI: no action)   [ PT command EB ]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Equivalent to 1A except slides down.


Command 1D: JUMP TO NEXT PLAYSEQ ENTRY   [ Equivalent to PT command D ]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This command is like F00, except that you can specify the line number of the first
line to be played.  The line number is (as usual) given in HEX.

    --- 01D0A <- next playseq entry, start at line 10 (skip lines 000-009)


Command 1E: REPLAY LINE   [ Equivalent to ProTracker command EE ]
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Replays  the  commands in the current line the specified number of times.  Doesn't
replay the notes.

    C-2 10000 --- 00000
    --- 00101 --- 01E06 <- replay the commands in this line six times


Command 1F: NOTE DELAY AND RETRIGGER   [ PT commands EC and ED ]
----------------------------------------------------------------

Gives  you  accurate control over note playing.  You can delay the note any number
of  timing  pulses, and initiate fast retrigger.  The first data byte digit is the
note delay value, the second one is the retrig value.

    C-2 11F20 <- delay 2 timing pulses

     => pulse  0  ---
               1  ---
               2  C-2
               3  ---
               ...

    C-2 11F02 <- retrig every second pulse

     => pulse  0  C-2
               1  ---
               2  C-2
               3  ---
               4  C-2
               ...

    C-2 1FF22 <- delay 2 pulses THEN retrig every second pulse

     => pulse  0  ---
               1  ---
               2  C-2
               3  ---
               4  C-2
               ...

    Command 0FF1 is equal to 1F03, 0FF2 to 1F30, and 0FF3 to 1F02.

(See also Player Commands, 0 - 9, A - F, and MIDI Commands)


MIDI Commands
-------------

Please  read  the  other command explanations (see Player Commands) before reading
this.   This topic is like an "erratum" for MIDI, in that it documents the changes
to the other command documentation required for MIDI use.

Commands  B,  F,  16,  1D,  1E,  and  1F  all work identically with MIDI to Amiga®
instruments.   Commands 15, 18, 19, 1A, and 1B have no effect when used with MIDI.

If  you  are  unfamiliar  with any of the terms used in this topic, please consult
your MIDI device's manual.

Command 0:  CONTROLLER VALUE
----------------------------

See command 5 for a description.

Command 1:  PITCHBENDER UP
--------------------------

This  command "turns" the pitchbender 8 × data byte steps up on each timing pulse.
However,  automatic  slide making (unfortunately) can't be used here.  Because the
actual  range  of the pitchbender is different for different instruments, you must
find the right value by experimenting.

When  a  new note is played, the pitchbender is not reset automatically.  To reset
it, use this command with a data byte of 00.

    G-2 L01FF <- turn pitchbender up very quickly
    --- 00000
    --- 00100 <- then reset the pitchbender


Command 2:  PITCHBENDER DOWN
----------------------------

As command 1, except turns the pitchbender down.

Command 3:  SET PITCHBENDER
---------------------------

With  this  command  you  may  set  the  pitchbender to an exact value, instead of
sliding as in commands 1 and 2.  The data byte is the pitchbender value, expressed
as a signed hexadecimal digit (aargh!!  ;-)

        $00       = center position
        $80 (-7F) = smallest value
        $7F       = largest value

    C-2 30000
    --- 0037F <- pitchbender to maximum value
    --- 00300 <- reset


Command 4:  MODULATION WHEEL
----------------------------

Affects  the  modulation  wheel of the current channel.  The data byte can be 00 -
7F:  00  =  no  modulation,  7F = maximum.  Values 80 - FF are reserved for future
expansion (i.e.  won't work ;).  (Modulation is usually vibrato).

Command 5:  CONTROLLER NUMBER
-----------------------------

This  command,  in  conjunction  with  command  0,  allows  you to change any MIDI
controller (command $Bx cc vv, where cc = controller number, vv = value).

First  you  set  the  number  of the controller you wish to change with command 5.
Then  you  can select the value with command 0.  Subsequent uses of command 0 will
affect  the  controller  previously  set  with command 5.  Remember that each MIDI
channel has its own controller number.

If  you  need  to use a controller value of $00, you can't use "00" as a data byte
because  command  "0000"  means  "do  nothing".    Instead,  you need to use "80".
Acceptable controller numbers and values are $00 - $7F.

For example (assuming instrument 3 is set to MIDI channel 1):

    C-2 30000
    --- 00507 <- controller $07 = volume, according to the MIDI standard
    D-2 3007F <- set max. volume (7F), command $B0 $07 $7F is sent
    --- 00000
    F-3 30001 <- small volume ($01)
    --- 0055C <- select controller $5C (tremolo depth)
    G-4 30080 <- set to 0 (note: $80 = $00)


Command 8:  SET HOLD ONLY
-------------------------

Just  to  underline  that  decay  can't  be  used with MIDI instruments.  (This is
because with MIDI, the volume of an already played note can't be altered).

Command A:  POLYPHONIC AFTERTOUCH
---------------------------------

Changes  the  polyphonic  aftertouch  of  the  most  recent  note.  (Aftertouch is
squeezing  a  key down harder than when it was initally struck).  The value should
be 00 - 7F.

    C-3 40000
    --- 00A30 <- aftertouch $30 (remember, hex!)
    --- 00000
    --- 00A00 <- aftertouch $00


Command C:  SET VOLUME
----------------------

Again,  just  to underline that the volume of a note can't be changed after it has
been played (as it can with Amiga® samples).

Command D:  CHANNEL PRESSURE
----------------------------

This  command sends a channel pressure (channel aftertouch) message using the most
recently used channel.  The data byte should be $00 - $7F.

Command E:  PAN CONTROL
-----------------------

Controls the stereo location of the note. The data byte can be $00 - $7F.

    left        mid         right
     |           |            |
    00          3F           7F


Command F:  PRIMARY TEMPO / MISCELLANEOUS
-----------------------------------------
¯
Just two additions for MIDI use:

FFA sends the "hold pedal on" command.

FFB sends the "hold pedal off" command.


Command 10:  SEND MIDI MESSAGE
------------------------------

Sends a MIDI message, created using the MIDI message editor.  The data byte is the
message number.  Note that with this command the first message is number 0, so you
need to subtract one to convert the message number from the message editor for use
with this command.

    C-2 11000 <- send the first message, then plays note C-2 (messages are
                 always sent before notes)

MIDI timing pulses are sent immediately even if a message dump is going on.


Command 13:  SET PITCHBENDER WITH NOTE
--------------------------------------

Like command 3, but can also be used when there's a note next to the command.

Command 1C:  CHANGE MIDI PRESET
-------------------------------

Changes  the  MIDI  preset number of the current instrument.  As with all commands
which  modify  the  song  parameters,  you  should be very careful when using this
command in multi-modules (or even don't use it at all in multi- modules).

(See also Player Commands, 0 - 9, A - F, and 11 - 1F)


KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
------------------

"Keyboard  shortcuts" are combinations of keys used to carry out the equivalent of
a  mouse  operation.  The mouse operation may be selecting a menu item, clicking a
gadget  etc.    Hence you are "taking a shortcut" by using the keyboard instead of
using the mouse.

Perhaps  the  simplest  form of keyboard shortcuts are menu item shortcuts.  These
are displayed in the menu itself, as a strange-looking "A" and a letter.  All menu
shortcuts  are  accessed  by  holding  down  the  Right Amiga key and pressing the
appropriate  key.    The "A" symbol represents the Right Amiga key, and the letter
represents  the  appropriate  key.   Note that the menu shortcuts can only be used
when the main screen is active (that is, when no windows are active).

Shortcuts  can  also  be  attached  to  gadgets in windows and on the main screen.
These  shortcuts  are  accessed  by holding down the Left Alt key and pressing the
appropriate  key.   This time, the appropriate key is represented by an underlined
letter  in  or beside the gadget that the shortcut acts on.  This type of shortcut
can  only  be  accessed  when  the  window or main screen containing the gadget is
active.    The  effect  of  shortcuts  on  the various types of gadget in the user
interface can be found in Gadget Shortcuts.

Other shortcuts are not visually represented on the OctaMED screen, but have to be
remembered  by  the  user.   A full list of shortcuts is provided in the following
topics:

Menu Item Shortcuts       
Editing Shortcuts         
Cursor Movement Shortcuts 
Other Shortcuts

                    spacing to 2. It's logical to subtract 1 since
                    with a spacing of 2, the cursor skips from line
                    000 to 002 which is 3 lines long).

Ctrl-0              Duplicate current playing sequence entry
Ctrl-.              Delete current playing sequence entry

Note  that  with  the  Caps  Lock  on,  the playing sequence can be edited without
holding down the Ctrl key.

The non-shifted functions of the keypad are listed in Keyboard Options.


IMPORTANT NOTE FOR USERS OF NON-U.S. AND NON-BRITISH KEYBOARDS

The  keyboard shortcuts used in these instructions correspond to the standard U.S.
keymap  (and,  by  coincidence, to the British keymap).  Users of other keyboards,
therefore, have slight changes to make to the keys given.  They are:

A = Q on a French keyboard
Z = W on a French keyboard, and Y on a Swiss or German keyboard

<  and > are the two keys immediately to the right of M (except French, where they
are the two keys to the right of ",")

- and + are the two keys immediately to the right of 0 (zero)

*  Note  that  these changes DON'T apply to the Right Amiga menu shortcuts or Left
Alt  gadget  shortcuts.   For example, to open the Input Map Editor window using a
French  keyboard,  hold  down the Right Amiga key and press the key immediately to
the right of the Tab key (A).

Other  international  keyboard  differences  currently  don't  apply  to OctaMED's
keyboard shortcuts.


INTRODUCTION AND MISCELLANEOUS NODES

Introduction

Welcome  to  OctaMED  Professional V5.0!  The "MED" in "OctaMED" stands for "Music
EDitor",  and  that's  exactly  what OctaMED is.  With the program you may compose
music for games, demos, animations and presentations, or simply use the program as
a stand-alone editor.

There  is  little previous Amiga® knowledge you need to use OctaMED, but a general
familiarity  with  the  Amiga®  is helpful.  You should know the basic mouse-using
terms  "click"  and "drag", know about using windows and menus, know the operation
of  the  ASL  file  requester,  and  be able to copy and format disks.  If you are
unfamiliar  with any of these, please consult your Amiga®'s manual.  Communication
with the program is covered in the User Interface topic.

You  must  also  remember  which processor your Amiga® uses.  The A1200 contains a
68020  processor,  and the A3000 and A4000 either a 68030 or 68040.  Other Amigas®
(without  accelerator boards fitted) use 68000 processors.  In addition to this, a
few  functions  in  OctaMED  are  selected with the mouse using a technique called
"shift-clicking".    This  simply  involves holding down one of the Amiga®'s Shift
keys while pressing and releasing the left mouse button quickly.

Before you begin using OctaMED, you must make a copy of the program disk and store
the  original disk in a safe place.  This serves as a precaution in case your copy
of OctaMED becomes corrupt.  The original disk should only be used to make further
copies.  ( for your OWN use )


A brief overview of the program
-------------------------------

OctaMED  is used to create "songs" (which are also known as "modules").  Each song
consists  of  small  pieces of music called "blocks", which are linked together by
creating  a  list  of blocks arranged in the order in which they should be played.
Blocks can be played in any order, and any number of times.  In this way a song is
broken  down  into  more  manageable pieces; and if a song contains parts that are
repeated,  you  need  only  create  the duplicated section once, and then tell the
computer to play it as often as required.

Blocks  are  usually  edited  using  the  Tracker  editor,  in  which the music is
represented  by note names and numbers.  In this form, the music is quite fast and
convenient to edit (when you get used to it!), but it has limited use when printed
since no-one could play it (although printing is still possible).

For  those who read music and wish to compose using the more traditional format of
notes placed on a stave, a notation editor is provided for this purpose.  However,
the Tracker editor is still very important so learning to use it is essential.

Usually  songs  are  played using the Amiga®'s internal stereo sound chip, but you
may  also  use  a  MIDI keyboard.  For sound chip use, the instruments used in the
song usually consist of digitized sounds known as "samples".  A sample can consist
of  any  sound  at all: it could be a single note, a chord, speech, sound effects,
anything!    Using  OctaMED and a "sound sampler" (which you must buy separately),
you  can create new samples by simply connecting the sound source to the sampler. 
Alternatively  you  can use the many thousands of samples already available, which
are  obtained  through  various distribution channels such as the public domain or
commerical companies.

OctaMED  can  be  thought of as a player of samples in a predetermined sequence at
predetermined pitches on predetermined sound channels.  (Of course, you - the user
-  determine these factors).  Since samples are played in a set sequence, programs
like  OctaMED  are  often  referred  to  as "sample sequencers".  OctaMED produces
different  pitches by simply playing the samples at a quicker or slower speed: the
quicker  the  speed,  the  higher  the pitch.  These pitches of samples are called
"notes"  (no matter whether the sample really is a single note or instead a chord,
speech etc.).

OctaMED  has  a  special function for use with samples that is virtually unique in
programs of its type.  Normally the Amiga®'s sound chip can play only four samples
simultaneously, but in OctaMED you can play up to eight samples at once.  Although
this  may  sound rather attractive, there is a small price to pay in sound quality
and  in  various  restrictions  (which  are documented in 5-8 Channel Mode).  (The
"Octa" in OctaMED's name refers to the eight simultaneous samples).

(Remember,  click  on  any  boxed  text  to  see  more  details on that topic.  In
addition, pressing Return chooses the topic highlighted in blue).


[  Please  note  that  although this guide will be of great assistance in learning
where and how!, it is no substitute for the OctaMED Companion.  The Companion is a
manual  containing full "get-you-started" instructions and then goes through every
aspect  of OctaMED right up to the truly technical stuff and if followed properly,
by  the  time  you have finished you will know how to use/write/compose as good as
anyone else.

The  Tutorial  is  not  a  printout  of  this text file, but is instead a complete
teach-yourself manual and we have spent many months preparing it.

To purchase the tutorial and its accompanying two disks please contact SeaSoft for
availability or Ray Burt-Frost ( RBF Software )

How are songs made?
-------------------

1. Load instruments
-------------------

There  can  be up to 63 instruments in a song, and they are numbered 01 - 1V.  The
numbering  works  as  follows:  01, 02, 03 ...  09, 0A, 0B ...  0V, 10, 11, 12 ...
19, 1A, 1B ...  1V.

Just  below  the  title  bar  of  the OctaMED screen is a small box containing the
current  sample's  number,  followed by a text box containing the current sample's
name.    The  previous or next instrument can be selected by holding the Shift key
down and pressing the left or right cursor (arrow) key respectively.

A  sample  can  be  loaded  into  the current instrument slot by either typing its
filename  into  the text box, or clicking the small gadget immediately to the left
of  the  text  box: you may now choose its filename using the file requester.  The
instruments  on  your  sample disks may also be organized into a list known as the
sample list for easy loading (see the Sample List Editor).


2. Set block size, number of tracks etc.
----------------------------------------

See the Tracker Editor for more information on this.

3. Set instrument parameters
----------------------------

Instrument  characteristics  such  as  tuning and volume are set in the Instrument
Parameters window.

4. Edit blocks and add new blocks
---------------------------------

As previously mentioned, blocks are edited predominantly using the Tracker editor.
New blocks can be created using the Block List window, or by using Block Menu/New.
(This means using the New item in the Block menu).

5. Link blocks together
-----------------------

The  list  of  block numbers used to order the playing of a song is created in the
Playing Sequence window.

6. Play song
------------

The  song playing gadgets are located on the upper screen.  You may play the whole
song  or  just  the  current block, or continue the song or block from the current
position.

7. Save song
------------

There's  no  point  in  creating  a  masterpiece  if it can't be saved!  Saving is
achieved  using  the Save Options window, where you may select what format to save
the song in, whether the song is to be compressed etc.

Multi-modules
-------------

"Multi-modules"  are projects containing more than one song.  Each song shares the
same set of instruments.  This allows you, for example, to compose different songs
for  each  level  of a game, without having to load or keep the same instrument in
memory more than once.

Multi-modules  are  also  very useful when editing just one song, as you can treat
one  song  in  the  multi-module  as  "workspace", much like Deluxe Paint's "spare
screen"  option.    You  may design and compose in one song, then cut and paste to
another.

Songs  are  added  by using either the relevant gadgets on the upper screen or the
Song Selector window.

OctaMED  can automatically remap instruments while loading.  This feature can save
you  a lot of work.  If you have one or more songs already in memory, and you load
an additional song, a "Remap instruments?" requester will appear.

If  you  click  "No"  in  the  requester,  all  previous instruments in the entire
multi-module  will  be  lost  and  the instruments of the new song will be loaded.
This  could  be  used, for example, to use the new, different instruments with the
other songs in the module.

But if you reply "Yes": firstly, the instruments of the new song will be loaded to
empty  slots, i.e.  instruments already in memory will be preserved; secondly, the
instrument  numbers  of the loaded song will be remapped so that they point to the
new  instrument  places.   This means that the several sets of instruments used in
the several songs can be contributed to one large overall set of instruments.

Some other features of OctaMED
------------------------------

*  Friendly  and   reasonably   simple   appearance   (considering   the program's
complexity!): see the User Interface

*   Numerous   editing   operations,   including   Cut/Copy/Paste   as    found in
wordprocessors,  note  transposition  etc.   (see Block Menu, Track Menu, and Edit
Menu)

*  Sample  waveforms  can be edited and digitized in the sample editor, and simple
synthetic instruments may be designed using the synthetic sound editor

*  The relative volume of each track and the overall song volume can be altered in
the Track Volumes window

*  MIDI  may  be  used,  with  up  to 64 notes played simultaneously and many MIDI
settings and operations (including a MIDI Message editor)

*  Complete  PowerPacker  and  SFCD-compression load support: OctaMED can load and
decrunch  any  PowerPacked  or  SFCD-compressed  file.    (The only file you can't
compress, unfortunately, is this one: OctaMED.guide).

OctaMED has built-in compression facilities for songs, but currently not for other
files.  To compress other files, you must use either the PowerPacker program (from
UGA  software, distributed by various companies) or the PowerPlayer Music Cruncher
(for SFCD-compression, included on e.g.  Fish 769).

Requires  powerpacker.library  for  PowerPacker,  and  lh.library  for SFCD.  Both
libraries  included  on  OctaMED's distribution disk under previous agreement with
the  copyright  owners.  The full PowerPlayer distribution archive can be found on
Fish disk 769 (ask your favourite public domain library).

*  Numerous  keyboard  shortcuts  exist.   Note the conventions used: for example,
"Ctrl-A"  means  "hold  down  the  Ctrl key and press the A key"; also, the cursor
(arrow) keys are represented by <left>, <right>, <up> and <down>.

In  order  to  learn  how  to  use the program, we suggest that you study the Main
Screen  topics  first,  and  then  perhaps  the User Interface topic.  Then simply
experiment!    If you find something you don't understand, just press the Help key
and  select the appropriate topic.  For example, if you don't quite understand the
function  of  the Input Map Editor window, select "Windows" from the contents page
then select "Input Map Editor" from the Windows topic.

(Please  ignore the occasional word "" that you might find: it simply indicates to
upgraders from V4 which features are new to V5.0).

We hope you will find this program useful and enjoy it!

P.S.  In this help file (and in many other computer documents and bulletin boards)
you may come across odd-looking symbols, often consisting of a semicolon or colon,
an optional hyphen and a closed bracket.  To understand these, just tilt your head
90 degrees to the left :-)


5 - 8-Channel Mode

(Parts of this topic are really intended as a reference for more experienced users
of OctaMED, so don't worry if you don't understand everything at the moment!)

The  Amiga®  has  four  stereo  sound channels in its sound chip, and through each
channel one note can be played at once.

5  -  8-channel  mode works by mixing two samples in real time and then outputting
them through one sound channel.  This takes up a lot of the processor's power, and
the  mixing process reduces the sound quality (causes distortion).  The distortion
can  be reduced using High Quality Mode or (as a last resort ;) by using the audio
filter (both selected in Song Options, and channel mode changing is also contained
in this window).

The  processor  load that 5 - 8-channel playing causes, and some technical reasons
set some limitations to playing in these modes:

*  Different  playing  speed selection.  Use the secondary tempo as usual, but use
primary tempo values 1-10.

* Synthetic / hybrid sounds can't be used

* All equalizers are disabled

* All MIDI features are disabled

* Instrument  default  volume  and Decay values are ignored, as are the track and
  master volumes

*  Limited  sample  loop  length,  only  in  a minimum of 200-byte steps (when the
primary  tempo  is 1).  Every time the primary tempo is increased by one, the loop
length byte-steps increases by 20.  So with a primary tempo of the maximum 10, the
length is set in 400-byte steps.

In  addition  to  this, samples should be "halved".  This means that each sample's
volume  should  be  half  of its normal volume, so that they can be mixed with the
minimum  of  distortion.   The halving is done automatically when changing channel
mode (answer "Halve" in the requester).

The  sound channels that play these mixed samples are called "split channels".  In
eight-channel  mode  all  channels  are  split, but in five- channel mode only one
channel  is  split,  allowing  better quality samples on the other three channels.
You  may  use  non-halved  samples  on  non-split  channels, but attempting to use
non-halved  samples  on  split  channels  when two notes are played simultaneously
usually creates awful noise.

The channel configuration in each of the channel modes is as follows:

  ( S = split, N = non-split, (L) = left speaker, (R) = right, - = unused )

Channels    0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|   4   | N (R) | N (L) | N (L) | N (R) |   -   |   -   |   -   |   -   |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|   5   | S (R) | N (L) | N (L) | N (R) | S (R) |   -   |   -   |   -   |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|   6   | S (R) | S (L) | N (L) | N (R) | S (R) | S (L) |   -   |   -   |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|   7   | S (R) | S (L) | S (L) | N (R) | S (R) | S (L) | S (L) |   -   |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|   8   | S (R) | S (L) | S (L) | S (R) | S (R) | S (L) | S (L) | S (R) |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+

Note  that  5  - 8 channel mode does NOT mean how many tracks there are.  You must
also select 5 - 8 tracks in the Block Properties window.

For best results, you shouldn't use more channels than you need.  If, for example,
your  song  doesn't  use more than six tracks at once, you should select 6-channel
mode  instead of 7 or 8-channel mode.  This both increases the execution speed and
gives you two non-split (i.e.  high quality) tracks (2 and 3).

If you load additional samples while in 5 - 8-channel mode, OctaMED usually halves
them  automatically.    However, if you are using some channels that aren't split,
you  can  override  halving  and  load  normal-volume  samples  for  the non-split
channels.  To do so, hold down the Shift key when:

a) clicking on a sample name in the Load Instrument Window
b) clicking Load Inst in the Sample List Editor window
c) selecting Load Instrument(s) from the Instr menu
d) clicking the getfile gadget on the top row of the upper screen

Volume limitations
------------------

Because  there  are  only  4 sound channels and 4 volume registers, pairs of split
channels must share each volume register.  Channels 0 and 4, 1 and 5, 2 and 6, and
3 and 7 each share one register.  This means that every volume command (C) affects
two tracks.  For example:

Track:     0         1         2         3         4
    000 C-1 30000 E-1 30000 G-1 30000 --- 00000 A#2 50C20

The  0C20  command  on track 4 affects both tracks 4 and 0.  The default volume of
instruments is ignored for this reason.


To those upgrading from version 4...

Welcome  to  another  version  of OctaMED!  Firstly: as I'm sure you'll know, this
version  and all subsequent versions will require Kickstart and Workbench 2.x "TM"
or  higher.    This  is because OctaMED now heavily depends on the new features in
Release  2  of  the  operating  system,  and  many  parts of the program have been
entirely  rewritten to take advantage of them.  As 2.04 upgrade packages have been
available  for  more  than 1½ years, it's a reasonable assumption that every truly
serious  Amiga®  user  has  the package available to them.  (Please note that THIS
disk  contains  WB  2.1  "TM").    However, OctaMEDPlayer is still compatible with
Kickstart  1.3  "TM"  to  allow  your  songs to be heard by as wide an audience as
possible.

So you've got your copy of V5.0, and you're probably wondering what has changed.

Well,  as  soon as you loaded OctaMED, you'll have noticed a huge change: the user
interface  has  been completely rewritten.  This not only gives the program a much
more  "friendly"  appearance,  but  it  enables  more  features to be added to the
program  more  easily.   While in OctaMED V4, gadgets had to be shrunk to make way
for new functions, in future versions a window simply needs to be enlarged.

Features removed in V5.0
------------------------

You'll notice that some features from V4 are missing in V5.0:

a)  The  DEP2  gadget  in  the  MISC  panel has been removed.  This is because the
OctaMED screen now always has 2 bitplanes (4 colors).

b)  The  LOADGFX  gadget  in  the MISC panel is missing, as there are now no extra
graphics files to load...

c)  There  was,  unfortunately, no space using the new interface for the E1 set of
equalizers.

d)  The  set  of Octaves gadgets in the EDIT panel and the Range dimensions in the
RANGE  panel  were  thought  to  be  no longer necessary, but they may return in a
future version.

e)  The  color  palette  is  no  longer  loaded  or  saved with songs.  Loading in
particular  would  have  certainly caused problems with songs created with earlier
versions  of  OctaMED: imagine what the new interface would look like with the old
black - white - dark gray - light gray palette!

f)  The  old  status  bar  action  of clicking a digit with either mouse button to
increase  / decrease the digit no longer exists (it is a "non- standard" function,
and  clicking  with  the  right  mouse  button  would  interfere with the new menu
system).

For  those who have become used to this operation, here are some relevant keyboard
shortcuts:

Decrease / increase playseq position:  Ctrl - 8 / 2 (numeric keypad)
Decrease / increase block number:      Shift - <up> / <down>
Decrease / increase instrument number: Shift - <left> / <right>
Decrease / increase song number:       Ctrl - ( / ) (numeric keypad)

g)  The Left Alt programmable keys definition has unfortunately had to be removed,
since Left Alt is now the gadget shortcut qualifier (see Keyboard Shortcuts).

h) The instrument default volume's hex display has been (temporarily?) removed.

New features in V5.0
--------------------

a) Maximum sizes increased:

*  64 tracks in a block (you're also not limited to multiples of 4)
*  1000 blocks in a song
*  999 entries in a playing sequence
*  MIDI Preset range (1 - 2800), only works with some devices
*  1048560 bytes in a MIDI message (should be enough for most use!)

b) New list windows:

*  Song Selector displays all songs
*  Block List displays all blocks

c) Sample editor options:

*  Change volume: fade in/out, halve, double, don't clip (prevents distortion)
*  Anti-alias when changing pitch can be turned off
*  Cancel finetune (removes finetune value from a sample)
*  Set volumes of source and destination when mixing
*  Set density of pixels in pixel display mode
*  Invert: turns the range upside-down
*  Chop: deletes the whole sample except the range
*  Remove Unused Space: deletes space (of zero volume) from either side of 
   the sample
*  Create Chord: creates chords of 2 - 4 notes from a sample
*  Play Buffer Contents: plays the copy buffer at the current pitch
*  Sample Voice Monitor: optionally turns off hearing the input signal while 
   digitizing (may enhance quality on slower machines)
*  Clicking Digitize when Buffsize = 0 automatically creates a buffer (of 
   131072 bytes or the largest available if no memory)

d) Sample list editor options:

*  Instrument Load Window allows easy loading of samples in list
*  Stores tuning / MIDI / default volume values and default pitch as well 
   as loop
*  Add directories anywhere in list (not just to end)

e) Playing sequence:

*  Can create multiple playing sequences (sections), and choose the order in 
   which these sections are played in the Section List
* "Clear playing sequence" button
*  Now also displays block names
* "Follow" gadget automatically updates the list so that the current position
   is as close to the middle as possible

f) New save options:

*  A new file format (MMD2), saves song sections
*  Song  compression,  using  PowerPacker  or SFCD compression.  SFCD is a packing
   format  used  in  Stephan  Fuhrmann's PowerPlayer module player program, and it
   usually  crunches  modules slightly more tightly than PowerPacker.  It requires
   lh.library  for use, which is distributed with OctaMED under agreement with the
   copyright owners.  (PowerPlayer can be found on Fish disk 769)
*  Song size calculation
*  Save Timer emulates "auto-save" option of many wordprocessors

g) New editing functions:

*  Generic Slide creates a slide with any kind of player command (use as Volume 
   Slide except with a different player command)
*  Flush all unused instruments
*  Highlighting: starting offset and custom spacing options
*  Insert / delete tracks throughout the song
*  Automatically cancels range after an operation. Also, you now cancel a range by 
   simply clicking the mouse button on the editor

h) New instrument type: ExtSamples (an extra two lower octaves)

i) More settings:

*  Display max tracks: maximum tracks on-screen at once (4, 8, 16)
*  Left,  middle  and  right  mouse button can be configured to turn normal/select
   tracks on/off, set cursor position, or mark range
*  Spacing options: destructive, auto-round (Keyboard Options)
*  Turn  automatic flushing of unused instruments on/off when clearing the current
   song of a multi-module
*  Auto-Freeze  Screen:  automatically  turns screen updating off when the OctaMED
   screen is not the frontmost
*  Play After Loading: automatically starts playing directly after loading a song,
   useful for listening to other people's songs
*  AGA-compatible palette

j) Many new keyboard shortcuts, including some new editing functions

k) Smaller functions:

* Arrow gadgets select the previous / next set of tracks to allow all 64 tracks to
  be  used, in the upper screen, Track Volumes window and Notation Control window.
  Shift-clicking  the  gadgets  select  the first / last set of tracks used in the
  current block
*  A Project menu option to display the last title bar message
*  Can  also  change  an  instrument  into  a  synthetic sound by choosing Project
   menu/New Synthsound in the synth editor
*  Synthsound programming editing: the cursor no longer moves down beyond END; and
   inserting  any  command  except  HLT and RES (which don't take parameters) also
   inserts a new 00 value.
*  Shift-clicking  (clicking  with  Shift  held) the waveform arrow gadgets in the
   synth editor selects the first / last waveform
*  Shift-clicking  one  of the track gadgets in the upper screen "solos" the track
   (clears all tracks except the one selected)
*  Shift-clicking Cont Song continues song from top line of block
*  Shift-clicking Space turns spacing on and opens Keyboard Options (with a view to
   editing the spacing options)
*  A gadget to quickly select the current block for printing
*  Can  close  then  reopen  the  notation  editor's  options window using Display
   menu/Notation Control Window

l) Other new features:

*  Fully  localizable under Workbench 2.1 "TM" (the required 2.1 files are on this
   disk, or later.  (WB 2.04 "TM" users can now use the Locale program which is in
   Prefs on Disk2).
*  You can set a default pitch (note) for each instrument, which will be played and
   entered  at  that  pitch  when the "F" key is pressed.  Very useful for untuned
   instruments such as percussion
*  Can  load  more  than  one  instrument  at  a time: instruments are loaded into
   consecutive slots, starting at the current slot
*  Clicking  the  timer reset gadget ("R") stores the current song position, which
   can be recalled by clicking the timer itself
*  The High Quality switch now doesn't decrease the tempo
*  Supports  multiple  settings  and  programmable keys files (on startup, OctaMED
   attempts to load "S:OctaMEDPro.config" and "S:OctaMEDPro.defkeys")
*  On-line  help  provided  by pressing the Help key (you'll probably have already
   found  this  out  for  yourself ;-)

m)  Of  course,  numerous  bug  and  quirk  fixes,  including commands 19 and FF3,
    commands  FFD  and  FFF  in 5-8 channel mode, the effect of changing the block
    size  on  line highlighting and block names, intelligent sample halving (won't
    request  to  halve  samples  if  they are already halved) and many other small
    fixes.

Some  of  the  small  fixes  are:  if  an  instrument had a Hold value above zero,
entering  a  note  with  that  instrument and with spacing on cut the note a split
second  after  it  was  played;  entering a note with Space and Chord mode both on
advanced only one line; playing a range two bytes long (sample editor) appeared to
play  the  entire  chip memory!; Spread Notes also spread blank notes (--- 00000);
"advance  with  sound"  (loudspeaker gadget on the EDIT panel) played notes on all
tracks,  regardless  of the tracks' on/off status; you can no longer use a spacing
value of 1 (admit it, it was a bit useless :^).

One  bug of note: the "intelligent" sample loader added way back in MED 2.10 (July
1990)  is  finally  *  REALLY * intelligent!!  :^) (It can calculate the number of
grains  of sand on Planet Earth within 3.8 seconds, work out who will be Wimbledon
champion in the year 2064, design the world's first pear-shaped Cadillac, and even
eat  a  whole  plum  without spilling a single drop of juice :'D ).  Seriously, it
promises  never  to request a sample disk more than once while loading songs saved
without their instruments.

In  addition,  the  old  "octamed.config"  file  can't be loaded by V5.0.  This is
because  the  format  of the config file has once again changed, but hopefully for
the  last  time  (since  the file is now a plain text file).  You need to recreate
your  old preferences using V5.0, then save the settings using the Settings menu. 
(A  list  of  the settings saved with the "OctaMEDPro.config" file is given in The
Settings  File.    Note  that the programmable keys definitions are now saved in a
separate file called "OctaMEDPro.defkeys", see the Programmable Keys window.

This  list  should  have covered all features new to V5.0, but throughout the help
file  the  word  ""  emphasizes these new features.  This doesn't include keyboard
shortcuts listed in the main documentation (there are too many of them!).


Keyboard shortcuts
------------------

Almost  all  shortcuts  involving  Right Amiga have been either removed or changed
from  version 4, since Right Amiga is now used as a menu shortcut qualifier only. 
(The  only  exceptions  are  Amiga-X/C/V,  which  remain  as in V4: cut/copy/paste
track).  The changes are:

Amiga-L        (Load Song)     Now Amiga-O
Amiga-P        (Play Song)     Now Left Alt-P (with main screen active)
Amiga-T        (Slide type 1)  Now Ctrl-T
Shift-Amiga-T  (Slide type 2)  Now Shift-Ctrl-T
Amiga-O        (Volume slide)  Now Ctrl-O

Shift-Amiga-X/C/V  has  been changed to Shift-Alt-X/C/V for compatibility with the
new  interface  (holding Shift and choosing Cut, Copy or Paste from the Track menu
would  have  affected  the  _block_  instead!).  Aside from X/C/V, all other Amiga
shortcuts have been removed.

Ctrl-F1-F10 and Alt-keypad shortcuts have also been removed.


A final word
------------

So  although  there  are  many  new  features,  you  should become used to the new
interface  fairly  quickly.  You could first of all read the user interface topic,
then  scan  through  all  the  menus  and  windows  in the program, noting the new
positions  of  V4's  functions and referring to the appropriate topic in this help
file if you discover anything you don't recognize.

Remember  that  any  menu item with the suffix "..." opens a window, and also that
there  is  a  menu bar attached to the sample, synthsound and sample list editors,
and  the Notation Control window!  Finally note that the right mouse button can no
longer  be  used  to select a range in the tracker, sample and synthsound editors:
the left mouse button now usually does this.

We  hope  you  find  the  new version useful, and also Kickstart 2.04 or higher if
you've just upgraded it really is well worth buying the complete 2.04 upgrade set,
IF you can find a supplier, ( especialy in the UK ).


The User Interface

The  "user interface" is the means by which the computer and user communicate.  In
OctaMED, this is done by using windows, menus and gadgets.

The user interface has been completely rewritten in OctaMED Pro V5.0, which should
make the program look a little less complicated and be easier and more "intuitive"
to  use.   ("Intuitive" means that the various controls behave as you would expect
them to).

"Gadgets"  are  graphics symbols used for communication with the program, and this
topic describes the various different sorts of gadget (which are handled using the
computer's "GadTools" library).

For  information  about using the windows and menus, please refer to your Amiga®'s
user  manual.    There  are  two  points  of note, however, about OctaMED's window
handling.   Firstly, notes can't be entered or deleted while any window is active,
even  when  editing  is switched on: you must activate the main screen.  Secondly,
the  right mouse button is equivalent to clicking the window's zoom gadget (except
in  the  sample,  synthetic sound and sample list editors and the Notation Control
window, when it displays the window's menu bar).

A  quick word about the screen: OctaMED's screen uses AutoScroll, which means that
if  you  have dragged its screen down, you may drag it back up again by moving the
mouse pointer off the very bottom of the screen.

(Note  that  the  words  "gadget"  and "button" essentially mean the same; "click"
means  "press  and  release the left mouse button quickly"; and "drag" means "hold
down the left mouse button while moving the mouse").


Action buttons
--------------

These  are  the simplest form of gadget, as they just perform the activity labeled
on the button.  The button's appearance is a rectangular area that is raised, i.e.
it seems to "come out" of the screen.

Holding  down  the  left mouse button over the gadget "inverts" it, i.e.  turns it
blue.    Releasing  the  mouse  button performs the activity.  While the gadget is
inverted,  you  may  move  the  mouse pointer away from the gadget.  This makes it
non-inverted, and the function is said to be "canceled".

There is a special type of action button called a "GetFile" gadget.  It is a small
gadget  containing  an diagram of a list appearing from a folder.  Clicking on one
of these gadgets opens a file requester for a particular operation.

Examples of GetFile gadgets are in the upper screen and the Save and Print Options
windows.


Check boxes
-----------

These small square gadgets allow you to choose whether an option is "on" or "off".
When  on,  a "check" (or "tick") mark appears in the gadget, and when off, the box
is empty.  To turn the option on or off, simply click inside the gadget.


Radio buttons
-------------

These  gadgets consist of a set of small circular buttons, collectively known as a
"radio button", with which you select one option from a variety of options.  Radio
buttons  are  "mutually  exclusive",  meaning  that one and only one option may be
selected.    When  selected  (by  clicking  on  it),  the small button is recessed
(meaning it seems to "go into" the screen), and a blue circle appears inside it.


Cycle gadgets
-------------

These  gadgets are equivalent in function to radio buttons, but only one option is
visible  at  a  time.    They look like action buttons, but with a "cycle" sign on
their  left-hand  side.  The various options are cycled through by clicking inside
the  gadget.    Shift-clicking  them  (clicking them with the Shift key held down)
cycles through the options backwards.

In  this  help  file, the default setting of each radio button and cycle gadget is
documented.


Text and numerical boxes
------------------------

Also  called  "string  and  integer  gadgets",  these appear as rectangles with an
embellished  black  and  white border.  With them you may type in text and numbers
(in appearance there is no difference between text boxes and numerical boxes).

The  boxes  are  "activated"  by  clicking  inside  them,  and a small blue cursor
appears.    You may edit the text or number inside the box simply by typing.  When
you  have  finished  editing,  make  sure you press the Return key so that OctaMED
accepts  the  new  information.  Keyboard shortcuts that you may use while editing
are:

<left / right>  Move cursor left / right
Backspace       Delete "character" (letter or number) to left of cursor
Del             Delete character at cursor

Shift-<left>    Move to beginning of box
Shift-<right>   Move to end of box

Amiga-X         Delete box's contents
Amiga-Q         Restore box's contents

Ctrl-A          Move to beginning of box
Ctrl-Z          Move to end of box
Ctrl-X          Delete box's contents (like Amiga-X)
Ctrl-H          Delete character to left of cursor (like Backspace)
Ctrl-U or W     Delete from cursor to beginning of box
Ctrl-K          Delete from cursor to end of box
Ctrl-M          Accept edited information (like Return)

In  addition,  the  Tab  key  accepts  the  edited  information  (like Return) and
activates  the  next  text  or numerical box in the window.  Shift-Tab accepts and
activates the previous box.


Sliders
-------

Sliders  are rectangular gadgets that contain another small black rectangle.  This
small  rectangle  is  known  as the slider's "knob", and the rest of the gadget is
called  the "slider box".  Above, below, to the left or to the right of the gadget
is  a  number  (called  the "slider value"), and the gadget is used to increase or
decrease the slider value.

The  slider  value  is usually changed by dragging the knob.  However, clicking in
the  slider box increases or decreases the value by one (depending on where in the
box  you  click).   There may be arrows beside the slider; in which case, clicking
them increases or decreases the value by one.


Scrolling lists
---------------

These are used to display a list of different names of objects.  Examples of lists
are  in  the  Playing  Sequence  window,  the Instrument Load Window, and the Song
Selector window.

They  consist of a box containing the list itself, a scroll gadget to the right of
the  list, and sometimes a display box (see later) or text box underneath the list
that shows the currently selected item in the list.

A scroll gadget is like a slider, but by dragging the black rectangle you move the
list  up or down.  Clicking in the scroll box moves the list one page up or down. 
Items in the list are selected simply by clicking on them.


Display boxes
-------------

These  are  the  only  type  of  gadget  listed in this topic that you can't click
inside!  They simply display information, and they appear as recessed boxes.

One  more  thing you should know about: ghosting.  This is when a gadget or a menu
item becomes checkered, and it means that it can't be selected.  This happens, for
example,  to  the  slider  in  the  Programmable  Keys  window  when the Right Alt
definition is being shown.

For the keyboard shortcuts used with gadgets, see Gadget Shortcuts.


Installation


This  topic describes which files OctaMED uses when starting up, for those wishing
to properly install the program on a hard disk or a different floppy disk.

***  If  you  wish  to  install  OctaMED on a hard disk you can, of course, simply
double-click  the  Copy_To_Hard_Drive  icon  in the utilities drawer of this disk,
ensuring  that  your  hd is titled as WORK!!  If you copy the files manually, then
from  from  disk  2 you will need to copy OctaMED.Guide across to your chosen hard
disk  directory,  and also the OctaMED.config to your S directory, If you don't do
this, the OctaMED.guide won't be opened when pressing the Help key.

This  disk  contains  the NEW WB 2.1 "TM" files (in the C: and LIBS: drawers).  If
you are using WB 3.0 "TM" (supplied with the A1200/A4000 Amigas®), you may replace
the  2.1 files with your 3.0 files if you wish.  This is not necessary, though, as
the WB 2.1 "TM" files will work perfectly under Kickstart 3.0.

The only files that OctaMED actually requires to start up are version 37 or higher
of asl.library and iffparse.library, in either the current or the LIBS: directory.
If  the  following  other  files  are  also  installed, however, OctaMED will take
advantage of them:

 OctaMEDPro.defkeys |              S:              | Default program. keys

Remember  that  you  can  also  store these files in directories other than S: and
LIBS: using the "Assign" command.  For example:

        Assign S: <path name> Add

where  <path name> is the path of the directory where you wish to store the sample
list and the default settings / programmable keys files.


SPECIAL PURPOSE NODES


The File Requester

The  file  requester  is  used  to  handle and select files.  OctaMED supports the
system-integrated  ASL  file  requester  (please refer to your Amiga®'s manual for
information).    You  may  also use, ON A COPY, file requesters that automatically
replace  the ASL file requester, for example ReqTools (when the RTPatch program is
run) and the Magic File Requester.

OctaMED  has two special features in all operations involving saving.  Firstly, an
"Overwrite?"  requester appears if the file OctaMED is trying to save has the same
name  as  another  file  in  the directory.  Secondly, you can't double-click on a
filename  like  you  can  when  loading:  you need to use the "Ok" gadget instead.
These two features go some way to prevent accidental file deletion.


The Settings File

The settings file is saved by choosing Settings Menu/Save Settings.  The following
options are saved (values in brackets are default):

* Save Options window:

- Save Secondary Data (ON)
- Create Icons (ON)
- Save Notation Data (OFF)

* The Save Timer value (0)

* Sample Editor:

   - Line display (ON)
   - Pixel display (OFF)
   - Pixel Density (2)
   - Sampler Voice Monitor (OFF)
   - Pitch period (428)
   - Don't Clip (Change Volume window) (OFF)

* The "Auto-Terminate Capture" gadget in the MIDI message editor (ON)

* The "Follow" gadget in the Playing Sequence window (OFF)

* Mouse Options window:

   - Left Button (SELECT RANGE)
   - Middle Button (NO OPERATION)
   - Right Button (NO OPERATION)

* Keyboard Options window:

   - Advance Line (DOWN)
   - Advance Track (DON'T ADVANCE)
   - Advance Cursor (DON'T ADVANCE)
   - Keypad Mode (TRACKS ON/OFF)
   - Keypad Mapping (ALTERNATIVE)
   - Space Value (2)
   - Chord Reset (ON)
   - Space = DEL (OFF)
   - Protracker Shortcuts (OFF)
   - Advance with sound (OFF)
   - Destructive Spacing (ON)
   - Auto-Round Spacing (ON)

* Palette window:

   - The color scheme (WORKBENCH COLORS)
   - Palette Type (8-Bit)

* Instr menu:

   - Automatic Flush (OFF)
   - Add Path (OFF)
   - Remove Path (OFF)

* Note killing options in the MIDI menu

* Settings menu:

   - Display Max Tracks (16)
   - Equalizers (both ON)
   - H -> B (ON)
   - Auto-Freeze Screen (OFF)

In  addition,  OctaMED  will  save  the  current window positions (both zoomed and
unzoomed) if you have moved them from their usual positions.

The default settings file name is "S:OctaMEDPro.config".


Tracker Modules

There is a substantial amount of information lost if you choose to save in Tracker
Module format.  This information is:

** Synthetic, hybrid and MIDI instruments
** Multi-octave samples (including ExtSamples)
** Some block contents (no lines above 64, no tracks above 4, no notes above B-3)
** Player commands 8, E and 10
** Instruments above 0V
 * All instrument parameters apart from Repeat and RepLen (Loop On, Transpose, 
   Finetune, ** Hold and Decay, default volume, MIDI parameters)
 * Multi-modules (only the current song will be saved)
 * 5-8 channels
 * Song sections (converted to one playing sequence as described in the Save 
   Options Window)
 * MIDI Messages, the state of the MIDI Active switch
 * Relative track volumes
 * Block names
 * Line highlighting
 * Annotation text
 * Notation Editor data
 * Decimal / Hex Volumes (converted to hex volumes)

(The  information which is given in the requester brought up when trying to save a
Tracker module is marked above with a **).

Note  that the resulting file is a 31-instrument module, incompatible with Tracker
programs only supporting old 15-instrument modules.


Protracker commands
-------------------

Many  player  commands  are  converted  when  saving  Tracker  modules and loading
Protracker modules.  They are:

   OctaMED command | Protracker command
   ----------------+-------------------
         0D        |         A
         0FF8      |         E11
         0FF9      |         E12
         11        |         E1
         12        |         E2
         13        |         3
         14        |         4
         15        |         E5
         16        |         E6
         18        |         EC
         19        |         9
         1A        |         EA
         1B        |         EB
         1C        |         C    (saving only)
         1D        |         D
         1E        |         EE
         1F        | Digit 1 ED, digit 2 E9  (loading just converts ED)

When  loading,  commands E3 and E4 are ignored.  When saving, commands 8, E and 10
are ignored.


Hexadecimal Values

"Hexadecimal"  (or  "hex"  for  short)  is  basically  just  a  different   way of
representing  numbers.   It is more convenient for the computer because of the way
it works, and allows the user to specify a greater range of numbers using the same
amount of digits.

Hex values are used in the player commands, synth editor, the secondary tempo, and
the  MIDI  message  editor.    So  they're quite important in OctaMED (and also in
general computing).

In  the  usual decimal system, a digit can be ten different values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.

In  the hex system, however, a digit may have sixteen values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7,  8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F.  The decimal numbers 10 - 15 are represented by the
letters A to F:

    Decimal 10  =  A
            11  =  B
            12  =  C
            13  =  D
            14  =  E
            15  =  F

With  two  digits  in  a  number,  the  decimal system can represent 10 × 10 = 100
different  values.    The hex system, however, can represent 16 × 16 = 256 values:
over twice the amount of the decimal system.  (The lowest number is 00 = zero, and
the highest number is FF = 255 decimal).


Converting between the two systems
----------------------------------

So although it feels strange to work in at first, it has its advantages.  In a two
digit  hex  number (e.g.  8A), the first digit represents multiples of 16.  So, to
convert a two-digit hex number to decimal:

        Decimal number = (Hex digit 1) × 16 + (hex digit 2)

And  to  convert decimal to hex, divide the decimal number by 16.  The quotient is
hex digit 1, the remainder is hex digit 2.

For example:

    Hex 8A -> decimal:

             Hex digit 1 = 8, hex digit 2 = A (10).

             Decimal number = (8 × 16) + 10 = * 106 *.

    Decimal 200 -> hex:

             200 ÷ 16 = 12 remainder 8.

             Hex digit 1 = C (12), hex digit 2 = 8.

             So hex number = * C8 *.

Hex numbers are sometimes distinguished from decimal numbers by preceding hex with
a "$" sign.  For example: $C8, $FF.


Signed hexadecimal
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
There  is a further complication!  Luckily in OctaMED you'll only need to use this
in  two  player  commands:  MIDI  command  3 (set pitchbender) and command 15 (set
finetune).

The  "sign"  of  a number denotes whether the number is positive or negative: that
is, the "+" and "-" signs.

In  hexadecimal,  however,  there  are  no  "-"  signs.   So, negative numbers are
represented by positive numbers (it will become clearer!).

In  signed  hex,  the  numbers $00 - $7F are positive as usual: they represent the
decimal  numbers  0  -  127.  However, the numbers $80 - $FF represent the decimal
values -1 to -128:

    Decimal   -1  =  $FF
              -2  =  $FE
              -3  =  $FD
              -4  =  $FC
             ...
             -16  =  $F0
             -17  =  $EF
             -18  =  $EE
             ...
            -126  =  $82
            -127  =  $81
            -128  =  $80

So to convert negative decimal numbers to signed hex numbers, first add 256 to the
number, then convert to hex as above.  For example:

    Decimal -67 -> signed hex:

             -67 + 256 = 189.

             189 ÷ 16 = 11 remainder 13.

             Hex digit 1 = 11 (B), hex digit 2 = 13 (C)

             So signed hex number = * $BC *.


Hex  numbers  will  crop  up in many areas of computing, so if you've never worked
with them before, it's advisable to get used to them!
