Section 1  INTRODUCTION
------------------------

WELCOME to Lottery Winner - the program designed to help you win the National
Lottery. Those of you familiar with my previous programs will no doubt recognize
the similarity of the prediction method used here. I make no apologies for this.
The prediction engine employed is reliable and proven (several registered users
of Pools Tools have won amounts over £200, and many other users have won minor
dividends ). The prediction engine used in Lottery Winner has been tweaked
however to take into account the fact that only 6 numbers are required.

To get the best from Lottery Winner please read the instructions carefully. It
is important to be familiar with section 2.2 ( USER INTERFACE ). If you are
unfamiliar with the PPmore text viewer then please press the HELP key for a
command summary.


Section 2 STARTING LOTTERY WINNER

LOADING FROM WORKBENCH:

Section 2.1 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------------

Lottery Winner will work on any Amiga with 1Mb or more of memory.


Section 2.2 USER INTERFACE
----------------------------

Lottery Winner uses the Ncommand routines to provide a consistent user 
interface. There are three basic gadget types: BUTTON, CYLIC, and TEXT GADGET.

BUTTON GADGET
Button gadgets immediately initiates an action when you click on it. To use a
button place the mouse pointer over the button and click the left mouse key.

CYCLIC GADGET
When you must make a selection from one of several possible choices you will
encounter cyclic buttons. To make a choice click on the cyclic button to cycle
through all possible choices.

TEXT GADGET
These do not resemble buttons but appear as a rectangle surrounded by a
highlighted bevelled edge box. To enter text, or to change text already present
in the box, click inside the box and a blue cursor will appear. You can type or
edit information in the box in the usual manner. Pressing return will advance 
the cursor to the next text gadget as will pressing the down cursor key. 
Pressing the up cursor key will take you to the previous text gadget. Pressing 
escape will exit the input routine.

FILE REQUESTER
When the file requester appears the names of the files and directories in the
selected volume will appear in the window. Use the scroll bar to view all of the
files. Clicking on a directory will list all of the files it contains. To select
the file you require either double click on the filename or click once on the
filename and then click on either the LOAD or SAVE buttons. If you wish to 
change the volume then click the right mouse button. A list of all the volumes 
available will be displayed. Double click on the volume name to change to that 
directory.

The following abbreviations will appear in the instructions to denote gadget
types: BG ( Button Gadget ), CG ( Cyclic Gadget ), TG ( Text Gadget )

HOT KEYS

underlined in a BUTTON GADGET you may press that letter on the keyboard instead 
of clicking on the button.

becomes of less help when your database contains many weeks of results. If you 
wish to base your forecasts on recent trends it then becomes necessary to use 
the "BESTFIT" function. The program will the select the optimum number of weeks 
on which it bases the prediction. You need a database greater than 26 weeks to 
use this function.

Section 3.6 INFO
-------------------

Clicking on "INFO" will produce the info. screen. Select "CANCEL" to return to
the main menu.


Section 3.7 USING THE SEARCH REQUESTER
----------------------------------------

The search requester allows you to jump to a specific record and works in one of
two ways;

Search to Record ( Default ).
If not already selected click on the cyclic gadget till "RECORD" is displayed.
Type in the number of the record you wish to goto in the text gadget and click
on the SEARCH button. Providing that the record exists the program will now 
goto that record number.

Search to Week .
If not already selected click on the cyclic gadget till "WEEK" is displayed. 
Type in the string you wish to search for in the text gadget and click on the 
search button. The program will search the database for a match or partial 
match, and if found, goto that record.

If the search was unsuccessful then a "Not Found" message will be displayed.



Section 3.8 FULL REQUESTER
----------------------------

The full requester appears when you attempt to add a record above the number of
208. This figure represents four years of results.

When this requester appears the database will be reconfigured and you must take
the following action. Click on the "OK" gadget to clear the requester. A file
requester will now appear to give you the chance to save the current database.It
is advisable to save the database with a different file name to its previous 
one. The program will now take the last 53 weeks of data and make this data the
first 53 weeks of data in the new database. The database will now only be 53 
weeks long and you can continue to add data to it. You can now save this 
database as your default database. The program works in this way so that when 
you have to start a new database there will always be enough information in it 
to make predictions.

As an example let us suppose you have a database named "DEF.LOTT" which is 208
weeks long. You click on the "ADD" gadget to add another record and the Full
Requester appears. Click on the "OK" gadget to cancel this requester and a save
requester appears. Save your database with a different file name, for example,
"1990/94.LOTT". The database will be saved. The database will now be
reconfigured and you can now continue to add data. When you save the database
save it with your original file name i.e. "DEF.LOTT".



Section 3.9 THE DATABASE
--------------------------

The database is the most important element to Lottery Winner and it is vital to
ensure that you don't corrupt it. In practice this means you must update the
database each and every week. Any gaps between weeks in the database will
seriously impair the efficiency of the program. It only takes a few minutes each
week to maintain the database.

You need at least seven weeks of results in the database before the program can
start to make a valid prediction.


Section 3.10 SPECIFICATIONS
-----------------------------

Database                                       ....... Maximum = 208 Weeks
Amount of numbers returned by predict function ....... Maximum = 6
Amount of numbers returned by perm function    ....... Maximum = 30


Section 3.11 QUICK START
--------------------------

When Lottery Winner first loads it searches the disk for a database named
"DEF.LOTT", and if found, loads it into memory.For speed of use it is advisable
to name your current database "DEF.LOTT".


Section 3.12 UPGRADE
----------------------

Click on this gadget for Upgrade details. Please refer to Section 6 for further
information.


Section 4 LOTTERY WINNER ONLY
-------------------------------

The DEF.LOTT database supplied with Lottery Winner is for Demo purposes only. It
should not be used for predictions. To obtain an accurate database please refer
to Section 6.


Section 5 COMMON PROBLEMS
----------------------------

If the predict and Permutation functions do not return the amount of numbers you
requested it is because there are not enough weeks in the database.

If the search to week function fails to find the string you are after then you 
are probably already past that record. Remember that the program searches 
forward from its current position. Goto record 1 and try again.
