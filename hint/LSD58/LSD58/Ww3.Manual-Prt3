 DIGITA SCALABLE CLIP ART COLLECTION

 Scalable clip art is like a scalable font, it can be scaled to any size
and retains its perfect quality. When printing, because of its
scalability, the quality will be perfect and just as good as your scalable
outline fonts.

 Digita Scalable Clip Art is an excellent compliment to your Compugraphic
font collection.

 Wordworth 2 Upgraders: If you already use previous Digita clip art, it's
still Worth upgrading your collection to these new scalable versions.

 The following pages illustrate each collection:

 USING PAINT PACKAGES WITH WORDWORTH

 The transparent colour (which is usually surrounding the image, when
placing into be colour 0 in the paint package, which with DPaint, is in
top left corner of the DPaint palette and in Brilliance is the colour on
the far left.

 These tips may help you:

 step 1

 Draw or fill around the image with colour 0.

 step 2

 Select colour 0 using the Right Mouse key.

 step 3

 Cut out the image and

 If you are unsure about drawing, the instruction book supplied with your
paint package.

 When you place a picture in a Wordworth document in the "Picture
Information" requester, select the "Colour 0 Transparent" checkbox and
Flow to "Contour Left" or "Contour Right". (You can choose the "Picture
Information" requester by double-clicking the picture.)



 PRINTING PICTURES WITH WORDWORTH

 Wordworth provides excellent support for pictures, allowing you to place
them anywhere in a document, then re-size, arrange text to flow around the
picture, adjust their colours, and mix them with many styles and sizes of
font. However, although documents containing pictures usually look great
on-screen, when printing the quality can vary enormously. So, how do you
achieve the best results?

 BLACK AND WHITE PRINTERS

 Black and white printers are the most common, so we'll start with them.
Wordworth lets you print in two ways, either solid black and white, or
grey scaling. (These options are available using the "Print Setup"
command, Project menu.)

 BLACK AND WHITE

 This option prints solid areas of black or white. Pictures containing
various shades of greys or colours are printed all the light shades in
white and the darker shades in black.

 You can change the threshold where light colours become white and dark
colours become black, from the Amiga Preferences program, PrinterGFX.

 Page 265

 The Threshold can be set from 1 to 15. The lower its value, the more
colours will be printed as white, the higher the value, the more colours
will be printed as black. It is usually set at about 7 or 8.

 GREY SCALE

 Black and white printers can only print dots in black ink they can't
actually print 'greys'. Grey scale printing is achieved by using small
patterns of black dots and white space to produce an illusion of a grey
scale. The more black dots in the pattern, the darker the grey appears.
When printing in grey scales the pictures have their colours reproduced in
grey, which corresponds to the brightness of the colour.

 So, with Wordworth, the choice between printing using "Black And
White","Grey 1", or "Grey 2" depends on the type of pictures you have in
your document (select from Print command, Project menu). Most clip art,
like the Wordworth Clip Art Volume One, is drawn in just 2 colours (that
is, black on white), and should be printed using "Black And White".

 Other graphics which use many colours or grey shades (like the Wordworth
Clip Art Volume Two), should be printed using "Grey 1" or "Grey 2".
However, you may wish to experiment printing using "Black And White". It's
worth remembering that "Black and White" printing is faster since the
Amiga doesn't have to calculate the grey patterns (called 'dithers' or
'halftones').

 You can select the level of shading, (that is, "Grey 1",or "Grey 2"). It
is usually best to use "Grey 1", as "Grey 2" is a special type of grey
scaling designed for use when printing documents that have been designed
using a Commodore A2024 monochrome monitor.

 DENSITY

 How do you alter the quality of the printouts? Can they be made darker?
And, is there any way of improving the resolution, to avoid jagged edges
on pictures? The density of the dots used to print "Black And White",
"Grey 1" or "Grey 2" can be adjusted by using the Density slider gadget on
the "Print Setup" requester ("Print Setup" command, Project menu).

 Page 266

 The Density may be set from 1 to 7, which corresponds to the lowest
resolution Of your printer (for example, 120 dots per inch horizontally by
72 dots per inch vertically), up to the highest resolution (for example,
300dpi by 300dpi). Using a higher density setting will generally produce
higher quality printouts, particularly with grey scale printing, but there
are restrictions.

 On most dot matrix printers, high density printing is achieved by passing
the print head mechanism across the page several times, at slightly
different positions. For example, on a 9 pin printer, the 216dpi
resolution is achieved by first printing a line of dots at 72dpi, then
moving the print head down slightly, printing another line of dots at
72dpi over the first line, then repeating the procedure a third time,
giving a  'simulated' resolution of 216 dots per inch (this process is
called 'multi-pass' printing). However, because of the size of the pins of
the printer, the real resolution is less than this, and many of the dots
tend to overlap. Printing on dot matrix printers at high resolutions can
produce darker or 'muddier' results. In contrast, printouts at Density 1
can often look too light.

 However, because of the size of the pins of the printer, the real
resolution is less than this, and many of the dots tend to overlap.
Printing on dot matrix printers at high resolutions can produce darker or
'muddier' results. In contrast, printouts at Density 1 can often look too
light.

 The best way around this problem is to experiment with the Density
settings to find the highest density which prints, without looking too
dark. Better printers, like laser printers, do not require multi-pass
printing to produce high density, so you can use the highest density
setting without any degradation in quality. The only drawback is that high
density printing takes longer.

 AMAZING TECHNICOLOUR

 Because of the way that colour is produced, the quality is rarely as good
as equivalent black and white printers and the cost is usually higher.

 First, when placing pictures in your document, try to avoid pictures
which use very dark colours, particularly black and dark blue, as these
will quickly wear out the black ink in your printer (black is the most
used of the 4 primary inks in colour printers, the other colours are
Magenta, Cyan and Yellow).

 Page 267

 When printing, use the Print command to set Shade to Colour and set
Density to a low value from the "Print Setup" command. Although setting
the Density higher should produce higher resolution printouts, on most
colour dot matrix printers, which use multi-pass printing at higher
density, it simply makes the printouts much darker and muddier. It can
also make the colour ribbon dirty by getting black print onto the yellow
ribbon area. A Density of 1 or 2 is best.

 BETTER QUALITY BITMAP PRINTING

 The best way to print a picture, avoiding the "jaggies" is to create the
picture in your paint package four or five times bigger than you want to
print it.

 When placing the picture into your Wordworth document, you should create
a "Picture Frame" using the "Picture Frame" object ("Create Object"
command, Object menu) and then choose "Place Picture" to place the picture
inside the frame. Wordworth will shrink the picture to the size of the
frame which can be moved and sized like any other object.

 When printing Wordworth will (like scalable fonts) scale the picture up
four times bigger to match the printer's resolution and as the picture's
original size is that big, the printout will be perfect.


 DIGITA PRINT MANAGER

 To get the best performance from your printer, and if you have a hard
disk drive, be sure to install Digita Print Manager (this may already be
intruded with your Amiga computer).

 Digita Print Manager provides the very latest printer driver technology
to fully support and utilise your printer's capabilities.

 Contact Digita for further details if this useful program is not already
included with your Amiga.

                            APPENDIX D - FONTS

 SCALABLE FONTS

 Agfa Compugraphic, PostScript and TrueType fonts use mathematical
descriptions of the outlines of each character in a font (lines and
curves) to generate the font in any point size.

 As you request a size and start typing, the font is generated in real-
time. Therefore, a scalable font is stored as a file containing this
description, rather than a separate file for each point size of the font.

 These fonts are listed in the Font requester (Font command, Format menu).
As you type, a bit-mapped screen font is generated in real-time for the
desired size. You can choose any size by typing the new value in the Size
box. When the font appears, you will notice that no matter what size you
choose, there are no jagged edges. You set the type of font which appears
in the Font requester using the "Text Settings" requester ("Change
Settings" command, Settings menu).



 INSTALLING ADDITIONAL AGFA COMPUGRAPHIC FONTS

 Wordworth will work with any Agfa Compugraphic or 100% compatible font.
This may include Workbench 2 / 3 fonts, George Thompson fonts, public
domain fonts and font libraries from Gold Disk Inc. Agfa font packs are
available direct from Digita.

 IMPORTANT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 FAIS Agfa fonts: All FAIS Agfa fonts will probably be in PC format and
will therefore require an MSDOS convertor, such as CrossDos.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 You can either install additional fonts for use with Wordworth or tell
Wordworth to share the fonts already installed by ProPage, Workbench or
any other program.

 To install new fonts onto your hard disk, you must first copy the
appropriate font files (.type, .lib or .typ) into the Intellifont drawer,
which is situated in the WwFonts drawer on your hard disk, and then run
the lnstallOutlines program, with no tooltype set, from the WwTools
drawer.

 To share fonts with programs like ProPage, you will need to select the
lnstallOutlines program, choose Information (Workbench-Icons menu) and
alter the FONTPATH= tooltype to point to the location of the fonts.
Double-click the InstallOutlines program to install the fonts in the
destination specified by the tooltype for use with Wordworth 3.

 Page 269

 On floppy disk, you will need to either copy the appropriate font files
into the Intellifont drawer on the WW3Outlines disk, change the FONTPATH
tooltype on the InstallOutlines program (WwTools drawer, Ww3Extras disk)
to FONTPAPTH=WW3Outlines; Intellifont, press the Return key and click
Save. Double-click the icon to install the fonts

 Alternatively, if you have a disk full of public domain fonts that you
wish to use with Wordworth 3, change the tooltype on the InstallOutlines
program to point to this disk and then double-click the icon (for example,
a disk called AgfaFonts1 with some fonts in a drawer, Intellifont on the
disk, will need a tooltype FONTPATH=AgfaFonts1: Intellifont). The fonts
and their location will be installed for use with Wordworth.



 INSTALLING ADDITIONAL POSTSCRIPT TYPE 1 FONTS

 You can either install additional fonts for use with Wordworth or

 tell Wordworth to share the fonts already installed by ProPage or

 any other program.

 To install new fonts onto your hard disk, you must first copy the
 appropriate font files (.pfb) into the PostScript drawer, which is

 situated in the WwFonts drawer on your hard disk, and then run

 the InstallOutlines program from the WwTools drawer_

 To share fonts with programs like ProPage, you will need to select the
lnstallOutlines program, choose Information (Workbench-Icons menu) and
alter the FONTPATH=tooltype to point to the location of the fonts_ Double-
click the lnstallOutlines program to install the fonts in the destination
specified by the tooltype for use with Wordworth 3.

 On floppy disk you will need to either copy the appropriate font files
into the PostScript drawer on the Ww3Outlines disk, change the FONTPATH
tooltype on the lnstallOutlines program WwTools drawer, Ww3Extras disk) to
FONTPATH=Ww3Outlines: PostScript, press the Return key and click Save.
Double-click the icon to install the fonts.

 Alternatively, if you have a disk full of public domain fonts that you
wish to use with Wordworth 3, change the tooltype on the InstallOutlines
program to point to this disk and then double-click the icon (for example,
a disk called Postfonts will need a tooltype FONTPATH=Postfonts;). The
fonts and their location will be installed for use with Wordworth.

 Page 270



 INSTALLING ADDITIONAL TRUETYPE FONTS

 You can either install additional fonts for use with Wordworth or tell
Wordworth to Share the fonts already installed by any other program.

 To install new fonts onto your hard disk, you must first copy the
appropriate font files (.ttf) into the TrueType drawer, which is situated
in the WwFonts drawer on your hard disk, and then run the InstallOutlines
program from the WwTools drawer.

 To share fonts with other programs, you will need to select the
InstallOutlines program, choose information (Workbench-Icons menu) and
alter the FONTPATH=tooltype to point to the location of the fonts. Double-
click the InstallOutlines program to install the fonts in the destination
specified by the tooltype for use with Wordworth 3.

 On floppy disk, you will need to either copy the appropriate font files
into the TrueType drawer on the Ww3Outlines disk, change the
FONTPATH=tooltype on the lnstallOutlines program (WwTools drawer,
Ww3Extras disk) to FONTPATH=Ww3Outlines: TrueType, press the Return key
and click Save. Double-click the icon to install the fonts. Alternatively,
if you have a disk full of public domain fonts that you wish to use with
Wordworth 3, change the tooltype on the lnstallOutlines program to point
to this disk and then double-click the icon (for example, a disk called
Truetypefonts will need a tooltype FONTPATH=Truetypefonts:). The fonts and
their location will be installed for use with Wordworth.



 BITMAP FONTS

 Amiga fonts are 'bit-mapped'. This means that they are constructed from a
pattern of dots which are stored in the computer as Binary Digits (BITS).
This pattern of dots is referred to as a 'map' of 'bits', hence the term
'bit-mapped'.

 Each size of a bit-mapped Amiga font is stored on disk in a separate
file. A font may have been pre-drawn in 3 sizes, for example, 8, 16, 32
points. To use sizes (other than those which have been pre-drawn), the
computer has to 'scale' one of the bit-maps, and create a bit-mapped
version of the size you want.

 This scaling process tends to produce jagged-looking fonts when they are
increased in size. This explains why Amiga fonts can produce rather poor
quality printouts-although they look good on-screen, when printing, they
are scaled to the dot resolution of the printer.

 Page 271



 COLOUR FONTS

 ColorFonts are a variation on standard bitmap fonts. Normal bitmap fonts
are designed in one colour. Wordworth lets you type standard bitmap fonts
in a variety of colours (by choosing the desired pen colour from the Font
requester), but each letter of the font is composed of one solid colour.

 ColorFonts may contain a character composed of up to 16 colours.
ColorFonts are listed in the Font requester in the same way as bitmap
fonts (provided the "Bitmap Fonts" check box is selected from the "Next
Settings' requester).

 Unless you have a screen mode that is capable of displaying more than 16
colours, the font will not appear on-screen in the colours it will use
when printing. This is because ColorFonts cannot be re-mapped to the
available colours easily.

 ColorFonts are still bit-mapped, just like bitmap fonts, and are
therefore subject to the same scaling limitations and ragged edges when
printing.



 PRINTER FONTS

 Using the internal fonts of your printer is much faster and can produce
print of a high quality, albeit with less variation in font range and
size. Most modern printers come supplied with a range of fonts built-in.
These fonts usually print out at the printer's highest resolution, The
Wordworth printer installation lets you install a printer driver and
special 'printer font' files for your printer. These files tell Wordworth
how to use the internal printer fonts in your printer.

 To print a document using internal printer fonts, use the "Print Method-
Printer Font' on the "Print Setup" requester (Project menu). The Font
requester (when the "Print Method"-"Printer Font" button is selected),
lists the names of the fonts, which are prefixed by the letters WW
followed by name of your printer, For example, the internal fonts for the
Panasonic KXP2180 printer are listed as: WW KX-P2180_ Bold, WW KX-
P2180_Courier_Prop, and so on.

 The fonts can be selected just like bitmap fonts, and text typed on-
screen using them. Wordworth uses the default outline font to depict the
printer font. Therefore, the font may look a little different on paper,
but the alignment of the on-screen text will be correct. Different fonts
and sizes can be mixed on the same page, even on the same line.

 When using internal printer fonts, we recommended that you keep to 6 lpi
or 8 lpi line spacing (Paragraph command, Format menu).

 AGFA COMPUGRAPHIC FONT COLLECTION

 Although Wordworth is easily capable of producing posters, invitations,
newsletters and presentations, to do this effectively, you'll probably
need extra fonts.

 There are many low-cost clone fonts available but they simply don't match
the quality of genuine, more expensive Agfa Compugraphic fonts.

 And So, from the massive Agfa font library, we have individually selected
a range of fonts for their quality and suitability with Wordworth (the
following pages illustrate each collection).

 We have exclusively negotiated this special arrangement with Agfa to
bring you the best quality and best value. However, as we are sure you'll
appreciate, these prices are only  available to registered users of
Wordworth:

                      APPENDIX E-POSTSCRIPT PRINTERS

 INTRODUCTION

 PostScript is a computer programming language, produced by the American
company, Adobe Systems.

 The language is specially designed to describe printed pages comprising
text and graphics. It is used by applications, such as Wordworth, to
produce a description of a printed document, which is then sent to a
'PostScript compatible' printer using the PostScript language to produce
the printout.

 PostScript describes the printed page in terms of lines, curves and
shapes, in a similar way to the Agfa Compugraphic fonts. This means that
the page is drawn at the printer's highest resolution, with no ragged
edges on scaled fonts. PostScript fonts are similar to Agfa Compugraphic
fonts, but they use the PostScript language to describe the shapes of
their characters.

 Agfa Compugraphic fonts are generated by the computer and translated into
bit-mapped graphics, which are then sent to the printer. Sending this
amount of information is slow, particularly when printing at high
resolution. With PostScript, only the description of the page (lines,
curves, names and sizes of desired fonts) is sent to the printer. The
printer then takes the time to generate the bit-map which it prints, thus
the computer is free to carry on with other task.

 The second advantage of PostScript is its complete flexibility. Owing to
its dependence on just a description of the page (in terms of simple
programming commands), PostScript can be instructed to perform very fancy
effects, such as rotating or stretching text. Such effects are produced by
the PostScript printer, removing the burden from the application.

 Most expensive laser printers and typesetting machines use PostScript and
generally include a built-in set of 35 standard PostScript fonts.
Wordworth provides full support for printing to PostScript printers and
allows you to use all 35 fonts.



 SETUP

 When a PostScript printer is selected for installation, then 'screen
fonts' will also be installed (on your hard disk) for the standard
PostScript fonts. (Floppy disk users do not have enough room on their
disks to install the relevant screen fonts) and therefore cannot use
PostScript.

 Page 279

 These fonts are simply Amiga bit-mapped fonts in various sizes, which
correspond in design to the 35 PostScript fonts used in PostScript
printers. Special 'printer font' files are also installed which describe
the exact widths of the characters in the fonts so that Wordworth can
align the text Correctly on screen.

 IMPORTANT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Before you can use the PostScript fonts you must set the "Print Method"
("Print Setup", Project menu) to PostScript.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 From within Wordworth, the PostScript fonts can be selected using the
Font requester. They are prefixed with 'WW_PS_'. They include WW_PS_Times,
WW_PS_Helvetica, WW_PS_Palatino, WW_PS_ZapfDingbats and so on.



 PRINTING WITH POSTSCRIPT

 From the "Print Setup" requester click PostScript on the bottom of the
requester.

 DESTINATION

 Select the Printer radio button to print the document.

 You can also send the document to disk by selecting the File radio button
and type the path and file name into the Filename text gadget, the
destination can also be set using the file requester by clicking the
Select button.

This option is particularly useful if you wish to print your
document using the facilities of a typesetting bureau.

 OPTIONS

 Download Fonts: Informs Wordworth to send all the PostScript fonts in
your document to the printer before printing. This is used when the
document contains fonts which are not internal to the printer.

 Only PostScript Type 1 fonts can be downloaded to a printer and
therefore, if you wish to use any of your Agfa Compugraphic fonts in a
document, you will have to convert them to PostScript format before
editing.

 If a font has not been downloaded and is not one of the inbuilt fonts it
will be printed in Courier.

 Page 280

 The "Download Fonts" options are as follows:

 "Once Only"   Any new fonts are downloaded to the printer once only. If
               the printer is turned off, you will need to re-download the
               fonts  using the "Every Time" option,

 "Every Time"  All fonts are downloaded to the printer every time the
               document is printed.

 "Never"       Fonts are never downloaded. If a font is not internal, and
               it has not been previously downloaded, the text will be
               printed in Courier.

 Landscape documents can be printed easily by using the
 Rotate and Offset options:

 * Choose Document (Format menu) and swap the values
 for Height and Width.

 * From the "PostScript Setup" requester, set Rotate to 90, and
   "Horizontal Offset' to 11.713 in.

 * Choose Print, and your document will appear in landscape.

 Scaling: To enlarge or reduce the size of the page, type a scaling
percentage for the width and height. For example, typing 50 for horizontal
and vertical scaling will print the page at 25% of its normal size.

 Rotate By: Type an angle by which you wish to rotate the page  The
rotation is in degrees anti-clockwise around the origin, which is at the
bottom left corner of the page.

 Page 281

 Figure E-1 'PostScript Printer Setup' requester

 Offset: Offsets the page from the top corner of the page. The horizontal
and vertical offsets should be typed using the current measurement units
(usually inches).

 Send EOF Character: Some PostScript printers require a special character
at the end of a file. If you experience an EOF error while printing,
select this check box to solve the problem.

 DRAG AND DROP TEXT EDITING

 Drag and Drop editing is the easiest way to move or copy a selection of
text in one operation.

 To move text using Drag and Drop editing:

 * Select the text you wish to move.

 * Point to the selected text and then hold down the election button. When
   the Drag and Drop pointer appears (a pointer with a grey box beneath
   it), drag the dotted insertion point that appears in the text, to the
   new location.

 * Release the Selection button to drop the text in place. To copy text
   using Drag and Drop editing:

 * Select the text you wish to copy

 * Point to the selected text, hold down the Selection button and depress
   the Ctrl key. When the Drag and Drop pointer appears (a pointer with a
   grey box beneath it and a plus sign in the corner), drag the dotted
   insertion point that appears in the text, to the new location.

 * Release the Selection button to drop the text in place.

 Drag and Drop can be turned on and off from "Text Settings" ("Change
Settings" command, Settings menu).

 Drag and Drop usually works best if you set the Workbench Input
preferences to use a smaller "Double-click Delay".

 Unfortunately, you cannot Drag and Drop text between table cells.

 ADVANCED MAIL MERGING

 There are several selective commands which you can use while mail
merging.

 «:NEXT»

 This skips on to the next record in the files. It is useful when printing
labels, as you can have a page with several records, for example:

 «Name»
 «Address»
 «Postcode»
 «:NEXT»

 «Name»
 «Address»
 «Postcode »

 Note that the «:NEXT» command is preceded by a colon to distinguish it
from a normal field name.

 «:SKIP» And «ENDSKIP»

 These two commands precede and follow a group of field names where you
want empty fields to pick up the data from the following field. This is
useful for addresses where some fields in the address may be empty and you
would want all the filled fields to be grouped together rather than having
gaps left. For example:

 If using fields NAME, STREET, STREET2, TOWN, COUNTY, POSTCODE.

 You could find:

     Mr Brown¶
     2 Elms Street¶
     ¶
     Launceston¶
     Cornwall¶
     PL10 8JY¶

 Mr Brown's record didn't contain and data in STREET2.

 Page 284

  To avoid this you would enter the following in your merge letter:

 «:SKIP»«Name»

 «Street»

 «Street2»

 «Town »

 «County»

 «Postcode»«:ENDSKIP»

 For the example record, this would cause the contents of TOWN to be
inserted where STREET2 should be, COUNTY to be inserted where TOWN should
be and POSTCODE to be inserted where COUNTY should be with the blank space
being left at the end of the group where POSTCODE would normally be. The
Endskip command prevents the data from any other field references in the
letter, after the group, being inserted in the POSTCODE position.

 The result for this example would be:

 Mr Brown¶
 2 Elms Street¶
 Launceston¶
 Cornwall¶
 PL10 8JL¶

 «:IF "FIELD" = "value" NEXT» And

 «:IF "FIELD" = "value" STOP»

 These two commands allow conditional checks of the data in fields to
allow the printing of only selected records. The first command will skip
to the next record if the field contents match the value. The second
command will stop the printing of the document if the field matches the
value.

 In place of the '=' comparison you can also use any of the following:

 <=- (or-<)       - Less than or equal to

 >= (or =>)       - Greater than or equal to

 <>               - Does not equal to

 <                - Less than

 >                - Greater than

 Page 285

 The comparisons are made between the  text in FIELD and the text in
VALUE. Numerical Comparisons are not supported, only alphanumeric. FIELD
and value must be surrounded by quotes.

 For example, to print a document to all the people living in towns whose
names start with the letters D to G:

 «:if "TOWN" < "d" NEXT»

 «:if "TOWN" > "G" STOP»

 To print a letter only to those people living in London:

 «:IF "TOWN" < "London" NEXT»

 «:IF "TOWN" > "London" STOP»

 The use of stop above assumes that the data file is sorted
alphabetically. If it isn't, only use the NEXT Command, to skip to the
NEXT record. For example:

 «:IF "TOWN" < > "London" NEXT»

 Note that the NEXT command in the conditional checks skips to the NEXT
record in a similar manner to the «:NEXT» command so that you could use
data from a record prior to a conditional check and then use the next
record for the rest of the document after the check.

 Also note that all comparisons are case insensitive.

                APPENDIX G-SHARING WITH OTHER APPLICATIONS

 SHARING TEXT

 Wordworth can open and Save documents in a variety of popular text and
word processing file formats, including Wordworth, Kindwords3, "ASCII
text", RTF (Rich Text Format), WordPerfect 5.1 (MSDOS), Microsoft Word
(MSDOS), MS Windows Write, Wordstar and Microsoft Works.

 Each of these file Formats stores information in different ways. Only the
standard Wordworth format is capable of storing all the formatting
information used to describe the appearance of a Wordworth document.
Saving Wordworth documents in a different document format will lose some
of the formatting information.

 The following lists what information is stored in, or retrieved from,
each format.

 WORDWORTH

 Opening and saving: ALL text, typefaces, type styles, paragraph
formatting, page breaks, page sizes, and graphics.

 ASCII

 Opening: All characters are read as text characters. Carriage returns or
line feeds are treated as paragraph breaks.

 Saving: Only text and paragraph break. All typeface, type style,
paragraph formatting, graphics, page break and page size information is
discarded.

 RTF (RICH TEXT FORMAT)

 Opening and saying: Text, typefaces, type style, foreign
 characters, indents, paragraph alignment information, and
 page break are maintained. Graphics are discarded.

 WORDPERFECT 5.1 (MSDOS)

 Opening and saving: Text and type style only.

 MS Word (MSDOS)

 Opening: Text and type style only.

 Microsoft Works

 Opening: Text and type style only.

 Wordstar

 Opening: Text and type style only.

 Page 287


 MS WINDOWS WRITE

 Opening: Text, type style, indents, and page breaks are maintained.
Typefaces and graphics are discarded.



 SHARING GRAPHICS

 BITMAPPED GRAPHICS

 Wordworth can place bitmap pictures drawn in IFF, TIF, GIF, PCX, BMP, IMG
formats as long as the appropriate Filters have been installed.

 Bitmap graphics are like bitmap fonts and are prone to the same scaling
restrictions when printing. This means that your pictures may appear
'jagged' when printed.

 SCALABLE GRAPHICS

 Wordworth can place scalable pictures drawn in CGM or GEM formats as long
as the appropriate filters have been installed.

 Scalable clip art is like a scalable font, it can be scaled to any size,
and retains its perfect quality. When printing, because of its
scalability, the quality will be perfect and just as good as your scalable
outline fonts.

 Page 288



                   APPENDIX H-MAKING THE MOST OF MEMORY

 Memory is used by Wordworth for storing the program, its information and
the documents created with it.

 The following explanations should help you understand where memory is
used, how much memory various Commands might need, and what to do if the
computer runs out of memory.



 WHAT IS MEMORY?

 Memory, sometimes referred to as RAM (Random Access Memory) can be
thought of in terms of a large box of a certain volume. The more that is
put into the box, the less space there is free.

 When commands are removed from the box, more space is made. Thus, the
more programs and information that are stored in a computers memory, the
less space is available for storing information. Freeing up information,
or quitting a program, will free more space for use by other programs.

 The amount of memory is measured in bytes. The larger the number the more
memory is available. A Kilobyte is 1024 bytes. A Megabyte is 1024
Kilobytes. A Kilobyte is often referred to as a "K" and Megabytes are
sometimes called a "Meg."

 The Amiga's memory comes in two varieties Chip RAM and Fast RAM.

 Chip RAM is that memory that can be accessed by the Amiga's graphics and
sound chips. Since there is usually less Chip RAM than Fast RAM on an
Amiga, many programs which use graphics seem to run out of memory, even
when there is plenty of Fast RAM free.

 Information stored in Fast RAM can be accessed or changed faster than
Chip RAM, so programs are usually stored in Fast RAM.

 Wordworth requires at least 1.5 Megabytes of memory to work, of which the
program uses about 800K, and the operating system uses about 100K.

 When a document is opened, memory is required to store information about
the window itself; this could be up to 50K for each window, and is stored
mainly in Chip RAM Therefore, opening several windows can quickly use up a
lot of memory. Wordworth is capable of opening up to eight windows, but
this will depend on the amount of available memory.

 Page 289

 When a window is opened, memory is used for storing the actual document
text, which is stored in Fast RAM.

 Although in theory 10000 characters it text takes 1 0000 bytes of memory
(10KB), Wordworth will use more. It needs to also store information about
the text, such as the formatting of lines, paragraphs and type styles.
This explains why trying to open a 50K ASCII text document might require
up to 200K of memory.

 The Wordworth screen also takes up Chip RAM. A higher resolution, or more
colours will occupy more memory. Inserting pictures in a document requires
a great deal of memory, which will vary depending on the size and number
of colours.

 The amount of available memory can be checked at any time by choosing
About (Project menu). If free memory looks low (that is, less than 50000
bytes in total), it is a good idea to save any documents and attempt to
maximise any available memory.

 When available memory is low some commands may become unavailable in
which case Wordworth will show the message Out of Memory on the current
document's title bar.

 IMPORTANT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The creation of documents with many different types and sizes of fonts,
use large amounts of memory - the larger the font, the more memory is
needed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Page 290



 MAXIMISING AVAILABLE MEMORY

 Follow these simple guidelines should experience low memory problems:

 * Always keep the number of open documents to a minimum.


 * High resolution screen modes use more memory, choose "Change Settings"
   (Settings menu), select Screen and click "Screen Mode" to change the
   screen mode to medium resolution.

 * Colour uses more memory, choose "Change Settings" (Settings men u),
   select Screen and click "Screen Mode" to reduce the number of colours.

 * Quit any other programs running on the Workbench.

 * Close the Workbench screen (choose "Close Workbench" command from the
   Settings menu). This will save at least 32k of memory.

 If memory gets very low, you may need to delete any pictures in the
current document.

 One area that can easily be overlooked is the clipboard. If you have been
using the Edit menu commands Cut or Copy, text will be stored on the
clipboard. If this text is no longer required for Pasting then clear the
clipboard by selecting one character of text, and choose Copy from the
Edit menu.

 Refer to Chapter Nine, "Customising And Optimising Wordworth" for more
information on saving memory.

                        APPENDIX J-TROUBLESHOOTING

 The questions and answers are divided into sections. Refer to the General
section First and then the specific topic (Installation, Fonts, Printing).



 GENERAL

 Q. When I double-click the Wordworth icon it refuses to run and shows a
    message.

 A. Wordworth may not run for several reasons. If you have a hard disk,
    you may not have installed it correctly. Be sure to use the
    Ww3Install-1 program.

 Q. Setting a tab on the ruler seems to make the tab disappear at times.

 A. Be sure to release the select key whilst the mouse is still over the
    ruler. Dragging the mouse below the ruler and releasing the key will
    remove the tab.

 Q. When typing text into gadgets (for example, the "Page width" box), the
    text seems to be ignored occasionally.

 A. When text or a number is typed in a box, press the Return key to
    register the change. Simply editing the box and clicking OK may
    disregard the change.

 Q. Keep the mouse pointer off the colour palette and horizontal ruler
    when using keyboard shortcuts.

 Q. The paragraph count in Statistics (Tools menu) seems to be more than
    the number of paragraphs in the document.

 A. Wordworth counts the number of actual paragraphs used, including those
    with no text. A paragraph is defined as the text between two return
    characters. Therefore, if you press the Return key at the end of a
    paragraph, and then Return again, to add a blank line, Wordworth will
    count this as two paragraphs.

    To add space between paragraphs, rather than pressing the Return key a
    second time (to add a blank line), you should set the space using the
    Paragraph command (Format menu) and set the "Space Before" and "Space
    After" the paragraph as required.

 Page 297

 Q. The Spelling checker, Thesaurus, hyphenation or User dictionary
    facilities refuse to work and an error requester appears.

 A. These facilities need the "Spelling checker" or Thesaurus data files
    to work.

    If using floppy disks, a requester will prompt you to put the Ww3Spell
    or Ww3Extras disks into the disk drive as required. If you are using a
    hard disk, firstly, check that you have used the correct
    installation procedure.

    Check that Wordworth knows where the dictionary data files are
    stored. To do this, choose "Change Settings" (Settings menu) and
    select Spell. The dictionary and thesaurus will show the path it is
    using to look for the data files. Amend as necessary, for example,
    using hard disk dh0:Wordworth/Spell, using floppy disk Ww3Spell:Spell
    or Ww3EXtras:Spell.

    If you have at least 4 megabytes of RAM available, you can copy the
    spelling checker drawer into the RAM disk. This will make using the
    spelling checker and thesaurus considerably faster (since Wordworth
    will always check the RAM disk first before the disk).

 Q. Do I need to have the Spelling checker or Thesaurus disk in the disk
    drive at all times?

 A. I am having difficulty double-clicking to select a word, and triple-
    clicking to select a line. Try changing the time interval between
    double-clicks. This can be set from your Input preferences program
    settings on your Workbench disk. If you are using floppy disks:

    step 1

    Reset your Amiga with the Wordworth3 disk in drive df0:.

    step 2

    Insert your Workbench disk and click the disk icon. Click the Prefs
    drawer and double-click Input program. This will load the settings
    from the Wordworth3 disk.

 Page 298

    step 3

    Change the "Double Click Delay" slider as appropriate and then click
    Save to save your changes to the Wordworth3 disk.

 Q. With several documents open, Wordworth appears to stop Working.

 A. Check that you do not have a requester displayed in one of the
    documents (it may be hidden by another document). You will need to
    clear the requester before you can continue.

 Q. My Amiga keeps asking me to "Insert volume Wordworth3 in any drive",
    even after I have inserted the Wordworth3 disk.

 A. When you made backup copies of your Wordworth disks, you probably
    renamed them incorrectly. It's very easy to leave an extra space
    before or after the name without realising. When renaming disks, don't
    leave any characters in front of the Wordworth name, and copy the
    names as they appear on the original Wordworth disks.

 Q. How do I merge two files?

 A. Open the first document as normal and then open the second. From the
    Edit menu, choose the "Select All" command and then from the Edit
    menu, choose the Copy command (or press Right Amiga-C) to copy the
    entire contents of the second document to the clipboard.

    Return to the first document and place the cursor at the desired
    insertion point. Choose Paste from the Edit menu (or press Right
    Amiga-V) to paste the clipboard into the first document. Now save this
    document using a new name using the "Save As" command from the Project
    menu.

 Page 299

 Q. Although I am using the spelling checker from the RAM disk, why does
    Wordworth still ask for the Ww3Spell disk?

 A. When spelling checking, Wordworth looks for the Collins dictionary and
    then a User dictionary. If you add words to the User dictionary in
    RAM, once the Amiga is switched off, they would be lost. To prevent
    this, and to save your own words in the User dictionary, Wordworth
    needs the dictionary disk to be in a disk drive (although, whilst
    spelling checking, it will perform all of the checking in RAM).

    However, you can override this safety feature by changing the
    Dictionary text gadget in the "Spell Settings" requester ("Change
    Settings" command, Settings menu) to RAM:SPELL.

 Q. Paragraph formatting (centre, left, right, fully) does not always seem
    to work correctly.

 A. Use the "Show Codes" command document menu) to show codes and check
    that the paragraph doesn't contain tabs (which are shown by a
    triangle), as these will override any justification.



 INSTALLATION

 Q. Wordworth failed to install on my hard disk.

 A. You probably have insufficient free space on your hard disk. Wordworth
    requires at least 3 megabytes of disk space. Try deleting some files
    on the hard disk before installing.

 Q. After Wordworth prompted for Name, Organization and License Number it
    quit and returned to Workbench.

 A. Wordworth needs to be personalized before you can use the program. You
    need to type your Name, Organization and License Number. Thereafter,
    this information is shown every time you use the program, confirming
    that you are the licensed user of Wordworth.

    The information must be typed correctly, typing blank lines, or an
    invalid License Number will cause Wordworth to quit.

 Page 300

 Q. When installing Wordworth, l get an error requester telling me my
    Wordworth disk has a read/ write error.

 A. Your Amiga has detected a fault with the disk, and therefore the disk
    needs replacing. If this occurs on your original master disks, return
    them to Digita and include a stamped self-addressed envelope. We will
    send you tested replacements by return.



 FONTS

 Q. Can I use PD and ColorFonts in Wordworth?

 A. Yes, just copy them into your System Fonts: drawer (on the Wordworth3
    floppy disk).

 Q. When l select a new typeface, only half of the font appears on the
    screen.

 A. You should set the line spacing to Auto and let Wordworth work it out
    (Paragraph command, Format menu).

 Q. Large italic fonts sometimes become corrupt.

 A. Workbench 2 sometimes slightly corrupts (spurious pixels may appear).
    Try to avoid large Amiga bit-mapped italic fonts until a solution is
    found.



 PRINTING

 Q. I wish to select more than one printer driver from the printer list,
    and if I do, how does Wordworth know which driver I wish to use.

 A. Start the "Add New Printer" program on the Ww3Install-1 disk to
    install a new printer. If you are using a floppy disk system, you can
    only install one printer driver (disk space is very tight).

    You make your choice of printer driver from the "Print Setup"
    requester (Project menu). Choose "Save Settings" (Settings menu) to
    store your printer settings permanently (as default).

Page 301

 Q. I have a PostScript printer, but no hard disk on which to store the
    PostScript screen fonts. How can I use them on my floppy disk system.

 A. Contact Digita technical support.

 Q. When printing multiple page documents, the paging seems to get out of
    sync. Sometimes the bottom of a page appears at the top of the next.

 A. Check the page size you are using (Document command, Format menu),
    does it match the paper size?

    If you are using the a HP_Deskjet or HP_LaserJet printer, you may only
    get a ten inch page.

 Q. Each time I start Wordworth I have to manually change the printer
    driver.

 A. To save them permanently you need to choose "Save Settings" (Settings
    menu)

 Q. I cannot seem to get the "Print Method- "Printer Font" to work, and
    even though Draft is not selected, the output always appears in draft
    mode.

 A. You have selected the Generic printer driver from the "Print Setup"
    requester. Select the appropriate one for your printer and click OK.
    Then choose "Save Settings" (Settings menu) to permanently save the
    settings.

 Q. Does Wordworth support the extra fonts supplied in my printer' s font
    cartridge?

 A. Not at the moment. However, it is our aim to support as many printer
    fonts as possible and we are constantly expanding our range of printer
    drivers and fonts.

    If you own a font set that Wordworth doesn't support, we need to know
    the following information about the font: Its name, sizes, styles, the
    font width (metric tables) for each character, and the control codes
    to select them. This information is printed at the rear of most
    printer/font manuals, and so you may wish to consider loaning us the
    manual for investigation.

 Page 302

 Q. I have just purchased the very latest in printer technology, but
    Cannot find a printer driver to match, help!

 A. Digita do not write printer drivers. It's best to contact a PD
    library).

 Q. When printing my outline fonts using the "Print Method"-Normal, I get
    the message 'Error: Not enough memory'.

 A. Check that you have correctly set the printer driver ("Print Setup"
    requester, Project menu).

    You will probably find that your printer driver is set to Generic. If
    a suitable printer driver for your printer does not appear in the list
    box, you will have to install the appropriate driver using the Add New
    Printer program (Ww3Install-1 disk).

 Q. I own a Daisywheel printer but do not seem able to get the graphics to
    appear on my printouts.

 A. You won't! Daisywheel printers cannot output graphics, only text. As
    with all printers, you will need to check their specification.

 Q. I cannot get any graphics to appear on my printouts, only text.

 A. Check your printer is capable of printing graphics and that you have
    selected the correct printer driver from the "Print Setup" requester
    ("Print Setup" command, Project menu)

 Q. When dumping graphics to the printer, all I get is garbage sent to the
    printer.

 A. You have not selected the correct driver for your printer. Check the
    "Print Setup" requester is properly configured.

 Q. I want to use a Serial Printer instead of the Parallel default. How do
    I change the settings.

 A. Click the Wordworth program icon and choose Information from the
    Workbench Icons menu. Select the (DEVICE=SERIAL) tooltype and delete
    the brackets, press the Return key and click Save.

    Now start Wordworth as normal.
