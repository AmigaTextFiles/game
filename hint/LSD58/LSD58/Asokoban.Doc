Wellcome to ASokoban!

This is an implementation of the UNIX game Sokoban for the Amiga. It has the
original 85 levels of the UNIX game, which means that if you already have
played the original game, you will find ASokoban's stages familiar).

ASokoban will run on any Amiga computer with version 2.0 or higher of the OS
(or at least I hope it will). If you have version 2.1 or higher ASokoban will
try to use the language you have selected through Preferences.





To install ASokoban from scratch or to update an old version just run the
installation script.
If you update from versions prior to 2.0 your old highscore file will
automatically be converted to a new highscore file.
If you choose to install the MagicWB style icons without having MagicWB
installed you can still get them look nice. For this purpose you need at least
an 8 color WB and you will have to load the correct color palette into the
Palette Preferences. The palette can be found in the misc dir (one for 2.x and
one for 3.x).





The following tooltypes are recognized by ASokoban:

PUBSCREEN=<name of public screen>
Use this to open the window on other public screens than the default one (if
there is no public screen with the given name, the program will try to open its
window on the default public screen).

DATAFILE=<name of datafile>
Name of data file where you have saved your position.





(v1.0a - v1.1c by Panagiotis Christias)
1.0a    : First stable version. Distributed among my friends only for beta
          testing.

1.0b    : First official release.

1.1     : Compiled with SAS C 6.1 using Reqtools.library 2.1. Undo bug fixed
          (found it myself!). Now ASokoban saves its position  automatically
          on exit ( reported by Kriton Kyrimis ) . Level 15  bug fixed , now
          ASokoban  counts as saved  packets which are  in the safe from the
          beginning of a level (like level 15 ) . First reported by  Carsten
          Steger . When  loading a datafile  maxlevel won't decrease if max-
          level of datafile is smaller than  current maxlevel . Suggested by
          Sebastian Delmont.

1.1c    : ASokoban used to have some problems  when finishing a level  using 
          the mouse . Bug is fixed , now  ASokoban  does not  lose any IDCMP 
          message ( reported by Markus Torpvret) .  This version of ASokoban
          supports any  kind ( and size ) of font  for the titlebar .  First
          reported by Terence Russell and Ives Aerts ( still Asokoban is not
          font sensitive, sorry...).

(Project taken over by Lorens Younes)
v2.0 (95-02-08) ASokoban is now fontsensitive (falls back to topaz 8 if the
                graphics won't fit with the user prefered fonts).
                Support for locale.library added.
                Gadgets are now disabled when they have no function.
                PUBSCREEN and DATAFILE tooltypes added.
                New highscore list (one high score for each level instead of
                an overall top ten)
                Documentation in AmigaGuide format.
                Installation script for Commodore's Installer.
                ReqTools.library no longer used for requesters
                (asl filerequester used instead).





Write more catalogs (if you help me).
Add "online-help".
Write level editor.





If you get the message "Screen is too small!" when you run ASokoban, you are
either using a too big screen font or you're trying to run ASokoban on a too
small public screen. ASokoban is guaranteed to open on a 640 x 200 screen with
a screen font of resonable size.
If you get a message about opening libraries make sure you've got at least
version 37 of the system libraries.
Any other messages are probably due to lack of memory. They're not likely to
show up.





Without the great work of Panagiotis Cristias ASokoban wouldn't have been what
it is today. Thanks for letting me take over the project!





If you discover any bugs please let me know. Also if you have any suggestions
for improvements, if you have written an additional catalog or if you just want
to tell me how great this program is, I would appreciate to hear from you.

ASokoban is localized, so if you have v2.1 or higher of the OS ASokoban will
try to use the language you have set in Preferences. If there is no catalog
for your language, English will be used as default.

Since I'm not very good at languages I've only written one additional catalog
(the Swedish one). However I've included some files so that you easily can make
ASokoban support your language too. Read INSTRUCTIONS in the Catalogs directory
for more information.

Sokoban is Japanese for Warehouse keeper. In ASokoban you control a strange
pair of eyes through the maze (warehouse) of each level. The purpose is to
push all the money packets into the safe, which is the colored area of the
maze. You can ONLY push the packets - you can't pull them, pick them up or
in any other way manipulate them. Once all money packets are in the safe you
proceed to the next level. There is no time limit (you can sit all day trying
to solve a level). If you have already solved a level you can try to solve it
again - this time with less moves and pushes (there is a highscore entry for
every level). 
The eyes are moved either by the cursor keys or by the mouse. To move the eyes
with the mouse press and hold the left mouse button. The eyes will then follow
the mouse pointer. The right mouse button is equivalent to Undo and the middle
mouse button can be used to Backup/Restore a game.





The following gadgets surrounds the playfiled:

   New         - Starts a new game at the current level (useful when you're
                 stuck).
   Undo        - Undos the last push (not the last move!).
   Set Level   - Lets you choose the level to play. Actually, it works only
                 backwards, giving you the chance to replay previous levels.
   High Scores - Displays the high score list.
   About       - Shows info about program (i.e. version number and author).
   Backup      - "Saves" temporarily your position (before a risky step).
   Restore     - Restores the previously "saved" position.
   Name        - Pops up a file requester to select the name of the file where
                 you want to save your position for later. Note that your level
                 position will also be saved in this file, allowing you to
                 continue the next time from the current level. By default, the
                 name of the file is "ASokoban.data" (when you change it, it
                 will be saved in the TOOLTYPES array of the program icon).
                 This name is displayed in the string gadget on the right of
                 the name gadget. The file name can also be changed by writing
                 directly in the string gadget.
   Load        - Loads the data file.
   Save        - Saves the data file (happens automatically on exit).
   
Extra information is displayed on the right of the playfield. This is the
level, the total number of money packets of the level, the number of saved
money packets and the total number of moves and pushes of the eyes.

To quit ASokoban press the closegadget of the window or press 'q' on the
keyboard.
