    KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS 


* KEYBOARD AND MOUSE CONTROL
 Cancelling A Selection

 To de-select an object, press the Selection button
 on the object to be de-selected. To de-select
 one of a number of objects, click on the object
 while pressing the Shift key. This will deselect
 the current object while maintaining the
 selection of any other objects.

 To cancel the selection of text, depress the
 Selection button anywhere on the page.



* KEYBOARD AND MOUSE CONTROL
 Selecting Objects

 Hold down the Shift key when clicking an object
 to make multiple selections. Clicking a
 previously selected object will de-select it.

 When an object is selected, four small boxes
 appear around its perimeter. These small boxes,
 or handles, are used to resize the object.

 To select all the objects in the document, click
 the Pointer icon (Drawing Tools palette) and
 choose "Select All" (Edit menu).


 Resizing Objects
 
 To resize an object, position the mouse pointer
 over one of the object handles, press the Left
 Mouse key and drag the object outline to the new
 size.

 To cancel the resizing, or moving of an object,
 press the Menu button whilst holding down the
 Selection button.



* KEYBOARD AND MOUSE CONTROL
 Selecting Text

 If you are editing text in your main document,
 (the insertion point is on the page) "Select All"
 (Edit menu) will select all of the text in the
 document.

 If you are editing a text frame "Select All"
 (Edit menu) will select just the text within that
 frame.

 To select a part of text, hold down the shift key
 and move the insertion point with the cursor keys
 or mouse. Alternatively, you can drag the cursor
 over any text with the mouse to highlight it.

 You can also select text by holding down the Shift
 key and clicking elsewhere in the document. The
 text between the cursor and the position where the
 Selection button was depressed will then be selected.

 Double-click the mouse to select a word, or
 triple-click to select a line.

 To cancel the selection of any text. Depress
 the Selection button anywhere on the page.
