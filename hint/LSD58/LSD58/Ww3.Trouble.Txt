* GENERAL PROBLEMS
 General Problems

  PROBLEM 1  After I quit Wordworth, the amount
              of memory available seems to have
              decreased.

  PROBLEM 2  I have a 2MB Amiga 1200 with a
              hard disk, and Wordworth will not
              let me Open, Save or Print my
              documents properly.
             
  PROBLEM 3  When I try and Save my document to
              floppy disk, I get the message
              `Wordworth3 disk full'. I am
              running from floppy disks.

  PROBLEM 4  When I try and place a picture
              which is in PCX format (or indeed
              IMG, GIF, TIF or BMP), the screen
              flashes and the picture is not
              opened.

  PROBLEM 5  When I draw a circle on screen, it
              appears as an oval.

  PROBLEM 6  I have drawn a square in DPaint
              and placed it in my document, but
              it appears as a rectangle.

  PROBLEM 7  Do I have to be in a 256 colour
              screen mode to see and print my
              256 colour picture which has been
              placed in a Wordworth document?

  PROBLEM 8  Is there any way to reduce the
              disk swapping when running
              Wordworth from a floppy disk
              based system.

  PROBLEM 9  I have formatted my document into
              facing pages but I can only see
              one page at a time on screen.

  PROBLEM 10  I have created a `Double Page
               Spread' document and I am viewing
               it in a `Two Pages Across' view
               mode, but I cannot see my page.

  PROBLEM 11  I am running Wordworth from floppy
               disk and I cannot open a document I
               saved from my PC at work. It keeps
               telling me that it cannot understand
               the file.

  PROBLEM 12  When I a open an RTF document saved
               from my PC, Wordworth uses the wrong fonts.

  PROBLEM 13  Why can't I use documents created
               in Wordworth 3.1 with my friends earlier
               version, 3.0b.

  PROBLEM 14  I am running Wordworth from floppy
               disk and I cannot place a PCX picture
               I bought from a Public Domain library.



* GENERAL PROBLEM 1
 After I quit Wordworth, the amount of memory
 available seems to have decreased.
 ------------------------------------------------
 When Wordworth quits, it returns as much of the
 memory to the system as it can.

 However, Wordworth uses many system libraries
 which are kept in memory until such a time as
 more memory is needed, they are then flushed out.

 You can flush out the libraries manually by
 opening up a Shell tool (Workbench System drawer)
 and typing `avail flush'.



* GENERAL PROBLEM 2
 I have a 2MB Amiga 1200 with a hard disk, and
 Wordworth will not let me Open, Save or Print my
 documents properly.
 ------------------------------------------------
 Unfortunately, as soon as a hard disk is installed
 into your machine, about 500Kb of memory
 disappears. This is used by the disk caches,
 system variables and the hard disk itself.

 Because 500Kb of memory has gone as soon as the
 machine has been turned on, you are left with only
 1.5Mb of memory to run Wordworth. Unfortunately,
 Wordworth requires 2Mb of free memory to run
 effectively.

 The problems you are experiencing seem to be due
 to this lack of memory and the only real solution
 would be do buy a RAM expansion to go in the trap
 door under your machine.

 If you are going to buy any more memory, we suggest
 you purchase 32BIT Fast Ram as this will make your
 machine about 7-8 times quicker in overall speed.



* GENERAL PROBLEM 3
 When I try and Save my document to floppy disk,
 I get the message `Wordworth3 disk full'. I am
 running from floppy disks.
 ------------------------------------------------
 By default, Wordworth saves all documents to a
 drawer called Documents on the Wordworth3 disk.

 If this message appears, the disk has been filled
 up with your documents and there is no space left
 to save another.

 You will therefore need to create a separate
 disk which can be used for any further documents.

 Please refer to the sections:
  CREATING A SEPARATE DOCUMENT DISK  and
  SAVING YOUR DOCUMENT ONTO A SEPARATE FLOPPY DISK 
 for information on how to do this.



* GENERAL PROBLEM 4
 When I try and place a picture which is in PCX
 format (or indeed IMG, GIF, TIF or BMP), the
 screen flashes and the picture is not opened.
 ------------------------------------------------
 This often occurs when the graphic file is not
 understood by Wordworth for one of two reasons:

   ° The picture is corrupt in some way, due to a
     faulty disk or incorrectly saved file.

   ° The filter for the picture format is not
     in the Picture drawer (Filters drawer,
     Ww3Outlines disk).

     The filters are used by Wordworth so it can
     understand all of the many different graphic
     and text formats. If the filter does not
     exist, the file cannot be deciphered.

     If you installed Wordworth on floppy disk,
     only the IFF and CGM filters are enabled, all
     of the other filters are disabled by being
     installed into a Storage drawer.

     If you wish to use these other types of
     graphics, you must enable them by dragging
     the appropriate icon out of the Storage drawer
     (`Filters/Picture' drawer, Ww3Outlines disk).



* GENERAL PROBLEM 5
 When I draw a circle on screen, it appears as an
 oval.
 ------------------------------------------------
 With a normal `PAL High Res' screen mode (a mode
 used by TV's and less expensive monitors) the
 screen height is half that of the screen width.

 This means that the pixels used to make up a
 screen display are elongated vertically. Graphics
 drawn in this mode will therefore appear
 `stretched' on screen, but will printout as you
 expect.

 The Circle drawing tool is provided so that you
 can achieve a perfect circle for printing, even
 with a less effective screen mode.

 The addition of a good quality MultiScan monitor
 would eliminate these problems, as alternative
 screen modes would be available that have the same
 number of pixels in the height and width.



* GENERAL PROBLEM 6
 I have drawn a square in DPaint and placed it
 in my document, but it appears as a rectangle.
 ------------------------------------------------
 With a normal `PAL High Res' screen mode (a mode
 used by TV's and less expensive monitors) the
 screen height is half that of the screen width.

 This means that the pixels used to make up a
 screen display are elongated vertically. Graphics
 drawn in this mode will therefore appear
 `stretched' on screen, but will printout as you
 expect.

 The addition of a good quality MultiScan monitor
 would eliminate these problems, as alternative
 screen modes would be available that have the same
 number of pixels in the height and width.



* GENERAL PROBLEM 7
 Do I have to be in a 256 colour screen mode to
 see and print my 256 colour picture which has
 been placed in a Wordworth document?
 ------------------------------------------------
 No. When Wordworth prints graphics, it prints
 using the original graphic size and number of
 colours.

 This therefore means that you can use any screen
 mode, with any number of colours and you will
 always get a perfect printout of the graphic.

 NOTE: This is different to previous versions of
 Wordworth, as they printed graphics using the
 size and colours used on screen.


 If you wish to see the graphic in its full glory
 on screen, you will need to increase the number
 of colours available from the "Screen Settings"
 requester ("Change Settings" command, Settings
 menu). But doing this will greatly decrease your
 Amiga's operation speed.



* GENERAL PROBLEM 8
 Is there any way to reduce the disk swapping when
 running Wordworth from a floppy disk based system.
 ------------------------------------------------
 Yes buy a hard disk. Hard disks are mass storage
 devices which can be placed inside your machine
 and can store from 20 Mb to 1 Gb (1000 Mb).
 Compared to your floppy disk which can only hold
 around 800 Kb, this is a lot of information.

 Hard disks are relatively cheap now and can be
 installed easily. If you do decide to buy a hard
 disk, ensure you purchase and have it installed
 by an authorised Commodore dealer.

 Alternatively, you could purchase an extra floppy
 disk drive (to make it 3) and you should encounter
 very few disk swaps.



* GENERAL PROBLEM 9
 I have formatted my document into facing pages
 but I can only see one page at a time on screen.
 ------------------------------------------------
 You will need to choose the Zoom-Other command
 (View menu) and select `Two Pages Across' to
 see your document in a facing pages view.



* GENERAL PROBLEM 10
 I have created a `Double Page Spread' document
 and I am viewing it in a `Two Pages Across' view
 mode, but I cannot see my page.
 ------------------------------------------------
 `Double Page Spread' documents, like `Facing Page'
 documents, always start on a right hand or odd
 page.

 This means that you will have to move the
 horizontal slider to the right to see the first
 page. All subsequent pages will be left then
 right, and so on.



* GENERAL PROBLEM 11
 I am running Wordworth from floppy disk and I
 cannot open a document I saved from my PC at work.
 It keeps telling me that it cannot understand the
 file.
 ------------------------------------------------
 By default, you will only be able to open
 Wordworth, ASCII or RTF documents, as the other
 file filters will have been installed into a
 Storage drawer (to disable them).

 To use the other document formats, just drag the
 appropriate filters out of the Storage drawer
 (found in the `Filters/Text' drawer, Ww3Outlines
 disk) into the `Filters/Text' drawer and re-run
 the program.



* GENERAL PROBLEM 12
 When I a open an RTF document saved from my PC,
 Wordworth uses the wrong fonts.
 ------------------------------------------------
 To get Wordworth to use the correct fonts, you
 will need to edit a text file called
 `FontTranslations' which is in the `WwFonts/UFST'
 drawer.

 This file informs Wordworth which font it should
 map the documents fonts to, as fonts on different
 systems are named slightly differently.



* GENERAL PROBLEM 13
 Why can't I use documents created in Wordworth
 3.1 with my friends earlier version, 3.0b.
 ------------------------------------------------
 If you wish to save a document so that it can be
 used on earlier versions of Wordworth 3, then
 choose "Save As" (Project menu) and select the
 `Wordworth 3.0' format from the list.

 A separate format is used because Wordworth 3.1
 uses a fast loading file format and is therefore
 incompatible with earlier versions.



* GENERAL PROBLEM 14
 I am running Wordworth from floppy disk and I
 cannot place a PCX picture I bought from a Public
 Domain library.
 ------------------------------------------------
 By default, you will only be able to use IFF and
 CGM pictures, as the other picture filters have
 been installed into a Storage drawer (to disable them).

 To use the other picture formats, just drag the
 appropriate filters out of the Storage drawer
 (found in the `Filters/Pictures' drawer,
 Ww3Outlines disk) into the `Filters/Pictures'
 drawer and re-run the program.



* EDITING AND FORMATTING PROBLEMS
 Editing And Formatting Problems

  PROBLEM 1  When I move my insertion point to
              the middle of a word, the letters
              in front of the insertion point
              disappear as I type.

  PROBLEM 2  When I move my cursor to the header
              or footer and type some letters, the
              screen flashes and nothing appears.

  PROBLEM 3  When I type using the `MathRoman...'
              fonts, my text appears in Greek and
              in strange characters.

  PROBLEM 4  The Speech facility does not seem to
              work at all. I have an Amiga
              A4000/030.

  PROBLEM 5  I am using Wordworth 3 on floppy
              disks, on my Amiga 2000, and the
              characters seem to take ages to
              appear on screen after pressing
              the keys.

  PROBLEM 6  I have highlighted some text and wish
              to `Drag and Drop' it to a different
              paragraph. But when I click on the
              selected block, the text is
              deselected.



* EDITING AND FORMATTING PROBLEM 1
 When I move my insertion point to the middle
 of a word, the letters in front of the insertion
 point disappear as I type.
 ------------------------------------------------
 You seem to be in `Overtype' mode. Press the 0
 key on the numeric keypad so that the word
 Overtype disappears from the Status Bar.



* EDITING AND FORMATTING PROBLEM 2
 When I move my cursor to the header or footer and
 type some letters, the screen flashes and nothing
 appears.
 ------------------------------------------------
 There is not enough room in the header of footer
 for any characters.

 Ensure that the Header and Footer Margins
 ("Document Options" requester, Format menu) plus
 the height of your characters, is less than the Top
 or Bottom Margin (Document command, Format menu).

 For example:
 If you are using 14pt text (0.2 inches in height)
 and your Header margin is 0.2 inches. Your Top
 margin should be at least 0.5 inches.



* EDITING AND FORMATTING PROBLEM 3
 When I type using the `MathRoman...' fonts, my
 text appears in Greek and in strange characters.
 ------------------------------------------------
 The MathRoman fonts are symbol fonts that contain
 Greek maths characters for use in mathematical
 equations.

 These fonts are embedded within other font files
 and, therefore, cannot be deleted.



* EDITING AND FORMATTING PROBLEM 4
 The Speech facility does not seem to work at all.
 I have an Amiga A4000/030.
 ------------------------------------------------
 Workbench 3.0 and 2.1 users unfortunately will
 not be able to use the Speech facility in
 Wordworth.

 This is because Commodore does not allow Software
 houses to distribute the Workbench Speech files
 with their products, as was originally allowed.

 The only solution would be to contact your local
 Public Domain library to see if there are any
 third party speech programs that can be used
 instead.



* EDITING AND FORMATTING PROBLEM 5
 I am using Wordworth 3 on floppy disks, on my
 Amiga 2000, and the characters seem to take ages
 to appear on screen after pressing the keys.
 ------------------------------------------------
 Unfortunately, this is a drawback with floppy
 disks.

 When a character is typed, the letter is read in
 from the disk and `cached' (stored in memory).
 This process will occur for each character typed.

 However, once a letter has been cached and the
 key is pressed again, it will appear on screen
 almost instantly because it does not have to
 access the disk.



* EDITING AND FORMATTING PROBLEM 6
 I have highlighted some text and wish to `Drag
 and Drop' it to a different paragraph. But when
 I click on the selected block, the text is
 deselected.
 ------------------------------------------------
 This could be for two reasons:

   ° Firstly, the `Drag and Drop' facility has
     probably not been turned On from the "Text
     Settings" requester (Change Settings" command,
     Settings menu).

   ° Secondly, the double-click delay in the
     Workbench Input preferences is set too long.
     Lower the delay value to elimate the problem.



* FONT PROBLEMS
 Font Problems

  PROBLEM 1  I have a PostScript font that I
              bought from the public domain, but
              when I try and type using this font
              nothing appears.

  PROBLEM 2  I cannot seem to install the fonts I
              got with my previous version of
              Wordworth.

  PROBLEM 3  I cannot get TrueType fonts to work
              on my Amiga.

  PROBLEM 4  When I double-click the
              `InstallOutlines' tool (WwTools
              drawer), it does not install the
              new fonts that I have just copied
              into my fonts drawer.

  PROBLEM 5  I can't seem to delete a font that I
              have installed for use with
              Wordworth 3.



* FONT PROBLEM 1
 I have a PostScript font that I bought from the
 public domain, but when I try and type using this
 font nothing appears.
 ------------------------------------------------
 This may be because the font does not use `Adobe
 Standard Encoding', which means that Wordworth
 cannot locate the correct character when a key
 is pressed.

 Wordworth 3 will hopefully be updated in the
 future to accommodate these non-standard encoded
 fonts.



* FONT PROBLEM 2
 I cannot seem to install the fonts I got with my
 previous version of Wordworth.
 ------------------------------------------------
 Read  INSTALLING ADDITIONAL FONTS 
 for information on how this can be done.



* FONT PROBLEM 3
 I cannot get TrueType fonts to work on my
 Amiga.

 My machine is a 68000 Amiga 2000 with hard disk
 and 8MB of RAM.
 ------------------------------------------------
 Unfortunately, due to unavoidable machine
 restrictions, TrueType fonts are unavailable on
 pre-68020 processor machines.



* FONT PROBLEM 4
 When I double-click the `InstallOutlines' tool
 (WwTools drawer), it does not install the new
 fonts that I have just copied into my fonts
 drawer.
 ------------------------------------------------
 The InstallOutlines tool will only install:

   ° Agfa Intellifont fonts which are suffixed by
     `.type', `.typ' or `.lib',

   ° PostScript Type 1 fonts which are suffixed
     by `.pfb',

   ° TrueType fonts which are suffixed by `.ttf'.

 Also ensure that all of the tool types on the
 InstallOutlines tool are disabled (ie: have
 brackets around them).



* FONT PROBLEM 5
 I can't seem to delete a font that I have
 installed for use with Wordworth 3.
 ------------------------------------------------
 You will need to do three things:

   ° Firstly, delete the font file from its
     appropriate drawer.

   ° Secondly, open up the UFST drawer, in the
     WwFonts drawer and choose
     Show-"All Files" from the Workbench Windows
     menu.

     Delete the `FontList' file and the files
     ending in `.font' and `.otag' for the font
     you wish to delete.
     
   ° Double-click `InstallOutlines', WwTools
     drawer (floppy disk users will find this
     drawer on the Ww3Extras disk).




* PRINTING PROBLEMS
 Printing Problems

  PROBLEM 1  When I print my document, some
              elements of my page are missing.
              Such as a couple of letters from
              the heading, or the TextEffects
              object I have as a logo.

  PROBLEM 2  When I print my document, there are
              blank spaces between the top and
              bottom half of the text.

  PROBLEM 3  When I print my document, a blank
              sheet of paper is fed through after
              each page is printed.

  PROBLEM 4  When I print out my document, the
              printout is very poor, with the
              text looking extremely `jaggy'.

  PROBLEM 5  When I print using my expensive
              PostScript printer, the busy light
              flashes so I know it is receiving
              information. Then Wordworth finishes
              and returns me to the document, but
              nothing comes out of the printer.

  PROBLEM 6  I am trying to use the Rotate option
              from the "PostScript Setup"
              requester with my PostScript printer
              but a blank page keeps getting
              thrown out.

  PROBLEM 7  I have several text frames in my
              document and I am printing using the
              `Internal Printer Font' method. Why
              does the text in my text frames
              appear with large gaps between each
              line.

  PROBLEM 8  I have just printed out a document
              that I created in Wordworth 3.0a and
              a blank page was ejected after each
              page. I am using the same "Print
              Borders" as Wordworth v2 and v3.0a.



* PRINTING PROBLEM 1
 When I print my document, some elements of my
 page are missing. Such as a couple of letters
 from the heading, or the TextEffects object I
 have as a logo.
 ------------------------------------------------
 The most common cause of this problem is due to
 lack of memory.

 To print a very smooth quality printout requires
 a lot of memory because all of the text and
 graphics on screen are scaled up about five times
 larger.

 You can increase the amount of memory available to
 the system for printing by following the items
 mentioned in Chapter Nine of the Instruction Book,
 `Customising and Optimising Wordworth'.

 Alternatively, the amount of memory needed for
 the print job can be decreased by lowering the
 Density level ("Print Setup", Project menu).
 This will cause the printout to be printed in
 a lower quality, but will use less memory.



* PRINTING PROBLEM 2
 When I print my document, there are blank
 spaces between the top and bottom half of the
 text.
 ------------------------------------------------
 Your printing problems seem to be due to the
 printer automatically sending a line feed, after
 the computer has already told the printer to move
 on a line. This combination will cause large gaps
 in your printout.

 On most printers there is a facility called `DIP
 Switches' which are used to set up the printer.
 Some newer printers have a LCD screen and menu
 system for the same thing.

 There is usually a DIP Switch or menu item for
 `Automatic Line Feed', `CR causes Line Feed', 
 `Send CR/LF' or something similar. These options
 are used to tell the printer what to do at the
 end of each line.

 You must set this option to OFF or `LF Only', to
 stop the printer sending another line feed and
 thus eliminate a blank space between two strips
 of printing.



* PRINTING PROBLEM 3
 When I print my document, a blank sheet of paper
 is fed through after each page is printed.
 ------------------------------------------------
 Because some printers have what is termed an
 `Unprintable area', you must inform Wordworth
 that it shouldn't print on certain parts of the
 page.

 This can be done by entering values into the
 "Print Border" text gadgets ("Print Setup",
 Project menu).

 If you already have values in the text gadgets,
 increase the Bottom-"Print Border" until the
 problem goes away. If there are no values in
 the text gadgets, try the following values:
   Top    - 0.25 in
   Bottom - 0.75 in
   Left   - 0.25 in
   Right  - 0.25 in



* PRINTING PROBLEM 4
 When I print out my document, the printout is very
 poor, with the text looking extremely `jaggy'.
 ------------------------------------------------
 Your document most probably contains a few `Amiga
 Bitmap Fonts'.

 Amiga fonts are termed `bit-mapped' because they
 are drawn in preset sizes using a matrix of dots.

 This means that the font cannot be scaled, like
 an Outline font, to match the resolution of the
 printer and thus the quality of the whole printout
 will be poor.

 To rectify this problem, choose "Select All" (Edit
 menu) and select the `Shannon Book' font from the
 font pop-up on the Ruler Tools.

 Next, choose "Change Settings" (Settings menu) and
 select Text from the list. Turn off the `Bitmap
 Fonts' option from the `Displayed Fonts' group.

 This will not display any of the poor quality
 bitmap fonts in the font requester and you will
 not be able to select one of these fonts by
 accident.



* PRINTING PROBLEM 5
 When I print using my expensive PostScript
 printer, the busy light flashes so I know it is
 receiving information. Then Wordworth finishes
 and returns me to the document, but nothing comes
 out of the printer.
 -------------------------------------------------
 There could be several reasons for this:
  ° The printer needs to have the "Send EOF" option
    turned on from the "PostScript Setup" requester.

  ° The printer is not setup correctly to receive
    information from the Amiga.

  ° If the PostScript printer is using the Serial
    port then you may need to set your Serial Prefs
    from your Workbench Preferences drawer.

    Check that the options are correct for your
    printer by referring to your Printer's User
    Manual.

  ° The printer cable is faulty. Try another cable
    by borrowing a friends or exchanging it at
    your local computer dealer.



* PRINTING PROBLEM 6
 I am trying to use the Rotate option from the
 "PostScript Setup" requester with my PostScript
 printer but a blank page keeps getting thrown out.
 ------------------------------------------------
 When using the Rotate operation, you must remember
 that the rotation is carried out anti-clockwise
 around the bottom left corner of the page.

 This means that your document page is actually
 off to the side of the printout. You will
 therefore need to Offset the page back so that it
 will be printed.

 For example:
 Rotate an A4 page 90° and you will need to Offset
 it Horizontally by `11.713 inches'.



* PRINTING PROBLEM 7
 I have several text frames in my document and I
 am printing using the `Internal Printer Font'
 method. Why does the text in my text frames
 appear with large gaps between each line.
 ------------------------------------------------
 In `Internal Printer Font' mode, you must only
 use a `Line Spacing' of 6 lpi or 8 lpi.

 This is because no custom line feed values can be
 sent to the printer to allow any other values.
 Therefore Auto spacing should not be used.

 NOTE: You also cannot use Paragraph-`Space Before'
 or `Space After'.



* PRINTING PROBLEM 8
 I have just printed out a document that I created
 in Wordworth 3.0a and a blank page was ejected
 after each page. I am using the same "Print
 Borders" as Wordworth v2 and v3.0a.
 ------------------------------------------------
 This is due to an improvement in the  printing
 technology. On some printers, the "Print Borders"
 may have to be changed to eliminate these blank
 pages being ejected.
