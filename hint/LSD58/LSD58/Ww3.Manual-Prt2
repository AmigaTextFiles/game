                                ·PART TWO·


                              11.2 EDIT MENU

 11.2.1 CUT

 Having selected text or an object, choose Cut command (Edit menu) or
press Right Aniga-X.

 This deletes the selection and stores it, ready for a Paste operation.
The storage area is referred to as the clipboard and can only hold one
item at a tine.

 IF the Cut or Copy command has been performed, performing another Cut or
Copy operation will replace the contents with the new item, losing the
previous item from the clipboard.



 11.2.2 COPY

 Having selected text or an object, choose Copy command (Edit menu), or
press Right Amiga-C.

 Copy takes a copy of the selected item and stores it in the clipboard,
replacing anything already in the clipboard. It is the same as Cut, except
it does not delete the item from the document.



 11.2.3 PASTE

 Having cut or copied text or an object, choose Paste command (Edit menu),
or press Right Amiga-V.

 This pastes a copy of the cupboard item into the document, at the
position of the insertion point. It does not remove the item from the
clipboard, so the Paste command can be used many times to paste multiple
copies from the cupboard into the document.

 If text is selected before using the Paste command, the selected text
will be replaced by the pasted text.

 When pasting text, the Overtype command is automatically disabled to
prevent text being accidentally overwritten (unless the text is selected
before using the Paste command).



 11.2.4 ERASE

 Having selected text or an object, choose Erase command (Edit menu), or
press Del or Backspace.

 This removes the item without affecting the cupboard, so anything already
stored on the cupboard (using the Cut or Copy command) will still be
available for a Paste command.

 Page 165



 11.2.5 UNDO

 Choose Undo command (Edit menu), or press Right Amiga-Z.

 Undoes the last editing command.

 For example, if selected text or an object is deleted, the deletion can
be reversed by choosing Undo. Only the last command can be undone, so if
one selection is deleted and then another selection deleted, only the
second delete command can be undone. This command is dimmed when
unavailable.



 11.2.6 REPEAT

 Choose Repeat command (Edit menu), or press Right Amiga-R.

 Repeats the last formatting command from the Format menu. It allows
formatting changes to be applied to new selections of text, quickly and
simply. This is most useful for applying a new typeface or paragraph
format to several headings or sub-hearings throughout a document. This
command is dimmed when unavailable.


11.2.7 FIND

 Choose Find command (Edit menu), or press Right Amiga-F.

11.2.10.9 List Entry (or press Left Alt-F7)

 Lists are created by marking the words or entries that you want. Then,
use the "Create List' Command (Tools menu) to Compile all of the marked
entries into a list at the insertion point.

 The Wordworth List command is useful for creating lists of diagrams,
figures or table of contents.

 MARKING LIST ENTRIES

 First insert list entries in the document (for example, Chapter One -
Space, 1.1 The Great Astronomers). You can do this in two ways:

 * Place the insertion point at the desired place.

 * Block select the desired text in the document.

 step 1

 Select "List Entry" (Insert command, Edit menu), or press Left-Alt F7.

 Figure 11-12 'Insert List Entry' requester

 The Lists box at the top of the requester shows lists that have already
been defined in the document. Either click the list name (for example,
Table of Contents) to which the entry should be added, or type a new name
into the Name text gadget to create a new list.

 Page 171

 step 2

 Type the name of the entry into the gadget titled Text (for example,
Chapter One). Then click insert.

 The list entry is inserted into the document, marked by a special
character code in front of the entry. (This character can be viewed by
choosing "Show Codes" command, View menu). The list entry character may be
deleted like any other to delete the entry from the list.

 When inserting list entries, up to seven sublevel may also be specified,
(for example, Chapter One - Space would be level 1,1.1 The Great
Astronomers would be level 2, and so on).

 If you wish to make another entry at the same level as one already
present in the list, select it from the "List Entries" gadget. This makes
it easier to insert entries at the current level, if you forget which
level your entry should be inserted.



 11.2.10.10 Insert Index Entry (or press Left Alt-F8)

 An index is created by marking the words or entries that you want. You
then use the "Create Index" command (Tools menu) which compiles all of the
entries into an index at the end of a document (preceded by a page break).

 MARKING INDEX ENTRIES

 First you should mark index entries in the document. There are two ways
to do this:

 * Place the insertion point at the desired place.

 * Block select the desired text in the document.

 Either select "Index Entry" (Insert command, Edit menu) and type the
name of the index entry in the "Main Entry" text box (for example, Space),
or block select the index entry in the document and then select "Index
Entry" (Insert command,

 Edit menu). Click Insert to insert the index entry at the insertion
point in the document.

 The index entry will be marked in the document by a special character.
This character can be viewed by choosing "Show Codes" command (View menu)
and can be deleted like any other, to delete the entry from the index.

 Index entries may be designated as "Main Entries" or Subentries.

 Page 172

 For example, Astronomers and Planets Would be subentries of the main
entry, Space. To add the word Astronomers as a subentry in the index, type
Space in the "Main Entry" text gadget and then type Astronomers into
"First Subentry".

 Figure 11-13 'Insert Index Entry' requester

 To add Planets as another subentry of Space, select Space from the list
and then type Planets into the "First Subentry' text gadget.

 When the index is created, the subentries are displayed under their Main
entry heading. In the previous example the index would appear like this:

    Space
       Astronomers  23
       Planets      15

 If you want to index all the occurrences of a particular word throughout
the document, just insert one index entry and select the "Include All
Other Occurrences" check box (you can exclude specific occurrences by
selecting the "Exclude This Occurrence" check box).

 Page 173

 For example, if you have Galileo four times in a document (pages 1, 4, 7
and 12), insert an index entry at the first occurrence (page 1 ), and
select "Include All Other Occurrences". To exclude the occurrence on page
7, select Galileo on page 7, and insert an index entry with "Exclude This
Occurrence" selected.

 The "Insert index entry" requester shows all the index entries currently
inserted. Subentries are displayed beneath their main entries.

 You can add a second level of subentry to Space, as a subentry of
Astronomers. To do this, click Astronomers (the Main and "First Subentry"
text gadgets are automatically filled with the correct titles, in this
example Space and Astronomers), and type Aristotle in the "Second
Subentry" text gadget.



 11.2.10.11 Endnote (or press Left Alt-F6)

 This places an automatically numbered note number at the insertion point,
after which the insertion point will move to the endnote section at the
end of the document.

 Choose Endnote (Insert command, Edit menu) to insert an endnote at the
end of the document. Type the endnote and then press Alt-Esc to return to
your original place in the document.



 11.2.10.12 Bookmark (or press Left Alt-F9).

 Bookmarks are used as place markers in long documents which you can
insert and then jump to at the click of the mouse. They make jumping from
one area of the document to another very easy.

 Choose Bookmark (insert command, Edit menu) to insert a bookmark at the
insertion point. Type a name for the bookmark in the text box and click
Insert.

 Page 174

 Figure 11-14 'Insert Bookmark' requester

 If you use the "Show Codes" command (View menu), you will be able to see
the bookmarks represented as small rectangles in the text. The bookmark
characters can be deleted like any other to delete the bookmark entry from
the document.

 You can jump to any bookmark using the "Go To" command (Edit menu).
Double-click the bookmark references which appears in the list on the "Go
To" requester (to jump to the last inserted Bookmark press Alt-Esc).

 Bookmarks are saved automatically with documents.

 Page 175



 11.2.10.13 Symbol (or press Left Alt-F1)

 This option allows you to insert any character for the current typeface
into your document (by clicking it) at the insertion point. This is
particularly useful for inserting foreign characters.

 Figure 11-15 'Insert Symbol' requester

 Click the characters you wish to insert and they will be placed into the
text gadget. You can also type characters into the text gadget. Click
Insert to place the contents of the text gadget into your document at the

 11.2.11 COLOURS

 Choose Colours command (Edit menu).

 Use the Colours command to edit the colours for colouring text and
objects. Colours created may not necessarily match their screen appearance
and so expect some variation when you print.

 Select the colour you wish to edit from the list gadget and create your
new colour with the red, green and blue sliders. Then, edit the name if
necessary and click OK.

 Page 176

 The new colour name will now appear in the pop-up colour list box

screen).

 Reset to Defaults: Resets the names and values to the values when you
first started Wordworth. To save new values permanently use "Save
Settings" command (Settings menu).



 11.2.12 SELECT ALL

Choose "Select All" command (Edit menu).

 If you are editing a document, "Select All" will select all of the text
in the document, but not individual text frames.

 To select text in a text frame object, place the insertion point in the
frame and choose "Select All".

 To select objects, select the Arrow pointer from the drawing tools before

 Figure 11-18 Paragraph requester

 This displays paragraph formatting commands which relate to a current
paragraph (the position of the insertion point). If consecutive paragraphs
need formatting select from anywhere in the first paragraph to anywhere in
the last paragraph.

 A paragraph is recognised as being from the character immediately
following a return character up to and including the next return
character. The return character is typed by pressing the Return key.

 SPACING

         line space equal to the type size).

 Loose   Provides extra space to accommodate for accents
         on foreign characters.

 6 LPI   Use with printer fonts. Line spacing equal to a pica typewriter's
         single line spacing. LPI (lines per inch) is the most common
         method used to measure line spacing on typewriters and word
         processors. Six lines per inch is often referred to as pica and
         is equivalent to 12 point line spacing.

 8 LPI   Use with printer fonts. Line spacing equal to an elite
         typewriter's single line spacing. Eight lines per inch is often
         referred to as elite.

 Custom  Type a specific value in points.

 IMPORTANT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 When using the "Print Method-Printer Font", make sure that the line
spacing is set to 6 lpi or 8 lpi, paragraph spacing 0 and single line
spacing.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Line Spacing: Single (proportional to the current type size),

 Double (proportional to the current type size, but giving line space
equal to twice the type size), 1½ (proportional to the current type size,
but giving line space equal to one-and-one-half the type size).

 INDENTATION

 Left: Indent (set in) from the left margin.

 First Line: Indent the first line from the left indent.

 The indent can be set to a negative value provided the Left is equal to
or greater than the negative "First Line".

 For example, in this paragraph, the Left indent is set to 2 cm and "First
              Line" to -2 cm, the first line is set to the left margin and
              successive lines are indented by 2 cm. This is called a
              'hanging indent'.

 Right: Indent from the right margin.

when the Hyphenation command (Settings menu) is selected.



 11.4.3 TABS

 Choose Tabs command (Format menu).

 As tabs are paragraph related, it is not necessary to select the whole
paragraph but just place the insertion point anywhere within the
paragraph.

 If the tabs are to be applied to consecutive paragraphs, select from
anywhere in the first paragraph to anywhere in the last paragraph. To
select the entire document, choose "Select All" command (Settings menu).

 A paragraph is recognised as a block of text from the character
immediately following a return character up to and including the next
return character (the return character is generated by pressing the Return
key). Often tabulised text can be a series of single lines each ending
with a return character and so each line is considered to be a paragraph.

 Page 184

 Figure 11-19 Tabs requester

 There are four tab styles: Left, Right, Centred and Decimal.

 Left aligning     Text starts at tab position and flows right.

 Right aligning    Text starts at tab position and flows left. The right-
                   most character will always be at the tab position,
                   preceding text coming from the left. If the space
                   between the tab character and the actual tab position
                   is filled by text, then any extra text typed in will
                   start to flow to the right of the tab.

 Centre aligning   Text starts at tab position and flows equally to the
                   left and right, leaving the text centred around the tab
                   position.

 Decimal aligning  Used for columns of figures which include decimal
                   points (for example, 2.4, 567.1, 45.843). Figures will
                   align so that the decimal points automatically align
                   one above the other. The character used as the decimal
                   point may be set from the "Text Settings" requester
                   ("Change Settings" command, Settings menu).

 Page 185

 To place a tab at a required position on the ruler, first Click New and
use the radio buttons to select the tab style you want. Type the position
of the tab in the Position text gadget and press the Return key. The tab
will appear in the "Defined Tabs" list.

 Tabs can be deleted from the list by selecting the tab and clicking
Delete. To edit a tab, select it from the list and change its style or
position using the appropriate gadgets.

 Default Tabs: This sets the spacing interval of the default tabs (left
justified style) from the zero position on the ruler. They are shown on
the ruler as short horizontal lines. The default tab interval (for
example, 1 inch, 3 cms), is based on the measurement, which is selected
from the "View Settings" requester ("Change Settings" command, Settings
menu).

 Fill Character: This sets the padding character for all tabs in the

 Figure 11-25A Drawing Tools palette

 Page 192

 The arrow pointer changes to a crosshair to indicate that Wordworth is
ready to create the object you selected. Click on the page and drag
outward to the size you require. The object appears on the page and the
cursor reverts back to an arrow pointer (unless you selected "Create Many
Objects", which keeps the crosshair, ready to draw more objects).

 Selected objects can be dragged anywhere on the page. They have handles
for re-sizing (as the arrow pointer passes over a handle it changes into
either a double-arrow or crosshair, with which you can click and drag a
handle).

 To change the parameters of a selected object double-click it, or choose
information from the Object menu.



 11.5.2 PLACE PICTURE

 Choose "Place Picture" command (Object menu). You can either place a
picture directly onto the page, or draw a picture frame first and then
place a picture image in it.

 However, you cannot use this command when your document contains printer
fonts (refer "Print Method", "Print Setup" command, Project menu).

 Shows a requester to open an existing picture document. Any standard
Amiga IFF graphics file can be opened in any resolution or size, 2 to 256
colours, HAM or Extra-Half-Brite images. Additional picture format support
includes BMP, PCX, TIFF, IMG, GIF, GEM vector, CGM vector (if the
appropriate filters have been installed).

 If the file is a HAM picture, it will automatically be translated into an
Extra-Half-Brite image.

 For details about using pictures from paint packages, the Wordworth Clip
Art collection, and printing advice, see Appendix C-Pictures And Clip Art.

 Click OK to place the screen version of the picture. In a few
 seconds the picture will appear at the top left corner of the page in the
document. Pictures opened into Wordworth are inserted on the same page as
the insertion point, at a specific position on the page. They are not
inserted into the text so, as text is edited around them, they stay where
they are.

 Vector, or Scalable, graphics will take slightly longer to display as
they are constructed using mathematical equations.

 Page 193

 The screen version of the picture may be different to the printed version
as it will only be displayed using the colours available for display (by
default this will be 8 colours).

 Figure 11-26 Picture placed in text

 Alternatively, select the "Picture Frame" object ("Choose Object
"command" Object menu), draw a frame on the page and, with the frame
selected, choose "Place Picture" command. The picture will then be scaled
to fit the frame.

 Click the picture to show a frame with sizing handles. The picture may be
moved around the page by dragging.

 To re-size the picture, drag one of the sizing handles (the small
squares) at the edge of the frame or picture, to reduce its size.

 To maintain the same aspect ratio (the relation between the width and
height) of the picture when sizing hold down the Ctrl key while dragging
the sizing handles.

 The size can be set more accurately using the Information command (Object
menu). Double-click the picture or,  with the picture selected, choose

APPENDIX A-GETTING TECHNICAL SUPPORT


 Before contacting technical support, check Appendix I-Troubleshooting,
check For a READ.ME document on the Ww3InstaII-1 disk, and inspect the
Troubleshooting part of the on-line Help.

 Although every effort has been made to make Wordworth as easy to use as
possible, with SO many different configurations of Amiga hardware,
software, and peripherals, and new products appearing monthly, there may
be important information in the READ.ME document which affects you.

 You would be amazed at some of the letters we receive. For example:

 Dear Digita.

 I recently purchased Wordworth for my computer and am very pleased with
it. When printing an extra blank page is used.

 This is very annoying.

 Yours sincerely.


 This letter fails to fully describe the problem, which means we can't
help you. If you need to write to us, follow this example:

 Dear Digita,

 I recently purchased Wordworth for mu Amiga, my licence number is
9826364.

 My computer system comprises an Amiga A1200, with a 4mb expansion, second
disk drive and a Hewlet Packard Deskjet 500 Plus printer. I am using
version 3 of workbench and Wordworth 3.

 When printing a document, after each page printed an extra blank sheet is
fed through the printer. I have enclosed a sample of the document on disk
together with a sample print out.

 I hope the above will be sufficient for you to find a solution, if You
require any further information my day time number is 0395 270273.

 Yours sincerely

 Page 241

 It also helps to give a clear explanation. Offending document was
provided on disk, with a printed copy, which gives us a clear
understanding of the problem. A day time number was provided, which means,
in exceptional circumstances, we can telephone if we need Further
information, or the solution could be explained better verbally.

 It would really help us to help you if you could follow these steps if
you need to contact us for help:



 WHEN TELEPHONING

 Telephone support is available to registered users from 11 AM until 5PM.
Simply call 0*91 61 6 944. Calls are charged at 36p per minute cheap rate
and 48p per minute at all other tines. Be sure to ask permission of the
telephone owner before calling.

 1. Have the following information available:

 * Wordworth license number (you won't get support without it).

 * Amiga system (model, amount of memory, and so on).

 * Workbench version.

 * Wordworth version (refer About command, Project menu).

 2. Have your Amiga near the telephone and make sure you are able to
reproduce the problem.

 Page 242


 WHEN WRITING

 1. As above.

 2. Give as much information as possible. Explain the fault in detail,
don't rely on us remembering the telephone conversation.

 3. Enclose a Copy of the document that is giving problems, together with
a Copy of the WordworthPrefs file on disk. This file is found on your
WordWorth3 disk (or in your Wordworth3 drawer on your hard disk) and
should be dragged onto the floppy disk icon you are sending us. If it's a
printer problem, enclose printouts.

 4. Check your disks for viruses before sending them. It is totally
irresponsible to send Computer disks without checking for viruses.

 5. Unless specifically requested, do not send the instruction book and
packaging.

 IMPORTANT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Enclose a stamped self-addressed padded envelope (so that we
 can return your disks).

                APPENDIX B- DESIGNING DOCUMENTS WITH STYLE

 Using a typewriter to produce letters has always been limiting. Most of
us concentrated on avoiding typing mistakes-keeping the style as simple as
possible.

 With modern-day word processors like Wordworth, the possibilities are
endless! Facilities such as the spelling checkers, glossary, spacing text
back, and editing allow you to produce perfect documents.

 And so, with the basics taken care of, let us consider the cosmetic
aspects of the letter itself-what it actually looks like on the page. One
of the major advantages of Wordworth is that during the editing process,
the WYSIWYG screen shows exactly how a printed document will look,
including multiple fonts, styles and point sizes, graphics and so on.

 Choosing a type style, type size, leading and so on are described in a
later section in this chapter, "Typography".



 SIMPLE GUIDELINES

 Style-when you print your document, is it visually appealing?

  As you get to know Wordworth, you will discover a vast selection of text
formatting facilities. It is possible to mix a variety of type styles and
sizes on one page, but remember, simplicity is the modem trend. These
facilities are designed to give you flexibility and control over your
document, but try to resist the temptation to experiment mixing too many
styles on one page. You will find good examples of getting the mix right
in daily newspapers or magazines.

 Some people, unable to write sentences which impress, arouse curiosity or
create interest, think that CAPITAL LETTERS or varying type styles
substitute for skilful writing.

 They are wrong! Type style effects may not attract special attention, and
can give a letter an unbalanced appearance.

 During the 1940's when there was a paper shortage, words were crammed on
to pages to save paper. This does not apply today, and a sheet of paper
overflowing with words is as hard to digest as an over-will plate of food.

 All documents should have a picture frame appearance, the typescript
representing the picture, and the white rectangular surround, the picture
mounting. On an A4 sheet, the side margins should be about 1 inch, and
proportionally less for smaller sheets of paper.


 Page 245

 MAKE SURE YOUR LETTER IS REALLY GOOD LOOKING!

 You may wish to instill a little individuality into your correspondence.
Try using a larger left margin. Most letters are all left-justified, take
a look at the following Pages which show variations on a basic letter
style.



 TITLE

 A person's name and title is one of their proudest possessions, and so
make sure you get it right.

 Mr or Esq-An esquire was originally a squire or shield bearer, or a
knight's attendant. It was a title of dignity, ranking just below that of
a knight. The word is now a title of respect when used for addressing
letters. Both writers and recipients obviously still like to believe that
they are esquire, and not just plain misters. The choice is yours, but you
should note that Mr is the correct form of address.

 Miss, Mrs or Ms: If you know their correct title, use it. If not, Ms is
the correct Form of address.



 WORDS

 Never use a long word if a short one makes for equal clarity.
 Some people use long words, believing that they imply good
 education and a knowledge of semantics.

 Never use a long word if a short one makes for equal clarity. Some people
use long words, believing that they imply good education and a knowledge
of semantics.

 Mark Twain wrote: "I never write metropolis when I can get paid the same
sum for city."

 Some people love words and take endless trouble in selecting the exact
word for the occasion. If you are a perfectionist, or just want to be an
outstandingly good writer, use Wordworth's thesaurus. It will help you to
find the exact word you want. For example, you might write: Wordworth is
wonderful. But would any of these be more apt: extraordinary, marvellous,
remarkable, superb.

 Fowler gave this advice: "Anyone who wishes to become a good writer
should endeavour, before he allows himself to be tempted by more showy
qualities, to be direct, simple, brief, vigorous, and lucid. Prefer the
familiar Word to the far-fetched. Prefer the concrete word to the
abstract. Prefer the single word to the circumlocution. Prefer the short
word to the long. Prefer the Saxon Word to the Romance."

 Page 246



 SPELLING

 Wordworth's spelling checker will check your misspellings, but look out
for wrongful use of similar sounding words. The common ones are

 accept        except
 adapt         adopt
 advice        advise
 affect        effect
 formerly      formally
 gauge         gage
 imply         infer
 moral         morale
 personal      personnel
 practise      practice
 principle     principal
 their         there
 too           two



 ABBREVIATIONS

 Abbreviations are fine for technical notes, but not in the context of
normal text. Avoid Latin abbreviations in particular:

 ABBREVIATION    REPLACE WITH

 etc.            and so on, and others, and so forth

 e.g.            for example

 i.e.            that is

 et al           and others



 TYPEFACES

 With the introduction of computers into printing processes another leap
forward has been achieved. Programs like Wordworth can show the typeface
and style on the screen while typing in the text, removing the guess-work
from using typefaces as designer tools.

 Large numbers of typefaces can be stored on a computer for immediate use:
large, bold styles for emphasis, fancy styles to convey a feeling of
finesse.

 For example, it would not be appropriate to use the typeface Emerald for
a builders' merchant where a feeling of strength is required.

 Page 247

 Just as Topaz bold would not seem quite right for a fine art
 dealer.

 For company reports, statements of account and other long documents
consisting mainly of text, the typeface needs to be chosen for legibility.
Some typefaces can be very effective where display emphasis is required,
but can be very difficult to read when used for large block of text.

 So the choice of typeface is therefore very important for the size of the
document being produced.

 Although there are many type styles available on modern computer-based
word processing and desktop publishing systems, they can be broken down
into various groups.

 The three main groups are serif, sans serif and script styles:

 * A serif is the small extra cross-stroke on the ends of the lines
   describing the characters. It is a traditional style and offers good
   legibility with a more conservative appearance. Times is perhaps the
   best known and was developed for The Times newspaper where legibility
   in a variety of sizes had to be combined with a fairly compact format
   to get as much text as reasonably possible in a overall design of the
   type style, from Times with a relatively fine serf to Rockwell with its
   bold slab serif. Courier is very similar to a conventional typewriter
   style but still has a serif and so is included in this group.

 Times in this example:

 * Sans serf (sans coming from the French word meaning "without") does not
   have these extra strokes. These styles are more modern yet still offer
   good legibility. Because of their open, uncluttered nature, and the
   evenness of the lines forming the style, they maintain a good
   appearance at any size or style.

 Helvetica in this example:

 * Script style covers perhaps the largest range of all. It includes
   classic copperplate script (often called Palace Script) and modern
   fancy styles such as Emerald and Garnet, even calligraphic styles such
   as Sapphire (sometimes called German Text or Old English).

   Script styles tend to be used for main display lines only. Because of
   their fancy nature they can be very eye-catching where just a few words
   are used in a large size. Although the legibility of these styles tends
   to be reduced by their intricacy, their use in a large size will
   overcome this and so emphasis is maintained. If used too small or in
   too great a quantity the lack of legibility will cause people to skip
   over the text as it becomes too difficult to read.

   Palace Script in this example:




 TYPE SIZE AND LINE SPACING

 When typing in a display format for leaflets, cover pages, etc., where
there will be few words but emphasis is required, a change of type size
can be used instead of changing the typeface.

 The major consideration when using type sizes in a display situation is
to prioritise which lines need most emphasis. It is often useful to write
numbers to represent the priority of each line, 1 for the highest
priority, 2 for the next, and so on. In this way it is easier to assess
the overall effect of various type sizes on the whole document before
actually typing the words.

 The advantage of modern WYSIWYG ("What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get") sytems
like Wordworth is being able to see all the type styles and size on the
screen, as they will appear on the final printout, and being able to alter
the formatting information to see what effect it will have on the overall
display, without having to continually print test sheets.

 Page 249

 When typing in long documents consisting mainly of text like company
reports, books or long letters, the need for emphasis is less important
than achieving a consistent and legible format throughout the whole
document.

 A type size must be chosen that will keep the number of pages to a
minimum to reduce the print time, but consideration must be given to the
legibility of the text.

 If a small type size is used over a long line length, it is very much
harder to read-think of those terms and Conditions on the back of so many
orders and invoices.

 The human eye has great difficulty in returning from the end of a long
line of small text to the beginning of the next, all too easily skips one
or more lines. It is then necessary to re-read the end of the previous
line to see if text has been missed. If a small type size is required it
may be beneficial to increase the left and right margin settings so
decreasing the line length slightly to make the lines "scan" more easily.

 Printers use the "points" system of measurement to define type sizes and
line spacing. This is a regression to the very early metal type.
Originally, each size was denoted by a name rather than a measurement,
but, as mechanisation took over the composition of text, these sizes
needed to be defined exactly so that all machines would be able to use all
manufactured type. The system of measurement which evolved is based on a
unit the point which is 1/72 of an inch.

 The other major unit in this system is the pica (pronounced "pie-car"),
which is 1/6 of an inch, giving six picas to the inch. The standard
typewriter sizes of pica and elite originate from the early days of type
when the sizes were known by names. Pica is generally considered to be 12
point type size, and elite 9 point size.

 Figure B-1 Type sizes

 Page 250

 This also relates to the line spacing. Pica (12 point type) single line
spaced is 6 lines to the inch (72 divided by 12), whereas Elite (9 point
type size) single spaced is 8 lines to the inch (72 divided by 9).

 Although the unit of 1/72 of an inch may seem an unusual one, with usage
it is effective. One point difference is small enough to provide fine
adjustment yet not become cumbersome, and large enough to still show a
definite difference in size and so emphasis. The measurement of a type
size is taken from the top of a capital letter to the bottom of a
descending letter, like 'y' or 'g,' and not just the height of a capital
letter.

 Figure B-2 Positions of type alignment


 Another very important factor in the appearance of any document is the
line spacing-the spacing from the base of one line of text to the base of
the next line. Note that the measurement should be taken from one base
(the bottom of a  capital letter, the line on which all characters except
descenders should sit), to the base of the next line. This means that, if
using a custom measurement in points rather than 6 or 8 lines to the inch,
or Auto, the line spacing must be equal to or greater than the type size.
If 13 point type size is being used then custom line spacing should be set
to at least 13 or the lines will overlap one another and become illegible
(refer Paragraph command, Format menu).

 Figure B-3 Line spacing

 Line spacing is referred to as "leading" (pronounced "LED-ing" ), which
derives from early typesetting when strips of lead were placed between
lines of metal type for spacing:

 Finally, you may wish to change the spacing between individual letters.
This is called tracking. Adjusting tracking can reduce or increase the
spacing between letters, which is particularly useful for headings (refer
Font command, Format menu).

 Figure B-4 Tracking

 The requirements of display and long text document setting
 are somewhat different.

 In display setting it is often thought necessary to fill the page with
type, using large sizes and close spacing to cover as much of the paper as
possible. This is usually counter-productive as the display will appear
cramped and generally people do not tend to read it. Judicious use of
"white space" (leaving space around lines) on commands of high priority
can be much more effective as the line stands out more on its own, rather
than being cramped by other text. It is much more likely to be read at a
glance, gaining the reader's attention and encouraging them to study the
rest of the information.

 In a long text document, the need for ease of reading is more important
than emphasising particular lines. Just as a small type size can make the
text harder to read, so tight line spacing can make it much more difficult
to follow from the end of one line to the beginning of the next.

 Page 253

 If a page of text looks like a solid black mass it becomes very hard to
read because of the increased concentration needed to keep to the correct
line and hence Concentration on the content is reduced.

 For large blocks of text a spacing of at least 10% (one tenth) more than
the type size will make it easier to read. For example, if using the Auto
leading options, use a 1.5 "Line Height" rather than Single; if using
Custom line spacing with a type size of 12 point, make the spacing at
least 14 to increase legibility.



 MARGINS

 Margins are the spaces from the edge of a sheet of paper to the beginning
of the text area on a page. The left and right margins set the length of
the text line and so are important to the legibility and readability of
the text. The amount of white space created by the margins is very
important to the overall look of the page-too small margins make the page
look cramped, too wide can substantially increase the number of pages and
hence the amount of paper used and time taken to print out. Using 1.5
inch margins on an A4 page instead of 0.5 inch margins will decrease the
text area by 20 per cent. Using one inch margins would therefore seem to
be a reasonable combination of the needs of white space for appearance and
maximum type area.

 Margins in Wordworth are set in Document command (Format menu) and Can
take two formats, depending on whether or not 'Facing pages' and "Mirror
Margins Onto Left Pages" have been selected.

 If selected, your left margin will become your right margin on left hand
page (even page), and right margin will become the left hand margin on the
even page.

 This is for a "book" format, where with a multi-page document each sheet
of paper will be printed on both sides and opened out so viewing two pages
at a time. The margins on the inside, where the two pages meet, may need
to be wider than the margins on the outside edges, to accommodate holes
for ring binding or staples.

 Page 254

 In this case the left-hand pages will have a wide margin on the right
(inside) edge for the binding and a narrower margin on the left (outside)
edge. The right-hand page will be a mirror image of the left-hand page,
having a wide margin on the left (inside) edge and a narrower margin on
the right (outside) edge.


 Figure B-5 Facing pages margins layout

 If the document is to be perfect bound (by sticking a cover onto the
spine and wrapping it around the document) or saddle stitched (printed as
two pages on each side of the paper, folded in half and stapled on the
fold) then the usual format is to make the inside margins narrower than
the outside margins as, when the book is opened out flat, the two inside
margins being side by side appear as one very wide margin between the two
pages.

 If "Facing pages" is not selected, the layout will be "single page",
where text will appear on only one side of the paper. As there is no
longer a left and right-hand page of text, the margins need to be the same
on all pages. All the pages can be considered right hand pages
irrespective of the binding method.

 When considering margins, remember the Header and Footer areas. The Top
and Bottom margins are the distance from the top and bottom of the page to
the main document text, and the Header and Footer margins are the distance
from the top and bottom of the page to the header or footer text.
