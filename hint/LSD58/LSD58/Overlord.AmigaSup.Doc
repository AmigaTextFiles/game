                        OVERLORD - AMIGA SUPPLEMENT
                        ===========================
                                          
                                              TYPED BY SHARD - N&B
LOADING AND INSTALLATION

To run Overlord first switch off your Amiga.

Insert the bot disk into the Amigas internal floppy drive and then switch on.

The program will now autoboot and subsequent disks will be requested as needed.

You may wish to install Overlord to a hard disk. To do so load up Workbench,
insert the Overlord boot disk into the internal floppy drive and select the
Install icon.  This will run the hard disk install program, just follow the on
screen instructions to complete the installation.

Once you have installed Overlord just read the instructions given at the end of
the installation process. These instructions are also copied to the hard drive 
in a text file called Read.Me.

MUSIC

To play Overlord with music you require 1.5 meg of memory. If you are running
Overlord with less than 1.5 meg then the music will be automatically turned off.

RUNNING OVERLORD

When you load Overlord the first screen you see contains a short menu of several
options.

Here is what they do:

CREDITS

The rolling credits can be exited by pressing the Escape key or clicking with 
the right mouse button.

CONFIGURE

This selection takes you to a screen which enables you to change the default
settings.  When you save the game the configuration settings are also saved, so
that when you re-load your saved game the chosen options will act as the default
settings.

For more information on the individual configuration setings see page 165 of the
manual

It is possible to change the configuration later during the game. However,
changes made during a game will not transfer to your next new game.

SCRAMBLE

Select scramble and you will be placed in your aircraft just off the coast of
Northern Cherbourg.

When you have completed your mission you can return to your base at Tangmere
where, after you have landed, you will be treated as a new pilot starting a new
game.  For more information on flying your aircraft, weapons and combat see 
pages 117 - 146 of the main manual.

LOAD GAME

This option reloads a previously saved game. Games can be saved by going to the
Gatehouse from the Tangmere screen.

NEW GAME

This option takes you to the main Tangmere menu screen to begin a new Overlord
game.

For more information on this menu see page 148 of the main manual.

SAVING THE GAME

Please note that if you are running Overlord from floppy disks you will need a
pre-formatted disk to save your game to. This disk needs to be called USER. We
recommend that you create two save game disks. By using two disks you will
minimise the chance of losing your saved games should one become corrupted or
unusable.

MANUAL ADDENDUM

The following are a list of differences relevant to the Amiga that are not 
covered in the main manual.
