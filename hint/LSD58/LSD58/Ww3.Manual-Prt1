Firstly, I would like to thank DIT for a great job concerning the 
Wordsworth 3 docs and Pictures. Although there are approx 1.2megs of
pictures that belong to these docs, I could not display the full
range within this issue, So for the next few issues of the LSD Docs
Disks, I will be adding a certain amount of the Wordsworth 3 Pictures
to each isssue until the full amount have been displayed. <><

     A Few Word about the Law

 A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE LAW
 -------------------------

 When you open the envelope containing  the  Wordworth disks, you agree to
accept the terms of the Digita  software license (contained in the chapter
titled "Terms And Conditions of  Sale",  in  this book). The license gives
you the right to install Wordworth on one computer and make a backup copy.

 When you violate the license, you  violate  the Copyright Act, which says
it's illegal to make or distribute  copies of copyrighted material without
authorisation from  the  copyright  owner.  The  Act  also  prohibits  the
commercial rental, leasing, or lending of software without the copyright
owner's written permission.

 Each time you copy software illegally, you  or your company risk facing a
considerable fine. And  if  you  do  it  "wilfully  and  for  purposes of
commercial advantage," you could go to jail.

WARNING

 All Digita products contain copyright material in the form of proprietary
software programmes and this printed  book.  Digita will seek considerable
damages from any person and / or  organisation found to be in violation of
the copyrights. Breach of copyright can also lead to criminal proceedings.

YOU A SOFTWARE PIRATE?

 You may not be aware of it, but if you answer "yes" to any of the
questions below, you've probably violated software copyright law..

 Have You Ever
 * Given away an old version of software when you received an upgrade.?

 * Given a copy of your software to a colleague at work?

 * "Borrowed" someone's software to try it out, then never purchased it?

 * Left copies of your software on a hard disk when you sold a computer?

 * Used software on the hard disk of a previously owned computer without
   paying for it?

 (This list is not exhaustive.)

 Page xii

The Benefits of Using Legal Software

 When  you  use  legal   copies   of   software,  you  receive  timesaving
documentation and product support.  You  minimise  the  risk  of copying a
software virus on your computer. And  if  your original disk gets damaged,
you can get up-to-date replacements.  What's  more, you can receive timely
notification of product upgrades.

 But beyond the tangible benefits,  you're  also  purchasing the, right to
legitimately use software that took a team of hard working people years
and thousands of pounds to produce.

 Your purchase is a vote. It's your way of rewarding the team that created
the great software. And it's your way  of encouraging and enabling them to
produce even better products in the future.

graphics".  The  tutorials  centre  on  specific  features  of  Wordworth,
relevant to the task required.

 However, before you start reading any more, it is important to understand
typographic conventions used in this book:

 Convention          MEANS

 Italics type        Indicates words or characters you type. For example,
                     "type mydocument in the File text gadget". They are
                     also used to indicate program or disk names. For
                     example, "use the InstallOutlines program, which is
                     on your Ww3 Extras disk".

                     1.1 What You Should Already Know

 To set up Wordworth on  your  Amiga,  you  need an understanding of basic
Amiga concepts. Before you begin, you should know how to:

 * Use icons on the Amiga Workbench.

 * Use the mouse to point, drag click and double-click.

 * Start and quit applications using Workbench.

 * How to initialize and copy disks using the Shell and Workbench.

 * Open, copy, and delete Amiga documents and disks from Workbench.

 * Select menus, pull down menus and choose commands.

 * Scroll in windows, and re-size and re-position windows.

 If you are not familiar with these terms or processes, see your
Amiga owner's guide.

 Page 25



                      1.2 Preparing to Use Wordworth

 You have been provided with four master disks.

 It's important to work with  copies  of  your Wordworth disks rather than
the originals. If a copy  is  damaged  or  lost,  you  can  go back to the
original and make another copy.

 step 1

 Make backup copies of your master disks.

 Before copying the master disks, slide up the small tab (if it exists) in
the upper-left corner on the  back  of  each  disk  so  that  it is in the
uppermost position (the tab will no longer  be visible from the front side
of the disk). This locks  information  on  the disk, preventing accidental
deletion of files and documents.

 step 2

 Now copy each disk as follows.

 Switch on your Amiga and  insert  the disk titled Workbench. Double-click
the Workbench disk icon, double-click the  System drawer, and then double-
click the Shell icon.

 Type: Sys:System/diskcopy from DF0: to DF1: and press the
 Return key (be sure to type a zero, not the letter O).

 step 3

 Now place the original master  disk  in  the  internal disk drive and the
backup disk in the second drive. When prompted, press the Return key.

 Page 26

 Make a backup copy of all the disks using this procedure and then put the
originals away in a safe place.

 Important

 If you make backups from  Workbench  be  sure  to rename the backup disks
removing copy of and make sure there are no hidden spaces contained in the
disk titles.

 Page 27



                             1.3 Installation

 You need to install Wordworth once before  you can use it. Once Wordworth
has been successfully instilled, you  do  not  need  to repeat the process
again unless you wish to add extra Wordworth modules.



 1.3.1 Installing Wordworth

 Floppy disk users
 You need to have the following items before you can begin:

 * The four backup copies of your Wordworth master disks (to make backup
   copies, follow the procedures outlined in section 1.2 "Preparing to Use
   Wordworth").

 * At least five blank floppy disks onto which Wordworth will be
   installed.

 Throughout this  procedure  you  will  be  prompted  to  change  disks as
necessary (for example, Insert volume Ww3System in any drive).

 step 1

 Switch on your Amiga and insert the disk titled Ww3Install-1.

 step 2

 When the desktop appears,  double-click  the  Ww31nstall-1 disk icon, and
then double-click the install Wordworth 3 icon.

 step 3

 Before the  installation  begins,  you  will  be  asked  to  specify your
knowledge of the Amiga:

 Novice        A basic installation is automatically performed for you.
               From time-to-time the installer may ask you to insert other
               disks.

 Intermediate  A basic installation is automatically performed for you.
               Occasionally, you may be asked to make certain choices that
               will affect the installation.

 Expert        You will be asked to make choices as to which features are
               installed for you.

 Click Proceed to start the installation.

 step 4

 When prompted, select the radio button  titled "On Floppy Disks" and then
click the Proceed button to start the installation process.

 Page 28

 step 5

 Novice users only-the installer will install Wordworth 3 onto your set of
blank  disks.  Some  of  the  more  advanced  features  (such  as  Tables,
TextEffects, TrueType  and  PostScript  font  support,  graphic  and  text
filters) will not be installed.

 Now go to step 7.

 step 6

 Intermediate or Expert Users only-the  installer  will  ask you to select
the type of installation you require:

 Partial   The more advanced features are not installed, these are Tables,
           TextEffects, TrueType and PostScript font support, graphic and
           text filters.

 Full      All features of Wordworth 3 are automatically installed for
           you.

 Custom    You will be given the ability to choose exactly what files
           (features) are installed.

 If you use a PostScript printer you will need a hard disk drive.

 step 7

 Before the end of  the  installation  you  will  be  asked to select your
printer model from a list. To move  up  and  down the list, use the scroll
arrows to the right of the list entries.

 If your printer does not appear in the list, refer to your "Printer
User Manual" to find the most suitable equivalent (you may find this under
a section titled Emulations). If you can't  find a suitable printer in the
list then select 'Printer Not Listed".

 Click OK to install your printer.

 IMPORTANT
 If you get a message to insert a disk which is already in the drive, then
the disk is incorrectly titled and needs renaming.

 A  message  will  appear  to  confirm  that  the  installation  has  been
successfully  completed.  Now  reset  your  Amiga  with  the  disk  titled
Wordworth3 in the  internal  drive  and  refer  to  Chapter Two, "Starting
Wordworth".

 Page 29


 Hard Disk Users

 You will need a minimum of 3MB  of  disk  space to install Wordworth 3 to
hard disk.

 This installation copies Wordworth  into  a  drawer  titled Wordworth3 on
your hard disk. Within this drawer,  the installer will copy the Wordworth
files, thesaurus,  dictionary  files,  program  modules,  fonts,  tutorial
documents, some Digita  Clip  Art,  a  selection  of  Wordworth Templates,
icons, graphic and text filters, and the Wordworth help files.

 step 1

 Switch on your computer and wait  for  the Workbench desktop to appear as
normal.

 step 2

 When the Workbench appears, insert  the disk titled Ww31nstall-1. Double-
click the  disk  icon  and  then  double-click  the  icon  titled  install
Wordworth 3.

 step 3

 Before the  installation  begins,  you  will  be  asked  to  specify your
knowledge of the Amiga:

 Novice        A basic installation is automatically performed for you.
               From time-to-time the installer may ask you to insert
               appropriate disks.

 Intermediate  A basic installation is automatically performed for you.
               Occasionally, you may be asked to make certain choices that
               will affect the installation.

 Expert        You will be asked to make choices as to which features are
               installed for you.

 Click Proceed to start the installation.

 step 4

 When prompted, select the radio button  titled  "On A Hard Disk" and then
click the Proceed button to start the installation.

 Page 30

 step 5

 Novice users only-the installer will  install  Wordworth 3 onto your hard
disk. At  the  end  of  the  installation,  you  will  be  told  where the
Wordworth3 drawer containing the Wordworth  program  is situated. (On most
hard disks,  this  will  be  the  partition  titled  Work.  However,  if a
partition of this name does not exist, the installer will make an informed
guess.)

 Some of the more advanced features (such as Tables, TextEffects, TrueType
and PostScript  font  support,  graphic  and  text  filters)  will  not be
installed.

 Now go to step 7.

 Intermediate or Expert user's the  installer  will  ask you to select the
destination for Wordworth (where you wish  the Wordworth program and files
to be  located  on  your  hard  disk).  Insert  the  appropriate  disks as
requested.

 step 6

 Intermediate or Expert Users  Only-You  will  be  prompted to choose what
type of installation you require:

 Partial    The more advanced features are not installed, these are
            Tables, TextEffects, TrueType and PostScript font support,
            graphic and text filters. You will need a minimum of 3MB of
            disk space.

 Full       All features of Wordworth 3 are automatically installed for
            you. You will need a minimum of 5MB of disk space.

 Custom     You will be given the ability to choose exactly what files are
            installed. A minimum of 3MB of disk space will be needed (the
            maximum is 5MB).

 You will also need about  1MB  disk  space  in  your system partition for
Wordworth libraries, fonts and other files.

 Your Amiga system and the  amount  of  memory available will decide which
Wordworth modules can be installed.


 IMPORTANT
 If you get a message to insert a disk which is already in the drive, then
the disk is incorrectly titled and needs renaming.

 Page 31

 step 7

 Before the end of  the  installation  you  will  be  asked to select your
printer model from a list. To move  up  and  down the list, use the scroll
arrows to the right of the list entries.

 If your printer does not appear in  the  list, refer to your Printer User
Manual" to find the most suitable  equivalent  (you  may find this under a
section titled Emulations). If you  can't  find  a suitable printer in the
list then select ' Printer Not Listed.

 Click OK to install your printer.

 A  message  will  appear  to  confirm  that  the  installation  has  been
successfully completed. Now reset your  Amiga  as  usual (ensuring that no
Wordworth disks  are  in  the  internal  drive)  and  refer  Chapter  Two,
"Starting Wordworth".


 1.3.2 Adding More Wordworth Modules

 Floppy Disk Users: Create a new  set  of Wordworth disks by repeating the
installation procedure. When installing click "Expert Mode' and then click
Custom. From the list select the modules you wish to install.

 Page 34

                            STARTING WORDWORTH

 Floppy Disk Users

 Insert the disk titled Wordworth3 into the internal disk drive and switch
on your Amiga. Double-click  the  Wordworth3  disk  icon, and then double-
click the Wordworth program icon  (sometimes  you  may be prompted to swap
disks, this is normal as  Wordworth  searches  for  files located on other
disks).

 IMPORTANT
 Be sure to use the Wordworth3 disk, not your Amiga Workbench disk.

 Hard Disk Users

 Double-click the Wordworth icon located in  the Wordworth3 drawer on your
hard disk.

The first time you start Wordworth, you will be prompted to type:

 * Your name.

 * The name of your organization. (If this is not applicable, type your
   name again.)

 * Your license number (this appears on your registration card).


 * Click OK.

 You must type information into all three boxes.


 IMPORTANT
 Don't forget to return the prepaid portion of the registration card. Only
registered Wordworth users receive  technical  support and special upgrade
discounts.

 Once you have personalized the program, your name and details will appear
every time you  start  Wordworth,  confirming  that  you  are a registered
licensed user. If you do not personalize Wordworth correctly, you will be
returned to the Workbench screen.

 Page 35

Wordworth does not work  without  an  open  document.  When  you start the
program or close a document, a  new  untitled document will open. However,
as soon as you open another document, the untitled document will disappear
(unless you have been working on it).

 Each document is a separate multitasking window. This means, for example,
if you open two documents, you  could  be  printing one whilst editing the
other.

 To start Wordworth,  double-click  the  Wordworth  icon.  This will start
Wordworth and the untitled Normal (preset) template document.

the list gadget.

 You  can  also  seleingle line spacing. Eight lines per inch is often
         referred to as elite.

 Custom  Type a specific value in points.

 IMPORTANT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 When using the "Print Method-Printer Font", make sure that the line
spacing is set to 6 lpi or 8 lpi, paragraph spacing 0 and single line
spacing.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Line Spacing: Single (proportional to the current type size),

 Double (proportional to the current type size, but giving line space
equal to twice the type size), 1½ (proportional to the current type size,
but giving line space equal to one-and-one-half the type size).

 INDENTATION

 Left: Indent (set in) from the left margin.

 First Line: Indent the first line from the left indent.

 The indent can be set to a negative value provided the Left is equal to
or greater than the negative "First Line".

 For example, in this paragraph, the Left indent is set to 2 cm and "First
              Line" to -2 cm, the first line is set to the left margin and
              successive lines are indented by 2 cm. This is called a
              'hanging indent'.

 Right: Indent from the right margin.

 Page 183

 FORMATTING

 Justification:

 JUSTIFY DOES

 Left      Aligned to left indent, but remain ragged on right side

 Right     Aligned to right indent, but remain ragged on left side

 Centred   Centred within indents, ragged on both left and right sides

 Full      Aligned to both left and right indents by placing extra
           discretional spaces between words ensuring each line length is
           identical. Sometimes, with short line length and several long
           words, the word spacing may become too large. If this happens,
           select "Allow Hyphenation" to reduce the word Spacing

 Keep Lines Together: Forces all paragraphs that are broken by a column or
page break, onto the next page or column, keeping the whole paragraph
together (a basic form of "widows and orphans").

 Allow Hyphenation: lets you control the individual paragraph hyphenation
when the Hyphenation command (Settings menu) is selected.



 11.4.3 TABS

 Choose Tabs command (Format menu).

 As tabs are paragraph related, it is not necessary to select the whole
paragraph but just place the insertion point anywhere within the
paragraph.

 If the tabs are to be applied to consecutive paragraphs, select from
anywhere in the first paragraph to anywhere in the last paragraph. To
select the entire document, choose "Select All" command (Settings menu).

 A paragraph is recognised as a block of text from the character
immediately following a return character up to and including the next
return character (the return character is generated by pressing the Return
key). Often tabulised text can be a series of single lines each ending
with a return character and so each line is considered to be a paragraph.

                   most character will always be at the tab position,
                   preceding text coming from the left. If the space
                   between the tab character and the actual tab position
                   is filled by text, then any extra text typed in will
                   start to flow to the right of the tab.

 Centre aligning   Text starts at tab position and flows equally to the
                   left and right, leaving the text centred around the tab
                   position.

 Decimal aligning  Used for columns of figures which include decimal
                   points (for example, 2.4, 567.1, 45.843). Figures will
                   align so that the decimal points automatically align
                   one above the other. The character used as the decimal
                   point may be set from the "Text Settings" requester
                   ("Change Settings" command, Settings menu).

 When you start Wordworth, the document window appears. It is called
"untitled 1".

The blinking vertical bar on the page is referred to as the "insertion
point" and marks the position of where characters will appear when you
start typing. Before you start typing, set Wordworth to show special
symbols.

 step 1

 Choose "Show Codes" from the View pull-down menu. These are on-screen
symbols and will not appear on printouts.

 WHAT YOU SEE   WHAT THEY MEAN

 ¶              End of paragraph mark

 .              Space mark

                WYSIWYG tab mark

                Hard space

 |              Bookmark

 step2

 Choose "Print Setup" from the Project menu and from the requester check
that the "Print Method" is set to Normal. Then click OK. (Wordworth will
now ensure that you only use fonts which are suitable for this method of
printing namely Agfa Compugraphic, Adobe PostScript, and bitmap fonts.)

 step 3

 Now type the following text (the errors are intentional). If you make
other mistakes, press Backspace to erase, and then re-type.


 IMPORTANT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Do not press the Return key at the end of each line, unless indicated by
a ¶ (paragraph mark). You should only press the Return key to end a
paragraph.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Page 61


   Unlike the stars, which shyne with their own
   light, the planets of our solar system can only
   be seen because they reflect the light of the
   sun. As they are much closer than the stars, we
   can follow their movements across the sky. ¶
   The brightest object in the sky, apart from the
   sun and the moon, is Venus. It is about the size
   of the Earth, with an atmosphere of brilliant
   white clouds, which prevents its surface from
   being seen clearly.¶
   Saturn, the second largest planet (about 119,000
   km in diameter), is the most extraordinary of the
   planets because it is surrounded by a system of
   rings. For a long time the rings puzzled
   astronomers, but they are now known to consist of
   millions of separate solid particles.¶


 Figure 4-4 Creating a document

 Notice that the first line automatically wordwraps onto the next line.
Wordwrap means that you do not have to watch the screen to see where to
press the Return key.

 The mouse pointer arrow changes into a vertical bar (I-beam) when you
click on the page. The insertion point blinking vertical bar) moves there
when you click the mouse. You can also move the insertion point around the
document with the arrow keys.

 Page 62




 4.3 GETTING HELP
 Any time you want information about a command or option, you can ask
Wordworth for help.

 Choose the menu command you want help with, but before releasing the
mouse button, press the Help key (floppy disk users may be prompted to
insert the appropriate disk).

 You can also ask Wordworth for help by clicking the Help icon on the
toolbar or pressing the Help key.

 Figure 4-5 Getting Help

 The Buttons

 Contents: Click to reveal help contents list.

 Index: Click to reveal help index list.

 Help: Click to display help about Wordworth on-line help
       system (this button may be dimmed on some versions of Workbench).

 Retrace: Steps backwards through the help topics previously selected.

 Browse < : Steps to the previous section of the topic.

 Browse > : Steps to the next section of the topic.

 Page 63

 Each help topic has further cross references, which are accessed by
clicking their button in the text.

 The Help window can be re-sized and moved like any other.

 Click the close gadget to close the Help window.

 (As AmigaGuide menus vary depending on the version of Workbench they are
not documented in this book.)



 4.4 EDITING TEXT

 In the first line of the text, you typed shyne, it should read Shine.

 step 1

 Using the mouse, move the I-beam over the word and double-click shyne
(with the Left Mouse button). It becomes highlighted and this is referred
to as "selected text," (which may be a letter, a word, several words, a
paragraph or an entire document). Sometimes, the Left Mouse button is
called the Selection button.

 If you accidentally select the whole line (triple-click), click once on
another part of the text and then try again.


 step 2

 With the word shyne selected (highlighted), type shine and press the
Space bar. You can see that in the document, the word shyne has been
replaced with shine.

 When you select text, Wordworth can do one of five things:

 * Replace the selection with the key(s) you press (as you have just
   discovered).

 * Erase the selection (press Backspace or Del).

 * Format the selection with the menu command you choose.

 * Copy the selection onto the clipboard.

 The next section explains some of these commands: Selecting text,
formatting text, and using the clipboard.

 Page 64



 4.5 SELECTING TEXT

 Text can be selected in several ways.

With The Mouse

 TO SELECT            DO THlS

 Any amount of text   Drag the I-beam over text (with the Selection button
                      depressed)

 Word                 Double-click word

 Line of text         Triple-click anywhere on line

 To cancel a selection, click elsewhere on the text.

 With The Keys

 Press the Shift key while moving the insertion point (the vertical
blinking bar) with the arrow keys.

 To select the entire document (all text), choose "Select All" from the
Edit pull-down menu.



 4.6 FORMATTING TEXT

 Changing the appearance of your document.


 Figure 4-6 Untitled document

 step 1
 Position the insertion point at the beginning of the text by moving the
I-beam to the beginning of the first line Unlike the stars...

 Page 65

 Press and hold the Selection button and drag the I-beam
 downward to the last word of the first paragraph (sky) and

 release the Selection button. The text should now be

 highlighted, which means it is "selected".

 (The text will remain selected until you click on the
 document.)

 Figure 4-7 Untitled document with text selected

 step 2

 Choose the Italic command from the Format pull-down menu. The text will
now appear in italic type style. You can change the style to appear in
a mixture of Bold, ltalic, Underline, Subscript or Superscript from the
Format menu.

 Each style is a toggle command, which means you choose it once to switch
it on, and then choose it again to switch it off. Most of these commands
are also available on the ruler.

 P B ¿ U

 Style icons: Plain Bold italic Underline

 With the text selected, set to bold by clicking the B icon on the ruler
(the italic icon should already be selected).

 Page 66

 Choose Plain (from the Format menu or ruler) to switch all of the other
styles off, making the text 'plain' style.

 The advantage of a program like Wordworth is that as you select different
styles for your text, they appear on the screen, just as they will appear
when you print the document. This is WYSIWYG! (What-You-See-Is-What-You-
Get.)

 You can also change the font using the Font command.

 step 1

 With the text selected, choose Font from the Format menu. You can also
select the Font command by clicking the appropriate icon on the toolbar.

 Figure 4-8 The 'Font Format' icon

 The font requester appears.

 Figure 4-8 Typeface requester

 This allows you to set the format for selected text. You can select the
font, style and colour.

 The default sizes (in points) appear in the pop-up Size box.

 However, you can type your own size, anything from 3 to over 1000 points!

 Page 67

 Notice that most of the options are set to 'mixed'. This is because the
selected text contains a mixture of settings (for example, there are
different styles in the selected text and So these are set to mixed).

 For further information on typefaces and point sizes see Appendix B,
"Designing Documents With Style".

 step 2

 Click the small arrow on the Size gadget to reveal the pop-up size list.
Drag the mouse pointer down the list and select 18.

 Figure 4-9 Selections Size from a pop-up Gadget

 Click the small arrow on the Typeface pop-up and select "Shannon Book'
from the list. A sample of the font will appear in the white box at the
bottom of the requester. The Colour group lets you set the colours for
text and the background.

 step 3

 Click the small arrow on the gadget titled Text to reveal the pop-up
colour list, then drag the mouse pointer down the list and select Red.

 You will be able to see the text change in the sample box at the bottom
of the requester. Now click OK and the text will change to 18pt size, red.

 Page 68



 4.7 USING THE CLIPBOARD

 Wordworth has a built-in clipboard, with which you can cut and paste
text. This means cut or copy selected text onto the clipboard, and then
paste the text from the clipboard back into your document at another
position.

 step 1

 Double-click the word at the beginning of the document shine to select
it, and choose the Copy command from the Edit menu.

 step 2

 Select movements in the next sentence and click the Paste icon on the
toolbar.

 Shine has now been pasted in replace of movements.

 MENU COMMAND  DOES

 Cut           Erases selected text, stores on clipboard

 Copy          Copies selected text on to the clipboard

 Paste         Pastes contents of cupboard into the document, at the
               insertion point

 The selected text that you cut or paste onto the cupboard will remain
there until you cut or paste another piece of text, which will replace it.
This means you can Cut or Copy text, and then Paste the same text back
into the document many times.


 4.8 UNDOING A MISTAKE

 If you accidentally delete selected text, you can reverse the action by
using the Undo command.

 step 1

 Select the word solar in the first sentence, and press Backspace or Del.

 step 2

 Choose the Undo command from the Edit menu. The deletion reappears. Undo
only reverses the most recent deletion.

 Page 69



 4.9 SAVING THE DOCUMENT

 The first time you save a document, you need to give it a name using the
"Save As" conmmand.

 step 1

 Choose "Save As" from the Project menu.

 Figure 4-10 'Save As Format' requester

 step 2

 title bar now shows the document name.


 IMPORTANT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 You need to save your work on the disk by choosing the Save command at
the end of each session. It is wise to save your document about every 15
minutes as you work. This ensure that your work will not be lost if there
should be a power cut or other problem causing the computer to shut down
or restart. (You can set Wordworth to auto-save every 15 minutes or so,
see Section 11.7.3.3, "File Settings ".)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To save your document onto a different floppy disk, in the Drawer text
gadget type the disk name (followed by :), and press the Return key. When
prompted, place the new disk into a drive and type the name of your
document in the File text gadget, then click Save or press the Return key.

 Page 71



 4-10 SPELL CHECKING

 step 1

 Close the document Worlds by choosing Close (Project menu). Choose Open
command and select the document called Milky Way from the list. Click Open
to open the document then position the insertion point at the beginning of
the text.

 step 2

 Choose "Spell Check" from the Tools menu.

 Floppy disk users: You may be asked to insert another disk.

 Figure 4-12 'Spell Check' requester

 step 3

 The Collins dictionary will detect the deliberate spelling mistake
astromomicle. For spelling suggestions, click "Make suggestions" and the
closest suggestion will appear in the "Replace With" text gadget. Click
Replace to replace the incorrect spelling astonomicle.

 step 4

 The next query will be a double word, million million. In this case it is
intentional, so click No.

 Page 72

 step 5

 The next word, Centauri, is part of a name and spelt correctly,
 so click Ignore to ignore this occurrence.

 step 6

 Again, click No to the intentional double word million million.

 Wordworth will inform you when it has finished spell checking the
document. Click OK and then click Done to exit the spell checker.


4.11 PRINTING THE DOCUMENT

 Before printing, it is always a good idea to save your document. You do
this by choosing the Save command from the Project Menu (or press Right
Amiga-S).

 There are 3 different methods to print your documents:

 * Normal.

 * PrinterFont.

 * PostScript.

 Normal: You use this method for printing Agfa Compugraphic fonts, Adobe
PostScript fonts, TrueType fonts, bitmap fonts and graphics. You can also
print in draft.

 Printer Font: This method utilises your printer is internal fonts. It
offers very fast Printing but you cannot use any other fonts or graphics.
You can also print in draft.

 PostScript: You should skip this section. PostScript printing is covered
in its own chapter and is solely for users with advanced PostScript
printers (refer Appendix E-PostScript Printers).

 IMPORTANT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 As soon as you create a new document, you should set the "Print Method"
("Print Setup", Project menu) before typing and text, as the "Print
Method" determines the fonts you can use. If you try to change the "Print
Method" while editing a document you will be warned that the fonts will
have to be changed to match the new "Print Method". If this requester
appears, click Yes.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Page 73

 You need to prepare your printer and Wordworth for printing. Before you
can print your first document, you need to take a few preliminary steps.
Once you take these steps, you will not need to repeat them unless you
change the type of printer you use.

 step 1

 Check your printer for the following:

 * That it is properly connected to your Amiga.

 * That paper is loaded.

 * That it is plugged in and turned on.

 * That it is "on-line".

 step 2

 Choose "Print Setup" from the Project menu.


 Figure 4-13 'Print Setup' requester

 The list gadget shows the printer driver, make sure that the correct
printer driver for your printer is selected (for example, EpsonQ is the
standard Workbench driver for a Citizen 24pin printer). Click OK.

 step 3

 Choose print command (Project menu), or click the Print icon on the
toolbar to display the Print requester.

                        5.1 CREATING THE DOCUMENT

 As the text for such a document is usually quite large, this has already
been prepared for you. Choose Open (Project menu), select Newsletter Text
from the list and click Open.



 5.1.1 FORMATTING THE DOCUMENT

 The document first needs to be setup for the right size and style.

 Choose Document command (Format menu):


 Figure 5-1 'Document Format' requester

 Type the following:

 Margins-Left: 0.5in

 Margins-right: 0.5in

 Margins-Top: 1.5in

complete the entry by pressing the Return key (or Tab). If you type an
entry without pressing the Return key, and close the requester, the entry
will be ignored.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Columns are vertical bands of text that span the page from the left to
right, text will run from the bottom of one column into the top of the
next. This style of column is called a snaking column and is most common
in newspapers. Select A4 from the "Page Size" pop-up gadget and click OK
to exit the requester.



5.1.2 TEXT FRAMES

 The newsletter needs a title. So, choose "Drawing Tools" (View menu),
click the icon with the blue T in it (the Text Frame tool) and drag a
frame across the top of the page:

                           5.2 PLACING PICTURES

 5.2.1 PLACING PICTURES INTO A DOCUMENT

 The newsletter now needs a picture to attract the eye from all of the
text.

 With the Selection button, click on the document page to place the
insertion point back in the main editing area and choose "Place Picture"
(Object menu). Select Earth.iff from the list gadget and click Place.

 A picture of the earth will now be placed in the top left corner of the
page. Drag the picture to the bottom of the page, in between the two
columns, using the mouse. If you move the picture beyond the bottom of the
screen, the page will automatically scroll, so that you can place the
picture anywhere in one drag.

 Once placed, the text disappears beneath the picture. However, the text
should flow around the picture.

 Figure 5-4 Dragging a picture

 Select the picture with the Selection button, so that four handles appear
around it, and choose Information (Object menu)> On the "Picture
Information" requester select "Contour Left" from the "Text Flow" - "Stand
Off" gadget (stand off is the distance between the text and the picture).
Press the Esc key to exit the requester.

 Page 82


 5.2.2 DEFINING COLOURS

 What the newsletter needs now is a few text quotes which can be placed in
the columns to entice the reader to read further.

 Select the Text Frame tool again and draw a frame around 2 inches square
on the page. Choose Information (Object Menu) to display the "Text Frame
Information" requester:

 Figure 5-5 'Text Frame Information' requester

 Type 0.5 into the "From Left" text gadget, 2.5 into the "From Top"
gadget, 3.5 into Width and 1 into the Height gadgets and press the Esc key
to exit.

 With the insertion point in the text frame, type ..earth revolves around
sun...

 Now, choose "Select All" from the Edit menu to highlight all of the text
in the frame and choose Font (Format menu).

 From the "Text Colour" pop-up gadget, select Define from the bottom of
the list to display the Colours requester. Select "DarkBlue" from the
list gadget. Then move the Blue slider as far right as it will go and both
the Red and Green sliders left to 0%. Lastly, replace the text "Dark
Blue" in the Name gadget with Blue and click OK.


 IMPORTANT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Colours defined from the Colours requester will be used when printed, but
will not necessarily be displayed correctly on the screen.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Page 83

 When the "Font Format" requester re-appears, select the Italic check box,
to slant the text to the right, select "Shannon Book" and 24 from the Size
pop-up list gadget. Click OK to return to the document.

 Now, position the insertion point at the end of the line ...star gazer
and press the Return key four times.



 5.2.3 DRAWING LINES, BOXES AND OTHER GRAPHICS

 The quote now needs to have a couple of lines drawn around it to separate
it from the rest of the text. Select the Line tool from the Drawing Tools
and draw two horizontal lines either side of the text frame containing the
quote whilst holding down the Ctrl key. The Ctrl key is used to make sure
the lines remain straight, it constrains the line along its horizontal
axis.

 Next, select the Box Tool from the "Drawing Tools" and drag a box around
the whole page. Choose Information (Object menu) and select Transparent
from the "Fill Colour" pop-up. Type 4 into the Thickness gadget and
select "Double Line" from the "Border Style" pop-up

  Figure 5-6 'Box Information' requester

Lastly, the headline is the most important part of a newsletter and
therefore should catch the eye. Select the first line 'Earth Spins Around
Sun Scare', type 17 into the Size pop-up text gadget on the ruler tools
and click the Bold (B) icon to make the text stand out more.

                             CREATING A BOOK

 This tutorial will give a brief introduction to all features commonly
associated with writing books or large documents.

 Page 85

 This page empty

 Page 86

 As a large amount of text will be needed during this tutorial, there is a
document supplied that can be used for this purpose. Choose Open (Project
menu), select Book Text from the list gadget and click Open.


 6.1 AUTOMATIC FILE SAVING

 Before any editing begins, it's a good idea to set up the Auto Save
feature of Wordworth so that you won't lose any information if you have a
power cut or some other unknown problem occurs.

 Auto Save has three settings:

 Off: No auto save.

 On: Saves the file automatically after a specified delay.

 Reminder: Flashes the screen and displays, in the Status Bar, a message
warning you that it is time to save your document.

 Figure 6-1 'File Settings' requester

 For the purpose of this tutorial, the automatic save is the most
appropriate. From the, File Settings" requester ("Change Settings"
command, Settings menu), select On from the "Auto Save" pop-up gadget and
type 5 in the Delay gadget.

 Page 87


 6.2 ADJUSTING PAGE LAYOUT

 The document now needs to be set up correctly to the size and dimensions
that are required.

 Choose Document (Format menu) and select A4 from the "Page Size" pop-up,
then type:

 Margins-Left: 0.5

 Margins-Right: 0.5

 Margins-Top: 1

 Margins-Bottom: 1

 Click the Options button to reveal another requester from which you can
set time and date styles or header and footer options.

 Figure 6-2 'Document Options' requester

 Select the "Use Headers And Footers" and "Show On First Page" check
boxes, then type 0.5 in both "Header Margin" and "Footer Margin" text
gadgets.



 6.3 FINDING AND REPLACING TEXT

 With large documents, the need to replace words with a different one
becomes quite common. In this document you will notice that the name
Galileo Galilei appears in several places.

 Place your insertion point at the beginning of the document and choose
Find (Edit menu), type Galilei in the "Find What" text gadget and press
the Return key.

 Page 88

 Figure 6-3 Find requester

 Wordworth will stop at the first occurrence of Galilei and will wait for
you to choose either "Find Next", (to move on); or Replace (to replace it
with the contents of the "Replace With" gadget). Click "Find Next" to move
on.

 At the next occurrence, click Replace. Galilei will now be deleted as the
"Replace With" gadget is empty. Click "Replace All" to delete all further
occurrences of the word Galilei.



 6.4 PAGINATION

 Halfway down the first page there is a heading for Chapter Two. As it is
a new chapter, it should start at the top of a fresh page. Move to the
beginning of the line starting, "Chapter Two" and select "Page Break" from
the Insert command (Edit menu). This command will force that line to
always start at the top of a fresh page.

 Page 89

 Figure 6-4 Insert - 'Page Break' command

 Page breaks save the need for pressing the Return key many times to reach
the bottom of the page.

 At the bottom of the second page, the last paragraph is split between the
second and third pages. There are two methods to stop this happening:

 * Forcing a page break before the split paragraph

 * Informing the paragraph to keep its lines together over breaks

 Move the insertion point to the split paragraph and choose

 Paragraph (Format menu), select the checkbox "Keep Lines Together" and
click OK.

 Before the document is printed, the paragraph will be forced onto the
next page (alternatively, choose Document command, Format menu, and then
click OK).

 Page 90



 6.5 HEADERS AND FOOTERS

 Books very often have page numbers on the bottom of the page and the book
title at the top. Choose Document (Format menu) and select the "Facing
Pages" check box. This will let you set different headers and footers on
odd and even pages, just like a book. Click OK to return to the document.

 Use the vertical scroll bar to move to the top of the first page and
click in the region between the top of the text and the top of the page.
This is the header. With the Selection button click in this area, to place
the insertion point, and choose Paragraph (Format menu). Select Right from
the Justification pop-up gadget and click OK.

 Figure 6-5 Headers

 Type A Guide To Astronomy and, with the Scroll bar, move to the bottom of
the page. Click in the area between the bottom of the text and the end of
the page. Click the Right

 Justification icon in the "Ruler Tools" and type Page (followed by a
space). Now choose "Page Number" from the insert command (Edit menu).

 Move to the second page (the first left page in a facing pages document)
and repeat the same steps, but this time, with Left Justification.

 Page 91



 6.6 THESAURUS

 Select the word spins from the second paragraph and choose Thesaurus
(Tools menu).

 Figure 6-6 Thesaurus requester

 The list gadget on the right contains all the alternative synonyms for
the word spins. Select "2) verb" from the Meanings list and a new list of
synonyms appear. Select rotates from the Synonyms list to place it in the
Word text gadget and click Replace. The selected word in the document, has
now been replaced by the word chosen from the Thesaurus.


 6.7 BOOKMARKS

 Bookmarks are very useful for large documents, as you can place them at
specific sections in the document (in our case, each Chapter) to aid in
jumping to the right page when editing.

 Place the insertion point at the be g of the line "Chapter One ..." and
select Bookmark from the Insert command (Edit menu). On the requester,
type the name given to the bookmark, Chapter One and click Insert. Follow
the same procedure for each chapter in the document.

 Page 92

 Figure 6-7 Bookmark requester

 Choose "Go To" command (Edit menu) and you will see your bookmark names
in the list. Double-click a name to go to the relevant page.



 6.8 TABLE OF CONTENTS

 The book now needs a table of contents at the beginning to help the
reader find the right section.

 Figure 6-8 Insert - 'List-Entry' requester

 Page 93

 Select the first line "Chapter One.." and select "List Entry" (Insert
command, Edit menu). The selected text will appear in the Text gadget.
Click Insert to place it as an entry in the selected list, "Table of
Contents".

 For each of the Chapter headings, select "List Entry" (Insert command,
Edit menu) to place them in the contents list.

 When all the chapters have been added, place the insertion point at the
top of the document before the first chapter, and choose "Create List"
(Tools Menu). Click "Table of Contents" from the list and type Contents
into the Title text gadget.

 Figure 6-9 Created list

 Click Create to place the list at the beginning of the document.



 6.9 INDEXING

 Indexes have always been the book writers bane. With Wordworth's
automatic index generation, it couldn't be simpler.

 Move the insertion point to Earth in the first paragraph and choose
Insert-"Index Entry" (Edit menu).

 Type Planets in the "Main Entry" text gadget, press the Return key, and
then type Earth in the "First Subentry" gadget. Select the  "Include All
Other Occurrences" check box and click Insert. This will insert every
occurrence of Earth into the index under the main entry of Planets.

 Page 94

 Figure 6-10 Insert - 'Index Entry' command

 Move the insertion point to Sun in the second chapter and choose Insert-
"Index Entry" (Edit menu). Select Planets from the list gadget and type
Sun into the "First Subentry" text gadget. Select the "Include All Other
Occurrences" check box and click Insert.

 If the index was created, the above entries would appear like this:

 Planets   (main entry)

   Earth   (subentry of planets)

   Sun     (subentry of planets)

 A subentry of Earth, Moon, in the main entry of Planets would be inserted
like this:

 Planets   (main entry)

   Sun     (subentry of Planets)

   Pluto   (subentry of Planets)

   Earth   (subentry of Planets)

     Moon  (second subentry of Earth)

 Now go through the document, inserting index entries for all of the
relevant items you w ant in the index.

 Page 95

 Choose "Create Index" (Tools menu), select the check boxes "Include
Letter Headings" and "Use Page Ranges", then click Create.

                              CHAPTER SEVEN
                              MAIL MERGING

 This tutorial demonstrates how to create a small database of names and
addresses in Wordworth and then mail merge it with a form letter to
produce a mailshot.

 Page 97

 This Page empty

 Page 98



 7.1 CREATING AN ADDRESS DATABASE

 First, a quick explanation of the terms used in mail merging. Using the
example of a small club:

 * All of the members of the club are in a database,

 * Each members details are stored as records in the database,

 * Each individual item of information (that is surname or initials) for
   a member are fields within the record.

 Now you know the terminology used, let's create the database.

 step 1

 Create a new document by choosing the New command (Project menu). A
small requester appears, containing the available templates. Select
Normal from the list gadget and click OK.

 step 2

 Type the names of the fields forming each record in the database, like
this:

 Surname(tab)   Title(tab)  Address1(tab)  Address2(tab)  Country¶

 Then, the records themselves:

 Galilei(tab)    Mr(tab)  Venus Street(tab)  VENICE(tab)    ITALY¶

 Copernicus(tab) Mr(tab)  Sun Centre(tab)    GDANSK(tab)    POLAND¶

 Each field is separated by a tab character. Each record is separated by
a carriage return. So, press Tab between each field and the Return key at
the end of each line.

 Page 99

 Figure 7-1 Database

 The first line (or record) contains the field names, this is called the
'Header Record'.

 step 3

 Choose "Save As" (Project menu), select "ASCII File" from the list
gadget and click OK. From the Save file requester type MergeDataFile into
the File text gadget, press the Return key and click Save. Floppy disk
users may be asked to insert a disk into one of the drives.

 step 4
 Close the document using the Close command (Project menu). A new
untitled window will appear.

 Page 100



 7.2 MERGING FORM LETTERS

 step 1

 With a new untitled window on the screen type:

 To: <<Title>> <<Surname>>¶

 Of:¶

 <<Address1>>¶
 <<Address2>>¶
 <<Country>>¶

 ¶

 Dear <<Title>> <<Surname>>,¶

 Unfortunately, your membership has expired. Please contact out
terrestrial office if you wish to remain a member of the "Flat Earth
Club".¶

 Kind regards,

 ¶

 Aris Totle¶
 Club Secretary¶

 (To type the « character, hold down the Alt key and press 9, to type »
press Alt-0.)

 step 2

 Choose "Save As" (Project menu), select "Wordworth Document" from the
list gadget and click OK. Next, type

 MergeLetter into the File text gadget, press the Return key and click
Save.

 step 3

 Choose "Mail Merge" (Project menu). From the requester click Select to
display the mail merge file requester data file from the list, select
MergeDataFile then click OK.

 Page 101

 Figure 7-2 'Mail Merge' file requester

 Select "File Includes Header Record" check box, select Standard from the
Format pop-up gadget and then click Print. From the print requester,
click Print again.

 step 4

 Two copies of the letter will now be printed, one to Mr Galileo and the
second to Mr Copernicus.

 step 102



 7.3 IMPORTING A THIRD PARTY ADDRESS DATABASE

 With Wordworth, you can merge form letters with databases created with
Digita Mailshot Plus, Superbase, KData or indeed any program that can
export data as an ASCII or DIF (Data interchange Format) file.

 step 1

 Export the database file from your third party database as an ASCII or
DIF file using the appropriate Export command.

 When exporting the file you will need to know two things. Firstly, the
characters used to separate the fields and records, and secondly,
whether the file contains the field names in the first (or Header)
record.

 When exporting the file from Superbase using the DIF format, Wordworth
will automatically recognise the field names as they are saved as Labels
within the file.

 step 2

 If the database file contains field name information in the first record
(or as LABELS) then you will need to use these names when typing the
fields into your document between the « and » characters. If the file
does not contain field name information, you will need to type «FIELD1 »,
«FIELD2», «FIELD3» and so on, to take the place of the field names.

 step 3

 From the "Mail Merge" requester, select the format of the database file
using the Format pop-up gadget, and select the "File Includes Header
Record" check box if necessary.

 Page 103

 Figure 7-3 'Mail Merge' file requester with Format pop-up

 If you exported the file from a database that is not known by Wordworth,
you can select the characters used to separate the fields and records by
using the pop-up text gadgets for ASCII

 Field and Record Separators or by typing the ASCII value into the
gadget.

 To merge the file with the form letter, click Print and then click Print
again.

 With the pointer still over the box, hold down the Selection button and
drag the outline of the shape to its new position. You can drag the shape
onto a different page by just moving the pointer off the edge of the page.
As you do this, the page scrolls automatically until you move the pointer
back onto the page. The closer the pointer is to the bottom of the page,
the slower the document will scroll and vice versa.

 Figure 8-9 Moving a shape

 Page 117

 If you are in the middle of creating, sizing or moving a shape and you
wish to cancel the operation, press the Menu mouse button while you still
have the Selection button depressed.

 Depress the Ctrl key (whilst moving an object) to constrain an object
along the horizontal or vertical axis.

 Moving With The Information Requester

 Choose "Create Object' (Object menu) and select Line. Click on the page
and drag out a line of about 2 inches. Select the Line by clicking it) and
choose the Information command (Object menu).

 The "Line Information" requester has two groups of text gadgets titled
Start and End. The start is the place where you first clicked on the page
before dragging the pointer and the end is where you released the
Selection button to create the line. Type the following:

 Start-"From Left": 2

 Start-"From Top": 1.5

 End-"From Left": 4

 End-"From Top": 3

 When you type a new figure into a gadget (and press the Return key), the
information updates the screen instantly. As you typed new position
figures, you may have seen the line move. Experiment further, and remember
the "Line Information" requester is modeless, which means you can leave it
on the screen as long as you like. You can move it out the way by dragging
the "Window Title Bar", or minimise it by clicking the "Window Zoom"
gadget.



 8.4.4 CHANGING THE WAY SHAPES LOOK

 There are several ways you can control the look of shapes, including
position, size, fill colour, colour, border style and thickness.

 Create a line on the page and choose the Information command (Object
menu). Click on the Style pop-up gadget in the Start group and you will
see a list of endings for the line. Select Splat.

 Select "8 pt" from the Thickness pop-up text gadget, and select Red from
the Colour pop-up.

 Page 118

 Figure 8-10 'Line Information' requester

 The last attribute of a line is its "Line Style", set this to "Long Dash
Dot".



 8.4.5 DELETING A SHAPE

 To delete the shape, select it with the Selection button and either press
the Del key, or choose Erase (Edit menu).



 8.4.6 GROUPING SHAPES TOGETHER

 Sometimes it is convenient to link several shapes together so that they
move as one. For example, if you created the shape of a face using two
circles, one box and a line, you would probably want to move or re-size
the individual shapes as one. This is achieved with the Group command.

 Create a simple face on the page using two circles, a box and a line.
Select all of the shapes by dragging the Arrow pointer around them,
ensuring the dotted line touches (and therefore selects) each individual
shape. Release the Selection button and each shape will appear selected.

 Page 119

 Figure 8-11 Grouping objects

 Now choose Group from the Object menu. Four group handles will replace
the handles on each individual shape. This means the group can be re-sized
or moved like one item. Choose Information (Object menu) and notice that
the information settings are now global, for the entire group.

 You can ungroup the group by selecting it and choose Ungroup (Object
menu).



 8.4.7 SHAPE DEPTH ARRANGEMENT

 As you create shapes on the page, you can see that some overlap and block
your view of other shapes. The blocked shape has not been erased, it is
just obscured by the other.

 Wordworth 3 arranges shapes in the order of creation, with the most
recently created shape on top. Follow these steps to discover how to
change the depth arrangement of your shapes:

 step 1

 Choose "Create Object" (Object menu) and draw a box on the page. Then,
create a circle overlapping the box and a line overlapping both the circle
and box.

 Page 120

 step 2

 Select the line and choose "Move Backward" (Object menu). You will see
that the line has moved behind the circle but remains in front of the box.

 Figure 8-12 Arranging the depths of shapes

 Choose "Move Backward" (Object menu) again and the line
 moves behind the box.

 step 3

 With the line still selected, choose 'Bring To Front"' (Object menu) and
it is brought right to the front of all the objects that were obscuring
it.



 8.4.8 LOCKING SHAPES

 A shape can also be locked to the page to prevent anyone moving or re-
sizing it.

 step 1

 Select the box that you drew previously and choose Lock (Object menu).
When a shape is locked, its black handles change to hollow squares.

 step 2

 If you now try to move the pointer over the top of this box, the pointer
will turn into a padlock denoting that the shape is locked. If you try to
move the object, the screen will flash.

 Page 121

 Figure 8-13 Locked object

 step 3

 Select the locked box and choose Unlock (Object Menu) to unlock the shape
and allow you to change its size or position.



 8.4.9 SPECIAL FEATURES

 There are other things you can do with shapes:

 DUPLICATE

 It's easy to create identical objects. Select the line that is on the
page and choose Duplicate (Object menu). A copy of the line appears
slightly offset from the original.

 ADD TO ALL PAGES

 Any shape, or group of shapes, can be easily added to the other pages in
your document. Select the circle shape on your page and choose "Add To All
Pages" (Object menu). Any further pages you create will have the circle
positioned in the same place as the original.

 However, if you are using "Facing Pages", an object will only be added to
all of the left or all or the right pages in a document.

 Page 122

 Figure 8-14 Object added to all pages

 Select the circle shape that is on all your other pages and drag it
around the page. You will notice that the same object on all other pages
was also moved. Press the Del key to delete the object. A small requester
will appear asking if you wish to delete just the selected shape or all of
the shapes. Click the "All Pages" button.

 Page 123



                            8.5 DRAWING TOOLS

 Frames are very similar to shapes. As Both a shape and a frame is an
object, any of the commands on the Object menu can apply to either.

 In addition, moving or sizing a frame using the mouse is the same as for
a shape.



 8.5.1 TEXT FRAME

 A text frame is like a container, which can be moved about (or dragged),
anywhere on the page. This container can hold any amount of text and is
independent from the text on your page.

 Any of the available tools when editing a normal document (text styles,
character format, paragraph format and columns for example), can be used
in a text frame. Think of a text frame as an free-floating independent
miniature page within your document.

 step 1

 Choose "Create Object" command (Object menu) and from the list gadget,
select "Text Frame".

 You can move the "Create Object" requester out of the way by moving the
Arrow pointer to the requester window title bar and, while holding down
the Selection button, move the requester to its new position.

 Page 124

 Figure 8-15 Insertion point in active frame

 Type the following (do not press the Return key until you get
 to the ¶ character):

 The earth is one of nine planets that revolve around the bright star we
call the sun. But the sun, on which we depend for nearly all our energy,
is itself a very insignificant star in the immensity of space.¶

 There are literally millions and millions of stars like our sun scattered
throughout space. We do not even know how many of them have planets
revolving around them because they are too far away.¶

 step 3

 If you click the background page (indeed, anywhere away from the frame)
and then click in the text frame while holding down the Selection button,
you will be able to drag the frame around the document.

 Four small squares appear on each corner of the frame when it is
selected. These squares are called handles, and when the pointer is moved
over the top of one, it changes into a double arrow. This double arrow
denotes a re-sizing operation, which means that if the Selection button is
selected and the mouse is dragged, the size of the frame will change.

 Page 125

 Figure 8-16 Re-sizing a frame

 step 5

 An alternative, and more accurate method of changing the size and
position of a text frame is to change its Position attributes.

 Choose Information command (Object menu). Like the
 "Create Object" requester, the "Text Frame Information" requester can be
moved around and left on the screen whilst you carry on editing the
document.

 Delete the contents of the Width text gadget and type 4.
 Replace the contents of the Height text gadget with 3, change "From Left"
to 2 and "From Top" to 1.

 As you alter each one of these values, the text frame will change its
size and position automatically.

 step 6

 To change the number of columns in the text frame, move the cursor to the
"Number Of" text gadget (Columns group), and type 2. Replace the contents
of Gap with 0.25 and press the Return key, the text frame will
automatically reformat into two columns.

 Page 126

 step 7

 Change the "Border Style" pop-up (Style group) from "Single Line" to
"Double Line". Next, select "4 pt" from the Thickness pop-up text gadget
and change the "border Colour" to "Mid Green".

 Figure 8-17 'Frame Information' pop-up

 As you will have just seen, each time any attribute is changed on an
Information requester the new values are immediately applied to the object
providing instant feedback



  8.5.2 TEXTEFFECTS

 You can use TextEffects to produce simple logos.

 step 1

 Choose "Drawing Tools" command (View menu) and from the floating toolbar
select the TextEffects icon (the Fx icon).

 Draw a square outline on the page and choose Information (Object menu) to
display the "TextEffects Information" requester.

 step 2

 Select Circle from the Type pop-up gadget (Effects group). Then type
Digita international Limited into the Contents text gadget and click
Apply.

 Page 127

 Figure 8-18 TextEffect requester

 You will see that the words Digita International Limited are drawn in a
circle within your frame.

 step 3

 The Word Digita starts at the top of the circle. Rotating the circle is
simple, delete the contents of the "Rotate By" text gadget, type 235 and
press the Return key. Click Apply and you will see the effect rotate.

 step 4

 Now lets make the logo more impressive. Click the Font button and select
Red from the "First Character" (Colour group) pop-up gadget, select Yellow
from the "Last Character" pop-up and then click OK.

 step 5

 Now add some shadow effects. Click the "Shadows" button and type 5 into
the "Number Of Shadows' text gadget. Type 25 into the Size text gadget
("Last Shadow Offset" group), this will make the fifth (and last) shadow
25% smaller than the original.

 Next, select "80% Grey" from the "First Shadow Colour" pop-up gadget and
"20% Grey' from the "Last Shadow Colour" pop-up.

 Page 128

 In the "Last Shadow" group type 2.5 into the "Distance Across" gadget.
Click OK and you should see the changes take place after a few moments
intensive Amiga calculation.

 Figure 8-19 Finished TextEffects

 Click OK from the main TextEffects requester to return to the page.



 8.5.3 TABLES AND CALCULATIONS

 With tables, you can arrange columns of numbers and text in a document
without the need for using tabs. Tables also provide a convenient way to
present the text in side-by-side paragraphs, as in a script for a play.

 A table is a grid of Rows and Columns marked by Gridlines. Each small box
in the table is called a Cell and the gridlines will not be printed unless
specifically requested.

 step 1

 To create a table on your page, choose "Create Object" command (Object
menu) and select Table from the list. With the Selection button, drag a
box 1 inch wide x 2 inches high.

 A grid, one across by about four down should have been created. If you
did not get enough cells created then drag out the table using the table
handles to automatically create new rows or columns.

 Page 129

 step 2

 Move the Arrow pointer over the bottom right handle and drag the table
outline out to create more cells. A table of six rows by two columns is
needed.

 Figure 8-20 Re-sizing a table to create more rows and columns

 step 3

 Move the pointer to the gridline separating the first and second columns
and the Arrow pointer will change to a two-way pointer. Select the
gridline with the Arrow pointer and it becomes dotted. Move it to the
right about one half of an inch.

 When the Selection button is released, the gridline moves, therefore
increasing the width of the first column and moving the second column
over.

 Page 130

 Figure 8-21 Increasing the width of a column

 If the second column disappears, just drag out the width of the table
using the tables handles to bring it back into view (rows and columns are
never deleted, they are just moved out of view so re-sizing the table will
bring the previously hidden cells back).

 step 4

 Place the insertion point in the first cell by moving the Arrow pointer
over it and clicking with the Selection button.

 Type Country and press the Tab key to move into the cell on the right.
Type Time and then press Tab again to move your insertion point to the
beginning of the next row.

 Using this process of 'type then tab' to move between cells, type the
following information:

 London(tab)       GMT(tab)

 Los Angeles(tab)  0400(tab)

 Madrid(tab)       1300(tab)

 Mexico City(tab)  0600(tab)

 Montreal(tab)     0700(tab)

 If you press Tab once too many and move into the wrong cell, press Shift-
Tab to go back to the previous cell.

 Page 131

 step 5

 Now there is a table with data in it, the cells need to be formatted.
Move the insertion point to the first cell (containing Country), by
clicking the Selection button in it and choose "Select All" command (Edit
menu).

 Choose Font (Format menu), select "Bright Blue" from the Text pop-up
gadget (Colour group) and select the Bold check box. Click OK and the
selected text in the cell will change to the new style.

 Choose Paragraph (Format menu) and select Centre from the

 Justification pop-up gadget. Repeat the same process with the cell to the
right containing the word Time.

 step 6

 Move the insertion point to the cell which contains "Mexico City" and
choose Tables (Format menu). From this requester you can insert or delete
rows or columns.

 Figure 8-22 Tables requester

 Select the "Insert After" radio button, ensure that the Row radio button
is selected and click OK. The row containing Montreal will be moved off
the table as a new row below "Mexico City" has been added.

 Page 132

 step 7

 Now move the insertion point to the blank row and choose Tables (Format
menu). Select Delete and Row from the radio buttons, type 2 into the "How
Many" text gadget and then click Ok. The blank row and the row containing
Montreal have been deleted, and a new blank row has appeared after "Mexico
City".

 When inserting and deleting columns, Before means 'to the left of the
current column' and After means 'to the right of the current column'.

 step 8

 With the insertion point in the last empty cell, choose Calculate (Tools
menu). Select Average and "Cells Above" radio buttons to produce an
average of all the cells above the insertion point (that is, all of the
Times).

 Figure 8-23 Calculating cells

 Click OK and the result is placed in the cell which contains the
insertion point.

                             CUSTOMISING AND
                           OPTIMISING WORDWORTH

 Page 135

 This page empty

 Page 136



                   9.1 GETTING PERSONAL WITH WORDWORTH

 With Wordworth 3 you can customise your working environment to best suit
the way you work:

 * Choose the fonts used in the requesters and screen.

 * Choose the commands in the toolbar, their size and the position.

 * Choose the screen mode and screen colours.

 * Show or hide guides on the page.

 * Optimise Wordworth to use less memory and work faster.

 This tutorial shows you how to customise Wordworth for the way you wish
to work.



 9.1.1 REQUESTER FONTS

 There are two fonts used in the requesters. These are the gadget labels
(which are the names given to each gadget); and the gadget group headings
(which are the label headings for a group of gadgets).

 step 1

 Choose "Change Settings" command (Settings menu) and select Screen from
the list gadget. On the bottom of the "Screen Settings" requester there is
a group titled Fonts. From this requester you can specify the fonts that
Wordworth uses.

 Click the "Select" button to the right of the "Requester Headings" read-
only gadget, and from the font requester that appears, choose one of the
fonts from the list.

 Click OK and you will be returned to the "Screen Settings" requester
where the name of the font you have chosen now appears in the read-only
gadget.

 Follow the same procedure for the "Requester Gadgets" option.

 Page 137

 Figure 9-1 Selecting required fonts

 step 2

 Select the "Screen Blanker" check box gadget and type 5 into the Delay
text gadget. This will tell Wordworth that after a delay of 5 minutes, the
screen is to be blanked. Blanking a screen is used to prevent 'burn-in' of
a stationary image on your monitor if unattended for a period of time.
Click OK and your changes will take affect.



 9.1.2 SCREEN COLOURS

 The eight colours that Wordworth uses for its screen display can also be
changed. These colours are used for the icons, window and page display.

 step 1

 From the "Change Settings" requester ("Change Settings" command, Settings
menu) select "Screen Colours" from the list gadget.

 Click one of the eight colour boxes to select it (the colour selected
appears on the far left of the others), and slide the Red, Green and Blue
sliders to give the colour of your choice.

 step 2

 Do this for any of the eight colours that you wish to change and click OK
to make the changes take effect.

 Page 138



 9.1.3 TOOLBAR

 You can also customise the Wordworth toolbar in several ways:

 * The commands (icons) displayed in the toolbar.

 * The size of the icons.

 * The position of the toolbar on the screen.

 step 1

 From the "Change Settings" requester ("Change Settings" command, Settings
menu) select Toolbar from the list gadget.

 Figure 9-2 Toolbar requester

 The Commands list gadget on the left of the requester contains a list of
all the commands that can be placed on the toolbar. The Toolbar list on
the right shows the commands currently chosen for display in the toolbar.

 Move down the Commands list using the scroll arrows and select the
Librarian command. Click the » button, and the selected command will
appear at the bottom of the Toolbar list.

 Next, click the "Move Up" button to move the command up the list to the
place where you wish it to appear on your toolbar.

 Page 139

 step 2

 Select the Cut command from the Toolbar list and click the « button to
remove it from the toolbar. Click the Apply button and your toolbar will
be updated with the changes.

 step 3

 From the Position pop-up list gadget, select Floating. This means that
your toolbar will appear in an independent "floating" window which can be
moved around the screen like any other window.

 Figure 9-3 Moving the floating toolbar

 Now, select the "Large Icons" checkbox gadget and click Apply. When you
are satisfied with your changes, click OK



 9.1.4 GUIDES AND RULERS

 You can specify whether the page guides are displayed or not using "Show
Guides" (View menu). The Ruler tools are toggled on/off using the Rulers
command (View menu).

 step 1

 Choose "Change Settings"' (Settings menu) and select View
 from the list gadget to display the "View Settings" requester.
 Select the "Print Borders" check box gadget to display the
 print border margin around the edge of each page.

 Page 140

 step 2

 From the Rulers group, deselect the "Vertical Ruler" check box gadget and
deselect the "Status Bar" check box. Click OK and the window display will
change to show print borders, turn off the status bar and vertical ruler

 Figure 9-4 Selecting guides

 step 3

 Choose Rulers (View menu) and all the items that were selected in the
Rulers group of the "View Settings' requester will be turned off. Choosing
the Rulers command again will turn the ruler display back on.

 Page 141



                    9.2 GETTING WORDWORTH TO GO FASTER

 Wordworth can be optimised in many ways to both speed up display and save
precious memory.

 Use the Workbench-"Close Workbench' command (Settings menu) to save about
40K of memory. This will shut down the Workbench desktop that usually
remains open behind the Wordworth screen.

 Choose "Change Settings" (Settings menu) and from the list gadget, select
Screen. Click the "Screen Mode, button and from the "Screen Mode'
requester decrease the Colours slider from 8 to 4 by clicking to the left
of the small black box once. Click OK and the display will appear in 4
colours which saves memory and improves speeds.

 Turn off "Ruler Tools, and "Vertical Ruler" from the "View Settings"
requester ("Change Settings" command, Settings menu) will improve the
editing speed of documents.

 Select the "Use Less Memory" check box in the "Screen Settings" requester
("Change Settings" command, Settings menu). This will save a lot of
memory by making the windows used in Wordworth" simple refresh, instead of
'smart refresh'.

 A "simple refresh" window is updated (redrawn) by Wordworth instead of
the operating system and therefore will be more memory efficient. However,
doing this will make the redrawing of the windows slower.

 Page 142



                               CHAPTER TEN
                            WORDWORTH UPGRADES

 This chapter is for users of earlier versions of Wordworth. It will tell
you what's changed without going over features you'll already know.

 Page 143

 This page empty

 Page 144



                  10.1 WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT WORDWORTH 3

 Many of the changes in Wordworth 3 have resulted from Usability analysis
(discovery of faults in interface and so on), requests by users ( through
our regular questionnaires), and through the introduction of "Interface
Guidelines" by Commodore.



 10.1.1 REQUESTERS

 The most instantly noticeable change in Wordworth 3 are the requesters.
Wordworth now uses Workbench standard windows and gadgets for all of its
requesters.

 This means that, like other Workbench windows, you can minimize them
using the "Window Zoom" gadget, you can move them around the screen using
the "Window Drag (Title) Bar" and you can send them to the back or bring
them in front of any other window with the "Window Depth Gadget".

 You can even customise the fonts used in the windows. From the "Screen
Setting" requester ("Change Settings" command, Settings menu), you can set
the fonts for gadget labels, group headings, and window title bars (the
same as those used in the menus).

 Some requesters, like Find, - Insert and Object Information, can remain
on the screen whilst you carry on editing the document. Requesters like
these are termed 'Modeless' and are a relatively new idea in Amiga
software.

 Figure 10-1 Modeless requester

 Page 145



 10.1.2 CUSTOMISATION

 Wordworth 3 is highly customisable. Unlike previous versions, you can
decide what commands you want on the toolbar, what size you Would like the
icons and where on the screen you would like it positioned. Refer Toolbar-
"Change Settings" command (Settings menu).



 10.1.3 KEYBOARD

 The keyboard modifier keys have changed to incorporate the guidelines
laid down by Commodore. The keys and their functions are now.

 KEY                DOES

 Shift-Arrow key    Selects text

 Ctrl-Arrow key     Moves to beginning/end of line/document

 Alt-Arrow key      Moves to beginning/end of word/page

 The new modifier keys are now the default. However, if you prefer to use
the keys you used in the previous version of Wordworth, choose Text-
"Change Settings" command (Settings menu) and select the radio button "Old
Wordworth Modifier Keys".


 IMPORTANT
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 It is a good idea to start adopting the new keyboard commands as these
will be the only standard supported in future versions of Wordworth and
other Digita software.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------



 10-1-4 MENUS

 The menu structure and keyboard shortcuts have been changed to follow the
Commodore guidelines as much as possible. This is to make it easier for
you to use Wordworth, as it provides a familiar interface to that of other
programs following the guidelines.



 10.1.5 OUTLINE FONTS

 The Agfa font technology in Wordworth 3 is slightly different than
before, to incorporate the new font support and also make it easier for
floppy disk users to use fonts across separate disks.

 If you want to use the fonts that you already have, tell the
InstallOutlines program to look in a different place for the fonts (Floppy
Disk Users: WwTools drawer, Ww3 Extras disk. Hard Disk Users:WwTools
drawer, Wordworth3).

 Page 146

 For example, if you have Wordworth V2AGA in an Apps drawer on your hard
disk Work, you will need to tell the installer the path to the Intellifont
drawer. Click the InstallOutlines program with the Selection button and
choose information (Workbench-Icons menu).

 Click the tooltype starting FONTPATH=... and delete the brackets. Replace
the text following the equals sign with the path to your Intellifont
drawer.

 In this example, the path would be FONTPATH = Work:Apps/
 Wordworth2/Intellifont (with no spaces).

 Press the Return key and click Save.

 When you double-click the lnstallOutlines program, the fonts in your
Wordworth v2 Intellifont drawer will be installed for use with Wordworth
3.

 The InstallOutlines program will create small files called .font and
.otag for each of the fonts installed and place them in the WwFonts/UFST
drawer. These small files contain the location of the font so that
Wordworth knows where to look for them.

 This means that you can have fonts scattered around your hard disk or on
several floppy disks by just re-running InstallOutlines with the tooltype
appropriately changed. You can also use the same procedure to tell
Wordworth where to look for the PostScript and TrueType fonts.

 Figure 11-6 Print requester

 Range

 All: Prints all pages in document.

 Pages: If selected, you can then type a page range into the adjacent text
gadget. Type a single page number, or for a range of pages, type two
numbers separated by a hyphen (for example, 2-6, prints pages 2, 3, 4, 5,
6).

 Copies: Type the number of copies for each page.

 Options

 Print: Select "Odd And Even Pages", "Odd Pages Only",  "Even Pages Only".
This is useful if using single (cut) sheet which are to be printed on both
sides. Print all the odd pages first, then turn the paper over, to print
all the even pages in reverse order on the other side.

 Page 158

 Shade: Select the print shading method, depending on your

 printer

 SHADE              DOES

 Black And White    Prints fonts and graphics as either solid black or
                    white

 Colour             Prints colours if you have a colour printer

 Grey Scale 1       One style of grey scaling to represent the colours
                    used on the screen

 Grey Scale 2       One style of grey scaling to represent the colours
                    used on the screen (used for CBM A2O24 monitors only)

 Draft Printout: Prints the document in the quickest possible method which
is ideal for printing proofs.

 Collate Copies: Determines the method of printing multiple copies of a
document. For example, if you wanted to print 10 copies of a five-page
document, selecting Collate will print from page one to page five l0
times, whereas if Collate is not selected it will print l0 copies of page
one, then l0 copies of page two, and so on.

 Reverse Order: Prints pages from the highest page number to the lowest.
This is for printers which stack cut sheets automatically while printing
(for example, laser printers), so that on completion the lowest page
number will be on the top of the stack.

 AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PRINT REQUESTER ARE THREE BUTTONS

 Print: Prints using the settings in the "Print Setup" requester.

 Setup: Selects the "Print Setup" requester (see "Print Setup" command,
Project menu).

 Cancel: Cancels this requester.

 Page 159



 11.1.8 PRINT SETUP

 Choose "Print Setup" command (Project menu) or Right Amiga-Shift-P.

 Shows a requester from which you can setup your printer:

 Figure 11-7 'Print Setup' requester

 Use the list box "Printer Driver" to select the printer driver required.
(The Generic driver will only print text. Formatting of text and graphics
are discarded. )

 Density: Sets the printer resolution for printing. Set the density from 1
(lowest density), which is ideal for a quick draft print, to 7 (highest
density).

 At higher densities, more dots are used to create the image which gives a
better quality reproduction, but takes much longer to print. When printing
a colour graphic you may need to set the density quite low as the colours
can become muddy on higher densities (refer Appendix C-Pictures And Clip
Art").

 PRINT BORDERS

 Some printers have a border around the page edge which is unprintable
(this is common with most printers, there is always an unprintable area
around the page because it is used by the printer rollers to pull the
paper through). However, if you are using "Paper Type"-Continuous, it is
not necessary to set a print border.

 Page 160

 The four edit gadgets (Left, Right, Top Bottom) are for specifying this
unprintable area. For example, if you use a Citizen Swift printer, you
may need to set Left and Right to 0.25 inches, Top to 0.5 and Bottom to
0.75 inches-this stops the page being ejected before printing the footer.
If you experience problems like this with printing, consult your printer
manual for more information about the unprintable area so that you can
set your own "Print Border".

 PRINT METHOD

 When you set the print method (the default is Normal), Wordworth only
lets you use fonts which are compatible with the setting (this prevents
the accidental mixing of incompatible fonts).

 PRINT METHOD     FONTS YOU CAN USE

 Normal           Agfa Compugraphic, Adobe PostScript, TrueType and
                  bitmap (with graphics or pictures).

 Printer Font     Internal printer fonts (no graphics or pictures).


 PostScript       Only for use with expensive PostScript laser printers.
                  Uses the internal fonts of a Type 1 PostScript printer
                  (with graphics or pictures). Text not typed using
                  PostScript fonts will be printed in Courier, with
                  coloured text printed in grey. (Refer Appendix E-
                  PostScript Printers.)

 If you change the print method while editing a document, an alert box
will warn you that there are incompatible fonts in the document. If this
happens, click Yes and the fonts in the document will be automatically
converted into the correct format.

 PAPER TYPE

 Continuous: Prints pages on continuous stationery, without pausing, and
ignores "Print Border" settings.

 Cut Sheet: Pauses printing at the end of each page. If necessary, an
alert box will prompt you to insert the paper for each page, Uses "Print
Border" settings. If you have a 24-pin printer, you may find that only 16
of the 24 pins are used for printing.

 Page 161

 Sheet Feeder: Prints single sheets without pausing, and uses "Print
Border" settings. Select this option if you are using a laser printer or
the printer is fitted with an automatic cut-sheet feeder.

 AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PRINT SETUP REQUESTER ARE THREE BUTTONS

 OK: Confirms the settings made in the requester.

 PostScript: Selects the "PostScript Setup" requester if you have set the
"Print Method" to PostScript (refer Appendix E-PostScript Printers for
information about PostScript).

 Cancel: Cancels the settings made in the requester.



 11.1.9 MAIL MERGE

 Choose "Mail Merge" command (Project menu) to mail merge.

 Mail merge printing allows a document to be customised by using
information from a database file, This is usually used for sending
personalised letters and mailshots to a number of people, whose names are
stored in a data file.

 The data file should first be exported from your database as an ASCII
file. The appropriate ASCII format from the Format pop-up gadget will then
need to be set.
