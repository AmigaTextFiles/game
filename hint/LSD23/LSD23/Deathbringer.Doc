GAME CONTROLS :
 -----------

  - Controlling Karn

    We have tried to make controlling Karn as easy as possible while still

    giving you a wide variety of different manoeuvres. So , although there

    are only three basic strikes with the sword , you can ( for instance )

    jump into the air and swing.

    The three strikes takes different lenghts of time to execute , and do

    different amounts of damage accordingly . The diagrams below show Karn

    facing right.

    The controls work in exacly the same way when you are facing lef t, ex-

    cept that left and right are reserved.

GAMEPLAY :
 ------

    - Health and souls for lord Abaddon

      If you are woundered, your heath will decrease. This is represented

      as a level of fluid in a crystal ball displayed on the left-hand side

      of the status panel, at the foot of the screen. If this level is re-

      duced to zero, you are DEAD.

      The sword is hungry for souls all the time and the amount of soulpower

      in the sword at any time is shown as blood on the sword- the more blood

      , the more souls. These souls are gradually used up, maintaining Abad-

      don presence on the earthly plane , and must be replayced by killing

      things . Be warned , however, some creatures such as the warned, how-

      ever, some creatures such as the undead HAVE NO SOULS, and will not re-

      plenish the sword.

      If the sword is filled with souls, it will give you extra power to heal

      you wounds.This is the ONLY WAY you caan regain lost heath, so skill in

      combat is of the utmost importance.

      Furthmore, if the level of souls approaches zero, the sword will go ber-

      serk , and you may lose control of you own actions. Once the sword has

      been completely drained of souls, it will start to DRAIN YOU HEALTH, and

      may eventually destroy you.



Finding your way to the Wizards inner sanctum :
 --------------------------------------------

      The route to the Wizards' inner Sanctum is trought with peril, and is

      not straightforward . At the start of each level, you can choose to

      fight your way to the right or the left, and each choice will lead you

     down different path. Some of these path are longer than others and some

     even loop back into regions you may already have traveled !

     There are no route which is the right one , the longer path tend to be

     easier , and looping back enables you to remember the path (for draw a

     map) and decide which way you want to go. Some routes concentrate more

     on combat , others require skillful avoidance of traps.


                         HAVE FUN .....   Shut Berlin !!!
