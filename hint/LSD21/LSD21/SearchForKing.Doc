Cracked by: Quartex 4/3/91
Keys Commands and docs by: Time-X of SpellJammer

To issue commands to your character type in the command:
--------------------------------------------------------
Here are some command: Use    Look     Open    Close    Pick Up
                       Take   Drop     Examine Hit      Kick
		       Turn   Operate  Bend    Put      Wait
                       Break  Smell ...... ETC... 

Note the game may respond that some commands don't exits or
"I don't understand" all this means is you will need to be more specific
with what you type in! There are many more action words or verbs to find
in the game.

Ok also pressing the right mouse button will produce another window. In this
window you can change various things like sound On/Off to speed up Animation
faster or slower. NOTE I have noticed that with game speed at max for 
animations your character can get a little tricky controlling in tight
places. 


 PS. Be patient with the loading sequence of the game itself. It takes
     quite a while!!!!! Also I don't think that the game will recognize
     an external drive. Later all and have fun with the game!
