                     World Class Leaderboard Course Architect

The COURSE ARCHITECT is a versatile and fun to use feature that will let
you create your own golf course or modify an existing course.  Building a
course from scratch is a fairly ambitious undertaking, but is very
rewarding.  We suggest that you practice using the ARCHITECT by modifying
one of the existing championship courses.  Be sure to SAVE your course
often so that a crash or power outage will not cost you hours of hard work.

Although the ARCHITECT is very easy to use, it is also very powerful. 
Please read this manual carefully to get the most enjoyment out of
designing courses.

                         USING THE ARCHITECT

LOADING THE ARCHITECT

Turn on the computer and insert the KICKSTART 1.2 VERSION into the disk
drive.  When the screen asks for a workbench, insert the program disk into
the disk drive.  When the program disk has loaded, double click the left
mouse button on the GOLF icon.

Double click on the ARCH icon in the GOLF WINDOW.  When the LOAD COURSE
WINDOW comes up, click left mouse button on the course of your choice. 
(The course name should appear in the FILE WINDOW.)  Then click in the LOAD
WINDOW.

The ARCHITECT is 'COURSE ORIENTED', meaning that an entire course is opened
(loaded into memory) at one time.  You can make changes to individual
holes, rearrange holes, or bring in single holes from another course.  But
these changes exist only in the memory of the machine.  You must save your
new or modified COURSE to disk, before you load another course or exit the
ARCHITECT, or your changes will be lost.

POLYGONS AND TREES - BUILDING BLOCKS

You have two basic building blocks to work with when creating a hole:
POLYGONS and TREES.

POLYGONS:
Polygons are multi-sided figures that represent a region or area on the
ground.

 4 sided        /-----\     5 sided      /\      3 sided      /\
 polygon       /       \    polygon     /  \     polygon     /  \
              /---------\              |---/                /----\

Polygons can be filled with fairway grass, sand, water, or putting green
and can be changed (refilled) at any time.

 |-----------|    |-----------|    |------------|    |------------| |\
 |    Green  |    |   Yellow  |    |     Blue   |    |  Lt. Green | |
 |-----------|    |-----------|    |------------|    |------------| 
 Fairway Grass        Sand             Water         Putting Green

				1

NOTE: Any area that is not fairway grass, sand, water, or putting green is
considered ROUGH.

There are 20 initial polygon shapes to choose from.  Also, since polygons
can be overlayed, resized, rotated, and flipped, there are few shapes that
cannot be produced.

TREES:
When designing a course, you can place up to 192 trees on each hole, and
each tree can be a different height. (Within maximum and minimum limits).

TREE GROUPS:
Each course is assigned one of 4 TREE GROUPS and within each group are 4
TREE TYPES.

Tree Group # 1

Tree Group # 2

Tree Group # 3

Tree Group # 4

Although there are 16 total types of trees, any course can utilize only one
group at a time.  For example, you can assign Tree Group # 3 to Cypress
Creek instead of Tree Group # 1, but you would still only have 4 trees to
choose from.  Existing trees would change from group 1 to group 3.  Tree
heights would adjust (if necessary) so as not to exceed the maximum height
allowed for the particular tree type.  Famous Courses disk will contain
additional tree groups.

				2

HOLES

While using the ARCHITECT you have access to all 18 holes at anytime. 
Simply click on the appropriate radio button for that hole.  The buttons
are located at the far right edge of the screen.  As each new button is
selected, the MAIN and ZOOm WINDOWS will display the corresponding hole. 
Also note that the MAIN WINDOW scale will adjust to efficiently utilize the
majority of the screen.  This scaling can be changed using the MAIN WINDOW
SIZE option under the VIEW MENU.

      |------------------|----------------------|---|---|

HIGHLIGHTING OBJECTS

An object (tree or polygon) must be highlighted before it can be moved or
edited.  This is done by placing the mouse arrow (be sure PASTE is OFF)
over the object you wish to highlight and then pressing the mouse button. 
A highlighted polygon will have a black line around it.  A highlighted tree
will turn white.  To unhighlight an object, simply click the button while
the cursor is not touching a polygon or tree or on another object.

MOVING OBJECTS

Polygons or trees can be moved in either the MAIN WINDOW or the ZOOM
WINDOW.  First, place the arrow cursor (be sure PASTE is OFF) over the
object you wish to move, and then click and hold the mouse button.  This
will highlight the object.  Now 'drag' it to the desired location and
release the button.

THE PASTE WINDOW

The PASTE WINDOW displays the object (tree or polygon that is currently
ready to be 'pasted' onto the playing surface. An object is moved into the
PASTE WINDOW through one of the following operations:  CUT, COPY, SELECT
POLYGON, or SELECT TREES.  Both CUT and COPY are options under the EDIT
menu.  These options take the highlighted tree or polygon and place it in
the PASTE WINDOW.  (See the Edit section for more information).  The SELECT
POLYGON and SELECT TREES options are under the SELECT menu.  These options
allow you to choose a polygon from among 20 different shapes or a tree from
among 4 different types.  The polygon or tree selected is then place in the
PASTE WINDOW.  Objects in the window are pasted on the playing surface in
the following manner:

				3

1. Turn paste 'on' (click the 'Paste On' button).
2. Move the paste cursor (a small glue bottle) to the appropriate spot, and
   click and hold the mouse button.  This will reveal the outline of the
   object.
3. Move the object to its final position and release the button.
4. After you're done pasting, be sure to turn the paste function 'off'.

THE ATTRIBUTES WINDOW

The ATTRIBUTES WINDOW displays information about trees or polygons and
allows you to change certain attributes.  When 'paste' is on, the
attributes are those of whatever object is in the PASTE WINDOW.  If 'paste'
is off and an object is highlighted, then the attributes are those of the
highlighted object.

If a tree is being pasted or is highlighted, the window will display the
type of tree and its height.  Both can be changed.  Change the type of tree
by clicking on one of the 'TYPE BOXES' or change the height by clicking on
the left arrows (smaller) or right arrows (larger).  The tree type boxes
correspond to the patterns of the trees used in the MAIN and ZOOM WINDOWS.

  Tree Type Boxes

Polygon Attributes in the ATTRIBUTES WINDOW and ZOOM WINDOW CONTROLS

REMEMBER: The ATTRIBUTES WINDOW reflects information for the
highlighted object unless 'paste' is on, in which case the window
reflects information for the object being pasted.

THE ZOOM WINDOW CONTROLS

	1 - This option activates the ZOOM WINDOW cursor which shows
     how much area will be shown in the Zoom Window.  When the
     cursor box is the correct size and the correct location on the
     MAIN WINDOW, click the cursor and that area will appear in the
     ZOOM WINDOW.

	2 - Clicking the cursor in these windows will adjust the size
     of the ZOOM WINDOW cursor box when the cursor is activated. 
     When the cursor is not activated, these windows will adjust
     the size of the ZOOM WINDOW.

	3 - Clicking the cursor in these windows will move the objects
     within the ZOOM WINDOW corresponding to the arrow direction.

PULL DOWN MENUS

Most features are accessed using pull down menus.

The 5 menu names (COURSE, HOLE, EDIT, SELECT, VIEW) are always activated at
the top of the screen by clicking the right mouse button while the cursor
is in the menu bar area.  Under each MENU NAME is a list of MENU OPTIONS.

To display the menu options, move the cursor, while holding down the
button, to the menu name (e.g. EDIT).  The menu options will be displayed
directly under the menu name.  To select an option, keep the button
depressed and pull the cursor downward slowly.  Each option will highlight
as the cursor passes it.  When the option you want is highlighted, release
the button.  This will select the option.

                                5

KEYBOARD EQUIVALENTS

Many menu options have keyboard equivalents (A plus some key) that will
perform the same function.  These will prove useful at times, especially
for certain operations such as deleting trees, etc.  The keyboard
equivalent (if there is one) is displayed directly adjacent to its menu
option.

MENU # 1 - COURSE

OPTIONS:

New Course - This option will erase the current course in memory and set
all 18 holes to the DEFAULT hole.  The default hole consists of a tee box,
green and a section of fairway.  This option is normally used when you wish
to start from scratch and design a complete course.

Open Course - This option will open a course (load it into memory) for
modification.  Any existing course in memory will be erased.  When OPEN is
selected, you will be given a list of the courses on the disk that is
currently in the drive.  To select a course, click on the course name, then
click in the LOAD WINDOW.  If you wish to change disks, click on the
appropriate device (DF0:, DF1:, DH:) and proceed as before.

Install Hard Disk -

Select Tree Group - This option is used to select or change tree groups. 
There are 4 tree groups, each containing 4 different trees.  Thus there are
16 trees total, but only 4 (1 group) are available on a course.  More tree
groups will be supplied with FAMOUS COURSE disk.  See the section on
Polygons and Trees for more information on tree groups.

Save Course - This option saves the course that is currently in memory out
to disk.  When SAVE is selected, a SAVE COURSE WINDOW will appear.  To save
the course using an existing file name, click on that name then click in
the SAVE WINDOW.  If you wish to give the course a new name then click the
left cursor button at the left side of the FILE WINDOW and type in the new
name.  Then click in the SAVE WINDOW.

Quit - Terminates the program and returns to the GOLF WINDOW in the
workbench.

MENU # 2 - HOLE

OPTIONS:

New Hole - This option erases the currently selected hole and replaces it
with the default hole.  The default hole consists of a tee box, fairway and
green, and is normally used when building a hole from scratch.  At this
point you may modify the default hole polygons or eliminate them using the
delete function.

Copy Hole - This option allows you to replace the current selected hole
with a hole from another course.  For example, suppose you are currently
making modifications to the Cypress Creek course and you wish to replace
hole #11 of Cypress with a copy of hole #2 from Doral.  First, click the
radio button for hole #11.  This will display the current Cypress Creek
version of hole #11.  Now, select the COPY HOLE option under the HOLE menu.
 A dialog box will appear, displaying course names which exist on the disk
which is in the drive.  (If you wish to change disks, insert new disk into
disk drive.)  Now, click on the course that contains the hole you are
after.  In this example, it would be Doral Country Club.  Then, click on
the COPY WINDOW.  Next, you must select the hole to be copied.  We would
pick hole #2

                                6

in this example, and then click 'OK'.  The hole we had been working on. 
Cypress #11, would be erased and replaced with a copy of Doral #2 Tree
sizes will be adjusted if necessary.  You can view the holes available on
the MAIN WINDOW SCREEN simply by clicking on the radio button associated
with that hole.

MENU # 3 - EDIT

Editing of trees or polygons must be done in the following manner.  First a
tree or polygon must be highlighted.  This is done by moving the arrow over
the object you wish to select and then pressing the left mouse button.  A
highlighted polygon will have a black line around it.  A highlighted tree
will turn white.  Next, the editing operation is performed by selecting the
appropriate option (cut, copy, delete, etc.) from the EDIT menu.  Thus the
sequence is HIGHLIGHT first, then select the EDIT OPTION.  This rule
applies to all edit options except DELETE TREE BLOCK.

NOTE: The tee box polygon at the bottom of the MAIN WINDOW SCREEN cannot be
edited.

OPTIONS:

Cut - This option will delete the highlighted tree or polygon and place it
in the PASTE WINDOW.  This option is especially useful when you wish to
pick up an object, change the ZOOM WINDOW, and then replace it in the NEW
WINDOW.  Be sure to turn paste 'on' before you attempt to replace the
object.  Also remember to turn paste 'off' when you are finished pasting.

Copy - This option performs the same function as CUT, but does not delete
the highlighted tree or polygon from the hole.

Delete - This option will delete the highlighted tree or polygon.  Be sure
to learn to use the keyboard equivalent (A-D) for this option.  It is much
quicker, especially when doing multiple polygons and trees.

Flip Horizontally - This option applies to polygons only and will flip the
highlighted polygon from left to right.

Flip Vertically - This option applies to polygons only and will flip the
highlighted polygon from bottom to top.

Size - This option applies to polygons only and is implemented as follows:

	1. Highlight the polygon.
	2. Select the SIZE option.
	3. Place the cursor within the selected polygon and then
           click and hold the button.  Now drag the shape to the
           size you want and release the button.  If the polygon needs
           to be moved, simply click on it and hold the button.  Then
           drag it to the desired location and drop it by releasing
           the button.

Rotate - This option applies to polygons only and will rotate the shape a
full 360 degrees about its center.  Do the following:

	1. Highlight the polygon.
	2. Select the ROTATE option.

                                7

	3. Place the cursor within the selected polygon and then click
           and hold the button.  Now drag the cursor out away from the
           polygon and notice how the outline of the shape rotates
           slightly.  Move the cursor in a circular motion out around the
           polygon (use the polygon as the center and the cursor as the
           perimeter.)  The shape will rotate as the cursor moves.  When
           you have rotated to the desired angle, release the button.  You
           may now move the polygon as described above (see SIZE) if
           needed.

Delete Tree Block - This option applies to trees only and will delete all
trees within a rectangular block.  Do the following:

	1. Select the DELETE TREE BLOCK option.  The cursor will
           change to a cross hair.
	2. Position the cursor at any corner of the rectangular area
           of trees you wish to delete, click and hold the button, then
           drag the rectangle in any direction, until it covers the area
           you want and release the button.  All trees within the rectangle
           will be deleted.

MENU # 4 - SELECT

OPTIONS:

Polygons - This option allows you to select one of 20 polygon shapes for
pasting.  To select and paste a polygon, do the following:

	1. Choose the POLYGON option.
	2. Click on he shape of your choice.
	3. Click on the 'OK'.  The shape will now appear in the PASTE
           WINDOW. (The polygon may be cut off if it is too large to fit
	   in the window).
	4. Click the 'Paste On' button.
	5. Click the desired fill pattern in the ATTRIBUTES WINDOW
           (fairway, sand, water, green).
	6. Move to the MAIN or ZOOM WINDOW and then click and hold the
	   button.
	7. Now drag the polygon to the proper location and drop it by
	   releasing the button.  (Up to 50 polygons are allowed on each
	   hole, and each polygon can be filled with your choice of fairway
	   grass, sand, water, or green.  However, you can only have one
	   putting green per hole.)
	8. Turn PASTE OFF.
	9. You may now size, rotate, or flip the polygon to almost any
	   shape you want.

Trees - This option allows you to select one of four trees for pasting.  To
select and paste a tree, do the following:

	1. Choose the TREE option.
	2. Click on the tree type of your choice.
	3. Click on 'OK'.  A small image (top view) of the tree will appear
	   in the PASTE WINDOW.
	4. Click the 'Paste On' button.
	5. You may change the tree height or type if you desire in the
	   ATTRIBUTES WINDOW.
	6. Move to the MAIN or ZOOM WINDOW and click and hold the button.
	7. Now drag the tree to the proper location and drop it by
	   releasing the button.
	8. Repeat steps 5 thru 7 as often as you wish (up to 192 trees) 
	   until you've placed the trees you want.
	9. Turn PASTE OFF.
       10. Now you may make changes in heights or type of trees by
           highlighting a tree and then changing its height or type in the
           ATTRIBUTES WINDOW.

Pin Location - This option is used to locate the pin (flag) on the hole. 
There are no rules as to where the pin may be placed, however, WORLD CLASS
LEADER BOARD performs pin and putting checks in the following manner:

	1. The pin must be located within a polygon that is filled with
	   Putting Green or putting will not be allowed.
	2. Putting is only allowed within 64 feet of the Pin.  Beyond this
	   point, you must chip.  This is because of the limits of the
	   putting range.  (Putting in the Rough, Fairway, or Sand is not
	   allowed.)

To set the pin location, do the following:

	1. Choose the PIN LOCATION option.
	2. Move the cursor to the approximate location and click the
	   button.
	3. Pin will now appear highlighted.
	4. Drag it to the desired position and release the button.

Green Slope - Par - This option allows you to set the amount and direction
of the slope for the green and the par for the hole.  Do the following:

	1. Choose the GREEN SLOPE - PAR option.  A dialog box will appear.
	2. Click the desired 'Amount of Slope' button (1 thru 9).
	3. Use the left and right arrows to set the direction of slope.
	4. Click the desired 'Par' value for the hole (3, 4, 5).
	5. Click 'OK'.

MENU # 5 - VIEW

Options:

Front View - This option is one of the more powerful and enjoyable features
of the ARCHITECT.  It allows you to go out on the course and look at what
you've been designing.  To use the front view feature, do the following:

	1. Select the FRONT VIEW option.  The cursor will change to a hand
	   with a pointing finger.
	2. Using the cursor, point to the spot where you wish to place an
	   imaginary ball and click the button.
	3. The screen will change to the perspective view from behind the
	   ball.  Although the ball doesn't appear on the screen, its
	   location is in the center of the screen about 1/2" up from the
	   bottom

				9

	   border (the same as when playing the game.)  A small box will
	   appear which shows your current viewing direction.  Initially
	   you will be looking towards the Pin.
	4. Use the arrows (within the viewing box) to rotate yourself left
	   or right.  Then click in the REDRAW WINDOW.
	5. Now pick a new position for the ball by clicking in the 
	   perspective view.  Again, the ball won't actually be there, but
	   using the ball as a reference makes it easier to move around.
	   As you move, you will always face in the direction of the
	   indicator.
	6. Try sliding sideways by clicking the cursor directly to the 
	   right or left of the ball position.
	7. Try backing up slowly by clicking the cursor directly below the
	   ball position at the bottom of the screen.
	8. Try moving and turning at the same time.  First, use the arrows
	   to change your viewing direction, then instead of clicking
           'redraw', click the cursor at your new location.
	9. To exit the FRONT VIEW mode, click in the CANCEL WINDOW.

NOTE: You are only allowed to move forward a certain distance at a time. 
If the cursor changes from a pointing hand to an arrow, you are out of
range.  Also, you cannot keep walking forever.  Basically, you cannot leave
the area shown on the MAIN WINDOW at its smallest scale.

Main Window Size - This option is used to change the number of yards
displayed (the scale) of the MAIN WINDOW.  When a hole is first selected,
the program automatically adjusts the scale to the largest value possible
with all objects on screen.  This is called 'full' scale.  Regardless of
the value selected, the tee off point will always be shown.  It is the only
immovable point on the entire hole.  To change the MAIN WINDOW SIZE, do the
following:

	1. Select the MAIN WINDOW SIZE option.
	2. Click the appropriate 'yards displayed' button.  (Click 'full'
           if you wish to return to full scale.)
	3. Click 'OK'.

Useful Tip: It is often useful to divide a hole in half, displaying the
bottom half in the MAIN WINDOW and the top half in the ZOOM WINDOW.  This
gives a larger overall scale without having to constantly change the ZOOM
WINDOW location.

Course View - This option displays a top view of all 18 holes of the
current course in memory.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND SUGGESTIONS

1. Tee Off Point
The Tee Off point is fixed and cannot be moved.  The polygon that
represents the tee box cannot be changed.

2. Zoom Window Size
Keeping the zoom window large (smaller trees and polygons) will reduce the
time it takes to redraw the screen.

3. Keyboard Equivalents
Learn to use the keyboard equivalents for frequently used commands, such as
'delete'.  Keep your left hand on the two keys, move the cursor with your
right hand.  This is especially useful when deleting trees.

4. Maximum Number of Polygons
The maximum number of polygons allowable is 50 per hole (sand, water,
fairway, green).  Although you are allowed only one green per hole, it is
advisable, however, to use as small a number as possible to keep the
drawing time short.  Both WORLD CLASS and the ARCHITECT will draw slower if
more polygons are present.  NOTE: There is a memory limit to the total
amount of polygons allowed in an 18 hole course.  A course cannot have 18
holes with each hole having the maximum number of polygons.  However, the
buffer is large enough to contain all but the most complex of courses.

5. Height of Trees
Be aware that if trees are made too short, they often look inappropriate. 
Bushes and smaller trees usually look better at small heights.

6. Saving Courses
Although you can save your course in any drawer, WORLD CLASS will only work
correctly when they are placed on a disk that contains the WORLD CLASS
LEADERBOARD drawer.  This is so the courses will be able to access trees
and other essential data files appropriately.

                            IMPORTANT

BACK-UP COPIES
With the Architect Program on the same disk as the World Class Leaderboard
Game Program, it is important that you make a back-up copy of the Program
Disk for your back-up files.

SAVING NEW COURSES:
There will not be enough room on your Program Disk to store ANY new courses
that are created on the Course Architect.

BEFORE CREATING A NEW COURSE WITH THE ARCHITECT COMPLETE THE FOLLOWING
PROCEDURE:

1. Turn on the computer and insert the KICKSTART Disk Version 1.2 into the
   disk drive.

2. When the screen asks for a workbench, insert the WORLD CLASS LEADERBOARD
   PROGRAM DISK into the disk drive.

3. Next you will see a workbench screen with the GOLF icon on it.  Remove
   the program disk and insert a blank disk into the disk drive.

4. Initialize and format the blank disk by clicking once with the left
   button on the DF0:BAD icon.  Then click and hold the right button to
   activate the pull down menus at the top of the screen.

5. Pull down the DISK menu until the INITIALIZE option is highlighted, then
   release the button.

6. After a few screen prompts, the blank disk will be initialized and
   formatted by the computer.  (Approximately 30 seconds.)

7. After the disk has been initialized, use the workbench tools in the 
   pull down menus to re-name the disk if you desire.

8. Next, generate the Disk Workbench Windows on the screen by double
   clicking on each of the icons.  Arrange the windows on the screen so
   that both can be seen at the same time.

9. You must transfer two items to the empty disk.


        A.     |---------|	B.	|---------|
               |---------|              |         |
                  WCLB                  |   WCLB  |
                                        |---------|
                                           Golf

   This can be accomplished by clicking and holding the object in the GOLF
   Workbench Window and dragging it over to the EMPTY Workbench Window and
   releasing the button.  The computer will then copy the file from your
   Program Disk to the New Disk.  (Follow the screen prompts.)

   (REMEMBER, YOU MUST COPY BOTH ITEMS TO THE NEW DISK.)

10. Now any courses that are created with the Architect must be saved to
    the new disk.

11. To play a course that is created on the Architect, you must load the 
    game from the disk that the course was saved to.

    HARD DISK INSTALLATION:

    To play the game or use the Architect from a hard disk, you must 
    transfer the World Class Leaderboard GOLF files and the Architect TOOLS
    files to the hard drive.
