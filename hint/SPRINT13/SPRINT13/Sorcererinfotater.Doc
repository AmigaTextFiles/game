----------------------------------------------------------
 

Hellhound--Fast, fierce, and capable of devouring a human 12 times its size in
 3 1/2 seconds. Normally inhabits burnt-out or enchanted woods and rearely 
ventures beyond its own turf, even in pursuit of prey.  Hellhounds are 
purple-white-gray-red-gray.

Dryad--Also called 'tree sprite'. Beautifully shy. Many spend lifetime under 
one tree. If coaxed, may reveal location of forest treasures.  Will fight only
in self defense and only in large numbers, pelting foes with tons of rose 
petals.  When awake, dryads are black-gray-white-red-red.

Bloodworm--Found in shallow underground pools;often mistaken for mossy 
boulders. Pointy, retractable fangs can extend up to 32".  Most bloodworms are
repelled by the smell of boiled chives. Bloodworms are usually 
white-gray-black-red-black.

Rotgrub--Less than 1" long;smells like very cheap old cheese;impervious to all 
forms of magic. Hide in food until ingested, then burrows straight to victim's
brain and feeds for years before death mercifully arrives.  Common household 
rotgrubs are gray-red-gray-purple-red.

Yipple--Master of disguise, able to change form.  In the wild, may bite if 
disturbed. Violently allergic to many kinds of animal wastes.  Tame yipples 
make wonderful pets, but should be kept out of cookie jars when guest visit. 
On a white background, yipples look gray-purple-white-purple-black.

Kobold--Lives in small tribes in caverns and very dark forests. Similar to 
paskald, except middle toe is shorter than toes that flank it;also, far more 
belligerent.  If attacked, will fight back; if not attacked, will fight back 
anyway. Coloration: red-purple-black-purple-red/

Surmin--Characterized by malodorous breath, lice-ridden fur, and general 
repulsivness.  If allowed to approach close enough, can bore its victim to 
death by reciting Greater Borphee County Penal Codes. A newly-shaved surmin is
black-black-purple-red-black.

Nabiz--A nabiz is mostly mouth, and that is mostly teeth.  Instinctively 
attacks enemy's weak point. Contrary to folklore, cannot fly, but leaps vast 
distances. Is repulsed by the color blue, hence that colors popularity in 
adventurers' garb.  Nabiz are purple-black-black-black-red.

Dorn--Can paralyze with a single glare from its powerful eys. Range 20' for 
adults. Dorns commonly inhabit crags and shadows near cliff bases.  According 
to the last words of dying explorers, dorn beasts are 
gray-purple-black-gray-white.

Grue--A sinister lurking presence in the dark places of the earth. Favorite 
snack is unwary Enchanters. Fears light: No grue has ever been seen by the 
light of day. Toxicologits believe that grues are probably 
black-black-red-black-purple.

Brogmoid--In rare cases, these squat creatures can achieve intelligence level 
of a 3-year old human. Often seen in wild foraging in huge packs for edible 
rocks. Live much longer in captivity; can even be trained to perform simple 
tasks. Usually red-purple-red-black-purple.

Orc--Erstwhile warring race who became civilized through their fondness for 
computer adventure games. Although a small faction (HiRes Orcs) enjoy graphics,
the vast majority (Orc from Zork) prefer text games.  By the light of a CRT 
screen, orcs are red-gray-purple-gray-red.

Have fun.
