                             MISSION DISK VOL. 1

Missions.
~~~~~~~~~
  The only difference between  the  new  missions  and  those  found  in 
the original "Falcon" disk is the overall mission framework.

Mission: Operation Grandslam.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Objective:  Total  defeat  of  the enemy forces by destroying all the
enemy industrial and ground assets. Such major damage to its manufacturing
industry will  force  the  enemy  to  negotiate on peace terms and halt its
aggressive intentions  towards  the  country  whose  freedom  you  are 
protecting.  The objective  is not to invade and subjugate the hostile
territory but merely to destroy the enemy's offensive potential  and  force
 him  to  recognise  that further  hostile  acts would be fruitless.  The
fate of the nation is in your hands.

  To complete this objective,  your Falcon fighter will be based at a
forward airfield  on  the edge of enemy territory.  This airfield,  whilst
adequately defended against air attack is very vulnerable to enemy  ground 
forces.  You must  prevent  the  enemy forces from over running the base, 
but at the same time,  attack the enemy industrial installations and
eventually  destroy  all such installations.

  Beware,  if  enemy  ground  forces  reach  the airfield,  you will be
taken prisoner and possibly executed for "war crimes".

  Whilst every enemy target destroyed  will  contribute  towards  success 
in Operation Grandslam, just as in the original "Falcon", points are
awarded for destroying specific targets depending on which  mission  has 
been  selected. Here  are  a  list  of the missions you can undertake and
the hazards you are likely to face.

  See map for location of the following mission targets:

1. Rolling Thunder.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Objective:          Destroy at least three tanks.

Waypoints:          D1

Effective weapons:  AGM-65b Maverick
                    Mk84 2000lb bomb

  The tanks will move from the South side of the lake NE of the airbase in 
a SW  direction  towards  the  airbase.  The  T-80  tank is immune to your
30mm cannon,  so be careful to preserve your ordnance.  It is absolutely
vital  to destroy  all  the tanks with one mission in order to allow you to
get on with the vital strategic missions on which the operation depends in
the  knowledge that you have an airfield to return to.

  As the tanks get nearer your airfield,  you will not be distracted by
enemy fighters which are driven away by the air  defence  umbrella  close 
to  your airfield.

  You will be warned when the tanks are approaching dangerously close to
your airfield.  Your F-16 map display will not  indicate  whether  there 
are  any active  enemy tanks.  However,  once you get airborne you'll soon
find out by the pyrotechnics of the land battle as the T-80's fight their
way forward.

2. Water Sport.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Objective:          Destroy at least three landing craft.

Waypoint:           D2

Effective weapons:  AGM-65b Maverick
                    Mk84 2000lb bomb
                    30mm cannon

  Although  this mission can easily be combined with "Rolling Thunder" in
the interests of overall strategic requirements, once the immediate threat
to the airfield  has been removed by taking out the tanks,  the landing
craft should be the next target.  Here the 30mm cannon comes into its  own 
with  strafing runs  over  the lake.  The landing craft move SW from one
side of the lake to the other. Once at the SW shore, the landing craft will
unload a tank. Once a landing  craft  has  reached  the shore,  it will be
stationary and hence far easier to find and hit;  but then again,  it will
already have delivered  its cargo and done its job.

  You will be informed when the landing craft reach the lake shore.

3. Truck Interdiction.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Objective:          Destroy the truck convoy.

Waypoint:           None

Effective weapons:  AGM-65b Maverick
                    Mk84 2000lb bomb
                    30mm cannon

  The truck convoy supplies the enemy's  attempts  to  attack  the 
airfield. Knocking  out  the  convoy  will  provide  some respite from the
onslaught of landing craft and tanks.  The convoy starts out from the road
in the North of enemy  territory.  The truck travel west and then turn due
South over a river bridge and offload their supplies where the road ends
near the lake.

  Once you've found them, they should be a piece of cake but its very easy
to louse  up a simple mission like this by concentrating too hard on
looking for the trucks and falling to a SAM or a MIG because you weren't
awake.  Cut down relative  motion  by  attacking from straight behind the
convoy.  You will be informed when the trucks reach the bridge which will 
at  least  narrow  down your search area.  Once the truck convoy reaches
its destination,  the ground forces will be resupplied and another convoy
will start out at the  start  of the next mission.

4. Train Interdiction.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Objective:          Destroy train.

Waypoint:           D4, D5

Effective weapons:  AGM-65b Maverick
                    Mk84 2000lb bomb
                    30mm cannon

  Train  busting  is as old as ground attack.  But from Sopwith Pups to
F-16s the problems are the same:  find it and then destroy a  fast  moving 
target. What's  worse,  this train is a pretty tough cookie and will not
worry if you belt a few holes in the track. You will also have to destroy
each part of the train individually, its no good just taking out the first
truck and expecting the rest of it to grind to a halt.  On the other hand, 
most of the track  is mercifully free of SAM sites so you'll only have the
MIGs to worry about.

  Like the truck convoy,  knocking the train out will slow down enemy
efforts to resupply its front line troops and so take the pressure off  the
 airfield and allow you to get on with longer range missions.

  Ground Control will warn you when the train crosses the river bridge. 
Like the  trucks,  another  train  will  start  off  as  soon  as  one
reaches its destination.  Apart from the tanks themselves,  these supply
convoys have got to be near the top of your agenda.  If too many of these
get through, you are going to be fighting a loosing battle against a never
ending stream of  tanks and landing craft.

5. Wild Weasel.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Objective:          Destroy at least four SAM sites.

Waypoints:          Various

Effective weapons:  AGM-65b Maverick
                    Mk84 2000lb bomb
                    30mm cannon

  This mission is a useful prelude to virtually all the  remaining 
missions. Most  of  the  strategic  objectives  are guarded by SAM sites. 
Carrying the ordnance to deal with the SAM sites (including a jamming pod, 
if you can get one)  means  that  it  is usually not practical to take out
the SAM sites you need before hand and then come back before they are
repaired for a clear  run at the target.

  At  colonel  level,  be  prepared for the SAM sites to launch SA-6
Gainfuls despite jamming.  With this missile's 80 kg HE warhead  and 
proximity  fuse, even  if jamming throws it off a bit,  it can still do
some heavy damage.  So get them before they get you. The only way to stop
an SA-6 is to fly low, but then the SA-7s might get you. Still, what do we
give you Colonel's pay for.

6. Dragon Jaw.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Objective:          Destroy road bridge.

Waypoint:           D7

Effective weapons:  AGM-65b Maverick
                    Mk84 2000lb bomb

  Why  mess  around  trying  to  find  the  truck  convoy when a much
simpler solution to the problem is to take out the bridge the convoy  has 
to  cross? There  is  the  little  problem  of  the SAM sites on either
side of the road leading to the bridge so there might be a case for driving
hard up  the  west edge  of  the map and then pulling round to take the
bridge from behind.  The Maverick is possibly the weapon of choice here.
With such a nice large single target  like this,  it may be possible to
take it out without sacrificing too much height or speed thus reducing your
vulnerability to MIGs and SAMs.

  Once the bridge is out,  the trucks just mill about in the vicinity of 
the bridge and thus become sitting ducks for future missions.

7. Dragon Tail.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Objective:          Destroy the rail bridge.

Waypoint:           D8

Effective weapons:  Mk84 2000lb bomb

  This big,  solid constructed rail bridge has been a real problem  for 
high command  for  some time.  High level strategic bombing has failed to
shift it and light attack with A-10s and AV-8b Jump Jets have  just 
bounced  off.  So what  is  required  is  a couple of well placed 2000
pounders around the main span. Once again, this is a much more permanent
way of stopping supplies than taking out the train. The enemy has always
got another train, the bridge will take some time to repair.

  A high precision dive bomb run is possibly the  optimum  attack 
technique. Fortunately there aren't any adjacent SAM sites so you should
get a clear run at the target.  However,  a heavy warload is going to make
you a sitting duck for the MIGs.  So get there fast at high level on full
burner, drop your load and then look around for bandits (read: GET THE HELL
OUT OF THERE!).

8. POL Mission.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Objective:          Destroy all three fuel tanks at the oil refinery.

Waypoint:           D9

Effective weapons:  AGM-65b Maverick
                    Mk84 2000lb bomb
                    30mm cannon

  This  is  one of the most trickiest missions of the lot.  The three
targets are not arranged in a line so you are very likely to need two
passes  at  the target.  Naturally  enough,  there  are  no  less  than
four SAM sites in the vicinity - two very close indeed.  It is also the
target deepest in the enemy territory  so you are likely to have to fight
your way in and out.  There are also other SAM sites en route  so  you'll 
have  to  choose  you  route  very carefully. Still keen to volunteer? Good
luck!

  Naturally, fuel supplies are vital to every aspect of the enemy effort
from supplying fuel for fighters to keeping the tanks  rolling  to  the 
front  so takeing out this target will really hurt them.

9. Blue Bandit.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Objective:          Destroy enemy landing strip.

Waypoint:           D10

Effective weapons:  Durandel anti-runway bomb

  Sorting out MIG-29s when they get into the air can be a tricky problem. 
So the simple solution is to stop them getting there. Whilst a raid on the
enemy airfield will not directly affect your ultimate objective,  it will 
restrict enemy  air  activity  and  thus make you life a whole lot more
peaceful.  The airstrip is only out of action when both runways have been
cratered, although one  Durandel  at  the intersection will do the trick. 
Watch out for the SAM sites just to the south of the airfield, it is
definitely good advise to take these out first.

  Intelligence believes that the airfield may well be the test site for a
new experimental enemy aircraft. This aircraft uses stolen US Stealth
technology. It  is thus unlikely to be possible to detect with radar,  and
IR suppression may make it immune to your winders.  So use that good old 
standby,  the  Mk1 eyeball, to find it and then get some practice with your
deflection shooting. As far as intelligence is aware, the experimental
fighter is unarmed; despite this, be careful, S-2 does not know everything.

10. Sledge Hammer.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Objective:          Shut down the tank factory by destroying
                    any two buildings.

Waypoint:           D11

Effective weapons:  AGM-65b Maverick
                    Mk84 2000lb bomb

  Once the two SAM sites just to the west of  the  factory  have  been 
dealt with,  this  one  should  be  high  on  your  list  of  candidates 
for early destruction.  Once this one is out of the way, you have
effectively ended the enemy threat to your airfield.  Obviously the enemy
will seek to repair it as rapidly as possible, so it's worth a return trip
every now and then.

11. Thunderbolt.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Objective:          Shutdown the power station by destroying
                    any two of the cooling towers.

Waypoint:           D12

Effective weapons:  AGM-65b Maverick
                    Mk84 2000lb bomb

  Once you get to it, this is a reasonably easy target. Its easy to find
just downstream from river junction and near the mountains. There are also
none of those irksome SAM sites to worry about. Getting there is another
matter. It's a question of trying to thread your way between the SAM sites 
in  the  swamp and those around the airfield.

  Destroying  the power station will halt all production throughout the
enemy industrial region until the power is brought back on the line.  Such
a  vital target  is  bound  to  be well defended by enemy air assets so
expect a bumpy ride.

12. Flaming Dart.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Objective:          Shutdown the arsenal by destroying
                    any two of the four buildings.

Waypoint:           D13

Effective weapons:  AGM-65b Maverick
                    Mk84 2000lb bomb
                    30mm cannon

  The simplest approach to this one is to fly right up the edge of the map
at cruising altitude.  Then, once you reach the road at the top of the map,
turn and dive on the target.  With a little luck,  you can hit the target 
and  be gone before they know what's hit them.  It is a compact and small
target area so the Mavericks definitely look like the best bet.  Only go 
with  the  2000 pounders  if  the  crew  chief lets you down,  or if you
like really big bomb craters or your a plain masochist who likes humping
heavy  weapon  loads  for miles over enemy territory.

  Once  again,  destruction  of this target will halt the flow of material
to the front and buy you valuable time.

Strategy.
~~~~~~~~~
  Initially  the  key  is survival.  On your first sortie,  you should aim
to destroy the tanks with Mavericks and then destroy the landing craft with
 any left over Mavericks and the cannon. Possibly the second mission should
aim at one of the bridges.  After that,  you've got a bit of a breathing
space  from the  immediate  threat  of  loosing the game and you can start
to look at the strategic options.

  The enemy tank stockpile is resupplied as soon as the landing craft 
beach. So  if  you  allow all three landing craft to beach,  you can expect
a steady stream of tanks to attack you airfield for the next few  missions.
 Therefore the  first flight is absolutely vital to success of failure. 
Blow it and you are likely to be in for a very hard fight indeed.  If you
"buy the farm"  the positions  of  all  the  enemy units are reset.  If you
want to continue from where you left off,  you can choose a pilot with the
same name.  The scenario continues  from  where  you left off,  but
obviously the new pilot starts off from zero as far as points and medals
go. If, on the other hand, the scenario is  going  badly,  if  a different
pilot is chosen from the duty roster,  the scenario will start from
scratch.

  An important point to bare in mind is how long  the  various  targets 
stay destroyed once hit.

        Object              No. of missions that the object
                                   remain destroyed
        Bridges                         5
        Factories                       5
        SAM sites                       3
        Trains                          3
        Runways                         2
        Trucks                          2
        Landing craft                   1
        Tanks                           1

  From  this  list,  it  can be seen that ultimate victory can be obtained
by merely picking off on of the four key  industrial  sites  each  mission.
 But obviously  should  one  mission  fail,  you could be faced with the
factories repairing themselves just as quickly as you can destroy them.

  Don't forget,  even if you do cause a total industrial shutdown,  you
could still  loose if the enemy overrun the airfield using the supplies
that are in the pipeline. After the airfield has been overrun and you have
been captured, the scenario will be reset for you to have another go.

  If  you  manage  to  achieve enemy industrial shutdown when flying at
Major level or above,  you will receive the highest  US  Military 
decoration,  the Congressional Medal of Honour.

End message:

  Hope this manual will help you fly the missions  of  this  advanced 
flight simulator,  and  thereby  recognise  this  piece of fine programming
as being worth buying and supporting.

Trev.
