Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Well, Dogfight Simulator is yet another version of that old game where
each player controls a biplane and tries to kill the other players.  BUT,
there's a difference - up to four players can play at once!  No more wimpy
one-on-one dogfights!

   Once the game has loaded, simply press F1-F4 to choose the controls for
each player (choosing "Out to Lunch" lets you play with less than four
players), and then press F5 to start.  Each player starts with ten lives,
and the last player left alive wins.

   Pressing F6 brings up the option screen :

 o F1 : Scroll Wrap
   ----------------
   When scroll wrap mode is off there is no wrap-round at the sides of the
   screen, so you can't fly off one side of the screen and appear at the
   other; If you try to you'll blow up.  However, if you're in a stall then
   you're allowed to wrap-round should you float off the edge of the screen.

   This option was included because Jez (officially ranked 9th) keeps
   insisting that he is the 'number one central screen flyer not like you
   poofs who fly around the edge of the screen not getting involved in the
   action.' With this mode on, Jez still comes last every game, proving that
   he's crap at flying wherever the rest of us are on the screen =c)


 o F2 : One Plane
   --------------
   When there's a queue for Dogfight Simulator it's customary for the first
   player that dies to vacate his or her flying console in order for the
   next person in the queue to take up the challenge.

   However, it is possible for two players to die simultaniously first, in
   which case there is an obvious deadlock as to who should be 'resigned'.
   This option solves this problem by pitching the two offenders against
   each other in a 'one plane' playoff.  The winner of which stays on.

   Only switch this option on if there is a queue for Dogfight Simulator.


 o F3 : Auto Launch
   ----------------
   This option was coded to stop Jez cheating.  (Jez's most skillfull tactic
   is to sit on the ground conserving his lives whilst the rest of us fly
   around killing each other.) With this option on players have a maximum of
   1½ seconds on the ground before they are automatically launched whether
   they bloody well like it or not.


                             - -  --^*^--  - -

How to fly
~~~~~~~~~~
1.  Pressing fire starts your biplane accelerating down the runway.

2.  Once you've picked up enough speed (when you're near the end of the
    runway), use the rotate left/right controls to take off.

3.  Slowing down too much stalls your engine, so go upwards at a shallow
    angle at first.  Once you've gained some altitude, powerdive vertically
    downwards to gain some speed.

4.  If you do stall, the only way to restart your engine is to point your
    biplane straight down, and wait until you've picked up enough speed.

   During the game, pressing P pauses and Q quits.


                             - -  --^*^--  - -

Features
~~~~~~~~
1.  Up to four players simultaneously.
2.  50 frames a second animation!
3.  Four channel sound.
4.  *EXTREME* addictiveness.
5.  Very simple graphics.
6.  The obligatory annoying cloud.
7.  Twinkling stars.
8.  ...and many other trivial things


                             - -  --^*^--  - -

Jargon
~~~~~~
   Dogfight, like any other specialized activity, has its own set of jargon.
Anyone considering themselves to be in the 'dogfight elite' needs to know
it, so here it is :

   Pea-Roller
   ----------
   A horizontal shot that is fired across the very bottom of the screen in
   order to kill players just taking off.  ("You pea-rolled my ass!")


   Extreme Manouver
   ----------------
   An 'extreme manouver' call is made by a player after a particularly
   superb piece of flying.  These calls are not to be made willy-nilly; they
   are reserved for the most spectacular of manouvers.


   Crazy Call
   ----------
   When things go mad up in the flyways, a 'crazy call' can be made.  They
   should only be made if all players are going at full speed, firing
   bullets all over the place, and this has been going on for about 5
   seconds.  (A typical example of a 'crazy call' is for one of the players
   to exclaim "It's mad up there!")


   Floater
   -------
   A reference to a plane that has stalled ("Red's a floater!"), or a
   reference to a person who seems to stall all the time.  ("Stu, you're
   such a floater!") It's also reference to a turd that can't be flushed
   down the toilet - but the less we talk about that the better.


   Gentlemans
   ----------
   When taking off, it is often customery to behave like a gentleman and not
   shoot at your runway partner straight away - This is known as a
   gentlemans agreement.  However, if you are low on lives then you may need
   to be underhand to ensure your place in the next game, in which case
   killing your runway partner as soon as you have both taken off is
   sometimes necessary.  The person shot as a result of your underhand
   action may exclaim "Oi!  Gentlemans!" to signify that they were unhappy
   with your display of antisocial flying skills.


   Etiquette
   ---------
   Many people can be crammed round a television set during a session of
   planes.  Often, the pilots in play will be the ones sitting opposite the
   TV, whilst onlookers and people in the queue will be sitting everywhere
   else.  If a player dies then they SHOULD NOT move position until the game
   is over - lest they block any other player(s) view.  If they do attempt
   to move places when a game is in progress then the other players may
   shout "ETIQUETTE" at them in order to stop them breaking this rule.


   Irrecoverable
   -------------
   A stall that is irrecoverable, ie :  The player has stalled at such a
   low angle and at such a low speed that their engine won't come on before
   they hit the ground.


   Outta The Clouds
   ----------------
   An exclaimation made by a player who has just shot another player by
   flying out from the clouds.


   Nine Minuter
   ------------
   Reference to a dogfight that has been going on for a considerable amount
   of time without any of the players involved losing a life.


   Flick-Stall
   -----------
   Not sure about this one - Jez just made it up.  In fact, no one else uses
   it.

   ------------
   · Should now run from WB on AGA machines.
   · Rewrote the audio routines again.
   · Fixed a stupid bug which sometimes left bullets on the screen after a

   ________________________________________________________________________
   All code up to this point was by Dan Rhodes.
   Code from here on is by Cryton / Apocalypse.
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 o Version 1.40
   ------------
   · Minor fix means it now should run from WB on AGA machines.

 o Version 1.50
   ------------
   · Many routines seriously optimised.
   · Fixed bug where if scrollwrap was off and plane was stalled, then if

     died.
   · After much consultation with The Big Four, the allowed time on ground
     before you're automatically launched was reduced.
   · Useless stats screen coded.  Gives number of stalls, time spent on
     ground, number of times you were forced to take-off and the total game
     length.

   · Flawless Victory message implemented.
   · Updated docs.

Known Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~
 o On machines with fastmem the bullet sound sometimes crashes.
 o If you take control of 2 planes with the same control method then
   sometimes when you fire a bullet, one of the planes 'catches up' with the
   bullet it fired, and appears to explode for no reason.  This ONLY ever
   happens when one of the planes is above the central shed, and is not a
   bug that I introduced.  (It sometimes occurs when one plane is being
   controled with one control method, but is quite rare.)
 o Sometimes on returning to WB, the last key pressed is continuely repeated
   in a WB text-entry box.
 o Doesn't work on an 68000.  (68020 instructions being used so I might
   release an A500 specific version if there's enough demand - email me if
   you want one!)

Stuff To Add
~~~~~~~~~~~~
   o Team Flying (eg :  Player 1 & 3 against 2 & 4, with 20 lives for each
     team)

   o Redefinable keys.

   o League tables and savable player statistics/options et al.

   o A Pigeon that flys around and when it gets caught up in your propellers
     you stall.

   o Remember Skidmarks where you can link 2 amigas together then put two
     TVs next to each other and have a huge screen?  Well...  8 player
     planes anyone...? :c)
