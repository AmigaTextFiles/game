                        Bratwurst v1.01 Beta

              Copyright © Three Little Elks, 1994, 1995.


1. Introduction.

Bratwurst is a game similar to GravityForce, Turbo Raketti, and Roketz. The
thing that makes Bratwurst unique is it's graphics. Instead of ordinary
bitmapped graphics, Bratwurst features 2 dimensional vector graphics. If
for example all players are close together, then the "camera" will zoom in
on them, and when the distance between them increases, the "camera" will
zoom out, to keep all players visible on screen. This teqnique allows four
players simultaneously, instead of just two. To play four players at once
you need two joysticks (at least) and a keyboard or two extra joysticks and
a four player adapter.

This is a beta release. We're not sure when the final version will be
released. We have made an editor to make ships and maps with, and we just
might relese it too, some time in the future.


2. Requirements.

- An AGA machine (A1200 or A4000)
- 68020 or faster processor. This is because of the vector graphics
  calculation. We recomend a computer with fastmem to make the game run
  smoothly. If you have a slower machine, you can turn off the grid and
  extra lines to improve speed (see the 'Options menu' section of this doc
  for details).
- About 600kB (600000 bytes) of free memory.


3. Keyboard Control.

Keyboard 1:  Up    - Arrow Up
             Down  - Arrow Down
             Left  - Arrow Left
             Right - Arrow Right
             Fire  - Right Shift

Keyboard 2:  Up    - Ctrl
             Down  - Left Alt
             Left  - Z (or Y on a german keyboard)
             Right - X
             Fire  - Left Shift


4. The Main menu.

Use a joystick in port two or one of the four player adapter's ports (if
you have one) or keybord to control the menus. In the main menu, there are
three options available.

- Start. This starts the game (surprise!)

- Options. Use the options menu to select numbers of players, and control
  method for each player. See the 'Options menu' section for details.

- Exit. You'll have to find out for yourself what this one does.


5. The Options menu.

In the options menu, pull left/right to change options, and press fire to
exit. Note: you can't use a joystick in port 1 (the mouse port) here.
The upper four lines is used to control number of players, and control
method for each player.This should be pretty self explanatory. The bottom
two lines need a little more explanation:

- Grid. This can be quite useful sometimes, when all players are close to
  eachother, so you can't see any walls. Then the grid will fade in (if
  it's turned on), so the players have some point of reference, so they
  know in which direction the're going, and at what speed.

- Extra lines. This can be used to make the ships a bit more 'clear'.
  Sometimes when the "camera" is zoomed out, it can be difficult to see in
  what direction the smaller ships are pointing. If this is the case, turn
  on 'extra lines', and it will be a little easier to make out the details
  of the ship.


6. Choosing ships and special weapons.

When you select 'Start' from the main menu, the game will go into ship
selection mode. Pull left/right to select ship, then press fire. Now you
can choose what special weapon to be used. What they do should be self
explanatory. When you have selected special weapon, you must select
which of the ship's weapon pods to fire the special weapons from. The
number of weapon pods vary from ship to ship. Some have as many as four,
while some others have just one. Which special weapons you can choose
between also varies from ship to ship.


7. Playing the game.

This shouldn't be too complicated. Push forward to fire normal cannon rounds,
and pull backwards to fire special weapon. What might need some explanation
is the status bar at the bottom of the screen. If you, for example, control
the blue ship, you should look at the indicators to the right of the blue
rectangle. The uppermost indicator is the energy indicator, the middle one
shows amount of standard cannon ammo left. The bottom indicator shows
amount of special weapon ammo left. The number to the right of these
indicators shows number of lives left.
