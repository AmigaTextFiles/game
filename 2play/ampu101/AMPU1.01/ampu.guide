@node about "About AMPU"

@{b}So what is AMPU?@{ub}

AMPU is yet another artillery game but it's lot more BETTER than
any other except worms of course!
Basicly it's a lot like worms but it has AGA Gfx and lots of
interesting weapons and tools.

cool things:
+ 25 cool items. (weapons, tools etc.)
+ you can make your own battlefields!
+ AGA (256 colors!)
+ Lots of animation.
+ 640*400 levels.
+ It's FREEE!

shit things:
- eats LOTS of mem
- needs FAST machine (68020 and accelerator needed)
@endnode


@node kone "What do i need?"

@{b}Requirements:@{ub}

* A1200 (68020) with some accelerator or faster machine.
* AGA chipset
* about 1 meg free fastmem
* about 1.7 megs free chipmem
* mathrans and diskfont libraries in libs:

I have A1200, Blizzard 1220/4MB (31.6Mhz) and the game runs fast enough.
Game should work in a standard A1200 with some fastmem but it can be slow.
(never tried without accelerator.... )
@endnode


@node help "Having problems?"

Problem:
Game loads and menu works, but when START GAME pressed game fucks up.

Solution: You don't have enough chipmem available.
If you use wb then close other programs and take backround piccys
etc. off.


Problem:
Game won't load.

Hint: Check that all required libs are available.
      Do you have enough memory??


Problem:
Game is slow.

Solution: buy faster machine :)
@endnode

@{b}Game Controls@{ub}
@{b}-------------@{ub}

The game is controlled via mouse and keyboard.

mouse              -> scroll view
left mouse button  -> target select (teleport,nuke,team placing)
right mouse button -> weapons menu

del                -> weapons menu
help               -> shows names & energy (help exits)
arrows             -> aim, move humanoid, change weapon in weapons menu
return             -> jump, pick a weapon (in toolsmenu)
spacebar           -> use item, choose power (bazookas, grenades etc.)
esc                -> abort game
n                  -> end turn



Basic in game info:

When you see green Z rotating in upper-right corner it means
that you'r in Zombie MODE. (and Zombie MODE means that you are NOT
allowed to do anything except move around.) (press n to end your turn)
@endnode

@node dev "Technical..."

developing tools:
- Blitz II (who said that basic sucks?)
- Devpack (best assembler around)
- Brilliance
- Octamed pro

About the code:
The code is 95% Basic & 5% assembler and it's not so fast as it could be.
(Blitz is pretty fast except the variable handling)

This game requires a fast machine and lots of mem.
First reason is the colours (256!) as blitting is slower
and 256 colour bitmap eats much more mem than 32 colour bitmap.
Second reason is that i have made this game using A1200 with
accelerator and i had no chance to test it on a slower machine.

@node greetz "Thanks to...."

Thanks goes to:

Team 17 - for making Worms (It's THE BEST game ever, and i hope you do WormsII)

Acid software - for making Blitz II

Hellsky & others - for ideas (good & bad)

Greetings goes to:

@node items "game items and how to use'em..."

There are so many tools & weapons and i might change them later,
so i can't write perfect instructions to all tools. sorry, you
just have to trie them out and learn :)    (was that bad english??)

but here are a few tips:
------------------------

* bazooka, homer, grenade, supball, freezer & bigchina uses the
  powerbar.  (hold down space and release (just like in worms).)

* jetpack is activated using space. use arrowkeys to control it.
  if you press down arrow it shuts down.

* molebomb is also controlled via arrowkeys.

* homing missile guides to a nearest person when it starts to fall.

* supball explodes when spacebar pressed. It also fragments into
  four small peaces.

* Nuke can't be used at the 2 first turns.
@endnode

@node levels "how to make your own levels"

to draw a level you need some drawing program like
deluxepaint or brilliance.

short instructions:
-------------------
Load tasomuotti.iff or some other level from levels/ directory
in your drawing program.
you have to use almost same palette as in piccy or game palette fucks up.

page size is 640*500, and if you save larger size piccy... game fucks up.
(so don't do that... )

also leave 50 pixels empty space up and down in image.
(like in tasomuotti.iff, which should be in levels/ dir)

colours:
-------------
special colours:
colour number 1 is a backround colour (air)
colour number 224 is slime.

colours 160-223 are colours that you can change as you like...

don't use colours 0,2 or 3 (pixel explosion routine fucks up with them)

other tips:
-----------
save your level in levels/ dir with .lev extension.
like > my_level.lev <

then just start the game & choose your level!!!
