Original Light Cycles V1.00 Levels - All designed by Chris Underwood

These levels are all converted from the first Light Cycles that I wrote.
Here you have 5 shields and 40 speed ups. This is a simple but
effective level. Try to trap opponants against the butresses on the walls.
This level is suitable for all four players.
