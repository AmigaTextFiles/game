                     CRUSH - Special Edition V0.9
                     ----------------------------
                     
IMPORTANT : When playing from disk, remove write protection, otherwise 
CRUSH will crash !!     
If CRUSH crashes anyway, just reboot and try again - CRUSH is not the
most stable program ever written... but the most cool one :-)
ATTENTION : If CRUSH crashes while saving edited levels, the level-files
may become unreadable. So keep a backuped levelfile (the file LEVELS in
the s-directory of the CRUSH disk), so you can replace the file, if it
is needed. This does not appear very often, just to be sure... ;)

ABOUT CRUSH

    CRUSH is not totaly finished, so there does not exist a manual and it
  has only German on-screen-texts. But I think it is not too difficult 
  to handle, so you will manage it - just watch the demo-mode to learn
  about it...
  
  Why is CRUSH so kewl ?
  
  - CRUSH is written 100% in Assembler.... so it's fast as hell even on 
    a simple A500
  - There are more than 50 Levels coming with CRUSH and there are lots of
    different ways to play them. 
    But CRUSH can handle up to 65534 levels, so you can create your own
    worlds using the simple level-editor
  - In CRUSH you can show the snaky side of your soul... it's the only way
    to win...
  - You'll have lots of fun. Lot's of times. And you'll have a great game
    NOT released on shitty Wind0ws PCs... So go and catch a PC user and
    play CRUSH with (better: against) him ( and WIN !!) 
   
  What is not so kewl about CRUSH ?
  
  - There are some bugs, so e.g. it's not possible to chancel a match.
    And the game likes to crash sometimes. So please send NO bug reports,
    because the development of CRUSH stopped years ago. If YOU want to
    continue our work or to fix bugs, just contact us.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
GAMEPLAY

  CRUSH is a two-player-ONLY game ! That was the reason, why no software-
  company wanted to publish it some years ago, so now we release it as
  freeware.  
  
  To all Germans: Die Deutsche Anleitung befindet sich in Form von on-
  screen-Hilfstexten im Spiel unter INFORMATIONEN
  
  You can start the game by pressing F5 without any further settings.
  This way, the game starts in DUELL-mode: Two players, the one who 
  wins 8 matches first is the winner.
  If you want to change some options, select EINSTELLUNGEN:
  
  First you have to enter the names of the players. By pressing numbers,
  you enter the Home-level (HEIM) of a player (not needed). This means,
  if you select LEVELS:HEIM in the EINSTELLUNGEN-screen, the game starts
  with this level. This way each player can play his favourite level.
  
  Press <Ecs> to go on when finished.
  
  Next you enter a screen where you can see, who's playing next. This is 
  less interesting in duel-mode, but very important in group- or team-
  mode. You have also the chance to change controls (joy0 <-> joy1).
   
  IMPORTANT:   To start the game, both players have to press fire !!
               This is also the ONLY way to continue a paused game.
               To pause a game, press <p>.
               
  When starting the game, both players appear.
  The aim is very simple : Just destroy the other one without being 
  destroyed yourself. The common way is to push a stone on him - CRUSH,
  he's losing one life. For pushing a stone, just press fire.
  But be careful : There are some arrow-fields which change the direction
  of the stones and even of you ! And if a stone hit's another this on
  starts to move itself etc. ... so think twice ;-)

  But there are some funny gimmicks to make the gameplay MORE important
  ... ;-)

 -There is dynamite : Collecting it, the next time you press fire, you 
  throw it away. This way you can break stones, walls, and.... your
  opponent. Only swamp can stop it...
  
 -Bombs : Treat them like stones and push them via fire. They'll move
  until they hit something .... BOOM ! Only swamp can stop them...
 
 -Shild : Get it, and your oppenent can't shoot for a while...
 
 -Force-Drink : Now you are a little Arnold for a while : You cannot
  only move one stone, you can move rows of stones !!
  
 -Ice : Very ugly thing: Freezes opponent for a little time...
 
 -Swamp : Everything disappears when falling into swamp except of the
  players themselves - they can cross it without any problems.
  
 -Magic Stones : They are very colourful.... and very nasty: They use
  to bend of when crossing one coordinate of a player. So be careful !
  
 -Arrow-fields : Everything crossing them (except of Magic Srones) is
  chaning direction the way the arrow shows the object hits first. 
  Understood ? No ? 
  
  After some time, objects start to appear on the screen. That could be
  simple stones or bonus-points, but also nice stuff... So every single
  match will become different... and you'll never know what'll happen
  next.
  
  Just wait and watch the demo-mode to see how to play CRUSH. 
  
  Controls : - JOY0 and JOY1 to guide the figurines
             - <Esc> to pause game (BOTH players have to press fire
               to continue game)

  
Some hints to the EINSTELLUNGEN (=Options) menue :

<1> Modus: CRUSH can also be played in a kind of league (LIGA) or groupe
           (GRUPPE) mode. It would be too difficult to explain them all
           .... just try ! Default is "duel" (2 players)

<2> Anzahl : In the duel-mode, the number of players is limited to 2. In
             the group/team-mode there are different numbers of players
             selectabel. Default is 2.
         
<3> Finalduel : Here you can select the numbers of matches that have to
                be won to win the game (5-10). There exist also different
                highscore-tables for the different numbers of matches.
                Default is 8.
                
<5> Rueckspiele : Here you can select if you wish to have a revenge-game
                  with exchanged positions. Default is "nein" (=no)
                  
<6> Levelauswahl :                                   

  If you select LEVELS : ALLE, all levels will be played, starting with
  Level 1. If a game is finished and the next is started, you'll continue
  with the next level. 
  If you select LEVELS : +ZUF, after finishing a level, the number of 
  the next level will be increased by a random number. 
  If you select LEVELS : IRGD, levels will be chosen randomly.
  
 
<7> ZUFGEN EINSATZ: frueh - means, that after a short time objects start
                            to appear randomly
                    spaet - means, that after a longer time objects start
                            to appear randomly
                          
<8> Spielstart : Start game                          
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
LEVEL-EDITOR

  There are 56 Levels coming along with CRUSH, which will be enough for
  many CRUSH-sessions. But if you want to create your own levels...
  ...no problem !
  
  Using the editor is very simple: You may edit an existing level by
  entering it's number (1-57) and then pressing "l" to load it.
  But what's even more important, you may create new levels by entering
  any higher number (58-...).
  Now you can move around your character and place an object by pressing
  fire. Choose object with cursor-keys. Both players can design a level
  simultaneously !! So have fun ! 
  Press "t" to test level before saving it. Press "s" to save level. Press
  "x" to exit editor. 
  
  To all germans: Im Editor <HELP> fuer Hilfe druecken.
  
  Important : When playing CRUSH from disk, remove write-protection,
  otherwise CRUSH will crash when saving levels or highscores.
  
  If you have designed some cool levels, please send them to me, because
  I'm sad of playing my own ones again and again. This way I perhaps will
  release new official level-files including also your ones - mentioning 
  your name, of course :-)
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
REQUIREMENTS

  CRUSH is supposed to work on ANY Amiga with at least 1 MB of RAM. 
  In fact it has been tested on:
  
  Amiga 500, Kick 1.2, 1 MB
  Amiga 1200/020/28Mhz Kick 3.1, 5 MB
  Amiga 2000, Kick 1.3 5 MB
  Amiga 2000/030/25 Kick 3.1 5 MB 
  Amiga 4000/040/25 Kick 3.1 22 MB
  
HOW TO INSTALL

  Just unpack CRUSH.dms using the packer DMS, which can be found on Aminet
  or on nearly evry other shareware-compilation.
     
  Now just reboot your Amiga and CRUSH will start.
  
  You can also try to install it to your Harddisk, but CRSUH does not work
  on all systems from HD (don't forget the assign... look in the CRUSH
  startup-sequence).
  CRUSH is loaded fast, so there's no need to install it on HD.

LAST WORDS

  We are not going to continue working on CRUSH. The reason is easy : Some
  years ago we did not find a publisher for CRUSH, then we had no time to
  improve the game and today the code is not up to date anymore.
  
  Nevertheless, I think CRUSH is very funny to play and these days there
  are very few games being released for the Amiga, so I decided to publish
  CRUSH for all those Amiga fans left ! It also was hard work to do that
  game, so why keeping it closed for all days ? These days, games get more
  complex day by day, so I think CRUSH is a very refreshing alternative,
  a little bit WORMS-like, even if the presentation is not state of the art.
  
  Just play it: Perhaps you'll get a CRUSH fan too :)
  
  By the way: There is also a version available for the Schneider CPC !!
  No joke !! Even if there is no Level-Editor and there are less items,
  the CPC-Version is quite funny. So if you are interested in it, just
  contact me by e-mail.
   
  Now go and have some REAL fun !!!
