NOTICE          I'm not a great fan of shareware, but when programs
                take as much time and effort as Passages did, I see
                why other programmers put fees on their work.  This
                means that I am charging a fee for Passages if you
                like and are going to use it, but this fee is small
                enough, I feel, to not break anyone's bank balance
                or do them out of anything more than a couple of 
                pints down the local.

SHAREWARE       So the fee is fixed at 3.00 UK pounds, or the
                equivalent of 3.50 UK pounds in any other currency.
                If you so happen to live in any remote country such
                the desolate wastelands of outer Rebosia or the frozen
                Trebosk, or anywhere where you feel I would have
                trouble in changing your currency into mine (ie Iraq),
                then please obtain one of the larger currencies,
                American dollars etc. are fine.

                In order to encourage you to register, the program
                has a number of handicaps which are released when
                you receive your keyfile.  The largest of these is
                that you cannot exit from the program, nor multi-task
                so it is vital that you save important data before
                running Passages.  This also means that you will have
                to reset before sending your moves to the other
                player, but please bare with it and give the game a
                chance (and the cat a saucer of milk).

                Please send registration fees to the address at the
                end of this documentation.

BRIEF           I developed the idea for the game, Passages, when I was
                sitting around trying to think of an idea for a game.
                I'd always had trouble programming computer opponents
                with IQs which weren't in the negatives so I decided
                to write a two player game.  The slight flaw in this
                plan was that I didn't have anyone who looked remotely
                like a second player, nor anyone who could pose as a
                second player - even on a part time basis.
                  Okay, so I had a dog who could have been a second
                player except for the fact that he had no idea what
                a joystick was and simply fondled the spherical end
                in his jaws when I presented it to him.  Consequently,
                I now have a a joystick with no 'stick' and as for the
                dog...that's another story.  Well, actually, that's
                this story.
                  After the experience, my poodle became a little
                lazy, he used to be a happy go lucky kind of poodle
                but the very next day he refused to go for a walk,
                usually his favourite event.  What was even more
                surprising, and a little worrying too, was that he
                also refused point blank to bend his legs.
                  With a little persuasion I managed to get my
                poodle, Winnie, to go for a short walk but his
                insistance on keeping his legs completely straight
                made the walk which was usually quite enjoyable into
                an ordeal.  After two hours of dragging Winnie around
                the woods I realised that he just wasn't in the mood
                and so we retired home...and this is where things took
                a turn for the worse.  Not only had Winnie taken a vow
                to never again bend his legs, he had also stopped eating
                and drinking - I presumed he just wanted to punish me
                for not letting him play with my computer for as long
                as I'd first promised, he did like his revenge did old
                Winnie.
                  At this point I was getting worried about poor
                Winnie so I had him neutered, at the suggestion of the
                vet and to the results of a balot I held on his
                behalf at the local chippy..  Unfortunately, it
                was a traumatic process which solved nothing.
                  When I saw the vet three months after his
                neuturing, he made a huge discovery.  He found out
                that Winnie hadn't just become incredibly lazy, nor
                had he simply become stuborn, in fact he had been dead
                all along - he had simultaneously electrocuted himself
                and choked on a length of red plastic with a small
                sphere on the end.

PASSAGES        Passages is a game like none other that I have any
                knowledge of (except one, but I wrote that so it
                doesn't count).  It is a game which is played by
                passing a single file between you and your opponent.
                These files store details of the current state of
                the game and so by giving the opponent information as
                to what you've done during your turn they can play on
                and try to undo what you've done, and do a little of
                their own - for you to undo yourself.
                  The game is viewed from above so all you see is your
                little bloke's head and feet sticking out the front.
                I could have arranged it so he looked up at you whilst
                you were playing but then he wouldn't get any fun, so
                I decided against that.
                  The idea is to move your character around the
                passages in order to collect gold and deposit in one
                of the banks of your own colour, using doors to help
                prevent the other player from accessing particular
                passageways.

SETTING UP      Copy the Passages directory to a suitable place on
                the disk it is to be run from.  Create an assign
                to this directory called 'Passages:'.  Failing to
                do this will result in you not being able to start
                a game and you will be unsure as to where the saved
                files will be put.  When I tested this, my files
                ended up on an Airbus 3000 bound for Los Angeles, much
                to the amusement of the pilot whose onboard computer
                they ended up in.

                        1> Assign Passages: DH1:Games/Passages

                The above line will assign 'Passages:' to a the
                'Passages' directory in the 'Games' directory on the
                DH1: partition of the user's hard disk, but you knew
                that already...

RUNNING         Passages can be run from the CLI like any other CLI
PASSAGES        program.

                        1> Passages

                  Passages can also be run from Workbench using the
                icon supplied, or you can make your own and use that.
                  Upon loading Passages, a screen will appear giving
                details of the revision of the game.
                  If a keyfile is found, information will be shown
                about the registratee.  If it isn't found, there
                will be a time delay as shown by a timer.
                  To stop the screen of registration information from
                disappearing, hold the left mouse button until you
                are done.

MAIN MENU       Pressing fire when instructed to do so by the ever
                helpful joystick will result in the appearance of
                silver breadstick on the left of the screen.  From
                here you can start a new game, continue an old game,
                practice or, in the registered version, exit.
                  For those of you without a joystick, who do not like
                using joysticks or who have a dead poodle, the cursor
                keys and return will kinda mimick the joystick as best
                they can, however, they are nowhere near as good, and
                you will find it hard to control the character.

NEW GAME        When selecting this either the breadstick will
                show 'Player One' or a hole in time will open up and
                you will be turned into a vacuum cleaner.
                  Player one is the red player who starts, in red drag
                in the bottom, left hand corner.  Player two, blue
                starts in the top, right corner and wears a rather
                expensive blue suit with grey cycling helmet.
                  Once you've selected your player, you will have to
                select a level.  The ones available are from 000 to
                015 although extra levels will possibly be released in
                the future, along with a level editor (at no extra
                registration fee).  The files to these are found in
                'Passages:levels'.
                  Use backspace, or the arrow keys and delete, and
                change the code to the level you want.  The fun then
                begins.

CONTINUE GAME   Upon receiving the 'input' file from the other player,
                select this option and the file will be loaded from
                'Passages:'.  You may then take your turn.
                  For those who want to know, the file is called
                'Passages.output' when it leaves a machine, and is
                renamed to 'Passages.input' when it arrives.

PRACTICE        Selecting this option lets you get the feel of the
                game without actually having to have a friend ready to
                play - it's therefore ideal for those who haven't any
                friends.
                  It's also ideal for those who have never played before
                and simply want to know what everything does.

LEAVE PASSAGES  This option exits completely from the game.  This
                option also makes the first sentance of PLAYING
                PASSAGES incorrect, so just ignore that bit.

PLAYING         No matter which of the options above seleted, you will
PASSAGES        be eventually presented with the play arena.  A green
                box surrounds the actual area where your character can
                move within.  The fact that it's green has no
                relevance to any part of the game and the reason for
                it being so is a mystery to me which is peculiar since
                I chose the colour scheme.
                  A length of tunnel will also be visible.  This is
                what your player can see.  Facing him in other
                directions show you that passage up until his sight
                is hindered by a large rock surface.  A wall springs
                to mind as a handy example of a large rock surface.
                  To the right of the arena are the amount of money
                you have stashed away, whether you are holding gold,
                and your opponent's money.
                  On occasion you may be lucky enough to come across
                some gold.

ICONS           The icons along the top of the screen above the
                playing arena represent (and are labelled as)
                the function keys:

                  F1  gold/up arrow     PICK UP GOLD
                  F2  gold/down arrow   DROP GOLD

                  P   paws              PAUSE

TURNING AND     Turning and moving are two different things.  Turning
MOVING          about a point requires movement about two planes
                (unless you happen to be a point particle which, in
                theory, has no dimensions whatsoever and so may turn
                by any degree in any direction without actually moving
                in any plane), whereas moving from one place to
                another in a straight line only requires movement
                in one dimension (and for all you dimensionless points
                out there, the same would go for you).
                  Just a point, but if space is curved, like it is
                supposed to be, wouldn't all the planets roll off?
                  Turning is achieved by moving the joystick in a
                new direction, your character will face the desired
                way, or at least the way in which you pushed the
                joystick.  Moving is acomplished by pushing the
                joystick (or 'joy' if your dog also bit the stick
                off it) in the direction you character is already
                facing.

HITTING WALLS   Hitting walls is not desirable and although will not
                affect the performance of your character, is hardly
                fair and will almost certainly put him in a bad mood.

PARACETAMOL     Newtons 4th law: Walking into walls may inspire
                headaches.

GOLD            Gold is the reason for life as far as red or blue
                overhead viewed computer sprites go.  Gold, unlike the
                passageways, can only be seen whilst you are actually
                facing it.  Walking over it will render it out of
                sight but will NOT pick it up.  Turn around and it's
                still there.  Well if you walk over a coin in the
                street it doesn't magically appear in your pocket.
                Now, chewing gum...
                  To pick up gold, move on top of it and press either
                fire on the joystick, F1 or Return.  Only one piece of
                gold can be carried at a time and must be deposited
                into a bank before it will affect your bank balance or
                another piece can be picked up - it's heavy you see.
                  When you are carrying gold, 'gold held' will be
                displayed to the right of the arena.  This is to let
                you know that your character is holding gold.
                  Gold can be dropped by moving to a square not
                already occupied by gold and pressing F2.  Keep it
                behind doors if you don't want your opponent to get
                it.  Again this will not change the amount of money
                you have, to do that you have to visit the bank.
                  It is essential to remember that gold you fail
                to pick up will still be present on your oppponent's
                go.

BANKS           These are a piece of straight vertical or horizontal
                passageway with either a red or blue light in each
                corner.  Look carefully for them.
                  When carrying gold, move into the bank and press
                fire or F5.  A shutter will close you in (for
                security), your gold will be deposited and the shutter
                will open again.  If a piece of gold just so happens
                to be lying in the centre of a bank, you can still
                pick it up with fire or F1.  Fire will automatically
                pick it up and deposit it.  F1 will simply pick it up.
                This is called 'robbing a bank'.
                  Make sure that you visit the correct colour bank
                otherwise not a lot happens.

ROCK            Corners and junctions are always soft rock.  Straight
                pieces of passageway may be soft or hard.  The hard
                rock contains less cracks than soft rock (compare the
                passageways with junctions to find its type).  The
                difference between the rocks is that soft rock,
                straight passageway is the only rock that can be
                damaged by dynamite.  Hard rock is too hard to build
                doors on - it also requires larger doses of paracetamol
                if you walk into it.  See PARACETAMOL. 

DOORS           Your own doors will not affect you in any way but will
                stop your opponent's movement and sight.  The reverse
                is also true.  Doors can be placed on any straight
                piece of soft rock passageway by moving onto a sqaure
                adjacent to it, facing it and pressing F6.  If you have
                enough money, and the passageway is suitable, the door
                will be built and $4 will be deducted from your
                balance.
                  Doors can only be built on straight pieces of
                passageway which do not already contain a door, which
                are level (they cannot be built on craters) and which
                are soft rock.  
                  Remember, a door will be built on a sqaure which you
                FACE, not which you are actually ON.
                  Make sure that you are facing the correct way; you
                are facing soft rock; you have enough money.

DYNAMITE        Dynamiting is similar to door building.  Only straight
                passageway can be blown up (the game prevents you from
                committing hari-kari by deystroying a junction).
                  There are two types of dynamiting: passageway and
                doors.  Blowing a hole in a piece of passageway will
                cost you $3 and will mean the other player (and you)
                will have to level the ground before a door can be
                built, it does not restrict movement nor sight though.
                  Blowing up doors will remove the door and leave a
                crater, but as more dynamite is required, it will
                fetch you back $4 - rip off, isn't it?
                  To dynamite, face the square to be blown up and hit
                F7.

LEVELLING       To remove a crater so that you can build a door, you
                can face the square and press F8.  The crater will be
                removed and your balance will go down by $2.

TIME            As if all that doesn't sound hard enough, you only get
                two minutes to make your mark, collect as much gold as
                possible and save it away either in banks, or by
                keeping it (relatively) safe in blocked (and locked)
                off pieces of passageway where you can sort it out
                next time (providing it hasn't gone).

PAUSING         Pause at any time by pressing P.  Press anything when
                you want to restart.

MULTI-TASKING   Left Amiga-P will take you back to the world of
                Intuition.  The game will automatically be paused.
                Press the same again to come back.  This won't work
                without the keyfile.

EXIT            To save going back to the menu, you can quit with
                CONTROL-C, again you must be registered.

PREMATURE       To end your turn before you run out of time, you can
END OF TURN     press F10 or ESCAPE.  F10 will save the game if you
                are not in 'practice mode' and will result in the same
                as the clock running out.  ESCAPE will abort the save
                and so in 'practice', the two are no different.
                  F10 will simply speed up the clock, hold it down
                until the time runs out.

END OF TURN     If you are simply practicing, you will be returned to
IN PRACTICE     the menu when your turn has ended.

END OF TURN     When the time is up or you have had enough, a blank
REAL            screen will appear...well, it won't 'appear' as such:
                an absence of light can't 'appear', but the previous
                screen will disappear to give the 'illusion' of a
                blank screen appearing.
                  A disk icon will then appear and the 'keep' file and
                'output' file will be saved to your 'Passages:' assign.
                  The output file is called 'Passages.output' and will
                be loaded as an input file by the other player.
                  Renaming of the 'output' file to the 'input' file
                is done automatically by the scripts (see below) or
                can be done manually if you are communicating some
                other way ie. telepathically, via diskette etc.

                In more simple terms:

                  When your go ends the 'output' file is made (the
                  last) is backed up.

                  The 'output' file is sent to the other player.

                  The other player renames the 'output' file to an
                  'input' file (all done by script).

                  The other player plays on.

BACK-UP         Passages will create backups of the file before
                overwriting it at the end of turn point, this is
                called: 'Passages.output.bak'.

SPOT            Included are two scripts for use with Spot (auth: Nico
                François).  'Passages.EXPORT.spot' will send an
                'output' file.  Go to the message area you wish to
                send it in (you should obtain permission if this isn't
                a netmail area) and run the script (see Spot
                documentation if you are unsure how to do this).
                  The 'output' file will be converted into a message
                and you will simply have to supply details of who to
                send it to.
                  The 'Passages.IMPORT.spot' script will take a
                message which contains the Passages data and convert
                it into an 'input' file so that you can simply select
                'continue game' and play on.

SO              I hope you enjoy playing Passages and have the
                patience to keep reseting your machine to see what
                it's like. :-)

NOTICE          Some programs such as commodities which use sound
                whilst Passages is running may screw up the sound in
                Passages (samples might start repeating).
