 SCENARIO

 3716 A.D.

 The Earth Corps destroyer goes into orbit around Axeeces IV in the Caragula
 Galaxy. It's a mere peanut in comparison with the huge planet. But the ship
 is here to attack it, and attack is what it will do. Powering up the Veitch
 Beam, it readies itself for the explosion which will shortly follow.

    "RED ALERT! RED ALERT! RED ALERT!" wails the siren in the main control
 centre on Axeeces IV. "Scramble all fighters, we must defeat them!", yelled
 Commander Rowland.

 The Axeeces Fleet battle cruiser launches into space, and ejects a fighter
 ready to attack the destroyer. Earth Corps fighters are everywhere, and the
 attack begins...

 Section 1: SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

 To run Shoot-Out 2, you need the following hardware/software.

  * An Amiga running Workbench 1.3 or above. If there are any A1000 owners
    out there with WB 1.0 or whatever, UPGRADE, UPGRADE!

  * 2 joysticks.

  * 2 creatures (hands are a necessary requirement, as are eyes)

  * At least 800K of free Chip RAM. Gfx files are not loaded into Fast RAM
    and neither are sfx, so you need this amount.

 Section 2: MAIN MENU and OPTIONS MENU

 The Main Menu comprises of 5 options. They are listed below. To select
 an option, simply press the number on the keyboard next to the option name.

   1: START GAME
      This is fairly obvious. It begins the battle.

   2: GAME OPTIONS
      Displays the (rather short) game options menu.

   3: INSTRUCTIONS
      Displays the document you are reading now.

   4: CREDITS
      Displays a credits screen showing who are responsible for this game.

   0: EXIT GAME
      Quits to Workbench if Y is pressed after the question stops moving.
      If N is pressed, then you return to the main menu.

 The Game Options menu is made up of 5 options.


   1: BONUS ICONS
      Toggles the Bonus Icons feature ON and OFF. See Section 3.1 for info.

   2: REFLECTORS
      Toggles the Reflector ON and OFF. The Reflector stops lasers in their
      tracks, so try to avoid them.

   3: MOTHERSHIPS
      Motherships is a new feature to Shoot Out. When you have lost all of
      your five fighters, you are given a mothership (If they are on). This
      is capable of sustaining 11 hits from a fighter, or 6 from an enemy
      mothership. The motherships are too large for Bonus Icons to take
      effect, so mothership lasers pass straight through them. Fighter
      lasers take one piece of armour away for every hit. These take two.

   4: SOUND MODE
      Select between MUSIC, SFX or BOTH.

   0: PREVIOUS MENU
      Takes you back to the Main Options menu.

 Section 3: THE GAME

 The idea behind Shoot Out 2 is to destroy your enemy until they run out of
 lives. This task is made more difficult because they are trying to do the
 same to you. At your (and their) disposal is a high-impact laser beam, 
 which depletes your opponent's shield until they have no more, then you 
 just thwack another laserbolt into their ship and KABOOM!.. no more enemy.
 Both your motherships have decided to help you along by ejecting special
 weapons into the battle zone. These are described in detail above. However,
 your enemy mothership has ejected Death Bolts (D) into the zone and they 
 destroy you upon impact, regardless of how much armour you have. When your 
 ship has no armour left it will be destroyed by the next impact it sustains. Your
 ship only has room for five armour energizers, you initially start off with
 one energizer fitted, but you can increase this by collecting (shooting) 
 the Armour Energizer icon (A). Every subsequent ship you gain has no armour
 fitted, so collect some fast! There only five hangars on your mothership, 
 so try not to lose too many craft.

 Section 3.1: BONUS ICONS

 The available bonus icons in Shoot Out 2 are as follows:-

 A with a blue background          - Add one armour point to your ship
 L with a blue background          - Extra life.
 D with a blue background          - Self Destruct Token
 I with a blue background          - Invisibility *
 F with a blue background          - Freeze Ray **
 Up arrow with a blue background   - Speed Up
 Down arrow with a blue background - Slow Down
 A with a red background           - Lose all armour points
 L with a red background           - Lose all fighters.

 The first person to shoot the icon gets the power up. Motherships cannot
 collect bonus icons.

   * Invisibility only lasts until you get shot, or someone explodes.

  ** Freeze Ray freezes the other craft. It lasts until the frozen craft is
     hit by a laser. Frozen craft can still shoot, so watch out!

 Section 4: KNOWN BUGS

 -(P) The SFX mode plays sounds over and over with out stopping, like when 
      the GO! symbol appears, the sound is heard as GO! GO! GO! and so on.

 -(S) There is no way round this but to reboot your machine. This is a bug
      in AMOS Professional, not Shoot-Out 2.


 -(P) When both players are shot simultaneously, only one player dies.

 -(S) This is not a bug. The computer decides which player loses armour or
      dies, based on who fired the missile first, to the nearest hundredth
      of a second. Now you know!

 P.S. SORRY FOR THE ANNOYING FLICKERING WHEN THE SPRITES MOVE TO THE TOP OF
      THE PLAYING AREA, IF ANYONE KNOWS HOW TO FIX IT, LET ME KNOW!!!
