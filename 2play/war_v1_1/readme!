you. There are two power-ups available in the game. The shield icon restores
a random ammount of your shields energy while the power icon increases your
tanks selected weapon ammo supply. The four green bars next to your tanks
window show how much ammo you have.

Weapons
-------

Weapon 1 - Normal Shot
Weapon 2 - Mines (Lay them in front of the other tanks!)
Weapon 3 - High energy shot (Easier to hit other players)
Weapon 4 - Rebounding bullets (Who will it hit? You!?)

Future Software
---------------

This is my first game for the Amiga written in Blitz ][
I am in the process of writing a "Lords of Chaos" clone for the Amiga during
1997. A early version of the game will be released before Christmas'97.

"Lords of Chaos" was an old C64 game that made an apperance on the Amiga
years ago. There is already a clone of this classic game out in the public
domain called Fantasy Forces, but I find this to be too limited in terms of
strategy. I hope to improve on both the afore mentioned titles.


If you have any suggestions for this game, please contact me.
