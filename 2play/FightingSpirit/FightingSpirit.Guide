@{fg text}


  You don't need any PeeCee, any Mac, only an AMIGA with a minimun of 1 meg
of CHIP. 
The Way Of The Fighting Spirit runs on every OS without problems. 
Be sure that your AMIGA is built around a 680X0 processor and that will be
OK ;-)

Note that is better when you dispose of 2 or more meg of FAST memory because 
you can configure this game to load all files into memory before playing to 
avoid disc access, see @{" Tool Type and Command Line " LINK "gtt"} for more
details ...
@{u}
Rem :@{uu} Mathtrans.library is needed in your libs: path.

      For OS 1.3, the file Ram-Handler is needed in your l: path if you use
      the tool type RAM=YES.

ticipants (>=3) and their names. Enter @{i}'amiga1'@{ui} or @{i}'amiga2'@{ui} up to @{i}'amiga9'@{ui}

be kept secret ! Click Begin to start !

isn't connected. Press @{fg fill}ESC@{fg text} to leave to Workbench.

configuration : @{fg shine}A500+ with 9 Meg, a MTEC 68020/68881 and an IDE HD540@{fg text}.
