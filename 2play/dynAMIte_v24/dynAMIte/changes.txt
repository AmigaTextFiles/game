07.01.2005 V2.4
---------------
o dynAMIteAI.library for MorphOS updated to version 3.269

o Increased limit of lasers to 10 per map. Lasers exceeding 10 will get replaced by empty blocks.

o On darkness window borders were overdraw, hopefully fixed this.

o Changed the look of dynAMIteMapLab a bit.

o Fixed a problem with unselectable blocks in dynAMIteMapLab.

o Catalogs: Changed MSG_KEY_ACTION_ABOMB (which was obsolete) to MSG_KEY_ACTION_RANDOMBUBBLE.

o Random bubbles can now also be used from the keyboard. See Menu -> Key mappings.

o Added GoldenHeart bonus which resurrects all players of all teams when teammode is active.

o Fixed a bug in dynamitenet.lib that could have cause havoc when DServer was quit.

28.03.2003 V2.3
---------------
o Added a limit of 5 lasers per map. Lasers exceeding 5 will get removed.

o Powerups won't get removed from a map anylonger on map creation time when
  they are disabled.

o Fixed a bug with WB tooltype/shell arg.

o Bells and Whistles auto-switch-off didn't work as expected. Fixed.

o It's now possible to specify the slot where to load and kick bots.
  /loadbot <slotnumber> and /kickbot <slotnumber>, if slotnumber is omitted
  the server will decide which slot to use.

o Wormholes didn't get redrawn if "Skip Bonusanim" was enabled. Fixed.

o Added /online command to client.  This command shows the online times of
  all users currently online.

o DServer did not count a win if there were more than one human players
  when the game started but only one left (due to logoff of the others), when
  the game ended. Fixed.

o If Dserver finds a backup of player and teams data at startup that is
  bigger than the original file, it will ask now to load the backup.

o If all 8 slots in DServer were occupied by players and one tried to
  team/unteam some weird numbers were shown for needed players to change the
  teammode.  Fixed.

o Added a short delay until it is possible to drop a heart when the player
  is dead.

o dynAMIte will now switch off all bells and whistles if average fps drop
  below 10 frames.  Bells and whistles gets reenabled when the fps gets
  back to normal.

o Fixed a masking bug in dynAMIteGFX.library that left some pixels behind
  the flame length/bomb indicator that appears at the start of each map on
  certain circumstances.

o Added a switch to GETSCORE ARexx command of DServer to make it possible
  to also get team-scores. New template is now GETSCORE NUM/N,TEAM/S

o The moving dots didn't get redrawn properly when the gui was rebuild.
  Fixed.

o Finally was able to reproduce problems with keyboard controls that
  received a fix immediately.

01.11.2002 V2.2a
----------------
o Wrote a small tool to correct corrupted scores caused by DServer of 2.2.
  Please read the provided documentation carefully.

o Added some unnecessary graphical stuff to dynAMIte.

o Stripped some unnecessary code from dynAMIteNET.library.

o Added a button to DServer to remove maps.  Removed maps will not be
  simply deleted but are moved to PROGDIR:maps/.inactive/

o Fixed an enforcerhit when /score was called with a number out of range.

o Highscores got corrupted on certain circumstances. Fixed.

o /unteam and /team didn't work as expected sometimes. Fixed.

o Requesters regarding user editing are now centered to users window.

o It's now possible to also delete teams.

o Changed keyboard code a bit.

o DServer now ends itself if the tcp/ip stack gets removed.

o Fixed a bug that caused enforcerhits when a game was started.

o Logoff message was displayed twice. Fixed.

o Bots kept moving when one picked up a stop item. Fixed.

26.10.2002 V2.2
---------------
o Fixed a silly bug where a player could have had more than one remotebomb
  resulting in hit-galore and serious other problems.

o Active powerups are now displayed in an additional window.  See Menu ->
  Windows -> Active Power-Ups.

o dynAMIte did not load a newly selected sampleset. Fixed.

o DServer now resets teammode and brings in initial amount of bots after
  the last player left the server.

o DServer now also does highscores for teams.

o Added another ARexx command to stop a running game called STOPGAME.

o Added a new ARexx command called DOCHATLINE to DServer.  DOCHATLINE
  handles the passed string as if it was typed into the chat string gadget.

o DServer now uses MUI's built in ARexx interface instead of an own
  implementation.  Because of this I had to change the MUI-Application
  base-name to match the old Arexxport name.  You have to snapshot some
  windows of DServer again.

o Added an option to skip drawing of explosionanimation for blown up
  powerups. See "graphics"-menu.

o Added an option to skip redrawing of powerups every 3 frames.  See
  "graphics"-menu

o Readded SKIPANIMS (skips drawing of bomb explosions) which is now
  available from "graphics"-menu.

o dynAMIte crashed on custompuppets if xpkNUKE.library was missing. Fixed.

o Did some cosmetical changes to DServer prefs.

o Added a button to DServer to login bots.

o Dead players can't switch slots anymore to get resurrected.

o From now on, dynAMIte uses its own network code (dynAMIteNET.library) in
  favour of amarquee.library.

o It's now possible to deactivate any powerup from within DServer.

o If a player used a custompuppet in teammode, the puppetgfx was used for
  the whole team the player was in (only in loginscreen).  Fixed.

o Removed timestatistics from the bottom of the gamewindow because of it's
  general usefulness.

o It's now possible to disable smokeeffect used for laser and kickbombs.

o I've finally rewritten keyboard handling code and removed dependency on
  lowlevel.library/GetKey(), so that it's now possible to control the game
  from a keyboard connected to a Pegasos.  This may also fix some problems
  with some keyboard adapters for wintel keyboards.

o Games with one human and n bots caused the gamecounter to be always
  decreased by one for every game.  Fixed.

o Applied the same changes for timerstuff also to dynAMIte.

o DServer will now save the highscores in a fixed timeinterval instead of
  after every game.

o Bots in DServer are now handled by an external client (detonator),
  taking load off of DServer.

o When a player logged off during a game, the bombs of this player left
  some gfx on the playfield.  Fixed.

o Fixed a silly bug in DServer that caused enforcerhits when a user tried
  to log into a full/offline server.

o Rewritten timer stuff for DServer to get back some sigs for other things.

o Shield and other things never ran out for bots. Fixed.

o Observers got games/wins accounted for highscore. Fixed.

o dynAMIte crashed when one of the needed libraries wasn't found. Fixed.

20.08.2002 V2.1
---------------
o Included completely reworked and massively extended AmigaGuide
  documentation done by David "Davar" Arbuthnot.

o Thanks to Ilkka "iti" Lehtoranta dynAMIteGFX.library and
  dynAMIteAI.library are now also available as native PPC libraries for
  MorphOS.

o Players can get resurrected only twice now.  Taking a heart does not add
  a life to your lifecount anylonger.

o Games with only one human player participating do not account for
  highscore any longer.

o Changed back the way how TeleportAll works.  If picked up, it will
  teleport every player to a random place.

o Graphics routines have been optimized even further.

o Dead players are now able to walk around and drop exactly one heart per
  death.

o Playerstats on top of playfield can now be switched to a more compact
  form by using the new command /compact from within the chatwindow.

o Colours in bubbles can now be changed in an easier way.  Use @t[1-8] to
  change text colour and @b[1-8] to change background colour.

o Trace-task of DServer never closed bsdsocket.library. Fixed.

o Afterburner never ran out once picked up. Fixed.

o Added UPTIME Arexx command to DServer.  Returns uptime, or seconds if
  additional argument SECS is provided.

o It is now possible to add lasers to a map.  8 new blocktypes have been
  added for this new feature.  Four for normal lasers and 4 for lasers
  hidden in destroyable blocks.

o Fuselength for players wasn't set in dynAMIteMapLab after loading a map.
  Fixed.

o Afterburner powerup will now add to the afterburner time.  This means,
  the more you pick up, the longer the explosion will last.

o dynAMIte now uses XPK (Nuke) to compress custom player graphics.
  dynAMIte will start without having XPK installed but loses the ability to
  use custom player graphics then.

o It's now possible to have your own custom gfx for your player.  To have
  custom graphics, you have to create another set (.gfx/.msk/.otl) of
  player graphics and place it into PROGDIR:styles/.  By default, dynAMIte
  checks for custompuppet.gfx.  By using PUPPET=filename (without .gfx
  suffix) as tooltype or shellargument, you are able to specify a custom
  gfx set with a different name.  Everything is done to keep bandwidth
  requirements as low as possible.  To achive this, DServer and dynAMIte
  are caching all custom gfx locally and only request graphics, when files
  have been updated by the other side.

o Moved most of gfx and all soundcode to appropriate external libraries.
  Put them into PROGDIR:.  This way it's easier to replace timecritical
  code by some interested programmers.

o It's now possible to simply hop to the next available slot, either to the
  right or to the left, by pressing shift-cursor-left/right or using the
  shoulder-buttons of the CD³² pad.

o CD32 Play/Pause button can now be used to switch between observer and
  player.

o Abandoned old style format in favour of a more flexible style format.  If
  you are a stylecreator, please have a look at one of the provided styles,
  preferrably dynAMIte-style, because this style is complete.  Styles don't
  need to have all gfx present. If one or more gfx files are missing,
  dynAMIte will fall back to dynAMIte-style for the missing file(s).

  explosion.gfx / set pixel at x=0/y=135 to pen 0 to switch to extended
  blockexplosion animation (8 frames)

  bombs.gfx / set pixel at x=0/y=16 to pen 0 to switch to "bounce"-mode for
  kickbombs

  sprites.gfx / set pixel at x=0/y=24 to pen 0 to switch to extended angel
  animation (5 frames)

o Wormholes never transported a player to the next WH. Fixed.

o The number that used to show the number of dropped bombs from the last
  game in loginscreen now shows the rank of the player instead.

o Colors of sprites in darkness/nightvision were wrong. Fixed.

o Added experimental teammode.  Use /team and /unteam.  Powerups which do
  not affect teammembers of the same team are:  Slower, Longer Fuse,
  Shorter Flame, Swap Controls, Fewer Bombs, No Drop, Stop, Darkness.

o DServer ARexx command 'MAPS' didn't work for the last few versions. Fixed.

o Hurryup didn't work as expected when only one player was present. Fixed.

o Compiled again with CreativE 2.12.3 by Tomasz Wiszkowski.

13.05.2000 V2.0 CD
------------------
o Duell did not work for other bots if one bot picked up duell item. Fixed.

o String in chatwindow couldn't be edited anymore since v2.0. Fixed.

o Removed workaround for amarquee.library V53.

o Requires amarquee.library V54 now.

o The player who picks up darkness item will see the playfield through some
  kind of nightvision.

o Darkness isn't so dark anymore (re darkness sucks).

o Sped up pen allocation a bit.

o Fixed a bug when deallocating pens for halfbright dynamite-logo.

o Fixed a possible enforcerhit while teleporting.

o Did some more asm optimizations (sprite funcs).

30.04.2002 V2.0
---------------
o Artificial intelligence made by Ilkka "iti" Lehtoranta has received a
  complete overhaul resulting in AI2.0

o Client will now close the connection to the server if it hasn't received
  a ping for 30 seconds.

o Added a check for mapjump pickup to prevent maps being played over and
  over again.

o Fixed a bug when deallocating bubbles after they have been used.

o Bots running on the server are now able to do bubbles too.

o GSL now displays number of bots.

o Added a workaround for amarquee v53 session ip bug.  Now gets the
  hostname of the session, could break clone detection in some rare cases.

o Fixed a serious bug which caused the game to never end when someone died
  exactly when hurryup mode was activated.

o Slightly changed Teleport-All powerup.  Instead of teleporting every
  player to a random position, players will now be teleported to the
  position of the player who picked up this item.

o Fixed a bug where kick/remotebombs caused invisible blocks.

o Bots are now able to kill themselves.

o Keymappings are saved now.

o DServer will now stop a game if no human player is participating in it.

o Initial bombs will no longer turn into blocks if a player picks up a
  bombs2block bonus.  This was changed back to old way because several maps
  are created to use this behaviour and didn't work that well with the new
  behaviour.

o DServer never closed Amarquee sessions since 1.9. Fixed.

o Added new powerup for now missing flashbombs -> darkness.

o Flashbombs have been removed because of lack of actual usefulness.

o If DServer was listed in GSL and it was quit, it was very possible
  httptask simply stalled because of synchronous message communication with
  DServer (DServer didn't check msgport while waiting for httptask to quit)

o You could drop as many flashbombs as you wanted.  Fixed.  Obsolete
  bugfix, see above.

o It's now possible to set maximum number of CPU players in DServer.

o Increased treshhold of flood detection a bit to make it possible to kick
  8 bots in a row :)

o DServer now displays the local ip in the status window on startup.

o Recompiled again with AmigaE 3.3a because of some unexpected problems.

31.12.2001 V1.9
---------------
o It's now possible to reconfigure some of the keys dynAMIte uses.

o Style and sample requesters are now opened on the same screen dynAMIte is
  running on.

o Added search function to highscore/userlist of the server.

o Recompiled with CreativE 2.12.3

o Sysopname is now also considered for nicknamecompletion on tab in client.

o Fixed a silly bug which occurred after pressing "Abort" in the mapscan
  window. Once pressed, no mapscanning or GSL updating was done anymore.

o Current style and current sample set is now displayed in screentitle if
  dynAMIte window is active.

o added 3 new samples: flashbomb.snd - used for the actual pup
                       flashexplosion.snd - guess
                       flashdrop.snd - guess

o Added flash bombs.  These bombs aren't deadly, but they will make you
  kind of blind for a few seconds, because they spread a very intense light.

o Serverchat now also displays the time in the listview.

o It's now possible to switch off the fx fades at the end of a game.

o Being remotely logged off from a server during a game won't increase
  gamecounter of the player any longer.

o If a player runs into fartgas, he will be poisoned and start to cough.
  A countdown to death begins and the poison kills him unless he manages
  to collect a skull. The only protection against farts is a shield.

o Added a new "baked beans" powerup, which gives you the ability to fart
  around and poison other players with deadly foul gas.

o Remotebombs now move with the same speed like the actual bombowner.

o Current player position and remotebomb position is now transmitted to all
  clients in intervals of 1 second.

o Lasers will now shorten the fuse of bombs.

o Added code to prevent dynAMIte to be hacked by embedded escape sequences
  in chat messages and other stuff.

o Reworked chatcommand handling in dynAMIte.

o Added new bonus/blocktype (it's actually a combination of both) which
  happens to be some kind of special teleporter called "The Worm Hole"
  (scary).  Entering a TWH will transport a player to another randomly
  chosen TWH.

o Kickbomb bonus now randomly adds 2-10 kickbombs to a players kickbombbag.

o Added new tooltype/shellargument (TESTMAPS).  With this option it's now
  possible to let DServer only scan maps in maps/.test directory and ignore
  all other directories.  Hope this is helpful for map creators who don't
  want to let DServer scan all maps, just because they only want to test
  some new maps.

o Added 2 Commands to allow players to either bring in new CPU players, or
  to kick them.  Commands are:  /loadbot /kickbot

o The amount of initial computer players can now be set in DServer settings.

o Finally, dynAMIte offers some kind of CPU players (for all of you who
  like to play by themselves without being online for example). CPU players
  require dynAMIteAI.library programmed by Ilkka "iti" Lehtoranta.

o On MapJump/Restart players will only be accounted for one game now.

o Added /hops command. This command displays the hop count of all players.

o A new blocktype has been added.  This new block (pi-block) is an extreme
  durable version of the normal destroyable block and needs to be hit twice
  by an explosion.

o Fixed a bug which had overwritten some bytes of the player data in
  DServer by mistake.  Did no harm as far as i can tell.

o DServer now does a traceroute to each player logged in to get the hop
  count. DServer adds another task, which handles all tracing activities.

o Rewritten some of the subtask handling code in DServer, to get it more
  straight.

o DServer now displays the total number of maps in the maps window.

o DServer now displays the port where it was started for in the window title.

o Maps are from now on stored by author.  This means, every map creator has
  his own directory within the maps directory.  DServer will move all maps
  found in the maps root directory to the corresponding author directory.
  Because of this, DServer can take some minutes at the first start, so
  don't be worried if it takes a bit longer.

o Changing online mode of DServer while downloading maps caused no maps to
  be downloaded at all. Fixed.

o The Ranking in DServer should now be displayed correctly.

o Minimum explosion range has been decreased to 1 (minimum was 2 before).

o dynAMIteMapLab didn't save hurry up time. Fixed.

o Added a new menuentry to make it possible to switch off auto-update of
  the highscore after a game.

o DServer now packs all messages for each client in a special packet, so
  that only one large message is sent to clients instead of many small ones.
  This helps to reduce traffic/network overhead.

o dynAMIte could freeze on maximum sized maps, because one blitlist wasn't
  initialised for the last "blockline".

o Once connected local, it wasn't possible to connect to any server from
  GSL any longer.  Fixed.

o DServer could wait forever on a certain signal at programend. Fixed.

03.09.2001 V1.8
---------------
o Last player logged in with 1.7a could not be killed, neither could he
  chat or control his figure.

o Fixed a small memleak at server end. Bug was introduced with 1.7a.

o Local player switching to observer mode caused the server to hang. Fixed.

o Added /repeat command. This command repeats the last played map.

o Internal message passing completely changed.

o Fixed a bug which was introduced in V1.7a (jump out of message loop)
  which has caused certain messages to be not handled at all.  This could
  have lead to all kinds of problems.

o Bubble messages were sent multiple times.  Bug was introduced with 1.7a.
  Fixed.

o Added a new sound.  dropkickbomb.snd is played everytime a player drops a
  kickbomb.

27.09.2001 V1.7a
----------------
o DServer now saves the settings everytime you change them in settingswindow.

o Bubbles were shown corrupt for one frame after the next bubble was going
  to be displayed.  Fixed.

o dynAMIte now needs identify.library V13, V12 won't be accepted any longer.
  (->http://www.shredzone.de/download/amiga/IdentifyUsr.lha)

o DServer now jumps out of message reading loop if a certain amount of
  messages are handled, allowing it to check timers and such.  This could
  solve some lag/pingtimeout problems if there are many players and heavy
  action is going on.

o DServer never deleted tgwnn.players.bak before renaming old players file
  to .bak and thus no new .bak was created.  Fixed.

o It is now possible to directly connect local without the use of TCP/IP.
  See "local" checkbox.

o Changes for bot developers:
  - Removed "kickbomb" from player struct.
  - Bomblist isn't per player anymore but it is one list for all players
    now. See dynasema.bomblist

o Fixed several annoying and stupid inconvincies with DServer settings
  which were not saved if the settings window wasn't opened at least once
  until the server got quit.  (where have I put my brain?)

o Added a workaround for a possible NList bug (enforcer hits caused by
  strange "messages" passed to display hook) which seem to occur only if a
  line is wordwrapped and gets removed.

o Rewritten most of chat code. Should be slightly faster now.

o Did some small overall optimizations to dynAMIte and DServer.

o Changed PingWatch(tm).  Players now won't be kicked after 2 minutes of
  "horrible" ping.  Instead he will be given a warning and if the ping
  stays that bad after another minute, the player will be removed from
  the server.

o Average ping value displayed in lagkick message was always the average
  ping of the first player. Fixed to display the right value.

o Tightened mainloop and spared 1 timer in dynAMIte.

o Replaced "Fade no. 13" (the one which looks weird) by a different fade.

o DServer now uses one timer less (merged pingtimeout- and uptime-timer)

15.09.2001 V1.7
---------------
o MapLab: Added Line draw-mode.

o MapLab: Previews are now drawn for box and filledbox draw-modes.

o MapLab: Fixed a bug if mousebutton was released outside of drawarea.

o Colourcode used at the start of a bubble is now used by all bubbles in
  the line.

o GSL now also shows PingWatch(tm) value.

o We decided to change how connection speeds are set in DServer to make
  selection of the appropriate speed more reasonable.  Connection speeds
  must now be specified both for up- and downstream.  This will make it
  also easier for players to see what servers might cause lag.

o Completely changed the way dynAMIte handles sprites and brings them to
  the screen including restoring damaged window areas.  Results in less cpu
  usage caused by this routines.

o Do you see the angels?

o The volume for sound effects can now be set (0-200%).

o It is now possible to set the number of channels, dynAMIte should use for
  sound effects.  Please see the documentation (Arguments/Tooltypes) for
  further explanation.

o dynAMIte logo now indicates wether the gamewindow is active or not.

o DServer now also displays the average ping response time of players in a
  two minute scale.  If a player has an average pingtime of more than x
  seconds (setable by the sysop) above the average ping of all players at
  the end of these 2 minutes, he will be kicked.

o Unsupported servers by the client (version-wise) in GSL are now displayed
  red and can't be selected for connection.

o To make old maps attractive again, DServer now has the option to mirror
  maps randomly in either x or y or in both directions.

o dynAMIte now features a Lag'O'Meter which is displayed on the bottom of
  the window in form of a growing/shrinking bar using different colours.
  The Lag'O'Meter doesn't cause any additional traffic.  This is done by
  using the fact that each serverping comes in every 5 seconds and if the
  serverping is delayed, the client knows the actual lag.
  The colour scheme used to display lag to the player is as follows:
  Lag            Colour
  <=0.5 seconds  Green
  <=1 second     Yellow
  <=2 seconds    Orange
  <5 seconds     Red
  >=5 seconds    Red and blinking

o Players now start to smoke if they get too near to a laser.

o Fixed a light-sabre bug which has led to reads from random memory
  addresses.

o Fixed another memory bug, which was rather hard to nail down (thanks to
  iti for his help on this one).  This bug caused mungwall/muguardianangel
  hits when DServer was quit (dedicated to Batman, who reported these hits
  a long time ago).

o Fixed some rather harmless memory bugs, which could have caused dynAMIte
  and DServer to eat all memory after some days of being run (depending on
  the memory available :)).  Memory was freed after dynAMIte and/or DServer
  were quit though.

o If the highscorewindow is open after a battle, it will update itself to
  the new highscore (requesting new highscore from server).

o If the server is rescanning maps, the game is now halted displaying an
  appropriate text in the gamewindow.

o Logging into a server will now add a special line to the
  chatlist/gameinfolist containing the servername.

o Fixed enforcerhits if highscore contained less than 10 entries.

o Map Comment, if available, is now also displayed in mapinfo-text.

o Gameinfolist is cleared too if "clear chatbuffer" is selected from the
  menu.

o "bring to front" option has no effect any longer if you are switched to
  observermode.

o "bring to front" will now remember which window was active the last time
  (game- or chatwindow) and activate it again if this option is enabled.

o A player should now always land in the middle of a swappositions bonus
  after the bonus got picked up by someone else.

o Fixed a bug with ratio-bar.  Ratio-bar was green if a player had a very
  low ratio.

o Remotebombs moving over an explosion caused the block under the
  remotebomb not to be replaced by mapbackground.  Fixed.

o Fixed a bug with wordwrapping on bubbletexts which could have led to too
  long texts.

o Safety requester for rescanning maps (if players are logged in) won't
  block the server any longer.

o Fixed a really nasty bug when memory for blitnodes was allocated that
  could have caused vital memory being overwritten and also memory leaks
  and software failures when quitting dynAMIte.

o Added another sound which is played when you get logged off by ping
  timeout (pingtimeout.snd)

o Logging into a server while a game is running and typing /map will now
  show the current mapname instead of an empty text.

o Fixed a bug which sometimes caused switched players to be logged off by
  pingtimeout.

o Highscore in DServer was sorted before winquota was calculated which
  means the order of the highscore wasn't always correct.  Fixed.

o DServer now also shows how many messages were sent/received.

21.07.2001 V1.6
---------------
o dynAMIte now loads for each player a specific explosion sample
  (explode1.snd - explode8.snd).  For maps with default bomb explode.snd is
  used.  If samples from 1-8 are missing explode.snd is used.

o Added GFA-Basic (yuck) developer files.  Thanks to Ingo Musquinier for
  creating them.

o DServer:  Maps with exact height of 30 lines always showed the
  mapparameters as creator of the map.  Fixed.

o Starting a new game from within the client will now start with a delay of
  2 seconds, so players have time to logoff or do other thing in this
  neverending 2 seconds ;)

o DServer: Added uptime, data sent and data received to mainwindow.

o Added new command /request which makes it possible for players to
  download maps from The Vault directly onto the server, so they can be
  played immediately.

o Developer:  Added dynasema.botinfo where your bot should set a version
  string and some additional information about himself.  Could become
  useful in the future.

o Chatbufferlimit for client can now be specified.

o Styles:  Reworked all standard styles to support new powerups.  Also
  removed the light sabre background which was still there for a few
  versions (which isn't necessary)

o DServer: longest and shortest match/playtime was swapped. Fixed.

o Your own player now flashes in negtive colors if a game starts instead of
  flashing in the player color, which made the flashing nonexistant if the
  player was already (only) in the same color.

o Developer:  Added version to dynamite semaphore, so it's finally possible
  to check if your bot is compatible with dynamite.

o Changed some code in client which handles connecting to gsl and server
  that was called from within a hook.  Hope this helps the amarquee
  problems a bit :)

o DServer: IP can now be specified. Either static or dynamic.

o Bots are now also affected by STOP item :)

o Developer:  dynasema.addbubble is now a PTR TO CHAR (char*) instead of
  the previous array.  So be careful when adding bubble with old code.

o Developer: each line of sema.grid is now WORD sized (PTR TO INT), each
  line of sema.bonusgrid and sema.explosiongrid is CHAR sized (PTR TO CHAR)

o Dserver now should also save the order and the width of the playerlist.

o Developer:  range in tempbomb isn't WORD but LONG (was wrong in C and
  Assembler includes).  Fixed.

o Developer: Added another gamestate: GAME_NOTCONNECTED which is set, if
  the game is not connected to any server (startscreen)

o Developer: New maparray available: dynasema.explosionmap which holds
  "1" for every field of the map that is currently affected by an
  explosion.

o Developer: Updated includes with new powerups (BO_FLAG...)

o DServer now also saves the state of "Hide Powerups" checkbox.

o New Bonus:  Swap Positions.  Exchanges the positions of the players, so
  player 1 will be teleported where player 2 stands and, if no other player
  plays player 2 will be teleported to player ones position.

o New Bonus: Jump Map.  Jumps to a map which can be specified in MapLab.
  If no map is specified this Bonus leads to a random map.  This bonus
  won't show up during normal game play but only, if the mapcreator has set
  it somewhere into the map.

o New Bonus: Restart Map.  Restarts the current map.  Works only for 3
  times for the same map.  After this 3 times, all Restarts will be removed
  from the map.  This bonus won't show up during normal game play but only,
  if the mapcreator has set it somewhere into the map.

o New Bonus: Teleport All. Teleports all players except you.

o Fixed a rather nasty bug which caused a certain memory area being
  overwritten with zero after resetting some player statistics before a new
  game started.

o DServer: Scanning for and of maps at server startup is now almost twice
  as fast as before. Also improved scanning of maps in general.

o HurryUp timeout can now be specified in maps, so that it's possible to
  customise the time until HurryUp-mode will be activated.

o All blocks in a style are now rearranged internally to lie on xx bit
  boundaries, for some speedup in copy functions (also fixes some mutools
  cmq()-unaligned hits I think).

o Shield is now also drawn if your player is invisble (on your own screen
  only of course).

o Due to some changes in the last version no messages were sent anymore to
  notify the player if the sysop changed the max player/observer values.

o If you are invisble and you become visible again the player sprite will
  now start to change it's state from transparency to normal and back a few
  times.

o Changed the shield again.  The blue glow is replaced by a flashing
  outline of the sprite.

24.06.2001 V1.5
---------------
o MapLab:  Saving maps without players results in a requester, telling you
  how stupid it would be to save a map without players.

o MapLab: Toolbar is now on the left side of the window.

o MapLab: Added "invert" button to maskwindow.

o MapLab: Now saves creator, so you don't have to set it everytime.

o MapLab:  dynAMIteMapLab no longer has the graphics build into the exe but
  will load it from disk as dynAMIteMapLab.gfx so that it's finally
  possible to use MapLab with your favorite gfx style.

o Added a flag bonus.  As soon as one player picks this bonus up, all other
  players will die, so that the player who picked up the flag wins.
  It will not show up during gameplay unless the mapcreator has set it
  somewhere in the map.

o The server will now send a "clonewarning" to all clients if a player logs
  in twice or more times with the same IP.

o Times for the shortest, longest and current game are now displayed below
  the playfield.

o It is now possible to give a reason when logging off (/disconnect, /quit)

o It is now shown in the chatwindow if a player dies.

o If a new game starts, current mapname and some informations about the map
  are now displayed in the chatwindow.

o DServer now holds statistics for each map.  For this, the server will
  create a new directory ("stats") in progdir:maps/ which will contain all
  map statistics.

o MapLab: Mapname is now reset if "New Map" is selected.

o Fixed a bug which was introduced with a small change on blitting
  operations which caused gfx leftovers on fullwindow refresh.

o Fixed a bug with visitors and dropall pickup where every visitor dropped
  a bomb for player 1.

o Highscore window will now also be un/snappshotted when selecting the
  apropriate menuitem.

o Blocks which could be (and are) drawn over by explosions and so causing
  invisible blocks are now restored after each explosion (gravestones will
  look like normal blocks after restoring)

o DServer now shows statistics for every map in mapwindow.

o DServer: Maps which have already been played are now displayed bold (per
  serversession)

o It's now possible to enter whole sentences for bubble texts.  Texts which
  are too long are split over more bubbles.  Also increased fkey settings
  to 64 cahrs.

o Thanks to a tip by ingo I could get rid of my own colortext class and
  instead simply use \eP[] with normal text.mui :)

o DServer:  Max.  linebuffer in serverchat window is now limited to 255
  lines to prevent the server to eat up all memory after a few days.

o Developer: Added serverdata to dynasema

o Developer: Changed the meaning of dynasema.gamerunning a bit.
  dynasema.gamerunning now shows the state of the game (one of GAME_#?
  types)

o Developer: dynasema.player was broken in that way, that only player 0
  was available as pointer. Fixed.

o Ping values are now finally calculated correctly.

o Gloweffects were using slow E version of the code.  Reenabled ASM
  optimzed code for gloweffects (which is roughly 2 times faster).

o Included fixed dynabot.c and added BotFrame.c.  Fixed and created by
  Stephen Illingworth.

o Stringgadgets for fkeysettings are now also using BetterString when
  available to make it easier to enter color codes.

o Added /setpw command to be able to change your password for the server
  without the need to inform the sysop to change it.

o Status icons for swapcontrols were not reset if an enemy picked up again
  reverse controls.

o Added another flag to style files to enable/disable extended
  blockexplosion animation (plays 8 frames instead of 4 frames pingpong).
  If your style provides the new anim, you have to set the pixel at
  position 3/188 (x/y) to any colour than 0.  The new blockanimation has to
  be present under the lightsabre gfx if you enable this feature.

o dynAMIte now opens ahi.device directly after being started, so that you
  can change the audiomode at any time.

o /info output displayed ppc info for "Style:" and missed style info
  completely.  Fixed.

o Bubbletexts weren't centered anymore. Fixed.

04.06.2001 V1.4
---------------
o Added /pause and /score commands.

o Changed how swapcontrols work. If change controls (up/down or left/right)
  is picked up the controls are just switched.  So if you already had
  changed controls and one picks up another changecontrol your controls
  will be back 2 normal.

o Dropping bombs and picking up Bombs2Blocks powerup fast consecutive (like
  it's possible in Axe_112) caused invisible blocks on the other players
  playfield.

o Players will now be placed exactly onto the field they are staying in the
  map on duel or basically everytime a remote bomb is picked up.

o It's now possible to create coloured bubbles.  To add a colour to a
  bubble, start the bubbletext with ascii-1 to ascii-8 (CTRL-a to CTRL-h).

o Fixed a bug that caused strange powerups to appear if there were too many
  hurry-up items in a map (like imbe_100).

o Player are now also y-sorted during countdown, so they will overlap other
  players "perspectively" correct.

o Added initial laser, initial kickbombs and initial fuselength for players
  to mapdescription.  Changed MapLab to support the new defaults.

o Fixed a bug which let dynAMIte crash on certain maps (imbe_108) or under
  certain circumstances.

o Server hotlist is now sortable by drag&drop.

o Added an interface for 3rd party programmers.  It's now possible to code
  your own (intelligent) bots and maybe even beat other bots (who codes the
  best AI, anyone? :))

o Last column in DServer was missing (last login), because of added
  WinQuota.

o MapLab:  Added comment string to map properties to be able to enter a
  comment to maps.

o Gravestones should no longer be drawn over by explosions and so causing
  invisible blocks.

o It's now possible to switch between observer and game mode at any time
  except if you started a battle.

o Starting a text with "*" in the string gadget (chat) will now display the
  text after the "*" in the next bubble.  Pressing "*" while game window is
  active will clear the current text in the string gadget.  Also incrased
  max. textlength for bubbles to 8 chars.

o All keyboardinputs (except cursor and shift/alt keys) during a game will
  now also be displayed in the string gadget (chat), while the game window
  is active.

o If you weren't in top10 and connected to new server and were then in
  top10 your last ranking (last entry in highscore list) wasn't cleared.

o Gloweffects didn't work anymore. Fixed.

o Fixed gfxleftover from laser after a gravestone was added and the laser
  still was over the gravestone.

o Cursor/Joystick-Up does nothing anymore.  To switch to observer-mode
  press Amiga-P or select the corresponding menuitem "switch".

o Visitors (err, observers) were also counted for games so their game count
  increased for every game they watched as observer.

o Renamed Visitor-mode to Observer-mode.

o Bubbles are now queued which means pressing a few fkeys consecutive will
  show them all one after the other in the correct order.

o Cleaned up my keyboard today. Now RETURN and CTRL are working again.

o Players disconnected because of too much lag (pingtimeout) will now be
  notified of this instead of just "TCP Connection Closed (-4)" message.

o Changed the way the server ping works.

o Shielddisplay wasn't set back when a new game started. Fixed.

o Added WinQuotient to /stats output.

13.05.2001 V1.3a
----------------
o Fixed a nasty divide by zero bug that was introduced with the new
  winquotient.

11.05.2001 V1.3
---------------
o Highscore changes:  Previous to this release, the player with the most
  won games was first in the highscore.  Now the rank is computed by both,
  the ratio and the won games.
  (ratio=won_games/games; winquotient=won_games*ratio)

o DServer:  Doubleclicking a player in the server listview will select the
  player in the highscore list and opens the highscore window if necessary.

o Added /stats [nick] command.

o Changed the way highscore data is sent to the clients.

o Sped up overall graphics output.

o Sped up drawing of explosions by 3 to 4 frames.

o Clients will be notified now if the sysop changes the maximum amount of
  players and visitors, so the client adjusts the display of figures
  according to the number of players.

o Your own player will now flash for a short time after teleporting.

o Phoenix bonus (the heart) won't appear during "Hurry Up" any longer.

o Players can now only be resurrected 3 times by default.  Picking up
  phoenix bonus (the heart) will increase the number of resurrections left
  of the player who picked it up.

o After rescanning maps in DServer the first listview column was only 1 (or
  so) pixel wide.  Fixed.

o Added "max. window size" option.

o Changed something with skull item (uhh.. hidden feature?)

o Fixed a bug that caused sending the current player pos to all clients
  after dropping a bomb for at least 15 frames (mucho unnecessary traffic
  caused by this bug)

o Added experimental visitormode.

o Gamewindow will now be reset to its original size after each round.

o Pressing SPACE or the yellow button of the joypad toggles infotexts in
  loginscreen now (window has to be active of course if using SPACE).

o MapLab: Moved "Tools" to mainwindow.

o Added some kind of bubbles to the game.  Take a look at the F-Key Settings
  and try F1-F10 and 0-9 and the yellow button on your pad during the game.

o "Help"-key is now used to switch between game and chatwindow instead of
  F10.

o Fixed two memleaks in chat message functions of DServer.

o Completely changed the countdown.  Countdown is now run, like the actual
  game, frame by frame instead of just updating the gfx if a number should
  change.  This results in almost the same CPU consumption as in the game,
  but makes some other nice things possible. See next 2 points.

o Your own player is now flashing in its textcolour during the countdown to
  make it easier for you to locate him.

o It's now possible to move your player during the countdown, to easier
  locate him.

o Changed lots internal things which should make gameplay run slighlty
  smoother.

o Data is now sent only after a frame, so messages gets first collected and
  are then send to the server instead of sending each message separate.
  Saves some overhead.

o Localized the whole server and game.

o The players countrycode will now be shown in loginscreen.

o New command: /Info nick - displays the specified players system.

o MapLab: Afterburner bonus wasn't saved for a map.

07.03.2001 V1.2
---------------
o DServer caused enforcerhits if one logged in without password and the
  server was listed in GSL.  As a sideeffect the server won't send any
  message to the GSL if a user was kicked because of wrong version/password.

o DServer now is several times faster on startup when scanning maps and
  loading playerdata (playing tricks with nlist.mcc that is).

o Fixed a bug that caused the window to follow kickbombs instead of
  remotebombs if the window was too small to display the whole playfield.

o Fixed /ping

o Added a flag to the style to switch kickbombs from play once (fly mode)
  to loop play like normal bombs.  Set pixel at pos 0/187 (x/y) to enable
  loop play.

o Blocks which become bombs are now also counted for hurryup bonus.

o Chatwindow now opens behind the actual playwindow on startup if "autoopen
  on startup" is selected.

o It's no longer possible to select a new sample-set while connected to a
  server.

o If "bring to front" option is active the gamewindow will now also be
  activated.

o Sometimes the first servers of the GSL were cut. Fixed.

o Pressing kickbutton for slot 1 if no player was logged caused hits. Fixed.

o Laser is now drawn using sprites which means colour 0 is transparent.

o Improved keyboard controls.  Now the game should no longer slow down
  while pressing and holding alt+cursor keys.  Big thanks to iti for his
  help on this one.

o Fixed another bug which prevented remotebombs from exploding if one
  pressed fire.

o Changed some things in mainloop to speed it up. Hope this breaks nothing.

o dynAMIte now only allocates the audiochannels, if one is connected to a
  server, so it won't block the channels if the game is iconified/idling.

o Amarquee session and some memory wasn't freed on an error if GSL or
  versioncheck failed (has eaten up all shellsigs after a few tries).

o Specifing proxy as tooltype should have done nothing for DServer until
  now :)

o GSL now works from a central URL which always redirects to a working
  GSL-Server (at least this is the theory)

o On a request I removed "got ping-request from" message, so it won't be
  displayed in the chat window any longer if someone pings you.

o Removed some unnecessary calls to refresh the window.  Should give a
  slight speedup.

o Throwing kickbombs while walking will increase their range by 6 fields.

28.03.2001 - V1.1
-----------------
o It's now possible to load different sample-sets from the menu.

o Loading of styles outside of PROGDIR:Styles/ is now possible.

o Added FPS display (16 fps is normal frame rate the game is running at).

o Fixed a bug in dynAMIteMapLab which made the Toolbox and some buttons
  rather useless if it was started from Workbench.

o Fixed a bug in OS3.0 safewritechunky() routine.  Graphics were drawn one
  pixel too low.

o Added /msg command.

o Added /ping command.  /ping will ping all players + server, so no
  arguments needed.

o "Edit Map" in DServer didn't work because of wrong filename for MapLab.

o Gravestones are now precalculated, so they won't be drawn as sprite over
  the actual playfield any longer but are drawn as normal block.

o Added winratio display to loginscreen in form of a green bar.

o "won" now is displayed white in loginscreen after a battle.

o Pen wasn't freed in timebar class. Fixed.

o HTTP request in client for receiving gsl was sent twice.

o Changed Back2Basics.  Now reverse controls is just active for a very
  short time.  Slowdown for about 10 seconds.  Bombs are decreased by 3 and
  flame is decreased by 5.

o Picking up several shields will now add to the total time this item is
  active.

o "Slower" item now adds to the time this item is active for the other
  players.  It will make them not as slow as before, so one i able to walk
  against magnets.

o Bombs will now tick faster or slower depending on the fuselength.

o Picking up Back2Basics bonus will now also remove invisibility and shield.

o Added Afterburner bonus.  This bonus will make all explosions last longer
  from the player who picked it up for some seconds.  The more you pickup,
  the longer you will have this special feature.

o Changed highscore a bit. 1:x ratio isn't shown any longer.

o Removed the need for .col files for styles.  The text colour for each
  player must now be specified in the .gfx file itself.  Take a look at
  dynAMIte.gfx.

o Reintroduced welose.snd. This sample is played if the own player dies.

o Changed server to use a doulby linked list instead of a fixed array for
  handling of players. Maybe it gives some speedup.

o DServer will now load its own configfile for each instance.

o Remote bombs are reacting now the same way as normal bombs, eg.  they
  will explode if a bomb explodes beside them.

o The upper string fields and the speed cycle gadget in dserver settings
  window are now in the cyclechain.

o Remote bomb bug should be fixed (sometimes they wouldn't want to explode
  if one pressed fire).

o Added small sort-button to the server hotlist.

o Dead players won't get a remote bomb any longer if someone picks up a
  duel bonus.  This change has led to some dicussions, so tell me your
  oppinion about this change please.

o Light-sabre gfx leftovers should be a thing of the past now.

o Added "bring screen/window to front on new game" option.

o Fixed a bug that caused enforcerhits if some libs weren't found at startup.

12.03.2001 - V1.0
-----------------
o Initial Release
