- dynAMIte developer information --

Since version 1.4, dynAMIte is offering a possibility to control it by
external programs.  To achieve this dynAMIte adds a public semaphore to the
systemlist which provides almost all necessary data to get a complete view
of what actually is happening in the game.

To make a bot work, you have to first start a dynAMIte client so the bot
can lock the semaphore and then do its own stuff.

If you want to write your own bots, please take a look at the corresponding
include files which are provided in either E, C, Assembler and GFA-Basic.

Thanks to Ilkka "iti" Lehtoranta for the C and assembler includes.

Thanks to Stephen Illingworth for fixing and improving dynabot.c and for
BotFrame.c.

Thanks to Ingo Musquinier for the GFA-Basic includes and example.
