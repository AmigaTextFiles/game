@{u}ABD «The Next Break» INTRODUCTION@{uu}

  @{b}A Break in Duo@{ub} is a game which mix bricks breaker, football
and pinball. The aim of this game, is to win a defined number of rounds
(default is 3, can be customised between 1 and 9, see @{"MENU" link "menu"}).

  To win a round, you must, in a limited time (different for each level),
score more goals than your opponent (included own goals). 

  The game looks like an horizontal brick-breaker. On each edge of the
screen we can fonud the goals of each player. They are defended by his bat
which can only be moved in the zone in front of the goals. Each player
have one or several ball(s).

  Score, bonus taken, number of wins and more are displayed at the top of
the screen. The bottom of the screen is used to show the chronos of the
bonus which have a time limit.

@{u}SCORING GOALS@{uu}

  A player score a goal every time a ball (one of his or one of the
opponent) go inside the opposing goals. When your own ball go in your
goal, that ball is kicked off as usual (as in all the brick-breaker). When
it is one of the opponent ball, it come back out by the trap "GOAL EXIT".

  At the end of the round, the player who 've scored the highest number
of goals wins the round. If the match is tied, no victory is assigned,
and you must play another round... until one player have won the right
number of rounds.

  The goals are divided into four different areas represented by the
letters G, O, A and L. When one of the opponent's ball go in one of
those areas, the corresponding letter is switched on. When the four
letters are lite, one of the arrows in front of the goals is switched
on. Then, the player collect a "super bonus" scoring a goal in the area
shown by the arrow. The areas, arrows and bonus switched on remain
available for the next rounds (see farther the paragraph @{"SUPER BONUS" link "super"}).

  Each goal scored bring in 10000 points. The following goals, scored
in the same letter, give 20000 points for the second one and 30000 point
for the others. The 2 and 3 digits lite in front of a letter show the
value of this letter.

@{u}PLAYING ABD@{uu}

  To play ABD, just double-click on the "ABDGO" icon. If you have some
problems with your chip memory (we haven't tested this game on all the
Amiga machines), "boot without startup-sequence" and, in your ABD direc-
tory, just type in "execute ABDGO"...

@{u}SOME NOTES@{uu}

  We love the Amiga but also the evolutive games. So, not any files
have been coded or crunched. Fell free to change the pictures or the
sounds and to distribute it (freely...).

  Send us your creations: we'll talk about you in the future versions
of ABD. Yes!, some more fun version(s) are forecast, and they will be
almost free for the registered users...

  Please, point out to us all the problems or bugs detected. Some are
known (some display problems in multitasking), others NO!
