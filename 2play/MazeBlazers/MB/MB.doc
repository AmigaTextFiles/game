NOTE:

a.

     Maze Blazers should run on all Amigas, regardless of CPU,
graphics, or OS version, however, there may be some system and
RAM configurations that are not 100% compatible. Please be
aware that, although these incompatibilities should by no means
cause any damage, they may adversely effect the playing of the 
game. 

     In other words: I have done everything possible to ensure 
that the game will function properly on every system, but, with
all the possible configurations out there, there is a chance that
it won't work properly on a few machines.

b.
     
     Given the extensive testing of this software on my own
systems, I will take no responsibility for any damage inflicted
to any system from its use or presence.

     In other words: You make the choice to keep and run this 
software. If something bad happens, it's NOT my fault.

I. - Introduction

     Maze Blazers represents my first genuine attempt at a full
fledged game. The basic concept reaches back to a time honored
gaming genre, the "maze" game, but takes it to a new level by
allowing up to four people to play simultaneously in a 3D, rather
than the traditional top-down 2D realm. 

     As with many multi-player games, the focus in Maze Blazers
is on competition. Who among the players can reach the exit first?
Of course, sometimes, simple competition isn't enough. That's why
I have incorporated several "complications" into the game. These
complications are discussed later in detail. 

     The main thing to remember is that, although Maze Blazers
supports single player play, for the purposes of testing new maze
designs and sharpening playing skills, the game's entertainment
value is drastically reduced without additional players.






II. - The Basics

     Although Maze Blazers is a simple game at heart, there are
some key elements that players need to be aware of to take full
advantage of the game's features. 

     Let's start at the beginning. After the title picture, a 
screen will appear, asking the user to select a rendering mode 
for the game's graphics. Experimenting with the various modes 
will allow the player(s) to choose the style of graphics that 
best suit both the system running the game and the artistic 
tastes of the player(s).

     Outside the game proper, the cursor keys can be used to 
alter game options. The 'enter' key is used to select an item, 
while Escape is used to abort operations. Also note that, on the 
Maze Blazers screen, F-1 and F-2 adjust the in-game motion delay
value, while the space bar toggles the Wammy Bar on/off. The Wammy 
Bar is one of those complications that I mentioned earlier.


The Basic Options:

Start Game - After everything is set to your liking, select this
option to begin the game. 

Number of players - Adjust this option to match the number of
human players in the game. 


Game Modes:

Single - Picks a single maze at random from the available maze
files and declares the first player out the winner.

Multi - selects a group of mazes from the maze files and
calculates an overall winner based on points awarded for exiting
each maze 1st 2nd... and so on. 

Countdown - Same as above but, players who don't find their way
out before time runs out, receive 0 points.


Edit Maze, Edit Palette, and Configure Keys - Simply follow the
on-screen directions for each of these, or refer to the Advanced
Topics section of this documentation.

Wammy - Use the space bar to toggle on/off.

Motion Delay - Use F-1 and F-2 to adjust the in-game motion
delay. This feature is fur use with fast systems, Stock 68000
users should leave the delay set to 0.


     OK, so you've made all your selections and the game proper
is up and running. Depending on the number of players specified,
you will see between one and four equally sized viewing areas
which represent the first person view of each player. Let's
assume that only one player is active for the sake of simplicity.
Above the viewing area, printed in white, is the current compass
direction of player one. Assuming that the default keys haven't
been changed, the F-1 key can be used to turn the view ninety
degrees left, while the F-3 key can be used to turn ninety
degrees right. F-2 will advance player one forward one 'step'. 
Within minutes, the movements will become almost second nature.
Users should note that player one may also be controlled by a
joystick in port two. Players two, three, and four must be 
controlled with the keyboard. 


Default Keys:

           Forward       Left 90        Right 90

Player 1     F-2           F-1            F-3
Player 2     F-7           F-6            F-8
Player 3      x             z              c
Player 4  Cursor Up    Cursor Left    Cursor Right


     Of course, these keys can be changed completely using the
keyboard configuration option, but, assuming that player one uses
a joystick, the default keys should be fine. 


     Now that you've mastered moving around, try to find the
exit. The exit is always represented by a Color 15, the middle
color of the non-dithered ceiling/sky, section of wall. Please
be aware that, since each player can only see up to four steps 
away from their current position, you will need to come fairly 
close to the exit to see it.

     The default mazes are meant to be fairly easy to complete,
so, with a little trial and error, the exit should be easy enough
to find, however, if you find yourself getting frustrated, you
can either press escape (ESC) to abort back to the main menu, or,
if in multi mode, press F-10 to skip to the next maze. 


Multi-player games:

     This is what it's all about. Grab a few friends and or
relatives and set up for something simple, like a five maze
ninety second countdown game. In multi-player games, the 
following elements can really add to the game play.


1 - The Wammy Bar

     When the Wammy Bar option is set to on, every time the 
space bar or joystick 2's fire button is pressed, one of the 
following things will happen:

  a. - If in countdown mode, the timer will gain five seconds
  b. - If in countdown mode, the timer will lose ten seconds.
  c. - One of the players will be blinded for a randomly selected
       number of moves. Their view will go black until they move 
       around a bit. (Very disorienting and pretty funny if
       you're not the victim. :) ) 
  d. - One of the players will have their cardinal direction
       altered, accompanied by a quick white flash. The bright 
       side is that this will remove any effects of a blinding. 
  e. - Nothing. (Hit it again! Hit it again!)

     Players who have already entered the exit cannot be affected
by the Wammy Bar, however, there is nothing stopping someone
who has already reached the exit from pressing the Wammy Bar,
unless, of course, you count threats of physical violence from
the other players. :) 

     Of course, the Wammy Bar has it's problems. For example,
taking the time to hit it will certainly distract the player,
even if for a moment, which can throw off his/her rhythm. Most
importantly, the Wammy Bar shows no mercy. Since it does not know
which player pressed it, it is entirely possible that a player, 
hoping to frustrate his opponents, may find him/herself blinded 
for the next twenty moves. Ah well, that's life. :)


2 - The Timer

     Let's face it, nobody wants to be the guy who couldn't make
it out of the maze, but, it's gonna happen eventually to even the
best players. The problem is that, in countdown mode, if you
don't make it out in time, you don't get any points, which will
hurt your overall score, in turn hurting your chances of winning
the overall game. 


3 - Frustration (In multi mode)

     See above, but this time there's no timer to mercifully end
your pain. You'll have to do it yourself by pressing the
Surrender key (F-10) which will produce the same effect as time
running out. Note that, although F-10 works in all modes, it was
designed particularly for this one, which is the only one it
really should be used in. 


     Well, that covers most of it, except for one question
which might be on your mind. Why can't the players see each
other?

     That's a fair question. Here are my answers:

1 - It makes it too easy to 'cheat', by following someone around
and then turning around early when you see that they've hit a
dead end. 

2 - It really slowed the game down. No problem for most newer
systems, but, many stock machines couldn't have handled it. 

3 - I'm not the most visually artistic person in the world, and
the graphics I had representing the players were crude at best.

     I agonized over this for weeks, after having implemented the
feature, and finally decided that I liked the game better without
it. Many would say that I should have left it in and let the
individual players decide. Perhaps, but, feeling as strongly as I
did, I decided to strip it. Nuff said.






III. - Advanced Topics 

     Although the Maze Editor, Palette Editor, and Keyboard
Configuration options are self explanatory, both in operation and
purpose, I thought it might be a good idea to note some of the
techniques I found most effective while testing these features. 


The Maze Editor:

- Try to make your mazes of a consistent size. It can be
frustrating to go from an 8X8 maze with a simple layout to a
20X20 maze with a billion twists and turns. Since the game
chooses each maze randomly, you can't simply put all the little
mazes first then make them bigger as you go. A good solution to
this is to make all your mazes small at first, then, as your
playing group's skills improve, you can add to the little mazes
uniformly, until you use the full area, which should be more than
enough for even the most die hard players. 

- Place the players and exit carefully. Try not to give any
single player an advantage in terms of distance to the exit. Some
ideas for this include putting all the players on one side and
the exit on the opposite end of the map, or placing a player in
each corner of a squared off maze with the exit somewhere in the
center. Also, remember that exits can be seen and entered from
any of the four cardinal directions if they are exposed. Be aware
that placing the exit in the middle of a large open space will
make it extremely easy to spot. A good rule of thumb is to
create a 3X2 wall chunk, placing the exit on the second block of
one of the rows of three. This will ensure that the exit is only
visible and accessible from one side. Of course, you may want the
players to be able to enter from multiple sides. You simply need
to be aware of how the game will interpret your placement of
the exit. Also note that the exit must always be placed on an
existing wall. The editor will not let you place it in an open
area, since this would cause a serious malfunction during the
game. 

- Change the mazes often. Doing this will greatly increase the
replay value of the game. Also, you may find the challenge of
designing original maze layouts nearly, if not more, rewarding
then running through them. 


The Palette Editor:

- Consider the rendering mode being used. A palette that looks
great with no dithering on the floors and sky/ceiling may look
quite different with the dithering turned on. 

- When you save a palette with "s", the game replaces the last 
palette saved with the one currently displayed. Likewise, when 
you press "l", it loads and displays the last palette saved. 
Also, note that the game always starts with the default palette,
whether or not a palette has been saved previously. This means
that you will have to enter the Palette Editor and hit "l" to
bring up the custom palette each time the game is run. 

- Don't be afraid to experiment with the Palette Editor. It's
there to be played with. Even if you save a palette, the default
will remain intact, so there's nothing to lose.


Configure Keyboard:

- Escape (ESC), SPACE, and F-10 are all reserved keys and cannot
be selected as player control keys. 

- Each time the game runs, the player control keys return to the
program's internal default values, listed below:

Default Keys:

           Forward       Left 90        Right 90

Player 1     F-2           F-1            F-3
Player 2     F-7           F-6            F-8
Player 3      x             z              c
Player 4  Cursor Up    Cursor Left    Cursor Right

- If anybody figures out a better way to configure the keyboard
in the event of four people actually having to use it at once,
let me know, but keep in mind that my configuration takes into
consideration the A600 keyboard, which has no numeric keypad.






IV - Registration

     I know what you're thinking. "Why do I need to register a
Freeware game?" Well, you don't. You can play this game until 
the end of time without paying me a dime. What can I say? I'm 
a nice guy. Seriously though, I'm no stooge. I realize that 
Maze Blazers, being my first game and all, is not what the 
average Amiga user is going to consider a game worth buying;
however, I do see this game as an excellent opportunity to 
get some feedback from the Amiga gaming community. So, if 
you have any comments about Maze Blazers, good or bad, feel 
free to drop me an e-mail. I'd also like to hear any 
general suggestions for improvements to the basic game,
since I'll be releasing at least one upgrade. See below.

     My current e-mail account "mdsst23@pitt.edu" will be 
going away in a couple of months, however, as I said above,
I'll be putting out an apdated version around that time 
with a new, more permenant e-mail address. In the new 
version (1.1), I'll be correcting any reported bugs and 
attempting to add any of the good features people suggest. 
So, if there's something you'd like to see in the game, now 
is the time to tell me, since I sincerely doubt that I'll 
continue this project without a show of interest.

Music - OctaMed (All versions from V5 on are excellent.)
        ProTracker (A classic, but looking shabby compared to the
                    new OctaMed versions.)
        MLED (Great for really authentic sounding techno.)


Plans for the future:

     Ideally, I'd like to continue doing games for the Amiga.
It's still my favorite platform, despite its age. Of course, a
great deal depends on how well this game does. It would be rather
silly of me to keep cranking out games that nobody wants. :)
Assuming that I get enough incentive to keep moving forward, my
next project will be another four player game. This one, a sci-fii
oriented affair  with a decidedly more "fast action arcade" feel, 
and a sharp division between the strategy and arcade elements of 
the game. By the way, just in case anybody noticed that Maze 
Blazers was done in HiSoft Basic, don't worry. I've spent the 
past year learning C++ and Amiga E and intend to do all my 
future projects with one of the two.


                                               Enjoy the game!
