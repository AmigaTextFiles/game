@node Uvod "Introduction"
There were some attempts to create decent Yamb game on Amiga but in my
oppinion nothing various and that could be played.  It all looked very
mottled and nothing more.  There is a Yamb on PC written by Jugoslav
Starcevic back in 1993.  Very nice Yamb that can be played in DOS, but
barely under PC Task.  Jelena played that Yamb very much and often and then
I thought something like that should be made for Amiga.  Since I have not
had any programming experience especially not in C, I decide to begin
learning and experimenting 29.05.2000.  So, now I can laud with following
features in this version of Yamb:

- Maximum 4 players
- You can play with 5 or 6 dices
- You can choose wich columns you want to play and do you want play with
  one more field: triling
- Chosing between a real Yamb or an easier one (certain announce)
- HighScore for top ten (5 or 6 dices each) and
  HighScore for every combination of rows you choose
- Undo for writing in wrong field
- Easier and quicker trowing and choosing on numeric keyboard
  Easier and quicker choosing field to enter winnings on keyboard
- You can play Yamb in your own language (locale)
- When more players play the game, small list is made at the end of the
  game showing score
- HELP button shows column and field details
- In TOOL TYPE of icon you can set names for players and size of dices

If you find some bugs, please let me know how you found them and what kind
of bug it is, and I will try to fix it.

I wish that you spend many pleasant hours playing YambMUI.

P.S.  Please send me e-mail if you like this game, only for seeing how many
of you playing this game.

Yamb is a game with dices and is very simple to play.  There is 5 (10)
columns that should be filled with as good result as there can be.  Aim is
to have as many points as possible.  That depends on your luck and ability
to combine winnings into fields.

Game rules:

The game consists of rounds and they consist of three dice throwings.
After the first and second throwing you can choose dices you want to keep
and throw other dices.  After the third throwing you have to enter score in
some of free fields.  Although a round consist of three trowings, you can
enter your score even before if you are satisfied with it.  After entering
your score next player takes a round and plays the game.  It goes on and on
until all fields are filled.

The list contains columns and rows which gives you fields where you write
your scores.  Each column and row have their own rules for column and row
have their own rules for gaining and entering score.  It is very important
to get familiarized with those rules in order to make big score.

There is one relief when entring your score; For instance, if you throw 4
fives and you wish to enter poker and you pressed full by mistake, the
field will automatically be crossed, because 4 fives are not a full.  You
can undo your move and hit the right button.

If you did not get what you wanted, and you can not enter desireable score
you can cross any field.  If you set Certain Announce in settings then you
can not cross any field within the Announce column.
@endnode
@node 1
@{b}1 2 3 4 5 6@{ub} - The aim is to have largest number of single dices.  This
means that in a row 2 you should have as many dices showing two as
possible.  If the sum of all these rows comes over 60 then you get 30 bonus
points over the sum.  In practice the sum over 60 is if you have 3 dices
showing the same number in each row.  E.g.  3*1 + 3*2 + 3*3 + 3*4 + 3*5 +
3*6 = 63 (it may seem difficult, but you will figure it out during the game
:).
@endnode
@node Max
@{b}maximum and minimum@{ub} - The aim is to have as bigger sum of thrown dices as
possible for maximum, that is as lowest sum as possible for minimum.  Only
5 thrown desired dices participate in summary.  The biggest ao the lowest
summary should be entered in max or min field.  Then you subtract minimum
from maximum.  The result id multiplied by the number of dices in the first
row.  The best result is to have 30 for max, and 5 for min.  When you
subtract, the result is 25.  Then you multiply it by number in the first
row (if you got five dices showing 1 it gives 5) 25*5=125!  This is really
very difficult to achieve but it is an example.  When you play with 5
dices, max and min are the same (because you use only 5 suitable dices), as
well as when you play with 6 dices.
@endnode
@node kenta
@{b}kenta@{ub} - The aim is to get 5 dices showing numbers in a row.  (1,2,3,4,5 or
2,3,4,5,6) It is very important whether you got kenta in the first, the
second or in the third throwing.  In accordance with that you can enter 66,
56, or 46 in kenta field.

@{b}triling@{ub} - 3 same dices is triling. Sum of them and + bonus 20 points.

@{b}full@{ub} - Very simple, score should be like this:  3 same dices + 2 same
dices.  It means that if you get 3 dices showing 2 and 2 dices showing 5
you got full.  But full is also when you get 5 same dices.  Because it is
logically (at least to me) that when you get 5 dices showing 5 - it is the
same like you got 3 dices showing 5 + 2 more dices showing also 5, is not
it?  Sum of 3 same dices + 2 same dices + bonus of 30 points.

@{b}poker@{ub} - Even more simplier.  You have to get 4 same dices and enter the
score in poker field.  Sum of four dices + bonus of 40 points.

@{b}YAMB@{ub} - It is culmination of the game.  The hardest and the dearest moment
in your game.  When you get 5 same dices it is Yamb.  Sum of 5 same dices +
bonus of 50 points you enter in a field for yamb.
@endnode
@node D
@{b}Down@{ub} - The first column is filled from up towards down.  You can not jump
fields.  That means you can not enter sum for row 2,3,4,5 or 6 if you did
not enter score for row 1.  Also you can not enter for row 5 for instance
if you did not enter score for rows 1,2,3 and 4.  And so on.
@endnode
@node S
@{b}Free@{ub} - In this column (as its name clearly says) you can enter score
without any order.  If you get dices showing 5, and you did not enter score
for 1,2,3 or 4, you can freely enter score for row 5.  Simple!
@endnode
@node G
@{b}Up@{ub} - In this column, similar to the first (Down) column, you can enter score
from down towards up, that is if you go yamb, you can enter score for poker,
then for full, and so on.
@endnode
@node N
@{b}Announce@{ub} - In this column you can enter score like in Free column, with
exception, after the first throwing, you must announce you will enter score
in this column.  It is enough to press Announce button, and that is all.
If you annouce you must enter score in a field in Announce column.  If you
do not, you will cross come other field.

If you set in settings option certain announce it drastically changes
things.  When you want to annonce you must choose suitable field in
suitable rowin Announce column.  E.g.  If you announce full, you must throw
dices, announce full (press Announce button and full field) and finish
throwing dices.  If you got a full after the third throwing, it will
automatically be entered, if not it will automatically be crossed.  It is a
little bit harder then previous announcement, but it is the rule that exist
in real Yamb.
@endnode
@node R
@{b}Hand@{ub} - This column is filled only with score made by the throwing from
hand.  Keeping some dices and throwing the rest is not allowed.  It means
if you threw dices for the first time it is hand, and you can enter your
score in this column.  If you are not satisfied with the score after the
first throwing, you can throw again but you must throw all dices again.
You can throw them three times.  If you throw dices and select some of
them, but decide not to enter the score but to throw other dices again,
your field will be crossed.
@endnode
@node Di
@{b}Direct@{ub} - When you write winnings in column announce, than you must play
same and write in this column. That means: Your announce is FUL and your
winnings is FUL (but that is not important for this explanation). Next
player (or you if you are a only player) must get FUL if you don't want
erase this field.
@endnode
@node OS
@{b}From middle@{ub} - You write your winnings from middle to top or bottom. First
you need write in max then 6, 5 etc. or min then kenta, ful etc.
@endnode
@node KS
@{b}To middle@{ub} - You write your winnings from top or bottom to middle. Same as
in first column to max and same as in third column to min.
@endnode
@node O
@{b}Obligation@{ub} - Your winnings is written in this column only when you fill all
fields in 8 columns. You only roll your dices and winnings is automaticly
write from top to bottom (just like in first column).
@endnode
@{b}@Maximum@{ub} - Your winnings is written only if they are maximum. If your
winnings is poker with fives, and you try to write it in field poker, you end up
with crossing that field. Only poker of sixties you can write in field poker.

@node Podesavanja "Settings"

There is a big choices how to define your game.

@{b}pictures of columns@{ub} - You can choose wich columns you want to play.
There is no limitations, you can play with 6 columns and extra two columns
are what you choose.

@{b}5 or 6@{ub} - How many dices you desire to play Yamb with.  All your score
counts as if you played with only 5 dices (the 6th is there only to help).
Thus, it is much harder to play with 5 than with 6 dices, so there is a
HighScore for 5 dices.

@{b}You can stop dices@{ub} - For the first time you press Throw (or Enter), the
dices begin to roll.  Next press stops them.  You can turn this off, and
when you press Throw (or Enter) you get score right away.

@{b}You can see HighScore@{ub} - Do you want to be teased all the time by someone
who made more points than you?  Or perhaps you want to see how many points
the last one on the list has, or whether you have enough points to enter
HighScore?  Than select this option.

@{B}Column with sums@{ub} - When you play real Yamb (on paper) there is last
column where you can sum your scores when you finished game. This is Yamb on
computer you don't need for that column.

@{b}You can see your total score@{ub} - In the upper right corner of the window your
total score can be seen, and that's neat, but someone might not want to see
his total score.  Let's say that when you play with someone, it might just
be better not to know your total score, nor your opponent's score, until
the last throwing.  This is more like the real Yamb.  When you play real
Yamb, on a paper, you do not know how many points you or your opponent
have, because you do not sum all score till the very end.

@{b}Chosen dices throw@{ub} - When you get some score then you choose dices you want
to keep until the next throwing.  If it is easier for you to choose dices
you want to discard, then select this option in the settings.

@{b}Certain Announce@{ub} - Like in real Yamb you have to determine exactly what you
announce.  It goes like this:  you throw dices and then announce, but you
must press the exact field that you want to enter score in.  Only after
that you can continue throwing dices or enter the score, if you are
satisfied.  After the third throwing your score is automatically entered
into an announced field.  Undo works here also, if you announced something
you did not want, you can do it again.  If this option is off then playing
will be much easier.  You press "announce" but you do not have to determine
what are you announcing.  Then you throw dices and see what it comes out
and only after the third throwing you choose what field to enter announce
in.  Even if you thought you would get only 3 dices showing 5, and you got
4 of them, then instead of field for row 5, you can neter these four dices
in a field for poker.

@{b}Triling field@{ub} - When you choose this, in every columns is one more
field. Press @{"here" link kenta} to see how you write winnings in this field.

@{b}Last throw is 5 times@{ub} - When you play real Yamb you can throw 5
times your dices instead of 3 times for last field in your turn.


One more very important settings, but not in "settings" then in TOOL TYPE
of icon. There is names for players. You can set names for players once in
tool type and when you start YAB there is yours names instead of my names
and you don't need set your names every time you start Yamb.

In ToolType of icon you can determine size of dices.

  Tool Type:       Meaning:
(Screen=Lace)     PAL dices
Screen=Lace       Interlace dices
