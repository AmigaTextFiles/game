       Spy vs Spy 3d

     This is a beta version of a new game, this is only a 3d engine,
   and is the first version that I submit to aminet.

     In the future, this game will be very similar to Spy vs Spy, but
   with option to play in internet. You will take some objects and figth
   with the opponents.

     You can move around the world with cursor keys, and with this version
   I submit to a 3d world editor.

     If you have something interesting for this game, please send me an email

@node "como" "How it work"

     You must load a 3d map and click to start, in this version you cant
    do something, because is a very early version. You can move around
    the 3d world with cursor keys and space.

        If you have a 030 processor, I sugested to you use a workbench
    screen in pal with 4 or 8 colors, but if you have a 060 it works
    very well.
