                  TopYahtzee 1.0.6 Official Instructions
                  ======================================

Well, first of all, you have to know  I don't like writing docs.  In fact, 
I've got to admit, I  *hate*  writing docs, especially when I have to write
them on a foreign language, so  you're on your own from  now on.  Start pla-
ying and you'll pick it on the way. I'm out of here... just kidding (am I?).
What I really meant was I don't like writing *long* docs, see?   :^)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Yahtzee? Yahtzee is an ancient and very popular game of dice.  And,
what is TopYahtzee? TopYahtzee is the best Yahtzee for the Amiga computer so
far. Modesty is my middle name, isn't it?  :-)  TopYahtzee is copyrighted 
software and it is copyrighted by me, and I am the author and I say you can
use it as long as you like as long as you pay me  US $ 6.- or DM 10.- or 
equivalent. On the other hand (I have 5 fingers too) you can play it as long
as you like without paying me anything.  But, if enough  people pay that 
measly  6 bucks, I'll work on the game some more. I plan tournament option, 
advance statistics, computer players and...  So,  it's up to you, Joe the 
User, if I'm going to work more on this program or not.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
How to play the game?  You must have played Yahtzee (or equivalent) before, 
haven't you? ... I thought so. So this will be just short instructions:  

Upon starting TopYahtzee  you'll see title screen first. If you click left
mouse button, "Hall of Fame" screen will pop up.  First time you do this,
you'll just see a screenfull of my name, but you should  join the list just
after finishing your very first game.  When you've seen enough of "Hall of
Fame" screen,  click again and you'll find yourself at the main screen.
On the left side there is a list of legal combinations you can throw, and
on the right there are four score-boards.  One for each player, so four 
players can take part in a game. Of course, less then four players can play.
You can select this from menu, but 2 players is default. Also by default, 
player's name is set to 'Player-' plus the number of the board he (she) is
playing  on.  You can change the name  by clicking on it, deleting the old
name and entering the new one. If you forgot to capitalize the first letter,
the program does it for you.  On the bottom of the screen you'll find an 
invitation to play and a button with a "Roll" sign on it. Click it.  Ta-da!
You're already playing! :-) You'll notice 2 numbers to the right of dice.
The upper one shows you  the number of throws  you've got and the lower the
sum of values on a thrown combination. You can select dice you want to throw
again by clicking on them. Satisfied with that, click on 'Roll' again. If 
the combination after first or second throw suits you fine, you can evaluate
it by pressing the 'Roll' button without selecting any dice. 
How to 'evaluate' a throw?

Each player has 4 columns to write his (hers) points into. The first one has
a sign of 'arrow up' above it. That means you have to fill it from the bottom
up.  The second one is opposite.  You have to fill it from the top down. The
third one is er ... "normal". You can fill it randomly.  You can fill the 
fourth one randomly too, but it has to be after first throw. If you click any
box in the fourth column, and you have thrown more than once, what you'll get
is an unpleasant sound and a big fat zero in the box. That's what you'll get
if you click the box you have not the  appropriate combination for, too. The
legal combinations are: "Aces" - only faces with one dot count. "Twos" - only
faces with two dots count. The same goes for "Threes", "Fours", "Fives" and 
"Sixes". The row "BONUS" follows. There you can see how many point  you have
accumulated with the above-mentioned combinations. If the sum exceeds 62, you
are given extra 35 points. Now, there are "Minimum" and "Maximum". Everything
scores here if you follow one simple rule: "Maximum" must be higher then 
"Minimum".  Next, there are "3 of a Kind" and "4 of a Kind". The names say it
all. And there are "Sh. Straight" and "Lg. Straight". It's easy too. "Short 
Straight" means any 4 dice with values continually rising ( 2-3-4-5-x, for 
example). The same goes for "Lg. Straight", but this time all 5 dice should 
follow the rule. Finally, there is "Yahtzee", and to score it all 5 dice 
should have the same face up.  After filling up each and every box on your 
board the game is over, and the  winner's  name is displayed on the lower 
left side of the screen.  Now, you'll have the opportunity to look at the 
"Hall of Fame" screen again. This time with your name somewhere on it. At this 
point the program tries to save the top-20 list. Names of players that have 
just finished the game are saved too, so you don't have to type them again
next time you want to play. 

How to install TopYahtzee? It's easy. Put it wherever you want. You've got
to have following items though:

In Fonts:   topaz,     size 8
            opal,      size 12
            courier,   size 18
            helvetica, size 11, 24

and in Libs:  diskfont.library version 37 or higher

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 That's it. Now, you're really on your own!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TopYahtzee is not PD. TopYahtzee is a SHAREWARE! The fee is US$ 6.- or  
10.- DM. If enough users register, I'll put more features in the game. Like
tournament, more statistics, computer players or even an user's idea.
