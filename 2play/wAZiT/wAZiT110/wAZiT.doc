iNTRODUCTION...

   In all times, man has loved violence. There has always been something 
special about blowing someone stright to hell. Some hundred years ago it 
was less non-ok to do this with a person, but nowdays you can't even beat a 
single old lady without being punished by the law. That is why we have 
video- and computergames.
   Gravity-games has existed longer than God himself, but not until Now you
have had the time to release your anger via wAZiT - the deadly tournament!

I played some YAGG before I made this game. I noticed that it was partly
written in Blitz. As I happen to be the world's best Blitz-programmer, I 
decided to make such a game my self. I had the first beta ready half an hour
later ;) 

Anyway. Game is on, lad!

gAME lIMITATIONS...

   As you'll notice, there are some limitations in this game. Some of the
weapons aren't available etc. Right now, I have NO plans of completing this
game. There has been no response whatsoever, so I give you this 'full' 
version for free.
   BUT! If you want a better version, send me an e-mail. If I get some re-
sponse, I WILL complete the game. 
   The only way for you to get MORE ARENAS is also to send me an e-mail and
ask for 'em.

bUGS...
  
   Yep, there are probably a handful of bugs included.
   The previous versions crashed alot, but I don't THINK this one should do
so. It's a shame if it does. 
   The music seem not to work as well as it should in the title sequences.
I have no idea why, and I can do nothing about it (as far as I know!).
