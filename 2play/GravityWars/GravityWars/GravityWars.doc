GravityWars......
	The object of the game is for one player to hit the other with a 
missle before being hit yourself. Since the ships don't move and the planets
don't move the game sounds easy right...Wrong. All the planets have gravity, 
so the missles bend an twist, even reverse. It's very easy to hit yourself.
	The two players take turns firing missles by entering firing angles
and velocities. The winner is the ship left alive.
