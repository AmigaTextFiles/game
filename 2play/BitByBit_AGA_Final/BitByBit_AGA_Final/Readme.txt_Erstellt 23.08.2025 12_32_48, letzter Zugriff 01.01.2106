In the golden age of pixels, Amiga and Atari ruled the screen. But one boy, left without games or joy, gave birth to a dark force: The Eraser.

Bit by Bit is a retro-style, two-player asymmetric puzzle-action game for the Amiga.
Player 1 controls Red and Blue droplets in sync.
Player 2 becomes The Eraser, corrupting the world tile by tile.

Objectives:
Player 1 wins by reducing The Eraser its 16 Bits of Destruction to 0.
Player 2 wins if more than 50% of the map is corrupted.

Key Mechanics:
Potions and gems have different effects depending on who picks them up.
Every tile touched by The Eraser turns permanently black.
Red and Blue require coordination to succeed.

Dual control, asymmetric roles, and strategic pickups define the fight to save a pixelated world from disappearing… bit by bit.

How to install:
Copy the game folder to your Amiga or run it via WHDLoad using an emulator.
Launch the executable file BitByBit or the WHDLoad loader.
Requires an Amiga with AGA chipset and at least 1MB of RAM.
