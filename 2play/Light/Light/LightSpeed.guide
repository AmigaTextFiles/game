@This looks so much nicer in a fixed font. Don't use helvetica, please!
@I spend hours making this neat and tidy for you and then you'll go and
@use helvetica - yes you will! I despair, I do! It's not that helvetica
isn't nice, but it has its place and its place is not in an amigaguide.
I mean, have you seen the kind of mess it makes. It just isn't right...

@node "Introduction" "Introduction - it's so easy, just try it"

 In short, we're talking light cycles. You (playing as a "cycle") must
direct an ever lengthening line of light around the screen, trying not
to collide with the obstacles scattered in the play area, the trails of
the three other players' lines or the trail of your own line. The style
of play adopted can be defensive or offensive depending on preference.
It's a simple idea, but with two (or better, four) human players it can
get very addictive. See @{" Game Prefs " link "Game"} for details of advanced features.
@endnode
@node "Options Menu" "Options Menu - so many choices..."

 In the options menu are the following:

 @{"  ?# Player(s)  " link "Players"}
 @{"   Begin Game   " link "Begin"}
 @{" Player Control " link "Player"}
 @{" Colour Control " link "Colour"}
 @{"   Game Prefs   " link "Game"}

 Every gadget in the options windows has a hotkey, so making changes to
the options is easy even when a joystick is plugged into the mouse port
for playing purposes - just look for the underscores.

 When @{b}Save@{ub} is chosen from any of the sub-windows, the current setup is
written to a file named `light.prefs' in the program directory. If @{b}Use@{ub}
is chosen instead, the changes made to the setup will be implemented,
but will not be written to the prefs file.
@endnode
@node "Players" "Selecting Players - grab three friends!"

 This cycle gadget allows you to select how many human players are to
take part in a match (1-4) or alternatively to select an all computer
demo.
@endnode
@node "Begin" "Begin Game - play! play! kill! kill!"

 Click this to begin playing using the current setup. In-game, after
every match a window will appear showing the current number of wins
gained by each player. Click @{b}Play@{ub} for another match or @{b}Quit@{ub} to return
to the options menu (Players' accumulated wins will be discarded).
Pressing the @{b}Help@{ub} Key during a match will pause the game. Pressing it
again will recommence play.
@endnode
@node "Player" "Player Control - choose your weapon"

 The player control window allows you to change the method of control
for each player, as well as attach a name (max 7 chars) to each player.
Only a single player can use a particular control method at any time,
so if two control methods have been set as identical, the @{b}Save@{ub} and @{b}Use@{ub}
gadgets will be ghosted

@endnode
@node "Colour" "Colour Control - cool colours, check 'em out"

 The colour of all four lines can be edited from this window. Pressing
on one of the numbered gadgets (1-4) will select which players' colour
is to be edited and the slider gadgets alter the red/green/blue values
of each colour.
@endnode
@node "Game" "Game Prefs - customize the playing experience"

 @{fg highlight}Long Blocks:@{fg text} Toggles the four `circuit board' type obstacles on/off.

 @{fg highlight}Swooshes:@{fg text} Toggles the in-game `swoosh' turning sound effects on/off.

 @{fg highlight}Obstacles:@{fg text} Toggles the `computer chips' on/off. When turned on, the
chips will appear in a number of set positions, but whether any single
chip appears or not is decided at random.

 @{fg highlight}Screen Wrap:@{fg text} When this option is on, players who leave the game arena
will reappear on the opposite side. When off, the line marking the edge
of the arena acts as a solid wall and cannot be passed.

 @{fg highlight}Acceleration:@{fg text} When this option is enabled, players can make their line
move in small bursts at twice the normal speed by pressing fire. Once a
line has accelerated, it cannot do so again for about one second after.
The `fire' keys for the keyboard are...
                                      @{b}Cursors: right shift
                                      Q-A-Z-X: space bar@{ub}

 @{fg highlight}CPU Turning:@{fg text} The logic used to control CPU players is coded to loop
around so many times before creating a random number. If this random
number is a certain value the CPU will turn left, if it is another
value the CPU will turn right, and if it is yet another value the CPU
won't turn at all. This slider controls how many times the code must
loop before the lines think about turning. The default value is 70:
setting it higher makes the lines turn less often and setting it lower
makes them turn more often.
@endnode
@node "Requirements" "Requirements - don't ask us!"

 In theory, any kick 37+ machine with enough RAM to get a pubscreen
open should be able to start the game, with a few hundred k spare to
run it at a reasonable pace.

 In practice, we give no guarantees. There is no reason it shouldn't
work, but Amigas come in many flavours and we only have two of those
flavours to test the game on: A1200 '020 4Mb fast and Workbench 3.0
                              A1200 '030 8Mb fast and Workbench 3.0

 Notes: A few of MultiCX's features may really muck up LightSpeed's
pubscreen and generally cause a mess. One that especially needs to be
turned off is the HARDPATCH option for TagScreens. To allocate the
mouse port LightSpeed has to temporarily kill the input device, so a
program trying dumbly to use it might get a shock and go nuts or lock
up the machine. Lastly, altering the screenmode that LightSpeed uses
with mode promotion tools is not a good idea, because the game must be
able to read coords from the screen to function properly, and relies
on that screen being 320 x 256.

 Speaking of MultiCX, did you know Micro Design are writing a brand new
gadtools prefs for it? You didn't? Then, @{"   we'll tell you about it   " link "MultiCX GUI"}

@node "Micro Design" "Micro Design - all about those great guys"

 Micro Design is an occasional collaboration between part-time computer
artist Daniel Pimley and part-time programmer Richard West in an effort
to produce some half-way-good software for the finest machine on earth.

 Please direct all praise, flames, bug reports, good ideas, (and so on)
to the email address and we may reply to them if we can be bothered to.
You should also consult the @{" Legalities " link "Legalities"} section of the guide for more
details concerning the Micro Design name.

as `LightSpeed' that have been attached to the name `Micro Design' must
also be attached to those persons. Thus:

@node "Registration" "Registration - be good and do it"

 LightSpeed is @{b}Shareware@{ub} - the registration fee is a mere £3 Sterling.
If you are registering from a country other than the U.K, please don't
send foreign currency, in fact it probably isn't even worth you sending
a foreign cheque for such a small amount. Instead, send the fee in one
of the following alternative forms, which we happily accept as payment:

 liquor - in particular Budweiser and whisky (if you're rich);
 gold bullion (if you're richer);
 CD-ROMs you don't want any more;
 more liquor;
 A (working) CD32 controller that you may not want;
 Japanese Manga comics/stickers;
 A cheque for an amount (£5+) worth bothering with.

 The two addresses to send any of these wonderful things to are listed
below. @{b}All cheques should be written out to Richard West@{ub} and all Manga
stuff or the unwanted CD32 controller should be sent to Daniel Pimley.
Persons registering from within the U.K may also send any of the above
instead of money. In fact, send anything and we'll love you forever.

 * A major audio bug has been fixed, although still using the eaudio module
   all 4 sound channels are now allocated correctly thus fixing the 
   screaching noise which seemed to activate from time-to-time
 * Small glitches in code smoothed out
 * Bug fixes - nothing important

@node "MultiCX GUI" "New MultiCX GUI - hurrah for Micro Design!"

 Do you think MCX is wonderful, but the tooltype "prefs" are more than
a bit tiresome? Do you also hate MUI with as much of a vengeance as we
do and so refuse to use the MultiCX MUI Prefs? Then the very unofficial
`I think MUI stinks' club is for you. As full members, Micro Design are
now working on a gadtools interface for the best commodity on earth.


 As you can imagine, this is going to take a while. But we have already
planned the categorisation and layout, and coding will begin very soon
(current date 14.8.98). The new MultiCX Prefs should be uploaded to
AmiNet when done, and will almost certainly be submitted for inclusion
on a future Amiga Format cover CD. Keep an eye peeled and keep spitting
blood every time the M word is mentioned - Yuk, Yuk. spit, spit, spit...

 Future updates on our progress can be found at our rather sad looking
web page. Point them at@{fg highlight} http://www.dream.u-net.com/ @{fg text}and try not to 
notice that we can't be bothered doing any work on the site.
@endnode
@node "The Club" "`I think MUI stinks' - fight it to the bitter end, my friends"

 Just send us an @{" email " link "Contact"} telling us how much you dislike MUI. Once we
have collected enough we will use them as backing for an appeal to have
the author shot. If you've lost your grip even more than we have, then
you may also suggest a few amusing forms of punishment appropriate for
such a foul crime. Volunteer executioners need not apply, we have first
refusal on the role.
