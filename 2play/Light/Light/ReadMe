 Light Speed © 1998 Micro Design¹

 A light cycles game with a few nice features that runs on a pubscreen,
programmed in AmigaE. Not too bad, even if we do say so ourselves, and
only £3 shareware registration fee, or one of several suggested gifts.

The program runs from absolutely any location, just click on the icon.
(kick 37+ required - see below)

For full details of the game, requirements, the Micro Design label and
registration consult the `LightSpeed.guide' which can be found with the
program.
