JEERS TO@

COMMODORE@
  * For managing to go bankrupt despite@
  owning one the most popular computers@
  in the late '80s.                    @
  * For releasing the A1200 2 years too@
  late.                                @
 @
MICROSOFT@
  * For pretending PC's are friendly,@
  nice machines that anyone can use  @
  for buisness, education and games. @
  Not, for example, cumbersome       @
  over-priced machines with shoddy   @
  1950's architecture and staggering @
  compatibility problems.            @
