@ENDNODE

@NODE RM_COMP "Amiga Compatibility?"
    Well, in theory it should work any Amiga with at least 1MB.
  In practice however, things are far less pleasant.
    It only works on Amiga's with 1MB+ and requires at least a
  Kickstart of 2.0 or more. Anything less than that then the Amiga does
  it's guru thang and sulks in a corner.
    Whether this has anything to do with Blitz or my programming I don't
  honestly know.

  What I @{" recommend " LINK rm_rec} you play it on however, is a different story.

    Also bear in mind It's been a while since I tested this on other
  machines. Last I tried it worked on the A600 and A1200.

    If you are using this on an Amiga Emulator such as UAE I'm afraid
  it won't work due to it's unfinished parallel port emulation. It always
  regards players 3 and 4 as constantly holding fire. Perhaps this will
  improve in future releases. Here's hoping.

    @{" Troubleshooting " LINK rm_shit}
@ENDNODE

@NODE RM_SHIT "GOD DAMN!"
  What, it won't load. Then I've just wasted my time sending you this!

  Well... there are a few things you can try.

*   Close down everything you don't really need. (External drives ect..)
*   Make sure you have installed the files from INSTALLME.lha

    If that fails then I'm sorry, but do me the favour of sending me
  an @{"e-mail" LINK rm_simon} saying so. Tell me what your system is and whenabouts the
  game crashed (if it loaded).
    I'll do my best to fix it and send it back.

@ENDNODE

@NODE RM_INSTALL "Hard Disk Installation"
  Hard Disk Installation:

    Well, obviously it's unpacked or you wouldn't be reading this now.
  There are still two things to do however.

*  Uarchive INSTALLME.lha to the RAM: disk or other temporary location.
*  Copy the contents of FONTS: to your own font drawer. (I know, sorry)
*  Copy to LIBS: any libraries that you don't already own.

  If you followed everything right that should be it.
Double click on the Murder Icon and wait for the fun to begin.

@ENDNODE

@NODE RM_HIST "Programmer's History"
    The game began life a long while ago due to the laziness of a friend
  of mine @{"Angus Arthur" LINK rm_credits} who refused to do anything
  with a great two player game of his called Kill each other Violently.
    It was also due in part to a PD offering called Extreme Violence.
  The games in themselves were good but could have been so much more
    I decided this could be improved upon and began to write my own AMOS.

    This was quickly scrapped. As friendly as AMOS BASIC is I'd have been
  better off writing it in Speccy BASIC thanks to it's chronic speed. The
  game slowed down on 2 players before a single shot was fired. This
  failure was quickly scrapped.

    Then about a year later I bought the God-Like Blitz Basic 2 and my
  prayers were answered. At the end of '94 I began work on Cold Blooded
  Murder.
    Since than I've spent about 4 or 5 hours a week tinkering with it.
  It really has grown into something rather unexpected. I never expected
  it to be nearly as good as it turned out to be.


@ENDNODE

@NODE RM_THANKS "Thank you to..."
Here is an extra special thanks to the following,

* Angus Arthur.
    My friend who is responsible for 4 of the scenes in this game. (The 
  Church, The Clouds, The Castle and the Smurf Village.)
    Angus is very talented when working with 2D graphics of any kind and 
  is also a talented blitz programmer. Even when working with Murder's 
  hideous restriction of 16 colours he still managed to make these
  impressive scenes. If you'd like more examples of his work, or are
  looking to hire an artist/prgrammer
    @{FG FILL}Contact him at:@{FG TEXT} angusmarthur@yahoo.co.uk
    Angus also wrote the game which I originally based Cold Blooded Murder
  upon. I spent an age trying to convince him to improve upon this rather
  fun game but he wouldn't. At the end of '94 I decided I'd do the
  job for him. So technically this game wouldn't exist without him.
  Go angus!

* Kevin Robison
    Apparently the biggest fan of the game and also responsible for
  the Golf course scene. He is quite an inspiration.
  (But don't tell him that).

* Eggy
    A friend of Kevin's who wrote some music for me to use in the game.
  As good as it was, it was too techno for this game.

  and of course thanks to my many friends who played the game, thanks
for the support and ideas. It's your feedback that makes the game as good
as it is.
@ENDNODE

@NODE RM_REC "Recommended gear"
  For a truly great game you need the following,

*   2MB Chip RAM
      On 1MB there is no room for Sound Effects. God Damn, that's one of
    the most impressive bits of this game. Go and buy an expansion right
    now.

*   68020 Processer
      Without a piece of kit that runs at least 14 M/hz your 4 & 5 player
    games will run at horrible speeds. You also lose out on many snazzy
    effects like spraying blood and teleport sparkles.

*   AGA chipset
      Without this your game will lose much of it's atmosphere. The
    chipset will give you nicer loading screens, smoother animations and
    best of all gorgeous fade effects, including the bright flashes from
    explosive weapons.

*   Four Player Adaptor
      This is a cheap bit of wire that dangles out the Parallel port.
    This is ESSENTIAL for a truly good game of Murder.
    3 player games are as nothing to the chaos of a 5 player game of
    5 evenly matched players.

*  Four Good Joysticks
     It's not much fun being stuck on a mates old Atari 2600 joystick.
   Try to make sure everyone is comfortable with their controller. Make
   your friends bring their favourite joysticks from home, why should you
   fork out.
     You'd also better hope that at least one of you are comfortable on
   keyboard. Probably the ex-Speccy owner will fit this category.

*  A bloody great big Stereo
     Preferably a powerful one through which explosions can rumble.
   The music isn't up to much, but the sound is something I am very
   proud of. It fits the manic pace of the game nicely. From the pained
   screams of each player to the deep roar of a flame thrower it's
   all rather splendid in stereo.

*  A bloody great big Monitor
     All the graphics were drawn on a monitor, and the game is best
   appreciated on a monitor. The smaller bullets are difficult to spot
   on the fuzz of a TV set.

*  A Hard Disk
     Obviously, and if you don't own one you deserve to wallow in your
   slow access times.

* 1MB Fast RAM
     Not only do 020 owners get a couple of extra effects but the game
   never slows down, no matter what massive destruction is occurring
   on screen. Slow-down is rare on a vanilla A1200 but it happens.

*  Four good losers
     Murder is one of those amazingly competitive games that can annoy
   everyone involved.


    If you have all of these, I refuse to believe you do not enjoy this
  game.
@ENDNODE

@NODE RM_BUGS "Known Bugs"
  The mere mention of a bug is enough to make a programmer shiver.

    Almost every game has 'em, and this is no different.

*  Very occasionally a player will find himself able to shoot far more
   often than is normal. I've no idea why. This happens most often with
   the Xenon Laser.

*  Williams, the Red Player, is not always red. Due to the surreal
   AGA sprite handling the Amiga decides to fetch his palette from
   some unknown place in the memory rather than the usual registers.
   This happens at odd times, and with no change to the code.

*  Sometime the shop will just refuse to sell items no matter how much
   money a player has.

*  Once in a blue moon the system will simply crash. This is the most
   annoying bug of the lot, I have no idea why it does this.

  That's all I know about. @{"e-mail" LINK rm_simon} if you find others.

@{B}DISCLAIMER@{UB}
  If anyone is responsible for a piece of music or graphics used in the
game please @{"contact me" LINK rm_simon}. Sorry to use such things without permission but is
a free game after all. Send me your details and I'll add your name to
the credits.
  The Psycho on the title screen is from another PD game which I long
since lost. Sorry, I can't give that talented artist the credit he
deserves.
  The Suburban Commando's scene is blatantly based on Trashman, though
I doubt anyone really cares nowadays.

@ENDNODE

@NODE RM_PLAY "Player's Guide"

  * Most importantly, don't be near a wall when you are shot. If you have
    nowhere to move you take the full force of whatever weapon hits you.
    This is usually devastating.

  * Learn what the power-ups are. The difference between good and bad
    weapons is the difference between winning and losing.

  * Avoid thin tunnels and dead ends as you can easily be pinned down by
    most weapons.

  * Only use highly explosive weapons in open space.

  * Don't be too close to a wall when firing. Certain things can detonate
    in your face.

  * Watch your back. A common tactic is for a third player to sneak up
    on two people fighting and kill them both when their energy is low.

    That's about it. The rest you can learn for yourself. Everyone has
  slightly different tactics when they play so try to learn your what
  your opponents are likely to do. Oh and be sure and have fun.
