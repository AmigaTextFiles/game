This is a fun two player game. It is also my first ever amiga game, and
in my stupidity, I deleted the source code. So don't ask me to fix any
bugs, add something or anything like that, because I can't! (I also
deleted the map editor, Grrr!)

A list of apoligies about the game, all of which could easily be fixed
if I had the source code :

   It's very slow. Sorry!
   The terrible menu screens. Sorry!
   The incredibly slow loading of levels (use a hard disk). Sorry!
   Can't quit from the program. Sorry!
   There are some terrible levels. Sorry!

Instructions :

   Kill each other.
