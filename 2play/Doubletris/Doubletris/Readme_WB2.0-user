To all WB2.0 users:

Doubletris uses the asl-screenmode requester since Kick2.04. But the
WB2.0 asl.library hasn't this function. I don't know how it will
behave, because I don't have WB2.0 anylonger. If doesn't start then
create a tooltype entry:

SCREENMODE=00029000H (for a PAL display)
SCREENMODE=00019000H (for a NTSC display).
