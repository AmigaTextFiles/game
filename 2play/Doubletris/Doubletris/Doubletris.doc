WHAT IS IT?

  Doubletris is a Tetris-Clone for two players, who play simultanously in
one playfield. There is also a computer player, but its playing skill is
very bad. Doubletris isn't only able to run in multitasking, it is also
the only possibility.

DECLARATION

  Because I enhanced the idea of Tetris, I want this program distributed as
FREEWARE. (COPYRIGHT look down)

INTRODUCTION AND INTENTION

  I started to do Doubletris three years ago, because I learnt
objectoriented programming in school. I learnt Oberon-2. The nature of this
language let me think about a completly objectoriented implementation. So I
started in winter '93. While developing the program I suffered many
setbacks, which weren't so easy to take. But finally it is done.

SYSTEMCONFIGURATION

  Doubletris was developed using following configuration:

A500 1MB Chip ECS Kickstart 1.3, 2.04 (WB 2.1), 3.1
A590 SCSI-Controller, 1MB Fast-Ram, 120MB Quantum-HD,
Toshiba XM4101 CD-Rom, Mikronik-Mini-Tower
sometimes a Harms 030-Turboboard :-((

  Doubletris was tested on following systems:

see above
A500 1MB Chip 8MB Fast G-Force 040 (M-Tec) 1080 MB IBM, Toshiba 3601
     Kick 3.1
A500 1MB Chip 8MB Fast GVP-SerieII-SCSI-Controller 127MB Quantum OS2.1
     Harms 030+
A2000 1MB Chip 6MB Fast A2630 Apollo-HD-Controller Tandem-AT-Controller
     Retina-Graficboard
A2000 1MB Chip 5MB Fast GVP-SerieII-SCSI-Controller 270MB-HD OS2.1

  Mininmal system configuration:

An Amiga with 512KByte Ram, OS1.2 (Wasn't tested, but should run.)
I suggest a Amiga using Kick 2.04+. It should have at least 1MB of Ram for
Doubletris to preload the soundmodules.

(FIRST) START

  At the first start using KS2.04+ a screenmode-requester should appear
(If this isn't so, look in the TOOLTYPES-chapter 'SCREENMODE'). You now
should choose your favorite screenresolution to start Doubletris in. After
that a black screen should appear saying the following:
"Trying to load all sound-modules (for speed)!"
Doubletris now tries to load all soundmodules named in the tooltype.
(Because of juristical reason no soundmoduls are included.) After that a
Menu should appear.

MENU

  The menu is main interface of Doubletris, where you are able to
manipulate some parameters of the game. The icons have following meanings:

                    DOUBLETRIS

     c      =     "      "  down
     space  =     "    rotates

(***) This arrow can be moved using the cursorkeys, space und return will
      select. It is used when the mousepointer can't be controlled,
      because a joystick has been plugged in port 1.

(****) The soundroutines are imported from Octamed. They allocate all 
       soundchannels, therefore it is impossible to play FX.

Example:
  If you want to play a one-player-game using a mouse in port 2, you have
to disactivate (this means: it has to be crossed with red lines) the
PL1-Field and then activate the mouse icons in the second line. After that
you only have to click "Start".

THE GAME

  The Screen is divide into many parts.

  The attention will be on the playfield. The elements can be moved the
same way as in Tetris. If you don't know it, try it! If choosing "down",
the parts will get faster.

Score
Eyery new element is one point.
Every complete line is deleted and is worth 10 points to the player.
If 2 lines are deleted at once, 30 points will be scored,
3 lines are worth, 60 points and
4 will add 100 points to player's score.

KEYS WHILE PLAYING

  While playing some keys have special meanings:

P   - pause = Doubletris will get paused. All colors turn grey and after a
              short mousemove the pointer will be shown. Because of
              Doubletris' multitasking abitlity, you can simultaneously 
              play Doubletris and render a picture in your raytracer. This
              means you don't have to quit Doubletris to check the
              raytracer, simply press P and then left Amiga and 'N' will
              switch the screens. A mouseclick on the Doubletris-screen
              will reactivate it immediately.

M   - music = Switches music on or off. If music is activated, while FX
              is running, the latter will be turned off. If you don't like
              the actual sound, type 'M' twice to change the soundmodule.

F   - FX    = Switches FX on or off. If FX gets activated, while the music
              is playing, it will be deactivated.

Esc - stop  = Quits the game.

Help- help  = Toggles the preview-funktion.

TOOLTYPES

  Doubletris uses some tooltypes to change the internal configuration. The
following tooltype are searched:

  SCREENMODE   - This tooltype is automaticaly generated on systems
   =xxxxxxxxH    using at least OS2.04. It is generated, when choosing a
                 screenmode. The numbers in this tooltype are
                 systeminternally. Don't edit them, if you don't know 100
                 percent waht you are doing. If you want Doubletris to use
                 a different screenmode, simply delete this tooltype. You
                 should also have a look at the Sprite-tooltype. This one
                 only has sense on machines having a pal or ntsc-monitor,
                 on all other it will do some scratch.

  SPRITES      - Shows if hardware-sprites are used. This tooltype has
   =ON/OFF       been implemented, because some graficboards and
                 displaymodes can't display hardware-sprites. If sprites
                 are disabled the elements will be drawn using
                 graphics.library functions. This will lead to problems on
                 slower maschines, because the elements are cleared and
                 then completly redrawn. The result is a flickering. You
                 have to try, which option gives the better result on your
                 maschine.

  FX           - This tooltype manipulates the status of the FX-button on
   =ON/OFF       the main menu. But this option will only be watched,
                 when the music is switched off or the sound couldn't be
                 loaded. (see MUSIC AND FX)

  MUSIC        - Switches the music on or off at program start.
   =ON/OFF       Nevertheless, the modules will be loaded. So a 'MUSIC=OFF'
                 doesn't ensure that the modules will not be loaded.

  INTROMODULE  - You have to state the name of the module, that you
   =name         want to be played whenever the menu is shown,
                 here. (see MUSIC AND FX)

  MAINMODULEx  - This set of tooltypes name the soundmodules, that can 
   =name         be played during the game. The x is a variable
                 ranging from 1 to 5. Simply type the names of the
                 soundmodules that you want to use during the game behind
                 the tooltypes MAINMODULE1 to MAINMODULE5. (see MUSIC AND
                 FX)

  ENDMODULE    - Look at INTROMODULE. The module named here will be played
   =name         at the end of the game. (see MUSIC AND FX)

  PREVIEW      - With this tooltype you decide, wether or not the preview
                 function is activated at the program's start.

  (WINDOW)     - This tooltype has no use to Doubletris. The runtimesystem
                 of the Oberon-2 searches for this. I only mentioned it to
                 beware owners of Snoopdos :-) of sleepless nights.

  In the tooltypedescription a =ON/OFF identifies a boolean-tooltype. This
tooltypes have only two valid states ON or OFF. There are replacments for
ON and OFF. They are YES for ON and NO for OFF.

 "=name" means that you have to type in a filename here. Relativ and 
absolut filenames may be used here. For those people, who don't know about
absolut and relativ filenames, here are some examples:

//Sounds/mod.Hello  relativ
df0:test            absolut
dh0:trashcan/test   absolut
Mod.IntroModule     relativ

MUSIC AND FX

  At a certain position of the development, I decided that Doubletris
couldn't stay quiet. So I looked for possibilities to play sounds. I found
the OctaMed package. There are some functions that can be freely used for
playing sound modules. THANK YOU! The disadvantage of these routines are,
that they allocate all soundchannels and so the simultanious play of
soundeffects was made impossible. But I think that doesn't matter.
The next question is: How can you play your own songs in Doubletris?
  Doubletris loads all soundsmodules from disc. They have to be MED-Files.
There are already many MED-songs in the PD. But they CAN'T get loaded
directly. You first have to convert them to MED-Modules. Get the OctaMed
package (available on Fish840), load the song and save it. OctaMed now
shows a menu where you have to choose "MED-Module". That's it. The only
thing you have to do is type the modulename in the tooltype-field of your
choice. So if you want another intromodule simply change the name behind
the INTROMODULE-tooltype. Beware of the copyright of the song author.

  The enclosed ones were taken from the CDPD1. The copyrights of course
remain with the songproducers. If someone sees his copyright not protected,
write me and the module will be deleted in the following distributions.

HIGHSCORES

  The highscores are only saved if they have changed and by leaving the
program correctly using the Exit-button. This has been done to minimize
writeaccesses of the disc. Some people wondered, when they first saw the
highscores of Doubletris. There are three tables. The upper ones are used
for two-player-games. In the one on the left their scores are marked down
seperately, while the one on the right containes the combined score. The
table in lower half is used for one-player-games.

JURISTICAL

  I can't be made responsible for any damage Doubletris will do. Don't
blame me, if this program fromats your harddisc. You are using this program
on your own risk. If you give access to your harddisc and it destroyes it,
it is your own fault. You should never give an unknown software access to
your harddisc (isn't it right, Albi?) I also can't be made liable, if this
software doesn't work the way it is supposed to.

  Doubletris is Freeware. The copyright of original Tetris is reserved.
I hold the copyright of Doubletris.

  ATTENTION !!

  Only the following pd-series are allowed to distribute Doubletris:
Fish-serie espcially on the FreshFish-CDs. SaarAG/Amok and on their
CD-Roms. Doubletris also may be distributed using the Aminet and their
CD-Roms. The distribution on discs that will cost more than $4 US-dollar
is not allowed.

SOURCECODE

  Doubletris was developed using Oberon-2. The compiler was AmigaOberon3.2 
of A+L Ag. Furthermore the following programs were used to develop it:
A68k, MICE, OctaMed and PPaint.

  Doubletris is almost completely written objectoriented.

  It has 28 Modules, 170 KByte sourcecode and approximatly 6100 lines.

  If you want to get the code, send me an envelope, a disc and some money
to send it back. You may also get the code from the Amok-Club. I will
offer it to them and they may put it on their discs.

GREETING AND THANKS

  Greetings will go to God and the whole world.

  Furthermore I have to thank Michael Albrecht for his continuos help and
his help fixing a blown PCB-wire, my cousin Klaus Vehreschild, without
his help the elements would still rotate incorrectly. Also, I have to thank
my infromatic teacher Werner Ueding, who taught me Oberon and the
objectorientet programming methods, as well as the betatesters who had the
courage to put this program on their harddiscs. Another "Thank you!" has to
go to Klaus-Henning von Restorff, for checking this manual and not loosing
the will to correct all mistakes (there were many!).

BYE !

  Amiga for ever. :-)
