<b><u>TECHNICAL INFO<BR>
</b></u>
<BR>
TOADIES was written using BlitzBasic 2 from Acidsoft. The sourcecode is very badly written, so it`s not a good idea to have a look at it for educational reasons.
If you are interested anyway you can contact me and ask me for the sourcecode.<BR>
The graphics are done in Deluxe Paint IV and Personal Paint 7.1.<BR>
The sounds are ripped from many sources and edited with Samplemanager, a
sound processing package written by myself (I never released Samplemanager, but take a look at 
<a href="http://hd-rec.online.de/index_nobanner.html" target="_top">HD-Rec</a>, an audio/MIDI sequencer written by myself too).
