<b><u>THE GAME<BR>
</b></u>
<BR>

<h3><b>Starting</B></H3>
Doubleclick the WB-icon or start it from Shell.<BR>
Then this menu appears:
<UL>
      <li><A href="#play">   Play          </a></li>
      <li><A href="#teams">     Edit Teams    </a></li>         
      <li><A href="#options">   Game Options  </a></li>
      <li><A href="#statistics">   Statistics    </a></li>      
      <li><A href="#about">   About         </a></li>
      <li><A href="#quit">          Quit          </a></li>
</UL>
You can use the up and down keys
or the mouse to step through the menu items and 
space or left mousebutton to activate a menuitem. All following
menus operate like this.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<a name="play"><h3><b>Play</b></h3></a>
Another menu appears where you can
select the teams who should fight. You can use space or right key
to activate a team and left key to deactive a team.
You can choose up to 4 teams, but at least 2 teams. Otherwise you
come back to the main menu.<BR>
<BR>
Now the level will be rendered. This takes about 5 secs on a 68060,
so be a bit patient if you only have a 020.<BR>
<BR>
The Battle begins ...<BR>
Each team has 4 toadies with 100 energy points for each toadie. The game is played round by round. Only one
toadie can move in one round. If a round is done (weapon fired, time out
or something stupid happened) the next toadie of the next team can move and so on.
Your aim is to kill all toadies of the other teams and survive with at last one toadie.
A toadie can die three ways:
<ul>
<li>no more energy</li>
<li>falling into the water</li>
<li>pushed out of the playfield</li>
</ul>
Holding down the left mousebutton you can scroll through the playfield and become on overview where your
enemies are. If you whish to select a weapon go down to the infobar and press left mousebutton. Then a menu
of 10 weapons appears. If you press left mousebutton once again another 10 weapons/utilities
appear.
To reach your goal you have the following weapons:<BR>
<BR>
<img src="pics/w_bazuka.gif" width="30" height="28">- Bazuka<BR>
Only weapon that is unlimited availabe. You can fire a missile that causes
some damage.<BR>
<BR>
<img src="pics/w_airstrike.gif" width="34" height="30">- Airstrike<BR>
Click where you want and this area will be bombed from the sky (your own toadies included).<BR>
<BR>
<img src="pics/w_shotgun.gif" width="32" height="31">- Shotgun<BR>
You can fire two times, and you can move between your shots.<BR>
<BR>
<img src="pics/w_homing.gif" width="30" height="29">- Homing Missile<BR>
Like Bazuka, but first you can mark where it should go. Powerful weapon.<BR>
<BR>
<img src="pics/w_dynamite.gif" width="35" height="34">- Dynamite<BR>
Place it near your enemies and run away. It has the strongest explosion of all weapons.<BR>
<BR>
<img src="pics/w_mines.gif" width="28" height="30">- Mine<BR>
Place it near your enemies or put it where your enemies should not go. It
only explodes if someone comes close, like the mines that are placed at the beginning of
the game. Mines canalso be moved with the shitgun or explosions, so be careful !<BR>
<BR>
<img src="pics/w_drone.gif" width="33" height="32">- Drone<BR>
A bit difficult. It is launched above you and you can accelerate it with space or
shift key. With the left/right keys or x/y you can rotate it 360 degrees. Now you
are able to navigate it where you want and drop it. If you can handle this weapon
(it is difficult !) it is very powerful, because you can navigate to
areas, where a homingmissile couldn`t go.<BR>
<BR>
<img src="pics/w_light.gif" width="33" height="33">- Light Switch<BR>
Switches the light off until it is your turn again ;-)<BR>
After you have used this you can still move and use another weapon.<BR>
<BR>
<img src="pics/w_ninja.gif" width="34" height="28">- Ninja Rope<BR>
Powerful tool to move in difficult areas. You can shoot it into the celling
and drag yourself up or put it into the floor und pull you up.<BR>
(For those who know worms: you can fall in both directions if you have put it into the floor)<BR>
You can use the left and right keys to gain some speed, up and down keys to increase/decrease 
the length of the rope.
Press Enter to goback to norma walking. 
<BR>
<img src="pics/w_protection.gif" width="32" height="30">- Protection<BR>
It fires a lot of crystals above you that will protect you from missiles or other weapons. Be sure not to stand below something, as the
crystals can hurt or kill your toadie very much.<BR>

<BR>
<img src="pics/w_punch.gif" width="36" height="30">- Power Punch<BR>
Good thing to kick someone into the water or into a mine.<BR>
<BR> 
<img src="pics/w_cluster.gif" width="32" height="32">- Cluster Bomb<BR>
Thow it ! Small explosion but out of this explosion come 5 other bombs. With the keys 1,2,3,4,5 you can set
the time for exploding.<BR>
<BR>
<img src="pics/w_multilauncher.gif" width="34" height="33">- Multilauncher<BR>
It launches a lot of fireballs at the same destination. Try it !<BR>
<BR>
<img src="pics/w_earthquake.gif" width="29" height="29">- Earthquake<BR>
It shakes the island and makes it sink a bit. Don`t use it too often and make sure
that your own toadies are save from falling into water or don`t stand near mines ;-)<BR>
<BR>
<img src="pics/w_medipack.gif" width="33" height="31">- Medipack<BR>
The toadie gains 50 point of energy but looses a move.<BR>
<BR>
<img src="pics/w_bubble.gif" width="29" height="29">- Soap Bubble<BR>
The toadie gets into a soap bubble and can fly through the level using the left/right keys 
until he crashes, flies too high or the players presses enter.<BR>
<BR>
<img src="pics/w_digger.gif" width="32" height="31">- Digger<BR>
Switch it on and walk through walls or into the floor ...<BR>
<BR>
<img src="pics/w_flamer.gif" width="32" height="35">- Flame Thrower<BR>
Good thing if an enemy-toadie is captured in a small hole where it can`t move away.<BR>
<BR>
<img src="pics/w_teleport.gif" width="30" height="30">- Teleport<BR>
Click where you want and you will be teleported to this location.<BR>
<BR>
<img src="pics/w_surrender.gif" width="35" height="29">- Surrender<BR>
Guess again.<BR>
<BR>
Sometimes an airplane comes and drops a weapon-boost. You have to collect it with
one of your toadies to boost one of your weapons. Don`t shot it, unless you want
to see a big explosion.
<BR>
<BR>
<a name="teams"><h3><b>Edit Teams</b></h3></a>
Here you can create/edit and delete teams.<BR>
You have some credits and can buy weapons. If you start a battle
with this team you have all these weapons from the start. Buy them
whisely ...<BR>
You can also give names for the four toadies and a name for the team.
If you have finished (you should buy as much weapons as you can) save the
team with the save option. If the team already exists, it will be overwritten.
With the load option you can select an exisiting team, edit it and resave it.
To buy/sell a weapons just use the left/right keys - that`s it.
