REQUIREMENTS:<BR><BR>
</b></u>
Hardware:<br>
Any Amiga with at least 2MB chip and 4MB fast RAM. But don`t expect
this game running smooth on an 68000. All I can say it runns well 
with all features enabled on my 68060/50MHz, but a 68030 should do it with some
effects disabled.<br><br>
If you are running this game under WinUAE anything below Pentium II / 300Mhz
makes no sense.<BR><BR>
! You should have ca. 1.5 MB of free chipram, otherwise it could crash !<BR>
Also you should not run it unless you have saved your work you might have
done before one your machine. Expect that TOADIES trashes your memory.
<BR>
<BR>
Software:<BR>
No special software is required, except some system libraries like
the math libs (I think).
