Because I did many changes I decided to jump to version 8.0. Changes:<br>
<ul>
<li>now you can`t fall as deep as you like with your toadie 
<li>fixed some serious bugs that could crash the machine
<li>added those nice bubbles when something drops into the water
<li>added option to select the number of particles an explosion causes
<li>sounds are a bit more dynamic, they vary randomly in their pitch
<li>improved behaviour of Toadies and mines again
<li>improved the edit teams option slightly
<li>improved some weapons and optimized their prices
<li>improved the levels again
<li>new skin &quot;Jungle&quot;
</ul>
I uploaded this to Aminet. I also found a bug in the game which causes the machine crash after some rounds. I didn`t manage to
fix this as it is a bug in BlitzBasic2. I have to rewrite this command using my own assembler routine, but I haven`t had the time for this yet.

There is a survey at the <a href="http://online-club.de/~ARENA/" target="_top">Amiga ARENA</a> where you can vote for this game if it should become
shareware so I can put more time into this project and add a computer player for registered users.

Here is a new version of Toadies:<br>
<ul>
<li>improved the leveleditor
<li>improved heavily the behaviour of the toadies and the mines
<li>added overscan option (beta)
<li>improved edit team option
<li>improved homing missile
<li>made the flamethrower and the earthquake more fair
<li>changed some prices of weapons
<li>&quot;rotating bug&quot; is gone now
<li>mine-is-invisible-after-earthquake-bug is gone now
<li>new skin &quot;cheese&quot;
<li>changed a few exisiting sounds
<li>added time-out sound
<li>added fieb! sound for the airstrike
<li>improved mousepointer
<li>fixed graphics bug in weapon menu
<li>free memory check, loads low quality sounds when chipmem is low
<li>enhanced the doc and this homepage (which is nearly the doc)
<li>fixed tonns of small bugs
<li>plus some other suff I forgot (phew!)
</ul>
There are still some bugs left, so it is a good idea to reboot after playing. It also crashes
sometimes during the game. Don`t run anything in the background, especially tasks which have
disk access, as it disables multitasking.<br>

<TR><TD bgcolor="#bbbbbb"><font face="helvetica,arial" size="3"><b>18.02.2001</b> - New features were requested</font></TD></TR>
<TR><TD><font face="helvetica,arial" size="2">
The following features were requested:
<ul>
<li><b>computer player</B><BR>
Many people ask me about a computer player. I already tried this in 1997 but they played too stupid and calculated. Because
of this, I decided to remove this feature when I uploaded it to Aminet. The game should be played by 2 human players anyway, most fun 
it is with 3 or 4 players.<BR> 
It is a bit difficult to implement this, because the toadies need a kind of intelligence. Maybe I will implement this
when I have the time, but don`t expect this feature in the near future (sorry).</li>
<li><b>overscan / screenmode selector</b><BR>
The game engine is based on planar graphics, so it is impossible to implement things like graphicscard support without a complete
rewrite. What I can do is an overscan option, which will be included in the next version.
</li>
<li><b>better behaviour of toadies</b><br>
I know that the toadies bounce off a wall not very realitic and you can not count on that they slide down a hill into the water like
it is in the real worms game. I will enhance this in the next version too.
</li>
<li><b>run it on a A500 with 512K chip and 1 MB fast ...</b><BR>
No way ! Sorry, but you can not have all these sounds, graphics, sprites and big playfields on a low spec machine. What I can do
is a check for free memory and for the CPU speed to that things in option menu are predefined for your machine.
It might be possible to run it on a 68020 14 Mhz CPU, 1 MB Chip and 2MB fast, maybe. This will also be included in the next version.
</li>
<li><b>more skins ...</b><BR>
OK, I will make one more skin in the next version. What about you ? See &quot;how to make your own skins&quot; !
Send me your skins, and I will include them in the next version.</li>

Because there was so much resonance on this game I decided to make a (temporary) newspage.
At this place I will write about new features and updates.
