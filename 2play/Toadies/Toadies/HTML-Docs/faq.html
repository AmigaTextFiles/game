FAQ:<BR><BR>
</b></u>
<b>When will a computer player be added ?</b><br>
I have not the time to do this until the game is freeware. There is
a survey at the <a href="http://online-club.de/~ARENA/" target="_top">Amiga ARENA</a>
where you can vote for this game. If there are enough users who
want to register if this game would go shareware I can do a computer player option,
which will only be available for registered users.<br>
<br>
<b>Does this game run under Cybergraphix or on a PC Monitor ?</b><br>
As this game makes heavily use of the Amigas custom chips like the Copper
and the Blitter it is not possible to run it on a system friendly screen
or even on a Cybergraphix screen without a complete rewrite.
If you have a PC monitor which usually does not scan below 30kHz you will need
a scandoubler module for your graphicscard.<br>Sorry folks !<br><br>
<b>Does it run on a A500 with 512K chip and 1 MB fast ? </b><br>
No way ! Sorry, but you can not have all these sounds, graphics, sprites and big playfields on a low 
spec machine. I have checked this and it is not possible to run it with 1MB chip.
If it runs too slow, try to disable the watereffect, rocket dust, explosion particles.
<br><br>

<b>Will there be more updates ?</b><br>
Everything I wanted to change I did in the Version 8.0. If you mail me
your suggestions or bug reports I will make more updates, otherwise
I think everybody is happy with this game. Maybe I will do some bugfixes
because there are still a lot of bugs in the game.
