@node Main "HellShot, The Game for Amiga"

@{fg highlight}HellShot@{fg text} is a game made by the @{"HellHound SoftWare Group" link HHSG}
for Amiga only. 
It's requires an Amiga 1200/4000 with at least 4 Megabytes of RAM, and a
PAL monitor to play it.
Please keep yourselves tuned to our site on the Internet, to know more
about us, and our projects. HellCoder has a FTP site on his homepage,
so keep a bookmark there too.

@node HHSG "The HellHound SoftWare Group"
The HellHound SoftWare Group consists of 3 guyz.
Lord Semtex, HellCoder and Protogon.
The job description always was :

Lord Semtex - Music
HellCoder - Coder
Protogon - GFX,

but things changed a bit. HellCoder just keeps on coding, and for us, LSemtex
and Protogon, we're just not able to keep up with him.
So we've managed to deaccelerate HellCoder a bit, giving us a bit more
time to finish our end of job, and producing one final thing, with all
the best bits in it.
Lord Semtex also does a bit of GFX now, and you'll see more work from him
on our next projects and releases.

Check our site for more details on us and our work :

http:/hellhound.nl.eu.org

It's in our old style, we'll be upgrading it soon to something a bit better.

HellCoder has got his own site :

http://hellhound.nl.eu.org/~hcoder

Protogon has got one too, but don't bother to look there :):

http://hellhound.nl.eu.org/~proto

Lord Semtex hasn't got his own site, because he is the administrator
of the site, has a lot to do besides making his own personal page,
and sees the mainpage of the server his own, because he made that.
