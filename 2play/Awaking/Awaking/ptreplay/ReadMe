This is ptreplay.library version 5. It is a standard Amiga shared library,
capable of replaying ProTracker modules.
The replay routines are 100% system-friendly¹, and use CIA timing, which
gives a smoother replaying.

Use this library as you would use any normal Amiga library. Included in
this package is include files for Assembler, C and E.

I wrote this library because I was unable to find a _good_ and system-
friendly replay routine for ProTracker. I based this loosely on the 
example sources that accompany ProTracker, but these were pretty badly
written, and sparsly commented, and the CIA routines did never work on
my machine. A job worth doing well is worth doing yourself, I though
and went to work. This is what emerged, a small library. Notice that it
is just about 7k, and still contains all needed to play good music.

Changes from 4.20 to 5.12
-------------------------
* New fully automated channel allocation system!!!!!

* New functions (2) for easy control over the channel allocation system.

* New routine to change the current playpos.

* New routines to turn single channels on/off.

* FadeDone didn't send you the right signal.

* Gave enforcerhits if you tried to load a file shorter than 1084 bytes.

* Removed the beeping sound that could be heared on some modules.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
¹ Yes it is now 100% system friendly because of the new fully automated
  channel-allocations routines that uses audio.device and will block
  ptreplay/other from producing sound instead of both trying to use the
  same channel which gives you a very bad sound output.
