In the event that enough interest is shown in this game, I will write an
artificial intelligence, so you won't necessarily have to find another
person to play.  Also, I have plans to make Tactrix! II, which would have
more strange pieces, and would generally be further from chess in play
mechanics.

This program is © HCGD, except the stuff in the l directory, which is
© Absoft.  The l directory contains the run-time libraries for the Absoft
AC/BASIC Compiler.  This archive is freely distributable, so long as all
files remain intact.

To install the game, just drop everything into one directory, with the
exception of the l directory.  Copy these files to your l: directory if you
are using hard disk, or just put l in the root directory of the floppy you
intend to run it from.  Then double click the Tactrix! icon.  Make sure
FastMemFirst is executed before you run it, either by you or in your
startup-sequence.  It runs noticably faster if you do.  I've heard there are
problems if your workbench font isn't set to Topaz, but there are definitely
problems if you are set for 60 column mode, rather than 80 column mode.

If you have any questions or comments I can be reached by e-mail at:

How to play

 General Rules

  Players take turns moving their pieces on a 10x10 board.  To capture an
  opponent's piece, just land on it.  All of the empty squares at the
  beginning of the game have chips in them.  By moving onto these, you
  collect them; they do not regenerate.  You can purchase new pieces with
  these chips.


 The Interface

  Just click the piece you want to move, then click the square you want to
  move it to.

  For information about a piece, you can click the Tutor button, followed by
  clicking the piece you want to know about.  Tutor will tell you the name
  of the piece, how much it costs to buy, and all of its current legal moves
  will be highlighted on the board.  Use Tutor to figure out which pieces
  are which when you first play.  The Tutor also works on your opponent's
  pieces.

  When it is your turn, just click the Buy button to purchase a new piece.
  The Dialog box will give further instructions.

  Clicking New twice will start a new game, and clicking Quit twice will
  exit the program.

  Clicking Load or Save will initiate the Load or Save sequences; you will
  be asked for the device and directory first, then for the name of the
  game file.  For example, "df0:games/" would work for the  device and
  directory, and "Game1" would work for the filename.  Tactrix! will
  automatically add ".tac" to the filename when both loading and  saving.
  Make sure you remember to add the trailing "/" when specifying a
  directory.  At either prompt you can just hit retrun to cancel load or
  save.

  You can click anywhere in the window when you want to cancel a selection.


 Odd Situations

  There are times, as in chess, when capturing your opponent's king will
  become impossible.  The problem is that the pieces in Tactrix are
  different those in chess, so those situations are a bit different.  The
  one that remains the same is that if it is one king and two jumpnars
  versus one king, capturing the lone king is impossible.  If you encounter
  any others, please let me know about them, so they can be included in
  this doc file.  I suspect such problems will be found in connection with
  the wrapnoid, since it has such odd restrictions on movement.


 The pieces


  Jerk

   These are the small circles that line the front row of each player's
   army.  These can move one space forward, unless capturing.  They can only
   capture by skipping a space up, down, left or right.  When capturing, it
   doesn't matter if there is a piece between them and their target; they
   actually jump over that space.  If you get a jerk all the way to the
   other side of the board, you get a 25 chip bonus, and the jerk
   disappears.  They cost 3 chips to buy.

    1234567          The star represents a jerk on the board.  The m is where
   1                 he can move if unopposed, and the x's are where he could
   2    x            capture.  The #'s are other pieces.  Note that they do
   3    m            not oppose his capturing move.
   4  x *#x
   5    #
   6    x

  Jumpnar

   These are the small circles surrounded by squares.  They move just as
   knights in chess.  They move two spaces in one direction, then one space
   to either side, ignoring all other pieces that might intervene.  These
   cost 6 chips.

    1234567          The * is the jumpnar, and the m's are where he can move
   1                 or capture.  The #'s are other pieces.  Note that the 
   2   m#m           #'s don't get in the way of the jumpnar's movements.
   3  m## m
   4  ##*#

  Wrapnoid

   These look like a circle enclosed in parenthesis.  They are weird pieces.
   They can move to any adjacent space, except for those immediately to
   their left or right.  To move left or right, they jump a space, ignoring
   any piece that may be there, and then can slide up to 3 spaces.  When
   moving left or right, they can also "wraparound" at the edges of the
   board, appearing on the other side.  These cost 9 chips.
 
    1234567890       In this diagram, the *'s are wrapnoids, the m's are
   1   mmm    1      where they could move or capture, and the # is a piece.
   2mmm * mmm 2      Note that the wrapnoid SLIDES after its initial jump,
   3   mmm    3      so that it can be blocked by another piece.  It could,
   4          4      however, opt to capture that piece.  Also note the m's
   5          5      in columns 9 and 10 in row 8.  This is how a wrapnoid
   6          6      wraps around the edges.

  Verticon

   These look like spots with vertical lines through them.  These pieces can
   move one space in any direction, or slide any number of unoccupied
   spaces vertically.  These cost 12 chips.

    1234567          The * is the verticon, the m's are where he can move or
   1   m             capture.  The # is another piece that blocks the
   2  mmm            verticon's movement.  He could capture the #, though.

  Diaganoid

   These pieces look like a large "X".  They move like bishops from chess,
   except that they can also move one space up, down, left or right.  They
   can slide any number of unoccupied spaces diagonally.  They cost 15 chips.

    12345678         The * is the diaganoid, the m's are where he could
   1     m           move or capture, and the # is another piece.  Again,
   2m   m            the # blocks him from moving farther, but he could opt
   3 mmm             to capture the #.
   4 m*m
   5 mmm

  Regeneroid

   These look like ripples radiating from a splash in a puddle.  They move
   like kings in chess, one space in any direction; but they can't move
   vertically past the half-way mark on the board.  They also have a very
   special function.  When you purchase a new piece, it must be placed on
   a space adjacent to the regeneroid.  When you place the new piece, it can
   be placed in a space occupied by your opponent, thereby capturing your
   opponent's piece.  If you lose your regeneroid, you cannot buy any more
   pieces, no matter how many chips you get.  You cannot buy a new
   regeneroid at any time.

    123456           The * is the regeneroid, and the m's are where it
   1                 could move or capture.
   2  mmm
   3  m*m

  King

   These look like a crown.  They also move like chess kings, one space in
   any direction.  These also have a special purpose; if you lose your king,
   you lose the game.  There are no rules for check and checkmate in
   Tactrix!, so if you can take your opponent's king, do so.  You cannot buy
   another king.  There is no rule for something like castling from chess.

    123456           The * is the king, and the m's are where he could move
   1                 or capture.
