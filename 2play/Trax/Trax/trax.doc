This is a simple two player game based on combat from the Atari VCS.
The object of the game is simple, each player has a tank and he/she
has to destroy the other tank as quick as possible.
As in the old VCS only one shot can be on screen at the same time so
careful shots are required or it could spell doom!!!

runs out or both players run out of shots.


Keys for Trax :-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Q - Quits from the game being played.

 Esc - Quits Trax and returns to DOS.


Map Editor
==========

In the first version of Trax this was only used by myself to save time
creating maps, but there was potential to have it somehow in the game
and after choosing to have it as a separate program here it is.


When the Map Editor is loaded you will be presented with Level one's
map although all fourty are in memory as well.

Control
~~~~~~~
Using the mouse a cursor can be moved to any block on the screen to edit.
You can select a different block to draw with by pressing the right mouse
button, this flips the screen to the blocks screen then by pressing the 
left button a block will be selected. When you press the right mouse button 
to return to the map the left button will let you draw with that block.


Keys for MapEd :-

   Q - Quits MapEd.

   F - Fills screen with tile 0.

   I - Makes walls invisible.

   V - Makes walls visible.

   L - Load maps.

   S - Save maps.

   P - Paste map from buffer.

   C - Copy map to buffer.

   D - This option should when pressed automatically place shadows
       onto your map. Please note although it has been tested throughly
       there still may be one shading it may miss if so please write to
       me. Thank You.

   W - Clears all shadows off the map. Handy if making modifications
       and you don't want the shadows confusing you.

   Up & down arrow keys cycle through the maps.


 Loading Maps
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Insert your map disc into drive df0: and press L.

 Using left and right arrow keys select a bank.

 Now by pressing return that bank will load.

 Note :- each bank consists of all fourty maps.

 Saving Maps
 ~~~~~~~~~~~

 Insert a blank disc into drive df0: and press S.

 The program will check this disc to see if it has been
 used before, if not the save will be done automatically.

 Using left and right arrow keys select a bank to save to.

 If there is already 1 bank on the disc then you could either save
 to this bank which would overwrite it or save to a new bank number 2.	 


 Copying & Pasting
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pressing C will copy the current map to memory then you can load
another bank of maps and overwrite any map by pressing P.


Game Requirements
=================

This  game  should  run on all Amiga's, but when  running TRAX on a
512k Amiga it  may not load because it is trying to allocate memory
to decrunch into and there may not be enough, if so use Powerpacker
to decrunch it then it should work fine.

Trax was developed using HiSoft's Devpac v3.02 on an A500 Plus. It
has been modified to also run on the A1200. A future version maybe
possible if people  request it, this could use  either a 16 colour
Dual Playfield game screen or 64 colours. Any other ideas would be
welcome.


** Please Note :- When running on  an A1200  with the cache on the
   title music plays out of sync, but the vector Tanks will update
   quicker. Thank You.
