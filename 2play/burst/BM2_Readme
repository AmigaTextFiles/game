    The Game
   -----------

After  playing  "Bust  a Move 2" on my friends Sega Saturn I became hooked.
We  rented  the  game  and  kept  returning to take it out again and again.
While playing it I decided that the game was simple enough to be transfered
to  the Amiga without loosing many of the features.  After a few days I had
the bare bones of the game laid out and I began to work, with a lot of help
from my brother Philip, on the more complex aspects of the game.


    The language
   --------------

About  a  year ago I bought Blitz Basic 2 from D Densley off the Internet I
tried to produce a computer model of our solar system but failed becaue the
numbers  were  too  big.   I  gave  up  trying  to program as my exams were
approaching.  The previous year I had written two different games using the
Amiga  Format  Amos  Pro  coverdisk  which unfortunatly didn`t allow you to
create executables.  I also dabbled in Amiga E for a whole weekend.


    Distribution
   --------------

An  earlier  Version was posted off to Amiga Format to be included on their
coverdisk.   I  have  now  sent  it to three different PD Libraries.  I had
hoped  to  compact  the files with LHA and upload it to the internet Aminet
site  and  stick  the  archive  in the games/2ply directory.  Sadly I am no
longer  connected  to  the  internet.  If anyone wants to take the time and
effort to upload it for me then I would be grateful.

I also mantain, or maintained, an Internet site at:-

    http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/5849/

    Take a look especially if you like Red Dwarf.

If people want to get their hands on the source code then send a stamp with
your  cheque  for five pounds.  The code is easy to understand as there are
lots of explanations.

    Any thing else?
   -----------------

The game contains most of the things I had hopes to include apart from more
options  and the high score table.  I discovered an arcade machine that ran
a game similar to "Bust a Move 2", it featured a bomb that was fired up the
screen  which destroyed the six surrounding balls.  I had hoped to add this
feature to my game but never got around to it.

The game is also available for the PC under the name of Puzzle Bobble.

Version  3.5  works  on  my  1  meg  chip  ram  A2000 running OS 2.0 and my
unmodified A1200.



    Playing the Game
   ------------------

When  the  moving  marble  comes  into  contact with another marble it will
become  stuck  in  position.   If there are two or more marbles of the same
colour  adjacent  then  they  will  burst  and  disappear,  as  will others
connected  to  the  original.  The first ball the Starball hits removes all
the  marbles  the  same  colour  from the screen.  Any marbles that are not
connected  to  the  top  of  the  screen  by the others will disappear and,
depending on the mode of play, will add two balls your opponents screen.

You  win  the  game  when  your  screen  is clear or your opponent`s screen
becomes full.

If  you  find  the random levels too dificult then press the help or delete
key before begnning the game.

The one player levels have been designed and there are twelve of them, I am
currently working on a level designer.


    Points system
   ---------------

Each marble fired                      1
A marble bursting                     10
A marble vanishing off the screen    100
Clearing the screen                 1000


    What to do after playing the game
   -----------------------------------

Get  a  stamp,  an  envelope  and a cheque book and follow the instructions
below:

1) Copy the address, from this file or the game, onto the
front of the envelope place the stamp on the top right of
the envelope.

2) Fill in the cheque for five pounds made payable to
David Ball, sign and date it.

3) Place the cheque, along with any comments ideas etc, in
the envelope.

4) Take the cheque/comment/envelope combination and place
it in a post box.

Thank you you have now made all the hard work worth while.

I  have  a few more ideas for games if you think I should continue to write
them then please signify this with money.
