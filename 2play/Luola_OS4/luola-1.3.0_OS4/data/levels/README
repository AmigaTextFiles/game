These levels are distributed under the GPL
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the standard level pack for luola.
Unpack this package to luola's levels directory.
This is usually /usr/local/share/luola/levels under linux.
Under windows, it should be the levels subfolder in the main luola folder.
You may remove this file from the levels directory if you wish. (this is
for human eyes only ;)

Notes on the version numbering scheme.
The first number tells the number of levels in this package. The second
number is the revision of this package. In the unlikely case that a level
should ever be removed from the package, the version number should not
come down. Instead the revision number should be increased and the removed
level replaced with a new one as soon as possible.
