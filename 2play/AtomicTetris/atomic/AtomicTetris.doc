                     Original Concept by Jared Tarbell
                      Amiga Version by Paul Mclachlan






 Atomic  Tetris  was  first written on the IBM by one Jared Tarbell.  At the
 school  which  I  attended  it  quickly  turned into a cult computer game -
 competitions  and  so forth continually going on, even after we had already
 determine the level at which everyone could play.  And so, being a die hard
 Amiga fan, I wrote an Amiga version.

 Firstly,  I  believe to give credit where credit is due.  I'd like to thank
 Lada Trejbal for doing the great music that you'll hear when playing Tetris
 -  as  well  as  (of  course)  Jared Tarbell, since I did steal most of his
 graphics  from  the original atomic tetris (which was surprising easy, just
 loading  up trusty old demo copy of PC-Task in VGA mode (took 1/2 an hour),
 and screen snapping the screens, then DPAINT came into play for the rest of
 that.   Also,  I'd like to thank my family, although they'll probably never
 read  this, since its almost impossible to test a two player game with only
 the  programmer  playing.   Thanks  of  course,  to  the  other members of
 Dataline,  who  have  found  more  than  a  few  bugs  in  their  vigorous
 playtesting.
    
 Atomic Tetris, while it will run on a 512k machine, will not do so with
 the intented soundtrack (or indeed, any soundtrack).  Sorry.

 Atomic  Tetris  is  a  two  player  tetris  game,  where  both players play
 separately on different parts of the screen (with separate keys, as well).
 The players can, however, interact with each other in various ways, such as
 collecting  special  blocks,  and achieving a `tetris'.  Both of these will
 aid  you in your attempt to make the other player lose the game (by getting
 to the top of the screen with their blocks).

 For  the  uninitiated,  tetris  is  played as follows.  Blocks (groups of 4
 coloured boxes, variously arranged) fall from the top of the screen.  These
 blocks  can  be  moved  left and right, as well as rotated (turned around).
 They  will  then  fall  to the bottom and stay there.  As more blocks fall,
 they will build up along the bottom until, eventually, the blocks reach the
 top of the screen and another block cannot appear - then the game is over.
 
 The  game  can  be  prolonged, as whenever a row of blocks is full (with no
 empty  spaces)  that  row  is  removed, and all the blocks move down.  This
 allows you to play (at least theoretically) forever.  Scores are determined
 by the number of lines that you have achieved (that is, how many lines have
 been removed) before you reached the top of the screen.
 
 In  a  `normal'  game  of tetris (and atomic tetris is far from normal) the
 blocks  speed  up  during  play,  meaning  that the game gets progressively
 harder.   This  is  not  a  required feature in Atomic Tetris, as the other
 player can make things hard enough for you as it is.
 
 
 So,  I  have previously mentioned the `tetris'.  This simply means that you
 get  four  lines  simultaneously  (at once).  This can be done by using the
 green line block, and aligning it vertically to fill in the 4 rows.  If you
 get a tetris, then the other player will have two rows added to his screen,
 at  the  top  of  it (with a block removed on each line).  This often means
 that  there  can  be a big gap between the other player and the rest of his
 play area.
 
 Also,  several  special blocks may appear during play.  They will appear on
 your  play grid, taking the place of normal boxes.  Their name will also be
 displayed in the central region, so that its meaning becomes, perhaps, more
 clear.   A special block can be selected by completing the line which it is
 on.  The special blocks available during play are:
 
 	SWITCH SCREENS:
 This  literally  swaps  your  screen  and the other players.  Use this with
 caution,  as if the other player has a worse screen then you do you will be
 helping him by switching them.
 
 	RANDOMISER:
 This block will place several blocks on your opponents screen with spaces
 between them.  I find this to be one of the most annoying special blocks,
 as it is especially difficult to recover from.
 
 	CHAOS:
 This block will `move' some of the other players blocks in a random
 fashion, leaving blank areas all over his screen.  Annoying at times, and
 downright frustrating at others.
 
 	IDIOT:
 This is one of my favourites.  It switches the keys of the other player, so
 that left will move the block right, and right will move the block left.
 
 	DONATOR:
 After selection, the timer line will count down until it is over.  Whenever
 you complete a line with the donator active, your opponent will gain a line
 onto the bottom of his screen, with one box missing.  Can be lethal if you
 can complete a lot of lines quickly.
 
 	SPEEDUP:
 Rather  self explanatory, but this blocks makes your opponents blocks move
 down the screen faster.
 
 	SLOWDOWN:
 Also  pretty  obvious,  but  this  makes  your  blocks move down the screen
 slower.
 
 	CLEAR SCREEN:
 This clears your screen of all blocks, and will often get you out of sticky
 situations.
 
 	BRICKLAYER:
 This  block  lays  many rows of `bricks' on your opponents screen, with one
 block being left from each row.
 
 	STAIRCASE:
 Possibly  the single most annoying block at the start of a game, this draws
 a  staircase of blocks across your opponents screen, moving from the bottom
 corner to the middle of the screen on the other side.
 
 	DOTTER:
 This  special  block turns the other players screens into dots.  This makes
 it quite difficult to see where blocks will fit and so forth.
 
 Many of these special blocks only work for a limited amount of time (except
 instant ones, such as bricklayer or chaos).  Blocks like idiot will run out
 some time after, usually around 20-30 seconds later.
 
 
 
 KEYS
 
 The  keys  to  play  the  game  with appear on the main screen of the game.
 Other  keys  that  do special things include escape, which will either quit
 your  current  game,  or  quit the program; from the title screen hitting a
 number  key (1-9) will select the game speed to play, with one the fastest.
 A  normal game will be played on speed 3.  (Note that speeds of 5 and above
 are  really  too  slow  to  be  called playing tetris) The space key in the
 middle of a game will pause.
 
 
 I think I have covered just about everything about the game.  If I've left
 something out, I'm sure you can work it out - as the whole game is easy to
 play (and all that other spiel about user-friendliness).
 
 
 DATALINE
 
 What the hell is Dataline?  Dataline is a programming group consisting of:
 
 		Me (Paul Mclachlan) 	- Leader / Coder
 		Lee Adamson 			- Coder
 		Chris Burton 			- Coder / Beta Testing
 		Lada Trejbal			- Music
 
 Oh, and that's why you hear `Dataline' throughout the music :)
 
 
 Yeah...  enjoy!
