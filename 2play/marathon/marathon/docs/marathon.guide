Welcome to the wonderful world of Marathon!!! Marathon is a two player
action game (like cannon fodder and syndicate) which will enable you to
drive, walk and fly over a nicely drawn landscape. Your objective is
to collect four (4) stars and find the exit before your opponent does.
Read the @{" instructions " Link Instructions} for more information about playing the game.

Besides playing the original landscape, included in the archive, you can
also play other landscapes. These landscapes are not included in the
archive but will be spread separately. @{" installing " Link Installation} these is very
easy though.

@{" Creating your own landscape " Link Userlevels} is possible too, although the unregistered
version is somehow limited.

I hope you will enjoy playing this game...

Note: The second player can't be used when playing the unregistered 
      shareware version!!!

@{i}Installing the game@{ui}

The archive decompresses into its own drawer. Just copy or move the
drawer and its icon into whatever directory you want to keep it in. Sorry,
there's no install script yet, you really don't need one anyway.



@{i}Installing extra landscapes@{ui}

When available, you are able to install extra landscapes (these can also
be @{" your own " Link Userlevels}). Installing will be a bit tougher though.

First you need to decompress the archive into its drawer called: Landscape
The following files must be present:

Landscape/exit.dat
         /extra.dat
         /fuel_car.dat
         /fuel_man.dat
         /fuel_pln.dat
         /loc_car.dat
         /loc_man.dat
         /loc_pln.dat
         /map.dat
         /map.iff
         /map.pal
         /shapes.dat
         /subway.dat
         /weapon.dat


These files must then be copied to one of the following 4 (empty) user-
landscapes:

.../Marathon/User/Landscape.user.1  ; use this one first
.../Marathon/User/Landscape.user.2  ;              second
.../Marathon/User/Landscape.user.3  ;              third
.../Marathon/User/Landscape.user.4  ;              last

No more is needed to use extra landscape(s). Just run the game, choose
your new landscape(s) and have fun.

I would recommend not to continue reading this text, before you've
played the game and know what's it all about. This way it's easier to
understand how to create your own landscapes.

User-Landscapes must be stored into one of the following directories:

.../Marathon/User/Landscape.user.1
.../Marathon/User/Landscape.user.2
.../Marathon/User/Landscape.user.3
.../Marathon/User/Landscape.user.4


The files which are needed to play your own landscape are:

                           @{b}@{u}How to use the editor@{ub}@{uu}


This feature is only available for registered users and needs a
keyfile to run.

The editor will create the following two (2) files:

    1. map.pal    (palette used in the game)
    2. shapes.dat (all objects, like cars, stars, etc.)


You need the following files in one of the four userlevels. These
can be stored in the marathon/user/landscape.user.x directory.
(x should be 1,2,3 or 4).

     1. car.iff
     2. man.iff
     3. plane.iff
     4. exit.iff 
     5. extra.iff
     6. explosie.iff
     7. map.iff
     8. weapon.iff


Be sure to use only @{b}one@{ub} palette!!!! Examples can be found in the
marathon/examples directory. This directory also contains pictures
wich can be used by you. They have the name: x.<filename>.

When all files are present in one of the four user-directories, you
can start the editor. The editor will ask you which landscape should
be converted. Depending what userlevel-directory you have used you
will have to answer 1,2,3 or 4. x will exit the editor. The program
will tell you if one or more files are missing. You will get a
warning-message when the files were already converted, which can be
ignored.

@{b}Important:@{ub} Be sure all files are present (including the xxx.dat-
           files (like the original landscape) before you try to
           run the game.

                           @{b}@{u}Troubleshooting@{ub}@{uu}

 
Q: The second player doesn't move, what's wrong?

A: Nothing really, you need a keyfile to use the second player. Just copy
   it into the marathon directory and the game should know it's there.


Q: I've created a new landscape, but when I start the game and choose my
   landscape the game returns to the workbench, Why does this happen?

A: You've probably not installed all files correctly. Check if all files
   are present! If so, you must have made an error creating the .dat
   files. @{b}Be sure@{ub} all numbers in this file are immidiatly followed with
   a return. Use an text-editor which can show the return to be sure
   all files are ok. Also check if the list ends with: "999".


Q: Why is the game-menu picture looking strange?

A: This happens when the workbench (or other screen) is not in overscan.
   This has no effect on the game though.


Q: Are there any other landscapes available?

A: Yes!!!


Q: Why does my computer crash when I try to play an old landscape?

A: The older landscapes (marathon1.0 and 1.1) uses an other shapes.dat file.
   Just copy the newer file (../marathon/program/shapes.dat) over it and
   it should be ok.


Q: Is there an easier way to create the .dat files?

A: Yes, make a copy of the map.iff file and number the obstacles used.
   This will soon be replaced by using the editor.

Although I have got a lot of ideas to improve the game, it would be nice
if you, the user, would let me know what features you would like to see in
the next version of Marathon. The amount of requests will determine what
will be implemented first.

@{i}In other words:@{ui} when at least ten (10) people ask for a feature, I will
                try to implement it. Registered users will count as 
                three (3) requests.


@{i}Things which will probably be available in Marathon II:@{ui}

 - no bugs :)

 - improved landscape-creating program (needs a keyfile)

 - larger screens using blocks (10.000 * 10.000)

 - Computer controled opponents (like cannon fodder and syndicate)

 - Bridges and other obstacles (to jump over with a car, like ATR)

 - Power-up's (energy, weapons, etc., etc....)

 - Different kind of human players, weapons and vehicles

 - etc., etc....


As you can imagine there are a lot of possibilities to improve the game.
Why not send @{" me " Link Author} your own ideas.

the number of stars by one (1). This star will be placed somewhere on

There are a couple of things you might want to collect during the
game, like stars, the exit, fuel (including food), a car/plane or
even a nice weapon.


@{i}Stars:@{ui}

Collecting stars is easy. Just walk over them and they are yours.
If you are inside a car or plane you need to get out first.


@{i}The exit:@{ui}

The same way as the stars. You need four stars before you can go
through though.


@{i}Fuel:@{ui}

All vehicles need fuel (even the man (food)). Collecting fuel
can be done by walking, driving or flying towards a fuel-deposite.
Each vehicle has its own place to get fuel. Before getting fuel
you need to stand still on top of the fuel-deposite.


@{i}Weapons:@{ui}

Getting a weapon should be done the way as a car or plane. Just
press the joystick-button when you are close and it will be
yours. When you already got a weapon the weapon you were carring
will be put down on the floor.


@{i}Cars and planes:@{ui}

If you would like to use a car or plane, you need to walk to them
and press the joystick-button.

There are five (5) different kind of weapons. Each of them with
its own advantages and disadvantages.


@{i}1. Guns:@{ui}

Standard weapon. This weapon can shoot five (5) bullets at a time
and has a good range. Can be used as an offencive and defencive
weapon.


@{i}2. Laserbeam:@{ui}

This weapon is only usefull when used as a defencive weapon, this
because you have to @{b}stand still@{ub} to fire with it. Nobody will try
to kill you when you have got this weapon. You have to watch out
for cars though! Choose this weapon when you have collected three or
four stars.


@{i}3. Plasma:@{ui}

Plasma is a very nice weapon. It can be used to shoot around
corners and is an effective way to fight opponents owning a
laserbeam.


@{i}4. Magma:@{ui}

The strongest and fastest weapon. You only have one shot at a
time, so shoot with care. It is the best offencive weapon in the
game and should be collected ASAP!!!


@{i}5. Homing missile@{ui}

Guess what kind of weapon this is? Like magma you only have one
shot at a time. After you have fired you will have to wait a
long time to be able to shoot again. The missile tracks your
opponent down and ignores buildings. It will however hit cars and
the plane when they collide. The homing missile does only work
when the opponent is outside a vehicle. If not, the missile will
go in a straight line off the screen.

                          @{b}@{u}About the vehicles@{ub}@{uu}


There are three (3) different kind of vehicles. Each of them with
its own advantages and disadvantages.


@{i}1. Man:@{ui}

The man is the slowest of the three, but is the only one able to
shoot down planes (real fast too!). When you are good enough it's
also a good way to dispose of cars. This is especially handy when
the car is out of gas. Shooting it will result in a new car,
somewhere on the landscape. The man is also the only one which
can get stars and go through the exit. Speed and the possiblity
of being run over by a car are its weak points though.

There are four different kind of men. These can be choosen on
the titlescreen. Depending what men you and your opponent choose
you should use a different strategie to win the game. Some men
require a lot of food and have large shields, others can heal
themselves quickly. Here's a list of the men and their good and
bad points:

@{u}Sir Anduin Lothar@{uu}
Lothar can fight days without any food. Because of his age his
wounds heal slowly.

Strategy: Try to make your opponent chase you away from any
places they can get food and starve them. Also you can look
for stars without concerning yourself about food.

@{u}Sire Uther Lightbringer@{uu}
The allrounded runner in the game.

Strategy: All strategies are ok. Good for beginners!

@{u}Cho'gall@{uu}
The most fearsome player is definately Cho'gall. He's very tough
but to keep his strength up he has to eat a lot.

Strategy: Try to get close to your opponent and corner him.
Because of your great armour you've not much to fear.

@{u}Zuljin@{uu}
Never going anywhere without his medicalkit he's the only runner
who can heal himself real fast. His downside is his low armour
though. 

Strategy: When you choose this runner you need to use some
stealth stuff to kill your opponent. Stay close to your opponent
and attack when your energy is high and run when you're getting
in trouble.


@{i}2. Car:@{ui}

The car is, while using the turbo the fastest thing around. Press
your joystick-button during driving to activate your turbo. The
turbo costs a lot of fuel though, so please be careful. Driving
the car is for experienced runners only (especially when using
the turbo). This because driving against fences and other
obstacles will quickly result in an explosion. Cars are the
strongest of the three, although energy and fuel can sometimes
be very low, even at the start.


@{i}3. Plane:@{ui}

Only one plane is available. The plane is weak but much faster
than walking and is the only thing able to fly over buildings.
Its greatest threat is being shot down. Please watch your fuel
too, it will be gone before you know it.

Using the radar can be very handy. It shows you what vehicle is
close (even those which cannot be seen on your screen). The
colours used are:

     Vehicle          Colour
    -------------------------
     You              White
     Opponent         Yellow
     Empty car        Blue
     Empty plane      Red
