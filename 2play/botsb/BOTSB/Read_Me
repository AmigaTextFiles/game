      Battle of the Stink beetles is a two player only battle game.
      It's kind of like a tank battle game with beetles instead of
      tanks.
      I has some original features I am sure you will enjoy, if you
      don't like the features, then to hell with you....
      
               AIR RAIDS:  
               You and your enemy will be battling it out, when 
               suddenly you will hear the wail of a siren. Run
               for your lives.... a large enemy bomber (bumble
               bee) is fast approaching. As the bomber nears, 
               you and your enemy will be frozen with terror.
               The bomber might drop a single bomb or a whole
               barrage, who knows?

               ALLIED SUPPORT:
               Since each beetle (choose from 4 different), has
               a different number of bullets (spit wads), gas
               mines, and life points (energy), to start out with.
               You may wish to have the ability to get more while
               your battling it out. If ALLIED SUPPORT, is selected
               from the options menu, a large transport plane 
               (butterfly), will approach and drop a package, the
               player who reaches the package first, will get it's
               contents, which could be the following: first aid,
               bullets (spit wads), or gas mines.
               First Aid, gives more life force points (energy)
               back to your beetle, when a beetles energy 'LF'
               drops to 0, he's dead!

               DUNG PILES:
               To put it simply, dung is poop...
               The piles of dung (3) will be placed at random
               locations, and your beetle can crawl under them for
               protection. They stop spit wads..
               Your beetle can pop-out from under some dung, shoot,
               then retreat back under the poop for protection.
               Dung is not air tight, so a gas mine attack near a
               pile, where your beetle was hiding, would hurt you.
               Also, dung cannot stop the destructive force of the
               huge enemy bomber bombs.

               MINES:
               The mine can be very deadly, they are filled with
               the gas excreted from the beetle who launched them.
               Different beetles have different strength gas mines.
               Examine the beetle selection screen closely, when
               choosing your beetle, to see the gas mine strength.
               Mines are launched during battle by pressing Fire
               Button 2. In a few seconds they explode, and then
               you can launch another one, if you have any left.
               Keep a close eye on your beetles stat bar, at the
               top of the screen, to see how many, spit wads (SW),
               mines (M), and how much energy (LF) he has left.
               Beetle 1's stats are at the top left, and beetle
               2's stats, are at the top right of the screen.
               Mines will also explode on contact with an enemy
               beetle. If an enemy beetle is following too close
               for comfort, just launch a gas mine, that will 
               change his mine.

               ENEMY BOMB SIZE:
               This option only works, if you have selected the
               AIR RAIDS option. This sets the size of the bombs
               being used by the bomber (bumble bee). The small
               size bomb has a small blast, etc...

      -----------------------------------------------------------------

               Other options are always available while you are
               playing the game, simply press the keys below, at
               any time, to select (toggle) the following:
                   P=PAL mode
                   N=NTSC mode
                   Esc=Quits the game
      -----------------------------------------------------------------

               BACKGROUNDS:
               There are 6 different scenes or backgrounds you can
               choose from to battle on, they are as follows:
                   workbench
                   breakfast table
                   plant stand
                   drawing table
                   kitchen counter
                   sewing table
       ----------------------------------------------------------------

               If you have chosen options before, and you play
               another game without choosing new options, you will
               play the new game, with the last game's options...
       ----------------------------------------------------------------

               You need Two (two) people to play this game... and you
               need two 2 button joysticks or pads, etc..
               When the game says joystick in port 1, it means the
               usual port you normaly would have the joystick in.
               And when it says joystick in port 2, that means the
               mouse port.
       ----------------------------------------------------------------

               I have played the game with the following joysticks,
               and have noted the buttons used on each:

                SEGA GENESIS Control Pad (Of course it works fine on
                the AMIGA:
                Button 1=Button B
                Button 2=Button C

                AMIGA CD32 Pad:
                Button 1=Red Buttton
                Button 2=Blue Button

                CD32 COMPETITION PRO PAD:
                Button 1=The button with the red down arrow, and a red
                line under it.
                Button 2=The button with the blue square on it.
       ----------------------------------------------------------------

               This game was written with 'AMOS THE CREATOR' on my
               2 meg AMIGA 600. It was also tested on my 10 MEG 
               CD32, with SX Expansion System. It uses no AMOS
               Extensions, like TOME, POWER BOBS, etc...
