        BlackBox 1.1
        ------------

BlackBox is a game where the goal is to find the hidden balls in a box
using imaginary laser beams! This is an enhanced computerized version of
the boardgame with the same name. It's for 1-6 players, runs on any Amiga
with kickstart 1.2 or higher. Includes a demo for fast learning of how to
play, therefor this guide contains no actual instructions of how to play.
This is a few years old, so it might look a little 1.x-ish. I hope you
don't mind too much.

----------------

This software is provided as is, and the author cannot be held responsible
for any damage caused by this program.


However this does not mean that this software is not carefully written and
tested. All code is 100% systemfriendly, so nothing could possibly go
wrong.

@NODE "Distribution"
BlackBox is ShareWare and is Copyright © 1992 Wizo. This means that you
are allowed to spread this or include it on PD-series provided that you
don't charge more than a small copy fee of maximum $5 / DM 6 / SEK 25.
It's absolutely forbidden to charge more for a disk with this program on
it without my personal permission.

This may also be included on CD-ROM (for example AmiNet CD-releases) as
long as it's not part of a commercial release, ie contains only
Shareware/PD/Freeware etc.

Magazines with cover-disks/CDs may include this on their disk/CD provided
they send me a copy of the magazine (and disk/CD) in question.

Other sorts of distribution is not allowed without my personal permission.

The program may not be distributed without it's icon and this
documentation.

Modified versions of the program, it's icon, or this documentation may not
be distributed. Distribution of the files in packed or archived form is of
course also allowed.


That should cover it all, if it doesn't @{" contact me " LINK "Author"} for clarification.
@ENDNODE
@NODE "Shareware"
If you after trying this game out (for no longer than two weeks) find that
you wish to keep it you should do as follows to become a registered user:


1   If you have written any useful program(s) / fun game, wether it's PD,
    shareware or commercial, you should send @{" me " LINK "Author"} a copy of it (fully
    feautured). Then you will become a registered user of all my software
    as well.


2   If you haven't written any software of your own either:

  a   You're a student or don't have a job so you can't afford to pay
      anything for this. Therefor you are allowed to use it absolutely
      free, but please take a hint from paragraph 3 below.

  b   You have some kind of job and therefor you can afford to pay for
      this. You can decide how much it's worth. I would suggest $5 - $10.
      Cash in US$, DM, £ and SEK (Swedish crowns) accepted.
      Cheques only in SEK. Gifts instead of money are also welcome.


3   Not doing anything of the above, but sending bug reports, nice ideas
    for improvements, or in other ways helping me out in developing my
    programs may also gain you the title of registered user.


Becoming a registered user means registered for all my other released
shareware software as well (currently @{" FourInaRow " LINK "FourInaRow.guide/main"} and @{" Tangle " LINK "Tangle.guide/main"}). So far
none of my software is crippled, since I personally don't believe in
crippleware. Therefor registered users will receive no new version if it
doesn't exist. As soon as they will be available however, registered users
will be notified or receive updates by email (If you want me to mail you a
disk, you either need to register by method 1, or donate at least $10).
New versions will probably be uploaded to AmiNet as well.

If you feel you can't afford to pay for this you need not feel lousy, but
sending a simple comment by @{" email " LINK "Author"} you could afford, right?

Installation
------------

No installation needed really. Just put the executable and the icon
anywhere you like.

BlackBox will run from Workbench as well as from CLI/Shell, and it runs
on both PAL and NTSC (and may be mode promoted).
