The Tangle is a tron like game for 2-4 players playing simultanously
against each other. It runs on any Amiga with Kickstart 1.x, but if you
have 2.x or higher I would recommend you to run the newest version of
Tangle instead - it is much better. Instructions are available in the game.
This version of Tangle needs a stack of at least 25000 bytes.
