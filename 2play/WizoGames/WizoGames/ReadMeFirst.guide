@NODE Overview
This is a compilation of three little simple nice games I've written in the
last few years. Major general feautures:

* One or more players, playing againts each other
* Playability
* Fun
* Addictive
* 100% Systemfriendly and multitasking
* Simple but funtional graphics
* No sound (so you can listen to your favourite music or whatever)
* AmigaGuide documentation
* Starts from WB or CLI
* Written in C (using Lattice/SAS C 5.10)


BlackBox
This is an improved computer version of the boardgame with the same name.
For 1-6 players. This was my first major C program written in 1992.
BlackBox is fun and uses almost no CPU time. Runs on any Amiga.


Tangle
This is a Tron like game for 0-4 players. Great fun. Very configurable
(configurations can be saved in tooltypes, at present uses 53 tooltypes).
Needs 2.04 or later, but an old version that runs on 1.x is also included
(though it is not at all as good).


FourInaRow
This is the result of me studying algorithms. A very nice version of
Four in a row, or Four wins. 0-2 players (yes you can watch the
computer play against itself). Plays fairly good and fast, I would say.
(That is - beats the crap out of all other four in a row games I have
seen.)  Written in C on various computers 1993-94.
Included a version that uses 2.04, a less feautured version for 1.x and
a windows (yuk) version (which you may use or delete, whatever pleases
you most).

@NODE Icons
Sorry for the icon inconsistency. These icons were drawn a while ago, with
only four colors. There are a couple of alternate MagicWB style icons
(done by Len Trigg, thanks Len!) for Tangle in the icons drawer, use any
of them if you like them better. If you find my icons ugly, or non-
standard, please feel free to draw icons of your own and send them to me so
I can include them in future releases.

@NODE Installation
No installer script is supplied, because basically you need no
installation. Just drag the WizoGames drawer to anywhere you like (for
example your Games: partition or a floppy disk). Done!
You can remove the versions for 1.x if you have 2.0 or later.
You can also remove the windows directory if you like to, or install the
windows version on a PC. And you could remove the icons directory if you
don't want the alternate icons.
