Sorry, there is no setup for this. If you don't know how to install a
Windows program manually here comes a short description:

1. Copy FourWin.exe & FourWin.hlp to your Windows directory.
2. Activate the Games (or whatever group name you have for your games)
   group icon in the program manager.
3. Choose New... from the File Menu.
4. Choose program object.
5. Enter 'Four In a Row' as description.
6. Enter 'FourWin.exe' as command line.
7. Press return. Done.                                  

If this doesn't help you, consult your Windows manual, your System manager
or anyone who knows a little more about Windows than you.
