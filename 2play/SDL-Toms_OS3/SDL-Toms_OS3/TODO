TODO for SDL-Toms
=================


-Make pretty "Player X has won!" splash screen. Can use atom colour
 to show which player.

-Allow in-game changing of fullscreen mode.

-Allow choice of player colours

-Sound would be nice...

-Do some more testing

-Change the main loop of do_chain() to be able to incrementally check if
 one player's won, in case of the perverse situation where the reaction
 will never end, so that it can give players the option of quitting
 after several iterations. That won't stop it automatically.

-Better text. Sometimes I hate Gimp.
