Not much new really, but what there is should be damn handy for some
people

      - The keyboard controls can now be re-defined. To do this, run the
        program called "DefineKeys" before running the game. Unfortunately
        you can't redefine them during the game yet, because that would
        involve re-writing the front-end code which I really don't have
        time for at present :( Please note that if you change the keys
        then the select players screen will have the wrong keys
        displayed at the bottom.

      - You can now see who is on your team when looking at the scores in
        a team game (wow, what a big improvement! :-)

Other new stuff that you would have if you registered (see @{"Support" link "Support" 0}) :-

      - The "Wobble Mode". Blob not mad enough for you? Try playing with the
        screen wobbling about all over the place every now and again. Even
        more manic than usual!

      - New level format thing. You can now easily set the order in which you
        want to play the levels. (Thats's all 14 of our levels, plus the
        thousands you can design yourself using the Blob Level-Grabber!)

  Blob requires: - An AGA Amiga (PAL)

                 - 4 player joystick adapter if you want EIGHT players
                   at once. (Otherwise, it's only six)

                 - Friends (Blob is an inherently social activity)

  Blob is known to work on the following systems:

    Standard A1200 (+HD)
    A1200 with Apollo 1240/25, 8Mb Fast RAM, HD

  Important info bit:-

    The Blob program actually contains two different game routines, one
    for machines with an 020 processor and one for machines with an 030,
    040 or 060 (This is to get the game running at full speed). If you
    have an 020 Amiga with FAST RAM, you may get some glitches during the
    game (Sprites flashing, and speeding up abnormally). If this is the
    case then edit the "Run_Blob" file and change the appropriate
    line to "Blob.exe FAST". Floppy users, adjust the corresponding line
    in S:startup-sequence.

  Hopefully this problem will not occur, but we haven't been able
  to test it extensively, so can't be sure. Please contact us and tell
  us whether Blob works correctly on your system.

    Blob is the ultimate in multi-player platform games. The aim of the
  game is to jump on the other player's head's, thereby scoring points.
  Each level has a time limit, and whoever has the most points at the end
  of the time wins the round. League points are then awarded, depending
  on how well you did in the round, how many people you killed and how
  many bonuses you collected. After a set number of levels the league
  scores are finalised, and an overall winner declared.

  Really cool bits about Blob:-

    EIGHT players simultaneously.
    Team games.
    No `lives', so no one ends up out of the action for ages.
    A multitude of bonuses for outstanding feats of gaming.

    The main menu:-

      @{"Normal game" link "The Game" 0} - start the game, everyone against everyone else.
      @{"Team game" link "Team Games" 0} - start a team game.
      Options - go to the options menu.
      Quit - Hmmmm, wonder what this does?

    Options menu:-

      Random levels/Start at Level #

           -If random levels is selected, the levels will be played in a
            random order. If not, the levels will be played sequentially,
            starting at level #.

      Full sound/No boing

           -When there are lots of players, the boing sound effect can
            really start to annoy, so this enables you to turn it off.
            (This can also be achieved from within the game by pressing
            F1, whilst F2 turns it back on)

      Main Menu - surprise, surprise, back to the main menu!

    Once you have selected your choice of game, you then get to choose
  how many rounds to have in the league. This number is limited to the
  number of different levels available (Twelve at the last count, unless
  you've added some of your own)

    You then go to the select players screen. Each set of controls is listed
  along the middle of the screen. Press fire when the arrow is above a set
  of controls to turn the corresponding player on or off. A Blob shows that
  the player is active, no Blob means inactive. Select done when you are
  finished. If you are playing a @{"Team game" link "Team Games" 0}, then this screen will be slightly
  different.

    Once you are done, the fun begins. All players start by dropping from
  the top of the screen. Jump by pressing fire (The height of the jump is
  determined by how long you hold down the button). Basically, try to land
  on the other players, and avoid being landed on yourself. If you die, you
  re-appear from a random point at the top of the screen.

    Bonuses are available for many things, such as dive-bombing, multiple
  kills and other amazing feats. Anti-bonuses are also awarded, for those
  of you who are truly useless.

    When there are only 15 seconds left in the round, an alarm will sound.
  If at this point you have lots more points than everyone else, you may
  get a price on your head. If so, anyone who kills you gets bonus points.
  (Double or triple points depending on how far ahead you are)

  Beware of performing very badly if you have a price on your head, it
  can be highly detrimental to your league score.

    At the end of a round, the scores are calculated as follows:-

    -Two league points are awarded for every kill notched up.
    -Players are ranked acording to no. of kills, then points awarded as
     follows:-
              1st  28 pts       (When draws occur, the points for both
              2nd  24 pts        positions are divided equally between
              3rd  20 pts        the players)
              4th  16 pts
              5th  12 pts
              6th  8 pts
              7th  4 pts
              8th  0 pts

    -Bonuses - Well, the better it is, the more points it scores.
               (And vice versa of course)

    Team games enable you to have more than one player contributing
  to one league score. The game proceeds as normal, except that no points
  are scored  for killing your own team members. League scores are then
  combined for the members of each team. You can have as many teams as you
  like, so if some people are really bad, you can even the odds by making
  them a team.

    The select players screen is different for team games. Above the list
  of controllers there is a number. This is the number of the team this
  player belongs to. Cycle through the teams by pressing fire with the
  pointer above the number in question. If no number is shown then the
  player is inactive.

   When playing on an unexpanded A1200 with lots of players, glitches may
 start to appear (sprites flashing and brief speed changes). These
 problems seem to begin after you have playing for quite a while, not
 immediately. If this happens, quit out of the game at an
 appropriate point and then restart the game. This should solve the
 problem. Sorry, we don't know what causes it.

   I've also had some problems of late with it crashing unexpectedly
 at random times. This didn't used to happen and I'm not sure whether
 it's just my computer being a pain in the neck. Please send me a mail
 if you experience similar problems.
