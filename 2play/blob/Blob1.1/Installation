Installation Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hard Drive users - No probs, just copy the Blob drawer to wherever you
                   want it.

                   Make sure that you run Blob from the icon and don't have
                   a disk named Blob: in the drive or it won't work.

Floppy users - Get a blank, formatted disk (No directory cache or it
               won't fit)

               Copy the contents of the Blob drawer onto the disk.
               (not the actual Blob drawer, just what's inside it)

               Insert the workbench disk in df0: and type:-

                 df0:c/Copy df0:c/install ram:

               Then insert your Blob disk in df0: and type:-

                 Ram:install df0:

               The game can now be run by inserting the disk at the
               boot-prompt.
