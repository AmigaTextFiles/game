@node about "About DIE"

@{b}So what is DIE?@{ub}

Die is everything you have ever dreamed of :).
It takes two player duels in a new dimension on amiga.
The basic idea is very simple (two little men trying to kill eachother),
but behind the curtain you'll find what it really has to offer.


- 128 colour graphics + cool copper-colourslides.
- 2 layers (front and background layer)
- special effects , like parallax clouds and water
- over 300 frames of quality animation
- levels supporting backround animations
- interactive objects, like teleports, doors and ladders
- 20 deadly weapons + other things to collect
  (shield, health pack, gravity belt, speed etc..)
- different game modes like rob-a-flag -mode
- you can customize gravity, max.health etc.
- you can create your own levels

and now... the heart of the game:

- all weapons are made of pixels (like in turboraketti and roketz)
  This great pixelroutine supports homing bullets,
  pixels with gravitation and special abilities.
- up to 200 pixels on screen at once.

- The game runs at maximum speed on my A1200+030+fastmem
  And i think it runs with full speed on A1200+fastmem,
  if you turn some special effects off.

- and for the last, but not least.... the game is FREEWARE!
  My only request is that you send me some feedback
  if you like or hate this game :)

happy killing,
  naama/Naamahaukat

@endnode

@node install "Machine requirements"

DIE requires an AGA Amiga and about 1 meg of free chipmem,
but fastmem is strongly recommended.

I have only tested DIE with my A1200 030 and on a basic A1200,
so i don't really know whether it works on other machines.

On a basic A1200 it's slow (25fps), but i think that fastmem
will add some speed, so if you have an A1200 with only some
extra fastmem let me know how the game runs on it.

tip:
If the game is slow, try turning off 2d-layer,special effects
and backround anims.
(you can also try turning vwait off, but not recommended
 if you suffer from epilepsy :)

If it's still slow, buy an accelerator :)

@endnode


@node play "Game controls"

You can control characters with joystick or keyboard.


Joystick:
up/down           - change shooting angle
left/right        - walk left/right
up + left/right   - jump left/right
fire              - shoot

Keyboard:
arrows + shift


Jetpack Controls:

up/down           - accelerate
left/right        - change direction/shooting angle
fire              - shoot


In ladders:
Hold down fire and move with joystick or arrowkeys.
(note! you can't shoot when you are in ladders)

To open/close a door, just go on top of the button and press fire.


easy?

@endnode


@node options "Game options"

When you go to the options menu you'll find a bunch of options
to choose from.
(the menu is controlled via mouse in case you haven't noticed :)

In some options right mousebutton is used to cycle value backwards.
for example the scenario button. L.mouse for next scenario and r.mouse
for previous.


Here is a little map and explanations on menu items:

OPTIONS:
 scenario            -  choose a scenario to play
 random scenario     -  choose a random scenario!
 @{"player menu" LINK plmenu}        -  player setup

 max. health         -  maximum amount of hitpoints

 game mode           -  in rob-a-flag mode you must chase the flag.
                        If your enemy gets the flag, you loose health as long
                        as he can keep it. To get the flag, shoot your enemy.
                        Then the flag appears in random place again ready to be collected.

 @{"GFX options" LINK gfxmenu}
 @{"Advanced options" LINK admenu}

@endnode

@node plmenu "Player menu"

Choose controllers and change names of the players.

@{"Equipment/Statics menu" LINK equipment} - Equip your player
@endnode


@node equipment "Equipment/statics menu"

Here you can Equip your player and see character statics.
All the equipment have their advantages and disadvantages.

@endnode



@node gfxmenu "GFX menu"

2d layer            -  can characters go behind certain colours?
special fx          -  clouds and water
backround anims     -  possible additional animations
explosionflash      -  the screen flash when a big boom comes

Turn them all off if the game is slow. Or at least special fx and backround anims.

@endnode

@node admenu "Advanced options"

vwait            - Does the game wait for vertical beam to finnish?
                   (it means that if turned off the game runs at maximum speed,
                   but objects flicker like hell ;)

sniper mode      - Both have the sniper rifle as a start weapon. deadly :)
show gun         - Does the name of the weapon show when box collected?
superjet mode    - forces jetpack(faster than normal) on in every scenario.

@endnode


@node ingame "How to play..."

Playing the game is very easy.

- shoot the other guy to make him DIE!!

- collect boxes for new weapons
  You can only have one gun at a time, so if you don't want to
  change your gun, don't collect the box! :)
  When you run out of bullets from your new gun, you get back
  your basic gun with unlimited bullets.

- collect medikits for health, armour for invunerability, and so on....

- don't jump from too high, you can hurt yourself (except if you have
  a gravity belt).


INTERACTIVE objects:

DOORS are controlled from the green buttons. Use fire to close/open.
DOCKING AREAS are marked with a green cross. Just go on top of
them to increase your health.
TELEPORTS move you to a random location.

ps. all the special abilities (like gravbelt, armour and speed) only
    last for a short while.



STATUS BAR

There is two green bars for each player.
Upper bar is for health, lower for the specialweapon ammo.

With the basic gun you have unlimited ammo, so the bar is empty at first.

got it?


@endnode

@node group "naamahaukat?"

Actually naamahaukat is no longer a group, but i still use the name.
I'm the only member, so everything is done by me.

Fortunately i got some good ideas from my friends, so i could develope
such a good peace of gameware. (so my friends think)

FULL CREDITS:

coding, gfx, most of the design     -   me
A big pile of good ideas            -   Juho Helsky
big font                            -   Huuhkaja/Sulpu


FUTURE:

I will continue to make games on Amiga as long as there will be people
to play them. Keep AMIGA ALIVE! (don't let hungry Bill eat us all!)


btw. If you make your own levels to DIE, don't hesitate to mail
     them for me. I would be more than happy to receive good levels!

@endnode


@node makescen "Making your own scenarios..."

I have not made any scenario editor to DIE (yet), so creating
your own scenario is not very easy, but anyone can create one
when the basics are understood.



BASIC THINGS:
-------------

WHAT YOU NEED?

- Drawing program like Deluxepaint or Brilliance for example.
  (any program capable of handling .iff files will do)

- Any basic text editor  (that can save files in ASCII format)


GETTING STARTED...

Load scen/BASIC_COLOURMAP.iff in to your Drawing program.
You can see explanations on different colours in palette.

DIE palette is made up from 128 colours (from 0 to 127)


Colour 1 - Teleport colour (just put one pixel of this colour into your scenario
                            and you have a working Teleport in that location.)
         - You can only have max. 8 teleports per scenario.

Colour 2 - Docking place. max. 4 docking places per scenario allowed.

Colours  0 & 3-63 are wall colours. That means that your characters can't go thru them.

         - wall colours 6-16 are modifiable
           (that means that you can change them as you wish)

Colours 64-79 are frontlayer colours. That means that your characters can go under them
              if 2dlayer option is on.

Colours 80-126 are backround colours. They have no effect on any objects.

All frontlayer and backround colours can be freely modified. !

Colour 127 is also a backround colour. But it's not an usual colour.
           The sky is displayed thru that colour register.


!!!!  You must NOT modify colours 17-63, unless you want to have really weird
      effects ;)


When you have understood how palette works, you can proceed...

Scenario must be at size 320x256 using 7 bitplanes (128 colours)
Use wall colours to draw walls, backround colours for backround etc.

Save your scenario in the scen drawer. (for example mylevel.sce)

Congratulations! you now have a working scenario.



MORE ADVANCED STUFF
(adding ladders, doors, special effects etc.)

Go to a drawer scen/ADDON_EXAMPLES. Here you will find example files on any addons
available.

HERE IS a LIST with short explanations on what different files do, and their format.


SPECIAL EFFECTS FILE   EXTENSION .add   FORMAT: ASCII Text-file

This file has to contain two numbers. First number is for clouds, second for water
Number 0 means off and number 1 on.

For example, if you want clouds on and water off you type in 10
for clouds off and water on  --->  01
and for clouds on and water on  --->  11

For water, paint a block of 320x16 pixels of empty space (starting from Y co-ordinate 240)
using colour 127 (sky colour) (see graveyard.sce)
For clouds, leave 48 pixels of sky coloured space starting from the top of the screen.
(for cool shadow effect you can paint thins on the sky using wall colours - see graveyard.sce)

confusing? eh...

Save the file in scen drawer by the name  your_scenario.add
(your_scenario meaning the scenario you are making ;)

If you don't create .add file clouds and water will be automatically turned off.


DOOR FILE   EXTENSION .dor   FORMAT: ASCII Text-file

Defines positions for buttons and doors.   (MAX. 10 doors can be created)
Read example.dor.README for info


LADDER FILE  EXTENSION .lad   FORMAT: ASCII Text-file

defines ladder x1,y1,x2,y2 co-ordinates.   (MAX. 10 ladders can be created)
Read example.lad


PREVIEW FILE   EXTENSION .pre  FORMAT: IFF IMAGE

A small image of a scenario (160x64 pixels)
using the same palette as in example.pre

Read example.pre.README  for more info


SKY COPPERLIST FILE   EXTENSION .sky  FORMAT: ASCII Text-file

Used to customize sky colourfade
Read example.sky


ANIMATION TEXT FILE   EXTENSION  .atx?    FORMAT: ASCII Text-file

? means number from 1 to 5

Read example.ani.README


ANIMATION FRAME FILE  EXTENSION  .ani?     FORMAT: IFF IMAGE

? means number from 1 to 5

READ example.ani.README!!


ANTI-GRAVITY FIELD FILE   EXTENSION  .grv    FORMAT: ASCII Text-file

Defines AG field co-ordinates in same style as in .lad file.
MAX. 6 AG fields can be created.



NONE of these addon files are not neccessary for scenario to work properly.

Study included scenarios and see how they work. This is the best way to
learn how to create your own cool levels.
