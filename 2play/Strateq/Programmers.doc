==============================================================================
ENGLISH ONLY: The Strateq + AI Competition!
==============================================================================

Even if I decide to actually write the Strateq + version, I won't invent an AI
routine for it myself. That is for you other AMOS programmers out there to do.

Send in your routines in either ASCII or AMOS form, preferably fully
commented, and I shall possibly even use them, with the reward of mentioning
your name in Strateq + ! If you want money for your routines, say so and I
just might see what I can do about it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AMOS-talk about the program
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, you should only use very weird variable, procedure and label names such
as JEEP or CAULIFLOWER as your own names to avoid confusion with my names.

Second, here are the common numeral values for the pieces.
0=Soldier       1=Warrior           2=YIN           3=YANG
4=Equestrian    5=Pegasus           6=Emperor       7=Empress
8=Wraith        9=Warlord           10=Battleship   11=Dreadnought
12=Leviathan    13=Construction Dock14=Main Factory

Third, here is a list of my variables, procedures and routines.

Variables:
    TURN                    whichever player is currently in charge (0 or 1)
    OB(11,11)               an array which shows the board's contents:
                            bits 0-1: what kind of piece/chip?
                                0 = 1-square piece / no chip
                                1 = 2-square piece l / chip 1
                                2 = 2-square piece r / chip 2
                                3 = 4-square piece / chip 3
                                4 = chip 4
                            bits 2-3: piece or chip?
                                0 = piece of player 1
                                4 = piece of player 2
                                8 = chip
                               12 = chip
                            bit 4: is the square available?
    SH(63,1)                the shapes of 64 pieces in one side (0...15)
                            substract 1 to gain num / 0 = no piece
    XY(63,1)                the positions of 64 pieces (X+(16*Y))
    ALF(63,1)               the armour left of 64 pieces
    OWN, NME                include 0 and 4 or vice versa dep. on TURN
    MONEY(1)                players' money
    PRI(14),BOU(14)         the prices and bounties of the piece types
    ARM(14),STR(14)         the armour ratings and strengths of the types
    EMPDEAD(1)              how many Imperials of a player have died

Functions:
    FnIS(x,y)               OB(x,y) and 12
    FnWH(x,y)               OB(x,y) and 3

Procedures:
    AVAIL[x,y]              Make (x,y) available for 1-square piece
    LONGAVAIL[x,y]          Make (x,y) available for 2-square piece
                            (square is piece's left edge)
    FLUSHBOARD              Remove all avail-bits
    PIC[num,x,y,sel]        Draw piece number num at (x,y)
                            Set sel to 1 for selected image
                            Use num=-1 for empty squares
    NEWPIECE[num,x,y]       Make new piece (type num) at x,y
    WHATPIECE[x,y]          Finds out what piece is in (x,y) and returns its
                            number (used with the SH(), ALF() and XY()
                            arrays) in variable N

Routines:
    MOVEMENT                Calculate all possible moves for piece
                            (set variables PX & PY to piece's coordinates
                            and variable NUM to piece's type)
    MOVE                    move piece from PX,PY to QX,QY
    FIGHT                   Attack a piece at EX,EY (for 2-square pieces,
                            set variable SHIP to -1)

That was all. Now get programming!
See you later in another documentation!

Remember that I am open to any questions about this programming-type thing.

So long!
