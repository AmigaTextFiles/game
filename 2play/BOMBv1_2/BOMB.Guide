Having been quoted as saying "@{i}I just want to live on a ranch and make
babies@{ui}", she was soon snatched from Hollywood by a wealthy corn farmer.
But once his secret impotence was cruelly revealed immediately after the
bounds of marriage had been declared, she was forced, by the upbringing of
her over-religious parents, into a life of boredom.

Like all right minded beatiful women stuck on a ranch, she turned to bombing.
Not wanting to go through the rigmarole of serving lengthy prison sentences
for multiple accounts of first degree murder and arson, she took the
computer alternative: @{i}Battle Of The Bombers@{ui} (a poor game which didn't have
a clever acronym).

Through the unwanted lack of sexual distraction, she soon became a master
at this sub-standard game.

Now it's you that must fight, with her or against her, in her custon built
play area where she faces the ultimate in all bombing experiences:

Although walking on beaches being chased by ridiculously attractive women
in bikinies so small that they barely cover the sumptuous curves of a thin
blond with deep blue eyes and a pair... Ahem... err... yes, anyway that's
normally enough for your average man.

Aha, but not for our Mitchell.  He seeks something higher than a mere 
testosterone rush.  He, you see, is a man who aims at a more refined peak of
pleasure.  He craves something that can be enjoyed by up to four people at 
the same time.  Something that can be done in any room of the house.
Something which is essential to the progress of mankind.  Something which is 
everything to some peoples' lives, and at the same time scorned upon by
others.  He is looking for something where plastic implements are used by
the better endowed.

In short, he wants a bombing game.  Not, for example, to watch TV.

Driven by these desires Mitch (if you don't mind me calling him that)
practiced on @{i}BombStar@{ui} ® to become a master.

Now it's you that must fight, with him or against him, at his own pool where 
he faces the ultimate in all bombing experiences:

"Biscuit boy, biscuit boy.." - that was all Rich heard through his early
childhood days.  The torment gained Rich no friends and, at first, the
pestering shunned him from his school colleagues.

Rich played @{i}Bombs@{ui} ® all day with no company.  This continual monotony not
only made him a good bomber, but the solitary life made his character
strong.

His bombing talent and hard shell grew with age.  By the time he'd finished
school, he was the most powerful sixteen year old the island of Sicily had
ever seen.  No one knew his business or the root of his power but, in the
same way, no one would dare ask, for he was Don Rich Tea.

From being the most influential boy, he became the most influential man.
He now owns most of the island.  His love for bombing stemmed from the video
game, and then into real life; making sure that none shall cross him ever
again.

Now it's you that must fight, with him or against him, in the Scilian
streets where he faces the ultimate in all bombing experiences:

Cho became a master having played @{i}Dynablaster@{ui} ®.

So, naturally, Mr Cho was forced to turn to bombing championships for his
satisfaction in life.  And, all the talented are in only one group.

He grew up in London, and was always going to be a tough nut.  When it came
to the choice between England rugby and the best fighting unit in the world
there could only be one choice; Vinnie loved killing too much.

Once the training was over, the real challenge began.  "He who dares wins"
and the greatest dare of all comes in the form of a game.  To make sure the
SAS only have the best, they kill the rest through real life bombing
practice.

Vinnie took to this immediately; it appealed to everything he stood for!
The training made him into a master.

Nowadays jungle has a bad name.  I don't know whether it had a good name.
Or whether it once had a trendy name, and then changed it.  That is not for
us to know.  Simply accept it as a fact that it does.  Have a bad name, I
mean.

Where was I?  Ah yes, this sweetly brings us, in a DJ-style link, to
"The Chief".  For those not as enlightened as myself, I will reveal the
obvious connection.

"The Chief" lives in a jungle.  The green kind.  Not, for example, the
over-bassed music type.  This is a situation none of us would be
particularly happy with.  Imagine, if you will, you lived in a garage.
Would you be satisfied with such an untuneful association?  Maybe you
would.  Nonetheless, "The Chief" isn't.

Years of banging his head against tree trunks, eventually lead him to the
conclusion that the only way to disassociate his habitat with @{i}that@{ui} music
was through fame.  And, how can one become more famous than by killing
innocent people and watching their last breath burnt away in a fury of
explosion?  Or finding random skulls in the Scottish highlands?

Now it's you that must fight, with him or against him, in the African
forests where he faces the ultimate in all bombing experiences:

@node Jon "About Jon"
You know those stereotyped PC owners who wear heavy metal T-shirts and talk
to you about @{i}Doom@{ui}?  Well, Jon's not like that.  No, really.  No, no, don't
get me wrong.  I don't know - programmers all the same!  But I don't know
whether other production people on games have to put up with grumpy
programmers wanting to switch to Blitz for v1.2!

Actually, I can't say anything too bad otherwise I think he'll get his
revenge in the game somewhere.

Jon programs in or on anything and drinks medically dangerous amounts of
alcohol, but I've yet to see the combination.

Anyway, here's his chance to slag me off...

The first time that I wrote my entry in this guide, I couln't think of
anything to write, so I copied Matt's entry.  So then Matt changed his
entry just to spite me and make my entry look a tad silly.  So I thought
the best way to get back at him would probably be to remove my copy of his
entry, making his change a complete waste of time.

Anyway, as you've probably gathered, my name's Jon.  And I occasionally
code.  Actually I code an awful lot more than Matt would have you believe -
I work as a software engineer at a company who produces test gear for car
companies - rolling roads, wheel alignment machines, etc.  At the moment,
I'm just 18.  My star sign is Aquarius, though I don't see why anybody
would want to know that.  This September, I'll be going to Manchester
University, UK to study Computer Science.  And drink to excess.

Even as I write this, people are hassling me about the options which @{i}are@{ui}
in Master Blaster and @{i}aren't@{ui} in BOMB.  My policy is as follows: if I
can be bothered to do it, and it's a reasonable feature, it goes in.  This
is mainly due to the restrictions of the way the game was coded.  And those
restrictions were a direct result of programming the game in AMOS.
Admittedly, some aspects of the coding could have been planned a little
better, but since this is the first proper game I've written, the first
game (or anything) which I've written in AMOS, and the first thing I've
written on an Amiga®, I hope I'm excused for these errors.  And I have in
the past asked to convert the game to Blitz, and been told not to.  So the
fact that some features are in the game, and some aren't is a directly
attributable result of not being allowed to code in Blitz, which is Matt's
fault.  So don't look at me when he complains.

If you should happen to have more than three and a half brain cells, you'll
notice that the "Best of 5" game option actually equates to the "First to 3"
game option.  Don't look at me if you're looking for someone to blame about
this - the "Aggregate" option is the way I wanted to do the "Best of"
option.  However, after a good deal of shouting, the best I could get was
"people think differently" as an explanation for this horrific duplication.
If you're another person who thinks this is completely ridiculous (i.e. You
have an IQ above 3), then mail @{"Matt" Link Matt} or @{"Beej" Link Beej}.
If you register, and mention IQ>3, we'll send you a @{b}proper@{ub} version.

My name is Alex Daltas and I am half (I repeat half) Greek. Despite what you 
may think from seeing the above I do not do art A-Level but I was chosen to
do the graphics for @{b}BOMB@{ub} because I was the closest person around with an 
Amiga and a copy of @{"DPaint" Link Credits}. A computer game graphic artist spends most of 
his time being shouted at for not doing any work. In fact I am, at this very 
moment, being forced to write this page against my own will.

 BOMB has been fun. It has not been a piece of cake, but it has been fun to
prove what can be done with some friends, some Amigas, and a lot of effort.
If any of you out there ever plan on working on your own game, then there
are things you need to know before you find out the hard way. In
particular, the things your 'colleagues' tend to say...


   The Manager :     "How hard can it be ?"
                     "That's crap.  Draw it again."
                     "You buy this round."

   The Programmer :  "Cool - I've found a major bug."
                     "I'll do it later."
                     "No."

   The Artists :     "In @{i}how many@{ui} colours ?"
                     "Can we work in AGA next time ?"
                     "What size grid ? Oh, I thought you said 15x17."


So be warned :)
Before I go, there are some friends who must be thanked :

   Thomas 'Fred' Preece, James 'Squizzy' Gurney, Ben 'Libraries' Williams,
   and Gareth 'Mentor' Lee.

And there are also some people who deserve greets :

   Greg 'not greedy' Marshall, Mark 'she was 15' Steel, Sid the Stud,
   Jon 'Fray' Baker, Sly, Dave 'Yes m'am' Love, Ben 'not Beej' Chappers,
   Anna 'Glaaaarster' Jones, Anna and Emily C, Marian, Samantha, Lucy, Liz,

Well, @{"Matt" Link Matt} didn't bother to even think about including me in here, so I

about to be uploaded to Aminet. :)

Basically, I did the spinning globe anim and stuff.
And err that's it really :)

Read @{"Matt" Link Matt}'s section for all the things I like, we have basically the same

Anyone who is even slightly interested about finding out more, can connect

@{"Jon" Link Jon}, @{"Beej" Link Beej}, @{"Alex" Link Alex} and myself (@{"Matt" Link Matt}) all met at a boarding school and
quickly got to know each other through the mighty Amiga.  @{"Silicon Circus" Link Authors}
was originally @{"Jon" Link Jon} and @{"Beej" Link Beej}.  I was allowed to join, and although we had a
"group", we weren't actually doing anything.  Well, we saw @{"Alex" Link Alex} mucking
around on @{"DPaint" Link Credits} drawing an overhead man holding a gun, and decided the
time had come to make our first release.

So, @{"SC" Link Authors} (now numbering 4) got a-going.  I phoned @{"Jake" Link Jake}, who I already knew
could write music stupidly well, and then there were five.

We started off writing an @{i}Alien Breed@{ui} clone called @{i}Gangster@{ui}, using a
larger version of @{"Don Rich Tea" Link Gangster}.  We soon came across some limitations of
standard @{"Amos Pro" Link Credits}.  We switched to @{b}BOMB@{ub} which was our backup for a game
idea for the @{i}Amiga Format @{"Amos Pro" Link Credits} games competition@{ui}.  Avoiding starting
off a sentence with "We".  There we go.  Now that's two.  Now that's three.
Anyway, where was I?  Ah yes, well in AF75 we won the competition with
twelve others.  Hmph.  We were very pleased nonetheless.  The screen shot
in the mag was from v1.0 (not a good thing).  We did send them v1.1 as
well.  Now it's v1.2, which we hope will be on an AF coverdisk (magnetic or
compact).

Anyway, we hope you like the game.  I think it's the best bomberman game
for the Amiga, but then again I would, wouldn't I?  We'll probably end up
doing updates, but the next should be @{"Beware of Greeks" Link bog} - a graphical
adventure with a combined programming team of @{"Silicon Circus" Link Authors} and Visions of
the Impossible (who did the @{"Archimedes conversion" Link bombarch}) to make Silicon Visions
(provisional title).  The @{"PC version" Link bombpc} is on the way.

More about can be found out about these things @{"here" Link Contacts}.

I think that the current version works only on 1MB CHIP RAM machines.  It
definitely needs 1MB, but it might work with ½MB CHIP and ½MB FAST RAM.  If
you are in dire need of BOMB for your A500, then register and beg.

Please feel free to write if you want your own character or backdrop
implemented, or you want to know how we did something, or you want to tell
us how to do something properly.

                               -=========-

There are many different power-ups in @{b}BOMB@{ub} which can affect the players
abilities drastically. Some are vital to the way in which the game works,
others are just for added enjoyment.

@{"Let me peek at them through a key hole, Matt." System "C:Run >NIL: Multiview BOMB:PowerUps"}

Allow me to hand over to Jon and Beej, and a lesson in semantics.

@{FG HIGHLIGHT}Extra Bomb@{FG TEXT}
Gives the ability to lay an extra bomb concurrently for the remainder of
the round.

@{FG HIGHLIGHT}Fire Power@{FG TEXT}
Makes the length of the flame from your bombs one square longer for the
remainder of the round.

@{FG HIGHLIGHT}Detonate@{FG TEXT}
Sets off all bombs as soon as it is collected.

@{FG HIGHLIGHT}Random@{FG TEXT}
Randomly selects one of the other power-ups.

@{FG HIGHLIGHT}Reverse Control@{FG TEXT}
After collection, pressing 'Up' moves your player 'Down', and pressing
'Left' moves your player 'Right', etc. The fire button is not affected.
This lasts for a set period of time which is extended if further reverse
control power-ups are collected.

@{FG HIGHLIGHT}Shield@{FG TEXT}
Makes your player invulnerable to both bombs and the 'Death' power-up for a
set period of time.

@{FG HIGHLIGHT}Death@{FG TEXT}
Kills your player instantly, unless the shield power-up is still active.

@{FG HIGHLIGHT}Freeze Opponents@{FG TEXT}
Stops all other players at their current positions for a set period of
time, which is extended for longer if further freeze opponent power-ups are
collected.

@{FG HIGHLIGHT}Reveal Power-ups@{FG TEXT}
Removes the rubble from all squares which contain a power-up.  A second
reveal power-ups will have no effect.

@{FG HIGHLIGHT}Autolay@{FG TEXT}
When your player can lay a bomb (ie. when your player is not already on top
of a bomb, and your player still has bombs to be laid), the bomb is
automatically layed.  This continues until the end of the round, or until
you collect another autolay power-up.

@{FG HIGHLIGHT}Opponent slowdown@{FG TEXT}
All other players slow down to half their normal speed for a set period of
time.  This time is extended if you collect another opponent slowdown
power-up.

@{FG HIGHLIGHT}Slowdown@{FG TEXT}
Slows your player down to half of their normal speed for a set period of
time.  This time is extended if you collect further slowdown power-ups.

@{FG HIGHLIGHT}Diddy Bombs@{FG TEXT}
Immediately changes your player fire power to a length of one square, and
makes the number of bombs which you may concurrently lay one.  You may
collect further extra bomb or fire power power-ups to rebuild your arsenal.

@{FG HIGHLIGHT}Teleport@{FG TEXT}
Moves your player to a random empty square in the playing area straight
away.  When teleport mode is 'Shifting', the player will move towards the
selected empty square at their normal pace. 'Porting' mode will move the
player to the empty square immediately.

@{FG HIGHLIGHT}Slippy-Slidey (Ice World)@{FG TEXT}
Continues to attempt to move your player in the most recently selected
direction even if you have stopped your player. This lasts for a set period
of time which is extended if you collect further Slippy-slidey power-ups.

Let me hand you over to Owain, and his own inimitable cursive syle.

A splendid version with player charcteristics and a very fast game engine.
It truly is @{b}BOMB@{ub}, but on an Arch. Written in 100% ARM code, with
joystick compatability for A3010's (and anybody else with a joystick
module), speed setting so you can run it in turbo modes, 6 (six) player
simultanious game play, play with or against your friends, or even on your
own if you don't have any!

Ok, if you actually want to know where a copy of BOMB can be got from, then
you may be in luck! Depending whether I've released it as PD otherwise
it'll cost you. Any enquiries, write to the following address, send a stamp
and a disc if you want anything back (No stamp, and I don't return it!!)
Please make sure the disc has a nice label on it so I don't loose it, and
make sure that you send your address. And no I don't personally have an
e-mail address, however if you send a message to @{i}BOMBArc@Sircus.demon.co.uk@{ui}
then it will get answered.

Ok, write to:

                             -================-

Several options which affect the gameplay have also been included in the
game. This generally changes the duration of specific power-ups, or deals
with other in-game parameters.

@{FG HIGHLIGHT}Bomb Type@{FG TEXT}
This is the way in which the bombs count down to zero. They can either be
represented by @{i}counting@{ui} bombs of the same size, or by @{i}swelling@{ui} bombs
which grow larger as the fuse time elapses, or as pulsating bombs which
swell the bombs in and out until they explode.

@{FG HIGHLIGHT}Bomb Timing@{FG TEXT}
The time it takes for the bomb to explode after being laid by a player can
be specified here.

@{FG HIGHLIGHT}Home Advantage@{FG TEXT}
Because every player in the game has a home ground, they all receive a
bonus power-up when they play on home soil. The home player may either
start with one extra bomb, a longer flame, or neither.

@{FG HIGHLIGHT}Stuart Campbell@{FG TEXT}
For those of you that do not know WHO this gentleman is, let US inform you
that DEAR Stu was big cheese at top English magazine @{b}AMIGA POWER@{ub}, until
he somehow found himself working for @{i}Sensible Software@{ui} in SAFFRON WALDON.
The git. But then, in a position MANY Amigans are envious of, he promptly
instigates one of the most foul software crimes of this century. Yes my
friends, Stuart is the man responsible for the PURPLE ALIEN LEVELS in
@{i}Cannon Fodder 2@{ui}. To REMIND you of this most heinous act, we give you THREE
LEVELS of CAMPBELLNESS - None, Purple, and Very Purple.

@{FG HIGHLIGHT}Link Side@{FG TEXT}
Used to select which of the two machines in a link game is which.
NB: This is ONLY used in the @{"registered" Link registration} version of the game.

@{FG HIGHLIGHT}Shield on Startup@{FG TEXT}
When selected, this option gives every player a shield of invulnerability
as soon as the game starts. This is to prevent those trigger-happy folk
dying a premature death. It will still run out after the defined time.

@{FG HIGHLIGHT}Shield Time@{FG TEXT}
You may set the duration of every shield here in seconds.

@{FG HIGHLIGHT}Freeze Time@{FG TEXT}
This defines the period of time in seconds for which players are frozen
whenever the 'Freeze Opponents' power-up is collected.

@{FG HIGHLIGHT}Speedup Time@{FG TEXT}
The time in seconds for which players are slowed down, whether
comparatively (opponents) or directly (yourself).

@{FG HIGHLIGHT}Reverse Time@{FG TEXT}
Here the duration of the 'Reverse Controls' power-up can be set in seconds.

@{FG HIGHLIGHT}Exploding Death@{FG TEXT}
With this set, a bomb will explode the moment a player dies. With any luck,
the dying players may take other players with them !

@{FG HIGHLIGHT}Teleport Mode@{FG TEXT}
The 'Teleport' power-up has two settings - on @{i}Shifting@{ui}, the teleporting
player will move horizontally and vertically across the game area until the
destination is reached. @{i}Porting@{ui} will cause the player to appear at the new
destination square immediately.

@{FG HIGHLIGHT}Slippy-slidey Time@{FG TEXT}
The time it takes until this power-up wears off can be set here in seconds.
