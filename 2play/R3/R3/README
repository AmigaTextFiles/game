This game was once distributed on floppies but this archive is now ready to run from hard-disk.

There is no registration for R3 anymore, but you can send whatever you think this game is worth to:

I have registered this copy to "Any Amiga User" and it may be freely distributed.
Note: Some text in-game is out of date.  Contact me if you have any questions.

R3 Info:

   - Try putting a cardboard divider in front of the monitor so the
     players can't see each other in dogfights.  It makes things quite
     interesting (especially if like me, you became good at watching
     both screens simultaneously).

   - An extra levelset for R3 is now included called "Bonus1". 
     This will give you another 55 levels!

   - Theres an R3 worms level for you if you have the game Worms.
