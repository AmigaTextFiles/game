@node BUG "Sorry, but there is a very big bug !"
   I don't know why but Bomber Gug doesn't run fast when it's not run on an Amiga 1200 with
an 68030 28 Mhz processor.I think it's the fault of Blitz Basic but if you know how to kill
this big problem, @{"contact me !!" LINK CONTACT}

@node BESOIN "What do you need"
      Bomber Gug v1.0 works with :
      - An Amiga of course : from A500 to A4000.
      - Two pads or two joysticks.
      - At least 1 MO of memory
      - Bomber Gug (of course !!)
      - Some programs in C: : Endcli, Copy, Assign
      - Some libraries (I don't know them but I think there isn't any problem)
      - Workbench from version 2.0 (I think)
      - Asl.library

  of Fast memory , an Hard disk of 257 MO, a Cd-Rom x4,with the Workbench 3.0 with
  a screen 640x480 in Multiscan/Productivity in 32 colors.

@node LANGUE "How to change the language of the game ?"
      If you want to change the language of the game without @{"reinstall" LINK INSTALLATION} it
   you must use Install_Langue program.How does it work ?
      - Double click on his icon (in the Workbench of course !)
      - A window will appear. 
      - There are just 2 languages : French and English.If you want more languages
        @{"contact me !" LINK CONTACT}
      - Choice your language with the numbers : 1 or 2
      - Deprotect your disk (if you have Bomber Gug on a disk)
      - Wait a few seconds.
      - Your language is installed.
   There is an another way : edit - if it exists - the file Langue, on the first line
   write Francais to have french in the game
         Anglais  to have english in the game
   Then save this file in Ascii.

   If you know the rules of BomberMan, you know the rules of Bomber Gug.
   For the people who don't know BomberMan, in the game, the last player who is on
   the screen is the winner.For that, the player must kill the other to win.To kill
   the other players, you have to put bombs.And after a few second, the bomb explode
   and fire appear on the 4 directions : up, down, right, left.If a player is on fire,
   he die.On the screen, there are bricks,if the fire appear on a brick,the brick
   explode and a bonus (or a malus) can appear.The bonus are (you have to find yourself
   how they are in the game)
    - More fire : Fire of the bombs are more long
    - More bomb  : You can put +1 bomb.
    - ?              : Random bonus
    - Mega fire   : Fire of the the bombs are very very long for few seconds
    - Fire wall : fire go trough of the wall but no bonus appear.
    - Automatic bomb : when you go forward , a bomb appear automaticelly.Dangerous !!
    - 1 bomb : the other player had 1 bomb
