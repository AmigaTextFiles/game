@node "INTRO" "What is this??"

@{bg fill}@{fg highlight}Introduction@{fg text}@{bg background}

Saucery is for two players only. Each player controls
a little flying saucer and ,of course, your goal is to
(virtually) kill the other player.

@node "HOWTO" "How to play."

@{bg fill}@{fg highlight}The Menu:@{fg text}@{bg background}

Use arrow-keys or joystick in port2 to select item.
Use enter-key or Joystick button to activate item.

The menu is divided into five parts.

@{fg fill}The first:@{fg text}
"Start Game"  -Goto next menu part.
"Credits"     -Shows who made this game.
"Exit"        -quits the game.

@{fg fill}The second and third:@{fg text}
Here you select your craft.

@{fg fill}The fourth:@{fg text}
Here you select how many times to win on each battleground.
After each battleground you will be asked if you want to
play another round.

@{fg fill}The fifth:@{fg text}
Here you select a battleground.


@{bg fill}@{fg highlight}In the game:@{fg text}@{bg background}

First of all, player one might hit [J] or [K] to change between
joystick in port1 and keyboard control. Keyboard is default.
That's because otherwise the mouse would piss you off real easy.

@{fg fill}The keys for player one are:@{fg text}

   @{b}Up:@{ub} [Q]
 @{b}Down:@{ub} [A]
 @{b}Left:@{ub} [Z]
@{b}Right:@{ub} [X]
 @{b}Fire:@{ub} [Space]

There are no conflicts with these keys, so there's no reason to
change them. Hahaha.

@{fg fill}And for player two:@{fg text}

The arrow-keys and [Enter], or the joystick in port2.
There's no need for player two to change between joystick and
keyboard, they work simultaneously.

@{fg fill}Other keys:@{fg text}

[P] pauses the game.
[Esc] Quits the game.

@node "REQUIRE" "What you need."

@NODE "POWERUPS" "Goodies"

@{bg fill}@{fg highlight}Power-ups:@{fg text}@{bg background}

When you take a power-up, a countdown starts. You can see it
in the status-bar. When the countdown reaches zero, the effect
of the power-up will go away.


@{fg fill}Faster sight:@{fg text}
This power-up increases the speed with which your sight (the
little white dot) rotates around your saucer. It can be very good
if your opponent's driving a slow saucer.
Just fly around your opponent in circles and shoot. Your
opponent's sight won't be fast enough, so he won't be able to hit
you. The symbol in the status bar for this one is a yellow little
this with a black S on.

@{fg fill}Speed increase:@{fg text}
This one simply increases your saucer's speed.
The symbol is a "speedy" red S.

@{fg fill}Super bounce:@{fg text}
This mean little thing makes your saucer bounce more when you hit
a wall. Can be very frustrating some times.
The symbol for this one is a tiny little saucer with four arrows
around.

@{fg fill}Gravity:@{fg text}
This power-up adds some gravity to your opponent's saucer.
Very frustrating - for him!
Symbol: A little saucer with an arrow under.

@{fg fill}Med-kit:@{fg text}
This one is not like the other power-ups. It simply gives you some
more energy. It's not controlled by any timer, and it's got it's
own box too.

@{fg fill}Inverted controls:@{fg text}
Haha! If you take this one, your opponent's controls will be inverted!
I.e. if he pulls his joystick to the right, he'll go to the left.
Muahaha.


@{bg fill}@{fg highlight}Weapons:@{fg text}@{bg background}

@{fg fill}First grade:@{fg text}
This is the standard ammo that you have when you start at a
battleground. You have an unlimited number of these, so don't be
affraid of running out of them.

@{fg fill}Second grade:@{fg text}
These green shots are a bit more powerful than the red ones.
A bit bigger too. But you can only get them by taking one of the
little animating green things popping up here and there in the game.

@{fg fill}Third grade:@{fg text}
Wooha! Be careful with these! You can only get them by finding them.
If you see a yellow animating little circle, go for it!
These shots are BIG, and really deadly. But you only get 20 of them
for every yellow thing you take.
