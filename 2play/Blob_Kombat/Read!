  ABSTRACT:  Welcome to "Blob Kombat", a simple, yet addictive, game which
  ~~~~~~~~   requires only one or two friends and an AMIGA 1200. We hope you
  will have as much fun playing this game as we did creating it during the 
  long, hot summer of 1995.

                                 oOoOoOoOoOo

  SHAREWARE MESSAGE: This version of Blob Kombat is only a demo. The full
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  version cost only six pounds to buy and features...

  o Twenty levels of multi-player mayhem
  o Some graphical embellishments
  o A level editor
  o A copy of the BLITZ 2 source code
  o Full support from PINK PIG SOFTWARE
  o The satisfaction of helping a fledgling software company in it`s infancy

  All you have to do is send a cheque or postal order for six pounds (seven
  pounds fifty pence outside the uk) payable to PINK PIG SOFTWARE to either
  of the address at the bottom of this document.

                                 oOoOoOoOoOo

  LOADING THE GAME: To play "Blob Kombat" all you have to do is double-click
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ on the "Play!" icon. The game should load without any 
  fuss. If it doesn't, then it is likely that you have a dodgy copy.
  REMEMBER: This game will only work on AMIGA 1200 and 4000 machines.

                                 oOoOoOoOoOo

  GAME OPTIONS: Selectable from the main menu, Game Options is used to
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~  alter the number of players and how they are controlled.
  The purple blob is player one and is always controlled through joystick 1.
  The green blob is player two and is always controlled by joystick 2 (the
  mouse port). The red blob is player three and is always controlled by the
  keyboard. You can switch any of these players on and off at will from this
  menu, but you can only exit if one or none of them is switched off. "Blob
  Kombat" is a two or three player game. The default setting is joystick 1 
  and the keyboard players switched on and the joystick 0 player switched 
  off. You can also alter the number of lives your blob starts with. This is
  restricted to between 3 and 9 lives.

                                 oOoOoOoOoOo

  PLAYING THE GAME: The aim of the game is simple. You are a blob who must
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  fight for your life in an arena against other blobs. To
  kill the other blobs you must jump onto their eyes and squash them. Upto
  three blobs may fight in the arena at once. The game allows for two 
  players on joysticks and one player on keys. The controls are simple:
  left and right move you left and right and fire makes you jump. If you
  hold down fire you can jump higher than if you tap it. When you die, the
  number of lives you have decreases. When your lives reach zero you are
  out of the game. The game continues until only one blob is left in the
  arena. After you die, if you have lives remaining, you are teleported back
  into the arena to continue fighting. You will be invincible for a short
  while.

                                 oOoOoOoOoOo

  POWER-UPS: Sometimes during play, a power-up token will appear. Grab the
  ~~~~~~~~~  token and it will affect either you or your opponents. The 
  power-ups available are colour-coded:

      EXTRA LIFE (Blue) - adds one to your lives. NOTE: You cannot have more
                          than nine lives.
      SLOW DOWN (Green) - slows your opponents down and makes them easier to
                          catch.
         BIG JUMP (Red) - makes you jump higher.
 INVINCIBILITY (Orange) - makes you invincible for a short period. While
                          you are invincible the other blobs will simply
                          bounce off your head.
        FREEZE (Purple) - turns the other blobs to stone
           WINGS (Grey) - you sprout wings and gain the ability to fly.

                                 oOoOoOoOoOo

  LOADING ARENAS: In the full game you can load from 20 arenas that we have
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  provided, and design your own with the Editor. However in
  this demo release, you can only play one level and the LOAD ARENA function
  on the main menu has been disabled.

                                 oOoOoOoOoOo
