                                   Overview

LOTEF is a high spec,  high-impact,  kung-fu, martial-arts, beat-em-up, for
Amiga  compatable computers.  Combining the power of  the  Amiga  with  the
gameplay of video gaming's golden age.

                            Hardware Requirements:

68020 processor
AGA chipset
512K chip or fast memory
plus another 512K chip memory (1 megabyte preferable)
1.7 megabytes HD space or 2 blank floppy disks
1 joystick or Amiga compatable joypad (2 preferable)

                            Software Requirements

Commodore's maths libraries

In  order to run LOTEF requires that Commodore's maths libraries (the  files
beginning math...  in the Libs directory on your Workbench disk)  be present
in the root directory of a disk called LIBS:.

The LIBS:  disk is a virtual disk created by the system when you boot up. By
default,   and  assuming one exists,  the system  sets  it  to  point  to  a
directory called Libs in the root directory of your boot disk.

LegendData: disk

LOTEF  also  requires that all files supplied in the LegendData.lha  archive
be oresent in the root directory of a disk called LegendData:.  This may  be
either a physical (hard or inserted floppy disk)  called LegendData:   or  a
virtual  disk  created using the Assign command,  pointing  to  a  directory
containing the required.

                                 Installation

Note:

The  following  installation instructions assume some  knowledge  of  Amiga
operating  system and the ability to use an LhA archive program  to  unpack
and LhA archive. For discussions on those subjects please see your Amiga
operating system documentation and LhA archive program documentation
respectively.

                               Archive Contents

	LegendEXE.lha	another archive containing game & docs
	LegendData.lha	another archive containing sound effects & music

                      General Installation Instructions

Use  an  LhA  compatable   archiving   program   to  fully  unpack  the  the
LegendEXE.lha and LegendData.lha archives to directories of your choice.

                   Installing to Floppy (suggested method)

Format  two  blank floppy disks,  naming them "LegendEXE" and  "LegendData".
Unpack  the  LegendEXE.lha  archive to the  disk  named  LegendEXE  and  the
LegendData.lha archive to the disk named LegendData.

                  Installing to Hard Disk (suggested method)

Fully  unpack  the  archives  LegendEXE.lha   and  LegendData.lha  into  one
directory  on your hard disk.  Add an entry in your start-up sequence  using
the Assign command to create a virtual disk called LegendData:  pointing  to
this  directory  (so that this is done automatically when  you  reboot  your
machine). Reboot your machine.
