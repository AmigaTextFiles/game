                   © by Chaotic Byte Productions 1997


This is the registered version, and it's MAILWARE. It originally was Shareware,
but nearly nobody seemed to be interested in.

If you still want to register, just do as it is written later.

A huge Guide to explain everything is included (only german, sorry :-()

Crossfire is a very variable 2-4 Player Shoot`emUp-Game including:

       - 20 Weapons 
       - 15 other Items
       - up to 25 rounds to fight
       - Highscores
       - Prefs-Program to configure (nearly) everything you want to

       At this moment I don`t have a web-page, but maybe later...




Installing Crossfire:
---------------------

       Simply copy all the files anywhere to your harddisc,
       change to this directory and start Crossfire (or the
       Prefs-Programm).


Minimum Configuration:
----------------------

       Any Amiga with at least 2 MB CHIP-Ram, a 020 CPU and PAL!!!
       I'll soon upload a patch to make it work on a 68000 CPU.
       It`s very difficult code the game NTSC-compatible,
       so don`t await a patch soon. Maybe I add a couple of lines 
       that force PAL, but NTSC-User will need a Multiscan-Monitor 
       to use it.


Recommended Configuration:
--------------------------

       030/50 MHz, 2 MB Chip, 2 MB Fast


The Game is tested with: 
------------------------

       - Amiga 1200, 030/50, 4 MB Fast, OS 3.0
       - Amiga 1200, 030/50, 16 MB Fast, OS 3.0
       - Amiga 1200, 060/50, 16 MB Fast, OS 3.0 
       - Amiga 4000, PPC604e/180 & 060/50, 64 MB Fast, OS 3.1 (my Amiga)



Switching of my turboboard, the Game runs correctly, so I think, it
also should work with a unexpanded A1200 (don`t expect fast action at
such a lame machine (and by such an idiotic BASIC-Coder;))

A500-Users: Don`t blame me, buy a computer!




---------------------------------------------------------------------




First: I`m a coder, not a artist, so don`t blame me about the graphics,
------ draw better graphics!

       I`m german, so my English-knowledge isn`t very good.
       If you have found some mistakes, please email me,
       I`ll correct it as fast as possible.

       Keys 1...............:   RShift/RAlt to accellerate forward/backward

Use Keys 3 only, of only one player uses keyboard or you own a A4000.
There are some problems with the keyboard-controller of the A1200, so don`t
blame me for these horrible key-combinations.




THE HISTORY SO FAR:
-------------------

The year 68030: Some scientists discover the remains of an old civilisation
                inside some asteroids far away from earth. The government
                of earth decides to research this technologie.

The year 68060: Now, the government has stopped its financial support.
                Money is needed. To finance the further research, the 
                scientists decide to use this technologie in a game show.
                This game show is called CROSSFIRE.



THE GAME:
---------


Keys:
       HELP.................:   Pause
       ESC..................:   Back to Main Menu
   

After several Info-Screens (switchable with the Prefs-Prog), the spaceships
start inside a asteroid. Sometimes some spheres are beamed into the arena, 
they may activate a special ability if collected, explode or shot back.

The more damage you inflict, the more points you get. Killing a enemy ship 
scores 20 Points, getting to the end of a round alive scores 30 Points.

The round ends, if less than 2 players are alive.

TEAMMODE:
Player 1 and 2 are Team 1, Player 3 und 4 are Team 2.
Its impossible to hit the teampartner by shooting at him, player mines 
doesn`t react to teampartners, but explosions damage all players.

Round ends, if both players of one team are killed. Every ship of the
winning team scores 20 Points.

Hiscores are impossible with Teammode.


At the end of every round a (switchable) Infoscreen appears, informing
about the scores of the round. 
Pressing "S" at this screen saves the fight for Replay (only registered
version).



SHOW REPLAY:
------------

A requester appears asking you for the name of the replay.
It can be stopped by pressing ESC. You can press "R" at any time of the
Replay and play the rest again. 



PERSONAL NOTE:
--------------


The first lines of this game were written in october of 1996, I typed
it three times (somewhat with the power-supply-cabel). Every try the
source gets shorter and faster.
At this moment it was a game for 2 Players, a bullet like an apple and 
the ships had only 16 directions. 
For nearly 14 months I tested the game with everyone I was able to convince to,
adding everything I ever wanted to have in such a game. I never made a list
of features the game should have.

Now this game reflects very accuratly what I think a Multiplayer-Game have
to be. (For example, the ships now have 64 directions to shot!)

When ever I thought, the game is complete, something new comes into
mind, which the game should have. When ever I wanted the kick the f**king
game far away, some people encouraged me to do go further. These people
I want to thank for their suggestions, ideas and their mental support:

        My brother Stefan for many ideas, testfights and his moral
                   support ("Code, or I`ll kick you in your ...!" ;))
                   Maybe you`ll get 10%.

        My brother Uwe for some ideas, some testfights and some
                   moral support
                   Maybe I`ll invite you to McDonalds ;)

        Dirk Böhme for being my second Backup-Harddisc, many Testfights
                   and some ideas

        All the people who had to test the game (everyone is (still) alive)

        Some Shareware-Games, which have earned my respect and which have
                   given me some inspiration.

        Many Games (Shareware or Full Price), where I thought, the coders
                   never played their own games. Some ... really BAD 
                   mistakes in such fundamental things like the Controls,
                   I thought, there a mistake is found at FIRST! 
                   Even in Full-Price-Games I saw problems I solved in
                   version V1.08! 
                   I don`t wonder about the dying of the AMIGA with such
                   an lack of motivation...



PS: There is a SPECIAL MODE hidden somewhere in the game, try to find it!
