Practice your landing technique. How exciting. Landing Second Third or Fourth will give you penalties, as with all Scenarios, so get used to it. 
Somewhere over the Alps, a design fault causes a 747 to detonate it's own engines. In the ensuing blast luggage rains from the sky. ABUSE IT! 
The Flying Doctors are blasted from the sky by an offended Australian. Medical supplies rain upon Oz. ABUSE THEM! 
An incredible cloning experiment, and a tragic explosion. The brilliant intellect of Professor Hawking plummets to his doom a hundred times over. As a crew member, save him or ABUSE HIM! 
A terrorist explosion leaves confused passengers plummeting to earth among an armoury of weapons. ABUSE THEM! 
Only one parachute among many, what will be the outcome?           Perfect or Pancake?

Unlike the crew, the passengers are fortunate enough to pile into the lifeboat as the plane dips toward it's fiery demise.           The boat plummets earthbound, but not as fast as the doomed crew. Can you save them, or simply ABUSE THEM!
Ha you're IT. Escape the flying cling-on before you reach the ground, or you're in for a shock. 
Prove your humanity in this distasteful sub-game. You are not the only passengers thrown from the plane. With a look to the skies, you watch in horror as children plummet to earth.

Now the Computer hates you.           Nazi AI is a secret mode for one human Vs. three computer players.
