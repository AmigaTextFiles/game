Yikes!, welcome to|F L A T  M A T E S| |A Pro Skydiving Simulator.

My name is ?

Firstly lets get to grips|with the tricky art of |gliding through the sky. 
106 P
Moving left and right is easy|Just move the joystick,|and I'll glide in the|appropriate direction. 
106 P
To descend just|pull down and I'll|plummet earthwards.... 
106 P
Push up, and I'll leap up,|gaining a little height.|Tap up again, to leap again.|Now, Practice makes perfect. 
180 P
Hmmm, Sounds like another jet|up in flames, and I can|see some luggage has|been blown from the hold. 
106 P
You'd be surprised how|often this happens in|Flat Mates. 
106 P
To grab this debris|Just glide toward it|and once it's in reach|press and hold Fire. 
106 P
Once caught, Press and|hold Fire again, then|push the direction you|want to throw the item. 
180 P
Now, I'm pleased to|introduce my co-host.|A most gifted scientist|who needs no introduction. 
106 H
Thank you. My name is|Stephen Hawking, master|of chaos Theory. |Here to discuss debris. 
106 H
Although the only debris|you can see are suitcases,|there are many different|items that fall from the sky. 
106 H
By experimenting with the|many game scenarios you|can discover each item and|how it is used..... 
106 P
The good professor has|also graciously agreed|to act as an impromptu|target practice....|
106 H
PARDON? Have you no|respect for a superior.|intellect, you SON OF A|BASTARDS BASTARDS BASTARD! 
180 P
Well it's about time to land.|Aim toward the landing pad|sporting my picture and |painted in my colour. 
106 H
I can't see my pad down|there. How do I land |safely? 
106 P
Not to worry, your|parachute will see you|down safely. Press fire|when you need to open it. 
106 H
My para....| |OH FUCK! 
106 P
Superior intellect? Ha.|Anyway, remember the|first to land safely|gets best landing points. 
100 P
What great a landing!|A good player like you|should type NAZI AI on|the options screen....
100 P
You have slain the Prof.|A sick player like you|should type CHAOS THEORY|on the options screen...
