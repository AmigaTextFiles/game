@NODE INTRO "So what's it all about?"

  @{FG SHINE}Flat Mates@{FG TEXT} is a four player game of action, reflexes and questionable
taste. Sky diving for the violently inclined. 

@{FG FILL}@{B}The Story so far...@{UB}@{FG TEXT}
  They searched for the ultimate thrill. Four adrenaline junkies who'd 
tried every "Xtreme" sport known to man. Bungee, absailing, waterfall
kayaking, snowboarding and sky diving. Not even drinking a sickly sweet
brand of cola on top of a skyscraper could get these guys "To the MAX".
  Now all four sat huddled in the frosty interior of the hold. The plane's
engines roared in their ears, trembling through their feet.
  "We shouldn't @{B}do@{UB} this you know. Think of the @{B}danger@{UB}." said a man.
  "We might be @{B}seriously hurt@{UB}." said another.
  "We might @{B}not even live@{UB} to the days end." said the third.
  "@{B}YEAH! LET'S DO IT MAN!@{UB}" said the fourth.
  "@{B}TO THE MAX!@{UB}" they shouted, holding their fingers in an odd way.
  The first man planted the plastic charge and leapt back behind the wall
of luggage stacked in the hold. As the timer counted from @{B}10 @{UB}they
all prepared themselves for their ultimate thrill. 
  An almighty explosion deafened all in the hold, before they and the 
luggage were ripped out of the plane in a great howl of rushing winds.
  From the plane, passangers watched in dismay, as their luggage plummeted
to earth amoung the four whooping and cheering men.
  "LET'S GO!" screamed one, grabbing a small tartan holdall and hefting
it off the second man at speed.
  "@{B}HA!@{UB} ONE POINT TO ME" screamed the first man, above the roar of the wind.
Then they leapt to grab luggage, and all hell broke loose as the skydiving
battle began.

@{FG FILL}@{B}And so...@{UB}@{FG TEXT}  
  Wow, are you still reading? Look if people think a game like Street
Fighter needs a ridiculous background story, I can have one too alright.
  Pick up a joystick and just play the game, no tedious background
story is required.
@ENDNODE

@NODE REQUIRE "So what do I need to run this?"

  @{B}Requirements@{UB}
    - An AGA amiga
    - 2mb Chip and 2mb Fast RAM
    - 020 processor   
    - OS 2.0 and above
    
  @{B}Recommended@{UB}
    - 030 processor and above
    - Four player adaptor + 4 joysticks
    - A kicking stereo 

  Flat Mates @{I}might@{UI} even work on a basic A1200 but would be unplayably
slow without some fast RAM. 

  Also PC Users. Don't even @{B}think@{UB} about using UAE to play this
unless you enjoy horrible frame rates, and stuttering music. As
fantastic as UAE is, it just doesn't like Blitz games.
  My Athlon 1.3 Ghz with 64MB Geforce 2 is unable to keep a steady
framerate. Mind you, future releases of UAE will no doubt improve things,
seeing as this emulator just gets better with every release. Keep up the
good work boys!

@NODE INSTALL "Flat Mates. Doesn't like 3½ inch floppies."

    @{FG FILL}Flat Mates@{FG TEXT} is @{B}hard disk only@{UB}. There I said it. And unless
  anyone want's to pay me good hard cash, I'm not ever going to make it
  floppy disk compatible.
    That aside, if you don't have a hard disk in this day and age you
  @{B}deserve@{UB} to wallow in the ignomy of slow access times.

    Installation is a (fairly) painless process, as long as you have a
  @{I}little@{UI} knowledge of file handling. If it's your first time,
  I @{U}promise@{UU} to be gentle.

    First of all, make sure you have @{B}both@{UB} disks unarchived into the same
  drawer. Both archives will create a drawer called Flatmates, so by 
  unarchiving them both to the same place will work perfectly.
                                 
    Okay, now Unarchive the INSTALLME.lha to a temp drawer such as RAM:

    Now copy the two system fonts and drawers,
      @{B}Mega.font
      Widetop.font@{UB} 
      and their directories into your current @{B}FONTS:@{UB} directory.

    Done that, good. Now for the libraries.
      @{B}Diskfont.library
      Playsid.library
      mathtrans.library@{UB}
    Which are copied into @{B}LIBS:@{UB} directory.

    And that's it, just click on the lovely Hostess and away you go!

    Well that wasn't so painful was it? Oh it was. Sorry, I should
  have used some lubricant.

    If you find any problems, @{"e-mail or write to me" LINK SIMON}.

@NODE INSPIRATION "Tedious Diary of a Game"
  @{FG SHINE}@{B}Flat Mates@{UB}@{FG TEXT} is short, competitive, round based game for @{B}1-4@{UB} players.
How each round plays depends on the @{I}options@{UI} setup, but you can learn
@{B}all@{UB} of that from playing the game.
  It's unlike any other game but I must admit I drew inspiration from 
a number of sources, so if you enjoy boring text, @{B}read on!@{UB}

  Back in febraury '98 I picked up a second hand @{B}Atari 2600@{UB}, and a
cartridge of 50 games. After playing 49 of them I had another childhood
illusion shattered. Some things are really best left in the past,
and these appaling games were top of list. 
  Game number 50 was something else though. A two player game where
two badly drawn stick men had to leap from a plane to a landing pad
and land before his opponent. It had an odd playability and
competitive edge that made me enjoy it @{I}thorougly@{UI}.

  So I decided to write a version for the Amiga. It was @{B}shite@{UB}! so other
than adding an amusing death animation I left it at that and had no
intention of going back to it.      

  The following summer however I had to listen to the boasts of some
chums who went on a skydiving course, and what an @{I}extreme rush@{UI} it is.
Most of that month I'd spent playing the @{B}fantastic@{UB} game by Treasure
Michief Makers. An astoundingly original game where your main weapon
was your ability to grab absolutly anything and use it against your
enemies. I thoroughly recommend anyone who still has an N64 get this game.

  @{I}Anyway@{UI}, so it was this game evolved. A skydiving game where your
main weapon was your ability to grab anything from the sky and use
it against your enemy. From there, various ideas were drawn together
and now you have the finished product, @{B}two years@{UB} later.

  I've @{B}finally@{UB} decided to release while there are still Amiga users
left to play the damn thing. I hope you enjoy this as much as my
friends and I have.


  @{B}Happy Skydiving,

          Simon.@{UB}




  @{I}P.S. Wow, you really read this far? You deserve some kind of prize,
    on the options screen try typing BLUE SKY to rid each round of
    any clouds. The game doesn't look as nice, but the game runs 
    faster on less grunty machines.@{UI}

@NODE THANKS "Thanks to..."
  I put @{B}all@{UB} the effort into this game so I'd like to @{B}thank@{UB} me and
@{B}nobody else@{UB}.

  Only joking, I'm not the only one responsible for bringing this
travesty of good taste to the public. 
                              
@{FG FILL}The People...@{FG TEXT}
  @{FG SHINE}Angus Arthur@{FG TEXT}
    Angus helped me with any graphics that were looking a bit tricky,
  and also helped with ideas, playtesting and encouragement.

  @{FG SHINE}Per Hakan Sundell@{FG TEXT} and @{FG SHINE}Ron Birk@{FG TEXT}
    For creating @{I}PlaySID@{UI}. The C64 player for the Amiga. This game
  has many pieces of C64 music scattered through it, which any
  fan of it's odd synthisysed music will spot a mile off.
    I tried to e-mail these guys to ask their permission to use
  their library, but they've done a Lord Lucan and disappeared.
    Never mind, it's a free game and I'm not trying to profit from
  their work, so I'm sure they wouldn't @{"mind too much" LINK DISCLAIMER} eh? ;-)    

  @{FG SHINE}The Musicians@{FG TEXT}
    I freely admit not a single piece of music in this game was by me.
  I think good music adds a great deal of atmosphere to a game, but
  I personally have all the musical talent of 100 Andrew Lloyd Webber's
  or approximatly half a Chris De Berg. So pretty dreadful really.
    There's a long list of credits here, but again, the game is free
  and I'm not gaining any profits from this, so I'm sure they won't
  @{"mind" LINK DISCLAIMER} me using their fabulous tunes.

  To the best of my knowledge @{FG FILL}Flat Mates@{FG TEXT} poses no danger to your
Amiga and has never caused me any trouble.

  If, however as a result of playing Flat Mates your Amiga should become
host to a @{I}Candarian Demon@{UI} who taunts you with voices urging you to @{FG FILL}@{B}kill@{UB}@{FG TEXT}
your friends and family I accept no responsibility.

  I also accept no responsibility for anything else which goes wrong as
a result of Flat Mates.

  Of course, I hope everything is fine. @{B}Good Luck@{UB} and I hope you find this
game at least half as fun as I do.

  On a final note, if @{B}anyone@{UB} responsible for @{B}any@{UB} of the things I used
in the game really is pissed off about it, @{"e-mail me" LINK SIMON} and I'll set about
removing it from Flat Mates with muchos apologies.

  But remember, It's a free game man! Share the wealth, and @{FG FILL}enjoy@{FG TEXT}.

  This is my gift to you, the @{FG FILL}Amiga@{FG TEXT} and @{FG FILL}Blitz@{FG TEXT} community. ;-}

  All I ask is that you send me anything that you @{B}personally@{UB} like.
  If you can't think of anything, here are some good examples.

    In no particular order.......
              * @{BG FILL} Curious IFF, GIF or JPG Pictures        @{BG BACK}
              * @{BG FILL} Curious MED, MOD or SID tunes           @{BG BACK}
              * @{BG FILL} Curious Blitz 2 or AMOS programs/games. @{BG BACK}
              * @{BG FILL} Curious P.D. games                      @{BG BACK}

    Send anything you like, as long as it's curious and legal. But don't
  feel obligated, as long as you enjoy it.
    If you enjoy Flatmates, at least send an e-mail to say so. It would
  give me a warm feeling inside (like heartburn).

  @{" Here's where to send things... " LINK SIMON}

  @{i}  Anyone who want's to include this on their CD's, Coverdisk or

@NODE SECRET "Hidden Niceness"

  @{B}Woo-hoo@{UB}, you've found the @{FG FILL}secret@{FG TEXT} page.

    I guess I'll tell you a few tips and tricks for the game, but
  shh! Don't tell anyone.
               
  * Getting a perfect score in the Tutorial gets you access to a
    secret one player mode. (10 point landing)
  * Knocking the Prof. unconcious in the Tutorial earns you a
    secret character.
  * Having the PS Die Hard Trilogy CD in your drive on boot-up
    causes Flat Mates to use it's music instead of it's own.
  * Typing MARIOLAND on the options screen replaces the clouds
    with the happy clouds from Super Mario World.
  * Type PAMPERS on the options screen to play a full game of
    the bouncing babies sub game.

    There might be more, but I'm @{I}still not telling@{UI}...
