OBJECTIVE: shut BLAST DOORS.

 this sector contains 4 blast doors< indicated below on the
 map. you must close them all before exiting.
            ------------------------------------
SELECTING MARINES:
 to switch between marines< use the NUMBER KEYS. the control
panel light @ number of a selected marine will be green. if
you are not in direct control of a trooper<  he will go into
automatic fire mode. any alien which crosses his line of fire
will be shot at. he will also turn to face an alien if he is
attacked.
 NOTE: the display does not centre on a selected marine
 unless you press the number key TWICE.

OPERATING MACHINERY:
when the cursor is placed on an operatable piece of machinery
(doors< lifts< computers etc.) it will become a hand pressing
a button. left click to operate it.
 if the marine is directly adjacent to the item< the cursor
will not change< in case you wish to move onto the doorway<
instead of closing the door. in this case use the central
icon strip or the keyboard shortcut (>q>/>y>).

WEAPONS: 1 marine in each squad is carrying a r.a.w< but
 the other 2 are carrying pulse rifles. these have better
 range @ accuracy< but do a lot less damage.
