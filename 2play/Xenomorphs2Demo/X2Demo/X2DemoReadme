1 PLAYING THE GAME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.0 The Screen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The main game screen is divided into:
 - The message bar at the top. This gives information on the
   mission as it progresses.
 - One or two game screens showing an overhead view of the
   troops.
 - A vertical strip of icons.
 - The control panel at the bottom. This shows information on the
   squad.
 - The scanner screen. This cannot always show the whole map at
   once and can be scrolled around.

1.1 The Icon strip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The iconstrip has the following icons:
- Select waypoints.
- Activate waypoints.
- Operate machinery.
- Pick up/Drop equipment.
- Use selected marine's manually operable equipment. (Player 1).
- Use selected marine's manually operable equipment. (Player 2).
- Display mission briefing.

1.2 The Control Panel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 For each marine this shows: (From left to right, top to bottom)

- The marine's number
- A light showing whether he is in manual or automatic control
  mode. (Green or red)
- The marine's current health compared to his maximum health.
- The selected piece of equipment.
- A thin red bar showing uses remaining in the equipment.
- The marine's rank.
- The main weapon.
- Number of remaining magazines. (A green number means +10 - eg a
  green 2 means 12. 10 is represented by the Roman numeral X)
- Rounds remaining in the current magazine.

1.3 The Scanner
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The scanner shows:
Currently selected marines     - Yellow
Squad 1 marines                - Blue
Squad 2 marines                - White
Other (Aliens, scientists etc.)- Red

The unidentified red blips will only be shown if one or more
marines are carrying a motion scanner.

If marines are carrying a mapper, the areas they have explored
will be shown here.

2 CONTROLS
~~~~~~~~~~
 You can select to control the troops with either joystick or
mouse. Note that the keyboard shortcuts will still work with
mouse control. (The most useful being "use equipment" and "cycle
through equipment").

2.0 MOUSE
~~~~~~~~~
2.0.0 Basic stuff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Click on the left mouse button to send a marine to a point.
Click on the right mouse button to turn towards a point. If the
marine is in line with that point then he will open fire. (Be a
bit careful turning near your own men). Click on the control
panel to select a different marine.

2.0.1 Picking things up
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the cursor is moved over an object then a hand will appear,
indicating that an object can be picked up. Left Click and the
marine will run to that spot and pick it up. To avoid this, move
directly adjacent to the equipment and then when you move onto
it, the marine will ignore it. When you are standing on an
equipment item, click on the marine to pick it up.

2.0.2 Operating things
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the cursor is moved over an object which can be operated
(doors, lifts, computers etc.) then it will become a hand
pressing a button. If you are directly adjacent to an object,
this function will be ignored. Face the object and left click on
either the marine himself, or the icon on the icon strip.

2.0.3 Waypoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These allow you to move several marines at once to a series of
preset points. They can be used to secure rooms and corridor
junctions extremely quickly. Either right click on the currently
selected marine, or select the top icon on the icon strip (the 
cursor will change to the waypoint cursor) and then left click to 
put in a series of points for each marine. 
Right click cancels points. To trigger the marines, left click on 
the 2nd icon on the icon strip. If you just want one marine to
move, then left click on him with the waypoint cursor.

2.1 KEYBOARD CONTROLS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These are used mainly in conjunction with the joystick, but they
are also useful as keyboard shortcuts with the mouse. The first
key given is for Player 1, the second is for Player 2.

2.1.0 Important Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Q / Y - Operate machinery and lifts/ Shut doors.
 S / J - Use equipment.
 D / K - Select equipment.
 X / M - Pick up equipment, ammo and weapons.
 F / L - Set auto-rotate directions.

2.1.1 Fairly useful keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 W / U - Fire grenades from heavy pulse rifle.
 A / H - Automatic fire mode selector.
 E / I - Fire (Same as joystick button).

2.1.2 Irrelevant stuff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 C / , - Swap equipment with the marine in front of you.
 Z / B - Give ammunition to the marine in front of you.
 V / . - Drop weapon.

2.2 SPECIAL CONTROLS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are a number of more complex ways to control your marines.
These are not essential to play the game and will probably
require a little experimentation to get the hang of.

2.2.0 Multi-directional automatic fire
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sometimes you will want a marine to cover more than one direction
at once, for example at a corridor junction. To do this, point
him in one of the directions which you want him to cover and
press F/L. A red arrow will appear, pointing in this direction.
Then rotate him to the other required direction and press it
again. He will switch into auto-fire mode, and begin to  rotate
between the two directions. This can also be achieved with the
mouse by selecting the "Set Waypoints" icon (right click on the
selected marine). Then press the right mouse button again
and sweep the cursor in the arc to be covered by the marine.

2.2.1 Lift operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Face the lift buttons (so they are just in front of the marine)
and press Q / Y to operate them. The green  button makes the lift
and occupants leave the sector. The red button calls the lift.
When a lift is called, you will hear a tone to notify you. Only
one lift in a sector can be called at a time. If the buttons have
been covered by debris then they cannot be operated.

2.2.2 Closing doors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Face the door and press Q / Y. If there is debris on the
doorway  it will not close unless it is a blast door.

2.3 USING EQUIPMENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some equipment is used automatically, but some must be operated
manually. The thin red bar under the equipment shows how many
uses are left. More information on all the following pieces of
equipment is available from the main selection screen under
"Equipment Details". To use a piece of equipment, press S/J, or
if you are using a mouse, left click on the equipment icon on the
control panel.
 To cycle through the 3 available equipment slots, press D/K or
right click on the equipment icon.

2.3.0 Sidearms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pistols, grenades, chainsaws and rockets are sidearms. They must
be selected to be used (in the currently displayed equipment
slot). If the trooper's main weapon runs out of ammo, then the
sidearm will be fired instead.
If you are using the mouse, then left click on the equipment icon
on the control panel. It will appear in a red circle next to the
cursor. Now right click to fire the sidearm. To return the cursor
to normal, right click on the trooper.

2.3.1 Passive equipment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Targeters, Access Cards, Infra-red Goggles, Force Fields,
Scanners, Mappers, Fire Resistant Suits, and Repulsion Fields are
passive equipment. These function automatically without being
selected.

3 ABOUT THE GAME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3.0 A Brief History
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
April 1993
 Started programming in AMOS. I'd done some BBC Basic years before.
By the end of the evening I had a couple of ships floating about,
and at the end of a week and a half I'd managed a crude two player
spaceship combat game called "StarDuel"

Sunday 25th April 1993
 Started programming Xenomorphs. It was inspired by a combination
of - "Quick Money" a fantastic 2 player PD game, the Games Workshop
boardgame "SpaceHulk" and of course "Aliens" itself. I wanted
to write a game with the following features:
- Simultaneous 2 player facility
- Fast and intelligent aliens.
- Several troops under each player's control

After a month it was fairly playable, but very crude compared to
 its current condition.

Over a year later, I released the first version in Summer 94 after
a year at university. It earned a mediocre review in Amiga User
International and sank without a trace. (The review compared it to
Alien Breed, which annoyed me intensely as the gameplay was
nothing like it).

As my course went on the work increased steadily and programming got
slower. I programmed "Tank Attack" which went onto the Aminet
in 1995. All the time Xenomorphs 2 dragged steadily towards completion.

I had a brief go at getting it published,(No thanks to Audiogenic
for lacking the basic courtesy of acknowledging correspondence),
but in the end it has ended up as Shareware.


3.1 Credits
~~~~~~~~~~~
Thanks to all who have had a hand in the creation of Xenomorphs,
by playtesting, designing levels, drawing graphics and just be
encouraging.

Special thanks to:
Brad for his relentless enthusiasm, for struggling with a ludicrously
unfriendly map editor, and for having a huge number of ideas.

Phil for relentless quotation, for late/all night sessions and for
mutual ideas as stupid as "Potatoes".

Dave for sorting out the music, which I had no chance of managing
myself.

Stuart for playing "Quickmoney" with me and triggering the whole
thing off.

Steve for being another late night dosser and for making us chuckle
with his ammo wastage and friendly fire incidents.

Mark for plodding through dreary final play testing and for nagging
me to finish it off.

The "Wierzbowski Hunters" and their web page. It's nice to find
someone else with an obsession that fuels pointless yet
hilarious in-jokes.

Michael for being amused by "Potatoes" when practically no-one else
was.

Also thanks to Nigel, Nick, James, Colin and everyone else who has
play tested it at some point.

HEARD TOO OFTEN
"Do the canisters explode yet?"
"Is it nearly finished?"

"I heard dat"
"You always say that, you always say...."
"Yeah man, but it's a dry heat."
Just about every other line from the film.

3.2 PROGRAMMERS AND MUSICIANS WANTED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I am currently programming a space strategy game in which the
player controls squadrons of small fighters. I would like someone
code a PC version, preferably in C. I am only interested in
someone who will definitely have the commitment to see the project
through to completion. Have you completed a project before of comparable size?

I am also unhappy with the current sound effects on Xenomorphs,
and would like someone who could re-work these. Also anyone
interested in doing the music and sound effects for the game
described above should also contact me.
