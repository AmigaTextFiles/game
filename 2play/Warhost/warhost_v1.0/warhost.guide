@NODE Game_Menu "Game Menu"

   The In-Game Menu Options are as follows:

   Before a game, each player must design their army.  Armies may be created
from any combination of troops (Soldiers, Tanks, or Planes).  Each troop
type has it's own pre-designed standard sub-types, which can be added by
clicking on the relevant button.
   To design custom Tanks or Planes, click on the Design button from the
relevant menu to enter the design screen.  Clicking with the left mouse
button on one of the characteristic buttons will add one point to that
characteristic, the right button will remove one point.
   To remove a troop, click on the Remove button, then on the relevant
troop.
   When done creating your army, click Done to let the next player create
their army.  When all the armies are ready, the landscape will be generated
and the game will begin.

   During the game:

   During the game, the computer will operate its tanks and civilians etc.
When a human player's troops need moving, the display will center on the
troop to be moved next.

   Clicking with the right mouse button at the edges of the map area will
scroll the map view.  Clicking with the left mouse button will cause the
tank to try to move towards the selected point.

   Selecting the Map button will bring up the full area map.  Clicking on
this map will zoom in on the selected area.  Clicking anywhere outside it
will return to the old zoomed area view.

   For normal troops, there will also be four firing buttons displayed -
Aimed, Standard, Autoshot and Snapshot.  Aimed shots double accuracy and
cost 8 points.  Standard shots give normal accuracy and cost 4 points.
Autoshots give three shots at 1/4 accuracy, costing 5 points.  Snapshots
give 1/2 accuracy and cost 2 points.  If the troop selected does not have
the required number of points then clicking a firing button will do nothing.

   Indirect firing troops only have one firing button, Indirect.  Indirect
fire costs 15 points, at extremely low accuracy, but these shots are do not
require line of site to the target.

   Clicking on the CONCEDE button will remove that player from the game -
their troops will, however, remain on the battlefield until the end of the
battle and may still be destroyed, as may normal troops.  They may not,
however, be moved or made to fire.  Troops belonging to a side that has
conceded are not displayed on the map view.

@NODE Registration "Registering Warhost"

   Warhost is a shareware game.  That is, it may be copied freely in accordance
with @{"Copyright Notice" LINK Copyright} given.  Most of the new features
introduced in this version are only available if a valid registration key is
present in the correct location on your system.  To obtain this key, you
must send a cheque for five pounds Sterling to the author's address, along
with your name.  You will then be sent either a disk containing your
individual registration key, or a UUencoded email containing the key,
whichever you prefer.  Keys sent by email will take less time to be
processed.  Keys sent on disk through the post will unfortunately have to be
sent on standard 720K format PC disks, since I may not always have access to
an Amiga to make keys on.  These disks may be read by CrossDOS, which is
bundled with OS2.x+ and is fairly easy to use.  Under OS3.x, it can be
loaded by double clicking on the PC0 icon in the DOSDrivers directory of the
Storage disk.

   See the @{" Contacting S.C.R " LINK Contact} screen for the address to
write to in order to register.

   If you choose not to register then that's fine, it's perfectly legal not
to, because the unregistered version is shareware.  It is illegal, however,
to copy the registration key for use by anyone else, or to modify the
executable in such a way as to bypass the key authorisation!

@NODE Background "Warhost Background"

   Warhost is a top-viewed strategic tank command game, based loosely around
a number of commercial and P.D. games, including U.F.O. and Scorched Tanks.
   Demis and I had been talking about this superb strategy game we
wanted to write which would be a combined battlefield strategy and overall
army management game, based in deep space, with you fighting away against all
manner of heinous alien foes with strange tentacled slimey eyes and stuff.
   Then he went back to work for Bullfrog, so we never got round to writing
it.  Instead, I wrote this little game because I wanted to write something
with a nice simple principle and nice straight-forward code, but with a
little bit of an edge.
   Thus Warhost was born.  It may not be much, but the un-registered
version, at least, is worth infinitely more than you have paid for it. =>

@NODE Starting "Getting Started in Warhost"

Playing the game:

   Double click on the Warhost icon.  The game should load.  If you haven't
installed the special font then the text will look a bit crap.  It may even
look a bit crap @{i}with@{ui} the special font, but that's a matter of
personal preference, so tough.  (Besides, I haven't got a font editor..)

@ENDNODE

@NODE Main_Menu "Using the Main Menu"

Main Menu

   There are four options on the main menu:

   1.  !!PLAY!!
      Starts a new game.

   2.  Options
      Brings up the game @{"options" LINK Options} menu.

   3.  Credits
      Shows the nice credits, telling you some useless stuff.

   4.  Quit
      Have a guess.  No, go on, do.  I dare you.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Control "Control during the game"

Control:

   All control in Warhost is currently mouse-driven.
   Click on buttons and they will do things.

   (I like to keep my interfaces sort of intuitive.)

@ENDNODE

@NODE Options "Warhost options menu"

Options:

      The Warhost options menu now features the following buttons:

      @{"Game" LINK Opt_Game}        - Edit the current game options.

      @{"Computer" LINK Opt_Comp}    - Set preferences for the computer-run players.

      @{"Graphics" LINK Opt_Gfx}    - Alter the graphics settings for the game.

      @{"Settings" LINK Opt_Set}    - Miscellaneous game options.

      @{"Map" LINK Opt_Map}         - Design your own maps by mixing and matching the provided
                     landscape features to your own tastes.

      @{"Save" LINK Opt_Save}        - Save your settings to disk. (REGISTERED)

@ENDNODE

@NODE Opt_Save "Saving Game Options"

   The registered version of Warhost V1.0 can save the players preferences
   to a file called Warhost.opt in the S: directory.  If the S:
   directory is unavailable then the save will fail.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Opt_Game "Game Options Menu"

   The Game Options menu lets the user edit the following properties:

   ARMIES:
      Sets the number of players in the game.  There can be from 1 to 4
      players, although 1 player mode is played as a battle against the
      computer and is not very difficult or fun. =<

   ROUNDS:
      Sets the number of rounds in the match, from 1 to 5.  Before each
      round, players are given some extra points with which to build new
      tanks.  Points may be carried over from previous rounds.  Any tanks
      remaining at the end of a round may be carried over into the next.

   SOLDIERS: (REGISTERED)
      Sets whether or not soldiers feature in the game.  Currently, this
      only causes the driver of any tank to appear in its place when it
      is destroyed.

   PLANES:   (REGISTERED)
      Sets whether or not planes are available when designing armies to
      play.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Opt_Comp "Computer Player Options"

   This screen allows the user to decide which computer-run players to
   include in the game.

   TANKS:
      Sets whether or not the computer will generate "neutral" tanks which
      will attack anyone and everyone.....

   PEOPLE:
      Sets whether or not the computer will generate extra civilians who
      will then wander around getting run over and shot.....

   ANIMALS: (REGISTERED)
      Sets whether or not the computer will produce herds of sheep and cows
      which wander around randomly and tend to set off mines.....

@ENDNODE

@NODE OptGfx "Graphics Options Menu"

   This menu allows some of the graphical display aspects of the game to
   be configured.

   MAP ALL/MAP OWN:
      Sets whether each player gets to see all the active tanks or only
      their own when viewing the full map.

   MOVES: SEE ALL/SEE OWN  (REGISTERED)
      Sets whether or not all movement is displayed on screen, or whether
      animal, civilian and enemy tank movement is not displayed.

   EXPLODE DELAY: (REGISTERED)
      Sets the delay in frames between successive explosions in a chain
      reaction being displayed.  A value of 0 will cause all explosions
      to be displayed simultaneously as one large explosion, while a value
      of 8 will cause each level of chain reaction explosions to be
      displayed entirely seperately.

   FIRES ON/OFF:  (REGISTERED)
      Sets whether or not explosions can cause fires.  If set to on then any
      feature destroyed by an explosion stands a chance of catching on fire.

   SMOKE ON/OFF:  (REGISTERED)
      Sets whether or not fires produce smoke.  Smoke has no effect on the
      mechanics of the game, but can add atmosphere to a battle.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Opt_Set "Miscellaneous Settings Menu"

   This menu is split inot two pages, containing miscellanous options for
   the game.

PAGE 1:

   DAMAGE 1+/0+: (REGISTERED)
      Sets the minimum damage caused by a single shot.  This may be 1,
      indicating that every hit causes at least one point of damage, or 0,
      indicating that successful hits may cause no damage if the attacker's
      strength is sufficiently low.  The default is 1+.

   FX ON/OFF:  (REGISTERED)
      Sets whether or not damage effects tanks abilities.  Currently, this
      setting has no effect on the game, but may do in future versions.

   ROUTING (AUTO/MANUAL):  (REGISTERED)
      Sets whether or not the computer attempts to find the best path round
      obstacles and across hazardous terrain, or whether the user must
      choose a path manually.  The default is automatic.

   NEXT:
      Switches to the second page of misc. settings.


PAGE 2:

   FIRE ARC (LIMITED/ANY): (REGISTERED)
      Determines whether or not the fire arc of aeroplanes is limited.
      If limited arc of fire is set the a plane may only fire at targets
      within 45 degrees of the direction in which it is pointing.  This
      option does not affect tanks, which are assumed to have 360 degree
      fire with their turrets.  The default is Any.

   SNAPFIRE ON/OFF: (REGISTERED)
      Sets whether or not tanks with movement points remaining at the end
      of their turn will go into an "overwatch" state.  If snapfire is on
      then tanks with movement points remaining will fire upon any enemy
      tank moving or firing within about ten squares of them, if a line
      of sight can be traced.  This may result in a tank catching itself in
      the burst effect of its own snapfire.  A snapfire shot is equivalent
      to a snap shot.  The default is snapfire off.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Opt_Map "Map Design Options Menu"

   This menu consists of a number of pages of options controlling the
   features generated on the game landscape.

PAGE 1:

   BARRELS:
      The barrels buttons allow barrels to be switched on or off, as in
      version 0.0.  In addition, registered users can set the number of
      barrels to be placed on the map.

   MINES:
      Mines may be turned on or off.  Registered users may also set the
      number of mines placed on the map, on a scale of 1 to 100.

PAGE 2:

   SAND:    (REGISTERED)
      Sand may be turned on or off, and the percentage coverage of the map
with sand may also be set.

   ROCKS:   (REGISTERED)
      Rocks may be turned on or off and the percentage map coverage of rocks
set.  Setting both sand and rocks to 100% will result in a rocky landscape,
since rocks take priority over sand.

PAGE 3:

   RIVERS:  (REGISTERED)
      Rivers may be turned on or off and the number of rivers generated may
      be set on a scale of 1 to 5.

   ROADS:   (REGISTERED)
      Two roads may be generated, which cross the map diagonally.  These
      roads may be tarmac or dirt tracks, or may be turned off entirely.

PAGE 4:

   TREES:   (REGISTERED)
      Trees may be turned on or off.  The percentage map coverage with trees
      may also be set.  High percentages tend to increase the time to
      generate a map exponentially.

   FIELDS:  (REGISTERED)
      Fields may be turned on or off, as well as the percentage map coverage
      of fields being set.  Fields will cover roads, but will be covered
      over by buildings.  Trees will also grow on fields.

PAGE 5:

   BUILDINGS:     (REGISTERED)
      Buildings may be turned on or off and the percentage coverage of
      buildings on the map set, allowing maps to vary from cities (75%+) to
      rural landscapes with scatterings of houses (10%-).

   BASES ON/OFF:  (REGISTERED)
      The bases that appear in the corners of the map may be turned on or
      off.  Bases serve no real purpose, except that they go boom
      satisfyingly if shot at enough.

PAGE 6:

   LAKES:
      Lakes may be turned on or off.  The number of lakes generated may be
      set, as may the size of the lakes.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Installation "Installation:"

   To install Warhost, copy the game file to the directory of your choice.
   Copy the contents of the Fonts subdirectory from this distribution into
your own system fonts: drawer.  You may need to run fixfonts to get the
system to register the new font.
   Warhost will run from any directory perfectly happily but will need to
store registration and game options files in the S: directory if the game
is registered.  You should therefore ensure that the S: directory is
available and not write-protected when saving the game options.

   Warhost has been tested on:

   A1200/030 @50MHz with 4Mb Fast RAM and 512Mb HD
   Standard A1200, no HD, no Fast RAM, no nothing.
   DosUAE020 Emulator with Sound enabled, 256 colours non-dithered,
      2Mb chip, no Fast RAM, under Win95, using a directory as hard
      the Amiga hard drive and with a Kickstart 3.0 ROM-file.

   (Note that anything lower than an A1200 will really crawl)

@NODE About "About Warhost"

Eldritch Info

   Eldritch was written in AMOS Basic Pro V2.00

   Graphics were designed in DPaint IV and the AMOS Sprite editor

   The sound effects are all ones I had lying around, so I hope no-one minds
me using them, I think they're all legit!

@ENDNODE

@NODE New_Features "Future Features:"

Features yet to be implemented:

  * In game music

  * Different difficulty levels

  * Better sound and graphics

  * Database of custom tanks and custom armies.

   I am now developing Warhost on my PC using the fantabulous UAE
Emulator!  Whether or not I choose to carry on doing so depends
upon whether anyone decides to register.  (Take the hint)

   Once you register, you will be able to obtain any future updates from the
Aminet and they will operate as registered versions.

@ENDNODE

@NODE History "Versions history"

This is Warhost V1.0
   It is the first registerable release of Warhost, adding a number of new
features for those who choose to.

Completed 1.10.96

New features/fixes:

   * Different landscape features for registered users.
      Registered users can now design their own landscapes by mixing the
      provided features.

   * Nicer interface.

   * Better screen font. (I think?)

   * Sounds when you click on buttons.

   * Aeroplanes are now implemented for registered users.

   * Animals are now implemented for registered users.

   * Fields, Buildings and Lakes are now available for registered users.

   * Registered users can save their preferred settings to disk.

   * Computer-operated tanks behave slightly more intelligently.  But _only_
      slightly!  They're still moronic.

   * Soldiers are now implemented for registered users.

History:

   Version 0.0:
      First release.  Cannot be registered.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Problems "Problems running Warhost"

If you experience any problems running Warhost, first try disabling things
such as screen blankers, which can often interfere badly with Amos programs.

If this still does not work, ensure that as few commodities and other
background utilities are running as possible.

If you STILL find problems then try disabling the CPU caches.  On 040 and
possibly 060 machines the caches are a MAJOR source of problems with
Warhost, due to a combination of poor coding (by Amos) and poor cache
implementation.  020 and 030 machines suffer less but may still cause
trouble on some accelerator boards.  On 030 systems, the Data Burst cache
should be set to off, which is the default.  If in doubt, type CPU at the
command prompt.

Finally, if you still can't get the thing to work, give me a call.  Maybe I
can help.
