This game was tested on:
-A1200, 50mhz, 6Mb, Kick3.0 and Kick 1.3(Relokick).
-A500, 1Mb, Kick 1.2.
 There were problems with the hiscorelist, but this computer is
 very old and damaged and many progs don`t work with it, so I don`t
 know if it`s my fault or not ...
-A500, 1Mb, Kick 1.3.
 No problems, but only a older version was tested.
-A2000, 1Mb, Kick 1.3.
 No problems, but only a older version was tested.



IMPORTANT: Please keep the disk unprotected!



The documentation is integrated in the game. Choose `Miscellaneous'
from the main menu and type in 'docs'.
To install the game on HD, type 'install'. I haven`t included any
dos-commands, so if you want to install/delete the game on/from HD,
you need to copy the copy/delete-command to the C-directory of this
disk or you can type in the directory where you have those commands
during installation (e.g. DH0:c/). You can also copy all files in
one directory to install it.
