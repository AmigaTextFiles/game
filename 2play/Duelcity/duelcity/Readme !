How to play : really easy !

On the menu screen, you can choose the number of men, the 2 players will
have at the begining of the duel (2, 4, 6, 8), the option  'Tournoi' 
means tournament and allows you to play up to 10 players fighting 2vs2.

During the game, just enter angle and strengh to hit your opponent. 
Usually angles range from 0 to 90, and strengh from 30 to 100. Of course
it can occur exceptional situations.
Be carefull with the wind, its power can range from 3 on the left to 3 
on right, and it may change during the duel. Likewise a bird may pick 
your boomerang during its flight.

When the boomerang has been thrown, you can go back to the menu screen 
by pressing ESC, you can change the music with keys (0-4) of the numeric 
keyboard. Control-C, at any time, to return to Workbench.

Duelcity should run under every config. You can choose the 68000 or 
68020 version, it's only an adjustment of the boomerang speed.

Now, that's all, enjoy Duelcity !!
