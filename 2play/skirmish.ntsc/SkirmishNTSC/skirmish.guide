  Skirmish requires: * Amiga (Most systems OK, see below)

                     * 4 joysticks and 4 player adapter for 8 player
                       simultaneous gaming

                     * Lots of friends

                     * An empty house for the evening

                     * Beer

  Skirmish has been tested on the following systems:

    Standard A1200
    Standard A1200 with hard drive (Runs OK from HD)
    A1200 + Apollo 1240/25, 8 meg, HD
    Standard A500 1MB (Although slows down with 6+ players)

  Er... we can't afford any more Amigas, so it would be greatly appreciated
if someone could send us any Amigas that you don't happen to want. An
A4000/060 would be nice.

  Failing that, contact us if Skirmish works or not on any system not listed
above. Thanks.

  Version 1.1 - Fixed bug where it ran too fast on faster processors.
                That's about all that's new on v1.1 actually.

  Skirmish can be loaded from hard drive or floppy.

  @{u}Hard Drive owners:@{uu}

    1. Simply copy the SkirmishNTSC drawer into the desired place.

    2. Place the contents of the FONTS directory into your SYS:Fonts
       if you do not already have the Mob font.

    2. Run Skirmish by double clicking on the game icon.

  @{u}Floppy owners:@{uu}

    1. Copy all the files and drawers into the root directory of the
       disk.

    2. Make a directory called "c" and copy the following files to it:
 
         Assign
         Setpatch

      (Find them on your Workbench disks)

    3. Make a directory called "libs" and copy the following files to it:

         Mathtrans.library
         Diskfont.library

      (This is not necessary on Workbench 3.0+)

    4. Open a shell and type c:install df0:

    5. The game will now self-boot when inserted at boot prompt.

  Skirmish is a clone of the simple yet brilliant game dogfight.

    The original allowed two players to battle it out: each
  player controlling their plane and shooting the other one down
  new incarnations of the game saw four players but this is the
  ultimate with EIGHT players being able to play at once.

   Our inspiration came specifically from the version of Dogfight
  by Dan Rhodes. It's on the Aminet and it's excellent, so get it.

 Skirmish is a damn fine game for up to 8 players. Skirmish is based on the
classic game Dogfight, which basically involves killing all the other
players to win. Hooray. What an interesting introduction.

  Why is Skirmish better than the rest?

    * EIGHT players can play simultaneously.
    * Computer can control any number of players.
    * Configurable options.
    * League table.
    * Looks nicer.

                              @{b}@{bg shine}How to Play@{ub}@{bg back}

  Once the league has been started, you will see all the planes lined
 up along the bottom. After a couple of seconds the game will start.
 Each player should press fire to take off. If fire is not pressed, your
 plane will blow up after some time if the limited launch time has been 
 set from the menu.

  Once in the air, kill all the other players. Haha, that simple. Left
 on the joystick rotates your plane anticlockwise, right rotates it
 clockwise and stab the fire button (ouch) to kick butt. If you don't know
 your keys, check the name screen menu. If you fly out of the side of the
 screen, you reappear on the other side. However, you can crash into the
 top of the screen.

  Your score is shown underneath your launch pad. The number of points
 gained by shooting down a plane is dependent on what has been set in the
 settings screen. So is the number of points you lose when you get shot.
 As is the number of points you need to gain to win the round. Next to your
 launchpad is your colourbox, so you can identify your score whilst flying.

  Once the round has been won, the winner will be announced and the league
 table is shown. The next round can now begin, and this continues until
 the league ends. (This depends on the number of games needed to win the
 league as set on the settings screen.)

 @{u}Tips@{uu}

 * Experiment with the settings screen, see what works best for you.
 * If someone's about to win the league, get your mates to kill `em.
 * If you die quickly, get to the top of the screen.
 * If you get bored of shooting at each other, try synchronised plane
                                                               formations.
 * Beer.

    Limited launch time?

    Points needed to win the round

    Number of games needed to win the league

  The first screen you will be presented with is this menu.

  At default, all the planes will be set to computer controlled,
 denoted by the orange C on the right hand side. This can be changed
 to player control by clicking on it. A tick means player control and
 a cross means the plane is absent all together.

  When a player is active and it says `Player 1' or whatever as the
 name on the left, this can be changed by clicking on it, and typing
 in the name on the keyboard.

  @{u}NOTE:@{uu} The controls can't be changed, so if you want to use the
        joyport, you must be the blue plane etc.

  From here, you may change the @{"settings" link "Settings Menu" 0}, start the league, or quit.

 Q: When I start the game, I'm not in control of any planes.
 A: Are all the planes set to computer? Change this in the @{"name menu" link "Name Screen Menu" 0}.

 Q: The game doesn't run.
 A: Have you tried the @{"loading procedures" link "Loading Skirmish" 0}? Otherwise contact us.

 Q: The game slows down when there are lots of players.
 A: Maybe it's time to upgrade.

 Q: The game's crap.
 A: Oh hello, you're one of those people. Don't worry, the Ultra 64
    will be out in a year or two, so you can spend 250 pounds on that
    and then 50 quid for each game. Those games will be better.

 Q: Where do I get a 4 player adapter from so I can get players 3
    and 4 working?
 A: Scour the Aminet. Try the TurboHockey archive on the Aminet.

 Q: I can't even get Skirmish to run from MS-DOS.
 A: You're obviously getting a poor reception. Turn your computer so it
    faces east and keep your computer away from any gas appliances.

 Q: The computer players keep shooting me down.
 A: You are crap.

 Q: My mates keep shooting me down.
 A: Hit them. Or pull out their joystick when they're not looking.
    Or steal their beer.

 @{u}BUGS@{uu}

 * For some reason, when the game is run from Workbench, icons left out
 sometimes have a habit of moving. This is Blitz's fault. Please don't
 leave anything valuable out. (See @{"Legal" link "Legal" 0})

 * It seems to go a bit jerky when there are only two planes on the
 screen. Shouldn't bother you cos the games crap with two players
 anyway.
