    Spod Blaster has been on my harddrive for along time, but I never got
round to finnishing it (and probably never will...) because I'm too busy
working on a Zelda/Secret of Mana likr RPG (If you are a good music 
composer and want to help then please contact me.), but I decided that I 
may as well release a version of it, so I quickly slapped up an options screen
and this is the result    :)

The game itself is simple enough to play, and it is almost the same as
Bomberman, only no CPUs (yet), no 1 player (yet), no level features (yet)
no t............... you get the idea.

Instructions are included in an introducion screen when you start the game.

PS. Although it's called SPOD Blaster, It doesn't feature the Spods (yet),
   because I couldn't draw them small enough :(


    If you like the game, or have found a huge bug (there's enough of them)
 then email me at andrewcrowe@enterprise.net 


Have Fun !
