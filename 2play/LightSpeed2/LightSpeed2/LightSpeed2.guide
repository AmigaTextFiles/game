@node "Introduction" "Introduction - `sounds like that bit in Tron'"

 In short, we're talking light cycles. You (playing as a "cycle") must
direct an ever lengthening line of light around the screen, trying not
to collide with the obstacles scattered in the play area, the trails of
the three other players' lines or the trail of your own line. The style
of play adopted can be defensive or offensive depending on preference.
It's a simple idea, but with two (or better, four) human players it can
get very addictive. See @{" Game Prefs " link "Game"} for details of advanced features.
To install the game anywhere at all, just drag its icon and play away!
@endnode
@node "Options Menu" "Options Menu - so many choices..."

 In the options menu are the following:

 @{"  ?# Player(s)  " link "Players"}
 @{"   Begin Game   " link "Begin"}
 @{" Player Control " link "Player"}
 @{" Colour Control " link "Colour"}
 @{"   Game Prefs   " link "Game"}

 Every gadget in the options windows has a hotkey, so making changes to
the options is easy even when a joystick is plugged into the mouse port
for playing purposes - just look for the underscores ("_" under chars).

 When @{b}Save@{ub} is chosen from any of the sub-windows, the current setup is
written to a file named `light.prefs' in the program directory. If @{b}Use@{ub}
is chosen instead, the changes made to the setup will be implemented,
but will not be written to the prefs file.
@endnode
@node "Players" "Selecting Players - grab three friends"

 This cycle gadget allows you to select how many human players are to
take part in a match (1-4) or alternatively to select an all computer
demo.
@endnode
@node "Begin" "Begin Game - Play! Play! Kill! Kill!"

 Click this to begin playing using the current setup. In-game, after
every match a score card will appear showing the current number of wins
gained by each player. Click @{b}Play@{ub} for another match or @{b}Quit@{ub} to return
to the options menu (Players' accumulated wins will be discarded).
Pressing the @{b}Help@{ub} Key during a match will pause the game. Pressing it
again will recommence play. Once in-game, @{b}Esc@{ub} will abort the match in
progress and bring back the score card.

@endnode
@node "Player" "Player Control - choose your weapons"

 The player control window allows you to change the method of control
for each player, as well as attach a name (max 7 chars) to each player.
Only a single player can use a particular control method at any time,
so if two control methods have been set as identical, the @{b}Save@{ub} and @{b}Use@{ub}
gadgets will be ghosted.

@endnode
@node "Colour" "Colour Control - cool colours, check 'em out"

 The colour of all four lines can be edited from this window. Pressing
on one of the numbered gadgets (1-4) will select which players' colour
is to be edited and the slider gadgets alter the red/green/blue values
of each colour.
@endnode
@node "Game" "Game Prefs - customize the playing experience"

 @{fg highlight}Dying Lines:@{fg text} When on, the trails of `dead' lines can be crossed. Good
for dancing on the graves of dead friends ;-)

 @{fg highlight}Swooshes:@{fg text} Toggles the in-game `swoosh' turning sound effects on/off.

 @{fg highlight}Obstacles:@{fg text} Toggles the `computer chips' on/off. When turned on, the
chips will appear in a number of set positions, but whether any single
chip appears or not is decided at random.

 @{fg highlight}Screen Wrap:@{fg text} When this option is on, players who leave the game arena
will reappear on the opposite side. When off, the line marking the edge
of the arena acts as a solid wall and cannot be passed.

 @{fg highlight}Spread Shields:@{fg text} This option toggles with acceleration, and it will
create a "T" line shield at 90° to the player's current direction, to
block or discourage another player from giving chase. Once a shield
has been created, another cannot be made for roughly one second after.
To toggle between spread shields, acceleration, and no special weapon,
use the `Special' cycle gadget.

 @{fg highlight}Acceleration:@{fg text} When this option is enabled, players can make their line
move in small bursts at twice the normal speed by pressing fire. Once a
line has accelerated, it cannot do so again for about one second after.
The `fire' keys for the keyboard are...
                                      @{b}Cursors: right shift
                                      Q-A-Z-X: space bar@{ub}

 @{fg highlight}CPU Turning:@{fg text} The logic used to control CPU players is coded to loop
around so many times before creating a random number. If this random
number is a certain value the CPU will turn left, if it is another
value the CPU will turn right, and if it is yet another value the CPU
won't turn at all. This slider controls how many times the code must
loop before the lines think about turning. The default value is 70:
setting it higher makes the lines turn less often and setting it lower
makes them turn more often.

@node "Requirements" "Requirements - don't ask us!"

 In theory:

 Kick 37+
 512k to run and 1Mb to run well
 AGA for the 24 bit palette

 In practice, we give no guarantees. There is no reason it shouldn't
work, but Amigas come in many flavours and we only have two of those
flavours to test on: A1200 '030 28Mhz 32Mb fast, Workbench 3.0
                     A1200 '030 40Mhz 16Mb fast, Workbench 3.0

 Notes: A few of MultiCX's features may really muck up LightSpeed's
pubscreen and generally cause a mess. One that especially needs to be
turned off is the HARDPATCH option for TagScreens. To allocate the
mouse port LightSpeed has to temporarily kill the input device, so a
program trying dumbly to use it might get a shock and flip out or lock
up the machine. Lastly, altering the screenmode that LightSpeed uses
with mode promotion tools is not a good idea, because the game must be
able to read coords from the screen to function properly, and relies
on that screen being 320 x 256.

@node "New" "New in 2 - bigger, better, brighter"

 15.01.99: This program is now FREEWARE;
 Groovy new in-game graphics;
 dying lines option added;
 crap long blocks option removed;
 many more obstacle position possibilities added - now 16 available;
 total possible number of chips on screen is now 16;
 less copy-cat CPU players - 4 independant @{"turn loops" link "Game" 29} added;
 additional sound added;
 logo screen removed - it was sooo boring;
 more efficient collision code;
 quicker appearing=less tedious score card;
 many little bugs squashed;

 05.02.99: player names bug fixed;
 spread shields added;
 small audio glitch fixed using a simple audio.device call;
 CPU players coded to use special weapons, though only at random.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 15.01.99: "This is almost certain (unless we did put any new bugs in)
to be the final release of LightSpeed..."

 05.02.99: I'll be damned if we didn't go and put a bug in after all!
The names of players would get mucked up if every name had been changed
from the defaults. After we fixed that, we put @{"spread shields" link "Game" 15} in,
fixed the audio glitch and made the CPU players a bit less predictable,
just so there would be no reasons to release any more updated "final"
versions and make ourselves look like amateurs. :-) Play, enjoy, email.
