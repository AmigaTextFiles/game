This is a small 3D dungeon game for two players, programmed with David Benn's
compiler "ACE".

The game consists of the following files:

  Hunt
  Hunt.info
  Hunt.doc
  levels (dir)
    Demolevel
  Source (dir)
    Hunt.b

Start the game via doubleclicking on its icon. If you want to start it from
CLI, set the Stack to 7000 and the current directory to the directory where
Hunt is installed before.

If the game is started under OS1.3, you need the arp.library for level selc-
tion.

Your mission
------------
In this game the two players are enemys and have to find and destroy each
other.

The Hunt.keys file
------------------
This file must contain the keys the players want to use for steering.
For example:

dvfasbjhlk

This means: Player one steers left with the d key, right with the v key,
forward with the f key; (s)he can shoots with the a key and lay mines with
the s key. Player two steers left with the b key, right with the j key
and so on.

The Dungeon
-----------
Some information which can make life easier in it:

 1. Walls are purple.
 2. Doors are brown.
 3. The players are green.
 4. Transporters, keys, energy points and (inactivated) mines you can only
    see if they are directly in front of you.
 5. Activated mines are invisible and cannot be deactivated.
 6. Keys look like §.
 7. Energy points look like $.
 8. Transporters look like T.



Editing the levels
-----------------------------------------------------
This is quite simple.
The first line of a hunt level file must be:

#HUNT LEVEL FILE

The next line conatains one number: The number of lines the level has.
For example:

8

Then the dungeon itself follows.
You may use the following symbols, meaning:

  1-9    transporters
   &     doors
   *     walls
   $     energy points
   §     keys
   %     mines (to collect)
   #     mines (activated)

There must be at least 3 Walls at the border of the dungeon.
As an example:

***********
***********
***********
***     ***
*** #   ***
***********
***********
***********

Then the coordinates, the mines, the keys, the energy points and the direction
the players shall have at the beginning follow (for both players).
Example:

4,4, 5, 0, 50, "E"
8,5, 5, 0, 50, "W"

Then there must follow 9 coordinates which represent the target coordinates
of the transporters, for example:

4,4, 5,5, 8,5, 7,5, 4,4, 4,4, 4,4, 4,4, 4,4

means: The transporters which are represented by a 1 on the map tranport
the players to 4,4; the transporter 2 transports the players to 5,5; the
transporter 3 to 8,5 and so on and so on.
All the text that follows then will be shown just before the level begins;
you can include a little story or something like that this way; for example:

This is a very small level.
I have just made it to demon-
strate how small levels may
be in Hunt.

That's all! Now play Hunt and try to make your own levels. Try to make a level
that looks like your house, your school or whatever, and play it with a friend
(or an enemy...)!

This game is Freeware and not Public Domain oder Shareware. Everyone may,
can and SHALL spread it, if all files are included unaltered.
If PD-Series want to take the game onto a disk, I would be pleased if they
did so and sent me a short message. Well - I said it's no Shareware. But I
wouldn't murder you if you sent me a letter or money or something else!!
