---------------------------------------------------------------------------------'FIGHT' ( I STILL HAVEN'T CHOOSEN THE REAL ONE YET )
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Version 0.4


    'FIGHT' IS A (GUESS?) FIGHTING GAME.IT IS FAST AND IT IS BASED ON MANY FIGHTING GAMES AROUND.
    THE GAME IS NOT FINISHED , SO I PACKED IT UP , MADE A FEW TWEAKS AND SENT IT TO THE NET FOR EVALUATION FROM 'FIGHTING GAME' FANS.
    WHEN I MADE THE GAME , I HAD ONLY MY COMPUTER IN MIND.I NEVER PLANNED TO UPLOAD THE GAME ANYWARE , IT WAS MADE JUST FOR THE FUN OF ME AND ALL MY FRIENDS.YA KNOW , EVERY TIME BEFORE WE GO PARTY WE PLAY BOUTS ON FIGHTING GAMES , SO I DECIDED TO MAKE MY OWN THE WAY I LIKE.



-REQUIREMENT



    A1200 (MAY RUN ON A500 W/ FAST MEMORY)
    HD
    TWO JOYSTICKS
        

    THIS WAY , THE GAME WILL RUN KIND A SLOW , FAST MEMORY MAKES A HUGE DIFERENCE.IT IS OK TO PLAY THE GAME ON A NOFAST MACHINE , SET THE SPEED TO 'NUTS'.IT IS EASY TO MAKE THE GAME EVEN FASTER ON SUCH MACHINE BUT THAT MEANS I HAVE TO MESS ON THE CODE AND I DON'T FEEL LIKE DOING IT NOW , SO , IF YOU'D LIKE THE GAME FASTER , E-MAIL ME.
    THE GAME IS MADE TO RUN FROM HD , IN CASE YOU DON'T HAVE ONE , IT IS EASY TO MAKE IT RUN FROM DISK IF YOU KNOW A BIT ABOUT THE AMIGA.IF YOU DON'T , E-MAIL ME AND I WILL TELL YA.
    MY CONFIGURATION IS:

    A4000 030       ->THE GAME WAS DEVELOPED FOR THIS SYSTEM , BUT MESS AROUND
    6 MG
    HD

    ALSO , THE GAME CAN ONLY BE PLAYED WITH TWO JOYSTICKS , THE KEYBOARD IS NOT USED ANYMORE(AS OPOSED TO OLDER VERSIONS).
    IT ALSO MAY RUN AO A500 , I NEVER TESTED , IF YOU HAVE ONE AND IT WORKS , GREAT , TELL ME.
    I HAVE KNOW IDEA HOW MUCH MEMORY IT TAKES , IT WORKED ON AN A1200 2 MG , BUT I'M NOT SURE IT WILL WORK ON AN A500 1 MG, PROBABLY NOT.



-HD INSTALATION



_UNPACK IT (LHA)

_COPY THE unpackade DRAWER TO IT'S DESTINATION ON YOUR HD

    'MUSIC' CHOOSE ON OR OFF  (I'M NOT THE COMPOSER OF THIS SONG , IT IS                               THERE JUST FOR TESTING MUSIC , SORRY AUTHOR)
    'SPEED' CHOOSE NORMAL IF YOU HAVE A COMPUTER LIKE MINE OR FAST FOR TURBO                            (NUTS IS UNPLAYABLE!).IF YOU HAVE A LOWER MACHINE ,                             CHOOSE NUTS.WHEN PLAYING 1PL , THE GAME WILL RUN FASTER THEN USUAL , DON'T ASK ME WHY.
    'SCENARIO'TO GO THROUGH THE 4 SCENARIOS AVAILABLE ,NOTE THAT EACH HAS ITS                           OWN MUSIC.

    NEXT SCREEN YOU CHOOSE THE FIGHTERS.I HAD NO TIME TO PUT THEIR NAMES ON THE GAME BUT I WILL TELL THEIR NAMES HERE TO MAKE THE TUTORIAL EASIER:

    PLAYER1   ->THE FIRST GUY , THE ONE WITH BLUE HAIR ON THE LEFT WINDOW.

    PLAYER2   ->THE SECOND ONE , THE ONE WITH LONG BLOND HAIR ON THE LEFT WINDOW.HE IS MY FRIEND FROM 224 WHO HELP ME WITH THE GAME.

    PLAYER3   ->THE THIRD ONE , THE ONE WITH A PONNY TAIL AND A SKIRT.
                   
   
    PRESS JOY BUTTON TO CHOOSE (HEAR THAT EXPLOSION NOISE).



-HOW TO PLAY



    YOU PLAY THE GAME WITH THE JOY AND ONE BUTTON(COULD NOT MAKE THE HERCULE EXTENSION WORK WITH MY JOYS) , I WANTED THE GAME TO HAVE 6 BUTTONS.

    IF YOU ARE PLAYER ONE (LEFT PLAYER) USE:
WHEN STANDING:
    RIGHT+DOWN - WEAK KICK
    RIGHT+DOWN+BUTTON - STRONG KICK
    RIGHT+BUTTON - WEAK PUNCH
    RIGHT+UP+BUTTON - STRONG PUNCH

WHEN DUCKING:
    RIGHT+DOWN - WEAK LOW KICK
    RIGHT+DOWN+BUTTON - STRONG LOW KICK
    LEFT+DOWN - WEAK LOW PUNCH
    DOWN+BUTTON - SMALL UPPERCUT(HITS THE ENEMY JUMPING)

WHEN JUMPING:
    RIGHT+DOWN - WEAK FLY KICK
    RIGHT+DOWN+BUTTON - STRONG FLY KICK
    LEFT+DOWN - WEAK FLY PUNCH
    LEFT+DOWN+BUTTOM - STRONG FLY PUNCH

OTHERS:
    LEFT+BUTTON - UPPER PROTECTION
    LEFT+ DOWN+BUTTON - LOWER PROTECTION

    BUTTON - INCREASE POWER UP
    UP+BUTTON - SPECIAL POSITION

    THERE ARE TWO BARS ON THE PANEL BELOW.THEY BOTH HAVE 100 POINTS (PTS)
    THE GREEN ONE IS THE ENERGY BAR , LOOSE IT ALL AND DIE.
    THE BLUE ONE IS THE POWER BAR , NEEDED FOR SPECIAL MOVES , JUST PRESS THE     POWER UP BUTTON TO INCREASE IT.


    THE GAME IS PLAYED THROUGH 3 ROUNDS , WHENEVER SOMEONE DIES , HIS ENERGY BAR WILL FILL UP FOR THE NEXT ROUND , THE WINNERS ENERGY REMAINS THE SAME , MUCH LIKE KING OF FIGHTERS.
    I HAVE ALSO MADE THE CHARACHTERS STRONGEST MOVE A DESPERATION MOVE (LIKE KING OF FIGHTERS AGAIN) IF YOU ENERGY BAR IS TOO LOW (RED) YOU CAN PERFORM THIS MOVE WITHOUT THE USUAL POWER NEEDED , NOTE THAT IT WILL MAKE THE POWER BAR ZERO.
    


-SPECIAL MOVES



    PLAYERS HAVE SIX SPECIAL MOVES (MORE SECRETS?) , THEY ARE 3 BODY MOVES PLUS 3 MAGIC MOVES.
    I'VE JUST CHANGED THE WAY OF PULLING OUT MOVES TO A BETTER ONE , I WAS GOING TO MAKE STREET FIGHTER A LIKE BUT CHANGED MY MIND.SO , TO CARRY OUT THE SPECIAL MOVES , YOU WILL NEED TO GET INTO THE SPECIAL POSITION FIRST , JUST PRESS FIRE+UP AND YOU ARE SET , NOTE THAT THAT MAKES YOU USELESS FOR A FEW SECONDS , IF YOU PULL OUT A MOVE WITHOUT THE NEEDED POWER , THE PLAYER WILL FAIL THE MOVE AND REMAIN RESTING FOR A FEW SECONDS.READ THE SPECIAL MOVES LIST TO KNOW WHAT TO DO WHEN ON SPECIAL POSITION.

    ALSO , TO CARRY THE SPECIAL MOVE YOU WILL NEED TO HAVE POWER , EVERY SPECIAL TAKES DIFERENT AMOUNT OF POWER , SO CHECK THE TABLE.
    THE NAME ON THE TABLE MEANS THE NAME OF THE MOVE
    THE POWER MEANS HOW MUCH POWER IS NEEDED TO MAKE THE MOVE
    THE DAMAGE MEANS HOW MUCH DAMAGE IT INFLICTS , IT CAN BE A FULL NUMBER OR A                NUMBER FOR EACH HIT , LIKE 10/2 MEANS 10 DAMAGE PTS, 2 HITS , IF                YOU MAKE THE 2 HITS THEN YOU GET DAMAGE 20.GOT IT?
    THE COMBO CAN BE YES OR NO , READ CHAPTER 'TIPS'
    THE TYPE CAN BE BODY OR MAGIC
    * MEANS IT IS THE DESESPERATION MOVE (DURING THE GAME YOU WILL RECOGNIZE IT                 BECAUSE OF THE FLASH BEFORE THE MOVE.(LIKE KING OF FIGHTERS OR                  STREET FIGHTER ALPHA)
    
(CONSIDER THIS TABLE FOR THE LEFT PLAYER)

-CODE



    THE GAME IS PRETTY MUCH OPEN , I DEVELOPED A CODE TO MAKE SPRITEBANKS OUT OF IFF PICTURES , IF YOU OPEN THE PLAYERS PICTURES , YOU WILL SEE THAT ALL THE FRAMES ARE THERE.YOU CAN REDRAW THE CHARACHTERS TO SUIT YOURSELF BUT YOU WILL NEED TO USE THE SAME COLORS AS THEY ARE CODE CREATED AND ARE ONLY PRESENT ON THE IFFS FOR YOU TO KNOW.MESSING WITH THE FIRE FROM SPECIAL MOVES WILL TOTALY CHANGE THE GAME!
    THE PLAYERS WERE MADE BASED ON YIER KUNG FU GAME STYLE , I HAVE ANIMATIONS WITH ALL THE PLAYER , SPECIAL MOVES AND EVEN THE BASE PLAYER THAT WILL HELP YOU TO CREATE YOUR OWN DRAWINGS.EMAIL ME IF IT IS OF YOUR INTERESS.THE ANIMATION HELPS YOU TO KNOW THE EASY FROM FRAME TO FRAME , WHICH IS ONLY VISIBLE ON THE CODE.
    YOU MAY CHANGE THE BACKGROUND TOO AS LONG AS YOU USE ONLY THE LAST 16 COLORS AND USE THE SAME GROUND LEVEL.
    AFTER YOU MADE THE CHANGES JUST SAVE WITH THE SAME NAME.BACKUP THE GAME BEFORE.
    IF YOU HAVE DONE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS GOOD , EMAIL ME.



-TIPS     (FOR PLAYING THE GAME AT THE LIMITS!!!)



    HERE I WILL TELL YOU ALL THE COMBOS AND STUFF YOU CAN MAKE TO DESTROY YOUR FRIEND:

    -DON'T STAND OVER THE FALLEN PLAYER AS HE CAN STAND UP MAKING A DEVASTATING SPECIAL MOVE JUST BY HOLDING THE SECOND PART OF ANY MOVE.
    
    -IF SOMEBODY IS OVER YOU WHILE ON THE FLOOR , HOLD UP+FRONT+STRONGPUNCH AND AS YOU STAND UP , YOU WILL AUTOMATICALLY UPPERCUT.

    -ERICO CAN DO A GREAT COMBO BY MAKING THE DRAGON KICK , THEN MAKE TWO DUCK WEAK PUNCHS AND DO THE UPPERCUT WHILE THE SECOND DUCK PUNCH IS MADE.IF YOU ARE FAST ENOUGH , AS SOON AS YOU HIT THE GROUND , POWER UP JUST A LITTLE AND MAKE A FIREBALL TO HIT THE OTHER PLAYER FALLING.THAT IS 50PTS DAMAGE (HALF THE BAR!!)

    -ALL THE SPECIAL MOVES WITH COMBO YES , MEANS YOU CAN USE THAT TO HIT THE OTHER WHILE FALLING , LIKE YOU CAN FLYKICK SOMEBODY AND WHILE HE IS FLYING , THROW A FIRE BALL AND IT WILL HIT , IF FAST ENOUGH , YOU CAN HIT HIM WITH AS MANY FIREBALLS AS YOUR ENERGY ALLOWS!

    -THE WEAK UPPERCUT (DOWN+STRONG PUNCH) IS THE ONLY STANDING NORMAL MOVE THAT CAN HIT A FLYING ATTACK. TIME IT.

    -THE WEAK FLYING PUNCH HAS PRIORITIES OVER ALL THE OTHER FLYING MOVES.

    -GRABBING CAN ONLY BE DONE IF YOU ARE TOUCHING THE OTHER PLAYER AND HE IS DOING NOTHING OR PROTECTING.OLD ERICO'S GRAB-ANYTIME MOVE CAN GRAB THE OPPONENT AT ANY SITUATION , FOR EXAMPLE , YOU CAN GRAB HIM IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS STRONG PUNCH.

    -AFTER ANY STRONG MOVE THAT ARE NOT SUCESSFUL , DO A WEAK UPPERCUT.IT IS MOUST POSSIBLE TO HIT THE UNEXPIRIENCED OPPONENT.

    -YOU CAN COUNTER ATTACK ANY STRONG MOVE AS THEY ARE SLOW , BUT TO COUNTER ATTACK THE WEAK UPPERCUT TAKES EXPERIENCE.TRAINE IT.

    -PLAYER 2 LIGHT BOLT IS THE FASTEST BOLT ON THE GAME , COMBO IT LIKE HELL.

    -PLAYER 3 KIOFIRE IS NOT AS FAST BUT IT CRAWLS THE GROUND , COMBO IT LIKE HELL TO , AS IT MAKES IT EASY TO HIT THE ENEMY FALLING!!

    -YOU CAN DISMOUNT PLAYER 1 DRAGON MAYHEN BY JUMPING EXACTILY TO FALL OVER HIS HEAD AND WEAK FLYING PUNCHING.DON'T WORRY IF HE IS UNDER THE FIRE , THE COLLISION DETECTION IS ACCURATE!IF YOU ARE PLAYING PLAYER 1 , DO THE MOVE JUST FAR AWAY ENOUGH FOR THAT NO TO HAPPEN.

    -DO NOT PROTECT THE DRAGON MAYHEM!!!!!! AS EVER SPECIAL MOVE PROTECT TAKES 1 DAMAGE POINT.YOU MAY END UP WITH A BIGGER DAMAGE THAN IF IT HITTED YOU!!TO RECIEVE LESS DAMAGE , JUMP TO THE MIDDLE OF THE FLAME JUST BEFORE IT HITS YOU AND PRAY!

    - IF THE OPPONENT DOSEN'T WANT TO GIVE YOU SPACE TO DO THE DRAGON MAYHEN (LIKE ALWAYS STAND WHERE HE CAN FLY PUNCH YOU) JUMP OVER HIM AND DO THE SPECIAL MOVE  WITH YOUR BACK FACING THE OPPONENT.AS THE FLAMES ALWAYS CAME FROM BEHIND YOU , HE WILL BE COUGHT ON SURPRISE BY THE DRAGON.THIS IS THE FUNNIEST THING TO DO BUT VERY HARD.

    -IF THE OPPONENT STAND TOO AWAY FROM YOU WHEN YOU ARE ON THE FLOOR(YE LIKE HE IS SCARED THAT YOU MAY STAND UP UPPERCUTING) , STAND UP DOING THE DRAGON MAYHEN.HE WILL BE COUGHT ON SURPRISE.

    - ALWAYS HAVE YOUR POWER BAR ON TOP!

    - IF YOU PLAY PLAYER 2 AND YOU ARE DOING THE KICK SHIT MOVE , WHEN THE OPPONENT START STANDING UP , NEVER JUMP BACKWARDS , JUMP FORWARD AS IF HE STANDS UP UPPERCUTTING , IT WON'T GET YOU.

    -IF YOU PLAY PLAYER 2 , KEEP IN MIND THAT HE CAN NOT KILL THE OPPONENT BY KICKING HIM ON THE FLOOR(KICK SHIT).IF THE OPPONENT HAS 5 OR LESS ENERGY , DON'T TAKE YOUR TIME GOING TO KICK HIM.

    -ALWAYS TIME OLD ERICO'S KIO MAYHEM FIRE FOR JUST WHEN YOU SEE THE OPPONENT JUMP ATTACKING YOU.CAN'T SCAPE WHEN FALLING ON FLAMES!

    -WEAK MOVES TAKE 5 DAMAGE WHILE STRONG ONES TAKE 10.EXCEPT FOR THE WEAK UPPERCUT THAT TAKES 15 AND THE STRONG FLYING MOVES THAT TAKES 15 TOO.LEARN TO MAKE STRONG FLYING MOVES BECAUSE ONLY ONE FRAME OF THE MOVE MAKES THE HIT.

    -IF PLAYING ERICO AND YOU FALL , STAND UP DOING THE DRAGON KICK , IT IS FAST ENOUGH FOR THE OPPONENT NOT REALIZE IT , THEN DO THAT COMBO I TOLD YOU BEFORE!IF PLAYING AGAINST , ALWAYS HIT PROTECTION WHEN ERICO STAND UP.YA KNOW IT IS FUN TO SEE THAT DRAGON KICK FAILING.

    -IF YOU ARE TOO LOW ON ENERGY , LIKE 2 OR 3 PTS , KEEP POWERING UP AND JUMPING , DO NOT PROTECT SPECIAL MOVES!

    -WHEN PLAYING OLD ERICO , MAKE THE OPPONENT STAND UP ON THE ROUND HOUSE FIRE , THIS IS UNBEATABLE AND IT WILL FORCE THE OTHER PLAYER TO STAND UP PROTECTING.

    -IF PLAYING ERICO AND YOU MANAGE TO PUT THE OPPONENT ON THE CORNER , FLY ATTACK HIM WITH A WEAK PUNCH(OR ANY OTHER)  AND THEN UPPERCUT HIM TWICE , YOU MAY NEED TO POWER UP JUST A LITTLE BETWEEN UPPERCUTS BUT DON'T WORRY , IT TAKES LONG ENOUGH FOR THE OTHER PLAYER TO FALL.

    -DO THE SAME ABOVE WITH SERGIO AS HIS UPPERCUT(PEGA TATU) IS MORE DEVASTATING AND WATCH THE OTHER PLAYER GOING OFF THE SCREEN!ALSO , THE LIGHT PUNCH CAN CRACK A ROCK WHEN MADE ON THE CORNER OF THE SCREEN!

    -OVERUSE SERGIO'S UPPERCUT(PEGATATU) AS IT KICKS ASS AND IS A BEUTIFULL MOVE!

    -IF PLAYING SERGIO AND YOU SEE YOURSELF LOW ON ENERGY , TRY THE LEE PALM PUNCH , AS THAT IS THE SECOND MOUST STRONGEST MOVE(RUGOL HAS THE STRONGEST AND IT IS DONE THE SAME WAY).

    -COMBOS ON THE CORNER ARE INCREDIBLY SUCESSFUL , OLD ERICO CAN FLY STRONG KICK , DO A ROUND HOUSE FIRE AND WASTE THE OTHER POWER ON KIO FIRES.THE ENEMY WON'T HIT THE FLOOR FOR A MINUTE OR TWO!

    -IF YOU FIND A GOOD COMBO , TELL ME!!IT IS HARD TO KNOW ALL THE POSSIBILITIES EVEN WHEN YOU ARE THE ONE WHO MADE THE GAME.(LIKE THE INVENTOR OF CHESS WILL NEVER EVER KNOW ALL THE POSSIBILITIES FOR ALL THE DEVASTATING FORMATIONS!JUST NOT HUMAN)

    -IF YOU CAN'T MANAGE TO MAKE ANY COMBOS OR EVEN THE SPECIAL MOVES , TRAINE THEM ON THE 'SLOW' SPEED.
