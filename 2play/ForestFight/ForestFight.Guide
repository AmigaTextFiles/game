                -----------------------------------------



  You don't need any PeeCee, any Mac, only an AMIGA with a minimun of 1 meg
of CHIP. 
Forest Fight runs on OS 1.3, 2.04, 3.0 and should run on other one. 
Be sure that your AMIGA is built around a 680X0 processor and that will be
OK ;-)

Note that is better when you dispose of 2 or more meg of memory because you
can configure Forest Fight to load all files into memory before playing to 
avoid disc access, see @{" Tool Type and Command Line " LINK "gtt"} for more details ...

Rem : Mathtrans.library is needed in your libs: path.
---
      For OS 1.3, the file Ram-Handler is needed in your l: path if you use
      the tool type RAM=YES.

                ----------  TOOL TYPE & CLI   -----------
                -----------------------------------------


1) RUNNING FORESTFIGHT FROM WORKBENCH
  You have to double click on the icon named 'ForestFight'.
The executable program MUST HAVE the name 'ForestFight' or the icon will
not be recognized for the tools.
This icon has 2 tool types :
         -SPEED=positiv real number like 1.8 for example
            For a 68020 SPEED=2 is a good choice,
            For a 68000 SPEED=3.2 is quite good,
            For faster Amigas, try a little lower than 2 until your boom-
            rang has a reasonnable speed when flying.

         -RAM=(YES|NO)
            Put YES if you've got 2 meg RAM or more. In this case, all 
            files will be loaded into memory so there won't be disc 
            access during the game. When Quitting ForestFight, these files
            will be removed from memory by the programm, don't care !
            Put NO if you've got less than 2 meg RAM.

2) RUNNING FORESTFIGHT FROM CLI
  Open a Shell Window and go in the ForestFight directory with CD command.
Then type : forestfight [SPEED=(real number)] [RAM=YES|NO]
The optionnal parameters SPEED and RAM are fully discribed above.

Default values are SPEED=2 and RAM=NO.

                -----------------------------------------


1)Introduction
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
  ForestFight is a balistic type game playable only with 2 humans. The aim
of this game is to kill the opponent with a boomrang shoot !
  But you'll be surprised by the action of many details during the game 
like Wind, Birds, Sun and some extrabonus available on the top of the trees.

2)The menu screen
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Before beginning the duel, you can configure several options on the menu
screen.
  'Nombre de vies' is the number of lives each player has at the beginning
of the game.
  'Bonus' is On or No to set/unset the possibilitie to have bonus at the 
beginning of the fight.
  'Vent' is On or No to activate/desactivate wind inclemency.
  'Soleil' is On or No to allow/forbid the sun to eat your boomrang.
  'Oiseau' is On or No to activate/disactivate the thief bird.

  The ESC key sends you back to workbench !

Ok, your game is as you want ?, now it's time to click on 'Jouer' to play.

3)During the game
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  A random forest is created for the duel. First you begin by choosing 
where to put your man. You've got 5 possibilities (5 arrows).
When the 2 players are placed the battle can start. If the bonus option is
ON then some bonus will fall on the top of trees.

Now the first player is asked for two parameters in the requester screen
at the bottom.
  'Angle' is the angle of your shoot in degrees,
  'Force' is the strenght of your shoot (useally beetween 50-200),
      note that for angle<20 the strenght is limited to 50.
  Confirm your values on the 'OK' question.
Some informations are displayed on the requester screen :
 - the remaining lives of each player.
 - the 'vent' indication show the wind direction and its strenght (<3).
 - SPACE BAR allow you to see the full battle screen to have a better
   apprehention of the values to input. SPACE BAR again to come back.
 - HELP key describes the four possible bonus.

The ESC key sends you back to menu screen !
The "M" key changes the background rythm !

When the opponent has no more lives you WIN !!!

4)Bonus desciption
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Five types of bonus are available :
  1. HIDE TWICE : when you hit this one, your man will disappear on the 
                  next two shoots of your opponents, very usefull !!
  2. DOUBLE SHOOT : you can now fire twice.
  3. RC-BALL : is a Radio Controlled Boomrang, available only one time,
               control it with the MOUSE, fun, fun !! 
               You've got only 6 seconds to touch the opponent !
               RCball is unaffected by wind, sun, birds.
  4. FIREBALL : is a fire ball which can fly through the trees, the best !
                Fireball is unaffected by sun, birds.

 My name is Sylvain ZANGIACOMI and I love developping under AMOS PRO.
To have fun with AMOS, you don't need a powerfull AMIGA, I've just a A500+
but it's still alive.

 Well this game --ForestFight-- has been created in september 1997 on my
configuration : A500+ with 9 Meg, a MTEC 68020/68881 and an IDE HD540.
 
 I thanks my friend CHAFIK for the 'End Screen', drawing is very difficult
for me.

 May be, you like balistic games very much, so try my first one : DUELCITY
available on Aminet, or write me to have source (try to improve !).
