- Protracker modules only
- No tempo commands (F20-FFF) allowed
- First two tracks are played, the last two are ignored
- Size should be under 120 kilobytes
- Use naming "<filename><volume>.mod", where <volume> is the master volume
  represented using two digits, range 00..64.
- As many mods are loaded as fit into memory.
- Modules are played in random order.
- These files can be compressed with "fimp", this though leads to a 
  noticeable decompresion delay on slower amigas.
