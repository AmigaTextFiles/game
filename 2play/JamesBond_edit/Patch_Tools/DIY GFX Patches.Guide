@NODE "what" "What you will need"

1.     To create your own gfx sets, you will need:

        1. A copy of JamesBond V0.9

        2. A GFX program such as PPaint/DPaint

        3. A Sampling program such as Technosound.

        4. An Idea for a new GFX set


     Having a copy of one such GFX patch will also help
     you get started.


     JamesBond V0.9 and GFX patches are avalible from
     my website, Http://members.tripod.com/~mantasoft

@ENDNODE



@NODE "first" "The first steps..."

2.     The first steps

      The first thing you should do before you start
      editing the gfx is to create a drawer in the
      JamesBond drawer named after your patch.

      Then in that create the drawer 'Chr' and 'Int'


      After that, create a script that reads:

        CD /
        JamesBond @{i}TheNameOfYourDrawer@{ui}

      and save this in your patch's drawer, making sure
      you set the default tool to 'IconX'

      PS. Please do not put any quote marks arond the
      @{i}TheNameOfYourDrawer@{ui} argument.

   
    An example of this is my AustinPowers addon. All the
    patched files are in a drawer called 'AustinPowers'
    so I created a scipt that reads:

        CD /
        JamesBond AustinPowers

    And don't forget to change its icon to a 'project' and
    change the default tool to 'IconX'


      @{" <-- " LINK "main"} Back to main menu                    Go to next step @{" --> " LINK "opt"}

@ENDNODE


@NODE "opt" "Creating a new options screen"

3.     Creating a new options screen


      The first thing you will want to do is to change
      the characters icons in the options.

      First load up the example files in the
      'Options Screen' drawer

      Then you can load in new characters that you have
      drawn, Videograbbed or Downloaded and remap them
      to the palette (if you like you can change the
      palette colours 16-30)

      You may also change any of the other option screen
      icons and the main screen if you like.

      After you have finnished them, save them into
      your patches drawer



        Changing the characters names

      To change the characters names, simply load up
      the text file 'names' into a text editor, then
      save it back into your patch's drawer.

      Please make sure you save it as CR+LF as otherwise
      the game will not accept it (or if there are stange
      symbols at the end of the lines, please leave them
      there)



      @{" <-- " LINK "main"} Back to main menu                    Go to next step @{" --> " LINK "chr"}

@ENDNODE

@NODE "chr" "Changing the character GFX files"

4.     Changing the character GFX files

      To change a characters GFX file, first load up
      the example files in the 'Character Templates'
      drawer.

      You can then change them and save them in the
      'Chr' drawer in your patch drawer.

      The file names are important though:

        @{FG shine}#@{FG text} - The characters number (1 - 6)

        @{FG shine}@@{FG text} - The weapon number (0 - 4)

        c@{FG shine}#@{FG text}d0    - These are the players death sequence
        c@{FG shine}#@{FG text}d1    /


        c@{FG shine}#@{FG text}w@{FG shine}@@{FG text}    - These are the players ingame gfx files,

                  it is important that after you have
                  saved them in your patch drawer that
                  you load them up into 'MakeChr'
                  before you can use them in JamesBond.


        You may change any one of the game's characters,
        or all of them, or even just part of them, say
        just their death sequence.
      

        Also, please remember that you can't change the palette
        of the characters I'm afriad.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "lev" "Changing the Levels"
              
5.     Changing the Levels


            To create new levels, first you must make some
        new blocks for them. If you load up the picture
        'Example Levels/BlockFormat' then that explains
        how the blocks are layed out.

        Once you have created some blocks in your patch's
        drawer (ranging from 'blk1' onwads) then you
        should copy the file 'Example Levels/GameIcons'
        to your drawer as well. You may edit these if you
        like

        Now you should load up the level editing program.

        This will let you create levels for your block set,
        and give them there own caption etc.


            (More help on the level editor can be found in
        its own readme)



      @{" <-- " LINK "main"} Back to main menu                    Go to next step @{" --> " LINK "othr"}

@ENDNODE

@NODE "othr" "Changing the other GFX files"

6.     Changing the other GFX files


            Finally, there are a few other gfx
        files that you can change:


        "Hit" - This is the red border that is displayed
                when a player is hit.

        "Misc" - This is the games minor gfx, such as the
                explosion, the grenades, the bullet hits
                and the blood marks.

        "Rocket" - This the the missile used ingame. You may
                change it to whatever you like.

                (You may use 'MakeChr' to rotate the new
                missile's image for you)


         Again, you have to keep the palette the same.

@ENDNODE




@NODE "snd" "Changing the sound files"

7.     Changing the Sound Files

      As the sound files are not encrypted, you can
      base you new set on the original filse.


      All the sounds are played at 13964Hz, except the
      intro's music which is 11025Hz.

        You should record the samples at this rate, or they
        will sound too fast/slow ingame


      As with the character files, the file names are important:

@{FG fill}          (In patch's drawer)
@{FG text}
        Tune.sam  - This is the sample that plays in the Bond
                     'Looking down the gun barrel' bit.

        Tune2.sam - This is large title tune. It is the only sample
                     that is played in 11025Hz (to save disk space)


@{FG fill}          (In the 'Chr' drawer of the patch's drawer)
@{FG text}

                  @{FG shine}#@{FG text} - The characters number (1 - 6)

        c@{FG shine}#@{FG text}s  - This is the characters introduction speech that they
                                    make when selected on the options screen

        c@{FG shine}#@{FG text}s.int1 \  These are the characters introduction when they
        c@{FG shine}#@{FG text}s.int2  }  appear in the game area. The number ranges from 1-3,
        c@{FG shine}#@{FG text}s.int3 /   and you don't need to have 3. (if there are none, then
                                          the game uses the original sfx instead)

        c@{FG shine}#@{FG text}s.kil1 \  These are the characters gloating when they kill
        c@{FG shine}#@{FG text}s.kil2  }  someone. The same filename rules apply.
        c@{FG shine}#@{FG text}s.kil3 /

            Note:

        If the character is a girl, please create a file with the name 'c@{FG shine}#@{FG text}g'
        This is so that the game can adjust some of the frequencies slightly.

            Also:

        You can change the game's SFX files '200' to '211' by
        saving new versions into your patch's drawer

@ENDNODE

@NODE "tit" "Changing the title and adding copyrights"

8.     Changing the title and adding copyrights


      The title is saved as 'Int/Die3' (don't ask why ;)

      To change it simply save a 640x256 8 colour picture
      there


        To add a copyright note, simply write out a small
      note, like the patches name, your name and your
      email address and save it as 'author.txt' in the
      patch's drawer.
 

      @{" <-- " LINK "main"} Back to main menu                    Go to next step @{" --> " LINK "pub"}

@ENDNODE


@NODE "pub" "Getting it published"

9.     Getting your gfx set published


      If you want to publish your sets, the you can release
      it anywhere you like (as long as you don't include any
      of the original game files)

      I recomend you email it to me though, as I will not only
      place it on my webpage, I will release it onto Aminet
      for you as well.



      PS. If you really want to put it on aminet yourself, I
      suggest you call the archive 007-@{i}nameofyourpatch@{ui}.lha
      and have it in 'Game/Data'.

      And make sure you say that you need JamesBond V0.9 in the readme

@NODE "tech" "Technical Detais"

        Technical Details of how the patch system works.


    To make James Bond work with extra GFX sets, while being
    able to retain and use the original GFX sets, the game
    first reads the CLI argument.

    If there is the name of a drawer as the CLI argument,
    then it will always check for the game files in this
    drawer, then default back to the original if it is not
    found. This means that you do not have to change all
    of the files to create a patch.

    In this way, any game file can be changed as an add-on
    patch (including levels) and with this release I have
    included a level editor and the additional gfx sets
    that can be changed.
