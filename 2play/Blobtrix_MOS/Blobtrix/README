1. What is it?

Blobtrix is a Tetris-like two player "action" game with some differences 
- one player plays upper side, the other lower side.

The blocks won't drop alone by themselves - you can select the block you 
want, rotate it and move it to the correct location and then finally 
launch it, after which you cannot control it anymore.

When blocks collide they "fossilize". If you put the last block on 
a line you'll "get" it. In normal mode the line will just disappear but 
in lightning mode all the blocks will move towards the enemy - in addition.

2. Why is it?

Blobtrix was made by Blobtrox originally for a block game development
competition organized by Suomipelit.com and Ohjelmointiputka in the
late 2003-early 2004

3. "Installing"

If you downloaded the Win32-package you should have got the binaries with you.

On *nix etc. you should be able to compile it by just editing Makefile if 
necessary and then typing "make"
If you encounter problems make sure that you have correctly installed the 
newest versions of
- SDL (http://libsdl.org)
- SDL_net (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net)
- SDL_image (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image)
- SDL_mixer (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer)
- libvorbis (http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/)

In case you want no sound support, add this line to src/config.h: 
#define NOSOUND

6. What can I run it with?

You should be able to run the game on all the most common operating 
systems you can get all the needed SDL packages for. Our beta testers have 
reported it to work at least on Win32, Linux, PPC970 (G5), UltraSparcII.
It should be very portable. :)

7. License / Copying

In case you happen to sell the game, you must sell it without the wav-files in data/-directory. ^^
Some stuff there aren't under GPL but under some "free, but only for personal use" license.

For everything but not those wav-files, see the file "COPYING"
