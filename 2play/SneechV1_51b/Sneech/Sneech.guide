This is the Full Sneech Game and can * NOT * be spread my any means without
written consent from the author! 

Leave this disk Un-Protected as the Hi-Score table will be updated and save
to disk each time you play. Because of this you should Make a Backup copy and
keep it safe. A new copy can be obtained by sending a disk & Stamp to me.

If you did not receive this game from ME 'Paul Burkey' personally, you should
NOT be using it! If you have not paid the £5 registration fee for it then
why not send it along today! This game is my pride and joy! and because of
this I am constantly updating it so if you do register you will get the latest
versions and also receive updates whenever any major changes are made.

I can't afford to spend time updating this game when I could be working on some
new games. If the cheques continue to come in for this game then I will 
continue to update it.

If you don't think it's worth updating because you think there wont be any
decent changes made to the game to be worthwhile then your wrong! I have some
major plans for updates including a much bigger shop selection. Handicaps for
players that are learning and full end of game statistics with bonuses. Many
more free objects and much more.

So if you are registered then get your order in for the next version by sending
3 stamps or a stamp & Disk. If you are not a registered user then send you £5
today and tell me where you got hold of this game! If you see this game
advertised with (Full Version etc) then tell me about it. The more I get ripped
off the less money I have to develop the game so please help. I must first tell
you about the PD version that is to be released. It will be a full game with
some features taken out. Hopefully this will encourage more registers so that
I can put a lot of extra work into the game!

Thank You.

I have been programming the Amiga since 1991. Most of the time was spent
writing Educational Games and not making a penny from it. Also writing
games that don't get finished is another of my hobbies. I took a break from
the Amiga for 18 months in 1993 to learn Structured Programming and the
languages COBOL and 'C'.

I'm now back with the Amiga so look out for some of my future projects.

As well as a Printer, Hand Held Scanner, Sampler etc. I use :-

A500   WB1.3              512k Chip  512k Fast Mem
A1200  WB3.0  340Meg HD   2Meg Chip  4Meg Fast Mem + USR 28.800 Fax/Modem

@NODE "INTRO" "Introduction"

@{b}Introduction@{ub}
-=-=-=-=-=-=
Sneech is a fast paced 'Worm Game' game for up to 10 players at a time. You
can play against 9 computer players depending on how many human players there
are and is as far as I know the first game ever to allow all 10 players to
play simultaneously on screen. This is why the game is so much fun to play.

The game has been played and tested for since Nov-94 and in this time many
changes and additions have been made. So the game has adapted to suit the
needs of many people.

When you first play Sneech it might seem at first to be just another Worm
game. You might find it too difficult or fiddly to play. Please!!!? Stick at
it and you will soon get the hang of it. The game was really designed to be
used by 2 or more human players but it can be played by 1.

But for best results play in a darkened room with the sound turned up to full
and just sprinkle 6 humans and add 2-4 more computer players for taste! Also
the later in the day the better! Office hours will do but I recommend you use
up as much bed time as you can!

Before I continue, there are some known bugs Sometimes you will find the odd
block or piece of 'worm' left on the screen. It all adds to the random element
that makes every Match different. If anything really gets up your watsit then
write to me and I will do something about it. Each time I update the game it
becomes more bug free so make sure you update!

   Mr.Black   Loves Bombs and deflectors so beware.
   Mr.Blonde  All round cheeky git.

The star ratings can be seen by using the Colour Menu Buttons.

@EndNode


@NODE "GAME" "The Game Itself"

@{b}The Game!@{ub}
-=-=-=-=-
The game itself lasts for 4 or more minutes. 
After a small countdown the game will start!

The game is split into 3 time periods these are :-

    Green        Start off Period     (Get going!)
    Blue         Game Time            (Best Points Time Zone)
    Red          Extra Time           (No pills! Exit open!)

The object of the game is to gain more points than everyone else. And at the
same time collect as many @{"Money" Link "SHOP"} tokens as possible.

You have until the end of the Green period to start moving in any direction
you want. After this you will automatically move in a random direction. The
Game continues until all the players are dead or the time is up.

There are a variety of different @{"Game Extras" Link "GAMEEXTRAS"} to help you 
out with each game.

You gain points by killing people. If you do kill someone you will get their
kill bonus as displayed at the start of the game. To kill someone you will
have to force them to crash into you. When this is done they will shrink a
little and you will grow a little. If they shrink below 2 pieces then they
are killed.

After the normal time has run out and you go into the extra time, A door will
appear. You will have to exit by moving into the door! You don't have to go
straight in but you will receive 100 points for ending your go this way.
If you don't make it into the door and the extra time runs out then you will
simply shrink to death! and loose out on your 100 finish bonus.

@EndNode

@Node "GAMEEXTRAS" "Extra Game Elements"

Durring a game you will come accross various game objects. Some are Arena
objects and some are Collectable objects.


@{b}Arena Objects
-=-=-=-=-=-=-@{ub}

@{b}Blocks (Striped or Metalic)@{ub} 
Various shaped blocks appear at random. You should always avoid them.


@{b}Slip Mats (Light coloured Squares)@{ub}
These allow you to move at a higher pace.


@{b}Slow Down Mats (Dark Coloured Squares)@{ub}
These make you move at a slower pace.


@{i}Note. Don't get confused between Slow/Slip mats and the Chequered floor.@{ui} 


@{b}Holes (Easily noticable!)@{ub}
Avoid at all times. Any contact with the holes will reduce your size much
faster than any other objects.


@{b}Ramps And Bumps@{ub}
You might come accross sections of the floor that are raised. As you would
expect traveling accross these will alter your speed. I've added an extra
element to a players movement, that of 'momentum' when you move up a hill you
will of course slow down if you then move on level ground the slow down will
eventually cancel out. When you travel down a hill you will gain momentum and
travel at a faster pace. Again, this will cancel out when you travel on level
ground.


@{b}Ice!@{ub}
These dont appear very often but when they do you should avoid them. When
you cross a patch of Ice you will loose your ability to turn! It can be done
but it's not reliable!

 

@{b}Collectable Objects
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-@{ub}

@{b}Size Pills (White)@{ub}
Add size to a player. See also @{"Size" Link "SIZE"}


@{b}Speed Pills (Black)@{ub}
These will increase your general speed by a factor of 1. This will last for a
short while and then wear off. You will have to collect one every so long to
maintain a speed that you are comfortable with.


@{b}Money Token (Green)@{ub}
These hold money in amounts of 1,2,3,4 Hundred.


@{b}Money Box (Gold)@{ub}
These hold 3 Money tokens.


@{b}Key (Key Shaped)@{ub}
When the key appears, anyone can collect it. When it is collected the doors
will open! and you will then be allowed to pass through the doors. The door
to the right will bring you out of the door on the left and the door on the
left will bring you out of the door on the right and the top and bottom doors
work in the same way. The doors can be used as short cuts as well as being a
quick escape if you are being chased. The only advantage to picking up the
key is that 3 money tokens's will appear and you will be the closest to them
when the doors have open. 


@{b}Slow Down Pill (Yellow Square with Black Centre)@{ub}
Slows down a player by a factor of 1.


@{b}Bomb (Bomb Shaped)@{ub}
A Free Bomb See, @{"Bomb" Link "SBOMB"}


@{b}Deflector (Black circle with white cross)@{ub}
A Free Deflector, @{"Deflectors" Link "SDEFL"}


@{b}Mega Size (Black and White Cheque)@{ub}
Collecting this will increase your size until you crash into something.


@{b}Extra Life (X Shaped)@{ub}
This will give you an extra life!


@{b}Virus (Large Square with Black circle in the center)@{ub}
See, @{"Viruses" Link "VIRUS"}


There might be some Un-Documented Features!!!!!!!!!  


@EndNode

@Node "SIZE" "The Size Pills"

Sneech has 2 Modes for Size and they are changed in the Options Screen:-

Size Pills
-=-=-=-=-=
In the normal mode small white pills will appear now and then for you to 
collect these pills will add between 5-15 onto your Size. Extra pills will
appear if there are more players on screen.

Auto Growth
-=-=-=-=-=-
In Auto mode there are only a few size pills but you will simply grow with
time. This way you don't have to worry about size and you can get stuck into
the killing! This is a recommended Mode because it makes the games more exciting
You don't have to collect as many objects and there's more attacking going on.

@EndNode

@Node "TEAMS" "Teams and Learner Mode"

Each player can either play as a single player with his own points/money etc.
or he can play as a member of a team.

There are 7 Teams to choose from:-

Red, Black, Green, Blue, White, Yellow, Purple.

This is selected in the @{"Title/Menu Screen" Link "TITLE"}.

You can have up to 7 teams but if a team has only 1 player then it is optional
whether you have him as a team or a single player! Teams of over 5 are not
recomended as the rating is affected by the amount of killable opponents.

Mixed teams are recomended ie. Computer/Human teams!

When Teams are selected the Money & Points of all the players are added
together and spread through the members eaqualy after each game. In the
@{"League Screen" Link "LEAGUE"} Each player will share the same Points and Rate, but
the Money may differ depending on whether the players used the loan options.

There are a number of advantages for teams:-

1. Bombs/Stunners/Viruses etc won't be used against team members.
2. Computer players will not attack their own human team members.
3. You will Shrink at a slower rate when crashing into your own team members.
4. You can protect you own team members especially when they are 'IT'  
5. Your Rate is better with more team members because there arent as many
   Killable worms. 

There are a number of disadvantages:-

1. If a member dies very quickly or doesn't do very well, it will affect the
   teams rating.
2. There are no kill/damage points for your own members.

On the whole the team modes ad a lot to the game. They make a league more
exiting because it is harder to shoot ahead. If a team is doing very well then
the other teams can pick on the not so good members of that team making it
harder for them to gain points as a team!

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Learner Mode
-=-=-=-=-=-=

An extra mode to choose is the learner mode.

The Learner players will have automatic Shop selection inluding...

Super Scooper
Slow Scooper
2 Extra Speeds
3 Reverses
Both Shields
Auto Turn
Deflectors
Reverses
Self Reverse
40 Extra Size
Constant Speed!
Survive As 1

It doesn't matter what money you have, all these will be given!

The disadvantage is a 25% Reduced Rate and no Shop Choice.

@endnode

@Node "VIRUS" "Viruses"

At the moment there is only one type of virus:-

@{b}The Green Virus
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-@{ub}

When or if someone collects the green virus he will then become infected!
The symptoms are Random Skrinking and a strange Greenishness!
The virus can be passed on by any type of contact with other players!
Once it is passed on that player is then clear of the virus as it passes
on totaly to the other player! The player who passes on the virus is immune
to it for a short while but after a short while or repeated bashings it will
be passed back! The virus will stay until someone linked or not linked with
it is killed!


Virus Points And Damages
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Damage points are awarded to the previous Virus Holder!
If a Player dies because of the Virus then the previous Virus Holder gets the
kill points!

More Viruses soon.............
 
@endnode

@NODE "SHOP" "Shopping!"

@{b}Money and The Shop@{ub}
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
During the game small green tokens will appear. This is where you get your
money. Sometimes small yellow tokens will appear. The yellow ones are money
boxes and they explode when you touch them, sending approx. 3 to 4 green money
tokens out around that area for you to collect. When someone is killed off
before the extra time period approx. 4 green tokens will be left behind. If
that player was the second to last player to die, then approx 4 yellow money
boxes will appear. As you can see, the best way to collect money is to kill
everybody else off!

The Shop
-=-=-=-=-

The shop is quite compact and does look a bit complicated when you first see
it. I have recently added 5 more shop items and a Money Load option. You will
see in the middle of the shop 3 red buttons and one green button. These will
take you to the two pages of shop items and the @{"Loan page" Link "LOAN"}.


Upper Shop
-=-=-=-=-=-

At the very top of the shop you can see the Player's name and money.

Below this are the 5 items that you can buy more than 1 of....

@Node "IT" "The Special 'IT' Bonus"

Sometimes when a game starts you will notice a circle around one of the 
players, this player is chosen to be 'IT'.

There is a special Points Bonus for killing this person off '150-210 Points'.

If this player lasts the game without getting killed off by one of the other
players then that player will get His own Kill Points and a Nice Money Bonus!

@EndNode

@Node "SSIZE" "Extra Size"
Extra Size :- $10

Something to spend the loose change on. You will start off with a size of 10+
anyway, But this will allow you to go in for an early kill with a bit of extra
size to play with.

@endnode


@Node "SSPED" "Extra Speeds"
Initial Speeds :- $400

This Lets you start off the game on a faster speed. As usual it does wear off
just like the speed pills. I would recommend getting at least 1 of these if
you have the money. If you start the game off faster than everyone else then
you will be able to pick other items up before they get to them!

@endnode

@Node "SREVS" "Reverses"
Reverse :- $250

If you have reverses and you are ever trapped completely (that is on all 3
sides), you will be reversed and the tail becomes the head and the head
becomes the tail.

@endnode

@Node "SBOMB" "Bombs"
Bombs :- $200

As you know already, the bombs will blast a nice hole through a tail. they
are best used to avoid being blocked off but they are also good for finishing
off someone when they get too small.

@endnode

@Node "SDEFL" "Deflectors"
Deflectors :- $200

When anyone tries to ram you with a bomb and you have a deflector then the
blast will be deflected onto them.

@endnode

@Node "SEXTR" "Extra Life"
Extra Life :- $600

Another most useful item, some people don't bother with these but I
would recommend you do, when you have the spare cash.

When you are killed off in a game you will be given the chance to come back
into the game. You will see a Green pointer in the place that you were killed
you can move this anyware in the arena. After about 6 seconds the game will
restart with you in the possition of the green pointer.

When you come back into the game your Size and Speed are set to normal. Any
other items you have like Reverses, Bombs, Scoopers etc. will remain active.

If you are killed in a game and you feel it isn't worth coming back then you
can select not to return by pointing the Green pointer outside the arena.
When this is done you will keep the Extra Life for another game saving you
$600 (The cost of an Extra Life). Remember that you will miss out on 100
points for finishing the game and also that the very last player in the
game gets the prize money!

@EndNode

@Node "SSCOO" "Super Scooper"
Super Scooper :- $230

This lets you pickup objects easier. Instead of passing through an object
you can simply pass by.

@EndNode

@Node "SPASS" "Pass Through"
Pass through :- $500

Not used very often, only to show off with how much money you have! this will
allow you to pass through yourself (only one part at a time!).

@EndNode

@Node "SRAND" "Random Factor"
Random Factor :- $300

Use this when you are hard up for points. When the Random Factor awards you
some points you could get 120 Points or More!! 

@EndNode

@Node "SNODM" "No Dead Money"
No Dead Money :- $150

When you die (Before Extra Time) a bit of money is awarded or left behind, But
with this you can stop the others from getting any money bonuses.

@EndNode

@Node "SSTUN" "Stunner"
Stunner :- $350

Use this to stun the first person to crash into you! The stun will last approx
40 seconds. After this a small count down will bring him back into the game.


@EndNode

@Node "SCONS" "Constant Speed"
Constant Speed :- $800

Usually, you will be collecting speed pills all of the time to keep your speed
up because after a while the speed pills wear off. 

If you buy a constant speed it will stop the Speed Pills wearing off so you
can simply pick up 4 pills and that will do you! Also the initial speed that
you buy in the shop will stay with you for the whole game. The only way to
slow down with the Constant speed is to collect the slow down pills!

@EndNode

@Node "SSLOW" "Slow Scooper"
Slow Scoop :- $150

When you have a Constant Speed or any other time when you are going very fast
you might find it difficult to collect the slow down pills. This Slow scoop 
will allow you to scoop them up easier.

Note. The normal Super Scooper doesn't work with Slow down pills.

@EndNode

@Node "SSELF" "Self Reverse"
Self Reverse :- $350

Sometimes you might find that you get blocked up and you are forced to use up
a reverse on yourself. This item will reverse you without using up the usual
Reverses. It lasts the whole game and can be used many times. You can even use
it to simply reverse so that you can control the other end lets say because a
good item is closer to the tail than your head. It is used the same as a
normal Reverse except it is only used when no other player is involved in the
blockage.

@EndNode

@Node "SSUV1" "Survive as 1"
Survive as 1 :- $400

This is a very interesting device that allows players to survive when they are
only 1 piece long.

At first it seems a bit pointless or at least expensive but when you realise
that it allows you to simply turn back on yourself anywhere you like, even in a
dead end you can simply turn back!

The drawback with the Survive as 1 is that you won't Auto Grow from a size
of 1. The only way to grow it pick up a White Pill or be crashed into by
another player!

@EndNode

@Node "SBOOS" "Speed Booster"
Speed Booster :- $600

This is a very useful item. It allows you to speed up at any time using the
fire button. When the fire button is pressed you will speed up by 2. You will
remain at this speed until you release the button. Then you will slow back down
but 2 speeds. This can be used as many times in a single game.

@EndNode
@Node "SSH" "Shields!!"
25% and 50% Shields...

These are useful if you have the extra cash and you want to go mad! it will
slow down the rate of shrinkage when you crash into a wall. The 25% will
mean that 1 in 4 hits won't damage you and the 50% shield will mean that 1 in
2 hits won't damage you. 

You can buy both of these to slow down the damage to 1 hit in 4!

Remember though that if you are going very fast you shrink very fast anyway!!!

Also the Shields have no effect on holes and bombs, only walls, players and
blockers!

@EndNode

@Node "STURN" "Auto Turn"
Auto Turn....

If you've got money to burn then this is quite useful. When you crash it will
automaticaly turn you into a good direction. You could even go at full speed
and let go of the joystick and see your worm bounce around the Arena!

@EndNode

@Node "BGRAB" "Bomb Grab"
Bomb Grab....

If you have the Bomb Grab, anyone who crashes into you with a Bomb will
simply pass the Bomb onto you!!! If you have a Deflector then you will
deflect the Bomb instead. Once Deflectors are used up the Bomb Grab will
come into effect.

@EndNode

@Node "SGRAB" "Stun Grab"
Stun Grab....

If you have the Stun Grab, anyone who crashes into you with a Stunner will
simply pass the Stunner onto you!!! Not all that usefull but it makes a
nice simple and cheap Stunn Sheild.

@EndNode

@Node "LOAN" "Loan Page"

The Loan System
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

One very useful feature is the Loan Feature..........

It's not available on the first game but after one game you will be able
to use it but be careful because an early loan can cause trouble if you
can't pay it back!!!

At the top of the loan page you will see your current Maximum Credit figure.
This Max Loan figure depends upon how careful you have been and how much
money you have been collecting. Someone who has been collecting loads of
money will have a better credit rate! But when that person has a bad game
it will give him something to fall back on after a bad game....

There is also a small amount of Max loan that depends on how many games are
left so even if you pick up nothing in the first game you will be able to
take out a small loan.

There is interest on the loans (20%) so if you loan $1000 you will have to pay
back $1200. The money will be taken out of your funds after the Statistics
Screen. If you are playing in a team then the loan will be payed back after
the money is split.

The loan feature means that for the first time it is possible to finish the
game with less than $0!!! when this happens your rating will be affected so
remember that the League is sorted on the Rate (Not the Points!).

When you take a loan out and you buy some shop items you might be left
with some unspent loan. This will be payed back without interest when you
select the OK Button.

Be careful when you take out Loans. Don't take one out just because you can't
do without a Constant Speed or an Extra Life. Remember that a Constant Speed
is not as useful if you haven't got any Speed to go with it! So try not to take
out loans in the second game if you can do without! 

@EndNode

@NODE "RATE" "The Rating System"

@{b}The Rating System@{ub}
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
At the end of the league the winner is the player with the highest Rating.
This is usually the player with the most points but it does take into account
other factors.

The rating system gives a fair rate for how well you have played on a whole
and was added to the game for the Hi-Score table which will save to disk after
each league.

The Rate takes into account:-

     No. of 'Killable' Players ie. not in your own team!
     Money. 
     Points.
     Learner Players loose some Rating.

@EndNode


@Node "HI" "The Hi-Score Table"

The Hi-Score Hall Of Fame

At the end of a League you might have gained a big enough @{"Rating" Link "RATE"} to gain a
place on the Hi-Score Table. Unlike other Hi-Score Tables each name is only
allowed to appear once. It is used to record each players Highest Rate.

New from Version 1.4

The screen now shows,

The Best Speed points in a game.
The Best Size points in a game.
The most money collected or won in a game. Not including Interest!
The most Kill and Damage points in a single game.

Just click on the topic you want to see.

@Node "SAVEGAME" "Saving & Loading A League"

Saving & Loading Old Games
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Sometimes you might want to play a long league or you might have to stop 
playing
for a while. In these cases you can now Save the League at the League Table 
Screen. It Saves all the players current Scores, Money and Weapons etc. As well
as the current game settings like Games Per League, Game Time, Auto Size etc.

The Old game can be loaded at the Main Title/Menu Screen by selecting button 'L'

If there is an Old Saved Game it will load it in replacing the current Settings
and Player Names, Colours and Controls as well as the current Game Options.

When you load and continue with an Old Saved game, that Game will cease to be 
an Old Saved game so in other words if you were to complete the league you 
wouldn't be able to Continue again from that saved position.

Safe Game Backups
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
If you are ever playing a game and there's a power cut or the game crashes?
I hope this never happens but It could crash due to a freak 'Guru!' or a very
rare bug! Anyway, if this happens you will be able to reload the game and carry
on with the league by loading the Old Saved Game. Sneech will automatically 
save the game before a Crash or power cut! 

I hope this will please those people who like to play long games. You can feel
safe knowing that the league can be continued if any problems arise!

@NODE "ADAPTOR" "Joystick Adaptor Info"

Adaptor Information
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
If you have a joystick adaptor the you should be able to use it with this
game. I've never had an adaptor and have never seen one before. I was told
that I could buy one in most computer shops but I couldn't find one when I
was shopping in Liverpool. I'm sure you could get one by mail-order if you
asked around a bit.

Here are the instructions for making one, as sent to me by, Peter Oliver,
Dudley, West Midlands. Although we have both used this method ourselves and
have had no problems I won't be held responsible for loss of data or Computer
faults brought about by using these instructions. Please follow these
instructions at your own risk!

      Buy 2 x 9 pin (male) plugs for the joysticks.
      Buy 1  25 pin (male) for the parallel port.
      And some conection wire!!!

      The pins connect like this...     

      Parallel,  Joy 3,  Joy 4
         2        1       
         3        2
         4        3
         5        4
         6                1
         7                2
         8                3
         9                4
         11               6
         13       6
         18       8
         19               8

On some games the joy 3 and joy 4 will be different.

If your interested in reading the Joystick adaptor using a program of your own
then heres how to do it.

    Peek($BFE101) Gives you All the Directons.

    AMOS Basic Example...

    If Btst(0,Peek($BFE101))=0 Then...... First Joy Movements
    If Btst(1,Peek($BFE101))=0 Then......
    If Btst(2,Peek($BFE101))=0 Then......
    If Btst(3,Peek($BFE101))=0 Then......

    If Btst(4,Peek($BFE101))=0 Then...... Second Joy Movements
    If Btst(5,Peek($BFE101))=0 Then......
    If Btst(6,Peek($BFE101))=0 Then......
    If Btst(7,Peek($BFE101))=0 Then......

    A bit set to Zero means movement whilst a 1 means no movement....
 
Now for the fire button:-

    Peek($BFD014) Gives Both Fire Buttons.

    AMOS Basic Example...

    If Btst(1,Peek($BFD014))=0 Then F1=True Else F1=False
    If Btst(4,Peek($BFD014))=0 Then F2=True Else F2=False

Sorry if any of this in incorrect but the addresses are perfect so you can
mess about with testing different bits if it doesn't work!!!!

Thanks to Ian Croucher for giving me this info. Thanks to Graham Wood for
sending me an adaptor so that I could get it working perfectly. If it wasn't
for Ian, Peter and Graham the 6 player mode still wouldn't be finished!!
