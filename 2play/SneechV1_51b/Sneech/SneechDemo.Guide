  but the demo no allows the saving of scores to disk.

  me and I'll send you he new version for free if it's via Email. If you cant
  accept the bug fix version by email then please send either an English SAE

  Or as an alternative I'll accept a post card from where you live!!

  Resistered users should send me their name/address so that I can check my
  database for a record. If you recieved the full version as a FREEBIE then
  you should explain to me when/where I sent it just to give me a little
  reminder :)

The 'L' or Learner mode will allow you to play using some of the extra shop
items like Constant Speed, Survive as 1, Self Reverse, Auto Turn, Shields etc.
The problem with the learner mode is 25% off Ratting and No choice etc.

As well as these limitations there is also the fact that I update the game
every month so if you do like the game you will miss out on the new items. 

It would help me if you told me which Amiga you own and a bit about HD, Memory
etc. Also if you could tell me where you got hold of this demo and which demo
Version you have got. It would also help if you quoted the name 'Sneech' as
I've got a couple of Shareware games out now and some people don't tell me
what game their after!

You can send a Cheque or P/O for £5 made out to :-

   'Paul Burkey'
   32 Cottage Close
   Little Neston
   South Wirral

   Email me at :- paulb@sneech.demon.co.uk

Overseas customers are welcome to send their own currency but you should
follow these prices if you want it sent via 'Snail Mail':-
 
    £6.50 - £7.00 Europe.          (Approx Currency so be honest) 
    £7.50 - £8.00 Outside Europe.

If you can receive your registered copy via email then you only have to
send at lease £5 worth of your own currency ie,

    10 US     $
    20 Dutch  Guilders
    20 German DM
    20 Aus    $
    40 Fin    Marks

Remember that UK postage is free!!!

Sorry but I don't have a full list, just be honest and you'll get your copy
the same day I receive the cash. I've only once been sent an International
Money order for £5 from Canada which didn't cost me anything to change so
if you want to contact your Bank and ask them for a £5 money order you can
try that. If you are unsure how much to send just email me and I'll work
something out for you :)

I have already had many happy customers from all over the world!!!!!

If you can send a £5 Note then do so as I can honestly be trusted and we'll
both be better off!! I'll pay the 'Snail Mail' postage if you send a fiver!

If you like this game and you play it a lot, you are quite welcome to
keep playing it and not pay for it (it is only a demo).

Thank You,

@node "CHANGES" "Recent Changes"

I've added a few extra Options and I've enabled some of the options in
the demo version. New options are as follows:-

Points Awarding Screens
-----------------------
You can now disable these screens and speed up the pace of the League. All
the normal points will be given out just as before.

Statistics Screen
-----------------
You can now disable the Statistics screen which will also speed up the
League a Small bit but it doesn't really save much time. This Option
is only for those who don't really care about points and stuff and who
just want to see who's winning. The Statistics screen gives you some
inportant info including 'Extra Bonuses' that you wouldn't normaly know
about. 

Other Changes
-------------
One or two small changes have been made including slightly faster Auto
Growth and a few other Tweaks to make the game more enjoyable.

@endnode



@Node "INTRO" "Introduction"

Introduction
------------
Sneech is a fast paced 'Worm Game' game for up to 10 players at a time. You
can play against 9 computer players depending on how many human players there
are and is as far as I know the first game ever to allow all 10 players to
play simultaneously on screen. This is why the game is so much fun to play.

The game has been played and tested for since Nov-94 and in this time many
changes and additions have been made. So the game has adapted to suit the
needs of many people.

When you first play Sneech it might look like just another Worm game. Some
people might also be thinking I've over done it and made it too complex. Well
you might be right, but then again it's not that complicated once you get
used to it. Everything has been added to make each game different rather
than just to look fancy.

You might find it too difficult or fiddly to play. Please!!!? Stick at
it and you will soon get the hang of it. The game was really designed to be
used by multiple Human players but it can be played by just 1.

@endnode

@NODE "Menu" "Main Menu Screen"

Main Menu Screen
----------------
Sneech has been written to allow many different game setups. You can have
0-6 Human players with 0-10 Computer players. You can set each player to
use any colour. You can even set up players to all have the same colour.

Players can also play on their own or part of a team, there is also a
Learner Option which is recomended for your first few games. 

The main screen has 10 sets of player icons as from left to right:-

Colour Indicator:  Small box with that players colour. Click on either the
                   Green button below or the colour indicator itself to bring
                   up a colour selector. Now just select the colour you want
                   for that player. For Computer players, the colour will also
                   change the difficulty rating as shown by the 1,2,3,4 Star
                   headings.

Players Name:      Next we have the players name box. If that player is a
                   Human player you can click in here and alter the name.
                   You can't however alter the Computer players names.

Player Control:    Clicking on this Icon will cycle through the different
                   control modes. These are:-

                   Off, Joy1, Joy2, Left Keyboard, Right Keyboard,
                   Adapter 3, Adapter 4, Computer.

                   Keyboard Controls are..... 

                             Left Keyboard      Right Keyboard

                   Up        Ctrl               Curs-Up
                   Down      L Shift            Curs-Down
                   Left      L Alt              Curs-Left
                   Right     L Amiga            Curs-Right
                   Select    Z                  Return

                   So from this you can set any combination of Computer,
                   Human or Off.

Player Mode:       The last icon is for player modes. The modes are either
                   Single player (Blue/Gray), Learner (Red 'L') or Team
                   Player.

                   To set up a team you just cycle this icon to a Team
                   Colour (Blue,Green,Red,Yellow,Black,White,Purple) and
                   then Cycle another players Mode to the same Team colour.
                   From this you can set up any combination of Computer,
                   Human Teams of any size. You can have some players in
                   Teams and some not in teams.....

Once the game is set up you select the 'Start' Button to begin the league. If
You press the 'Demo' Button a 1 game demo will start. With the 'demo' you
can start a game with 0 Humans if you want.

The 'Hi-Score', 'Save', 'Load' and 'Merge' buttons are not available in the
demo version.

In the top left of the main menu screen there is a button that will exit to
DOS.

The options screen is limited on the demo version and unless you've played
the dame a few times I'd leave it alone for now. Read the Full Game Guide
for full details on the whole game.....

@NODE "GAME" "The Game Itself"

@{b}The Game!@{ub}
---------
The game itself lasts for 4 or more minutes. 
After a small countdown the game will start!

The game is split into 3 time periods these are :-

   Green        Start off Period     (Get going!)
   Blue         Game Time            (Best Points Time Zone)
   Red          Extra Time           (No extras! Get out!!!)

The object of the game is to gain more points than everyone else. And at the
same time collect as many Money tokens as possible. THr money helps you
to buy some extra goodies for the next game.

There are a variety of different @{"Game Extras" Link "GAMEEXTRAS"} to help you
out with each game.

You gain points by killing people. If you do kill someone you will get their
kill bonus as displayed at the start of the game. To kill someone you will
have to force them to crash into you. When this is done they will shrink a
little and you will grow a little. If they shrink below 2 pieces then they
are killed.

After the normal time has run out and you go into the extra time, A door will
appear. You will have to exit by moving into the door! You don't have to go
straight in but you will receive 100 points for ending your go this way.
If you don't make it into the door and the extra time runs out then you will
simply shrink to death! and loose out on your 100 finish bonus.

@Node "GAMEEXTRAS" "Extra Game Elements"

Durring a game you will come accross various game objects. Some are Arena
objects and some are Collectable objects.


@{b}Arena Objects
-=-=-=-=-=-=-@{ub}

@{b}Blocks (Striped or Metalic)@{ub} 
Various shaped blocks appear at random. You should always avoid them.


@{b}Slip Mats (Light coloured Squares)@{ub}
These allow you to move at a higher pace.


@{b}Slow Down Mats (Dark Coloured Squares)@{ub}
These make you move at a slower pace.


@{i}Note. Don't get confused between Slow/Slip mats and the Chequered floor.@{ui} 


@{b}Holes (Easily noticable!)@{ub}
Avoid at all times. Any contact with the holes will reduce your size much
faster than any other objects.


@{b}Ramps And Bumps@{ub}
You might come accross sections of the floor that are raised. As you would
expect traveling accross these will alter your speed. I've added an extra
element to a players movement, that of 'momentum' when you move up a hill you
will of course slow down if you then move on level ground the slow down will
eventually cancel out. When you travel down a hill you will gain momentum and
travel at a faster pace. Again, this will cancel out when you travel on level
ground.


@{b}Ice!@{ub}
These dont appear very often but when they do you should avoid them. When
you cross a patch of Ice you will loose your ability to turn! It can be done
but it's not reliable!

 

@{b}Collectable Objects
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-@{ub}

@{b}Size Pills (White)@{ub}
These Pills will appear now and then for you to collect. They add between
5-15 onto your Size. In Auto growth mode there are only a few size pills but
you will grow with time. This way you don't have to worry about size too much
and you can get stuck into the killing! 

@{b}Speed Pills (Black)@{ub}
These will increase your general speed by a factor of 1. This will last for a
short while and then wear off. You will have to collect one every so long to
maintain a speed that you are comfortable with.


@{b}Money Token (Green)@{ub}
These hold money in amounts of 1,2,3,4 Hundred.


@{b}Money Box (Gold)@{ub}
These hold 3 Money tokens.


@{b}Key (Key Shaped)@{ub}
When the key appears, anyone can collect it. When it is collected the doors
will open! and you will then be allowed to pass through the doors. The door
to the right will bring you out of the door on the left and the door on the
left will bring you out of the door on the right and the top and bottom doors
work in the same way. The doors can be used as short cuts as well as being a
quick escape if you are being chased. The only advantage to picking up the
key is that 3 money tokens's will appear and you will be the closest to them
when the doors have open. 


@{b}Slow Down Pill (Yellow Square with Black Centre)@{ub}
Slows down a player by a factor of 1.


@{b}Bomb (Bomb Shaped)@{ub}
These will allow you to ram into other players and cause some nice damage.
@{i}Read the full guide for more info.@{ui}

@{b}Deflector (Black circle with white cross)@{ub}
@{i}Read the full guide for info.@{ui}


@{b}Mega Size (Black and White Cheque)@{ub}
Collecting this will increase your size until you crash into something.


@{b}Extra Life (X Shaped)@{ub}
This will give you an extra life!

*NOTE* There might be some Un-Documented Features ;)
