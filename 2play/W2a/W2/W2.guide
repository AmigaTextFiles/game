     If you have played WtW (Wålly the Wörrm) you probably know what this is 
     all about and then you don't have to read ALL of this boring manual.
     So... this is what you need to know:
     
     W2 is very similar to WtW but with a few changes (surprise, surprice)!
     The changes are (in no particular order):
     
     @{fg highlight}*@{fg text}    @{" Four new levels " Link "The levels"} Wow! ;-)
     *    4 tunes to every level.
     @{fg highlight}*@{fg text}    3 flashing "items" at the same time
     *    Cool teleporters.
     @{fg highlight}*@{fg text}    @{" Action items. " Link "The items"} Be careful when you take theese items.
     *    OneWay-doors.
     @{fg highlight}*@{fg text}    New cool "Pinball-like" scoreboard.
     *    64 colours instead of 32  (sory we couldn't make it in AGA)
     @{fg highlight}*@{fg text}    @{" TWO-PLAYER MODE !! " Link "Two-player"} (May the best worm win)
     *    Three different speed levels instead of just two.  ;-)
     @{fg highlight}*@{fg text}    Ability to load other levels.
     *    @{" Make your own levels " Link "Userlevels"}
     @{fg highlight}*@{fg text}    Animated "items" to pick up.
     *    Flashing colours on the levels to bring them to life.
     @{fg highlight}*@{fg text}    No long anoying "got-new-hiscore" intro anymore.
     *    Two different Start-positions. (Random selection)     
     @{fg highlight}*@{fg text}    TWO different @{" 2-Ply modes! " Link "Two-player"}( F3 = Snake mode )

     This is what i can remember at the time... ;-)
     
     Other things that could be "good to know" before you start is:
     
     * The @{" background story. " Link "Introduction"} (short "intro" story)
     * And the @{" hotkeys. " Link "Hotkeys"} (Scoreboard features etc.)
     @{fg highlight}* NOTE!@{fg text}
       When playing 2-ply the "start-positions" will be selected RANDOMLY!
       The object of the 2-ply mode is to get the other player killed!
     * Also read about the @{" Action Items. " Link "The items"}

     Okey...I think you now what this is, We had to do a "ghost level".
     This is the first level we did, so there's not much to say.
     Just one ehh.. "flashy" effect. Maybee you'll notice it. :-)
     Otherwise this is pretty much the STANDARD level.
     
     I have to say that ALLI did a very nice job with the
     shadow effects on the stairs of this level.
     
     Oh! That's right. There is one secret "door" he..He..HE..HA HA..hrm
     If you look REAL close you might see it (You'll have to squeece
     your nose realy close to the monitor :-)


     @{fg highlight}@{u} Iron Gate @{uu}@{fg text}

     This is similar to the Techno-level on Wtw.
     Hmm.. are we completely out of imagination you might wonder.
     Hear this! This level contains a SUPER DELUXE STATE-OF-THE-ART
     THREE-WAY TELEPORTER !!! Yes it's true!
     How it works: The two BLUE teleporters are conected to eachother
     directly.. go into one and come out through the other.
     The RED one is conected to both the BLUE ones, you will not know
     wich one you will come out through :-)
     
     NOTE! When you "teleport" yourself you will come out going in
     another direction, so don't keep your joystick in the wrong
     direction or you'll probably just end up in a wall!
     
     Ehh... otherwise it's a pretty standard level.
     
     
     @{fg highlight}@{u} Break Beat @{uu}@{fg text}
     
     OK! This is our favourite level!
     It's kind of a Disco level with some nice effects.
     Including many flashing lights, a tiny teleporter and a thing
     that we call "the subway". The thing with the subway is that
     you almost can't see yourself inside it!
     The teleport is really just a U-shaped tunnel. but you don't have
     to worry about making the U-turn (if you know what i mean).
     
     You will also notice that Wålly will change colour when he goes
     over certain areas! I think you will like this level, the music
     and the graphics creates a real nice arcade-atmosphere.
     
     
     @{fg highlight}@{u} Laser Dome @{uu}@{fg text}
     
     OK! We know this level looks a bit strange! It's not a bug and you
     should not try fix your monitor! ;-)
     When we started making this game, we were only going to do three
     levels! After a while however, Niklas and I thought that 3 levels
     would be a bit cheap. (There should be more levels in a sequel!)
     Alli wasn't to happy though! having to make yet another level.
     But, after a while we convinced him that we could make this weird
     level.
     
     NOTE!
     Laser Dome is mainly thought of as a 2-ply level! The reason is
     that it's hard to see what the other player is doing which makes
     playing a bit more interesting! 
     At first we thought that it would be a "2-ply ONLY" level, but later
     we rejected that idea.
     
     Think of this as a BONUS level. (NOT a standard level!)  ;-)

     There is three items on the level at the same time.
     
     Here's a table of what happens when you take the different
     "items", how many points you'll get and how much longer you will be!
     
     @{fg highlight}NOTE! @{fg text}Some colours are only available in either 1 or 2-ply mode!
     "Stays" = How many pixels you can go before the item disappear!
     "Mode"  = In which mode ( 1Ply / 2Ply ) that the item is available!
     

     @{u}Colour  Mode  Points  Length  Stays  What happens!@{uu}
     
@{fg highlight}     Blue     1     750       8     600   Changes your direction randomly.@{fg text}
     Red      2      -       10     500   Freezes your opponent 4 a while.
@{fg highlight}     Orange   2      -       10     500   Changes direction of your enemy.@{fg text}
     Green   1&2    900       9     550   Dig under the ground 4 a while.
@{fg highlight}     Yellow  1&2    650      10     650   Nothing !!@{fg text}
     Pink    1&2    500      12     650   Nothing !!
@{fg highlight}     Grey    1&2    400      20     450   Nothing !!@{fg text}
     
@{fg highlight}     NOTE! @{fg text}If you don't take any items you will get 1 pixel longer every
     30 pixel you go! you will also get 1 point every pixel you move forward!
     
     Ok! I hope You'll notice that some items are better than others.
     And also that it's actually better to just be winding around than to
     take the GREY items. (you'll get more points and less length!)
     
     In 2-Ply mode on the other hand, it can be good to take the grey items.
     Because the longer you are the harder it gets for your opponent!
     The same things goes for the yellow and pink items: in 1-ply mode they
     are both good, although the yellow is better. And in 2-ply mode the
     pink item will probably be better!
     
     @{fg highlight}The GREEN items @{fg text}can be very useful and dangerous! They will make you
     go under ground for about 20 pixels. Using green items you can go under
     walls and under yourself or your enemy. The danger is that you might be
     directly under a wall when Wålly heads for the surface again = dead!
     
@{fg highlight}     Knowing theese things will give you an advantage over your friends ;-)@{fg text}

     A new BIG feature in W2 is 2-Ply mode. This is probably the best way to
     enjoy the game. The object in this mode is NOT to get as many points as
     possible. Instead you should try to KILL your opponent :-} by making
     him crash into any obsticle on the level (including both worms).
     
     @{fg highlight}NOTE!@{fg text} Watch carefully where your worm start!!
     Since the starting locations are randomly choosen EVERY time you play!
     Although there are only 2 possible places!

     I recomend you to look through the @{" Items page. " Link "The Items"}
     There are a few items that affects the game quite a bit!
     Mostly the RED and ORANGE ones but also the GREEN ones!
     
     @{fg highlight}SNAKE-MODE@{fg text} is another way of playing with
     a friend. You start this mode by pressing F3 instead of F2. I will not
     entirely explain snake-mode now, I leave that for you to discover...
     Just try not to panic! ;-)

     One more thing: The reason that the worms are in the same colour is
     because it would make too many colours of the palette unusable for the
     level! Unfortunatly we couldn't make it in AGA! :-(
     
     Oh.. if you wonder what the names of the worms are:
     Ply1: Wålly the wörminator (cyberdyne system model 102)
     Ply2: W1000    ( stupid liquid metal )
     
     (If you didn't get that last joke your'e probably not a T2 fan!)

     Congratulations on getting the W2 game, clearly the choise of
     a discerning worm-game-lover!
     
     As you will no doubt have noticed, our continual quest for excellence
     has resulted in this, the culmination of the search for the most
     advanced technology and ergonomic design embodied in one worm game.
     
     etc. etc...
     
     W2 is the sequel of Wtw (Wålly the wörrm) which came early in 1996.
     We actually began making W2 (Wålly 2 "the wörminator") the same year.
     The reason that it took so long to finnish was that we had lots of
     school work to do. (unfortunately ;-) and after that Niklas and I
     had to do millitary duty. (When I'm writing this I still have 1½
     month to do.)
     
     The game is really just a simple worm-game. The same kind you played
     on those old computers where the graphics consisted of different
     kinds of letters :-)
     
     The object of the game is to eat as many "flashing items" as possible.
     You will then become longer and longer and eventually you will crash
     either against yourself or against some of the walls.
     
     To find out what happens and how many points you get for the items
     read the @{" Action Items. " Link "The items"} section.

     It does work on A1200 030 8Mb

     A new feature in W2 is that you can make your own levels.
     This may be a bit tricky and you won't be able to create all the
     effects that exist on the already made levels.

     To create a level you need a painting program (we used DPaint4)
     The pictures should be 320x256x64_halfbright IFF.
     "Halfbrigth" means that the last 32 colours are exactly half as
     bright as the first 32 (ie. RGB 444 = RGB 222).
     
     I will now try to explain how W2 works, i hope you will understand.

     * A level is made up by 2 pictures.
     
     * The pictures lies ontop of eachother so there is one picture
       that you never will see. I call this picture "MAP".
       
     * The MAP is used to detect crashes against walls and Wally himself.
       It is also used to determine the colour of Wally.
       
     * The picture that the user see is called the "LEVEL pic". this
       picture contains the "good"/"real" graphics.
       
     * It's important that the palette is the same for both pictures.
     
     * When Wally is drawn on to the LEVEL pic. The program first looks
       at the MAP to determine which colour Wally will have.
       ie. if Wally is to be drawn onto the pixel 100,150 (x,y) the
       program looks on the MAP pixel 100,150. If this pixel is painted
       with colour 12 then Wally will be drawn with colour 12.
       
       This is how we have done the shadow effects, the flash effects and
       this is what makes Wally white (most of the time). If we painted
       the whole MAP picture pink, Wally would always be pink.

     * Some colours are used for detecting crashes. Be carefull when you
       use theese. (Read the "Colour table" section.)

     * You have to use crashcolour 04 around the whole level, so that
       Wally can't go out of the screen (the game will crash).

     * You also have to make room for and paint the scoreboard
       at the bottom of the screen. I suggest that you copy the example
       MAP picture included and paint your own MAP picture on that.

       We have marked out the two starting points for the worms on the MAP
       picture included, and also written some explaining coments.
       This MAP picture also has the rigth measures for the scoreboard.

     * Some colours indicates a "zone change". This can be used to make
       "one way doors". usually Wally crashes when he finds
       colour: 31,04 or 01 (All the walls are painted whith colour 01).
       By using the ZONE colours (29,30,61,62) you can create an area
       on the level where wally crashes against other colours.
       
       Are you still reading?? :-)   Good... Hang in there.
       
       For example: This is how the "one way doors" on the IRON GATE
       level is done: (This is how you should paint the MAP)
       
       First you start the level, Wally is always in zone 1 at this time!
       
       When Wally goes through the top door (heading down), he first
       find the colour 03. At this time that colour doesn't effect him
       more than other colours (obviously he will be painted with colour
       03 on the LEVEL pic (read@{" Basics " Link "Basics"}.))

       On the next pixel he finds one of the colours 29,30,61,62.
       This will tell him that he now is in zone 2.
       (He will also be painted in that colour on the LEVEL pic.)
       When he is in Zone 2 he will no longer crash against the colours
       01 and 31. He WILL however crash aginst colour 03!
       
       So if he tries to return through the same door. He will first
       find colour 29,30,61 or 62 (zone 2) then he will find colour 03
       and DIE! This is how the "one way door" works.
       To get out from zone 2 you go through the other door with colour
       31 and then any colour except 29,30,61,62 and 09,10,11.
       (The colours 09,10,11 are neutral.) This will tell him that he is
       back on Zone 1. (In Zone 1 he crashes aginst 01,31,04).
       
     * The colours 09,10,11 are neutral, ie. they can be used on both
       zone 1 and zone 2. This means that you have only a few colours to
       use on zone 2: 09,10,11,29,30,61,62 every other colour will tell
       Wally that he is back on zone 1. And colour 03 and 04 will kill him!

     * You can not make one single colour flash, but you can make a colour
       cycle. The "one way doors" on IRON GATE are made of three colours
       that cycles.
       Lets say that you want to cycle colour 6,7 and 8 whith eachother.

       To do this you will have to paint in the upper left corner of the
       MAP. Start with pixel 0,0 (= upper left). Paint this pixel with
       colour 6, the next pixel (1,0) (one step right) with colour 8
       and the next pixel (2,0) with colour 10. This will cycle colour
       6 to 8 with speed 10 (fast). If the colours are blue,white,red
       then you now have three colours which flashes from blue to white to
       red to blue to white.... and so on. Speed is set whith the third
       colour 1=fast 64=slow. After the third pixel you can define another
       cycle if you want to.
       
       The program will read the colours in the top left and translate
       them into cycling information.

     09-11     Can be USED without problems on both zone 1&2.

     14        Reserved for the SCOREBOARD (Fading and flashing).     

     29,30,61,62 Will tell Wally that he is in zone 2.

     All colours except 29,30,61,62,09,10,11 Will tell Wally

       P1. The level apears in strange colours in the game.
       S1. The LEVEL pic. uses the colours from the MAP.
           It's important that the two pictures have the same palette.
           
       P2. Wally crashes against things he shouldn't crash against.
       S2. You have used a "crash colour" by mistake. Or used the
           zone colours somewhere so Wally things he is in a different
           zone and therefore crashes against other colours (read above).
           
       P3. How do I make shadow effects?
       S3. Use a bright background, then paint with darker colours on the
           MAP where you want Wally to be darker. (Next to walls!)

       P4. My music doesn't sound right in the game.
       S4. It is a few years since AMOS music routines was updated ;-)
           Your song may contain stuff that AMOS don't understand.

       P5. The game crashes if Wally goes too near the edges of the screen.
       S5. You have to make a safety wall around the level (crash-colour).
       
       P6. My level flashes in a strange way, even though I didn't make
           any flashing effects.
       S6. You have probably used one of the colours: 1,2,3,14 somewhere
           on the MAP picture. Theese are reserved for items and scoreboard!

     When you have made the two pictures. (Map and Level)
     You have to pack them. You can do this with the program included.
     The files will be named "something.M" and "something.B".
     Where "something" is the name of the level.
     This is the text that will show up in the game!

     If you want the level to be called "BananaWorld" in the game, you
     should name the files "BananaWorld.M" and "BananaWorld.B".
     Although this will be taken care of by the packing program :-)

     If you want to have music to your level you have to make this in
     Med format. the music file should be named "BananaWorld.tune".
     if you want the music to change when you die etc. you have to do
     a multisong (MED). It should include 4 songs:

     1=Intro.   2=While Playing.     3=Killed.       4=Highscore.

     Pictures and songs should all be placed in the X_Levels drawer.

     Hmm... I don't think you will need any instructions, but here are
     some tips:
          
   1. The object of the game is: In one player mode to collect points.
                                 In two player mode to kill your opponent.

   2. You will crash and die if you run into walls or yourself
      our you opponent. Although...

   3. ...it is possible to run over yourself without dying if you go
      diagonaly in a cross (like an " X ") Your odds are 50%   ;-)
            
   4. Not all the items are good items! Read @{" Action items " Link "The items"}

   5. If The game is too hard, try playing with "PC SPEED" (slower :)

                           @{b}@{u} How to install @{ub}@{uu}

     Just unpack or copy the game where you want it to be.

     You have to copy the fonts to the fonts drawer!
     
     To install new levels just copy the files to the X_Levels drawer.
     For a new level to work you need atleast three files:
     
     Level.B  Level.M  and  Level.tune
     
     You can also have a highscore file (should be in hiscore drawer.)
     and an image file: Level.IM (in X_Levels drawer).
