Registering

The registered version has an intro, 
outro, 4 maps with different graphic 
styles, more characters to play, big 
manual, harddisk installer, rad disk 
installer and lots of extra options.

It cost Fl 10,-- (dutch guilders)
        £   3,-- (pounds Stirling)
        $   5,-- (U.S. dollars)

Which we think is pretty decent for a 
computer game.

It or information can be obtained from:
The start of this file, the demo version
has a time limit and you can only play
one of four maps of the registered 
version.

Downtown map:
The cruel life on the streets where everything 
is grey.
The block-layout makes it easy to line out 
shots horizontally and diagonally, but many 
shots will get absorbed behind corners of 
containers.
You can turn the advantage when you lure a 
chasing enemy into the supermarket.




Controls
Getting around in this game is easy, all of the 
controls are located on the joystick and every 
player has a joystick.

(try diagonals for double fun)

Pressing fire takes us to the fun part.
Walk up to other player.
Repeat
  Point gun in his general direction.
  Press fire for perforation.
  Check ammo.
Until ammo is gone.
Run like the clappers.




Weapons
Pressing fire can also have a different effect. 
When you're standing on an object while 
pressing fire the object will be collected.

Some objects will replace the weapon you're 
holding, others will add something to your 
current status;

List of weapons:

Pistol;  standard weapon, no thrills 
here.

Shotgun; makes big holes, but is only 
effective when you get close to a 
player with an ammo problem.

AK-47; fires faster then the usual 
weapons but doesn't do much damage at 
all.

1 KW laser; high speed, long range, 
highly damaging weapon, use this to 
pick on people with dangerous guns.

Bazookoid;
makes really big holes, and also has a 
blastwave to take out any  
close person, the weapon of 
        champions.

Bull pup; personal, portable, nuclear 
nightmare. The blastwave makes it 
dangerous as a closerange weapon  
though.

Step on nuk; Plants an invisible mine 
just in front of you, making walking 
around a tricky business. We think it's        
a vile tool of the devil and frequently  
make pacts not to use it.

Plasma nuk; High performance toaster 
from alien origin.

Biohazard; Alien anti-mailman tool 
(pet), will affect a person hit  
unpredictably. 




Objects

First aid kit; Godsend packages of 
mercy.
usually placed in awkward positions. 

Ammo; More ammo, more death, more fun, 
'nuff said.

Human zapper; Alien tool that allows 
you to "take his life"

Warp drive; Alien "Ticket to anywhere", 
that makes you doubt the randomness of  
         a random placing.
