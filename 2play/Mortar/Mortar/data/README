I have included here images generated for 320x200 (they work also for
others but scaling doesn't look that pretty) and 640x480 resolutions
('.big' images).  Images with filename ending '.pic' are for 256-color
and ones ending '.16' are for 16-color (TOS version) or better.  In
monochrome Mortar uses dithering and works with both sets.

config.* files are example configuration files.  Their comments should
help you to tune Mortar gameplay to your liking (and you do should tune
them because I haven't yet hit into satisfactory enough defaults :-().
If config.def doesn't work too well for you, try 'config.vga'.

'english' is the default language file for Mortar.  You can translate it
to your own language.  The default font image 'font.pic' contains the
latin-1 character set but it should be fairly easy to create your own
image (see README and Makefile in utils/ directory) in case you need
other characters.

If you have compiled or installed GSI (generic sound interface) server,
you will get sound effects (*.au) and background midi music (*.mid).
