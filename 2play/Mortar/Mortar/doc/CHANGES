TODO

	v0.6 ground lowering (compile-time option?)
	v0.7 client/server implementation for network play (unix only?)
	v0.8 improve the user interface and add more graphics (like Worms?)
	v0.9 enviromental hazards (lightning, meteors)
	v1.0 fix bugs, add more drivers

Different platforms need additional maintainers (for example, *I*'m not
going to code DOS sound support) and new language files would be nice.
Nice Mortar demos (raytraced MPEG etc) would be appreciated too. <wink>

Also, if somebody doesn't have large enough resolution at his/her/its
disposal, implementing scrolling to a graphics driver shouldn't be
too hard.  You just draw the relevant portion of the game 'virtual
screen' to you monitor screen at every refresh.  Only trouble is
deciding when to 'scroll' so that it isn't too distractive. :)

This will need the remade user interface (eg put some of it to
win-*.c files so that it could use a different window in windowing
enviroments)...

For some platforms there could be external GUI scripts/programs for
setting the configuration file options more conveniently before running
the game itself.


CHANGES

August 31th 1999, v0.5.5:
- Amiga OS port and bugfix to shield removal by Frank Wille
  <frank@phoenix.owl.de>.

May 15 1999:
- 15&32 bit GGI fix from Osku Salerma <osku@iki.fi>.

May 4 1999:
- Added 'xwmortar' target in case you're out of your mind and want to run
  W version of mortar on monochrome X with the help of W2Xlib (it has
  very inefficient X blitting routine).  Running mortar on monochrome
  W will perform much better.

March 28 1999:
- win-ggi.c uses now the new ggiFlushRegion() LibGGI function.  This
  should decrease Mortar CPU usage significantly under GGI+X.

Feb 18 1999, v0.5.4b:
- Changed snd-gsi.c to reflect changes in GSI.
- Player didn't explode when sliding outside screen, fixed (I hope).
- Experimental Pilot/uCLinux ie linux/monofb support (haven't tested
  it at all yet though).

Jan 1 1999, v0.5.4:
- Changed snd-gsi.c to reflect changes in GSI.
- Shooting power isn't anymore decreased with the damages.
  This should make the gameplay more fun.
- Added energy / wind banners above shooting values.

Dec 19 1998:
- Ahem, forgot snd_flush() from win-lfb.c win_sync()...
- Fixed Makefile so that the 'mort' script finally gets '$*'.

Dec 16 1998:
- Tested Mortar with glibc and added support for Linux framebuffers
  (win-lfb.c, you'll need v2.1.1xx kernel to use it).  Should work on
  all 8-bit mode sizes.

Aug 29 1998:
- Converted README to a manual page.
- Some minor fixes.

Aug 18 1998:
- Added background (midi) music playing option and implemented it for GSI.
- Fixed a couple of bugs in the gameplay.
- Added Boomerang and Timer shot types.

Aug 14 1998, v0.5:
- Added GSI sound driver (really easy :)).
- Implemented cannon dropping.
- Fixed bonus giving error.

Aug 12 1998, v0.4:
- Redefined some shot/shield routines.
- Added sound support and TOS sound driver.
- Added new win-ggi.c file from Andrew Apted.  This one supports several
  different bit-depths!

Aug 9 1998:
- Added utility handling + battery and suicide utilities.
- Fixed list handling for going to both directions in item list.
- Added shield handling and bouncer, damper, pay-backer, repulser,
  passer and teleporter shield types.

Aug 7 1998, v0.3:
- GGI port by Andrew Apted <andrew.apted@ggi-project.org> (thanks!).
- Added PPM reading / conversion to P8M format and PPM save routine.
- Reads game strings / messages from a language file.
- Fixed command line option parsing.

Aug 4 1998:
- Added back, bounce, dig, float, roll, stone and surprise shot types.

Aug 2 1998, v0.2:
- Added shot bying / selling.
- Improved collision checking in img_blit(), img_circle() and shot_hit().

Aug 1 1998:
- Optimized TOS interleaved routines for 4 / 8 bits and left the generic
  c2p-routine out.  8-bit routine is untested.

Jul 29 1998:
- support Atari TOS in 16-color mode.  Actually any interleaved bitmap
  resolution is supported, but for Mortar graphics you need at least 16
  colors.  STE color palette is supported (ie. 4-bit color entries).

Jul 28 1998:
- support Atari TOS in monochrome mode (faster than using W).

Jul 27 1998, v0.1:
- added wind and created images for 16-color resolutions.

Jul 26 1998:
- implemented explosions and their color cycling.

Jul 25 1998:
- Completed DOS support (needs DJGPP).  320x200x256 (VGA) and
  640x480x256 (VESA) modes supported so far.

Jul 24 1998:
- implemented shooting, first actually playable version...

Jul 1998:
- started coding MORTAR.

1997:
- Warzone, a monochrome MORTAR prototype using W toolkit.  Explored out
  what kind of things are needed for a game like this.
