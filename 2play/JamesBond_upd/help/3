Playing the game is simple:
The screen is split into 4. The objective is to kill the other players while
making sure you don't get killed yourself. Your AMMO and HEALTH is displayed
in the 'Player Stats' bar. 

There are also weapons and powerups to be picked up around the level.

Once you've had enough, press ESC and the scores are totalled up.
