You Only Live Twice, V0.9

Notes About Update:


This update is mainly to allow extra image sets
to be used ingame.

The first of these is the AustinPowers set, which
can be downloaded from Aminet or my homepage.

These image sets can be made by anyone, as the
game supports IFF loading.

For more info about making image sets, view the
guide file in the Patch_Tools Drawer
