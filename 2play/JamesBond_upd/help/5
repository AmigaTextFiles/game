Known bugs:
-----------

I've tried my best to get rid of bugs, but there are 
still some in there: 

1. When in a thin passageway, you can't shoot forwards 
because your bullets hit the wall (same with rockets!)

2. If you don't have enough chip ram it may crash.
(I'm not sure why it crashes, but it wouldn't work 
anyway, would it.)

3. The title screen music sometimes mucks up and causes
an error. (not serious)

4. Sometimes the first explosion of the game does no
damage.

PS. This game is totally year 2000 ignorant, infact it
doesn't care what the date is.
