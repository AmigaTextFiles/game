The Story so far...
-------------------

Its the height of the Cold War.

An American space ship has been captured by an unknown craft, and
the Americans are blaming it on the Russians. War seems imminent.

The British, however, managed to track the space ship landing
near Japan. They had already dispatched there best man, James Bond
who was already busy conducting his own brand of 'secret service'. 

Suddenly gunmen burst in on him and shoot him!

He gets a full navy burial, where he is put to rest at sea, 
where upon blokes in scuba gear take his body back to a sub, 
where he is of course still live and kicking. The whole death was 
faked to help him get rid of his enemies for a while.

Now you have control of Agent 007, you must investigate Japan and 
get to the bottom of this mystery, before World War breaks out.
