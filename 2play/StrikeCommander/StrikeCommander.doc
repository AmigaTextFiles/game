Strike Commander V1.10. Date: 06-Jan-94
Written by Chris Hodges and Peter Hodges using AMOS Professional.

Information
~~~~~~~~~~~
We are not in any way resonsible for loss of data, loss of sanity, loss of IQ
and the possiblity of becoming adicted ;-)
Since this game is Shareware the price for this disk must not exceed the cost
for disk and postage.
This document must be distrubuted along with the Strike Commander program.
Strike Commander and this document must not be altered in any way (excluding
spelling mistakes!) without written permission.

The Game
~~~~~~~~
There is no mission, no story, only one great aim: shoot the other player from
the sky. The game is played using one or two joysticks. To enable the second
player press the fire button right at the beginning of each game.

The Controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pressing the joystick to the left will rotate the jet anti-clockwise, and to
the right will do it clockwise. When pushing the joystick forward the plane
will accelerate and down will engage the breaks.

Scoring
~~~~~~~
Crashing with the other plane will not give any points. Blowing up an UFO or
shooting the other player will give you a single point. Crashing into ground
increases the other players score. The game is over when one player reaches 20
points.

Different Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As you may have already seen there two versions of the game. These are the
differents:
			Strike Commander 68000   Strike Commander 68020+
Number of colours used: 16 colours               32 colours
Clouds                : none                     depending on the computer
Computer intelligence : very low                 rather high (more complex)

Although both versions can be run on every Amiga, the 68000 version will not
be so jerky or even run at 50 frames.

Strike Commander is Shareware

Finally, some words to you. If you like this game, why not sending us some
money or a gift (like disks, PD, joysticks, mice, floppy drives, modems,
harddisks, graphic cards, Real 3D, A4000/040s, etc.). Thanks for it!
If you don't like Strike Commander, copy it on to someone else. We would
appreciate any letters you send in to comment about the game, even if you
don't like it.
Moreover, you can mail me for AMOS stuff and help in some problems.
