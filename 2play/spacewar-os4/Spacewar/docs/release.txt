RELEASE NOTES
-------------
Version 0.3

Hi all! It's been a long time since i worked on Spacewar! This release I 
added some requested features:

The HP bars now float above the ships. Before, one did not have to look 
at the bar - it would be his death. Also, for the sake of nice gaphics, 
i changed the bar color to the color of the respective ships.

The last thing I've changed is the color of the Boom image, which was 
white before. When the red ship explodes, the Boom will be red, if the 
blue ships explodes, the color will be blue, and if they are both 
exploding, the color would be white.
