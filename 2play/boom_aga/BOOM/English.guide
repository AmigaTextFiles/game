BOOM is Giftware. You are allowed to spread it all over the world, as long
as all files are unmodified included. The files are
"BOOM", "BOOM.info",
"Deutsch.guide", "Deutsch.guide.info",
"English.guide" and "English.guide.info".

Further it is not allowed to sell BOOM for more than a small fee for the
medium.

@node Rules

BOOM bases on the idea of BomberMan/DynaBlaster. If you do not know that
games, read the following short description:
Every player tries to survive (very easy so far), but the others do not let
him. You can drop bombs to stop your enemies. Everyone who is "inside" of an
explosion is out of the game (or the round). The survivor wins. This sounds easy
but beware of chain reactions...


Yellow stones might leave behind on of these extras (select frequency in menu)
	one more bomb to drop
	enhanced range in all directions
	ability to run through walls for a short time
	run through bombs/dynamite for a short time
	you are slower
	the others are slower
	all are slower
	new dynamite is randomly placed


The game is a multi player only game for 2-4 (human) players. The first two
players use a joystick, the others use the keyboard.

Menu: Try that yourself, it is easy (use joystick in port1).

A special feature is the TWIN mode. Both of the two players have to control
two persons on screen. Joystick in port0 controls blue and green, port1
controls the red and the purple. You win if your opponent is completely
blown away.


Control:
	blue:	joystick in port0
	red:	joystick in port1
	green:	<s>=up, <z>=left, <x>=down, <c>=right, left <shift>=fire
	purple:	(numeric pad) <5>=up, <1>=left, <2>=down, <3>=right
		right <shift>=fire



BOOM was written in C++ and Assembler. Like in all my programs it is very
good optimized for length, memory usage and speed.

@node Installation

BOOM should run on every Amigas with an AGA (or AA) chip set. BOOM works
perfectly with 1MB or more.
You have to run SetPatch in front of BOOM (normaly done in startup-seq.).


To install BOOM to your harddisk, just drag the directory icon of "BOOM" onto
your harddisk icon.

BOOM uses no sound. If you really need computer music while playing, run a
program like SmartPlay (@ Peter Hjelt) in the background. This should work
fine.

@node Bugs

If you have problems with BOOM check if
· you have an AGA Amiga (A1200, A4000, CD32).
· you have enough free memory.
· the BOOM file is not corrupted by a disk error.
· SetPatch was run (BOOM needs it to detect the AGA chips).

Send a detailed report of what happened, your hardware configuration, background
tasks, ....

@node Projects

Of course BOOM is not my first game for Amiga. They are all available in
Aminet and on the Digital Nightmares homepage:
http://www.Informatik.Uni-Oldenburg.de/~miha

 Pairs: High resolution fast think combination game. Connect pairs of blocks
        in a time limit. (256 colors, Top8 highscore, 1 player)
        ATTENTION: This game needs Multiscan:Productivity, DblPAL or DblNTSC!
        Aminet: game/think

 Tätris: Another Tetris clone with a two player mode, sampled speech and much
         more. (128 colors, Top20 highscore, 1 or 2 players, sampled speech)

 AmiCross: A "Mario's PiCross" (GameBoy) clone. Use your logic to puzzle
           pictures out of numbers. (german texts)
           Aminet: game/think


All mentioned programs need at least an Amiga1200 and do not have problems
with fast ram.
