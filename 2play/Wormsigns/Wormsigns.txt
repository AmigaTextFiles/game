		Hello!


	This is Wormsigns30-12 version 1.0 Beta by ... PROXIMA !

		(You remember, CardGame !?)

	We must do a lot of things.... but start to play with this !


	Note: i had speed up the game by handling only five pixels
	on nine for each player. This makes the game faster, but
	the collision test seems to be affected.
	I'll correct that, don't worry ! ;-)
	The frogs for the team selection doesn't seems to be very
	design. But i'm just the programmer... We will have some
	animated discutions in the group !
	
	Note2: I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, for the joystick doubler !
	i made the routines, but i had not tested them ! 
	So if they doesn't work, you'll be limitated to only
	eight players. 

	Note3: The music isn't possible, outside the menus, because
	amos doesn't like sounds+musics, so i try to avoid that.


					The programmer.



NB: As i sayed it on the presentation, since the game is not finished,
we have no time for the greetings ! But i'm sure this won't worry you ! ;-)
The only thing you must remember is the name "PROXIMA".




So so so... let me wishing you a good game !


(Will you test if i made a test for the 847 games limitation ??? ;-) 
you'll never know if you don't try !)
