   SHAREWARE VERSION NOTES

   This is the shareware version of @{b}Viper@{ub} which has only three players active
   instead of six.  Also, the tournament program will not save your stats
   although you can use it completely.  These notes supercede any other mention
   of these features throughout this documentation.  To get the full version,
   see the registration info.  As an added bonus for registering, you will
   get a HAM8 title picture.

## ************************************************************************
##   INTRODUCTION
## ************************************************************************
@node intro "Introduction"

   @{b}Viper@{ub} is a snake game, but is not just another snake game.  The most
impressive feature is that it allows you to steer in any direction (at any
angle).  It also allows up to six computer or human controlled players.
Give it a try, I think you'll like it.

   The idea for @{b}Viper@{ub} came from a shareware game called Dune III 
(which has nothing to do with the commercial games Dune I and Dune II).
Unfortunately, Dune III doesn't like NTSC nor the AGA chipset, runs in low
resolution, and doesn't multitask.  Hence the interest in writing an AGA
version which solves the before mentioned problems.

   @{b}Viper@{ub} runs in high resolution (non-interlaced) overscan mode, 
704 x 467, with 128 colours.  Hence it is AGA only.  If enough people ask
for an ECS version, one may be made.  Most importantly Viper will run from
the Workbench and multitask; it is completely OS friendly.

   Other features include a very extensive tournament/statistics program
that opens a window on Workbench and runs the game from there.

   The game was written completely with SAS/C 6.51 on an A4000/030 and A1200.

@endnode


## ************************************************************************
##   SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
## ************************************************************************
@node require "System Requirements"

   @{b}Viper@{ub} requires an AGA computer, approximately 700K of hard drive
space and approximately 1.1 megs of chip/any ram.  It is recommended that the
game be run from Workbench (icon or cli) because this will enable a
non-interlaced display.  If Workbench is not loaded, then the display will be
interlaced.

   PLEASE NOTE: The registered version can only be run from a hard disk.  But
                the shareware version may be run from a floppy.

   @{b}Viper@{ub} also requires Workbench 3.0 installed on your hard drive.
The tournament program uses the helvetica fonts that come with Workbench 3.0.
Make sure the helvetica fonts are in your FONTS: path.

   The installation script uses the Commodore Installer which is not
included in the installation.  It is assumed that you have LhA.  The program
also uses the freely distributable iff.library (version 23.2) by Christian
Weber which is included.

@endnode


## ************************************************************************
##   INSTALLATION
## ************************************************************************
@node install "Installation"

   The shareware version needs only to install the iff.library to LIBS:.  A
short Installer script is supplied here to do this.

   The registered version of @{b}Viper@{ub} has a hard drive script which will
install @{b}Viper@{ub} to the directory of your choice.  Just double click on the
disk icon and then double click on the HDInstall.

   There are two icons included, one is for a regular 4 colour Workbench
and the other which conforms to Magic Workbench.

   The graphics files are standard iff ILBM graphics and the sound files are
standard iff 8SVX sounds.  You may change these if you wish, but beware that
some of the graphics line up precisely and sounds must be of even length.

## ************************************************************************
##   VIPER DOCS
## ************************************************************************
@node docs "Viper Docs"

   When you first start @{b}Viper@{ub} you will see the title screen and after a few
seconds, the main menu will come up.  At the top is a keyboard which shows
you which keys control which players.

   Bellow this is a box to set the score to play to.  Valid scores are
from 1 to 80.  Default is 30 which should be about a 10 minute game.

   The six coloured boxes in the middle of the screen are to set the number
and type of players.  They default all to off.  Pressing the mouse button
on one of these buttons causes it to toggle between off/human/computer.
Computer players are represented by a "C" on the button.  It is
relatively easy to figure out.  Just try it.

   At the bottom are three buttons.  Quit does just that.  Start begins a
game with the options set above.  If this is your first time playing, just
press start to try out the game.

   The Tour button will take you to the @{" Tournament " link tournament } section.


There are keyboard shortcuts for each item on the main menu:
   1-6                  toggles players
   Cur up/down          adjusts score to play to
   Esc                  quits
   Space                starts a game
   T                    enters the tournament section


During the game:
   Esc                  cancels the game and returns to menu
   P                    pause/unpause the game

   (the players keys are shown on the menu so you don't
   have to remember them but here they are anyway.)
   `, Tab               red players keys
   Lshift, Z            yellow players keys
   B, N                 blue players keys
   /, Rshift            green players keys
   Del, Help            purple players keys
   6, 9                 cyan players key (numeric keypad)


   The game is easy to play, just try to stay alive.  Each player has two
keys, one to rotate clockwise and the other to rotate counter-clockwise.

   Players appear one at a time in a random location.  As players die, the
game speeds up.  The last player alive may continue to try and thread holes
for points until they die.

   The two coloured bars on the right side of the screen tell you the order
in which players die (left bar), and the approximate number of wins for each
player (right bar).  If two or more players die at the same time the death
bar will split and show all colours of the players that died at the same time.


   The only thing left to explain is the scoring system.  When a player dies,
all players that are alive get a point.  Two or sometimes even three
players die at the same time.  In this case none of them get any points but
all other players get two or three points respectively.  You also get a point
for threading a hole.  This becomes everyone's strategy for winning the
game.

   The winner is the first person to reach the set score to win on the menu
screen.  If two people are tied, a bonus round is played with all players
active.  So watch out, someone else might sneak up and win!


   That's all.  It's pretty easy to learn.  Please send @{" us " link contact } your comments.
If you like it and continue to play it, you are asked to @{" register " link register } for 
the full game.

## ************************************************************************
##   TOURNAMENT DOCS
## ************************************************************************
@node tournament "Tournament Docs"

   The tournament section is accessed by pressing the tournament button
from the main menu.

   A file requestor will open up asking you to select the tournament you
wish to continue.  If you wish to start a new tournament just enter a name
that doesn't already exist and it will be created.

   After entering a tournament you will see a list on the left side of the
window which is where you enter the names of the players you want in the
tournament.  To add a player, click "add" and enter the name and press
enter.  To delete a player, select him/her and press "del".  A requestor
comes up asking if you are sure you want to delete a player.  Once
deleted, the stats are lost for that player.  You can rename a player by
selecting him/her and then changing their name bellow.

   On the right are six buttons for each of the six positions on the keyboard.
These will default to the last game you played unless this is your first
game.  To set a player to a specific spot, select him/her and then press on
the button where he/she wants to play.  Do the same for as many people as
you want in the current game and press start to begin.

   The score of the game will be to that of the menu screen.

   After playing a game the tournament is automatically saved.  You can press
the "Statistics" button to view the overall stats for the players.  On this
screen is a summary of:
   Games played (GP)
   Wins (W)
   Points (P)
   Average points per game (AVG)
   Winning percentage (WP)
   Lowest score (LO)
   Highest score (HI)
for each player as well as the total number of games played in the tournament.

   For each tournament there are three files.  The default directory is the
"Tours/" directory within the @{b}Viper@{ub} directory.  The three files are:
   {tourname}.dat - binary of tournament data for program.
   {tourname}.his - history text file of scores for every game.
   {tourname}.sum - summary text file that looks exactly like statistics screen.


   If you want to get rid of a tournament, just delete the three files for it.

   To quit the tournament play just close the window and you will return the
the @{b}Viper@{ub} menu where you may either quit or continue to play!

## ************************************************************************
##   GETMODEID
## ************************************************************************
@node getmodeid "GetModeID program"

   The included program "GetModeID" will display a screen mode requester
from which you can choose a screen mode.  The program will then print out
what tooltype is needed to run the game in that screen mode.  Note that
this is only nessesary if you do not like the mode the game chooses to run
in.  You should choose a mode which is at approximately 704x467.  If not
then you will not be able to see the entire screen.

   Example screen modes             Tooltype

   DblNTSC Hires No Flicker         MODEID=99004
   DblPAL Hires No Flicker          MODEID=a9004
   NTSC Hires Lace                  MODEID=19004
   PAL Hires Lace                   MODEID=29004

@endnode


## ************************************************************************
##   OUT OF MEMORY
## ************************************************************************
@node outofmem "Out of Memory"

   You've probably run out of memory.  @{b}Viper@{ub} requires approximately 1.1 megs
of memory.  If you don't have that much memory free, then start quiting
programs, closing windows and deleting commodities.  @{b}Viper@{ub} will run on a 
standard 2 meg A1200 with Workbench loaded, you should not be required to boot 
no startup.

   If freeing more memory does not solve the problem, then make sure that
all the files are present and in their correct directories.  See @{" file list " link files}.

@endnode


## ************************************************************************
##   UNKNOWN SCREEN MODE
## ************************************************************************
@node modeid "Unknown screen mode"

   The program failed to find a the required screen mode.  This may be due to
the lack of a particular monitor driver in your devs/monitors directory.
The program tries to find the best mode for the game that is available.  If
this should not work, you should force a screen mode by using the @{" GetModeID " link getmodeid} 
program.

@endnode


## ************************************************************************
##   PROGRAM CRASH
## ************************************************************************
@node crash "Program Crashed"

   If the program crashed, then obviously something serious happened.
@{b}Viper@{ub} was written to be as stable as possible running on a multi-tasking
Workbench, however it is not perfect.  If the game does crash it will
probably be because it ran out of memory and couldn't recover.  If you
suspect this to be the case then try freeing a little more memory and running
the game again.

   If you had plenty of memory and the program still crashed then something
else caused the problem.  Check to make sure you have all the needed files 
in the correct directories.  See @{" file list " link files}.

   Regardless of whether you solve the problem or not, please still send
a @{" bug report " link bugs}.

## ************************************************************************
##   OVERSCAN SCREEN
## ************************************************************************
@node overscan "Overscan Screen"

   @{b}Viper@{ub} requires an overscan screen of 704x467.  If your monitor or
monitor driver cannot produce such a large display then you won't get a lot
out of this game.  Those with a Commodore 1942 or compatible monitor and a
NTSC/PAL monitor driver should have no problems at all.

   If you ran @{b}Viper@{ub} and it chose a screen mode which does not give you
a full view then you may have to choose a suitable screen mode yourself.
See @{" GetModeID " link getmodeid}.

@endnode


## ************************************************************************
##   ENFORCER HIT
## ************************************************************************
@node enforcer "Enforcer hit"

   If you found an enforcer hit then we would definitely like to hear from
you.  Please send us a copy of the enforcer output, a full description of 
your computer configuration, type, and exactly what you were doing and what 
happened when this hit occurred to: @{" Contact Addresses " link contact}.

   We are aware that @{b}Viper@{ub} causes a single enforcer hit (illegal long read)
while it is loading during the intro screen.  However, neither of us have an
MMU equiped computer nor do we have access to one.  Unless someone offers to
run a debug version of @{b}Viper@{ub} then the illegal read cannot be fixed since
we don't know what is causing it.

@endnode


## ************************************************************************
##   DISPLAY BREAKDOWN
## ************************************************************************
@node display "Display Breakdown"

   If your display does funny things like blanking and switching from 31kHz
to 15kHz then you're low on memory, and/or your memory is badly fragmented.
I'm not sure if this can be fixed, at the moment I don't know what causes
it.  The breakdown can be avoided/fixed by making sure there is enough 
unfragmented memory available (ie. more than approximately 100k of chip)
after the program is loaded.

@endnode


## ************************************************************************
##   BUG REPORTS
## ************************************************************************
@node bugs "Bug Reports"

   Found a bug in the program?  We'd like to hear about it.  Please contact
us: @{" Contact Addresses " link contact}.

   In your bug report, include a full description of your computer
configuration, type, and exactly what you were doing and what happened when
this bug occurred.  This is important, the more information we have, the
faster we can fix the bug.

   If you can't find any bugs, congratulations!  We would still like to
hear from you though.  Comments and suggestions for future versions are
welcome.
