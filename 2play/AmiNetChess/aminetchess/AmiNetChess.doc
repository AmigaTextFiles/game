AmiNetChess (c) 2000 by Matthias Böcker and Ingo Musquinier.

AmiNetChess is a Chessprogram for 2 Players, which can and should be played
over the net.

This version should be considered as an early beta version, so use it at
your own risk.

The design of the figures was inspired by VChess © 1996 by Uwe Zedtler.

General
=======
ANC is not complete ATM, there are a few things missing.  Mainly a check
for stalemate and a check for checkmate is missing, so you will not be
informed if the game is over ATM.  This will change in the future.

           connect the given domain/ip immediately.

Playing...
==========
To move your figures just click the figure you want to move once and then
click the field where you want to move the figure to.  If ANC doesn't move
the figure to this filed it is most likely not allowed to move the figure
to this field.  There are 2 lamps which indicate who has to make a move and
who not.  They are on top of the window alongside of your username.  Red
means you have to wait, green means you have to move a figure.  There are 2
more lamps at the bottom of the field.  They indicate if your king is in
check or not.  If the left lamp is yellow the king of the player on the
left side (usually the player with white figures) is in danger.  The right
lamp indicates the same but for the right player (usually with black
figures).
