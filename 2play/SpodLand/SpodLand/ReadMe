                      -------------------
The First Spit-um-up!

SpodLand is my first game (proper game, anyway) and is no where near as
good as SpodRacer, but I Decided to upload it anyway.

I don't like it, but many people do!

all instructions are ingame.



don't forget- you can EMail me (this game predates my modem, which is
a recent addition to my hardware!)

it is full of spelling mistakes!



To Register (if you want to):

Send your name, address and 5 cash to:
	 17 Lansdowne Road
	 Hove
	 E.Sussex
	 BN3 1FE

	Or you can now order by Cheque to A.Crowe

or you can EMail me at

	 andrewcrowe@enterprise.net

Have Fun!




PS.

This is a message to all artists/musitions/coders who want to be a part
of a new game I am making- its a Role-Playing game like Secret of Mana
on the SNES, and I need help.
If you can help me then contact me with mail or EMail.
