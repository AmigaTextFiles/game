                       Sheep
                By PAILING PRODUCTIONS



This game was ported from the spectrum ( how did you guess !! )

You have to control you dog (D) with the cursor keys and get the sheep (*)
into their pen in as few moves as possible.
Beware - If you go too near the sheep they will scatter and may jump over
their pen.


This game is public domain - copy and distribute it as you wish.

Enjoy !?!?
