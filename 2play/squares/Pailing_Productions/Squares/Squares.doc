Squares V1
By Pailing Productions
Released 1997


How To Play
---------------

The game is based on O+X s. The idea is to make a line of 3 squares
of the same colour horizontally or vertically. You do this by clicking
on a square with the mouse to change it's colour. There are 3 colours and 
they cycle round. If you make a line (or 2) then you get 1 or 2 points. The
winner is the first to ten points.
Pressing the right mouse button will quit the game.
