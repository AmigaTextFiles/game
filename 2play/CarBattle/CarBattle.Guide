to me, you can invite a few mates round, break open the beers and blast
each other to your hearts' content. 

Features:

@{b}--> @{ub}Up to five players at once!
@{b}--> @{ub}Support for a parallel port 4-player adaptor (tested OK)
@{b}--> @{ub}Collect Powerups and blast the other players!
@{b}--> @{ub}Full @{"PROPER stereo sound!" link Sound}
@{b}--> @{ub}Fast fun blasting action!
@{b}--> @{ub}Built in @{"Joystick Tester!" link Joytest}
@{b}--> @{ub}Avoid the nasty gas cloud!
@{b}--> @{ub}Floppy Disk Installation Script that actually works!
@{b}--> @{ub}Blast your mates to a pulp! (Did I mention that?)

Well, I hope you enjoy this game. It was quite good fun to make, and (a bit
of a first for me!!) fun to play as well.

@node Running "How to run the game."

Running the game is very simple. Just run the CarBattle executable. 
Simplicity itself.

If you are really feeling in a good mood, you can copy AMOS.Library to
LIBS: if it is not there already, but the game will cope even if it isn't
as long as it is present as Libs/Amos.Library.
No install script is provided to install to hard disk, so you have to do
it yourself, but come on, if you can't copy a directory across to your
hard drive then you DO have problems!
There is a nice install-to-floppy-disk script, though.


Requirements:
        Amos Library
        The Math#? libraries (supplied with Workbench)
        Workbench & Kickstart v1.3+ (see speed note below)

Speed Chart:

Machine:        Standard A500   Standard A1200  Accelerated A1200

2 Players       ****            ****            ****
3 Players       ***             ****            ****
4 Players       **              ***             ****
5 Players       *               **              ****

**** -> Great, runs at full speed!
***  -> Little bit of slowdown, but still perfectly playable.
**   -> Jerky, but just about playable.
*    -> Yuk, this is not going to impress anybody.

This speed chart refers to the number of players that are alive at any
time. So, if you are playing a 5 player game on an Amiga 500, it will start
off really jerky and horrible, and get faster as players are killed.

I might optimise my code a bit in the next version, but don't bank on it.
After all, how many people are there that match all of the following
criteria?-

1. Own nothing better than an unexpanded Amiga 500.
2. Have a four-player parallel port adaptor.
3. Have five people that want to play this game.
4. Have at least three joysticks.
5. Have a copy of this game (!)

I reckon that you could count them on the fingers of one hand. Probably
with four fingers and a thumb still to spare ;-)

Having said that, even if you do only have an A500, this game is still
great fun for two or three players. If you want to create a bootable disk
for an A500 / A1200 owner who doesn't own a hard disk, then just follow the
instructions lower down on this page. (I know, in the old days when we
didn't have hard drives, we all used to spend most of our time making 
bootable disks, but now we all have lovely fast hard drives, who can be
bothered? So, I have included full floppy install script, including what
files are needed to run the game below, which have been TESTED TO WORK.)


This has been tested on the following systems:

Amiga 1200, Blizzard 1230-IV/50, 10Mb RAM total, hard disk.
Amiga 1200, standard, 2Mb RAM total, floppy disk.
Amiga 500 as emulated by Kick 1.4.

The game works fine under Kick 1.4, so it should work on a real A500.


Installing this to a floppy disk:

1. Execute the Floppy Install Script.

Or, if you don't want to do that, try the following:
                                                      
1. Format a floppy disk (OFS if you want to use it on an A500)
2. Copy CarBattle and CarBattle.Guide onto it.
   (or, preferably, just copy the whole lot)
3. Make a LIBS directory on it, and copy AMOS.Library, and all of the
   maths libraries (copy libs:math#? df0:libs)
4. Make an S directory, and create a file Startup-Sequence in it, 
   containing only the word CarBattle
5. Install a valid bootblock on the disk (install df0:)

Simple, eh? I tried this, and it works.

@node Playing "Playing the game"

Now, here is the interesting bit, how to actually play the game.

Well, load it up, and you will be faced with the cheapo title screen and a
request asking how many players are going to play. Press the relevent
number, and then you will get a request for each player asking which
control method they would like. You can use the keyboard, the joysticks, or
a four-player parallel port adaptor.
If you want to use the keyboard, I would advise the Z-X-T-F-Space
combination, as that does not have any keyboard clashes. The Cursor keys
and enter combination has one clash on Left-Cursor-and-Enter.

You will then see the @{"Options Screen" link Options}. Here you can set
any options that you may want, or redo the controls. Click on the link
above if you want more details.

Now, once that has been dealt with, the game will start. Now, here's the
complicated bit. (Well, maybe not)

Moving up on the joystick will move your car forwards.
Moving down on the joystick will move your car backwards.
Moving left on the joystick will turn your car anticlockwise.
Moving right on the joystick will turn your car clockwise.
And I bet you can't guess what the fire button does.....

Each player controls one car, and has to drive around shooting the other
cars.

The top of the screen is divided into 5 sections horizontally, one for each
player. Each player's section is split into three, as follows:
 ______________________________
|                              | 1. Represents the energy of the player.
|              1               | 2. Which powerup, if any, the player
|______________________________|    is in possession of.
|       |                      | 3. How much of this powerup is remaining.
|   2   |           3          |
|_______|______________________|

Talking of powerups, I think I'll describe them here.@{b}
__________   __________   __________   __________   __________
|        |   |        |   |        |   |  ____  |   |        |
|        |   |        |   | |\/\/| |   | /    \ |   |  3 x   |
|  2 x   |   |  5 x   |   | |  S | |   | |  S | |   |        |
|        |   |        |   | \____/ |   | |/\/\| |   |  pnts  |
|________|   |________|   |________|   |________|   |________|

 2x Power     5x Power      Shield     Inv. Shield   3x Points@{ub}

@{b}2x Power       @{ub}This gives you bullets that do 2x as much damage to
               anything that they hit.
@{b}5x Power       @{ub}Same as above but 5x as much damage.
@{b}Shield         @{ub}Nobody can do any damage to you.
@{b}Inverse Shield @{ub}Like the normal shield, but when you get hit, instead of taking
               energy away from you, it @{b}gives@{ub} you energy instead!
               Not only that, but it @{b}takes@{ub} points away from the person
               that is shooting you!
               This looks like the normal shield, but upside-down.
@{b}3x Points      @{ub}Gives you 3x the amount of points for anything that you do.
               This is also a very nice thing to have, particularly if you have
               it when you are blowing someone up or the round is finishing.


@{b}Points Allocation:@{ub}

This game is all about points, and who can get the most. So, if you want to
get the most out of it, you need to know what points you get for doing
what. So, here is the guide:

@{b}  1@{ub} point for each energy point taken off any other player.
@{b} 50@{ub} points for killing another player, plus all remaining players
    get @{b}10@{ub} points.
@{b}100@{ub} points for winning a round (i.e. killing all other players)
    plus @{b}2@{ub} points for every point of energy you have left.

Don't forget, if you happen to be in possession of a 3x points bonus at the
time, you get three times the points listed above. Think about that.


Watch out for the gas cloud! This is a nasty piece of work that if hit will
take 25 units off your energy. If you have a shield, however, it will not
do anything to you, and if you have an inverse shield, it will GIVE you 25
units of energy.

It is better to be killed by the gas cloud than be killed by another
player, because then nobody gets the 50 points for killing you, and points,
as I said, are what the game is all about! Suicide tactics can help
sometimes after all...

The gas cloud can be turned off. See @{"Options" link options}


At the end of every round, you will see the score for each player for that
round (along with a sarcastic comment about how good or bad each player did
on that round), and the total score for all rounds. The player with the 
highest total score is the winner so far.
The game counts how many rounds have been played, so that you can say
something like "We'll play ten rounds and then see who's the winner". If
you reset the scores, the round counter is also reset, for obvious reasons.

That's all there is to it! Get blasting!

@node Misc "Misc Junk"
@{b}Miscellaneous Junk@{ub}

First, we have the Amiga PD Game Cliche chart.

At Number 3, there are Shoot 'Em Up Construction kit games. Formerly number
one, these games have fortunately become less popular in recent years, the 
main reason being that they are total crap.

At Number 2, there are Amos games which use the supplied BOOM, SHOOT and
BELL commands because the programmers are too lazy to implement their own
sound effects. Irritating, eh?

But at number one, we have that irritating explosion sample. Yes, the one
that almost every PD game ever created has in it somewhere. The one that is
horrendously distorted, and goes Kpppew-ooo-ah!!!! 

You've guessed right. That stupid, horrible, annoying sample is @{b}in this
game@{ub}. I'm really sorry about that, I just HAD to do it. Blow up
another car, and what do you get? Kppppew-ooo-ah!! That stupid sample again!


Also, that lovely AMOS orange colour is used as well.
(Shouldn't that be the horrible AMOS orangey-brown colour?)


This game features proper stereo sound! If you want more information on
this, then see @{"Sound" link Sound}.


This game uses the useful Ercole.lib for AMOS to do the four-player
adaptor tricks. Very handy extension. You can find it on Aminet in the
Dev/Amos directory.


I wasn't going to bother to make this game NTSC compatible, but I thought
"Oh, may as well, just for fun!". So, the game does a bit of messing about
and now the game should be perfectly usable in NTSC. The game does, however
run 20% faster in NTSC mode (but you guys should be used to that by now),
which actually makes the game more fun. Obviously it doesn't make much
difference on "Ridiculously fast mode", is it goes as fast as it damn well
likes in that mode anyway!


If you are really bored, check out my Amiga web page. It should have info
on all of my programming projects, and any other Amiga related stuff you
may find interesting. 
The address is http://www.bath.ac.uk/~ma7jkh/amiga.html  -a bit of a
mouthful, I know, but such is life...


@endnode

@node Future "Future of this game, and known bugs."

Possible things to implement in a future version of the game:

Computer controlled nasties 
(Helicopters, Mini Tanks, Homing Missiles, etc).
Some more powerups? (perhaps)
Better car graphics! (I'm no artist)
Better icons? (Nah, no point, is there?)

Most of these will probably NOT get done, as the code is getting too big
for its boots at the moment, and when I finally get around to implementing
any of this in a few months time, I will probably be totally lost looking
at the code! 
How do commercial game designers cope? (Well, for a start, they probably
structure their code a lot better than I do ;-)

Plus, I am away at university now, and I probably won't be bothered to make
any updates to this game. So you are looking at it in its finished state,
really. Obviously if you find that the game crashes most of the time I'll
try and fix it, but don't expect too much beyond that.


Known Bugs:

If you shoot a bullet upwards and it happens to be passing the energy bars
as they are being redrawn (because another player is shooting you or
something), then they can look a little corrupted. If someone is shot
again, they are redrawn OK. I know why this is, but it is not a major bug,
and it would take a while to fix, so I might just leave it.

When I was testing the game using the interpreter, sometimes, the game 
slows down a bit, especially if there are five players on the screen. When
one of the players are killed, the game speeds up a little.
However, when the game was compiled, the situation improved dramatically.
Also, sometimes when I was testing, AMOS went nuts and started looping all
the samples. Not even the Sam Loop Off command would help. Hopefully this
should not happen to you...

Sometimes, when there is a lot of sound activity, you get sort-of squeaking
noises. Strange, but fun.

If you powerpack the CarBattle executable, then the game crashes on exit.
I've noticed this with anything that I compile. Totally illogical. Shame,
really, as powerpacking it would halve the size of the executable. Maybe it
would be alright with some other cruncher.

@node Sound "Sound in this game..."

This game features @{b}@{u}Proper Stereo Sound!@{ub}@{uu}

Most games use the "Oh, I've got to play a sound, I'll just chuck it on the
nearest sound channel and forget about it" technique. No, not this one!
This game uses proper stereo. If something happens on the left hand side of
the screen, it will come through your sound system panned to the left by
the relevent amount.
Having said that, the "Chuck the sound to the nearest free channel" method
is also available if you prefer that...

It was reasonably simple to implement, so why the hell don't more games do
it? I really hate the "chuck the sound to any old channel" approach, as you
get totally unrealistic stereo presentation of the sound.
Let's hope AHI will change all that. I was going to implement AHI support
into this game, but messing about with device calls is not exactly my
thing. If someone writes an AREXX port for AHI, then I might be interested.


Choosing which sound method you would like:

@{b}STEREO -@{ub} This option gives you proper stereo sound, and is the
         default. It does, however, only give you two channels of stereo
         sound (so you will only be able to hear two things at once).
         If you have a stereo Hi-Fi system, however, I think the stereo
         panning makes up for this.

@{b}MONO   -@{ub} This option gives you the standard chuck-the-sound-to-the
         nearest-available-channel sound that most games seem to love.
         Sounds really annoying through a stereo system, but if you are
         listening to it in mono, this mode will sound better, as it will
         give you four mono channels, as opposed to two stereo ones
         (so you will able to hear four sounds at once).
         If you are listening through a mono TV, select this option.

You can use the keyword "Mono" on the command line if you have a mono TV
and you can't be bothered to set it to mono every time you run it.

See @{"Options" link Options} for more information.

@node Joytest "Joystick Tester"

This game features a built in joystick tester!

To activate it, simply press J on the options menu, or make sure the word 
"Joytest" is on the command line, i.e. when running the game, type 
"CarBattle Joytest" (without the quotes).
When the game is run, you will be presented with the joystick tester.

The first two represent the two joystick ports on your Amiga. Two fire
buttons are supported.
The next two are for a four player adaptor (so this way you can see it it
works or not). 

When you're fed up of playing with your joystick, press Escape, and you
will be returned to the game.

@endnode

@node Options "Game Options & Command Line Arguments."

The options screen looks like this:
@{b}
S = Toggle Stereo Sound
B = Toggle Background
L = Toggle Gas Clouds
G = Change Game Speed
C = Change Controls
J = Use Joystick Tester
@{ub}

@{b}Stereo Sound @{ub}
On  => Two Channel Stereo
Off => Four Channel Mono
On is default. For more info about this, @{"click here" link Sound}.

@{b}Background @{ub}
On  => 3D Effect Background On
Off => 3D Effect Background Off
This does look reasonable, but it can put you off the game a bit, so that
is why it is @{u}off by default@{uu}. Try it on both, see which you prefer. 

@{b}Gas Clouds @{ub}
On  => Gas Clouds On (Take 25 points energy off when hit)
Off => Gas Clouds Off

@{b}Game Speed @{ub}
Ridiculous => Disables timing, so the game plays ridiculously fast! Funny.
Full       => Normal Speed. 50Hz update in PAL, 60Hz update in NTSC.
1/2        => Half normal speed. A bit slow and jerky. Just like a PC!
1/3        => One third of the normal speed. Painfully bad. Yuk.
Full is the default, for obvious reasons.
The speed of ridiculous mode depends on the speed of your CPU. On my 50MHz
68030, this is too damn fast to be playable. I'm not sure I'd like to try
it on an '060...
By the way, it is possible to run into your own bullets in ridiculously
fast mode. Yes, I know, slight inconsistency with the laws of physics, but
due to how the game works, it would be hard to do everything exactly right.


@{b}Change Controls @{ub}

This simply lets you change the controls, i.e. it takes you back to where
it asks "How Many Players? (2-5)", and then lets you change the controls
of each player.

@{b}Use Joystick Tester @{ub}

This takes you to the joystick tester. For more info, see @{"Joystick Tester" link JoyTest}



@{b}@{u}Command Line Arguments@{ub}@{uu}

These can be specified in any order on the command line, as long as they
are there, that is all that counts. They are also not case sensitive.

@{b}Joytest    @{ub}- Runs the @{"joystick tester" link joytest} first thing.
@{b}Mono       @{ub}- Sets @{"4 channel Mono sound" link sound}. (i.e. Stereo OFF)
@{b}Background @{ub}- Sets the background to ON.
@{b}Nogas      @{ub}- Sets the gas clouds OFF.
@{b}Speed0     @{ub}- Sets speed to Ridiculous (might come in handy?!)
@{b}Speed2     @{ub}- Sets speed to half of the normal speed.
