The Game
========
The game is played in a series of arenas, all walled, some relatively
open, and some a maze of tunnels. Each player controls a tank, and starting
in different places, each player has one simple aim:
Destroy every other player on each level - before they do the same to you.
Each player controls a small craft (tank) initially equipped for survival
with only a small cannon and manoeverability.
Sounds simple?
It is - but for a small catch... shots fired from each tank bounce on hitting
walls, so to survive and win you must have a good 'eye' for possible angles
on opposing players ; Guns also have a habit of overheating...

Periodically bonus icons appear: These (usually) give a temporary beneficial
effect - to collect simply run over them with your tank.
The possible effects are:

    EXTRA ENERGY  - An extra 30% energy, up to a maximum of 99%.
    BULLET DAMAGE - Temporarily, all bullets do double damage.
    BULLET LENGTH - Temporarily, bullets travel much further than normal.
    SHIELD        - Player becomes immune to damage for a short period.
    INVISIBILITY  - Hmmm.
    EXTRA SPEED   - Double speed!
EXPLODING BULLETS - Instead of reflecting, bullets break up into 3 fragments,
                    each doing normal bullet damage! 'Unexploded' shots deal
                    double damage.
  NON-REFLECTIVE 
         BULLETS  - The one & only cursed bonus.

Damage is taken when either your craft is hit by an opponents bullet, or
an opponent rams into you. Note that they will not take ramming damage
unless you also attempt to drive over them.
Driving through the centre of a major explosion (a vanquished player
exploding) can cause severe damage to your tank.

Points are scored as follows:
 10 Bullet hitting another tank.
100 Destroying an opponents tank.
125 Surviving until the end of the level.

NOTE: Points are *lost* for ramming into another player - it may help to
destroy them, but you won't score anything!

At the top of the screen is listed each players ENERGY and GUNPOWER in
the following layout:

      PLAYER 1 %ENERGY %GUNPOWER  LEVEL    PLAYER 2 %ENERGY %GUNPOWER
      PLAYER 3 %ENERGY %GUNPOWER   NO.     PLAYER 4 %ENERGY %GUNPOWER

Requirements
============
Tank-Attack runs on all configurations of Amiga with at least 512k of
memory. It requires some 325K of memory to run, and about 90K above that to
decrunch, if crunched with TURBO IMPLODER V4 (on the highest setting).
If you have a 512k Amiga and the program wont load with workbench loaded
then either:

1)Try closing down all windows, bar the one containing the game, and kill
  all other programs in an attempt to free as much memory as possible.
2)Run 'Tank-Attack' from the CLI, by breaking out of the startup-sequence.

For either three or four joysticks to be used, a special '4 player adaptor'
that plugs in the pinter (parallel) port is required. These are
available from most suppliers. A maximum of two people can play on keyboard.

The Main Menu
=============
The main options screen on Tank-Attack:
Pressing ESCAPE quits the program, returning to the Workbench.
Function keys TWO to FOUR start two to four player games respectively.
Number keys 1-4 (above QWERT) toggle control for each player,respectively,
between joystick and keyboard. The two possible keyboard controls
are called 'Keyboard 1 and 2', and can be redefined from the defaults by
pressing 'R'.

Redefining Keys
===============
Press your new keys in the order given on screen to change the key settings.
To leave a key unchanged press ESCAPE.

                        * NOTE : KEYBOARD CLASHES *
Unfortunately, because of Commodore's keyboard design, certain key
combinations will not work. Certain combinations of keys will cause others
to be locked out(!), hence if two people are going to play on keyboard,
check all of the keys respond! eg. Check both players can move diagonally &
fire at the same time.
The default key settings: Q,A,X,C,CONTROL and NUMERIC KEYPAD 8,2,4,6,ENTER
do not suffer from clashes - most dont in fact, but check just the same.

Sorry about that folks, but its unavoidable! The best solution is to use
a 4-player adaptor [ :-) ]...

During the Game
===============
The game continues until all 25 levels have been completed, or the
ESCAPE keys has been pressed to quit the game.

A level can be quit, exploding every surviving player by pressing the
APOSTROPHE key (left of `1` on the main keyboard) and the ASTERISK key
on the NUMERIC KEYPAD at the SAME TIME.
