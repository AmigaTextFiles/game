@node ABOUT "About BattleShipsII"
This game was my hobby for the 8 months, programming it and making 
gfx/sounds for it. 

I have made one earlier release to AmiNet, v0.2. It has grown from
the first source code 20KBs big, into the current 63KB, in about 1800 
commands.

I used to have my "own" FMV format, but when problems (just before this
final release) were reported from mashines with only 1MB chip, then 
converted the FMVs into anim-5 format, reducing it to only the half.

Do play this game as often as you like, make you own catalog with your
language, make your own FMVs (easy :) ), re-draw the GFX. Do what ever you
please with is, BUT DON'T DISTRIBUTE AN ALTERED VERISON.

COPYING

You may remove, change, rename any of the files included in this archive, but
you may NOT distrebute an altered version. Bobbanks and likes are alowed to be

have it, then by all means distribute it, but not in this @{b}archive@{ub}.

You may NOT charge anything for this game other than a normal PD-fee, 
magazines that wish to include this game onto there discs should send me a 
gift (perhaps the magazine, Amiga Format did this.. :) ) or some money.

@node REQUERMENTS "REQUERMENTS"

REQUERMENTS

  * HARDDRIVE to make the FMVs painless...
  * 1MB or chip and
  * 2MB of fast memory
  * 2.0 or above

Well, I haven't any idea on what kind of AMiGA this program will run, it was
compiled with AmosProCompiler with included AMOS.LIBRARY and no error
messages, as a WORKBENCH program, on a Amiga1200(WB3.0) with blizz020, 4MB
and 33MHz-882-FPU. I would like to know if you run it on any other config.
and what the result was, please (e-)mail me with your info (computer,
kickstart etc.).

@node "THE GAME IDEA" "THE GAME IDEA"
THE GAME IDEA

I @{B}STOLE@{UB} the idea from the classical game, with same name. But I have
none, what so ever, idea if I've got the right amunt of ships and/or they are 
in the right size.

The ships are as folowing:

*****         HangarShip (this should be 3+3 or 4+4, not like this one, 5+5)
 *****        (Actualy called: AirPlaneCarrier)

******        BattleShip (could be 5 squares long)

****          Radar1/Radar2 (is correct)

 *            SmallSub (also correct)
***            

 *            BigSub (my idea, notice BattleShips ->II<-)
*****

**            Boat1/Boat2 (correct)

@node PLAYING "PLAYING"
PLAYING

Start the game, and wait. To play, press start game, to change game type,
then hit options. Here its possible to set witch ships to use, playfield
size, set players name and if they are computer, human or not included, 
turn sounds on/off, turn movies on/off and the ability to save the settings.

Playing is easy, shoot all around the area when the game says its your turn,
marking it with displaying your players name..

To win, simply destroy all oponents ships.


If you cant make up your mind when you are about to shoot, or anything
else, then place atleast ONE mark on the area and type "FIRE ANYWAY"

@node Gift "Giftware"

This program is NOT crippled, so no one needs to crack it and can spread it
as ELiTEwarez, athough this would make it famous.

To support the idea of a uppdate I would like some gifts, prefered money in
US$, DM or SEK, but anything of value will do. Send them to @{"me" link contact_me}.

Read @{"copying" link copy} to get to now what you may and what you may NOT do
with the game.

                       deleted the third stage in the computeplayer and
                       wrote a new one, from scratch (alltough using the 
                       same principals). And voila! It worked after an

@node BUGS "BUGS"
BUGS

 * When placing the ships:
        * If trying to select the same ship from the shiplist, the bob used
          to flash the image is jumping around.
        * Trying to unplace a ship without moving the mouse out of the 8x8
          square it recently were placed in, will fail.
 * Starting the computerplayer in the middle of a game will make it act
   stuppid, when it not is aware of the game past.

Note. These wont be attended to

@node files "File formats"
FILEFORMATS

This section refers on how the files are made.

See Amos(Pro) docs for more info on databanks.

THE FMVs
This has changed since the DEMO versions, this is how the FMVs workes now,
with reduced memory consumtion.

All foregrounds are stored as ANIM-5 format. The problem with these are that
they cant have anysize disierd. So this is what I did, I made an .nfo file for
every single FMV (of animfile) that includes to rows, seperared by a CR, that
informes the game the x and y size of the movie on the ANIM-5 film.

The ANIM-5 cant be less than 192x(any, but not less than 129)

They should fit (the final product) these arguments:
    * Less than 90 frames
    * Anim-5 size is 192x130
    * Movie on ANIM-5 is 130-140x128
    * Are only in 16-color mode. (may work with non-grayscale)

The background in the last sequence is 5 simple 320x256 sized bobs in an 
AmosPro BobBank.

FMV-SOUNDS
Hey, I'm not sure what mod. goes to what anim-5. On request I'll find out.
The mod.'s are simple protracker modules.

SOUNDS
Are simple AmosPro IFF-Sample-bank. On request I'll find out what sounds
does what.
