                          INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

DMS Version
-----------
First of all, you will need to "UN-DMS" the scrabble.dms file
onto a blank floppy disk.
 
Scrabble will run directly from the floppy disk it has been
"Un-DMS'd" onto, so to run from a floppy, all you need to do is
insert the disk into DF0: and turn on your Amiga

You can also install this version to a hard drive, by copying the
following disk files across to a suitable directory on your hard
drive, and following the ASSIGN information mentioned later:-

                  scrabble     FILE
                  gfx          DIR
                  sound        DIR
                  data         DIR  - Only on the Registered 
                                      version

Along with any library/device files you don't have in your system
folders.

LHA Version
-----------
Copy the scrabble.lha file to a suitable directory, and use the
following command to expand it to full size:-

                          lha x scrabble.lha


ASSIGN INFORMATION
------------------
To make scrabble work on a hard drive, you must assign the
directory where you installed it, as follows:-

     ASSIGN scrabble: hd0:games/pd/scrabble
                                ^
                                |
              This is the directory where you installed it.


Also, if you run this game from floppy, you must keep the label
on it as "Scrabble", otherwise you will get system requesters
popping up.

Ok, that's it for the installation text.  Happy Scrabbling!!!
