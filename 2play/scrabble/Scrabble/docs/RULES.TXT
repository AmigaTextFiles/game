                               Rules Of Play



--------------------------------------------------------------
                            Basic Rules of play
--------------------------------------------------------------
Scrabble is a game for 2, 3 or 4 players.  Play consists of
forming interlocking words, crossword fashion, on the scrabble
board, using letter tiles with various score values.

Each player competes for the highest score by using his tiles in
combinations and locations that take best advantage of letter
values and premium squares on the board.



--------------------------------------------------------------
                                To Begin
--------------------------------------------------------------
You are prompted to enter the number of people who are going to
play. (At this time, there is no computer player support)

You simply type the number in using either the numeric keypad or
the number keys at the top of the main keyboard

Next, you are prompted to enter the names of the players.
(NOTE: The names will be translated into UPPER case characters)

Once you have done this, you are presented with the main scrabble
board.  On the right hand side of the screen, you will see the
names you entered, listed down the side.  You will also be
prompted to press a key/mouse button, for each player in turn. 
This part picks a random tile from the tile bag, to see who will
place the first word.  The player who has the first occurrence
of the lowest tile in alphabetical order will go first.

A starting set of racks will now be displayed.



--------------------------------------------------------------
                           Method of Play
--------------------------------------------------------------
The player to go will be prompted, and highlighted in the list.
This player can choose from any of the available icons at the
bottom of the screen.

After click on either word and entering a word, change and
changing at least one tile, challenge and being unsuccessful or
passing; Play can pass onto the next player in rotation.


In the Registered Version, the game will end when either all
players pass three times each in succession, or a player gets all
his tiles out of his rack, and there are no more tiles left in
the tile bag.  In this later state, the other players total score
is reduced by totalling up the values on the tiles they may have
in their racks. A grand total score sheet is displayed and the
winner is declared.

In the Un-Registered Version, the game will end after 15 words
have been placed, or as in the Registered version, whichever is
sooner.




--------------------------------------------------------------
                                Shuffle
--------------------------------------------------------------
Selecting this icon, will randomly shuffle the tiles in the
current players rack for about 5 seconds.  This can sometime draw
your attention to a word you hadn't thought of.

When shuffling is complete, the icon bar is re-displayed and the
player continues his go.  You can select the shuffle icon as many
times as you like.



--------------------------------------------------------------
                                Change
--------------------------------------------------------------
Selecting this icon, will enable the user to place selected tiles
back in the tile bag, and have fresh tiles returned in their
place.  A player can change as many tiles as he likes, but on
completion, play passes to the next player..

To select a tile for changing, simply click the mouse on the
tile, and it will change into a copyright tile.  To deselect a
tile, simply click on it again.

Once you have selected all the tiles you wish to change, click
on the proceed icon beneath the scrabble board, and you will see
you new tiles appear.  Play now passes to the next player.  If
you decide not to change any tiles, click on the cancel icon
beneath the scrabble board, and you go will continue.













--------------------------------------------------------------
                                  Score
--------------------------------------------------------------
Clicking on this icon will display an up to the minute score
sheet, for all players.  The first column under a players name
is the score attained for the word placed on the particular go. 
The second column, is the running total score.  Also, there is
a record of the best word placed during this game, with details
of who placed it and how much it scored.  Finally, there is a
count showing the number of tiles list in the tile bag.
(NOTE: Once this counter reaches zero, players can no longer
change tiles)




--------------------------------------------------------------
                                   Word
--------------------------------------------------------------
This is the main icon in the game.  When you click on this icon,
you will be prompted to enter the word you wish to place on the
board.

NOTE: If you wish to use a BLANK TILE, just type a SPACE where
you want it, ie:

     If your rack was R,T,I,P,blank,R,E

     You would enter the word "PRINTER" thusly "PRI TER"


IF your word uses tiles already on the board, enter these letters
in sequence also. If the letter on the board is a blank, just use
the space key as before.
  
If you make a mistake typing a word in, use the backspace key to
edit it.  If you just press return and don't enter a word, you
will return to the icon bar.


After entering the word and pressing return, you will be asked
to select the start square.  At this point, position the mouse
pointer over the square that the word will start on.  You will
then be prompted to give the direction you wish the word to be
placed.  Click on either the ACROSS or DOWN icons below
the scrabble board.

If after all this, you don't have the tiles to make the word, you
will be informed and returned to the icon selection bar.

If the word you entered wont fit onto the board in the direction
you specified, again, you will be informed, and prompted to pick
a new start square.

If all the above id ok, the tiles will be placed on the board,
and the players score will be updated, and new tiles returned for
the one used.

All tiles placed in any one turn must be placed in one row,
across or down the board.  Diagonals are not accepted.  The tiles
placed must form at least one complete word.  If at the same
time, they touch other tiles in adjacent squares, they must also
form complete words, crossword fashion.  The players scores for
ALL words made in this fashion

Permitted words 
--------------
Any words listed in a standard dictionary are permitted,except
those spelt with an initial capital letter, abbreviations,
prefixes and suffixes and words requiring apostrophes or hyphens.




--------------------------------------------------------------
                                Legend
--------------------------------------------------------------
Clicking on this icon, will display a key for the special
squares, that are on the scrabble board.  Just click the mouse
button again, to return to the board.




--------------------------------------------------------------
                               Challenge
--------------------------------------------------------------
Click on this icon, if YOU think the word placed by the previous
player is invalid, ie, doesn't make a word at all, or is illegal
as described in the Permitted Words section.

If you click on this button, you will be shown 2 new icons at the
bottom of the scrabble board, Invalid and Valid.  You must click
on the appropriate icon.

Clicking on Invalid means, that YOU made an invalid challenge,
and thus loose you turn.  

Clicking on Valid means, that YOU made a valid challenge, and
thus the previous player has his word removed from the board, and
tiles placed back into his rack, Any new tiles received returned
to the tile bag, and his score for the last word set to zero.

Note.  Use with caution, as there is no way back after clicking
on challenge











--------------------------------------------------------------
                                  Pass
--------------------------------------------------------------
Clicking on the Pass icon, means that you wish to give up you
turn in trying to place a word.  Use only if you cannot place a
word.

If all players pass 3 times in succession, the game is ended and
the winner at that point is declared.
