@title "Getting Started"

Okay then, let's get the tedious stuff out of the way first. In this archive,
you should find:

TankWars - a lethal virus that destroys the entire contents of your hard 
drive, or the game itself? You decide.

TankWars.doc and TankWars.guide - this very file (depending on which one
you're reading). Contains comprehensive game instructions and a few feeble
attempts at humour.

Gfx, Sfx, Level, Data and Fonts directories, hopefully with files in them.

I know this all seems pretty pointless, especially if you got it off Aminet, 
but better safe than sorry, eh?

To run this game, you will need:

- An Amiga computer, either real or emulated
- 1M of RAM
- Any version of AmigaOS older than 4.0 (sorry - this game uses the Classic
  Amiga hardware and switches the OS off)
- Half a brain, although a full one is recommended, so you can install and run
  this game
- Some mates (it's a game for 2-5 players, although you'll need a joystick
  adaptor to play with more than three people)

Providing you've got all these, simply copy the contents of the Fonts drawer
to your FONTS: assign on your hard/floppy disk, double click on the nice icon,
and you're ready to go. (Serves up to five people. With no added salt or
sugar.)

@node intro
@title "Introduction"

(Yes, I know it's illogical having the third section called "Introduction",
but I haven't really explained what the game is about yet, so get off my back,
okay?)

Tank Wars is a game about tanks (as you may possibly have gathered). Here's a
quick rundown of its features:

- For two to five players simultaneously
- 25 different levels
- Optional time limit (up to 10 minutes)
- Optional power-ups
- The possibility to play a league (up to 50 matches)
- Player names can be changed
- Load/Save game facility

The game is overhead-viewed and the aim is to kill each other. The last one
standing, surprisingly, wins.

Also there are no computer opponents (my programming skills don't stretch that
far I'm afraid), so if you don't know anyone else, you're stuffed. Basically.
Go and do something else instead.

@endnode

@node menu
@title "The Main Menu: Exclusively revealed"

Okay then, if you've already taken a peek at the game, you'll have already
seen the menu (unless it crashed horribly - see @{"here" link bugs}). You'll no doubt
have noticed that not only has it got quite a lot of confusing-looking text on
it, it's also overwhelmingly red (except for the grey bits). Fear not - I will
now tell you exactly what all those options do.

Players 1-5: These tell you how each player is controlled. Of course, if you
don't have a parallel-port joystick adaptor, you won't be able to use ports
three and four, so turn those off (by pressing either the fire button on the
joystick in port two, the space bar or the right shift key - these buttons
change all the options, by the way). Just turn off what players you don't want
and leave those that you do well alone.

Change Player Names: Clicking on this will reveal a new screen. Press fire
on the name you wish to change and type in whatever the heck you like, but
bear in mind you can only use letters (and there's a limit of 20 characters,
explicit integer fans). These names are then used throughout the game.

Game Type: You can choose either a single match (which is self-explanatory) or
you can opt for a league game instead. A league consists of a certain number
of matches (between 1 and 50), and points are awarded according to how well
a particular player has done in that match. For example, the person out first
is awarded nothing, and in a five player game, the winner will receive a
stonking four points. In four player mode, the winner will get three points
for their troubles, two in three player mode and one with just two players
taking part. It goes without saying that the winner is the player who has the
superior pointage to everyone else at the end of the competition. It is also
possible to save your progress in this mode (see @{"here" link play}).

League Matches: The number of matches you want in your league. Duh.

Powerups: Choose whether you want to be able to collect peculiar little icons
or not. Again, scroll a bit further down for more on this.

Time Limit: You can have no limit at all (in which case you can play until
doomsday), or you can have a limit between 1 and 10 minutes. If you run out
of time in a single match, the winner is the player with the most health
remaining - if two or more players are tied, then, er, it's a tie. In a league
game, much the same applies, except that if two or more players are tied, then
they each get the same number of points.

Level: Choose a level number between 1 and 25, excitingly enough, or you could
go for the random approach. In a single match, you just play that level, but
in a league - unless you chose random - you play the levels starting from the
one you chose, and you play them in order from that point. If you reach 25 in
that time, it goes back to level 1. Random gives you a random level for each
match. Interestingly.

Start New Game: Blows up your computer. Avoid this option.

Load Old Game: Loads in a previously-saved league, if one exists. It's worth
pointing out all your options are saved with this file, including player
names, so you don't have to set them all again.

Quit: No - don't do it. It's not worth it. But if you do feel like ending it
all, then go right ahead and select this option.

@endnode

@node play
@title "Actually playing the game"

Okay then. You've set the number of players, chosen the level, and hit the
Start New Game option. "What's that monstrosity on the screen?" you may well
be asking at this point. That'll be up to five peculiarly-coloured tanks then,
along with some of the worst map graphics ever in the entire history of the
universe. But forget that for a moment, here's a helpful guide to what
everything does.

The colours of the tanks first: Player 1 is blue, 2 is yellow, 3 is red, 4 is
purple and 5 is green. Not much else to say here.

The controls for four of the five tanks are obvious: the usual joystick
directions, and fire to, well, fire. For player three it's a bit more awkward,
though - the arrow keys move in the usual directions, and either space or
the shift keys (depending on what you prefer) fire. Now here's the awkward 
bit; due to the A1200's infamous cheap keyboards, certain key combinations 
don't work properly - for example, pressing space and down at the same time 
will result in you either firing or moving, but not both. In this case, you 
should stick to the shift keys. It should be fine on other Amigas, but don't
take my word for it.

Phew, that was terribly tedious. Right, on to those horrific-looking green
blocks now. Incredibly, they are in fact walls. As are those grey borders.
For the hard of understanding (i.e. complete retards), you cannot move through
these, or shoot through them. Also if there is a gap only one square big,
you're not gonna fit through there, I'm afraid. Although you can fire through
them.

And talking of firing: you start with an uninspiring-looking light blue blob,
which is activated via cunning use of the fire button. If it hits, your
hapless victim loses a health point. If a tank loses all its health, then it's
time to visit Tank Heaven. The last tank remaining wins the match, everyone
else challenges him/her to a rematch, and this loop continues until either
a) you get bored; b) you finish your league; or c) you've all been playing
for so long you die from dehydration and/or exhaustion. Maybe.

But hey, I'm getting ahead of myself here. We haven't even discussed the
power-ups yet, and the weird (and occasionally wonderful) effects they have.
So, er, let's go:

The +10, +25, -5 and -10 icons give you that amount of health. (You can have
a maximum of 100.) You don't need me to tell you what ones to avoid.

The +B and -B icons add and take away a bullet from you respectively. You can
only actually have either one or two bullets at a time though, so don't expect
to be able to fire 618 bullets at once.

And finally, the little blue blobs. These are probably the most signifcant
power-ups you will come across. Pick one up and you will receive the
appropriate weapon. The dark blue bullet is more powerful as it takes off two
health points a shot; the light blue only manages one. They don't turn up as
often as the others though, so grab one while stocks last.

Of course, all this only applies if you have turned power-ups on in the menu.
Also up to four can appear at once, at random places on the level. If no-one
picks one up after ten seconds, it magically disappears, soon to be replaced
by another one elsewhere.

Right, I think that's pretty much the whole thing covered. The only thing that
really needs mentioning is the league option's save game system. After every
match you'll be asked if you want to save your progress. Cunningly, pressing
Y on the keyboard saves the game, while N doesn't. Exciting stuff, I'm sure
you'll agree.

However, in a dramatic twist, you can only have one game saved at a time. If
you want to store more than one, it would be a good idea to rename the file
(it's called "savegame" and resides in the Data directory). Otherwise the file
will be lost forever next time you save. And that would be a terrible shame.

@node bugs
@title "Bugs"

As far as I know, this game is a bug-free zone. However, if you do have 
trouble getting the game to work: did you install the fonts? Is the stack size
big enough? Do you have enough free memory? Does it get upset when it comes
across certain patches and hacks? Or maybe it's just not compatible with your
system.

You shouldn't really have any problems, but let me know if you do and I'll
point and laugh at you - er, I mean I'll do my very best to solve them. Yes.

Click @{"here" link credits} if you wish to contact me. For whatever reason.

@endnode

@node credits
@title "Credits"

Well, I (Graham Humphrey) did everything, more or less. I borrowed the sound
effects from various PD games, and I got the tank from some sort of sprite
collection-type thing. But I did painstakingly code the entire thing. All
1,804 lines of it.

Feedback (good or bad), bug reports, suggestions, decent artists (see below),
death threats and general hate mail to: grahamhumphre14@hotmail.com

By the way, if you do play this game, then please do leave some sort of
feedback. After all, how would you feel if you spent ages programming
something and seemingly everyone ignores it? Well then.

Boring technical stuff now: Tank Wars was programmed on an A1200 with an
Apollo 68040/33 accelerator, 34M of RAM in total, a 2.1G IDE hard drive, an
external floppy drive, a Squirrel SCSI interface with CD-ROM drive, and OS 3.

The software used to develop this game:

Blitz Basic 2.1 - for programming, obviously
Personal Paint 7.1b - believe it or not, for the graphics
Shapes Manager - when it didn't crash on me, this put all those graphics into
                 the shape (.shp) files
RED Map Editor 2.5 - for drawing the levels
Directory Opus 4.15 - for general file-organising and stuff
BareED - used to write this very file

I'd actually be interested in finding out what set-ups the game works on. As
far as I know it should work from OS1.2 onwards, right up to an 060/PPC/GFX
card, with OS3.9. Let me know what set-up you use to get the game working (or
not, as the case may be).

@endnode

@node history
@title "Tedious self-indulgent rubbish (Perfect for insomniacs)"

Right then. Tank Wars (for those interested in such things) was developed
between 27th April and 17th May 2006. I wrote it because my other project,
Annihilation (more on this @{"here" link plugs}), had seemingly stalled because of a
complete lack of interest from anyone, with a couple of honourable exceptions.
So I decided to write something to stop me getting rusty, and this is the
result. The code isn't brilliantly written, and it's about as original as an
episode of EastEnders, but it works, and it is quite good fun if you can find
people willing to play it. It's also quite nice to get a game completely
finished in the space of a few weeks, rather than something that drags on
for months on end. Who knows what I'll come up with next? I certainly don't.

@endnode

@node plugs
@title "Shameless plugs"

Here's a list of the other stuff I've done so far: (these are all on Aminet, 
by the way)

Blobz (game/misc) - the first game I ever wrote, and quite frankly it shows.
The code is so inefficient and wastes so much memory that you'd be forgiven
for thinking Microsoft wrote it. You control a blue blob, who has to collect
all the gems from each overhead-viewed level, and get to the exit before the
time runs out, all the while avoiding the various evil blobs wandering around
the level (of which there are sixty). It also contains some of the worst level
design known to mankind (you'll have to check it out for yourself if you're
curious). Still, if you want to play it, get v1.3 as it doesn't have any bugs
to speak of. Requires 2M of RAM to run, and a 68030 processor to run at a
playable speed.

Diamond Kingdoms (game/demo) - it's a flip-screen platformer, you'll be
delighted to hear. Although I finished this in January 2005, this still isn't
released (check the readme to find out why, I can't be bothered to tell you
here) but you can play a one-level demo of it here. The code is better-
organised this time around, but it could still be faster. Requires 1M of RAM.

Annihilation (game/demo) - hello, it's the big one. This is a horizontally-
scrolling shoot-em-up that I've been working on since May 2005. You can check
out an early demo on Aminet, and then you'll know why I'm so desperate for
artists, for the enemy sprites and the map tiles. So if anyone would be even
vaguely interested in helping out, for God's sake e-mail me. Otherwise I won't
finish it. Ever. (Also I need playtesters as well, drop me a line if you're
interested.) Requires an AGA Amiga.

Future projects: I've no idea, except possibly a turn-based four-player
strategy game (like Space Crusade) at some point. Maybe.

Right, that's it, you can leave now. You'll be relieved to hear. Have fun -
