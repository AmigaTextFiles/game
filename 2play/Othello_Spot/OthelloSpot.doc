Othello Spot v1.3 by Derek James
********************************

Othello.Spot is a small arexx script for Spot that lets you play the old two player
board game favourite of the same name via echo mail. It's a good thinking game
and a little more involved than anything else available. Enjoy.

The game requires a registered Spot and rexxmast must be running on your
system.

Disclaimer
**********

I didn't want to bother with this as it's just an arexx script after all. Just
in case something nasty happens I must point out that you use this script
entirely at your own risk. It has been tested on a 1200, 1200 '030', and a 4000
and works fine. If you distribute it please only distribute the original
archive with these docs intact.

Installation
************

Just put the script with the rest of your Spot arexx scripts, probably in
REXX:Spot/.

How to play Othello Spot
************************

Ok, this version is played on an 8x8 board and follows all the rules of the
board game. The aim of the game is to cover as much of the board as possible
with your counters at the expense of your opponent. Moves are made in turn
and to make a move you place your counter on the board in such a way that it
'sandwiches' one or more of your opponents pieces between itself and another of
your counters. All the 'sandwiched' pieces then change to become your pieces.
This can happen in several directions at once and the game continues until the
board is full or you (or your opponent) cannot make a legal move. The winner is
then the one with the most counters on the board. Easy huh?

Here's an example:-

This is the start position...

 > * Othello Spot
 >   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
 >1 |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
 >2 |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
 >3 |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
 >4 |_|_|_|X|O|_|_|_|
 >5 |_|_|_|O|X|_|_|_|
 >6 |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
 >7 |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
 >8 |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
 >

Let's assume you choose to be X and place your counter at position 5,3. (Read
all co-ordinates as along,down). The board would then look like this...

 > * Othello Spot
 >   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
 >1 |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
 >2 |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
 >3 |_|_|_|_|X|_|_|_|
 >4 |_|_|_|X|X|_|_|_|
 >5 |_|_|_|O|X|_|_|_|
 >6 |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
 >7 |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
 >8 |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
 >

Got the idea? Good. It will then be O's turn of course.

Ok, playing Othello Spot is a breeze, playing it well like any good board game
is another matter entirely!

To start a new game find a message from your intended opponent and run the
script via your arexx menu in Spot. Follow the on screen prompts and click Yes
to start a new game.

You will then be shown the start position in a requester. Decide your move and
remember the co-ordinates before clicking on OK to cancel the requester.

The game will ask you if you are O or X. It will then ask you for the
position on the board you would like to move to by first asking for a column
number and then a row number. i.e 8,1 is top right, 8,8 is bottom right and so
on.

The game automatically scans the board and updates all your opponents pieces
that are affected by your move. It can cope with ALL the eventualities of a
move that may affect your opponents pieces in several directions! Good eh?

The game writes the last move into the message so your opponent can see where
you moved to as the board will look very different when they next see it. This
also acts as a reminder whether you are X or O in case you are forgetfull!

It also writes the current score in the message so you can see who's winning
(or who's won!).

You will then be given the option to edit the message in case you want to add
your own comments and the message will be written into the message base with
the export flag set. The original message will be marked as replied.

BTW, a move is only legal if it affects at least one of your opponents pieces.
You will be told if your move is illegal and given the option to try again or
quit.(The quit option is there because at the end of a game it may be
impossible to make a legal move!)

If you quit out because you can't make a legal move you will be asked if it is
the end of the game. If you answer Yes then you will be told if you have won or
lost!

If any of that isn't clear(?) I'd suggest you play some dummy games against
yourself till you get the hang of it.

To do
*****

Well, there's not a lot that can be done. One problem I've noticed is that the 
start of game requester looks crap if you use a proportional screen font. 
There's no way round this unless I was to start the game by writing a dummy 
message to the message base. My playtesters didn't want this so you're stuck 
with it unless you want to change it yourself!

Note
****

You shouldn't need to change anything at all in the script. It uses your T:
assign for it's temporary files and deletes them when it's finished.
If you do fiddle about watch out for infinite loops as the updating logic was a
pig to get right. Hint, if you've changed anything and the script doesn't seem
to be working anymore it's probably in an infinite loop. You'll have to reset!

Thanks must go to the guys at Workbench2 BBS who provided their services as
playtesters and nagged me to finish it when I was stuck. Cheers to Stephen Bell
and Ian Forest especially!

Also Steven Pearson is due some thanks for his Connect 4 Spot script which
provided the bare bones for this and gave me the original idea.
