Development and Testing
-----------------------

GridLock was originally developed on an Amiga 1000 with 1.5 Meg, beginning
in October of 1990.  It is now being developed on an Amiga 3000T/060-50MHz
with 60 Meg.

GridLock has been tested on an A3000T/16 Meg FAST/2 Meg CHIP, A3000T/8 Meg
FAST/1 Meg CHIP memory and an A1000 1.5Meg memory.

GridLock has been tested under:
   Kickstart version 40.68 , Workbench version 40.42
   Kickstart version 37.175, Workbench version 38.12
   Kickstart version 34.5, Workbench version 34.32

GridLock has been modem tested with a ZyXEL U-1496E+.

GridLock has been tested with the MultiFace-III Multi-I/O card.

GridLock has been tested with AmiTCP/TCP: (v4.3) using a Hydra Ethernet
connection between two A3000T/25MHz.

GridLock has been tested with AmiTCP/TCP: (v4.3) on a 115200 baud
serial.device network between an A3000T/25MHz and an A3000/25MHz.

@node TCP "For AmiTCP/TCP:"

For AmiTCP/TCP:
---------------

AmiTCP must be running before GridLock is run.  GridLock requires the
following line to be added to    AmiTCP:db/services

                         gridlock        2900/tcp

2900 is the Port number that GridLock will use when initiating a network
connection.  It is recommended that you use this number, unless it is in
conflict with your system setup.  GridLock will use the 'case sensitive'
alias as shown, in reference to this Port.  It MUST appear in ALL lower
case or you will get a 'Service NOT found' error.

TCP: must be mounted.  This is default for AmiTCP installation.

The following ToolType must be added/edited:

                                DEVICE=TCP

@endnode
@node Connect "Connecting"

Connecting MODEM / NULL-MODEM
-----------------------------

GridLock will detect if a modem is connected, automatically. The message
window at the bottom of the title screen will read MODEM or NULL-MODEM,
accordingly.  If you have a modem connected but it is turned off, the
message window will display NULL-MODEM.

If the default baudrate is not wanted then select the baudrate under the
BAUD menu.  Both computers must have the same baudrate set for play.

@{" For MODEM " link MODEM} use,

   -- One player should select DIAL under the MODEM menu.  This brings up
      a requestor in which the phone number should be entered.  DIAL will
      automatically prepend the defined prefix (ATDT is default).

                                   - OR -

      One player can select a phone number from the PHONE BOOK menu.
      These phone numbers can be stored through the use of ToolTypes.
      See: @{" Configuration " link Config 135}

   -- The other player should select AUTO ANSWER ON under the MODEM menu.
      If this is already set on the modem, it need not be done again.
      AUTO ANSWER ON sends an ATS0=1 command to the modem by default.
      See: @{" Configuration " link Config 30}

      Auto Answer can be turned off by selecting AUTO ANSWER OFF under the
      MODEM menu.


@{" For NULL-MODEM " link NULL} use,

   -- Insure that the NULL-MODEM cable is connected and continue ...



When both games are running at compatible baudrates and connection is
detected, OPPONENT READY will appear on the title screen.

* The game will automatically check that both games are the same version.
If this is not the case, NOT COMPATIBLE VERSION will appear on the title
screen and the game will not continue.
@endnode
@node ConnectTCP "ConnectingTCP"

Connecting AmiTCP/TCP:
----------------------

The message window at the bottom of the title screen will read TCP.

@{" For AmiTCP/TCP: " link TCP} use,

  *** BEFORE running GridLock, the DEVICE=TCP ToolType must be included
      See: @{" For AmiTCP/TCP: " link TCP}


   -- First, one player should select OPEN PORT under the TCP menu.

    * NOTE: AmiTCP/TCP: will wait forever for a connection to this port.
      GridLock has no control over this.  I have provided a script file
      that will allow you to signal the OPEN PORT to ABORT.  Simply click
      on the 'Kill-GridLockPort' icon and it will connect to the GridLock
      Port and send a QUIT command.

   -- Then, the other player should select CONNECT TO HOST under the TCP
      menu.  This brings up a requestor in which the Host Address or Host
      Alias should be entered.  A null entry will abort the CONNECT TO
      HOST.
                                   - OR -

      The other player can select a Host from the HOSTS menu.  These Hosts
      can be defined with ToolTypes.  See: @{" Configuration " link Config 109}


When both games are running at compatible baudrates and connection is
detected, OPPONENT READY will appear on the title screen.

* The game will automatically check that both games are the same version.
If this is not the case, NOT COMPATIBLE VERSION will appear on the title
screen and the game will not continue.
@endnode
@node Start "Starting"

Starting
--------

If OPPONENT READY is displayed on the title screen then connection has been
established and GridLock may begin.

START may be selected from the GAME menu at this time.  When one player
selects START from the GAME menu, both games will begin.

START may also be invoked through the keyboard equivalent 's'.

START is disabled while an opponent is editing or viewing a message or
changing preferences.

@endnode
@node MoveEnergy "Movement and Energy Beams"

Movement and Energy Beams
-------------------------

All game play is controlled by mouse or joystick.  To change the input
device select the GRIDLOCK/PREFERENCES menu at anytime during the game.

  MOUSE: Use the movement controls (the blue arrows with no lines) to
         move your player.  See: GridLock.doc.pic

         Clicking with the left mouse-button activates the selected
         direction.  Holding the mouse button down and positioning the
         mouse pointer over any of the direction arrows will allow repeat
         movements, without having to click the mouse button for each
         movement.

  JOYSTICK: Push the joystick in the direction you wish to move.  Holding
            the joystick in one direction will repeat movement in that
            direction.

  KEYBOARD: Use the cursor keys for the direction you wish to move.
            Holding the key down will repeat movement in that direction.

To the right of the direction controls are the energy beam generators,
these are used to generate the beams in which to trap your opponent.
These beams are not visible to your opponent unless he moves into them.
You can not generate energy beams along the border of the Grid.

  MOUSE: Select these gadgets in the same manner as above.

  JOYSTICK: Press fire and hold it, then push the joystick in the
            direction you wish to generate a low level beam.

  KEYBOARD: Use the number keys to generate low level beams:

                         8 - Up
                         4 - Left
                         6 - Right
                         5 - Down
@endnode
@node Pulser "Opponent Activity Pulser"

Opponent Activity Pulser
------------------------

At the top of the opponent health display is an activity pulser.  This
displays the activity level of your opponent.  It has three different
display methods.  If your opponent is active, this displays a three level
sizing pulse (small/medium/large).  After 9 'time units' of inactivity
this will change to a non-pulse display.  When your opponent enters the
health rejuvenation state (at 14 'time units') this will change to a 2
level pulse (dark/bright), and your opponents position will be displayed
while remaining in this state.
@endnode
@node Health "Health"

Health
------

Moving into an opponent's low-level energy beam will absorb energy from
you (decreasing your health) and will change the low level energy beam to
a high level beam.  This is indicated on the Grid as a brighter beam.
Watch for this, to determine where your opponent is.  The last beam that
your opponent has moved into will flash (on/off) for 15 'time units' or
until another beam is moved into.

Generating a beam where an opponent's beam is already located will also
cause a health decrease.

Health decreases work as follows:

        Move into opponent's low-level beam:            -2 health
        Move into opponent's high-level beam:           -0 health
        Generate beam over opponent's low-level beam:   -4 health +
        Generate beam over opponent's high-level beam:  -6 health +

        See: @{" Disruptions / Inactivity " link Disruptions}
@endnode
@node Rejuvenation "Inactivity / Health Rejuvenation"

Inactivity / Health Rejuvenation
--------------------------------

You may rejuvenate your health by stopping all movement for a period of 14
'time units'.  This will put you in the Rejuvenation state.  Beware that,
while in this state, your Grid position is shown on your opponent's Grid
display.  Health will rejuvenate at a rate of +4 health/'time unit', to a
maximum of 150.  You may exit the Rejuvenation state at any time by
moving.


Health Rejuvenation Overload                     (Registered version only)
----------------------------

Once you reach the maximum health you have 1 'time unit' to move or you
will overload, causing a health decrease of 125 and a reset of the 'time
units' required to enter the Rejuvenation state.

See: @{" Disruptions / Inactivity " link Disruptions}
@endnode
@node Disruptors "Disruptors"

Disruptors
----------

Two types of Disruptors are available.

Timed Disruptor: These devices can be used to cause a timed disruption
                 within the Grid location the Disruptor is placed in.
                 These devices can provide a method of attempting escape
                 when you are trapped within a Grid area -OR- can be used
                 to cause health decrease to an opponent.  Disruption will
                 be delayed by 4 'time units', giving you time to move
                 away from the disruption area.  Only (1) Timed Disruptor
                 may be active at a time.

                 A maximum of (3) are available per game.

Disruptor Trigger: These devices are used to attempt to cause health
                   decrease to an opponent.  A disruption will be
                   triggered if your opponent moves on to a Grid area
                   containing one of these devices.

                   A maximum of (5) are available per game.

  MOUSE: Place a Disruptor device by clicking with the left mouse button,
         in the Timed Disruptor -OR- Disruptor Trigger areas.
         See: GridLock.doc.pic
                                    -OR-

  JOYSTICK/MOUSE: Place a Timed Disruptor by pressing '1' on the keyboard.
       /KEYBOARD  Place a Disruptor Trigger by pressing '2' on the
                  keyboard.


If you are positioned on a Grid location where a Disruption occurs, you
will have a health decrease of 24.
@endnode
@node Disruptions "Disruptions / Inactivity"

Disruptions / Inactivity
------------------------

If you remain inactive, when positioned within a Level-1 Grid Disruption,
Health Rejuvenation does not occur.  Instead, health will decrease as
follows:

        Inactivity Level 0:      1-9 'time units'    -1 health
                   Level 1:    10-13 'time units'    -2 health
                   Level 2:    >= 14 'time units'    -4 health
@endnode
@node Teleport "Teleportation Devices"

Teleportation Devices
---------------------

Generating four low level beams around yourself in one Grid sector will
generate a teleport, which will transport you to a random sector on the
Grid.  Moving into one of these active teleports will have the same
effect.  These can be used to get you out of a tight spot, or to put you
into one.  You can not enter an opponent's teleport.  A teleport is not
generated if you are not positioned inside the enclosed Grid sector when
you generate the fourth low level energy beam.  All four beams must be
LOW LEVEL to generate a teleport.

MOUSE: Holding the left mouse button down and circling over the four
       energy beam direction arrows provides a quick way to generate a
       teleport.

JOYSTICK: Pressing the fire button and circling the four directions with
          the joystick provides a quick way to generate a teleport.


Teleport Generation Failures                     (Registered version only)
----------------------------
These can cause random destruction of Energy Beams in a stream starting
from the failed teleport.

If this occurs when you attempt to generate a Teleport you will have a
health decrease of 12.
@endnode
@node Phimp "Phimping"

Phimping
--------

Phimping occurs when both players are positioned within the same Grid
location, at the same time.  This causes a disruption in the Grid and
players' energies.  This is shown by flashing you and your opponent within
the Grid location.  Phimping will continue as long as both players remain
within this Grid location.  Phimping will not cause a health decrease.
@endnode
@node Pause "Pause Game"

Pause Game
----------

To pause the game, select PAUSE from the GAME menu, this will signal the
opponent's computer to pause as well.  This option will display a message
at the bottom of your screen, acknowledging that the game is paused.
Press 'ESC' to return to the game.  Your opponent cannot restart the game.
The player who pauses the game must continue it as well.

PAUSE may also be invoked through the keyboard equivalent 'p'.

PAUSE is disabled while an opponent is editing or viewing a message.
@endnode
@node End "End Game"

End Game
--------

To leave the Grid, select END from the GAME menu, this will signal the
opponent's computer to end as well.  This option will display your
opponent's position and his energy beams on your screen.  Press any key to
return to the title screen, where you may begin a new game.

END may also be invoked through the keyboard equivalent 'e'.

A new game can not begin until both players have returned to the title
screen.  If your opponent has not returned to the title screen the top
message window will display OPPONENT BUSY.  Start cannot be selected until
this window reads OPPONENT READY.

END is disabled while an opponent is editing or viewing a message.
@endnode
@node Quit "Quitting"

Quitting
--------

From the title screen, select QUIT from the GRIDLOCK menu to quit the
program.  This will signal the opponent's computer that you have quit.
@endnode
@node Win "Winning"

If your opponent selects END GAME or loses all his health, the GridLock
logo will appear in the center of your game board, press any key to
display the opponent's position and energy beams on your screen.
@endnode
@node Message "Sending Messages"

Sending Messages
----------------

At the title screen (after connection has been made) or during the game,
you can send messages to your opponent by pressing the SPACE-BAR.  Doing
so will bring up a message requestor.  This message requestor supports
left-right cursoring, auto insert, delete, and all characters except the
quotation mark.  Pressing RETURN terminates the message entry and sends
the message to your opponent.  A null message will not be sent.

Press 'ESC' to remove a message sent to you by your opponent.

You can not continue play while entering a message, or when an opponent's
message is displayed on your screen.

@node Bugs "Known BUGS"

Known BUGS
----------

-  Will not work on a CyberGFX.  Do not promote it's display.

-  Sounds sometimes don't play.

-  The game sometimes locks up upon first entering the Grid, requiring a
   reboot.  I am aware of the problem, but can not find the reason for it.
   I believe that this only occurs when using joystick.  This may have
   been fixed.

-  Weird things may happen if both players are at the same location
   and building beams and things.  This will require changing some of the
   game method of play.  Soon.

-  OPPONENT BUSY is sometimes not being displayed.  Looking into this.
   This may have been fixed.

-  Game decides to end all on its own.  Happens rarely, but it has
   happened.  This may have been fixed.

@node Revisions "Previous versions"

New In Version 96.Dec.21
------------------------

- Removed registration annoyances and limitations... Now FREEWARE!

- Increased the speed of the Health buildup at beginning of game.

- Implemented Health Rejuvenation Overload which occurs if you do not
  move for too long.

- All ToolTypes can now be used as parameters when used from the CLI.


New In Version 95.Dec.12
------------------------
- Changed device open/close routines so that GridLock now works under 1.3
  again.

- Updated email and mail address.

- Changed Kill-GridLockPort script to use 'localhost' instead of
  '$HOSTNAME' and 'gridlock' instead of 'GridLock'.

- Changed TCP service entry to all lowercase.  Change your db/services
  entry to 'gridlock' instead of 'GridLock'.  It seems to be standard and
  most people were doing that way anyway (which would not work before).

- Added 'Service NOT found' as a detectable error message for TCP.

- Realized that the open/close routines were not the only thing wrong
  under 1.3.  For some unknown reason 1.3 does not like certain
  characters to go across the serial line.  Changed them so they are no
  longer transferred.

- Moved Control preferences to menus so you can change the control device
  during game play.

- Added Keyboard control.

- Added error #205 to 'Port NOT found' error message for TCP.

- When prompted to 'Press ANY key' at the end of a game, you many now
  press the left mouse button instead.

  than ended by a key press.

- Slowed down the speed of the Health buildup at beginning of game to
  encourage registration. :)

  erased if Health went below 0.

- Fixed a few errors in the documentation files.

- Added Rejuvination Warning sound.


New In Version 94.Dec.10

  along, it is just that I am the only one who knew it.

	from the SHELL/CLI and it will display the version of GridLock.

- 'BRIGHTNESS=' configuration command added.

- 'Preferences' menu added, for 'Brightness' setting.

  to quit the game and return to the title screen, where you may then
  quit GridLock.

  selects 'Quit' from the title screen.  When you press 'ESC' to clear the
  message, GridLock will exit.  The assumption is that, if you do not have
  anyone to play with then you will want to quit as well.

  so that they do not 'Busy Wait'.  (Greg!)



New In Version 91.09.14
-----------------------

- Fixed (???) no 'Phone Book' entries crash, under WB2.x

- Made the title-screen more multi-tasking.  I have not altered the game
  play multi-tasking as this does not provide consistent game play.  I am
  not, yet, convinced that there is a need for multi-tasking while playing
  the game! (Greg!)

-----------------------

- Fixed an alternative NULL-MODEM cable bug
