1. Introduction:

    Firstly, why do we need another 'Tron', 'Lightcycles', or 'Worm'
type game?
    Because they're fun that's why....

    Features of Turbo Light Cycles (TLC):

    - Three players at once. (P1,CPU,CPU), (P1,P2,CPU), (P1,P3,P3),
(CPU,CPU,CPU)
    - Multitasking 8 level editor, for customized play areas.
    - Turbo button, allows you to speed ahead of your opponents and cut
them off.
    - In-game music or sound f/x.
    - Five speed levels.
    - Five difficulty/obstacle levels.
    - Teleports, so you can escape from tricky situations.
    - And lots of fun.....


2. Game Overview.

    Just incase someone reading this has never played this type of game
I'll give you a quick explanation of the game play.
    The idea of TLC is to avoid crashing your 'Light Cycle' (The thin coloured
line that you drive around) into anything. Anything includes walls,
obstacles, other players, and your own cycle's tail. The last player alive
is the winner.
    Therefore the best tactic is try to race ahead of your opponents and try
to cut them off and force them to crash into something. If you have been
forced into a tight situation you can try to escape to another level by using
a teleport, these are large square blocks that have flashing entrances, but
you must hit the flashing portions otherwise you will crash and die. When you
use a teleport you and any remaining players will be teleported randomly
to one of the 8 levels, but you may be unlucky and materialize in a wall or
obstacle and die.


3. In-game Controls.

  Title Screen -

    Use the function keys F1 - F5 to set the game options and start the
game.   Pressing 'ESC' will exit the game back to Workbench.

  During the Game -

    Player 1: Joystick One, press Fire for turbo.
    Player 2: Joystick Two, press Fire for turbo.
    Player 3: Arrow keys, press Space for turbo.
    'P':      Pauses the game.
    'Q':      Maximum game speed, for a quick finish. (Winner recorded.)
    'Esc':    Quit race, return to title screen. (Winner not recorded.)



4. Level Editor.

  TLC comes with a separate level editor for designing your own custom areas.
  When you start the editor you will be presented with a screen containing
just one window, if you want to jump back to Workbench you can press the
Amiga-N or Amiga-M keys at any time. The screen contains the current level to
be edited, and the window contains all the editor controls.

  Here is an overview of the control window -

    - To exit the Level Editor just select the normal window close button.
    - Reload: Select this button to reset ALL levels to their last saved
design.  Remember all changes since the last save will be lost.
    - Save:   Save ALL the new level designs.
    - Clear:  Clear the CURRENT level.
    - About:  Display an info window.
    - Level:  This cycle gadget is for choosing which level to edit. Any
changes to other levels will NOT be lost OR saved to disk.  You must select
reload or save for these cases.
    - Pieces: At the bottom of the window are the 16 pieces that are used to
design a level. The currently selected piece is hi-lighted and when you click
anywhere on the screen this piece will be used.

  To design a level you just select a design piece and place it onto the
screen where to want it, if that happens to be behind the control window
you can just drag the window out of the way.
  Any irreversible action will have to be OKed using a request window.


5. System Requirements.

  The TLC game should run on any 1.3+ Amiga.
  The level editor will need at least 2.0 to run. (Sorry, needed to use
GadTools.)
  Both programs look for the level file in PROGDIR:  This works on my Amiga
and I think it works on all 1.3+ AmigaDOS, but if all your levels are blank
then this would be the problem.

  Note. As this is the first release version I can't be sure about this,
so if it doesn't work please let me know and I'll try to do something
about it....... (waiting for millions of complaints ;-)


6. Author.

  I'm a second/third year Computer Science student at Monash Uni, Clayton,
and I wrote this program because I was a bit bored with my Uni subjects at
the time.  I've got another  game on Aminet at the moment, it's called
Loop-D-Loop but it's a bit silly, have a look at it anyway. :-"
  Soon (I hope) to be released is a game called Aerial Racers, it is based
my all time favourite game from the C64 called Racing Destruction Set. It
contains most of it's features (from memory, it was a long time ago..) and
others besides, look out for it in the coming months.

  Anyway, if any one wants to contact me for complaint/compliments etc.
