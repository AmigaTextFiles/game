This is an Amiga adaptation of "Angel Worms". "Angel Worms" was
"Nibbles" like game I found on Atari 130XE.

If I remember well I wrote this game in 1993 for my Amiga 500 with
0.5MB RAM. So do not complain if some problems with compatibility
occur. 

In this version I've fixed a few probles with AGA, so it should
work O.K. 

There are some keys that I haven't describe in the builtin help.

 ESC - return to the title page
 q - quit from the game (only from the title page)
 F1-F5 - (during the game) change speed
  NOTE: F4 - only 2 players mode
	F5 - 2 pl. + MC68020
