@node Intro "Introduction"

Armada is a round based game for 2 to 5 persons. It's the conversion of a game which is played on paper with colored ball pens. The players move their ships and try to sink the opponents. @{"Show picture" link shot2.iff/main}

@node Require "Requirements"

I can only make exact specifications if I get reports from users.

My development system is an Amithlon-Amiga with PII/400 MHz. Because of the ReAction-Gui OS3.5 is required. Armada opens on the default public screen and should run on graphics cards and with EGS/AAA.

@node GUIDE "Guide"
After starting by double click on the armada icon a dialog box appears. Select map, number of players, names of players and number of ships per player. @{"Show picture" link shot1.iff/main}
After clicking on @{FG shine}Start@{FG text} the program loads the map. @{"Show picture" link shot2.iff/main} The first line shows number and name of the active player. The line under it shows state information or required action. The 8 arrow buttons are for moving the ship.
Next every player places his port by clicking in the map. The position can be changed till he clicks @{FG shine}Continue@{FG text}. When all persons have placed their port the first player must select one of his ships. He does this by clicking in the map. The ship which is nearest the mouse pointer is selected. A click on @{FG shine}Continue@{FG text} confirmates the selection. Then the ship is moved with the 8 arrow buttons. The ship draws a trace. After the 10th step he must decide if he forwards to the next player with @{FG shine}Continue@{FG text} or if he wants to fire at an opponent with @{FG shine}Fire@{FG text}.

The attack is done this way:
First an opponent's ship must be selected. It must be clicked near the position of the ship. The selected ship blinks. After a click on 'Continue' the bandwith is shown in the state line. The bandwith depends from the distance between the own and the opponent's ships. The shorter the distance the bigger the bandwith. A bandwith of 4 means a number from 1 to 4 must be thrown with the dice. Next the computer throws the dice. If the eye number is within the bandwidth the opponent's ship is hit and sinks.
There couldn't be shot over isles.

A ships sinks if it
- collides with an isle
- collides with the map border
- hits the line of an opponent's ship
- does more than 200 steps
- is shot

Winner is who is the only one with at least on ship.

@node PLAYFIELD "Create Map"

Maps can be drawn with paint programs. They are IFF-ILBM Pictures with the following specifications:
Size: 400x350
Depth: 1 to 8 (2 to 256 Colors)
File name: #?.armap

They must contain a mask information

@{FG fill}Possibility 1@{FG text}
Die water color is declared as mask color. Disadvantage ist that the water is single-colored.
@{FG fill}Possibility 2@{FG text}
A mask bitplane ist used. Water must be 0 and land 1.

When drawing maps you should avoid:
- to create pixel wide fjords
- to use player colors
- to draw isles in water color

The pictures are loaded by Datatype. Maybe other formats than IFF-ILBM could be used. I haven't tested this.
