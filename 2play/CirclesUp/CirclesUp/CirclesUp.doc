i) How to play Circles Up.

   This game is designed for 2 players. Each player takes it in turn to
shoot their circles up. Circles are either coloured red or green. The
circles will fly in from both sides of the screen. Player 1 must shoot the
red circles up. He must do this by pressing the LEFT ALT key. Player 2 must
shoot the green circles up. He must do this with the RIGHT ALT key OR the
left mouse button. When a circle is shoot up it will stop moving upwards
either when it hits another circle or hits the border surrounding the area
inwhich you shoot the circles up.

   When each player has learned to shoot the circles up it is time to
connect a certain number of circles. This can be done either horizontally,
vertically or diagonally. The amount of circles you need to connect is
decided by you. After you have pressed "P" on the main menu you will be 
presented with a question, which asks "How many circles do you need to
connect?" Here you must press either 3,4,5,6 or 7. The number you press
here is how many circles you need to connect whilst playing the game. Once
you have pressed a number from 3 to 7 there will be a small pause, then a
green circle will fly in from the left or the right side of the screen.
Player 2 must shoot this circle up with the RIGHT ALT key or the left mouse
button. Once Player 2 has shoot the green circle up, or let it fly past a
red circle will then fly in from either the left side of the screen or the
right side. Player 1 must then shoot this red circle up, or let it fly
by. Circles will repeat to fly in from both sides of the screen until someone
connects the right number of circles. The side that the circles fly in from
will be randomly picked but the colour of the circle that flys in will be
green then red then green then red etc.

   If for example you need to connect 5 circles and you manage to connect 6
circles (it can be done) you will still win the game! ie you do not have to
connect exactly the correct amount of circles.

   But there is still one more catch. Along with the green and red circles
a blue circle will occasionally fly in. Who evers go it is will be able to
shoot this blue circle up like they normally shoot their own circle up. This 
blue circle has a special property. Instead of it stopping when it hits another 
circle, it will simply fly thorugh all the circles and wipe them all out and 
stop when it hits the border of Circles Up.

   If this game cannot load the sound it uses it will continue on with the
game except it will play no sound.

   During the game, you may press ESC and the game will end and the main
menu will be displayed.

   Have fun!


ii) Information to programmers.

   Circles Up was written in Lattice C v5.10a by Jason Lowe. If there is
only the main code with this program or no code at all and you would like
to see all code which created Circles Up just write to me and I will gladly
send it to you.

   If you have looked at the code for Circles Up you will see that it is
comprised of many functions. These functions are, (in no particular order)

   - DisplayINFO
   - WriteNumber
   - CirclesUp
   - AWinner
   - how_many
   - up
   - up2
   - ClearRASTPORT
   - InitScreen
   - Clearlocs
   - idcmpch
   - Open_Stuff
   - die

   Now each of these functions explained in more detail for all you C
programmers who are interested in my code.

   - DisplayINFO
      This displays the information screen. It is called when the user
      presses I from the main menu.

   - WriteNumber
      This displays how many circles must be connected for one of the 2
      users to win the game. It is called after the user has selected how
      many circles they need to connect.

   - CirclesUp
      This is the main program for CirclesUp. It is called when the user 
      presses P from the main menu.

   - AWinner
      This displays who has won the game. It is called when someone has
      won.

   - how_many
      This function returns the maximum number of circles found from a 
      particular circle that has just been sent up. It is called directly
      after a green or red circle has just been sent up.

   - up
      This sends a green or a red circle upwards. It is called from the
      function CirclesUp when the user has elected to shoot their circle
      up at a particular location.

   -up2
      This sends a blue ball up which wipes out all other balls in its
      path. It is called from the function CirclesUp when the user has
      elected to shoot their circle up at a particular location.

   - ClearRASTPORT
      The clears the part of the rastport where the circles are drawn.
   
   - InitScreen
      This initializes the screen. It reseeds the random number generator, 
      sets all the colours correctly, loads the sound and finally draws the
      main title and the borders surrounding the play area.

   - ClearLOCS
      This clears all locations such that when this is called the computer 
      thinks that there are no circles presently located on the screen.
      This function is called when it is gameover and the screen has been
      cleared.

   - idcmpch
      This checks the IDCMP.

   - Open_Stuff
      This opens everthing necessary for CirclesUp. It simply opens the
      graphics library, intuition, a window and a screen.

   - die 
      This closes everthing opened and exits.


   I hope this has helped all C programmers interested in my code. 

   In the mean time HAPPY PROGRAMMING and COMPUTING....
