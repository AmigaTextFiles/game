Open the three packages on three disks named HF1, HF2 and HF3, or
open them to three directories and assign HF1, HF2 and HF3 to them.

You will also have to copy diskfont.library and icon.library to HF1:Libs,
ramdrive.device to HF1:Devs, C:cd to HF1:, and IconX to HF1: (unless you
are going to HD install it, and have them all in where they belong to)
