                HELSINKI FORCE 1 - the holocaust - the game
                -------------------------------------------

HF - the game is based on the movie "Helsinki Force - the holocaust",
which you can probably order from us. If you want it, please contact me
in the email address below. 


Requirements
------------
It SHOULD work with any amiga with 1MB memory, but you need more to have
the musics. We suggest at least a normal A1200.

To use the hd-installer, you need the Installer program from Commodore.
You can find this e.g. on AmiNet. Many other programs also have it included.


Playing the game
-----------------

We suggest that the more experienced player plays with Shinobi, although
it may be hard to learn the moves for a beginner. This is because the
levels are becoming harder and harder the further you get. We also
suggest that both players play with a joystick just to be fair, especially
the "Rämpytys" level.



(Use cursor up and down or joystick to "scroll")

Authors
-------

We were in quite a hurry, so the game is still kind of unfinished. There
are some holes in the tunnels etc., but if you find any bugs, they are
not bugs, they are features... ;) Please be free to contact us:

HF1 - the holocaust - the game was written with AMOS Pro in 1993-1995.
