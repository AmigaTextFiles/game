HellShot is a funny arcade game based on the classic game "CASTELS".
If you own an Amiga with CGFX you should be able to see this game running
in a window on the workbench. It also supports PPC processors.
If you haven't got CGFX you should download V1 of HellShot, which is
also available on Aminet. (V1 needs AGA)

The code of this game is 100% assembly !!!

If you want to see other projects that are beeing developped, you should
