@{b}--(( What Is SuperIT ? ))--@{ub}

SuperIT is a VERY addictive game that we, @{"3AMIGOS Software" link "About 3AMIGOS" 0}, created during MAY/JUNE 1997. The idea of the game came from when we use to play IT with our mates at school, as many of you may also remember. In SuperIT, when you are IT you have a disease, and this can be seen by the dots that will appear over your character's body. The aim of the game is to try and get rid of the disease before the time runs out and you lose. This is done by chasing the other characters around the screen, trying to pass the disease onto them so that they become IT, which means that they have to chase everyone and so on...

The game took about a month to do and is both graphically and musically well presented (so we think!). The game was programmed in AMOS 1.3, and the hardest part was trying to create the artificial intelligence for the computer to chase the other characters.

 Thanks goes out to all those for their comments and suggestions, especially
 Steve Morris who said that it was a 'poor man's PacMan!' Also thanks to AMOS
 1.3 for making it possible, but sadly 3AMIGOS Software are moving over to
 Blitz Basic 2.1 this summer, so look forward for some impressive games in the
 future! Last but not least, thanks goes out to Gateway 2000 for buying the
 wonderful AMIGA and we hope that they continue to support the AMIGA, for as
 long as we do!

@{b}--(( Installation ))--@{ub}

To install SuperIT just double click on the SuperIT-Install icon and follow the on-screen instructions. However, if a problem occurs, or you do not have the installer executable, then you can install it manually. See below:

1. Create a drawer on your harddisk where you want to put SuperIT.

2. Label it 'SuperIT' and make an assign to it in your user-startup.

3. E.g.  Assign >NIL: SuperIT: DH1:SuperIT

4. Double click on the SuperIT disk icon and select 'Show All Files'.

5. Copy the contents of the disk to your newly created drawer.

6. In the Libs drawer copy the 'Mathtrans.Library' to your SYS:LIBS/

7. The version supplied is 37.1, so check to see if you have a later version.

8. If you have, you do not need to copy the supplied library across.

9. Reboot your AMIGA to play the wonderful SuperIT!

10. Have Fun!!

@{b}--(( Requirements ))--@{ub}

To play SuperIT, you will need an AMIGA with at least 2mb of ram. A harddisk is recommended for faster loading times.

If you have the above, but are having problems, then write to us at one of the @{"addresses" link "About 3AMIGOS" 0} with a desciption of your system and details of what happens when it tries to load etc.. See @{"Trouble Shooting" link "Bugs" 0} for some problems that could be related to your situation.

@{b}--((How to play))--@{ub}

When you first load SuperIT, you will be approached by a menu with five options. The first option is the options menu. This menu allows you to set up who is going to play. By pressing the keys F5 to F8 you can select the options for each player (i.e computer, joystick 1, joystick 2, and keys). By pressing F9 you can change the playing time of the match which ranges from 1 to 5 minutes.

By pressing the F10 key you are able to select a playing map (the unregistered version has only three maps:  Level1.MAP, Level2.MAP and Level3.MAP).

By selecting the F3 key you will be presented with a little bit about 3AMIGOS software.

By selecting the F4 key you will be presented with forthcomming software releases from 3AMIGOS.

By selecting the help key you will be presented with a brief explaination of playing the game.

Press F2 to start the game. You will see blocks appearing from the level that you have loaded or the defualt level which is level 1. The computer will randomly select who is IT to start.

Your character can be controlled by either joystick or keys depending on what you chose on the options screen. During the game the computer will randomly place icons on the screen.  There are five different icons:

 1. Vaccine:   This makes you invisible to the IT disease
 2. Freeze:    This icon will temporarily freeze all the other players
 3: IT:        Collecting this will make you IT.
 4. Speed Up:  Collecting this will speed you up.
 5. Slow Down: This will slow you down.

@{b}--(( Level Editor ))--@{ub}

The level editor is an accessory to SuperIT itself. The editor enables you to modify and create your own playing maps. The editor is very simple, simply click on the screen where you wish for the block to appear. The editor allows for a MAX 30 blocks to be placed on the screen, if you go beyond the 30 blocks, the last block laid will disappear and be replaced by the newest block.

The controls for the editor are simple, by pressing the F1 you can clear all the blocks on screen and start a fresh map. Your maps can be saved by pressing the F2 Key, and entering a filename at the requester.

The level editor also makes it possible for you to edit existing level maps, simply by pressing F3 and loading up an old map. Remember that your only allowed 30 blocks, beyond that your blocks will disappear.

@{b}--(( BUGS ))--@{ub}

Superit was created using AMOS, and as a result there are a few bugs related to AMOS which can directly effect the running of SuperIT.

@{fg shadow}@{bg shine}Date: 20-6-97 By coder Andy Wheeler.@{fg text}@{bg back}

@{b}--MAIN BUGS--@{ub}

1. If you are running Screen Tab, sometimes the newer versions of this program will cause SuperIT to fail to load. The only way around this problem is to disable this program when running SuperIT.@{b}

--MINOR BUGS--@{ub}

1. On some of the level maps a five appears in the top left hand corner of the playing screen. This does not effect the gameplay of SuperIT, its just an annoying bug. This bug will be corrected in later versions of the game.

We would be grateful for any information on bugs that you discover whilest playing the game. Please send your discoveries to the address on the @{"about section" link "About 3AMIGOS" 0} of this guide. With your help SuperIT can only get better!

@{fg shadow}@{bg shine}Date: 21-6-97 By Dave Searle@{fg text}@{bg back}

@{b}--MINOR BUGS--@{ub}

1. While testing the game, we found that it was possible to turn off all the characters so that no one was playing. This isn't very important, we know, because YOU probably won't be that stupid to let no one play! This bug will be corrected in the next version of SuperIT however!
