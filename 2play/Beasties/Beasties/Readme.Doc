          Arrow-Dynamic Software: DEMO VERSION   
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This game is a cross between the most excellent Scorched Tanks and the
almost as excellent M*A*S*H/Ant Wars. I would say it's a Worms clone, only
it's more like the above mentioned games then Worms.

It is for two players only (sorry!) as I've not yet had time to implement a
one player mode. These types of games are best played with two players
anyway.

QUICK ADVERT FOR...

Beasties II ! ! ! Coming soon, this is a total rewrite of Beasties with
100% new code, 100% new graphics, faster, smoother, more playable and bigger!

COPYRIGHT AND HOW TO GET THE FULL GAME!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the DEMO version of the full licenceware title released by
Arrow-Dynamic Software. Because this is the demo version, it has many options
disabled from the main menu. The full version includes all the menu options
enabled, which include the following:

Lets you select between 1-9 rounds (Demo only allows 1)
Lets you select your start energy percentage (1-250%): demo allows 100% only
Lets you use "Worms" custom levels
Lets you create your own custom levels (imports from DPaint/PPaint etc)
Enter your names which appear above the Beasties heads
HD Installer
5 Custom levels
Four built in levels with random selector

and much, much more. If you want all the above and more, then you want the
full game. If you want the full game, then send just £3.99 including p&p to:

Arrow-Dynamic Software
PO Box 7
Dover
Kent
CT15 4AP

Please make all cheques, PO's payable to: "Arrow PD".

LOADING
~~~~~~~
This game can either be run from Workbench or CLI/Shell. There are two main
options for loading the game. Either you could straight forwardly click on
the icon or execute it from the Shell as a command line, in which case the
game will be run as normal, or you could do the following:

In your User-Startup or as a Shell command line, type:

Beasties sleep       * Option not available in this demo

(Instead of the usual "Beasties"). Now the game will automatically boot and
skip all intros, credits, etc, and automatically iconify. Cool eh? Once you
open the iconify bar, the game will run as normal. Useful for HD users who
wish the game to always be ready to run, but actually sit in the background
until they're ready to play it.

INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This game can easily be copied onto your hard disk (If you have one). You
can either use a directory utility such as DOpus, XLent, Sid, something
similar or even Workbench's Shell/CLI if you want to complicate things
further.

Files the game requires:

Note: No Assigns are required. 

COMPATIBILITY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This game should run on any Amiga with an Operating System of 2.0 or above
and 2 Meg of Chip Ram.

I've managed to test the game on the following setups:

Amiga 500+     2 Meg
Amiga 600      2 Meg
Amiga 1200     Unexpanded
Amiga 1200     2 Meg Chip, 6 Meg Fast & '30 CPU

Memory Note:
If you have installed the game onto your HD and upon running the game have
loads of windows open, colourful WB backdrops installed, WB Hacks wizzing
around, then you will obviously have less memory. The game constantly 
checks your memory status and if for any reason you reach 350 K or less,
immediately the game will no longer use any music of sound FX. So if you
suddenly find the game has no sound, it's not your TV! It just means
you're low on memory. 

Still, if you have more than 2 Meg to begin with, you 
will have no probs. The game itself actually only require 1.5 Meg, so every
user should be okay anyway. Just thought I should mention it!

CONTROLS
~~~~~~~~
The game requires a Mouse and the erm, Keyboard. The mouse is used to scroll
the screen by moving the pointer to the edge of the screen you wish to
scroll. The Icons at the bottom of the screen are used by clicking on them
using the Mouse. Some weapons may bring up another panel after they've been
clicked on, this will give greater control over the weapons.

Using the additional Keyboard controls it is possible to play this game 
completely without a mouse!

Additional keyboard controls are as follows:

Key:                 Effect:
~~~                  ~~~~~~
HELP                 Automatically scrolls the screen to find the current
                     player. Very useful and quick.

F1-F8                Select Icons on panels (Hot keys for the Mouse)
SPACE                Hot Key for activating the current weapon
CURSOR KEYS          Moves the active character (Up cursor Jumps).
                     The cursor keys will also aim the Bazooka weapon once
                     it has been activated. 
SHIFT KEY (Either)   Jumps (Used instead of the up arrow - for those who
                     prefer it.
CTRL                 Also Jumps. Added because my shift keys are dying.
Numeric Keys         Bad luck A600 owners! Still, it's only required
           as a mouse-like replacement. It scrolls the screen ie.
           4 = Left Scroll, 6 = Right Scroll, 8 = Up Scroll
           and 2 = Down Scroll. Finally 5 = Home in on Beastie (Same
           as the <Help> Key)
< and >              In the "Bazooka" panel mode, these will control the 
           power-meter. This can be used instead of the mouse. 
ESC                  Quit back to main menu
1                    Display Player 1's energy percentage left
2                    Display Player 2's energy percentage left
Left AMIGA key & N   This will Multitask back to DOS. Useful for Hard Disk
                     users. Could also act like a Pause button. An official
                     "Pause" option has not been added due to the fact that
                     this game is two player only, so therefore, pausing
                     is simply not required. NOTE: This feature has been 
           disabled in this demo version.

The Joystick can also be used to move the character instead of the Cursor
keys, but the Cursor keys are more accurate, so I'd reccommend those.

Also the CD³² CONTROL PADS are Supported! The whole game can be
controlled via CD³² control pad - no need to touch the keyboard!

A CD³² Control pad plugged into the Joystick port:

Cursor Control Pad        =  Direction of Beasties Movement (Left, Right, Jump)

Big << and >> buttons     =  Scroll the Screen Left and Right

Green and Yellow buttons  =  Cycle through your weaponary

Red Button       =  Fire

Blue Button               =  Home in on current Beastie.

In Bazooka Mode:
~~ ~~~~~~~ ~~~~
Big << and >> Buttons     =  Power Select

Cursor Pad                =  Left & Right to control angles of fire

Red Button                =  Fire

A note about falling: When your character falls from a high point, you have
no control over the Beastie until you hit the ground. However, if you jump
of a high point, you can use Left and Right to drift the Beastie. After the
Beastie has either fallen or jumped & driften down approximately 70 pixels,
the beastie will be rendered unconcious causing an energy loss of 10%.

If you have either fallen or gotten blown into the sky, once your Beastie
has smacked back onto ground, he will indent the ground. This means, if the
Beastie lands on a thin bit of ground, he will go straight through it.

GAMEPLAY
~~~~~~~~
The charactor will move over flat ground and bumpy ground, but when the
gradient (steepness) is too steep, your character will not be able to move
over it, he/she may have to Jump over/onto it, but even this will have no
effect if the ground is too steep. Best way is to simply dig through it,
or better still, blow it away!

The Icons at the bottom of the screen show the current weapon selected (With
White box surrounding it) and beneath each icon is the amount of that weapon
you have left. When it reaches Zero, it is obviously inactive.

Each time a player takes a shot or uses an icon, the screen will
automatically select the next player. Make things simple, each player gets
one go. He/She can move as far as possible around the screen, but as soon as
a weapon is used, that's the player's go over with.

Your energy will be displayed above your head for a few seconds each time
you are hit. You begin with 100% Health although this can be changed via
the menu option (See Menu Options: Not in this demo version!)

You will notice that at the very top of the screen, there's a text-bar.
This will have general comments in as you progess through the game. It is
also there as a Help type accessory. For example, clicking on an icon on the
panel at the bottom of the screen, will not only select that weapon, but
the Text-bar will inform you what that weapon is (Incase the icons are a little
unclear!). 

When you get shot or caught up in an explosion, your Beastie will be sent 
flying. When he lands, as long as he's still got some energy left, he will
re-generate his body, leaving his old dead body on the grounds. 

The energy goes down like this:
----------------------------------------------------
Bazooka Hit:           Varies (Next Paragraph)
Shot Gun Hit:                15% deduction
Dynamite Hit:                50% deduction
Fall more then 70 pixels:    05% deduction
Being blown off the screen:  Sudden Death!
----------------------------------------------------

The Bazooka can be a lethal or lethal-less weapon. You will notice after
you have selected it, that there is an energy bar which you drag your
mouse arrow across - the more full it is with red, the more powerful
the shot. The more powerful the shot - the more energy it will reduce your
opponent by and the faster the missile goes.

Just above and below the bar are three marks: First mark at the start of
the bar, second mark half way across and third mark at the end.

If the energy bar is less then the first red marker, this means, if the missile
hits your opponent, it will just take -5 hit points of him/her. If it's between 
the first and middle marker, it will reduce their energy by -20. Between the 
middle and end marker, it takes -30 and anything past the final marker takes
-40. Here's a table for easy viewing:

------------------------------------------------------------
Less then first red marker:      -5  energy deduction
Between the first and middle markers:   -20 energy deduction
Between the middle and end markers:     -30 energy deduction
Past end marker:        -40 energy deduction
------------------------------------------------------------

Pressing 1 or 2 depending on which player you are; will display your current
health.

You have infinite Shot Gun bullets, but the rest of weapons are limited.

The game ends when a player has lost all of his/her health.

Official (Laws of me!) ways of dying include:
Being gunned to death (Lack of energy),
Being shot off the side of the screen,
Falling through the bottomless ground.

Here's a list of the icons and what they do (From left to right):

1: Fire!                      Activates the currently selected icon.
2: Shot Gun:                  Shoots a horizontal shot. Infinite ammunition.
                              Upon hitting your opposition, he/she will go
                              flying (Further then from the explosion
                              of dynamite or Bazooka) giving the advantage
                              of maybe blowing the opposition of the screen
                              (Sudden death!)
3: Bazooka:                   Missile can be positioned using the cursor
                              keys once activated. ie. After selected, click
                              on the "Fire!" icon for another panel to
                              appear. The Beastie can't be moved, but can
                              point his gun in seven increments (ie. Right,
                              Left, Up, Up-Right, Up-Left, Down-Right and
                              Down-Left). Clicking on the second "Fire" will
                              shoot the missile. Remember: what goes up,
                              must come down!

                              If you find the Beastie is not positioned
                              correctly, you can click on the "Back" icon
                              and it'll take you back to the main panel
                              where you can reposition your Beastie.

                              Don't forget, there is a Power-Meter for the
                              Bazooka, if you don't set it from Zero, the
                              missile 'll blow up in your face! Nice!
4: TNT:                       Most powerful weapon. Stick a stick near
                              someone and run! They can be dropped down
                              holes etc, once lit, you have a few seconds to
                              run before the explosion takes place.
5: Dig Horizontal/Vertical:   Two icons represented by an arrow showing
                              which direction you'll dig in. Once activated
                              the Beastie will dig a certain length. The
                              Beastie can be stopped at anytime by click the
                              mouse.
6: Crater Maker:              Does no character damage, but will create one
                              heck of a hole. Useful for obsticles.
7: Bridges:                   Will stick a bridge infront of you.
8: Rock Enhancer:             Out of your pocket comes a huge boulder.
                              This, like the bridges can be used for either
                              protection or climbing upon. Unlike bridges,
                              the boulder will Fall until it hits the
                              ground. This may be used as a stepping stone,
                              ie. You can build up a stack if you're high up
                                  which will save you dropping down too far
                                  and rendering y'self unconcious.

Tip: If the opposition is on the edge of a screen, why not use the shot gun
     to blow him/her right off!

     Same applies to if the opposition is on thin ground; blow the ground
     away from underneath 'em!

CHEAT MODE
~~~~~ ~~~~
Yes sir! A cheat mode has been added! Cool eh? So what is it I hear you cry?
Well, I don't see the point in adding a cheat mode if no one will be able to
find out what the heck it is, so a little clue for you: On the Main Options
screen, just type in the full name including the space in the middle of the
guy who wrote this excellent game. If correct, a message will appear.

As a cheat mode for this type of game, it was a limited decision. ie. What
would be the point in including a cheat for infinite energy as neither
playerrwould be able to win. So I've constructed a slightly more
powerful "NUCLEAR MODE". I'll leave you to test this out. All I can say is
watch out!

Pointless Note:
If you're a blasted Binary Hacker (Sorry - Editor) and insist on
hacking (There I go again - Editing) through the ASCII Data to this
game, please note the Cheat Mode is Encrypted in Numerical Values,
so bad luck, 'cos a Binary Editor (Got it right!) won't find this.

Of course, if you're name's "Mushroom" Kellett, I'm sure you'll
end up writing your own specially formulated Binary Editor that will pick
this up.

WORMS IS SUPPORTED!
~~~~~ ~~ ~~~~~~~~~
The following note does not include this demo version, but only the full game
available direct from Arrow-Dynamic Software!

Yep, the hit commercial game "Worms" is supported in Beasties! Yes sir! You
may have noticed loads of disks, even a CD or two around with literally
thousands of extra levels for the game Worms. These can also all be used in
Beasties! Yep, on going support for this game from people who don't even
know it exists!

More will be explained later! First...

MAIN MENU OPTIONS
~~~~ ~~~~ ~~~~~~~
Okay, a run down including information on the support of Worms:

Start Game:   Simple option for the simple minded.

Level Type:   Built-in Levels include:

              Forest:          Similar in GFX style to Worms.
              Space:           The planet Mars, now has life!
              Workbench:       Not in this demo
              Building Blocks: Not in this demo

              If a Custom Level has been loaded (see later), there will also
              be a title "Custom". Very original I know. 
                  
Energy Amount: This is the amount of energy both players will start of with.
          It ranges from 1 (Sudden Death!) to 250. The higher the energy,
          the longer the game will last (Obviously!). The Left Mouse 
          Button on this option will increase the energy value and
          so that must mean that the Right Mouse Button will decrease
          the value. Not available in this demo version!

More Options: Brings up another menu with more options (See later).

Sleep!:       Iconifys. ie. Multitasks back to Workbench and let's you
              continue the game by clicking on the provided icon. Useful
              for Hard Disk users. Not available in this demo version!
Credits:      Yep, lists the people who helped bring you this game.
Quit:         Quits back to DOS. Useful for Hard Disk users.

And the second Menu:

Hard Disk:    Yep, it will load the files from the disk and copy them onto
Installer:    your hard disk in a stated partition. Please note that I have
              not actually got a Hard Disk, so have had to rely on my RAM
              disk and a few friends testing this option for me. Any
              problems and you can always copy the files manually or through
              a Directory program such as DOpus, XLent etc.

              When asked to give a Partition to copy the game onto, then
         give the FULL path including any directory you may have
         created before-hand (eg. Dh0:Games/Beasties). 

         Not available in this demo version.

System Check: Displays your computer's free memory (Ram) along with
              the processor, the battery-backed up clock time and date.


Okay, now onto the WORMS bit...

Load Custom Level: The following is not available in this demo version:
         This is the option for CONVERTED (Next option) Worms
                   levels.

                   To create your own Level (First for Worms, then Convert
                   it, follow me on...

                   To create your own LANDSCAPE or TERRAIN or LEVEL (Take
                   your pick, I ain't fussy) you need a paint program which
                   will save pictures out in IFF format such as
                   Electronic Arts DPAINT series, Personal Paint and most
                   others these days. Draw a LowRes, 8 Colour picture with
                   a page size of 960 X 350 pixels.

                   Colour 0 will be used as transparent, any of the 7
                   remaining colours can be any colour you wish (Oh, lucky
                   you!) Once completed and saved, the next option should be
                   used.

EXTRA LEVELS.......The following need not apply to this version as it is
         just a demo. The full version however has:

                   Custom1            A Face of a person "Screaming"
                   Custom2            Bambi - good one for the kids
                   Custom3            Volcano Terrain
                   Custom4            WWF - The Ring
                   Custom5            Sonic the Hedgehog
                   CustomX          * May be offensive to some as it has
                                      nudity in. Avoid if easily offended.

                   (Type in Exactly as listed)

                   The level will then be loaded in, ready for use.
                   When converting levels, you can infact call them what you
                   like, but I thought I'd make things simple by naming them
                   Custom#. 

Convert Worm Level: Not available in this demo version:
                    Once you have either created your own level or got one
                    from PD, CD, Any-D, then click this option. It will
                    ask you for a level name. Enter the FULL path and name.
                    If found, it will load it, convert it then ask for an
                    Output path. Enter the PATH and NAME you wish to call
                    the now converted to Beastie format map and it will
                    save it. You can now use the "Load" option to load in
                    the level.

                    Tip: When saving levels, if you're saving them to
                         the source disk, save them in the path:

                         Df0:Custom/  (Name)

                         Because then when reloading the levels, you just
                         have to type the name with out having to include a
                         path (eg. Custom1  and not Df0:Custom/Custom1)

                         (Whenever you load a level in, if it can't find
                         the map name, it will automatically look in the
                         Custom Directory.)

                    (Small Print): There are a lot (ie. Literally Thousands)
                                   of "Worm" Levels out there doing the
                                   rounds in the PD circuit and you will
                                   find most (ie. 97%) or them will convert
                                   to Beasties levels, but due to the
                                   way the game was coded, you will find
                                   a small percentage don't agree with the
                                   Beasties converter and lock the game up.
                                   This is a VERY small percentage and out
                                   of a Worms CD and several floppy disks
                                   full of Worms Maps, I've only found two
                                   that have problems (Not that I've tested
                                   all the levels on a CD as there are too
                                   many!)

Enter Player Names: Every time the game begins and the next player is
                    activated, above the player's head will appear their
                    name. Default being "Player 1" and "Player 2", this can
                    be changed to any eight letter name. It just makes the
                    game more interesting to see your name above the
                    Beasties head.
          Not available in this demo version!
Rounds:             Let's you select how many rounds you want the game to
                    last (1-9). Note: Once a game finishes, a results table
                                      will appear of which rounds were won
                                      by who. In this demo version,
                  1 round only can be played at a time.
Player to Begin:    Lets you decide who will start of each round with "The
                    first go". You can select "Player 1", "Player 2" or
                    "Random" in which case the computer will randomly select
                    a player for each round. Player 1 will always start first
          in this demo.

More Options:       Another menu of options...

   -------
Score Type:         Either select as "Roll Over" or "Clear after Each Game".
                    After each game has finished, you'll notice a table of
                    results appears on screen, with wins and loses to each
                    player. The "RollOver" option lets you keep these
                    results for as many games as you like. The "Clear"
                    option will wipe clean the score board after each game.
          Not available in this demo version.
The full version:   Just a few notes from me. Basically outlines a few
                    things already written in this document such as how to
                    get your hands on the full game!
Back a Menu:        Puts you back on to the previous menu options.

GAME SPEED
~~~~ ~~~~~
This game should run fairly fast on all Amigas. On the Lower-end Amigas such
as the A500+/600 is will be fast enough to enjoy, and on the 1200 onwards,
it should run at a farly decent rate (Not that I'd know seeing as this was
written on a 2 Meg 500+.)

LOADING SPEEDS
~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~
Please note, the only way I could have squashed this game on to one disk is
through crunching the program data. This does mean that every so often, once
the disk has finished accessing data, the screen will flash for a few
seconds before anything else will commence. I've tried to keep this down to
a minimal amount.

Other games written by yours truly...
~~~~~ ~~~~~ ~~~~~~~ ~~ ~~~~~ ~~~~~
Yep, here's a list of the following games I've written (only the ones I've
written which are in my opinion quite good...)

Emotional Conflict: Adventure game in the style of KGB I suoppose. Quite
                    an easy (not for experienced, up for a huge challenge
                    player). Could well be worth a look for people who wish
                    to convince themselves that they can complete an
                    adventure game.

                    The game was reviewed in Issue 94 XMas '95 issue
                    of Amiga Computing. 

                    All One Meg Amigas. Available from:

                    Arrow PD             Price: 99p + 70p p&p
                    P.O. Box 7
                    Dover
                    Kent
                    CT15 4AP
                   


Total Species:      Adventure game again, this time in the style of the
                    commercial game DreamWeb. With a top - down perspective
                    view. A little more taxing then "Emotional Conflict",
                    but still not for real experienced users as they'll
                    probably have it finished within a few goes.

                    All Two Meg Amigas. Available from:

                    Arrow PD
                    P.O. Box 7                Price: 99p + 70p p&p
                    Dover
                    Kent
                    CT15 4AP
               

Contentious:        Two player only, split screen, hunt and kill the other
                    player game. Similar to the PD games Carnage, Extreme
                    Violence and Tank Attack.

                    There are many powerups you can find, while running
                    around mazes looking for your opponent.

                    Game comes with a built-in construction kit, allowing
                    you to create and save your own level mazes and use them.

                    All Two Meg Amigas. The game was reviewed in the April
                    CD and Floppy disk edition of CU Amiga.

                    This time a Licenceware game available from:

                    5th Dimension Licenceware
                    1 Lower Mill Close            For the mere price of:
                    Goldthorpe
                    Rotherham                     £2.95 including p&p
                    South Yorkshire
                    S63 9BY

Ingenuous:          Fairly new and PD!
                    It is a Monkey Island style adventure game set in a
                    prison in which you have to escape. 
          
                    Requires 2 Meg and OS 2.0+
          
                    Available now!

I have written a few other games, but in my opinion they were so lame I'm
telling you now to avoid the following: (All PD Freeware/Shareware)

The Summoning, Seed of Darkness, Pounds Island, Introgash, Bug,
Space Eclipse, Fleegle

I released them seven games when I first started coding, now regret it.

FINALLY...LOOK OUT FOR:

B E A S T I E S  I I!!!
Coming soon!

That's all, so enjoy Beasties...
