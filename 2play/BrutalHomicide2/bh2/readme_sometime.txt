The Story Of Developing Brutal Homicide II
------------------------------------------

Back in 1995-96, a game was created called Brutal Homicide. And when it got
around, it sure became popular. So many people contacted me, and told me
how they liked the game. It was a fine time (in more ways than this, but that
is beside the point..)

Remembering this in the beginning of 1997, I deciced to write a sequel, with
all the missing features added. I had just got my A1200 then, and was in a
hurry to start programming something AGA'ish. The project started 17
february 1997. The game would be a 1 or 2 player arcade style game, much in
the looks of Chaos Engine. 

Over the time when developing it, the game became more and more like the old
Brutal Homicide (a 2-player versus game).


I'm releasing this beta version, because this game will stop developing,
at least for a few months. Possible for ever. I don't want this work to go
without even being revealed to the public. So here you have it.

The main reason for this shutdown in development is that I have no one to
play the game with. And no one I know uses Amiga anymore.

But I sure hope you enjoy playing it !


Sorry for the non existent documentation..
