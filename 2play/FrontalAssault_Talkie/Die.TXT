This smarts.
Next time, you'll wish you never MET me!
Oh, shut up.
You'll be surprised to know I'm still alive.
Ah, I was gonna kill myself anyway.
I let you win and don't you bloody forget it.
Do you have any idea how much that STINGS?!
Hello? I'm still alive but I'm badly burned. Please, get an ambulance!
