GAME RULES:
===========

The first player gets the white, the second the black stones. Each player
alternately sets one of his stones (with one, two or three points on it)
on the board, until the last field is occupied.
The goal of the game is to enclose as many stones of the opponent
horizontally, vertically or diagonally with the own stones as possible
to get a high scoring. But the enclosing counts only to the scoring, if at
least one of the enclosing stones has as many points on it as the number of
enclosed stones is. For each enclosed stone you get one point to the scoring.
If both enclosing stones have the right nubmer of points on it, the
enclosing counts double.

Example:

  W3 B2 B1 W2 B1 W3

White gets 2 points for the enclosing of B2-B1 through W3 and W2 (only
W2 counts) and black gets 2 points for the enclosing of W2 through B1 and B1.

The winner of the game is the one who has the highest scoring at the end of
the game.



SOLITAIRE VARIANT:
==================

Same basic rules as above, but one player gets both colors and tries to
get the highest scoring for one color. My maximum is 65 points.


HOW TO PLAY:
============

First select the menu Project and choose if you want to play with another 
human player, against the computer or if you wanna look at the computer 
playing with himself.
A human player must first select the stone of his color he wants to play
(if he doesn't select one, the last selected will be choosen) and then 
select the position on the board where it should be placed.
There are gadgets for taking back a move, starting a new game and
terminating the game on the lower part of the screen.


Enjoy the game!
