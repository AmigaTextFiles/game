<B><H2>These are only basic information about BoingPairs requirements. Please read them carefully! For more detailed info about the game please read the manual BoingPairs.html.</H2></B>

<P>1) BoingPairs ABSOLUTELY needs Dejavu Sans font installed in MOSSYS:Fonts !! The game won't start without it! That's why I announced BoingPairs for MorphOS 2.x - because Dejavu Sans is part of the system in MOSSYS:Fonts in these installations. I've tested BoingPairs succesfully under MorphOS 2.3 and 2.4 and I secretly hope that no one has been using lower versions of MorphOS 2 anymore..:-)</P>

<P>But if you have Dejavu Sans in MOSSYS:Fonts under MorphOS 1.4.5 as well, the game will work without any problem too !!! On my 1.4.5 installation it works perfectly.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, due to this font problem I was forced to release BoingPairs for MorphOS only - and believe me that I would be very happy to release it for OS4.1 as well... If I had created BoingPairs with Hollywood 4.5 the problem would have been solved. So why did I code in Hollywood3? More info in  appropriate chapter in the manual.</P>

<P>2) BoingPairs will run on its own screen in 1280x1024 so before launching the game please make sure that your graphics card and monitor are capable of this resolution...</P>

<P>3) BoingPairs has to preload some graphics during launching so starting the game after a double-click takes some time - some 5 seconds on my G3/600. This is unpleasant and I am quite unhappy with that but I can't do it anything about it... It might be good to copy the game to Ram Disk: and launch it from there - this should speed things up a bit...</P>
