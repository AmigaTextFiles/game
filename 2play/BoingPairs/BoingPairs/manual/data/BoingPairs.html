<H2><B><U>What's the story?</U></B></H2>


<P>BoingPairs is another presentation of capabilities of the great programming language Hollywood, specifically Holywood3. My following projects (if there are any...) will be developed with Hollywood4.5 or higher versions.</P>

<P>As the name itself states, this is a classic and well known game of pairs. I created it on the occasion of 25th anniversary of our most beloved Amiga computer - so HER spirit is the main feature of game design and graphics - I put as many boing balls as possible in BoingPairs! - even in the name of the game:-)) And the cardset of the game is, of course, inspired by Our Greatness too!! It's almost impossible to choose 18 pictures from 25-year history of something but I tried to introduce at least Amiga models, operating systems and some important people behind it...</P>

<P>But if you don't like my cardset you can create your own very easily with the included utility called <B>CardSetCreator</B> or manually with TVPaint or fxPaint! And if you do so, you can share it with us (through Aminet for example)!</P>

<P>Although the game itself is really very easy, coding ang drawing (and the same stands for the <B>CardSetCreator</B>) took me quite a very long time and sometimes some nerves:-)) Source code has some 900 lines but I don't rue any second I spent working on it because I was doing it all for HER and for YOU, my friends from the planet which is ruled by the only computer in the world with heart inside!!!</P>

<P>So that's why i hope that you will like BoingPairs at least a bit...</P>

<H2><B><U>Main Menu</U></B></H2>

<P>After the start you find yourself in the main menu screen. Note that the game control is designed for both right-handed and left-handed people so all the menu items can be clicked with both left and right mouse buttons.</P>

<B>START</B> - take a guess:-)<BR>
<B>PICTURES</B> - this will start a slideshow of all 18 pictures used as game cards. To view another picture please click left/right                       mouse button<BR> 
<B>CREDITS</B> - shows the list of programs I used for creating BoingPairs and my thanx to Luky for betatesting<BR>
<B>QUIT</B> - hmmm...:-)<BR>

<H2><B><U>The Game</U></B></H2>

<P>First both players choose their names (maximum of 6 characters), then the game starts.</P>

<P>The game is played according to the rules of pairs. Player who is on the turn (for better orientation he/she is marked with  <B>"*"</B> ) clicks on two cards which he/she thinks are identical. If he/she is right he/she gets one point and continues playing. If he/she is wrong now it's his/her opponent's turn. The game ends when all the cards are away from the playfield. BoingPairs then tells you who won ( if it isn't draw). Then you can return to the main menu or play again.</P>

<P>Player 1 is the one who allways starts the game. This can be an advantage because when I was testing BoingPairs I was several times so lucky that I clicked two identical cards with the very first two clicks!! So If you decide to play again, player two becomes player one so he/she can also have this advantage!</P>
