<B><I><H2>!!! IMPORTANT !!! The game cards and slideshow pictures are stored in the CardSet drawer. If you want to keep them up for later use, do a backup of them because CardSetCreator is going to overwrite them with newly created files !!!</H2></I></B>

<P>Hmm, when I started developing BoingPairs I wasn't planning something like CardSetCreator! I was just prepared to write in the manual something like <B><I>"Do you want to have your own pictures in the game? Then create it with TVPaint or fxPaint!":-)</I></B> But then I tried it myself and after a few pics I felt very tired...</P>

<P>So I read the Hollywood documentation carefully and found out that it was capable enough for me to code such an utility! Moreover during my work I learned how to work with DOS library commands for manipulating files and requesters in Hollywood which is extremely useful!</P>

<P>So I worked really hard on CardSetCreator and I think I managed to produce quite an advanced piece of software...</P>

<P>CardSetCreator's task is to create 18 game cards (154 x 154 pixels) and 18 slideshow pictures (568 x 424 pixels) from your JPG pictures and save then to the CardSet drawer under the names card01.jpg ... card18.jpg and pix01.jpg ... pix18.jpg. That seems to be the only CardSetCreator requirement : your images <B><U>must be in JPG format!</U></B></P>

<P>After starting CardSetCreator a requester appears. It's hungry for a path to a drawer where the pics you want to have in the game are placed. So choose a drawer and <B><U>DOUBLECLICK</U></B> it! (<I>this requester wants only the path so after a doubleclick on your drawer it won't show its contents - the requester window stays empty</I>). Then click <B>"Ok"</B> and wait until CardSetCreator finishes its job. Of course - the better quality and higher resolution of the images the more time it takes to scale them all...</P>

<B><I><H3><P>TIP : As default path of the requester is set to the BoingPairs drawer where the game and CardsetCreator are started from, the most convenient way is to create a drawer there, eg. "pics" and copy your favourite 18 JPG pictures in it. Then run CardSetCreator, just doubleclick "pics" then click "Ok" and that's it!:-)</P></H3></I></B>

<P>But this is not necessary because as I have stated CardSetCreator is quite smart. It should be able (and in all my tests it WAS!) to find those 18 JPGs anywhere! For example in a drawer with a mess of images in different formats, anims, mp3s, text documents etc... Images even don't have to be in a drawer - CardSetCreator finds them even if they are just dropped in a root of a partition...</P>

<P>On the other hand, If you Cancel the requester, close it with closing gadget or if there aren't enough pictures in the chosen path, CardSetCreator will call you names and quits!:-))</P>
<BR>

<B><U>Some additional information...</U></B>

<P>Scaling engine of Hollywood seems to be very capable and in most cases it achieves satisfying results. But sometimes some pixels loss occur - neither Hollywood nor CardSetCreator are guilty! For example If you use an 2560 x 1490 image from a digital camera you should be prepared on something like this when you convert it to a 154 x 154 pixels square picture...:-))</P>

<P>But you can allways create your own cardset and pictures manually with earlier mentioned TVPaint or fxPaint. This is suitable e.g. for images with height bigger than width - such pics look quite funny when converted to 568 x 424:-)  You should only keep in mind that slideshow picture's resolution is 568 x 424. Picture is horizontally centered so the width of the picture doesn't have to be exactly 568. But on the y-axis the position of the picture is set to a certain point so image's height should allways be 424 if you want it centered on the screen...</P>

<B><I><H3>TIP : When I was creating a cardset from screenshots of Amiga games, some of them looked really funny when converted from 320 x 256 to 568 x 424:-) So I did just a little trick - In TVPaint I drawed a filled blue 320 x 424 rectangle (I used exactly the blue colour from main menu background) and placed the Amiga screenshot to the center of this rectangle! Then I select it all as a brush (width 320, height 424), saved it and voila! - it really was centered!:-)) It's very easy and you can use it for any picture which dimensions are lower than 568 and 424... </H3></I></B>
