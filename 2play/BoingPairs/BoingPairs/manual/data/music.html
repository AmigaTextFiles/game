<H2><B><U>Your favourite song in BoingPairs</U></B></H2>

<P>Don't you like the song I composed for BoingPairs? So help yourself and feed it with any other mp3 !!! It's so easy that I wonder why I am writing a special chapter about it:-) Just choose an mp3, rename it as Boing.mp3 and copy it to the music drawer instead of my original tune - and that's all!!! Now you can run BoingPairs and enjoy:-))</P>

<P><B><H3>My personal tip : If you do like psytrance try "Pijanist" - the great tune by Kicko. You can download it from Aminet (mods/kicko) or from www.psykicko.com (it's on CD3 Dark Creatures)</H3></B></P>
