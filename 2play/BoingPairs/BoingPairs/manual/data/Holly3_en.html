<B><U><H2>Why Hollywood3 instead of Hollywood4.5?</H2></U></B>

<P>When the development of BoingPairs started I was a proud owner of Hollywood3 and the world was mine!:-) But then suddenly (just when I finished my first betaversion) Hollywood4.5 : Snowflake came out and finally brought that long awaited feature - fonts can now be linked to the executable and don't have to be installed in user's MorphOS anymore!
I was jumping two meters high for joy and with help of my friend Radim Kopecky (THANX MANY MANY TIMES RADIM !!!) I immediately bought it. Then installed, made some necessary changes in BoingPairs script (just because this font issue), ran it under Hollywood4.5 and Oh! At the first look everything seemed to be fine but right after I found out that something concerning clicking on objects (menu items and cards) stopped to work correctly! I won't bother you with technical details (if anyone is interested we can discuss it on a forum...) So the game wasn't 100% functional and I would NEVER release such incomplete project!!!</P>

<P>So I finished BoingPairs with Hollywood3 only for MorphOS...:-( But it's really a case for Sherlock Holmes I guess... The SAME sourcecode worked perfectly under Hollywood3 but incorrectly under Hollywood4.5 while neither version of Hollywood displayed any error message...!!! But I haven't given up and I still hope that with Andreas' help I am going to deal with this problem and release BoingPairs for OS4.1 (and maybe for PC as well)!!!</P>

<P>BUT PLEASE don't get me wrong!!! Hollywood 4.5 is absolutely superb piece of software, great work!!! But - they haven't been friends with BoingPairs so far...</P>
