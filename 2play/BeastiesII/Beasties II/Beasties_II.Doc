 This game should run on all 2 Meg Amigas (including the now dated A500).
                   It was actually coded on a 2 Meg A500+!

        I've managed to test Beasties II on the following Amigas:

                               A500+ 2 Meg
                               A500  1.5 Meg
                               A1200 2 & 6 Meg

      Some of the screen effects may run a little too fast on anything
       other than a 68000 machine (500/+/600). This is because it was
                 programmed on a 68000 machine, as I've said.

  May I take this opportunity to thank you for buying and welcome you to

                           -  B E A S T I E S  I I  -

   Notice this is Beasties II? Not Beasties? That is because, some of you
  may well have got or played Beasties I. It has been on both the CU and AF
           magazine CDs as well as being stocked by most PD libraries.

         It was a trial version to see if I could code a game like that,
            this is like the neat copy, being compared to the draft.

    It is based on "Worms" as you've all played this, I won't bother with
   the game explanation. I've copied the controls for Worms (more or less)
    to make you lot feel at home with it. CD남 Joypads are supported also
                           (see controls section).

      I'm not the world's best at writing documents, so my advice is to
                           just experiment in life!

                          The Ultimate Conflict!

                    C O N T R O L S  E X P L A I N E D

  Controls:

  During the game, if you press the <F1> key, a list of controls will
  appear.

  For all you people out there who are unable to do this (Well, maybe
  your <F1> key doesn't work), here's how it works:

  During the Game:

  MOVE BEASTIE LEFT              : Left Arrow key of Joystick left
  MOVE BEASTIE RIGHT             : Right Arrow key of Joystick right
  MAKE BEASTIE JUMP              : Either <Shift> or the <Ctrl> key or
                                   (BLUE) CD남 Joypad button!

  Note: During a jump, unlike "Worms", you can control which way you drift.
        The little Beastie dudes are more advanced then little pink Worms
        see.

  SCROLL THE SCREEN PLAY-AREA    : Mouse movements or
                                   CD남 Joypad >> key and D-Pad movements
  ACTIVATE SELECTED WEAPON       : <Space Bar> or Joystick fire

  Note: CD남 Joypad's Red button, will do the same as Joystick's Fire
        button.

  BRING UP WEAPONS PANEL         : Mouse button or << CD남 Joypad button

  Once Weapons panel is active, click on the desired weapon or press
  joystick fire. Joystick L/R/U/D to move arrow (or use the mouse).

  CENTER IN ON CURRENT PLAYER    : <HELP> Key or >> + (BLUE) CD남 joypad
                                   b'ttons.

  CENTER IN ON SPECIFIC PLAYER
  AND DISPLAY ENERGY AT THE SAME : (1) for Player 1
  TIME                             (2) for Player 2

  QUIT BACK TO MAIN MENU         : (ESC) or Click the icon

  As you can see, I've done my best to clone the controls for "Worms",
  mainly because all you lot should be used to it by now and probably
  wouldn't feel confortable with any other controls!

  If you forget a control, try the same thing you'd do while playing
  "Worms" and with any luck, it'll work! Same goes with CD남 Joypad
  controls.

                      W E A P O N S  E X P L A I N E D

   Weaponary: From the panels in order (Left to right)...

      EXPLOSIVE SHOT-GUN
    Once selected, your Beastie will carry a gun. Angle it with the Up/Down
    cursor keys/Joystick movements.

    Hold <SPACE BAR> or FIRE until the Power Panel builds up accordingly.
    Depress the Fire method to shoot the explosive cannon weapon. Explosive
    damage is rated as Medium.

    Energy deduction: 20%

      DYNAMITE
    Once selected, your Beastie carries a stick of explosive TNT. Press
    <SPACE BAR> or Joystick FIRE to lay it. Once done, you have the time it
    takes for the spark to go down the string before it explodes. In this
    time, just RUN to get out of there! The dynamite will fall if it's
    dropped off a ledge. Explosive damage it rated as MASSIVE!

    Energy deduction: 40%

      CLUB
    Your Beastie will carry a club once selected. You can swing this as many
    times as you wish until you actually hit something. Hitting the other
    player will cause him/her to go flying. Hitting anything else will cause
    very little damage. You do get infinite of these though!

    Energy deduction: 15%

      CLOCK-WORK MOUSE
    Top weapon I think! Once select, press SPACE BAR or FIRE to drop it and
    it will move across land (and bumpy land) until either you press
    FIRE/SPACE again to explode it on your request or if it hits a lump it
    cannot go over.

    Energy deduction: 30%

      LAZER
    Once selected, press FIRE/SPACE again to shoot it. This is a horizontal
    travelling weapon. Any thing it hits, will cause minor explosions. Once
    it reaches its length limits, it will commit ONE FINAL, BIG explosion.
    Good for making holes in hills.

    Energy deduction: 35%

      COME 'ERE!
    Once selected, Beastie carries a mechanical arm. Remember Mortal Kombat?
    Well, this is a clone of the "Scorpion" charactor.

    Pressing FIRE/SPACE will cause a string to be released. It GOES THROUGH
    TERRAIN! If it touches the other player, it will pull him/her in - even
    through terrain! An uppercut is the result of this weapon.

    Energy deduction: 25%

      DIRT BALLS
    The weapon, once selected will ACT AND WORK exactly like the Explosive
    Shot Gun. The only difference is, instead of a bullet that explodes, it
    builds a ball of dirt on terrain.

    It can be used to trap the other player, or protection for yourself.

    Energy deduction: N/A

    Next Option: More Options - bring up another panel...

      BRIDGES
    Once selected, control with your mouse or joystick where to place the
    bridge. Use the Right Mouse button to Angle it, or Left mouse button to
    place it.

    Cancel this weapon by pulling it down to the panel. This can be used for
    protection purposes or to help your Beastie cross ditches. If you're
    feeling really evil, you can trap the other player with it!

    Energy deduction: N/A

      BLOW-TORCH
    This will torch horizontally in the direction, carving a cave infront of
    you. Stop at any time by pressing FIRE/SPACE once again - after
    activated.

    Energy deduction: N/A

      DRILL
    Like the Blow-Torch, but drills directly down. Stop at any time again by
    pressing FIRE/SPACE.

    Energy deduction: N/A

      SUPER-JUMPS
    Once selected, press FIRE/SPACE to do a double-height jump. Helpful to
    get over hills, trees, etc.

    Energy deduction: N/A

      SKIP A GO
    Surprisingly, you skip a turn!

      READ BEASTIES II GUIDE FILE
    Brings up this very file that you are reading! 

      QUIT
    Quits back to the main menu

   That is infact it!

   On the main menu options screen, we have the following options available
   to you, the public...


   START GAME:           Well, let's see now...it starts the game!

   ENTER PLAYER'S NAMES: Enter up to 8 Letter names for both players. This
                         will then display your name on the score table,
                         displayed at the end of each game and also during
                         the game, when your turn is about to commence.

   FULL VERSION:         How to get hold of the full game!
                         This option will be "SCORE OPTIONS" in the full
                         game!

   STATISTIC OPTIONS:    Beings up another panel with options, variables to
                         change, such as the amount of energy you start with
                         and the weapon amounts you begin with. Use the left
                         mouse button to add a value and right mouse button
                         to subtract.

   CREDITS:              The most important part of the game, no?

   QUIT:                 Exits back to DOS/Workbench.

Yes indeedy, this game can easily be installed onto your Hard Disk. I have
not written a program to do this for you, mainly because I don't see the
point.

Hard Disk users must know a bit about the CLI/Workbench or they wouldn't be
able to use the damn thing, which means they must also know how to copy
files.  And my dearest, that is all you have to do to install this game onto
your bubbly, luving Hard Disk.

I will let you know the files this game needs to run though...

BeastiesII (Program - executable)

Beasties_Data/
Data1.Bin
Data2.Bin
Data7.Bin (If it exists - depending on your copy: ie. Not essential)
Data8.Bin

Libs:
Diskfont.Library

Fonts:
Courier/11
Courier.Font
Colossal/8
Colossal.font

That is it! Don't forget though, the Docs (.Guide file) should also be
included.
