Yes, it's here...BLITZBOMBERS.

No real instructions have been made, perhaps we'll get round to it one day ;-)

*NOTE*: Sometimes the music won't play. Not sure why - could be to do with
softkicking 3.1, or perhaps having VBR in fast. Try booting up with
no-startup (yes, we know it's a pain, and shouldnt be necessary in this
day and age etc etc) and running from there. No assigns needed.

What the story?
---------------
The game was 99% complete way back in January 1996. Then the bombshell.
Another company, not in the Amiga market, accused us of blatantly
attempting to confuse and deceive the public into believing that
BlitzBombers was one of 'their' games in 'their' line. We could simply
not afford the risk, or legal support to fight them, so for all
intents and purposes, gave up. Now, 2 years later, we've decided
to give the game away, as it was back in 96. There are still some
things we wanted to clean up, fix, add etc, but we're just giving
it away AS-IS. We're sure you'll find flaws, mis-features etc,
but the bottom lines, well...tough. Enjoy what IS there, and we
hope you have many happy hours of fun - that has been the driving
force behind BlitzBombers - to make it as fun as possible. Anyway
enough of this, on with the, ahem, "manual" :-)

Installation :
--------------
You've just installed it my extracting the archive.


Running :
---------
Double-click the game icon. You might want to disable your screenblanker
if you run in a non-15khz screenmode. Also, make sure you have at least
1.6Mb of ChipRAM free. Some FastRAM would be good too.


Usage :
-------
Control the main menu cursor with joystick/cursor keys. Select an option
with fire button. Look in the configurations menus - some explanation
on powerups is given there. You can also diable the 4player adaptor
if you want (if you have a sampler/printer plugged in).


Playing :
---------
BattleGame - a free for all, with no real end
GrudgeMatch - first to win X number of rounds, wins
OnePlayer - for saddos out there with no friends

When going into BattleGame, you'll see 4 TV screens, press FIRE on
your joystick (player 4 can use SHIFT/CURSOR keys) to join in.
When everyone is in, all players can pull DOWN to speed up the countdown.
To add a CPU player, press the player number on the keyboard (1..4)

SubGames - there are 4 (Karts didnt make it)...

BombShoot - aim to shoot all the bombs EXCEPT yours. You'll see a bar
shorten on your bomb when it is shot. If it goes, you're out.

PakAttack - the player who collects the subgame icon is PacMan. All other
players are ghosts, eat the dots and PowerPills(TM)

ShieldSearch - somewhere in the level is a GOLDEN SHIELD. First one
to find it wins.

Tag - one players is IT. They should pass IT on to another player before
their timer runs out. Last one standing wins.

Whoever wins a subgame gets to inflict a PowerUP on all the other players.
(not all powerups are available though).

CD32 pad owners can press pause to bring up a menu. Non-pad owners
can press (I think) P...could be wrong though. Oh, press W to flip
back to workbench.

Last word - Red When Excited own and retain full copyright on BlitzBombers.
It is freely distributable, but must NOT be altered or sold for profit.
Magazines/Aminet have our permission to put BlitzBombers unaltered on
their CDs.

The game has not been tested on 060 - please let us know how you
get on.

Umm, that's it really. Enjoy!
