THIS IS SHORT MESSAGE FROM THE AUTHOR!



COMPABILITY
-----------

This is two player combat game for Amiga, G-ROCKER. It was never finished
but was made pretty ready. The project was finally dumped as I moved from
Amiga to PC (but I still think Amiga is a dream computer compared to PC!).
This is probably the last Amiga-version of the game, v0.97.


G-Rocker SHOULD work (not guaranteed) on all Amigas with at least 1MB of
memory and KickStart 1.3. It is 100% assembler and was developed with
Amiga 500, 52MB HD, 3MB RAM. You can only select scenes for which you have
enough free memory! Right mouse button during game quits to DOS (this is
just a debugging feature).

G-Rocker uses overscan, and due to technical restrictions, there may be
some problems with screen position. On TV:s (where screen position can
rarely be adjusted) display may appear quite left. I would have made
wider overscan if hardware didn't disable some sprites. For more info
just contact me!

NOTE! Directory G-Rocker is run from MUST be assigned as Rocker:

      Assign G-Rocker: PATH:

      Where PATH: is the path to your G-Rocker directory. If you play
      from floppy disk, it is easy to just name you disk as 'G-Rocker'.


CONTROLS
--------

In-game keys :

 Arrow Keys - Control blue ship
Right Shift - Same as joystick button for blue ship
        ESC - Aborts game and returns to main menu
          P - Pauses game

Red ship is always controlled with joystick in port 2. Blue ship can be
controlled with joystick in port 1 or with keyboard. Fire accelerates, up
shoots and down shoots special shots. While landed on own landing site,
down gives control panel.


CONTACT
-------

There's a little chance for new versions of Amiga-Rocker, but PC-version
is currently being developed. Still, if I get some compability problem
reports on different Amiga setups, I may consider fixing some bugs... If
you have any comments, questions or anything else (preferably related to
programming Amiga or PC, but everything will be read ), you can contact
