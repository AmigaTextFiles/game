                  MURDER HAS NEVER BEEN SO MUCH FUN!
                            (Or?..  Naaa!)

Introduction...
---------------------------------------------------------------
      The year is 2045, and the prisons in the world are getting crowded with 
  hardened criminals. Until now the guards and the prisoners often had a
  game in secret where two of the prisoners meet with weapons and slay each
  other. The winner was released, or he was helped to escape. The guards bet
  money, drank beer and laughed at the tournament.

      Recently the government got hang of what they were doing at nights
  (don't get me wrong here... ;), and after a bit of discussion, they decided 
  to legalize the killing. Altought they changed it a bit... The fighters now
  begin in a maze, with weapons from the 2000-century, and limited ammo
  (before this change they carried the guards wepaons, mzr-10's, a deadly
  lazerrifle with 85 MW effect!) And as a final touch, and probably to make
  some money, they will broadcast it on televison (yes, they still have
  tellys in the future, even tought they don't look like nowadays).

  And its here you get in...  (I think you know what to do... :-)

  Player 1, kill player 2!
  Player 2, kill player 1!
  Action!

  Brutal Homicide is a game for two players, each player is awarded one
  half of the screen.  I'd better say this in the beginning, and I will
  advise it more, TO GET FULL PLEASURE OF THIS GAME, TAPE A BOOK, PIZZABOX,
  OR ANYTHING TO DIVIDE THE MONITIOR IN TWO HALFES.  When you can see what
  the other player is upto it mostly spoils the fun and the whole idea of
  radars is rather useless, whats the point in buying a radar and
  then your pal can look on your radar without buying one of his own?




  
  The playfield looks someting like this:

  +---+---------+
  |PL1|         |
  |---+         |
  |             |
  |         +---|
  |         |PL2|
  +---------+---+

  The rest is an wild jungle of brick walls.  On the beginning of each round
  both players get three lives, two grenades, twentyfive bullets and one
  first-aid kit. These items can be found in their basecamp.

  Scattered in the maze there are more usefull items, and also items you dont
  want to touch; mines. As expected they blow you hard, 48 units its the cost
  in energy if you do it...

  Each player has as mentioned three lifes, and each life represents 96
  units of energy. If you step on a mine that will cost you 48 units, a
  pistol shot 8 and a shotgun blast will make 32 units of damage. A Lazer?
  It will blow you to hell (heaven?) immedately!

  That's the basics...


Installation, problems. etc..
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This game needs about 660kB of chipmem and like 500kB chip or fast.
  And at least an MC68000 processor...
  Now i know that you want to play it, so the game is'nt hard to install
  either. As you must have decrunched this archive, you HAVE installed it!

  If you're a diskdrive user you can start it by first typing...

  1.Empty:> cd brutalhomicide
  1.Empty:BrutalHomicide> BH1971
 
  BH1971 beeing the main file of the game. Just make sure you're in the
  root of the directory `brutalhomicide' when running it, or you'll get file-
  error msgs.

  All files the game uses lies in the 'brutaldata' drawer. It must be in
  the same dir as the BH197 file in order for it to run.
  If some file could'nt be loaded it will display a message. It will also
  display a message if you are short on memory. If you have 1 Mb chip only,
  then im sorry, but you cant play this. Otherwise it should work fine.

  This particular version of the game has been tested on:

  A1200
  A1200 with 8 Mb Fast and 68030mmu



Controlling
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The playfield is seen from birdview, and you control your prisoner with
  joysticks in port 1&2. The button is used to fire your current weapon.
  Autofire is not needed. You can acess the menu by pressing right&left
  amiga/shift buttons (see: the player menu).
  If you have a joystick with two buttons you can acess the menu with your
  second button. 'P' can be pressed to pause the game.

  If Esc is pressed during the play, the round is a draw, no one gets money
  and both players are in the shop again. If you press Pause and then Esc
  you're back to the mainscreen again.


The Config Screen
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  In the config screen you can decide what enviroment (jungle, stone, waste or
  random), what robot to play against or number of rounds.
     To change rounds etc. the joystick left/right must be used (see the arrows
  on the flashing icons). If you want to leave this screen go to the
  bottom icon and press fire.
  Use of the mazetypes 'heavy' and 'chaos' should only be by experienced
  players as these often tend to get very tough, especially 'heavy'...



The Shop
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Between the matches each player gets an oppurtunity to buy weapons, radars
  ammo etc, in a shop. The shop is divided into two screens so if you have
  your pizzabox between you and your mate, you can't see if he has bought a
  lazer or an extreme radar. In other words, you don't know what to expect!

 Buying and selling
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  In each players upper window are the items listed that he can buy, often
  by price/power. You controll a flashing bar (cursor) and if you attempt
  to go under the window with it, it will turn into a button! The button now
  point at the item you wanna sell. You always get half the price when you
  sell something..

 Exiting the shop
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  At the bottom button theres a sign which says exit. If you press it your
  button will cease to flash and when both players have pressed, the shop is
  exited.
  If you change your mind after you've pressed exit you just have to move
  the cursor to break the state. Not to hard eh?

 What's This 'Bout Weapons?
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  The 9 weapons are listed at the top of the window. When you begin you just
  have your shitty pistol, which is'nt listed in the store (only an idiot
  would like to BUY a pistol!). Upgrade!
  Here is a complete overview of the weapons, you'll soon find a favorite...
  Impactdamage is the power that the weapon attacks with. You die instantly
  when impactdamage reaches >96.

   Pistol
   ~~~~~~
  Standard equipment for the warriors, low on damage and a huge reload
  time. Trash this one as soon you get the cash. Costs 1000$ if anyone
  care, you will get 500$ for it when you sell it.
  Impactdamage: 8

   Rifle
   ~~~~~
  Better than the pistol, but it still has'nt got a decent reload
  time. Does twice the damage compared to a pistol tought.
  Impactdamage: 16

   ShotGun
   ~~~~~~~
  FOUR times more damage than the pistol, but with a high reload. The most
  powerfull bullet weapon in the game. Sometimes, you can make more damage
  due to the spreading of bullets. Not to costy either. Runs on regular ammo
  (four shots a time).
  Impactdamage: 32-64

   Uzi
   ~~~
  Now you're talking! A weapon really impressive on reload and damage.
  If you perfer fast killing, this is your gun. cheap, and effecive...
  Impactdamage: 16

   Bazooka
   ~~~~~~~
  Rocket launcher with powerful ammo.  The "small" 112mm warhead just
  causes a heavy explosion at contact with players, walls, parents etc.
  This warhead blows through walls instantly and each shot only costs
  100$ so its five times cheaper than grenades and much more convinient.
  A very good tactic is to carry this as your first weapon and just fire
  at the walls when you get to a new stage. Much faster than planting a
  grenade, and you dont have to  wait or run away from it! This is the
  perfect second weapon, it can kill players and open walls. And
  it can be made a very dangerous allrounder for a price. But unless
  you have a regular gun ready in the backpack you are almost certain
  doomed, because of the reload time! (one second)
  Impactdamage: 48

   AK50
   ~~~~
  A further development of the famous AK4, AK44 and AK5. This rifle has an
  extraordinary high poweroutput for its size, alas the reload is lower
  than its littlebrother, the uzi. But it is still better. A real killer..
  Impactdamage: 24

   MiniGun
   ~~~~~~~
  A gun for all BIG boys... BAM-BAM-BAM! It has'nt got any reloadtime,
  and you kill your friend in a mather of seconds. Very good and rather
  cheap if you compare with the other heavy guns. Buy much ammo together
  with it! It consumes huge amounts! We have killed lazergun owners
  serveral times with a minigun. Soft sound effect! The true
  allrounder rifle.
  Impactdamage: 16

   DS-32
   ~~~~~
  This weapon is the most destructive in the game. It fires a large rocket
  which explodes like a handynuke. This is effective when the opponent is
  behind a wall and you can't hit him. You have to be carefull with it, you
  can easily kill your self if you are too close to the impact. Very
  effective with sometype of smartradar..
  Impactdamage: about 300-800

   M-177
   ~~~~~
  This is an nice weapon, it is an combined Bazooka-AK50. If you press fire
  fast and let go, a missile will be launched. If you hold the button down
  for longer time, AK50 fire will be activated. Its a perfect secondweapon
  for the lazergunner, or P70-sniper. The ammotype you've used last is
  displayed in the window. In the shop, you can swich types by pressing the
  button SWAP AMMOVIEW. Bazooka booster affects the reload, and you can
  shot fast by using autofire or pressing your self.
  The drawback is its price, and the fact that the fire controlls get a
  bit sluggish, you have to wait a while before it starts to fire.
  Impactdamage: As Bazooka and AK50

   LazerGun
   ~~~~~~~~
  Huge Laserbeams pump out from your deadly lazergun. When you get hold
  of this weapon you better see to it that you have money for the batteries
  to. You will need one gun and atleast one battery (power cell). 12000$
  is the cost for that package. One cell is good for 10 shots, and you
  kill your friend with one blow. You can carry more than one cell at a
  time. A lazerbeam, traveling at 300.000 km/s obviously moves faster than
  a bullet. Great for surprise attacks! When fired at a player it just cuts
  through him. Really cool...
  A lazer beam can travel through walls very short distances. Try shooting
  trough a sharp corner for example (the other player wont know what hit him!)
  Take care tought: If you run out of ammo on the level you are dead unless
  you have another weapon, because batteries can't be found, and the reloadtime
  is huge. A skilled player may even kill you with an smartradar and a minigun!
  (so you had better surprise him first!)
  Impactdamage: 768

   SRT-P70
   ~~~~~~~~
  The P70 is a new experimantal weapon, just developed by the military.
  The special bullets are transparent and just stops if they run into
  a player or when they turn solid, which is after some distance. The
  sensoring is done by both bodyheat and CDD (Cell Detecting Device). With
  the weapon comes a jammersuit, which prevents you from being a target.
  They carry a smaller amount of highly venomous HN-35 which is sprayed
  from the shot at impact. This poison will damage the target with 8
  about each second, when he is moving... When the enemy stands still the
  effects are slowed and just gives random damage. The impact it self
  will damage him by 32. The poisoning effect will dissapear when the
  victim picks up a first-aid or dies...
  Speed is equal in air and in walls. They travel over an area of half
  total screen. Only strong tactic for a P70 owner is to stay a bit away
  from the enemy. And fire in angles 90° and 45°; You need a radar.
  When you hit him, run away and wait for him to die... :)
  (Want to be extra nasty? Take all first-aid packs you see...;^)

  Impactdamage: 32 (8 constant <1 second after that, when he moves)

  (If you want to kill a P70 owner get a lazer and a radar real fast and
  a couple of turbo sticks is'nt too bad either. Or get a P70 you too!
  Tactic: Stay out of straight angles especially 90° 180° 360° 0°. Then
  surpise him and shot him in his ass! You can fool him to fire in the air
  by running fast in his shooting-field.)

   C45-Guided Rockets
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  This weapon fires one shot, with the same size as an bazooka charge. The
  only difference is that you controll it. It will fly ower the walls and
  detonate on your friend when passing by. Ofcourse, you cannot controll both
  the player and the rocket at the sametime and you get very wounerable.
  If you press fire again when a rocket is in the air you loose controll over
  it and you're back on steering the player.
     When you are the lucky owner of your C45-rocket guider, you can't stand
  very close to the enemy, the best way is to jam the other radar and hide
  some where in the terrain, as far away as possible, and always keep an eye
  on your radar to see if the enemy is close.
  The C45 is not a stand-alone weapon. You may be defeated with a bazbooster
  and roundturbo player.
  
  Impactdamage: 48

   IntenseLazer
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~
  The mainproblem with the lazergun is a) the reload time and b) the cost.
  This gun solves both these problems. It's powered by U-235, the same kind
  used in nuclearpowerplants. This gives much more energy than a battery
  and U-235 is rather cheap nowadays, due to the big U-235 mines on Mars.
  Each charge comes in a thick lead casing and when inserted in a intenselazer
  it begins to glow. A charge is good for 20 shots and the price is just
  100$ each shot. The reload is also very acceptable, about the same as an
  boosted bazooka. The shots are shorter and a bit weaker than a lazer shots.
  The only drawback this weapon has is its cost.
  
  Impactdamage: 384


 Weapon 1->2
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Very usefull if you don't like the order your weapons are in. Normaly, you
  want to have a bazooka as your 1st weapon. If you press this button the
  weapons will switch places and you can put the in a desireable order.


 Swapping Weapons
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  You may carry two weapons at a time, one in hand, ready to fire, and one in
  the backpack. The signs 'weapon 1' and 'weapon 2' in the shop screen shows
  what weapon you currently have.
  If you buy a new weapon the old one will be transferred to weapon 2, and the
  old weapon 2 will be sold. If you sell your weapon 1, your weapon 2 (if you
  have one) will be transferred to weapon 1. Weapon 2 will become 'none'.
  (You can sell both your weapons and enter battle but then you won't stand
  a chance, unless the other player is just as stupid!)


 Buying Ammo
 ~~~~~~~~~~~
  Ammo is sold in different packs. The bigger the packs the cheaper the ammo.
  Always try to buy as big pack you can. If you sell ammo, you sell in rounds
  of 100 or if you have less than 100 in 10's (?). You only get 1$
  for each shot.
      Ammo can be used to every weapon except the bazooka, P70, lazer,
  intenselazer and c45. They require special ammo. In a special box over the
  menu, the name of the weapon will be viewed as you pass by with the cursor.

      The icons 'Ammo 1' and 'Ammo 2' is the amount of ammo each weapon has.
  If both weapons use the same ammo, then the same ammo is written twice,
  so it looks like you have double the amount as ammo 1 and 2 say the
  samething.

 Grenades
 ~~~~~~~~
  Grenades are usefull items in this game. They can blow thru walls and
  hurt players in one blow. You always get grenades to start with, two as
  a matter of fact, so it could be useless to buy more than 7 (7+2=9=max).
  You may only carry 9 grenades.

 Radars
 ~~~~~~
  Radars are effective trackingdevices for players, goods and walls.
  The more advanced contain very sofisticated electronics and are very
  expensive for that reason.
  Here is a list of the avalible radars and their uses:
  
  (NOTE: If you have a VERY bad TV-set with bad picture, you may not be able
  to see the walls and so the smart/extreme radars are useless...)

   Plain Radar
   ~~~~~~~~~~~
  The plain radar just shows the players position in the maze. Nothing
  special about it, in other words. It's a cheap radar, so it helps
  much, get it if you have money left.
  This radar can view the y18 robot.

   Smart Radar
   ~~~~~~~~~~~
  A Smart radar can execpt displaying players also view walls! This is a
  real advantage for the owner, as the maze is different each round. This
  allows him to effectivly sneek up on his enemy or run away from him.
  This radar views both the y18 and z40 robots.

   Extreme Radar
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Is a radar so extreme it handles all of the above, and with the power-
  full addition to be able to locate items! Money, First aid packs, Ammo
  etc. will be dotted in the radar screen. But the price is so high you
  won't be able to buy this so soon.
  All robots are visible on this radar

   Radar upgrade
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  A little circut to place in your radar, it will enable it to show mines!
  Very usefull when you have a telly. Works on every radar and stays in
  if you buy a new one. You CAN learn to see the mines but it is hard when
  you go turboing through the labby (or was that lobby...?!)!
  This item can't be sold in this version.

 What is what on the radar?
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Different dots have different meenings. Here is a list:

  Light Pink (fast flashing)                 Player1
  Light Yellow (fast flashing)               Player2
  Grey                                       Walls
  White (stationed)                          Mines
  Light Blue (Slow blinking)                 Usefull items
  Black                                      Ground
  White (moving)                             Robot
  

 Different Items in the shop
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


  AMMO + EXPLOSIVES MENU
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  GRENADE 

  Grenade - very common, use it to blow walls. Essential, and you
  get two at your camp every round.


  AMMO 10
 
  Very small package of ammo. Buy this when you don't need the money.
  Single shot price is high; 5$!


  AMMO 100

  Acceptable pack of ammo.
  Single shot price is 4$


  AMMO 500

  Very big pack of ammo. Mostly used for the Uzi and Minigun.
  Single shot price is at 3$


  HANDY NUKE

  Like a big grenade, causing a deadly explosion over a big area. You may
  carry three at a time. Extremly powerfull and leaves green, gloving
  radioactive dust after the explosion. This dust will damage players by
  8 each second. Place a nukie at your pals base! They will loose energy
  each time they return! Be prepared for some serious effects when it
  detonates tought!


  POWER CELL

  Power cells for the lazer. Good for 10 shots.


  U235 CELL

  A stick of U235 for the IntenseLazer, it will give 20 shots.


  3-P70 SHOTS

  Three shots for the P70 supergun. With 0.4 oz of HN-35, a venomous chemical,
  and will slowly and ofcourse painfully kill your enemy!


  5-MISSILES

  Five missiles for the bazooka. Very cheep compared to grenades.


  3-GUIDEROCKETS

  Three high power controlable mega rockets for the C45-launcher.

 
  GIGANUKE

  Causes an incredible big explosion, erasing about 2/3 of the playfield.
  You carry it in the backpack and when you use it a giganuke will be placed
  on the screen. Remaining in the backpack is the remote trigger, and when
  you use it (it looks like an big explosion) we can all guess what happens...
  NOTE: if you blow a giganuke with a grenade, it will be ruined, but the
        detonate icon will still be displayed. 
  TIPS: place it close to you enemys base, wait for him to die and... baaang!


  MIXED ITEMS MENU
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  C45 DOTVIEW

  If you own a C45 weapon and a radar this could come in handy. When you
  fire, you can see the bullet on the radar screen as it moves, and can
  guide it where ever you want.


  BAZOOKA BOOSTER

  If you own a bazooka, this is a very powerfull upgrade. It will make it
  possible to launch missiles at fast rate, and then reload very fast. 
  Dangerous, but need much ammo, and is'nt for free either...
  If you decide to sell your bazooka and have a booster in it, the booster
  will be sold at the same time, for half price ofcourse!

  
  60-TURBO

  Like an usual turbostick, makes you run in 60 seconds or until killed
  from the start of the round.

  
  ROUNDTURBO

  Very powerfull item to own, it will give you the aid of speed during all
  the round, no matter how may times you die! 


  RADAR JAMMER

  Onething that really can fuck up a P70 or an C45 owner with an plain radar
  is this item. During the round, the radar will be jammed. If an smart radar
  is jammed the walls will disapear. The extreme radar is'nt affected.

 
  BULLET FORCE

  Halves the damage given by bullet weapons, bazookas, miniguns,
  guidedmissiles. It will absorb a total of 512 units before it will break.
  It won't give any protection from lazer weapons.


  10-HOLOGRAM

  This item is carried in the backpack and when used it will create an exact
  copy of your current look. This can be done 10 times so there will be a
  great crowd of 'you'. When you're standing still, no one can determine by
  looking at you if its a hologram or real. If the enemy has a radar the
  idea is useless, so be sure to jam it.
  NOTE: Don't place holograms when you are immortal or bleeding, they won't
  look any good...


  2-CAMONUKES

  These items are carried in the backpack and when used, it will become some
  nice item; money, extralife, turbo etc. and when someone grabs it, it will
  explode like a nuke! Nice way of killing your enemy as well as humiliate
  him at the sametime!
  NOTE: Don't put out camonukes if you are bleeding, if theres blood on it
  the other may suspect something.


  2-INVISIBLE

  Another backpack related item. When used the player who used it will
  dissapear completly from the screen and from all radars execept the
  extreme radar. When the player moves he will be visible. The robots
  still sees an invisible person, but no bullet will harm him, still
  the robot can crush him. This item is great for surprise attacks.
  NOTE: If you shoot when you are invisible, the shot won't be visible
  either, so start moving before you fire..
  NOTE2: Now (v1.96) you can hit an invisible player and he starts bleeding.


RADARS AND SPY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  SPY KIT
 
  Electronic device to "spy" on the opponent. A lamp in the panel with
  the sign 'SPY' to the right will show his status as..

  Green    -> much energy.
  Yellow   -> medium-low energy.
  Red      -> No ammo or little energy or poisoned by a P70 shot.

  Very usefull with a radar so you can keep away while he has good health,
  and go hunt him when he has no ammo!


  ANGLE WARNER
   
  When you own a spykit, this little cheap circut can be used.
  It will warn the player if he is standing in 90° or 45° angle to the
  enemy. This is good when the enemy has ex. an SRT-P70 or if you your
  self have it.
  

  RADAR JAMMER

  An standard radar jammer, it will total jam the plain radar and ruin
  the walls on a smart radar, but it won't touch the exterme radar.
  It will last one round and is especially good for pissing P70 or C45
  owners off.


  BLACKOUT JAMMER

  This is a powerfull jammer that makes the jammed radar show nothing.
  It will appear as if he had'nt bought a radar at all.


At The Arena
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  As soon both players leave the shop, the computer will start calculating
  the maze, this wont take more than one second. During this time a screen
  is displayed, with current player's score. When both players has pressed
  fire, a countdown will start and each player begins in opposite corner.
  The basecamp is bouilt of metall bricks for some reason. At the start of
  a round, both players get following:

  25 Rounds of Ammo
  2  Grenades
  1  First Aid

  If you hav'nt any grenades when you begin you won't get far in the maze
  so therefor are the grenades enclosed. 25 Rounds are also guaranteed.
  As you wont be hurt when you start you better conserve your first aid
  till later, watch out though, the other player may make a little wisit 
  at your camp... It's often safest to pick your first aid in the backpack
  from the beginning, if you're not carrying anything else ofcourse.


 Doors
 ~~~~~
  The automatic doors can only be opened by the player that beginns in that
  base. The doors sensors lie in the ground so if you block them by planting
  a grenade, dying or something simular, the door won't sense you, and thus
  not open. But there's always the backdoor ofcourse...


 The Walls
 ~~~~~~~~~
  All walls are destructible by any weapon. A wall in the jungle has not
  as much energy as an wall in the wasteland, which has less energy than
  a wall in the stoneland. Average lies at:

   700   in the jungle
   1500  in wastelands
   2400  in stoneland



 The Player Menu
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Both players have a menu at their panel. It is four icons, a grenade,
  a gun, a nuke and an empty one. To access the menu, press the shift button
  that corrosponds to your window or press your second joy button is you have
  one. The first square will flash.

  In this version you are enabled to use the F-Keys! This means that
  player 1(left window) has keys F1-F4, for these icons and F5 cancels the
  choice. Player two has the other F-keys. You will no doublt find
  them usefull...

  Pressing fire...
  ...at first square adapts a grenade.
  ...at second square toggles your weapons
  ...at third square adapts a nukie
  ...at fourth square uses the backpacked item (if any).

  To unselect the menu, press menu button one more time at last square, and
  the flash has dissapeared (Or just press F5 (F10 for player 2)).



 Who are these robots?
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  In this new version you can choose one of three different kinds of robots
  to hunt you. The robots start in the middle of the maze in a special room.
  When you kill a robot you get money, the more dangerous robot the more money
  will you recieve when you kill him. Here are the types...


  Y-18
  ~~~~
  He is a real idiot compared to his brothers, but he can still prove a
  callange for players without lazers. He has 640 units of energy and uses
  an uzi with damage 16. He moves in the same speed as the players but
  in random. He also has a simple radar system, he can spot players infront
  of him or behind him, even trough walls.
  You recive 2000$ when he is killed.

  Z-40
  ~~~~
  This guy is really dangerous. He has 800 units of energy and uses a power-
  minigun cannon, which means 32 units damage! He can sense players and tries
  to get as close as possible.
  You get 3000$ when killing him.

  Cf-100
  ~~~~~~
  The master, he has the same features as z-40, but he is has a better range
  on his scanners, 1280 units of energy, and an dual-action-turbo-lazercannon. 
  (832 damage!). He has a turbocharger and he uses it move in dualspeed to for 
  about 15 seconds. The turbocharger loads to full in 40-50 seconds.
  He is especially dangerous in the jungleworld where the walls break easily,
  and he is said to have one camonuke to place too, but no one knows...
      You better be warned, you will have a hard time killing him but not
  so hard getting killed by him. You'll have no chance unless you have a
  lazerweapon of some sort...
  You get 4000$ for killing him.


 Items
 ~~~~~
  The land is'nt very clean in this place. There's much dirt lying on the
  ground and the walls are often cracked by some earlier war.
  The area might hide other things as fuel-depoes... Try fireing at one!
 
  At on the ground are various items. If you can't pickup an grenade or
  claymore, is it's because you already are carrying maximum nr of items.
  The mainmenu screen 'info screen' will give you more information on
  the items.
 
  Boxes with an 'A' on is ammo and each box contain 25 rounds, there are
  also an 50-pack with two boxes in each square.

  A greywhite stick is the turbo item, it will double your speed for 60
  seconds. If you take serveral in a row, you will run one minute longer
  each stick.
 
  A red/white/grey stick turns you immortal to shots for 20 seconds.
  Look on your radar and see if your enemy is close before you take this
  and then attack.

  A little bag with some goldcoins in contains 425$.

  A big pile of yellow are many goldcoins.. worth: 1500$! Rare item.

  The 1up sign speaks for it self, it awards you with an additional life,
  and is rather rare.

  A grey box is a handy nuke. It used like a grenade but has 40 times more
  power. You may only carry three at a time. And you can't walk over an
  adapted handy nuke, like with a grenade...

  There is a white ball with a question sign on it. If you take it
  you may get one of the above (And you may die aswell)...
  Sometimes it just explodes hurting you..


 Dying...
 ~~~~~~~~
  When you for some reason die, a countdown will start on your screen with
  very big numbers. Then you're at your basecamp again. If you have been
  having a firefight with your mate you will find corpses and blood, that
  can sometimes help you retrace your steps. If you plant a handy nuke and
  don't get away you will die immedately. And if you don't get away from a
  grenade, it will cost you half of your energy. Sometimes lethal...

  When you get killed by your mate, he gets 500$ + a random of 250$.
  The winner of each round get 1500$ (the loser gets 350$).
  The winner also recives a bonus of 250$ for each life he has left.
  If a player gets blown away by a nuke or a grenade the other player
  will not get any money, unless he winns by killing him.

Hints & Tips
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Different situaitions, and what to do about them...

  You are gavely hurt, almost no energy left, and you have already used up
  your basecamp-aid. If you can't find any on the stage go to your friends
  camp, in hope of that he has'nt used his aid. If he has, just try to sneek
  up on him shooting a few bullets in his back and then run, before he knows
  what hit him (requires radar usually).
  Or do the most common; the suicide attack, and try to get him to loose as
  much energy as possible. You will probably die, and next life go kill him!

  A common problem for all us Rambo dudes is lack of ammo. If you run out of
  ammo your only chance of survival is to retrive more ammo on the level.
  If you are using weapons with special ammo, lack of it often means death...
  And don't scream 'Oh, shit im out of ammo!', but you might have figured that
  out by your self...

  When the ground expoldes under you there was a burried mine there. These
  are as common as usual mines, but harder to find. There's just a little
  more dirt where they lie. The Radar Upgrade is usefull to.

  Another tactic is to sell one life each round and save the money for
  something expensive. If you own a rifle and your enemy a lazer, sell
  all your lives and save the money for a lazer too!

  If you carry maximum handy nukes and find one more, place a grenade besides
  the nuke. The grenade will blow the item to dust and prevent your pal to
  get it. This works with all items, and you can use nukes instead
  of grenades.

  If you are poisoned by a P70 shot and know that there's no medicide around,
  you can commit suicide by planting a nuke or a grenade on your self. Then
  the other player won't get any money for killing you!

Next Version, Final Words
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  And any damage caused by this game is not my responsabillity, if you go
  insane by playing it, am i to blame?! It had no viruses when it was released
  and it is not a trojanhorse either. No write access is done to any unit.
  It come's without any guarantees!

  The idea of Brutal Homicide was born sometime in the early winter of 1994,
  by Dr.M / Cryozone and Ash. We started, and have worked on and off under
  sometime now (we did'nt touch it during spring). Also thanx to the people
  on Fidonet who helpt me with small problems.
  Especially the keyboardhandler i got (sometime ago) by Henrik Bergström.
  Thanx anyway!

  Some files were packed with StoneCracker 4.10.3. Great packer, saved me lot
  of bytes. The game also uses this packer for internal packed gfx.
  Thanx Mr. Spiv!

  Stay tuned!!! Brutal Homicide II will be released in early 1998 or to the
  christmas sales of 1997 at best, and here's a brief collection of the
  main features;

   * Gamedisplay is 256 colours, smoothly shaded in 7 levels of light.

   * Ingame fx like; nervegas, darkareas, flashlights, explosions and
     fire brings light to the area. Street lights light the levels.

   * 170k ingame samples, external packets availible for download with
     megabytes of voicespeeches for almost every occation. (Using fast/chip
     swapping for sound data).

   * Beautiful cut screens with nude women
     (perhaps not... but they are great, the screens that is. :) :)

   * 2 or 1 player game action in serveral diffiucultg levels.

   * Supporting fast CPU and RAM, utilizing the maximum performance your
     favorite computer has to offer.

   * Kickass weapons, for close combat or long distance struggles.

   * Reworked gameplay system (actually everything is reworked for the 
     better)

   * And yes! She starts from an Workbench in 64 colours, no extreme chipmem
     usage is present.


  Thanx to all my playtesters (and their ideas)(could'nt be translated)....

  Andreas             "Sådär kan man ju inte göra!"
  Silvio              "Fan."

  We've worked a pretty long time on this game, and i think the least you can
  do is to write and tell me what you think about it, maybe including some 
  ideas, or buggreports... This will encourage us to make further versions.
