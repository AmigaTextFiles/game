This game is a very brutal one indeed, in the true spirit of public domain
(even tought it is NOT public domain!).

To install and run, decrunch the archive (which you have done) and click
on the icon. Noting more to it, lamers! :)
You can also run it by typing bh197 when you are in the brutalhomicide dir.

IF YOU ARE GOING TO PLAY THIS GAME AND GET FULL PLEASURE OF IT, TAPE
A BIT OF CARDBOARD, A BOOK OR A PIZZA BOX ON THE MONITOR TO DIVIDE IT, ONE
SIDE FOR EACH PLAYER!
I'm sorry about that this pizza box could'nt go in the archive, but
i think you have _something_ simular at your home!


I recommend you to read the manual as there are many things to be explained.
But go ahead and try it out first!
