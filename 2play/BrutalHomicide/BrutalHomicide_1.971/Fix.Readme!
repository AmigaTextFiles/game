!FIXED!
I left a serious bug conserning the robot in the game. You simply could'nt
turn it of, and the controlls only really worked when you used 'LEVEL' in
robottype.

It's a shame such a bug is left, 'cause many people allready complained about
how tough the robots are to beat. Sorry, but I dont playtest the game
especially hard due to that I'm the last Amiga owner overhere.. But when I
finaly got to play it one day with a friend, the bug was screaming in my
face.

Sorry gamers.
