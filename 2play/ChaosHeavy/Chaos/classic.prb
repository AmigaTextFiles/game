# This file contains the spell probability table for Chaos by
# Sean A. Irvine and James Conwell.
#
# It is recommended that you do not alter this file without first making
# a backup copy of the file. When altering the file please heed the
# warnings below; failure to do so could result in Chaos crashing.
# If you are not confident at altering text files, this is probably
# not a good place to practice.
#
# Anything appearing after a # in this file is treated as a comment
# when Chaos loads this file. The file is read once at the start of the
# game, so please DO NOT delete the comments in an attempt to make the
# game faster.
#
# There is a line for each spell in the game. The order of the lines is
# significant and should not be altered. Each line consists of a spell
# probability and the name of the spell (the names are only included
# for your convenience and are not used by the program). Only integer
# probabilities in the range -100 to 100 are permissible. Failure to
# adhere to this range could result in crashes. Spells with negative
# probabilities are only available through meditation. A spell with
# probability -100 would represent a very common spell, but one
# only obtainable by mediation. A spell with 0 probability will
# never appear on spell lists. Thus, for instance, if you hate the
# cloaked creatures you can set the Cloak spell to 0 and then
# no one will ever get a cloak spell. Each number must start as the
# very first thing on a line.
#
# The lines marked with * are not proper spells (e.g. real wizards)
# and must have probability zero. Do not under any circumstance
# alter a line marked with *. Failure to adhere to this rule
# may result in crashes.
#
# Be aware that it is easy to ruin the game by making powerful spells
# like demons and turmoils common. In my experience once you cheat
# at a game much of the original enjoyment you get from the game
# is lost.
#
# Developers: Note this file is produced automatically by the
# Spell Manager and changes in probabilities for future release must
# be made in the corresponding spell file and not here.
