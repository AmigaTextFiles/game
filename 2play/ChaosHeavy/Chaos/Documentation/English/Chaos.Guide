Overview
========

   This is a mythical strategy game for up to eight human and/or
computer players. It is a game of justice and vengeance, of good versus
evil, of life versus death, of light versus shadow, as a group of
wizards battle ferociously to exterminate their opponents and achieve
world domination.

   If you dare to compete, you will be faced with beasts of all
descriptions, from everyday animals like horses and lions; to monsters
of hideous proportions, from fire-breathing multi-headed pyrohydras to
extremely dangerous dragons that sail through the air hunting their
favorite food -- you. Creatures from the spirit world are also in
abundance; you may even meet the devil himself. Say your prayers if you
do.

   You will experience the most cataclysmic natural disasters ever to
occur in the course of human history. You may be drowned in swift-moving
floodwaters, burned beyond recognition in raging uncontrolled
hellfires, or be swallowed up by the very Earth itself in horrific
earthquakes.

   With your own eyes you will witness corpses rising from the dead to
rejoin the battle. You will be struck with terror as your army succumbs
to massive piles of green slime and purple fungi. Even the humble tree
is not always what it seems.

   Your army is not restricted to man alone. Your forces will be filled
out with orcs, elves, ogres, and a host of other races. You will
doubtless send many of these creatures to a premature death as they
blindly follow your every command. Only those wizards who use the
strategy of a Perfect General, possess the bloodlust of a Warlord, make
effective use of their Hired Guns and have the zeal to build an Empire
will triumph in the end.

   You will utilize and be subjected to some of the most powerful magic,
sorcery, and necromancy known to the human mind. You may be cursed,
drained, and infected with disease. You may disappear into the ethereal
plane or vanish into a timewarp. You will twist time, garble gravity,
and rip holes in space as you criminally violate all the laws of
physics with the unbridled arrogance of the dictatorial tyrant you
really are.

   You will cause untold destruction of a once pristine environment as
you destroy entire forests on a whim, saturate the air with
foul-smelling toxic fumes and unleash the apocalyptic fury of nuclear
devastation on all who oppose you.

   The grapes of wrath never tasted so good.

   To survive, you must strike a fine balance between defending your
wizard and attacking the other wizards. Only one wizard can rule the
world, but it can be a long time in coming, with up to eight wizards
chasing the same goal. Furthermore, the wizards may lose control of
their powerful magic and suffer the dreaded fate of mutual
annihilation; forever cleansing the world of disruptive magic!

System requirements
===================

   Versions 2.5 and below may be played on any Amiga with 1 megabyte of
ram and OS 1.2 or higher. Yes, even if you have an old 1985 A1000 with
Kickstart 1.2 you can play this great game so long as you have 1 meg or
more of ram.

   The authors went to great lengths and much trouble to ensure
compatiblity with all the old Amigas. We hope you enjoy the fruits of
our labors.

   Version 2.5 is the LAST version that will work on any Amiga with 1
meg of ram. ALL versions above 2.3d require at least 2 megs of ram, a
hard drive, at least OS 1.2 or higher and a Motorola 68000 CPU or
higher.

   2.5d = demo version. 2.5f = full version which only registered users
can obtain. The demo version cannot load games, and stops at turn 18.

   Chaos 2.6 will work under at least Workbench 1.2, 1.3, 2.04, 3.0 and
3.1 and should work on anything subsequent. It requires an Amiga
supporting PAL mode. All Amigas manufactured since 1989 support PAL
mode. Any Amiga manufactured before 1989 supports PAL mode if it has
been upgraded with an enhanced Agnes chip. (Enhanced Denise chip not
needed).

   Version 2.71 is the LAST version that will work with an OS less than
3.0

   Version 2.81 and up all require a 68020 processor or higher and OS
3.0 or higher.

   If you live in the USA or Canada then you'll need to boot your
computer into PAL mode. The best way to do this is to use the program
"degrader", though in this case you aren't going to actually degrade
anything. With degrader select "50 Hz", "50 Hz System" and "Survive
Resets" and your Amiga will be rebooted in PAL mode and will think it
is in a European country operating in PAL mode.

   Normally a North American Amiga operates in NTSC mode 640x400
resolution.  PAL mode produces a resolution of 640x512.

   Chaos makes use of the @{b}narrator.device@{ub} and @{b}req.library@{ub}. As of
version 2.2 Chaos no longer makes any use of @{b}ReqTools.library@{ub}.

   If the @{b}-t@{ub} option is used the @{b}translator.library@{ub} is also used.  Other
required files are the executable @{b}chaos@{ub} and the data files @{b}pool.ssc@{ub} and
@{b}chaos.prb@{ub} all of which must reside in the current directory when Chaos
is started. There are various other fonts, music and Sounds files which
reside in the directories of the same name within the current directory.

   The @{b}-t@{ub} option forces translation of player names for the speech and
requires the @{b}translator.library@{ub}. A few other options are supported, to
find out about these use @{b}chaos -h@{ub} and then press @{b}left Amiga-M@{ub} to return
to the CLI screen.

Installation
============

   Just toss it on your hard drive somewhere.

   You do not need to copy any files to LIBS: or FONTS: or anywhere
else.

   You do not need to edit your startup-sequence.

   You do not need to make any ASSIGNs.

   There are no other files that you have to mess with.

   You do not need to run any install scripts or answer any complicated
questions.

   All Amiga software should be this easy to install, don't you agree?

The game
********

   It should be unnecessary to read all the instructions to play the
game. For those who are itching to start skip to the Game Startup
section(see @{"GameStartup" Link "GameStartup"}.) to see how to load the game and then just
follow your nose. For the rest of you, the following describes how the
game is played.

   Each player (human or computer controlled) starts the game with a
wizard and a randomly generated repertoire of spells. The idea is to be
the last wizard alive and to amass the greatest score. Once your wizard
is killed you are out of the game, so protecting your wizard is vital
to your survival. The options available at the start of the game allow
for a wide range of scenarios.

   A game is organized as a series of rounds. Each round consists of
several stages, and each living wizard may partake in each stage of
each round. The major stages are: spell selection, spell casting, and
movement. Each stage is described in detail below. As well as these
main stages there are also a number of auxiliary stages performed
solely by the computer.

   The game can be played almost entirely with the mouse and is icon
driven.  All the entities in the game have animated graphical
representations. A text region at the bottom of the screen is used to
display other information. Initially, you may be perplexed by the wide
range of spells available but after a few games you should become
comfortable.

   The world once was comprised of a 7000 mile diameter sphere covered
with beautiful vegetation, crystal clear water and wonderful wildlife.
But that was before the 1000 year wizard war of Irvine vs. Conwell; the
culmination of which resulted in the destruction of most of the prime
material plane of existence.(1) All that is left is a flat rectangular
board of square cells, measuring 17 across by 14 down.

   The game is played on this rectangular board of square cells. You
move your pieces around the board using the mouse. The cost of a move
depends on the distance between the initial cell and the final cell. It
costs more to move diagonally than it does to go vertically or
horizontally.

   It is important to understand there is a distinction between the
gaming environment supplied by the computer and the computer controlled
entities.  When a computer player moves it does not get access to any
information that you cannot get. In fact, the computer bases it moves
on less information than a human player.

How to win
==========

   You have to:

   @{b}*@{ub} Kill all enemy wizards,

   @{b}*@{ub} kill or block all enemy generators,

   @{b}*@{ub} kill all enemy creatures that are still roaming around.

   A generator needs an empty space on which to generate creatures
onto. So if you can block all the spaces surrounding a generator, then
it cannot generate anything.

Game startup
============

   The game can be started from the Workbench or from the command line.
Some of the options can only be controlled from the command line. The
usual way of starting from the command line is to enter the command
@{b}chaos -t@{ub} when in the directory containing the chaos files. There is an
icon for starting from the Workbench. Installation is discussed in
Section Installation (see @{"Installation" Link "Installation"}). You should ensure Chaos has a
stack of at least 50000 bytes. From the command line this can be done
by typing @{b}stack 50000@{ub} before starting chaos. Those who have received
Chaos on a self-booting disk need not worry about this matter.

   These instructions are accurate for 3.3 of the game.  However, Chaos
is a rapidly evolving program and new features are continually being
added and some instructions may become obsolete or inaccurate in the
future. Only registered users are guaranteed of being informed about
new releases.

   After passing the introductory screens you will arrive at the first
setup screen. This screen allows you to select which wizards will be
playing, whether or not they will be computer controlled, the teams,
and their names. By default it starts with two human controlled wizards
on different teams. The @{b}T@{ub} column is used for team selection. The icons
appearing in this column represent a team. By clicking on them they
move on to the next team in the sequence. If two wizards are showing
the same icon this means they will start on the same team. There also
exist spells which can alter the teams during the course of a game.

   Once you are satisfied with the setup click on @{b}Start@{ub} which will take
you to the second initialization screen. On this screen you can select
the number of generators (default 4, maximum 99), number of spells
(default 20, maximum 99), and level of computer wizards (maximum 9).

   The wizard level influences only the allocation of spells to computer
players and does not influence the way the computer moves or casts
spells.  Any wizard can improve their level rating by casting Level
spells during the game. Doing so increases the chances of getting
useful, rare and powerful bonus spells.

   You should decide how many turns the game should last for. The
default action is forever which means the game continues until all
human players have been killed or one human player remains and all
computer players are dead. Alternatively, any number up to 999 can be
specified. The number of turns remaining is displayed at the top right
of the screen as a series of tally marks. If these are shown in yellow
then you are into the last few turns.

   You can also turn @{b}Texas Trash'em@{ub} on or off. Texas Trash'em allows
you to optionally trash (discard) one of your spells in addition to
casting a spell each turn. This allows you to discard spells you don't
like or don't want. In version 1.8 and below, computer players do not
discard spells. In version 1.9 and up you MUST discard a spell each
turn but casting a spell is optional (unless there are 5 spells or less
left in your spell list in which case you don't have to discard if you
don't want to.)

   By default the game will operate in @{b}Classic@{ub} mode. In this mode only
a limited number of spells are available. This mode is particularly
suited to neophytes. If you switch off this mode then the full
repertoire of spells is made available.

   You may also select the number of artifacts that will be randomly
placed on the board. Allowable settings are 0 to 99.

   Artifacts are like a regular creature object except it belongs to
@{b}NOBODY@{ub} until someone moves adjacent to it.

   An Artifact's owner is determined at the beginning of each movement
phase.  It is determined according to who has the most creatures
adjacent to it. In the event that 2 or more players have an equal
number of creatures adjacent to it then it remains @{b}NOBODY@{ub}'s.

   Inanimate objects and other artifacts do @{i}NOT@{ui} assist in controlling
artifacts.

   Currently there are only 4 artifacts:

   @{b}*@{ub} Bolter Wall Artifacts

   @{b}*@{ub} Dalek Artifacts

   @{b}*@{ub} Robot Artifacts

   @{b}*@{ub} Stone Golem Artifacts

   Artifacts have 0 movement points.

   Most magic spells can be cast on Artifacts so you can heal an
Artifact or increase its capabilities, etc.

   If you play Chaos against human opponents who hide in a corner,
cowering in fear, then try playing the game with some artifacts. The
sight of a nice, big, powerful artifact just sitting there waiting for
someone to claim it can be a strong incentive for them to charge out
after it and has been known to spark intense power struggles.

   @{b}Hidden Artifacts@{ub}: If this is turned on then artifacts will be buried
underneath walls, trees, rocks and other inanimate objects. These
objects will have to be destoryed in order to take posession of the
artifact underneath.

   You can also select the number of scrolls that will appear on the
board.  Allowable settings are 0 to 99. A scroll is a spell lying on
the board which is free for the taking. Isn't that cool? Scrolls are
magically inscribed on extremely delicate, dry, brittle, paper. They
are therefore excessively fragile and even the tiniest amount of damage
will destroy them. The scroll rules should be set to one of the
following:

  1. Scrolls can be picked up by anybody.

  2. Scrolls can be picked up by wizards only.

  3. Scrolls can be picked up by anybody except flying creatures.

   Inanimate objects can never pick up scrolls.

   There are normally only 3 ways to affect scrolls:

   @{b}*@{ub} By entering a cell that contains a scroll and surviving there
     until the end of the complete round. The complete round means
     until everyone has finished their turn for this round, including
     all wizards and independents. If you survive in a cell containing
     a scroll until the end of the round then the scroll is magically
     added to your commanding Wizard's spell list.

   @{b}*@{ub} Destroy them by shooting them.

   @{b}*@{ub} Destroy them by Burying them with the Bury spell.

   @{i}Caution:@{ui} shooting the scrolls of Undead Elementals may produce
Ungood side effects. }8>

   If you play Chaos against human players who just sit in a corner and
avoid conflicts with each other then try playing the game with some
scrolls laying around. This can draw them out of their corner and start
up some fierce battles!

   @{b}Scroll Delay@{ub}: Allowable settings are 0 to 6.  This controls how many
consecutive turns you must control the cell before you are awarded the
scroll. 0 means you will acquire it at the end of @{i}this@{ui} round. 1 means
you will acquire it at the end of the @{i}next@{ui} round and so forth.

   If at the end of a round, you no longer control the cell then you
must start over again so if @{b}Scroll Delay@{ub} is 6 and you lose control of
the cell after only 5 turns then you must regain control for 6
consecutive turns to obtain the scroll.

   You are permitted to move creatures into and out of the cell
containing the scroll without any penalty so long as you control the
cell with a scroll-capable creature at the end of the round.

   @{b}Hidden Scrolls@{ub}: If this is turned on then scrolls will be buried
underneath walls, trees, rocks and other inanimate objects. These
objects will have to be destoryed in order to take posession of the
scroll underneath.

   @{b}Agent Casting@{ub}: An Agent is something which is capable of casting its
own magic spells on its own accord.  Some examples of agents are the
Agathion, Azer, Cat Lord, Chronomancer, Dao, Fake Wizard, Faun,
Inanimatologist, Inanimage, Jann, Marid, Mullac de Irvine and
Necromancer.  When agent casting is turned on, these creatures will be
able to cast their spells.  When agent casting is turned off, these
creatures will never cast any spells.

   Turning this option on makes the game wildly unpredictable.

   @{b}Impurities@{ub} If impurities are turned on then
   @{b}*@{ub} Sometimes creatures will randomly change their allegiance.

   @{b}*@{ub} Sometimes things will randomly disappear into another dimension.
     (They will randomly reappear later.)

   @{b}*@{ub} With every attack made there is approximately 1 chance in 400 that
     the attacker will really kick some ass!  In such a circumstance
     the attacker will whack his opponent with an incredibly amazing 50
     points of damage!  Furthermore, the awesomeness of this attack
     cannot be mitigated by a cloak!  The attacker goes around the
     cloak, hits the most vulnerable part of his enemy and sadisticly
     inflicts massive damage!

   @{b}Exploration Mode@{ub}: When exploration mode is on you cannot see cells
which you have not explored. Once you have explored a cell it stays
permanently explored, there is no need to maintain line-of-sight to the
cell. This makes the gameplay nice and simple, the way I like it.

   Most creatures simply explore the cell they are in and all adjacent
cells.

   Some creatures, like Eagles explore further and can see behind walls
due to flying high in the air.

   Other creatures, like snakes, can "feel" the movements of other
creatures at far distances, thus allowing them to map cells which are
hidden behind walls that cannot be seen by normal creatures.

   Certain other creatures can hear or smell other creatures at a
greater distance than they can see.

   This adds the "Explore-the-Map" play mechanic to the game. You can't
see any cells until you have sent a unit to map them. Once mapped the
cell remains visible forever even if you have no nearby units or no
line-of-sight.

   You can also see the cells that your allies can see. But if they
stop being your ally then you can no longer see those cells.

   You'll need to explore the level and map it out.

   Having @{b}Exploration Mode@{ub} turned ON makes the game MUCH harder since
you have no idea what direction you should be going in the early stages
of the game. Nor do you have any idea what direction you will be
attacked from at first.

   @{b}Ruthlessness Mode@{ub}: This option causes the computer players to become
ruthless in their combat tactics.  They won't cheat, but they will
fight in a more intelligent manner.

   When Ruthlessness mode is activated computer players will:
   @{b}*@{ub} Cast pits, magic glass, walls, rocks and miner willy more
     intelligently and aggressively.

   @{b}*@{ub} If they are an arborist they will cast shadow wood and dark wood
     trees in a more aggressive and intelligent manner.

   @{b}*@{ub} Whenever a creature is engaged it will always attack the strongest
     creature that it can acutally kill.  If it cannot make a kill then
     it will attack whichever enemy it feels is the most dangerous.

   @{b}*@{ub} A shooting creature will always attempt to shoot the strongest
     creature that it can actually kill.  If it cannot make a kill then
     it will shoot whatever enemy it feels is the most dangerous.  They
     never try to shoot a wizard who is invulnerable or has a reflector.

   @{b}*@{ub} A nonengaged ground creature will always check first if there is a
     path to any enemy wizard that it can kill.  If it cannot kill any
     enemy wizard then it will check if there is a path to any
     favorite-food creature that it can kill.  If it cannot kill its
     favorite food then it will check if there is a path to any
     bonus-spell creature that it can kill.  If it can find a path to
     one of those things then it will charge after it and kill it!

   @{b}Dungeon Wars Mode@{ub}: This option will cause the game to randomly
generate a dungeon for you to fight in.

   @{b}Blood@{ub}: This option will activate damagable creature gfx.  Damaged
creatures will lose limbs and bleed in accordance with the severity of
their wounds.  The Blood option also has the effect of enabling
creature powerup gfx so that creatures who are hit by a fly spell
actually sprout wings.  However all these graphical effects ONLY happen
to creatures who have had their gfx designed for this.  As of April 24,
2001 only the Lion and Leopard have been designed in this way.  Feel
free to examine these creatures and then make the blood and powerup fx
gfx for any other creatures of your choosing.

   When you have made any desired changes, click on @{b}Start@{ub} to begin the
game.

Spell selection
===============

   For each human wizard in turn, the right of the screen is filled
with the currently available spells for that wizard. Information can be
obtained about the spells by reading about the spells in this manual or
by selecting the @{b}?@{ub} gadget and then clicking on the spell you wish to
know about.  Or simply by pointing the mouse at the spell in question
and then pressing the @{b}q@{ub} or @{b}?@{ub} key on the keyboard.

   A wizard can decide not to choose a spell by clicking the return
gadget, whence control will pass to the next wizard.

   Assuming you wish to pick a spell, simply click on the desired spell.
During the casting stage you will attempt to use your selected spell.
Care should be taken in spell selection. Consider such things as the
range of the spell, the situation of the wizard, your position on the
board, and whether line of sight is required for the spell. Just press
@{b}c@{ub} (for Casting possibilities) while the mouse is over a spell and
all the possible places that you could cast that spell will be
highlighted on the board.

   Once selected, a spell must be attempted. If the spell is aborted,
it will still be considered used and will not appear on your spell list
in the next round.

   If @{b}Texas Trash'em@{ub} was selected then you will also be required to
select a spell to be discarded (unless you have less than six spells
remaining). Such a selection must be made even if you choose not to
select a spell for casting.

   During spell casting, each player who selected a spell during the
spell selection stage will in turn get a chance to actuate the spell.
Computer controlled wizards will attempt to cast a spell at their
position in the sequence. In addition, each generator on the screen
might produce a creature. Certain other creatures also occasionally
cast spells.

   For each player in turn the spell selected is shown on the bottom
line of the screen, together with the number of attempts and the range
for the spell. For example,

     Gray Elf x1  Range=2

   means 1 Gray Elf is being cast, and the elf can be cast either
immediately adjacent to the wizard or one cell removed from the wizard
(just press @{b}c@{ub} to see all possible legal cells). A range of zero means
the spell can be cast simply by pressing the left mouse button and
there is no need to select a cell. Such spells are often special powers
for the wizard. The computer automatically applies the spell to the
correct wizard or creature.  Certain spells have a range of 15, these
spells can be cast on any appropriate cell on the screen and do not
require line of sight.

   Most spells have a fixed range, measured in a straight line from the
casting wizard. For instance, nearly all creatures have a range of one
and so can only be cast immediately adjacent to the wizard. All these
spells require line of sight. The line of sight is measured from the
centre of the wizard's cell to the centre of the destination cell. You
can see over blank space, dead creatures, pits, pools, and fires.
Sometimes line of sight can be obtained by waiting until an appropriate
time in the animation sequence.(1) By pressing @{b}c@{ub} you can ask the
computer to show you all legal target cells.

   Spells can be aborted by pressing the right mouse button. Aborted
spells still get used up, so try to avoid having to abort spells. If
you find yourself aborting spells often, you are probably not choosing
spells appropriate to your situation.

   Most spells can be cast only on certain types of cell (the program
will notify you of any errors you make in selecting the cell). If you
make an error you are free to choose a new cell. For instance,
creatures can be cast on empty cells or cells containing dead
creatures, but cannot be cast on other creatures or inanimate objects.

   After each wizard has cast, the generators may produce creatures on
any cell adjacent to the generator which is empty, or contains a dead
creature.  Adjacent cells occupied by creatures or inanimate objects
will never be generated upon.

Board update
============

   The board update is handled entirely by the computer. The update
carries out activities which are not directly under any player's
control. During the update any or all of the following things might
happen:

   @{b}*@{ub} The growths (earthquakes, fire, flood, fungi, orange jelly, gooey
     blob, and green ooze) are permitted to grow. Each cell containing
     a growth may or may not grow. If a cell is going to grow it will
     do so in only one direction in any particular turn. The direction
     of growth is chosen at random.  Earthquakes cannot "grow"
     diagonally. Some of the growths grow faster than others, orange
     jelly is particularly voracious while floods tend to be sluggish.
     If a cell doesn't grow it might dissipate instead. You may have
     some of your creatures buried, killed, or revealed in this growth
     process.  Should your wizard be buried or killed you are
     considered dead and your game ends (an exception occurs in the
     case of a wizard having previously cast Lich Lord).

     Any creature which is covered by a growth will have its life set
     to one half of its normal maximum upon being uncovered. If the
     growth is killed somehow, such as you shooting it with a bow, then
     all the other stats are left untouched.  But if the growth has
     died of natural causes then @{i}all@{ui} the creature's stats will be set
     to their normal intial values, though life will still be cut in
     half. These effects can be exploited by clever players.

     Neither case applies to dead bodies, scrolls or artifact
     creatures. Thus you cannot morph an artifact creature into a non
     artifact creature by letting it get covered up with a growth.

   @{b}*@{ub} Any tempests on the board may move. A creature in the path of the
     tempest will be thrown to a new random location. On very rare
     occasions a creature will be killed as a result of the throw.

   @{b}*@{ub} Any vortices may move. A creature in its path will disappear into
     the future.

   @{b}*@{ub} Ropers get tired of constantly sitting in the same place.
     Sometimes they decide to teleport to a new location.

   @{b}*@{ub} There is a chance that each magic castle, dark citadel or dark
     city on the board might collapse. If a wizard is inside the castle
     or citadel when the collapse occurs the wizard will be granted a
     bonus spell.

   @{b}*@{ub} Any magic wood occupied by a wizard might collapse, resulting in a
     new spell for the wizard.

   @{b}*@{ub} Each sleeping entity is examined and has a chance of dying or
     collapsing.  The weaker things are the more likely they are to be
     destroyed than the stronger things. The destruction will be
     complete and no trace of the entity will remain.

   @{b}*@{ub} Each Haunt has a small chance of changing sides.

   @{b}*@{ub} Each Spriggan has a small chance of falling asleep.

   @{b}*@{ub} (When impurities are turned on) With a small probability an object
     might decide to change sides. This may work to your advantage or
     disadvantage. It is even possible that a generator will become
     your friend and decide to emit creatures for you.

Movement
========

   The movement stage is the most complex stage, since normally there
are a large number of creatures to be moved and each creature has a
number of possible moves. Each player is given a chance to move in turn
(unless he is the victim of a Freeze spell). The strategies employed
during the movement stage will have the greatest effect on your
survival in the game. Movement involves not only the shifting of
creature positions but also combat.

   Dead creatures, sleeping creatures, and growths cannot be moved. No
inanimates can be moved, although shadow wood trees and bolters may be
used to attack enemy creatures(1) in adjacent cells. Special objects
like ropers, wasp nests or solars are controlled by the computer.

   A player is able to move each creation once in each turn. To end
your turn click on the return gadget and control will pass to the next
player.  Players having cast the Move It spell in the current round
will get a second chance to move after all other players have moved,
but before the independents move.

   A creature is said to be @{i}engaged@{ui} if it is adjacent to an enemy
creature and is unable to retreat. Engaged creatures cannot be moved but
may still be able to fight. How likely a creature is to be engaged is
dependent on its manoeuvrability and the number of adjacent hostile
creatures.

   To move a creature simply click on the creature using the left mouse
button. Normally, the distance the creature may be moved will be
displayed in the text bar. Depending on the creature, it will be flying
movement or walking movement. There is a special cursor when flying
movement is active.  To see all legal moves press the @{b}m@{ub} key.

Flying movement
---------------

   For flying creatures you can pick any cell within the given range
except cells occupied by your team's creations. If the cell is empty or
contains a dead creature then the creature will move to the selected
cell, otherwise an aerial attack will be made on the selected cell.

   The Fly spell is able to provide any creature with wings, however its
movement points won't be altered. The Wizard wings spell gives the
wizard the ability to fly in the range of an eagle.

   Flying movement can be temporarily impossible in the world if the
gravity sphere has been cast, or permanently for a creature if it is
the victim of a singular or dual earthbind spell.

Aerial attacks
--------------

   An aerial attack results when a flying creature is moved onto a cell
occupied by an opponent. The flier will attack the current occupant. If
unsuccessful the attacker will remain at its current location. If
successful the current occupant will die and the flying creature will be
moved into the cell.

Walking movement
----------------

   A ground based creature can only move one cell at a time and you
must show the computer exactly how to move multiple cells by clicking
in each cell in turn. Many walking creatures can only move one cell
anyway. For those which can move more than one cell you should select a
sequence of adjacent cells -- you can abort the move at any time by
pressing the right mouse button.  During the course of a move a
creature may become engaged in which case it will move no further.

Combat
------

   Engaged creatures can take part in combat. You cannot attack your
team's creatures (but see @{"RangedCombat" Link "RangedCombat"}), unless the creature currently
moving has a negative combat ability, meaning the attack will actually
heal.  Living creatures cannot (normally) attack undead creatures,
otherwise anything goes. Once engaged, an attack is induced by clicking
on the cell containing the creature you wish to attack. If successful,
the defendant will be killed and the attacker will move onto the
corpse. For a successful kill of a strong opponent you may be awarded a
bonus spell.

   It is possible to attack inanimate objects and growths, although you
cannot get engaged to them. Be wary of killing growths with buried
creatures beneath, as the buried creature will be revealed and will
probably be quite hungry.

Ranged combat
-------------

   Some creatures such as elves, dragons, and wizards carrying bows,
have additional attacks. Such an attack is indicated by the @{i}sights
pointer@{ui}. Line of sight is required for most of these weapons. It is
possible to shoot your own creations or creations of your team members,
so choose your targets carefully. Occasionally it might be desirable to
kill one your own creatures due to insanity or disease (especially if
you are playing for points).

   Creatures which posess the @{i}archery@{ui} skill (such as the Wood Elf and
Gray Elf) do not need line of sight to shoot a target. Their shots
simply arch over any intervening obstacles. The Archery spell can give
the archery skill to creatures with some ranged combat ability, while
the Archerotomy will remove this skill.

Wizard movement
---------------

   Under normal circumstances the wizard can be moved like any other
creature.  However, wizards are capable of special movements. Wizards
can climb magic trees, enter castles, and ride certain creatures. For
convenience these activities are collectively called @{i}mounting@{ui}. You
cannot mount if you are engaged, otherwise mounting is effected by
simply moving the wizard onto the cell occupied by the entity you wish
to mount.

   Dismounting is somewhat more complicated as the computer needs to
distinguish which of the two entities is to be moved. For trees and
castles the computer will assume the wizard. For ridden creatures the
default is the creature. To dismount from a creature the following
sequence should occur:

   @{b}*@{ub} Select the creature the wizard is riding.

   @{b}*@{ub} Click on the `D' gadget at the top right of the screen (which will
     now be unghosted).

   @{b}*@{ub} Move the wizard to a cell adjacent to the creature (wizards with
     high movement allowance or wings still only move one cell when
     dismounting).

   Mounting is generally a good idea, as it hides the wizard from view
and gives the wizard additional protection.

Ending your turn
----------------

   Once you have moved all creatures that you wish to, select the end
of turn gadget. Computer controlled wizards will move their creations
at the appropriate point in the sequence. After all wizards have moved
the independent creatures will be moved by the computer according to
the same rules.

   Finally, any wasp nests, ropers, fungi and anything else that has the
Special Combat Attribute will attack adjacent opponents.

   Note that some objects such as Pools, Apple Wood Trees, Hippocrates
and others have @{i}negative@{ui} special combat. This means their Special Combat
actually heals those that it attacks.

   The round is now effectively over and the game returns to the spell
selection stage for the next round.

Scoring
=======

   The computer keeps track of a score for each player and this is
indicated by the computer displaying a ranking of all wizards and the
independents at the end of the game. There is a score and a life
column. The life column is the sum of the life force of a wizard's
creations excepting walls, castles, and certain other inanimate
objects. The current scores can be examined during the spell selection
stage using the menus.

   Points are awarded for killing enemy creatures and wizards. The
stronger the creatures you kill the more points you get. Bonus spells
are awarded for killing particularly strong creatures. Points are also
awarded for successfully casting some difficult or unusual spells.
Points are even awarded for destroying or burying corpses.

===========

   The @{b}?@{ub} gadget can be used to get information about objects on the
board (at any time) and about spells (during spell selection). For an
object on the screen, a window is displayed showing various
characteristics of the chosen object. The @{b}?@{ub} gadget will not reveal any
useful information when applied to a cloaked creature, unless you own
it.

   The information screen for a wizard or a cell containing a mounted
wizard will also display the various power-ups held by the wizard as
icons.

   Most creature's Combat stats affect their opponent's Life stat but
Some creatures, like the Mind Flayer, attack Intelligence or some other
stat.  Sometimes a creature's Combat or Ranged Combat or Special Combat
will affect more than one of your Enemy's stats at a time.

   Just press the Left Mouse button on either Combat, Ranged Combat or

(like a bipedal generator). This also determines the @{i}initial@{ui} value of

creatures cannot attack the undead, though there are numerous
exceptions such as the Imp, The Exorcist or any Wizard with a magic

   In the game creatures can move by flying or staying on the ground.
This statistic, which only makes sense for creatures, detemines the

flying creatures, the ability to see and map the world without need for

   This particular statistic indicates whether the wizard is able to

are mountable set 1 can be directly ridden by the wizard.  They range
from the Horse and Pegasus to the Magic Wood and the Shadow City.
Objects which are mountable set 2 can only be ridden by the wizard
after he has cast the Ride spell, as mounting them requires more
training.  They include all dragons, the hardy Elephant, the swift Bird

Life force
..........

   Life Force is also known as "hit points".  This very important
characteristic determines the resistance of the object to physical
damage by combat, ranged combat, special combat, magic and poison.  If
the life force of an object becomes negative the object dies.  Normally
if the life force becomes 0, the object dies.  However, death by poison
requires that the life force drop to below 0 before death occurs.  The
life force of a corpse begins at 0 and is lowered when a scavenger eats
some of it.  When a corpse's life force reaches the negative of its
normal maximum, it is considered consumed and disappears from play.  A
recovery rate from -7 to 7 is available on each turn:  auto-healing
capabilities (when positive) or poison (when negative).  The Armor
spell can be used to raise the life force of a creature, and it can be
lowered by numerous other means.  Other spells or forms of combat (like
the bite of the Giant Rat) affect the recovery ability.

Magical resistance
..................

   All creatures are not equal when it comes to magic. Some are very
vulnerable to magic spells whereas others (not necessarily those which
are physically resistant) can show a very strong aptitude to resist
magical attacks. Usually a creature dies when its magical resistance,
which normally ranges from 0 to 7, becomes negative.  Certain
ultra-powerful spells such as Justice, Dark Power and Exorcism kill the
creature if they lower the magic resistance to 0.

   A recover rate from -7 to 7 is possible. The magical resistance of a
particular creature can be raised by the magic shield spell, which can
also be used to improve the recovery rate for magical resistance. The
spells which attack the magical resistance are many, and there are also
creatures which attack it like the Juju Zombie.

Manoeuvrability
...............

   Ranging from 0 to 15 with a maximum recovery of 7, this
characteristic (also called agility) determines the probability that
the creature gets engaged at the beginning of its movement phase when
an enemy is adjacent.  Creatures whose manoeuvrability is 0 are always
engaged while those whose manoeuvrability is 15 are never engaged and
can always escape a battle.  All creatures immediately become engaged
upon moving next to any enemy creature, regardless of their agility
rating.  The Command spell can be used to raise the agility of all the
creations of the casting wizard.  The Spectator, Python and a few other

   The intelligence or stupidity of a creature in Chaos is measured
from 0 (very stupid) to 15 (most intelligent), with a recovery rate
from -7 to 7.  When the intelligence of a creature becomes negative, it
dies as the synaptic damage prevents its brain from maintaining its own
vital functions.  Intelligence can be raised by the Brain Boost spell
or lowered with the Brain Drain spell, among others. This
characteristic also determines the probability of success of
Subversion-like spells on the creature.  Certain creatures, such as the
Mind Flayer, attack this statistic.

Combat
......

   One of the most important statistics, combat reflects the ability of
a particular creature to cause damage to other objects in the world.
Possible values range from -15 to 15 with a recovery rate from -7 to 7.
Each time the creature attacks another object, its combat statistic is
subtracted from the target statistics of the attacked creature.  If the
combat statistic is negative, this means that the attack will in fact
heal the targetted creature (which can be an ally or an enemy).
However, creatures with positive combat cannot attack their allies.
This prevents simple mistakes of accidentally clicking on a friendly
creature and wounding it.  A variety of characteristics can be altered
by combat.  Usually this will be the life force but, for example, the
Arctic Wolf attacks simultaneously the life force, manoeuvrability and
movement points.  The combat ability can be magically raised for
example by the Combat spell, destroyed with Demonic Touch, or the
target statistic changed by the Poison Dagger spell.

Ranged combat
.............

   Some creatures have the ability to shoot missiles, such as arrows or
fire breath (like Red Dragons). This is indicated by a positive (from 1
to 15) ranged combat ability, which will be subtracted from the target
statistics of the targetted creature. A negative ranged combat ability
means ranged healing. This statistic can be magically altered by the
Range Boost spell or the Range Drain Beam. However, there is no direct
way to produce a generic creature which has no initial ranged combat
ability with this capacity. The wizard, however, can make use of the
Magic Bow and protect himself with the Reflector spell. A recovery rate
from -7 to 7 is possible.

Special combat
..............

   This very special capability ranging from -15 to 15 is like combat
in that it attacks some characteristics of other creatures, but differs
in the way it is done. Special combat takes place after the movement
phase and possibly affects every surrounding object. It can also affect
allies as well as enemies, depending on the object possessing special
combat. Any creature can be given special combat through the Shocker
spell and there is almost no way to ever remove it. A recovery rate
ranging from -7 to 7 is possible.

Movement
........

   This statistic determines how far a creature can move during the
movement phase. This can however be limited by engagement in battles.
Any creature can be sped up with the Speed spell or slowed by the Slow
spell, among several other spells. Some creatures also attack this
rating, such as the Basilisk. Unfortunately there is no recovery
statistic for movement.

Scavengerism
............

   This important capability of a particular creature enables it to
feed on corpses. On each turn, the creature is able to eat as many life
points from the corpse it's standing on as its scavengerism statistic
and add them to its own life force. When the life force of the corpse
reaches the negative of its initial value, the corpse is fully consumed
and disappears.  Some creatures such as the Dire Wolf, Arctic Wolf,
Vulture and Neo-Otyugh (among others) always have this statistic.
However, most creatures can only scavenge after being the recipient of
the Scavengerism spell.

negative probability can only be obtained as BONUS spells, either when

   Pressing @{b}HELP@{ub} will present you with some simple context-sensitve help
information.

   By pressing the number keys @{b}1@{ub}-@{b}9@{ub} the creations of the corresponding
player can be highlighted. Key @{b}9@{ub} highlights the independent creatures.
Creatures who have not moved are highlighted in a cycling color.
Creatures who have moved are highlighted in red. Allies are highlighted
in blue.

   Pressing @{b}q@{ub} for @{i}Query@{ui} is another way to bring up the information
screen for a creature. Once brought up you can press @{b}q@{ub} again to quit
the info screen or press any other key to continue on to the 2nd info
screen.

   Pressing @{b}c@{ub} for @{i}Cast@{ui} during the spellcasting phase will show all the
legal targets for the spell about to be cast. It takes into account all
the rules for spell casting such as range, line-of-sight, wizard
powerups and the exact type of thing in the target cell (growth,
creature, inanimate, etc.)

   Pressing @{b}m@{ub} for @{i}Move@{ui} shows all the legal moves that the currently
highlighted creature can make or if no creature is currently
highlighted then it shows the legal moves for the creature under the
mouse pointer. "Moving" includes "attacking" so often the cells of enemy
creatures will be highlighted (because it is legal for you to attempt to
move there) even though you perhaps don't have a snowball's chance in
hell of really killing the creature (e.g. orc vs. stone giant).

   Pressing @{b}r@{ub} for @{i}Range@{ui} shows all the cells that are within range of
the currently highlighted creature's ranged weapon or if no creature is
currently highlighted then it shows all cells that are in range of the
creature under the mouse pointer. @{i}Please note@{ui}: this shows all the cells
that are within range not all the cells that you can actually hit.
Many times the cells shown will be unshootable due to intervening
objects blocking line-of-sight or the fact that undeads cannot be shot
by living creatures.

   Pressing @{b}s@{ub} for @{i}Shoot@{ui} shows all the cells that can actually be shot
by the currently highlighted creature's ranged weapon or if no creature
is currently highlihgted then it shows all the cells that can actually
be shot by the creature under the mouse pointer. @{i}Please note@{ui}: this
takes into account line-of-sight and living/undead restrictions.

   Pressing @{b}l@{ub} for Line-of-Sight shows all the cells that can be seen by
the currently highlighted creature or if no creature is highlighted
then it shows all the cells that can be seen by the the cell under the
mouse pointer. This is particularly useful when you are thinking of
casting a spell that requires line-of-sight and you want to see if your
wizard can actually see the intended target. It is also good for
checking out where enemy wizards can/cannot see to so you can hide your
creatures behind walls and things to protect them from subversion,
betrayal, abduction, sleep, braindrain etc.

   Pressing @{b}f@{ub} for Feel shows all the squares that can be felt by the
currently highlighted creature or if no creature is highlighted then it
shows all the squares that can be felt by the creature under the mouse
pointer.

   Pressing @{b}h@{ub} for Hear shows all the squares that can be heard by the
currently highlighted creature or if no creature is highlighted then it
shows all the squares that can be heard by the creature under the mouse
pointer.

   Pressing @{b}o@{ub} for Olfactory (smell) shows all the squares that can be
smelled by the currently highlighted creature or if no creature is
highlighted then it shows all the squares that can be smelled by the
creature under the mouse pointer.

   Pressing SHIFT in combination with @{b}m@{ub}, @{b}r@{ub}, @{b}s@{ub}, @{b}f@{ub}, @{b}h@{ub}, @{b}o@{ub} or @{b}l@{ub} will @{i}always@{ui}

Graphics
--------

   As of 3.0 a new graphics system that uses standard iff pictures to
describe how monsters and magic spells and all other objects in the
game look has been introduced.

   Each object in the game has its own 320x256 64 color EHB mode iff
file.

   The name of the file is, and must be, the @{i}exact@{ui} name of the object in
English. The spaces must be there so don't try to rename them. All the
files are already included with the proper name in @{b}gfx/Spells/@{ub} so you
don't need to worry about this.

   All you have to do is edit any of the files you want and they will
automagically get included into the game. Unless for some reason the
clock in your Amiga is broken. In which case you may have to type in
the shell: @{b}delete gfx/dat/#?@{ub}

   That will delete the graphics index files and force the game to
rebuild them from scratch. It takes a full minute to rebuild all the
tiles from scratch because it must open and close 350 files + read in
350 files + decompress 350 files + cut and paste 731 tiles, check for
blank frames, etc. These numbers are only accurate as of July 25th,
2000. The numbers will be much larger in the future.

   If you change any graphic file then the next time you start the
game, it will notice that you have changed something and will rebuild
the tile indexes. This will take a full minute or more.

   Selecting @{b}New Game@{ub} from the menu is currently not sufficient to
reload the tiles. You must completely quit the game (exit to DOS or
WorkBench).  Then reload the game and all will be well. 8)

   The old 3 frame animation limitation has been @{i}ERADICATED@{ui}. You may
now draw or render as many frames as you like.

   The old 32-color limitation has been @{i}ERADICATED@{ui}. I couldn't think of
any conceivable reason why any strategy game should be limited to 32
colors.  All Amigas support 64 colors or more so we are going to use
them.

Ye Olde Rules for GrafixMages
-----------------------------

  0. The first 31 pixels at the top of the screen are ignored.

  1. All Living Creatures @{i}MUST@{ui} have a dead image! (Even if you just cut
     & paste in an image of a dead orc.) The leftmost tile is reserved
     for the dead image and only the dead image.

  2. All Inanimate Objects and Growths and Undeads must @{i}NOT@{ui} have a dead
     image. Its dead image space should be blank.

  3. You may have as many frames of animation as you like. Ping-Pong and
     continuous looping playback are both currently supported.

  4. In order to specify that you want your animation played in looping
     mode you must change the purple line at line 32 to be color #1.
     This tells the game to play this animation in a continuous loop.

  5. The animation frames are terminated by the first completely blank
     frame.

  6. The image must use the supplied palette. If you rearrange the
     palette for artistic reasons then you @{i}MUST@{ui} rearrange it back to
     its original state before saving the file. Failure to do this will
     result in wrong-looking graphics.

  7. If you want to leave extra grafix on the screen that you are
     working on then that's ok. They will be ignored. Only the tiles up
     to the first blank tile are processed by the game. Any extra gfx
     at the bottom of the screen are ignored.

Adding your own sound effects
-----------------------------

   Beginning with Chaos v2.81 it is very easy to add your own sound
effects into the game.

   Once you have a sound effect that you want in the game you must save
it as a @{b}.8svx@{ub} sound file.

   In the @{b}Chaos@{ub} game directory there is a @{b}Sounds/@{ub} directory. In that
dir are 3 other directories @{b}Combat/@{ub} @{b}Death/@{ub} and @{b}Kill/@{ub}.

   The @{b}Combat/@{ub} directory contains the sounds that play when a creature
attacks another in hand-to-hand combat.

   The @{b}Death/@{ub} directory contains the sounds that play when a creature
dies.

   The @{b}Kill/@{ub} directory contains the sounds that play when a creature
kills something.

   So let's say you have a really great sound that the Mind Flayer
should make when it attacks someone. Just put the sound effect into the
@{b}Combat/@{ub} directory under the name of @{b}Mind Flayer@{ub}. The filename of the
sound effect must @{i}EXACTLY@{ui} match the name of the creature in the game!
You @{i}MUST@{ui} use correct spacing and uppercase/lowercase letters.

   If you add new sounds in the middle of a game then you must quit the
game completely (exit back to workbench). Then restart the game and the
sounds will then be activated.

   If you have a sound that you would like to play when a Mind Flayer
dies then just put it in the @{b}Death/@{ub} directory with the name @{b}Mind Flayer@{ub}.

   If you have a sound that you would like to play whenever a Mind
Flayer kills something then put it in the @{b}Kill/@{ub} directory with the name
@{b}Mind Flayer@{ub}.

   Using this system you can implement special sounds for any and all
of the monsters in Chaos.

   MCP has such a hack.  It should be turned off when playing Chaos.

Improvements from 3.1 to 3.3
----------------------------

  1. Implemented Towers. The mystical powers of the Magic Tower allow
     it to absorb the essence of any creature who enters it. The Tower
     starts out very short but as it becomes more powerful it grows in
     size. Any creature entering a tower adds all of its primary
     statistcs to the statistics of the Tower. Once a creature enters a
     tower it can never leave because its essence becomes one with the
     tower in a permanent and unbreakable bond.  Wizards cannot enter
     towers.

  2. STUPID: Computer wizards sometimes cast Cartagraphy, Telescope,
     Seismology and Alternography when the game is not even in
     exploration mode!  NOW FIXED.

  3. SAI: I had a quick game of Chaos last night. The only stupid thing
     I noticed was when my own Mullac de Irvine decided to cast an
     earthquake right next to my wizard. Naturally, I gave the Mullac a
     war[n/m]ing blast from my dragon and he didn't do it again. JC:
     Hehehe. Ok I have now adjusted the AI so that computer-controlled
     spellcasters will not cast Earthquakes adjacent to friendly
     wizards. Unless the friendly wizard has an Earthquake shield, then
     they might cast it there anyway. NOW FIXED.

  4. DITTO for Floods and Fires.

  5. Included Robin's new Power Wall description into the game.

  6. Activated the Chaos website and uploaded all the files.  It works
     ok but all the fonts seem too small.

  7. BUG: An allied computer wizard might still cast Earthquake
     adjacent to one of his allied wizards if he is meditating in an
     enemy meditation.  The trouble is that SameTeam() gets confused
     when Wizards are inside of enemy objects.  NOW FIXED.

  8. ADDED: Special Combat now plays the creature's special attack
     sound from Sounds/Combat/ just like regular combat does.  This was
     needed for Wasp Nest and Grim Reaper.

  9. NEW CREATURE: Grim Reaper.  Stats, animation, sound and description
     designed by Robin!  I put this one in first since he did the whole
     package himself which freed my mind to concentrate on coding.  I
     tested the new creature and he seems to work ok.  He's very tricky
     to use, especially in Dungeon Wars mode.

 10. Added sound effects for Wasp Nest and Grim Reaper to the
     Sounds/Combat/ dir.

 11. BUG: There was no WaitJCsound() in the CellEffectList() routine so
     the long sound effects of 1 special combat thing could overlap
     into the special combat of another thing.  NOW FIXED.

 12. 2 new wizard names: When you start the game there are now 2 new
     possibilities for the random wizard names: Robin Hood in honor of
     Robin Schmidt. King Artur in honor of Artur Chlebek.

 13. Updated contacts.html some more.

 14. 3 NEW SPELLS: Ditzy Blonde, Winged Elf Boots and Anger.

 15. 2 NEW SPELLS: Worm and Blood Worm.

 16. Included Xav's damagable Weak Wall, Strong Wall and Standard Wall.
     I implemented the proramming for them and then played a test game.
     WORKS GREAT!

 17. Included Xav's damagable Rock.  I smoothed many (all?) of the Rock
     pieces.

 18. EDITED: The Amphisbaena to have the word balloon over his head.

 19. I DREW: 8 additional damaged variations of Power Wall Center,
     Power Wall Vertical and Power Wall Horizontal.

 20. INCLUDED: The new damaged Power Wall variations into the game.

 21. BUG: Destroy Wall and Animate spells totally do not work with the
     new multi-damageable variations of walls system.  NOW FIXED.

 22. Artur _finally_ sent in a 50% translation of the game. (He
     promised it would be done by Jan 2nd, 2001)

 23. Spent several hours compiling/testing/archiving/sending Artur his
     v3.04re version of chaos.

 24. Spent 1 hour investigating why the png gfx of the website work on
     all amiga webbrowsers and on MSIE but not on linux or netscape mac.

 25. BUG: I put chainsaw on my ghost and it didn't make the chainsaw
     noise!  (when I attacked a red dragon) Ok right now it is set so
     that if a creature already has an attack sound then it just keeps
     playing the normal attack sound when you have a chainsaw. The
     chainsaw noise is only played on creatures who have no attack
     sound. Should this be changed? I think the answer is yes. NOW
     FIXED.

 26. INCLUDED: Xav's new Free and Free All gfx into the game.

 27. RS: Raise Dead: A powerful spell, if wisely used. The comupter,
     however, does not use it wisely: I played a game with all 8
     wizards in one team, against 26 generators. there happened some
     fierce combat and then a wizard who had the Depth power-up spoke
     the Raise Dead. But he didn't raise the Blue Dragon that was lying
     in front of him, no, he raised that stupid Fire Bat in some corner
     of the board?! How does the computer choose what corpus it raises?
     JC: OK I looked into this and it seems to be completely random!  I
     never knew that!?!

 28. STUPID: Raise Dead and Resurrection are cast completely randomly
     with _no_ AI whatsoever. I have now changed this to make it use
     the general Dangerousness() algorithm. NOW FIXED.

 29. Compiled v3.04d for Aminet.

 30. PROBLEM: I will soon be entering in 24 variations of the Lion.
     But I don't want to have to waste 24 identical dead images of the
     Lion so I need to implement Groups (of IDs) into the game.  NOW
     FIXED.

 31. Creatures need a Group: tag in the spell file.  If this tag is
     missing then Group = 0.  If Group==0 then there's no group.
     Otherwise Group is the ID to get the dead body information from.
     This way I don't have to have a jillion identical dead body images
     for every creature-variation!  Group tag added. DONE.

 32. InsertCorpse() and InsertCorpseUnder() must be modified to check
     for IF (InitialData(id).Group != 0) id=InitialData(id).Group; DONE.

 33. Included FD's new SpellsToTexInfo.rexx and his new paragraph fixed
     English and Français spell descriptions A-D.

 34. I split Readme.txt into 2 seperate files: History1997-1999.txt and
     History2000.txt.  I deleted Readme.txt since it really isn't
     intended for the general public to read.  It is just the history
     of implemented changes.

 35. BLOOD: Xav says that with the new bloody versions of the creatures
     the game will become a blood bath and some people may not like
     that.  Therefore we need a Blood on/off feature.  DONE.

 36. I put the Blood option on the setupscreen, the gamesave file and
     the prefs file.  DONE.

 37. BUG: The score of the independents is NOT saved with the game!!!!
     in score.c and io.c change MAX_WIZARDS to ENTITIES While I'm at it
     I'm going to convert all existing levels to have BloodMode=ON.
     Reload and resave ALL the levels using the new routine. NOW FIXED.

 38. Included FD's new ChaosDocs.texinfo fully updated for V3.1 of
     Chaos.

 39. Included the new setup screens including the new Blood option for
     English, Français and Deutsch.

 40. Included FD's new Paragraphized English and Français spell
     descriptions A-Z.

 41. Included FD's new scripts/ dir for making documentation related
     files.

 42. Included Krzynio's Polski ChaosLite.readme and Valwit's Deutsch
     ChaosLite.readme into the aminet v3.04 version.

 43. Uploaded v3.04 to Aminet with a readme in all 5 languages.  The
     Rosetta Stone of .readmes. :)  The purpose of this version is to
     have a 100% version sitting on Aminet during the months that it
     takes me to prepare the next MEGA release of Chaos.  Archive size
     is: 5933797 bytes.

 44. 12:01 a.m. I saw the new ChaosLite.lha (v3.04) materialize onto
     Aminet.

 45. 8:00 a.m. Updated the website contacts.html and downloads.html
     from Chaos v3.0 to Chaos v3.04.

 46. Implemented the complete new Lion. 72 tiles + 1 tile for the dead
     body.

 47. PROBLEM: When playing the game in English, the translated spell
     names are not shown at the bottom of the screen. Only the TRUE
     name of the creature is shown (such as "Lion wings d1"). This
     looks tacky. This has never really been correct but it has always
     been tolerable until now because we have so many jillions of
     damaged versions of objects. Ok I just made a simple change to the
     CreatureName() function so everything that prints the name of a
     creature in the whole program should now automagically work with
     this new system. NOW FIXED.

 48. BUG: Ack! Certain names of certain spells are totally wacked out in
     Français mode! Lion, Faun, Cobra work. Passage, Invulnerability,
     Vengeance, Justice, Abduction, Raise Dead, X-Ray, Unicorn do not
     work. Ok I just spent a whole hour investigating this problem. I
     _finally_ figured out what is going on! This is all because the
     lists of spell names in SpellDescriptions/#?.txt were not rebuilt
     after I added in the new spells!  These must be rebuilt each time
     a new spell is added. I'm going to change the makefile to delete
     them all each time I do a "smake clean" (like it used to do). NOW
     FIXED.

 49. GROUPS: I went back and put all power walls into 1 big group.  I
     also put all other damagable walls and rocks into their own
     individual groups.  This fixes foreign translation problems.

 50. FD: During special combat, "independents" is still printed at the
     bottom of the screen. JC: I just tested this and it didn't say
     "independents" but it did say range = 0" at the bottom. NOW FIXED.

 51. FD: When a creature comes back from the astral plane, during the
     subsequent spell selection, the player # key shows it as unmoved.
     Just a detail. JC: I propose that _all_ creatures should be set to
     unmoved during the spell selection phase. This has been bothering
     me for a long time. I always want to check how far a certain
     creature can move during my spell selection but I never can
     because they have all been set to "already moved". NOW FIXED.

 52. FD: My wizard mounted an independent flying carpet (BTW, I was
     quite surprised to see such a "creature" to be generated), but I
     cannot move the carpet. I can't even dismount. While this is OK
     for magic wood (but what would happen if someone casts stone to
     flesh on the tree I'm meditating in?), this is quite disturbing
     for creatures. JC: What is happening now is that the game checks
     if something is a Meditation. If its a Meditation and its empty
     then anyone can enter it, even if the meditation is a creature
     that belongs to someone else. Ok I just added in the line of code
     to prevent human wizards from mounting enemy meditation creatures.
     But now I am thinking I should have just left it the way it was.
     It sounds pretty cool that you can mount an enemy magic carpet in
     an emergency. You should eventually get a bonus spell out of it.
     But if you have only 1 enemy and you are mounted on his Magic
     Carpet then you'll be invulnerable because he won't attack his own
     stuff to get at your wizard. Is this an interesting strategic
     aspect? Or a bad design flaw? Aaaaaugh! I don't know what to do!
     I'm leaving the fix in since I already put it there. So the rules
     currently are: "You cannot mount any enemy creature." "You can
     mount an enemy inanimate object if it is a meditation object and
     nobody else is already mounted there."

 53. ADDED the code to prevent computer wizards from mounting enemy
     creature meditations to many AI routines and movement routines.
     This took 1 hour.

 54. I think it would be cool to be mounted on an enemy creature. You
     never know where he'll take you! You have some control over him.
     But he has some control over you too! It could be wild! On the
     other hand it might be stupid, if you have only 1 enemy because he
     would never attempt to harm his own creature. I didn't attempt to
     put this idea into the game because: 1.  You guys don't seem to
     like it. 2. There is a good chance that it will cause some secret
     side-effect bugs that will have to be debugged and I don't feel
     like working that hard on it right now. 3. Even if no new bugs get
     created, it will still take some time to think about all the AI
     routines and movmenet routines and how to modify them to work
     correctly with the new rule. 4. It might be a totally stupid idea.

 55. INCLUDED: Xav's new Centaur, Juju Zombie, Pox and really awesome
     Pegasus gfx!

 56. IMPLEMENTED: the complete new damagable Leopard (24 IDs, 73 tiles)
     and the new damagable Elephant (24 IDs, 97 tiles).

 57. There are now 3 damagable creatures in the game: Lion, Leopard,
     Elephant.  I guess that is enough until I hear back from people if
     they like them or don't like them or whatever.

 58. ANNOYING BUG: During the movement phase when you are moving your
     creatures around; when you click on an object to attack it the
     amount of life left in the object is not updated at the bottom of
     the screen.  In order to force the screen to update you must move
     the mouse entirely off the current square and then back onto that
     square.

 59. ANNOYING BUG: When you shoot an object, the life at the bottom is
     not updated until you move the mouse completely off the square and
     back onto it.

 60. ANNOYING BUG: When you shoot an undead object and kill it so that
     the square is now completely empty, the text at the bottom of the
     screen still says the name of the object that WAS there, not what
     is _currently_ there!  You must move the mouse completely off the
     square and back onto it again to see what is really there.

 61. ANNOYING BUG: When you kill a growth and the growth dies and
     reveals a covered creature, the text at the bottom of the screen
     STILL says you are pointed at the growth!  It doesn't update to
     show what you are REALLY pointing at now.  You must move the mouse
     pointer off the current square and back onto it to get it to
     update the text.

 62. ALL ANNOYING BUGS NOW FIXED!  (I put a Clearoxoy() everywhere
     there was a RecalculateAllDamagedObjects() + I put one at the end
     of SayCreatureName())

 63. PROBLEM: The Level Editor menus are about to overflow with all
     these bajillions of damaged object variations.  I have now changed
     it so that damaged variations of objects are not shown in the
     menus, only the original primary object is shown.  NOW FIXED.

 64. ADDED: code=far to the compilation of chaos.c.  Now Chaos.o is
     182564 bytes and the game compiles and links perfectly now!

 65. I improved the gfx for Uncertainty, Inanimorphobiosis and Mass
     Petrification.

 66. I had to go back through all 72 Tower spell files and add in a line
     Group: TowerLevel5ID to each one.  This should hopefully solve all
     on-screen translation problems.

 67. BUG: Magic Carpets NEVER collapse!  I had just assumed there was
     code in BoardUpdate() to go through and check all meditations and
     randomly collapse them.  But in fact, each object must be
     hardcoded in to be checked for.  I will rewrite it later.  For now
     I added MagicCarpetID to the list of things to check for.  NOW
     FIXED.

 68. BUG: Damaged objects don't make their attack sounds, death sounds
     or kill sounds!  NOW FIXED.

 69. I Changed the combat, death and kill sounds determination code to
     play the sound associated with that SPECIFIC ID.  If it doesn't
     have one then it checks if this thing is in a group and if it is
     then it uses the sound from the Groupid (if the Groupid has a
     sound).  This allows super maximum flexibility because now a
     Winged Lion could have a different kill, death or combat sound
     than the regular Lion.  There is no immediate need for this but
     the need will arise in the future.

 70. RS: There once was a T-Rex who came along to fight against me. I
     stopped it with some undeads and shot a Toxity Beam at it. Its
     magical resistance dropped him dead within three turns, but I
     wondered how it could continue fighting with its full strength of
     15, though it ought to loose one point per turn? JC: Thank you for
     reporting this bug! I just spent a whole hour fixing it.

 71. BUG!  Manoeverability, combat, ranged combat and special combat
     recovery don't work right!  Example: if some thing with max
     manoeverability and max combat gets hit with toxicity beam then
     his combat and manoever stats NEVER DECREASE!  Even though all his
     recovery rates are at -1!  NOW FIXED.

 72. Included Xav's new Derro, Eagle, Faun and Hybsil.

 73. STUPID: Computer wizards sit next to 4 Dark Woods, taking 8 points
     of damage each turn, even though there are MANY safe squares that
     the wizard could move to!  NOW FIXED.

 74. I designed the numbers 0-30 in a nice smoothed out manner using a
     6 point font.  I made red and green versions.  This is for use in
     the new CellEffects.

 75. I took Xav's new Attack CellEffect made 31 versions of it (0-30)
     using red numbers.  This will be the new standard Attack cell
     effect.  The 0-30 is to show the damage being done.  30 is the
     maximum damage that can ever be inflicted by a single hit (max
     combat + Battle Cry)

 76. I took the old original Attack CellEffect and improved it a little
     and then made 31 versions of it for use as the new Healing
     CellEffect.  We really need a better animation for this though.

 77. Did the programming to display the new attack and heal fx in the
     game.  This requires rewriting CellEffect() to take YET ANOTHER
     parameter for the damage (or intensity) of the effect.  Most
     effects will be ignoring this parameter, at least at first.  For
     now only the Attack and Heal effect will make use of the damage
     (intensity) parameter to display the amount of damage being done
     during the attack. DONE

 78. BUG: Speech for Blood Worm does not work.  NOW FIXED.

 79. RS: But what about Torment and Discard? My computer-allies really
     like to cast that on me. JC: Ok, good point! I just now fixed it
     so that Torment and Discard use the same AI as Coercion. This
     means they won't cast it if ALL the wizards are on the same team.
     I don't know what to do about if you and 1 computer guy are in an
     alliance against several other wizards.

 80. INCLUDED Robin's new Kurzanleitung v1.2 (he edited Valwit's v1.1)

 81. INCLUDED Robin's new Deutsch spell descriptions A-S.

 82. Robin sent in a very nice 3x3 squares gfx of an explosion!  For
     use by the Goblin Bomb or Hand Grenade or whatever we want!  Now I
     must figure out how to load the thing into the game.  Should it be
     a .iff or a .anim or a .animbrush or ?

 83. CURSOR KEYS: There are certain times during the game where I just
     want to smoothly and easily check the life of a bunch of things in
     a straight line.  There is no easy way to do this with the mouse.
     I try pressing the cursor keys to move the mouse pointer but
     nothing happens.  Also, in the level editor there are DEFINITELY
     LOTS of times where I need cursor key control.  Like when I am
     trying to just quickly build a long wall.  So I have now
     programmed the cursor keys to move the mouse pointer exactly 16
     pixels in the chosen direction.  NOW FIXED.

 84. Xav sent in BAZILLIONS of nice tiles!!!!  Lots of walls but no
     damaged variations.

 85. RS: A creature just attacked the (enemy) Magic Tree his wizard
     sits on.  Kinda stupid? JC: Ok I have now adjusted the AI code to
     realize that attacking an ENEMY unit with a FRIENDLY wizard
     mounted on it is stupid.  This includes attacking with combat or
     ranged combat. NOW FIXED.

 86. STUPID: Computer creatures will heal friendly units (such as Magic
     Trees and Castles) which have ENEMY wizards inside them!  This
     includes healing with combat and ranged combat.  NOW FIXED.

 87. BUG: PlayNextThemeSong() is blindly opening and reading and writing
     files with no error checking!  This causes the game to crash when
     run from a write-protected media.  Most CD's are write-protected.
     :) NOW FIXED.

 88. BUG: UpdateTimeSpentPlayingChaos() terminates the game as soon as
     it fails to write to the update file.  Which means it will always
     terminate the game when run from CD.  NOW FIXED.

 89. BUGs: Various pieces of code in start.c call TerminateChaos() as
     soon as any disk write operation fails.  So the game will just
     quit and not start from CD.  NOW FIXED.

 90. Ok, now the game runs from CD but there are various annoyances: 1.
     A requester pops up twice each turn saying "Volume CD0: is
     write-protected" "Retry/Cancel". (Once for PlayNextThemeSong() and
     once for UpdateTimeSpentPlayingChaos()). 2. The game now tries to
     rebuild the indexes of all the thousands of translation and
     graphic and sound files EACH and EVERY time you load the game from
     CD. This makes a huge delay every time you load the game.
     SOLUTION: Make PlayNextThemeSong() check for write-protectedness
     of the disk and set a global variable DiskIsWriteProtected
     appropriately. Then all the "file-writing" pieces of code can
     check this and avoid all writes. NOW FIXED. Chaos can now be
     played from CD or other write-protected media.

 91. UPLOADED v3.04cd to Aminet with the CD-fix and the "special combat
     against nobody" fix.

 92. BUG: I can't get any INACTIVEWINDOW messages! :( I was going to
     program in "pause mode" to stop the animation whenever you click
     to another program.  This would save millions of CPU cycles. But I
     never get any IDCMP INACTIVEWINDOW messages! What is going on?!???
     OK All wrong code NOW FIXED.

 93. PAUSE MODE now works perfectly!  Anytime you click into some other
     window of some other program the CHAOSANIM task stops animating
     the screen.  I had thought this would be a good feature years ago
     but I didn't know how to do it.  This can greatly reduce the
     multitasking cpu load.  This feature is dedicated to Robin Schmidt
     who asked for it.

 94. INClUDED Artur's B Polski descriptions.

 95. INCLUDED the following gfx from Imbe into the game! Aesculapius
     Agathion (Weird effect :)) I put in his Brown Bear as the new
     Grizzly Bear! (It was too blocky so I antialiased it just a
     little) Chronomancer! Combat Drain Beam (use old Combat Drain Beam
     as one of the other beam drain spells?) Consecrate looks great! So
     do the variations! Cursed Sword (I antialiased it) Dao (WOW!) I
     antialiased it a bit. Demonic Touch Beam Horse (I fixed it and
     antialiased it.) Marid (WOW!) Wight (He looks very scary!) Wizard
     4 (I had to scoot it over 1 and test it! The 1st frame was in the
     corpse area) Wizard 5 looks similar to Marid. Wizard 8 (I had to
     scoot this one over also) HE LOOKS COOL! Betrayal (imp turning
     away from master) I had to antialias it some and add some more
     detail. Subversion (imp facing master being charmed with magic) I
     had to antialias it some and add some more detail. Imbe is
     officially inducted as a member of the Chaos gfx team! Go Imbe go!
     Yay Imbe!

 96. BUG: Sometimes if you press the L, S or C keys in a certain way
     then you can cheat because the little boxes have erased a small
     part of the gfx and it allows you to have Line of sight to things
     that you are NOT supposed to be able to see!  This bug only
     happens in NONexploration mode.  Exploration mode does all its LOS
     testing on the ShadowBoard so it is unaffected by any lines drawn
     onto the screen. Modify all keypresses to eliminate that LOS bug!
     DO NOT ERASE THE LINES, yes that is fast but it is incorrect. The
     actual graphic of the cell must be redrawn! ALL NOW FIXED.

 97. PROBLEM: When the dungeon is composed of Apple Woods, each turn
     takes forever!  This is because EVERY Apple Wood, performs special
     combat on EVERY other Apple Wood!  I have now implemented a new
     menu option for Silent Special Combat.  So this is NOW FIXED.

 98. I fixed Imbe's new Pegasus with better antialiasing.  It is a
     combination of Xav's Pegasus with Imbe's animation.  Teamwork
     rulez. :)

 99. Included Artur's Polski Spell descriptions A.

100. FD: * I threw a hand grenade on a (cloaked) wizard surrounded by 2
     generators and 1 cow catapult (and another creature IIRC). But
     each of the 5 objects gave an alleluiah, and all were completely
     destroyed, except for the wizard (but they shouldn't have been
     destroyed since they had enough life points). On the subsequent
     bonus pannel I got 5 bonus kills: five times the same wizard (who
     got killed by another creature in the meantime).  JC: NOW FIXED.

101. WAAAAAAAAAAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!! PATCHWORK RULEZ!!!!!!!!
     BUG: JCsound is doing a FindPort() without a Forbid() Permit()!!!!
     This is TERRIBLE! The reason I didn't know about it, (or even
     think about it) is because the JCsound source code is in its own
     dir so Flashfind from "" FindPort doesn't find anything when I am
     in the Chaos dir. (I am always in the chaos dir.) I had no idea
     this code was in there! Its just some cut & pasted code from
     Aminet to interface to the minrexx.c SOUND BUG NOW FIXED THANKS TO
     ARTUR CHLEBEK! ALL HAIL KING ARTUR!

102. During my test game I found another little flaw with PatchWork
     involving InitSemaphore(&flashysem).  NOW FIXED.

103. I no longer get those "Semaphore has nesting of 1, expecting 0"
     messages when I quit the developer version.  This is sort of
     strange because that message is only involved with the BoardLock
     semaphore not the flashysem semaphore.  More unsolved OS
     weirdnesses.

104. Included Xav's new Centaur, Horse, Hybsil and Unicorn into the
     game.  They have MUCH better running animations now!

105. I drank some caffeine (I haven't had any caffeine in around 10
     days) and sat down and anti-aliased the Marid and the Wizard 5.

106. I changed 1 frame of the Wight.  I antialiased Wizard 8.

107. I'm using Xav's new animated wall as the Force Wall. I thought
     about using it as the new Power Wall but the Power Wall has 9
     damage variations and the Force Wall graphic has 0 damaged
     variations. I don't have time to draw the damaged variations right
     now. Perhaps later on Imbe, Robin or Xav will do them if they want.

108. Force Wall: It would take some serious magic to get one of these
     onto your spell list. In fact, thus far, no wizard has ever
     succeeded in getting a Force Wall onto his spell list. These walls
     are just about impossible to obtain and are damn near
     indestructable. Many military complexes and dungeons have been
     built from these walls for exactly these reasons.

109. I antialiased Wizard 1.  Then I experimented with some lighting
     fx, added a couple of frames and the result is... I'm not sure if
     its good or just annoying.  What do you think?

110. Included Xav's new Bird Lord, Pox Shield and Ride gfx.  The Ride
     gfx is much MUCH better now!  Thank you!

111. Included the following new gfx from Imbe: Discard (I antialiased
     it) Earthquake Shield Falcon (It was totally broken due to large
     amounts of color 32 splattered around. Then I antialiased it.)
     Fire Shield Wizard 7 (I like the magic flowing up and down the
     staff and the hand movement. I don't like the foot movement. While
     the head floating off is rather funny, I'm not sure I really like
     that in a wizard animation. I guess we will vote on this one.)
     Wizard 8 (need to antialias this!) Elephant

112. Included Xav's updated Derro, Nightmare, Omnibiologist, Shadow City

113. Xav's Disection has a VERY cool looking lightning bolt on it and I
     really like it!  _but_ when I look at 1 (lightning bolt) 2 it
     makes me think that a lightning bolt will hit the target and split
     it into 2 parts.  So I modified this gfx to look like a 1/2 symbol
     since the spell cuts everyone's life in 1/2.

114. WOW! Joseph just taught me how to do Stencils in Dpaint!  This is
     totally cool!  If I would have known about this before I could
     have saved at least 30 mins of time when editing Imbe's Wizard 8
     to have Xav's new Wizard 8 clothes!

115. I Put the fixed JCsound + the Semaphorefix into v3.04 and then
     UPLOADED v3.05 to Aminet.

116. Zoltan sent in a mod he made himself titled The Mysterious Land,
     at first I wasn't going to use it because I don't like listening
     to it "by itself" but now I am going to included it into the game
     because I think it will be ok music to listen to "in the game"
     while looking at pix of magic spells and fire breathing dragons
     and such.  I like the composition of this mod, (its mysterious :)
     I just wish the instruments were higher quality.  This mod was
     submitted in XPKSQSH format so only users with XPK.library
     installed will ever hear it.

117. Zoltan sent in another mod titled Land of Magic by Elvis.  Its
     very nice sounding with excellent instruments but its very very
     short.  It sounds like an "Artur Chlebek Mod" :)   Maybe someone
     will lengthen it someday?

118. Xav sent in more gfx!  Drain: The old Drain matches the opposite
     spell (Haste).  But your new Drain looks better so I'm using it.
     Jann: Included into the game.  Joker: I really like him!  But he
     looks like a creature, not a magic spell.  So I don't know what to
     do with this...  We need 32x32 tiles for this then we could make
     him look like he is a pic on a playing card.  That would be a
     perfect Joker.  For this moment he goes into gfx/UnusedGfx/ while
     I decide what to do with him.  Radioactive Land: I like this new
     version much better!  Thundermare: It looks better but I'm not
     sure if this should be the new Thundermare or the new Iridium
     Horse?  I guess I will wait till someone makes a new Iridium Horse
     then I will decide. :) Vitality: Wow!  Both the new versions are
     very cool!  I included this into the game and I hope I can think
     up a new spell to use the yellow-heart version!  *think* *think*
     damn I can't think of anything... oh well...  maybe someday.
     Wizard 7: I don't really like the Leg Movement.  I added your
     version onto the Wizard 7 Screen.  There are now 3 main versions
     on that screen: The James version, The Imbe version and the Xav
     version.  Wizard 8: Auugh!  We both did the same work!  My version
     had some wrong color #32 which I fixed.  I cut & pasted your tile
     17 into my version.  Rest of tiles: I don't know what to do...
     Maybe I should stick to coding from now on. :)

119. BUG: If a mounted wizard moves into a pit then the wizard becomes
     "there but not there".  He isn't there so he can't move and he
     can't be killed.  But he is there so he can still cast spells.
     NOW FIXED.

120. BUG: If an Aerial Servant is on a scroll and flies 10 squares away
     into a pit, then the Aerial Servant dies as normal but the scroll
     he was standing on disappears also!  Even though the scroll was
     nowhere near the pit!  NOW FIXED.

121. BUG: If a creature is standing on a dead body and moves into a pit
     then the dead body disappears!  NOW FIXED.

122. SLOW: Aerial Servants always take a couple of seconds to decide
     who to attack.  I think this is due to the DangerousnessRating()
     routine being very very slow.  It is filled with lots of redundant
     array bounds checking and uses lots of array indexes instead of
     pointers.  I have now rewritten this so it should be at least 2x
     as fast now.  NOW FIXED.

123. I speeded up RaiseDeadRating() in the same manner as
     DangerousnessRating();

124. RS: You should teach the computer that sleeping creatures are not
     really worth attacking. Situation: Vampire (sleeping) next to a
     Green Dragon (enemy), both next to one of eight wizards who all
     play in the same team (thus making the danger of someone calling
     Wake on the vampire void (if one can say that?)). The wizard
     (upgraded with Sword of Sassenrath) attacked the vampire, the
     dragon then killed the wizard. Ouch! JC: NOW FIXED.

125. Implemented a table of CellAddress[] to store the address of the
     first byte of each cell on the board.  This allows fast and easy
     lookup by my upcoming asm rendering/animation routines.

126. IMPLEMENTED DrawBlankCell() and DrawBlankCellShadow()

127. BIZARRE BUG: If you are playing a game in Exploration Mode and for
     some reason a requester should appear onto the game screen (for
     example a "Disk is Write Protected" requester) then you can cheat
     by moving the window around.  It somehow _magically_ uncovers any
     stuff (creatures, scrolls, inanimate objects, anything) in the
     unexplored territory!  Yet it doesn't mess up any gfx at all!
     It's totally bizarre!  I always wondered how on Earth this was
     possible.  Now I figured it out!  It was all because when I set up
     the ShadowBoardRastPort I just copied the rastPort of the main
     board into it!  This copied the layers information which caused
     the OS to provide this most unique and amazing behavior.  I have
     now changed the code to just do an
     InitRastPort(ShadoBoardRastPort); so this is all NOW FIXED.

128. Included: Artur's Polski spell descriptions for the 16 new spells
     introduced after v3.04.  His spell description translations are now
     complete except for the 6 new spells I added in the last couple of
     months.

129. Included Artur's new Vampire attack and death sounds.  They are
     high-quality but very long.  The attack sound is about 6 seconds
     long!  I think people will complain about this.  Oh well then they
     can make their own new Vampire attack sound or they can turn off
     the combat sounds.

130. Included Robin's complete 366 Deutsch spell descriptions, latest
     Deutsch.catalog and Talklistsdir/Deutsch file.

131. STUPID: Basalt Golems shoot things that have 0 movement points.
     NOW FIXED.

132. STUPID: Spectators attack things that have 0 manuverability points.
     NOW FIXED.

133. STUPID: Spectators keep constantly attacking my Conwell's Cow
     Catapult even though it already has 0 maneuverability and they
     aren't hurting it at all!  NOW FIXED.

134. STUPID: All creatures which attack only non-lethal stats (such as
     Maneuver, Move, Combat, Ranged Combat, Special Combat, all
     Recovery rates) will frequently make useless attacks against
     creatures whose stats are already as low as they can go!  NOW
     FIXED.

135. I optimized the IsStupidAttack() and IsStupidShot() routines to
     speed them up.  But then I had to add tons of new code to check
     for useless attacks so all in all it will be just as slow as
     before or even slower.  I think this is why it takes so long for
     an Aerial Servant to decide who to attack; its because he must
     check nearly every square on the board if it is a stupid attack or
     not.  Its a rather large hunk of code that must be executed for
     each sqare.

136. I added code to IsStupidAttack() and IsStupidShot()to check for
     and avoid useless healing attacks.  Such as Hippocrates healing
     someone who already has MAX_LIFE.  I've never seen such a thing
     happen, and in fact I think the other AI routines prevent this
     from ever happening... but the code is in there now just in case.

137. PROBLEM: If you attack an enemy Hippocrates' Combat statistic it
     actually gets better! The Hippocrates becomes a better healer than
     ever before! NOW FIXED. See below.

138. PROBLEM: If you heal your Hippocrates' Combat statistic (for
     example shooting him with Aesculapius) then the Combat actually
     gets worse! It can even become positive so that Hippocrates
     becomes a fighter like everyone else! NOW FIXED. See below.

139. CHANGED: Now if you attack someone's Combat, Special Combat or
     Ranged Combat you make their stat move towards 0. You do NOT
     mathematically lower it.

140. Fixed the program with deutsch talklists by making the maximum
     length of a listname be 256 chars AND I put error checking code in
     to return an error if any listname is over 256 chars. NOW FIXED.

141. NOTE ABOUT TALKLISTS: You should try to make sure that your
     generated sentences cannot go over about 220 chars because that is
     about the realistic maximum amount of text that will fit onto the
     bottom of the screen. However if you accidentally exceed this, no
     harm will be done because the internal buffer is 512 bytes long
     for the entire sentence. If you somehow generate a sentence longer
     than 512 bytes then *BOOM*.

142. Included: Xav's new gfx: Cat Lord Discard Earthquake Shield (Nice
     Shading!) Fire Shield (Nice Shading) Vampire (I always liked the
     old Vampire. He's not perfect but I like gfx with waving cloaks :)
     Old Vampire's legs could have been better. But the new Xav Vampire
     is a better animation and design so I'm using it.) Virtue:
     HeheheheheHAHAHAHAHA OWW! I'M DYING LAUGHING! :-D

143. Included: Imbe's new gfx: Falcon (He added 1 frame) There was a
     line of color #32 in the corpse tile which I removed.  I
     antialiased all frames a little bit.  The Falcon is Awesome!  Fly:
     I antialiased it and improved the back wing.  If this were an
     animation it would make a FANTASTIC Pixie creature!  Generator:
     COWABUNGA!  Nice animation!  NOTE to Imbe: please press the "g"
     key to turn on the grid (16x16) when you move the old animation
     around on the screen.  That way it is always placed correctly.
     Thank you. :) Ghast: Wow, this is weird looking.  I antialised it
     and made it look much better but I think Xav needs to examine this
     gfx.  Be sure to watch it as an actual animation in the game.  It
     doesn't look like a Ghast to me.  It looks like some sort of
     strange alien creature or sea creature.  Ghoul:  I don't know what
     to do about antialiasing this. (???)  I leave it to the
     professional. :)  The red dots animation could be somehow better.
     Giant Rat: I antialiased the tail.

144. Imbe New Cell Effects: Attack: Its very nice! But I already made a
     new attack cell effect out of Xav's animation + my numbers. So we
     need to think up a reason to use this NEW Imbe attack fx. Does
     anyone have any ideas? For healing attacks? For poisoning attacks?
     For attacks against statistics other than life? ???  Twirl:
     WAHOO!!!!  Finally a new Twirl gfx!!!!  I TOTALLY _HATE_ the old
     Twirl cell effect!  The old Twirl gfx hurt my eyes!  This new one
     is much better!  But it could be better still.  I quickly
     single-pixel antialiased it but it really needs double-pixel
     antialiazation.  NOTE TO EVERYONE: Cell Effects can use LOTS of
     frames, like 50 or 100 or whatever.  I can _EASILY_ play cell
     effects animations at 25 or 50 fps so we can use _REALLY_ detailed
     animations on these if you want to make them.

145. Added support for parameters in talklists.

146. I sent the help files, the latest .catalog file and the 8 new spell
     descriptions files to FD for translation and proofreading.  I
     recieved FD's translated help files, catalog file and all 8 new
     spell descriptions!  In only 24 hours!  Frédéric Delacroix earns
     "Fastest Translator in the West" award! (again)

147. Included Xav's new Abath gfx.

148. RS: A wizard just cast Chainsaw twice on one creature?!? JC: NOW
     FIXED.

149. Included Robin's Deutsch help files.

150. Robin sent in a bunch of cell effects animations!  Some of them
     are 100 tiles long!  WOW!  But I'm in the middle of coding on
     JCsound so I will have to look at them and/or program them in
     later.

151. Imbe sent in a new Vulture but I haven't had time to decide if I
     should use it as a Vulture or as some other flying creature?

152. More work on JCsound about sticking in a loop.

153. PROBLEM: When playing a sample with the -2 option the startup code
     is allocating too many buffers. NOW FIXED.

154. PROBLEM: Sometimes when playing sound with the -2 option (The -2
     option is almost always used when playing sounds in Chaos) the
     sound channels start at different times. They are unsynchronized.
     This causes no real harm but I think Artur complained about it
     so... I spent some hours studying the RKRMs and the Amiga C Manual
     and I finally figured out how to start 2 channels playing
     simultaneously. IF the RKRMs are correct and IF the Amiga OS
     audio.device functions as specified then it should now be
     IMPOSSIBLE for the channels to become desynchronized. NOW FIXED.

155. I made some more optimizations to save 128 bytes of code size.

156. I changed the priority setting of JCsound to the first line of
     code so that, under a heavy multitasking load it will get started
     much faster.

157. I think there was a bug in the stereo playback.  NOW FIXED.

158. Implemented perfect synchronization code on the stereo samples!

159. I Sent Zoltan the 16 new spell descriptions + the 8 new spell
     descriptions + the help files for translation.

160.  I only sent Artur the 16 new spell descriptions. I Still need to
     send  Artur the 8 new spell descriptions and the help files!

161. Imbe wants a level with every single monster on it.  I had planned
     to do this for Xav many months ago but I just never got around to
     it and Xav never asked for such a thing soo...  I hacked in some
     code today: Make a quick loop attached to the Z key to insert
     every ID that is a creature, alternating between player 1 and
     player 8.

162. I made another level with all the growths in large blocks for Imbe.

163. Robin sent in a spell file and description and sound effect for the
     Soulsucker.  The spell file and sound effect are good.  I think I
     liked the description given in the Email better than this
     description though.  When I implement this I will need to go back
     and read that Email. (search for soulsucker).

164. Problem: My "Chaos" sound sample in Mod.ChaosTheme13 sounds pretty
     dorky.  Robin processed the sample and now it sounds sorta cool.
     Its very evil sounding!  Sounds almost demonic.  Augh!  He's
     revealed my true nature!

165. Try opening the audio.device ONLY ONCE for both channels. (?) Look
     in that Amiga programming book! That is how they did it! Many many
     many experiments and rewrites deleted. They all crashed one way or
     another.

166. I carefully added 1 line of code at a time, recompiled and tested
     repeatedly, over and over, until I had all the code in to guarantee
     perfectly synchronized mono x2 and stereo sound sample playback.
     Everything seems to work perfectly!!!

167. I then went back and redid all the FreeMem's to go in perfect
     reverse order.  This will allegedly reduce memory fragmentation.

168. I tested JCsound a zillion times and it always works for me now.

169. Included Xav's wild new Ghoul!  Its an improved, colorized,
     antialiased version of Imbe's Ghoul.

170. Included Imbe's new gfx: Falcon (it moves up and down very
     smoothly) Golden Dragon (I antialiased it some more) Gravity
     Sphere (What is it? It looks nothing like a sphere. :) But it
     looks better than the old gfx so I'm using it. I antialiased it.)
     Grizzly Bear: He added a frame and changed some frames. (There was
     a bug: a line of hard black color #32 in the corpse. Now Fixed.)
     Ok, I watched the Grizzly Bear in the game and this animation still
     needs some work, it jumps badly in one spot. It needs 1 more frame
     between the

171. MORE audio.device strangeness. (Letter to FD)

172. I trimmed down the Generator gfx to only go through each color
     once.

173. I double antialiased Imbe's Twirl effect and now it looks better.

174.  BUG! THE SPELLS GADGET IS BROKEN!  Now matter how many spells you
     say you want, you always get 99.  I wanted to play a quick game
     with only 10 spells and I noticed this! How long has it been like
     this? Ever since I added that code to put your bonus spells at the
     top of your list.  So its been broken since December 31, 2000.
     NOW FIXED.

175. BUG: Play an exploration game as player 1  against a computer
     player 8.  Now load a game of a human player 8 vs. a computer
     player 1.  You will see the position of the enemy Player 1  for a
     second in the beginning!  This is cheating!  NOW FIXED!

176. FIXED some stupid bugs in the AI.

177. Resaved Mod.ChaosTheme61 from XPKSQSH to normal uncompressed
     format.

178. Included Artur's 8 new polski spell descriptions.

179. Included Artur's Polski help files.

180. Studied 060 asm coding techniques.

181. RS: BUG: Tribal Dance mod doesn't play when casting Tribal Dance.
     This was very strange because it had always worked for me but I
     finally figured it out. I was playing the mod CreatureName(spell)
     which uses the name of the spell IN THE CURRENT LANGUAGE. Thus the
     mod would not play in any language other than English. I have now
     changed it to the correct creature_name[spell]. NOW FIXED.

182. I studied the proposed new 256 color palette and did various tests
     and made observations.

183. I made a new version of JCsound based on FD's theory for the
     audio.device bugs. (v1.4x  x=eXperimental)  Sent it to Artur for
     testing.  Robin and Artur report that it works perfectly in the
     shell in mono in a 15.75Khz screenmode but that it does not work
     in a 30Khz screenmode with the -2 option.

184. I made a proposed AGA palette alpha version 1 with 125 defined
     colors which contains all the existing ECS colors + more shades.
     Sent it to Xav and Robin for comments, complaints, criticisms, etc.

185. I made yet another new version of JCsound with some changed code
     for the -2 option. (V1.4x1)  Sent it to Artur and Robin.  Now I
     made 1.4x2 and sent it to them.  They report this one works
     perfectly.

186. The final bug in JCsound was that I was doing CMD_WRITE to the
     left channel then to the right channel. So I just assumed that the
     left channel would finish first and the right channel would finish
     last. But some times (all the time?) the buffers finished in
     reverse order! So JCsound would get a signal from the right port
     FIRST then a little later a signal would arrive from the left
     port. If the signals had arrived in the correct order or AT THE
     SAME TIME as I assumed then things would have been working
     perfectly for a long time. Anyway its all NOW FIXED.

Improvements from 3.07 to 3.1
-----------------------------

  1. Included Xav's hilarious new Amphisbaena animation!

  2. STUPID: When playing with artifacts, computer wizards frequently
     cast Alliance on artifacts belonging to NOBODY.  NOW FIXED.

  3. STUPID: Sometimes computer players cast alliance onto people who
     are already on their team!  NOW FIXED.

  4. STUPID: When playing a game 1 human vs 7 enemy wizards who are all
     on the same team against the human, eventually 1 of the wizards
     will cast Alliance onto the human then EVERYBODY is on the same
     team!  NOW FIXED.

  5. STUPID: Computer players refuse to ever cast a double or triple
     alliance spell.  NOW FIXED.

  6. Hacked and slashed Attila the Hun's labyrinth generation algorithm
     into Chaos and tested it about 40 times.  It worked perfectly
     every time!  Only playtesting will reveal if this new option will
     be any fun or not.  Hopefully it will at least be an interesting
     diversion to try out from time to time.

  7. Added code to properly put together Power Walls. What should this
     new option be called? I was originally going to call it Maze Wars
     but it isn't exactly a maze. More of a dungeon. Here are some
     ideas for naming this option: Maze Wars Maze Fight Dungeon Dungeon
     Wars Dungeon Fight

  8. Added code for secondary and tertiary constructs.

  9. Added DungeonWars to the savegamefile io.c and to the prefs.c

 10. Added the Dungeon Wars gadget to the setupscreen 2.

 11. Made 126 tiles for the upcoming Tower.

 12. Made 72 ID's for the upcoming Tower.

 13. BUG: When a creature with a Telescope is promoted, it loses its
     Telescope.  NOW FIXED.

 14. BUG: Any creature which is given any enhanced sight, smell,
     hearing or feeling will lose those enhancements when promoted.
     NOW FIXED.

 15. Edited the website a bunch.

 16. FD: BTW, I think Chaos does not correctly handle saved games with
     a space in the name. Probably quotes missing in the lha command
     line.  W FIXED.

 17. Included Wolverine's new Magyar.catalog.

 18. FLAW: Every time you start a game the 1st dungeon is the same as
     the 1st dungeon of the last time you loaded the game.  2nd is the
     same as the 2nd, etc.  rnd_seek is now loaded from
     IntuitionBase->Micros so this is NOW FIXED.

 19. FLAW: If you play Dungeon Wars mode with 99 generators, the board
     is pretty much solid on turn 1 with _many_ generators blocked off.
     NOW FIXED.

 20. BUG: If you start a game with 99 Generators and 99 scrolls and 99
     artifacts The game gets stuck in an infinite loop.  NOW FIXED.

 21. Allow generators to be placed on empty squares OR in place of
     inanimate objects OR on top of dead bodies OR on top of scrolls.
     DONE.

 22. Allow scrolls to be placed under generators, under the dungeon
     pieces or in empty spaces or on top of dead bodies. DONE.

 23. Allow artifacts to be placed on top of scrolls, on top of dead
     bodies or into empty squares. DONE.

 24. BUG: If you play with Dungeon Wars + 99 generators + 99 artifacts
     then the game still gets stuck in an infinite loop because there
     isn't enough room to place all the artifacts.  NOW FIXED.  TESTED
     and works perfectly!

 25. Problem: I can't stand the way Standard Walls look on the Dungeon
     Wars maps.  The color between the bricks looks very bad IMHO.  It
     should either be a _very_ dark red or black.  NOW FIXED.

 26. Problem: I can't stand the way Weak Walls look either.  The color
     between the bricks should be either a _very_ dark yellow or black.
     NOW FIXED.

 27. Problem: The Hwall and Vwall pieces of Power Walls don't look so
     good when they are the last piece on the end and not connected to
     anything.  NOW FIXED.

 28. PROBLEM: Lha 2.1 is buggy and crashes the machine, which is why I
     use lha 1.35.  However, users with lha 2.1 seem to have an lhaopts
     file which uses parameters that don't work on lha 1.35.  This
     causes game saving and loading to not work.  So I have now hacked
     lha 1.35 to NOT try to read the lhaopts file.  NOW FIXED.

 29. The translation of "Magic Resistance" in the Magyar.catalog is
     "Mágia ellenállóképesség" which is wayyy tooooo long to fit on
     the  info panel.  I am shortening it down to Mágia Ellenállás.

 30. Manõverezhetõség is also toooo long. I am shortening it to
     Manõver.

 31. Generated the IP1 screen for Magyar finally.

 32. Put Ruthlessness and Dungeon Wars into the ChaosDocs.texinfo then
     sent it to FD.

 33. Made the first couple of screenshots of Chaos.

 34. Included Robin's new OPQ Deutsch descriptions.

 35. NEW GFX: Included Xav's great new Optometron of Omniscience and
     Exit gfx!

 36. I updated HelpWanted.html, installation.html, requirements.html,
     legal.html, features.html, chaos.html and index.html,
     HelpWanted.html a bit.

 37. STUPID: If you shoot your allied wizard repeatedly he won't cast
     his Separation spell if he has one.  NOW FIXED.  Above fix meant I
     had to change the gamesave format so I went ahead and added in the
     the 2 WORDs for the 5 leather armors and 5 chainmails spells +
     added in some unused LONGs while I was at it. DONE.

 38. You can shoot an allied wizard who has a reflector and it won't
     make him mad.

 39. You can shoot an allied wizard or any allied creation with 0 or
     negative combat and it won't make him mad.  In fact, shooting your
     allies with healing combat will make them like you more.  Tested
     and works perfectly!

Improvements from 3.06 to 3.07
------------------------------

  1. The color cycling of Special Combat on the info panel has always
     been unsatisfactory and crappy looking.  Now I see why I put off
     fixing this for so long.  It just took me 2 hours to get it all
     working correctly.  NOW FIXED.

  2. Mod.ChaosTheme60 was playing much to slowly so I converted it to
     MED format. DONE.

  3. BUG: When a creature is promoted they lose their exophagy and
     scavenging powerups!  NOW FIXED.

  4. I finally added a (lame) chainsaw sound for the chainsaw.  We can
     now easily add new "weapon spells" that cause a certain sound to
     be played during combat.  Someone needs to take a chainsaw out and
     cut some wood with it and record it.  Especially the sound of it
     getting jammed up in the wood.

  5. Must modify promotion() to keep the new .WeaponSoundStat intact.
     DONE.

  6. PARAGRAPH BREAKS are now supported in the spell descriptions! Now
     we don't have to have long run-on super-huge spell descriptions
     all in 1 giant paragraph. I tested this by editing the
     descriptions for Points, Devastation, Alliance and Standard Wall.
     It works great and looks much nicer, especially on Devastation! I
     suppose someone should go over all the spell descriptions and see
     if they need paragraph breaks and put them in.  I'm really unclear
     as to where to place paragraph breaks. It often seems like we need
     one after almost every sentence. Note to FD: I hope this doesn't
     break any Arexx->AmigaGuide document scripts or anything.

  7. Robin sent in some Deutsch spell-descriptions (A-E).

  8. I sent a COMPLETE English spells archive to Robin and Wolverine
     today.

  9. I implemented help screens. They are attached to the help key.
     These are mainly for newbie neophytes on their very first game.
     But the "Help/Show me all the keys" option will be useful to
     everyone all the time. If you press help/What do I do now!?!? then
     it is context sensitive depending on what phase of the game you
     are in (spell selection, spell casting or movement).

 10. Included Xav's bugfixed new Generator gfx into the game.

 11. FIXED Golden Dragon description: It said "vain" instead of "vein".

 12. CHANGED: the highlight sprite from #3 to #2 and adjusted the asm
     code in the vain hope that it will now work in dblpal.

 13. MYSTERIOUS BUG: Every once in a while, after I've been playing the
     game for a long time and I am running lots of other programs, I
     will go to save the game and the save game screen will freak out
     and cause lots of enforcer hits and not print the word "SAVE"
     along the side of the screen. This has happened several times over
     the last several months. I finally figured out what it was! The
     reason the bug only happened randomly is that, normally if you
     close a font it is still there in memory and your pointer will
     still work, unless you get low on memory or manually force a flush
     of all unused resources such as typing "avail flush" in the shell.
     NOW FIXED.

 14. Included Xav's new Wood Elf and Dread Elf into the game.

 15. I replaced wizard graphic #3 with Xav's Club Juggler, at least
     until we go to 32x32 256 color tiles.

 16. Robin reports some flaws in the spell descriptions: Meddle (change
     than->the).

 17. Included Xav's new Dire Wolf and Arctic Wolf into the game.  They
     are very blurry but oh well... I'll be glad when we make a hires
     version.

 18. Included Xav's new Gray Elf.  He's a bit tall for an Elf but oh
     well..

 19. Chaos needs a website!  But there is no point in having a website
     without screenshots!  But everyone on Team Chaos says the same
     thing "I don't know how to make a screenshot of Chaos".  Well I
     can't wait any longer for someone to figure this stuff out sooo....

 20. Spent some hours investigating all the screengrabbers on Aminet.
     NONE of them claimed to work with a multiscreen view so I didn't
     dl any of them.  The one grabber that I TRIED to download, I
     couldn't because my ISP sux SO BADLY that it would dl at 60 cps
     for 15 mins and then just abort. :(

 21. Xav made a new super-cool 42-frame animation of a worm.  This
     crashes the game.  Its all because I forgot to add in the code to
     go from the first row down to the 2nd row and etc.  NOW FIXED.

Improvements from 3.05 to 3.06
------------------------------

  1. Put in 13.5 megs of new ChaosThemeSongs (11-60) Music/ dir is now
     17.5 megs (17551558 bytes) We now have some spooky tunes, some
     beautiful guitar tunes, some heavy duty brain-thrashing,
     mind-melting tunes, some wonderous magical tunes and others. Amiga
     Rulez da Muzik Scene! EXTRA SPECIAL THANKS TO ALL THE MUSICIANS
     WHO CONTRIBUTED MUSIC! (Complete list in the docs)

  2. We now have some VERY small mods that can work even in very low
     memory situations. 15k, 51k, 55k

  3. We now have 4 VERY large mods (over 600K) that will only work on
     systems with 2 megs of chipram.  If you don't have a LARGE
     contiguous hunk of chipram free then you will never hear these in
     the game.  All 4 of these mods are of the "orchestral" variety so
     if you are tired of hearing a "hardcore 90's rave soundtrack" all
     the time then free up some chipram so you can hear these moving
     musical masterpieces.

  4. Well I was hanging around not really feeling like doing much of
     anything when I suddenly thought up an idea for why the Ghost and
     other long sound samples sometimes freak out and crash the
     computer. I thought perhaps the WaitJCSound() routine's use of
     FindPort() could be disabling multitasking for long periods of
     time. So I looked up FindPort() on the developer CD to see if
     there were any warnings that it disables multitasking for long
     periods of time and... YIKERZ! I found something much worse! It
     has a warning that it does NOT disable multitasking AT ALL so that
     ANY and ALL uses of FindPort() must be surrounded with Forbid()
     and Permit() !!! So maybe this has been causing all those weird
     random audio problems?!???? I made the appropriate changes and
     played the Ghost sound 60 times under various CPU loads and it
     never messed up! If this was the problem it would totally explain:
     1. The random nature of the bug. 2. The random mess ups of the
     JCsound, audio.device sound, and maybe even the subsongs! 3. The
     fact that the problem only seems to affect _long_ JCsound samples.
     A long sample means WaitJCSound() is calling FindPort() over and
     over and over again, waiting for it to end. I am very happy about
     finding this! Now we need to heavily test this to see if all audio
     problems are now fixed!

  5. BUG: If for some reason you have no music files in the music/ dir,
     the game crashes.  I always wondered why in the WORLD this
     happened!?  Now I know it was because of the FindPort() outside of
     Forbid().

  6. Artur fixed the English Higher Devil and Lesser Devil spell
     descriptions.  (There was a double "from").

  7. I added the sentence "Hyperclone will not replicate your wizard."
     to the Hyperclone spell description.  I also edited the first
     sentence.

  8. I removed the sentence "The powerful magic used in this spell
     usually produces a horrific, mutated copy of your wizard as a side
     effect." from the Lich Lord spell description.

  9. Zoltan complained about the Range Boost description so I fixed it
     up.

 10. BUG: JJ reports that growths assist in the control of artifacts.
     Only creatures are supposed to assist in the control of artifacts.
     NOW FIXED.

 11. FLAW: JJ reports that Biohazard MeltScreen effect lasts toooo long.
     I have now reduced it from 100 iterations down to 70.  NOW FIXED.

 12. Added all the musician's names to ChaosDocs.texinfo.

 13. Added the following default combat sounds for creatures who do not
     have a defined combat sound: Swoosh SwooshUgh BigSwooshUgh
     BigSwooshUuugh! (15 combat hit against creature) SwooshThud (These
     are used for attacking inanimates) BigSwooshThud SwooshOnMetal
     (These are used for attacking Robot or Dalek) BigSwooshOnMetal
     BigSwoosh (All BigSwoosh sounds are used for combat>=12) All 9 of
     the above sound samples combined together = only 42k!
     BigSwooshUgh is used thusly: volume=64 for 14 combat volume=60 for
     13 combat volume=56 for 12 combat SwooshUgh is used for any combat
     hit 6-11.  Volume is always 52 for this one. 6-11 = SwooshUgh
     Swoosh v=28 for 0 combat v=32 for 1 combat v=36 for 2 combat v=40
     for 3 combat v=44 for 4 combat v=48 for 5 combat samplespeed =
     8363 for all above samples. For now attacking a growth will play
     either "Swoosh" or "BigSwoosh" with no ughs.  When I find a
     suitable squishy sound I can change this to SwooshSquish and
     BigSwooshSquish. In order to implement the above sounds I had to
     change CellEffect() to take an extra paremeter for the volume.
     Then I had to spend a whole hour changing hundreds of occurrences
     of CellEffect() to have the extra parameter added. After I did
     this I once again got the dreaded >32768 error on cast.c.

 14. BUG: I've been noticing the computer controlled creatures are
     playing really stupidly even though I have Ruthlessness turned on.
     When I created the gadget for Ruthlessness I forgot to connect
     the Ruthlessness variable to it!  So Ruthlessness mode has not
     actually been working for the last week.  NOW FIXED.

 15. BUG: Mod.ChaosTheme18 starts out ok but then it starts playing too
     slowly after a while.  I have now converted it to MED MMD1 so now
     it works correctly.  NOW FIXED.

 16. BUG: A line of code was in the Growth() routine and was executed
     outside of any semaphore lock on the board! A big no no! NOW FIXED.

 17. FLAW: The last generator that generated something is still
     highlighted all throughout the Growth() phase.  NOW FIXED.

 18. FLAW: The last Agent/generator that casted/generated something
     still has text left over at the bottom of the screen during the
     Growth() phase.  NOW FIXED.

 19. NEW GFX FEATURE: I have now added code to keep animations of Green
     Ooze, Orange Jellies and Earthquakes synchronized so they look
     much better now.  This code executes at the end of the Growth()
     function.  Tested and works perfectly.

 20. 3 NEW KEYPRESSES: f for "feeling range" h for "hearing range" o for
     "olfactory range" (o = olfactory = smell)

 21. FLAW: Heal and Vox spells erroneously print a promotion message.
     NOW FIXED.

 22. Included FD's reflowed and corrected Français spell descriptions.

 23. Reflowed all Magyar Spell Descriptions.

 24. BUG: Computer wizard had 3.5 movement points but moved 3.8 squares
     to mount his horse!  NOW FIXED.

 25. BUG: Grizzly Bear had 2.5 movement points but he moved 2.8 squares
     to attack me! NOW FIXED.

 26. PROBLEM: the casting beam sound is too loud compared to the sound
     of the casting twirl effect.  This is because all algorythmically
     generated sfx use a perfectly oscillating square wave.  So I have
     now reduced the volume of algorythmic sounds from 40 down to 32
     and now everything sounds better.  NOW FIXED.

 27. I drew a new Dark Citadel graphic.

Improvements from 3.04 to 3.05
------------------------------

  1. ADDED 16 new spells including: 1 artifact creature 2 other normal
     creatures 1 meditation object 12 magic spells: 1. Global
     Thermonuclear War 2.  Conwell's Cow Catapult 3. Heal 4. Vox
     Angelica 5. Vox Celestes 6.  Resurrection 7. Magic Carpet 8.
     Tribal Dance 9. Chainsaw 10. Shambling Mound 11. Stomp 12.
     Delacroix's Decloaker 13. Night of the Living Dead 14.  Hand
     Grenade 15. Feeble 16. Martyr

  2. Chaos now has 365 spells!  1 for every day of an Earth year!

  3. Included Xav's new Feeble, Hand Grenade, and Tribal Dance gfx.  I
     put Explosion and Kamikaze into gfx/UnusedGfx/ for future use.  I
     edited his new Martyr graphic to show the Martyr hanging high up
     on the wall.

  4. I Made a new level: Equivalency1 to test all the new spells.  It
     is 1 human-controlled wizard vs. 1 computer-controlled wizard.
     Both wizards have an identical spell list.

  5. PROBLEM: When an archer loses his archery ability the arcing weapon
     effect is still drawn.  NOW FIXED.

  6. PROBLEM: When a creature that is normally not an archer, gains the
     archery ability, the straight-line weapon effect is still drawn.
     I have now fixed this to make it draw the arcing weapon effect.
     NOW FIXED.

  7. SAI: I liked the multiattack made by trees, ropers, fungi, etc.
     The only problem is that they make the attack sound even when
     there is nothing for them to attack. JC: NOW FIXED.

  8. SAI: The sound made by a computer controlled Shadow Wood is a nice
     "whoosh", but when a Shadow Wood controlled by a human player
     attacks, it is only the traditional attack sound. JC: I am playing
     a test game right now and both human and computer controlled
     Shadow Woods are making the same whoosh sound. Perhaps you meant
     Dark Woods? Or perhaps you meant Stone to Flesh'd Shadow Woods? or
     ?

  9. SAI: The Consecrate spell wraps off the edge of the screen. JC:
     NOW FIXED.

 10. Added the Gadget to control Ruthlessness on the 2nd setup screen.

 11. Added Ruthlessness to the ascii prefs routines.

 12. Added code to play a special mod when casting a spell if there is
     one in the Sounds/CastingMod/ dir.  Atm, the only spell with a
     CastingMod is Tribal Dance.

 13. Added code to play a special sound sample when casting a spell if
     there is one in the Sounds/CastingSounds/ dir.  Atm, the only
     spells with special casting sounds are Vox Celestes, Vox Angelica
     and Blonde.

 14. Added Artur's T Polski spell descriptions.

 15. Added SF's spell-corrected Magyar spell descriptions (A-Z)

 16. Added Artur's Q-S Polski spell descriptions.

 17. Added Combat sucking sound for Mind Flayer.

 18. Added FallingIntoPit.8svx for when you fall into a pit.

 19. Added SpecialCombatShocker.8svx for special combat attacks by
     creatures with MAX_COMABAT (Shocker)

 20. spot^up donated a really cool mod for use in the game!  I haven't
     added it into the game yet.

 21. CastingTwirl.8svx and CastingUndeadTwirl.8svx for use when casting
     creatures.  We still need to come up with a sound for inanimates.
     The sounds sound very cool!  But they don't really go well with the
     casting beam sound.  Any ideas what to do about this?

 22. REMOVED the code that auto-plays CastingSounds/spellname.  I think
     it will work better to have the spells specially programmed to
     play the sounds.

Improvements from 3.03 to 3.04
------------------------------

  1. EDITED Magic Carpet and Chainsaw graphics a bit.

  2. PROBLEM: I hate the animation of the Bolter.  So I just now
     changed it to something else.  It is now somewhat better than
     before, but still not very good.  Someone needs to fix this up.

  3. FD: A wizard just cast poison dagger on its own bolter.
     Considering that a bolter can never attack, this is kinda stupid.
     JC: NOW FIXED.

  4. FD: When dismounting, the "M" key shows a lot of places where I
     cannot move (I have wizard wings+speed but I can only move one
     square in this situation). JC: NOW FIXED.

  5. Aaaaaaugh!  Reveal was set to only be a ranking of 4!  This is why
     computer wizards never cast it on anyone!  I am now raising it to
     44 so that, basically, if they _can_ cast it on an enemy then they
     will.

  6. Sean and Frédéric both hate the green square for cloaked
     creatures. This same green square is also used to draw unexplored
     squares. Also FD has complained that the Cloak graphic is easily
     confused with the X-Ray graphic. So I have now drawn a new Cloak
     graphic which is used for 3 things: 1. As the graphic for the
     Cloak spell. 2. As the graphic for a cloaked creature. 3. As the
     graphic for an unexplored square. If you do not like this graphic
     then you are free to draw a better one and it will automagically
     appear in the game.

  7. CHANGED Earthquakes back to 15 combat and adjusted the
     DangerousnessRating() routine to ignore combat, ranged combat,
     etc. when rating an inanimate object. I did this so that a person
     could cast theoretically cast No Grow then Stone to Flesh on an
     Earthquake and have a powerful max combat creature. I realize this
     will hardly ever happen. But it only needs to happen once for it
     to be all worthwhile.

Improvements from 3.02 to 3.03
------------------------------

  1. BUG: M key shows that I can attack undeads when really I can't.
     NOW FIXED.

  2. FLAW: The scroll panel does not 100% handle spell descriptions
     that are not all on 1 line.  NOW FIXED.

  3. Added code WaitVBlank(2); to all the keypresses so that, for
     example, when you are holding down the "s" key to see where you
     can shoot, the flashing is more solid and pleasing to the eye.

  4. Ran FD's ReflowSpells.rexx script on the English spell
     descriptions.  It didn't flow them like I wanted.  It went well
     beyond the defined LineLength var.  So I changed the script a bit
     and now it flows EXACTLY like Cygnus Ed Professional does
     (Format/WithoutFill).

  5. Casting Brain Boost on a creature with max intelligence now raises
     its intelligence recovery by 1 point.

  6. REWROTE Double and Triple spell descriptions to say that you cannot
     double or triple any spell which grants multiple attempts.

  7. BUG: When 3 lines of text are displayed in the bottom text area of
     the main screen, lines 2 and 3 overlap each other a bit.  NOW
     FIXED.

  8. FD: I was asked a very strange question: "comrade nobody, would it
     be OK for you if I put this weak wall there next to your nothing
     ?" :-D ROFL !  JC: NOW FIXED.

  9. FD: The answer to the question that was accepted was "y" and not
     "o" as is supposed to be in french mode. NOW FIXED.

 10. CHANGED Wood Elf to require 5 kills to promote to Dread Elf. After
     extensive playtesting I have come to the conclusion that a Dread
     Elf is just to powerful to be allowed after only 4 kills. It
     should be changed to 5 or 6. Btw: it was _originally_ 5 kills when
     Sean first implemented it so I'm just setting it back like it was.

 11. FLAW?: Turning off algorythmic sounds does not affect the sound of
     the standard algorythmic "attack" sound.  NOW FIXED.

 12. Problem: Special combat attacks take too long when there are many
     special combat attackers on the board.  I made a new
     CellEffectList function and rewrote the SpecialCombatHandler so
     that all the special combat graphical effects of a particular
     creature happen simultaneously for up to 8x speed improvement.
     NOW FIXED.

 13. Robin and FD want your artifacts to go back to NOBODY when your
     wizard dies (instead of having them fall asleep).  NOW DONE.

 14. Problem: Computer-controlled flying creatures keep choosing to
     attack earthquakes when they should really be attacking the nearby
     enemy creatures.  This is because earthquakes are set to have 15
     combat for some reason.  I have now changed earthquakes to have 0
     combat.  Is this ok?  NOW FIXED.

 15. Added: FD's new EndTurnSelect.iff and QuestionMarkSelect.iff

 16. Edited / Antialiased QuestionMark.iff and QuestionMarkSelect.iff

 17. FD says Agents should be highlighted while casting spells.  I
     looked into this and there was already code to do this.  However
     they weren't highlighted until the instant that the spell was
     about to be cast.  I have now changed this so that the creature is
     highlighted immediately, before any text is printed to the screen.
     Thus the creature will now be highlighted for a longer period of
     time, without making anything take longer and without slowing the
     game down any.  Hopefully this will be good enough.  NOW DONE.

 18. ADDED Highlighting of real Generators because I like the Agent
     highlighting so much.

 19. Random Bug: Sometimes when the game loads Mod.ChaosTheme1, infinite
     enforcer hits are generated and all the fonts are destroyed.
     Assembled FD's new misca.asm for the music system to hopefully fix
     the above bug.

 20. UNBELIEVABLY STUPID!  All wizards are in an alliance against 99
     generators.  One of the computer wizards cast Coercion on turn 3!
     Now we are all going to get killed because of this!  NOW FIXED.

 21. FLAW: There is never an exophagy icon on my powerups list.  NOW
     FIXED.

 22. FLAW: The score column is not positioned well on the score screen.
     My score on turn 92 is 11602 thus placing it up against the Life
     value.  NOW FIXED.

 23. FLAW: Score screen score column is WAY out of position when
     playing in Deutsch or Polski.  NOW FIXED.

 24. BUG: Load any saved game and look at the score screen.  The life
     totals have not been freshly calculated so they are wrong.  NOW
     FIXED.

 25. FD: Uncertainty suffers from the same flow as vanish did before
     you fixed it. If there are many corpses, it will almost never
     generate anything. JC: I changed this so that it can now generate
     onto empty squares or onto dead bodies. NOW FIXED.

Improvements from 3.01 to 3.02
------------------------------

  1. FLAW: In Ruthlessness mode, flying creatures seem to take about 6x
     longer to move than in regular mode.  This is noticeable on my
     25Mhz 030 but perhaps not noticeable on faster machines.  NOW
     FIXED.

  2. FLAW: The "m" key can take up to 1/3 of a second.  The above fix
     now makes the "m" key around 10x as fast (in other words, back to
     being as fast as it was supposed to be).

  3. FLAW: Computer creatures in Ruthlessness mode take up to 6x longer
     to decide who to shoot.  NOW FIXED.

  4. FD: A (allied) computer wizard cast 3 pits around a generator in a
     corner.  He had 5 pits left to cast, and he could do so around a
     generator on a border, but he chose to cancel the spell. JC: He
     didn't actually cancel the spell. He cast the wall pieces into
     various parts of your computer's memory :) This triggered jillions
     of enforcer hits on my machine. This bug happened when a computer
     player tried to surround something that was on the edge of the
     map. ALL NOW FIXED.

  5. FD: When Virtue kills a bonus creature (white dragon, stone golem
     etc), no bonus spell is awarded. JC: NOW FIXED. Btw: There are
     only 3 bonus spell creatures that Virtue currently kills: White
     Dragon, Stone Golem and Air Elemental.

  6. FLAW: No points are awarded for killing creatures with Virtue.
     NOW FIXED.

  7. FD: An independent red dragon was engaged to one of my undead
     inanimages, but he was also adjacent to my dragon nest, which was
     the only object he could attack. However, he did not attack the
     dragon nest, he just shot it.  This makes me think he tried to
     attack the undead inanimage, which is stupid since the dragon is
     intelligent enough to see it's an undead. JC: This is a flaw that
     has always existed. NOW FIXED in both normal mode and Ruthlessness
     mode.

  8. FD: My wizard just vanished because of impurities ! First time I
     see this !  JC: Actually the line of code that allowed impurities
     to vanish things was commented out for some reason. I have just
     now reinstated it.

  9. FD: Actually, he was vanished by an independent chronomancer. JC:
     HOORAY for the Chronomancer!!!!! He actually did something useful!
     He vanished your most valuable asset! FD: The trouble is that 1)
     he has not reappeared for a very very long time. I guess this is
     because there are no empty cells on the board. They all have at
     least a corpse. 2) I don't have access to the menues to quit the
     game 3) What if the board was full of independents ?  The game
     would never end and I would never get the chance to select a menu
     ! I'm now on turn 148 and my wizard still hasn't reappeared. He was
     vanished around turn 80 ! I'm including the autosave. I think this
     is because the world is full of corpses. The vanished objects
     should be given a chance to reappear on a corpse after, say, 10
     turns, or in place of another (random) object that would be
     vanished in turn. JC: Ok I have investigated the WarpIn() code
     that controls the reappearance of warped creatures and yes, indeed
     your problem was caused by all those corpses. I tested the new
     code on FD's supplied savegame. NOW FIXED.

 10. FD: When a creature which has +4 scavenging and only 1 point to
     heal, it's still displaying life +4. JC: I have adjusted it to
     show the amount that it actually scavenges. Tested and works
     perfectly. NOW FIXED.

 11. BUG: Using the "m" key on an engaged creature sometimes produces
     somewhat wrong results.  NOW FIXED.

 12. RS: I tried the Brustroem's Browser spell. I used the spell and
     look into the different spell books. But when I wanted to choose a
     spell, the game did not let me choose from my list but from the
     list of player 2. I attached a savegame. JC: Ok the last time I
     fixed Burstroem's Browser I wrote the right code but I put it in
     the wrong place. This means that for the last 4 months the spell
     has been letting people CHEAT and cast spells from other people's
     spell lists! NOW FIXED.

 13. Added the 7 yes/no type strings to all the .catalog files.

 14. SAI: Speaking of the info panels I've recently decided it would be
     nice to be able to see the life of a creature by simply placing
     the mouse over it.  JC: How about at the bottom of the screen:
     Wizard 1 (Sean) Life 19 NOW DONE.

Improvements from 3.0 to 3.01
-----------------------------

  1. FD: I cast "stone to flesh" on one of my dark wood trees and moved
     it next to an independent ghast. However, it did not get engaged
     to the ghast and I could not attack it on the same turn. JC: I
     could not exactly duplicate this bug. When I moved my Dark Wood
     next to any enemy it got engaged, however when I clicked on the
     enemy to attack it, no sound was made and the graphical attack
     effect was not shown. The attack actually did happen though. The
     enemy lost the appropriate 2 hit points. This was caused by code
     that suppressed the attack sounds & gfx for the Dark Wood (so as
     not to get boring and annoying when its SpecialCombat attacks 8
     adjacent enemies). I tweaked the code to only suppress the combat
     sound and graphical effect when the Dark Wood is inanimate. NOW
     FIXED.

  2. INTEGRATED Frédéric's improved asm music routines into the game.
     The music system now resides in the dir AsmMusicSystem/ I didn't
     know what to do with the file proplayer.a so I just left it out.
     Everything seems to work ok but the subsong bug is still there.  I
     did a simple memory leak test and a simple mungwall hit test.
     Everything seems ok.  We can now allegedly play MMD2 songs from
     Octamed Sound Studio Professional from 1 to 64 channels.

  3. FLAW: When you select a spell from your list, the erased area is 1
     pixel to big.  NOW FIXED.

  4. ADDED part of the code to support PlayByEmail.

  5. When the mount of a wizard is killed, it leaves no corpse behind.
     Tested and works perfectly.  NOW FIXED.

  6. When a wizard dismounts something onto a scroll, the scroll is
     destroyed.  NOW FIXED.

  7. Above fix causes collapsing meditations to reappear once the
     wizard moves off of them.  NOW FIXED.

  8. FD: I had saved the preferences with Music off, but when I
     restarted the game, the music was switched back on. However, the
     menu "Music" was unchecked. When I selected it, another module was
     restarted, then I could switch the music off by reselecting the
     item. Seems you forgot to read this preference item before
     starting the music. NOW FIXED.

  9. FD: The left amiga key acts as "q". Actually, I guess every
     keypress of a qualifier triggers the very last action done on the
     keyboard. JC: This was caused by the fact that MapRawKey() maps
     qualifier keys as nothing. That is it doesn't even put a 0 into
     the buffer. So the buffer was left holding whatever key was
     pressed last. NOW FIXED.

 10. FIXED that rawkey problem on the 2nd creature info panel that
     prevented screen grabbing! (Pressing ANY key at all was clearing
     the screen).  NOW FIXED.

 11. STUPID: Computer wizards senselessly cast Dark Wood trees adjacent
     to themselves.  I have now implemented more advanced AI for use
     with this particular spell so this is NOW FIXED.

 12. Several new predicates to support the new AI.

 13. INTERLACE PROBLEM:  Sometimes AGA users complain that certain chaos
     screens are in interlace.  They want to make use of their AGA chips
     + their multisync monitors to produce a 100% solid flickerfree
     display.  So I have now added a new cli startup option -d to force
     chaos to open all its screens in doublepal mode.  I also added a
     new startup script and icon so chaos can easily be started in
     DoublePal mode from now on.  DoublePal modes are noninterlaced and
     flicker free.  NOW FIXED.

 14. ADDED Polski, Norsk, Svenska and Finnish to the language menu.

 15. September 27th, 2000: I got a finished polski.catalog from Artur.

 16. ADDED new code to make the top half of the 2nd creature info panel
     fully stringwidth sensitive. (I had already done this with the
     bottom half).  This allows the Polski translations to fit without
     overlapping. DONE.

 17. ADDED new code to make the text on the score screens fully
     stringwidth sensitive.  This allows the polski translations to fit
     without overlapping.  The numeric columns are unchanged.  Seems to
     work ok.

 18. Implement translated menus. The Intuition menus are now fully
     international and automatically adjust to the length of the
     strings in the menus. ALL DONE

 19. Added code to center the translated strings of the demo over
     screen. DONE.

 20. Fixed spell descriptions for Hydra, Flood Shield, Marid and
     Protection.

 21. Installed the new HUPL versions of all the fonts.  These are the
     standard gamefonts modified by Attila the Hun to have all
     Hungarian chars in the proper places and then modified by
     Frédéric Delacroix to contain all Polish chars in the proper
     places.  I then had Sau test the ChaosPearlHUPL font on his Amiga
     in Hungary using a Hungarian keymap and he reports all chars are
     there and everything is ok.

 22. New function to support the new AI: FirstAdjacentHumanAlly()

 23. FLAW: Deutsch.catalog on 2nd scroll info panel goes off the right
     edge of the screen.  Everything was working great with the
     English, Français and Polski catalogs But when I got the
     Deutsch.catalog it was going off the right-hand edge of the 2nd
     scroll info panel.  I have now changed that panel so that the left
     column is right against the left edge and the right column is
     right against the right edge.

 24. Goblin Bomb now picks up bows just like a regular Goblin.

 25. Changed/fixed Goblin Bomb SCROLLS to no longer explode when shot.
     October 11, 2000

 26. Also fixed it so that: Shooting a scroll of an Earthquake,
     Generator, Stone Golem or Stone Giant no longer shakes the screen.
     Shooting a scroll of a Hidden Horror no longer causes a Red Dragon
     to appear. Shooting a scroll of an Elemental no longer causes it
     to become its Elemental Form (water, fire, tempest, earthquake)

 27. New Ruthlessness mode. When Ruthlessness mode is activated
     computer players will: 1. Cast pits, magic glass, walls, rocks and
     miner willy more intelligently and aggressively.  2. If they are
     an arborist they will cast shadow wood and dark wood trees in a
     more aggressive and intelligent manner.  3. Whenever a creature is
     engaged it will always attack the strongest creature that it can
     acutally kill.  If it cannot make a kill then it will attack
     whichever enemy it feels is the most dangerous.  4. A shooting
     creature will always attempt to shoot the strongest creature that
     it can actually kill.  If it cannot make a kill then it will shoot
     whatever enemy it feels is the most dangerous.  They never try to
     shoot a wizard who is inulnerable or has a reflector.  5. A
     nonengaged ground creature will always check first if there is a
     path to any enemy wizard that it can kill.  If it cannot kill any
     enemy wizard then it will check if there is a path to any
     favorite-food creature that it can kill.  If it cannot kill its
     favorite food then it will check if there is a path to any
     bonus-spell creature that it can kill.

 28. Implemented new AI code for ruthlessness mode. Now ruthless
     computer players will cast pits, magic glass, walls, rocks, miner
     willy, shadow wood and dark wood trees in a much more intelligent
     and aggressive manner. This took 600+ lines of code and quite a
     lot of time. It added 7k+ to the size of the executable.

 29. Implemented new AI code for ruthlessness mode. Now computer
     shooters shoot the strongest thing that they can kill.  If there
     is a tie then they shoot the most dangerous opponent.  Wizards
     will not shoot and kill a creature protected by Eye for an Eye.

 30. Implemented new AI code for ruthlessness mode.  Now engaged
     computer creatures attack the strongest thing they can kill.  If
     there is a tie then they attack the most dangerous opponent.
     Wizards will not attack and kill a creature protected by Eye for
     an Eye.

 31. Implemented new AI code for ruthlessness mode: flying nonengaged
     creatures attack the strongest thing they can kill.  If they can't
     kill anything then they attack the most dangerous thing they can
     hit.  If there is nothing they can hit from their current position
     then they fall back to the old movement routine.

 32. Implement ground-based nonengaged creatures seek a good kill.
     (wizard, favorite food or bonus spell creature). If they can't do
     any of those things then they just fall back to the old movement
     routine. I had to make some adjustments and things to make
     everything work within the realm of Chaos. But now that it is
     done, IT IS TOTALLY AWESOME! I built some complicated mazes and
     then pressed the "m" key and it correctly showed all the places I
     could and could not move to! I kept randomly deleting pieces of
     walls and putting new walls elsewhere in an attempt to confuse it
     but it worked every time! WAY COOL! This algorythm only finds
     clear paths to every square on the board. This algorythm does not
     currently try to calculate any sort of "hack your way through
     these certain barriers to reach your goal" type of stuff. This
     algorythm takes into account the fact that once you are engaged
     you can attack any adjacent square, even if you only have .1
     movement points left.

 33. BUG: There has always been a bug in the game whereby if you move
     some squares and then have only .5 to .9 movement points left it
     lets you move another full square! This is cheating! It takes 1
     whole movement point to move in a straight line and 1.4142
     movement points to move diagonally! I have now changed the
     inappropriate occurrences of "0.5" in move.c and cmove.c to say
     "1.0" now. However, you can still cheat and step diagonally on
     your last move when you only have 1 movement point left. SORT OF
     FIXED.  I will work out a way to fix this last flaw later. Later:
     ok the movement system now works exactly the way it should. This
     is all 100% NOW FIXED.

 34. BUG: The computer movement routine deducts 2 movement points for
     each diagonal move instead of the correct 1.4142!  This applies to
     computer creatures AND computer wizards!  NOW FIXED.

 35. BUG: The WRONG movement point value is shown all the time.  It was
     taking the actual movement points left and rounding them DOWN to
     the nearest lower integer. NOW FIXED.

 36. Added code so that nonengaged exposed wizards will run into an
     unoccupied meditation if possible.

 37. Modified "m" key to work, even in the middle of a creature's
     movement! I've been wanting this feature for years! I finally did
     it! And now that I've fixed all those 10 year old bugs in the move
     routines the m-key highlighted squares now agree perfectly with
     the printed numerical value at the bottom of the screen and with
     how far you @{i}actually@{ui} get to move your unit.

 38. FIXED FindAllPaths() to handle mounts + level 2 mounts when the
     SourceCell contains an exposed wizard. (It already handled
     meditations).  DONE.

 39. FIXED "m" key ground movement to handle mounts and level2 mounts +
     ride.

 40. FIXED "m" key flying movement!  Just use the old code. DONE.

 41. FIXED "m" key flying movement to take into account
     "WillIGetEngagedIfIMoveThere".  This way cells which you cannot
     directly fly to, but you can fly next to them, become engaged and
     then attack them will now be correctly highlighted.

 42. Robin Schmidt writes: The Pyrohydra has combat 15 and ranged
     combat 5. But the discription tells me that the breath fire of the
     pyrohydra is one of the strongest. I suppose you swaped the
     numbers? JC: Wow! What a cool bug you found! I swapped the numbers
     back around. NOW FIXED.

 43. RS: 1. When questioning a cloaked object, the German text is too
     long. We need a line feed + carriage return 8-) JC: It took me 90
     minutes to hack and slash an AntiAliasWriteTextLength() function
     together for this purpose. NOW FIXED.

 44. Improved Team/Alliances and ending the game.

 45. BUG: Team[] gets saved and loaded with the savegame file but not
     TeamSettings[]!  I have now fixed this, this means the savegame
     format has changed again.  I am deleting all my old saved games
     and I am converting all the levels to the new format. NOW FIXED.

 46. RS: 2. The Nightmare has a combar value of 1? I think it should be
     higher, for 'it's feet are burning hot' or something like that. I
     just deleted the sentence "They attack with their hooves which are
     burning hot." from the spell description so this is NOW FIXED. Of
     course now I will have to convince all the translators around the
     world to upgrade to the new spell description... 8/

 47. CHANGED spell descriptions of: Bat, Nightmare, Virtue.  Sent them
     to FD and SF.  Included new FD French versions.

 48. ADDED code to keep track of total time spent playing chaos and
     total number of turns played.  Now I just have to decide where I
     will display this information.

 49. INCREASED the code to keep track of total time spent playing chaos
     to keep seperate totals for each of the 8 players + the
     independents.

 50. Added code to switch to the HUPL font when selecting Hungarian or
     Polish from the Language menu.

 51. The toe of the Babboon is all messed up. NOW FIXED. + I drew some
     blood on the dead body.

 52. Pieces of the Skeleton animation were not antialiased.  NOW FIXED.

 53. Amphisbaena is all messed up! NOW FIXED.

 54. RS: Yesterday (or tomorrow, don't know) I got the Touch Of GOD
     (nice one 8-)! So I made my Wood Elf a godlike creature. A when it
     moved around killing here killig there killing everywhere it
     suddenly was promoted to a Dread Elf (ooohh, how dreadful)! But
     then I saw that his life force was decreased, and so were Magical
     Resistance and healing capabilities! That's no good, my dear. And
     I presume this 'feature' can be used with any promotable creature
     that is under the Armour and Protection spells. No other values
     were changed though, so my dread elf was still of much use to me...
     JC: Ok I read over the code that controls this and I see no
     possible way this could happen.  All the stats are promoted the
     same way so they should either all promote correctly or none of
     them should promote correctly.  So I played a test game and cast
     Touch of God onto my Wood Elf.  On the 4th kill he was promoted to
     a Dread Elf.  The only thing wrong with him was that his
     manuverability didn't promote right (I forgot to promote that stat
     in the code).  So the Manuverability stat promotion is NOW FIXED.

 55. FD: I saw once (I think it was when a wizard had just been killed)
     a string like "Movement points= -98.50). I can't remember the
     exact circumstance unfortunately. JC: I looked over the code and I
     only saw 1 place where this could be theoretically possible so I
     rewrote that piece of code. ALLEGEDLY NOW FIXED.

 56. FD: Something has changed about shadow wood. It seems to me that
     they don't attack anymore when computer-controlled. JC: NOW FIXED.

 57. FD: I cast alter reality on a wizard's mount and it was turned
     into a goblin bomb. However, the goblin bomb did not explode when
     I killed it. It should explode, but should the riding wizard be
     harmed too ? I think so but ? JC: That's hilarious! You come up
     with the weirdest stuff! :) With clever rewriting of the
     Reinstate() function I was able to make mounted Goblin Bombs
     explode as usual. NOW FIXED. Goblin Bombs have never harmed the
     cell that they are in. I have now hacked in some extra code so
     that they now damage a mounted wizard. Same thing for the Volcano.
     NOW FIXED.

 58. FD: I vanished a horse into the future, and it reappeared some
     turns later in the rightmost column. But the drawn area was 1
     pixel too wide, damaging the spell selection graphics. This was
     refreshed very quickly though. Actually, this seems to happen
     everytime something is drawn in the last column.  JC: I think it
     only happens during the CellEffects TELEPORTIN and TELEPORTOUT.
     NOW FIXED.

 59. FD: When a creature gets promoted, its manoeuvrability recovery is
     reset, not kept. JC: NOW FIXED.

 60. FD: A sleeping ghoul is still animated and scavenging. I can't
     remember exactly how it happened, but this could be due to
     impurities. JC: NOW FIXED.

 61. FD: If a computer wizard has a solar, then the solar does not
     move. JC: NOW FIXED.

 62. FD: It would be nice, in the bonus panel, if the number of spells
     to pick was decreased each time I pick a spell. JC: NOW DONE.

 63. FD: During spell selection, when I press "c", it shows me where I
     can cast the spell under the mouse pointer. But then I must click
     elsewhere to be able to press "c" again on another spell. It would
     be nice if we could press "c" on different spells without having
     to click in between. JC: This is a problem with _all_ keypresses,
     not just the "c" key. Originally I programmed all keypresses to
     work exactly the way you describe. Then one day Sean changed it. I
     didn't like it but I assumed he had a good reason for it so I
     decided not to mess with it until someone complained about it.
     NOW FIXED.

 64. Included Stephen's Magyar spell descriptions A-Z.  They still need
     to be spell-checked.

 65. A: It seems that there is something wrong with support for HUPL
     fonts - I checked them in DPaint and all polish chars are OK and
     in proper "places".  But Chaos doesn't seem to use them - only
     script font (ChaosHUPL) seems to be used when proper option is
     enabled. All other fonts (ChaosCalligraphy & ChaosPearl) seems to
     be used in original versions - not their HUPL equivalents. :/ JC:
     The problem was that I closed the old fonts and opened all the new
     ones correctly but that is not enough. The fonts must be plugged
     into every rastport and screen in the game. NOW FIXED.

Future additions
================

   We can only work on Chaos in our spare time but are always pleased
to hear suggestions for improvements from people who play the game.

   Here is a list of features that may be added in the future:

   @{b}*@{ub} More spells (send me your favourite ideas, and pictures of wanted
     creatures).

   @{b}*@{ub} Improved sound and sampled speech.

   @{b}*@{ub} More flexibility in game options, such as allowing players to buy
     spells, and so on.

   @{b}*@{ub} Level editor.

Known bugs
==========

   Chaos has been extensively tested with @{b}Enforcer@{ub}, @{b}MuForce@{ub}, @{b}Mungwall@{ub}
and @{b}MuGuardianAngel@{ub} and in our experience does nothing nasty. However,
crashes may happen, if they do it is most helpful to me if you can note
carefully what was happening when the crash occurred.  There are a few
less serious bugs within the game which may be fixed in the future.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Reinstatement Bug@{ui}: When Dark Power, Vengeance, Decree, or
     Justice succeeds in killing a creature upon a corpse, the creature
     is killed but the corpse is brought back to life. This "bug" is
     deliberately incorporated in the program. Advanced players will
     exploit this fact in the obvious way.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Cat Lord@{ui}: Theoretically there should only ever be one Cat Lord.
     However, it possible to create more than one by a variety of
     methods:

       a. using Alter Reality,

       b. using Mutate,

       c. by waking a sleeping one,

       d. by raising a dead one,

       e. using Request.

     Multiple Cat Lords will not cause the game to crash but may result
     in cats changing sides several times, moving multiple times, and
     other undocumented effects. We leave it to you to explore the
     possibilities.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Classic Bugs@{ui}: The classic mode is not perfect and it is
     possible that spells not normally available will occur. Known
     cases are the faun casting sleep. The thundermare and iridium
     powerups are still possible. If generators are used then the
     bipedal generator will still generate creatures not normally
     available in classic mode.

Miscellaneous
-------------

   James Conwell has had the following utilities installed on his
Amigas for years and has used them every day and they work great and he
recommends them to everyone: CPUblit 1.0, Arq 1.78 (Animated
Requesters), FastExec (Loads Exec.library to fastram instead of
chipram; speeds up multitasking and interrupts, etc.) and PoolMem, the
most useful utility ever: It greatly reduces memory fragmentation in
your system, thus increasing speed and reliabilty.

Technical features
==================

   This game was coded in a mixture of JC and Assembly code. We use JC
for the main game and super high speed optimized assembly code for
certain time-critical things like the music and the ray tracing and
certain math operations and certain graphics operations.

   Version 2.3 contains 313 spells. Version 3.0 contains 349 spells.

   If you have an 020 or higher processor then this game features 50 fps
animation in the quadrascopes and quadspectrograms. If you only have a 7
Mhz 68000 then you will only get about 25 fps.

   The sprite that highlights the current creature only runs at 25 fps
no matter how fast your computer is. We did this on purpose because
when it moves faster than 25 fps it becomes unpleasing to the eye.

   If you have an 020 or higher processor then the color cycling on the
QUIT and NEW GAME requesters moves at 50 fps. If you only have a 7 Mhz
68000 then it is only about 25 fps.

   The vector graphic pentagrams on the ABOUT requester rotate at 50
fps on all Amigas.

   The intro music utilizes 4 simultaneous channels of audio, each one
at up to 28,000 samples per second.

   The introductory credits are displayed in 640x512 resolution with 8
colors and smooth full-screen scrolling.

   This game utilizes ray-tracing. When calculating line of sight to a
target a beam of light is traced from the source to the target. If the
beam gets through then you have line of sight. If the beam is blocked
then you do not have line of sight.

   Ray Tracing is an inherently slow process so if you only have a 7
Mhz 68000 you will notice a delay of up to .5 seconds when you push the
"l" key to see all the cells on the board that you have line of sight
to while the computer ray-traces all the possiblities. If this is too
slow for you then please upgrade to a 25 Mhz 030 and then you'll be
happy 8)

   This game was programmed to be 100% OS friendly and Multitasking
friendly, however it will not work on graphics cards because

  1. Most graphics cards are lame and don't have sprites.

  2. Picasso96 and CyberGrafix drivers simply don't support many
     standard Amiga OS functions.  Examples are ChangeSprite(),
     MoveScreen() with attached screens.  OpenScreen() with attached
     screens etc.

  3. This game contains certain high speed routines that write directly
     to your display memory in order to go 10x faster than using slow
     OS calls. This is totally legal and system friendly; it just isn't
     compatible with add-on graphics cards, so if you have a graphics
     card you'll need to play the game on your regular built-in chipset
     instead of the graphics card.  I can very easily change this item
     but it still won't run on a gfx card due to the lameness of P96
     and Cybergfx mentioned above.

  4. Neither of the authors owns a graphics card.

   This game can be played on Amigas which are equipped with graphics
cards however no benefit will be derived from the presence of a
graphics card. It didn't make sense for us to make graphics that go 10x
slower for regular Amiga owners just so that those with graphics cards
could go a bit faster.  Neither of the programmers of this game own a
graphics card. If you want us to make a new "graphics-card-aware"
version of the game then you'll have to buy us a graphics card to work
with.  It would also help if you explained how to get around the lack
of OS support for P96 and CyberGfx (especially the sprite problems).
It would also help if you redrew all the gfx in 24-bit color using
32x32 or 64x64 sized tiles.

   Version 2.3 utilizes a main gameboard resolution of 320x256 pixels
with 32 colors. The text area at the bottom of the main screen is
displayed in 640x256 resolution with 8 colors. The information panels
are also displayed with 640x256 resolution in 8 colors.

   Version 2.8 utilizes Information Panels, Scroll Panels and Score
Screens of 640x512 pixels in 16 colors on both ECS and AGA Amigas. And
a specially designed Calligraphy font is used with anti-aliasing and
anti-flickering to make it appear extremely smooth looking on
interlaced screens.

   Version 3.0 utilizes a main gameboard resolution of 320x256 pixels
with 64 colors.  It contains 904 64-color tiles.

   The documentation was written using the Texinfo system to produce
both online and printed documentation. A translator package is
available from fdelacroix@nordnet.fr.

   Bill Gates does not profit in any way from the sale or use of this
game.

=====

   A variation on the unicorn having a somewhat enlarged horn which it

Abduction
=========

   Like subversion, abduction is an attempt to convince an enemy
creature that its interests may better lie with allegiance to your
wizard.  Intelligent creatures are more likely to see through this ruse
than stupid creatures.  However, as abduction applies to a random
creature you cannot know beforehand the intelligence of the recipient.
Further, because the targeting of this spell is so imprecise it is
possible that it will be applied to one of your own creations.
Therefore, the spell is most beneficial when you have relatively few
creations.

   Line of sight is not required and your chosen target can be anywhere
on the board.  This spell will not attempt to target Artifacts,
Scrolls, Wizards or corpses.  If successful, the target will
immediately come under control of your wizard and no longer respond to
the commands of its previous lord.

Acid Rain
=========

   Causes a global rain storm with droplets of extreme acidity.  The
rain drops are a mixture of water, sulphuric acid, formic acid, nitric
acid, phosphoric acid, carbonic acid, and surprisingly citric acid.
The droplets also contain hydrazine and various other flammable
compounds.  Because of these flammable compounds acid rain will not put
out fires.  Further, acid rain does not harm creatures in general
although during the rain it may be painful to them.

   However, trees are extremely vulnerable to this type of rain.  Even
the hardy magic wood cannot stand acid rain.

Falcon
======

   Falcons are very swift and can cross the longer axis of the visible

is most useful for mounting long range aerial assaults and its

cannot heal themselves.

Fire
====

   Fire is very dangerous once conjured.  A fire continues to grow
until the conjurer is killed or until it is put out by other means.
Fires can burn any creature, living or undead or dead, or any wizard
not possessing a fire shield.  Fires even burn the creatures of the
conjurer and can even burn the conjurer.

   Fires can also burn down castles, citadels and even walls, although
this usually takes considerable time. The destructive ability of a fire
exceeds that of any creature including dragons and vampires. Fire can
be put out by active effort of creatures, each cell of fire has a
energy comparable to that of a faun or troll.

Although the gooey blob has no intelligence it will never harm its
master or any of its master's creatures.

   However, the gooey blob quickly grows over enemy creatures
preventing them from moving but not actually killing them. Buried
creatures can be recovered by killing the gooey blob on them.

   Rescued creatures will have half their initial life remaining after
being uncovered no matter how much they had when they were buried, so

Kill
====

   An extremely potent spell only available by meditation.  The chosen
target, living or undead, will instantly drop dead.  The spell simply

King Cobra
==========

   The king cobra has very little to recommend for it, aside from the
fact that its poisonous bite causes permanent damage to any victim
stupid enough to get close to it.

   Every creature is capable of killing a king cobra, even creatures as
low as bats, dire wolves, vultures, fauns, elves, and pegasii can kill
a king cobra in a single blow. The king cobra is also stupid, has
minimal magical resistance, and is sluggish. Assuming the cobra
survives an attack, it has a good chance of escaping the conflict.

===============

   The platinum dragon is the king of the good dragons.  A summons can

Points
======

   When competing for honour against other wizards it is desirable that
your final score reflects your ability.  This simple spell awards your
wizard 100 points in reflection of his greatness.  Unfortunately, the
spell does nothing to assist your fate in the world.

   The spell is best cast when you are stuck in a corner with no room

Poison Dagger
=============

   A spell which causes the chosen target to stop attacking life force
and turn to more sinister means of accomplishing the same task.  The
chosen target will instead infect during combat.  The infection is very
strong and will quickly mitigate the recovery rate of strong creatures
leading swiftly to death.

   For humanoid races this spell gives the combatant an infected
dagger, for other creatures appropriate action is taken, ranging from
poisonous fangs to astral viruses. The dagger does 5 points of damage.

carnivorous dinosaurs.  Despite its size this animal is surprisingly
swift and is a good match for any dragon.  It can kill many creatures
with a single bite.  It is capable of killing a lion, pegasus, bear, or
bird lord within two turns.

   The Tyrannosaurus is a perpetually hungry hunter/scavenger and will
quickly devour any corpses it can find.  Tyrannosaurus is best attacked
with magic.

Teleport
========

   When a strong creature is attacking your wizard or when your wizard

Tempest
=======

   A tempest is an air elemental which moves at its own volition.
Inanimate objects are not affected by a tempest.  Any creature falling
into a tempest will be propelled to a new random location (which is
sometimes desirable, but usually best avoided).

   There is a small chance that the transported creature will not

Thundermare
===========

   A rare enchantment over the standard horse.  This creature is very
rarely available as a free spell, instead most often occurring when a
wizard riding a horse successfully kills another creature with the
horse.

   The thundermare has numerous advantages over the standard horse,
although its base strength is only slightly higher than the normal
horse. Its biggest asset is its advanced combat training. The
thundermare is capable of lashing out with all hooves simultaneously
and still land back on them afterwards. The thundermare represents an
ideal safe haven for the wizard.  It has extreme magic resistance and
will probably only be killed in direct combat, if at all.

Torment
=======

   This spell allows your wizard to influence the strength of creature
casts made by all the other wizards.  When another wizard casts a
creature its life force will be only 4 points, making it easy to kill.

   If you are lucky the effect will hold for several creature casts of
each wizard, but more likely it will work once for each wizard. It has
no effect on independents or generated creatures.

Tower
=====

   The mystical powers of the Magic Tower allow it to absorb the
essence of any creature who enters it.

   The Tower starts out very short but as it becomes more powerful it
grows in size.  Any creature entering a tower adds all of its primary
statistcs to the statistics of the Tower.  Once a creature enters a
tower it can never leave because its essence becomes one with the tower
in a permanent and unbreakable bond.

   Wizards cannot enter towers.

======

   This is a highly sought after spell which gives the wizard the

Troll
=====

   The troll has an uncanny ability for being able to heal its wounds

   Turmoil affects every square in the world.  Every cell is randomly

spell is only available through meditation and is very rare.

=====

   Are you tired of expending a large amount of energy struggling in
what seems to be a never ending battle?  This spell could be the
answer.  If the number of turns remaining exceeds 10 then this spell
will give everyone a major hurry up by cutting the number of remaining
turns to just 10.

   However, the spell is bipolar and if the number of turns remaining
is less than 10 then an additional 10 turns will be granted.

   The Ubiquiscope is equivalent to a Crystal Ball + a Magic Wand
combined.  A highly desirable spell which removes the need for your
wizard to have line of sight in order to cast a spell.

   With the Ubiquiscope, your wizard can "see" everywhere. Range
