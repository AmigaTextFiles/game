Improvements from 1.5 to 1.6
----------------------------

  1. Enhanced Pronuciation of Speech.

  2. Made numerous enhancements to program documentation.

  3. Made numerous enhancements to the User Manual.

  4. Added a new bit to CastInfo[] called CAST_LOS. This bit determines
     if a spell needs Line Of Sight or not. This solves the problem of
     casting creatures diagonally next to a generator or other large
     square object. It also allows the creation of spells that, for
     instance, have a range 3 but DON'T require line of sight. Cool!

  5. Vengeance and Exorcise used to do the @{i}exact@{ui} same thing. So I was
     going to change Exorcise to only be able to be cast on Undeads and
     bump the strength up to 7 to make up for this but there is no
     CAST_UNDEAD or CAST_UNDEAD_ONLY bit so I just raised the strength
     of Exorcise to 4. I just don't see the point in having 2 spells
     which do the exact same thing.

  6. Dark Power and Justice used to do the exact same thing. Now I have
     changed Justice to be 2 sets of 3-point attacks instead of 3 sets
     of 2-point attacks to add some variety. Thus Justice is now a bit
     less useful but Exorcise is a bit more useful so hopefully the
     play-balance is roughly the same as it was.

  7. Magic Bow is now cumulative. Since magic bows are so rare (I've
     never had 2 of them in Chaos 1.5), I have set it to bump up the
     range by 1 on additional bows. That should be a pleasant surprise
     to anyone if they ever have 2 of them!

  8. Destroy Wall now destroys PowerWalls also.

  9. Show numbers beside bar graphs.

 10. I fixed the deal where Independent Undeads never bothered to shoot.

 11. Show LOS required on Spell Info screen.

 12. James "The Optimizer" Strikes Again! Many speed and memory
     optimizations.

 13. 20 new spells!!!.

 14. CAST_UNDEAD_FLAG

 15. Fixed a bug that sometimes causes a crash. (obtain/release
     semaphore)

Improvements from 1.6 to 1.7
----------------------------

  1. Resurrect and RessurrectID -> MassResurrect

  2. Cloaked creatures now block enemy's LOS but not friendly's LOS.

  3. Fixed life 0. Creatures didn't die when they reached 0 life. Now
     they do.

  4. Fixed Load last name from savefile.

  5. Added lots of new stats in and set them appropriately for each
     creature.

  6. Movement points as float rather than integer.

  7. Modified end-of-turn healing to heal all appropriate stats.

  8. Modified existing combat routine to take into account negative
     combat. We can now make creatures whose attacks heal instead of
     hurt.

  9. Modified existing combat routine to take into account affecting
     different/multiple stats other than life. Now we can make
     creatures that attack any stat or combination of stats. Such as
     intelligence or magic resistance etc.

 10. Added 1 new paragraph to the docs.

 11. Roper, Wasp Nest, Pool, Volcano, Apple Tree are now ordinary items
     which have SpecialCombat.

 12. Modified RangedCombat routine to take into account CR_LOS. Now we
     can make creatures which have distance weapons that don't require
     line of sight.

 13. Added new predicates: AttacksLiving, AttacksUndead, isUndead

 14. Modified maiming routine to not maim on negative combat.

 15. We can now have creatures that gain or lose flying ability.

 16. Lich and Lich Lord and Raise Dead have been modified appropriately.

 17. There was a bug with Magic Sword and Magic Knife: If the wizard
     already had MAX_COMBAT and then cast Magic Sword or Magic Knife
     then he did NOT gain the abiltiy to attack undeads because the
     sword/knife did not get applied.  This is now fixed. The routine
     is now much shorter also.

 18. We can now make creatures which cannot attack living creatures,
     only undeads.

 19. We can now make creatures whose specialcombat affects very
     specific groups of creatures and any combination of stats.

 20. Info Screen graphing is now even better!

 21. ShadowForm, .Shadow, ShadowFormID -> Irvine's_Invulnerability

 22. Heal and HealID -> Restoration.

 23. Info screen has now been revamped to show all the new stats in a
     graphical manner.

Improvements from 1.7 to 1.7.2
------------------------------

  1. Sleeping Creatures now stop being animated so you can see that
     they are asleep.

  2. Weird bug with simulacrumming a wizard. I was controlling 2
     different wizards who were not in an alliance with each other. I
     had Double in effect. I double simulacrummed the other wizard. I
     simulacrummed the original and then I simulacrummed the copy. I
     hopped one of the wizards on a unicorn and it just disappeared. It
     wasn't there and it couldn't dismount. Ever. The unicorn was still
     there but not the wizard.

  3. Modified the following creatures to take advantage of the new
     combat system: Cobra is now poisonous, Halfling is now @{i}very@{ui} magic
     resistant, Mind Flayer now really attacks intelligence.

  4. Creature Recovery now handles negative recovery rates (Poison),
     though it won't actually kill you yet.

  5. Fixed description of Justice spell.

  6. Numeric keys show player's creatures in RED1 if they have moved
     and in WHITE if they haven't moved.

  7. Fixed Lich spell description.

  8. Pool is now a regular spell. In my opinion it is hard enough to
     use due to Eagles and things that fly up at it and also because it
     adds the "Repair your forces" play mechanic to the game.

Improvements from 1.7.2 to 1.7.3
--------------------------------

  1. Made 2nd info screen to show all stats such as CR_LOS,
     Attacks_Undead, Favorite Food, Afraid of, etc. This is something
     that I've been wanting for a very long time! Now I can see
     EVERYTHING about a creature.

  2. Made 2nd SpellInfo screen with all casting attributes. This is
     something that I have @{i}REALLY@{ui} been wanting for a long time! I am
     always casting a spell and then I find out that I can't cast it
     where I want to so I have to abort it! I have 3 times tried to
     cast armour on a Violet Fungi during an important game and it
     wouldn't let me.

  3. Give the archers actual archery skill. Reduce their range to keep
     the same play balance as before.

  4. Give the archers 1 point of Magic Resistance recovery since their
     description says they have a pure heart and have high magic
     resistance

  5. Removed archery skill from inanimates and growths.

  6. Earthquake movescreen effect: Horziontal_Shake, Vertical_Shake,
     Diagonal_Shake.

  7. Changed Move.tex so that elementals, generators, Stone Giants and
     StoneGolems and EarthQuakes shake the screen when they die.

  8. When an EarthQuake grows, the screen shakes.

  9. Show Powerups like combat, recoverboost and speed on info screen.
     I've been wanting this feature for a long time! I am always having
     3 creatures that look alike EXCEPT for that 1 of them has Combat.
     And then I have to click on each 1 of them and look down at the
     combat stat to find which one it is.  Now the little Combat symbol
     is up there as a powerup so it is easier to spot. Looks cool too.

 10. Eliminated Plastic looking borders on info screens. Now looks more
     slick!

 11. CR_LOS is now more sensibly known as Archery in the program.

 12. Some sort of bug with scrolling credits. After 20 minutes or so
     the machine locks up.

Improvements from 1.7.3 to 1.7.4
--------------------------------

  1. "fixed" LichLord, Simulacrum, Replicate, Vortex.

  2. Show allies on number keys. + change the docs.

  3. Allegedly fixed it so a wizard in a castle or tree can attack
     enemies.

  4. Joe made me put in numeric keypad support.

  5. put in new stat in cast.tex called CAST_GROWTH because the
     computer just cast 6 raise deads on 6 different orange jellies.

  6. Things like walls and pits can now be cast ON growths.

Improvements from 1.7.4 to 1.7.5
--------------------------------

  1. Fixed that annoying empty dead cell bug.

  2. Fixed Tempests so they don't distort space.

  3. Sometimes the Bonus Spell window ONLY displays Hide spells. Once
     this starts it never seems to stop; every bonus spell for the rest
     of the game is displayed as a Hide spell.

  4. New method of showing what stats are attacked by combat.

  5. Optimize the highlight routine.

  6. Purple combat conflicted with pink recovery so I changed Combat to
     BROWN.

  7. Growth rates were incredibly high so I doubled GCEILING to slow
     them down some.

  8. Fixed the DarkWood so they now attack and while I was at it I
     changed their abilities and description a bit.

  9. RMB now cancels info screens properly.

 10. Shortened ScreenShakes.

 11. Fixed Touch of God to set CombatApply Combat and Ranged Combat for
     Life.

 12. Now Info screen shows BrainBoost, MagicShield and Armour powerups.

 13. Team Icon now displayed on Score Screen and TeamScore screen.

 14. Collapsing meditations now give at least 2 spells to pick from.

 15. Team scores are now displayed but they are not sorted correctly.

 16. Pick your bonus spell even if it is only 1. This way you @{i}know@{ui} that
     you got a bonus spell and you know exactly what you got as a bonus
     spell.

 17. The old sound system hogs 2 audio channels. As a quick fix I just
     commented out the code for 1 of the channels so now it only
     uses/hogs 1 channel.

Improvements from 1.7.5 to 1.8
------------------------------

  1. July 1997: Made a teensy weensy correction to the docs.

  2. Outlined some further ideas on gameplay in English.

  3. Added the following color effects to cell.tex. The FadeTo___Scale
     routines fade the foreground only. The background stays black.
     FadeToGreyScale (Fade the whole screen to a b&w photograph),
     FadeToRedScale, FadeToGreenScale, FadeToBlueScale,
     FadeToCyanScale, FadeToYellowScale, FadeToMagentaScale,
     FadeToColor (Fade the whole screen, including the background, to a
     SOLID color), LowLevelFade (fades to any colorscale).

  4. Added animated sprite to highlight the creature whose turn it is.
     Utilizes 50 fps animation so it really catches your eye. I drew a
     simple little 4-frame animated sprited for this purpose. Hmmm...
     50 fps is actually TOO fast (at least for this particular sprite)
     so I slowed it down to 25 fps.

  5. Successfully linked an asm routine to the C main program and shared
     variables between C and asm. Gee, it only took me 20 hours of
     mortal combat with the Slinker to achieve this... I eventually
     just set data=far for EVERY module to get it to work right. I'll
     fix it to use near data later.

  6. Many small fixes to TeXnotes.

  7. Static and empty cells are NO LONGER REDRAWN by the animator. If
     it isn't animated then the animator doesn't need to draw it. So on
     average this doubles the speed of the animator. In the WORST case
     it will go the same speed as it used to go. In the BEST case it
     goes about 238x faster! On average it should cruise 2x as fast as
     before.

  8. Doubled the speed of the BoardEffect C code.

  9. Retargetable graphics upgrade: Retargetable graphics are needed so
     the game can inherently work with 16x16 or 32x32 or 32x16 or 16x32
     or even 64x64 cells.

 10. I talked to an Amiga guy about his favorite strategy games. (He
     had no idea that I was co-coder of Chaos) He mentioned Chaos as
     one of his favorite strategy games. I asked him lots of questions
     about Chaos like what are its good points and what are its bad
     points and what kind of game is it? And stuff like that. He said a
     lot of interesting things. One of his main complaints was that the
     computer moved to slowly. Well, I had just been waiting for a real
     life gamer to complain about the speed to justify spending some
     time looking over cmove.tex.

 11. I just figured out how to speed up computer movement an additional
     4x but I doubt that I can get it programmed in before the Sunday
     Morning deadline.

 12. All this time my HighlightSprite was messed up and nobody ever
     noticed it.  But when I stared at it I noticed that the right hand
     side was messed up somehow. It turned out that the right side of
     frame 3 was exactly the opposite of how it was supposed to be.
     FIXED.

 13. I rewrote SqDistance in optimized assembly code. It is now 11x as
     fast as before. C version took about 1834 cycles while mine takes
     only about 156 cycles. Cycle times listed are for 68000. I am
     hoping this will translate into making the computer creatures move
     4x as fast because SqDistance is in the inner-innerloop and gets
     executed a LOT.

 14. Collapse magic castles, dark citadels and magic woods as
     appropriate.

 15. I have changed the animator to do only @{i}1@{ui} Obtain/Release Semaphore
     pair per update. This saves 474 jsr/rts combos per frame resulting
     in a significant speed increase in the animator task.

 16. BUG: When you run out of spells in Texas Trash'em the game gets
     stuck. You can't choose a spell or exit the spell-choosing phase.
     You are just stuck.

 17. I just noticed that the animator is still animating at full speed
     even when the spell and creature information panels are being
     displayed. I had noticed a long time ago that the spell info
     screen is filled with text rather slowly on the 7.15909Mhz 68000
     so I have adjusted the information panels to stop the animation
     while they are up. This will speed up the display of text a bit
     plus lighten the multitasking load on the system while the gamer
     reads his spell description. BTW: This is a good example of the
     clipping that the OS DrawImage routine does. It clips the whole
     entire image and draws nothing when a full screen window is up.

 18. Replaced old intro with "something more spectacular".

 19. Quadruple the resolution of the old intro.

 20. Same number of colors as the old intro (since the old one only
     used 8 colors this was not hard 8) I only used 8 colors to
     conserve chipram and hopefully be able to include one of my Chaos
     Theme Songs along with the inro.

 21. Smooth Scrolling.

 22. Colorfading effect.

 23. The text has different colors and shadows each time for variety.

 24. ExtraLarge, easy to read, colorized fonts.

 25. Quadruple-Channel music played with the rather lame, buggy and
     system-unfriendly ptreplay.library.

 26. As far as strategy games go, the new intro-credits-presentation is
     fairly good but it is still quite lame compared to Action Games and
     Action/Strategy Games.

 27. OOPS! I was just about to add background music to the intro so I
     looked at my filesizes: 410k, 550k, 393k, 250k. Hmmm.. The intro
     music may just have to require 1 meg of chipram. Maybe the 250k
     one will fit. The 250k one is the simplest sounding one though. I
     also have a SPECTACULARLY GOOD LOOKING 16color super-well-textured
     ColorFont that we could use in the intro but the font is about
     400k so I'll probably just use it in the "2 Megs of chipram intro".

 28. I have implemented some simple code at the beginning of
     CommenceChaos to determine the currentdir and then Assign
     ChaosGame: to that dir. So now we can load fonts from
     "ChaosGame:fonts/fontname.font" and everything works great! I
     presume that this has also solved the problems of loading my
     ChaosThemeSongs, sound effects and other things.

 29. 2 new asm functions: pal and ntsc. To switch into either video mode
     instantly on any ECS Agnus equiped Amiga. Which means @{i}any@{ui} Amiga
     manufactured in the 1990's plus some of the Amigas from 1989 plus
     anybody who upgraded their old Amigas to an ECS Agnus.

 30. Computer Tree Casting Speedup. NOW, after all that, computer
     treecasting should be noticeably faster on the A500 than before.

 31. Growth Rates are still a bit too high but especially Violet Fungi
     so: I just changed SPUD_CONSTANT from 5 to 6 and FUNGI_RATE from
     30 to 40 in at attempt to keep growths from taking over the world.
     Now I've played some test games with it like this and it seems
     just GREAT! Now it is working the way I envisioned it!

 32. Couldn't see the Ogre Mage or bird lord shot most of the time. I
     think it had just been drawing to fast.

 33. BUG: Bird Lord shot me and it didn't redraw my cell. (I was
     invulnerable at the time, if that makes any difference) Bird Lord
     shot another creature and it was redrawn properly. NOW FIXED.

 34. The 2nd voice sample in ChaosTheme1 just didn't sound right so I
     deleted it and saved 49k. Now my small themesong is only 201k.
     Hopefully that will fit into a 512k chipram intro.

 35. A wizard with lots of creatures and a doube-triple put all 6 of
     his armours on the @{i}same@{ui} creature even though he had other
     creatures that were wounded. He wasted at least half of his
     armours.

 36. Same game later on... Right now there is a DEAD pegasus. It says
     dead and it has the dead image. Yet it has life and people are
     attacking it. ?? It was next to a shadowwood so maybe when a
     ShadowWood kills something this is what happens? This was probably
     caused by a growth and is probably FIXED now.

 37. Fire covered up my wizard who was on a horse but it didn't kill my
     team and it didn't put my creatures to sleep and I could still
     play (but without my wizard). When I click on the cell that I was
     on I can see my powerups just like as if I was in a tree. Next
     turn I killed the fire with my creatures and uncovered my wizard
     and everything was back to normal.

 38. HighlightSprite kept highlighting some tree each time it was
     Matt's turn.  (he was player 3) No big deal, it just looks funny.
     We kept making jokes that he must have a "Magic Owl" in that tree
     or something. FIXED.

 39. Independent Spiderwebs didn't show up at first due to no ReDrawCell
     command. FIXED.

 40. 2 different Computer Wizards cast CLOAK and then aborted the spell
     because they were in a tree and they had no creatures yet.

 41. When a growth no longer covers a dead body the body becomes
     "unalive" FIXED.

 42. Computer wizards aborted Combat, Cloak, Raise Dead.

 43. A Computer-controlled wizard just mounted an independent Nightmare!

 44. 4th from the bottom, 7th from the right, the green ooze is being
     drawn 1 pixel too far down. Cell coords must be off for that cell.
     It is DEFINITELY being redrawn 1 pixel too low. Sometimes the blob
     is drawn off by about 3 pixels.

 45. Blob covered up computer wizard and "killed" him but the game
     didn't end and his powerups show when I click on that blob. This
     might be because the computer wizard in question has LichLord.
     Next Turn: WOW! Now the covered wizard just cast invulnerability
     on himself. He can't attack or move though, apparently. Next Turn:
     Now he just vengeanced my elephant! Next Turn: Now he cast a
     Spectre! And he is still covered up by the green blob.  As far as
     I can tell this is exactly the way it is suposed to work due to
     him having LichLord. I have no complaints. It is just freaky. 8)

 46. Tried to make an autobooting version of Chaos for 1.3. I've done
     this before and it always worked but now it loads then crashes. I
     don't know why but it might be because of that stupid
     ptreplay.library. I went to an awful lot of trouble to avoid using
     OS2.0+ functions so that it would work on all Amigas. Ok, I just
     tested it and it DEFINITELY is the ptreplay.library that is
     causing the crash on the 68000.

 47. Speeded up WeaponEffect

 48. Speeded up ThreeBeam

 49. On a screenfull of creatures I often can't spot the victim of a
     DarkPower/ Justice/ Exorcise/ Vengeance so now the victim is
     HighLighted.

Improvements from 1.8 to 1.81
-----------------------------

  1. Improved the Docs to be in sync with the new version 1.8 features.

  2. Acquired the OctaMED/RBF software play routines directly from Ray
     Burt-Frost himself. I have no idea if I am actually going to use
     any of it though.

  3. Put my Lame old icon into the distribution.

  4. Fixed off-center WizardExplode.

  5. Changed descriptions of Dark Power, Exorcise, Justice, Vengeance,
     Consecrate, Invert and Brain Boost.

  6. Violet Fungi growth rate STILL WAY TOO HIGH. I have now instituted
     a new growth formula which will hopefully make the growths do what
     we wanted. And I put SPUD_CONSTANT back down to 5 like it used to
     be.

  7. I just came in the room and looked at the screen and I noticed
     something: The graphics seemed much more appealing than they used
     to be. The screen is filled with all sorts of little animated
     critters plus loads of webs and some earthquakes. It just all
     looks enticing and interesting somehow. All the extra movement
     from the faster frame rate makes everything more exciting.

  8. Allegedly fixed the bug where computer wizards cast Raise Dead on
     growths.

  9. Allegedly fixed the problem of Computer Wizards casting Armour on
     creatures with max life.

Improvements from 1.81 to 1.9
-----------------------------

  1. Incorporated new image data.

  2. Added the following new spells: Derro, Mud Man, Spriggan,
     Agathion, Annis, Azer, Banderlog, Bodak, Cat Lord, Jann, Marid,
     Shade, Dao, Bandit, Hybsil, Fire Bat, Shadow Dragon, Spectator,
     Crimson, Drelb, Haunt, Juju, Solar, Quickshot, Discard, Boil,
     Passage.

  3. Fixed the graphics for the golden and platinum dragon.

  4. Played a game; quickly remembered that I hadn't finished the
     coding for all my new spells. The image for Quickshot has some how
     got inverted, very strange. There were still lots of dead wizards
     lying about the screen. A cloaked sleeping dragon did not appear
     cloaked on the screen. The program crashed when a manticore shot a
     magic wood tree.

  5. Made a change in move.tex hopefully to stop dead wizards.

  6. Added the SPRITES flag to the Chaos screen.

  7. Discovered that CHAOSANIM is causing a huge number of enforcer
     violations.  I suspect this may be because there is an unbalanced
     ReleaseSemaphore in the program. It seems to start happening after
     a wizard dies. I removed my changes, but it didn't improve the
     situation.

  8. Completed the preliminary coding for the spell manager for
     creatures.

  9. Fixed a bug wherby a dead wizard with the "Uncertainity" spell
     could result in dead creatures being case as if they were alive.

 10. Allegedly modified te freeze spell to work on independents. --JC
     tested this and it really works.

 11. Completed spell files for all objects on the board.

 12. Whew, I have just finished making spell files for all our spells
     (all 255 of them, now I added my new ones). The next one should be
     interesting since any byte quantities hanging around related to
     spells might break. Well, I won't be adding any more for a little
     while anyway.

 13. Change the ordering of spells by swapping LichLord with Mutate (so
     that all computer assistance spells come after consecrate).

 14. The was obviously a problem reading "chaos.prb" because all the
     spells were unusual ones. Fixed that problem. But then the game
     crashed just after a wizard died. Suspecting my fix to stop dead
     wizards I have temporarily disabled it. The whole problem of
     killing wizards needs a good going over and rationalization.

 15. Fixed alignment of first set up screen.

 16. Fixed some bugs to do with scoring.

 17. Allegedly changed Texas'em so that when less than six spells
     remain no discard is required. This probably needs some sound to
     stop people clicking on each others spells. Tested OK.

 18. Added variant spider webs, this has pushed the number of spells
     over 255 and some problems might occur.

 19. Fixed the loading/saving problem.

 20. Added some mechanism for a turn counter. There is no warning that
     the game is about to end, also the scores aren't shown at the end.

 21. Replaced About menu.

 22. Added turn counter and discarding flag to the save file.

 23. Fixed a bug relating to the Dao.

 24. Elimited the single pixel blue line from the top of the screen.

 25. Replaced the new game menu.

 26. Completed implementation of the discard spell.

 27. Completed implementation of the quickshot spell (image still
     reversed tho).

 28. Fixed screen clearing when loading a saved game.

 29. Replaced the quit menu.

 30. Only the file menu now relies on reqtools, and will continue to do
     so in the mean time.

 31. Fixed yet another bug to do with discarding.

 32. Fixed a problem relating to the Eartquake and my change to the
     Reinstate function

 33. Made the solar always move on its own accord.

 34. Made the Cat Lord more rigourous. Technically, there should only
     ever be one Cat Lord at a time (ok, there are some ways around
     this, but they will probably be entertaining if they occur, so I'm
     leaving them). The Cat Lord should now move all cats. The latest
     code does prevent multiple Cat Lords from being cast or generated.

 35. Completed implementation of the haunt and solar.

 36. Did some optimisation and tidying up of BoardUpdate.

 37. Implemented computer discarding for Texas trash'em.

 38. Stopped computer wizards from attempting Cat Lord while one on
     screen.

 39. Fixed a problem with dead graphics.

 40. Implemented agent casting of general magic spells.

 41. Completed implementation of Agathion.

 42. Allowed faun to cast sleep.

 43. Allowed azer to cast quench.

 44. Stopped horrors reproducing after the first time.

 45. Completed implementation of Dao.

 46. Agents now highlighted and show owner when casting.

 47. Completed implementation of Jann, Dao, and Marid.

 48. Stopped Justice, Dark Power, and Vengeance on growths.

 49. Allegedly fixed scoring (now tested, it looks ok).

 50. Turned on highlighting for Speed and Slow spells

 51. Turns remaining now displayed on the far right of the screen at
     the top.

 52. Turn counter stuff now works reasonably well. The game will stop
     when all turns are exhausted and the scores will be given.

 53. Problem: Start Chaos and Quit. An Alert pops up (like a guru but
     yellow and non-fatal) that says "Recoverable Error: 0100 0008" I
     looked it up and that means "Damaged Semaphore". NOW FIXED.

 54. Edited descriptions of Marid,Rat.

 55. Fixed up Timing Code.

 56. When simulacrumming an unanimated creature with double in effect
     it is not drawn immediately. In fact it isn't drawn till something
     triggers ReDrawAll=YES. NOW FIXED.

 57. I noticed that Reflector always did exactly 3 points of damage to
     the shooter rather than actually "reflecting" the damage back to
     the shooter.  e.g. A White Dragon shot me and it should have
     "reflected" 9 points of damage back to him but instead only did 3.
     Also, if the wizard had a 15 Ranged Combat Rating then even a
     Camel would get hit with 15 points of retaliatory damage. Also, if
     an Undead Shooter shoots an ordinary Reflectified Wizard then the
     damage does NOT reflect onto the shooter; instead it is an
     "invalid attack, cannot attack undead" So in fact either the spell
     should be renamed to "Retaliation" or "Retaliatory Strike" or the
     Reflector Spell Code should be reworked to actually "reflect" the
     incoming damage. I chose to rework the code so now the exact
     damage is always reflected onto the shooter. Even the exact @{i}type@{ui}
     of damage is reflected: Intelligence damage is reflected as
     Intelligence damage. Ditto for poisoning and all the other stats.

 58. Implemented linearly equidistant ascending order bitplanes. Works
     fine.  >From now on all custom gfx routines can gain an extra 15%
     or more speed due to this fact.

 59. OK NOW AT LONG LAST, COMPUTER TREE-CASTING SHOULD BE ABOUT 3x as
     fast as before!!!!!!

 60. Implemented Split-Screen Technology. Or in the present form it
     might be better referred to as Dual-Screen Technology.

 61. Subversion of a sleeping creature did not clear Sleeping Stat;
     although the owner was correctly changed. Now it does.

 62. When a cloaked creature goes to sleep the cloak image disappears;
     although the creature keeps the cloaked stat. That in itself is
     not a problem; however, once woken the cloak image does not
     return. Ok, I fixed it so a sleeping cloaked creature who is
     awakened will show up graphically as a cloaked creature.

 63. BUG: Closing the FileRequester or selecting CANCEL does not
     actually cancel anything. The game still loads/saves the game. NOW
     FIXED.

 64. PROBLEM: Whenever the game stops the animation system for a
     legitimate reason the sprite also stops. This results in jerky
     sprite animation on all Amigas. On the A500 this is especially
     noticeable since the sprite spends most of its time in slow motion
     and jerking arouind in an icky manner.  SOLUTION: I have
     Implemented the sprite animation as a vertical blank interrupt so
     it will ALWAYS be animated smoothly, regardless of
     ObtainSemaphore() or Forbid(). This makes playing the game on the
     A500 a zillion times better. This should also allow the sprite to
     keep up with moving creatures better.

 65. Implemented new ChaosColorCycler Task which is responsible for all
     color cycling. This allows color cycling to continue unabated even
     when the CHAOSANIM Task is prevented from running by an
     ObtainSemaphore.

 66. Implemented new method for seeing which stats are attacked by
     Combat, Ranged Combat and Special Combat. Just click on Combat and
     the stats that it attacks will begin flashing. The old method was
     just never clear enough for me. Hopefully this new method will
     make things more clear.

 67. Pressing the "r" key now shows the shooting range of the current
     creature by highlighting the cells that can be shot. Looks kewl!

 68. Pressing the "s" key now shows the cells that the current creature
     can shoot into (taking into account any LineOfSight requirements).

 69. Pressing the "m" key now shows the cells that the current creature
     can move into.

 70. FLAW: computer controlled creatures can't shoot quite as far as
     human controlled creatures due to the fact that humans are given
     an extra .5 on their range while computer players are not. I have
     now rewritten the range code such that all shooting ranges are
     calculated identically for humans, computers and the "r" and "s"
     keys. NOW FIXED.

 71. When a creature is about to shoot, its actual .Range stat is
     printed at the bottom of the screen.

 72. PROBLEM: When deciding which spell to cast, the really cool
     auto-mouse-reporting feature that tells you what thing is under
     your mouse pointer is deactivated. I've been wanting to keep this
     active during spell selection forever. Now I finally did it! YAY!

 73. The "r" and "s" and "m" keys now work on whatever cell the
     mousepointer is over at the time of the keypress!!! (Assuming
     there is no creature currently highlighted.) YAHOO! Now we can
     easily inspect the ranges and movement capabilities of any
     creature!!!!

 74. Now if you press SHIFT+r or SHIFT+s or SHIFT+m it displays the
     range info for the creature under the mousepointer @{i}even@{ui} if you
     have already clicked on a creature and that creature is
     highlighted by the sprite. This allows you to go around
     graphically inspecting the ranges of creatures right in the middle
     of moving one of your monsters!! Kewl!

 75. Implemented the new Highlighting method on Creations + Allies with
     numeric keys.

 76. Fixed the bug pertaining to the Dao, Marid etc.

 77. Implemented flying pointer.

 78. Fixed Invert slowness.

 79. Fixed Hide spell showing up on spell lists inappropriately
     (actually caused by Passage having rank 0 and prob 100)

 80. Gave Marid and Dao to more sensible probabilities.

 81. Fixed quickshot imagery

 82. Allowed reincarnation of creature even when mounted.

 83. Added new spells: Abath, Abduction, Acid Rain, Amphisbaena,
     Archery, Betrayal, Thundermare, Iridium Horse, Chaos Lord,
     Devastation, Disection, Hidden Horror, Mana Battery, Meddle,
     Necropotence, Points, Bipedal Generator.

 84. Implemented the secret powerup Horse->Thundermare->Iridium.

 85. There was a bug in UpdateBoard that is not looking after wizard
     stats properly, I discovered this after implementing the ChaosLord
     spell.

 86. Set the Classic flag for all the appropriate spells. Also changed
     the game to start in "classic" mode by default.

 87. Allegedly fixed a problem that was causing the game to hang on
     Quit.

 88. Modified the I/O routines to save the entire probability table
     with a saved game. NOW TESTED, all seems to work.

Improvements from 1.9 to 2.0
----------------------------

  1. Made minor changes to most of the new spell descriptions: Abath,
     Abduction, Acid Rain, Amphisbaena, Archery, Betrayal, Thundermare,
     Iridium Horse, Chaos Lord, Devastation, Disection, Hidden Horror,
     Mana Battery, Meddle, Necropotence, Points, Bipedal Generator.

  2. 1 bug in DoComputerCast removed.

  3. I could find no evidence in the casting code of Depth removing LOS
     requirements so I changed the description of Depth accordingly.

  4. DoComputerCast never checks the CAST_GROWTH bit. This explains why
     they cast weird spells on growths. They were cheating!

  5. DoComputerCast never checks for the presence of an Arborist spell.
     Poor guys. They could NEVER put 2 trees next to each other.

  6. That's a total of 4 discrepancies between DoCast and
     DoComputerCast. I fixed all this by writing a new "Grand Unified
     Spellcasting Rules Function" that DoCast and DoComputerCast and
     the "c" key all use to determine if a postulated cell/spell/wizard
     combination would be legal or not. This should help to eliminate
     lots of bugs in the future. From now on, all spellcasting rules
     just go one place ObeySpellCastingRules. This ensures that both
     computer wizards and human wizards and agents all follow the exact
     same set of rules.

  7. c = casting. During the spellcasting phase you can press c and all
     the legal targets for your spell are highlighted in the color
     cycling color.  This can be useful in the regular game as well as
     for testing the spellcasting rules.

  8. q = query = question mark to bring up info screens.

  9. Added new subsection to the docs "Keys" Plus other small
     improvements.

 10. Mini Level Editor Upgrade.

 11. Added the bar graphs of the recovery rates to the information
     panel.

 12. Columnarized the stats on the 2nd info screen so SAI will have
     room to implement his "Creatures Killed" stuff. In my notes I
     called it "Foes Vanquished"

 13. Fixed that annoying problem where an independent creature could
     move next to one of your creatures and attack it while the
     highlight sprite didn't bother to highlight the creature in its
     new cell until AFTER the attack was complete and even then it was
     instantly turned off. NOW FIXED. The sprite now appears to keep up
     much better.

 14. BUG: The computer seems to think that player 2 and DEADP are on
     the same team. It looked very strange when I pressed "2" and all
     the dead things on the screen lit up in BLUE. NOW FIXED.

 15. FLAW: ChaosLord did not set the FLYING_STAT bit of the wizard. NOW
     FIXED.

 16. MAJOR new gameplay mechanic: scrolls. Sometimes it is just plain
     fun to collect things and add them to your colletion. This applies
     to both games and real life. To some extent it adds the
     "Colonization" Play-Mechanic because you want to hurry up and grab
     as many scrolls as you can early in the game rather than just
     sitting in a tree meditating. btw: Scrolls make being player 7 or
     8 more advantageous. All in all Scrolls make a powerful additional
     option for an already superb game. There are now some intriguing
     new ways to play the game. Like start with 0 or 1 spells but 99
     Scrolls with you against 3 enemy wizards and 1 generator. It makes
     the game take on a whole new flavor.

 17. I was having a serious bug where scrolls with an ID > RevealID
     were being inserted into cells. This caused enforcer hits and lots
     of crashes.

 18. BUG: Program lets you select growths to move. NOW FIXED.

 19. Fixed MassMorph to not destroy bipedal generators.

 20. Made independent attract to Mana Battery.

 21. Fixed problem of info of spells without description.

 22. Made minor changes to game docs.

 23. Made a slight change to the testing of spells during scroll
     insertion.

 24. Started implementation of foes vanquished.

 25. Modified editor to work with scrolls.

 26. Added scrolls docs to user docs. Didn't do it very well however.

 27. Fixed Abduction and Raise Dead (for some reason Raise Dead was
     leaving the corpse underneath). Actually I think that means the
     corpse was already there which means there is something else wrong
     as well.

 28. Vanquished foes now working including saving of this information.
     However, I am not at all convinced that memory is been released
     properly in all cases when an object dies, e.g. when a creature
     falls in a pit. Also when a spell like Replicate is used, this
     replicates the vanquished list for that creature as well (not
     quite, both creatures end up using the same list-since this is
     rather neat I haven't changed it).

 29. Implemented a bomb explosion effect. It is now used for Nuke and
     the Goblin Bomb.

 30. Fixed the recovery rate code.

Improvements from 2.0 to 2.1
----------------------------

  1. BUG: Wizard kills some creatures. Wizard mounts something. Mount
     dies permanently. Wizard's vanquished foes info not copied into
     cell.vanquished.  FIXED

  2. BUG: same as above but with collapsing meditations. FIXED

  3. Inserted version information compatible with the AmigaDOS version
     command.

  4. ARTIFACTS UPGRADE

  5. Hidden Artifacts implemented.

  6. Now that I have implemented hidden artifacts and scrolls I find
     that I cannot attack objects that belong to NOBODY. I'm not fixing
     this right away so that I can play the game like this for a while
     and see what it is like.  The game does let me shoot objects
     belonging to NOBODY though. NOW FIXED.

  7. Made numerous changes so that killing any object that is covering
     a scroll or artifact does NOT destroy the scroll/artifact. In
     general, if a creature dies while on top of a scroll then the
     corpse for the creature goes to the underpart and the scroll goes
     to the top part.

  8. Hidden scrolls and artifacts are now fully supported. You can now
     "dig up" buried scrolls and artifacts. You can now have wars over
     a particular scroll, with one creature moving onto the cell and
     being killed by another creature who is then killed by yet
     another, ad infinitum and the scroll won't be destroyed.

  9. Made 2 fixes to prevent Thundermare and Iridium transformations
     from destroying scrolls underfoot.

 10. Set CAST_ARTIFACT on all appropriate magic spell files. Artifact
     creatures are treated just like any other creature for purposes of
     spell-casting.

 11. Hidden Scrolls implemented.

 12. Inanimate objects can no longer pick up scrolls.

 13. Changed spider description to say that it eats scrolls. (since the
     act of laying a web destroys any scroll that may have been
     underneath it.)

 14. Scroll delay implemented. So now it is @{i}very@{ui} possible to have wars
     over scrolls. You can set the scroll delay to 3 turns and then you
     must take the cell and HOLD it for 3 turns straight. If someone
     dislodges you from the cell before 3 turns is up then you don't
     get the scroll and must retake it and start over.

 15. BUG: Ropers destroy whatever they are standing on when
     teleporting. Oops no it doesn't. When the roper teleports it takes
     whatever it is standing on with it. Interesting.

 16. BUGS: Roper scrolls teleport, growth scrolls alter growth rates,
     Spider scrolls lay webs, Haunt scrolls change sides, meditation
     scrolls collapse, spriggan scrolls "take a kip". ALL FIXED NOW.

 17. Improved computer spell selection. This should completely
     eliminate all the really stupid casts where the wizard tries to
     cast an impossible spell due to there not being any legal targets.
     (Such as casting Raise Dead when there are NO corpses in range.)

 18. BUGS: Computer wizards were cheating! They were going through
     their ENTIRE spell list and casting any spell they wanted! And
     they were going through their entire spell list and discarding any
     spell they wanted! NOW FIXED

 19. New function: isStupidCast.

 20. Improved computer spell selection by using isStupidCast along with
     isIllegalCast. Now if a wizard contemplates casting combat but his
     only legal targets are enemy creatures or his own combat aerial
     servant he will simply decide that casting combat in this
     situation would be stupid and will cast something else instead.

 21. ADDED lots of extra checks for spells to probably not cast while
     double or triple is in effect.

 22. ADDED complete stupidity checking regarding multiple wizard
     powerups.

 23. FLAW: A computer wizard was in a tree. There were several legal
     targets for the slow spell that he cast but unfortunately, all the
     targets were already speed 1 so the spell was really wasted. NOW
     FIXED.

 24. SMALL FLAW: A computer wizard in a Dark Citadel just cast Speed on
     his Floating Eye. I'm sure he had at least a few other spells that
     would have been better. NOW FIXED.

 25. FLAW: A computer wizard cast Sanctuary on himself even though he
     already had Recover Boost. (He had no creatures on the board). He
     should have cast any one of a number of other better spells. NOW
     FIXED.

 26. Numerous other flawed spell selections fixed using the same method
     as above. This new "look before you cast" strategy is really
     working out nicely! The only strategy game that might be better
     than Chaos is Chaos Coding.

 27. BUG: I just surrounded a computer wizard with weak walls. (He had
     already selected Lightning as his spell). When it became his turn
     to cast he cast it on one of my weak walls. The wall then had 83
     life points. Fixed by SAI.

 28. After ages of hacking and slashing music asm code I am now ready to
     integrate the new music playback system into Chaos.

 29. Commented out EVERYTHING to do with the awful ptreplay.library.
     Now that the new music system is @{i}finally@{ui} in and working:
     ADVANTAGES of new music system vs. ptreplay.library: 1. It
     actually works. 2. It works on MC68000 processors unlike
     ptreplay.library. 3. It can play Sound/Noise/Mutant/ProTracker
     music without messing them up like ptreplay.library did. 4. Also
     supports 8-channel Oktalyzer music. (untested at this time)
     ptreplay.library has no 8-channel support. 5. It has a rudimentary
     IFF 8SVX sound sample play routine also. 6. It was originally
     written by my good buddy Bryan Ford the MEGACODER. 7. It is very
     easy to add med/octamed support should we decide to do so. 8. It
     is very easy to add support for a BUNCH of other music formats but
     those other formats are all irrelevant AFAIK. 9. MOST IMPORTANTLY:
     It _shares_ the sound channels in a system friendly manner!!!
     Something that _NO_ other replay routine does!!! (That I know of
     or could find any evidence of or have even heard of.)
     DISADVANTAGES of new music system vs. ptreplay.library. 1. Takes
     26k instead of only 10k. 2. It might be a LOT slower. I just don't
     know. We need to somehow test its speed by running a program and
     timing it then running the same program again with the music going
     and see if there is a speed difference. 3. It isn't a shared
     library so it can't be flushed out in a low memory situation. 4.
     It doesn't have volume fade in/out because I haven't got around to
     implementing that yet. This isn't really a disadvantage though
     since the volume fade in/out of ptreplay.library caused crashes
     anyway.

 30. DELETED all code related to ptreplay.library.

 31. BUG? I was playing a nice little game... I had surrounded a bipedal
     generator except for 1 cell. I just cast a faun into that cell.
     Then it said "Banderlog sleep" and my Red Dragon was put to sleep
     and instantly collapsed! ARGH! There are no banderlog's on the
     screen! Could my Faun have cast sleep on my own creature? The
     exact same thing just happened again!  This time my gorilla got
     put to sleep! I think maybe I am casting creatures onto a dead
     banderlog. Now I'm in a completely different situation and my Faun
     just put my harpy to sleep. This faun has killed more of my
     creatures than the enemy has. Now my other faun on the other side
     of the board put my manticore to sleep. I guess Fauns just cast
     their sleep spell on anybody...  Now my faun put my Crocodile to
     sleep.

 32. Quadrascope and Spectrogram added to the setup screens to go along
     with the music.

 33. BUG: When a creature is engaged it can still "attack" an empty
     cell and move onto it. NOW FIXED for human players. This bug may
     still exist for computer players.

 34. I made a smake release and tested it on my A2000 and disabled the
     chipram down to 512k to see if it would work. IT DID!!! AMIGA
     RULES!!! I just can't imagine any W95 program running with only
     55k of free ram and not crashing after 5 minutes or so.

 35. Adjusted alignment of scopes to allow them to run a bit faster.
     Saves 64 chipram reads and 64 chipram writes per frame drawn per
     scope. Rewrote the quadrascopes to run at 3x the framerate that
     they were running previously.  They now run at MAXIMUM speed (50
     fps). Quadrascopes are now much more "electric".

 36. BUG: Artifact ties were being awarded to the higher player number
     rather than to NOBODY. NOW FIXED.

 37. BUG: Inanimate objects are exerting influence on artifacts. NOW
     FIXED.

 38. BUG: Joe cast Magic Bolt on a web and it increased the web's life
     to 33 points or something. Now REALLY fixed.

 39. BUG: I cast a Magic Bolt on a freshly generated skeleton. The
     skeleton then had 25 life points! Now REALLY fixed.

 40. BUG: computer wizard cast dark citadel several squares away.

 41. Edited some spell descriptions and removed spell-casting ability
     from Faun because I really hated it and couldn't stand it any
     longer.

 42. FLAW: Wizards kept subverting/abducting/betraying artifacts. NOW
     FIXED.

 43. Changed: Bipedal generators no longer produce bears.

 44. Changed: Moved end-of-turn gadget to be FAR away from question
     mark gadget.  My entire family has been bugging me about this for
     years. Every time we play they say "That shouldn't be there next
     to the question mark."

 45. l key for line of sight. It works like the other keypresses execpt
     that this one simply shows all the cells that can be seen from the
     current cell.  This is very useful if you are thinking of casting
     a certain spell that needs line-of-sight and you want to be sure
     that you have it. Simply place the mouse pointer over your wizard
     and press "l" to see all the cells that he has line-of-sight into.

 46. Fixed it so that the game startup after setup screen II doesn't
     look so bad on slow machines.

 47. The line of sight testing was just too slow on A500.

Improvements from 2.1 to 2.2
----------------------------

  1. The spell selection by computer players was notably slower on the
     A500 (this is your new regime of spell selection). However, the
     real problem here was that there was not enough on screen
     indication of what was happening. NOW FIXED

  2. Somehow there was a sleeping neo-otuygh which was not redrawn.

  3. Somehow there was a sleeping ogre-mage that was still animated.

  4. The team scores were still not correctly sorted.

  5. Several times players shot there own "hidden horrors" to reveal
     the red dragon. I think the probability of the hidden horror needs
     to be reduced below that of the red dragon. NOW FIXED

  6. The game locks up on the A500 when starting a new game after the
     completion on the previous game. The only seems to happen when
     there are lots of wizards. It can also be avoided by starting a
     new game from the menu before the game ends naturally. I am
     assuming that this situation is because memory is tight. NOW FIXED

  7. The teleport explode effect is applied to the wrong player. NOW
     FIXED

  8. The boil explode effect is applied to fire rather than water. NOW
     FIXED

  9. The initial set up was the same every time the program was loaded.
     NOW FIXED

 10. If you set the number of turns to "n" you actually get "n+1"
     turns. NOW FIXED

 11. Computer wizards and not conforming to the rules regarding the
     necropotence spell and discard spell. NOW FIXED

 12. Dad pressed the end-turn gadget in an attempt to cancel a spell.
     Instead it tried to cast the creature to some location off the
     bottom of the screen.  NOW FIXED (end of turn ghosted during
     casting)

 13. There is insufficient information given to the player indicating
     the pick up of a scroll. NOW FIXED (there is a text message and an
     audio effect)

 14. Casting Biohazard gave all scrolls recovery -1 and they
     subsequently all died in the next round. NOW ALLEGEDLY FIXED

 15. Flying creatures still show wings cursor even when engaged. NOW
     FIXED

 16. I cast a Meddle causing the nightmare I was mounted to become a
     skeleton (i.e. I should now have been mounted on a skeleton); but
     when I moved the skeleton my wizard was not moved. I think this
     means I need to check the "mounted" bit carefully when doing
     reincarnation. ALLEGEDLY FIXED

 17. Glen pointed out that the archery spell description does not
     actually say what the spell does, although he guessed correctly.
     NOW FIXED.

 18. Callum wanted "RETURN" to mean end-of-turn. NOW FIXED

 19. Callum suggested the right hand set of bars on the info pages be
     labelled "Recovery" at the top. NOW FIXED

 20. Fixed a bug with Repulsion which could leave the colours
     permanently screwed up.

 21. Made isStupidCast compliant with agent casting.

 22. Made menu option for script font on info screens.

 23. Made menu option for agent casting.

 24. Stopped the computer from moved onto nuked squares. Allowed
     computer creatures to decide the best option is not to move.

 25. Computer wizards now move towards and stay on scrolls.

 26. Added Turns, Dread Elf, Dagger, Gravity, Demonic Touch

 27. Added secret power up WoodElf->DreadElf (make 5 kills with wood
     elf)

 28. Added gravity to information display.

 29. Fixed FileIO to save gravity information.

 30. Fixed end-of-game bug that caused lockups. Still haven't fixed the
     quit bug.

 31. Allegedly completed implementation of Volcano.

 32. Added two new generators: one for birds, one for dragons.

 33. Improved the loading and saving of the probability table.

 34. FIXED at last the ReleaseSemaphore problem when quiting the game.

 35. Made fake wizards actually capable of spell casting.

 36. Allowed combat on movement rating (see Arctic Wolf).

 37. Added: Arctic Wolf, Virtue, Shadow City, Basilisk, Achiyalabopa,
     and Paradigm Shift.

 38. Made <RETURN> equivalent to end-of-turn. Problem: holding down
     return will cause multiple player to have end-of-turn. To overcome
     this I have put in a delay, but this is a rather weak solution. If
     only there was a RAWKEYUP IDCMP event this would be easy to fix,
     but I couldn't find anything in the docs about doing this.

 39. Replaced $ in chaos.font with a bullet.

 40. Improved the image for the Nuke spell.

 41. Improved the image for the Lightning spell.

 42. Added: Animate, Ball Lightning, Shocker, Basalt Golem, Emerald
     Dragon, Willy, Glass, Battle Cry, Coercion, Confidence, Eye for an
     Eye, Torment, and Materialize.

 43. Made the secret powerup GreenDragon->EmeraldDragon.

 44. Implemented Eye-for-an-Eye in combat routines.

 45. Fixed a small problem in the intro sequence where "Wizards" and
     "Webs" were printed multiple times.

 46. Added new powerups for creatures making high numbers of kills (in
     the form of specific bonus spells).

 47. Devastation spell now correctly awards points.

 48. Added casting contraints to computer spell selection for new
     spells.

 49. Moved the foes vanquished display onto the first info screen.

 50. Added editor support for artifacts.

 51. Replaced the reqtools with a file requester of my own making. It
     is pretty slack at the moment, but at least we can get rid of
     reqtools now. This is good for three reasons: (i) less effort for
     users (don't need to install reqtools), (ii) smaller overall
     memory requirement for game, (iii) no negotiation needed with
     reqtools author for a commercial release.

 52. Allegedly reduced the likelihood of computer creatures shooting
     wizards protected with invulnerability.

 53. If the level now increases above 5, then new spells (and the
     initial spell list in the case of computer wizards) will be
     composed mainly of unique spells.

 54. Converted the Intelligence stat from 3 bits to 4 bits and modified
     all spell files, info.tex, and cast.tex accordingly. If we made
     .MR 4 bits most stats would then be the same, but the MR case
     would be a lot harder to do than Intel was.

 55. Added FLAG_NOWIZARDCELL to the computer assistance flags, to
     indicate spells not to be applied to cells containing a wizard
     even if the wizard is mounted or meditating (e.g. Alter Reality).

 56. Creatures killing their favourite food now get a combat and
     recovery rate boost.

Improvements from 2.2 to 2.3
----------------------------

  1. BUG: Computer wizards refused to cast Magic Bow if they had double
     or triple in effect. Bows and swords are cumulative so it is
     desirable to cast them with triple. NOW FIXED

  2. EDITED spell descriptions: Gray Elf, Willy, Arctic Wolf, Gravity,
     Virtue (btw: why is this spell called Virtue?), Paradigm Shift,
     Ball Lightning, Emerald Dragon, Battle Cry, Coercion (shouldn't
     this be called mind blank or something?), Materialize, Meddle.

  3. BUG: Magic Glass doesn't say "Blocks LOS Enemy Only" on 2nd info
     screen.  FIXED.

  4. BUG: a dragon just shot my wizard through a magic glass. The "l"
     key shows that the dragon does not have line of sight to my wizard
     yet he shot him anyway. The shooting routine (at least for
     independents) must not be taking into account Line of Sight rules
     100%. FIXED

  5. CHANGED: Dagger -> Poison Dagger

  6. CHANGED: Basilisk ranged weapon to attack movement rating.
     (Basilisks are supposed to paralyze with their gaze according to
     the Monster Manual 8)

  7. FLAW: Clicking on Ranged Combat on Info screen of Basilisk or
     Arctic Wolf does not highlight "Movement" so that you can see that
     they attack Movement instead of life. FIXED.

  8. Implemented req.library file requester into the game. I've been
     planning to do this for ages but never had time before. This has
     the following advantages: 1. Easy to use. 2. Features high-speed
     smooth scrolling. 3.  Features powerful pattern-matching. 4.
     Features directory caching.  (YAY!!!!) 5. I've been using it for
     years and it is perfectly reliable. 6.  No negotiation needed to
     use it in our products. 7. Only 18436 bytes in size. That's 27,700
     bytes smaller than reqtools.library and 22,508 bytes smaller than
     asl.library.

  9. PROBLEM: After I've played Chaos for several hours and I'm really
     tired I sometimes select load when I meant to select save.
     Sometimes I select save when I meant to select load with
     disasterous results. Sometimes this happens due to tiredness and
     sometimes due to a less than 100% Right Mouse Button. So I made
     the load and save screens noticeably different. PROBLEM SOLVED.

 10. PROBLEM, after selecting save then cancel the text at the bottom
     of the screen is erased so you can't tell whose turn it is. FIXED.

 11. BUG: Computer controlled archers refuse to shoot things that they
     don't have Line-of-Sight to. In other words, computer creatures
     which have archery ability are never actually @{i}using@{ui} their archery
     ability. NOW FIXED.

 12. CHANGED: Bolter to have 0 Combat. (Since they can't attack anyway.)

 13. CHANGED: Magic Glass to not need line of sight when casting it.
     And it can now be cast on corpses too.

 14. FLAW: After clicking on a flying creature the really cool mouse
     reporting is turned off so you can't automatically know what your
     mouse pointer is over. FIXED.

 15. FLAW: After clicking on a ground creature the really cool mouse
     reporting is sometimes turned off so you can't automatically know
     what your mouse pointer is over. FIXED.

 16. CHANGED: Inanimate objects are no longer highlighted in the color
     cycling color when you press the number keys. Technically, it was
     correct to highlight them with the color cycling color since their
     moved bit was not set but since you cannot move inanimate objects
     or even click on them I decided it was best to have them
     highlighted like other objects which can't currently be moved (in
     red). Ditto for growths.

 17. CHANGED: Speed spell gives 2 attempts instead of 3.

 18. Upgraded Bonus spell selection so that you can see what you did to
     earn the bonus spells.

 19. BUG: Pyrotechnics wasn't awarding bonus spells based upon what it
     killed.  It was always awarding the number of bonus spells
     associated with killing wizards rather than the creature actually
     killed. FIXED.

 20. BUG: Pyrotechnics wasn't awarding points based upon what it
     killed. It was always awarding the number of points of a wizard's
     initial life rather than the number of points of initial life of
     the creature killed. FIXED.

 21. Fixed Team score sorting bug. The problem was that the scores were
     being calculated based on team numbers but displayed based on
     player numbers. It needed to be calculated and displayed based on
     one or the other. NOW FIXED.

 22. BUG: Computer players are casting Magic Castles and Dark Citadels
     far away from themselves. FIXED. (This was considered stupid so I
     just modified isStupidCast to detect this.)

 23. CONFUSING: The display of the Team Icon on a Wizard's info screen
     display.  This is no longer needed due to the improved number keys
     + Team Score display. REMOVED.

 24. q key now quits from info panels any other key continues on just
     like a LMB (Left Mouse Button) press. Now using the q key RAWKS!

 25. BUG: Selecting QUIT from setup screen I or II causes the game to
     crash.  FIXED by commenting out the code for the QUIT and LOAD
     gadgets. This was the easiest and fastest way to fix this problem
     and it makes the program simpler and easier to understand since
     now the ONLY way to quit or load the game is from the dropdown
     menu in the main game.

 26. IMPROVED ChaosDocs.tex a bit.

 27. PROBLEM: I can't tell what my mouse pointer is pointing at when
     using the level editor because the really cool
     auto-mouse-reporting feature isn't there 8(. I just LOVE always
     knowing exactly what I'm pointing at because A) Some creatures
     look just alike and B) I don't remember what every spell looks
     like. Indeed, this is the main reason I liked using my mini-level
     editor; I always knew exactly what I was looking at because the
     computer always automatically told me, no guesswork involved.
     SOLUTION: I put in auto-mouse-reporting code into editor.tex.
     YAY!!!

 28. Implemented stat-editing on info panels when brought up from
     within the level editor (LevelEditorActive==YES). Use the mouse to
     click on the stat and then enter the new stat right on the screen.

 29. Modified combat, ranged combat, special combat gadgets to handle
     up to 4 chars. -15(NULL).

 30. BUG: Most recovery rate graphs are not being redrawn when clicking
     on Combat, Ranged Combat or Special Combat to see what they
     attack. FIXED.

 31. You can now edit attributes on the 2nd info panel. Just click on a
     stat to toggle it.

 32. Tested making an attacking, flying, shooting, meditation,
     mountable set 1, creature generator. Hehehehehee HARHARHAR
     ROFL!!!! It actually works! I can fly my DragonNest around the
     screen attacking and shooting things! And I can mount it and
     dismount it!!!! And it emits dragons for me even while my wizard
     is mounted in it!!!! ROFDL!!!! The game engine gets an A+ for
     allowing this to work on the first try!

 33. FIXED those blocks for Range and Move on info panel. Scooted them
     down 2 pixels.

 34. MAJOR FLAW: sometimes the speech doesn't work, sometimes it
     does... it is completely random. This affects monster names,
     creature names, player names, everything... NOW COMPLETELY FIXED.

 35. FIXED: Pressing Amiga-m or Amiga-n on info screens was clearing
     the info screen because ANY key triggered going to the next info
     screen. NOW FIXED by simply ignoring all keys except for q=quit
     and w,a,tab and return take you to the next info panel.

 36. Speeded up line of sight testing by about 30% in many cases. YAY!

 37. Speeded up SqDistance by 5% (eliminated 8 cycles) asm SqDistance
     is now over 12x as fast as C SqDistance. YAHOO!

 38. Speeded up SqDistance again. (Eliminated 4 cycles on 68000. 68030
     cycle count unchanged.

 39. PENTAGRAM VECTOR UPGRADE: Implemented hyper fast sin and cos asm
     functions.  (JCSin and JCCos) These functions require the input
     angle to be measured in units of jams, NOT degrees or radians. 1
     jam = 1/4096th of a complete circle. btw jams stands for "James'
     Angular Measurement System". This system fully utilizes the power
     of binary integer arithmetic inherent in all CPUs.

 40. Ok, I have now modified all those keypresses that highlight cells
     to temporarily disable the menus. EVERYTHING IS WORKING PERFECTLY
     NOW.

 41. About, New, Quit etc. (things in menu.tex) should get a lock on
     the board first to keep the animatortask from overwriting the
     display. FIXED.

 42. Attempting to edit, load or save produces the message "Removed
     from DEMO version. Please register."

 43. CHANGED: The level editor is no longer mentioned anywhere in the
     docs or the game due to the fact that it isn't completed yet, etc.

 44. Implemented Lissajous Squares Quit Menu thingy. I did this for the
     following reasons: 1. I wanted to do a really kewl requester. 2. I
     am vaguely planning to play a different piece of music on each
     requester in menu.tex; therefore, I need all the requesters to be
     silent so as not to interfere with the music. 3. Amiga
     color-cycling RULEZ! FEATURES: 1. Looks kewl. 2. 31 colors are
     cycled. 3. Just when you think it is going to shoot off the screen
     it arcs around and comes back. 4. Fast. 5. Smooth. 6.  Infinite
     variety. (Only the first one is the same each time, after that
     they are randomly generated. Zillions of different designs.) 8.
     Utilizes Asm TestPixel, JCSin and JCCos.

 45. Minor touchups on Setup Screen I

 46. Edited description of Reflector.

 47. Replaced "New Game" requester with Lissajous Squares version.

 48. Changed default spell list to 99. Thus anyone playing the demo
     version will definitely see lots of spells that they never get a
     chance to cast.  hehehehe.

 49. Other miscellaneous bugfixes.

 50. Edited docs to include info about the demo version.

 51. Reduced the length of a demo game to 18 turns because I played a
     test game and I won in about 15 turns due to Classic mode giving
     me lots of tough creatures to squash the independents with. (I was
     controlling 2 wizards against 4 generators.)

 52. Ok the game is now working on the 7Mhz 68000 but for some reason
     when you select a team all the checkmarks on setup screen I are
     redrawn. This totally stops the quadrascopes for a second...

 53. BUG: The speech always seems to work during casting phase but it
     seems to only work randomly during movement phase. Hacking more
     changes to Say() in an attempt to make this problem go away.

 54. OK I think I found the speech bug: an intervening use of
     text_store between say() and waitforsay(). Tested and the speech
     is working 100% now.

 55. Made various changes to print what is being said first, then
     actually saying it. Thus you can read what it is saying for the 2
     or 3 seconds that it is saying it.

 56. CHANGED Aerial Servant and Combat to be CLASSIC.

 57. BUG: Spriggan speech doesn't work. Allegedly FIXED by removing the
     "2" from the end of the speech.

 58. Speeded up TestPixel. Saved 4 cycles on 68000 or 2 cycles on 68030.

 59. Put in some checksums for lamer protection.

 60. BUG: Any errors in the early startup phase (e.g. it can't open a
     certain file) result in a crash. NOW FIXED.

 61. CHANGED: the default font for the game to be pearl.font (now
     included in the fonts/ dir.) I did this for 3 main reasons: 1.
     Games which use the standard topaz font always seem "cheap"
     compared to games which use their own custom font. It just somehow
     feels more "commercial" when you play a game with a font different
     than the one you are used to looking at all the time. 2. The
     lowercase i of Topaz sucks. 3. I have tested many, many fonts to
     find the one which is the easiest to read. And pearl is it. I have
     had pearl.font as the default font on my Amiga for several years
     now. It just makes everything easier to read. @{i}Especially@{ui} 640x512
     resolution text which is the resolution that I run everything in.
     I realize that Chaos does not currently use that high a resolution
     but I just tested several fonts a few mins ago against pearl in
     640x256 mode and I could still see the difference.

 62. SMOOTHED out the outlining of the Large font during the intro. The
     outlining used to appear blocky on certain letters. Now the jagged
     edges are rounded off. This has the drawback of almost doubling
     the execution speed of FancyWriteText but the slowness will really
     only be noticeable on the 7 Mhz 68000 and for UAE lamers. Oh
     well.... too bad for them...

 63. STUPID: Computer wizards cast Ball Lightning on a Generator which
     already had 0 combat. NOW FIXED.

 64. STUPID: Computer wizards cast Demonic Touch on other wizards who
     only had 1 combat point. NOW FIXED.

 65. ADDED: Stupidity checking for Shocker.

 66. IMPROVED: Stupidity checking for Archery.

 67. BUG: FLAG_NOWIZARDCELL is broken. Wizards routinely cast spells
     like Subversion and Betrayal, etc. on creatures which have mounted
     wizards. NOW FIXED.

 68. STUPID: My allied wizard just cast a pool far away from himself
     and right up next to his enemy's base camp. FIXED.

 69. STUPID: Wizards sometimes cast Magic Wood trees directly adjacent
     to enemy wizards. FIXED.

 70. LESS THAN INTELLIGENT: Computer wizards only cast castles directly
     adjacent to themselves, they never cast castles across the screen
     to be adjacent to one of their allies. NOW FIXED and totally cool.

 71. MAJOR BUG: I just moved my Aerial Servant onto a Mass Resurrect
     Scroll.  Then somebody justiced my servant and killed it and I
     guess it "reinstated" the scroll. Anyway there is now a weird
     creature whose 3 frames of animation are Lion, Dead Lion, Mass
     Resurrect Scroll. It's stats are totally freaked out with numbers
     like 78 and -78. It eats Hydras, it's Mountable Set 1 and it's a
     flying meditation growth that can attack both living and undead
     creatures. Weird stuff. The mouse thinks it is a Mass Resurrect
     scroll that belongs to me, therefore its movement bit doesn't get
     cleared so I can't click on it and move it. darn. I didn't have
     time to try to mount it. I wonder what would have happened? NOW
     FIXED.

 72. FLAW: I tried to cast my python on a Ghost scroll and it said
     "Cannot cast on Creatures" rather than the more appropriate
     "Cannot cast on Scrolls" FIXED.

 73. BUG: A Faun Scroll just put my Ghoul to sleep! FIXED.

 74. BUG: Dark Powering a snake that is standing on a scroll kills the
     snake and makes the scroll disappear. FIXED.

 75. BUG: snake stands on dead vampire. Justice Snake regenerates a
     living vampire rather than an undead vampire. ERADICATED.

 76. BUG: Play a game with 99 scrolls. Start a new game. After
     ScrollDelay turns NOBODY is awarded jillions of spells from many
     (but not all) blank spaces on the board. Traced this to a problem
     in ClearBoard(); NOW FIXED.

 77. BUG: Generator Scroll just generated a Hydra. This was so
     hilarious that I almost left this bug in the game... oh well, I
     FIXED it.

 78. BUG: I was riding a unicorn and I cast reincarnate on my unicorn.
     I was surrounded by enemy monsters, they killed my unicorn and it
     reincarnated into a spider then they killed the spider and it
     became a beetle then a goblin killed the beetle and stepped onto
     the square! I could still cast spells but I couldn't dismount the
     independent goblin. This goblin also had an identity crisis; each
     turn when I clicked on the "end turn" gadget; this goblin would
     attack independent creatures for me all on its own. But when it
     was the Independent's turn it would act like an independent goblin
     and attack my creatures. I made a small correction to Reinstate()
     and tested it so this is NOW FIXED.

 79. BUG: I killed 5 things with my WoodElf and it sure enough became a
     DreadElf but it belonged to NOBODY! FIXED.

 80. BUG: I killed 7 things with my GreenDragon and it became an
     Emerald Dragon belonging to NOBODY. FIXED.

 81. BUG: I killed 20 things with my RedDragon but it didn't give me a
     Vampire Spell. FIXED.

 82. I got sick of the lameness of C so I invented a new language
     called JC. JC stands for "James' C", "James Conwell" and "GET
     THOSE GAWDAM FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT LAME-ASS BRACES {} OUTTA MY
     FACE!" 8) Have you ever wished C didn't have all those lame curly
     braces? {} Then JC is for you. Have you ever wished C had Array
     Bounds Checking? Then JC is for you. Have you ever wished C would

     Then you are seriously deranged and JC is not for you.  Read the
     readme.txt file for complete information.

 83. All source files upgraded to JC.

 84. BUG: when a creature ends it movement the "Range = X" line of
     WriteNearBottom is not erased. FIXED.

 85. BUG: I was playing a game and there were no indpendents left
     alive. After I went the computer said "INDEPENDENTS" and them
     immediately started making lots of bonus spell noises and stuff.
     This was caused by the awarding of bonus spells from manabatteries
     etc. So there needs to be some sort of notification that the game
     is processing the update phase and is NOT still doing the
     Independent movement. FIXED.

 86. BUG: The Repulsion spell does not repel scrolls properly.
     Sometimes there is a cell which contains nothing while the
     underpart contains the scroll that used to be there. This results
     in NOBODY collecting lots of free scrolls from empty cells. FIXED.

 87. FLAW: Abduction spell abducts artifacts then the artifact owners
     are immediately recalculated in the update phase so the net effect
     is nil. NOW FIXED: Abduction no longer targets artifacts.

 88. BUG: Plasma Beam locked up the game. (oops a misplaced END_IF) NOW
     FIXED.

 89. Put in some simple IFs to reduce the intensity of the background
     color on lissajous squares but this seems to have completely
     stopped the background color cycling 8(

 90. COOL! I FINALLY found the bug in my lissajous background color
     cycler! Now it does more or less what I had intended it to do!

 91. Jerry cast a cat lord and the cat lord immediately cast a Jaguar
     but the Jaguar allegedly never moved (several turns) till Jerry
     killed the Cat Lord. The cats which were already on the board when
     the Cat Lord was cast all worked like they were supposed to. They
     moved around and killed things, etc. Unfortunately I didn't pay
     that much attention to it. I think the Jaguar may simply have been
     sitting by a pool the entire time.

 92. TEMPEST BUG: Jerry cast a Tempest whose Life Force and Recovery
     and Combat kept mysteriously rising. Furthermore, it managed to
     accumulate several Foes Killed every single turn even though it
     never killed anything. And this happened whether it teleported
     something or not. By the end of the game it had 54 Foes
     Vanquished. Ok I have determined that Tempests were "killing"
     every empty cell that they moved onto and they were also "killing"
     every dead body that they were moving onto. Presumably, killing an
     empty cell was its favorite food and that is why its stats were
     raising so high. TEMPEST BUG FIXED.

 93. BUG: Sleeping Tempests could still move. FIXED.

 94. SCROLLING now at priority 50. This fixes the above occaissional
     glitches for nearly all situations.

 95. Put in 3 different MeltScreen effects. There is a problem in
     knowing how to redraw the right hand side of the screen after this
     effect. I don't know how to solve this.

 96. Biohazard now uses the MeltScreen(SINK) effect.

 97. Devastation now uses MeltScreen(SUCK)

 98. WaveScreen effects: You can now make the entire screen wave with
     StartWavyTask (screen, 1); Small numbers mean more radical waving.
     Larger numbers mean very gentle waving. I implemented this as its
     own task because this effect can be used WHILE WE PLAY THE GAME AS
     USUAL. Kewl!

 99. Bless and Haste now utilize the WavyScreen effect.

100. Reduced the probability of Bipedal Generators.

101. FLAW: the 2nd menu strip (CONTROLS: Speech, Sound, Impurities
     etc.) does not highlight correctly. This dates all the way back to
     v1.0 FIXED.

102. FLAW: Something about the game that has always really bothered me
     is that there was no way to know what turn it was. Grrr... When I
     play a long long game I have no idea how many turns I've played. I
     like to know what turn it is so that I know about how many spells
     I have left and because sometimes I play a ridiculously hard game
     just to see how many turns I can survive.  FIXED. The turn # is
     now displayed on the Scores Screen.

103. UPLOADED version 2.3d to Aminet.

Improvements from 2.3 to 2.5
----------------------------

  1. Allegedly fixed menu recoverable error problem. This fix is not to
     my satisfaction and I will try and find a better solution. NOW
     FIXED

  2. CHANGED: The eye-eye powerup now only gives 2 counts instead of 5,
     but its effect can now be accumulated by casting the spell
     multiple times.

  3. Added MOUNTABLE2_STAT to the Shadow Dragon.

  4. Modified the movement and range stats to show the original value
     in red (i.e. like all the others stats) and the current value in
     green. I didn't do anything about recovery for movement.

  5. Added a few new random messages for wizard spell selection.

  6. RENAMED: JCformat.jc to JCformat.c for Unix compatibility.

  7. Modified the info panel so that creatures having the REIN bit set,
     show the number of reincarnations steps remaining in their
     sequence (previously just an `R' was shown).

  8. Input handler upgrade.

  9. Incorporated the editor IDCMP handler into the main game handler,
     thus moving the one step closer to a single IDCMP handler. In
     addition this change shaved 500 bytes on the size of the code
     segment.

 10. Discovered I had accidently deleted the code for the `S' key.
     Reinstated it.

 11. Repaired the Quit option on the initialization screens.

 12. It always seemed like there was something missing from Classic
     Chaos. I just figured out what it was. I have now made Ropers and
     Wasp Nests CLASSIC.

 13. Added in medmod support to music.lib. We can now easily play med
     (MMD0 and MMD1) mods in Chaos.

 14. Added support for the QuadSpectrumAnalyzers into the medmod asm
     code.

 15. Added support for the Quadrascopes into the medmod asm code.

 16. Solved the mystery of converting period into samples per second

 17. Rewrote the quadrascopes to use the RIGHT formula now.

 18. Tested all 6 game musics with the new system and they all work
     WONDERFULLY!

 19. Chaos now officially supports the playback of protracker and MED
     MMD0 and MMD1 mods. If you have a choice then use MMD1. Not that
     it really matters.  I have no idea which routine is faster, all I
     know is that MMD1 mod format is superior to protracker mod format
     due to being able to handle more instruments and being able to
     have multiple songs per file. Hooray for Teijo Kinuunen!

 20. FLAW: Selecting "Load" from Setup Screen I produces some problems
     so I just quickly uncommented it for now. This saved 100 bytes on
     release version. As a general principle I believe that games
     should have a load option on the first main screen. I'll just
     worry about it later because right this second I'm trying to nuke
     as many bugs as fast as possible.

 21. FLAW: exiting from reading a spell description makes a beep. FIXED

 22. James Conwell's 10 Commandments of Game Design. Any game produced
     by James Conwell MUST have the following features: 1. It must have
     an option for more than 1 human participant to play in a game. I
     don't care what kind of game it is. It MUST have at least a
     2-player option. 2. It must have a 1 player option. 3. It should
     have an option for 2 player competitive as well as 2 player
     cooperative. 2 player cooperative mode is VERY important!!!! 4.
     It must have awesome music. 5. It must have a wide variety of
     awesome music, probably including but not neccessarily limited to
     the following: A.  Spooky Music. B. Rave Techno. C. Straight
     Dance. D. Dramatic Music. 6. It must have an intro that can be
     IMMEDIATELY exited at any time. 7. It must make good use of the
     capabilities of the format that it is presented in/on.  8. It must
     be FUN to play. 9. We must go through the game and take out
     everything about it that is annoying and either remove it or make
     it optional. 10. It must have good graphics.

 23. DOUBLE-BUFFERING of rastports/bitmaps implemented for pentagrams
     (finally!). Now they are rock solid, except for during high CPU
     load times (like while downloading from the internet on standard
     serial port) During high cpu load they flicker a bit sometimes. I
     haven't tested it on A500 yet.

 24. ADPCM asm routines upgrade: ADPCM stands for Advanced Delta Pulse
     Code Modulation. It is a lossy compression algorythm which is
     supported by the Zyxel Voice modems and various voicemail
     packages. I intend to use ADPCM audio compression technology to
     reduce the storage requirements of the speech samples of Chaos.
     This is useful for persons such as SAI who have limited hard drive
     space. I do not intend to compress the "sound effects" of the
     game. Only the speech samples because there are going to be
     hundreds of speech samples. The game will soon have about 10 megs
     of uncompressed speech which will be only 2.5 megs compressed.

 25. NOTE about OS compatibility: If the game were ever to require OS
     2.04 or higher (which I assume it will when we make the game
     internet-capable) then we can replace all occurences of CreatePort
     with CreateMsgPort and all occurrences of DeletePort with
     DeleteMsgPort and all occurrences of CreateExtIO with
     CreateIORequest and all occurrences of DeleteExtIO with
     DeleteIORequest then we could stop linking with amiga.lib and
     hopefully save some bytes on the executable filesize.

 26. It would really help if the floppy version could use a fast file
     system floppy. But, alas, that requires OS 2.04 or higher.

 27. Changed wizard names to names that actually mean something to me.
     This makes the game a lot more fun for me.

 28. CHANGED: Bipedal Generators to generate at the same rate as
     Aviaries.

 29. James opens a can of "WHOOP ASS". James guggles down the whole
     thing.  James rewrites line of sight testing to be 9x faster than
     present, 21x faster than it was originally.

 30. Made algorythmic sound effects allocate/deallocate the sound
     channel. Now that it no longer hogs a sound channel at max
     priority I can add ingame music.

 31. CLASSIC: Ogre Mage, Standard Wall, Weak Wall, Rock, Speed and Slow
     are now CLASSIC.

 32. CHANGED: Impurities and Agent Casting can no longer be set using
     the ingame menus. I had to do this to pave the way for the
     internet upgrade. We can only allow the user to change settings
     during the game which do not materially affect gameplay. Things
     which materially affect gameplay must be set @{i}once@{ui} at the beginning
     of the game and then remain unchanged for the duration of that
     game.

 33. Placed Impurities and AgentCasting on setup screen and in savegame
     file.  This means the savegame format has changed so previously
     saved games will no longer load correctly. Tested and verified, I
     loaded an old savegame and the whole game locked up but at least
     the computer didn't crash.

 34. FLAW: (at least I assume this is a flaw). I had a stone giant
     stand on top of a dead stone golem. Each turn the computer players
     would justice or dark power my Stone Giant and it would be
     reinstated as a stone golem. then the next player would justice my
     new stone golem and it would go back to being a Stone Giant. ad
     infinitum. This is caused by the fact that justice and dark power
     leave corpses behind when in previous versions they did not.
     Anyway I changed it so that Justice/DarkPower/Exorcise/etc. do not
     leave corpses behind anymore. FIXED and TESTED.

 35. BUG: C for CAST does not work on the second
     Justice/DarkPower/speed/slow etc. (any multiplicity spell I
     guess.) Strangely, the C key works for Shadow Woods and other
     trees. Ok, I traced this to a problem in the spell files where the
     target of the spell is highlighted with the highlight sprite. The
     C key uses the position of the HighLight Sprite for determination
     of who the caster is. This information was being lost. NOW FIXED
     in every spell file.

 36. The turn number is now displayed on the New Game and Quit Game
     requesters.

 37. Disrupt no longer kills scrolls + I added the following sentence
     to the description: "This spell currently does not affect wizards,
     growths, inanimate objects or scrolls."

 38. various changes to docs.

 39. FLAW: At beginning of Spell Selection phase there is still text
     left over at the bottom from the movement phase. FIXED.

 40. LIST PROCESSING implemented for the sentence generation of what
     wizards say during their spell selection. There are now around 20x
     as many things that they can say without taking 20x the memory.
     It's extremely easy to edit the TalkLists file and add new stuff
     in, you don't even have to recompile! I took this code from a True
     Basic paragraph generator that I made a few years ago. Only I
     didn't bother to translate all the paragraph stuff. Just the
     1-line sentence generation and list processing stuff.

 41. BUG: a computer wizard cast Alliance but then didn't actually cast
     it on anyone. Or at least he didn't get any allies by casting it.
     This has now happened 10 to 12 times. When playing a game with no
     generators the Alliance spell always works. The problem is that
     the computer wizards always try to ally themselves with the
     Independents when independents are available but the spell is
     programmed to fail when applied to an Independent creature. NOW
     FIXED.

 42. ADDED New CastInfo bits: CAST_NOINDEPENDENTS and CAST_NOASLEEP so
     that it it is illegal to cast Alliance on independent or sleeping
     creatures. It is now illegal to cast sleep on sleeping creatures
     too. This will help prevent the computer players from doing stupid
     stuff.

 43. CHANGED: CAST_UNDEAD to CAST_MUSTBEUNDEAD.

 44. BROKEN: Aviaries, Dragon Nests and Bipedal Generators never
     generate anything anymore 8( (at least not when playing with 8
     wizards.) I just played a test game against 8 wizards and 4
     generators and the generators NEVER generated anything. Ok, this
     is because I had AgentCasting turned off. I have NOW FIXED this so
     that even with AgentCasting off, the generator agents still
     generate.

 45. MAJOR BUG: A computer wizard just attacked his own elephant! This
     might be because he was beside it and was "engaged" to it or
     perhaps he tried to mount it? Lucky for him his elephant didn't
     attack him back, it charged toward the nearest enemy instead. The
     bug was in ChooseDestination(). NOW FIXED.

 46. BUG: Computer Wizards keep trying to mount meditations which are
     already occupied. NOW FIXED.

 47. BUG: A computer Wizard just cast Animate on turn 1 and then nothing
     happened. It didn't say what he cast it on. It didn't say he
     aborted it.  OK, he didn't have any inanimate objects so "nothing"
     is exactly what was supposed to happen. I modified isStupidCast to
     check for this. NOW FIXED.

 48. BUG: Computer wizards routinely waste Subversion type spells on
     creatures which are being ridden. I don't know why
     FLAG_NOWIZARDCELL doesn't prevent this from happening. Sleep
     spells are wasted this way too. NOW FIXED.

 49. FLAW: Dark Wood, Speed and Slow spell descriptions do not show how
     many attempts of each you get. FIXED.

 50. BUG: The "Destroy Wall" spell destroys walls but does not reveal
     what the wall was covering. If the wall was covering a scroll or
     artifact or corpse or etc. then it is destroyed. FIXED

 51. BUGS: Boil, Quench and Still all have the same bug as Destroy
     Wall. ALL NOW FIXED.

 52. BUG: I played a game with 99 hidden scrolls and 99 hidden
     artifacts and 2 wizards and the the initial "Repulsion" messed up
     the color pallette of the game. There was a place where the code
     did a return without reloading the original colour pallette. FIXED.

 53. BUG: Animate destroys any item which is under the item being
     morphed.  Corpses, artifacts, scrolls, etc are being destroyed
     this way. FIXED.

 54. BUGS: Alter Reality, MassMorph and Mutate have the same bug as
     Animate. ALL FIXED NOW.

 55. Nuke destroys the entire cell and I left it that way.

 56. BUG: I was player 2. Player 8 killed player 3 and somehow all the
     foes vanquished from the player 3 wizard got put onto my wizard.
     NOW FIXED

 57. BUG: Player 6 just killed my orc with his wizard but it put the
     orc on @{i}my@{ui} wizard's Foes Vanquished. NOW FIXED

 58. Fixed Eye for an Eye, Torment, Nuke, Free, Alter Reality spell
     descriptions.

 59. Scroll Delay now defaults to 0.

 60. BUG: My ally cast Magic Shield on my Basalt Golem yet its Magic
     Resistance is still 0. This happened after most of the other
     wizards had been killed off. ??? I just cast Magic Shield on
     myself on turn 1 of a new game and it had no effect! The recovery
     code was messed up. NOW FIXED.

 61. BUG: Brain Boost doesn't work either! The recovery code was messed
     up. NOW FIXED.

 62. BUG: an organge jelly just grew over my Nightmare (my nightmare is
     not being ridden) and the orange jelly just pirated his Foes
     Vanquished. The entire list of Foes Vanquished for the Nightmare
     is now on the Orange Jelly. NOW FIXED.

 63. BUG: I uncovered the nightmare and it has no Foes Vanquished. It
     doesn't even say "Foes Vanquished 0". Its all one big blank spot.
     NOW FIXED.

 64. I intentionally fixed the above two bugs and 1 part of the reason
     I rewrote the foes vanquished handling was because I was hoping
     that in the process of doing so all the other foes vanquished bugs
     would mysteriously disappear. Well, guess what? That is exactly
     what happened. All the other foes vanquished bugs just
     mysteriously disappeared. ALL FIXED NOW.

 65. BUG: When computer wizard 1 is on the top of the screen and he is
     trying to mount his steed yet is engaged, this triggers enforcer
     hits. Enforcer hits do a DisplayBeep() which is what messes up the
     sound I think. I know that enforcer hits make the sound effects
     sound funny. I think this is because it changes the setting of the
     audio filter. (Enforcer Hits problem was in EngageChoice) NOW
     FIXED!

 66. STUPID: A computer wizard cast demonic touch on a sleeping dragon
     (which was the only enemy creature that he could cast it on).
     FIXED.

 67. STUPID: Actually, after looking at the code I could see that ANY
     spell might potentially be cast on sleeping creatures. I changed
     it so that casting any spell on a sleeping creature is considered
     stupid except for Wake. FIXED.

 68. BUG: A wizard cast Alter Reality on a pegasus being ridden by
     another wizard and the spell failed. I have changed Alter Reality
     so that it can be cast on creatures which are being ridden by the
     wizard. I tested this and it really works! FIXED.

 69. BUG: Sometimes wizards try to cast Kill on a creature which is
     being ridden. The assistance says NOEXPOSEDWIZARD yet the spell is
     programmed to fail if there is a wizard anywhere in the cell. I
     changed this so that the spell now matches its computer assistance
     flags. This means it now succeeds against mounted creatures. FIXED.

 70. FLAW: You can't easily tell when a Subversion/Betrayal/Abduction
     works or not. It now prints "Spell Succeeds!" at the bottom of the
     screen when it succeeds. (It already said "Spell fails" when it
     fails.) NOW FIXED.

 71. INTELLIGENT MAGIC WOOD CASTING implemented: Works great! Wizards
     now cast Magic Woods close to themselves and their allies while
     keeping them as far away as possible from their enemies. However
     any wizard who has " mad", "mad ", ""kalsu", "crazy", "krazy" or
     "insane" in his name will use the random treecasting routine
     instead. This feature is dedicated to Joseph Dixon who said the
     old way of casting trees made the game look stupid 8)

 72. BUG: Team Scores are wrong when several people are on each team.
     Team Life is wrong when several people on each team. The score and
     life of the lowest numbered team is being displayed for their team
     and their score and life are being displayed for the OTHER team.
     NOW FIXED. + the code is a bit more simplified.

 73. INTELLIGENT DarkWood and ShadowWood Casting Implemented. Basically
     the computer wizards try to cast these trees adjacent to lots of
     enemies which are nearby. A small consideration is given to enemy
     generators.

 74. PROBLEM: Every time I am about to win the game I have a bunch of
     creatures closing in on the last enemy wizard. It is now a bit
     harder to kill wizards since they are sometimes surrounded by
     trees which block many of my possible paths of attack and
     shooting. But every time as I am closing in the computer wizard
     will cast a creature to stop me but he always casts it in the
     wrong place (like BEHIND him instead of in FRONT of him). This
     always makes me feel sorry for the poor stupid computer wizards.
     If only he would have cast his dragon IN FRONT of his wizard
     (between his wizard and my dragon) he could have lived for at
     least 1 more turn. The solution is the following: INTELLIGENT
     CREATURE CASTING Implemented. Works great.

 75. BUG: in new IntelligentCreatureCast: Casting a creature while in
     someone else's tree makes the creature become the tree owner's
     instead of the caster's. FIXED.

 76. PROBLEM: I have killed wizards many times on the first turn with
     Ball Lightning and many other times during the game also. In fact,
     lately I've been winning the game in only 12-18 turns. So I have
     now REDUCED Ball Lightning's Life damage from a 10:1 ratio down to
     2:1.

 77. CHANGED: Abath combat from 4 to 8 since the description says that
     it has an enlarged horn which can induce severe bruising.

 78. STUPID: A computer wizard cast reincarnate on his ally's Bolter
     Wall which already had Reincarnate cast on it. FIXED.

 79. STUPID: A computer wizard cast Horror on a creature which already
     had Horror. FIXED.

 80. POSSIBLE BUG: A computer wizard just cast "Free" on a manticore
     that was being ridden by another wizard. The Manticore is now an
     independent and is still being ridden. NOW FIXED.

 81. BUG: Click on an eyeball. Now try to attack an undead creature by
     accident.  Now it says you are engaged even though there are NO
     creatures next to you.  You can't move or do anything but cancel
     your movement. This was found when I tried to attack a Wizard that
     had Liched himself. FIXED by SAI.

 82. Vanished wizards should never be thinking about casting a spell
     because their .Warped bit will be set.

 83. IMPROVED the speech of "Player One", "Player Two" etc.

 84. STUPID: A wizard just cast combat on himself and on the next turn
     he cast Poison Dagger on himself, thus wasting his combat spell!
     FIXED by raising the ranking of Poison Dagger by 4 points to be 1
     point higher than Combat + modified IsStupidCast().

 85. HYBSIL says it fires poisoned arrows. So we made its Ranged Combat
     attack recovery.

 86. CHANGED: WoodElf only needs 4 kills to be promoted to a DreadElf.

 87. Spell selection upgrade.

 88. Moved the Dismount gadget up next the query gadget.

 89. I decreased the delay for messages to stay on the screen during
     computer spell selection. It still seems too long so I will
     shorten it more yet. I think it adds to the atmosphere if you have
     to read quickly, helps gives the impression of action.

 90. Blanked the bottom area of the screen after spell selection.

 91. Fixed a problem with discarding. Now marks a spell used when it is
     first selected so that the player canNOT discard the same spell
     (this was done in a completely different way under the gadget
     scheme).

 92. When spell selection occurs now a blank square is drawn over the
     selected spell. This helps make things clearer especially when
     using the Texas mode.

 93. NEW POWERUP: An orc, goblin, or troll killing an elf, will now
     pick up the bow previously used by the elf.

 94. I just saw the problem where a computer wizard cast sleep on a
     mounted creature. There were no other suitable targets nearby, but
     it still doesn't explain why that spell was selected in the first
     place. NOW FIXED

 95. Fixed the editor so that the spell list is redisplayed when the
     editor exits.

 96. Attempted to fix the problem where the bonus spell selection panel
     is sometimes made bigger than it should be.

 97. Fixed a bug pertaining to computer wizard spell selection that was
     resulting from my earlier changes to spell selection.

 98. I added a routine to do sensible promotions on a cell. Several
     stats now take the max of the original and the new creature. Not
     all of them, so there is still some additional challenges for
     those deliberately going for power ups.

 99. At present the power ups using the new system are: WoodElf ->
     DreadElf (4 kills) Ogre -> Ogre Warrior (5 kills) Ogre Mage ->
     Ogre Assassin (7 kills) Green Dragon -> Emerald Dragon (7 kills)

100. Made the fade twice as fast in Disection spell.

101. Changed that Magic Shield spell, so that casting a shield on a
     creature with maximum MR causes its MR_Recover rate to increase by
     one. Hence by casting lots of shields you can make something @{i}very@{ui}
     magic resistant.  Changed Protection to work the same way.

102. CHANGED BoardEffect so that when the effect is for the entire
     screen no sound is produced (I found things like "cure" were
     getting real annoying because they take several seconds to
     complete). [Note I am talking here about the GREENCIRCLEEX effect
     in cell.c]

103. CHANGED: Hybsil when shooting now affect Man and Recover stats
     making it more consistent with poison as the description says.

104. CONSISTENCY IMPROVEMENT: When you select sound off from the game
     menu it now turns off sound for the independents during both
     movement and casting.  This makes playing against 99 generators
     run considerable faster.

105. PASSAGE: Improved the comment on the Passage spell to reflect that
     fact that a mounted creature or mediation can also make passage.

106. BUG: Computer wizards (when either exposed or mounted) often
     choose not to move. No problem with that. Except sometimes they
     are adjacent to enemies cells and they still don't move. In such
     circumstances it would be logical to at least make an attack OR an
     attempt to move away.

107. Fixed another bug perhaps causing problems with warped wizards.

108. BUG: Place the mouse pointer over a cell or spell on the edge of
     the board.  Now move the mousepointer to off the board and back.
     The display is now blank (it doesn't say what you are pointing
     at). You must first move to ANOTHER cell and then back. This bug
     has been around for a long long time on the board and now it is
     there in the spell list also. NOW FIXED.

109. ADDED some new wizard names.

110. EDITED descriptions of OgreWarrior, Ogre Assassin and Ogre Mage.
     Since the Ogre Mage description says he is trained in the medical
     arts I gave him special combat of -1 against life.

111. Changed Texas Trade'em into Texas Trash'em since you don't trade
     spells in, you trash them (discard them).

112. PROBLEM: when you cast a spell it tells you the range, which isn't
     very useful. I would much rather know the multiplicity so I know
     how many attempts I get with the spell. I've been wanting this
     feature since the first time I played the game years ago; I could
     never remember how many attempts of Justice, Dark Power and the
     various tree spells I was going to get. This made it difficult to
     plan where to cast my trees. NOW FIXED.

113. SHORTCOMING: Q key does not work on the spell list. NOW FIXED.

114. BUG: At the beginning of a person's movement phase there is text
     left over from the previous person's movement. NOW FIXED.

115. NEW SPELLS: Magic Wand and Vodka. Neither have a real graphic yet.
     I won't make any graphics till I implement the graphics upgrade. I
     just had to program these in real quick while I still remembered
     where to put the code fragments that make them work.

116. BUG: Computer players keep casting Demonic touch and then aborting
     it even though there are low-combat creatures nearby! NOW FIXED.

117. REDUCED Thundermare combat to 12.

118. BUG: I just killed a wizard and for my bonus spell I picked the
     Crimson Death. It says its probability is 226% instead of -8% like
     it is supposed to. NOW FIXED.

119. BUG: A sleeping Vortex is moving around the board! NOW FIXED.

120. Vortex description no longer says it leaves a trail of distorted
     space in its wake.

121. NEW FEATURE: The "c" key now works on your spell list! I've been
     wanting this feature for years. Now that I've got it, it is
     totally cool! You can @{i}instantly@{ui} determine all the potential
     targets of any spell in your list.  This is so much easier than
     having to read the 2nd info screen of a spell to see if it is
     allowed to be cast on certain types of things (like growths or
     inanimates or corpses) etc. etc.

122. UPDATED THE DOCS for "c" key and multiplicity.

123. BUGS: The speech for Lich Lord and ShapeChanger doesn't work due
     to a typographical error in the phonetic spelling. All these years
     I thought you had intentionally left out speech for the
     ShapeChanger. Oh well, its NOW FIXED.

124. FIXED the awful pronunciation of "Justice", "Castle", "Confidence",
     "Coercion", Ogre", "Ogre Mage", Ogre Assassin", "Ogre Warrior" and
     "Falcon". Justice had been pronounced "Justayce" for years and
     "Falcon" had been pronounced "Foilcon" for years. NOW FIXED.

125. PROBLEM: the spell manager issues warnings when I put a period at
     the end of a phonetic string. There should not be a warning for
     this. Erroneous warnings are also issued for the chars: ,()? NOW
     FIXED.

126. IMPROVED PRONUNCIATION of ALL SPELLS. I should have done this
     years ago, its so easy. And I only intend to use the algorythmic
     speech for a few more months before I replace it with digitized
     speech. Oh well. There were just sooo many spells which were using
     1 or more wrong phonemes. Certain spells had the correct phonemes
     but had the stress reversed (stress on 2nd syllable when it was
     supposed to be on the first or vice versa.) Almost every single
     spell file has changed now. COMPLETED. I didn't change the speech
     for Goblin Bomb and Hidden Horror so that people can sneakily cast
     them without their opponents noticing. hehehe.

127. PROBLEM: We were playing a multiplayer game. At some point while
     most of us were out of the room somebody moved some stuff around
     on the table by the keyboard. This resulted in a joystick falling
     onto the keyboard and resting on the return key. This made
     everyone end their turn at about 1 second intervals. I know this
     isn't much of a @{i}real@{ui} problem but still... I have now implemented
     End of Turn Confirmation. NOW FIXED.

128. Betrayal, Free and Subversion can no longer be cast on Artifacts.

129. AAAAAAAAAUUUUUGGGGHHHHH!!!! MAJOR BUG!!! I just played a test game
     and I just cast Raise Dead on an enemy wizard. The Enemy wizard
     wasn't dead. He is now MY wizard and he's undead! You can also
     cast Raise Dead on your own wizard to make him suddenly become
     undead! This is all caused because of the lame way of defining
     classes of objects according to the highness or lowness of their
     ID number. Someday I'll go through and eliminate all that stuff
     like I've been wanting to do for years. But for now I'll just hack
     in a quick fix. NOW FIXED.

130. Casting sleep on an artifact puts it to sleep but since its owner
     is calculated right after that, it never says that it belongs to
     ASLEEP. Thus you cannot see if it is asleep or not. If someone
     casts sleep on an artifact that belongs to you it will be
     technically put to sleep (so it will collapse at some point) but
     it will still belong to you and you can still attack with it.

131. REMOVED Temporarily all the ADPCM code from the game since I
     probably won't really use it for a few more months till the
     OS2.04+ version and to save memory on the FINAL 1 meg version.

132. BUG: Sometimes computer controlled wizards attack their ally's
     creatures.  This only applies to computer controlled @{i}wizards@{ui}. The
     Creatures of the wizard don't get engaged to or attack allies,
     only the wizard himself.  Basically computer wizards are trying to
     mount their ally's mountable creatures. The problem was in
     ChooseDestination NOW REWRITTEN AND FIXED.

133. TORMENT description changed to say that it works for several
     "creature casts".

134. TORMENT description changed to say that it affects "all the other
     wizards"

135. COERCION description changed to say that it affects "all the other
     wizards"

136. BUG: Jerry cast Restoration on my cloaked wizard and it
     technically removed the cloak but it never redrew the wizard, so
     for the rest of the game it looked like he was cloaked on the
     board, but in fact was not. NOW FIXED.

137. BUG: Jerry cast "Orcs" while having a Magic Wand so I told him to
     press the "c" key to see where all he could cast his orcs but the
     "c" key didn't work! It doesn't seem to work on any multiplicity
     spells. NOW FIXED.

138. PLAYED 1 test game on 7Mhz 68000. Everything seemed to work ok,
     but the "End Turn" confirmation was too slow. Oh well.

139. Uploaded v2.5d demo version to Aminet. Upload rejected as usual.

140. LOAD/SAVE BUG: If you save a game with wizards in trees then
     reload it there is a MAJOR problem: When the tree collapses the
     wizard is invisible and "he's there but not really there" which
     makes him impossible to kill.  NOW FIXED.

141. MAJOR BUG: highlight ? with mouse then click on some cells. It
     will lock up quite frequently. Usually happens with cells on the
     upper right of the board. BUG NOW FIXED on OS 1.2 / 1.3 by hacking
     in some "IF OS < 1.3 THEN TrapRMB" code.

142. MAJOR BUG: Right Mouse Button on load/save screen under OS 1.3
     locks up the program. This is caused by the fact that the
     requester opens its own window without the TRAPRMB bit set. I
     don't know any way to make the requester open a TRAPRMB window. So
     we need to work around this bug some other way or just require OS
     2.04 or higher. OK, I have simply turned off the MENUVERIFY
     feature for the HiResWindow during the loading and saving screens
     and now it works perfectly under OS 1.3. NOW FIXED.

143. FLAW: A human wizard can no longer attack a tree that is occupied
     by another wizard. It just says "already occupied". I Changed this
     to not attack if the tree is occupied by an ally, otherwise attack
     the tree even if the tree itself is on your team. Ditto for all
     meditations. This change does not affect computer wizards and does
     not allow any of your own creatures to attack your own
     meditations. NOW FIXED.

144. SPEEDED UP: Lissajous box menu thingies.

145. BUG: I move my player 2 wizard into my ally's dark citadel and now
     I can't move him out! He's trapped! This was caused by the the
     fact that the "clear movement bit" code was OUTSIDE the main loop!
     So the MOVED bit was only being cleared after all players had
     moved! Thus I never noticed this since for player 1 (who I usually
     play) the MOVED bit was properly cleared. But for ALL other
     players the MOVED bit was set totally wrong. I went back and
     looked at all the old source code versions on my HD and they all
     have this same bug! ack. NOW FIXED.

146. CHANGED: Killing a generator now allows you to pick from 4 bonus
     spells instead of only 2; thus reflecting the extreme difficulty
     of killing a generator.

147. BUG: Computer wizards cast vodka on artifacts a lot, this
     effectively wastes the vodka spell. I have now simply removed the
     CAST_ARTIFACT from the CastInfo field so this is NOW FIXED.

148. BUG: If you save the game while Tormented, then reload, you
     suddenly have a MagicWand and Vodka powerup. NOW FIXED.

149. BUG: Depth removes line-of-sight requirements but its description
     says it is only supposed to allow unlimited range without changing
     line of sight requirements. This is due to a limitation in the
     spellcasting engine that any spell with max range automatically
     does not require line of sight.  There is currently NO WAY to have
     a spell have unlimited range yet require line of sight. So we need
     to either reduce the range of Depth down to 14 and edit the
     description accordingly, or we need to change the description of
     depth to say that it removes line of sight requirements also. Or we
     could change depth to be that it doesn't change range but it
     removes line of sight requirements. Or ??? OK, here is what I did:
     I changed the Depth description to state that you get unlimited
     range + you don't need line of sight.

150. NEW SPELL: Crystal Ball. This spell removes line of sight
     requirements for all spells.

151. NEW SPELL: Ubiquiscope. The Ubiquiscope is like a combination of
     Crystal Ball + Magic Wand.

152. NEW SPELLS: Fly, Singular Earthbind, Dual Earthbind, Nonarchery,
     Convert, Sword of Sassenrath, Cursed Sword, Mount, No Mount, No
     Grow, The Exorcist.

153. BUG: I vanished wizard 6 and then there was an enforcer hit on his
     turn!  This only happened on the turn IMMEDIATELY after I cast
     vanish on him. It never happened again after that. Ok, this was a
     problem with the game trying to move a wizard who had been warped.
     I have now fixed MoveWizard() to check the .warped bit and exit if
     it is set. NOW FIXED.

154. MODIFIED isStupidCast to prevent casting of Speed and Fly on
     Bolter Walls.

155. NEW FLAG: FLAG_HIGHCR for the Archery and Nonarchery spells so that
     computer wizards will use them more intelligently.

156. BUG: There is something wrong in the movement routine! The
     Exorcist can't move! It says "Cannot attack the living" when
     trying to move into an empty space! There are no other creatures
     nearby. Happened on turn 1. NOW FIXED.

157. BUG: uhmmm.. I've killed every single thing on the board and the
     game isn't ending. NOW FIXED.

158. BUG: uhmmm.. I've killed every single thing on the board and the
     game isn't ending. NOW FIXED.

159. PROBLEM WITH VICTORY CONDITIONS: When playing the game with the
     default settings of 4 generators you sometimes win on the first
     turn without even doing anything! (when the generators don't
     generate anything on turn 1). So I changed it so that to win the
     game you must now either kill or block all independent generators.
     NOW FIXED.

160. PROBLEM: When I select "Save as" I like to save the game with the
     turn number as part of the filename. But then I have to go back
     and check the score panel, then do save as again which is
     annoying. So now I display the turn on the "Save as" panel and the
     "About" panel too. NOW FIXED.

161. When the game ends it now tells you WHY it is ending.

162. UPLOADED v2.5d DEMO version to aminet on Sunday, June 27th, 1999.

Improvements from 2.5 to 2.6
----------------------------

  1. MUSIC is now played during spell-selection phase. I played a
     couple of test games with 6 theme songs installed and it was MUCH
     better than 0 theme songs like we've had in the past but it still
     wasn't nearly enough.

  2. The game feels MUCH more upbeat with the new music!!!!

  3. BUG: When starting a new game the colors on the HiRes part of the
     setup screen are all wrong and it is positioned wrong too. FIXED.

  4. BUG: When starting a new game the colors on the HiRes part of the
     gameboard are wrong. FIXED.

  5. BUG: Several of the new Sidewinder protracker mods won't work with
     the playroutine. They are playing EXTREMELY slowly. I converted
     them to MED MMD1 so this is NOW FIXED.

  6. MODIFIED the game so that if you turn off sound and speech then
     the music plays continuously through the spell-selection,
     spell-casting and movement phases of the game, only changing at
     the beginning of the next turn.

  7. INCLUDED CD advertisement for Sidewinder CDs into the docs.

  8. Color My World Modifications

  9. BUG: sometimes wizards cast Plasma Beam for some strange reason.
     then they always cast it up to the left, even if nothing is there,
     or even if it attacks multiple creatures that they own while not
     hurting any enemies.  Leaving this for SAI to investigate. Fixed
     by JC months later on October 20th, 1999. NOW FIXED.

 10. BUG in protracker play routine. There is a bug in the playroutine
     that causes certain protracker mods to play back incorrectly. It
     sounds like the notes are being played back about 100x too slowly.
     I have no idea how to debug this so I'm just converting the
     affected mods to MED format.  Converted LOTS of protracker mods to
     MED MMD1 format.

 11. NEEDED: Dear SAI, could you please adjust the loading and saving
     such that player 3 can save the game, and then when reloading the
     game it will reload to player 3's spell selection phase? Thanks.
     Implemented by JC in August 1999.

 12. OBSOLETED: EditPopupIDCMP is now handled my the main HandleIDCMP
     routine.  This means that "q" querying etc. now works properly in
     the editor.

 13. Temporarily turned off the end of turn confirmation as I find it
     annoying.

 14. Improved the implementation of the popup creature menus using an
     array of functions.

 15. Fixed a bug in ClearBoard().

 16. End Turn Confirmation is now an option in the menus. Default is
     OFF.

 17. PROBLEM: The "about" screen with the pentagrams hashes sometimes.
     It hashes a lot and looks utterly terrible under heavy CPU load.
     NOW FIXED by increasing the taskpri to 100 during the doublebuffer
     switching.

 18. PROBLEM: The credits scrolling is not 100% smooth and is very
     jerky under heavy CPU load. NOW FIXED by increasing taskpri to 100
     during the doublebuffer switching.

 19. NEGATIVE SCORE BUG: I played a game against JJ and I won but my
     score was negative and his was positive so he claimed he was
     really the winner. In the current version of the game shooting the
     following scrolls gives the following points. Scrolls of creatures
     award as many points as the original life of the real creature.
     moveit -124 Pox shield -125 acid rain -123 devastation -1 touch of
     god -116 ball lightning -114 plasma beam -113 sword of sassenrath
     -118 cursed sword -110 nomount -86. Other scrolls have various
     (mostly HUGE) positive scores associated with them. This is all
     caused by bad subscript errors. Points are awarded according to
     the .Life statistic. But Magic Spells don't have a .Life statistic
     so it just accesses some other data. Made required changes to
     DevastationHandler() also. DONE AND FIXED.

 20. BUG: DeathBringer struck a scroll dead. NOW FIXED.

 21. PROBLEM: We keep getting Emails from NTSC users who don't know how
     to PALboot their Amiga. I added in the AmigaToPAL cli command
     which requires OS 2.04 or higher. Now the game automatically puts
     the computer into pal mode. FIXED.

 22. BUG: Pressing 'q' on the creatures on the alt-o menu thing shows
     the spell description instead of their stats. NOW FIXED.

 23. Spell-List Editor Upgrade 0. Have a seperate spell-list editor
     which is different from the "board editor" 1. Its easy. Just make
     a SpellBoard for storing the spell list onto. DONE. 2. You select
     "Edit Spell List" from the Main Menu. DONE. 3. Figure out where
     the code goes when you select "Edit Spell List" ??? DONE. 4.
     delete copy and paste work exactly the same as in the
     board-editor. DONE. 5. Modify HandleIDCMP + make new menu. DONE. 6.
     Need CopySpellsFromListToBoard(player) (do this once at the
     beginning + anytime the player number is changed) DONE. 7. Need
     CopySpellsFromBoardToList(player) (do this whenever you select
     "quit" or change player number) DONE. 8. Need alt-i for "insert"
     an empty space into the spell-list. DONE. 9. Need alt-d to delete
     just as in the board editor unless it is used on an empty cell in
     which case the empty cell is deleted and all cells to the right
     are scooted 1 space to the left. DONE.

 24. Gamesave Format Upgrade: currentPlayer is now saved. BUG:
     ExorcistID is listed in the translation table twice! FIXED. BUG:
     Probability information was not completely saved. FIXED. BUG: the
     currentSpell was being saved but not translated. FIXED. BUG: When
     you save the game it resets back to player 1's turn. FIXED. BUG:
     When you load a game it resets back to player 1's turn. FIXED.
     REMOVED old stuff that is no longer needed.

 25. BUG: The FavoriteFoodID and RunsAwayFromID is not translated like
     all the other ids. So the first time we add a new spell to the
     game, all our previously designed levels will have creatures with
     messed up tastes and fears. NOW FIXED.

 26. HOPEFULLY I can now do a complete major upgrade or 2 or 3 and not
     have to convert all the old levels up to the new format.

 27. Line of Sight Upgrade. BUG: If you are trying to cast a roper or
     bolter wall etc. along a 45° angle, the "l" key will show that
     you have line of sight but sometimes the "c" key says you don't!
     And when the "c" says you can't cast it there you really can't
     cast it there even though it is in range and you have line of
     sight! This is caused by a problem in isLineOfSight. isLineOfSight
     @{i}SHOULD@{ui} work perfectly but it doesn't. I don't know why. Its like
     it is off by 1 or something. This problem only occurs when there
     are generators adjacent to the 45° path. If you want to
     investigate this mystery then please do so. In the meantime I have
     solved the problem by replacing all occurrences of isLineOfSight C
     code with isLineOfSightQ asm code. NOW FIXED.

 28. SPEEDUP: Computer controlled shooters now decide who they will
     shoot over 2x as fast as before!

 29. SPEEDUP: Computer AI is now MUCH faster than before!

 30. SPEEDUP: "c" key is now over 3x as fast as before!

 31. SPEEDUP: "s" key is now much faster!

 32. BUG: isLineOfSightQ does not automatically return TRUE when the
     source cell is the destination cell. (This prevented me from
     casting Combat on myself) NOW FIXED.

 33. FIXED various bugs with the Mass Ressurrect spell + pox or
     reincarnation or vanquished foes. It was all very broken. NOW
     FIXED.

 34. ALL files 100% cleaned up!

 35. Played a test game. Saved and Loaded multiple times. Everything
     works.

 36. REGISTERED USER on September 17th: a nice chap from Ireland mailed
     in his registration fee. He has an AGA Amiga 1200 tower with Zorro
     IV Busboard, Picasso IV gfx card, 50 Mhz 060, 64 Megs of RAM,
     Power Flyer, etc.

 37. Added Sidewinder to the Scrolling Credits.

 38. Played Sean's Levels 1-4 and 10. Added turns_left to the about
     screen.

 39. Added Registered_Text to hold the registered user's name.

Improvements from 2.6 to 2.7
----------------------------

   Attention Chaos Gamer:

   The latest version of Chaos (2.7) is now available!

   It now features EXPLORATION MODE! This one new feature makes the
game 4x as much fun to play as before!

   When you play with EXPLORATION MODE on, you cannot see any of the
board until you have sent a unit there to map it out. This is just like
Empire or Dune II, etc. It makes the game MUCH more interesting because
you just @{i}have@{ui} to go see what is hidden in @{i}one more square !@{ui}

   You can hear Dragons lurking about in the darkness and breathing
fire, but you can't see what direction they are! AAAAIIIIEEEE!!!!

   The game is now scary once again.

  1. Exploration Mode Upgrade. When exploration mode is on you cannot
     see cells which you have not explored. Once you have explored a
     cell it stays permanently explored, there is no need to maintain
     line-of-sight to the cell. This makes the gameplay nice and
     simple, the way I like it. Most creatures simply explore the cell
     they are in and all adjacent cells. Some creatures, like Eagles
     explore further and can see behind walls due to flying high in the
     air. Other creatures, like snakes, can "feel" the movements of
     other creatures at far distances, thus allowing them to map cells
     which are hidden behind walls that cannot be seen by normal
     creatures. Certain other creatures can hear or smell other
     creatures. This adds the "Explore-the-Map" play mechanic to the
     game. You can't see any cells until you have sent a unit to map
     them. Once mapped the cell remains visible forever even if you
     have no nearby units or no line-of-sight. You can also see the
     cells that your allies can see. But if they stop being your ally
     then you can no longer see those cells. I love games where you
     must explore the level and map it out. Having Exploration Mode
     turned ON makes the game MUCH harder since you have no idea what
     direction you should be going in the early stages of the game. Nor
     do you have any idea what direction you will be attacked from at
     first. Exploration mode makes computer movement more CPU-intensive
     which is why I waited so long to implement it. Now that the game
     is aimed at a 2 meg 020+ amiga it shouldn't be a problem.
     Exploration mode doubles the amount of fun generated by the game
     IMHO. I was going to wait and implement Exploration after I did the
     graphics upgrade but due to my extremely limited time I had to
     reprioritize things and am now implementing the simplest upgrades
     first.

  2. REWROTE Charm, Raise Dead, Mass Ressurrect and Swap spells.

  3. I made all snakes feel out 6 squares. Snakes cannot be felt,
     smelled or heard. Only seen. All living flying creatures don't
     need LOS to see. And most see out 2 squares. Eagle, Falcon and
     Vulture have Excellent eyesight.  Spectator, Achiyalabopa and
     Harpy have poor eyesight. Vulture, Dire Wolf and Arctic Wolf have
     excellent sense of smell.

  4. TESTED OK September 22, 1999: Ok at this point I have never
     actually tested any of the above modifications A-K. So I just set
     PlayerView==1 and ran the game to test out the above changes.
     EVERYTHING WORKS PERFECTLY! Its totally amazing! Geez I must be a
     40th level megacoder! I can explore the map and I can't see the
     enemies, its totally kewl! Well my Vulture (which can see 3 cells)
     and my Pegasus (which can see 2 cells) are totally mapping out the
     board super fast. This has convinced me to reduce the sightranges
     of all flying creatures. Vulture and Eagle will see out 2 squares
     diagonally. All other flying creatures will be set to see only 1
     square out just like the ground creatures (except flying creatures
     don't need LOS so if their sightrange ever gets increased they'll
     be able to see over walls and things.) DONE.

  5. Entering the board editor or spell editor should set
     ExplorationMode=NO and upon exiting it should be returned to its
     former status. DONE.

  6. Modify BoardEffect() to not do the effect on unexplored cells.
     DONE.

  7. Modify Cycle() / Bow weapon. This automatically fixes
     WeaponEffect() and WeaponEffectDrawer(). I intentionally left the
     sound effects in place and only hide the graphics. DONE.

  8. Lightning() will be left as it is because there is no easy way to
     mask it.  If you cast it you reveal your position. DONE.

  9. WizardExplode() will not be masked simply because I like to know
     when an enemy wizard has died, even if he dies in the vast expanse
     of the unexplored regions. DONE.

 10. At beginning of game set playerview to 15 since that will show a
     solid grey board. DONE.

 11. MAJOR PROBLEM WITH REPULSION: The Replusion spell copies cells
     around using board[x]=board[y] style code. But this copies the
     exploration bits to so it ends up exploring areas that you've
     never been too and it looks buggy. Also the clone, hyperclone and
     warp spells use board[x]=board[y] code which means they are
     copying around the exploration bits of players that they are not
     supposed to! ALL FIXED.

 12. FLAW: I was playing a test game in ExplorationMode and I started
     out with Triple, Red Dragon, Replicate, Cloak. So I had 6 red
     dragons, 3 of which were cloaked so I was trying to explore the
     map as fast as possible so I was flying each dragon deep into
     unexplored territory. I clicked on my cloaked dragon and moved him
     deep into an unexplored area and the game made a funny noise and
     my dragon was gone! At first I didn't know what the hell had
     happened. Then I realized that I had flown him into a pit. Poor
     little dragon 8( NOW FIXED with informative text message.

 13. A computer player cast Vengeance on wizard 1 while it was on
     wizard 2's view and it showed the spunge effect on the unexplored
     cell! Wrong. Its not supposed to do that! Modified SpungeColour()
     to use MaskWritePixel() NOW FIXED DONE

 14. The Following spells need to be investigated/modified to call
     ExploreCell() in an appropriate manner: Repulsion, Replicate,
     Simulacrum, HyperClone, Teleport, The time when any creature warps
     back in to the board, Turmoil, Vortex, Tempest, Roper
     teleportation, GrowthRoutine, Horror, Passsage. ALL DONE.

 15. BUG: Any creature with e.g. sqSightRange of 32 and
     SightRequiresLOS==YES can't actually see that far because the
     close-up unexplored cells block LOS to the further away unexplored
     cells therefore: ExploreCell() must be modified to sort all the
     cells on the board into ascending order of distance from the
     observer. Then this sorted list of cells will be used instead of
     just going through the cells from 0 to 239. NOW FIXED AND DONE.

 16. Speed up the "derive Cell from pixel coords" code in
     MaskWritePixel by using my LSRCellHeightShiftBitMultGAMECOL[y]
     technique from cell.c. DONE

 17. Modify all Numeric keypresses to check that the cell is really
     visible to the current PlayerView before highlighting it.

 18. Added a new CAST_NOTONUNEXPLORED or CAST_EXPLOREDONLY bit to
     certain spells such as Vengeance, Dark Power, Justice, Armour,
     Cursed Sword, etc. Also add "Cannot cast on unexplored cell" to
     the 2nd info panel of the spell information thing.

 19. PROBLEM: Pressing the 'l' key on a blank cell only highlights that
     cell and the 8 adjacent cells because the owner of that cell
     (NOBODY) has not explored any cells. I put some special code in
     AutoFail() so now the 'l' key works like it always did. NOW FIXED.

 20. Added CAST_NOTONUNEXPLORED to the spellinfo screen. DONE.

 21. Added SightRange, FeelRange, SmellRange and HearRange to creature
     info panel 2nd screen. DONE.

 22. Changed the Ghost and Drelb so they can't be felt or smelled. DONE.

 23. 4 NEW SPELLS: Cartography, Alternography, Seismology, Telescope.
     Alternography majorly kicks ass!

 24. After adding the new spells I loaded up the old levels to see if
     they still worked and ... THEY DO! 8)

 25. CANCELLED: The Play by Email upgrade has been CANCELLED until
     someone registers the game who has a netconnected Amiga.

 26. BUG: When loading a game, probabilities are all messed up on the
     info screen!  NOW FIXED.

 27. UPGRADED All SAI's Levels to the new format successfully.

 28. YUCK! Some color combos in the credits intro are terrible. I have
     made a better color combo for the bright red text. DONE.

 29. FLAW: When a Bolter Wall is the last computer controlled thing to
     move it stays highlighted well into the next phase of the game.
     Way longer than it is supposed to. NOW FIXED.

 30. I tried to duplicate the "Kill your own wizard and get an enforcer
     hit" bug but every time I kill my own wizard there is no enforcer
     hit. ???

 31. DOUBLED the speed of ClearBoard();

 32. PROBLEM: It takes me forever to find the spell I want when I'm
     designing levels and testing things. SOLUTION: Alphabetized the
     list of objects in the alt-o object chooser menu. DONE. SOLVED.

 33. DARK WOOD INCONGRUENCY: The description says they are undead but
     their undead_stat is not set. NOW FIXED.

 34. AAUUGH! I cast animate on an independent generator and nothing
     happened! I have now changed the spell description to say "This
     spell has no effect on generators." FIXED.

 35. DAMMIT I WAS GOING TO WIN AND THIS STUPID MudMan thing with 0
     maneuverability just moved next to my wizard and killed him even
     though he should have been engaged to my zombie!!!!! Engagement
     routine needs to be investigated!

 36. ENGAGEMENT ROUTINE FIXED: The routine now works like this: If you
     are next to 1 enemy creature THEN If you have 0 maneuverability
     you are ENGAGED. If you have 15 maneuverability you are NOT
     ENGAGED. If you have 1 maneuverability you have 1 chance in 15 of
     not being engaged. If you have 2 maneuverability you have 2
     chances in 15 of not being engaged. The engagement system is now
     totally logical and easy to understand.

 37. PROBLEM: You can't install Chaos to your HD by simply dragging the
     drawer icon to the HD because the req.library must also be copied
     to the LIBS: I have now changed it so that it will open the
     library from LIBS: or from the libs/ dir in the chaos dir so now
     the game is SUPER EASY TO INSTALL!!! NOW FIXED.

 38. 4 NEW SPELLS: Stone to Flesh, Inanimorphobiosis, Flesh to Stone,
     Mass Petrification.

 39. I went back and modified most of my spells to use implode cell
     effect for when something bad is happening to the recipient and
     implode+explode cell effect for when something good is happening
     to the recipient. DONE.

 40. SOUND EFFECTS fully reinstated in ExplorationMode. I have decided
     that I like to hear all the sound effects of events that happen in
     unexplored areas so I modified CellEffect() to only mask the gfx
     in unexplored areas NOT the sound effects. DONE.

 41. BUG: Intro credits monster list sometimes has messed up colors.
     NOW FIXED.

 42. SPEEDED up the intro credits a bit.

 43. VODKA changed to allow you to cast it on the independents. Now the
     spell is actually useful for something :)

 44. CAST_ARTIFACT added to spell information screen.

 45. CHANGED SWAP: to not swap inanimate objects.

 46. Bazillions of bugs which only had a 1 in a million chance of
     happening have been FIXED.

 47. ALL of those annoying things have been removed such as: Wizard's
     Names no longer constantly reset. End Turn Confirmation is now
     optional. You can now save the game on ANY player's turn and it
     works as it should.

 48. 7x as much music! And 7x as good too!

 49. Codex Sirconia.

 50. Plasma Beam Bug FIXED!

 51. Better Computer Artificial Intelligence!

 52. NEW optimizations to save memory!

 53. BETTER Screen handling for users with OS 3.0 and higher!

 54. ENGAGEMENT routine fixed! I don't know if you ever noticed this or
     not but once in a blue moon a creature with 0 maneuverability
     adjacent to an enemy creature would NOT be engaged! THIS IS NOW
     FIXED.

 55. SPEEDUP: Computer AI is now MUCH faster than before!

 56. NEGATIVE score bug fixed!

 57. NEW SPELLS: Crystal Ball, Ubiquiscope, Fly, Singular Earthbind,
     Dual Earthbind, Nonarchery, Convert, Sword of Sassenrath, Cursed
     Sword, Mount, NoMount, NoGrow, The Exorcist, Cartography,
     Alternography, Seismology, Telescope, Stone to Flesh,
     Inanimorphobiosis, Flesh to Stone, Mass Petrification, Brain Drain
     Beam, Demonic Touch Beam, Combat Drain Beam, Range Drain Beam,
     Recover Drain Beam, Lethargy Beam, Paralyzation Beam, Life Drain
     Beam, Toxicity Beam, Encumberance Beam, Sluggishness Beam.

 58. COUNTLESS other bugfixes!

 59. NUMEROUS other minor improvements!

 60. Vodka and Magic Wand now have a real graphic!

 61. 11 Custom Designed Levels! These levels are NOT random. They were
     designed in a special way by actual sadistic, depraved, evil Human
     Beings. Can you battle your way through them in less turns that
     the game designers? Can you even survive in them for more than 12
     turns? Find out how good a wizard you REALLY are.

 62. We have received complaints from AES and others about the game
     using 2 seperate screens because they typically run lots of
     programs and flip between them a lot so sometimes the screens get
     out-of-order. I have now (finally) dug up the information on
     attached (parent/child/family) screens and OS 3.0 is REALLY
     AWESOME!! OS 3.0 screen handling is vastly superior to OS 2.04!
     The use of attached screens also allows me to have as many screens
     open as I want without annoying anyone. All unused screens will be
     hidden.  This is going to be really kewl.

 63. AGA DETECTION code added. Now we can display different graphics
     depending on if the game is running on AGA or ECS.

 64. 64 bit alignment of screen memory implemented. This allows the
     entire computer to run faster when playing the game on AGA Amigas
     because the display will be running at 4x bandwidth.

 65. DEFAULTS CHANGED to start with 1 human vs 1 computer wizard + 4
     generators.

 66. SCREWEY QUIT BUG FINALLY SOLVED!!!!

 67. BUG: Vodka has no effect on Independents. NOW FIXED.

 68. BUG: Agents cast harmful spells against their friends and allies.
     Allegedly NOW FIXED.

 69. BUG: COMPUTER WIZARDS ALWAYS CAST PLASMABEAM STUPIDLY: NOW FIXED.

 70. I also modified the PlasmaBeamHandler and stupidity checking to be
     compatible with AgentCasting. DONE.

 71. WROTE a new PlasmaBeamRanking() routine so the computer wizards
     will try to cast it under the most favorable circumstances.

 72. FLAW: PlasmaBeamHandler always converts illegal coordinates into a
     cell with GetCell(). NOW FIXED.

 73. uhmmm there were major problems in the spellcasting AI...
     IsStupidCast() was assuming that the spell was being cast from the
     WIZARD's cell thus it couldn't possibly have worked with
     AgentCasting. Maybe this explains why agents cast sleep on
     friendly creatures? NOW FIXED.

 74. MAJOR BUGs in IntelligentComputerSpellSelect() and other routines.
     NOW FIXED.

 75. MAJOR BUG in IsStupidCast() All CAST_FREE spells were being
     handled all wrong. This was totally messing up the computer's
     thinking. CAST_FREE spells were routinely being regarded as
     REALLY_STUPID(-3) when in fact they were the best and most usefull
     spell possible. NOW FIXED.

 76. ADDED stupidity checking for Alternography.

 77. ExplorationMode option now on setup screen II.

 78. BUG: Patrick Hawkins reports: If the talklists file is not present
     then an alert is generated telling you it isn't there. Then the
     whole computer crashes. BUG: Kermit reports: If you don't have
     narrator.device then an alert is generated saying "Could not open
     narrator.device" then the whole computer crashes. BUG: James
     Conwell reports: If ANYTHING goes wrong in CommenceChaos(), a file
     is not found, a library can't be opened, a device is missing, etc.
     then a nice alert is generated telling you such. Then the entire
     computer ALWAYS crashes. ALL FIXED NOW.

 79. FIXED memory leaks.

 80. FIXED Semaphore bugs.

 81. PROBLEM: Casting Stone to Flesh or Inanimorphobiosis on a wall
     gives you a wall which can be moved but it can't actually attack
     anything. I changed it so that it will always be able to attack
     the living and if the inanimate object was undead then it will
     also be able to attack undeads. NOW FIXED.

 82. 11 NEW SPELLS: Brain Drain Beam, Demonic Touch Beam, Combat Drain
     Beam, Range Drain Beam, Recover Drain Beam, Lethargy Beam,
     Paralyzation Beam, Life Drain Beam, Toxicity Beam, Encumberance
     Beam, Sluggishness Beam. These spells do not affect corpses or
     scrolls. Each spell has its own AI routine.

 83. BUG! Combat, Maneuverability, Ranged Combat and Special Combat
     recovery/ poisoning don't work right!!! NOW FIXED.

 84. The holder of the Sword of Sassenrath makes his nearby friends more
     intelligent. DONE.

 85. Codex Sirconia Upgrade Several small corrections made.

 86. Problem: There is no explanation of Summoning, only of
     Subjugation. 7 new paragraphs added. NOW FIXED.

 87. Problem: There is no explanation of how the world can exist in a
     2-dimensional state and yet flying creatures can "fly" "over" other
     objects. 2 paragraphs added. NOW FIXED.

 88. Still need to come up with some sort of explanation for undeads
     and why they can't be attacked. ??? Added 1 more paragraph.

 89. NEW SECTION: "The Folly of Man" to explain generators. 10
     paragraphs.

 90. Put in all of SAI's new spell graphics into the game.

  3. Chaos v2.71 FINALIZED. This is the final OS 1.2 1.3 2.04
     compatible version of Chaos. All future versions require OS 3.0 or
     higher.

Improvements from 2.71 to 2.81
------------------------------

  1. REQUIRES OS 3.0 ROM or higher.

  2. Enhanced Information Panels with MUCH better graphics.

  3. Enhanced Score Screen with MUCH better graphics.

  4. Music OFF feature.

  5. ExplorationMode spells don't appear in non exploration games.

  6. ExplorationMode spells DO appear in non exploration games IF Texas
     Trash'em is activated, thus you can throw them away.

  7. Several things can now be cast on dead bodies. (like Ropers and
     Wasp Nests).

  8. Miscellaneous changes.

  9. New Arcing Weapon Effect for archers.

 10. 13 new creatures. Most have very special capabilities.

 11. 7 New creature powers: Oracle, Eidetic Memory, Recognize Creatures,
     Recognize Growths, Recognize Inanimates, Recognize Spells, Ibrowse
     (mind reading)

 12. Enhanced Info Panel capabilities. If you own any creature with
     perfect Eidetic Memory then you will always "remember" what is
     under any given square on the board. You will be able to see what
     is under any square on your info panel. Current Creatures with
     perfect Eidetic Memory are: Elephant, Memory Master, Memory Mage.

 13. Enhanced Scroll Panel capabilities. If you own an Omnibiologist or
     Recognomancer you can view the stats of a creature before you cast
     it. If you own an Inanimatologist or Inanimage or Recognomancer
     you can view the stats of inanimate objects before you cast them.
     If you own Mullac De Irvine or Recognomancer you can view the
     stats of growths before you cast them.

 14. Enhanced Bonus Spell Selection capabilities. The above creatures
     assist you in making your bonus spell selections.

 15. Bonus Spell Selection now prints the name of the spell you are
     pointing at (if you have the appropriate .recognize powerup) at
     the bottom of the screen.

 16. Computer controlled Creatures who have healing attacks no longer
     attack their enemies.

 17. Humans can now attack their own creatures if such an attack would
     heal the creature.

 18. 2 New Creature Characteristics: Exophagy and Scavenging.

 19. 4 new magic spells.

 20. 2 new inanimate objects.

 21. Numerous small bugs fixed.

 22. Numerous creatures are now scavengers.

 23. New music for scavenging and artifact changing.

 25. All memory leaks fixed.

 26. 3 new Chaos Theme Songs. Including "Are you ready to move?"

 27. 50+ new digital sound effects!

 28. If a creature does not yet have a sound effect, it is easy to add
     one yourself!

 29. If you don't like a certain sound effect, it is easy to change it
     yourself!

 30. Necroptence bug fixed!

 31. Turmoil bug fixed!

 32. Wizard kills magic tree and disappears bug fixed!

 33. Computer wizards no longer cast Restoration on their cloaked
     creatures.

 34. AUTOSAVE FEATURE IMPLEMENTED: This feature defaults to ON. It will
     save the game automatically on EACH human wizard's turn. Each save
     is done into a different filename. Example filename
     "004p8AutoSave.lha". This means that this is the savefile for turn
     004, player 8's turn. The turn number is first so that the files
     will list in numerical order in the filerequester.  >From now on
     if you find a horrible bug that crashes the machine or something
     you can ALWAYS go back to your last saved position (Because it is
     saved automatically). You can then replay the turn over and over
     again to figure out exactly what it is that is triggering the bug.
     This should greatly benefit playtesters the world over.

 35. IMPLEMENTED all of Frédéric's spell-description
     corrections/clarifications for all spells beginning with the
     letters A-E.

 36. BUG: Disrupt drains the intelligence of creatures which are your
     allies.  NOW FIXED.

 37. CHANGED: Disrupt now also drains the intelligence of enemy wizards.

Improvements from 2.81 to 2.82
------------------------------

  1. IMPLEMENTED all of Frédéric's spell-description
     corrections/clarifications for all spells beginning with the
     letters F to Z. Including complete rewrites of Magic Attack, Magic
     Bolt, Ice Breath, Lightning, X-Ray and Fireball. DONE.

  2. CHANGED Pythons so they attack Life Force + Manuverability.

  3. ADDED a new "Language" menu option with English, Français,
     Hungarian, Deutsch, Español and Italiano options. All options are
     mutually exclusive.

  4. ADDED some text to print when a promotion happens.

  5. ADDED some text to print when an Orc/Goblin/Troll gets a bow.

  6. ADDED some text to print when the game is AutoSaving.

  7. Range Boost didn't work on a Wizard with a Magic Bow. NOW FIXED.

  8. JJ doesn't like the digital sound effects and wants a "Combat
     Sounds" on/off feature. This took me 2 hours. 1 hour to do it and
     and 1 hour to debug it due to lame C STUPIDITY. I wrote IF
     (MENUCombatSound) and the compiler generated NO ERRORS! But there
     is no variable called MENUCombatSound!!!!! And it didn't call the
     FUNCTION MENUCombatSound() either! It just always evaluated the
     nonexistent variable as TRUE so the sounds were ALWAYS ON no
     matter what I did. NOW FIXED.

  9. INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE SUPPORT ADDED! (Only for Spell
     Descriptions) IT WORKS GREAT! Currently the only languages
     supported are English, Français and Hungarian. The font still
     needs to be edited to contain accented characters, this is
     Frédéric's department.

 10. ELIMINATED all those stupid spell+1 and spell- and spell+=1
     constructs from SpellInformation().  This was all caused by
     PoolPos requiring a spellnumber-1 instead of a real spellnumber!
     NOW ALL FIXED!

 11. ENFORCER HIT BUG! Selecting "Scores" from the Menu somehow
     corrupts the value of the Global Variable "Language" and sets it
     to 8. Then anything that uses the Language variable to access an
     array triggers off enforcer hits. Hmmm... this was all caused by a
     missing break; after a END_SWITCH. I guess most END_SWITCH
     statements need a break; after them.

 12. Wolverines now scavenge +3.

 13. Achiyalabopa now needs LOS for its sight range due to the fact
     that it is "low-flying".

Improvements from 2.82 to 2.83
------------------------------

  1. Hidden Horror + Reincarnation Bug Report by Frédéric: I had cast
     reincarnation on my hidden horror so as to get a golden dragon
     when it came close to that combat-enhanced enemy wizard (like this
     is said in the hidden horror description), but I only got a red
     dragon. NOW FIXED.

  2. Added in some code to read in all the catalog files.

  3. REPLACED most of the text in the game with an appropriate call to
     Message() which gives the correctly translated string according to
     the currently selected language.

  4. PROOFREAD, corrected & edited Frédéric's new doc sections on
     creature statistics and spell statistics.

  5. Catalog translation problems: 1: French grammar is backwards when
     compared with English grammar so my catalogs are useles. But the
     solution is VERY easy, simply make use of the new sprintf() (or
     related) routine in the Amiga OS that allows the translator to
     switch the orders of the parameters around using positional
     notation such as %1$s %2$s %3$ld.  New Tsprintf routine is simply
     an asm routine that calls RawDoFmt() with a function parameter to
     store the chars in a buffer. WHY OH WHY doesn't RawDoFmt() default
     to sprintf string-storing when supplied with a NULL function
     parameter? This asm routine came straight out of the RKRM example
     listed under RawDoFmt() This should solve all the @{i}current@{ui}
     translation problems. Other translation problems will be dealt
     with later.

  6. I went through and added numeric positioning information to EVERY
     string that had more than 1 parameter.

  7. I basically copied the prototype from sprintf() in stdio.h to use
     as the prototype for Tsprintf(). Though first I compiled the game
     as a test with no prototype for Tsprintf() and no warnings or
     errors were generated! I assumed the game would just crash so I
     didn't try to play it like that till added the prototype and did
     smake clean smake.

  8. Decide how to handle spellnames? Why not handle it exactly the
     same as I handle Message(); ? Yes, exactly like I handle Message,
     excellent. Ok, but how do I read them in? If I could somehow make
     a list of all English spellnames. This is easy. duh. I have a list
     of all English spellnames. Its built into the game! This is all
     useless! I need French names of OBJECTS in the game, not french
     names of english names.  Now go through each name in the this list
     and open up that filename in each language/ dir and dig out the
     language/ version of it and put it into an array! Easy! DONE.

  9. Make a CreatureName() macro that returns the creature_name of the
     creature in the currently selected language. DONE.

 10. Go through the entire game and replace all appropriate occurrences
     of creature_name[x] with CreatureName(x) except the ones in
     editor.c. I'll worry about that later. Certain occurrences of
     creature_name[x] specifically must NOT be replaced because they
     are dealing with files (sound files, text files, etc.) and those
     files must always be named according to their english name. DONE.

 11. Check the date of the LanguageSpellnames.txt against the date of
     the dir Language/  If the dir is newer then it means something has
     changed and the text files must be rebuilt.  So if the Language/
     dir is newer than the LanguageSpellnames.txt file or the
     EnglishSpellnames.txt file or the English/ dir then it must be
     rebuilt.  Additionally, if the English .txt file  gets rebuilt
     then they must ALL get rebuilt because it might mean some new
     spells have been added.

 12. PROBLEM: It takes several seconds to open/read/close the 350 files
     required to read in the translated spellnames. (And its only doing
     Français now!  That will be over a whole minute when all
     languages are done.) So I optimized it such that the list only
     needs to be rebuilt if someone has changed something in one of the
     descriptions.  NOW FIXED.

 13. TRANSLATED SPELLNAMES ARE NOW FULLY FUNCTIONAL.

 14. Changed "Hungarian" -> "Magyar".

 15. June 17, 2000: Received Frédéric's registration. He is now
     inducted as a junior member of Team Chaos and assumes all
     privileges and resposonsibilities associated therewith. He is also
     Chief Executive Vice President in Charge of Français Translation,
     Français Font Editing and also English and Français AmigaGuide
     Electronic Hypertext Documentation.

 16. Saturday, June 17th, 2000: I loaded my very first IFF graphic file
     into t he game and displayed it. AMAZING! All these years I've
     never once loaded a graphics file into one of my programs! Though
     I have loaded IFF sound files for many many years.

 17. FD: Saving does not work ! I launched Chaos from the shell and got
     messages like c/lha: unknown option - 3 each time the game tried
     to save the current game (either autosave or requested save). I've
     finally found why lha complains about the -3 option: it was in my
     ENV:LHAOPTS file, to automatically select the best compression
     algorythm. However, the old lha version supplied with chaos does
     not know of this option. The ideal solution would be that you use
     the -I option when you call lha from Chaos, this will cause lha to
     ignore the LHAOPTS environment variable. JC: Ok, I changed lha to
     use -qaI when being called from Chaos. NOW FIXED.

 18. FD: I cast abduction and it abducted a poison dagger scroll ! And
     it did reveal itself as I was trying exploration mode :-) JC: NOW
     FIXED

 19. FD: The proportionnal font you use in the info screens does not
     know of accented letters !! This makes french descriptions for
     spells totally unreadable ! For example "Dévastation" becomes
     "Dvastation" ! JC: I know all about this. You are in charge of
     translation so you are supposed to fix this.

 20. FD: The special combat ability provided by Aesculapius does not
     target anything ! I think special combat should have a default
     stat target even if the creature has no special combat at all
     (like range combat). Moreover this special combat targets my own
     creatures too ! JC: This was a simple problem of not enclosing my
     #define in () NOW FIXED. Aesculapius no longer gives people
     Special Combat.

 21. FD: "Independent vulture eats some brown bear cadaver. Life +d"
     Seems the %d thing does not work. JC: This is a problem with that
     stupid OS sprintf not working with long parameters. It only works
     with words! It has already caused me many many problems and this
     is the whole reason why it took me soooo long to do the
     translation coding. Anyway this particular sentence is NOW FIXED.

 22. FD: I've found another minor bug: when I cast alternography and
     restart the game, the alternography is not reset and remains
     active. JC: NOW FIXED

 23. FD: "Asleep's wizard munches on some manticore's cadaver. Life +d."
     Asleep's wizard ??? This should not exist (it is not a fake
     wizard)!  Moreover, asleep creatures should not eat anymore ! JC:
     Well, there was a bug whereby any scavenger that was asleep or
     dead or a scroll would still scavenge any dead bodies that it was
     on top of. NOW FIXED.

 24. FD: Providing someone with a telescope does not increase his
     mapping of his own position in the world until he moves. Too bad
     if that creature is engaged. Maybe the telescope spell should
     update the explored cell for the recipient creature. This update
     should also happen when a creature blocking line of sight moves,
     revealing some parts of the world. Maybe a good place to do this
     is board update. Reply from JC: 1: Its a rule: if you are engaged
     then you can't map the world. You are too busy defending yourself
     to have time to draw maps. 2: Furthermore its a rule that if your
     creature doesn't move then it doesn't map anything. Thus, a
     creature that never moves will never map anything. 3: I have been
     thinking of changing the Telescope and Seismology spells such that
     they give results immediately upon casting. Since you asked for
     this I went ahead and implemented it. So from now on if you cast
     Telescope or Seismology you will IMMEDIATELY (in the casting
     phase) map new areas.

 25. FIXED description of Solar.

 26. CHANGED: Aesculapius scrolls are now always buried.

 27. CHANGED: Touch of God, Chaos Lord, Iridium Horse and Aesculapius
     scrolls are now only 1/3 as probable as other scrolls.

Improvements from 2.83 to 2.84
------------------------------

  1. CHANGED Cartography to immediately explore the cells during the
     casting phase in the same way that I already changed Telescope and
     Seismology.

  2. INSTALLED the new ChaosCalligraphy.font which has been modified by
     Frédéric to include (all?) international characters of Western
     European alphabets.  Most notably ¿¡ñÑ éèêëæ ÉÈÊËÆ
     çÇ etc.

  3. FD: I cast betrayal on a bolter wall and it said the spell
     succeeded. But the bolter wall still belonged to the same player.
     JC: This has always been possible. If Betrayal succeeds then a new
     player is randomly chosen. In your case it randomly chose the same
     player as before. I have now changed it so that if the spell
     succeeds then the target WILL change owners. NOW FIXED.

  4. FD: Sometimes the old EndOfTurn sound is played at the end of a
     turn, instead of the sound from file "EndTurn.8svx". I did not
     find a condition for this to happen. JC: This happened only when
     someone had previously cast Move It. NOW FIXED.

  5. FD: When I begin a game in exploration mode (as player 1 or 8,
     never mind), the position of player 3 is shown to me before
     disappearing again. ? JC: This one took me a while to figure out.
     In the beginning of the game I changed the PlayerView to 15 so
     that way absolutely nothing would be shown since there is no
     player 15. But the Team[] only has 12 elements! (0-11) so Team[15]
     was actually accessing into TeamSettings[3] (which keeps a backup
     copy of the team settings so that alliances and seperations don't
     mess up the setup screen) Of course TeamSettings[3] is going to
     equal 3 unless you change the Teams on the setup screen. So the
     game thought that player 15 was on Team 3 and thus would show you
     player 3's position at the start of the game. So how do I fix
     this? A: Expand the Team[] and TeamSettings[] array. This requires
     a change to the savegame format and I would have to convert all
     the old levels to the new format. B: I could just not change the
     view to be 15 at the beginning. I could change it to the 1st human
     player, (since he will get the 1st real view anyway) or I could
     change it to the DEADP player. Option B is easiest. I will just
     change the view to the DEADP player. This will work perfectly
     until the game starts randomly distributing dead bodies across the
     map at the beginning of the game. This will probably never happen
     so it should never be an issue. NOW FIXED

  6. FD: I cast the cat lord, and I had already a lion. I was able to
     control the lion and attack a harpy with it. Then, after I clicked
     end-of-turn, the cat lord controlled the lion and attacked the
     harpy again. NOW FIXED.

  7. FD: A wizard has scavengerism but he's cloaked and the sentence
     say he is a wizard munching on some brown bear carcass. I think it
     should say "cloaked creature" instead of wizard. NOW FIXED.

  8. FD: A leopard corpse mewed when it was destroyed by a fireball !
     Corpses really shouldn't make any sound :-) NOW FIXED.

  9. FD: I'm able to control the solar and make it attack before it
     attacks on his own ! NOW FIXED.

 10. HORRIBLE LOCKUP BUG WITH "Repulsion" sound. FD: Sometimes the game
     locks up and makes the Repulsion sound. JC: This same bug was
     reported by JJ several times over the last few months but the
     details were so sketchy that I had no way to track it down and fix
     it. 10 days later after countless hours of playtesting by
     Frédéric using the JC modified version of Chaos which generates
     logfiles of its actions, I was finally able to track down this
     horrible bug!! What the actual bug was: Basic Explanation:
     Anything that caused the TELEPORTIN or TELEPORTOUT cell effects to
     be used would lock up in an infinite loop making sound. Since a
     simple sound played in a loop is what the "Repulsion" sound is,
     this sounds very similar to the Repulsion spell sound. Specific
     Explanation: IF you were playing in exploration mode and any of
     the following things happened then the game would lock up. A) A
     roper teleported to a new location. B) A creature changed sides
     due to impurities. C) Any Wizard used the Passage spell. D) Any
     Wizard used the Teleport spell. E) Any wizard cast Pyrotechnics or
     Storm and it actually hit a creature. F) Any Haunt spontaneously
     changed sides. G) Any Wizard cast the Pox spell on something. NOW
     FIXED!!! So the reason the lockup bug seemed to only happen when
     you played with lots of enemy wizards and with growths on the
     screen was because, the more stuff on the board, the more of a
     chance of Impurities cause an alleigance change.

 11. BUG: When I'm in alliance with another wizard, I can see the
     regions he has explored. However, when a creature is moving in
     these regions, it is not highlighted.  JC: This bug was a simple
     typographical error in the code.  NOW FIXED.

 12. FD: About the bug in inamorphobiosis you fixed. I thought the same
     problem could arise when a wizard mounts a cat (lion, jaguar etc)
     thanks to "Mount" and another player casts the cat lord. Did you
     consider this case ? JC: I just changed it so that Cat Lords
     cannot take control of mounted cats. NOW FIXED.

 13. FD: After Joker, I got "Wizard 7" on my list ! Is this normal ?
     JC: Well, the way Sean programmed it, it could give you any spell,
     even spells with 0 probability. I have now changed it so that it
     will not give you spells of 0 probability. NOW FIXED.

 14. FD: I had triple in effect and my marid cast violet fungi. It
     logically cast it three times, but all at the same place, one on
     another. This should be considered stupid ! JC: NOW FIXED.

 15. FD: I first got Burstroem's Browser today. I cast it and began to
     peek at other wizards spell lists. When I play with Texas
     Trash'em, I can peek at others spell list when I have already
     picked a spell to cast and the game is waiting for me to discard
     another one. However, when I get back to my list, the spell I had
     picked to cast is displayed again. JC: NOW FIXED.

 16. FD: When a growth is hit with "No grow", it becomes inanimate, so
     the animation should be stopped. JC: NOW FIXED.

 17. CHANGED: Each Wizard now has a unique name!  Instead of 8
     creatures with the name "Wizard", we now have "Wizard 1", "Wizard
     2" etc.  This was neccessary so that each wizard can have its own
     unique sound files and graphic files.

 18. BUG: A scroll of a Cat Lord takes control of the cats and makes
     them belong to NOBODY!  NOW FIXED.

 19. CHANGED: Inanimage is now only half as likely to cast
     Inanimorphobiosis or Mass Petrification as he is likely to cast
     any of his other spells.

 20. CHANGED Ghoul: The description of the Ghoul says that it feeds on
     others so I have now changed it so that it has Exophagy and +2
     Scavenging as per Frédéric's request.

 21. Double-attacking BUG: Independent creatures and the creatures of
     computer-controlled wizards get to move and/or attack twice if
     they have more than 10 movement points and are not engaged. NOW
     FIXED.

 22. BUG: Independent creatures and the creatures of
     computer-controlled wizards accrue approximately .24 free movement
     points for each diagonal movement made. NOW FIXED.

 23. BUG: A computer-controlled wizard who is mounted on an inanimate
     object (such as a centaur that has been hit with Flesh to Stone)
     can still attack and shoot if the centaur is "engaged". NOW FIXED

 24. BUG: Animate affects scrolls of inanimate objects! NOW FIXED!

 25. FD: I cast "no grow" on my own gooey blob so that I get many
     creatures when I subsequently cast "animate". However, it didn't
     work: I still have my petrified gooey blob. We should either: say
     the spell only works for trees, or make it affect more inanimate
     objects (including those petrified by flesh to stone, for example
     make them creatures again). JC: I changed it so that now it
     affects petrified growths. NOW FIXED. Also it didn't affect
     Ropers. Now it does.

 26. FD: When the mount of a wizard is killed, it leaves no corpse
     behind. JC: NOW FIXED.

 27. FD: When a creature kills a growth covering a scroll, it does not
     move over the scroll. JC: NOW FIXED.

 28. FD: Desire: on the second setup screen, add the GFLG_TABCYCLE (cf
     Intuition/Intuition.h) to the string gadgets so that one can move
     between all the string gadgets without using the mouse. JC: DONE.
     I also implemented it on the 1st setup screen. TABCYCLE feature
     added in honor of Frédéric Delacroix, who earned the "Playtester
     of the Month Award" for June 2000.

 29. FD: Suggestion: Convert could be cast on the inanimate so that it
     can be used to destroy dark wood. (An enemy of mine is an arborist
     and cast a line of dark woods close to me). JC: DONE. Convert
     spell description updated.

 30. FD: There is an independent solar but it never moves or attack !
     JC: NOW FIXED. Tested and works perfectly.

 31. Font bugs! Font in start/quit gadgets is wrong. It is using a
     system default font. Font in Menus is wrong. It is using a system
     default font.  Font inside the filerequester is wrong. It is using
     a system default font.  Font in text gadgets on setup 1 is Topaz!
     The solution is to have a PearlFont8TextAttrForOpenDiskFont that
     says "ChaosGame:fonts/pearl.font" and a seperate
     PearlFont8TextAttrForIntuition that says "pearl.font". NOW FIXED.

Improvements from 2.84 to 2.85
------------------------------

  1. FD: It seems to me that growths eventually stop growing, sometimes
     after a single turn. JC: NOW FIXED.

  2. FD: I have noticed very recently (between 2.83 and 2.84) that some
     growths tend to stop growing very rapidly. I once cast an orange
     jelly and it never grew at all ! JC: NOW FIXED.

  3. FD: Sometimes Hippocrates or Aesculapius randomly kills one of my
     creatures with his healing Special Combat. JC: I finally figured
     this out! It happened randomly because it was caused by the
     Impurities code! The real bug was: BUG: With Impurities turned on,
     healing special combat sometimes kills the creature being healed!
     NOW FIXED!

  4. FD: When a cloaked wizard who as scavengerism is scavenging a
     corpse, it says "Wizard 4 munches on a corpse of cloaked creature"
     ! JC: This was a simple matter where I switched my variables. NOW
     FIXED.

  5. FD: Sometimes when a wizard is "killed" by
     justice/vengeance/exorcise in an unexplored region and is
     reinstated, his position is revealed (the cell he's in becomes
     empty for the duration of the "bonus spell" sound). JC: This was a
     bug whereby DrawCell(&NothingImage,cell); was being used instead
     of the correct ReDrawCell(cell); DrawCell() just blindly draws
     graphics into cells without taking into account exploration mode.
     ReDrawCell() knows about exploration mode and acts accordingly.
     NOW FIXED.

  6. FD: The wizard that wouldn't die bug: Wizard 5 has 1 life point
     and -2 recovery. Each time he's attacked, it dies (allelujah
     sound, but no wizard dying sound). The cell is left blank but the
     wizard is still there if I move the mouse pointer over it. It can
     be attacked again and the same happens. The cell is eventually
     refreshed and the wizard reappears. I think he cast Lich lord
     during his first life but the lich lord icon is not in the list of
     his powerups now. He was killed at least 15 times by the
     independents ! JC: Ok, this had nothing to do with Lich Lord. This
     was caused by the fact that the wizard had cast Horror on himself.
     Each time he was killed the Horror code kicked in and tried to
     replicate him, but there were no empty adjacent cells. So he
     wasn't actually replicated and the Horror was not actually used up
     and he didn't actually die. I have now changed it such that: 1) If
     this happens again, the Horror gets used up. So it will only
     happen once. 2) It now prints a text message and does a graphical
     effect to indicate that the Horror process is happening. 3) It
     sets Life, Magic Resistance, Intelligence, Manuverability and
     Combat to maximum. Move gets set to max(CurrentMove,InitialMove).
     This is to make up for the fact that it didn't get to replicate.
     NOW FIXED. Tested and works ok.

  7. FD: When the independents (but it may also happen for other teams,
     I don't know) kill a wizard, the word "Independents" at the bottom
     of the screen is erased just after the dying-wizard animation, and
     the movement phase continues without "Independents" to be
     reprinted.  JC: NOW FIXED.

  8. FD: An evil wizard cast meddle but the following creatures were not
     affected: The exorcist, earth elemental. Is it because they have no
     reincarnation ? JC: Yes. FD: Why wouldn't the exorcist reincarnate
     into a bandit or an orc ? He was set to not reincarnate into
     anything. I have now changed The Exorcist so that he reincarnates
     into a good little Halfling.

  9. FD: A wizard destroyed a white dragon corpse with a magic bolt and
     the dragon cried ! It's an old bug you told me was allegedly fixed
     :-) JC: OOPS! I put the "and !isDead(b) and !isScroll(b)" code on
     1 of the lines that needed it but I forgot to put it on the other
     line that needed it!  doh! NOW FIXED.

 10. Score Screen has now been translated into Français. I added in a
     teensy amount of code for stringwidth sensitivity so that the
     screen looks good in English and Français. I'll probably have to
     add more code when the game is translated to other languages. I
     only added in the bare minimum amount to make the Français score
     screen look good.

 11. SMALL BUGS: Microscopically small even 8) The following spells
     would, in exploration mode, reveal the position of the target for
     a brief instant by drawing a blank image in the target cell.
     However, this blank image was immediately redrawn properly.
     Apparently nobody ever noticed this small flaw. It affected the
     following spells: Armour, Brain Boost, Cloak, Combat, Cursed
     Sword, Magic Shield, Meteor Storm, Recover Boost, Restoration,
     Sword of Sassenrath, Scavengerism and Exophagy. NOW FIXED.

 12. ALL appropriate occurrences of DrawCell() have now been replaced
     with ReDrawCell()  I systematically went through the entire
     program and did this.  DONE.

 13. 1st and 2nd Spell Information Panels have now been 100% translated
     into Français.

 14. Replaced all appropriate occurrences of player_name[x] with
     PlayerName(x) in the entire program + coded the PlayerName()
     routine to handle the multilingual translation issues. This took 1
     hour.

Improvements from 2.85 to 2.86
------------------------------

  1. Replaced EndTurn.8svx with Frédéric's EndTurn.8svx because
     nobody liked the old end turn sound.  I renamed the old
     EndTurn.8svx to MaxCombat.8svx and changed the game code to play
     this sound anytime anyone casts a spell that makes a creature have
     maximum combat.  This means the following spells: Combat, Touch of
     God, Chaos Lord.

  2. Translation of IP1 (Information Panel 1) Creature Statistics
     Screen to: Français. Scavenge translates to Charognardise which
     is _entirely_ too long. So I'm leaving this in English. Someday
     when we make the AGA version this can be changed to the
     "Scavengerism" spell icon, which looks quite nice. Magic
     Resistance translates to Résistance magique which is too long.
     Résistance magique -> Résist. magique Ranged Combat translates
     to Combat à distance which is too long.

  3. Reduced the amount of time that the horrible looking circular
     pattern is displayed on the lissa-box requester things. Reduced it
     to 1/3 of its old value.

  4. ADDED Multingual talklists code so that now the game can use
     talklists of any supported language.

  5. The dir structure of certain things in Chaos has now changed. The
     Screens/ dir and TalkListsDir/ have changed. So any further
     updates issued need to be COMPLETE updates, not just the
     executable file. Possibly other things in the dir structure or
     file structure have changed also.

  6. FLAW: Touch of God and Chaos Lord do not do any sort of graphical
     effect!  So you cannot tell who it is being cast on! NOW FIXED.

  7. PROBLEM: The req.library filerequester is optimized for use on
     non-interleaved bitmaps. This means the scrolling sucks bigtime on
     the chaos interleaved bitmaps. It colorflashes horribly. It goes
     from having the best scrolling of any filerequester to suddenly
     having the worst scrolling of any filerequester. So I opened up
     yet another new screen. This one is just like the old HiResScreen
     only it is noninterleaved. Now the scrolling looks fast and smooth
     again! NOW FIXED.

  8. LOAD/SAVE screens now have smooth scrolling once again.

  9. Fixed Passage description.

 10. Copied the entire gamedir over to Chaos_2.9/ so that I may now
     begin work on the Enhanced Graphics Version on Tuesday, July 25th,
     2000.

Improvements from 2.86 to 3.0
-----------------------------

   Enhanced graphics version !

  1. I have written a new graphics system that uses standard iff
     pictures to describe how monsters and magic spells and all other
     objects in the game look. This required LOTS of changes to the
     game executable (see the README file for details).

  2. BUG: When playing in exploration mode, if you try to examine an
     unexplored cell and the cell has a scroll in it then it lets you
     read the scroll! NOW FIXED.

  3. BUG: Joseph Conwell reports that he cast Sword of Sassenrath on
     his Orc and then when it promoted to Mighty Orc it lost its Sword
     of Sassenrath. JC: This is because it promotes to whichever stat
     is bigger. 0 > -1 so it makes sense. However I have now hacked in
     some extra code so that if you posess negative special combat then
     it will be promoted to whichever stat has the greatest absolute
     value. NOW FIXED.

  4. Put in Xav's new moon from setupscreen as Sanctuary. DONE. Put in
     Kreton's Wizard graphic as Wizard 1. DONE. Edit Generator. DONE.
     Remove blood from ShapeChanger. DONE. Spriggan is messed up. Fix
     him. DONE. Mess with Witches as new wizards. Leave this for Xav.
     Amphisbaena is all messed up. Leave this for Joe or Xav.

  5. Add in code to load the setupscreen1 from
     gfx/Screens/English/SetupScreen1.iff. DONE.

  6. Rewrite the setup code to have everything on SetupScreen1
     positioned correctly. This took some time because the name gadgets
     were overwriting the border. DONE.

  7. Add in code to load the setupscreen2 from
     gfx/Screens/English/SetupScreen2.iff  DONE.

  8. WOOPS!  I forgot to rewrite PutToSleep() to stop animating
     creatures that are asleep!  There is a sleeping Pegasus that is
     still flapping its wings like crazy!  NOW FIXED.

  9. Rewrite Flesh to Stone and Mass Petrification to properly stop the
     newly created inanimate object from being animated. DONE.

 10. Rewrite Stone to Flesh and Inanimorphobiosis to properly reactivate
     the animation on a previously-animated creature.  DONE.

 11. Put Xavier in the scrolling credits and the docs. DONE.

 12. FLAW: The pentagrams on the "About" screen are now invisible due
     to the new color palette! NOW FIXED.

 13. Add in code to load the EndTurn, Question Mark, Dismount, Load and
     Save gadgets from gfx/Gadgets/English/

 14. August 2, 2000: The size of the release executable file "chaos" is
     325816 bytes.  On July 25 it was 421048.  SAVED 95232 bytes!

 15. After converting all the gfx to IFF files, many spells looked
     horrible and I spent some time editing them.

 16. Included Joseph's improved Abath, Arborist, Alliance, Agathion,
     Azer, Apple Wood, Aviary. I totally redid Joe's Aviary and Apple
     Wood and Archerotomy.  Included Xav's improved: Agathion, Air
     Elemental, Acid Rain.

 17. Burstroem's Browser: Included Xav's book. Added more antialiasing
     to the bottom of the book. Included Joseph's new Bandit and
     Baboon. They are both MUCH better than the originals!

 18. Included Xav's Fantabulous Battle Cry! Included Xav's new
     Biohazard. I will use Joseph's Biohazard as something else.
     Included Joseph's new Bipedal Generator and Bodak. Edited Joseph's
     new Basalt Golem into an animation and included it.

 19. Exorcise: I simply replaced the old Exorcise graphic which wasn't
     so bad with a new one designed by Aes which is TOTALLY AWESOME! It
     has great shading in it!!! Oops its 2 pixels to tall and 2 pixels
     too wide! NOW FIXED!

 20. Inanimage and Inanimatologist look identical to a Wizard 1! I
     propose: Xav's Wizard 1 becomes Inanimage. Xav's Wizard 1 minus
     the wand becomes Inanimatologist. There will be a completely new
     wizard for Wizard 1. (I'll decide which graphic later on) This
     means the old Inanimage/Inanimatologist/Wizard 1 will be used for
     absolutely nothing! But I can assign him to be something later. I
     can also draw sparkles around the end of the wand.

 21. Magic Castle: The original was so so hopeless looking that I
     didn't bother trying to smooth it out.  I just replaced it with
     Xav's "Dark Castle".  The Dark Castle has a flaw: The Door and
     windows are made of the transparent black instead of the hard
     foreground black.  NOW FIXED.

 22. Ogre Warrior: The original Ogre Warrior was just a mirror image of
     the Ogre so that is how I did the new one. I just mirrored the
     Ogre and saved it.  This means the shadowing is actually
     backwards. But oh well... we can worry about that later. Maybe it
     will be funny to have a backwards shadow on him?

 23. Ogre Assasin: He's just like the Ogre Warrior but with a differnet
     animation sequence.  He has the backwards shadow as above.

 24. Oracle: Designed by Xav.  I brightened the crystal ball a bit and
     made it look like the Oracle's fingers were touching the crystal
     ball.  For the dead image I drew a crystal ball laying on the
     ground + pirated the dead image from Scavengerism.

 25. Added in Joseph's new: spectator, spriggan, speed, storm, sleep,
     skeleton, Hyperclone, Shocker. Shape Changer, Shadow, Magic
     Attack, Lich Lord, Leopard

 26. Put in Joseph's new: Joker, Justice (goatee), Iridium Horse (back
     leg), King Cobra (hood, now brown), Imp (more frames of
     animation), Hippocrates (now has a 2 pixel hat), Free All (now has
     3 keys instead of only 2), Dark Power (multi-shaded green), Aerial
     Servant (many frames of animation + different colors)

 27. Sent Eye for an Eye, Animate, Exophagy to Xav along with spell
     descriptions:  They came back looking unbelievably awesome!!!!!

 28. Xav's Telescope: I lightened the moon. Included Xav's Magic Bolt,
     Magic Glass, Mana Battery. Included Xav's amazingly great new:
     Shadow Wood, Dark Wood, Fir Tree, Magic Wood, Apple Wood. Included
     Xav's amazingly great new: Violet Fungi, Gooey Blob, Green Ooze,
     Orange Jelly, Fire, Flood, Earthquake.

 29. August 2, 2000: The size of the release executable file "chaos" is
     325816 bytes. On July 25 it was 421048. SAVED 95232 bytes!

 30. Many more graphics adjustments, see README for details.

 31. Sent v2.9 to Xav on August 2, 2000 so he can design gfx for it
     over his 2 weeks vacation.

 32. Put in Xav's fixed Wizard 2, Wizard 3 and Fly.  We still need 4
     female wizards.

 33. Included Xav's new: Ball Lightning, Basalt Golem, Bless, Charm,
     Clay Golem, Coercion, Cure, Dalek, Dao, Dark Wood, Death Bringer,
     Demonic Touch, Depth, Destroy Wall, Discard, Double, Elephant,
     Fireball, Freeze, Haste, Horse, Hyperclone, Irvine's
     Invulnerability, Justice, Lightning, Lion, Magic Bow, Meteor
     Storm, Moveit, Mullac de Irvine, Protection, Pyotechnics, Quickshot
     (quickshot is hard to read but I went ahead and included it
     anyway).  Radioactive Land, Recover Boost, Reflector, Replicate,
     Request, Reveal,

 34. Xav says to change the French spell desccription of Dark Citadel
     from Citadèle to Citadelle.  DONE.

 35. BUG: Mana Battery Scrolls give bonus spells just like a real Mana
     Battery.  NOW FIXED.

 36. BUG: 1 occurrence of "Brain Dead" was not using translated strings
     thus it was always appearing in English.

 37. August 15, 2000: Replaced all occurrences of "Run JCsound >NIL:"
     with "Run <>NIL: JCsound <>NIL:"

 38. Included Frédéric's new Français Spell Descriptions: Water
     Elemental, Sluggishness Beam and Combat Drain Beam.

 39. FD: Something strange happened when I cast consecrate on a higher
     devil sitting on the bottom border of the screen: the devil
     himself was not killed, of course, but the spell did extra sound
     effects, as if there had been creatures below. And I heard an
     allelujah sound, and at the end of the turn the bonus window
     opened. No victim, no "Other", but I had the choice of 1 spell
     among 31 !!! JC: The trouble was that the Drainer() function had
     NO error checking! Ack! all these years its been affecting cells
     that don't exist!  NOW FIXED.

 40. Sent all English and Français spell descriptions to Red|Blue in
     Quebec for proofreading. He liked the game "Romance of the 3
     Kingdoms" and "Bandit Kings of Ancient China" so I figure he'll
     like Chaos.

 41. FD: Due to impurities, a generator went asleep but continued to
     generate sleeping creatures. It's kind of strange don't you think
     ? Impurities shouldn't put generators to sleep ! They should only
     change their allegeance to a wizard or the independents (the
     sleeping creatures generated are often destroyed as soon as they
     are generated :-) ) JC: This sounds sooooooooooo hilarious!!!! I
     don't know how you find all this weird stuff out!!!!
     hehehehhahahahahahah 8) It sounds so funny I'm not going to change
     it. I've never seen it happen before! And if it does happen it must
     be very rare. I probably should fix it so that it doesn't change
     to dead wizards... either that or let creatures move, even if they
     belong to a dead wizard. FD: That would be a good enhancement. And
     change the dead revenge so that dead players keep control of the
     generated creatures.

 42. NEW FEATURE: I have now adjusted the code, such that if a creature
     exists who belongs to a dead wizard, the creature will still be
     moved as usual.

 43. DEAD REVENGE IMPROVED: I have now adjusted the code such that a
     wizard who is killed while posessing the Dead Revenge powerup will
     not lose ANY of his generators! The wizard will die, but his
     generators will live on! And any creatures produced by the
     generators will be controllable by the player! I forsee this as
     being strategically important primarily in multiplayer games where
     a certain wizard may be killed first, but can still have some
     influence in the game due to his generated creatures. For years I
     haven't even bothered casting Dead Revenge because it just didn't
     really seem to benefit me; there were always better spells to
     cast. Now however, I will always try to cast Dead Revenge!

 44. EDITED Dead Revenge spell description.

 45. BUG: I have found a strange bug in the game related to the chaos
     lord and fire. It could be the fire shield (and possibly other
     shields) that's not working. My wizard (an undead chaos lord, by
     the way, with shocker) was covered by its own fire breathed by one
     of my 3 platinum dragons, but it did not die !!! I destroyed the
     fire with another platinum dragon breath, and I could see a very
     very strange animation, alternating: my wizard (wizard 1), a grey
     elf (previouly dead) and the dead grey elf. I guess this is
     because the fire had 3 animation frames... ? When I query the
     stats, everything is back to normal chaos lord stats, except for
     life force who's back to 19. No wait ! There's another big strange
     difference ! It's Wizard 1 belonging to nobody ! And it moved and
     attacked (but only shot once instead of three) with the
     independents ! He killed my cats ! What a strange creature !
     Actually it moves between me and my cats (I have the cat lord),
     not with the independents. JC: ok, I have investigated this and it
     all comes down to this: Fire Shield and Flood Shield DO NOT WORK!
     Ack! All these years Fire Shield and Flood Shield have not been
     working! NOW FIXED.

 46. Included Frédéric's new English and Français spell descriptions
     for Power Walls and Webs.

 47. FLAW: When a Tempest kills something, it doesn't make the dying
     noise and it doesn't print any text message either. It just sort
     of disappears. NOW FIXED.

 48. Garbage appears in the french translation when I have reveal in my
     spell list and the mouse pointer is over it. I get something like
     "RévélerÜF\«J". I looked at the "Reveal" description file but
     it seems ok to me... ? This only happens with this spell. JC: It
     is the very last spell. The very last spell wasn't being
     NULL-terminated. NOW FIXED.

 49. FD: When a creature has a negative combat statistic, it can heal
     other creatures. But the "m" key does not show it can move over
     friendly creatures to heal them. JC: NOW FIXED.

 50. BUG: If you shoot and kill your own wizard, when you end your turn,
     sometimes various random enforcer hits happen and always various
     random bits of memory get corrupted. This was caused by
     MoveWizard() being performed on a dead wizard so it thinks the wiz
     is in cell -1 which causes many illegal mem accesses. NOW FIXED.

 51. Included Xav's new Singular Earthbind, Dual Earthbind, Dragon Nest
     and Goblin / Goblin Bomb.

 52. BUG: The archery effect randomly locks up the entire computer
     (sometimes).  I theorize that sometimes task switching kicks in
     right in the middle of a OS WritePixel() call such that
     WritePixel() starts out using rastPort with a layer and ends up
     using a rastPort without a layer (or vice versa).  And this
     somehow makes the OS go insane and crash. So how should I fix
     this? A) Add an ObtainSemaphore() ReleaseSemaphore() pair to the
     archery code? B) Comment out that layers disabling code in the
     animator task? I am choosing option B for the following reasons:
     1. I don't ever want this bug to happen again! Someday someone
     might code a new routine that does writes or reads from rastPort
     without getting a lock on &Board first! Then the bug will be back!
     2. I don't have time to fiddle around chasing silly bugs like this
     so we'll just have to settle for an animator task that is now 10%
     to 15% slower. 3. Now that I've implemented the fix, THAT
     MYSTERIOUS BLUE LINE THAT KEPT RANDOMLY APPEARING ON THE LEFT HAND
     SIDE OF THE BOARD IS GONE FOREVER! NOW FIXED!

 53. BUG: Strange blue line randomly appears on the left side of the
     board.  NOW FIXED (see above).

 54. PROBLEM: Using default settings the music is playing during the
     bonus spell selection panel.  This causes JCsound to fail.  This
     doesn't hurt anything but it is disconcerting to the user to see
     messages in the cli window that say "ChaosDigitalSoundSubProcess
     failed returncode 150" so I have now changed the bonus spell panel
     to not attempt to play any sound effects if the music is playing.
     NOW FIXED.

 55. Included Xav's Abduction graphic (the one with the flying saucer).
     The only trouble is that the Abduction spell doesn't really
     abduct anyone.  Abduction should really be renamed as BrainWashing
     or something.  "Abduction" should be the same as Vanish but I
     can't think up a way to make it be different from Vanish. (?)

 56. Included Joseph's new Eagle (2 extra frames), Skeleton (Added a
     few new frames), Dragon Nest (He thought it looked to much like a
     friendly little fireplace so he made it round.  It is now an
     interdimensional "portal"), Pegasus (1 extra frame), Crocodile
     (fixed the feet).

 57. FLAW: A Range Boosted or Aesculapiused Goblin loses some ability
     when killing an Archer and picking up the bow.  NOW FIXED.

 58. Included Xav's new Français setup screen I and II into the game.

 59. FLAW: If a person doesn't have narrator.device installed then the
     game won't play.  I have now removed all narrator.device
     dependencies so this is NOW FIXED.

 60. ADDED a new code module prefs.c to Load and Save user preferences
     in a plain ASCII file.  I just hacked and slashed sm.c into
     prefs.c.  This ended up still being a lot of work.  Over 1200
     lines of code.

 61. New menu option: "Save Prefs"

 62. Changed Français info panel Tirer -> Tir.

 63. FD: "If you want to read about a spell, point at it and press "q"
     for Query." I let it as is, but there's something you should be
     aware of: in the french keymap, I must press "a" instead of "q" to
     get info. But this can change also for other french-speaking
     countries. What you should do is use the keymap.library (in ROM)
     to revert the wanted character into a wanted keypress, so that the
     letter can be correct in all keymap configurations. JC: Ok I did
     this and tested it and it works. NOW FIXED.

 64. PROBLEM: Now that we have improved pearl.font for Chaos there can
     be a problem. If a person already has the old pearl.font installed
     and is using it in his workbench or CED or whatever, then it will
     already be loaded.  Thus when Chaos attempts to load "pearl.font"
     it will load their old unimproved version since it is already in
     memory. Therefore I have now renamed pearl.font -> ChaosPearl.font
     and ran fixfonts on it. NOW FIXED.

 65. Made documentation directories.  Copied the quickstarts into them.

 66. Added #?.prefs and Documentation/ all to MakeDemoOfChaos.txt

 67. BUG: Justice randomly does the following: A: Doesn't work. B:
     Works C: Works but then awards a bonus spell on a creature that
     isn't supposed to give a bonus spell. An innocent-looking routine
     was in fact the work of EVIL. It was causing all the random errors
     of Justice, Dark Power, Vengeance, Exorcise etc. There is a ;
     missing from the end of the first line therefore the 2nd line was
     never being executed. NOW FIXED.

 68. New IFF gadget loading code: Each gadget will be an IFF brush. I
     must load each of these brushes into an image struct. 1. Open the
     IFF-file. 2.  Determine its x and y size. 3. Allocate the memory
     for that 4. Read it in and set up the struct Image for it. 5. Poke
     these values into the gadget struct.

 69. Included Xav's new French versions of the Start and Quit gadgets.

 70. The game is now 99% playable in French.  Everything except the
     menus and docs has been translated.

 71. Added in those 2 gadgets for the hires screen.

 72. REMOVED the old hardcoded TickImage and CrossImage from
     Init.c/Init.h

 73. I antialiased Xav's new rotating Generator and included it into
     the game.

 74. Version 3.0 completed on September 20th, 2000.

Improvements from 3.0 to 3.01
-----------------------------

  1. FD: I cast "stone to flesh" on one of my dark wood trees and moved
     it next to an independent ghast. However, it did not get engaged
     to the ghast and I could not attack it on the same turn. JC: I
     could not exactly duplicate this bug. When I moved my Dark Wood
     next to any enemy it got engaged, however when I clicked on the
     enemy to attack it, no sound was made and the graphical attack
     effect was not shown. The attack actually did happen though. The
     enemy lost the appropriate 2 hit points. This was caused by code
     that suppressed the attack sounds & gfx for the Dark Wood (so as
     not to get boring and annoying when its SpecialCombat attacks 8
     adjacent enemies). I tweaked the code to only suppress the combat
     sound and graphical effect when the Dark Wood is inanimate. NOW
     FIXED.

  2. INTEGRATED Frédéric's improved asm music routines into the game.
     The music system now resides in the dir AsmMusicSystem/ I didn't
     know what to do with the file proplayer.a so I just left it out.
     Everything seems to work ok but the subsong bug is still there.  I
     did a simple memory leak test and a simple mungwall hit test.
     Everything seems ok.  We can now allegedly play MMD2 songs from
     Octamed Sound Studio Professional from 1 to 64 channels.

  3. FLAW: When you select a spell from your list, the erased area is 1
     pixel to big.  NOW FIXED.

  4. ADDED part of the code to support PlayByEmail.

  5. When the mount of a wizard is killed, it leaves no corpse behind.
     Tested and works perfectly.  NOW FIXED.

  6. When a wizard dismounts something onto a scroll, the scroll is
     destroyed.  NOW FIXED.

  7. Above fix causes collapsing meditations to reappear once the
     wizard moves off of them.  NOW FIXED.

  8. FD: I had saved the preferences with Music off, but when I
     restarted the game, the music was switched back on. However, the
     menu "Music" was unchecked. When I selected it, another module was
     restarted, then I could switch the music off by reselecting the
     item. Seems you forgot to read this preference item before
     starting the music. NOW FIXED.

  9. FD: The left amiga key acts as "q". Actually, I guess every
     keypress of a qualifier triggers the very last action done on the
     keyboard. JC: This was caused by the fact that MapRawKey() maps
     qualifier keys as nothing. That is it doesn't even put a 0 into
     the buffer. So the buffer was left holding whatever key was
     pressed last. NOW FIXED.

 10. FIXED that rawkey problem on the 2nd creature info panel that
     prevented screen grabbing! (Pressing ANY key at all was clearing
     the screen).  NOW FIXED.

 11. STUPID: Computer wizards senselessly cast Dark Wood trees adjacent
     to themselves.  I have now implemented more advanced AI for use
     with this particular spell so this is NOW FIXED.

 12. Several new predicates to support the new AI.

 13. INTERLACE PROBLEM:  Sometimes AGA users complain that certain chaos
     screens are in interlace.  They want to make use of their AGA chips
     + their multisync monitors to produce a 100% solid flickerfree
     display.  So I have now added a new cli startup option -d to force
     chaos to open all its screens in doublepal mode.  I also added a
     new startup script and icon so chaos can easily be started in
     DoublePal mode from now on.  DoublePal modes are noninterlaced and
     flicker free.  NOW FIXED.

 14. ADDED Polski, Norsk, Svenska and Finnish to the language menu.

 15. September 27th, 2000: I got a finished polski.catalog from Artur.

 16. ADDED new code to make the top half of the 2nd creature info panel
     fully stringwidth sensitive. (I had already done this with the
     bottom half).  This allows the Polski translations to fit without
     overlapping. DONE.

 17. ADDED new code to make the text on the score screens fully
     stringwidth sensitive.  This allows the polski translations to fit
     without overlapping.  The numeric columns are unchanged.  Seems to
     work ok.

 18. Implement translated menus. The Intuition menus are now fully
     international and automatically adjust to the length of the
     strings in the menus. ALL DONE

 19. Added code to center the translated strings of the demo over
     screen. DONE.

 20. Fixed spell descriptions for Hydra, Flood Shield, Marid and
     Protection.

 21. Installed the new HUPL versions of all the fonts.  These are the
     standard gamefonts modified by Attila the Hun to have all
     Hungarian chars in the proper places and then modified by
     Frédéric Delacroix to contain all Polish chars in the proper
     places.  I then had Sau test the ChaosPearlHUPL font on his Amiga
     in Hungary using a Hungarian keymap and he reports all chars are
     there and everything is ok.

 22. New function to support the new AI: FirstAdjacentHumanAlly()

 23. FLAW: Deutsch.catalog on 2nd scroll info panel goes off the right
     edge of the screen.  Everything was working great with the
     English, Français and Polski catalogs But when I got the
     Deutsch.catalog it was going off the right-hand edge of the 2nd
     scroll info panel.  I have now changed that panel so that the left
     column is right against the left edge and the right column is
     right against the right edge.

 24. Goblin Bomb now picks up bows just like a regular Goblin.

 25. Changed/fixed Goblin Bomb SCROLLS to no longer explode when shot.
     October 11, 2000

 26. Also fixed it so that: Shooting a scroll of an Earthquake,
     Generator, Stone Golem or Stone Giant no longer shakes the screen.
     Shooting a scroll of a Hidden Horror no longer causes a Red Dragon
     to appear. Shooting a scroll of an Elemental no longer causes it
     to become its Elemental Form (water, fire, tempest, earthquake)

 27. New Ruthlessness mode. When Ruthlessness mode is activated
     computer players will: 1. Cast pits, magic glass, walls, rocks and
     miner willy more intelligently and aggressively.  2. If they are
     an arborist they will cast shadow wood and dark wood trees in a
     more aggressive and intelligent manner.  3. Whenever a creature is
     engaged it will always attack the strongest creature that it can
     acutally kill.  If it cannot make a kill then it will attack
     whichever enemy it feels is the most dangerous.  4. A shooting
     creature will always attempt to shoot the strongest creature that
     it can actually kill.  If it cannot make a kill then it will shoot
     whatever enemy it feels is the most dangerous.  They never try to
     shoot a wizard who is inulnerable or has a reflector.  5. A
     nonengaged ground creature will always check first if there is a
     path to any enemy wizard that it can kill.  If it cannot kill any
     enemy wizard then it will check if there is a path to any
     favorite-food creature that it can kill.  If it cannot kill its
     favorite food then it will check if there is a path to any
     bonus-spell creature that it can kill.

 28. Implemented new AI code for ruthlessness mode. Now ruthless
     computer players will cast pits, magic glass, walls, rocks, miner
     willy, shadow wood and dark wood trees in a much more intelligent
     and aggressive manner. This took 600+ lines of code and quite a
     lot of time. It added 7k+ to the size of the executable.

 29. Implemented new AI code for ruthlessness mode. Now computer
     shooters shoot the strongest thing that they can kill.  If there
     is a tie then they shoot the most dangerous opponent.  Wizards
     will not shoot and kill a creature protected by Eye for an Eye.

 30. Implemented new AI code for ruthlessness mode.  Now engaged
     computer creatures attack the strongest thing they can kill.  If
     there is a tie then they attack the most dangerous opponent.
     Wizards will not attack and kill a creature protected by Eye for
     an Eye.

 31. Implemented new AI code for ruthlessness mode: flying nonengaged
     creatures attack the strongest thing they can kill.  If they can't
     kill anything then they attack the most dangerous thing they can
     hit.  If there is nothing they can hit from their current position
     then they fall back to the old movement routine.

 32. Implement ground-based nonengaged creatures seek a good kill.
     (wizard, favorite food or bonus spell creature). If they can't do
     any of those things then they just fall back to the old movement
     routine. I had to make some adjustments and things to make
     everything work within the realm of Chaos. But now that it is
     done, IT IS TOTALLY AWESOME! I built some complicated mazes and
     then pressed the "m" key and it correctly showed all the places I
     could and could not move to! I kept randomly deleting pieces of
     walls and putting new walls elsewhere in an attempt to confuse it
     but it worked every time! WAY COOL! This algorythm only finds
     clear paths to every square on the board. This algorythm does not
     currently try to calculate any sort of "hack your way through
     these certain barriers to reach your goal" type of stuff. This
     algorythm takes into account the fact that once you are engaged
     you can attack any adjacent square, even if you only have .1
     movement points left.

 33. BUG: There has always been a bug in the game whereby if you move
     some squares and then have only .5 to .9 movement points left it
     lets you move another full square! This is cheating! It takes 1
     whole movement point to move in a straight line and 1.4142
     movement points to move diagonally! I have now changed the
     inappropriate occurrences of "0.5" in move.c and cmove.c to say
     "1.0" now. However, you can still cheat and step diagonally on
     your last move when you only have 1 movement point left. SORT OF
     FIXED.  I will work out a way to fix this last flaw later. Later:
     ok the movement system now works exactly the way it should. This
     is all 100% NOW FIXED.

 34. BUG: The computer movement routine deducts 2 movement points for
     each diagonal move instead of the correct 1.4142!  This applies to
     computer creatures AND computer wizards!  NOW FIXED.

 35. BUG: The WRONG movement point value is shown all the time.  It was
     taking the actual movement points left and rounding them DOWN to
     the nearest lower integer. NOW FIXED.

 36. Added code so that nonengaged exposed wizards will run into an
     unoccupied meditation if possible.

 37. Modified "m" key to work, even in the middle of a creature's
     movement! I've been wanting this feature for years! I finally did
     it! And now that I've fixed all those 10 year old bugs in the move
     routines the m-key highlighted squares now agree perfectly with
     the printed numerical value at the bottom of the screen and with
     how far you @{i}actually@{ui} get to move your unit.

 38. FIXED FindAllPaths() to handle mounts + level 2 mounts when the
     SourceCell contains an exposed wizard. (It already handled
     meditations).  DONE.

 39. FIXED "m" key ground movement to handle mounts and level2 mounts +
     ride.

 40. FIXED "m" key flying movement!  Just use the old code. DONE.

 41. FIXED "m" key flying movement to take into account
     "WillIGetEngagedIfIMoveThere".  This way cells which you cannot
     directly fly to, but you can fly next to them, become engaged and
     then attack them will now be correctly highlighted.

 42. Robin Schmidt writes: The Pyrohydra has combat 15 and ranged
     combat 5. But the discription tells me that the breath fire of the
     pyrohydra is one of the strongest. I suppose you swaped the
     numbers? JC: Wow! What a cool bug you found! I swapped the numbers
     back around. NOW FIXED.

 43. RS: 1. When questioning a cloaked object, the German text is too
     long. We need a line feed + carriage return 8-) JC: It took me 90
     minutes to hack and slash an AntiAliasWriteTextLength() function
     together for this purpose. NOW FIXED.

 44. Improved Team/Alliances and ending the game.

 45. BUG: Team[] gets saved and loaded with the savegame file but not
     TeamSettings[]!  I have now fixed this, this means the savegame
     format has changed again.  I am deleting all my old saved games
     and I am converting all the levels to the new format. NOW FIXED.

 46. RS: 2. The Nightmare has a combar value of 1? I think it should be
     higher, for 'it's feet are burning hot' or something like that. I
     just deleted the sentence "They attack with their hooves which are
     burning hot." from the spell description so this is NOW FIXED. Of
     course now I will have to convince all the translators around the
     world to upgrade to the new spell description... 8/

 47. CHANGED spell descriptions of: Bat, Nightmare, Virtue.  Sent them
     to FD and SF.  Included new FD French versions.

 48. ADDED code to keep track of total time spent playing chaos and
     total number of turns played.  Now I just have to decide where I
     will display this information.

 49. INCREASED the code to keep track of total time spent playing chaos
     to keep seperate totals for each of the 8 players + the
     independents.

 50. Added code to switch to the HUPL font when selecting Hungarian or
     Polish from the Language menu.

 51. The toe of the Babboon is all messed up. NOW FIXED. + I drew some
     blood on the dead body.

 52. Pieces of the Skeleton animation were not antialiased.  NOW FIXED.

 53. Amphisbaena is all messed up! NOW FIXED.

 54. RS: Yesterday (or tomorrow, don't know) I got the Touch Of GOD
     (nice one 8-)! So I made my Wood Elf a godlike creature. A when it
     moved around killing here killig there killing everywhere it
     suddenly was promoted to a Dread Elf (ooohh, how dreadful)! But
     then I saw that his life force was decreased, and so were Magical
     Resistance and healing capabilities! That's no good, my dear. And
     I presume this 'feature' can be used with any promotable creature
     that is under the Armour and Protection spells. No other values
     were changed though, so my dread elf was still of much use to me...
     JC: Ok I read over the code that controls this and I see no
     possible way this could happen.  All the stats are promoted the
     same way so they should either all promote correctly or none of
     them should promote correctly.  So I played a test game and cast
     Touch of God onto my Wood Elf.  On the 4th kill he was promoted to
     a Dread Elf.  The only thing wrong with him was that his
     manuverability didn't promote right (I forgot to promote that stat
     in the code).  So the Manuverability stat promotion is NOW FIXED.

 55. FD: I saw once (I think it was when a wizard had just been killed)
     a string like "Movement points= -98.50). I can't remember the
     exact circumstance unfortunately. JC: I looked over the code and I
     only saw 1 place where this could be theoretically possible so I
     rewrote that piece of code. ALLEGEDLY NOW FIXED.

 56. FD: Something has changed about shadow wood. It seems to me that
     they don't attack anymore when computer-controlled. JC: NOW FIXED.

 57. FD: I cast alter reality on a wizard's mount and it was turned
     into a goblin bomb. However, the goblin bomb did not explode when
     I killed it. It should explode, but should the riding wizard be
     harmed too ? I think so but ? JC: That's hilarious! You come up
     with the weirdest stuff! :) With clever rewriting of the
     Reinstate() function I was able to make mounted Goblin Bombs
     explode as usual. NOW FIXED. Goblin Bombs have never harmed the
     cell that they are in. I have now hacked in some extra code so
     that they now damage a mounted wizard. Same thing for the Volcano.
     NOW FIXED.

 58. FD: I vanished a horse into the future, and it reappeared some
     turns later in the rightmost column. But the drawn area was 1
     pixel too wide, damaging the spell selection graphics. This was
     refreshed very quickly though. Actually, this seems to happen
     everytime something is drawn in the last column.  JC: I think it
     only happens during the CellEffects TELEPORTIN and TELEPORTOUT.
     NOW FIXED.

 59. FD: When a creature gets promoted, its manoeuvrability recovery is
     reset, not kept. JC: NOW FIXED.

 60. FD: A sleeping ghoul is still animated and scavenging. I can't
     remember exactly how it happened, but this could be due to
     impurities. JC: NOW FIXED.

 61. FD: If a computer wizard has a solar, then the solar does not
     move. JC: NOW FIXED.

 62. FD: It would be nice, in the bonus panel, if the number of spells
     to pick was decreased each time I pick a spell. JC: NOW DONE.

 63. FD: During spell selection, when I press "c", it shows me where I
     can cast the spell under the mouse pointer. But then I must click
     elsewhere to be able to press "c" again on another spell. It would
     be nice if we could press "c" on different spells without having
     to click in between. JC: This is a problem with _all_ keypresses,
     not just the "c" key. Originally I programmed all keypresses to
     work exactly the way you describe. Then one day Sean changed it. I
     didn't like it but I assumed he had a good reason for it so I
     decided not to mess with it until someone complained about it.
     NOW FIXED.

 64. Included Stephen's Magyar spell descriptions A-Z.  They still need
     to be spell-checked.

 65. A: It seems that there is something wrong with support for HUPL
     fonts - I checked them in DPaint and all polish chars are OK and
     in proper "places".  But Chaos doesn't seem to use them - only
     script font (ChaosHUPL) seems to be used when proper option is
     enabled. All other fonts (ChaosCalligraphy & ChaosPearl) seems to
     be used in original versions - not their HUPL equivalents. :/ JC:
     The problem was that I closed the old fonts and opened all the new
     ones correctly but that is not enough. The fonts must be plugged
     into every rastport and screen in the game. NOW FIXED.

Improvements from 3.01 to 3.02
------------------------------

  1. FLAW: In Ruthlessness mode, flying creatures seem to take about 6x
     longer to move than in regular mode.  This is noticeable on my
     25Mhz 030 but perhaps not noticeable on faster machines.  NOW
     FIXED.

  2. FLAW: The "m" key can take up to 1/3 of a second.  The above fix
     now makes the "m" key around 10x as fast (in other words, back to
     being as fast as it was supposed to be).

  3. FLAW: Computer creatures in Ruthlessness mode take up to 6x longer
     to decide who to shoot.  NOW FIXED.

  4. FD: A (allied) computer wizard cast 3 pits around a generator in a
     corner.  He had 5 pits left to cast, and he could do so around a
     generator on a border, but he chose to cancel the spell. JC: He
     didn't actually cancel the spell. He cast the wall pieces into
     various parts of your computer's memory :) This triggered jillions
     of enforcer hits on my machine. This bug happened when a computer
     player tried to surround something that was on the edge of the
     map. ALL NOW FIXED.

  5. FD: When Virtue kills a bonus creature (white dragon, stone golem
     etc), no bonus spell is awarded. JC: NOW FIXED. Btw: There are
     only 3 bonus spell creatures that Virtue currently kills: White
     Dragon, Stone Golem and Air Elemental.

  6. FLAW: No points are awarded for killing creatures with Virtue.
     NOW FIXED.

  7. FD: An independent red dragon was engaged to one of my undead
     inanimages, but he was also adjacent to my dragon nest, which was
     the only object he could attack. However, he did not attack the
     dragon nest, he just shot it.  This makes me think he tried to
     attack the undead inanimage, which is stupid since the dragon is
     intelligent enough to see it's an undead. JC: This is a flaw that
     has always existed. NOW FIXED in both normal mode and Ruthlessness
     mode.

  8. FD: My wizard just vanished because of impurities ! First time I
     see this !  JC: Actually the line of code that allowed impurities
     to vanish things was commented out for some reason. I have just
     now reinstated it.

  9. FD: Actually, he was vanished by an independent chronomancer. JC:
     HOORAY for the Chronomancer!!!!! He actually did something useful!
     He vanished your most valuable asset! FD: The trouble is that 1)
     he has not reappeared for a very very long time. I guess this is
     because there are no empty cells on the board. They all have at
     least a corpse. 2) I don't have access to the menues to quit the
     game 3) What if the board was full of independents ?  The game
     would never end and I would never get the chance to select a menu
     ! I'm now on turn 148 and my wizard still hasn't reappeared. He was
     vanished around turn 80 ! I'm including the autosave. I think this
     is because the world is full of corpses. The vanished objects
     should be given a chance to reappear on a corpse after, say, 10
     turns, or in place of another (random) object that would be
     vanished in turn. JC: Ok I have investigated the WarpIn() code
     that controls the reappearance of warped creatures and yes, indeed
     your problem was caused by all those corpses. I tested the new
     code on FD's supplied savegame. NOW FIXED.

 10. FD: When a creature which has +4 scavenging and only 1 point to
     heal, it's still displaying life +4. JC: I have adjusted it to
     show the amount that it actually scavenges. Tested and works
     perfectly. NOW FIXED.

 11. BUG: Using the "m" key on an engaged creature sometimes produces
     somewhat wrong results.  NOW FIXED.

 12. RS: I tried the Brustroem's Browser spell. I used the spell and
     look into the different spell books. But when I wanted to choose a
     spell, the game did not let me choose from my list but from the
     list of player 2. I attached a savegame. JC: Ok the last time I
     fixed Burstroem's Browser I wrote the right code but I put it in
     the wrong place. This means that for the last 4 months the spell
     has been letting people CHEAT and cast spells from other people's
     spell lists! NOW FIXED.

 13. Added the 7 yes/no type strings to all the .catalog files.

 14. SAI: Speaking of the info panels I've recently decided it would be
     nice to be able to see the life of a creature by simply placing
     the mouse over it.  JC: How about at the bottom of the screen:
     Wizard 1 (Sean) Life 19 NOW DONE.

Improvements from 3.02 to 3.03
------------------------------

  1. BUG: M key shows that I can attack undeads when really I can't.
     NOW FIXED.

  2. FLAW: The scroll panel does not 100% handle spell descriptions
     that are not all on 1 line.  NOW FIXED.

  3. Added code WaitVBlank(2); to all the keypresses so that, for
     example, when you are holding down the "s" key to see where you
     can shoot, the flashing is more solid and pleasing to the eye.

  4. Ran FD's ReflowSpells.rexx script on the English spell
     descriptions.  It didn't flow them like I wanted.  It went well
     beyond the defined LineLength var.  So I changed the script a bit
     and now it flows EXACTLY like Cygnus Ed Professional does
     (Format/WithoutFill).

  5. Casting Brain Boost on a creature with max intelligence now raises
     its intelligence recovery by 1 point.

  6. REWROTE Double and Triple spell descriptions to say that you cannot
     double or triple any spell which grants multiple attempts.

  7. BUG: When 3 lines of text are displayed in the bottom text area of
     the main screen, lines 2 and 3 overlap each other a bit.  NOW
     FIXED.

  8. FD: I was asked a very strange question: "comrade nobody, would it
     be OK for you if I put this weak wall there next to your nothing
     ?" :-D ROFL !  JC: NOW FIXED.

  9. FD: The answer to the question that was accepted was "y" and not
     "o" as is supposed to be in french mode. NOW FIXED.

 10. CHANGED Wood Elf to require 5 kills to promote to Dread Elf. After
     extensive playtesting I have come to the conclusion that a Dread
     Elf is just to powerful to be allowed after only 4 kills. It
     should be changed to 5 or 6. Btw: it was _originally_ 5 kills when
     Sean first implemented it so I'm just setting it back like it was.

 11. FLAW?: Turning off algorythmic sounds does not affect the sound of
     the standard algorythmic "attack" sound.  NOW FIXED.

 12. Problem: Special combat attacks take too long when there are many
     special combat attackers on the board.  I made a new
     CellEffectList function and rewrote the SpecialCombatHandler so
     that all the special combat graphical effects of a particular
     creature happen simultaneously for up to 8x speed improvement.
     NOW FIXED.

 13. Robin and FD want your artifacts to go back to NOBODY when your
     wizard dies (instead of having them fall asleep).  NOW DONE.

 14. Problem: Computer-controlled flying creatures keep choosing to
     attack earthquakes when they should really be attacking the nearby
     enemy creatures.  This is because earthquakes are set to have 15
     combat for some reason.  I have now changed earthquakes to have 0
     combat.  Is this ok?  NOW FIXED.

 15. Added: FD's new EndTurnSelect.iff and QuestionMarkSelect.iff

 16. Edited / Antialiased QuestionMark.iff and QuestionMarkSelect.iff

 17. FD says Agents should be highlighted while casting spells.  I
     looked into this and there was already code to do this.  However
     they weren't highlighted until the instant that the spell was
     about to be cast.  I have now changed this so that the creature is
     highlighted immediately, before any text is printed to the screen.
     Thus the creature will now be highlighted for a longer period of
     time, without making anything take longer and without slowing the
     game down any.  Hopefully this will be good enough.  NOW DONE.

 18. ADDED Highlighting of real Generators because I like the Agent
     highlighting so much.

 19. Random Bug: Sometimes when the game loads Mod.ChaosTheme1, infinite
     enforcer hits are generated and all the fonts are destroyed.
     Assembled FD's new misca.asm for the music system to hopefully fix
     the above bug.

 20. UNBELIEVABLY STUPID!  All wizards are in an alliance against 99
     generators.  One of the computer wizards cast Coercion on turn 3!
     Now we are all going to get killed because of this!  NOW FIXED.

 21. FLAW: There is never an exophagy icon on my powerups list.  NOW
     FIXED.

 22. FLAW: The score column is not positioned well on the score screen.
     My score on turn 92 is 11602 thus placing it up against the Life
     value.  NOW FIXED.

 23. FLAW: Score screen score column is WAY out of position when
     playing in Deutsch or Polski.  NOW FIXED.

 24. BUG: Load any saved game and look at the score screen.  The life
     totals have not been freshly calculated so they are wrong.  NOW
     FIXED.

 25. FD: Uncertainty suffers from the same flow as vanish did before
     you fixed it. If there are many corpses, it will almost never
     generate anything. JC: I changed this so that it can now generate
     onto empty squares or onto dead bodies. NOW FIXED.

Improvements from 3.03 to 3.04
------------------------------

  1. EDITED Magic Carpet and Chainsaw graphics a bit.

  2. PROBLEM: I hate the animation of the Bolter.  So I just now
     changed it to something else.  It is now somewhat better than
     before, but still not very good.  Someone needs to fix this up.

  3. FD: A wizard just cast poison dagger on its own bolter.
     Considering that a bolter can never attack, this is kinda stupid.
     JC: NOW FIXED.

  4. FD: When dismounting, the "M" key shows a lot of places where I
     cannot move (I have wizard wings+speed but I can only move one
     square in this situation). JC: NOW FIXED.

  5. Aaaaaaugh!  Reveal was set to only be a ranking of 4!  This is why
     computer wizards never cast it on anyone!  I am now raising it to
     44 so that, basically, if they _can_ cast it on an enemy then they
     will.

  6. Sean and Frédéric both hate the green square for cloaked
     creatures. This same green square is also used to draw unexplored
     squares. Also FD has complained that the Cloak graphic is easily
     confused with the X-Ray graphic. So I have now drawn a new Cloak
     graphic which is used for 3 things: 1. As the graphic for the
     Cloak spell. 2. As the graphic for a cloaked creature. 3. As the
     graphic for an unexplored square. If you do not like this graphic
     then you are free to draw a better one and it will automagically
     appear in the game.

  7. CHANGED Earthquakes back to 15 combat and adjusted the
     DangerousnessRating() routine to ignore combat, ranged combat,
     etc. when rating an inanimate object. I did this so that a person
     could cast theoretically cast No Grow then Stone to Flesh on an
     Earthquake and have a powerful max combat creature. I realize this
     will hardly ever happen. But it only needs to happen once for it
     to be all worthwhile.

Improvements from 3.04 to 3.05
------------------------------

  1. ADDED 16 new spells including: 1 artifact creature 2 other normal
     creatures 1 meditation object 12 magic spells: 1. Global
     Thermonuclear War 2.  Conwell's Cow Catapult 3. Heal 4. Vox
     Angelica 5. Vox Celestes 6.  Resurrection 7. Magic Carpet 8.
     Tribal Dance 9. Chainsaw 10. Shambling Mound 11. Stomp 12.
     Delacroix's Decloaker 13. Night of the Living Dead 14.  Hand
     Grenade 15. Feeble 16. Martyr

  2. Chaos now has 365 spells!  1 for every day of an Earth year!

  3. Included Xav's new Feeble, Hand Grenade, and Tribal Dance gfx.  I
     put Explosion and Kamikaze into gfx/UnusedGfx/ for future use.  I
     edited his new Martyr graphic to show the Martyr hanging high up
     on the wall.

  4. I Made a new level: Equivalency1 to test all the new spells.  It
     is 1 human-controlled wizard vs. 1 computer-controlled wizard.
     Both wizards have an identical spell list.

  5. PROBLEM: When an archer loses his archery ability the arcing weapon
     effect is still drawn.  NOW FIXED.

  6. PROBLEM: When a creature that is normally not an archer, gains the
     archery ability, the straight-line weapon effect is still drawn.
     I have now fixed this to make it draw the arcing weapon effect.
     NOW FIXED.

  7. SAI: I liked the multiattack made by trees, ropers, fungi, etc.
     The only problem is that they make the attack sound even when
     there is nothing for them to attack. JC: NOW FIXED.

  8. SAI: The sound made by a computer controlled Shadow Wood is a nice
     "whoosh", but when a Shadow Wood controlled by a human player
     attacks, it is only the traditional attack sound. JC: I am playing
     a test game right now and both human and computer controlled
     Shadow Woods are making the same whoosh sound. Perhaps you meant
     Dark Woods? Or perhaps you meant Stone to Flesh'd Shadow Woods? or
     ?

  9. SAI: The Consecrate spell wraps off the edge of the screen. JC:
     NOW FIXED.

 10. Added the Gadget to control Ruthlessness on the 2nd setup screen.

 11. Added Ruthlessness to the ascii prefs routines.

 12. Added code to play a special mod when casting a spell if there is
     one in the Sounds/CastingMod/ dir.  Atm, the only spell with a
     CastingMod is Tribal Dance.

 13. Added code to play a special sound sample when casting a spell if
     there is one in the Sounds/CastingSounds/ dir.  Atm, the only
     spells with special casting sounds are Vox Celestes, Vox Angelica
     and Blonde.

 14. Added Artur's T Polski spell descriptions.

 15. Added SF's spell-corrected Magyar spell descriptions (A-Z)

 16. Added Artur's Q-S Polski spell descriptions.

 17. Added Combat sucking sound for Mind Flayer.

 18. Added FallingIntoPit.8svx for when you fall into a pit.

 19. Added SpecialCombatShocker.8svx for special combat attacks by
     creatures with MAX_COMABAT (Shocker)

 20. spot^up donated a really cool mod for use in the game!  I haven't
     added it into the game yet.

 21. CastingTwirl.8svx and CastingUndeadTwirl.8svx for use when casting
     creatures.  We still need to come up with a sound for inanimates.
     The sounds sound very cool!  But they don't really go well with the
     casting beam sound.  Any ideas what to do about this?

 22. REMOVED the code that auto-plays CastingSounds/spellname.  I think
     it will work better to have the spells specially programmed to
     play the sounds.

Improvements from 3.05 to 3.06
------------------------------

  1. Put in 13.5 megs of new ChaosThemeSongs (11-60) Music/ dir is now
     17.5 megs (17551558 bytes) We now have some spooky tunes, some
     beautiful guitar tunes, some heavy duty brain-thrashing,
     mind-melting tunes, some wonderous magical tunes and others. Amiga
     Rulez da Muzik Scene! EXTRA SPECIAL THANKS TO ALL THE MUSICIANS
     WHO CONTRIBUTED MUSIC! (Complete list in the docs)

  2. We now have some VERY small mods that can work even in very low
     memory situations. 15k, 51k, 55k

  3. We now have 4 VERY large mods (over 600K) that will only work on
     systems with 2 megs of chipram.  If you don't have a LARGE
     contiguous hunk of chipram free then you will never hear these in
     the game.  All 4 of these mods are of the "orchestral" variety so
     if you are tired of hearing a "hardcore 90's rave soundtrack" all
     the time then free up some chipram so you can hear these moving
     musical masterpieces.

  4. Well I was hanging around not really feeling like doing much of
     anything when I suddenly thought up an idea for why the Ghost and
     other long sound samples sometimes freak out and crash the
     computer. I thought perhaps the WaitJCSound() routine's use of
     FindPort() could be disabling multitasking for long periods of
     time. So I looked up FindPort() on the developer CD to see if
     there were any warnings that it disables multitasking for long
     periods of time and... YIKERZ! I found something much worse! It
     has a warning that it does NOT disable multitasking AT ALL so that
     ANY and ALL uses of FindPort() must be surrounded with Forbid()
     and Permit() !!! So maybe this has been causing all those weird
     random audio problems?!???? I made the appropriate changes and
     played the Ghost sound 60 times under various CPU loads and it
     never messed up! If this was the problem it would totally explain:
     1. The random nature of the bug. 2. The random mess ups of the
     JCsound, audio.device sound, and maybe even the subsongs! 3. The
     fact that the problem only seems to affect _long_ JCsound samples.
     A long sample means WaitJCSound() is calling FindPort() over and
     over and over again, waiting for it to end. I am very happy about
     finding this! Now we need to heavily test this to see if all audio
     problems are now fixed!

  5. BUG: If for some reason you have no music files in the music/ dir,
     the game crashes.  I always wondered why in the WORLD this
     happened!?  Now I know it was because of the FindPort() outside of
     Forbid().

  6. Artur fixed the English Higher Devil and Lesser Devil spell
     descriptions.  (There was a double "from").

  7. I added the sentence "Hyperclone will not replicate your wizard."
     to the Hyperclone spell description.  I also edited the first
     sentence.

  8. I removed the sentence "The powerful magic used in this spell
     usually produces a horrific, mutated copy of your wizard as a side
     effect." from the Lich Lord spell description.

  9. Zoltan complained about the Range Boost description so I fixed it
     up.

 10. BUG: JJ reports that growths assist in the control of artifacts.
     Only creatures are supposed to assist in the control of artifacts.
     NOW FIXED.

 11. FLAW: JJ reports that Biohazard MeltScreen effect lasts toooo long.
     I have now reduced it from 100 iterations down to 70.  NOW FIXED.

 12. Added all the musician's names to ChaosDocs.texinfo.

 13. Added the following default combat sounds for creatures who do not
     have a defined combat sound: Swoosh SwooshUgh BigSwooshUgh
     BigSwooshUuugh! (15 combat hit against creature) SwooshThud (These
     are used for attacking inanimates) BigSwooshThud SwooshOnMetal
     (These are used for attacking Robot or Dalek) BigSwooshOnMetal
     BigSwoosh (All BigSwoosh sounds are used for combat>=12) All 9 of
     the above sound samples combined together = only 42k!
     BigSwooshUgh is used thusly: volume=64 for 14 combat volume=60 for
     13 combat volume=56 for 12 combat SwooshUgh is used for any combat
     hit 6-11.  Volume is always 52 for this one. 6-11 = SwooshUgh
     Swoosh v=28 for 0 combat v=32 for 1 combat v=36 for 2 combat v=40
     for 3 combat v=44 for 4 combat v=48 for 5 combat samplespeed =
     8363 for all above samples. For now attacking a growth will play
     either "Swoosh" or "BigSwoosh" with no ughs.  When I find a
     suitable squishy sound I can change this to SwooshSquish and
     BigSwooshSquish. In order to implement the above sounds I had to
     change CellEffect() to take an extra paremeter for the volume.
     Then I had to spend a whole hour changing hundreds of occurrences
     of CellEffect() to have the extra parameter added. After I did
     this I once again got the dreaded >32768 error on cast.c.

 14. BUG: I've been noticing the computer controlled creatures are
     playing really stupidly even though I have Ruthlessness turned on.
     When I created the gadget for Ruthlessness I forgot to connect
     the Ruthlessness variable to it!  So Ruthlessness mode has not
     actually been working for the last week.  NOW FIXED.

 15. BUG: Mod.ChaosTheme18 starts out ok but then it starts playing too
     slowly after a while.  I have now converted it to MED MMD1 so now
     it works correctly.  NOW FIXED.

 16. BUG: A line of code was in the Growth() routine and was executed
     outside of any semaphore lock on the board! A big no no! NOW FIXED.

 17. FLAW: The last generator that generated something is still
     highlighted all throughout the Growth() phase.  NOW FIXED.

 18. FLAW: The last Agent/generator that casted/generated something
     still has text left over at the bottom of the screen during the
     Growth() phase.  NOW FIXED.

 19. NEW GFX FEATURE: I have now added code to keep animations of Green
     Ooze, Orange Jellies and Earthquakes synchronized so they look
     much better now.  This code executes at the end of the Growth()
     function.  Tested and works perfectly.

 20. 3 NEW KEYPRESSES: f for "feeling range" h for "hearing range" o for
     "olfactory range" (o = olfactory = smell)

 21. FLAW: Heal and Vox spells erroneously print a promotion message.
     NOW FIXED.

 22. Included FD's reflowed and corrected Français spell descriptions.

 23. Reflowed all Magyar Spell Descriptions.

 24. BUG: Computer wizard had 3.5 movement points but moved 3.8 squares
     to mount his horse!  NOW FIXED.

 25. BUG: Grizzly Bear had 2.5 movement points but he moved 2.8 squares
     to attack me! NOW FIXED.

 26. PROBLEM: the casting beam sound is too loud compared to the sound
     of the casting twirl effect.  This is because all algorythmically
     generated sfx use a perfectly oscillating square wave.  So I have
     now reduced the volume of algorythmic sounds from 40 down to 32
     and now everything sounds better.  NOW FIXED.

 27. I drew a new Dark Citadel graphic.

Improvements from 3.06 to 3.07
------------------------------

  1. The color cycling of Special Combat on the info panel has always
     been unsatisfactory and crappy looking.  Now I see why I put off
     fixing this for so long.  It just took me 2 hours to get it all
     working correctly.  NOW FIXED.

  2. Mod.ChaosTheme60 was playing much to slowly so I converted it to
     MED format. DONE.

  3. BUG: When a creature is promoted they lose their exophagy and
     scavenging powerups!  NOW FIXED.

  4. I finally added a (lame) chainsaw sound for the chainsaw.  We can
     now easily add new "weapon spells" that cause a certain sound to
     be played during combat.  Someone needs to take a chainsaw out and
     cut some wood with it and record it.  Especially the sound of it
     getting jammed up in the wood.

  5. Must modify promotion() to keep the new .WeaponSoundStat intact.
     DONE.

  6. PARAGRAPH BREAKS are now supported in the spell descriptions! Now
     we don't have to have long run-on super-huge spell descriptions
     all in 1 giant paragraph. I tested this by editing the
     descriptions for Points, Devastation, Alliance and Standard Wall.
     It works great and looks much nicer, especially on Devastation! I
     suppose someone should go over all the spell descriptions and see
     if they need paragraph breaks and put them in.  I'm really unclear
     as to where to place paragraph breaks. It often seems like we need
     one after almost every sentence. Note to FD: I hope this doesn't
     break any Arexx->AmigaGuide document scripts or anything.

  7. Robin sent in some Deutsch spell-descriptions (A-E).

  8. I sent a COMPLETE English spells archive to Robin and Wolverine
     today.

  9. I implemented help screens. They are attached to the help key.
     These are mainly for newbie neophytes on their very first game.
     But the "Help/Show me all the keys" option will be useful to
     everyone all the time. If you press help/What do I do now!?!? then
     it is context sensitive depending on what phase of the game you
     are in (spell selection, spell casting or movement).

 10. Included Xav's bugfixed new Generator gfx into the game.

 11. FIXED Golden Dragon description: It said "vain" instead of "vein".

 12. CHANGED: the highlight sprite from #3 to #2 and adjusted the asm
     code in the vain hope that it will now work in dblpal.

 13. MYSTERIOUS BUG: Every once in a while, after I've been playing the
     game for a long time and I am running lots of other programs, I
     will go to save the game and the save game screen will freak out
     and cause lots of enforcer hits and not print the word "SAVE"
     along the side of the screen. This has happened several times over
     the last several months. I finally figured out what it was! The
     reason the bug only happened randomly is that, normally if you
     close a font it is still there in memory and your pointer will
     still work, unless you get low on memory or manually force a flush
     of all unused resources such as typing "avail flush" in the shell.
     NOW FIXED.

 14. Included Xav's new Wood Elf and Dread Elf into the game.

 15. I replaced wizard graphic #3 with Xav's Club Juggler, at least
     until we go to 32x32 256 color tiles.

 16. Robin reports some flaws in the spell descriptions: Meddle (change
     than->the).

 17. Included Xav's new Dire Wolf and Arctic Wolf into the game.  They
     are very blurry but oh well... I'll be glad when we make a hires
     version.

 18. Included Xav's new Gray Elf.  He's a bit tall for an Elf but oh
     well..

 19. Chaos needs a website!  But there is no point in having a website
     without screenshots!  But everyone on Team Chaos says the same
     thing "I don't know how to make a screenshot of Chaos".  Well I
     can't wait any longer for someone to figure this stuff out sooo....

 20. Spent some hours investigating all the screengrabbers on Aminet.
     NONE of them claimed to work with a multiscreen view so I didn't
     dl any of them.  The one grabber that I TRIED to download, I
     couldn't because my ISP sux SO BADLY that it would dl at 60 cps
     for 15 mins and then just abort. :(

 21. Xav made a new super-cool 42-frame animation of a worm.  This
     crashes the game.  Its all because I forgot to add in the code to
     go from the first row down to the 2nd row and etc.  NOW FIXED.

Improvements from 3.07 to 3.1
-----------------------------

  1. Included Xav's hilarious new Amphisbaena animation!

  2. STUPID: When playing with artifacts, computer wizards frequently
     cast Alliance on artifacts belonging to NOBODY.  NOW FIXED.

  3. STUPID: Sometimes computer players cast alliance onto people who
     are already on their team!  NOW FIXED.

  4. STUPID: When playing a game 1 human vs 7 enemy wizards who are all
     on the same team against the human, eventually 1 of the wizards
     will cast Alliance onto the human then EVERYBODY is on the same
     team!  NOW FIXED.

  5. STUPID: Computer players refuse to ever cast a double or triple
     alliance spell.  NOW FIXED.

  6. Hacked and slashed Attila the Hun's labyrinth generation algorithm
     into Chaos and tested it about 40 times.  It worked perfectly
     every time!  Only playtesting will reveal if this new option will
     be any fun or not.  Hopefully it will at least be an interesting
     diversion to try out from time to time.

  7. Added code to properly put together Power Walls. What should this
     new option be called? I was originally going to call it Maze Wars
     but it isn't exactly a maze. More of a dungeon. Here are some
     ideas for naming this option: Maze Wars Maze Fight Dungeon Dungeon
     Wars Dungeon Fight

  8. Added code for secondary and tertiary constructs.

  9. Added DungeonWars to the savegamefile io.c and to the prefs.c

 10. Added the Dungeon Wars gadget to the setupscreen 2.

 11. Made 126 tiles for the upcoming Tower.

 12. Made 72 ID's for the upcoming Tower.

 13. BUG: When a creature with a Telescope is promoted, it loses its
     Telescope.  NOW FIXED.

 14. BUG: Any creature which is given any enhanced sight, smell,
     hearing or feeling will lose those enhancements when promoted.
     NOW FIXED.

 15. Edited the website a bunch.

 16. FD: BTW, I think Chaos does not correctly handle saved games with
     a space in the name. Probably quotes missing in the lha command
     line.  W FIXED.

 17. Included Wolverine's new Magyar.catalog.

 18. FLAW: Every time you start a game the 1st dungeon is the same as
     the 1st dungeon of the last time you loaded the game.  2nd is the
     same as the 2nd, etc.  rnd_seek is now loaded from
     IntuitionBase->Micros so this is NOW FIXED.

 19. FLAW: If you play Dungeon Wars mode with 99 generators, the board
     is pretty much solid on turn 1 with _many_ generators blocked off.
     NOW FIXED.

 20. BUG: If you start a game with 99 Generators and 99 scrolls and 99
     artifacts The game gets stuck in an infinite loop.  NOW FIXED.

 21. Allow generators to be placed on empty squares OR in place of
     inanimate objects OR on top of dead bodies OR on top of scrolls.
     DONE.

 22. Allow scrolls to be placed under generators, under the dungeon
     pieces or in empty spaces or on top of dead bodies. DONE.

 23. Allow artifacts to be placed on top of scrolls, on top of dead
     bodies or into empty squares. DONE.

 24. BUG: If you play with Dungeon Wars + 99 generators + 99 artifacts
     then the game still gets stuck in an infinite loop because there
     isn't enough room to place all the artifacts.  NOW FIXED.  TESTED
     and works perfectly!

 25. Problem: I can't stand the way Standard Walls look on the Dungeon
     Wars maps.  The color between the bricks looks very bad IMHO.  It
     should either be a _very_ dark red or black.  NOW FIXED.

 26. Problem: I can't stand the way Weak Walls look either.  The color
     between the bricks should be either a _very_ dark yellow or black.
     NOW FIXED.

 27. Problem: The Hwall and Vwall pieces of Power Walls don't look so
     good when they are the last piece on the end and not connected to
     anything.  NOW FIXED.

 28. PROBLEM: Lha 2.1 is buggy and crashes the machine, which is why I
     use lha 1.35.  However, users with lha 2.1 seem to have an lhaopts
     file which uses parameters that don't work on lha 1.35.  This
     causes game saving and loading to not work.  So I have now hacked
     lha 1.35 to NOT try to read the lhaopts file.  NOW FIXED.

 29. The translation of "Magic Resistance" in the Magyar.catalog is
     "Mágia ellenállóképesség" which is wayyy tooooo long to fit on
     the  info panel.  I am shortening it down to Mágia Ellenállás.

 30. Manõverezhetõség is also toooo long. I am shortening it to
     Manõver.

 31. Generated the IP1 screen for Magyar finally.

 32. Put Ruthlessness and Dungeon Wars into the ChaosDocs.texinfo then
     sent it to FD.

 33. Made the first couple of screenshots of Chaos.

 34. Included Robin's new OPQ Deutsch descriptions.

 35. NEW GFX: Included Xav's great new Optometron of Omniscience and
     Exit gfx!

 36. I updated HelpWanted.html, installation.html, requirements.html,
     legal.html, features.html, chaos.html and index.html,
     HelpWanted.html a bit.

 37. STUPID: If you shoot your allied wizard repeatedly he won't cast
     his Separation spell if he has one.  NOW FIXED.  Above fix meant I
     had to change the gamesave format so I went ahead and added in the
     the 2 WORDs for the 5 leather armors and 5 chainmails spells +
     added in some unused LONGs while I was at it. DONE.

 38. You can shoot an allied wizard who has a reflector and it won't
     make him mad.

 39. You can shoot an allied wizard or any allied creation with 0 or
     negative combat and it won't make him mad.  In fact, shooting your
     allies with healing combat will make them like you more.  Tested
     and works perfectly!

@Prev "3_07-3_1"
@Toc "HistoryMenu"

Improvements from 3.1 to 3.3
----------------------------

  1. Implemented Towers. The mystical powers of the Magic Tower allow
     it to absorb the essence of any creature who enters it. The Tower
     starts out very short but as it becomes more powerful it grows in
     size. Any creature entering a tower adds all of its primary
     statistcs to the statistics of the Tower. Once a creature enters a
     tower it can never leave because its essence becomes one with the
     tower in a permanent and unbreakable bond.  Wizards cannot enter
     towers.

  2. STUPID: Computer wizards sometimes cast Cartagraphy, Telescope,
     Seismology and Alternography when the game is not even in
     exploration mode!  NOW FIXED.

  3. SAI: I had a quick game of Chaos last night. The only stupid thing
     I noticed was when my own Mullac de Irvine decided to cast an
     earthquake right next to my wizard. Naturally, I gave the Mullac a
     war[n/m]ing blast from my dragon and he didn't do it again. JC:
     Hehehe. Ok I have now adjusted the AI so that computer-controlled
     spellcasters will not cast Earthquakes adjacent to friendly
     wizards. Unless the friendly wizard has an Earthquake shield, then
     they might cast it there anyway. NOW FIXED.

  4. DITTO for Floods and Fires.

  5. Included Robin's new Power Wall description into the game.

  6. Activated the Chaos website and uploaded all the files.  It works
     ok but all the fonts seem too small.

  7. BUG: An allied computer wizard might still cast Earthquake
     adjacent to one of his allied wizards if he is meditating in an
     enemy meditation.  The trouble is that SameTeam() gets confused
     when Wizards are inside of enemy objects.  NOW FIXED.

  8. ADDED: Special Combat now plays the creature's special attack
     sound from Sounds/Combat/ just like regular combat does.  This was
     needed for Wasp Nest and Grim Reaper.

  9. NEW CREATURE: Grim Reaper.  Stats, animation, sound and description
     designed by Robin!  I put this one in first since he did the whole
     package himself which freed my mind to concentrate on coding.  I
     tested the new creature and he seems to work ok.  He's very tricky
     to use, especially in Dungeon Wars mode.

 10. Added sound effects for Wasp Nest and Grim Reaper to the
     Sounds/Combat/ dir.

 11. BUG: There was no WaitJCsound() in the CellEffectList() routine so
     the long sound effects of 1 special combat thing could overlap
     into the special combat of another thing.  NOW FIXED.

 12. 2 new wizard names: When you start the game there are now 2 new
     possibilities for the random wizard names: Robin Hood in honor of
     Robin Schmidt. King Artur in honor of Artur Chlebek.

 13. Updated contacts.html some more.

 14. 3 NEW SPELLS: Ditzy Blonde, Winged Elf Boots and Anger.

 15. 2 NEW SPELLS: Worm and Blood Worm.

 16. Included Xav's damagable Weak Wall, Strong Wall and Standard Wall.
     I implemented the proramming for them and then played a test game.
     WORKS GREAT!

 17. Included Xav's damagable Rock.  I smoothed many (all?) of the Rock
     pieces.

 18. EDITED: The Amphisbaena to have the word balloon over his head.

 19. I DREW: 8 additional damaged variations of Power Wall Center,
     Power Wall Vertical and Power Wall Horizontal.

 20. INCLUDED: The new damaged Power Wall variations into the game.

 21. BUG: Destroy Wall and Animate spells totally do not work with the
     new multi-damageable variations of walls system.  NOW FIXED.

 22. Artur _finally_ sent in a 50% translation of the game. (He
     promised it would be done by Jan 2nd, 2001)

 23. Spent several hours compiling/testing/archiving/sending Artur his
     v3.04re version of chaos.

 24. Spent 1 hour investigating why the png gfx of the website work on
     all amiga webbrowsers and on MSIE but not on linux or netscape mac.

 25. BUG: I put chainsaw on my ghost and it didn't make the chainsaw
     noise!  (when I attacked a red dragon) Ok right now it is set so
     that if a creature already has an attack sound then it just keeps
     playing the normal attack sound when you have a chainsaw. The
     chainsaw noise is only played on creatures who have no attack
     sound. Should this be changed? I think the answer is yes. NOW
     FIXED.

 26. INCLUDED: Xav's new Free and Free All gfx into the game.

 27. RS: Raise Dead: A powerful spell, if wisely used. The comupter,
     however, does not use it wisely: I played a game with all 8
     wizards in one team, against 26 generators. there happened some
     fierce combat and then a wizard who had the Depth power-up spoke
     the Raise Dead. But he didn't raise the Blue Dragon that was lying
     in front of him, no, he raised that stupid Fire Bat in some corner
     of the board?! How does the computer choose what corpus it raises?
     JC: OK I looked into this and it seems to be completely random!  I
     never knew that!?!

 28. STUPID: Raise Dead and Resurrection are cast completely randomly
     with _no_ AI whatsoever. I have now changed this to make it use
     the general Dangerousness() algorithm. NOW FIXED.

 29. Compiled v3.04d for Aminet.

 30. PROBLEM: I will soon be entering in 24 variations of the Lion.
     But I don't want to have to waste 24 identical dead images of the
     Lion so I need to implement Groups (of IDs) into the game.  NOW
     FIXED.

 31. Creatures need a Group: tag in the spell file.  If this tag is
     missing then Group = 0.  If Group==0 then there's no group.
     Otherwise Group is the ID to get the dead body information from.
     This way I don't have to have a jillion identical dead body images
     for every creature-variation!  Group tag added. DONE.

 32. InsertCorpse() and InsertCorpseUnder() must be modified to check
     for IF (InitialData(id).Group != 0) id=InitialData(id).Group; DONE.

 33. Included FD's new SpellsToTexInfo.rexx and his new paragraph fixed
     English and Français spell descriptions A-D.

 34. I split Readme.txt into 2 seperate files: History1997-1999.txt and
     History2000.txt.  I deleted Readme.txt since it really isn't
     intended for the general public to read.  It is just the history
     of implemented changes.

 35. BLOOD: Xav says that with the new bloody versions of the creatures
     the game will become a blood bath and some people may not like
     that.  Therefore we need a Blood on/off feature.  DONE.

 36. I put the Blood option on the setupscreen, the gamesave file and
     the prefs file.  DONE.

 37. BUG: The score of the independents is NOT saved with the game!!!!
     in score.c and io.c change MAX_WIZARDS to ENTITIES While I'm at it
     I'm going to convert all existing levels to have BloodMode=ON.
     Reload and resave ALL the levels using the new routine. NOW FIXED.

 38. Included FD's new ChaosDocs.texinfo fully updated for V3.1 of
     Chaos.

 39. Included the new setup screens including the new Blood option for
     English, Français and Deutsch.

 40. Included FD's new Paragraphized English and Français spell
     descriptions A-Z.

 41. Included FD's new scripts/ dir for making documentation related
     files.

 42. Included Krzynio's Polski ChaosLite.readme and Valwit's Deutsch
     ChaosLite.readme into the aminet v3.04 version.

 43. Uploaded v3.04 to Aminet with a readme in all 5 languages.  The
     Rosetta Stone of .readmes. :)  The purpose of this version is to
     have a 100% version sitting on Aminet during the months that it
     takes me to prepare the next MEGA release of Chaos.  Archive size
     is: 5933797 bytes.

 44. 12:01 a.m. I saw the new ChaosLite.lha (v3.04) materialize onto
     Aminet.

 45. 8:00 a.m. Updated the website contacts.html and downloads.html
     from Chaos v3.0 to Chaos v3.04.

 46. Implemented the complete new Lion. 72 tiles + 1 tile for the dead
     body.

 47. PROBLEM: When playing the game in English, the translated spell
     names are not shown at the bottom of the screen. Only the TRUE
     name of the creature is shown (such as "Lion wings d1"). This
     looks tacky. This has never really been correct but it has always
     been tolerable until now because we have so many jillions of
     damaged versions of objects. Ok I just made a simple change to the
     CreatureName() function so everything that prints the name of a
     creature in the whole program should now automagically work with
     this new system. NOW FIXED.

 48. BUG: Ack! Certain names of certain spells are totally wacked out in
     Français mode! Lion, Faun, Cobra work. Passage, Invulnerability,
     Vengeance, Justice, Abduction, Raise Dead, X-Ray, Unicorn do not
     work. Ok I just spent a whole hour investigating this problem. I
     _finally_ figured out what is going on! This is all because the
     lists of spell names in SpellDescriptions/#?.txt were not rebuilt
     after I added in the new spells!  These must be rebuilt each time
     a new spell is added. I'm going to change the makefile to delete
     them all each time I do a "smake clean" (like it used to do). NOW
     FIXED.

 49. GROUPS: I went back and put all power walls into 1 big group.  I
     also put all other damagable walls and rocks into their own
     individual groups.  This fixes foreign translation problems.

 50. FD: During special combat, "independents" is still printed at the
     bottom of the screen. JC: I just tested this and it didn't say
     "independents" but it did say range = 0" at the bottom. NOW FIXED.

 51. FD: When a creature comes back from the astral plane, during the
     subsequent spell selection, the player # key shows it as unmoved.
     Just a detail. JC: I propose that _all_ creatures should be set to
     unmoved during the spell selection phase. This has been bothering
     me for a long time. I always want to check how far a certain
     creature can move during my spell selection but I never can
     because they have all been set to "already moved". NOW FIXED.

 52. FD: My wizard mounted an independent flying carpet (BTW, I was
     quite surprised to see such a "creature" to be generated), but I
     cannot move the carpet. I can't even dismount. While this is OK
     for magic wood (but what would happen if someone casts stone to
     flesh on the tree I'm meditating in?), this is quite disturbing
     for creatures. JC: What is happening now is that the game checks
     if something is a Meditation. If its a Meditation and its empty
     then anyone can enter it, even if the meditation is a creature
     that belongs to someone else. Ok I just added in the line of code
     to prevent human wizards from mounting enemy meditation creatures.
     But now I am thinking I should have just left it the way it was.
     It sounds pretty cool that you can mount an enemy magic carpet in
     an emergency. You should eventually get a bonus spell out of it.
     But if you have only 1 enemy and you are mounted on his Magic
     Carpet then you'll be invulnerable because he won't attack his own
     stuff to get at your wizard. Is this an interesting strategic
     aspect? Or a bad design flaw? Aaaaaugh! I don't know what to do!
     I'm leaving the fix in since I already put it there. So the rules
     currently are: "You cannot mount any enemy creature." "You can
     mount an enemy inanimate object if it is a meditation object and
     nobody else is already mounted there."

 53. ADDED the code to prevent computer wizards from mounting enemy
     creature meditations to many AI routines and movement routines.
     This took 1 hour.

 54. I think it would be cool to be mounted on an enemy creature. You
     never know where he'll take you! You have some control over him.
     But he has some control over you too! It could be wild! On the
     other hand it might be stupid, if you have only 1 enemy because he
     would never attempt to harm his own creature. I didn't attempt to
     put this idea into the game because: 1.  You guys don't seem to
     like it. 2. There is a good chance that it will cause some secret
     side-effect bugs that will have to be debugged and I don't feel
     like working that hard on it right now. 3. Even if no new bugs get
     created, it will still take some time to think about all the AI
     routines and movmenet routines and how to modify them to work
     correctly with the new rule. 4. It might be a totally stupid idea.

 55. INCLUDED: Xav's new Centaur, Juju Zombie, Pox and really awesome
     Pegasus gfx!

 56. IMPLEMENTED: the complete new damagable Leopard (24 IDs, 73 tiles)
     and the new damagable Elephant (24 IDs, 97 tiles).

 57. There are now 3 damagable creatures in the game: Lion, Leopard,
     Elephant.  I guess that is enough until I hear back from people if
     they like them or don't like them or whatever.

 58. ANNOYING BUG: During the movement phase when you are moving your
     creatures around; when you click on an object to attack it the
     amount of life left in the object is not updated at the bottom of
     the screen.  In order to force the screen to update you must move
     the mouse entirely off the current square and then back onto that
     square.

 59. ANNOYING BUG: When you shoot an object, the life at the bottom is
     not updated until you move the mouse completely off the square and
     back onto it.

 60. ANNOYING BUG: When you shoot an undead object and kill it so that
     the square is now completely empty, the text at the bottom of the
     screen still says the name of the object that WAS there, not what
     is _currently_ there!  You must move the mouse completely off the
     square and back onto it again to see what is really there.

 61. ANNOYING BUG: When you kill a growth and the growth dies and
     reveals a covered creature, the text at the bottom of the screen
     STILL says you are pointed at the growth!  It doesn't update to
     show what you are REALLY pointing at now.  You must move the mouse
     pointer off the current square and back onto it to get it to
     update the text.

 62. ALL ANNOYING BUGS NOW FIXED!  (I put a Clearoxoy() everywhere
     there was a RecalculateAllDamagedObjects() + I put one at the end
     of SayCreatureName())

 63. PROBLEM: The Level Editor menus are about to overflow with all
     these bajillions of damaged object variations.  I have now changed
     it so that damaged variations of objects are not shown in the
     menus, only the original primary object is shown.  NOW FIXED.

 64. ADDED: code=far to the compilation of chaos.c.  Now Chaos.o is
     182564 bytes and the game compiles and links perfectly now!

 65. I improved the gfx for Uncertainty, Inanimorphobiosis and Mass
     Petrification.

 66. I had to go back through all 72 Tower spell files and add in a line
     Group: TowerLevel5ID to each one.  This should hopefully solve all
     on-screen translation problems.

 67. BUG: Magic Carpets NEVER collapse!  I had just assumed there was
     code in BoardUpdate() to go through and check all meditations and
     randomly collapse them.  But in fact, each object must be
     hardcoded in to be checked for.  I will rewrite it later.  For now
     I added MagicCarpetID to the list of things to check for.  NOW
     FIXED.

 68. BUG: Damaged objects don't make their attack sounds, death sounds
     or kill sounds!  NOW FIXED.

 69. I Changed the combat, death and kill sounds determination code to
     play the sound associated with that SPECIFIC ID.  If it doesn't
     have one then it checks if this thing is in a group and if it is
     then it uses the sound from the Groupid (if the Groupid has a
     sound).  This allows super maximum flexibility because now a
     Winged Lion could have a different kill, death or combat sound
     than the regular Lion.  There is no immediate need for this but
     the need will arise in the future.

 70. RS: There once was a T-Rex who came along to fight against me. I
     stopped it with some undeads and shot a Toxity Beam at it. Its
     magical resistance dropped him dead within three turns, but I
     wondered how it could continue fighting with its full strength of
     15, though it ought to loose one point per turn? JC: Thank you for
     reporting this bug! I just spent a whole hour fixing it.

 71. BUG!  Manoeverability, combat, ranged combat and special combat
     recovery don't work right!  Example: if some thing with max
     manoeverability and max combat gets hit with toxicity beam then
     his combat and manoever stats NEVER DECREASE!  Even though all his
     recovery rates are at -1!  NOW FIXED.

 72. Included Xav's new Derro, Eagle, Faun and Hybsil.

 73. STUPID: Computer wizards sit next to 4 Dark Woods, taking 8 points
     of damage each turn, even though there are MANY safe squares that
     the wizard could move to!  NOW FIXED.

 74. I designed the numbers 0-30 in a nice smoothed out manner using a
     6 point font.  I made red and green versions.  This is for use in
     the new CellEffects.

 75. I took Xav's new Attack CellEffect made 31 versions of it (0-30)
     using red numbers.  This will be the new standard Attack cell
     effect.  The 0-30 is to show the damage being done.  30 is the
     maximum damage that can ever be inflicted by a single hit (max
     combat + Battle Cry)

 76. I took the old original Attack CellEffect and improved it a little
     and then made 31 versions of it for use as the new Healing
     CellEffect.  We really need a better animation for this though.

 77. Did the programming to display the new attack and heal fx in the
     game.  This requires rewriting CellEffect() to take YET ANOTHER
     parameter for the damage (or intensity) of the effect.  Most
     effects will be ignoring this parameter, at least at first.  For
     now only the Attack and Heal effect will make use of the damage
     (intensity) parameter to display the amount of damage being done
     during the attack. DONE

 78. BUG: Speech for Blood Worm does not work.  NOW FIXED.

 79. RS: But what about Torment and Discard? My computer-allies really
     like to cast that on me. JC: Ok, good point! I just now fixed it
     so that Torment and Discard use the same AI as Coercion. This
     means they won't cast it if ALL the wizards are on the same team.
     I don't know what to do about if you and 1 computer guy are in an
     alliance against several other wizards.

 80. INCLUDED Robin's new Kurzanleitung v1.2 (he edited Valwit's v1.1)

 81. INCLUDED Robin's new Deutsch spell descriptions A-S.

 82. Robin sent in a very nice 3x3 squares gfx of an explosion!  For
     use by the Goblin Bomb or Hand Grenade or whatever we want!  Now I
     must figure out how to load the thing into the game.  Should it be
     a .iff or a .anim or a .animbrush or ?

 83. CURSOR KEYS: There are certain times during the game where I just
     want to smoothly and easily check the life of a bunch of things in
     a straight line.  There is no easy way to do this with the mouse.
     I try pressing the cursor keys to move the mouse pointer but
     nothing happens.  Also, in the level editor there are DEFINITELY
     LOTS of times where I need cursor key control.  Like when I am
     trying to just quickly build a long wall.  So I have now
     programmed the cursor keys to move the mouse pointer exactly 16
     pixels in the chosen direction.  NOW FIXED.

 84. Xav sent in BAZILLIONS of nice tiles!!!!  Lots of walls but no
     damaged variations.

 85. RS: A creature just attacked the (enemy) Magic Tree his wizard
     sits on.  Kinda stupid? JC: Ok I have now adjusted the AI code to
     realize that attacking an ENEMY unit with a FRIENDLY wizard
     mounted on it is stupid.  This includes attacking with combat or
     ranged combat. NOW FIXED.

 86. STUPID: Computer creatures will heal friendly units (such as Magic
     Trees and Castles) which have ENEMY wizards inside them!  This
     includes healing with combat and ranged combat.  NOW FIXED.

 87. BUG: PlayNextThemeSong() is blindly opening and reading and writing
     files with no error checking!  This causes the game to crash when
     run from a write-protected media.  Most CD's are write-protected.
     :) NOW FIXED.

 88. BUG: UpdateTimeSpentPlayingChaos() terminates the game as soon as
     it fails to write to the update file.  Which means it will always
     terminate the game when run from CD.  NOW FIXED.

 89. BUGs: Various pieces of code in start.c call TerminateChaos() as
     soon as any disk write operation fails.  So the game will just
     quit and not start from CD.  NOW FIXED.

 90. Ok, now the game runs from CD but there are various annoyances: 1.
     A requester pops up twice each turn saying "Volume CD0: is
     write-protected" "Retry/Cancel". (Once for PlayNextThemeSong() and
     once for UpdateTimeSpentPlayingChaos()). 2. The game now tries to
     rebuild the indexes of all the thousands of translation and
     graphic and sound files EACH and EVERY time you load the game from
     CD. This makes a huge delay every time you load the game.
     SOLUTION: Make PlayNextThemeSong() check for write-protectedness
     of the disk and set a global variable DiskIsWriteProtected
     appropriately. Then all the "file-writing" pieces of code can
     check this and avoid all writes. NOW FIXED. Chaos can now be
     played from CD or other write-protected media.

 91. UPLOADED v3.04cd to Aminet with the CD-fix and the "special combat
     against nobody" fix.

 92. BUG: I can't get any INACTIVEWINDOW messages! :( I was going to
     program in "pause mode" to stop the animation whenever you click
     to another program.  This would save millions of CPU cycles. But I
     never get any IDCMP INACTIVEWINDOW messages! What is going on?!???
     OK All wrong code NOW FIXED.

 93. PAUSE MODE now works perfectly!  Anytime you click into some other
     window of some other program the CHAOSANIM task stops animating
     the screen.  I had thought this would be a good feature years ago
     but I didn't know how to do it.  This can greatly reduce the
     multitasking cpu load.  This feature is dedicated to Robin Schmidt
     who asked for it.

 94. INClUDED Artur's B Polski descriptions.

 95. INCLUDED the following gfx from Imbe into the game! Aesculapius
     Agathion (Weird effect :)) I put in his Brown Bear as the new
     Grizzly Bear! (It was too blocky so I antialiased it just a
     little) Chronomancer! Combat Drain Beam (use old Combat Drain Beam
     as one of the other beam drain spells?) Consecrate looks great! So
     do the variations! Cursed Sword (I antialiased it) Dao (WOW!) I
     antialiased it a bit. Demonic Touch Beam Horse (I fixed it and
     antialiased it.) Marid (WOW!) Wight (He looks very scary!) Wizard
     4 (I had to scoot it over 1 and test it! The 1st frame was in the
     corpse area) Wizard 5 looks similar to Marid. Wizard 8 (I had to
     scoot this one over also) HE LOOKS COOL! Betrayal (imp turning
     away from master) I had to antialias it some and add some more
     detail. Subversion (imp facing master being charmed with magic) I
     had to antialias it some and add some more detail. Imbe is
     officially inducted as a member of the Chaos gfx team! Go Imbe go!
     Yay Imbe!

 96. BUG: Sometimes if you press the L, S or C keys in a certain way
     then you can cheat because the little boxes have erased a small
     part of the gfx and it allows you to have Line of sight to things
     that you are NOT supposed to be able to see!  This bug only
     happens in NONexploration mode.  Exploration mode does all its LOS
     testing on the ShadowBoard so it is unaffected by any lines drawn
     onto the screen. Modify all keypresses to eliminate that LOS bug!
     DO NOT ERASE THE LINES, yes that is fast but it is incorrect. The
     actual graphic of the cell must be redrawn! ALL NOW FIXED.

 97. PROBLEM: When the dungeon is composed of Apple Woods, each turn
     takes forever!  This is because EVERY Apple Wood, performs special
     combat on EVERY other Apple Wood!  I have now implemented a new
     menu option for Silent Special Combat.  So this is NOW FIXED.

 98. I fixed Imbe's new Pegasus with better antialiasing.  It is a
     combination of Xav's Pegasus with Imbe's animation.  Teamwork
     rulez. :)

 99. Included Artur's Polski Spell descriptions A.

100. FD: * I threw a hand grenade on a (cloaked) wizard surrounded by 2
     generators and 1 cow catapult (and another creature IIRC). But
     each of the 5 objects gave an alleluiah, and all were completely
     destroyed, except for the wizard (but they shouldn't have been
     destroyed since they had enough life points). On the subsequent
     bonus pannel I got 5 bonus kills: five times the same wizard (who
     got killed by another creature in the meantime).  JC: NOW FIXED.

101. WAAAAAAAAAAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!! PATCHWORK RULEZ!!!!!!!!
     BUG: JCsound is doing a FindPort() without a Forbid() Permit()!!!!
     This is TERRIBLE! The reason I didn't know about it, (or even
     think about it) is because the JCsound source code is in its own
     dir so Flashfind from "" FindPort doesn't find anything when I am
     in the Chaos dir. (I am always in the chaos dir.) I had no idea
     this code was in there! Its just some cut & pasted code from
     Aminet to interface to the minrexx.c SOUND BUG NOW FIXED THANKS TO
     ARTUR CHLEBEK! ALL HAIL KING ARTUR!

102. During my test game I found another little flaw with PatchWork
     involving InitSemaphore(&flashysem).  NOW FIXED.

103. I no longer get those "Semaphore has nesting of 1, expecting 0"
     messages when I quit the developer version.  This is sort of
     strange because that message is only involved with the BoardLock
     semaphore not the flashysem semaphore.  More unsolved OS
     weirdnesses.

104. Included Xav's new Centaur, Horse, Hybsil and Unicorn into the
     game.  They have MUCH better running animations now!

105. I drank some caffeine (I haven't had any caffeine in around 10
     days) and sat down and anti-aliased the Marid and the Wizard 5.

106. I changed 1 frame of the Wight.  I antialiased Wizard 8.

107. I'm using Xav's new animated wall as the Force Wall. I thought
     about using it as the new Power Wall but the Power Wall has 9
     damage variations and the Force Wall graphic has 0 damaged
     variations. I don't have time to draw the damaged variations right
     now. Perhaps later on Imbe, Robin or Xav will do them if they want.

108. Force Wall: It would take some serious magic to get one of these
     onto your spell list. In fact, thus far, no wizard has ever
     succeeded in getting a Force Wall onto his spell list. These walls
     are just about impossible to obtain and are damn near
     indestructable. Many military complexes and dungeons have been
     built from these walls for exactly these reasons.

109. I antialiased Wizard 1.  Then I experimented with some lighting
     fx, added a couple of frames and the result is... I'm not sure if
     its good or just annoying.  What do you think?

110. Included Xav's new Bird Lord, Pox Shield and Ride gfx.  The Ride
     gfx is much MUCH better now!  Thank you!

111. Included the following new gfx from Imbe: Discard (I antialiased
     it) Earthquake Shield Falcon (It was totally broken due to large
     amounts of color 32 splattered around. Then I antialiased it.)
     Fire Shield Wizard 7 (I like the magic flowing up and down the
     staff and the hand movement. I don't like the foot movement. While
     the head floating off is rather funny, I'm not sure I really like
     that in a wizard animation. I guess we will vote on this one.)
     Wizard 8 (need to antialias this!) Elephant

112. Included Xav's updated Derro, Nightmare, Omnibiologist, Shadow City

113. Xav's Disection has a VERY cool looking lightning bolt on it and I
     really like it!  _but_ when I look at 1 (lightning bolt) 2 it
     makes me think that a lightning bolt will hit the target and split
     it into 2 parts.  So I modified this gfx to look like a 1/2 symbol
     since the spell cuts everyone's life in 1/2.

114. WOW! Joseph just taught me how to do Stencils in Dpaint!  This is
     totally cool!  If I would have known about this before I could
     have saved at least 30 mins of time when editing Imbe's Wizard 8
     to have Xav's new Wizard 8 clothes!

115. I Put the fixed JCsound + the Semaphorefix into v3.04 and then
     UPLOADED v3.05 to Aminet.

116. Zoltan sent in a mod he made himself titled The Mysterious Land,
     at first I wasn't going to use it because I don't like listening
     to it "by itself" but now I am going to included it into the game
     because I think it will be ok music to listen to "in the game"
     while looking at pix of magic spells and fire breathing dragons
     and such.  I like the composition of this mod, (its mysterious :)
     I just wish the instruments were higher quality.  This mod was
     submitted in XPKSQSH format so only users with XPK.library
     installed will ever hear it.

117. Zoltan sent in another mod titled Land of Magic by Elvis.  Its
     very nice sounding with excellent instruments but its very very
     short.  It sounds like an "Artur Chlebek Mod" :)   Maybe someone
     will lengthen it someday?

118. Xav sent in more gfx!  Drain: The old Drain matches the opposite
     spell (Haste).  But your new Drain looks better so I'm using it.
     Jann: Included into the game.  Joker: I really like him!  But he
     looks like a creature, not a magic spell.  So I don't know what to
     do with this...  We need 32x32 tiles for this then we could make
     him look like he is a pic on a playing card.  That would be a
     perfect Joker.  For this moment he goes into gfx/UnusedGfx/ while
     I decide what to do with him.  Radioactive Land: I like this new
     version much better!  Thundermare: It looks better but I'm not
     sure if this should be the new Thundermare or the new Iridium
     Horse?  I guess I will wait till someone makes a new Iridium Horse
     then I will decide. :) Vitality: Wow!  Both the new versions are
     very cool!  I included this into the game and I hope I can think
     up a new spell to use the yellow-heart version!  *think* *think*
     damn I can't think of anything... oh well...  maybe someday.
     Wizard 7: I don't really like the Leg Movement.  I added your
     version onto the Wizard 7 Screen.  There are now 3 main versions
     on that screen: The James version, The Imbe version and the Xav
     version.  Wizard 8: Auugh!  We both did the same work!  My version
     had some wrong color #32 which I fixed.  I cut & pasted your tile
     17 into my version.  Rest of tiles: I don't know what to do...
     Maybe I should stick to coding from now on. :)

119. BUG: If a mounted wizard moves into a pit then the wizard becomes
     "there but not there".  He isn't there so he can't move and he
     can't be killed.  But he is there so he can still cast spells.
     NOW FIXED.

120. BUG: If an Aerial Servant is on a scroll and flies 10 squares away
     into a pit, then the Aerial Servant dies as normal but the scroll
     he was standing on disappears also!  Even though the scroll was
     nowhere near the pit!  NOW FIXED.

121. BUG: If a creature is standing on a dead body and moves into a pit
     then the dead body disappears!  NOW FIXED.

122. SLOW: Aerial Servants always take a couple of seconds to decide
     who to attack.  I think this is due to the DangerousnessRating()
     routine being very very slow.  It is filled with lots of redundant
     array bounds checking and uses lots of array indexes instead of
     pointers.  I have now rewritten this so it should be at least 2x
     as fast now.  NOW FIXED.

123. I speeded up RaiseDeadRating() in the same manner as
     DangerousnessRating();

124. RS: You should teach the computer that sleeping creatures are not
     really worth attacking. Situation: Vampire (sleeping) next to a
     Green Dragon (enemy), both next to one of eight wizards who all
     play in the same team (thus making the danger of someone calling
     Wake on the vampire void (if one can say that?)). The wizard
     (upgraded with Sword of Sassenrath) attacked the vampire, the
     dragon then killed the wizard. Ouch! JC: NOW FIXED.

125. Implemented a table of CellAddress[] to store the address of the
     first byte of each cell on the board.  This allows fast and easy
     lookup by my upcoming asm rendering/animation routines.

126. IMPLEMENTED DrawBlankCell() and DrawBlankCellShadow()

127. BIZARRE BUG: If you are playing a game in Exploration Mode and for
     some reason a requester should appear onto the game screen (for
     example a "Disk is Write Protected" requester) then you can cheat
     by moving the window around.  It somehow _magically_ uncovers any
     stuff (creatures, scrolls, inanimate objects, anything) in the
     unexplored territory!  Yet it doesn't mess up any gfx at all!
     It's totally bizarre!  I always wondered how on Earth this was
     possible.  Now I figured it out!  It was all because when I set up
     the ShadowBoardRastPort I just copied the rastPort of the main
     board into it!  This copied the layers information which caused
     the OS to provide this most unique and amazing behavior.  I have
     now changed the code to just do an
     InitRastPort(ShadoBoardRastPort); so this is all NOW FIXED.

128. Included: Artur's Polski spell descriptions for the 16 new spells
     introduced after v3.04.  His spell description translations are now
     complete except for the 6 new spells I added in the last couple of
     months.

129. Included Artur's new Vampire attack and death sounds.  They are
     high-quality but very long.  The attack sound is about 6 seconds
     long!  I think people will complain about this.  Oh well then they
     can make their own new Vampire attack sound or they can turn off
     the combat sounds.

130. Included Robin's complete 366 Deutsch spell descriptions, latest
     Deutsch.catalog and Talklistsdir/Deutsch file.

131. STUPID: Basalt Golems shoot things that have 0 movement points.
     NOW FIXED.

132. STUPID: Spectators attack things that have 0 manuverability points.
     NOW FIXED.

133. STUPID: Spectators keep constantly attacking my Conwell's Cow
     Catapult even though it already has 0 maneuverability and they
     aren't hurting it at all!  NOW FIXED.

134. STUPID: All creatures which attack only non-lethal stats (such as
     Maneuver, Move, Combat, Ranged Combat, Special Combat, all
     Recovery rates) will frequently make useless attacks against
     creatures whose stats are already as low as they can go!  NOW
     FIXED.

135. I optimized the IsStupidAttack() and IsStupidShot() routines to
     speed them up.  But then I had to add tons of new code to check
     for useless attacks so all in all it will be just as slow as
     before or even slower.  I think this is why it takes so long for
     an Aerial Servant to decide who to attack; its because he must
     check nearly every square on the board if it is a stupid attack or
     not.  Its a rather large hunk of code that must be executed for
     each sqare.

136. I added code to IsStupidAttack() and IsStupidShot()to check for
     and avoid useless healing attacks.  Such as Hippocrates healing
     someone who already has MAX_LIFE.  I've never seen such a thing
     happen, and in fact I think the other AI routines prevent this
     from ever happening... but the code is in there now just in case.

137. PROBLEM: If you attack an enemy Hippocrates' Combat statistic it
     actually gets better! The Hippocrates becomes a better healer than
     ever before! NOW FIXED. See below.

138. PROBLEM: If you heal your Hippocrates' Combat statistic (for
     example shooting him with Aesculapius) then the Combat actually
     gets worse! It can even become positive so that Hippocrates
     becomes a fighter like everyone else! NOW FIXED. See below.

139. CHANGED: Now if you attack someone's Combat, Special Combat or
     Ranged Combat you make their stat move towards 0. You do NOT
     mathematically lower it.

140. Fixed the program with deutsch talklists by making the maximum
     length of a listname be 256 chars AND I put error checking code in
     to return an error if any listname is over 256 chars. NOW FIXED.

141. NOTE ABOUT TALKLISTS: You should try to make sure that your
     generated sentences cannot go over about 220 chars because that is
     about the realistic maximum amount of text that will fit onto the
     bottom of the screen. However if you accidentally exceed this, no
     harm will be done because the internal buffer is 512 bytes long
     for the entire sentence. If you somehow generate a sentence longer
     than 512 bytes then *BOOM*.

142. Included: Xav's new gfx: Cat Lord Discard Earthquake Shield (Nice
     Shading!) Fire Shield (Nice Shading) Vampire (I always liked the
     old Vampire. He's not perfect but I like gfx with waving cloaks :)
     Old Vampire's legs could have been better. But the new Xav Vampire
     is a better animation and design so I'm using it.) Virtue:
     HeheheheheHAHAHAHAHA OWW! I'M DYING LAUGHING! :-D

143. Included: Imbe's new gfx: Falcon (He added 1 frame) There was a
     line of color #32 in the corpse tile which I removed.  I
     antialiased all frames a little bit.  The Falcon is Awesome!  Fly:
     I antialiased it and improved the back wing.  If this were an
     animation it would make a FANTASTIC Pixie creature!  Generator:
     COWABUNGA!  Nice animation!  NOTE to Imbe: please press the "g"
     key to turn on the grid (16x16) when you move the old animation
     around on the screen.  That way it is always placed correctly.
     Thank you. :) Ghast: Wow, this is weird looking.  I antialised it
     and made it look much better but I think Xav needs to examine this
     gfx.  Be sure to watch it as an actual animation in the game.  It
     doesn't look like a Ghast to me.  It looks like some sort of
     strange alien creature or sea creature.  Ghoul:  I don't know what
     to do about antialiasing this. (???)  I leave it to the
     professional. :)  The red dots animation could be somehow better.
     Giant Rat: I antialiased the tail.

144. Imbe New Cell Effects: Attack: Its very nice! But I already made a
     new attack cell effect out of Xav's animation + my numbers. So we
     need to think up a reason to use this NEW Imbe attack fx. Does
     anyone have any ideas? For healing attacks? For poisoning attacks?
     For attacks against statistics other than life? ???  Twirl:
     WAHOO!!!!  Finally a new Twirl gfx!!!!  I TOTALLY _HATE_ the old
     Twirl cell effect!  The old Twirl gfx hurt my eyes!  This new one
     is much better!  But it could be better still.  I quickly
     single-pixel antialiased it but it really needs double-pixel
     antialiazation.  NOTE TO EVERYONE: Cell Effects can use LOTS of
     frames, like 50 or 100 or whatever.  I can _EASILY_ play cell
     effects animations at 25 or 50 fps so we can use _REALLY_ detailed
     animations on these if you want to make them.

145. Added support for parameters in talklists.

146. I sent the help files, the latest .catalog file and the 8 new spell
     descriptions files to FD for translation and proofreading.  I
     recieved FD's translated help files, catalog file and all 8 new
     spell descriptions!  In only 24 hours!  Frédéric Delacroix earns
     "Fastest Translator in the West" award! (again)

147. Included Xav's new Abath gfx.

148. RS: A wizard just cast Chainsaw twice on one creature?!? JC: NOW
     FIXED.

149. Included Robin's Deutsch help files.

150. Robin sent in a bunch of cell effects animations!  Some of them
     are 100 tiles long!  WOW!  But I'm in the middle of coding on
     JCsound so I will have to look at them and/or program them in
     later.

151. Imbe sent in a new Vulture but I haven't had time to decide if I
     should use it as a Vulture or as some other flying creature?

152. More work on JCsound about sticking in a loop.

153. PROBLEM: When playing a sample with the -2 option the startup code
     is allocating too many buffers. NOW FIXED.

154. PROBLEM: Sometimes when playing sound with the -2 option (The -2
     option is almost always used when playing sounds in Chaos) the
     sound channels start at different times. They are unsynchronized.
     This causes no real harm but I think Artur complained about it
     so... I spent some hours studying the RKRMs and the Amiga C Manual
     and I finally figured out how to start 2 channels playing
     simultaneously. IF the RKRMs are correct and IF the Amiga OS
     audio.device functions as specified then it should now be
     IMPOSSIBLE for the channels to become desynchronized. NOW FIXED.

155. I made some more optimizations to save 128 bytes of code size.

156. I changed the priority setting of JCsound to the first line of
     code so that, under a heavy multitasking load it will get started
     much faster.

157. I think there was a bug in the stereo playback.  NOW FIXED.

158. Implemented perfect synchronization code on the stereo samples!

159. I Sent Zoltan the 16 new spell descriptions + the 8 new spell
     descriptions + the help files for translation.

160.  I only sent Artur the 16 new spell descriptions. I Still need to
     send  Artur the 8 new spell descriptions and the help files!

161. Imbe wants a level with every single monster on it.  I had planned
     to do this for Xav many months ago but I just never got around to
     it and Xav never asked for such a thing soo...  I hacked in some
     code today: Make a quick loop attached to the Z key to insert
     every ID that is a creature, alternating between player 1 and
     player 8.

162. I made another level with all the growths in large blocks for Imbe.

163. Robin sent in a spell file and description and sound effect for the
     Soulsucker.  The spell file and sound effect are good.  I think I
     liked the description given in the Email better than this
     description though.  When I implement this I will need to go back
     and read that Email. (search for soulsucker).

164. Problem: My "Chaos" sound sample in Mod.ChaosTheme13 sounds pretty
     dorky.  Robin processed the sample and now it sounds sorta cool.
     Its very evil sounding!  Sounds almost demonic.  Augh!  He's
     revealed my true nature!

165. Try opening the audio.device ONLY ONCE for both channels. (?) Look
     in that Amiga programming book! That is how they did it! Many many
     many experiments and rewrites deleted. They all crashed one way or
     another.

166. I carefully added 1 line of code at a time, recompiled and tested
     repeatedly, over and over, until I had all the code in to guarantee
     perfectly synchronized mono x2 and stereo sound sample playback.
     Everything seems to work perfectly!!!

167. I then went back and redid all the FreeMem's to go in perfect
     reverse order.  This will allegedly reduce memory fragmentation.

168. I tested JCsound a zillion times and it always works for me now.

169. Included Xav's wild new Ghoul!  Its an improved, colorized,
     antialiased version of Imbe's Ghoul.

170. Included Imbe's new gfx: Falcon (it moves up and down very
     smoothly) Golden Dragon (I antialiased it some more) Gravity
     Sphere (What is it? It looks nothing like a sphere. :) But it
     looks better than the old gfx so I'm using it. I antialiased it.)
     Grizzly Bear: He added a frame and changed some frames. (There was
     a bug: a line of hard black color #32 in the corpse. Now Fixed.)
     Ok, I watched the Grizzly Bear in the game and this animation still
     needs some work, it jumps badly in one spot. It needs 1 more frame
     between the

171. MORE audio.device strangeness. (Letter to FD)

172. I trimmed down the Generator gfx to only go through each color
     once.

173. I double antialiased Imbe's Twirl effect and now it looks better.

174.  BUG! THE SPELLS GADGET IS BROKEN!  Now matter how many spells you
     say you want, you always get 99.  I wanted to play a quick game
     with only 10 spells and I noticed this! How long has it been like
     this? Ever since I added that code to put your bonus spells at the
     top of your list.  So its been broken since December 31, 2000.
     NOW FIXED.

175. BUG: Play an exploration game as player 1  against a computer
     player 8.  Now load a game of a human player 8 vs. a computer
     player 1.  You will see the position of the enemy Player 1  for a
     second in the beginning!  This is cheating!  NOW FIXED!

176. FIXED some stupid bugs in the AI.

177. Resaved Mod.ChaosTheme61 from XPKSQSH to normal uncompressed
     format.

178. Included Artur's 8 new polski spell descriptions.

179. Included Artur's Polski help files.

180. Studied 060 asm coding techniques.

181. RS: BUG: Tribal Dance mod doesn't play when casting Tribal Dance.
     This was very strange because it had always worked for me but I
     finally figured it out. I was playing the mod CreatureName(spell)
     which uses the name of the spell IN THE CURRENT LANGUAGE. Thus the
     mod would not play in any language other than English. I have now
     changed it to the correct creature_name[spell]. NOW FIXED.

182. I studied the proposed new 256 color palette and did various tests
     and made observations.

183. I made a new version of JCsound based on FD's theory for the
     audio.device bugs. (v1.4x  x=eXperimental)  Sent it to Artur for
     testing.  Robin and Artur report that it works perfectly in the
     shell in mono in a 15.75Khz screenmode but that it does not work
     in a 30Khz screenmode with the -2 option.

184. I made a proposed AGA palette alpha version 1 with 125 defined
     colors which contains all the existing ECS colors + more shades.
     Sent it to Xav and Robin for comments, complaints, criticisms, etc.

185. I made yet another new version of JCsound with some changed code
     for the -2 option. (V1.4x1)  Sent it to Artur and Robin.  Now I
     made 1.4x2 and sent it to them.  They report this one works
     perfectly.

186. The final bug in JCsound was that I was doing CMD_WRITE to the
     left channel then to the right channel. So I just assumed that the
     left channel would finish first and the right channel would finish
     last. But some times (all the time?) the buffers finished in
     reverse order! So JCsound would get a signal from the right port
     FIRST then a little later a signal would arrive from the left
     port. If the signals had arrived in the correct order or AT THE
     SAME TIME as I assumed then things would have been working
     perfectly for a long time. Anyway its all NOW FIXED.
