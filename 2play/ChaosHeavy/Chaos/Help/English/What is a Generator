A generator is a very tough thing that generates monsters randomly.

There are currently 4 types of generators:

Aviaries: These only generate flying creatures.

Dragon Nests: Can you guess what comes out of these?

Bipedal Generators: These only make wimpy bipedal creatures.

Generators: These are the "real" generators.  They can generate ANYTHING
in the game, even Demons.  These generators can normally only be killed by
inflicting 63 (or more) points of damage in a single turn.
