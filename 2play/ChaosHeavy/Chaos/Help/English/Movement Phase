You must decide which of your monsters you wish to move, if any.

Left-click on any of your creatures to highlight it, then left-click where
you wish to move it.  If you left-click onto an enemy unit, it will be
attacked.

If you wish to cancel this monster's movement before he has used all his
movement points, just right-click the mouse.

When you have finished moving all the monsters you wish to move, left-click
on the End Turn Gadget at the bottom right hand of the screen.

You will frequently need to check the stats of your creatures and enemy
creatures.  To do this quickly, just point the mouse at it and press the
"q" key on the keyboard.
