You must decide where you want to cast your spell.

Press the "c" key (cast) to show all the legal squares where you can cast
your spell.

When you have decided where you want to cast your spell, left-click the
mouse on that square to cast it.

Note: Some spells do not require you to pick any particular square, you can
just left-click anywhere and it will be cast in the appropriate manner.
