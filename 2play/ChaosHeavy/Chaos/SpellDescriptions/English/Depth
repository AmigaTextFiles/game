Allows all spells (except creatures) to be cast with infinite range and
without line of sight.  This is a very desirable spell because it enables a
wizard to cast lightning bolts and similar weapons at any opponent.  

Inanimate objects like trees, walls, growths and wasp nests can also be
cast in this manner.
