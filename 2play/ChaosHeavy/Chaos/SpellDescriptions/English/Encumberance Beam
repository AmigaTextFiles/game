Encumberance Beam*
Causes your wizard to emit a Beam of Encumberance which will drain 3 points
of maneuverability from EVERYTHING in the chosen direction.  If the target
does not have at least 3 points of maneuver then the beam causes 6 life
points of damage for every maneuver point less than 3.

This beam does not affect scrolls.
