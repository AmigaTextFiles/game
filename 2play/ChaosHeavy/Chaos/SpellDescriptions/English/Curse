Curse*
The curse is a highly desirable spell.  It is best cast when the world is
full of many enemy creations and your position is reasonably secure.  Curse
will suck 2 points of life from all enemy creatures, growths, and even
inanimate objects.  Sleeping creatures are also drained.

Any creature whose life is exhausted by the curse will be killed and points
credited to the casting wizard.
