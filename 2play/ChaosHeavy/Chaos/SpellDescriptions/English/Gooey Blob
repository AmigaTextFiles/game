Gooey Blob*
Gooey blob is particularly useful and can be conjured some distance from
the wizard provided there is line of sight.  The gooey blob then grows much
like a fire does.  No part of the gooey blob can be moved.  Although the
gooey blob has no intelligence it will never harm its master or any of its
master's creatures.

However, the gooey blob quickly grows over enemy creatures preventing them
from moving but not actually killing them. Buried creatures can be
recovered by killing the gooey blob on them.

Rescued creatures will have half their initial life remaining after being
uncovered no matter how much they had when they were buried, so their life
on recovery can be more or less than what it was when they were buried. If
an enemy wizard succumbs to the blob that wizard dies.
