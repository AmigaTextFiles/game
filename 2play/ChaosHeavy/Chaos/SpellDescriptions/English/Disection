Disection*
Causes a virtual knife to pass through the entire world.  All objects
including wizards and generators will feel its presence.  It is like half
the life force of the world is drained away in an instant.  It is known to
cause enfeeblement, nausea, and general light headedness.

At the conclusion of the spell all objects (including those of the caster)
will be at half strength.  Creatures with wound recovery will eventually
heal, but for others the damage is irreversible.  The end result is that for
several turns afterwards kills will be a lot easier to make.
