Manticore*
The manticore is one of the most powerful creatures which may be ridden by
a wizard.  The manticore has the advantage of being able to fire spikes from
its tail as well as take part in direct combat.  The manticore also has a
high magical resistance.

The only drawback to the manticore is its small brain.
