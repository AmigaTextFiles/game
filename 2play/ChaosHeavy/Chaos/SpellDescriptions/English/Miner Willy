Miner Willy*
A memorial to the greatest miner of all time.  Miner Willy of Jet Set Willy
and Manic Miner fame.  This brilliant edifice to Willy gives extra kudos to
your team since it shows you feel so confident in your position as to have
time to cast relatively weak spells.  However, statue Willy is not entirely
useless and he makes a useful obstruction.

This spell is also a good choice for discarding.
