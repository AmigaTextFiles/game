Magic Bolt*
A plain magical attack which works against any object.  If used on a dead
creature the corpse will be destroyed.  It will attack the magical
resistance of the chosen target and lower it by 2 points.  For each magical
resistance point under 2, the creature is inflicted 10 points of damage to
its life force.

Therefore, this spell is best used against creatures with low magical
resistance.
