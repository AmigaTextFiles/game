Demonic Touch*
Allows a wizard to call upon evil incarnate to instill a long term fear in
a chosen target.  The recipient will no longer be able fight effectively,
even if it previously received advanced combat training.  Indeed, the
target can only regain combat ability via subsequent retraining in combat.
