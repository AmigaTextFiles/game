Hyperclone*
Hyperclone is an extremely potent spell which will replicate every single
creature controlled by your wizard.  Each clone will be functionally
equivalent to the original.  Clearly this spell is most effective when you
already have a large number of creatures.

Hyperclone will not replicate your wizard.
