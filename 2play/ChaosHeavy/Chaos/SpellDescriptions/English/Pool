Pool*
This little puddle is much more than it appears.  Creatures placed next to
the pool will heal their wounds much faster than normal.  The healing will
work on any nearby creature irrespective of the owner, thus great care
should be taken in the placing of the pool to ensure your creatures derive
the maximum benefit.
