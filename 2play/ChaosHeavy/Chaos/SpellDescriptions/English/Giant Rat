Giant Rat*
The giant rat, or super rat, is a quick and evasive creature with minimal
intelligence and magical resistance.  The giant rat is a danger to orcs,
horses, elves, halflings, beetles, goblins and ogres but is only a minor
hinderance to other creatures.  Rats are superb scavengers.

The bite of the giant rat is poisonous.
