Cat Lord*
The Cat Lord will assist a wizard when required but is not particularly
suited to combat.

However, as master of all cats, the Cat Lord has some important abilities.
When first cast the Cat Lord will immediately take all cats under his
control.  He is also able to summon his own lions, jaguars, and leopards.
