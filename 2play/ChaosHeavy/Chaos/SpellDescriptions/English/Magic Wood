Magic Wood*
Magic wood is very useful even though it cannot fight like a shadow wood.  
The biggest boon of the magic wood is that a wizard may use such a tree for
meditation.  When the tree collapses the wizard occupying the tree at the
time is granted a new spell.

Unlike castles the trees will not collapse unless occupied. The tree also
provides a wizard with shielding from the watchful eyes of the
independents. Magic trees can be destroyed by combat and some magical
weapons.

Any wizard may make use of any magic tree provided it is not already
occupied. Each magic wood spell can produce up to 8 trees.
