Necropotence*
A magical spell that effectively blocks psionic forces for an indeterminate
amount of time.  Other wizards will be unable to cast magic spells for a
limited amount of time.  It will not prevent enemy wizards from casting
creatures.

Your wizard, however, will be able to cast spells of both types. Some
wizards may regain the ability to cast magic spells after a single turn,
for other wizards this may take longer.
