Dire Wolf*
A huge variety of the normal wolf.  Single wolves are not very useful but
if collected into a group of about six or used in conjunction with other
species the dire wolf can be very useful.  They can hear 2x as far as they
can see and they can smell 3x as far as they can see.  Wolves are scavengers.
