Cloak*
The Cloak can be used to place a shroud around any creature on the board,
but it cannot be applied to inanimate objects, growths, corpses or scrolls.
The Cloak can be cast on creatures not owned by the caster including
sleeping creatures.

This spell can be cast anywhere in the world and does not require line of
sight.  Once cloaked, information about the cloaked creature can only be
obtained by its owner.  Any cloaked creature becomes 4x as hard to hit
because it is not easily seen by its opponents and this is the main reason
for using the cloak.

A cloaked creature blocks the LOS of its enemies but you, your creations
and your allies will be able to see straight through it.  A Cloak may be
removed with Reveal.
