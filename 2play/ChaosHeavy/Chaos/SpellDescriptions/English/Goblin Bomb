Goblin Bomb*
No campaign is complete without a goblin.  The goblin is among the better
fighters of the common bipedal living species.  The goblin can fight as
well as the ogre but is slightly weaker in its defence.

This goblin carries a grenade and upon its death the goblin releases the
grenade which subsequently explodes causing damage to all adjacent cells.
