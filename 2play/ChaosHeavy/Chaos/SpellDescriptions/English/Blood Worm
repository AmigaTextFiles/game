Blood Worm*
The Blood Worm inflicts less damage than a regular worm but this is
compensated by the fact that the Blood Worm injects poison with each
attack. It has a lower recovery rate than the standard Worm so it needs to
constantly feed in order to replenish its life force.

In all other respects the Blood Worm is identical to the standard Worm.
