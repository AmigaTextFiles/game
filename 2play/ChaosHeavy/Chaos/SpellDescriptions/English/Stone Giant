Stone Giant*
Capable of killing fauns, elves, horses and giant rats in a single blow,
the stone giant is a truly awesome creature.  Stone giants have been known
to kill lesser dragons and even once a pyrohydra.  What's more the stone
giant is a brilliant defender.  Once in battle, however, the giant must
fight to the death, but usually the giant will emerge as the victor.
