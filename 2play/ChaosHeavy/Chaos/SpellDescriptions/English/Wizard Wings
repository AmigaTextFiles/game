Wizard Wings*
Wizard wings gives your wizard the ability to fly and will set his movement
to 6.  The spell will only work on your wizard.  Provided the wizard is not
engaged or dismounting, flight with the range of an eagle will be possible.

Wizard Wings are particularly useful for hopping between magic wood trees.
