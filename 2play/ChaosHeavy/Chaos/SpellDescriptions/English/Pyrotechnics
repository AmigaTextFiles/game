Pyrotechnics*
Causes the wizard to emit a volley of rockets into several nearby cells.  
The spell is hard to control and often the wizards own creations may suffer
some impacts.

The spell is best used when the wizard is surrounded by weak opposition
creatures. The rockets are particularly effective as they often explode
inside their targets.
