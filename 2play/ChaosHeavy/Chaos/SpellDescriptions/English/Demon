Demon*
The demon is the most feared of all creatures.  They are incredibly strong,
exceptionally intelligent, and designed for combat.  Anything less than a
vampire best keep well clear of a demon.

Magic is the best approach in dispelling a demon, but even this is a
difficult task.  Thankfully, demons are very rare.
