Grim Reaper*
This Spell summons Death to Earth and binds him to the control of the
casting wizard.  The Grim Reaper moves the way you command, but charges
his toll in the form of the lives of those who surround him, no matter
which party they belong to.

If unwisely moved, he will also take the life of his master, which allows
him to leave our world at last.
