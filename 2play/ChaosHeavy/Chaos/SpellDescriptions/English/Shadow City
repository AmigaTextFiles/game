Shadow City*
A mysterious safe haven for the wizard.  It is a home of the dead and as
such normal creatures should avoid coming in contact with a shadow city.  
It essentially behaves as an undead.  These havens are much rarer than
magic castles or dark citadels.

When they collapse with a resident wizard the potential benefits are high.
It is unlikely the city will be detroyed by attack.
