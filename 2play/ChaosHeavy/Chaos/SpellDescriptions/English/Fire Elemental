Fire Elemental*
A powerful creature possessing many of the properties of a real fire.  
Living creatures shun the fire elemental and will not attack it, as it
appears to them to be an undead.  Such elementals are best disposed using
magic.

However, even in death the fire elemental is a menace as it leaves behind a
real fire.
