Basalt Golem*
A form of golem made from basalt.  They are marginally more intelligent
than the usual stone golem.  One advantage is an ability to move
considerably faster than other golems, since basalt holds together better
when moving at speed.  However, the main advantage is an ability to gaze at
other creatures and almost paralyze them.
