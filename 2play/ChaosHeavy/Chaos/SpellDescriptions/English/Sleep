Sleep*
The sleep spell as the name suggests can be used to put a creature to
sleep.  Sleep does not work on wizards or on growths like gooey blobs.  Once
asleep a creature cannot move or attack.  It is possible to attack sleeping
creatures.  The spell can be reversed by a wake spell.

The pair sleep-wake presents an alternative to using a subversion spell,
but be aware that any wizard can use either spell. Sleep spells are best
reserved for use on strong opponents. The sleep state is identical to that
induced on creatures when a wizard dies.
