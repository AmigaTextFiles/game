Conwell's Cow Catapult*
An ancient artifact of fearsome power.  Conwell used this weapon to hurl
cows at Irvine during the last Wizard War.  Irvine suffered such horrible
afflictions from this war machine that he was forced to develop
Irvine's Invulnerability to protect himself from the ensuing bovine barrage.
