Lightning*
An easy spell which causes the wizard to emit a lightning bolt.  The bolt
can travel up to four squares provided there is line of sight.  Its magical
and physical components will lower the magical resistance of any creature
struck by 2 points and transfer the excess damage to its life force at a
10:1 ratio.

For example, a creature with a magical resistance of 0 and a life force of
15 will die as it would suffer 20 points of damage to its life force.
