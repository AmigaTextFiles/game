Weak Wall*
Despite its name, the weak wall is a formidable obstacle for an opponent to
overcome.  It is extremely useful for slowing the passage of fire, or
blocking the growth of gooey blob.  The name only implies that this wall is
weaker than standard wall or strong wall.

Most magical attacks will eliminate a weak wall. The wall can also be
destroyed by combat but this will usually take several rounds. For each
weak wall spell 6 pieces of wall may be cast anywhere in the world.
