Arctic Wolf*
A wolf from the extreme cold regions.  A horrid carnivore that will eat
whenever possible.  Because they normally inhabit a harsh environment they
are very hardy.  They do not fear the undead.  They do not fear dragons
either.  They attack multiple characteristics and enjoy ripping off the
legs of their prey.  They can hear 2x as far as they can see and they can
smell 4x as far as they can see.  Wolves are scavengers.
