Iridium Horse*
A extraordinarily rare super enhanced form of horse.  This spell is even
rarer than the powerful thundermare.  As a general rule this spell does not
appear on spell lists (you are about as likely to get a generator on your
spell list).  Under normal circumstances an irdium horse only occurs when a
thundermare kills a red, green, blue, or golden dragon.
The iridium horse is the ultimate in mounts. It is strong, swift, and
deadly in combat. Not only can it attack in similar vein to the
thundermare, but it also has a powerful iridium stare which affects several
statistics of the target simultaneously. The irdium horse also freely
attacks undeads even though it is not undead itself. The nightmare pales in
comparison to this awesome beast. Even demons are known to be wary of this
animal.
The iridium horse represents the most powerful mount available and a wizard
fortunate enough to have an Iridium Horse commits an extreme faux pas if he
does not ride this beast.
