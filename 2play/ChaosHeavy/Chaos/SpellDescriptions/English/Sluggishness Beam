Sluggishness Beam*
Causes your wizard to emit a Beam of Sluggishness which will drain 7 points
of maneuverability from EVERYTHING in the chosen direction.  If the target
does not have at least 7 points of maneuver then the beam causes 6 life
points of damage for every maneuver point less than 7.

This beam does not affect scrolls.
