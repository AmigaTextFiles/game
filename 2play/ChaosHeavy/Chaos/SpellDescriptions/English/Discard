Discard*
A powerful magical spell which burrows into the minds of wizards and
tampers with their memory.  Its usual effect is temporary amnesia, and the
wizard will find most spells have suspiciously disappeared.

These spells will eventually return, sometimes after a single turn.  A
single invocation will induce this effect in all other wizards.
