Dark Power*
Dark power causes the target to be consumed by madness.  A high magical
resistance is required to escape the effect.

3 attempts are granted, each of which inflicts 2 points of damage to the
creature's magical resistance.  Dark power does not require line of sight
and works over the entire world.  Dark power cannot be applied to inanimate
objects.
