Vampire*
The vampire is amongst the most feared of all creatures, second only to the
demon.  The vampire has exceptional intelligence, excellent fighting ability
and a good magical resistance as well as endurance.  Vampires are known to
have killed golden dragons in five attacks.

A vampire must constantly feed on living creatures or it will die. Vampires
do not feed on the dead.
