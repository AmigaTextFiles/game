Faun*
The faun, or satyr as they are sometimes known, is a highly intelligent
creature with a high magical resistance.  They are rather slow and not
particularly skilled in combat but have a fair chance of escaping from a
conflict if desired.  Unfortunately, once wounded they cannot heal
themselves.

If Agent Casting is enabled then on any given turn there is a 5% chance
that the faun will cast a sleep spell on an opponent.
