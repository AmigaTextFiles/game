Battle Cry*
Causes your wizard to produce a sonic shock wave consisting of an order to
battle hard.  The sound is guaranteed to stir your creatures into action.  
All your combatants will attack at double strength.  The voice is so strong
that creatures will exceed the normal maximum for combat if necessary.

The effect lasts only for the duration of the current round.  The spell is
most useful when you have many weaker creatures and want one quick chance
to wipe out many of the opposition.
