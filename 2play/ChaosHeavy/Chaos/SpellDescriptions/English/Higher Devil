Higher Devil*
A higher devil is summoned from the pits of hell by the wizard.  They
somewhat resemble demons in their appearance and abilities and are
generally shunned by other creatures including undeads.

Once cast the devil is very faithful to the wizard and will obediently
carry out any tasks set with no complaint.
