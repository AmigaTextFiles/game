Bandit*
A human mercenary that generally behaves as a thief and general rogue.  
Often they enjoy the taste of battle and will fight for nothing.  They
quickly become bored from lack of action and are not particularly reliable
or trustworthy.

This said, they enjoy mingling with other creatures of all types, forever
on the lookout for quick financial gain.  Maybe they are related to lawyers.
