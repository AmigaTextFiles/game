Thundermare*
A rare enchantment over the standard horse.  This creature is very rarely
available as a free spell, instead most often occurring when a wizard
riding a horse successfully kills another creature with the horse.

The thundermare has numerous advantages over the standard horse, although
its base strength is only slightly higher than the normal horse. Its
biggest asset is its advanced combat training. The thundermare is capable
of lashing out with all hooves simultaneously and still land back on them
afterwards. The thundermare represents an ideal safe haven for the wizard.
It has extreme magic resistance and will probably only be killed in direct
combat, if at all.
