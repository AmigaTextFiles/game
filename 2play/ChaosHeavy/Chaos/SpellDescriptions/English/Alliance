Alliance*
Force another wizard to enter into an alliance with you.  The target wizard
joins your team and that wizard's creations will no longer engage your
creatures.  You can even force several wizards into alliances with you by
using multiple alliance spells.  When allied with a computer player, the
computer wizard will not cast harmful spells on your wizard.

The independents are FIERCELY independent and don't want to be in an
alliance with you (or anyone else for that matter).  So don't bother
trying it on them.
