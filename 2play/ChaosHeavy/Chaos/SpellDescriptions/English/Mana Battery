Mana Battery*
An energetic source of magical and psionic energy.  Any wizard adjacent to
such a battery will regularly gain new spells.  The battery is long life
and none are known to have ceased operation by natural causes.

Naturally, independent creatures tend to loathe these batteries, as they
invariably result in a worse life for the independents.
