Subversion*
Subversion is an attempt to convince an enemy creature that its interests
might be better served if it had allegiance to your wizard.  The spell
might or might not succeed.  More intelligent creatures are less likely to
change sides than stupid creatures.  You will never be able to convince
another wizard to join your side or any creature such a wizard might be
riding.

Subversion can be attempted on any creature (including sleeping creatures).
The spell requires line of sight. If the spell fails nothing happens to
either party. If the spell succeeds the target of the spell immediately
swaps to your side and will no longer respond to the commands of its
previous leader.
