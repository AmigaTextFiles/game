White Dragon*
White dragons normally dwell only in cold regions.  Meditation may allow a
wizard to call upon a white dragon.  The white dragon is very strong but
slower than other dragons due to its lower metabolic rate.

The white dragon can freeze other species to death with a breath weapon
which is more effective than the breath weapons of the red and green
dragons.
