Acid Rain*
Causes a global rain storm with droplets of extreme acidity.  The rain
drops are a mixture of water, sulphuric acid, formic acid, nitric acid,
phosphoric acid, carbonic acid, and surprisingly citric acid.  The droplets
also contain hydrazine and various other flammable compounds.  Because of
these flammable compounds acid rain will not put out fires.  Further, acid
rain does not harm creatures in general although during the rain it may be
painful to them.

However, trees are extremely vulnerable to this type of rain.  Even the
hardy magic wood cannot stand acid rain.
