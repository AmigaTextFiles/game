Fire*
Fire is very dangerous once conjured.  A fire continues to grow until the
conjurer is killed or until it is put out by other means.  Fires can burn
any creature, living or undead or dead, or any wizard not possessing a fire
shield.  Fires even burn the creatures of the conjurer and can even burn
the conjurer.

Fires can also burn down castles, citadels and even walls, although this
usually takes considerable time. The destructive ability of a fire exceeds
that of any creature including dragons and vampires. Fire can be put out by
active effort of creatures, each cell of fire has a energy comparable to
that of a faun or troll.
