Bury*
Allows a wizard to bury up to eight corpses and/or scrolls from anywhere on
the board.  Line of sight is not required.

Once buried a dead creature cannot be raised from the dead.  Therefore, by
burying corpses of dragons, giants, and so on, you can prevent other
wizards from raising them.  The spell is also useful for clearing space for
walls, trees, and meditation chambers or for destroying scrolls that you
don't want your enemies to grab.
