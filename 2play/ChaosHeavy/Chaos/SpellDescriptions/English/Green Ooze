Green Ooze*
Green ooze is very similar to the gooey blob and it grows in the same
manner.  The green ooze cannot be moved in the same way as you move your
other creatures.  Instead it grows on its own accord.

Any creature which succumbs to the ooze can be recovered by killing the
ooze on the creature concerned.
