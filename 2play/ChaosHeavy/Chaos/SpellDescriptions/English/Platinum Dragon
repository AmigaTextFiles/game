Platinum Dragon*
The platinum dragon is the king of the good dragons.  A summons can only be
granted through meditation.  The platinum dragon has the highest stamina of
any creature, can attack as well as a vampire, fly, and make use of a
breath weapon.

His breath is so strong that it is likely to start an elemental fire,
similar to that produced by the Fire spell. He has exceptional intelligence
and self-healing ability.
