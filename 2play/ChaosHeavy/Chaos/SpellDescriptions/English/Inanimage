Inanimage*
The Inanimage is what an Inanimatologist becomes after making 3 kills.  He
can instantly reveal the stats of any inanimate object by looking at its
scroll.  He is fond of casting rocks and power walls.

He can throw fireballs as well as an Ogre Mage and he also heals friendly
inanimate objects adjacent to himself.
