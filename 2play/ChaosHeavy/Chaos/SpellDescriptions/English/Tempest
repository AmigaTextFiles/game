Tempest*
A tempest is an air elemental which moves at its own volition.  Inanimate
objects are not affected by a tempest.  Any creature falling into a tempest
will be propelled to a new random location (which is sometimes desirable,
but usually best avoided).

There is a small chance that the transported creature will not survive the
ordeal.
