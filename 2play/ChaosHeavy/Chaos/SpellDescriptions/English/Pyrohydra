Pyrohydra*
The pyrohydra is an extremely lethal variant of the standard hydra. The
pyrohydra is able to emit a burst of fire from all of its heads
simultaneously. The temperature and destructiveness of this breath exceeds
that of all but the strongest dragons. The range of the breath is rather
limited.

A pyrohydra can only be obtained by meditation and even then is rather
unlikely. Most other living creatures should not risk approaching a
pyrohydra.
