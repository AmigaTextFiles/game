Wolverine*
A ferocious mutant wolf that loves killing and is very good at it.  
Wolverines normally shun wizards and can only be obtained through
meditation.

Apart from its superior fighting ability the wolverine is much the same as
the dire wolf. They loathe dire wolves which they consider as unwanted
competition for food.
