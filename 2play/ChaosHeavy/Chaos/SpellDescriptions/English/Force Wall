Force Wall*
It would take some serious magic to get one of these onto your spell list.
In fact, thus far, no wizard has ever succeeded in getting a Force Wall
onto his spell list.  These walls are just about impossible to obtain and
are damn near indestructable.

Many military complexes and dungeons have been built from these walls for
exactly these reasons.
