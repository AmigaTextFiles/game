Gorilla*
Gorillas are a good middle of the road animal and are a worthy adversary
for most bipedal living creatures such as trolls, ogres, and goblins.  The
more violent animals such as the lion and grizzly bear can kill a gorilla.  

The gorilla has only mediocre intelligence but fights with vigour.
