Ubiquiscope*
The Ubiquiscope is equivalent to a Crystal Ball + a Magic Wand combined.  A
highly desirable spell which removes the need for your wizard to have line
of sight in order to cast a spell.

With the Ubiquiscope, your wizard can "see" everywhere. Range restrictions
still apply as usual, though each Ubiquiscope will add +1 to your casting
range.
