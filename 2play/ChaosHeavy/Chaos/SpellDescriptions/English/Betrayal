Betrayal*
Betrayal is an attempt to convince an enemy creature that its interests
might be better served by changing its allegiance.  It is essentially a
weak version of subversion, as the convincing is only one way.  That is,
although the creature may be convinced to change sides there is little
chance that it will decide upon your lord as its new leader.

However, the spell is still useful because it works over a longer distance
than subversion and no wizard likes any adjacent creature to suddenly
become an enemy.
