Consecrate*
A spell similar to Dark Power but affecting a wider area.  Choose the
centre and this spot and all cells immediately adjacent will suffer two
points of damage to their magic resistance.  Useful for destroying groups
of weak undead creatures.

For some unknown reason, this spell must be cast directly on a creature of
some type; a corpse or empty cell won't do.
