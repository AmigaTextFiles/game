Meddle*
A wave of death passes over the land, followed by a rejuvination.  Some
have likened it to a turning of the world.  The result is that all
creatures pass to their reincarnation.

The usual result is a slight weakening of the world, since most creature
reincarnate downwards. An additional side effect is that all creatures lose
any current ability to reincarnate. Things which cannot be reincarnated
(like inanimate objects) are unaffected by this spell.
