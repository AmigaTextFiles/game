Harpy*
The harpy is a cross between a vulture and a female human.  Harpies are
fast and can mount aerial attacks thereby avoiding direct engagement.  
Using vulture claws the harpy can rip into the hide of most beasts and can
outfly would be attackers.

Unfortunately, the harpy possesses relatively poor eyesight and smell.
