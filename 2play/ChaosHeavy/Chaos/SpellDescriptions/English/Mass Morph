Mass Morph*
A powerful spell best cast on an enemy with many creations.  In extreme
circumstances, you might cast this spell on your own wizard.  Mass morph
changes all of a player's creations, except generators, into magic trees
which can then be used for meditation by any player.

No wizard, nor any wizard's mount is affected by this spell.
