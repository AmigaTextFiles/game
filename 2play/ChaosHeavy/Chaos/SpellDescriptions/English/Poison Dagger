Poison Dagger*
A spell which causes the chosen target to stop attacking life force and
turn to more sinister means of accomplishing the same task.  The chosen
target will instead infect during combat.  The infection is very strong and
will quickly mitigate the recovery rate of strong creatures leading swiftly
to death.

For humanoid races this spell gives the combatant an infected dagger, for
other creatures appropriate action is taken, ranging from poisonous fangs
to astral viruses. The dagger does 5 points of damage.
