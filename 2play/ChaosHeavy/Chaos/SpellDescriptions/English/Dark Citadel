Dark Citadel*
The dark citadel provides a safe haven for the wizard, and a place for
meditation.  There is a chance of the citadel collapsing at each turn, if
this should happen while the wizard is inside a new spell will be granted.  

It is possible to make use of dark citadels conjured by other wizards
provided they are not already occupied.  Only a wizard can make use of a
citadel.  A dark citadel can be destroyed by an extremely determined attacker.
