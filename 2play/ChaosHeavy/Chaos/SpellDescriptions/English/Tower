Tower*
The mystical powers of the Magic Tower allow it to absorb the essence of
any creature who enters it.

The Tower starts out very short but as it becomes more powerful it grows in
size.  Any creature entering a tower adds all of its primary statistcs to
the statistics of the Tower.  Once a creature enters a tower it can never
leave because its essence becomes one with the tower in a permanent and
unbreakable bond.

Wizards cannot enter towers.
