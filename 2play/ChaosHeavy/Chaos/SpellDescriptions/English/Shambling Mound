Shambling Mound*
The Shambling Mound is some sort of weird ambulatory plant type of thing.
It is also the most intelligent plant life known to man.

It has superior scavenging and exophagy characteristics and is completely
omnivorous. As long as the Shambling Mound has a corpse to sink its web of
tangled roots into, it will be difficult to kill in direct combat.
