Paradigm Shift*
Wizards generally maintain their forces of undeads by continual mental
domination of the objects concerned.  This spell tweaks the minds of all
wizards so that all the undeads once again become only potentials.  This
means all undeads currently on the board will be removed.

However, it cannot cleanse them completely and all such undeads will
reappear on their controlling wizard's spell list.  Normally living
creatures which have been raised will also suffer the same fate.  The
undeads of the caster are not immune because of the wide area pulse this
spell creates.

Indepedent undeads will be utterly destroyed. 

The spell is best used when you have few or no undeads of your own and is
particularly effective when there are many independent undeads.
