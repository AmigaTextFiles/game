Gryphon*
A large flying beast which can be ridden by the wizard who conjured it.  
The gryphon has a good stamina and magical resistance but is not
particularly agile.  The gryphon is not a particularly skilled fighter but
can move a considerable distance enabling a mounted wizard to quickly
escape from difficult situations.
