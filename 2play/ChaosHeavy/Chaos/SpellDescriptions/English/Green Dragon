Green Dragon*
The green dragon is the weakest species of dragon, having a strength
similar to that of a crocodile.  Of course, the green dragon is far more
useful than the crocodile, as it can move further and more importantly can
use a breath weapon.

The breath weapon consists of chlorine gas and is quite deadly. The dragon
will recover from injuries but not as quickly as red and golden dragons do.
