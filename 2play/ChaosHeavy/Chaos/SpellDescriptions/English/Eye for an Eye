Eye for an Eye*
Gives special coverage to all your creations.  Should any of your creations
be killed or otherwise destroyed in combat then the killer will also be
struck dead.  The effect lasts for 2 kills and is cumulative with multiple
Eye for an Eye spells.  Thus if you have triple and cast this spell the
effect will last for 6 kills.
