Bodak*
A Bodak is a human that has become corrupted by venturing too close to the
abyssal planes.  They appear in giant proportions and fight bare handed
even though most of them do carry a weapon.

Their combat ability is similar to that of a true giant, but they retain
only the stamina of a real human.
