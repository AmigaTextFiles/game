Abduction*
Like subversion, abduction is an attempt to convince an enemy creature that
its interests may better lie with allegiance to your wizard.  Intelligent
creatures are more likely to see through this ruse than stupid creatures.  
However, as abduction applies to a random creature you cannot know
beforehand the intelligence of the recipient.  Further, because the
targeting of this spell is so imprecise it is possible that it will be
applied to one of your own creations.  Therefore, the spell is most
beneficial when you have relatively few creations.

Line of sight is not required and your chosen target can be anywhere on the
board.  This spell will not attempt to target Artifacts, Scrolls, Wizards or
corpses.  If successful, the target will immediately come under control of
your wizard and no longer respond to the commands of its previous lord.
