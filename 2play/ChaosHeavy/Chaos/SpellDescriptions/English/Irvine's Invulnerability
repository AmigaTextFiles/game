Irvine's Invulnerability*
Created by the ancient wizard Irvine to stave off the deadly attacks of his
arch-rival King Conwell who seems to have had a fondness for catapulting
cows at him when he wasn't looking.

This spell uses extremely powerful but rather unstable magic to render the
caster invulnerable to any and all physical attacks. After several turns
the instability becomes too great and the spell evaporates into
nothingness.
