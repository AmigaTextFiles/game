Brain Drain*
This spell will play on the mind of the chosen target.  The spell induces
torment in the brain of the target causing severe synaptic damage.  For
weak minded creatures the spell is usually fatal.  Damage caused by a brain
drain spell may be recoverable by a brain boost spell.  This spell can be
cast on enemy wizards.

This spell inflicts 10 points of damage to the target's intelligence; if
this results in a value less than zero then the target dies of stupidity.
