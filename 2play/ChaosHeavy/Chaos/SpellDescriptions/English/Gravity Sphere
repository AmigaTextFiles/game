Gravity Sphere*
Causes the wizard to create a dense sphere of neutrons, much like a
miniature neutron star, which causes the gravity to increase exponentially.
Indeed, gravity becomes so strong that flying movement becomes impossible.  

All creatures which can normally fly will be forced to move like any other
creature. The sphere will eventually decay and normal flight can then
resume.

A typical instance will last for 6 turns, however, if several wizards cast
this spell in succession the delay could be much longer.
