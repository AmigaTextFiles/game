Replicate*
Replicate makes a clone of the chosen creature.  The clone will belong to
the same player as the original, so you best replicate one of your own
creatures.  The copy is identical in every respect.  Replicate will fail if
there is no empty space adjacent to the creature to be duplicated.

Replicating any Wizard causes prolonged disorientation and confusion in the
caster (and everyone else for that matter). Replicating a Wizard can cause
hallucinations, delusions, agitation and/or anger in certain persons.
