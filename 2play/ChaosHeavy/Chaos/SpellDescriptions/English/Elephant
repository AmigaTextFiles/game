Elephant*
The elephant is very strong and attacks with its trunk and by stomping.  
Wizards are not normally permitted to ride elephants.  The strength of the
elephant makes it useful for attacking several opponents simultaneously.  

The Elephant has perfect Eidetic Memory and will always remember what is
under the object in any square on the board.
