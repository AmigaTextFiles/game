Seismology*
This spell will train all creatures on your team in the seismological arts.
The training is so good that henceforth, any enemy creature within 7
squares will automatically be detected.

However this will not allow you to detect any creature which cannot be
detected by its earthly vibrations; thus, galloping horses can be detected
but inanimate objects, slithering snakes and floating ghosts cannot.
