@node INTRO "Introduction to Frontal Assault"
Welcome to Frontal Assault, created by James R. Daniels.

The idea of the game is to attack up to 7 other players (either computer
controlled or human players) and fight to survive using all the weapons and
shields at your disposal.

If you have played Scorched Tanks (or a similar 'tank/non-moving base
projectile' type game), you will understand the rules & gameplay already!

The rules are simple. Each player takes it in turns to blow the hell out of
everyone else until he or she is left standing. Unlike @{FG shine}S.T.@{FG text}, the weapons
themselves are not bought before the round begins - they are bought as they
are used.

For example:- Say you have £5000 and you want to use a dirtball which costs
£300, you would select that weapon and then choose fire (after aiming the
weapon/target point. (See Controls) Then, the money would be subtracted    
( leaving you with $4700 :> ) and the weapon would be fired. Then it would
be the end of your go!

That is the basic rules really. Everything else is covered in other sections
so feel free to peruse the rest of the guide :) Remember that the game has
got an Help Section in it which covers more than this does...(currently)

@node GHISTORY "Guide History section..."
This section contains the history of this guide. It isn't very interesting
but in-case you wanted to know it, here it is:-

30/11/98 v0.5   Start of the guide. Started the basic layout of everything.
                Incorporated the readme's with the game.
                Starting to look good already too ;)

4/12/98  v0.55  Just a little bit of tinkering. Removing of useless
                information. Added some new sections. Will fill them next
                update :)

5/12/98  v0.56  Changed the Installation section <as I got it wrong :( >
                Also added words to the Index section. Not linked yet!

9/12/98  v0.80  Added a few more sections i.e. ALL the Main Menu & Options
                Section. Changed the layout of the main (Welcome) section.
                Changed Requirements section. Also edited other sections
                slightly.

28/12/98  v0.85 Another small update. Added the Guide To Do List section.
                Changed the main menu layout. Probably will change it again!
                This will be the first upload to the Aminet. Proper one this

@node REQ "Requirements for the game..."
The requirements for Frontal Assault are:-

    2 MB CHIP RAM & 2 MB FAST RAM
    HARD DISK

Recommended:-

    68020 or better
    6 MB or more
    Accelerators will help too :)

Oh, and preferably some friends to play the game with (or just use the
computer players if no-one is forthcoming) as it is a multi-player game
really.
