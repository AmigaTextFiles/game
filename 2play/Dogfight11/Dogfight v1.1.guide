                               Dogfight v1.1
                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome to France, 1916.  In those days, The life expectancy of young pilots
like you was said to be about twenty minutes.  In this game, twenty seconds is
a more usual lifespan!

You and a friend are the top aces of your time - the pride of the British and
German air forces.  In this game, there is no real purpose to life other than
hearing the expiring whimper of the other player.

                       What's this Dogfight game then?
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dogfight is a simple, two-player game of air combat.  The players fly
biplanes for competing air forces and have the task of destroying as many
enemy forces as possible using their machine guns and bombs.  Besides the
other player's plane, there are zeppelins, submarines, airfields, and anti-
aircraft batteries to keep you busy, and all of them explode in a most
satisfying manner.

Dogfight is an attempt to go back to the days when computer games were simple
and fun; they were played because they were enjoyable and not because they
had 15 gazillion megabytes of photorealistic graphics. The graphics in
Dogfight have improved a bit since v1.0, but I have tried to focus on
gameplay rather than graphics and sound.  Dogfight is easy to play; it takes
only a couple of minutes to learn, and probably doesn't need any instructions
at all, but I hear rumours that people play this game for hours at a time.

Dogfight v1.1 should work fine on any Amiga, from an A500 up, provided it has
at least 1 MB of memory.  I now develop on an unexpanded A1200 and Dogfight
runs at a good speed on that, so it may be a little slow on an A500.

I'm a pretty busy guy (this is the first update to Dogfight, which was first
written in 1990), but I do like to hear from people about comments or
suggestions.  As a result, Dogfight is now PostcardWare (please see the
Copyright section at the end of this document.)

                                How to Play
                                ~~~~~~~~~~~

When you first start Dogfight you'll see the Options screen.  After setting
options, you'll see the Game Screen, and you're ready to play.

Playing Dogfight consists of three main skills: @{"taking off" link TAKEOFF}, @{"flying around" link CONTROLS},
and @{"blowing things up" link TARGETS}.  Something for everyone. ;-)

                              Options Screen
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the game loads you will be presented with the intro screen, where you
can select the game options using the joystick in port 1.

The first of the options is automatic or manual throttle.  Automatic is best
for beginning players.

The second is for air-to-air collisions.  Enabling this means your plane
will be destroyed if you try to fly through the other plane, a zeppelin or
submarine.

The third is limited or unlimited bombs.  If limited bombs is chosen, each
plane carries only two bombs.

The fourth option is just there for a laugh, it's not really part of the
game.  It lets you fly off the top of the screen.  You can then nosedive from
a great height, reaching speeds which are quite ridiculous and not at all
safe.

When you exit the Options screen (by choosing "Start") you'll go to the
@{"Game Screen" link GAMESCREEN}.

                                ~~~~~~~~~~~

The game screen shows a side view of two planes sitting on runways.  The
British plane (player 1's plane) is shown on the left, and the German plane
(player 2's plane) on the right.

At the bottom of the screen is the information panel.  Player 1's score is
at the left, and player 2's score at the right.  Underneath each score are
two bomb icons, showing that each plane is carrying two bombs.  If you have
stereo sound connected to your computer, all sound effects for player 1 will
come from the left speaker, and all sound effects for player 2 will come
from the right speaker.

If you picked automatic throttle, the planes will now accelerate down the
runway.  Otherwise, you will have to press forward on the joystick to
accelerate.

@node CONTROLS
@title "Welcome to Dogfight v1.1!"

                                 Controls
                                 ~~~~~~~~

There are only five simple controls in Dogfight.  Pressing forward on the
stick will accelerate.  In auto mode, this is done for you, which makes it
harder to stall.

Moving the stick left will make your plane turn anticlockwise; that is,
the British plane (which faces right) will pull up, and the German plane
(facing left) will nosedive.

Moving the stick right will turn your plane clockwise; that is, the German
plane will pull up, and the British plane will nosedive.  (The easiest way
to see how this works is to load the game and try it.)

Pressing the fire button will fire the plane's gun.  Hold the button down for
rapid fire.

Finally, pulling back on the stick will @{"drop a bomb" link BOMBING} (provided you are
carrying any).

@node TAKEOFF
@title "Welcome to Dogfight v1.1!"

                                  Takeoff
                                  ~~~~~~~

An extremely annoying tree growing at the end of each runway makes taking
off difficult.  For a successful takeoff, you must lift off in time to clear
the tree, but not so early that you @{"stall" link STALLING} the plane.

When you are about half way along the runway, lift your nose up just a
fraction.  (The British player needs to tap the joystick quickly to the left,
the German player to the right.)  If the plane loses power and falls to the
ground, you pulled up too early or raised the nose to far.  If the plane clips
the top of the tree and crashes, you pulled up too late.  (And if it just
explodes on the runway, you moved the stick to the wrong side!)  With trial
and error, you will soon find the takeoff easy.

The simplest way to take off is to accelerate right to the end of the runway.
Just before the tree, loop around until you are flying upside down.  Then when
you have more speed, loop around the other way until you are the right way up
again.

                                 ~~~~~~~~

Your plane will lose speed if your throttle is off, or if you fly up at a
steep angle.  If you lose too much speed, your plane will fall out of the sky.
By listening to the tone of your engine, you will get to know when your plane
is about to stall.  In this case, point your nose down to speed up again.  If
you do stall, point straight down, push forward and "head for the deck" to
get up as much speed as you can, then pull out of the dive right at the last
moment - you may be able to recover from the stall if you were high up.

                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The two runways are a fairly long way apart, separated by fields and a wide
river.  At each end of the battlefield is a tall cliff.  Flying into a cliff,
the river or the ground will destroy your plane.  If you fly over the top of
one of the cliffs, you come out at the other side.  Also, when flying at low
altitude, remember to look out for the two trees.  Flying into the top of the
screen will @{"stall" link STALLING} your plane.

                                  ~~~~~~~

Each plane is normally fitted with two bombs. When one is dropped (by pulling
back on the stick), a bomb icon disappears from the info panel at the bottom
of the screen.  These bombs are not replenished until you get a new plane.

When a bomb is dropped, it will have the same horizontal velocity as your
plane. If you are flying level, the bomb will fly forwards as it drops, so
you will need to drop the bomb before you get over the target.

@endnode
@node TARGETS
@title "Welcome to Dogfight v1.1!"

                            Targets and Scoring
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Besides the enemy plane, there are other targets around.  Each player has
a hangar and a gun emplacement next to their runway; zeppelins periodically
appear in the sky; and submarines sometimes surface in the river.

Hitting any enemy target will increase your score.  Planes are worth one
point; everything else is worth two points.  If you crash your plane or
destroy your own forces, the other player gets the points.  Sometimes you
may even be shot down by "friendly fire" - this also gives the other player
the points.

Zeppelins and submarines have coloured markings to tell you whether they are
friendly or not.  British forces have yellow markings, and German forces have
red markings.  Also, German forces always go right to left, and British
forces always go from left to right.

Zeppelins are armed with a gun similar to the one in your plane, but it can't
fire as often.  They are deadly accurate and are just about guaranteed to hit
you if you don't take evasive action.  Zeppelins can only be destroyed by
gunfire.

Submarines are armed with a flak gun.  You will hear the shot and see a flash
from the submarine's deck.  Soon afterwards there will be a flash of smoke in
the sky where the shell explodes.  If it hits you, you're dead. Submarines
can only be destroyed by bombs.

Airbases have a hangar and an anti-aircraft gun.  Each emplacement is worth
two points, and can only be destroyed by bombs.  The AA gun is well defended
and needs a very accurate hit from a bomb to dispatch it. It will be replaced
soon after it is destroyed, sometimes with a very nasty flak gun like the one
submarines have.  Hangars are rebuilt only occasionally.

The enemy plane can be destroyed by gunfire in a dogfight, or can be bombed
or strafed while on the ground.  You can also try to bomb the enemy plane in
the air if you like!

                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

v1.1 (1995)

  * Bug fixes

   Occasionally in v1.0, the German plane would just explode repeatedly on
   the runway.  I initially attributed this to my computer's dislike of
   sauerkraut, but then I discovered it was actually a BUG in the collision
   detection routine (horror)!  This has been fixed.

   The game is now fully AGA-compatible - the screen no longer comes up
   corrupted on AGA machines.

  * Zeppelins and submarines can shoot

   Zeppelins now carry an AA gun and they are damn accurate, too.  Subs
   carry flak guns which are less accurate but difficult to dodge.

  * Base Defence

   Your home base is now defended by a gun.  The gun can be destroyed, but
   it reappears soon after.  This makes shooting the other player on the
   ground a risky business.

  * Improved graphics

   Now uses 32 colours instead of 16, and many more frames of animation.

v1.0 (1990)

   The original!
