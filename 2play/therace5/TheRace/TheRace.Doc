0. Files
========
This package consist of 5 files :

 `TheRace'		: Main Program (the game)
 `TheRace.info'		: Icon  (not MagicWB yet)
 `TheRace.Hi'		: Hi-Score file
 `TheRace.Doc'		: Instructions text file
 `File.id'		: BBS description text
 
Please, spread the complete package; the main program will work without the
extra files, but they don't waste too much disk space so copy them too.
You don't need any external library or file to run this game.


1. Introduction
===============
`THE RACE' is a little PD game, just a 100 meters dash race simulator for
0 to 4 players.This game was 100% made in assembler and is fully compatible
with all AMIGA models and Kickstart versions (I hope).

Warning : `THE RACE' isn't a 100% multitask program, so I recommend don't use
it while running other Amiga programs to avoid serious problems (like GURUS).


2. Instructions
===============
Use the following keys during the game:
  SPACE  : Start RACE
  FIRE   : Start RACE (Joystick in port 2)

  ESC    : Exit program and SAVE new records in your SYS: device.
  F10    : Turn ON/OFF the music.
  DEL    : Show WORLD RECORDS table.
  HELP   : Show the HELP page.
  RETURN : Show a new INFO page.

  F1 - F8: Change CONTROL MODE of the 8 runners.
  Q      : Quit race.

During the race waggle your joystick the fastest you can.
JoySticks are fully recommended, maybe I will release a special JoyPad
version or even add Keyboard/Mouse support if enough people ask for it.
For the 3 and 4 players RACE you need the usual parallel 4 PLAYERS ADAPTOR.

Note that records are only saved when you exit (using ESC key) the game.
Records are loaded and saved in your main dir (DF0: or DH0:), so maybe
the program will ask you to insert or deprotect the disk with your records
at the start to load it or at the end to save the new records.If you don't
want to load or save the records just select CANCEL in the requester.


3. `THE RACE' competition
=========================
To enter this competition, you must send me your RECORD times.The best
times received will be included in the next versions of this game.
Everybody can enter this competition and there isn't a closing date, just
send a disk with the file `TheRace.Hi' and some good PD Games, Demos or
Utilities.If your time is among the best times received, your name and
time will be included in the next version of this game.
The type of joystick used to establish your record is welcome too.
 
 NOTE : Sorry, but the old Hi-score files (previous to Version 1.2) don't
 	work now, so don't send it.Sure you can beat your old records.


4. What is OriginalWare ?
=========================
This game is OriginalWare.That means if you like this game you must buy
an original Amiga program or game, there are lots of great Amiga software
like `Goal', `LionHeart', `Hired Guns', `Syndicate', `Cannon Foder',
`Pinball Fantasies', `Stardust' and a lot more that you won't never
regret to spend your money.
Or you can send the money to the author of any ShareWare program or game
you are using often.

If you do this you support Amiga, and if you support AMIGA you support US.

 IMPORTANT NOTE :
 	`THE RACE' V 1.2 is licensed to `CYNOSTIC PD'.
And they have permission to sell following versions and updates.

 TO MAGAZINES :
If you want to use this game on your coverdisk or you are
reviewing the game, then please send me a copy of the magazine.

OriginalWare is a new concept (I think so) conceived by me; for more
information or suggestions about OriginalWare you can contact me.
 Support OriginalWare software and you will get better software.
