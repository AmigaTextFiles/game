SuperDodge is an addictive two player game. Each player has a single control
with which he is to stop his line from crashing into objects in the way.
Player 1 uses the left mouse button to travel up, and lets go of the button
to travel down. Player 2 uses the joystick fire button in a similar way.

Upon starting the game, you will be presented with an options screen. Select
your dificulty settings, speed settings and select one or two players. Once
finished, press the GO button in the bottom right hand corner.

Player one is in yellow at the top of the screen. Player two is in red at the
bottom of the screen. Apart from the colours, the two screens are identical.
This makes the game fair. The object is to guide your line out of the hole to
the right of the screen.

The winner of the game is the player who scores 200 points first. Scoring is
as follows:

Start bonus: 10 points.
Each sucessful completed level: Bonus is added to your score, then your bonus
                                gains 20 points.
Each crashed line: Bonus is reset to 10 points.
Each level where you got further than your opponant: 1 point.

You'll get the hang of that after a few competative matches.

The display:

L: Level.    The current number of games played.
B: Bonus.    The player's bonus score.
S: Score.    The player's current score.

This game was written ages ago. This means that there could be any number of
bugs in the code. I'm not too interested in keeping this game alive, so if
you do spot any bugs and actually want to fix them, you're entitled to the
Amos source code. Be warned though, it's a real mess :)

Enjoy,
