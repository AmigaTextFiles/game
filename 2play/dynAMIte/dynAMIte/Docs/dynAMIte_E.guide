@{B}@{FG Highlight}¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯@{UB}@{FG Text}

There are two ways to install @{B}dynAMIte@{UB}:

@{B}@{U}Method 1 (The easy way)@{UU}@{UB}:

    Extract the dynAMIte archive (i'm guessing you already have, since you're
    reading this) and copy the dynAMIte directory wherever you want to keep it.

@{B}@{U}Method 2 (The easier way)@{UU}@{UB}:

    Use the provided installer script which will not only install dynAMIte
    but also help you to configure it.

@{B}@{FG Highlight}¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯@{UB}@{FG Text}

dynAMIte can be started from the shell/cli or Workbench and supports the
following cli arguments/tooltypes:

    @{B}NOSOUND@{UB}
        This option disables all sound output. The result
        (apart from having no sound) is that some slow
        systems may get an extra speed boost.

    @{B}NOCGX@{UB}
        With this switch you can force dynAMIte not to use
        cybergraphics. If you are running dynAMIte on an AGA
        system and are having problems with the graphics then
        try running dynAMIte with this switch turned on.

    @{B}ANTIBLANKTIME@{UB}
        dynAMIte has a feature to prevent screen savers from going active
        if you play for a long time using only a joypad/joystick. With this
        option you can set the delay (in seconds) between two faked input
        events which will be fool the screen saver into thinking you moved
        the mouse or pressed a key. Setting this option to 0 will switch off
        this feature. The default is 0.

    @{B}STYLE@{UB}
        This option lets you choose which style (graphics set) dynAMIte should
        use. To select a style just give this option the name of the style
        (e.g STYLE=dynAMIte or STYLE=winter).

    @{B}TASKPRI@{UB}
        This option lets you set the task priority of dynAMIte. This may make
        the client perform better on slower systems.
        
    @{B}PROXY@{UB}
        If your ISP requires you to use a proxy server, you need to set the
        proxy server with this option in order to get the GSL (Global Server
        List) working.

    @{B}PROXYPORT@{UB}
        Set the port of the proxy server using this option.

    @{B}PRECISION@{UB}
        If you feel that dynAMIte uses too many pens from your palette or
        you think the graphics could be a bit more detailed, then you
        should experiment with this option. Possible values are:

        @{B}ICON@{UB} - Worst quality.
        @{B}GUI@{UB} - Poor quality.
        @{B}IMAGE@{UB} - Good quality.
        @{B}EXACT@{UB} - Best quality (will use the most pens).

    @{B}PUPPET@{UB}
        This new feature of dynAMIte 2.1 lets you use custom graphics for your
        puppet instead of the puppet gfx included in the style you are using.
        dynAMIte by default will look for custompuppet.gfx, custompuppet.msk
        and custompuppet.otl in the dynAMIte/Styles directory (Note: the
        custom puppet gfx should not be in a sub directory of dynAMIte/Styles).
        If you have created your own custom puppet gfx and saved it as
        something different that custompuppet.gfx/msk/otl then you need to pass
        the name of your custom puppet gfx (without an extension) to this
        option, for example: PUPPET=davar

    @{B}WB@{UB}
        Using this switch you can force dynAMIte to run on the Workbench
        screen. This may be handy if you are low on memory.
        
    @{B}NOGFX@{UB}
        This option is useful if you have a couple of mates around and you are
        playing a game locally. It turns off graphics to reduce CPU usage and
        the client is used for player input only.

    @{B}PLAYERNAME@{UB}
        This option lets you set the name you will use while you are playing or
        chatting. The name will appear in the chat window and during game play.
        Short names are preferred.
        
    @{B}PASSWORD@{UB}
        This option lets you set the password for the name you are using. The
        password is required to prevent anyone from stealing your name.
        
    @{B}CHANNELS@{UB}
        Using this option you can set the number of channels dynAMIte should
        use for sound effects. The default is 12 channels. The minimum value
        for this option is 8, the maximum is any number you can think of.
            Please keep in mind, that dynAMIte needs five channels for special
        sound effects, like laser and magnet loop. Also bomb ticks need two
        channels. So, setting channels to 8 would mean, you only have 3 channels
        for sound effects.

@{B}@{U}Entering your playername/password@{UU}@{UB}

    After you have started dynAMIte you will see the connection window. If you
    did not set a player name or password then you should enter your player
    name in the "Your name" gadget (how obvious is that? ;) and your password
    in the "Password" gadget. If you do not enter a password then it will be
    possible for someone else to use your player name when you are not playing.

@{B}@{U}Selecting a server@{UU}@{UB}

    First enter the port dynAMIte should try to connect on in the "Port" gadget.
    The port number is usually 6318 (guess why it's 6318. Not that easy but
    solvable). Next you need to select a server to connect to. There are two
    ways of doing this:

    @{B}@{U}Method 1 (The hard way)@{UU}@{UB}:

    Enter the host name or ip address of your preferred server in the "Host/IP"
    gadget. Now press the "Connect" button to connect.

    @{B}@{U}Method 2 (The easy way)@{UU}@{UB}:

    Click the "Global Server List" button, after a few seconds a
    window will appear which shows a list of dynAMIte servers. To connect
    simply double click on a server.

@{B}@{U}The Login Window@{UU}@{UB}

    If all went well you will presented with the login screen which shows you
    who is logged in and what they are doing. To start a battle simply click
    the "Battle" button or press the fire button on your joystick/joypad. A
    battle can only be started when there is no other player currently playing.
    The "P" button in the login window will switch you between observer and
    player modes. If you want to switch slots you can do so by holding down
    the shift key and pressing the left/right cursor keys to go to the slot
    to the left or right of the slot you are currently.

@{B}@{U}When you've had enough@{UU}@{UB}

    To disconnect (what? disconnect? why would you wanna do that? :) you can
    press the "Disconnect" button or use the corresponding menu item from the
    Project menu and you will be taken back to the connection window.

Should you get bored of getting killed/winning then you might want to throw
some small insults at your tormentor or humiliate your victims by bragging
about how many times you killed them in one game etc...
    If this is the case then below is a list of commands that can be typed
into the string gadget of the chat window.

    @{B}/map [mapname]@{UB}
        If the map name is not given, this command will return the current map
        name, else the server will try to find a map with the given name and
        use it, if found, for the next game.

    @{B}/me@{UB}
        This command is known from IRC. Use it when you do something that
        other people can't see (like: /me is going to get food, or /me is
        a graphics card and PPC owning smug git, etc...)
        
    @{B}/msg <msgtext>@{UB}
        Another IRC style command. Sends a private message to another player.
        
    @{B}/ping@{UB}
        Pings all connected clients and the server and shows you their response
        times. No arguments. Does not work from the DServer chat window.
        
    @{B}/info <player>@{UB}
        Displays the specified player's system and other information.
        
    @{B}/stats <player>@{UB}
        Shows you the rank and other highscore information of a specific
        player.
        
    @{B}/score <#>@{UB}
        Shows you the highscore information of a player at a specific position
        in the highscore list.
        
    @{B}/pause@{UB}
        If you decide you need a break, use this command to switch to observer
        mode and watch the other players battle.
        
    @{B}/setpw <password>@{UB}
        Changes your password to the specified password. If you do not specify
        a new password, your current password will be cleared.
        
    @{B}/request <mapfilename>@{UB}
        Downloads a map from the vault. You need to know the exact filename of
        the map.
        
    @{B}/team@{UB}
        New for dynAMIte 2.1 is team mode. In this mode players 1, 2, 5 and 6
        become a team and players 3, 4, 7 and 8 become a team. To find out
        more, click @{"here" LINK "GTeam"}.
        
    @{B}/unteam@{UB}
        This command will deactivate team mode. See @{"here" LINK "GTeam"}
        for more information.
        
    @{B}/quit [msg]@{UB}
        This command will disconnect you from the server (if you are connected)
        and quit dynAMIte. If you specify the msg argument the other players
        will see this message.
        
    @{B}/disconnect [msg]@{UB}
        This command will disconnect you from the server. If you specify the
        msg argument the other players will see this message.
        
    @{B}/repeat@{UB}
        This command tells the server to use the current map for the next
        game.
        
    @{B}/fps@{UB}
        This command sends an FPS (Frames Per Second) request to all connected
        clients. Each client will respond with their current FPS count.
        
    @{B}/whois@{UB}
        This command is an alias of the /info command.
        
    @{B}/hops@{UB}
        This command shows the number of hops between each player (including    
        yourself) and the server.
        
    @{B}/loadbot [slotnumber]@{UB}
        With this command you can load a CPU player on to the server. Quite
        handy for practice sessions. Also very handy if you are getting your
        butt kicked and need something to distract your enemy ;). It's now
        possible to specify the slot where to load the bot.
        
    @{B}/kickbot [slotnumber]@{UB}
        If you get tired of playing against the bot(s) you can use this
        command to get rid of them. This command only removes one bot at
        a time. It's now possible to specify which slot from which the 
        unlucky bot is kicked.
        
    @{B}/time@{UB}
        Using this command you can get the local time of each client and
        the server.
        
    @{B}/help@{UB}
        This command shows a list of commands (how fascinating ;).
        
    @{B}/?@{UB}
        This command is an alias for the /help command.
        
    @{B}/compact@{UB}
    	This command makes the player stats in the game window more
    	compact. This command acts as a toggle that will switch
    	the stats between the full and compact forms.
        
    @{B}ping@{UB}

Team mode is a new feature of dynAMIte 2.1. In this mode players 1, 2, 5 and 6
become team one and players 3, 4, 7 and 8 become team two. You cannot kill
players on your own team nor can they kill you. To activate team mode you have
to type /team in the chat window. The number of players required to activate
team mode depends on the number of players that are on the server. The table
below shows how many players are needed to activate team mode.

    +-------------------+--------------------------------------+
    | Players on server | Players needed to activate team mode |
    +-------------------+--------------------------------------+
    | 8                 |  5                                   |

When team mode is active there are a few changes that will take place:

    @{B}Bomb colours@{UB}
        Team one (players 1, 2, 5 and 6) and team two (players 3, 4, 7 and 8)
        will drop different coloured bombs. The colours of the bombs are defined
        by the style you are using. Map bombs will still be the same red colour
        they always were.
        
    @{B}The drop all power up@{UB}
        When a player from either team picks up the drop all power up, the
        bomb they drop will be the other team's bomb.
        
    @{B}Other power-ups@{UB}
        When team mode is active, the following power-ups will not have
        any effect on players in the same team:
        
        Decrease Fuselength.
        Increase Fuselength.
        Decrease Flamelength.
        Swap controls (commonly referred to as the 'Reverser' power-up).
        Decrease Bombs.
        No Drop.

The purpose of the F-keys is to display a short message in a bubble while
playing the game. Only 8 characters of a message will be displayed at a
time. A space in your message will put the part of the message after the
space into another bubble.

It is possible to define up to 100 messages in 10 F-Key banks. Just have
a look at the F-Key settings available from the settings menu.

Pressing 0 to 9 on the keyboard while playing will switch the banks. Pressing
F-1 to F-10 while playing will display a bubble with the specified message
from the currently active bank.

The messages can contain colour codes. There are two ways to enter colour codes
The first way is using ASCII codes 1 - 8 for the foreground and 246 - 252 for
the background. The colours you get for each code depend on the style you use.
You can see the colours by looking at the login screen, the colour of player 1
is the colour you will get for ASCII codes 1 and 246, the colour of player 2 is
the colour you get for ascii codes 2 and 247, etc...

You can enter ASCII codes 1 - 8 using CTRL-A to CTRL-H.

The table below lists the keys for entering ASCII codes 246 - 252 and the
character that is generated when pressing that key.

    +------+-----------+--------------+
    | Code | Character | Key          |
    +------+-----------+--------------+
    | 246  | ö         | ALT-K o      |
    +------+-----------+--------------+
    | 247  | ÷         | ALT-SHIFT x  |
    +------+-----------+--------------+
    | 248  | ø         | ALT-O        |
    +------+-----------+--------------+
    | 249  | ù         | ALT-G u      |

    +------+-----------+--------------+
    | 252  | ü         | ALT-K u      |
    +------+-----------+--------------+

The second (and much easier) way of entering color codes is by entering
@t[x] (where x is a number between 1 and 8) to change the text color
and @b[x] (again, x is a number between 1 and 8) to change the background
of the bubble.

The game window has to be active for the bubbles to work.

Although dynAMIte wasn't intended for playing local only, it is possible to
play local with up to three players. @{B}Two@{UB} using the joysticks
and @{B}one@{UB} on the keyboard. The player on the keyboard needs to make
sure that his window is the active window. Playing local is not recommended
because each player has their own window and this makes the game a lot slower
and less fun to play. If you do play local, the two players using the joysticks
should start dynAMIte with the NOGFX option to get a speed boost.

First you have to start your favourite TCP/IP stack.

If you are the server and want to play, just start the client and tick the
"Local" button (next to the "Host/IP" string gadget) and enter 6318 as the 
port and then press connect. This also goes for the above mentioned local
play with three players.

There is one certain player who has played more games than anyone else and
is currently (01.07.2002) at the top of the GHS (Global High Score) table.
His name is Ingo.
    Contrary to popular belief, Ingo can be killed by intelligent use of
power ups, and a little luck. There are various tricks that you can use
(Note: these tricks will work on any player, not just Ingo :) to help
you win. The names for these tricks are unofficial and have been invented
by me (Davar).

    @{B}Trick 1: "Blow up or Fry up, it's your choice buddy"@{UB}
        For this trick you need a laser. Look for a player who has laid a
        bomb and is waiting for it to explode. If the player is surrounded
        by blocks on three sides you can block him/her in using your laser
        and the player can choose to get fried by your laser or blown up
        by his/her own bomb.
        
    @{B}Trick 2: "Kill em' with kindness"@{UB}
        Sometimes you have to be kind to be cruel. For this trick you need a
        heart power up and some patience. Lay a bomb next to the grave of an
        already dead player, then just before the bomb goes off, pick up the
        heart power up, the dead player gets resurrected and immediately dies
        again.
        
    @{B}Trick 3: "Poison, Cure, Poison, Cure..."@{UB}
        If you pick up five skulls you get maximum bombs and flame length    
        as well a shield and a faster pair of shoes. So, if someone comes
        at you and they have fartgas, try to get poisoned then pick up the
        skulls that appear (which are the only way to cure fartgas poisoning)
        if you do this enough times you will eventually collect 5 skulls and
        end up with max bombs, max flamelength, increased speed, and a shield.
        
    @{B}Trick 4: "Sweep 'em off their feet"@{UB}
        This is one of my favorite tricks and if executed correctly is quite
        impressive. To pull this one off you need a long flamelength and the
        map should have very few or (better still) no blocks at all. All you
        have to do is lay your bombs in a diagonal line so that they explode
        almost immediately after each other. This creates a kind of sweeping
        effect which looks cool and it is almost impossible for other players
        to survive. For best performance you should also have a long burn time.
        
    @{B}Trick 5: "Stop 'em dead"@{UB}
        This trick is more practical than anything, it is not really impressive
        at all. Just pick up a stop power-up then follow that up with a drop
        all power-up. The result is that all players (except yourself of
        course) die from the blast of their own bombs. As I said, not very
        impressive. You must make sure that you pick up the drop all power-up
        almost immediately after the stop power-up otherwise the effect of the
        stop power-up may wear off before the bombs explode.
        
    @{B}Trick 6: "Dot to dot"@{UB}
        This is another of my favourites. You need a long flamelength and
        nothing else. Simply run around the map dropping bombs at some
        distance from each other. Make sure that the blast of each bomb
        will set off the next bomb, then make sure you are out of the way
        and wait for the first bomb to go off. Some players get caught out
        by this one others don't, but it looks nice if nothing else ;).
        
    @{B}Trick 7: "Knight, Knight"@{UB}
        This trick is quite difficult to pull off (unless you happen to be
        Ingo, who seems to be able to pull this one off almost every time).
        Look for a player who has dropped a bomb and is waiting for it to
        go off. If they are stood at a diagonal to the bomb then wait until
        just before their bomb blows (listen to the bomb tick sound effect)
        and place a bomb next to the player and get out of the way. The
        result is that when their bomb goes off so does yours and they don't
        have time to run away. A long flame length helps a lot too.
        
    @{B}Trick 8: "Aloha, I am GOD"@{UB}
        This trick isn't really a trick, but it does make you sort of
        invincible for a short while. All you need is to get some shields, a
        laser, max flamelength, long burn time, max bombs and fartgas, then
        just chase the other players around while laying bombs, eventually
        you'll kill someone. While you're having fun laying bombs all over the
        place keep an eye on your sheilds, if they run out and you've just
        dropped a whole load of bombs and you have nowhere to hide, you're
        basically buggered.
        
    @{B}Trick 9: "Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, time to commit suicide"@{UB}
        If someone comes at you with a laser and you don't have the speed to
        outrun them, wait until there are no more blocks between you and the
        laser then lay a bomb, if you flamelength is long enough they will set
        off the bomb, you will die and so will they. If you and the laser dude
        were the only players left, then no one wins and no one loses.

    @{B}Trick 10: "Killin' all the birds with one stone"@{UB}
        For this trick you need to find a transport all power up that
        is surrounded by three blocks. Go pick up the power up, and then
        lay a bomb next to where the transport all power up was so that
        you close off the three blocks leaving a gap in the middle. All
        the other players get transported into this gap and are killed
        by the explosion.
        
    @{B}Trick 11: "Killin' all the birds with more than one stone"@{UB}
        This trick uses the same principles as trick 10 but works a little
        different. For this trick you need maximum flame length and
        maximum bombs (it can be done with only a few bombs if your fuse
        length is short enough). All you have to do is run at a transport all
        power-up while dropping bombs behind you and try to get an equal number
        of bombs on each side of the transport all power up. When you pick
        up the transport all power up, all players are transported and
        are stood in front of a load of bombs that will explode quite soon.
        
        This trick is a little harder to pull off than trick ten, but is a
        little more impressive.

        Set the port of the proxy server using this option.
        
    @{B}NOMAPS@{UB}
        This switch forces DServer not to scan the dynAMIte/Maps directory.
        which is not really all that useful. It is mainly used for testing.
        The only map which will be available will be the "Standard" map.
    
    @{B}FORCEENG@{UB}
        This switch forces DServer to use the built-in english strings
        instead of loading the catalog for the language you are using.

Once you have the server up and running you will see a window which shows
a list with entries for 8 players and 8 observers. Every line in this list
starts with a "Kick" button. This button is useful if for example a player
lost the connection but is still logged in and blocks a slot.

Below the list there are two sliders. The first slider is used to set the
maximum number of connections/players DServer will accept. If you have
ISDN or slower, a good value for this is 4. The second slider allows you to
limit the number of observers DServer will accept.

If you tick the "List Server" checkmark, your server will be listed in the GSL
(Global Server List) at http://server.amigazeux.net. This list shows the you
how many servers are currently online, how many players each server accepts and
of course the host name/IP address.

The "Start Battle" button starts a new battle, and the "Stop Battle" button
will stop the battle and tell all clients to abort the battle and return to
the login screen.

@{B}@{U}The Maps Window@{UU}@{UB}

The "Maps" button at the bottom of the DServer window opens the maps window
which contains a list of all available maps. Below the map list there are some
buttons. The "Rescan Maps" button will rescan the maps directory. The
"Random Map" checkmark will make the server select a random map for each
game. The "Mirror Maps Randomly" checkmark will make the server rotate the
map. The "Hide PowerUps"button will make all powerups appear as question marks.

On the right side of the maps window is a list which gives a preview of the
currently selected map.

@{B}@{U}The High Score window@{UU}@{UB}

The "Users" button at the bottom of the DServer window opens the highscore
window which contains a list of players that have played on your server and
the scores for each player. The string gadget at the top of the window can
be used to search for a specific player, just type the name of the player and
press the search button and if the player is found, that player's entry in the
list will be selected. The "Delete" button will delete the selected entry from
the list, the "Clear Password" button does exactly what it says and the "Change
Password" button opens a window that lets you change the password of the
selected player. The "Save Users" button will save the list.

@{B}@{U}The Game Monitor window@{UU}@{UB}

The "GM" button at the bottom of the DServer window opens the game monitor window
which shows a minature map so you to monitor a game in progress.

@{B}@{U}The Chat window@{UU}@{UB}

The "Chat" button at the bottom of the DServer window opens the server chat
window, where you can chat to the players on your server. Note that the
commands that can be used in the dynAMIte chat window cannot be used here.

This page of settings contains important details about your server.

    @{B}Servername@{UB}
        You should enter the name of your server here.

    @{B}Sysopname@{UB}
        This should contain your name. It is also possible to enter any other
        name here, but who wants to confuse the players?

    @{B}Serverhost@{UB}
        You should enter the host name of your server here. If you do not
        have a static host name, you should use a dynamic DNS service, so
        that players will be able to use this host name to connect. If you
        leave this gadget empty, DServer will take the IP as the host name
        which is handy if you don't have a static host name and you are not
        using a dynamic DNS service.

    @{B}Server IP@{UB}
        If you have a static IP, you should set the cycle-gadget to static
        and enter your static IP address in the string gadget. If you have
        a dynamic IP address, set the cycle-gadget to dynamic and leave the
        string gadget empty.
        
    @{B}Location@{UB}
        You should enter the physical location of your server here so that
        the players have some clue where the server is located, for example:
        "Hamburg / Germany" or "London / UK".
        
    @{B}Upstream Speed@{UB}
        You should set this to a value which matches your upstream connection
        speed, if none of the values in the cycle-gadget match, set the
        cycle-gadget to "other" and enter your upstream speed in the string
        gadget.
        
    @{B}Downstream Speed@{UB}
        You should set this to a value which matches your downstream connection
        speed, if none of the values in the cycle-gadget match, set the
        cycle-gadget to "other" and enter your downstream speed in the string
        gadget.
        
    @{B}Allow UDP for connections@{UB}
        Tick this checkmark and players will be able to connect to your server
        using UDP. UDP is somewhat faster than TCP/IP for a fast game like
        dynAMIte, but it is also unreliable and need slightly more bandwidth.
        
    @{B}Pingwatch@{UB}
        This slider sets the pingwatch value. Pingwatch is meant for those
        times when someone is lagging heavily and it spoils the game for
        everyone else. Pingwatch is active all the time and cannot be turned
        off.
        
        It works as follows: The server will calculate every two minutes and
        automatically average the pings of all (except the player to check)
        players, add them together and divide them by the total number of
        players. This is the average ping of all players (apoap), Any player
        who lags for longer than apoap + pingwatch will be kicked from the
        server. If that player rejoins the server and still lags too much
        (s)he will be kicked again.
        
        A good value for ping watch is 2 seconds, it will keep game more
        playable.

DServer is able to execute commands when certain events occur.
This can be used to output a notify to some chat window (IRC for example) if
a user logs on to your server.

The events should be pretty much self explanatory. Note that when DServer
launches an ARexx script it will prefix "rx" to the script name and will
launch the script @{B}synchronously@{UB} to the server task.
When a shell command is launched it is launched @{B}Asynchronously@{UB}.

DServer offers a small ARexx port that provides you with commands to get some
information on the current state of the server. For example you can read the
highscore data from the server and create a html page of the high scores
semi-automatically.

    @{B}GETSLOT NUM/N@{UB}
        If you don't pass the @{B}NUM@{UB} argument this command will return
        the number of slots available on the server.
        
        If you do pass @{B}NUM@{UB} this command will return some data about
        the slot number passed in. The returned data is a string in the
        following format:
        
        @{B}WON GAMES LOGINS FIRSTLOGINDATE FIRSTLOGINTIME LASTLOGINDATE LASTLOGINTIME STATUS USERNAME@{UB}
        
        This command returns @{B}OUTOFRANGE@{UB} if @{B}NUM@{UB} is not between
        1 and the maximum number of slots available.
        
        This command returns @{B}EMPTY@{UB} is no one is logged on.

    @{B}GETSCORE NUM/N,TEAM/S@{UB}
        If you don't pass @{B}NUM@{UB} you will get the total number of players
        in the high score table. Passing @{B}NUM@{UB} will return a string in
        this format:
        
        @{B}WON GAMES LOGINS FIRSTLOGINDATE FIRSTLOGINTIME LASTLOGINDATE LASTLOGINTIME USERNAME@{UB}
        
        This command returns @{B}OUTOFRANGE@{UB} if @{B}NUM@{UB} is not between 1
        and the number of entries in the high score table.
     
        The @{B}TEAM@{UB} switch will return the team scores instead of the single

This article was written by Craig @{B}Hercules@{UB} Daines and contains some
handy hints on setting up DServer. Part of this article describes setting
up a dynamic DNS account with dhs.org, however, there are other dynamic DNS
services available. Here is the article:

In this article, I shall be discussing how you can set up your own DynAMite
server. For UK players, I have setup a United Kingdom server to allow UK
players to log in and join in with the fun. You can find my server online
usually between 8-9pm Daylight Saving Time (BST) at herc.23.2y.net. See you all
there!

@{B}@{U}Setting up an account via dhs.org@{UU}@{UB}

In order to run the dynAMIte DServer program to set up your own dynAMite server
we first need to set up an account at http://www.dhs.org to assign your dynamic
IP to a hostname for your server. You first need to sign up to the dhs.org to
do this.

Go to http://www.dhs.org. Click on 'Signup' on dhs.org web page to take you to
the sign-up section. You are required to enter your user id, name
(not nickname!) and e-mail address. If you choose a name or user id that is
already in use, try adding a number on the end, e.g. 230. Once you have filled
out all boxes, click 'Signup'. You will need to agree to the terms and
conditions once you have completed this. You should receive a confirmation mail
which is sent straight from dhs.org to your e-mail address. Once you have
completed this, you can then go to http://members.dhs.org/nic/ (or click on
login page) to log into your dhs.org account.

@{B}@{U}Logging into your dhs.org account and setting up@{UU}@{UB}

Log into your dhs.org account (you will be prompted to enter your user id and
password). Once you are logged in we need to click on 'Host Maintenance - 
Add host'. This section allows you to add a host to your account. For hostname,
select 'Dynamic' and click on 'next'. You will be taken to the next menu which
is 'Host Maintenance - Add Static host'.

For domain name, change the cycle gadget to 2y.net. For hostname, choose the
name of you wish to call your DynAMite server, e.g. MyDServer. This example
will give your dynAMite server the name: MYDServer.2y.net.

For the IP box, you have to enter your IP. Your IP is different everytime you
connected to the internet, and can be found within Miami (go to Miami -->
Database --> Hosts) to find out your current IP and enter it into the IP box.

Leave the Mail Exchanger and Wildcards boxes blank. When you're done, click
'Add'. Your dhs.org account is now set up!.

@{B}@{U}Things to bear in mind when using dhs.org@{UU}@{UB}

    1)  You are only permitted to log into your dhs.org up to three times every
        15 minutes. If you log into dhs.org @{B}MORE@{UB} than three times your dhs.org
        account will be terminated, so be careful.

    2)  You can only have @{B}ONE@{UB} dhs.org account per e-mail address.

    3)  You will need to follow section 'Setting up an account via dhs.org'
        EVERYTIME you use Miami to connect to the internet before you run
        DServer, and to check your dynamic IP has been remapped to your
        server's hostname by using MiamiResolve.

@{B}@{U}Setting up DServer@{UU}@{UB}

Firstly, I would like to mention that you @{B}ALWAYS@{UB} need to go to
http://www.dhs.org to remap your IP address to your dynAMite server's hostname
(via dhs.org) @{B}EVERYTIME@{UB} your server is started. Go to Miami --> Database -->
Hosts and find out your dynamic IP there, and enter into dhs.org everytime you
connected to the internet before running DServer!.

So bear in mind, everytime before you start DServer, you will need to do the
following:

Go to http://www.dhs.org, click 'Login' which will take you to 'Host
Maintenance' menu, where you should see the hostname for your server. Click on
the button gadget next to the hostname of your account, and click 'Edit'. You
will then be taken to the next screen to enter your dynamic IP (Find it out in
Miami --> Database --> hosts). When your IP has been typed in the IP box you
can click 'Update' and dhs.org will then remap your IP to your server's
hostname.

It normally takes around 10-15 minutes before dhs.org has remapped your dynamic
IP to your hostname. If you choose the name: MyDServer.2y.net for your hostname
on http://dhs.org, you can check your dynamic IP has been remapped to your
hostname by typing:-

    @{B}Miami:MiamiResolve MyDServer.2y.net@{UB}

This would for instance display:-

    @{B}host: Hercules.2y.net@{UB}
    @{B}address list: 218-222-467-221@{UB}

Check to see if the address list that MiamiResolve returns is the same as in
Miami --> Database --> hosts. If it isn't, try checking again with MiamiResolve
(again) as I've described above. Once the address list that MiamiResolve
returns is the same one as in Miami --> Database --> Hosts, you will know your
dynamic IP has been remapped to your hostname on dhs.org. Be patient though,
it can take about 5-10 minutes for dhs.org to perform the update. Once
MiamiResolve has confirmed that your dynamic IP has been changed to the same
one in Miami --> Database --> Hosts (as I've described), you can fire up
DServer and tick 'List Server' to place your dynAMite server online.

@{B}@{U}Configuring DServer@{UU}@{UB}

The next step is to set up DServer, so run DServer by double click it (you'll
find it in the dynAMite drawer).

    1)  Once DServer is run, if you are running a 56kbs modem, set Player Limit
        to: 4, Observer Limit to: 2. I would strongly recommend an '060 and
        high speed serial. My old '040 use to choke with 4 players and 2
        observers 8-(

    2)  Open DServer preferences by choosing 'Settings' from the settings menu.
        This will open the dynAMite server settings. Follow the following
        example:-

        For Sysop name, type your nickname, e.g. Hercules.

        For Server name, type in the name you wish to call your server, e.g.
        Hercules' Dungeons.

        For Server Location: choose the name of your country.

        For Up/Downstream Connection Speed: Click on the cycle gadget opposite
        and select 56K modem (if your using a 56K modem).

        Now click 'ok'.

@{B}@{U}Greeting players as they log into your server@{UU}@{UB}

You can have a standard greeting MOTD text to greet dynAMite players as they
log into your server. Load a text editor, and type something like:-

    @{B}Hi. You are logged into UK dynAMite Server.@{UB}
    @{B}Visit our website at: http://www.your-website-address.com@{UB}

Save this example text file as tgwnn.motd (in dynAMite's drawer).

Right, providing you have checked with MiamiResolve that dhs.org has remapped
to dynamic IP (as I've described earlier) and it matches the one in Miami -->
Database --> Hosts. We can now click the 'List Server' tickbox in DServer.
This will put your server online!

Try logging into your own server by doing the following:-

    1) Run dynAMite.

    2) Click 'Global Server List' button.

    3) GSL server list appears. You should see your server listed.

Try connecting to your own server locally by clicking 'Connect'. If you are
unable to connect using 'Connect' (only 'ConnectIP' works) then either you have
not entered your IP correctly at dhs.org (it must be the same one as in
Miami--> Database --> Hosts). In which case go to section 'Setting up DServer'
(again) !

Or if you still cannot connect to your dynAMite server (only ConnectIP works)
this is because dhs.org has not remapped your dynamic IP to your servers
hostname. Type: Miami:MiamiResolve MyDServer.2y.net (as an example) the host
address MiamiResolve returns must be the same one as listed in Miami -->
Database --> Hosts. Be patient if dhs.org hasn't updated the IP since it can
take about 5-10 minutes sometimes! Just keep checking with MiamiResolve until
IP listed in Miami --> Database --> hosts matches the same IP as MiamiResolve
host address returns.

Once the window is open, you will see the following gadgets:

    @{B}Mapname@{UB}
        Here you should put the name of your map. When dynAMIte tries to find
        a map requested by a player it uses pattern matching, so you must not
        include a hash '#' in your map name.
        
    @{B}Creator@{UB}
        You should put your name here. MapLab will remember the name you put
        here and use it next time for your convenience.
        
    @{B}Comment@{UB}
        You can put a small comment here. It can be up to 31 characters long.
        
    @{B}HurryUp Timeout@{UB}
        dynAMIte has a "hurry up" timeout, if the game has not ended after the
        timeout has ended, a little song is played and power-ups begin to
        randomly appear on the map. You can set this timeout (in seconds) here.
        
    @{B}Mapname for/on JumpMap@{UB}
        If you put a JumpMap power-up on your map, you should select the map
        which will be used when a player picks up the JumpMap power-up. If
        you leave this blank and you have a JumpMap power-up on your map the
        map used will be randomly selected.
        
    @{B}Speed@{UB}
        This sets the initial speed of the players.
        
    @{B}Shield@{UB}
        If you want all players to have a shield when the game is started you
        should tick this checkmark.

Obviously you will want your map to have more than just plain floor on it. So,
you will need to select other blocks and power-ups to lay down on your map. You
select blocks/power-ups from the "Block Selection Window" which can be accessed
by clicking the "Blocks" button at the bottom of the MapLab window.

The block selection window is split into three sections. Section one contains
all the different types of blocks:

    From left to right, the blocks are:
    
    @{B}Blank@{UB}
        This block can be used to erase parts of the map. Any blank blocks
        in your map will be converted to floor blocks when the map is saved.
        
    @{B}Floor@{UB}
        This block is so that players have somewhere to walk ;).
        
    @{B}Indestructible Block@{UB}
        This is just a solid block that cannot be destroyed.
        
    @{B}Normal Block@{UB}
        Normal blocks can be destroyed by the blast of a bomb.
        
    @{B}Bomb@{UB}
        This block is just an initial bomb.
        
    @{B}Exploding Block@{UB}
        This kind of block will turn in to a bomb when it is destroyed.
        
    @{B}Random Block@{UB}
        This kind of block may appear when the game starts or if not,
        it may appear when a player collects an add block power-up.
        
    @{B}Two-hit Block@{UB}
        This kind of block needs to be hit by the blast of a bomb twice before
        it is destroyed.
        
The next section contains the power-ups, which are (from left to right):

    @{B}Increase Flamelength@{UB}
        Increases the flamelength of a player.
        
    @{B}Increase Bombs@{UB}
        Gives a player another bomb.

    @{B}Max Flamelength@{UB}        
        Gives a player full flamelength.
        
    @{B}Max Bombs@{UB}
        Gives a player maximum bombs.
        
    @{B}Add Block@{UB}
        Adds a block to the map at a random position.
        
    @{B}Bombs 2 Blocks@{UB}
        Turns all non-map bombs into normal blocks
        
    @{B}Drop All@{UB}
        Forces all players to drop a bomb.

New for dynAMIte 2.1 are laser blocks, these blocks emit lasers. There are
two types of laser block, the hidden type (laser appears when a block is
destroyed and the visible type. For both types there are four new blocks
(one for each direction. Please note that more than 6 - 8 lasers on a map
will make that map almost unplayable on an 040/25.

    @{B}Visible Laser Down@{UB}
        This is a visible laser block with the laser facing downward.
        
    @{B}Visible Laser Right@{UB}
        This is a visible laser block with the laser facing right.

    @{B}Visible Laser Left@{UB}
        This is a visible laser block with the laser facing left.
        
    @{B}Visible Laser Up@{UB}
        This is a visible laser block with the laser facing up.

    @{B}Hidden Laser Down@{UB}
        This is a hidden laser block with the laser facing downward.
        
    @{B}Hidden Laser Right@{UB}
        This is a hidden laser block with the laser facing right.

    @{B}Hidden Laser Left@{UB}
        This is a hidden laser block with the laser facing left.
        
    @{B}Hidden Laser Up@{UB}
        This is a hidden laser block with the laser facing up.

The last section contains blocks that let you place each of the players.
Note that if you want all players to start at the same place you can just
place the first player and none of the others. Also, if you place player
1 and player 3, and you miss out player 2, then player 2 will start on
the same block as player one and players 4 - 8 will start on the same
block as player three.

When creating maps it is sometimes useful to have a mask or stencil which
prevents you from drawing over certain blocks. You can set which blocks
or power-ups you don't want to draw over using the mask window. This window
is accessed by pressing the "Mask" button at the bottom of the MapLab window.

The mask window is similar to the blocks window and has all the same block and
power-up buttons as the block window. Each of the block/power-up buttons are
toggle buttons, when a button is pressed the block/power-up that the button
represents you will no longer be ale to draw over that block/power-up.

The three buttons at the bottom of the mask window let you invert the mask (i.e
all blocks/power-ups that are overwriteable be come non-overwriteable and
visa-versa, select all of the blocks as non-overwritable and clear the mask.

This section of the manual describes the .bomap file format which dynAMIte uses
to store maps in. A bomap file is a simple ascii text file. The standard
dynAMIte map (which is built-in to DServer, and also happens to be called
"Standard Map") is described below in the bomap format:

A bomap file normally starts with the map title in the first line of the
file. This line is optional and if it's not given, the mapname will be
taken from the filename. Please make sure that a map title does not start
with a # character. This is very important!

From the second line on the map description follows. The first line of the
map descripton is used to compute the width of the whole map, so be careful
to make this line as wide as the map is intended to be.

After the map description there are two optional lines. The first of this
lines contains default values used for the map.

The second optional line can contain the creator of the map. If you don't
pass default values but want the creator to be displayed, just leave the
default values line empty.

After the last line of a map (creator) you can add comments or other stuff
which seems important to you.

Here is a descripton of the default values line of the above example:

Here are a few hints 'n' tips from AxE on map making (and believe me
when i say he knows what he's talking about, he's created about 250
maps in total). I unofficially name this guide: "The Tree Chopping
Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy Of Map Making" ;). Ok, enough messing
around, here it is:

    @{B}@{U}The Totally Non Comprehensive Map Guide@{UU}@{UB}
    
    (1. Try to make it possible to destroy all normal blocks (i.e don't enclose
        blocks within solid walls as this will make the map unable to generate
        a "hurry up" power-up. This is not so much a problem with lots of
        power-ups already in a map but is on bare levels especially when
        players only have short flame and can't kill others until more
        power-ups are collected.
        
    (2. try to resist the temptation to bunch hundreds of the same power-up
        together as besides not looking very well thought out, it creates an
        imbalance in sections of the map. Try to alternate between power-ups
        to give that added touch of class or overlay more useful power-ups
        over a bed of less usefull power-ups (e.g "OS 4.0 GUI" by Linchpin)
        
    (3. Try to incorporate obstacles and challenges in your map. Think about
        how the map you are working on will be  played, will it just involve
        banging away at the blocks until a useful power-up is found or provide
        some entertaining puzzles, or ingenious traps.
        
    (4. MAKE SURE that people can survive past the first few seconds, as nobody
        likes instant death. This can be easily overlooked as the length of the
        initial bomb flame could be miscalculated or fuse length could be too 
        short. If your start position requires a little time to figure out
        increase the fuse length to make people feel they at least had a chance
        (e.g "imprisoned" & "survive" by iti).

    (5. Test your map before you upload it. This is always a good idea to iron
        out any quirks that are present (i.e adding teleports to enclosed solid
        block areas to enable people to get out, or finding that if you start
        the map with a laser you end up all dying).

The format that dynAMIte uses for styles has changed in version 2.1. Each style
now has its own directory in the dynAMIte/Styles directory. In this directory
there are multiple files which contain different parts of the style. To make
this a little easier to understand i will explain how the default style
"dynAMIte" is stored. 

In the dynAMIte/Styles directory you will find a directory named dynAMIte. This
directory contains the files for the standard dynAMIte style. The list below
describes what part of the style each file should contain and the name the
file must have.

    @{B}blocks.gfx@{UB}
        Contains the graphics for the different kinds of blocks
        (normal block, two-hit block, floor, etc...)

        Contains the graphics for bombs, kickbombs and remote
        bombs.

        in the chat window.
        
    @{B}countdown.gfx@{UB}
        Contains the graphics used for the countdown at the
        start of a game and the "Hurry Up" graphics.

        These files contain the graphics for each of the players.

The .msk and .otl files that accompany some of the .gfx files are used for

This section of the guide was written by Batman and contains notes on tweaking
dynAMIte, DServer and Amigas in general, as well as some hints for AGA users. 

You all know, lags spoil the game, especially in dynAMIte.

@{B}@{U}Q.: "Who is responsible?"@{UU}@{UB}

    Well, many things.  For example:  The net, the number of hops (doing a
    "traceroute" from your client to the server reveals it), the way dynAMIte
    works, the server's cpu, the server machine being used for other things
    simultaneously, the performance and stability of the client, etc... As of
    dynAMIte 1.7, a new feature, called "pingwatch" was introduced to the
    server side.  Depending on the heart of the sysop, and his courage to set
    pingwatch to a working value, "2", for example, this will kick out players
    that lag too much. Yeah, finally it is possible, and hopefully it will
    prevent some games from being quit-killed, and make games a bit more
    enjoyable.

@{B}@{U}Q.: "So I better take care, what can I do about lag?"@{UU}@{UB}

    Well, unfortunately that's complicated, and largely depends on you.
    Settings and performance of your system can still be improved sometimes,
    the net can't. Although one may change to a faster ISP.

    So these are my suggestions:

    @{B}@{U}Servers@{UU}@{UB}
    
    Short correspondence yesterday, with the sysop of "Humppa", revealed that
    his 040-25-server overloads CPU at 7 players, maybe already with 6.

    So as a sysop take care your server can handle the maximum allowed player
    count, not just by upstream, but also by CPU power.

    Use a CPU load display tool. 100% peaks will cause lag. Also pingwatch
    can indicate overload. For example, if people get thrown out by pingwatch
    with many players, it may be your server is overloaded. In such a case it
    is better to not alter the pingwatch value, but the maximum allowed player
    and observer count -first-.

    Of course, if you have to use your server for other things, while games
    are served, it would be kind to set the servers priority to "1" or "2".
    Also one can install "Executive", and set the server to "static priority
	1". Above suggestions won't prevent all lag, but better than nothing.

    A short note on server hardware: A "real" server needs more than 64kbit
    upstream (i.e. ISDNx2, DSL, Cable or a university network). A good network
    access behind your personal access. And a CPU of 040/33 or 040/40, as it
    seems to have turned out.

    @{B}@{U}Clients & General@{UU}@{UB}
    
    If all other players lag for you, you lag for them.  And you are quite
    likely the one spoiling a game. Such happens mostly with poor or too
    long distance lines in the net. It's unpleasant, but often it's better
    to leave a server/game instead of spoiling it. Organize someone to set
    up a server in your own country, if the lines to other countries are
    always too long/bad.  For people not caring about that, or being unaware,
    pingwatch is meant to be the tool of choice (Payback ;/).

    There are many players with 040-25/PPC.  They -have- to take care of
    reducing lag, the CPU is too weak.  "PPC version?" Not possible.

    Some possible measures for all users and sysops, if not applied already:

    o Moving exec base to Fastmem ("Fastexec", "Blizkick", etc.) (rating:
      quite important)

    o Moving SSP to fastmem (rating: most important)

    o Using a good CopyMemQuick() patch. Copymemquicker 2.8 from Aminet for
      020/030, and NewCopymemquicker060 by Harry @{B}Piru@{UB} Sintonen for 040-60.

      !Some 040 users have to read the manual for NewCMQ060 carefully, since
      there may be an obstacle.!

      MCP CMQ is a tad slower imho, so ditch it. (rating: important)

    o Moving the vector base register "vbr" to fastmem
      (easily done, slight gain=important)

    o Moving the ROM to fastmem (what, you haven't yet?, important)

    o Priorities with Executive:
      Miami* static/nonschedule,
      dynamite* static/nonschedule

    @{B}@{U}AHI/Sound in dynAMIte@{UU}@{UB}
    
    - Choosing the right AHI mode is up to you.

    - Channel tooltype (channels=n):
      Despite Gelb's assumption, it seems reducing the channel count from
      the default twelve channels is quite ok, rather a gain in volume
      and dynamics. Try eight channels. I did not notice any sample loss
      with that.

    - Mixing rates above 27kHz seem to be of no use.

    - Disabling sound, if you dare, gives a significant relief/boost.

    - Removing the explosion sample seems to relieve the CPU as well.

    @{B}@{U}Networking@{UU}@{UB}

    o The MTU size:
    ---------------
    Setting the MTU size to 576 bytes instead of 1500 or 1492(PPoE),
    either permanently or just for your dynAMIte session, will have
    some effects, as there are:

    - Faster transfer of the packets by each hop. But also more packets
      to be sent.

    - Avoidance of split packets, in case the route contains
      one or more routers that work with 576 bytes MTU size

    - Maybe less packet loss with error-prone modem connections.
      That's why default settings for modems always use "cowardly" 576
      bytes

    - reduced transfer speed of large files, due to the increased
      packet count

      Well, with minor data rates, as in dynAMIte, and maybe strange
      routes, responsiveness may improve.
      It's up to you if you try this, the outcome depends on the type
      of application.

    o VJC  (van Jacobsen "compression"):
    ------------------------------------
    Should be switched on usually. It's not a compression, but a "storing
    and then stripping" of unnecessary header data.
    T1 (and maybe DSL/Cable, too): I saw recommendations to switch it off.

    o Data compression via TCP/IP-stack:
    ------------------------------------
    Switch it off. It's just another strain on the old 68k CPU,
    therefore useless on a loaded CPU ["loaded CPU"=040-25], and useless
    with V.42bis modem connections.

    o Strange connections:
    ----------------------
    Usually, in each pair of players, they lag to each other rather
    equally ("laaag" screamers: read that twice).
    But, some dynamite players (especially someone nicked "L...")
    seem to see all that the opponents do in time, while they themselves
    lag considerably. Whatever is the reason, in case of this phenomenon
    the lagger should consider fixing this.

    o Serial interfaces:
    --------------------
    - Built in hardware:

    Use either Miami's built-in device, Or New8n1.dcevice, with EOF mode
    turned -off-.  Make sure the bitrate works flawless, (i.e. is not set
    too high).
    Btw, the possible bitrate does -not- depend on the CPU's speed with
    020+&fastmem. That's a misinterpretation. Many A1200s are flawed
    (all AT ones?), and will work with 57.600 only, higher settings will
    slow down everything due to transfer errors.

    - Custom hardware (Hypercom etc.):

    Good. Less interrupts.


    @{B}@{U}AGA Users@{UU}@{UB}

    Well, AGA is slow. But extensive system patching can help -a lot-,
    without noticable additional instability.

    o AGA screens:
    --------------
    - All should know, high scan rates and "high" depths slow down. So be fair,
      if it's slow, and it usually is, don't use 7bit depths, but 6bit.

    - Also avoid 30khz screens, and unnecessary high resolutions, if available
      at all. Btw, dynAMIte can be set to run on an own screen instead of WB
      via MUI's Public Screen Inspector tool (PSI). Have a look at "pathetic
      drivers" on aminet. If you manage to get Fblit & Fscreen running good,
      you may "upgrade" your dynAMIte screen to 512x384, 7bit and 91Hz by
      using a mode of that package.

    o AGA & pure 68k:
    -----------------
    - "FBlit" is a tool of choice.

    - Additional install "Ftext",

    - and!! "BlazeWCP", a must!

    - Finally, "Fscreen" 0.21+ quite likely will increase performance.
      Though it's beta, it already works and seemingly gives quite a boost
      with 30khz scan rates and higher screen depths here (maybe MMU
      required). If you don't know a source for Fscreen, go to #AmigaZeux.

    o AGA with PPC (what??):
    ------------------------
    It may be that the abandoned outdated CyberGraphics with AGA support
    will run faster than Fblit on the 68k side. You will have to test it.

@{B}@{U}Formerly Answered Keen Kwestions@{UU}@{UB}

Q:  Graphics won't be updated during gameplay
A:  If you're using AGA or ECS and the graphics won't be updated during the
    game you probably have a cybergraphics.library installed in libs:. In this
    case (if you're using an AGA or ESC screenmode and have the lib installed)
    you should run dynAMIte with NOCGX option to force the game to use
    WriteChunkyPixels() (OS3.1) or WritePixelLine8() (OS3.0) instead of the
    CyberGraphX WritePixelArray() function.

Q:  Slow Graphics even on an 060 using AGA/ECS
A:  If you're using AGA or ECS you really need to install a WriteChunkyPixels()
    (OS3.1) or WritePixelLine8() (OS3.0) patch like BlazeWCP (Aminet) which
    speeds up the graphics output by a factor of 10 to 20.

Q:  System crashes when I click the Battle button
A:  If you're using CGX, make sure you have switched off the FORCECHUNKY
    tooltype in the CyberGraphX-Commodity. If it is turned on, it may cause
    a crash!

Q:  Global Server List can't be received/Server can't be added to GSL
A:  If you constantly get errors when trying to receive the Global Server List
    from dynAMIte or when enabling the List Server checkmark in DServer, this
    could be because your ISP requires you to use a proxy server for HTTP
    connections. In order to get dynAMIte and the DServer working with proxy
    hosts to update and/or receive the GSL you need to set the PROXY and
    PROXYPORT tooltype or shell-argument. Please have a look at the
    @{"Starting dynAMIte" LINK "GStarting"} and @{"Starting DServer" LINK "SStarting"} sections.

Q:  No audio despite AHI being set up correctly
A:  dynAMIte uses the library mode of AHI which prevents other programs from
    using AHI for audio output. If you already have a program running using
    AHI, quit it and you will be able to hear sound in dynAMIte. If you are
    using a DMA audiomode, please make sure to use the latest version of AHI.
    AHI V5.16 has broken DMA audio.

Q:  A4000D is recognised as an A4000T if X-Surf ethernet card is installed
A:  Although this is not entirely related to dynAMIte, here is a hint how to
    get your "faked" A4kT recognized as A4kD again. Simply remove XSurfIDE
    from your sys:expansion/ drawer and you will have back your A4kD. Probably
    it is because XSurfIDE adds a 2ndscsi.device to your system and so confuses
    identify.library.

o It's now possible to specify the slot where to load and kick bots.
  /loadbot <slotnumber> and /kickbot <slotnumber>, if slotnumber is omitted
  the server will decide which slot to use.

o Wormholes didn't get redrawn if "Skip Bonusanim" was enabled. Fixed.

o Added /online command to client.  This command shows the online times of
  all users currently online.

o DServer did not count a win if there were more than one human players
  when the game started but only one left (due to logoff of the others), when
  the game ended. Fixed.

o If Dserver finds a backup of player and teams data at startup that is
  bigger than the original file, it will ask now to load the backup.

o If all 8 slots in DServer were occupied by players and one tried to
  team/unteam some weird numbers were shown for needed players to change the
  teammode.  Fixed.

o Added a short delay until it is possible to drop a heart when the player
  is dead.

o dynAMIte will now switch off all bells and whistles if average fps drop
  below 10 frames.  Bells and whistles gets reenabled when the fps gets
  back to normal.

o Fixed a masking bug in dynAMIteGFX.library that left some pixels behind
  the flame length/bomb indicator that appears at the start of each map on
  certain circumstances.

o Added a switch to GETSCORE ARexx command of DServer to make it possible
  to also get team-scores. New template is now GETSCORE NUM/N,TEAM/S

o The moving dots didn't get redrawn properly when the gui was rebuild.
  Fixed.

o Finally was able to reproduce problems with keyboard controls that
  received a fix immediately.

@{B}@{U}26.10.2002 V2.2@{UU}@{UB}

o Fixed a silly bug where a player could have had more than one remotebomb
  resulting in hit-galore and serious other problems.

o Active powerups are now displayed in an additional window.  See Menu ->
  Windows -> Active Power-Ups.

o dynAMIte did not load a newly selected sampleset. Fixed.

o DServer now resets teammode and brings in initial amount of bots after
  the last player left the server.

o DServer now also does highscores for teams.

o Added another ARexx command to stop a running game called STOPGAME.

o Added a new ARexx command called DOCHATLINE to DServer.  DOCHATLINE
  handles the passed string as if it was typed into the chat string gadget.

o DServer now uses MUI's built in ARexx interface instead of an own
  implementation.  Because of this I had to change the MUI-Application
  base-name to match the old Arexxport name.  You have to snapshot some
  windows of DServer again.

o Added an option to skip drawing of explosionanimation for blown up
  powerups. See "graphics"-menu.

o Added an option to skip redrawing of powerups every 3 frames.  See
  "graphics"-menu

o Readded SKIPANIMS (skips drawing of bomb explosions) which is now
  available from "graphics"-menu.

o dynAMIte crashed on custompuppets if xpkNUKE.library was missing. Fixed.

o Did some cosmetical changes to DServer prefs.

o Added a button to DServer to login bots.

o Dead players can't switch slots anymore to get resurrected.

o From now on, dynAMIte uses its own network code (dynAMIteNET.library) in
  favour of amarquee.library.

o It's now possible to deactivate any powerup from within DServer.

o If a player used a custompuppet in teammode, the puppetgfx was used for
  the whole team the player was in (only in loginscreen).  Fixed.

o Removed timestatistics from the bottom of the gamewindow because of it's
  general usefulness.

o It's now possible to disable smokeeffect used for laser and kickbombs.

o I've finally rewritten keyboard handling code and removed dependency on
  lowlevel.library/GetKey(), so that it's now possible to control the game
  from a keyboard connected to a Pegasos.  This may also fix some problems
  with some keyboard adapters for wintel keyboards.

o Games with one human and n bots caused the gamecounter to be always
  decreased by one for every game.  Fixed.

o Applied the same changes for timerstuff also to dynAMIte.

o DServer will now save the highscores in a fixed timeinterval instead of
  after every game.

o Bots in DServer are now handled by an external client (detonator),
  taking load off of DServer.

o When a player logged off during a game, the bombs of this player left
  some gfx on the playfield.  Fixed.

o Fixed a silly bug in DServer that caused enforcerhits when a user tried
  to log into a full/offline server.

o Rewritten timer stuff for DServer to get back some sigs for other things.

o Shield and other things never ran out for bots. Fixed.

o Observers got games/wins accounted for highscore. Fixed.

o dynAMIte crashed when one of the needed libraries wasn't found. Fixed.

o Included completely reworked and massively extended AmigaGuide
  documentation done by David "Davar" Arbuthnot.

o Thanks to Ilkka "iti" Lehtoranta dynAMIteGFX.library and
  dynAMIteAI.library are now also available as native PPC libraries for
  MorphOS.

o Players can get resurrected only twice now.  Taking a heart does not add
  a life to your lifecount anylonger.

o Games with only one human player participating do not account for
  highscore any longer.

o Changed back the way how TeleportAll works.  If picked up, it will
  teleport every player to a random place.

o Graphics routines have been optimized even further.

o Dead players are now able to walk around and drop exactly one heart per
  death.

o Playerstats on top of playfield can now be switched to a more compact
  form by using the new command /compact from within the chatwindow.

o Colours in bubbles can now be changed in an easier way.  Use @t[1-8] to
  change text colour and @b[1-8] to change background colour.

o Trace-task of DServer never closed bsdsocket.library. Fixed.

o Afterburner never ran out once picked up. Fixed.

o Added UPTIME Arexx command to DServer.  Returns uptime, or seconds if
  additional argument SECS is provided.

o It is now possible to add lasers to a map.  8 new blocktypes have been
  added for this new feature.  Four for normal lasers and 4 for lasers
  hidden in destroyable blocks.

o Fuselength for players wasn't set in dynAMIteMapLab after loading a map.
  Fixed.

o Afterburner powerup will now add to the afterburner time.  This means,
  the more you pick up, the longer the explosion will last.

o dynAMIte now uses XPK (Nuke) to compress custom player graphics.
  dynAMIte will start without having XPK installed but loses the ability to
  use custom player graphics then.

o It's now possible to have your own custom gfx for your player.  To have
  custom graphics, you have to create another set (.gfx/.msk/.otl) of
  player graphics and place it into PROGDIR:styles/.  By default, dynAMIte
  checks for custompuppet.gfx.  By using PUPPET=filename (without .gfx
  suffix) as tooltype or shellargument, you are able to specify a custom
  gfx set with a different name.  Everything is done to keep bandwidth
  requirements as low as possible.  To achive this, DServer and dynAMIte
  are caching all custom gfx locally and only request graphics, when files
  have been updated by the other side.

o Moved most of gfx and all soundcode to appropriate external libraries.
  Put them into PROGDIR:.  This way it's easier to replace timecritical
  code by some interested programmers.

o It's now possible to simply hop to the next available slot, either to the
  right or to the left, by pressing shift-cursor-left/right or using the
  shoulder-buttons of the CD³² pad.

o CD32 Play/Pause button can now be used to switch between observer and
  player.

o Abandoned old style format in favour of a more flexible style format.  If
  you are a stylecreator, please have a look at one of the provided styles,
  preferrably dynAMIte-style, because this style is complete.  Styles don't
  need to have all gfx present. If one or more gfx files are missing,
  dynAMIte will fall back to dynAMIte-style for the missing file(s).

  explosion.gfx / set pixel at x=0/y=135 to pen 0 to switch to extended
  blockexplosion animation (8 frames)

  bombs.gfx / set pixel at x=0/y=16 to pen 0 to switch to "bounce"-mode for
  kickbombs

  sprites.gfx / set pixel at x=0/y=24 to pen 0 to switch to extended angel
  animation (5 frames)

o Wormholes never transported a player to the next WH. Fixed.

o The number that used to show the number of dropped bombs from the last
  game in loginscreen now shows the rank of the player instead.

o Colors of sprites in darkness/nightvision were wrong. Fixed.

o Added experimental teammode.  Use /team and /unteam.  Powerups which do
  not affect teammembers of the same team are:  Slower, Longer Fuse,
  Shorter Flame, Swap Controls, Fewer Bombs, No Drop, Stop, Darkness.

o DServer ARexx command 'MAPS' didn't work for the last few versions. Fixed.

o Hurryup didn't work as expected when only one player was present. Fixed.

o Compiled again with CreativE 2.12.3 by Tomasz Wiszkowski.

o String in chat window couldn't be edited anymore since v2.0. Fixed.

o Removed workaround for amarquee.library V53.

o Requires amarquee.library V54 now.

o The player who picks up darkness item will see the playfield through some
  kind of nightvision.

o Darkness isn't so dark anymore (re darkness sucks).

o Sped up pen allocation a bit.

o Fixed a bug when deallocating pens for halfbright dynamite-logo.

o Fixed a possible enforcerhit while teleporting.

o Did some more asm optimizations (sprite funcs).

o Artificial intelligence made by Ilkka "iti" Lehtoranta has received a
  complete overhaul resulting in AI2.0

o Client will now close the connection to the server if it hasn't received
  a ping for 30 seconds.

o Added a check for mapjump pickup to prevent maps being played over and
  over again.

o Fixed a bug when deallocating bubbles after they have been used.

o Bots running on the server are now able to do bubbles too.

o GSL now displays number of bots.

o Added a workaround for amarquee v53 session ip bug.  Now gets the
  hostname of the session, could break clone detection in some rare cases.

o Fixed a serious bug which caused the game to never end when someone died
  exactly when hurryup mode was activated.

o Slightly changed Teleport-All powerup.  Instead of teleporting every
  player to a random position, players will now be teleported to the
  position of the player who picked up this item.

o Fixed a bug where kick/remotebombs caused invisible blocks.

o Bots are now able to kill themselves.

o Keymappings are saved now.

o DServer will now stop a game if no human player is participating in it.

o Initial bombs will no longer turn into blocks if a player picks up a
  bombs2block bonus.  This was changed back to old way because several maps
  are created to use this behaviour and didn't work that well with the new
  behaviour.

o DServer never closed Amarquee sessions since 1.9. Fixed.

o Added new powerup for now missing flashbombs -> darkness.

o Flashbombs have been removed because of lack of actual usefulness.

o If DServer was listed in GSL and it was quit, it was very possible
  httptask simply stalled because of synchronous message communication with
  DServer (DServer didn't check msgport while waiting for httptask to quit)

o You could drop as many flashbombs as you wanted. Fixed. Obsolete
  bugfix, see above.

o It's now possible to set maximum number of CPU players in DServer.

o Increased threshhold of flood detection a bit to make it possible to kick
  8 bots in a row :)

o DServer now displays the local ip in the status window on startup.

o Recompiled again with AmigaE 3.3a because of some unexpected problems.

o It's now possible to reconfigure some of the keys dynAMIte uses.

o Style and sample requesters are now opened on the same screen dynAMIte is
  running on.

o Added search function to highscore/userlist of the server.

o Recompiled with CreativE 2.12.3

o Sysopname is now also considered for nicknamecompletion on tab in client.

o Fixed a silly bug which occurred after pressing "Abort" in the mapscan
  window. Once pressed, no mapscanning or GSL updating was done anymore.

o Current style and current sample set is now displayed in screen title if
  dynAMIte window is active.

o added 3 new samples: flashbomb.snd - used for the actual pup
                       flashexplosion.snd - guess
                       flashdrop.snd - guess

o Added flash bombs. These bombs aren't deadly, but they will make you
  kind of blind for a few seconds, because they spread a very intense light.

o Server chat now also displays the time in the listview.

o It's now possible to switch off the fx fades at the end of a game.

o Being remotely logged off from a server during a game won't increase
  game counter of the player any longer.

o If a player runs into fartgas, he will be poisoned and start to cough.
  A countdown to death begins and the poison kills him unless he manages
  to collect a skull. The only protection against farts is a shield.

o Added a new "baked beans" powerup, which gives you the ability to fart
  around and poison other players with deadly foul gas.

o Remote bombs now move with the same speed like the actual bomb owner.

o Current player position and remote bomb position is now transmitted to all
  clients in intervals of 1 second.

o Lasers will now shorten the fuse of bombs.

o Added code to prevent dynAMIte to be hacked by embedded escape sequences
  in chat messages and other stuff.

o Reworked chat command handling in dynAMIte.

o Added new bonus/blocktype (it's actually a combination of both) which
  happens to be some kind of special teleporter called "The Worm Hole"
  (scary).  Entering a TWH will transport a player to another randomly
  chosen TWH.

o Kickbomb bonus now randomly adds 2-10 kickbombs to a players kickbomb bag.

o Added new tooltype/shellargument (TESTMAPS).  With this option it's now
  possible to let DServer only scan maps in maps/.test directory and ignore
  all other directories.  Hope this is helpful for map creators who don't
  want to let DServer scan all maps, just because they only want to test
  some new maps.

o Added 2 Commands to allow players to either bring in new CPU players, or
  to kick them.  Commands are:  /loadbot /kickbot

o The amount of initial computer players can now be set in DServer settings.

o Finally, dynAMIte offers some kind of CPU players (for all of you who
  like to play by themselves without being online for example). CPU players
  require dynAMIteAI.library programmed by Ilkka "iti" Lehtoranta.

o On MapJump/Restart players will only be accounted for one game now.

o Added /hops command. This command displays the hop count of all players.

o A new blocktype has been added. This new block (pi-block) is an extreme
  durable version of the normal destroyable block and needs to be hit twice
  by an explosion.

o Fixed a bug which had overwritten some bytes of the player data in
  DServer by mistake. Did no harm as far as i can tell.

o DServer now does a traceroute to each player logged in to get the hop
  count. DServer adds another task, which handles all tracing activities.

o Rewritten some of the subtask handling code in DServer, to get it more
  straight.

o DServer now displays the total number of maps in the maps window.

o DServer now displays the port it was started for in the window title.

o Maps are from now on stored by author. This means, every map creator has
  his own directory within the maps directory.  DServer will move all maps
  found in the maps root directory to the corresponding author directory.
  Because of this, DServer can take some minutes at the first start, so
  don't be worried if it takes a bit longer.

o Changing online mode of DServer while downloading maps caused no maps to
  be downloaded at all. Fixed.

o The Ranking in DServer should now be displayed correctly.

o Minimum explosion range has been decreased to 1 (minimum was 2 before).

o dynAMIteMapLab didn't save hurry up time. Fixed.

o Added a new menu entry to make it possible to switch off auto-update of
  the highscore after a game.

o DServer now packs all messages for each client in a special packet, so
  that only one large message is sent to clients instead of many small ones.
  This helps to reduce traffic/network overhead.

o dynAMIte could freeze on maximum sized maps, because one blit list wasn't
  initialised for the last "blockline".

o Once connected local, it wasn't possible to connect to any server from
  GSL any longer. Fixed.

o DServer could wait forever on a certain signal at program end. Fixed.

o Local player switching to observer mode caused the server to hang. Fixed.

o Added /repeat command. This command repeats the last played map.

o Internal message passing completely changed.

o Fixed a bug which was introduced in V1.7a (jump out of message loop)
  which has caused certain messages to be not handled at all. This could
  have lead to all kinds of problems.

o Bubble messages were sent multiple times. Bug was introduced with 1.7a.

o DServer now saves the settings everytime you change them in settingswindow.

o Bubbles were shown corrupt for one frame after the next bubble was going
  to be displayed. Fixed.

o dynAMIte now needs identify.library V13, V12 won't be accepted any longer.
  (->http://www.shredzone.de/download/amiga/IdentifyUsr.lha)

o DServer now jumps out of message reading loop if a certain amount of
  messages are handled, allowing it to check timers and such. This could
  solve some lag/pingtimeout problems if there are many players and heavy
  action is going on.

o DServer never deleted tgwnn.players.bak before renaming old players file
  to .bak and thus no new .bak was created. Fixed.

o It is now possible to directly connect local without the use of TCP/IP.
  See "local" checkmark.

o Changes for bot developers:
  - Removed "kickbomb" from player struct.
  - Bomblist isn't per player anymore but it is one list for all players
    now. See dynasema.bomblist

o Fixed several annoying and stupid inconviencies with DServer settings
  which were not saved if the settings window wasn't opened at least once
  until the server got quit. (where have I put my brain?)

o Added a workaround for a possible NList bug (enforcer hits caused by
  strange "messages" passed to display hook) which seem to occur only if a
  line is wordwrapped and gets removed.

o Rewritten most of chat code. Should be slightly faster now.

o Did some small overall optimizations to dynAMIte and DServer.

o Changed PingWatch(tm). Players now won't be kicked after 2 minutes of
  "horrible" ping.  Instead he will be given a warning and if the ping
  stays that bad after another minute, the player will be removed from
  the server.

o Average ping value displayed in lagkick message was always the average
  ping of the first player. Fixed to display the right value.

o Tightened mainloop and spared 1 timer in dynAMIte.

o Replaced "Fade no. 13" (the one which looks weird) by a different fade.

o DServer now uses one timer less (merged pingtimeout- and uptime-timer)

o MapLab: Added Line draw-mode.

o MapLab: Previews are now drawn for box and filledbox draw-modes.

o MapLab: Fixed a bug if mousebutton was released outside of drawarea.

o Colour code used at the start of a bubble is now used by all bubbles in
  the line.

o GSL now also shows PingWatch(tm) value.

o We decided to change how connection speeds are set in DServer to make
  selection of the appropriate speed more reasonable. Connection speeds
  must now be specified both for up- and downstream. This will make it
  easier for players to see what servers might cause lag.

o Completely changed the way dynAMIte handles sprites and brings them to
  the screen including restoring damaged window areas.  Results in less cpu
  usage caused by this routines.

o Do you see the angels?

o The volume for sound effects can now be set (0-200%).

o It is now possible to set the number of channels, dynAMIte should use for
  sound effects. Please see the documentation (Arguments/Tooltypes) for
  further explanation.

o dynAMIte logo now indicates wether the gamewindow is active or not.

o DServer now also displays the average ping response time of players in a
  two minute scale. If a player has an average pingtime of more than x
  seconds (setable by the sysop) above the average ping of all players at
  the end of these 2 minutes, he will be kicked.

o Unsupported servers by the client (version-wise) in GSL are now displayed
  red and can't be selected for connection.

o To make old maps attractive again, DServer now has the option to mirror
  maps randomly in either x or y or in both directions.

o dynAMIte now features a Lag'O'Meter which is displayed on the bottom of
  the window in form of a growing/shrinking bar using different colours.
  The Lag'O'Meter doesn't cause any additional traffic.  This is done by
  using the fact that each serverping comes in every 5 seconds and if the
  serverping is delayed, the client knows the actual lag.
  The colour scheme used to display lag to the player is as follows:
  Lag            Colour
  <=0.5 seconds  Green
  <=1 second     Yellow
  <=2 seconds    Orange
  <5 seconds     Red
  >=5 seconds    Red and blinking

o Players now start to smoke if they get too near to a laser.

o Fixed a light-sabre bug which has lead to reads from random memory
  addresses.

o Fixed another memory bug, which was rather hard to nail down (thanks to
  iti for his help on this one). This bug caused mungwall/muguardianangel
  hits when DServer was quit (dedicated to Batman, who reported these hits
  a long time ago).

o Fixed some rather harmless memory bugs, which could have caused dynAMIte
  and DServer to eat all memory after some days of being run (depending on
  the memory available :)). Memory was freed after dynAMIte and/or DServer
  were quit though.

o If the highscore window is open after a battle, it will update itself to
  the new highscore (requesting new highscore from server).

o If the server is rescanning maps, the game is now halted displaying an
  appropriate text in the gamewindow.

o Logging into a server will now add a special line to the
  chat list/game info list containing the servername.

o Fixed enforcerhits if highscore contained less than 10 entries.

o Map Comment, if available, is now also displayed in mapinfo-text.

o Game info list is cleared too if "clear chatbuffer" is selected from the
  menu.

o "bring to front" option has no effect any longer if you are switched to
  observer mode.

o "bring to front" will now remember which window was active the last time
  (game or chatwindow) and activate it again if this option is enabled.

o A player should now always land in the middle of a swapp ositions bonus
  after the bonus got picked up by someone else.

o Fixed a bug with ratio-bar. Ratio-bar was green if a player had a very
  low ratio.

o Remote bombs moving over an explosion caused the block under the
  remote bomb not to be replaced by mapbackground. Fixed.

o Fixed a bug with word wrapping on bubble texts which could have led to too
  long texts.

o Safety requester for rescanning maps (if players are logged in) won't
  block the server any longer.

o Fixed a really nasty bug when memory for blitnodes was allocated that
  could have caused vital memory being overwritten and also memory leaks
  and software failures when quitting dynAMIte.

o Added another sound which is played when you get logged off by ping
  timeout (pingtimeout.snd)

o Logging into a server while a game is running and typing /map will now
  show the current mapname instead of an empty text.

o Fixed a bug which sometimes caused switched players to be logged off by
  ping timeout.

o Highscore in DServer was sorted before winquota was calculated which
  means the order of the highscore wasn't always correct. Fixed.

o DServer now also shows how many messages were sent/received.

o dynAMIte now loads for each player a specific explosion sample
  (explode1.snd - explode8.snd). For maps with default bomb explode.snd is
  used. If samples from 1-8 are missing explode.snd is used.

o Added GFA-Basic (yuck) developer files. Thanks to Ingo Musquinier for
  creating them.

o DServer: Maps with exact height of 30 lines always showed the
  map parameters as creator of the map. Fixed.

o Starting a new game from within the client will now start with a delay of
  2 seconds, so players have time to logoff or do other thing in this
  neverending 2 seconds ;)

o DServer: Added uptime, data sent and data received to main window.

o Added new command /request which makes it possible for players to
  download maps from The Vault directly onto the server, so they can be
  played immediately.

o Developer: Added dynasema.botinfo where your bot should set a version
  string and some additional information about himself. Could become
  useful in the future.

o Chatbuffer limit for client can now be specified.

o Styles: Reworked all standard styles to support new powerups. Also
  removed the light sabre background which was still there for a few
  versions (which isn't necessary)

o DServer: longest and shortest match/playtime was swapped. Fixed.

o Your own player now flashes in negtive colors if a game starts instead of
  flashing in the player color, which made the flashing non existant if the
  player was already (only) in the same color.

o Developer: Added version to dynamite semaphore, so it's finally possible
  to check if your bot is compatible with dynamite.

o Changed some code in client which handles connecting to GSL and server
  that was called from within a hook. Hope this helps the amarquee
  problems a bit :)

o DServer: IP can now be specified. Either static or dynamic.

o Bots are now also affected by STOP item :)

o Developer: dynasema.addbubble is now a PTR TO CHAR (char*) instead of
  the previous array.  So be careful when adding bubble with old code.

o Developer: each line of sema.grid is now WORD sized (PTR TO INT), each
  line of sema.bonusgrid and sema.explosiongrid is CHAR sized (PTR TO CHAR)

o Dserver now should also save the order and the width of the playerlist.

o Developer: range in tempbomb isn't WORD but LONG (was wrong in C and
  Assembler includes). Fixed.

o Developer: Added another gamestate: GAME_NOTCONNECTED which is set, if
  the game is not connected to any server (start screen)

o Developer: New map array available: dynasema.explosionmap which holds
  "1" for every field of the map that is currently affected by an
  explosion.

o Developer: Updated includes with new powerups (BO_FLAG...)

o DServer now also saves the state of "Hide Powerups" checkbox.

o New Bonus:  Swap Positions.  Exchanges the positions of the players, so
  player 1 will be teleported where player 2 stands and, if no other player
  plays player 2 will be teleported to player ones position.

o New Bonus: Jump Map. Jumps to a map which can be specified in MapLab.
  If no map is specified this Bonus leads to a random map. This bonus
  won't show up during normal game play but only, if the map creator has set
  it somewhere into the map.

o New Bonus: Restart Map. Restarts the current map. Works only for 3
  times for the same map. After this 3 times, all Restarts will be removed
  from the map. This bonus won't show up during normal game play but only,
  if the map creator has set it somewhere into the map.

o New Bonus: Teleport All. Teleports all players except you.

o Fixed a rather nasty bug which caused a certain memory area being
  overwritten with zero after resetting some player statistics before a new
  game started.

o DServer: Scanning for and of maps at server startup is now almost twice
  as fast as before. Also improved scanning of maps in general.

o HurryUp timeout can now be specified in maps, so that it's possible to
  customise the time until HurryUp-mode will be activated.

o All blocks in a style are now rearranged internally to lie on xx bit
  boundaries, for some speedup in copy functions (also fixes some mutools
  cmq()-unaligned hits I think).

o Shield is now also drawn if your player is invisble (on your own screen
  only of course).

o Due to some changes in the last version no messages were sent anymore to
  notify the player if the sysop changed the max player/observer values.

o If you are invisble and you become visible again the player sprite will
  now start to change it's state from transparency to normal and back a few
  times.

o Changed the shield again. The blue glow is replaced by a flashing
  outline of the sprite.

o MapLab: Saving maps without players results in a requester, telling you
  how stupid it would be to save a map without players.

o MapLab: Toolbar is now on the left side of the window.

o MapLab: Added "invert" button to mask window.

o MapLab: Now saves creator, so you don't have to set it everytime.

o MapLab: dynAMIteMapLab no longer has the graphics build into the exe but
  will load it from disk as dynAMIteMapLab.gfx so that it's finally
  possible to use MapLab with your favorite gfx style.

o Added a flag bonus. As soon as one player picks this bonus up, all other
  players will die, so that the player who picked up the flag wins.
  It will not show up during gameplay unless the map creator has set it
  somewhere in the map.

o The server will now send a "clone warning" to all clients if a player logs
  in twice or more times with the same IP.

o Times for the shortest, longest and current game are now displayed below
  the playfield.

o It is now possible to give a reason when logging off (/disconnect, /quit)

o It is now shown in the chat window if a player dies.

o If a new game starts, current mapname and some informations about the map
  are now displayed in the chat window.

o DServer now holds statistics for each map. For this, the server will
  create a new directory ("stats") in progdir:maps/ which will contain all
  map statistics.

o MapLab: Mapname is now reset if "New Map" is selected.

o Fixed a bug which was introduced with a small change on blitting
  operations which caused gfx leftovers on full window refresh.

o Fixed a bug with visitors and drop all pickup where every visitor dropped
  a bomb for player 1.

o Highscore window will now also be un/snapshotted when selecting the
  apropriate menu item.

o Blocks which could be (and are) drawn over by explosions and so causing
  invisible blocks are now restored after each explosion (gravestones will
  look like normal blocks after restoring)

o DServer now shows statistics for every map in map window.

o DServer: Maps which have already been played are now displayed bold (per
  server session)

o It's now possible to enter whole sentences for bubble texts.  Texts which
  are too long are split over more bubbles. Also increased fkey settings
  to 64 cahrs.

o Thanks to a tip by ingo I could get rid of my own colortext class and
  instead simply use \eP[] with normal text.mui :)

o DServer:  Max. line buffer in serverchat window is now limited to 255
  lines to prevent the server to eat up all memory after a few days.

o Developer: Added server data to dynasema

o Developer: Changed the meaning of dynasema.gamerunning a bit.
  dynasema.gamerunning now shows the state of the game (one of GAME_#?
  types)

o Developer: dynasema.player was broken in the way, that only player 0
  was available as pointer. Fixed.

o Ping values are now finally calculated correctly.

o Gloweffects were using slow E version of the code.  Re-enabled ASM
  optimzed code for gloweffects (which is roughly 2 times faster).

o Included fixed dynabot.c and added BotFrame.c. Fixed and created by
  Stephen Illingworth.

o String gadgets for fkey settings are now also using BetterString when
  available to make it easier to enter color codes.

o Added /setpw command to be able to change your password for the server
  without the need to inform the sysop to change it.

o Status icons for swap controls were not reset if an enemy picked up again
  reverse controls.

o Added another flag to style files to enable/disable extended
  blockexplosion animation (plays 8 frames instead of 4 frames pingpong).
  If your style provides the new anim, you have to set the pixel at
  position 3/188 (x/y) to any colour than 0. The new block animation has to
  be present under the lightsabre gfx if you enable this feature.

o dynAMIte now opens ahi.device directly after being started, so that you
  can change the audio mode at any time.

o /info output displayed ppc info for "Style:" and missed style info
  completely. Fixed.

o Bubble texts weren't centered anymore. Fixed.

o Added /pause and /score commands.

o Changed how swapcontrols work. If change controls (up/down or left/right)
  is picked up the controls are just switched.  So if you already had
  changed controls and one picks up another change control your controls
  will be back 2 normal.

o Dropping bombs and picking up Bombs2Blocks powerup fast consecutive (like
  it's possible in Axe_112) caused invisible blocks on the other players
  playfield.

o Players will now be placed exactly onto the field they are staying in the
  map on duel or basically everytime a remote bomb is picked up.

o It's now possible to create coloured bubbles. To add a colour to a
  bubble, start the bubble text with ascii-1 to ascii-8 (CTRL-a to CTRL-h).

o Fixed a bug that caused strange powerups to appear if there were too many
  hurry-up items in a map (like imbe_100).

o Players are now also y-sorted during countdown, so they will overlap other
  players "perspectively" correct.

o Added initial laser, initial kickbombs and initial fuselength for players
  to map description.  Changed MapLab to support the new defaults.

o Fixed a bug which let dynAMIte crash on certain maps (imbe_108) or under
  certain circumstances.

o Server hotlist is now sortable by drag&drop.

o Added an interface for 3rd party programmers. It's now possible to code
  your own (intelligent) bots and maybe even beat other bots (who codes the
  best AI, anyone? :))

o Last column in DServer was missing (last login), because of added
  WinQuota.

o MapLab: Added comment string to map properties to be able to enter a
  comment to maps.

o Gravestones should no longer be drawn over by explosions and so causing
  invisible blocks.

o It's now possible to switch between observer and game mode at any time
  except if you started a battle.

o Starting a text with "*" in the string gadget (chat) will now display the
  text after the "*" in the next bubble.  Pressing "*" while game window is
  active will clear the current text in the string gadget.  Also incrased
  max. text length for bubbles to 8 chars.

o All keyboard inputs (except cursor and shift/alt keys) during a game will
  now also be displayed in the string gadget (chat), while the game window
  is active.

o If you weren't in top 10 and connected to new server and were then in
  top 10 your last ranking (last entry in highscore list) wasn't cleared.

o Gloweffects didn't work anymore. Fixed.

o Fixed gfx leftover from laser after a gravestone was added and the laser
  still was over the gravestone.

o Cursor/Joystick-Up does nothing anymore. To switch to observer-mode
  press Amiga-P or select the corresponding menuitem "switch".

o Visitors (err, observers) were also counted for games so their game count
  increased for every game they watched as observer.

o Renamed Visitor-mode to Observer-mode.

o Bubbles are now queued which means pressing a few fkeys consecutive will
  show them all one after the other in the correct order.

o Cleaned up my keyboard today. Now RETURN and CTRL are working again.

o Players disconnected because of too much lag (ping timeout) will now be
  notified of this instead of just "TCP Connection Closed (-4)" message.

o Changed the way the server ping works.

o Shield display wasn't set back when a new game started. Fixed.

o Added WinQuotient to /stats output.

o Highscore changes:  Previous to this release, the player with the most
  won games was first in the highscore.  Now the rank is computed by both,
  the ratio and the won games.
  (ratio=won_games/games; winquotient=won_games*ratio)

o DServer: Double clicking a player in the server listview will select the
  player in the highscore list and opens the highscore window if necessary.

o Added /stats [nick] command.

o Changed the way highscore data is sent to the clients.

o Sped up overall graphics output.

o Sped up drawing of explosions by 3 to 4 frames.

o Clients will be notified now if the sysop changes the maximum amount of
  players and visitors, so the client adjusts the display of figures
  according to the number of players.

o Your own player will now flash for a short time after teleporting.

o Phoenix bonus (the heart) won't appear during "Hurry Up" any longer.

o Players can now only be resurrected 3 times by default. Picking up
  phoenix bonus (the heart) will increase the number of resurrections left
  of the player who picked it up.

o After rescanning maps in DServer the first listview column was only 1 (or
  so) pixel wide.  Fixed.

o Added "max. window size" option.

o Changed something with skull item (uhh.. hidden feature?)

o Fixed a bug that caused sending the current player pos to all clients
  after dropping a bomb for at least 15 frames (much unnecessary traffic
  caused by this bug)

o Added experimental visitormode.

o Gamewindow will now be reset to its original size after each round.

o Pressing SPACE or the yellow button of the joypad toggles info texts in
  login screen now (window has to be active of course if using SPACE).

o MapLab: Moved "Tools" to mainwindow.

o Added some kind of bubbles to the game. Take a look at the F-Key Settings
  and try F1-F10 and 0-9 and the yellow button on your pad during the game.

o "Help"-key is now used to switch between game and chatwindow instead of
  F10.

o Fixed two mem leaks in chat message functions of DServer.

o Completely changed the countdown. Countdown is now run, like the actual
  game, frame by frame instead of just updating the gfx if a number should
  change. This results in almost the same CPU consumption as in the game,
  but makes some other nice things possible. See next 2 points.

o Your own player is now flashing in its textcolour during the countdown to
  make it easier for you to locate him.

o It's now possible to move your player during the countdown, to make it easier
  locate him.

o Changed lots internal things which should make gameplay run slighlty
  smoother.

o Data is now sent only after a frame, so messages gets first collected and
  are then send to the server instead of sending each message separate.
  Saves some overhead.

o Localized the whole server and game.

o The players countrycode will now be shown in login screen.

o New command: /Info nick - displays the specified players system.

o MapLab: Afterburner bonus wasn't saved for a map.

o DServer caused enforcer hits if one logged in without password and the
  server was listed in GSL. As a side effect the server won't send any
  message to the GSL if a user was kicked because of wrong version/password.

o DServer now is several times faster on startup when scanning maps and
  loading player data (playing tricks with nlist.mcc that is).

o Fixed a bug that caused the window to follow kickbombs instead of
  remotebombs if the window was too small to display the whole playfield.

o Fixed /ping

o Added a flag to the style to switch kickbombs from play once (fly mode)
  to loop play like normal bombs. Set pixel at pos 0/187 (x/y) to enable
  loop play.

o Blocks which become bombs are now also counted for hurryup bonus.

o Chat window now opens behind the actual play window on startup if "autoopen
  on startup" is selected.

o It's no longer possible to select a new sample-set while connected to a
  server.

o If "bring to front" option is active the game window will now also be
  activated.

o Sometimes the first servers of the GSL were cut. Fixed.

o Pressing kick button for slot 1 if no player was logged caused hits. Fixed.

o Laser is now drawn using sprites which means colour 0 is transparent.

o Improved keyboard controls. Now the game should no longer slow down
  while pressing and holding alt+cursor keys. Big thanks to iti for his
  help on this one.

o Fixed another bug which prevented remote bombs from exploding if one
  pressed fire.

o Changed some things in main loop to speed it up. Hope this breaks nothing.

o dynAMIte now only allocates the audio channels, if one is connected to a
  server, so it won't block the channels if the game is iconified/idling.

o Amarquee session and some memory wasn't freed on an error if GSL or
  version check failed (has eaten up all shell sigs after a few tries).

o Specifing proxy as tooltype should have done nothing for DServer until
  now :)

o GSL now works from a central URL which always redirects to a working
  GSL-Server (at least this is the theory)

o On a request I removed "got ping-request from" message, so it won't be
  displayed in the chat window any longer if someone pings you.

o Removed some unnecessary calls to refresh the window. Should give a
  slight speedup.

o Throwing kickbombs while walking will increase their range by 6 fields.

o It's now possible to load different sample-sets from the menu.

o Loading of styles outside of PROGDIR:Styles/ is now possible.

o Added FPS display (16 fps is normal frame rate the game is running at).

o Fixed a bug in dynAMIteMapLab which made the Toolbox and some buttons
  rather useless if it was started from Workbench.

o Fixed a bug in OS3.0 safewritechunky() routine.  Graphics were drawn one
  pixel too low.

o Added /msg command.

o Added /ping command. /ping will ping all players + server, so no
  arguments needed.

o "Edit Map" in DServer didn't work because of wrong filename for MapLab.

o Gravestones are now precalculated, so they won't be drawn as sprite over
  the actual playfield any longer but are drawn as normal block.

o Added win ratio display to login screen in form of a green bar.

o "won" now is displayed white in login screen after a battle.

o Pen wasn't freed in timebar class. Fixed.

o HTTP request in client for receiving GSL was sent twice.

o Changed Back2Basics. Now reverse controls is just active for a very
  short time. Slowdown for about 10 seconds. Bombs are decreased by 3 and
  flame is decreased by 5.

o Picking up several shields will now add to the total time this item is
  active.

o "Slower" item now adds to the time this item is active for the other
  players. It will make them not as slow as before, so one is able to walk
  against magnets.

o Bombs will now tick faster or slower depending on the fuselength.

o Picking up Back2Basics bonus will now also remove invisibility and shield.

o Added Afterburner bonus. This bonus will make all explosions last longer
  from the player who picked it up for some seconds. The more you pickup,
  the longer you will have this special feature.

o Changed highscore a bit. 1:x ratio isn't shown any longer.

o Removed the need for .col files for styles. The text colour for each
  player must now be specified in the .gfx file itself. Take a look at
  dynAMIte.gfx.

o Reintroduced welose.snd. This sample is played if the own player dies.

o Changed server to use a doulby linked list instead of a fixed array for
  handling of players. Maybe it gives some speedup.

o DServer will now load its own config file for each instance.

o Remote bombs are reacting now the same way as normal bombs (e.g. they
  will explode if a bomb explodes beside them).

o The upper string fields and the speed cycle gadget in dserver settings
  window are now in the cyclechain.

o Remote bomb bug should be fixed (sometimes they wouldn't want to explode
  if one pressed fire).

o Added small sort-button to the server hotlist.

o Dead players won't get a remote bomb any longer if someone picks up a
  duel bonus. This change has led to some dicussions, so tell me your
  oppinion about this change please.

o Light-sabre gfx leftovers should be a thing of the past now.

o Added "bring screen/window to front on new game" option.

o Fixed a bug that caused enforcerhits if some libs weren't found at startup.
