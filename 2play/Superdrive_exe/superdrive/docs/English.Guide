  Well, you need an Amiga of course, or a big PC with UAE. You should need at 
least one meg CHIP RAM free.
SuperDrive should work under OS 1.3 up to 3.5(not tested). AGA chipset isn't 
required.
A 68030 processor is good, a 68060 gives you maximum fun :-)

                -------------  TOOL TYPE   --------------
                -----------------------------------------



1) START SUPERDRIVE FROM WORKBENCH
  Get info about 'SuperDrive' icon, you'll find 4 tooltypes :
         -SCREENX=X hard position of screens on your TV (must be a multiple of  8)
         -SCREENY=Y hard position of screens on your TV
         -LOWCPU=(YES|NO) double the speed of the game for CPU 68000 and 68020.
            Be carefull, this mode isn't very stable, CPU car may loose their
            way or crash in borders.
         -CLOSEWB=try to close the workbench at startup to freea maximum of chip 
             ram. That may help !

2) START SUPERDRIVE    FROM SHELL
  Idem, you have to type 'superdrive' on your prompt, the tool types must be set
  in the icon as described above.

Default value are SCREENX=128, SCREENY=45, LOWCPU=NO and CLOSEWB=NO.

                ---------------  THE GAME  --------------
                -----------------------------------------


Game's preparation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once the main menu is in place, the following choices appear:

- CREDITS : greetings to the ones that helped me

- OPTIONS : configuration of the game,

- START GAME : I let you guess  :) 

In the OPTIONS menu, other choices are possible :

- PLAYERS : select the number of human players and CPU

The fourth player can be suppressed. This will improve the speed for slow 
processors. In order to leave the menu you have to click on the wheel on the 
bottom left hand side. At this moment, the names of the players is asked for. 
If an empty name is entered, the name Player X is used, X being the player's 
number. 

- CONTROL : configure commands
Every human player can select his control mode, joystick or keyboard. Different 
combinations are predefined, JOY 1 is the classical joystick port, JOY 2 is the 
mouse's port, JOY 3 and 4 correspond to 'doubles' on the parallel port. To 
leave this menu click on the wheel on the bottom left side, a test of the 
commands is proposed, accept it so that you can confirm your commands selection 
and try the car for the first time, this is very useful for beginners!  
- RACE : this menu allows you to select the game's mode
3 modes are available :

- Championship : this race is based on performance, you have to be first and 
have the best lap time to collect maximum points.
- Savage : It's a war without mercy, every car destroyed gives you one point, 
the winner of a race collects another point.
- Scenario : You can select different scenarii (country, desert, city, hell) in 
order to discover them, the points are distributed based on the order of 
arrival only.
For each mode, you can select the number of races, number of laps, CPU cars' 
levels and for the scenario mode, the different circuits available. Leave this 
menu simply by clicking on the wheel at the bottom left hand side, a text will 
appear to summarize the operating mode. 

Once the game is configured start with START GAME !

Note : The ESC key takes you back to the opearting system, BE CAREFUL !

Control of the cars:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The controls are :
Fire Button : acceleration
Left/right : turns left or right 
Bottom : select a weapon, the white arrow on the status pannel is positionned 
on the following weapon if you have more than one weapon  
High : activates the selected weapon

Weapons:
~~~~~~~
- Machine gun : this weapon shoots when a car is in front, not too further or 
too close. If no one is in the front line it's not possible to shoot, this 
means that no bullets are lost :-)
- Bomb : you activate it the same way as the machine gun, but it's a lot more 
powerful, the target is automatically destroyed whatever its resistance is.
- Mine : you can drop it at any moment behind your car it will totally destroy 
any car that touches it. If the mine is not touched by a car, it will disappear 
after a certain time.

Bonus to be collected:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
During a race, different bonus can appear on the road :
- Machine guns (x3), Bombs, Mines : you will recognised them by their picture 
in a green square
- Hammer : Instantly repairs the resistance of your car
- Turbo (small wheel) : no need to explain.
- Dollar : adds one dollar to your account
- Note : adds 2 dollars to your account
- Mine (without the green square) : don' touch it or your car will be instantly 
detroyed 

Shopping:
~~~~~~~~
After a race, if you have money, you will be able to buy weapons or enhance 
your car on four different points : ACCELERATION, TRACTION, HIGHSPEED, SHIELD.
 - ACCELERATION : 1-7 levels, represents how nervous your car will be.
 - TRACTION : 1-7 levels, allows you to turn better in bends.
 - HIGHSPEED : 1-7 levels, improves the maximum speed.
 - SHIELD : 1-9 levels, improves car's resistance.


Save/load a game:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is possible to save the status of one game only :
while you are in the classification screen, press F1, you will hear a 
confirmation tone, the game is saved. Once the game is saved it will override 
the previous saved game. 

To load a game, start a game and during the first race, press F1, you will be 
able to load a game. 

Other keys:
~~~~~~~~~~
During a race, 'P' puts the game in pause, 'ESC' quits.


 Well now, you know every thing, so enjoy SuperDrive !

                -----------------------------------------


 My name is Sylvain Zangiacomi and I code Amos games for long time ago now.
As I was an fan of SuperSprint on my poor Amstrad CPC, one day I decide to
make such a game with my Amiga, SuperDrive was born !

 For this great adventure, a lot of guy helped me to make SuperDrive better
than ever :

 -Magnus, Sebastien and Chafik for graphics,
 -Stamen for music,
 -Steve for the digits,
 -Eric and Stephane with their scanner,
 -Ahmed for the different translations in English,
 -Markus B. for the doc in German.

Thanks to all.
