<B><H2>These are only basic information about BoingPairs requirements. Please read them carefully! For more detailed info about the game please read the manual BoingPairs.html.</H2></B>
<Br>

<B>1) <U>Font</U></B><BR> 
<BR> 
<B>MorphOS version - </B> BoingPairs ABSOLUTELY needs Dejavu Sans font installed in <B>Fonts:</B> or <B>MOSSYS:Fonts</B> !! The game won't start without it! That's why I announced BoingPairs for MorphOS 2.x - because Dejavu Sans is included in MOSSYS:Fonts in these installations. I've tested BoingPairs succesfully under MorphOS 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5. and I secretly hope that no one has been using lower versions of MorphOS 2 anymore..:-)<BR>
But if you have Dejavu Sans in <B>Fonts:</B> or <B>MOSSYS:Fonts</B> under MorphOS 1.4.5 as well, the game will work without any problem too !!! On my 1.4.5 installation it works perfectly.<BR>
<BR>


<B>AmigaOS4 version - </B> You don't need to have Dejavu Sans font installed because I integrated it directly into the BoingPairs executable ( for sure:-)))<BR> 
<BR>
<BR>

<B>2) <U>Resolution</U></B><BR>
<BR>  

BoingPairs will run on its own screen in 1280x1024 so before launching the game please make sure that your graphics card and monitor are capable of this resolution...<BR>
