@NODE Fast "Fast words"

This game was made to be a part of the A600 pack software released by PCI,
a Brazilian enterprise licenced by ex-Commodore-Amiga in '93. It was a
commercial product but now its authors give me permission to release it as
a freeware game.
The first codes was made in C and later in Amos. The screen mode is NTSC
LowRes with 32 colors but it runs on Pal too.
The English language wasn't included. Choosing the USA/British or
Brazil/Portugal flags the language will be always Portuguese. The final
version was planned to be released in English/Portuguese with all the
Capoeira blows, 30 fight stages and 5 different bonus stages!

@NODE speed "About the speed"

                       Note about the speed on A1200:

This game was written to run on A600 1M machine so the speed increases
on A1200. If you wish to decrease it do this:

1) Disable CPU caches & original chip ON
2) Get degrader 1.3 program (on Aminet util/misc  Degrader.lha 17k),
   install it on C: dir and add to barravento script file:

       degrader timewaste 180
       Assign BARRAVENTO: ""
       INTRO                           

If you have an expanded A1200 change the first line to:

A1200 + FASTRAM:
degrader nofastmem timewaste 180

A1200 030/33:
degrader nofastmem nocache timewaste 150

A1200 040/060:
the same as 030 but with timewaste <130 (try some values around it)
Note: This program WASN'T TESTED on these accelerator boards!

If you don't have any HD (I don't believe?!) run degrader first, enable
these options, click on "SurviveResets" and boot this game.

@NODE Blows "Blows"

                            The Barravento Blows

Each blow is composite of 6 frames. These frames were digitalized images
from a camera and the animation was made by rotoscope. 
You can see the @{" blows here " system "run >NIL: amigaguide Blows.iff"} and its joystick commands.

Notes:

- The head is the best local to blow.
- There isn't energy waste on human-computer fights during the trip.
- Arrows and Space keys can be used to select on the options screens.
