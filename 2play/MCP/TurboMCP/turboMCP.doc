  OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION

  Name       :  turboMCP.asm
  Usage      :  turboMCP
  Version    :  V13.76 (2nd release)
  Date       :  09.-11.09.1990, 8.12.1990-02.04.1991
  Author     :  Jörg Sixt
  File under :  games
  Purpose    :  another implementation of TRON
  Features   :  - max. 4 human players
                - "Playing field - ED"
  Software   :  A68k V2.41 (Fish 314)
  Hardware   :  - programmed on an AMIGA 500, 1MB, Kick V1.2
                - certainly it runs on every AMIGA with at least 512 KB and
                  Kick 1.2/1.3
                - Incompatibilty with future models is possible
                  as the programme needs direct hardware access
                  to the joystick registers & VHPOS
  Bugs       :  - doesn't use devices
                - can't check joystick 1 fire button when
                  mouse is plugged in port 2

  II. THE STORY BEHIND...
  =======================

   "We all know the cruelty in the world, the evil that is dogging our foot
  steps, the terrible things that happen to every one of us. You find them
  everywhere. Everywhere. Even on an AMIGA."        Jörg Sixt
                                                programmer,s.a.s.

  I know, I know! You were just about starting the damned proggy hoping of
  an interesting application, a thrilling game or just something that's
  worth spending a few hours on. But at the same time those omnipresent
  fears flatter around your mind and destroy all your anticipations. Fears
  of the extraordinary terror of laziness and stupidity that origin from
  the minds of all those god-damned programmers:

  "What is it alike? The 563th version of Tetris? Perhaps with 6-player-
  simultan-mode and a 'shoot-em-up'-level. Or maybe it's again one of these
  Hack-like dungeon adventures! Surely f---ing difficult then, brutal (the
  poor monsters! Have such programmers no respect for godmade creatures? And
  what'll say Greenpeace?) and requiring 5 MB of chip-ram! Or even more
  terrible: one of these highly intelligent jump, pop and run games...."

  Thank God, I can soothe you. turboMCP is neither a Tetris-clone, nor a
  "slay all the monsters in this dungeon"-game, nor a PD-Bubble-Bobble.
  turboMCP is just the 1027th implementation of TRON.
  No! No! Stand by! Don't give up now! I know, there are billions of "cycle"
  versions in this part of the universe but nevertheless this version has
  some really unique features:
                  - it has no computer rivals
                  - up to 4 human players can play simultaneously
                  - you can determine how your playing field will look like
                  - savety pods implemented
                  - fully written in assembly language
                  - that means it's fast and small
                  - it's not commercial, it's not shareware, it's for FREE

  NOTE: Actually the programme's length is about 8-9 Kbytes. I'm afraid the
        title graphic needs about 18-19 Kbytes. If you can't afford spending
        19000 bytes (although my artistic efforts should be worth it!) delete
        the following lines from "MCP.asm"
                -  INCLUDE "MCP.im" (at the very end of the file)
                -  jsr DRAWIMAGE(a6) (in the "OpenScr"-subroutine)
        and re-assemble the code.

  III. HANDLING THE BASTARD
  =========================

                          1. The MAIN MENU SCREEN
                          -----------------------

  After you've started   turboMCP   your first glimpses will fall onto an
  almost incredible startup screen which was meant to be the MAIN MENU
  SCREEN. Roughly speaking the MAIN MENU SCREEN consists of 16 gadgets. If
  here I use the word 'gadget' I have to add that those gadgets aren't the
  normal intuition gadgets you surely know from a lot of UTIL programmes.
  However the handling is quite simple. Just press the
  up/down/left/right/fire - buttons respectively keys of the four players
  and the cursor moves to the next gadget. Simple, eh?

   Player 1  uses joystick in port 1  up/down/left/right/fire     red
   Player 2  uses joystick in port 2  up/down/left/right/fire     blue
    (if you use joystick 2, remove the mouse from port 1. Otherwise it
     doesn't work. I don't know why)
   Player 3  uses the main keyboard   E /X   /S   /D    /SPACE    green
   Player 4  uses the number pad      8 /2   /4   /6    /ENTER    orange

  (Note: Colours and key-codes are used when you are playing as well as when
   when you are chosing a gadget in the MAIN MENU or when you have a look at
   your actual scores. Remember both and you'll find your way through this
   jungle without any problems. At least I hope, you will)

  Maybe you wonder why all this has been programmed. (I mean the MAIN MENU
  SCREEN not the WHOLE PROGRAMME. The latter leads to a more philosophic
  problem and Socrates always said that Kant.....) Well, the MAIN MENU
  SCREEN with all its gaddies allows you to adjust the playing field on YOUR
  needs and desires! It's almost something like the preferencers on your
  Workbench disk. Here is a list of the gadgets:

     1. Row  :  Choose input devices e.g. three humans want to play
                against each other they may activate "joystick 2", "Number
                pad" and "Keyboard" or "Joystick 1", "Joystick 2" and
                "Keyboard", etc. Choose the ones you like best!

     Border     (on)  When someone drives against the border of the field
                      he...err... R.I.P.
                (off) When someone tries to drive out of the field he
                      appears again on the other side
     PAL        (off) This is to give all the U.S.-users a bad feeling about
                      their damned NTSC.
                (on)  uses the whole PAL-screen.
     Explosion  (on)  A crash will always be followed by a explosion i.e.
                      a ring of fire which burns everything around down.
                      Any cycle inside the explosion will be killed.
                (off) The cycles have anti-fire motors.

     HighRes    (on)  The playing field will be a HIGHRES screen
                (off) The playing field will be a LOWRES screen
     Interlace  (on)  The playing field will be a INTERLACE screen
                (off) Now, guess my friend!!
     Speed ¹)   0-10  Speed justification:
                      10 = "break your neck"-level
                       0 = the "snail ralley"-level

     Boxes ¹)   0-99  number of boxes
     Stars ¹)   0-99  amount of stars
     Sav. Pods¹)0-9   Numbers of savety pods

     Play        Action: Play the game
     Clear       Action: Set scores to zero
     Quit        Action: Should only be used in extreme emergency cases!

     ¹) increase values via pressing FIRE


                        2. The SCORE SCREEN
                        -------------------

  When activating "Play" the so-called SCORE SCREEN will appear. After every
  round it will show you the latest charts (not Madonna...) with your latest
  scores. But maybe you don't want my laboriously developped score system -
  you just want to know who has won the most games. No problem! turboMCP
  counts the games every player has won and prints them in the "victories"
  column. Despite of this extra service the order of the players in the
  charts depends on the main scores.

  But back to the game. If you want to continue/start the game press FIRE
  (i.e. <space>, <enter> or joystick buttons). If you want to go back to the
  MAIN MENU SCREEN press <esc>. There you can change the preferences again
  without losing the scores. If you wish to begin a new game you simply
  click on the CLEAR-gadget. Now all the scores are deleted.


                        3. The GAME SCREEN
                        ------------------

  After pressing FIRE above, the computer build the combat field with the
  features you've adjusted. Immediatly after the beep (I had no gong,
  sorry!) the game starts:

         +----------------------------------+
         | Joystick 1            Joystick 2 |
         |    red                   blue    |     This are the
         |    \/                     \/     |     starting positions
         |                                  |     of the cycles
         |    /\                     /\     |
         |   green                 orange   |
         | Keyboard              Number Pad |
         +----------------------------------+

  The rules of the game itself are very easy. Just drive along and watch
  out! Every crash with a wall, a box, a star or eventually the border of
  the field is absolutely and irretrievably deadly. (Live's hard, y'know)

  In dangerous situations press the FIRE button and you jump over 1 - 6
  pixels. The game ends when all but one cycle are gone or when the <esc> key
  has been stroken. Then the SCORE SCREEN appears again. The game may go on.

  But there's a third possibility: running into a savety pod. A savety pod
  crash doesn't cost your live but restarts the round. That's particularly
  helpful in ticklish situations. But be careful!!! Only use it in extreme
  emergency cases: Only once a round a savety pod can save your life - a
  second time and you're crashing! (Note: This feature isn't new. I stole it
  from another PD game named "Cycle". But don't tell the author!!)

  If you want to send me something neaty.... I need:
  money, more money, last version of a68k and blink, much more money,
  records, disks, lots and lots of money, that 250 MB harddisk or PCs
  (or an Atari ST - I've always dreamt of taking a hammer and....)

  Bugs, remarks, payements, briberies, improvements, better versions to:
