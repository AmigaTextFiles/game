THE AIM OF THE GAME:

    NOT REALLY MUCH OF A PLOT BECAUSE WE DONT GO FOR ALL THAT STUFF BUT THE
MAIN IDEA IS TO SLAP THE OTHER BALLS OF THE GRID!!

    THE GAME CAN BE PLAYED AS A SINGLE PLAYER OR AS TWO PLAYERS. IN TWO
PLAYER MODE THIS CAN BE TEAM WORK OR CHALLENGE. IN TEAM WORK, PLAYERS WILL
NOT KNOCK EACH OTHER OFF THE GRID BUT WILL GO OVER EACH OTHER. IN CHALLENGE
(YOUVE GUESSED IT) YOU CAN KNOCK EACH OTHER OFF THE GRID.

    THE HOLES ON THE GRID ARE OUTER SPACE AND YOU MUST AVOID THESE AT ALL
COST. KNOCKING THE ALIEN BALLS OFF THE GRID INTO THESE HOLES WILL GIVE YOU A
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CREDITS. THESE CREDITS ARE YOUR SCORE.

    AT THE END OF EACH LEVEL YOU WILL GO INTO THE SHOP SCREEN WHERE YOU CAN
EITHER (OR EITHER) KEEP YOUR CREDS OR PART CHOP THEM FOR POWER UPS. THESES
UPGRADES ARE AS FOLLOWS:

         SPEED ----- SPEEDS YOUR BALLS UP (YES PLEASE!)
         ANTI-ROLL ----- INCREASES KNOCKING POWER AND ROLLING RESISTANCE.

         STUN ----- STOPS ALL ALIEN BALLS IN THEIR TRACKS (LIMITED TIME).
         POWER CHARGE ----- INCREASES KNOCKING POWER AND DECREASES IMPACT
                            CHARGES AGAINST YOU (LIMITED TIME).
         POWER PUNCH ----- X3 POWER INCREASE (LIMITED TIME).

    TO SELECT ANY OF THESE, MOVE THE CURSER AROUND WITH THE JOYSTICK AND
CLICK ON THE BOXES. TO SELECT WHICH WEAPON THE FIRE BUTTON REPRESENTS YOU
HAVE TO CLICK ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE BOXES. THIS MOVES THE BIG FIRE BUTTON
DOWN TO THE SELECTED WEAPON. CLICKING ON THE RIGHT HAND BUTTONS WILL ATTEMPT
TO BUY THAT WEAPON (IF CREDS ARE ENOUGH).

    CLICKING ON RETURN WILL CONTINUE.

    THERE YOU GO. A DEAD SIMPLE GAME TO PLAY.

    BY THE WAY, THE HI-SCORES WILL BE SAVED IF THE DISK IS UNPROTECTED. SO
PROTECT IT IF YOU DONT WANT TO SAVE THEM.

    OH, I HEAR YOU CRY. WHERE IS ZORB I. WELL IT APPEARED ON THE SPECTRUM
MANY MOONS AGO. BUT WITH SPECCY EMULATOR IT IS POSSIBLE TO PLAY IT AGAIN.
WRITE TO ME IF YOU WANT THE GAME IN SPECCY FORMAT.

    GET ON AND PLAY THE GAME THEN!!!!!

    I DONT LIKE LONG DOC FILES THAT GO ON ABOUT COMPLETE RUBBISH SO I SAY TH
