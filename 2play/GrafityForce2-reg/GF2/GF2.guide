GF2 v1.10 - Copyright (c) Bits 1992-1994. All rights reserved.
*Original GF level included with permission from Kingsoft

   GF2 v1.10 is FreeWare, and may be copied freely. The programmers take
no responsibility for eventual errors that the program may create in any way.
We have tested everything for many hours to assure that it functions
correctly, but if you find any bugs, please don't tell your friends, :)
tell us!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------


@{b}What is GF2?@{ub}

      GF2 is Bits' version of the original Gravity-Force from Kingsoft.
   Some improvements to a fantastic game!

      The *original* idea is old, and many games like this exist, f.ex.
   "Thrust", "Mayhem", "TurboRaketti", "The Executioner", "Zarathrusta" aso.
   But we wanted our own, special version which should have what the other
   games hadn't. We concentrated on the 2 Player Dogfight Mode, with some
   special weapons and many other settings. The Race Mode was something we
   added later to make it possible to play on your own.

@endnode

@node REQ "GF2. Requirements"

@{b}What do I need?@{ub}

      An Amiga with at least 1Mb memory. GF2 should work fine on all Amiga
   models (including those with AGA chipset). GF2 will benefit from a faster
   CPU, even if a 68040 isn't used to its maximum. :)

      Preferably, a friend. GF2 is originally made for 2 players, even if
   the Race mode makes it possible to play on your own.

      Even better, a friend and his computer. The 0-modem LinkUp mode is
   the ultimate GF2 experience! :) A simple @{"serial cable" link CABLE} is all you need.

@endnode

@node INSTALL "GF2. Installation"

@{b}I have a 210 Mb HD. What to do?@{ub}

      Lucky you. Click on the 'Install_GF2' icon or execute the Install_GF2
   script and follow the instructions. And check out the 'Environment' menu.

      Don't forget to backup your old LogFile.Dat before re-installing GF2,
   otherwise your Race records and statistics will be lost.

@{b}How to start GF2?@{ub}

   a)   From WorkBench: Click on the 'Start_GF2' icon.
   b)   From CLI:       Type 'cd xxx/GF2' and then 'execute Start_GF2'.

      GF2 uses DOS filesystem and should work fine together with programs
   like EPU or PP_DataPatch. GF2 takes over your computer, but in a system
   friendly way, and returns your system intact.

@endnode

@node PLAY "GF2. How To Play!"

@{b}How to get the most out of GF2@{ub}

      We have discovered that GF2 is funny even without the Cannon. :)
   For example "Knocking" - the Sport where you never shoot your enemy,
   you crash into him! Experiment with the Special Weapons, each level
   has its ultimate settings, f.ex. "The Tower" and Non-guided missile.
   Even some Race levels can be interesting as Dogfight levels. If you play
   a Tournament on a Race level it will "become" a dogfight level. "Grass-
   Twisted" with Non-guided missile is a good example.

      Especially for LinkUp mode, we recommend "Slime-Mushrooms" or
   "GrassLands-Diving". If you want to use the Free Fall Bomb, "Slime-
   Coulter's Face" is a good choice.

      Other levels we have played quite a lot ourselves are:
   "LegoLand-Work Out": quick action, "Arctic-Cold War": cock-of-the-roost,
   "Arctic-Ice Cold": well, try it. "Boring-One Shooter Each" is one of
   the oldest levels, still goin' strong.

      The Guided Missile might seem a bit too deadly, but with maximum
   AutoCannon power, scattered showers and the right technique, the
   dogfight can be really exciting. Fly close to the walls, and you have
   a chance of surviving an incoming missile. Try "Metallic-The Basement"
   with these settings.

      Check out all menus carefully, since there are many things to change
   and many different combinations to try. Wherever possible, use the
   Full Screen-Both Players mode, since we now have understood that the
   Split Screen mode is a bit claustrophobic. :)

      We recommend that you use the Tournament mode as often as possible.
   You'll get some statistics about how good/bad dogfighter you are.

      And, by the way: GF2 contains some hidden menus, keys and modes.
   We don't guarantee that all the hidden functions will WORK, but:
   Hey! Why are they hidden?

@endnode


@node CABLE "GF2. LinkUp Mode"

@{b}The LinkUp Mode@{ub}

      This requires a serial cable to connect the two computers with.
   The one who's first to select LinkUp mode, will become Master. The Slave
   will automatically use the Master's Preferences, and load the same level.
   The Master will be Player 1, and the Slave will naturally be Player 2.

@{b}The Serial Cable@{ub}

      A 3-wire cable is enough, which can be obtained from your local
   computer store, or simply home-made.

      How to make the cable yourself? The trick is: Find the serial port.
   Connect pin 2 (computer 1) to pin 3 (computer 2) and vice versa.
   Then connect the two computers' pin 7 to each other. Observe that we
   DON'T take ANY responsibility if your computer blows up. :) If you are
   uncertain, go buy yourself a real cable instead of jeopardizing anything.

   * Favorite expression while coding:
     "Who the F**K has coded this worthless routine?"
     (Usually used by the same person who coded it...)

@node LOGMERGE "GF2. The LogMerge Program"

@{b}What is the LogMerge Program?@{ub}

      It is a small util (run from CLI) which we coded because we wanted
   to "spread" our Race Records. The LogMerge program extracts the best
   record for each level, and saves it back to the both LogFiles, without
   touching the statistics. More info: 'LogMerge ?'

@endnode

@node IMPROVE "GF2. Improvements"

@{b}v1.00: First official release.@{ub}

@{b}v1.01: Improvements since v1.00@{ub}

      We have, on request, added 'Save Prefs' and 'Default Prefs'.
   They can be found in (surprise!) the 'Preferences' Menu. If your disk is
   Write-Protected, 'Save Prefs' will just freeze. If this happens, remove
   the disk, Write-Enable it, re-insert it and everything should be OK.

      An 'Intro Picture' has been added to have something to look at while
   the computer searches for levels. Thanx to Kenny Stenmark for the Pic.

      We have changed the archive from DMS to LhA because AmiNet don't
   want DMS files. To start the game from CLI you have to have GF2 as the
   current directory and then 'execute Start_GF2'. The 'LogMerge' program
   is now placed in 'GF2/' instead of 'C/'.

>     The following files are new or altered:
>  GF.EXE, GF2_SPEC.DAT, GF2_M.DAT, GetPath, Start_GF2, Install_GF2,
>  GFX/GF2_IJX.DAT, GF2.DOC, LEVELS/ARIcy Cave.GFB

@{b}v1.02: Improvements since v1.01@{ub}

      Two minor bugs fixed, the Start_GF2 script was incorrect and GF2
   turned off the mouse pointer. Version 1.01 doesn't really exist but was
   accidentally released. Sorry! :]

>     The following files are new or altered:
>  GF.EXE, Start_GF2, GF2.DOC

@{b}v1.03: Improvements since v1.02@{ub}

      One minor bug fixed, the sprites freaked out when ESC was pressed
   several times on AGA machines. Thanx everybody who reported this bug!

>     The following files are new or altered:
>  GF.EXE, GF2.DOC

@{b}v1.10 - Registered Version: Improvements since v1.03@{ub}

Added:
   * Null-Modem LinkUp mode.
   * Optional Full Screen Mode.
   * More than 50 new levels.
   * Two new level types, Slime (by Scanner/Nexus) and Desert (Zipper).
   * In-Game Keyboard control.
   * Changing water level supported.
   * Missile and Cannon Recoil.
   * Variable Missile/Bomb Hit Area.
   * AmigaGuide documentation.
   * More advantage of 68020+.
   * Landing upside down.

Removed:
   * 1 tiny, tiny little bug which you haven't noticed anyway.

>     We don't think you'd like to see the list of all the altered files.

@node BUGS "GF2. Bugs and bug reporting"

@{b}Known Bugs@{ub}

      There are no bugs in the "normal" mode, but the 0-modem Linkup mode
   isn't perfect. We thought you preferred a release in July '94, with some
   small bugs, before a Christmas-release... :)

      There are some problems with the serial transmission, but as they
   exist due to inaccurate vertical blanking timing, we don't really know
   how to fix it. GF2 relies on perfect 50 Hz frame updating. This problem
   might depend on our lousy equipment, so it's not the end of the world. :)

      GF2 will detect the bug if it occurs, and will inform you about the
   problem. If you wait about 20 secs or so, and then retry, the problem
   should be gone. Any Tournaments going on will not be affected, as the
   match which was interrupted will be cancelled, and the players' scores
   won't change. Thank you for your understanding.

      We have also had a LOT of problems with Guided Shots. They just
   freaked out because of computers with different speed. After many hours
   of coding, we gave up. This means that Guided Shots isn't available in
   linkup mode.

      Contact us if you find any other bugs, and don't forget to give us
   your exact config and a description of how to create the bug. Thanx!
