This Amos Game has been written by Sylvain Zangiacomi, and is for 2 
players.

It has been successfully tested on 68000, 68020, OS 2.04, OS 1.3. It 
should run correctly on higher configurations.

To play this game, you must be two opponents. You'd better have two 
joysticks because quick actions are often needed. But if you've got 
just one, choose the keyboard option in the menu. The keys are theese :
                                   left = 4
                                   up = 8
                                   right = 6
                                   down = 2
                                   fire = 0
Sorry, you can't change them.
During the game, each player controls a snake, one start on the left, 
the other on the right. You mustn't touch any colour part of the screen,
and of course your body and your opponent. By pressing fire, you will 
activate the turbo speed : its autonomy is of a few seconds so manage it
well. It will be reloaded when you loose a life or change level.
Changing level is done when the number at the bottom is 0. Then you may
have the chance to try a bonus stage.
Your lives are displayed at the bottom of the screen by @ symbol.

That's all information you need, so enjoy your duels :-)
