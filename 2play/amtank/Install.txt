Part 1: Making an autobooting disk for AmTank.
----------------------------------------------

Once you have 'unlharched' these files, put them on a blank disk. Then create
the following directories:

   c
   devs
   l
   libs
   s

You must then copy the following files to the appropriate directories on
the disk.

In the 'c' directory:

  Copy   'endcli'   from your WORKBENCH:c directory 
  Copy   'loadwb'   from your WORKBENCH:c directory

In the 'devs' directory:

  Copy   'system-configuration'   from your WORKBENCH:devs directory

In the 'l' directory:

  Copy   'Disk-Validator'   from your WORKBENCH:l directory

In the 'libs' directory:

  Copy   'icon.library'   from you WORKBENCH:libs directory

You must now create an ASCII file in the s directory called startup-sequence.
Use your favourite ASCII text editor. The file should simply look like this:

   loadwb
   endcli

Then, all that remains to be done is to install the disk. To do this, go to
CLI or SHELL then type Install df0: (Making sure the disk is in df0!).

Once all disk activity has stopped, you should find that you have a bootable
disk with AmTank on it.

Now simply reboot with the disk in df0: "et voila!"


Part 2: Making a non-booting disk for AmTank.
---------------------------------------------

To do this, simply 'unlharc' all the files onto a floppy disk.


SECTION 2 - Hard Drive Owners
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have 'unlharched' all of the files to any directory of your
choice ensure that all of the files are in that directory in the form of:

                              AmTank
                              AmTank.info
                              ReadMe
                              ReadMe.info

Then just double click on AmTank from Workbench or type AmTank while in
that directory in a Shell or CLI.
