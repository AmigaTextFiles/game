@Node "intro" "5inRow: Introduction"

   This is a "Go-Moku" type of game. The aim of it is to get 5 of your own
circles in one row. It is similar to 3-in-a-row (Tik Tak Toe), but here the
playfield is much bigger and you must have 5 (not 3) of your pieces in a row
to win.

This version is only for two human players (no human vs computer option).

@node "install" "5inRow: Installation"

   Just drag the icon named 5inRow to whatever directory.

@node "req" "5inRow: Requirements"

   The program should run on any Amiga with workbench > 2.04. I am also
happy to hear about any bugs you've found in this game.

@node "game" "5inRow: Gameplay"
 The game area is a window divided into 20 X 20 squares. One player has
white circles and the second has black ones which he/she places, according
to turn with the mouse, in one of the empty squares. (From version 1.1, it
is possible to change the colours of your circles and from version 1.2 to
change the size of the game area using @{"icon tooltypes" link "tooltypes" 0}.) The game continues
until one of the players gets '5-in-a-row'.

The score is shown in the bottom left corner of the window.

The next match begins the loser of the previous one.

A bar with the colour of the player to move is on the right side of the
window.

The game will look best on a workbench screen with 8 colours (MagicWB).

@node "tooltypes" "5inRow: Icon Tooltypes"

   This version of the game supports icon tooltypes. With the help of them
you can now modify the look of the game window.

Here is a list of them:
   COLOUR_NET=x ---------- Colour of the net (boxes). Default 4.
   COLOUR_1ST_PLAYER=x --- Colour of 1st player circle. Default 1.
   COLOUR_2ND_PLAYER=x --- Colour of 2nd player circle. Default 2.
   COLOUR_WIN_LINE=x ----- Colour of the "win line". Default 7.
   BOX_WIDTH=x ----------- Width of the boxes.
   BOX_HEIGHT=x ---------- Height of the boxes.
   X_AMOUNT=x ------------ X amount of boxes. Default 20.
   Y_AMOUNT=x ------------ Y amount of boxes. Default 20.

If the width and height tooltypes are not used the program will check the
resolution of your workbench screen and set the best possible values. But if
you decide to use them, it will look best with even numbers. Changing those
values will also change the width and height of the window. If the colour
tooltypes are not used then the program will use default settings.

   V.1.3 - Used more optimized code to speed up the game and to shorten the
           code.
         - Wrote a better documentation.
         - Still no computer vs human option. I know how to do it but I'm
           too lazy.

   V.1.2 - Added new tooltypes to set amount of boxes.
         - Fixed bug with window clearing on higher resolution screens.
         - New looking score.

   V.1.1 - Added tooltypes.
         - Added a menu.
         - Fixed some bugs in the look of the game window on higher
           resolution screens.
         - The circles are now filled.
