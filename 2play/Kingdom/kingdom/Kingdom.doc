	Ok! Now the good bit...

* ------------------------------------------------------------------------- *

	The game is based upon Chess, with quite a few enhancements.
First, the board is 19 by 19 squares, giving a total of 361 squares. The
aim is to kill your opponent's king by taking it with one of your pieces,
while at the same time protecting your own king from attack. An opponent
piece is taken by moving one of your pieces to the same square as the
attacked piece. Most pieces (except the knight) can move only in straight
lines; each piece's moves are characterised by the possible direction and
distance of these straight lines. The board may also contain rocks which
certain pieces can push, either to protect another piece, or to squash an
enemy piece.

	The main game screen contains a panel for each player. This
displays some pieces, and an arrow. The king can be clicked on in order
to find where your king is (when you've forgotten which castle he's in),
while the other pieces may be selected one at time to control which piece
a pawn is promoted to should it your opponent's side of the board. The
arrow is used to pass a move, usually when your king is in check, and
there is no remaining move...time to accept defeat! During the game, 'ESC'
may be pressed at any time to quit the game.

                 .
                /|\
The King        \|/     
* ---- *        _|_ 

	The king may move one square per move, in any direction. He may
not move into a square which is being attacked by an opponent piece, ie:
any square which an opponent piece can move to. The king can therefore
only take undefended opponent pieces. The king cannot push rocks, but he
can move to own of his own rooks, in which case he moves inside it, and the
rook becomes a castle. The king can be crushed by rocks.
	Be careful never to move a piece which was between your king and
an attacking opponent piece. If you do this, and your opponent notices it,
you've probably lost the battle...

                \|/
The Queen       -+-
* ----- *       _|_

	The queen can move any distance in any direction, but cannot push
rocks. She can be crushed by rocks. I think that's about it really.

                 .
The Bishop      //.
* ------ *      \//
                _|_

	The bishop can be moved diagnolly any distance, and it can push
rocks. A bishop can be crushed by rocks.

                  __
The Knight       /oo\ (almost?!)
* ------ *      /_/ /
                "/_/

	A knight can be moved in the usual Chess way, two squares up or
down and one square left or right, OR one square up or down and two squares
left or right. In addition, a knight can perform the same two Chess-like
jumps in one move. A knight can jump over other pieces and rocks, but each
of the one or two squares it lands on must be either empty, or contain an
opponent piece. A knight cannot push rocks; it can be crushed by rocks.
Finally, if a knight performs two jumps in order to take an opponent rook,
(ie: the rook is at the second landed square, and the rook will change
colour instead of being destroyed), then the knight will jump to the first
square, and stay there, whilst the rook at the second square will change
colour.

                ...
The Rook        |||
* ---- *        -+-
                _|_

	The rook can move horizontally or vertically any distance, and
can push a rock during a move. A rook can be used to create a rock in the
first square it vacates at the start of a move. This happens if the rook
is directly between two rocks (horizontally or vertically), or one rock and
the edge of the board. If a rook is attacked, instead of being destroyed,
it changes ownership, and the attacking piece remains unmoved. However, if
the same rook is attacked twice in two moves, then in the second move the
attacking piece will move to the rook's square, and the rook is destroyed.
One further exception is a king which is in check and can move out of check
by taking an opponent rook. In this case, the king will always move to the
rook, and the rook will be destroyed.
And, rooks cannot be crushed by rocks.

                ...
The Castle      ||| (looks the same as a rook)
* ------ *      -+-
                _|_

	This piece is a rook containing a king. When your king is inside
a castle he cannot be put in check by an attacking opponent piece. However,
if the castle is taken by an opponent piece, then it's game over for you.
Alternatively, if the castle is taken by an opponent rook, then the two
rooks destroy each other, and the king is left exposed, but alive!
	A castle can move horizontally or vertically any distance, just
like a rook, except it cannot push rocks, it cannot take opponent pieces,
and it cannot create rocks. In order to release your king from a castle,
you attempt to move the castle diagnolly one square, which causes the king
to be moved to the destination square instead. You can also move your king
out of a castle, and straight into a rook in any neighbouring square as a
single move. A castle cannot be crushed by rocks.

                 .
The Pawn        /_\
* ---- *        \ /
                -^-
	Pawns can usually move up to four squares forward only, and can
only take opponent pieces by moving forward diagnolly one square. They may
push rocks, but can only do so by one square per move. Pawns can push rocks
left, forward-left, forward, forward-right, or right. They can also push
other pawns by one square foward, backwards, left, or right. If a pawn
pushes a friendly pawn (not an opponent pawn), then the pushed pawn can
take any opponent piece which might be in it's path...strength in numbers!
	Pawns are very vulnerable to rocks...any piece which can push a
rock can push the rock directly onto a pawn in order to crush it, without
there having to be a rock (or the edge of the board) behind the pawn.
	If a pawn reaches the opponent's side of the board, it will be
promoted to whichever piece you have currently selected in your panel (one
of queen, bishop, knight or rook).
	In the title screen, the option 'Pawns Move' or 'Pawns Push'
makes one change to pawn movement. If 'Move' is selected, then pawn movement
is as explained above. If 'Push' is selected, then when a pawn moves forward
it may do so by only 1 square. This places more emphasis on using one pawn to
pawn to push another up the board, since this effectively gives two moves for
one.

             _
Rocks       / \
* - *       \_/
    
    These may be pushed by some pieces (bishops, rooks, and pawns),
and can be used to block or sometimes crush an opponent piece. A piece can
only push one rock per move, and a rock can usually only be pushed into
empty squares. Alternatively, a rock can be used to crush a king, queen,
bishop, or knight against either another rock (in which case the second
rock must be immediately behind the attacked piece), or against the edge
of the board (ie: the attacked piece is in a square at the very edge of the
board). Pawns can be crushed using a single rock. Rooks and castles cannot
be crushed using a rock.
