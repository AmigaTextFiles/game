@node History "Ye olde History of Albatross Antics"




Albatross Antics was written by myself a few years ago and was released
onto the internet (ftp://www.pavilion.co.uk/pub/Amiga/AAntics.dms)

The original release was no where near as sophisticated as this `final'
release. It included no simulation of real world physics and was not really
a very accurate simulation of life as an albatross. However, it was, and
still is the fastest game I know of written in Amos that runs on a hires
laced screen (you'll be pleased to know this version doesn't).

However, Albatross Antics has evolved with the help of several play testers
to become the @{"`game'" link game} it is today.

Although the actual game engine has been around for a while, I have only
just recently (1996) finished it off with option and help screens, and the
cinematic intro sequence.

@node game "Game ??"

I use the term game loosely, as clearly Albatross Antics is designed to be
an albatross training exercise.

@node Installation "Installation"



If you're a normal person, follow these steps:



1)  Double click the install icon and follow the on screen instructions.

2)  Look in the directory you chose, and there it is !!


If you are abnormal, copy all the files across to where you want them and
make sure you've got the amos library.

@{fg highlight}Remember:@{fg text} If you've only got 2mb of free ram, you
will need to assign T: to somewhere on your hard drive.

eg.  Type in a shell:

   	                "assign T: work:"

If you've only got a 68020 processor (A1200) and no fast ram, the game will
run slower and slightly more jerkily, so set the speed higher in the
options menu.

@node Play "Albatross Flight manual"


                       @{u}ALBATROSS MISSION BRIEFING
@{uu}




  After the animation, if the screen looks wierd, by pressing LAmiga A, you
can flip back to the workbench. Press it again to go back to Albatross
Antics. If you do this a few times it will eventually look right.
  If this is too mauch hassle, boot your computer with the AGA chipset
disabled. This appears to be a bug in Amos.

To start the game, press fire on the main screen




@{b}
Control of your Albatross:@{ub}


   Use the joystick to rotate the albatross clockwise (left) and
anti-clockwise (right). Press fire to fire.

   You must use gravity and momentum to control you speed. Go down to pick up
speed (greater angle = more speed) and then pull up before you crash. Going
up slows you down.

   If you find you start falling because you're going to slow, aim your
beak down and try to pick up speed.

   If you hit the top of the screen you will turn round and have to be
quick to stop yourself crashing.

   Practise flying around before trying to start attacking the other
albatross (you can put it in two player mode for practise).

  Set the speed in the options menu to a slower speed while you practise.





@{b}Objective:@{ub}


  The objective is simple, kill you opponent 16 times (or watch him
crash!). When you've done this, you've won !!





@{b}Options:@{ub}

   You can access the options screen by pushing right on the title screen.
Move the albatross down or up using the joystick, left and right selects
the options.

   The options are:

	@{"1" link intelligence} or 2 Players
	Speed





@endnode



@node Intelligence "It's Alive !!"



The one player option enables the crafty computer albatross, programmed
using advanced artificial technology techniques.

The 1-player routine closely models the behaviour of a real albatross based
on my own scientific research over the last four years. The routine is so
accurate it can be used to predict albatross behaviour years in advance.

routine) send £5 (sorry, no foreign currency please) to the following

@node Require "Requirements"


The minimum you need to play Albatross Antics is:

An Amiga with a 68020
2Mb of ChipRam
A hard drive

Recommended:

Lot's of fastram


Without any fastram, Albatross Antics will be a bit slow and jerky. You
also need to assign T: to your hardrive (see installation).

@endnode



@node doh! "Doh!"

@{b}
1) You hear a distorted sound, see part of an animation, then it crashes.
@{ub}
Fool! I told you already to assign T: to your hard drive - see installation

@{b}
2) After the animation the screen looks wierd.
@{ub}
Fool! I told you already. Its a bug in Amos, you have to either flip
between AAntics and Workbench a few times (LAmiga A) or reset with the AGA
chipset disabled.

@{b}
3) The sounds seem to repeat during the main game.
@{ub}
Load the game from workbench instead of DOS

@{b}
4) I can't fly the blinkin' albatross
@{ub}
Read the playing guide and practise

@{b}
5) My problem isn't listed above !!
