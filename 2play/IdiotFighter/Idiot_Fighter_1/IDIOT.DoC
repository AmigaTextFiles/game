   Hi.  This is my neat little game and it's called Idiot
Fighter.  Based on the ever-popular novel,_The Extra
Terrestrial Pens From Hell_ by Yixen3 and Franªn, Idiot
Figher combines real live state-of-the-mill technology with
old-fashoned home made apples.  I.F. is a two player game
designed for exclusive entertaining frollicing betwixt two
avid gamers or gamers.  If you only have one gamer, then
die.  You can get an interesting opponent by hitting the
left mouse button with your big toe during play.

   HOW 2 PLaY: (or "Help, I suck.")
          
   Just double click on the happy icon and press a key at
the logo screen, watch the amazin' intro and press another
key, or the same one if you like, choose your character and
press a button, kill the other little guy, say "Wow! this is
a very good game!  I can't belive a 16 year-old made it!
Why can't I do this?  I must suck!  I better join the Idiot
Club by sending my name and address on a five dollar bill
to: Hey, mail person!  I'm an Idiot!
    5902 Galaxie Road
    Garland Texas
    75044
so that The Amazing Rick can send me cool news letters and
stuff and will be motivated to make that MASTURB game of his
and maybe think about making Idiot Fighter II and Idiot
Fighter II: Confusal Edition!"  Then you can think how
wonderful life is and how great Cariann is.

   Press fire to attack.
   Press up and fire to jump attack.
   Charge back, then quickly press forward and fire for a
   flying attack.

   Best 2 outa 3 wins, I don't think you can double KO, but who
   knows?
