        As always, I would love to hear your comments, criticisms and
        suggestions regarding this game.


        I used to spend a LOT of time writing game-engines in an attempt
        to find the fastest possible code and just improve my programming
        abilitiy in general.

        This is one of the game-engines I wrote back in 95. It's for an
        Arkanoid-style game.

        As you'll see, unlike Mega-Ball, I chose to use LARGE blocks as
        I really never cared for those small Mega-Ball blocks!!!

        Of course, you'll also find it to be a bit intense. There's a fair
        amount of action going-on with the blocks smashing, screen lighting
        up from the explosions, lasers blazing through the blocks and up to
        four balls in play at once!!!

        I spent eight days on the original "demo" so, after adding the title,
        the game (as you see it now) is the result of nine days of my time.


        Now, for my standard disclaimer...

        This game was developed entirely by myself, so if you think the gfx
        are a bit poor, you know why, right? Hey, I'm a programmer, not an
        artist!!

        I know the music isn't that great either. Well, I actually spent
        about a full day on that tune!!! Of course, you understand that
        I am a programmer, not a musician.





                         ***>>>   WHAT IS IT ?   <<***


        Well, you must know what an Arkanoid-clone is unless you have been
        living on Pluto for the past ten years (even then they probably
        have their own version which just goes by a different name)!!




                          ***>>>  HOW TO PLAY  <<***


            Again, you must know how to play these games by now!! NO?

            Well, just move your paddle (the thing at the bottom of the
        screen) left and right and try to knock the ball back up and smash
        as many blocks as possible.

            The objective here is to keep the ball(s) in play as long as
        possible (think of it kind of like pinball) with the overall
        objective being to clear each stage of all blocks and eventually
        after clearing all twenty-four stages, you will win the game.

            PLEASE not that the program will simply end as I really don't
        have time to add a victory-sequence. Sorry!!






                          ***>>>    TECHNICAL   <<***


             This game was originally written on an unaccelerated A600. The
        frame-rate will drop on such a machine when there is a lot going on.

        If you have a 68020 or some FastRAM, you should get a nice 50/60
        frames per second update (depending on whether you're using a PAL
        or NTSC system).

             If you have an A500/600, and can view PAL displays on your tv or
        monitor, you may want to play the game in PAL mode. It will help
        prevent the slow-down.





                         For the record, this game (demo)...


                * is WRITTEN COMPLETELY IN AMOS!!!!!!

                * uses ALL "BASIC" CODE, NO AMAL HERE!!

                * uses ALL NATIVE AMOS COMMANDS, NO AMOS EXTENSIONS!!

                * uses BOBS FOR EVERYTHING, NO SPRITES!

                * was CREATED IN NINE DAYS!






                            >> OTHER GAMES BY ME <<

             Well, there are only three, so far:


             Bomb Maniac - this was my first AMOS (and Amiga) game.
                           It's not that great but, it's not horrible
                           either, although I think the version floating
                           around the PD distributors is a very early one.
                           Actually I have a better version but no one but
                           my brother and a few close friends have ever
                           seen it. Anyway, I wouldn't waste my time looking
                           for this one. In case you're wondering, this was
                           another enhanced clone of an old game. This time
                           I tried to take the classic `Kaboom' and update
                           it for the '90s.


             Turbo Invaders - this was my first BLITZ game. I threw this
                              together in one month. Primarily, the purpose
                              was just to have a good `demo' to send other
                              people when I first set-out to form our own
                              software development group, "Unlimited Design".
                              Most people seem to like Turbo Invaders so, I
                              would recommend it.
                              Again, I have a more recent version than the
                              one found in most PD libraries or BBS's so send
                              me a disk if you want a copy. I may upload the
                              new version to a few BBS's so you can check
                              there first.  Version 0.41 is the most recent.


           Star Strike 2000 - this was my latest AMOS game. I threw this
                              together in seven days.
                              This was another "how much can I do and how
                              fast can I do it" game but, geared towards the
                              A1200 w/FastRAM.
                              It also has more focus placed on the "game"
                              side (also known as game-play!!).
                              The game itself is a clone of an old
                              Intellivision game by the name of "Star Strike"
                              I consider this to be my best work to date
                              (taking into account the 7-day development
                               period) and recommend it to anyone wanting
                              an enjoyable game to pass a few hours with.
