---------------------------------------------------------------------
 This game was created using Avantage Software's Shoot-Em-Up Construction
Kit. A wonderful piece of software that lets people who can't program
to save themselves (me), pass on strange bits of weirdness to obviously
bored people (you). This game is PUBLIC DOMAIN, You may keep it, copy
it, play it, give it to friends (or enemies), mock it, or erase it. If
you own S.E.U.C.K. yourself, feel free to butcher it to your own
liking. I only asktwo things of you-
            
            1) Please include this Document with the program (Or someone
               else may get blamed for creating it by mistake.)
            2) Please for heavens sake don't send me any money!  The day
               people start paying for games like this is a sure sign
               that humanity has definitely lost it.
