NANO FLY documentation...

The Nu-Grafik Association brings you another quality product!

GAMEPLAY
  You pilot the Nano Fly in to the Nano-Tech Tower and hopefully out again.
It is no easy ride though. While inside your aim is to destroy as many of
the purple floppy disks as possible. There are a number of items to help
you. These include extra flies, energy replacers, rocket decoys, restart
points and various other stuff.
  Up against you is the Tower's security system. Be careful not to get
squashed, blown up, or wet. You would think that because of this danger your
fly would be spanking well tough, but it's not. Bumping the frail little
thing in to anything will cause it damage (indicated by a red line) as will
standing near your own exploding bombs.
  The Tower is made up of a number of large areas, each containing a disk.
Certain areas have multiple exits. It's up to you to find the best route
through the tower to destroy the most disks. And take note: you can't return
to any area you have already been in.

CONTROLS
 Joystick: Up.... Go up.
           Down.. Go down.
           Left.. Erm.. Go left, I think. 
           Right. Horrendous space KABLOOIE! Ah. No. Actually it's go right.
           Fire.. Drop a bomb.

 Title Screen Keys: Esc.. Quit Nano Fly.
                    P.... Enter password.

 In Game Keys: P..... Pause.
               Esc... End Game.
               Space. Slow mode (AGA)
               Those odd blank keys on an A1200... Nothing, as usual.

AGA MACHINES
  You lucky sods. If you do have a wonder machine you may find Nano Fly runs
a bit fast. Sure it's smooth and stuff but it wasn't designed to go so fast.
If you need the control of a slow Fly just press Space.

DO YOU WANT...
  -A slightly improved,debugged, and upgraded version of Nano Fly?
  -A quality map editor to customise the game's levels?
  -The AMOS source-code for Nano Fly?
  -KABLOOIE! A fun two-player game?
  -A copy of the freeware TNGA game Spatial Hyperdrive as reviewed in the
   Amiga press and even on Teletext (must be good then)?
  -Other stuff and things I've got lying around?

All this is available on two disks for just £5.

 Send cheques made payable to James Pullen to...

   TNGA, 13 High Street, Bishop's Castle, Shropshire, SY9 5BE.

 and I will dispatch your disks as quickly as is humanly possible.

 And while you're at it why not tell me what you think about Nano Fly. If you
notice any minor bugs tell me when you order the disks and I may be able to
fix them very quickly before I send them to you (most bugs take at most ten
minutes to fix). The trouble though is that not all bugs are my fault. AMOS
does have a number of bugs I have already found but no doubt a few that I
haven`t and it doesn`t help that some bugs only come to light when the
game is compiled. I'd also be interested to know what sort of games you'd
like to see in the future from TNGA and on which Amiga models.

HELLO PD PEOPLE
 If you are going to put this demo on your compilation disk or magazine disk
or whatever then do this...

 -It expects to find all it's files in NanoFly: so if your disk isn't called
  NanoFly: then you'll have to assign it.
 -The program needs the DiskFonts.library in LIBS:.
 -Due to crap programing at the early stages you have to set the stack
  pretty high. Stack 15000 should do the trick.
 -All files must be present including this doc.

WORK IN PROGRESS
  I'm doing a sort of over head view dungeon game which currently looks a bit
like Alien Breed Middle Ages Edition. This will not be the case when it's
finished. It'll be more then just shooting stuff, maybe. More like an Alien
Breed-Gauntlet-Zelda cross.
  And I (Mike) am currently doing two games, at the same time and everything,
hopefully. Boing!, a sort of bouncing thing, and Intersteller Overdrive, a
Hyperdrive-like game (But lots better, honest!). And would ya believe I've
just finished a fabulous map editor as well? 
  
HELLO AMOS PEOPLE
  Well, it looks like that French bloke has left us to our own devices.
Are you also one of the poor fools who bought Amos Pro and it`s compiler?
I thought Amos Pro was bugged until I installed the compiler. Nice front
end, nice speed increase, great if you enjoy meeting the Guru. I`m back to
using original Amos. And what about AGA support. Without it Amos will be
dead in the water within a year. Please, if anyone out there is making an
AGA extension tell me, tell the world, we need you.
  Is there an Amos scene outside of Bishop`s Castle? I see alot of trashy
AMOS stuff around but also a real quality game or utillity every so often.
Who/where are these good Amos programers, the ones who actually know what
Autoback 0 does, the ones who no doubt also enjoy Pink Floyd and mountain
biking (for these, in my opinion, are needed for real Amos expertise).
  While on the subject; Jason Holborn, ???????????? Boy do you need a trip
to Our Price and Halfords.
