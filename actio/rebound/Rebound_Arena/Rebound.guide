@node 1 "Background / History"

Background / History:

   Rebound Arena is based on a very old Amstrad CPC 464 game of the
   early 80s - 'Bouncer'. I'm sure many of you have never even heard
   of this game before, even if you actually owned an Amstrad. I quite
   enjoyed a quick bash of it when I had an Ammy, even though it was
   programmed in BASIC. So one day I was tinkering around in AMOS, 
   and decided to make a Bouncer clone, with Rebound Arena being the
   result. 

   The idea is to control a lone ball that continues to bounce off of
   the left and right sides of the screen whilst avoiding the grey blocks
   and collecting the blue gems - as simple as that! This must be done
   in the quickest possible time to qualify for a place on the High
   Score (well Low Time) table. A collision with a grey block results
   in game over. The blocks are layed out randomly (so there is little
   chance of the same game being played twice) aswell as a random start
   position of the red ball (however the start direction is NOT random
   - the ball always starts travelling right).

@node 2 "Installation."

Installation (Hard Disk):

   Installation is very simple. Just double click on the 'Install-to-HD' icon
   and choose a place to install Rebound Arena on your Hard Disk (or whatever)
   and run it from there - simple! The whole installation takes up about 950K.

Installation (Floppy):

   If you wish to copy the game to floppy, format two disks, naming them
   'RA_Disk1' and 'RA_Disk2'. Below is a list of which files to place on
   each disk:


RA_Disk1:
   
   rebound.exe     (executable)
   Install-to-HD
   Rebound.guide
   S  [drawer]  
          |
          --> startup-sequence 
              scores.dat      (high scores - if this file does not exist, 
                                           the game will create it for you)

RA_Disk2:

 
   Pics  [drawer]                                         
             |
             -->arena.iff
                title.abk
                credits.iff
                credits2.iff
                Intro.iff
   Sound  [drawer]
             |
             -->samples.abk
                princess.mod
                title.mod
                checknonotice.mod
                
Don't forget to include the 's' drawer with startup-sequence (that just contains 
the line 'rebound.exe'), and then to install the disk, by typing 'Install df0:'
from shell or cli.

@node 3 "Loading the game."

Loading the game:

   The game can be run straight from floppies (Disk 1 should autoboot) or by
   first installing it to hard disk and running it from there by double-
   clicking on the 'Rebound_Arena' Icon

@endnode
@node 4 "Game Options Screen."

Game Options Screen:

  -Rebound Arena has several options to enable beginners to practice the
   game with more than one life and more or less blocks in the arena. You
   can alter the ammount of Blocks by move the highlighted text (using 'K'
   and 'M') over the 'Number of Blocks' option and pressing '+' or '-'.
 
  -Similarly, the same technique changes the ammount of lives given on the
   'Number of Lives' option. 

  -Instructions can be brought up in the game by selecting 'Instructions' 
   from the main menu with the <SPACE> bar.

  -Music and Sound FX can be toggled from the menu to select the sound 
   during the game.

  -High Scores can be viewed with the High Score option believe it or not.

  -Credits and Exit to Workbench/AmigaDOS options are also available aswell
   as, of course, Start Game.

 N.B. Games are only timed if 30 Blocks are selected and 1 life is selected.
      When both these factors are true, timed games are eligable for the
      High score table. All other combinations of these options are used for
      practice only. The mode the game is in is shown flashing at the bottom
      of the screen. The timed mode can be quickly selected by moving over
      the 'Number of lives' option or the 'Number of Blocks' option and 
      pressing <SPACE>.

@node 5 "Playing the Game.

Playing the game:

   Playing Rebound Arena doesn't really need explaining, all there is to 
   say is that the ball can be moved up and down using 'K' for up and 'M'
   for down - Avoid the grey blocks - 'bump' into the blue gems - do all
   this in the quickest humanly possible time.

   HINTS:
   ______


   - Plan out how you are going to 'attack' the arena before you press
     <SPACE> to start, by plotting a rough route you are going to take.
     You can take as long as you like here because the timer only starts
     when you press <SPACE>.

   - The ball ALWAYS starts moving right.

   - Don't just fly around the screen in any old order collecting gems,
     if three are in a row, try to attack the middle one first, then 
     bounce out for the other two.

   - Don't look directly at the moving ball - look at where the ball is
     actually going to move to.

   - Be Quick!

@node 6 "High Score Table / Leaderboard"

High Score Table;

   You will qualify for this if you time is fast enough (ie better than 
   position 20 to appear on the Leaderboard). Every time the Table changes
   it is updated on the disk, so it is essential that disk 1 is write-
   enabled for it to save the scores.

   If you do happen to get a fast time, you will be prompted to enter your
   name, and you and your time will then be highlighted on the Leaderboard.
   The scores will then be saved. If you wish to clear the high score table
   just delete 'scores.dat' in the 's' drawer on Disk 1, and a new table will 
   be created next time you play the game with times of 99.99 to beat in all
   20 positons. I have included my high score table just as a matter of 
   interest to other players (called scores.dat-mine). They were done on a 
   50Mhz 030 machine, so might not be possible on a stock 500 for example! 
   Just rename the file to scores.dat, and place in the 's' drawer on disk 1
   (or in your Hard Disk's 's' drawer) to see if you can beat any of the times
   to get to position 1 - email me if you do do this - I'll be interested to 
   see if anyone can possibly beat my number 1 time ( I dont think so! ;] )
   
  NOTE:
   (If you play the game from CD, the scores are still saved, because they
    are saved to 's:scores.dat', ie your SYStem or boot disk).

@node 7 "Techical Info / Requirements."

Technical Info / Requirements:

   This game was created on an Amiga 1200 with 6 megs of Ram, Blizzard 1230
   IV with 420 Meg Hard Disk, ATAPI Quad-Speed CD-ROM, 2xFloppy drives and
   an Amstrad Colour Monitor.

   I have tested the game on a standard 1200 (68020 - 2 Meg RAM) and it 
   worked fine (with not much of a speed difference) - I think it should
   work on a machine with less than 2 Megs, but dont quote me on that. It 
   does not make use of the AGA chipset, so will work on a A500/A600 etc.

   One floppy drive is needed only, but a hard drive speeds things up quite
   alot as you would expect.

@node 8 "About the Author"

About the Author:

   Name : Aaron McDonald

   DOB  : 28 - 04 -77

   Well I'm 19 currently studying Computer Science at Sussex University (it
   doesn't show in this game does it?). This is the first real game I have
   actually finshed, becuase of coursework/exams etc, with 90% of the work
   being done by me alone. The in-game graphics were drawn by my brother
   (including the rendered title screen), the rest of the artwork and sound
   done by me. 

   My interests? Well as you may have seen I like programming, including
   'C' and Modula-2. I like most things to do with Science fiction (Star
   Wars especially) as well as going to the Cinema, Sunbeam Rapiers 
   (SUNBEAM RAPIERS ?!!??! - what are they?). Go and visit my web site
   to learn more :

   You can also E-Mail me with any comments / bug reports or anything you
   like:

   Enjoy this little effort.....

@node 9 "Other Solaris Games."

Other Solaris Games:

   Well since this is the first Solaris release, no other games are available
   at the time of writing, but a few are in the pipeline:

  - 'Picaxe Pete'     A nice platform game - collect the keys to advance
                      through the doors - destroy the boulders before your 
                      pickaxe crumbles away, and more...
                      (nearly finished)

  - 'Boolz'           Pang - Type game set over various locations - destroy
                      the bubbles!
                      (50% complete)

  Also I have written a handy '16 Greyscale ILBM' to 'ASCII' coverter to 
convert pics to a nice looking ASCII text picture - handy for sprucing up
those E-mails quickly and effectively.
