These are the sources for Refrax, in Unix format.  Please note that you will
need to download a binary distribution for the resources (i.e. the music, sound
effects and bitmap), and that you will need to install the developer packages
for SDL and SDL_mixer. After that, it should just be a matter of typing "make"!

CREDITS

Refrax was written by Jason Hutchens, with Philip Dunstan. It was inspired by
the mini-game to be found in the pause mode of Jeff Minter's Iridis Alpha, an
excellent game on the Commodore 64. Refrax uses a bitmap of the original
Commodore 64 font without permission.

The four sensational Amiga modules to be heard on the Refrax soundtrack were
created by Moby, of the old Amiga demo scene. These modules are in the public
domain, and are downloadable from Aminet under the following names:

    Livin' Insanity (title)
    More Than Music (in-game)
    Mobyle          (game over)
    Arkham Asylum   (high score)

All but one of the sound effects were sourced from various web sites. All of
them are license free. The remaining sound effect was recorded by us.
