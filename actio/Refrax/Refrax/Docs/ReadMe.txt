R E F R A X

These are the sources for Refrax, in Unix format.  Please note that you will
need to download a binary distribution for the resources (i.e. the music, sound
effects and bitmap), and that you will need to install the developer packages
for SDL and SDL_mixer. After that, it should just be a matter of typing "make"!
