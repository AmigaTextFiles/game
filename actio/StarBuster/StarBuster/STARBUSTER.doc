   NOTICE:
 -----------
  *  Only requirement of this game is a 80 column 'SYSTEM-CONFIGURATION'
 file on the boot disc. If boot disc not contains a 'SYSTEM-CONFIGURATION'
 file (on DEVS or ROOT directory), Amiga sets default font to Topaz-9 and 
 opens a 60 column Workbench screen. That corrupts game design.

  *  Faster computers (68020+) gives better results (faster gameplay).
