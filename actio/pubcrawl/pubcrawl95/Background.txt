I can't remember how most of this works but I do remember spending
quite a few hours developing it.

There is also a very crude level designer (not included) which
creates a simple "MAZEZ.ABK" file for the level layouts (Icons).

The actual level code is hard coded into the .AMOS file using a
parser to create AMAL strings for movement etc.

Not much else to say really.
