This is just a AROS port by serk118@gmail.com


The main help from the original website at 
http://www.loosersjuegos.com.ar/juegos/ceferino?s[]=ceferino



Keyboard
--------
- left arrow key to walk left
- right arrow key to walk right
- "x" for fireing the weapons
- "c"/"z" for sliding
- alt and f for fullscreen/window switch


Side Note
---------
language is not changed fully  so mix match but not hard.

SOund works but (Music(.xm format)) is disabled and if you realy want a music in game than copy a .mp3 music 
file into data/musicas/ and rename to menu.xm and should work and all this because i dont want to 
mess with my build sdl_mixer.

The source code can be found at the site above on top if you want to include xm format and recompile this nice
super pang clone game for aros with music..
