Tron'95 V1.0 
------------

Just another simple TRON-clone. Only a two player mode is supported.
To start the game press 'F1-F4' for different play-areas.
You can only use 2 Joysticks to play the game. (No keys, or mouse!)

This game should only be started from -AGA- computers. 
Maybe it will run from a plain A500 (with some small display-bugs?!?).

If you like this game then please send me some E-MAIL. I will include
any (usefull) suggestions from you.


How to play:

?? Now comments. Use the fire-button the accelerate your 'light-cycle'.
