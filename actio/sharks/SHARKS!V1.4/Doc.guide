 @{u}@{b}How to play SHAKRS!@{ub}@{uu}

 After starting @{b}SHARKS!@{ub} with a doubleclick on the Icon,
 you will see the gametitle and some animations. If you press "O",
 you will come to the options, press "ESC"- for exit the game and
 press the "FIRE" -button to start.
 
 In the game you must get treasures from the ground and bring them
 to you boat. While doing this, watch out for SHARKS! 
 A little arrow, right up on the screen, always show the direction to the next
 treasure.
 Don't touch the electric eels !!! They will give an electric shock and
 push you away .... a hit will cost 100 points ! 
 In higher levels there are some jellyfish, touching them will cost you some points.
 After the 3rd then every 4th round you will come to a bonus-round ...
 Catch the falling treasures to get points - but don't catch the "X"-symbol
 it will end the bonus-level !!!
 If you get the "+1"-symbol you will get a extra live!
 At the end of the time (left upper side), the round will end - so you come
 back to the normal game ...

 
 You can always exit the game by pressing "ESC" or pause the game with "P".

.... LOW MEMORY ...

a. If you don't have enough memory to play the game (the game-music will waist a bit of
   your RAM), please delete the SHAKRS-CONF file.
   You will find it at "SHARKS!/DATA/.....".
   So the game won´t load the music in to the RAM..



b. You can make a bootable disk, so you don`t have to load the worbench first.
   How to do this ?
   
   
   1. copy the whole archive to a empty disk, than open a cli-window.
   2. type :
      copy c:assign to DF0:
      copy libs:diskfont.library  to DF0:libs
      copy libs:mathtrans.library to DF0:libs
      install DF0:
      
      Now you can boot directly from yor SHARKS!-disk !
      
   Remember: The LIBS and the ASSIGN-command are not included in the game
   archive, because I don`t know if it is illegal to give original AMIGA-libs away....
   But everyone has those libs on the amiga-system ....
   


.... CAN´T EXIT THE GAME ....

   On some systems you can´t exit the game by pressing "ESC".
   this will only happen, when you play directly from your floppydisc.
   At this time, I have no solution for this problem ... sorry!
 
   In one of the next versions, I will make a option to skip the
   automatic save function.



.... THE GAME IS TO SLOW ....

   The background colours need some computing time - on slow AMIGAs set the framerate
   to a lower value or set the background at "OFF" !
