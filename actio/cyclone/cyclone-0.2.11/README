Cyclone - a 2d scrolling shoot-em-up game

Cyclone is a simple game which uses the SDL library.
The name might have to change if I find a conflict.
The game is under heavy development right now, and should
be considered unstable.

Special thanks to gdog for the cool name.

Released under the GPL.

STATUS:

You can fly around and shoot the enemy ships.
Right now, all it does is let the ship fly around.
The right and left arrows turn the ship, and
the up and down arrows change the ship speed.
The space bar fires the main gun, and 'M' fires
missiles. Escape will quit.

COMPILING:

do:
	./configure

then:

	make

then, as root:
	
	make install
	
then, to run it:

	cyclone

It expects to find the resources in a directory called $(prefix)/share/cyclone".
Where $(prefix) can be specified when you run configure. (--prefix=/usr for example)
