The Map Editor, Payback, this documentation and everything else that came on or with the Payback CD are copyright. Do not distribute them - piracy kills new software development.@{par}

Original maps produced with this editor are freely distributable. If you create a map that
is based on an existing file you should get permission from the original author before
distributing it. You may not profit from selling maps made with this editor. Please send any maps you make to payback.maps@apex-designs.net so that we can put them on our website for others to download.@{par}

The Payback Map Editor allows you to make new cities for Payback. At present, you
may only use these cities in multiplayer mode and rampage mode. If there is enough demand
for adding single player missions, I may add support for it - although bear
in mind that making single player missions will be a lot more complicated
than making multiplayer maps. Please email me at james.daniels@apex-designs.net if you're still interested.@{par}

All custom maps should be kept in the 'UserMaps' directory of your
Payback installation. You should not copy them into the 'Maps' directory -
this contains the maps used in the single player game and should not be
altered.@{par}

Each city in Payback consists of a grid of 128x128 @{b}square@{ub}s. Each @{b}square@{ub} has
3 @{b}cube@{ub}s stacked on top of it. Each @{b}cube@{ub} has various properties such as
its height (which means that technically it's a cuboid :), whether it is sloped (which means
that it's technically not even a cuboid :), and whether or not you can see it. Since there are
always three @{b}cube@{ub}s on each @{b}square@{ub}, changing the height of the bottom
@{b}cube@{ub} will affect the position of all the @{b}cube@{ub}s resting on top of it.@{par}

As far as the game is concerned, each @{b}cube@{ub} has 5 @{b}face@{ub}s (since the bottom face is
never seen) - called Top, North, East, South and West. Each @{b}face@{ub} has various properties
such as whether it is disabled, alpha-channelled, genlocked or texturemapped, and whether
or not it is flipped.@{par}

The Map Editor is fairly primitive and will always edit the same map, namely
'UserMaps/Test.map'. Once you have
finished editing a map you should rename the 'Test.#?' files in the 'UserMaps' directory
to something more appropriate. Conversely, if you wish to edit an existing map, you
should first rename it to 'Test.#?'.@{par}

The Map Editor will use the screenmode and language you have selected for the main game. For this reason, you should run the game first, otherwise the Map Editor may not work correctly.@{par}

You should now read @{"Editor Controls" link "Editor Controls"}.@{par}

@{par}@{jcenter}@{b}GENERAL CONTROLS@{ub}@{par}(These controls affect the entire map.)@{par}@{par}@{jleft}

@{b}Mouse Movement (no mouse buttons)@{ub}  -  Move view/cursor. (Cursor is always in the centre of the screen unless a region has been selected.)@{par}@{par}
@{b}Mouse Movement + RMB@{ub}  -  Zoom in/out (mouse up/down)@{par}@{par}
@{b}Mouse Movement + LMB@{ub}  -  Select region. Keeping LMB down whilst
pressing Q or A allows stacked cubes to be selected. Clicking LMB again will deselect the marked region and free the cursor.@{par}@{par}
@{b}L@{ub}  -  Load the 'test.#?' map.@{par}@{par}
@{b}V@{ub}  -  Save the 'test.#?' map. Note that the program does not ask for confirmation before overwriting an existing file, so be careful you don't overwrite a map you want to keep.@{par}@{par}
@{b}N@{ub}  -  Wipe the current map. Note that the program does not ask for confirmation.@{par}@{par}
@{b}Esc@{ub}  -  Quit program. Note that the program does not ask for confirmation.@{par}@{par}
@{b}Z@{ub}  -  Toggle nighttime on/off. All textures are darkened when nighttime is
switched on. Note that it may take a while to load the new versions of the textures.@{par}@{par}
@{b}X@{ub}  -  Change weather (normal, snow, rain). Ignored in multiplayer and not shown in the map editor. Rain will
only appear on first level in single player.@{par}@{par}
@{b}Q@{ub}  -  Move cursor up (towards camera).@{par}@{par}
@{b}A@{ub}  -  Move cursor down (away from camera).@{par}@{par}
@{b}C@{ub}  -  Copy selected region to clipboard.@{par}@{par}
@{b}P@{ub}  -  Paste from clipboard.@{par}@{par}
@{b}R@{ub}  -  Toggle routing mode on/off. The routing information is used by the police cars to chase you around the map - without it they'll drive
erratically. It should mirror the layout of the road network. Unused
in multiplayer mode. Controls whilst in routing mode are:@{par}
  @{b}Return@{ub}  -  Select nearest node.@{par}
  @{b}n@{ub}  -  Add a new node and select it.@{par}
  @{b}l@{ub}  -  Add link from selected node to current nearest node.@{par}
  @{b}d@{ub}  -  Delete the currently selected node.@{par}
  @{b}1/2/3/4@{ub}  -  delete specified link.@{par}
  @{b}Arrow keys/Q/A@{ub}  -  Move currently selected node.@{par}@{par}
@{b}O@{ub}  -  Toggle object mode on/off. This mode allows you to add up to six objects to your map. Controls whilst in object mode are:@{par}
  @{b}Return@{ub}  -  Select nearest object.@{par}
  @{b}n@{ub}  -  Add a new object and select it. A menu will appear which will allow you to select the type of object you want to add.@{par}
  @{b}d@{ub}  -  Delete the currently selected object.@{par}
  @{b}s@{ub}  -  Change the currently selected object's type.@{par}
  @{b}w/e@{ub}  -  Rotate the currently selected object clockwise/anticlockwise.@{par}
  @{b}Arrow keys/q/a@{ub}  -  Move currently selected object.@{par}
  @{b}1@{ub}  -  Turn ice cream vans on/off.@{par}
  @{b}2@{ub}  -  Turn police vans on/off.@{par}
  @{b}3@{ub}  -  Turn trucks on/off.@{par}


@{par}@{jcenter}@{b}CUBE CONTROLS@{ub}@{par}(These controls only affect the currently selected cube(s).)@{par}@{par}@{jleft}

@{b}Return@{ub}  -  Change current cube's slope. Can be: "Off" (cube is
invisible), "Flat" (normal cube), "Vert" (top of cube
slopes vertically), "Horiz" (top of cube slopes
horizontally), "RVert" (top of cube slopes vertically
(reversed)), "RHoriz" (top of cube slopes horizontally
(reversed)).@{par}@{par}
@{b}W@{ub}  -  Increases the current cube's 'height1' value. If the cube's slope is set to "Off" or to "Flat", this determines the height of the
cube. If it is set to anything else, this determines the height of one
end of the cube.@{par}@{par}
@{b}S@{ub}  -  Decreases the current cube's 'height1' value. If the cube's slope is set to "Off" or to "Flat", this determines the height
of the cube. If it is set to anything else, this determines the height of
one end of the cube.@{par}@{par}
@{b}E@{ub}  -  Increases the current cube's 'height2' value. If the cube's slope is set to "Off" or to "Flat", this is ignored. If it is set
to anything else, this determines the height of one end of the cube.@{par}@{par}
@{b}D@{ub}  -  Decreases the current cube's 'height2' value. If the cube's slope is set to "Off" or to "Flat", this is ignored. If it is set
to anything else, this determines the height of one end of the cube.@{par}@{par}
@{b}F1@{ub}  -  Toggles whether drone pedestrians will walk on this square.@{par}@{par}
@{b}F2/F3/F4/F5@{ub}  -  Toggle drone traffic flow north/east/south/west. Make sure you make the traffic drive on the left because otherwise the car doors will be on the wrong side.@{par}@{par}
@{b}F6@{ub}  -  Toggle drone traffic straight on.@{par}@{par}
@{b}F7@{ub}  -  Set 'special parameter' for square. Changes contents of crates,
sequence of traffic lights (make sure you also set this parameter on the road squares that you want to be controlled by the corresponding traffic light), start points (make sure you include at least 4 start points and remember start points will only work properly if drone pedestrians are allowed to walk on this square (toggle with F1)) and phone reference numbers (not relevant in multiplayer).@{par}@{par}
@{b}F8@{ub}  -  Change scenery object on selected square (e.g. trees, phones, crates, etc.). The pedestrian crossing appears twice - make sure you use the first variant because the other one will not flash.@{par}@{par}
@{b}F9/F10@{ub}  -  Rotate scenery clockwise/anticlockwise.@{par}@{par}
@{b}B@{ub}  -  Toggles whether police may place roadblock here
(unused in multiplayer).@{par}@{par}


@{par}@{jcenter}@{b}FACE CONTROLS@{ub}@{par}(These controls only affect the currently selected face(s).)@{par}@{par}@{jleft}

@{b}1/2/3/4/5@{ub}  -  Select current cube's top/North/East/South/West face.@{par}@{par}
@{b}T@{ub}  -  Choose the current face's texture. This brings up thumbnails of all
the available textures. Use the mouse to move around all the images, and use the
left mouse button to select a new texture. Press the right mouse button to cancel.
You can also add your own textures to the map - for instructions on how to do this,
please read the @{"Adding Your Own Textures" link "Adding Your Own Textures"} section.@{par}@{par}
@{b}Y@{ub}  -  Change face type, can be: "Off" (face is disabled), "Normal"
(face is enabled), "Genlocked" (face is enabled, colour 0 will be
treated as transparent), "Alpha" (face is enabled, entire texture
is set to 50% transparency, only works for 'top' face), "Reflect"
(face is enabled, texture is used as diffusion map, will shift if
texture is called '#Water.chunky').@{par}@{par}
@{b}F@{ub}  -  Flip texture left-right. 'Top' texture should always be flipped (and
are by default) because otherwise the texture will be drawn slightly incorrectly.@{par}@{par}

The game's textures are 64x64 and in 256 colours. The palette is fixed and can be
found in the same directory as this guide with the filename 'Payback.col'. Textures
must be saved as individual IFF files using this palette with the texture itself in
the top-left hand corner of the file. Once you have created all the textures in this
format you can import them as follows:@{par}@{par}

@{b}1)@{ub} Load the map editor and, if you have already started making a map, load it now.@{par}@{par}
@{b}2)@{ub} Go to the texture selection screen (press 'T') and select the red icon labelled
'Add new texture'.@{par}@{par}
@{b}3)@{ub} Select the IFF file containing the texture you wish to add. Its filename will be
used as the name of the texture.@{par}@{par}
@{b}4)@{ub} The 'new texture' screen will now be displayed. Your texture should be displayed
twice with the following options below the images:@{par}
@{b}Select image (normal)@{ub}  -  This allows you to select a different IFF image
file.@{par}
@{b}Select image (gouraud)@{ub}  -  This allows you to select an existing texture
that should be used when gouraud shading is enabled. By default this is set to the
current texture, but you might want to change it if the current texture is designed
to emulate effects that would normally be handled by gouraud shading (such as shadows
cast by buildings for example).@{par}
@{b}Type@{ub}  -  Can be set to Tarmac, Grass/Mud, Sand, Metal, Snow, Slush, Ice
or Water. This allows you to specify what the texture is made of - this changes the
amount of traction vehicles get, the sound effects that will be used when the player
walks across the square and other parameters.@{par}
@{b}Add@{ub}  -  Click here to store the texture.@{par}
@{b}Cancel@{ub}  -  Click here to exit the 'new texture' screen without storing the
texture.@{par}
You can select the various options by moving the mouse up and down and clicking with
the left mouse button. Once you have set up the texture how you want, you should click
on 'add' (or 'cancel' if you decide not to add the texture).@{par}@{par}
@{b}5)@{ub} You will then be returned to the texture selection screen, which should now include
your new texture. If you wish to add another texture you can do so by clicking on the
'add new texture' button again or you can edit existing textures by highlighting them
and then pressing 'E'.@{par}@{par}
@{b}6)@{ub} To return to the map editor press the right mouse button whilst on the texture
selection screen. Press the left mouse button if you wish to attach the highlighted
texture to the currently selected face(s) in the map editor.@{par}@{par}

Once a texture has been added it will be saved with the map file so you don't need to
include the original IFF files when distributing your map. To remove a texture, go to
the texture selection screen, highlight the texture you want to remove and press 'E'.
Then, use the mouse to select the 'remove' option and click with the left mouse button
to remove the texture from the map - make sure that the texture isn't used in your map
otherwise you'll get unpredictable results.@{par}@{par}

On startup, the game automatically checks the 'UserMaps' directory for '.map' files.
Any files it finds can be selected when playing the game in Multiplayer or Rampage
modes. The only exception to this is the 'test.map' file, which is automatically
filtered out. So the procedure for testing out your map in the game is as follows:@{par}@{par}

@{b}1)@{ub} Save your new map in the Map Editor (press 'v'). This will automatically
write 'test.map', 'test.mini', 'test.thumb', and (if appropriate) 'test.route',
'test.textures' and 'test.objects'.@{par}

@{b}2)@{ub} Quit the Map Editor (press Escape).@{par}

@{b}3)@{ub} Use the shell or a file manager to make a copy of 'test.#?' with a new
name. If you were using the shell to do this, you would need to type the following:@{par}
  cd [Payback install dir - e.g. "dh0:Games/Payback"]@{par}
  copy UserMaps/test.map "UserMaps/My Map.map"@{par}
  copy UserMaps/test.mini "UserMaps/My Map.mini"@{par}
  copy UserMaps/test.thumb "UserMaps/My Map.thumb"@{par}
  copy UserMaps/test.route "UserMaps/My Map.route"@{par}
  copy UserMaps/test.textures "UserMaps/My Map.textures"@{par}
  copy UserMaps/test.objects "UserMaps/My Map.objects"@{par}

@{b}4)@{ub} Run Payback as normal. Start a new game (or load an existing game) and
start a multiplayer or rampage game. You should now be able to select your new level,
which will be called 'My Map'. If you want to call it something else, you should
rename the files to the name you want to use.@{par}@{par}

@{b}Have fun! And don't forget to send your maps to payback.maps@apex-designs.net so
that we can put them on the website for the rest of the world to see!@{ub}@{par}
