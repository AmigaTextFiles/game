This is the bonus game of Global Gladiators ported to Hollywood by
Mr.X of Barracuda. To play the game, simply use cursor  keys  left
and right to adjust your kid and use space key to throw  items  in
the bins. Glass bottles go in the first  bin,  cola  cans  in  the
second bin and paper goes in the third bin. Goal of the game is to
throw as many items as possible in the bins (recycle-o-mania).  If
you are really good at it you will get your place in the highscore

The game ends when you throw an item  in a wrong  bin or  when  an
item comes to rest on the ground or  when you are  hit by an anvil
which falls from the top every once in a while.

You can switch between windowed and full screen mode  by  pressing
COMMAND + RETURN at any time.

Please note that this game is most  likely too slow on 68k  Amigas.
The 68k version is only included  for use on emulators like WinUAE.
Hollywood was written by Andreas Falkenhahn. Please visit his  web
site  at  www.airsoftsoftwair.com  for more information about this
cool program.
