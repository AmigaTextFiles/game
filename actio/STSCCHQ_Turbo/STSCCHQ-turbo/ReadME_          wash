Hi guys.
Here is a funny little game that we knocked up for the AF reader games.
I would describe it as a fast action,big name hollywood avoid'em'up.
You are Guy Cool,the big hero type,and you must stop the wicked Can Of Bad
from perpetrating a Tactical Strike against the Free World.

Controls:
 joystick or arrow keys - move Guy Cool up,down,left-o-right
 space                  - pause
 escape                 - quit program
 F1 (while paused)      - save a screen shot in the ram disk
                          (Ram:TacGrab.iff or something)

This game took about a year to make,because we couldn't be bothered to
work on it most of the time.
Please persevere and complete it,because it has amusing end sequences.
Thanks for reading,and thanks even more if you play the game.

This game is Freeware by Maggot Design!
