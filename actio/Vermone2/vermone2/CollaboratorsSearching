                            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
I'm  searching  musicians  for  simply  projects (little games, music disk,
etc.).   Concerns  me  every type of ProTracker modules, especially modules
with only two/three voices (especially two) for games.  Each module used in
my  projects, will have the author's name in the credits obviously, and for
those who want, their home/e-mail address and a short message.



                        HIT TILES 2 SPECIAL EDITION
                        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

IMPORTANT! Now, I'm searching some modules for HIT TILES 2 SPECIAL EDITION.

If  you want, you can send me set of tiles using as base the file EMPTY.PIC
into  the  directory PICS.  With pleasure I accept 256 colors tiles for AGA
users  (in  this  case  send  me directly the picture and not the converted
files  by  IffToTiles because it doesn't work with AGA picture).  The tiles
will be included in the game.
