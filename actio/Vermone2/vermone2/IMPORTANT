Note!   I have proposed again this old version, only because on some boards
the keyboard input in the high-score page doesn't work.



-------------------------------- IMPORTANT --------------------------------

If  Hit Tiles 2  (or  any  other  of  my  products)  is  put  on  a cd/disk
compilation, please inform me or send me a copy of it.

If  some  paper/internet  magazine  rates  my  games,  please inform me for
informations or for the full version of the game.

If  you  find  this game or any other of my products in some shareware-disk
and  you discover some bugs, please don't write asking me advices!  Because
simply  you  can  find  the  new versions on AMINET!  (Even though with big
delay  because I haven't an Internet access...  so if some cool italian can
put  sometime  my  programs  on  AMINET, he will give me a big help and the
registered  version of the game in question...).  The latest versions of my
games  are:   HIT PUZZLE v1.4 and HIT TILES 2 v1.2  (now  no more bugs into
inserting the name in the high-score page on some boards).  So if you don't
find  these  versions on Aminet, please you register (read the documents of
HIT PUZZLE) or must be patient...
