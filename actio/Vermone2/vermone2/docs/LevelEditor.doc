WHAT IS THIS THING?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
VERMONE 2 LEVEL EDITOR  is a simply  and easy to use  tool,  that allows to
create  up  to  100  custom  levels to use with VERMONE 2.  To draw a block
(where  the  worm doesn't pass), select the upper right gadget with a brown
square  and press the left mouse button to draw on the screen.  To delete a
block,  simply  click  again on a block.  To put a fruit on the screen (max
127),  select  the  upper right gadget with a red circle, to delete, simply
click  again  on a fruit.  On the upper left of the screen, there are:  the
level  which  you  are making (example File:Liv05) and the fruits which you
have  put  (every  level  must  have at least a fruit to be saved).  On the
second  line,  there are the arrows to change the level, and if this one is
been  saved,  there  will  be  the phrase "SAVED", otherwise every time you
change  something  on the level, there will be the phrase "NOT SAVED".  The
saved levels are into directory "CustomLevels"

THE MENU OPTIONS:

NEW    (A. W)      to create a new level, if there was a saved level on
                   disk it will be deleted

RELOAD (A. L)      if you make a change on the screen which you don't like
                   you can load again the level from disk

SAVE LEVEL (A. S)  save the current level (only if there is at least a
                   fruit)

SAVE ALL LEVELS (A. A)  save all levels (only if there is at least a fruit
                        in every level)

SAVE NAME OF AUTHOR (A. N)  save the author name of the levels, it will be
                            shown in the VERMONE 2 main menu (if you select
                            the custom levels)

GOTO (A. G)    to select fastest a level

COPY (A. C)    to copy the current level onto another level (the second
               level will be asked after that you select this option)

                 second level will be asked after that you select this
                 option)

PERSONAL NOTES

to use
