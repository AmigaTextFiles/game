You can move behind the screen with the vi-like keys 'h', 'j', 'k' and 'l' respectively for left, down, up and right, or using the directional arrows. The pause can be enabled/disabled with the key 'p' or the space bar. Using the 't' key you can lock the auto-move walking one cell for time. The 'a' key is provide in order to enable the auto-mode (or demo mode) which allow the game to play without user interaction. The scores are incremented any time you eat a number and will be incremented of that number.
