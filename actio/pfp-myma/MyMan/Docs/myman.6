.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Basic premise of the MyMan video game:
.RS
.PP
\fI\*(lqThose scary ghosts are back, and this time they've spotted
you! What's worse is that they've mistaken you for their old rival
Pac, and they're out for (yellow) blood!\*(rq\fP
.RE
.PP
This is a fast-paced video game using the
.BR curses (3)
library to display on a\ text\ terminal\ or\ terminal\ emulator.
.SS "VERSION"
.PP
This manual page was generated for myman 0.6. Please check
the output of \fBmyman \-\-version\fP to make sure you're using a
corresponding version of the \fBmyman\fP program.
.SS "GETTING STARTED"
.PP
Start playing MyMan by typing
.B myman
(to play MyMan on a\ text\ terminal\ or\ terminal\ emulator), or
.B xmyman
(to play MyMan in full color inside a new window under the X Window
System.) Move MyMan using the arrow keys or
.BR H ,
.BR J ,
.BR K ,
and
.BR L .
Press the
.B Q
key at any time to quit.  If the flashing power pellets are too small,
run
.B myman
with the
.B \-o
command-line parameter or press
.BR O " or " 0
during the game.  If the maze walls are invisible or garbled, run
.B myman
with the
.B \-a
command-line parameter or press
.B A
during the game.
.SS "ADVANCED"
.PP
See below, especially the
.B OPTIONS
and
.B USAGE
sections.
.TP
.B myman
The
.B myman
program plays the MyMan video game.
.B myman
runs in text mode and displays on a\ text\ terminal\ or\ terminal\ emulator.
.B myman
includes several maze variants inspired by similar games, and an
alternative ASCII-art display mode suitable for large terminal
screens.
.TP
.BR xmyman ", " xmyman2 ", " xmyman3 ", " xmyman4 ", " xbigman ", " xhugeman ", and " xquackman
The
.BR xmyman ", " xbigman ", " xhugeman ", " xquackman
and
.B xmyman3
shell scripts are wrappers used to launch
.B myman
inside a new window under the X Window system with approporiate colors
and fonts. They accept all of
.BR myman 's
options. They use either PDCurses for X (a.k.a. XCurses) or the
.BR xterm (1)
terminal emulator to open the new window.

The
.B xmyman2
.RB "shell script is similar to " xmyman ", but uses the " rxvt "(1) terminal"
emulator instead of
.BR xterm (1) .

The
.B xmyman3
.RB "shell script is similar to " xmyman ", but uses the " kterm "(1) terminal"
emulator instead of
.BR xterm (1) .

The
.B xmyman
and
.B xmyman2
shell scripts use altcharset translations (VT100-style graphics). The
.B xmyman3
script uses raw tile characters (CP437 or UCS/Unicode character graphics.) The
.B xmyman4
script uses raw tile characters (EUC-JP character graphics.) The
.B xbigman
script uses large tiles and sprites (ASCII-art) for a more authentic
appearance, but this means you either see less of the game or need to
use a larger terminal emulator window (typically with a small font
size.) The
.B xhugeman
script uses even larger ASCII-art and is usable only on
high-resolution displays. The
.B xquackman
script behaves like
.B xmyman
but selects maze, tile and sprites similar to those used in
YumPop.com's `Quackman'

Any necessary terminal emulators and fonts must be installed and
properly configured for these shell scripts to work.
.TP
.B myman.ct
The myman.ct
.B ctheme
script reconfigures the Linux console or
.BR xterm (1)
color palette for use with
.BR myman .

.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.TP
.B 0
Exit status zero indicates normal completion of the
.B myman
program.
.TP
.B 1
Exit status one indicates an incomplete or damaged installation or
another abnormal situation causing the
.B myman
program to exit unexpectedly.
.TP
.B 2
Exit status two indicates that unrecognized or unsupported
command-line parameters were given to
.BR myman .

In some cases the
.BR xmyman ,
.BR xmyman2 ,
.BR xmyman3 ,
.BR xmyman4 ,
.BR xbigman ,
.B xhugeman
and
.B xquackman
scripts may exit with another status as a result of inability to
connect to an X Window System display server, or as a result of
inability to start a terminal emulator. Receipt of an unhandled signal
may cause the process to exit with some other status.

.SH SECURITY
.PP
Although no vulnerabilities are known, it is recommended that

you bring us one step closer to world domination.
.SH NOTES
.PP
The

command is frequently needed for correct display.
.SH BUGS
.PP
Probably lots. Some of the more annoying known bugs:
.TP
.B "Broken or Missing Character Graphics (i.e. Mangled Maze Walls)"
MyMan uses character graphics to represent maze walls, power pellets,
and other graphic elements. Usually these character graphics are
rendered using altcharset translations (VT100-style graphics,) but
they can be rendered using ASCII-art or raw tile characters (either
CP437 bytes or UCS/Unicode characters.)

For these character graphics to be displayed properly, several pieces
of software must work together:
.BR myman (6),
.BR curses (3),
and a\ text\ terminal\ or\ terminal\ emulator (including any necessary fonts.)
Interactions between these pieces of software may be affected by
environment variables,
.BR locale (7)
settings, command-line parameters, other configuration settings, and
perhaps even the occultation of natural satellites. A misalignment
between two of these pieces can cause the character graphics to become
garbled, or even cause them to disappear entirely.
.\" USE_ACS USE_RAW USE_RAW_UCS
.\" T       T       F               raw CP437 bytes
.\" T       T       T               UCS/Unicode, fallback to...
.\" T       F       -               altcharset translations, fallback to...
.\" F       -       -               ASCII-art

You may work around these problems by using the
.B \-a
option or the
.B A
command to switch to plain ASCII-art.
.TP
.B "Buggy Ghost Behavior"
The ghosts sometimes become lost and are unable to find their way
home, or fail to follow the player into obvious hiding places. Some
mazes confuse the ghosts more than others.
.TP
.B "Lacking Standard Documentation Formats"
There should be a Texinfo manual for MyMan, and some sort of
human-readable manual should be included in the source distribution.
.TP
.B "Inaccurate Status Line in HTML Screenshots"
The screenshot mechanism does not accurately reflect the overlaying of
the status line on top of the maze, so the screen shot may be one line
too tall, and will include any parts of the maze that are actually
obscured by the status line.
.TP
.B "Inaccurate HTML Screenshots"
The HTML screenshot records MyMan's internal representation of the
terminal screen, which may not agree with what you see in terms of
graphic characters (actual rendering varies among terminals and across
curses implementations,) color (some terminals and curses libraries
don't support palette manipulation,) and font (MyMan has no way to
guess what your terminal font looks like.)

Also, different web browsers and fonts will affect rendering of the
screenshot itself. Some browsers and fonts render line-drawing
graphics characters at different visual widths from plain ASCII
characters. Other browsers substitute their own inadequate ASCII
replacements. A few web browsers are unable to display line-drawing
graphics characters at all, or require the user to manually select the
\*(lqUser Defined\*(rq encoding.

If your terminal is configured to use raw CP437 tile characters, the
screenshot will contain raw CP437 data.  Otherwise UCS/Unicode numeric
character references will be used and the document will be labeled as
UTF-8. Some web browsers do not support CP437, others do not support
numeric character references in UTF-8, and still others support
neither!

You may work around these problems using the
.B \-a
option or the
.B A
command to switch to plain ASCII-art and the
.B \-n
option or the
.B C
command to disable color before taking a screenshot to be sure that
what you see is what you get.

.SH "HISTORY"
MyMan was written on a dare on Sunday, 1998-06-28. The original
version had no color or attribute support and only supported large
tiles (equivalent to \-z big.) It was 742 lines of ANSI C and used
three data files: a maze file, a tile file and a sprite file. It
worked with ncurses on Linux and cygwin. Several variations using
other maze layouts were created over the following hours. Color came
in December of that year, as did support for small tiles (equivalent
to \-z small.)
