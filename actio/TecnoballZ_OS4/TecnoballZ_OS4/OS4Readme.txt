TecnoballZ - OS4 port.
----------------------

This is a small gem of a game that orginally was made for classic
Amiga and then later ported to various plattforms so it might be
that you as an OS4 user have seen the game before on amiga ;-)

the game has a ton of options and features and best way is if
you check the options out yourself ingame.

I would like to thank everyone who participated in this OS4 port:
Frak , for dooing libmikmod + the new sdl libs etc.
AlexC , for helping me with making config write as it should.

http://linux.tlk.fr/games/TecnoballZ/  , for screenshots.

enjoy this quality title.

ps: remeber to set your name in options before u start playing
or else u will play as ToAks if youre player one etc ;)
