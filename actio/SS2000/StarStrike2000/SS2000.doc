               WE INTERRUPT THIS DOC FOR THE FOLLOWING ADVERTISEMENT

      Before we get into the doc for StarStrike2000, I'd like to tell you
      a bit about a project originated by my team-mate...
                                        David Howe of Manchester, England



     Have you ever played an animation and wondered what it would be like
     if it had sounds and music along with the graphics?

     Or, as an artist, have you ever wished you could add sounds and music
     to YOUR animations?  Well...
                                  NOW YOU CAN!!


     That's right, thanks to a revolutionary Animation Player/Editor, you
     can now...
                 ADD SOUNDS AND MUSIC TO ANY IFF ANIMATION!!!!!



                               EASY-TO-USE!!
    Everything is controlled by a standard Amiga Point-and-Click Interface.

     The FULL TUTORIAL (created by the artist who developed the original
     concept for Sound2Motion) will have YOU EDITING your own animations
     or, ANY IFF Animation, within MINUTES!!!

     While the ability to add sounds and music to any IFF animation is a
     very powerful one in itself, Sound2Motion doesn't stop there!!

     If you are an artist, who creates your own animations, then you
     realize THERE IS ONE GREAT LIMITATION IN EXISTING ANIMATION
     SYSTEMS...
     The NEED TO INCLUDE MULTIPLE COPIES OF THE SAME IMAGE in order to
     create pauses and such.

     This Wastes Valuable Memory that could, otherwise, be used to make
     even BIGGER animations.

     Sound2Motion EASILY OVERCOMES this limitation by Allowing You To
     Define A Delay For EACH And Every Frame in the animation!!

                                   HISTORY
             version 0.1a completed on Saturday, February 8, 1997


                    version 0.1b  (Monday, February 10, 1997)
             Well, it appears that I was too eager to upload this
             game to BBS's. After playing it several times myself
             as well as receiving feed-back from my brother, I
             discovered that version 0.1 was indeed too easy!!

             So, I have taken 20 minutes, to modify several lines of
             code, add two more and then re-compile the source. As a
             result the game should be just that bit more challenging.
             Enough to make a difference but, not enough to make it
             rediculously hard!!
             I also fine-tuned a few of the trench-palettes and increased
             the delay of the "Prepare for Sector X" display.


                  version 0.1c  (Wednesday, February 12, 1997)
             Well, well... this seems vaguely familiar...
             Okay, here I am again. Yes, it was still too easy so I
             have altered some values a bit more. Now, it should be
             just about "spot-on" as far as the difficulty level goes!!

             Also, as I have this problem you see, whenever I go into
             my code I try to fine-tune a few other things here and there
             (to make it worth my while to re-compile the source, add these
             extra lines to the doc, etc) so, I have fixed the Starfighter's
             Engine-glow (this AMOS is a weird little beast at times) and
             "touched-up" a couple other things (mainly stopping the 3d-
             movement of the trench just before it fires and just before it
             blows-up courtesy of the player.

             For those of you keeping track, I spent 40 minutes on this
             version 0.1c!!! So, that's 7 days and 1 hour, so far...


                   version 0.1d  (Sunday, February 16, 1997)
             ALRIGHT!!!! So I'm back again... it's for a good reason!!
             As I am planning to submit this to the European Amiga mags
             for a cover-disk submission I decided it would be a good idea
             to test the game in PAL mode.

             Well, as I had suspected, the game needed to have it's timing
             adjusted to increase the speed slightly for PAL's 50fps video.

             Also, I decided that since one of my main reasons for doing this
             game was to see how much action I could get on-screen in AMOS, I
             might as well add another saucer. So, now all people with A1200
             with FastRam or better will have four saucers to contend with!!
             Yes, I am too good to you...

             Anyway, these were simple changes so add another 15 minutes to
             my time. What's that make now.. let's see, yes the grand total
             of time for this game has been...

                            7 DAYS, 1 HOUR and 15 MINUTES!!!


                     Now, I AM DONE WITH THIS GAME!! (I'm quite sure)
             Time to get back to the AnimationPlayer. Talk to you all
             again, next game.  Until then, ** Keep the Faith!! **

        As always, I would love to hear your comments, criticisms and
        suggestions regarding this game. Let me say, just in case some of
        you don't realize it and happen to live in the U.K. it only takes
        4-5 days for a letter (or disk!!) to cross the ocean, so write!!

        I wanted to see just how much I could pull off, at 60 fps, on an
        A1200 w/FastRAM in AMOS and also I wondered just how fast I could
        create a game.

        'StarStrike2000' is the result. As stated on the title screen, I
        spent seven days writing the code, drawing the graphics and choosing
        appropriate sound effects and music for this game! Trust me when I
        say that it was one very intense 7-day period!!!

        I am writing this doc after having just compiled the final version
        of the source and, at this point, I am glad to have it finished as
        I was starting to get quite "burnt out" on it. And to think that I
        had planned on completing this project in only three days!!!

        Who knows, maybe I will try to beat my record (this is the fastest I
        have ever completed a game with title, game-play, ending, the works)
        in a few months or so but, for now, I am looking forward to some nice
        relaxing work. Yeah, right! A programmer's work is never done!!


        As far as "how much I could pull off in AMOS on an A1200 w/FastRAM",
        I hope you'll agree that there is quite a bit of action for an 100%
        AMOS-coded game!!



        This game was developed entirely by myself, so if you think the gfx
        are a bit poor, you know why, right? Hey, I'm a programmer, not an
        artist. Actually, I think this is my best looking work to date. You
        know, you get just that little bit better every time. And hopefully,
        my next little game will look even better as Dave (our lead artist)
        is supposed to be putting together a little gfx/animation tutorial
        for me (hint!).






                         ***>>>   WHAT IS IT ?   <<***


             It's a clone. A clone of a game my brother and I played over
        fifteen years ago on the Intellivision. Remember that thing?

             Some of the best games I've ever played were on that old
        Intellivision system. The graphics were incredibly blocky but, the
        game-play was excellent (and quite simple)!!

             One of the better games, for the Intellivision, was a sci-fi
        game called `Star Strike'.


             This is an Amigatized version of 'Star Strike', updated for the
        1990's and beyond!!!!






                          ***>>>  HOW TO PLAY  <<***


             You are in control of a StarFighter, flying over a huge
        battlestation. This station is armed with a Super Weapon capable
        of obliterating an entire planet.

             You are actually flying in a "trench" which contains the only
        known weakness of the battlestation.

             Periodically, you will hear an alert sound (three beeps) which
        means you should get ready because your target is approaching (the
        green object).

             You mission is to bomb that target. A succesful hit will send
        a tremor through the entire station.


             "Nothing to it", right? Well, if it wasn't for the fact that you
        also have to contend with a few saucers, it indeed would be pretty
        easy! These saucers will take pot-shots at you from time to time so,
        you need to stay alert!!!

             Each time a saucer nails you, with one of their shots, your
        starfighter will lose one unit of energy and "rock out of control".

             Lose all twenty units of energy and your ship will be destroyed.
        Each time you "clear" a stage, your starfighter will receive two
        units of energy.

             Oh, and did I mention that all the while you're busy bombing the
        station, and fighting off the saucers, the battlestation is lining up
        the Earth in it's target-site? Well, yes it is. You will see the
        Earth slowly moving into the "locked-on" position.


        If you do not destroy the battle station before the Earth is
        "locked-on", you will experience two things:

            First, your StarFighter will be destroyed!

            Second, the Earth will be obliterated before your very eyes and
        you will lose the game!!


            Obviously, that won't happen with you in control but, I had to
        warn you anyway.

            No, what you are going to do is destroy seven battle stations
        and win the game, right?






                          ***>>>    TECHNICAL   <<***


             This game was written specifically for A1200's with FastRAM,
        or better.

             However, like all of my games, SS2000 makes use of my "System-
        Adaptation-Protocol", which means you can even play it on a stock
        A500/600 but, you'll get a scaled down version of the game.

             On A1200's, you'll get smooth SIXTY frames per second action
        on NTSC machines and FIFTY fps on PAL systems.

             If you have an A500/600, and can view PAL displays on your tv or
        monitor, you may want to play the game in PAL mode:

        A PAL video-frame is around 17% longer than an NTSC video-frame, so
        PAL programmers have always had it a tiny-bit easier when it comes to
        keeping everything running super-smooth, err, SORRY, what I meant to
        say is that a PAL video-frame can handle around 17% more action than
        an NTSC video-frame.

        So, while NTSC mode MAY not be capable of the full 60 FramesPerSecond
        update, meaning it will occasionally drop-back to 30 FPS...
        PAL mode MAY be capable of handling the action at the Full PAL update
        of 50 FPS!!  If you have some trouble with slow-down try PAL mode!!




                         For the record, this game ...


                * is WRITTEN COMPLETELY IN AMOS!!!!!!

                * uses ALL "BASIC" CODE, NO AMAL HERE!!

                * uses ALL NATIVE AMOS COMMANDS, NO AMOS EXTENSIONS!!

                * uses BOBS FOR EVERYTHING, NO SPRITES!

                * yes, it really was CREATED IN SEVEN DAYS!






                            >> OTHER GAMES BY ME <<

             Well, there are only two, so far:


             Bomb Maniac - this was my first AMOS (and Amiga) game.
                           It's not that great but, it's not horrible
                           either, although I think the version floating
                           around the PD distributors is a very early one.
                           Actually I have a better version but no one but
                           my brother and a few close friends have ever
                           seen it. Anyway, I wouldn't waste my time looking
                           for this one. In case you're wondering, this was
                           another enhanced clone of an old game. This time
                           I tried to take the classic `Kaboom' and update
                           it for the '90s.


             Turbo Invaders - this was my first BLITZ game. I threw this
                              together in one month. Primarily, the purpose
                              was just to have a good `demo' to send other
                              people when I first set-out to form our own
                              software development group, "Unlimited Design".
                              Most people seem to like Turbo Invaders so, I
                              would recommend it.
                              Again, I have a more recent version than the
                              one found in most PD libraries or BBS's so send
                              me a disk if you want a copy. I may upload the
                              new version to a few BBS's so you can check

             We're still looking for talented/enthusiastic
        programmers, artists, animators, musicians, and designers
        to join Unlimited Design.

             Currently, there are six of us, located in both the USA
             and England (one designer, two programmers, two artists
             and one musician).

             Yes, we are still working on the commercial game project
             and hope to have it released later this year.


             If you:

             1. Are willing to give Unlimited Design 30 hours, or
                more, of your time each week, doing what you do
                best: Programming, Designing, Composing Music,
                Creating Still Graphics-Images, Animating, etc!

             2. Would like to be involved in the development of some
                of the best commercial software available for the Amiga,
                then...

                         CONTACT ME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!!


        I don't care if you are coding in Amos, Blitz, C or Assembly!
        As long as you are willing to learn Blitz (or Assembly) you
        will be able to contribute to the projects. Even if you don't
        have any experience in BLITZ, C or Assembly but, you are a
        MEGA-AMOS-coder (I know there are a LOT of AMOS programmers
        out there) then contact me.

        We are also looking for high-quality artists/animators
        to work in our Graphics Department as well as superb musicians
        for the Music Department.


          Just send a sample of your work to the following address:
          (Programmers please specify the language you used!!)
