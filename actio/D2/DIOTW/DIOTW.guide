        This game originally started as a way of making fun out of
        Charly.I had lived with it for 3 years,and once it was
        finished,I felt the need of doing something smaller and
        simpler.However,as I started  programming it,I realized the
        potential within and it soon evolved into a quite complex
        game.

        It has got many of the features that are going to be used
        in Charly Episode II,such as the ability to crawl around,and
        shooting in any direction,plus taking control of more than
        one character.

        Compared to Charly this game is easier,since the most common
        thing I heard about Charly was that it was too damned hard.Frankly,
        it's not so hard:it's simply a game which has to be played many
        times,in order to know where the extra lives and stuff are.
        Anyway,here you start with more lives,more energy,the screen is
        a bit wider (so that you can see more),and enemy are not as quick
        as in Charly.

     Extra life: Eerrmmm...guess

     Extra energy: : )

     Pills:  "P" more power
             "R" more range
             "E" extra bullets

     The pills are not compatible IE you can not have extra range and
     extra power at the same time.Likewise,they are not accumulative,which
     means that if you pick twice the same pill,it won't have a double
     effect on your weapon.
     Pill's effects are lost when you move into a new chapter.

     Look at the "Help" sub-menu to see what the pick ups look like!

                             @{b}@{u} PLAYING THE GAME @{ub}@{uu}



     The game is your standard platformer kinda thing.Use a joystick
     in port 2 to move your bloke around,and the fire button to fire
     your weapon.
     By holding down the fire button and moving the stick around you
     can shoot in any direction.
     Enemy can also be disposed of by jumping over them.This is a bit
     easier if you are playing with Kojiro (the samurai),since he draws his
     sword when jumping.

     This game is split in 4 chapters.
     When the game starts,you can choose who you want to play the first 2
     chapters with.If you chose Kojiro (the samurai) you'll play the Snowy
     Mountains and The Forest Of No Return,whereas playing with Yamimoto
     would take you through The Village and The Volcano.
     After completing the first 2 chapters,our friends get together at last
     and from here onwards you'll take control of one or other
     automatically.

     At any time press ESC to lose a life,P to pause/unpause and CTRL + C
     to quit and return to WB.You can also control your guy with the cursor
     keys,and shoot with right shift.

     If you press "CTRL" during play,a screenshot will be saved to RAM.

     Well,I haven't really tested it on lots of different machines.

     It does work on A1200 2Mb Ram (the standard one,y'know).But I think
     that sooner or later you'll get an "out of memory" window!!And at any
     rate,in such a machine,the game is usually slow-paced.


     The recommended setting is A1200 with a 030 board and 4 MB ram.

     I have a 1200 030/40 and 16 MB ram.

     In theory,it should work on any amiga as long as you have enough memory
     and a HD,but I think that on a 500 or 600 it will barely run.

       Like "Charly The Merc",this game is a bit memory-hungry.
       So,even though the game multitasks,and returns to WB (by pressing
       CTRL+C),it might be wiser to run it without running any
       background programs (IE booting without startup-sequence and
       executing it from here).

       1-Remember that you can shoot your weapon in any direction!That's
         absolutely vital later on!

       2-Sometimes crawling is the only way of avoiding enemy's bullets.

       3-There are lots of hidden extra lives and energy to be found.If you
         are to make it to the end,you'll need them.

       4-As in Charly,it does not pay to be fancy.If the enemy is giving you
         an horrendous beating,then you better run away!!

     Just unpack or copy the game where you want it to be.No

     assigns required,and DIOTW does not scatter rubbish all

     over your HD.

    First of all,I wanna thank my family,especially my older brother
    (Higinio) who (again) tested the game and was really helpful.I must
    also thank my cousin Marcos,who playtested this too.

    I want to say hi to all our AMIGA community here in
    Uruguay,particularly Maximiliano Davyt and Aldo Bianchi.

    Golden regards to all the people who liked "Charly The Merc"!

    Mega-thanks go out to Alastair Murray,for making this possible.

    While programming,I listened to:

     OASIS:(What's The Story)Morning Glory?,Definitely Maybe,Be Here Now,
     The Masterplan,a bootleg with all the songs that did not made it
     to The Masterplan,and Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants.

    Actually,On The Dole Software is just a one man team: Emilio Perez.

    However,I want people to help me in the future,doing stuff like gfx

    and sfx.I'm especially interested in both good graphicians and

    musicians,to do Charly The Merc Episode II,and another project I have

    in mind,which is a side viewed platformer,where you take control of

    a kind of cyborg,and the game is ambiented in a Chaos Engine

    style scenario (IE kind of new-gothic).

    For more info on this last one,please e-mail me and we'll see if we can

    do it together.I want to do it before CTM II.

    So,if you think that you can do something good,then please don't

    hesitate to send me a sample of your work.You don't have to be able

    to do amazing things-I just want people who are "mad for it",and are

    prepared to work really hard!

    Death Is On The Way is giftware so if you like this game you have to

    send me either:


    1-An e-nail.Tell me where are you from,where did you get the game

    from,and what do you think of it.Please be honest!If you think it

    stinks,then please let me know WHY,so I can make things better

    in the future.


    2-Money.The registration fee is 5 US$.Of course,you can send

    more! : )

    Frankly,I would really appreciate if you could send me 5 US$.It is

    not much for you,but for me it is A LOT,especially because I live

    in South America.Just take in account the effort than went into this

    game!!

    Rather than uploading just a bit of it on Aminet,I decided to put the

    full thing,and let you make your mind whether or not is worth

    registering.


    3-A gift.I am a big fan of the folowing groups:Oasis and The Who.

    If you have more money than sense,give me something

    hard to find like boots,singles...whatever!

    If you have any Amiga magazines that you no longer want,well,that

    would be a top gift too.I'm a collector,and my fave Amiga mags are

    "The One" and "Amiga Action".

    Books in English are welcome,as well.My favourite author is Joseph

    Conrad.



    ANY of the above would be welcome with open arms!
