    Fix directory creation in makefile, update e-mail address
    
    Fix creation of the PREFIX/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps
    directory, so Debian pbuilder won't complain about missing
    directories. Thanks to Andrea Colangelo for pointing that out.
    
    Also, update Andrea Colangelo's e-mail address in the manpage.

    Fix mouse control, add mouse rectangle, enable mouse by default
    
    Fix problems with mouse control (lock the mouse if
    we are using the keyboard). This makes the mouse
    control work nicely together with the keyboard control,
    so we enable mouse control by default now.
    
    Draw a mouse rectangle on the screen so the user knows
    what's going on when using mouse control. This should
    make playing Tennix a bit easier with the mouse, because
    the racket is always sloppy (you can move the mouse faster
    than you can move the racket.

    Add a high resolution SVG icon that can be used when apps
    want to display a really big icon for Tennix (i.e. Gnome Do).

    Apply patch from Enrico Zini to improve ball movement
    
    From the mail:
    if I understood correctly, the position of the ball is
    updated, then the keyboard events are read, then the
    screen is redisplayed. It should be instead: the screen
    is redisplayed, then keyboard events are read and handled,
    then the ball position is updated: that way the keyboard
    event is connected with what is on the screen, which is
    what the player would expect.

    Fix and improve mouse input, initialize players correctly
    
    Improve mouse input to work alongside keyboard input
    and change the way mouse input works (press and hold
    to move the racket, release to swing the racket).
    
    Initialize the "Player" structs in game.c correctly,
    so we don't get compile warnings and so that our
    variables for each player are initialized sanely.

    Add an "acceleration" effect to the player racket
    movement, so that keyboard control is a bit more
    fine-grained and easier to use (hopefully).
    
    Thanks To Enrico Zini <enricozini.org> for suggesting
    this change and providing the feature request.

    Faster graphics; touchscreen support
    
    Make graphics more faster by only updating the
    parts of the UI that have to be redrawn (this
    could still be optimized, but works well so far).
    
    Add support for mouse/touchscreen. The mouse and
    touchscreen support will not be enabled in Desktop
    builds but will be enabled for handheld devices
    like the Nokia Internet Tablets.

    the last few weeks (photos, sounds and music).
    
    Added new side menu that I've created yesterday
    evening. It's still not finished, but a future Tennix
    release should probably have its menu to look something
    like this draft (tennix-side-menu.xcf).

    Support for BINARY_INSTALL_DIR, Makefile updates
    
    After a suggestion by a package maintainer, the makefile
    now supports the "BINARY_INSTALL_DIR" variable which can
    be used to specify an alternative install dir for Unix-like
    systems. This can be used to install the "tennix" binary in
    /usr/games on Debian-based systems.
    
    The makefile has been updated to more directly remove some
    files in the clean target, so all temporary files get removed.

    Joystick support (via command line); better keyboard controls
    
    Enable more keyboard controls for Player 1 (arrow keys, space,
    left control) and enable the usage of a joystick when the user
    specifies the name of the joystick as command line argument.
    
    This even works with applesmc on Linux, so you can play and
    control Tennix by tilting your Apple MacBook and pressing the
    left control key, which is now mapped to Player 1 swing racket.

    Convert sound samples to OGG Vorbis to save space.
    Sound panning (left, right) for the "racket hit" sound.

    Add font_draw_string_alpha() to draw fonts w/ opacity
    and add font_draw_string() macro (opacity=255).
    
    Add a neat, opacity-based text scroller to the main
    menu and provide input help text (keyboard controls).

     - Hard (concrete-looking grey)
    
    Don't call SDL_SetColorKey() for loaded images anymore, because

    Don't allow the player to hit the ball with the racket when
    an "out" state has been reached. The ball will fly-by the
    racket even with the racket swung at the time of impact.
    
    Disallow keeping the "swing racket" button permanently
    pressed, but add a lock to disallow re-swinging the rack when
    the corresponding key has not been released yet.

    João Pinto pointed out that Tennix will not compile when
    not using bash as /bin/sh, as the makefile in data/ will
    complain about bad substitution.
    
    This has been worked around by making data2csrc generating
    the variable name on-the-fly if the variable name is not
    passed as second command line argument.

    Make in-game ball rotation faster to fit better to

    Resources in binary support, button drawing functions
    
    Added support for converting data files to c source, which
    will then be included and compiled into the binary. This
    makes Tennix run without the "data" folder, and the game
    resources (sounds and data) cannot simply be edited for the
    binary distribution.
    
    Added first cut of button drawing routines which can be
    useful for menu navigation later on. (including text)
    
    Fix space character in Smallish font.

    In-game scores are now displayed using the fond code, the
    "score.png" graphic and show_digit() function got removed.
    
    Add dkc2 font, and improve font and graphics code (image
    width, image height, sprite width, simplified char search.
    
    New draw_line_faded() method that draws a line with faded
    colors, fixed old draw_line() code and make draw_line() a
    macro that calls draw_line_faded().
    
    Add support for quitting tennix by closing the tennix window.
    
    Elektrons beatified, added faded line drawing. Move around
    items in the menu, remove sound + racket animation.
    
    Fade to black the menu when quitting.
    
    Clean-up stuff in tennix.h.

    Make the "release-osx" target create a zipfile that is
    named "tennix-x.y.z-macosx.zip" (added "-macosx").

    This is Tennix 0.3.3, adding the first version of our dynamic
    text engine, which enables us drawing animated bit-mapped fonts
    to the screen. Currently used in menus and as gameplay status.
    
    This also disables loading the custom icon (SDL_WM_SetIcon)
    when Tennix is ran on Mac OS X, as Tennix on OS X already has a
    beatiful icon and OS X doesn't display per-window icons.

    Support for ball service; AI improved; gameplay fading
    
    Add support for doing serving the ball (using a stopped,
    non-moving ball that the player has to hit to start the
    game) and re-factor ball-resetting code into a seperate
    function.
    
    Improve AI player movement to make the game livelier :)
    
    Fade between two scores and block input (both human and
    AI input) while the scene is being faded to add a smooth
    crossfade between scores. Don't wait for keypresses as
    before.
    
    Fade out audience sound when returning to main menu.

    Move release information to makefile, update win32 target
    
    Move release version information to makefile where it will
    be used for release file naming and remove it from tennix.h,
    so we have the release version information in one central
    location for both code and release work.
    
    Update the win32 target to create tennix-x.y.z-win32.zip.

    Modularize human input and AI input (AI vs. AI testing)
    
    Add input_human and input_ai functions that handle human
    and computer-controlled players and added several flags
    and settings to the Player struct.

    the quality of our AI code. AI vs. AI is currently the
    default for single player mode (still in testing mode :).

    controlled by an AI tennix bot which is quite good at
    playing tennix.

    scores menu item currently. Still no difficulty settings.

    Added a yellow circle and a gray shadow to the
    Tennix pygame 3D-rendering test. The shadow size

    ball and shadow size decrease when the ball moves
    away from the observer.
