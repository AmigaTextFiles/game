This is just a quick port to MorphOS from HAK (hak@vip.at).

For further instruction just take a look at the internal help and/or visit
the original website at 
http://www.loosersjuegos.com.ar/pagina.php?nombre=proyecto_don_ceferino...

PS:
- Steering is done with the cursor keys.
- "x" for fireing the weapons
- "c"/"z" for sliding

PPS:
Localization doesn't work ATM (will be fixed later (hopefully)).
