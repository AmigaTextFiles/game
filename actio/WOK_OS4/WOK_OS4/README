Game title:
WOK


Brief description(how to play):

Unpack wok_bin1_0.tar.gz (for i386) and type './wok' at 'wok' directory.

Select 'START' by mouse at the title screen to start the game.
To quit the game, select 'QUIT'. Typing an escape key also quits the game.

The game objective is very simple.
Catch the falling balls by the wok(a flying pan)
and throw them to the right.
You can control the wok by mouse.

To earn more score, you should throw many balls continuously.
Collect many balls on the wok, and throw them at the same time.

If a ball falls to the lower end of the screen, the game is over.

These options are available:
 -nosound           Stop the sound.
                    If you have a trouble with the audio device, 
                    use this option.
 -mousespeed speed  Change the mouse speed. Default = 10.
                    If the wok's speed is too fast/slow, use this option.
 -window            Launch the game in the window, not use the full-screen.


Build instructions:

Unpack wok_src1_0.tar.gz and type 'make' at 'wok' directory.
If the make does not complete correctly,
check 'SDL_LIB' and 'SDL_INCLUDE' path in Makefile.
You should install the libraries(and development libraries) listed below.
