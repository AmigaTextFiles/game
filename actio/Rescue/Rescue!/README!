GAME CONCEPTS
-------------

The game is a mix of top down racer, Lemmings and Alien Breed.

The game is intended to be fun to play. I wanted to remove all the
annoying things about games; like not being able to exit, having to play
the same level again and again, always being under pressure etc.

This game allows you plan your strategy for the level, to practice driving
and shooting, and to try out the levels features. Then you shoot a reactor
and PANIC ! You never die, you are cloaned as many times as you need.

The game features:
- 15 levels
- large scrolling map ( double buffered dual playfield with separate hi-res status screen )
- 72 car images for smooth car rotation
- different floor surfaces - ramps, ice, rough
- fire doors and security doors
- deadly mines and traps
- bridges and tunnels you go under and over !
- multiple shots with multiple rebound

I like to hear from anyone who would improve the graphics, add sound track, game ideas etc.
I could supply a map editor.
