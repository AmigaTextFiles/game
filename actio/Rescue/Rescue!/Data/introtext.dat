The story so far ....
The Kretaiyan race has invaded the settlement
at Galnone capturing many of the settlers.
The Galnones are free to traverse the settlement
zones but cannot leave because the only way into
and out of each settlement zone is through the
teleport system and the Kretaiyans have disabled
the power grids to the teleporters.

The rescue mission ....
The Plaxtron A1 Generator has suggested a scheme
to rescue the captives.
If all the Mini-Nuke Reactors in each zone are
destroyed an emergency power grid system will
boot up, bypassing the normal power grids, and
re-enabling the teleport systems.
A simple idea but unfortunately, the Mini-Nuke
Reactors leak dangerous levels of radiation when
destroyed, allowing only a limited time for the
Galnone and yourself to get back to the teleporter
before radiation penetrates the shields.

Your Equipment ....
We have located a Space Rover vehicle identical to
ones used by the Galnones and fitted it with a
plasma cannon.
The ongoing war has depleted reserves, so all the
Plasma Vessels and Shield Packs you need must be
collected from Galnone.

Whats in it for you ....
You will be credited for any Plasma Vessels and
Shield Packs you can recover from the planet.
You will earn many cedits for each Galnone you
rescue but if you kill a captive through plasma
bolts or radiation exposure credits will be
deducted to cover legal costs.
Before you leave base your personality and
memories will be downloaded into the Major
Jergon-Mesh.
If you should die whilst on the mission a new body
will be prepared and uploaded with your persona
from the Mesh.
This costly process will consume all your current
credits.

Additional data ....
The Plaxtron pedicts 97% probability the
Kretaiyans have set traps.
You will also encounter a problem with security
doors in high security zones which can only be
opened by Galnone inhabitants.
