Fnurr2000 v2.0 - (C) DawnBringer 1995-2000 (September 2000)

Code, gfx & music by Richard 'DawnBringer' Fhager.

This is re-compilation of an old and very simple game.
It`s a good demonstration of how simple a game can really be...but
still be worth to play.

You either play with a joystick or use the arrow keys.

You control a single pixel (with joystick or keyboard) that`s beeing
chased by 25 other pixels. If two or more enemy pixels collide they
explode. If any of the enemy pixels get caught in an explosion they
also explodes. If you hit any enemy pixels or explosions - you die!

You score n^3 (n*n*n) points for the pixels that collide at the SAME time!
ex. If 4 pixels impact at the same time you score: 4 * 4 * 4 = 64 points.
You also score 1 point/sec as long as you stay alive.

The longer a single enemy pixels is alive - the faster it gets!
