There is some bug in the horizontal line still. When it removes
the line it removes 'too much' to the right. This is the
easiest way to see it:

   - Make a base in the map that is hanging in mid-air.
   - Fly with the ship to the RIGHT side of the base and
     you will see how one line of the ship becomes red
     because the horizontal line is removing pixels too
     far to the right..

  ^^^^^ May be fixed already, don't remember..


When handleIDCMP was moved before the drawing routines some probelms
have arised with fueling and probably also with shields when the
ship runs out of fuel. This has to be corrected..

Lots of things unstable with the communication...
