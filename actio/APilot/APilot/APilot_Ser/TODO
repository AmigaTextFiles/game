Somekind of ctrl-c handling is needed. Now the game can very easily 
lock up waiting for data from the remote site. Also should implement
some timeout handling into the serial routines, so that it can recover
from errors or missing data.

A chat window or something similar is needed upon startup...It could
open a window on the wb divided into 2 parts. One part is the remote
site and the other is the local. Then there should be a 'start' button,
and when one of the players hit it, the game would start..

Make the two games exchange and check important information like FPS,
same mapfile etc..

Better serialspeed, more asynchrounous? A separate server and client?
The game is slow with modem but quite playable with nullmodem -> the
modem probably buffers data for a while..hmm.
