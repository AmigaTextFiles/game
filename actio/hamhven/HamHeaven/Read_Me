In the small village of Hamburg we find a single
factory, HAMBURGER HEAVEN.
There are about 2000 people who live in the village
of Hamburg, and almost all of them work at 
Hamburger Heaven.
The factory has been the countries main supplier of
fast-food burgers.
It has been in operation since 1947, and has grown
to employ over 1400 people.
It is controlled by one man, Robert the hot dog.
Robert believes in good pay for good work, and
all the employees love him for it.

Everything was going fine, into one day Robert
had a bad heart attack. After coming home from the
hospital, the doctor, said: Robert, you must give
up work, your heart cannnot last much longer.

Robert was emotionaly crushed, the business was
his life.
Luckily, Robert has two sons, who can take his
place at the company.
Henry the hot dog, who is a fine outstanding man,
and Homer the hot dog, who is'nt so fine.
Robert decided to let each of his two sons, have
a try at running the business, the one who can
complete his job the best, will be the new owner
of Hamburger Heaven.

Homer was furious at his fathers decision, since
he was the oldest son, he said, the factory should
rightfully go to him.
He held a secret meeting with some of the employees
at Hamburger Heaven, and convinced a few followers
to stop Henry.
-----------------------------------------------------

This must not happen!
If Henry the hot dog,is stopped from completing his
job, the factory will belong to Homer the hot dog.
And rumor has it that Homer will sell the factory,
take the money and leave the country.
The economy of Hamburg will be destroyed...
Everyone will be forced to sell their homes, for
next to nothing, and move away.
-----------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------

You must control Henry the hot dog, with a joystick
plugged into the regular joystick port.
Moving the joystick left, right, up and down, makes
Henry move in the corresponding direction.

Henry must make his way through 6 levels, to win
the game, and inherit Hamburger Heaven.
-----------------------------------------------------

Henry will start on level 1, here he must walk
around, avoiding any strange creatures he sees.
Once in awhile an item will appear which will help
Henry, to complete the level.
If Henry sees an 'Ice Cream Cone' touch it, it
will freeze a creature for awhile.
If Henry sees a 'Bottle of Soda' touch it, it
will magicaly remove one of the creatures, for
awhile.
And the most important item, a 'sack of Flour'.
If Henry sees this, touch it to pick it up.
The flour can be carried into needed by Henry.
When Henry needs to use the flour he picked up,
just press the Fire-Button, Henry will sneeze 
because of the flour, and the sneeze will scare
all creatures on screen, for awhile.

Henry must get two hamburgers on each level, in
order to go to the next level.
This is done by the following way:
 Soon after each level begins, a hamburger will
 drop down from above, if the burger is white
 then it is still frozen, and henry must wait
 into it is cooked before he can get it.
 When the burger is cooked it turns brown.
 Sometimes, a burger will drop down already
 cooked for Henry..
 Touch the burger with henry, it will drop down
 to the level below, continue doing this into 
 then burger is off the screen. When henry has
 gotten two burgers he will go on to the next
 level.

--------------------------------------------------------

If henry is captured (killed) by being touched by
one of the deadly creatures, the evil forces will
have won, they will see their victory in the
morning newspaper.
If henry completes his task, and makes it through
all six levels, the people of the village of
Hamburg, will read the good news in the morning 
paper.
