NAME
       xpilot - XPilot/UX  Multiplayer gravity war game client

SYNOPSIS
       xpilot [-help] [-version] [-name nickname] [-team team-
       number] [-join] [-list] [-shutdown [message]] [-display
       string] [-port port-number] [configuration-options]
       [server-host ...]

OVERVIEW
       XPilot is a multiplayer game which looks a bit like Thrust
       for the Commodore 64.  Thrust has some similarities with
       Atari's coin-up games Gravitar and Asteriods (not a mis-
       spelling) - they were the originals.  Several clones have
       appeared for various computers, among others Gravity Force
       for the Commodore Amiga.

       The main objective of the game varies as you can choose
       different game modes, although the only modes supported as
       of today are combat (optionally with teams and/or limited
       lives) and race.  The former mode focuses more strongly on
       shooting each other down, while the latter is more a
       piloting test than anything else.

       To start playing, you need to connect to a server by using
       a client program called xpilot.  If there are no servers
       running, you will have to start one of your own (see man-
       page xpilots()).

   Options
       -help          Prints some help, including commandline
                      options.

       -version       Prints the current version.

       -name player-name
                      Lets you use an alternative name during the
                      play (may be handy :).  If this option
                      isn't specified, and you haven't set the X
                      resource name, you will be known by your
                      login name.

       -team team-number
                      Joins team number team-number.  See below
                      for notes about team play.  When the server
                      is not configured for team mode, this
                      option has no effect.

                                                                1

       -help          Prints a small usage message.

       -version       Prints version information.

       -join          Automatically joins the first server you
                      get response from.

       -list          Queries status information from all servers
                      found.

       -shutdown [message]
                      Sends a shutdown to the server, the message
                      part is optional.

       -name nick     Specifies your nick name.

       -team number   Specifies your wanted team number.

       -display display-string
                      Specifies which X server to contact.

       -port number   Specifies the port number to use when con-
                      tacting a server.

       configuration-options
                      All the X resource values can be configured
                      seperately from the command line.  For
                      example to change the ecm key to just `z'
                      use; -keyEcm z

       server-host    Tries to connect to server at host server-
                      host.  The default is to send a broadcast
                      query on your attached network.

PROMPT COMMANDS
       When you startup xpilot without the -join option, you will
       get a prompt asking you for directions.  You may type h or
       ?  to list the available commands.  These are quite obvi-
       ous and deal with communication to the current server
       only.  You may enter the game by pressing CR
       (Return/Enter).

       If you are the owner of the server you will have a few
       extra options.  See xpilots().

THE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE
       When you enter a game you will hopefully be presented a
       window.  This window is divided into three major areas:

            Radar       (Top left) This area shows the map the
                        server you are playing on is using as

                                                                2

XPILOT

                        well as the position of your fellow play-
                        ers (if they aren't cloaked).  In race
                        mode the radar also outputs the position
                        of the control posts.  Players are shown
                        as small rectangles The player you are
                        currently locked onto is shown as a
                        flashing rectangle.

                        The server can optionally display mis-
                        siles, mines and/or bombs (moving mines)
                        on this radar, and will display them
                        using different symbols; missiles are
                        quick flashing small dots, mines and
                        bombs slow flashing small dots.  If
                        nuclear mines or missiles are launched
                        the radar can detect the high energy
                        radation emiited and will show these
                        types of weapons on the radar as alter-
                        nating small and large rectangles.  The
                        radar always has a limited range for
                        these objects, due to their small size.
                        The maximum range depends on how much
                        fuel you are carrying.

            Rating list (Bottom left) This area shows the list of
                        players (sorted with respect to their
                        rating, or `score') currently logged on
                        the server.  The player with the highest
                        <rating>/<num of times died> ratio - that
                        is, the most `deadly' player - is under-
                        lined with a stipled line.

                        First on each line, you might find a let-
                        ter which gives you some information
                        about the status of the player: R means
                        the player is a robot, T means the player
                        is not a player but a detached tank, D
                        means player is dead (only possible in
                        limited lives mode), P means the player
                        is paused and W means the player is wait-
                        ing to join the game after login (in lim-
                        ited lives mode).

                        Depending on the current game mode, you
                        will also find information about which
                        teams each player belong to and how many
                        lives each player has left.

            Game area   (Right) This is where the action is.
                        Most notably you will see your fighter in

                        won't see any shots or explosions yet!

                                                                3

                        You may also see some strange blue draw-
                        ings surrounding your fighter - this is
                        the HUD (Head Up Display) which greatly
                        simplifies and compresses the information
                        you need to know.  Currently, the HUD
                        displays the following information:

                 Bonus items You may notice some symbols and num-
                             bers on the left side of the HUD,
                             these indicate which, and what quan-
                             tity, of extra equipment you have.
                             This list can be turned off using
                             the `o' key, then only items which
                             you gain or loose will be briefly
                             shown on the HUD.  Pressing `o'
                             again will constantly show owned
                             items.

                 Fuel        A fuel meter will appear on the
                             right side of the HUD when you are
                             getting low on fuel, it will start
                             flashing when your fuel level gets
                             dangerously low.  The fuel is numer-
                             ically displayed on the bottom right
                             corner of the HUD.

                 Lock        The name of the player you have cur-
                             rently locked on is shown on the top
                             of the HUD.  The distance and bear-
                             ing to that same player is visual-
                             ized by a dot where placement of the
                             dot gives the direction, and the
                             size of the dot gives the distance.
                             The dot will be filled if the player
                             is not on the same team as you.  The
                             distance to the player also numeri-
                             cally displayed on the top right
                             corner of the HUD, it is measured in
                             `blocks'.

                 Velocity    (Optional) The position of the HUD
                             changes with the current velocity.
                             The distance from the center of your
                             screen is proportional to your
                             velocity.  Moving to the top moves
                             the HUD to the bottom.

                             In addition to the moving HUD, you
                             can display a line from the center
                             of the HUD to the center of your
                             ship.

                             Both indicators can be combined or

GAME CONCEPTS
       The game objective varies as the server (xpilots()) is
       very configurable.  However, below you will find short
       descriptions of some of the main concepts of the game.

   Gravity
       All objects in the game are affected by gravity - that is,
       they will accelerate in the direction the gravity is
       strongest.  The strength and direction of the gravity is
       user configurable (see xpilots()), and can even be set to
       0.

       Some objects affect the gravity in a limited area, these
       are called gravs and they exist in miscellaneous types
       (attractive, repulsive, clockwise, anti-clockwise).  Gravs
       are shown as red circles with some symbol inside which is
       different for each type of grav.  (For more information on
       how the affect the gravity, see xpilots().)

   Wormholes
       Wormholes are shown as red rotating circles.  They will
       `teleport' you to another place in the world.  Generally,
       when you go through a wormhole, you'll come out at the
       nearest wormhole in the direction you were travelling.
       Some wormholes are enter-only and some are exit-only.  The
       exit-only ones are invisible.  Passing through a wormhole
       will make you visible for a while if you were cloaked.

   Fuel
       You will also have to worry about your fuel level as most
       equipment use fuel/energy and some even work better the
       more fuel you have.

       You may gain fuel by picking up special `fuel cans' (see
       bonus items section) or refueling at a refuel station.
       Refuel stations may be found in blocks in the world, they
       differ from standard background blocks in that they have a
       red/black F in them, and they are partly or completely
       filled with red.  The amount of red determines how much
       fuel the station has at available for you.  To refuel, you
       must hit the keyRefuel key (see controls section).

       Fuel takes up mass and will also determine how big the
       explosion will be when (sorry, `if' :) you meet your

                                                                6

       destiny.

   Combat
       There are two different and mutually exclusive modes which
       have greatly different objectives: combat mode and race
       mode.  The most extensive is the combat mode, which also
       happens to be the default.

       Here your main objective is to get as high a rating as
       possible by `blasting away' on enemy fighters (human or
       robot controlled) and cannons.  All will naturally fire
       back at you, so you will also need some nifty piloting
       skills and/or some heavy equipment to really enjoy living.
       Extra weapons are explained in the bonus items section.

   Race
       In race mode, your objective is to fly as fast as you can
       through a specified route.  This is done by passing check-
       points in a specified order.  The finish is reached after
       three laps.

       The next checkpoint is always visible on the radar.

   Team play
       Team play is useful in combination with combat mode.  It
       is different from straight combat mode in that players on
       your own team are not considered enemies.  There are some
       additional objectives too.

       You can gain points if the map you are using have targets
       or treasures.  The main difference is that you get points
       by blowing up an enemy's target using shots or mines.  A
       shot will only damage a target and if the target is com-
       pletely damaged then the next shot will blow it up.  A
       mine will immediately destroy a target.  Two missile hits
       will also destroy a target.

       Enemy treasures have to be stolen from the enemies and
       dropped on your own treasure.  You pick up a treasure by
       using keyConnector when flying nearby the enemies trea-
       sure.  This will attach the treasure to your ship with a
       strong rubber band. Now you have to move your ship away
       from the treasure while holding the keyConnector down.
       When you reach a certain distance the rubber band will be
       drawn in a sollied line. This means that the treasure is
       attached to your ship.  It is possible (in emergency situ-
       ations :) to detach the enemy treasure by pressing key-
       DropBall, but this will of course not gain you or your

       team any points.

       Certain maps may configure targets as passable by team
       members, in which case they can act as wall shields for
       team bases.

   Shields
       You may or may not have shields at your disposal, depend-
       ing on the server options specified.  If you have, they
       are activacted with the keyShield key (see controls sec-
       tion).  Generally collisions with other objects (except
       for debris and sparks) are lethal, but when you are hit by
       something with your shields up then it will only cost you
       some fuel/energy.  If you didn't have enough fuel then the
       collision will be lethal again.  Having your shields up
       costs fuel.

   Bonus items
       During the game you might encounter blue triangles with
       red symbols on - these are special bonus items which will
       make your life easier.  As of today, these items include:

            Fuel can    More fuel/energy.

            Cloaking device
                        Makes you invisible for other players,
                        both on radar and on the screen.  How-
                        ever, when you are hit by a shot or mis-
                        sile or bounce with another player then
                        you will be temporarily visible again.

            Sensors     Enables you to see cloakers to a limited
                        extent.  Having more sensors improves
                        this.

            Afterburner Your main engine becomes more powerful
                        and uses your fuel more efficiently.

            Rockets     Pack of rockets.  These may be used as
                        smart missiles, heat seaking missiles, or
                        just plain dumb torpedos.  Usually these
                        explode on impact with a small debris
                        explosion.  However, if enabled, nuclear
                        and/or cluster variants of each may be
                        possible.  See the description of

            Mine        Pack of mines.  Can be dropped as either
                        moving mine (bombing) or stationary mine
                        (mining).  Usually these will explode
                        when someone else comes within a few
                        blocks, causing a large debris explosion.
                        However, if enabled, nuclear and/or clus-
                        ter variants of each may be possible.
                        Mines have a little intelligence and will
                        not explode for the player (or team mem-
                        bers) who dropped them.  However, the
                        targetting of mines can be effected by
                        ECMs (unless the server option ecmsRepro-
                        gramMines is false).  If you get close
                        enough to a mine, you will be able to
                        sense who the mine is currently pro-
                        grammed by.  Mines dropped by different
                        players have a different external appear-
                        ance -- mines dropped by you or your team
                        show up hollow.  Reprogramming does not
                        change the appearance of a mine, so be
                        careful because a hollow mine may not be
                        safe.  See the description of keyTog-

            Tank        Additional fuel tank (perhaps with some
                        spare fuel).  As you pick up more tanks,
                        your weight increases and you'll have to
                        compensate by picking up afterburners.
                        You can change which tank is the `active
                        tank', that is the one that fuel is
                        drained from (if this tank is empty, fuel
                        is drained from all tanks).  Refueling is
                        quicker with more tanks.

                        To ease filling several tanks in paral-
                        lel, all the tanks drain into their left
                        neighbours (0<-1<-...<-8); except your
                        active tank, which is watertight (it
                        seems a bit complicated at first, but
                        trust me, you'll get it eventually :-).
                        Tanks don't drain if they reach a certain
                        minimum level (unless of course, you use
                        it as the active tank).

                        When you detach a tank it is the active
                        one that is detached, unless the active
                        tank happens to be your main tank, in
                        which the tank with the highest number is
                        used.  The detached tank will have the
                        shape of a ship and will carry your name,

                                                                9

                        it will immediately start thrusting (as
                        long as fuel permits) and will fool all
                        heat-seekers to follow it.

            ECM         Electronic Counter Measures.  ECM allows
                        you to confuse and re-target smart mis-
                        siles within a certain range of your
                        ship.  When missiles are zapped by ECM,
                        they will become confused for a while and
                        then have a high probability of going
                        after the player who you were locked onto
                        when you used the ECM.  The ECM will also
                        cause within a certain range to either
                        explode or be more likely be temporarily
                        be blinded such that they do not explode
                        if you go near them.  The closest mine
                        within ECM range may be reprogrammed to
                        be safe for you and your team members. If
                        another ship is within range of the ECM,
                        all it's sensors will freeze for a while
                        and if the ship was cloaked, it will
                        become visible for a while.  The ECM is
                        activated by pressing the keyECM key.

            Transporter Enables you to steal equipment and
                        energy/fuel from the closest fighter,
                        provided it is within the transporters
                        range.  You activate the transporter by
                        pressing the keyTransporter key.

            Laser       Gives you a laser weapon with limited
                        range.  Having more of these increases
                        the range and the repeat rate of the
                        laser subsystem.

            Emergency Thrust
                        Gives you a limited amount of super
                        thrusters, equivalent to a full comple-
                        ment of afterburners.  With a light ship
                        this is equivalent to hitting hyperspace
                        or warp factor 9.99.  Useful for stopping
                        quickly or running away fast from a
                        deadly encounter.  The extra thrust capa-
                        bility is toggled on and off by a seper-
                        ate key and can thus be saved, the amount
                        of time remaining is shown by a status
                        bar below the HUD.

            Autopilot   Gives you a hover capability.  When
                        engaged an `Autopilot' light will flash
                        above the HUD.  When engaged the autopi-
                        lot computer will bring the ship to a
                        hover by the quickest (perhaps not
                        safest) method possible.  It will then

                        leave you in a hover, unless in a strong
                        gravity field where your engines cannot
                        cope.  Useful for hovering next to a
                        refuel depot.

            Tractor Beam
                        Not to be confused with a transporter,
                        this enables you to push or pull the ship
                        you are currently locked onto.  The force
                        is mutual, and thus if your ship is
                        lighter than your target you will move
                        more towards him than him towards you.
                        Best used with heavy ships to pull then
                        push annoying players into walls.

            Emergency Shield
                        Gives you a limited amount of extra
                        shield power, which prevents any fuel
                        loss from shots, debri, player and wall
                        collisions, missiles, mines, etc.  While
                        in use, the ship can smash into walls at
                        any speed and angle without fear of being
                        killed.  The extra shield capability is
                        toggled on and off by a separate key and
                        can thus be saved, with the remaining
                        amount of extra shield power being saved
                        for later use.  Once toggled on, the
                        extra shield power will take effect and
                        be used only while the normal shields are
                        up.  Best used when confronted with clus-
                        ter mines and missles or deadly cannons.

CONTROLS
       The game understands quite some keys, but not all of them
       are equally important.  The following keys are more or
       less sorted by importance.  The name of the keys are also
       the Xresources you use to redefine them, and the words
       inside the curly braces {} are their default bindings.
       See Xresources section below.

         Primary keys
             The primary keys are:

              keyTurnLeft {a}
                          Turn left (anti-clockwise).

              keyTurnRight {s}
                          Turn right (clockwise).

              keyThrust {right Shift or left Shift}
                          Thrust me.

              keyShield {space or Caps Lock}
                          Raise shield.  Must be held down for
                          continuous use.

              keyRefuel {f or left Ctrl or right Ctrl}
                          Try to connect to nearest fuel station.
                          Must be held down during refueling.

              keyRepair {f}
                          Repair a target.

         Secondary keys
             The following commands are not always available,
             some require bonus items to have any functionality
             at all.

              keySelfDestruct {q}
                          Self destruct.  At last we managed to

              keyIdMode {u}
                          Toggle the ID mode.  Instead of the
                          score list it will display the list of
                          players with their real names and com-
                          puter addresses.

              keyCloak {BackSpace or Delete}
                          Enable/disable cloaking device if
                          available.  You will be invisible on
                          both radar and on screen, but beware -
                          the device is not foolproof, it is not
                          cheap on your fuel and the only thing
                          becoming invisible is your ship, i.e.
                          the exhaust-flames will still be visi-
                          ble.

              keySwapSettings {Escape}
                          Toggle between two different settings.
                          You'll probably want more power and a
                          larger turn rate in combat than when
                          you're doing some critical maneuvering.

              keyDropMine {Tab}
                          Drop a proximity mine.  The mine will
                          detonate after a certain amount of time
                          (quite large actually) or when a foe
                          comes too near.

                          Detonate the mine you have dropped or
                          thrown, which is closest to you.

              keyEcm {bracketleft}
                          Fire an ECM pulse.

              keyChangeHome {Home or h}
                          Change home base.  You will need to be
                          landed on the base of your choice.
                          (The Home key is located just right of
                          the Return key on most HP-keyboards.)
                          These keys are convenient for HP key-

              keyTankNext {e}
                          If you have additional tanks, the cur-

                          Detach the current tank (or the last
                          additional tank).  Heat-seeking mis-

                          cannot rejoin the game until the P has
                          stopped blinking (to prevent users from

                          Fires a laser weapon in the direction
                          you are pointing.  Lasers have limited
                          range and use a lot of fuel, but they
                          are instantaneous and therefore much
                          more deadly than normal shots.  The
                          precise electronics of lasers can be
                          irretrivially damaged by the high

                          or four or more mines to launch a
                          nuclear missile or mine, and perhaps
                          enough fuel as well.  If you do not a
                          message will be displayed at the bottom

                          weapon will not be fired.

                          Firing a full (or fusion) nuclear
                          weapon completely depletes your stock
                          of that weapon, limited nuclear weapons

                          A nuclear missile or mine fired will
                          have a mass and explosive power equal

                          explode violently (this may freeze the
                          server momentarily).  After firing a
                          one off nuclear weapon, the `n' indica-

                               debris, which may kill or deplete
                               shields just like a normal shot
                               fired by your self.   Thus, since
                               cluster debris is deadly to your-
                               self, you should be careful when
                               firing such a weapon.  After fir-

                               using your cannon, and thus large
                               cluster explosions will use large
                               amounts of fuel.  If you do not
                               have enough fuel a message saying

X RESOURCES
       At startup xpilot will look for X resources in several
       places.  First it looks in the LIBDIR (as defined during
       compilation, mostly as something like
       /usr/local/games/xpilot/lib/) for the file named XPilot.
       After that it looks for more resources in
       /usr/lib/X11/$LANG/app-defaults/XPilot, $XUSERFILESEARCH-
       PATH/XPilot, $XAPPLRESDIR/$LANG/XPilot, $HOME/app-
       defaults/$LANG/XPilot, resources set using xrdb or else
       $HOME/.Xdefaults, host specific resources in the file
       pointed to by $XENVIRONMENT or else in $HOME/.Xdefaults-
       hostname and finally in $HOME/.xpilotrc.  If the LANG
       environment variable is undefined or if that file doesn't
       exist then it will look for the file as if LANG had been
       undefined.  Resources defined in files listed later will
       override resources in files listed earlier.  If the XPI-
       LOTRC environment variable is defined then its value is
       used instead of $HOME/.xpilotrc.  All of these resources
       can be overridden by their corresponding command line
       arguments.

            name        Nick name of your player.

            team        Preferred team number.

            port        Set the port number of the server.
                        Almost all servers use the default port,
                        which is the recommended policy.  You can
                        find out about which port is used by a
                        server by querying the XPilot Meta
                        server.

            power       Primary power setting of your engine.
                        Primary in this context means that it is
                        part of the default setting, secondary
                        means the other setting (two different
                        settings are available, pressing Esc will
                        switch between them).  You may change
                        "sensitivity" of your ship by adjusting
                        these parameters.  Often you would like
                        one setting to be more "rough" than the
                        other - one setting for fine maneuvering
                        and one for racing. (Default 45.0)

            turnSpeed   Primary turnspeed setting of your ship.
                        (Default 30.0)

            turnResistance
                        Primary turnresistance setting of your
                        ship.  This value determines how fast

                                                               24

                        your ship will stop rotating, i.e. the
                        rotating speed of your ship is set equal
                        to itself multiplied by this value.
                        Obviously the value has to lie between

            shipShape   Define the ship shape to use.  Because
                        the argument to this option is rather
                        large (up to 500 bytes) the recommended
                        way to set this option is in the .xpi-
                        lotrc file in your home directory.  The
                        exact format is defined in the file
                        README.ships in the XPilot distribution.
                        Note that there is a nifty tool called
                        editss for easy ship creation.  See the
                        XPilot FAQ for details.  See also the
                        shipShapeFile option.

            shipShapeFile
                        An optional file where shipshapes can be
                        stored.  If this resource is defined and
                        it refers to an existing file then ship-
                        shapes can be referenced to by their
                        name.  For instance if you define ship-
                        ShapeFile to be /home/myself/.shipshapes
                        and this file contains one or more ship-
                        shapes then you can select the shipshape
                        by starting xpilot as:

                        xpilot -shipShape myshipshapename

                        Where "myshipshapename" should be the
                        "name:" or "NM:" of one of the shipshapes
                        defined in /home/myself/.shipshapes.
                        Each shipshape definition should be
                        defined on only one line.  All characters
                        up to the first left parenthesis are
                        ignored.

INVOCATION EXAMPLES
       The simplest invocation of the hand-shake program is to
       just type:

              xpilot

       This will force the program to search after a server on
       all the machines on your attached network.

       Say you know where the server is, and you don't want to be
       prompted (handy in scripts etc.), you may type for exam-
       ple:

              xpilot -join lglab08

              where lglab08 is the name of the host running the
              server.

       In the examples above your name would be your login name.
       Let's say you want to be really cool and your login name
       is gudmari, well - you're in loads of trouble if you don't
       know about the -name option;

              xpilot -name FireEater

       will fix the problem for you.

XPILOT

       If the client crashes, you will be without autorepeat on
       your keyboard.  To re-enable autorepeat, issue this com-
       mand:

              xset r

       Please also note that xpilot can be addictive, and stre-
       nous for both you and your keyboard.  We take no responsi-
       bility. :)

       There is a meta server running on meta.xpilot.org, port
       4400, into which all servers registers.  This way you can
       easily check if there are any servers running nearby.  To
       use it, try:

              telnet meta.xpilot.org 4400 help list

       Or:

              telnet meta.xpilot.org 4401

       If you experience any problems with `jerkiness', you
       should try to adjust the receiveWindowSize Xresource.  The
       problem may be that your X server can't display as fast as
       the XPilot server is generating new frame updates.  So
       another option is setting the number of frames for the
       server to a lower number or get a faster X display system
       :)

       The receiveWindowSize resource allows you to tune the
       buffering of frame updates a little.  When set to one then
       there is no buffering and xpilot will just read the next
       frame and display it.  When the display is slower than the
       XPilot server this may give all sorts of problems like
       lagging behind and lack of keyboard control.

       When you set receiveWindowSize to two then xpilot will
       always try to read a second frame from the network and if
       this succeeds it will discard the oldest frame.  A better
       number for receiveWindowSize is three which will discard
       the oldest frame out of three and therefore be less sub-
       ject to small changes in network delivery times.  If your
       display is fast enough and can keep up with rate at which
       the server is generating frames then specifying a value
       bigger than one will not result in dropping frames, but
       rather will it be a buffer for small changes in network
       performance and computer load.  The maximum value of
       receiveWindowSize is four.

                                                               32

XPILOT

ENVIRONMENT
       If XPILOTRC is set then its value is used instead of
       $HOME/.xpilotrc to find the file containing the XPilot
       resources.  XPILOTUSER and XPILOTHOST set the loginname
       and hostname as reported to the xpilots server.

AUTHORS
       XPilot was developed by Bjrn Stabell <bjoern@xpilot.org>
       and Ken Ronny Schouten <ken@xpilot.org> from the Univer-
       sity of Troms, and Bert Gsbers <bert@xpilot.org> from the
       University of Amsterdam.

BUG REPORTS
       The product is seemingly stable, so bug reports are highly
       appreciated.  Send email to xpilot@xpilot.org and we will
       see what we can do.  We merely ask that you remember to
       include the following information:

           +o The platforms the bug occurs on
           +o What kind of display you have (depth, color, type)
           +o Which Xresources you're using.
           +o The full version of XPilot, i.e., 3.6.1
           +o What the bug looks like (symptoms)
           +o When the bug usually occurs

       We would also like to receive changes you do to make the
       code compile on your machine (we would NOT like to receive
       the whole program translated to K&R C, keep it ANSI :) If
       you don't have an ANSI compiler, there are several utili-
       ties which may help you de-ANSI-fy the code (unproto,
       unprotoize etc), but a better solution will be to install
       the GNU C compiler on your system.
