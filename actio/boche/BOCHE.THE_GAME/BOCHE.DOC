This game was created using Avantage Software's Shoot-Em-Up
Construction Kit. A wonderful piece of software that lets people who
can't program to save themselves (me), pass on strange bits of weirdness
to obviously bored people (you). This game is PUBLIC DOMAIN, You may keep
it, copy it, play it, give it to friends (or enemies), mock it, or
erase it. If you own S.E.U.C.K. yourself, feel free to butcher it to
your ownliking. I only ask two things of you-
        
            1) Please include this Document with the program (Or      
             someone else may get blamed for creating it by mistake.)
            2) Please for heavens sake don't send me any money!  The  
             day people start paying for games like this is a sure sign
               that humanity has definitely lost it.

             Boche- The Game

 2 players may play (gotta have 2 joysticks)
 5 (count em) lives -
 movement in 6 directions, alas, you may only fire forward

 Right Mouse & fire (PAUSE)   Left mouse (RESTART)
 Left & Right Mouse buttons exits game
 Click on top/left of title screen to exit to workbench

The rules-

   The year is 1918, the world is torn apart in bloody conflict. I'm
pretty sure they called it World War 1.  You are an Allied fighter pilot
with a trusty Sopwith Camel (And 4 extras in case you get shot down).
You must fly 3 missions over extreme Nazi Nastiness, across the English
Channel, and land safely in Nebraska, oops I mean England. After each
Mission you get a Medal (Big Hairy Deal,right)
 Level 1: earns you the Military Cross
 Level 2: earns you the Croix De Guerre
 Level 3: earns you the Distinguished Service Order

Shoot anything that gets in your way. Nazi planes and other stuff is always
out to getcha. Even flocks of annoying birds want to send you spiraling
downward in a cloud of churning black smoke and fire, (can't you almost
picture it?).

You may fly over any ground target except for the dreaded WINDMILL.
I'll be the first to admit it looks nothing like a windmill but it kills
you all the same. Be on the lookout for RAF Paratroopers, Rescue them
for extra points. Those little colored blips on the ground that in no
way resemble infantry soldiers, are infantry soldiers. Good luck Flyboy.
