Dodgy Snail Game
----------------

Ever own a Master System?  Ever play the Secret Hidden snail game that some
versions of the MS Bios contained?  Well, this is an almost-conversion.  It
is the same game, but the levels are different, it is not as well programmed
(I had only bought Blitz a week or two before I wrote this) and there are
only 6 levels.

It is self-explanatory enough.  Just run it, and mess with the options.

You can make your own levels, if you are bored enough:

 - Draw the maze with DPaint/PPaint or similar;
 - Save the IFF in the "Mazes" draw as MazeXX.iff (replace XX with maze
   number);
 - Edit a file called MazeXX.dat (XX should be the same as above);
 - Type the 3-figure X co-ordinate of the finish, and press return.
 - Type the 3-figure Y co-ordinate of the finish, and press return.
 - Type a 1-figure value for the direction that the snail must be travelling
   when it hits the exit.  This is daft, but I was only a baby when I was
   writing this prog.  0=up, 1=down, 2=right, 3=left.
 - Save the text file.

And there you go!
