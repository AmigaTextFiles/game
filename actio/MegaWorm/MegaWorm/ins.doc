MEGAWORM
==========


LOADING
========

MegaWorm is meant to be run from the CLI.  To
run simply type 'MegaWorm' and press  Return.
All graphics and sounds are contained  within
the one file. The program  can  be  run  from
Workbench, however if you are using a 500+ it
must not have an icon. To  run  it  you  must
select 'Show - All files'  from  the  Windows
menu, click on its icon and then on 'OK' when
prompted for a command line.

OBJECT
========

The object of the game is to collect randomly
placed white pills by moving your worm around
the various levels without crashing into  the
walls, your body or another worm.  There  are
ten pills per level, each of  which  increase
the length of  your  worm.  There  are  fifty
levels ranging from very easy  (Level  1)  to
virtually impossible (Level 50).

EFFECTS
=======

Every so often a coloured pill will appear  -
These have different effects

according to the colour :


Light Green - Increases your  speed  for  ten
seconds.

Dark Green - Decreases  your  speed  for  ten
seconds.

Purple - Doubles the  length  of  your  worm.
Also  gives  points  according  to  your  new
length.

Pink - Halves the length of your worm.

Red - New Life.

Orange - Gives  points  for  moving  for  ten
seconds. Greater speed or higher level  means
more points.

Blue - Turns all worms blue for ten seconds.

Light Blue - Invunerability for ten  seconds.
Allows you to travel through all  blue  walls
including the sides of the screen.

Yellow - Reverses the controls of  the  other
player for ten  seconds.  Only  appears  when
there are two players  on  screen.  Does  not
affect the computer player.

Grey - Switches off  the  lights  for  twenty
seconds.


CONTROLS
========

The worms  can  be  controlled  using  either
joystick or keys. The keys are as follows :

DIRECTION    PLAYER 1        PLAYER 2

UP           'G'           Up arrow
DOWN         'V'           Down arrow
RIGHT        'X'           Right arrow
LEFT         'Z'           Left arrow

At any time the fire button may  be  replaced
by pressing the 'Space Bar' however it is not
used during the game.

Other controls :

'S' -  Turns  the  stars  in  the  background
on/off.

'F' - Turns the filter on/off.

'P' - Pauses the game. To contiue  press  'P'
again or fire on the joystick in port 2.

Esc - When pressed during play it  quits  the
game and  returns  to  the  main  menu.  When
pressed  at  the  main  menu  it  exits   the
program.

Note: Remember to  unplug  the  mouse  before
using keys for player two.

MENUS
=====

Most  of  the  menus  are  straight   forward
although some may need explaining :

If the one player option is chosen  the  next
menu has two options, SOLO MODE and  COMPUTER
HELP.  The  first  is  a  simple  one  player
option,  while  the  second  gives  you   the
advantage (?) of playing with  the  computer.
At first he may seem fairly good, although on
the later levels he  becomes  more  and  more
useless and starts getting in the way -  This
is to encourage you to play in solo mode  and
not let the computer do all the work.

The final menu asks you to choose your  speed
by pressing up or down.

The speeds range from 0  (Very  slow)  to  20
(Quite fast ...).

The default setting is 10.

After you have played  the  game  once  there
will be a third option on  the  main  menu  -
SAME  OPTIONS.  When  chosen  this  will  use
exactly the same settings as in the  previous
game i.e. Same number of  players  (Same  one
player option), Same starting level  and  the
same speed.

PASSWORDS
=========

Every few levels a password will be  given  -
they become more frequent the further  on  in
the game you progress. These can be  used  to
allow you to start further  on  in  the  game
rather than at level  one.  Some  people  may
notice  a  slight  connection   between   the
passwords - possibly, this is  deliberate  to
allow other people with good taste the chance
of guessing the other passwords.

HIGH SCORES
===========

The high score table is shown at the  end  of
every game and if the computer  is  left  for
while on the main menu.  When  entering  your
name simply type it and  press  return.  (You
can type up to eight characters).

SCORING
=======

Points are given for collecting  white  pills
and some coloured pills. The number of points
given for a white pill depends  on  how  many
you have previously collected on  that  level
and the level you are on. e.g.

10 points for collecting the  first  pill  on
level one.

100 points for collecting the  last  pill  on
level one.

5000 points for collecting the last  pill  on
level fifty.

Collecting an  orange  pill  gives  you  your
current level in points every time  you  move
one space. e.g. On level 25 you get 25 points
every time you move. The faster you are going
the more points you get.

A purple pill doubles your  length  and  also
gives  you  points  depending  on  your   new
length. Number of dots in your worm =  Number
of points given.

A new life  is  given  for  reaching  various
scores  starting   at   5000   points.   This
continually doubles therefore the  next  life
is given at 10000 then 20000 and so on.

FINALLY ...
===========

MegaWorm  was  written  in  assembler   using
DevPac v3 on an Amiga  500+.  It  is  not  an
original game as you probably know,  although
some of the effects and most  of  the  levels
are. If you find any bugs, can think  of  any
way of improving the game or  you  just  feel
like  sending  me  some  money  it  would  be
greatly appreciated -  Let  me  know  if  you
finish it, I've been stuck on level fifty for
weeks!. Write to :

P.S. Thanks to Thomas Young for  ILBM>RAW.  I
never felt like writing a similar program  so
I was pleased to find yours on the coverdisk.
