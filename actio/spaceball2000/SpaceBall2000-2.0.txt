SpaceBall2000 v2.0 - (C) DawnBringer 1991-2000 (September 2000)

This is a sub-game from an old space-adventure i worked on for 4 years
in the '90s. It's a tennis/pong/speedball cross. You're playing a
tournament of 5 turns with increasingly difficult computer opponents.

What's New in V2.0
-------------------
* Slightly polished gfx.
* 2 player mode and training mode.
* Sound routines replaced with the better AMCAF commands (AMOS)

Feedback appreciated...let's face it; game development on the classic
Amiga today is practically none-existent..and without feedback it will
be completly dead within months. (September 2000)
