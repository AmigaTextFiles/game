V1.1 - Oct. 16 2003

- This version fixes a timing bug, the
  game should run at correct speed now.


This is a MorphOS port of MadBomber which is
based on the original Kaboom!, a classic Atari2600
game that I used to enjoy playing.

The original MadBomber is from the Linux/Win32
environment and uses SDL plus several other
additional SDL based libraries.

To play just double click the icon and use your
mouse to navigate and catch the falling bombs
before they hit the bottom and explode!

Have fun :)
