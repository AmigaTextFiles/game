Type:         game/actio
Version:      1.01
Architecture: m68k-amigaos
Distribution: Aminet

After 20 years storage of my Amiga 500.
I switched it on and enthusiasm comes back. For this anniversary, 
I wrote a small game to warm up (more of a fast Joystick test).
This archive includes assembled game, used/created gfx/sfx and source code.
Game is runnable from CLI/WB and could copied to a bootable floppy disk.

-> Update (1.01)

Since several people asked for an online hiscore, I added 
a QR code generator. The generator is an extra program because 
generating a QR code on old systems is quite slow and 
is therefore not directly integrated into the game.

Note: 
 * Hiscore is saved after game exit (unprotect your floppy disk if used).
 * There is no hiscore file in this archive, old hiscores are automatically loaded.

Hiscore: https://goldmomo.org/php/spod/hiscore.php or
         http://goldmomo.de/php/spod/hiscore.php (no ssl)

Fixes:
  * hiscore/title switch
  * failed to write hiscore file at kick 1.2/1.3
