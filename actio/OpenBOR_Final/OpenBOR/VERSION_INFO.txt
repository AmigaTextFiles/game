ABOUT OpenBOR v3:
Beats of Rage is a freeware open source video game and moddable game engine made
by Senile Team (http://www.senileteam.com/beatsofrage.html) and inspired by
Sega and SNK game series. The term "moddable" means that the
program allows users to create their own content, and thus their own beat-'em-up
game, which is then called a "mod".
OpenBOR is the open source continuations of Beats of Rage and provides
additional functionality not available in the original Beats of Rage game.
OpenBOR is maintained by the LavaLit (http://LavaLit.com/).
