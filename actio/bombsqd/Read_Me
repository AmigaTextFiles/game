After the title screen, and the game
loads in. You will see the options:
    1.Start new game
    2.Continue old game
Pressing '2' loads in and lets you
continue playing an old saved game.
Pressing '1' starts a new game:

You will first be shown the:
'SKILL LEVEL' options screen.
Bomb squad, let's you play at
4 different skill levels.
Selecting easy, let's you fail to
disarm 12 bombs, before you lose
the game (kicked off the Bomb Squad).
Selecting medium, lets you fail to
disarn 8 bombs, hard=4, expert=1.

After selecting the skill level, you
will be shown the 'CHOOSE PLAYER FOR
MISSIONS' screen.

Here you simply choose your alter ego,
the one who does the dirty work.
After selecting the player, you will
be asked to give him a name.
Use your name, or whatever you want
to call him.
Simply type it in, and press RETURN
to enter it.

Next, you will be shown the Players
statistics screen. You will come back
to this screen often throughout the
game. It contains vital information
about your player, such as: rank,
missions completed, missions failed,
and the skill level your playing at.
Plus the options to: Save the current
game, Continue playing, and to Quit.

Your player starts out as rank:
  PRIVATE 3RD CLASS
After successfully completing 3
missions (disarming 3 bombs), he will
be given a higher rank:
  PRIVATE 2ND CLASS
Then:
  PRIVATE 1ST CLASS
  LIEUTENANT 3RD CLASS
  LIEUTENANT 2ND CLASS
  LIEUTENANT 1ST CLASS
  CAPTAIN 2ND CLASS
  CAPTAIN 1ST CLASS
  MAJOR
  MAJOR GENERAL

Your goal is to make it to:
  MAJOR GENERAL, then complete 3 more
missions, then you will be a GENERAL,
and will have won the game.

When you select 'Continue game', you
will be shown the address and a brief
description of the bomb location.
Then you will visit the bomb site.

Here is where you must work with
speed, and nerves of steel.
The bomb will be displayed in the
middle of the screen. On one part of
it, there will be a small white square.
This is the part you begin with.
Your Bomb Squad Computer will
automatically analyze the bomb for you,
and tell you what to do.
All you have to do, is to REMEMBER
what it tell's you.

To select your tools: 'PULLERS' or
'CUTTERS', move the mouse pointer, the
small grey square, over the words:
'PULLERS' or 'CUTTERS', depending on
which tool you want to use, and press
the left mouse button.
You current tool, will be displayed at
the top of the screen.

Follow the owrds of the computer exactly.
If it says to cut this first, then pull
this...etc
Choose the correct tool 'CUTTERS' to cut,
'PULLERS' to pull, then move the mouse
pointer over the correct part, and press
the left mouse button to cut or pull it.
-----------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------

Simply follow the on-screen instructions.
Save your game often, as your player moves
up in rank.
You should use a new formatted disk, as your
save game disk, it makes seeing your old game
files, much easier, and you will have room
to store tons of old games.

You never know how many parts a bomb will
have, it could be only 2, or it might be
7...
-----------------------------------------

When you, or if you make it to GENERAL,
you will have completed 30 missions!
