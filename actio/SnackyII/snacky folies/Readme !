This Amos Game has been written by Sylvain Zangiacomi in April 1994.

It has been successfully tested on 68000, 68020, OS 2.04, OS 1.3. It 
should run correctly on higher configurations.

The game :
You control a snake with joystick or keyboard, no problem. 
You can also redefine the keys as you want. P is pause !  By pressing
on fire, your snake changes, for 1 s, its body colour and you're allowed 
to touch a colour element of the screen except the border during this 
time. Sometime it can be usefull. Note that it runs just one time. It
reloads when you change level or loose a life.
Your lives are displayed at the bottom of the screen by @ symbol.
You change level when the number at the bottom of the screen is 0.

IMPORTANT:
Each level has a CODE written at the bottom rigth of the screen during
the game. Copy it on a sheet, and restart game at this level by entering
this code in the 'CODES' option of the menu. I hate boring games where
we must restart always at the begining to reach new levels !!!
  
That's all information you need, so enjoy it :-)
