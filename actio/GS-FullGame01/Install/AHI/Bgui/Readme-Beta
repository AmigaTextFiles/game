                                      BETA
                                      ----
This version of BGUI is BETA. It is only to be posted on authorized BGUI Web and
FTP  sites,  which  must  be maintained by a member of the BGUI mailing list and
directly linked from an official BGUI web page. This restriction  is  to  ensure
any defective version could be quickly replaced.

You  are allowed to distribute the library itself with your software, but do not
distribute the entire package. If very  serious  bugs  are  identified  in  this
version  after  release,  please  make  every  effort  to  wait  until  they are
corrected, or use an earlier version. It is undesirable to publically distribute
software in such form, for the reputation of BGUI and your software as well.

Distribution
------------
BGUI 41.x is freely distributable for the user of BGUI-based software.  Charging
a  user  extra money for the use of BGUI's features is specifically illegal. The
BGUI executable library is and always will be freeware.

BGUI 41.x is currently free for the developer. No licensing  fees  are  required
for  shareware  or  commercial  software.  If  you  have  a  large project under
development, you should try to keep in touch with me and test it with the latest
versions  of  the  library. Note that the lack of licensing fees applies only to
41.x and below, and I reserve the right to charge a small developer fee  in  the
future, although I will avoid it as long as financially possible.

Although  I have made BGUI an extremely unrestrictive environment to develop in,
here's a few things you should do, not because you have to, but out of courtesy:

1. Send me a copy or keyfile of your product.

2. Give some credit in the documentation.

3. If your product is successful and generates you money,  a  donation  of  some
sort  would  be  in  order.  I  will probably keep a list of contributors in the
documentation, so you can live in fame.

The source code is  currently not distributable.  If you obtained it, or part of
it, from me, do not redistribute it without my explicit permission.

History
-------
BGUI was originally developed by Jan van den Baard. I assumed development of  it
in early 1996. Although I've rewritten most of the actual code by now, Jan is to
forever be credited with creating an excellent balance of power and ease of  use
vs. speed and code size. The programming interface is also very good.
