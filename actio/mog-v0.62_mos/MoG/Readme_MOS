This is just a quick port to MorphOS from HAK (hak@vip.at).

For further instruction just take a look at the original Readme and/or visit
the original website at http://www.braingames.getput.com/mog/default.asp


PS: Due to problems with SDL_sound (which crashes when loading ogg-files that
are mono) I deactivated the background music.

PPS: I only included the "original" and "alternate" graphics/sound-directories
(otherwise the package would have been ~28 MBytes. However you can download
additional ones from the original homepage.
