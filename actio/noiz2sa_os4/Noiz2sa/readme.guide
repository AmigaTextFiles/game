@NODE REQU "Requirements"

The game requires AmigaOS 4.0 or higher. It has been compiled and tested on an AmigaOne XE G4@933 MHz running AmigaOS 4 with
Update 3, not tested with earlier versions of AmigaOs 4. Note that no 3D acceleration (via MiniGL or Warp3D) is required: the
original makefile links the opengl SDL library, but the sources don't make use of any of its functions, so I have removed this
link.

Joystick support requires AmigaInput.library v51 or better. Since v51 is at the moment available to AmigaOS betatesters only,
I've been not able to test it.

@{B}WARNING!@{UB}
When you'll start the game you'll notice a massive slowdown of the system. This seems to be related to SDL, I preferred to keep
this to make the game run as fast and smooth as possible.

@ENDNODE

@NODE INST "Installation"

Installation is simple: just copy all the files and drawers from the archive to any drawer on your hard disk.

To run the game, double click on the "Start Noiz2sa" icon. This will execute a script, which will make ther game run in
windowed mode with no output text.

@ENDNODE

@NODE COMM "Command line options"

These command line options are available only when the game is run from shell.

Usage: noiz2sa [-nosound] [-window] [-reverse] [-brightness n] [-nowait] [-accframe]
 -nosound       Don't use sound
 -window        Run in windowed mode. Recommended, as the fullscreen mode shows some slight graphical glitches
 -reverse       Switch between the fire key and the slowdown key
 -brightness n  Set the brightness of the screen (n = 0-256)
 -nowait        Don't slow down the game when too many bullets re on screen and when switching back from pause mode
 -accframe      Use the alternative framerate management algorithm (If you have problems with low framerate, try this option)

@ENDNODE

@NODE PLAY "How to play"

Select the stage using keyboard (or joystick).

Movement:      Arrow keys 
Fire:          Z       
Slowdown:      X
Pause/restart: P
Exit:          ESC

The "slowdown" key is used to slow down the movements of your ship, useful to have a more precise control when avoiding bullet.
Keep it pressed down whenever you need to slowdown.

Press the fire key to start the game. Autofire is switched on, so just keep pressed down the fire key! You can fly over the
enemies, your ship is vulnerable only to the enemy fire. Once destroyed, every enemy ship will leave a green object which, if
collected, will increase your score. A bonus ship every 200,000 and 500,000 points.

@ENDNODE

@NODE MODI "Modify game parameters"

You can add your own barrage patterns to Noiz2sa. In the 'noiz2sa' directory, there are 3 directories named 'zako', 'middle'
and 'boss', where barrage patterns files are placed. These files are written using BulletML language, for more informtion visit
the site:
http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/bulletml/index_e.html

The 'zako' directory is for small enemies, 'middle' for bigger ones, while 'boss' directory is for the boss-type enemies. You
can adjust the difficulty level of every barrage by setting the $rank variable.

@ENDNODE

@NODE COMP "How to compile"

In order to compile, you should have a full installation of the latest SDK. Just enter in the src/ directory, set an
appropriately high stack value (I use 500000 just to be on the safe side), and type 'make'. To delete all the compiled objects,
type 'make clean'. The sources are from the Linux' version and have been slightly modified, so they will probably only compile
on AmigaOS.

Don't use the latest SDL_mixer for OS4, it seems to have a bug which prevents the replay of ogg streams. I have linked against
SDL_mixer 1.24 with success.

AmigaOS 4 version:

2005 11/17  ver. 1.0
            Raised the audio buffer to 8192, no more sound lagging now
            Sound playback set to stereo instead of mono, since background music files are stereo
            Removed clipping on some of the audio files
            Fixed the hiscores loading/saving, looks like there was a bug which printed extra characters in the hiscores file,
            the format of the file has been changed so it can't be used with versions of the game for other platforms.

@ENDNODE

@NODE PROB "Known problems"

These are the known problems and bugs that I've found in this version, and that will hopefully fixed in the next ones.
If you have found any bug not listed here, contact me!

- Fullscreen mode shows some slight graphical glitches due to a problem with palette allocation. I've contacted the author of the SDL
library to see what could be the cause of this, I hope to fix this and release a new version, in the meanwhile I've kept the
fullscreen mode as some of you could not mind about these glitches.

- At startup there's a slight corruption of the graphics, which disappears shortly after.

- On my keyboard it's not possible to move and shoot at the same time when keeping down the slowdown key, might be related
to my keyboard.
