IDEAS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

The following ideas could be applied in later levels:

    Restore the spider's web that was scrapped from Night Stalker
    before its release.  See this paragraph from intellivisionlives.com:

	A new, tougher robot had to be added to the game, at the
	cost of losing one of the best features: the spider's web
	(the game was only 4K in size). Originally, as the spider
	crawled around the maze it left a web that would slow you
	down considerably as you ran through it. You could shoot
	the web away, but you'd use up bullets. Without the web,
	the spider became like the bats: just a nuisance.

    Bazookas to blast through walls.

    More mazes.

    Scrolling mazes.

    Tough robots: number of needed shots before death could become random.

    The gun could move.

    The gun could have more bullets, to counter the increasing powers
    of the robots.

    Hyperspace command (perhaps reserved for later levels) to allow
    the player to move at a random position, when desperate.

    Allow the player to pick up a disgusting object that could be
    thrown later to repel the enemies.

    Grenade to kill enemies over some distance.  Might even destroy
    parts of the walls.

    White and black robots could not go through each other.

    Big bullets kill blue and gray robots, and the animals.

    Allow the player to run faster in some conditions.  The player
    would get that energy by eating food that would walk through
    the maze occasionally.

    Allow the player to duck to avoid bullets, or to jump over them.

    Make the player move until a key (like space) is pressed, so that
    the user does not have to old down the arrow keys.  This could
    be selected as an option.

    Sometimes, a gun could appear even if the player still has
    some bullets left, and that gun could contain a lesser
    number of bullets.
