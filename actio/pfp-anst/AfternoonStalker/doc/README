This package is autoconfiscated.  See INSTALL for details.

A manual page is provided: afternoonstalker.6

The SDL, SDL_image and SDL_mixer libraries are required.
See <http://www.libsdl.org>.  The 'sdl-config' script, which comes
with the SDL development files, is expected to be in the PATH.

My 'flatzebra' library is also needed.  You can get it from the
Afternoon Stalker Home Page:

When a .wav file does not have the right characteristics (frequency,
mono/stereo, etc), the sox(1) command can be used to convert .wav
files to a specific format.  In this example, the desired format
is 11025 hertz, 1 channel (mono), byte-sized samples and unsigned
linear encoding:

  sox original.wav -r 11025 -c 1 -b -u converted.wav

See the sox(1) manual page for details.
