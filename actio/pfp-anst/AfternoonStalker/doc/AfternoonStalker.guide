@node sect2 "Description"
@{b}afternoonstalker@{ub} is a clone of the Intellivision game Night Stalker.  You are in a two-dimensional maze in which you are attacked by robots that shoot at you and that you must shoot down.  You must pick up a gun somewhere in the maze in order to have a few bullets to shoot. Avoid the spiders and the bats, which can paralyze you long enough for a robot to come and shoot you.  The bunker in the center is your only protection. 

Use the @{b}arrow keys@{ub} to move and the @{b}Ctrl@{ub} key to shoot in the direction you last walked. You can also shoot in a fixed direction with the @{b}H@{ub} (left), @{b}J@{ub} (down), @{b}K@{ub} (up) and @{b}L@{ub} (right) keys (this is the same convention as in @{b}vi@{ub}). Use the @{b}P@{ub} key to pause the game, and to resume it afterwards. The @{b}Escape@{ub} key quits the program.

High scores are not remembered. No attempt was made to emulate the exact behavior of the enemies in the original game. The bats do not sleep. 

The game may be either too easy or too difficult.  You choose.
