Version 1.1.1 - 2004-05-02

Version 1.1.0 - 2003-06-02

    Adapted for the flatzebra library, the successor of gengameng.

    When requested direction is impossible, last moving direction is
    attempted.  This can be useful to turn corners automatically.

    New feature not in the original Night Stalker game: a time bomb
    occasionally appears.  The player can pick it up, lay it and
    then move away.  The explosion comes 3 seconds later and kills
    all enemies touched by the explosion.  The player can also be
    killed however.

    Robots and animals now introduced at intervals of random length,
    to decrease predictability.

    New .desktop file adapted to Desktop Menu Specification.

    Autoconf macro used to avoid GNU getopt code when compiling on
    BSD-like systems.

    When the sound device is not available, the program does not quit.

    New --set-file option to specify an alternative set description file.
    (the default is level1.set).

Version 1.0.3 - 2003-02-13

    The player can now shoot in a fixed direction with the H (left),
    J (down), K (up) and L (right) keys (same convention as in vi).
    New --only-blue option provides a practice mode where only
    blue robots are sent out.
    Sound mixer should handle more simulatenous sounds correctly.
