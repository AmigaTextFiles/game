  WELL, TELL ME WHAT IS IT?
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  It's a violent game of life and death at the gladiator-arena.
  Both of the muscular barbarians have same goal: Kill your opponent!!
  There's an energybar at top of screen. When it reaches zero, the
  unlucky gladiator dies. So watch out!

  HOW I CONTROL 'EM?
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Control your man with joystick or keys. Playing with joystick is
  easy and you surely know what that red button located in your
  joystick does, right? Player two is using keyboard. The arrow-keys
  will move the gladiator and Right-Alt sweeps the sword.
