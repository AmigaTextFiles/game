       A thoroughly tasteless game by Christian Graus.



      If, like most people you loaded the game before the docs you will
      notice a splodgy shape appearing beneath you when you fire.  What
      is it and why does it explode ?

      Well, with all due apologies to ELSPA, I'm afraid it's vomit, radio-
      active vomit from the mouths of a radioactive frog.  You see, our 
      friends live next to a nuclear waste dump, and they're not well at
      all.  Each time they vomit they have a few seconds to get out of the
      way before it explodes, blowing up swamp, octopuses, frogs and anything  
      else in the way.

      The idea of the game then is to blow a path to your opponent and spew
      him out of existance.  To help you do this some swamp has bonuses under
      it that will be revealed when it blows up.  They can be blown up, so
      grab 'em while you can !!  The little vomit with a + sign adds to the
      number of vomits you can have on screen at once.  Note if an exploding
      hurl blows into another chuck it will go off as well, creating a chain
      effect.  The little vomit with a P adds one to the blow range of each
      spew.

      It's not all easy though.  You can't jump over spew, so you can trap
      yourself.  Also if an octopus touches you, you will die.  At the top
      of the screen you can see how many lives you have left.  If there are
      no little frogs on your side, you have one life left.  If a player dies
      and the other player dies while the first is sinking into the swamp then
      neither of you loses a man.  

      When a life or game is lost you will be transported to a graveyard to
      see the winner jumping for joy on his opponents grave.  For the life lost
      routine the computer plays 'Another One Bites the Dust' by Queen.  I have
      used this because it is instantly recognisable and I hoped it had a 
      comedic effect.  I hope I haven't broken any copyright, if I have just 
      copy 'DM.sng' over 'ABTD.sng' in the DATA draw.

      Naturally we hear the death march at the end of a game.  In both these
      situations, only the winning player can speed things up by pressing fire
      so you don't lose any gloating time.  
  
      Pressing ESC during gameplay will restart, and Q from the title page will
      quit.  Hop & Hurl also detects if you have an A1200, and if so doubles the
      no. of octopus as it can handle the speed.

      Speaking of speed, if the game is too fast for you, type in I'm from the 
      country on the title page, with no spaces, and it will slow down.  To go
      back to fast mode, type I'm from the city.  Remember to use no spaces or
      punctuation.  If you've done it right you will hear a vomit, and the title
      tune will re-start.  It doesnt matter if you type it in lower or upper
      case.

      Unfortunately, quitting on an Amiga with less than two meg will freeze the 
      machine, due to the Amiga being unable to free the memory H&H uses.  Sorry.
 
      Happy Hurling !!

      Hop & Hurl was written in Blitz Basic II v1.8 by Christian Graus.
      As I cannot draw the Frog, Lilypad, Octopus and Fish shapes are from Amos.
      The moon and clouds are also from Amos and the Rip was originally clipart.
      I drew the spew ( I'm also a poet ), the titles and the powerups, etc.
      All drawing and converting of shape colours etc was done with DPaint IV
      I created the music using OctaMed v4 ( see above )
      Thank you to the Floppy Shop in Hobart for use of an A1200 to test H&H.
