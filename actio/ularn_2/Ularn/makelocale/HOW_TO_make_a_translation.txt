    How to make a translation
    -------------------------

    Translating a game is not as easy like to translate another program. In
    a  game  like  Ularn  especially  words  are  not  translateable,  like
    especially names of Monsters.

    It's up to you, if you find another good name in your language,  or  if
    you use the english name.

    ex.:
    "Xorn" - a big, aggressive and dangerous monster
             with a star as the head. In German no translation is possible,
             so I use 'Xorn' in the german catalog.

    Also a especially difficulty is the english word "the" ...

    I also translated some strings by this,  what  it  means,  not  by  the
    words, because it is more understandable in german.


    So ... to the "technicals":

    1. The file in which you make your translation is the

       ularn_locale.ct  (catalog translation)

    2. In the file

       ularn_locale.cd  (catalog descriptor)

       you  find  only  informations,  especially,  how  many   chars   the
       translated string can contain.

       NEVER EVER alter anywhat in this file -
       otherwise Ularn can't read your created translation -
       you are warned ... ;-)

       ex.:

       msg_0 (0//22)
       Save & Exit
       ;

       means:

       The translation of the string "Save & Exit" can contain a maximun of
       22 chars.

       So I've made the german translation to:

       Sichern & Exit

       These are 14 chars.

    3. In the file ularn_locale.ct:

       - a line, that starts with a ';'-sign  is  a  comment  and  will  be
         ignored

       - NEVER EVER touch the line

         ## version $VER: ularn.catalog 1.0 (18.02.05)

         otherwise Ularn can't load the created catalog

       - in the line

         ## language deutsch

         Replace the word 'deutsch' with your language. This is  the  name,
         which  the locale.library is using for the language-directories in
         the

         LOCALE:Catalogs/ directory.

         In MorphOS this is casesensitive !

     4.The program 'CComp' is the translator for the catalog.

       The best is to copy it to your C:-directory first, so  you  avoid,
       that the system can't find it.

       I have made a small script-file: 'CatTrans'

       ##################################################################

       CComp ularn_locale.cd ularn_locale.ct LOCALE:Catalogs/deutsch/ularn.catalog
       wait 1 sec
       C:avail flush

       ##################################################################

       It starts only from the Shell(CLI). Before you must 'cd'  to  your
       translation-directory  (the  directory  in which the *.ct and *.cd
       files are located.

       Alter the destination dir 'deutsch' to your language.

       The 'CatTrans' not only starts  the  translation,  it  places  the
       catalog   immediately   to   the  right  place,  and  flushes  the
       (eventually) previous used catalog from memory.

       So you should always  leave  Ularn  before  you  start  'CatTrans'
       during your Translation-Test phase.

     5.Translate also the Uhelp-file in the lib-directory.

       !ATTENTION!

       There  is  a  special  sign  at  the  first  beginning.   In   the
       english-version this is a ';'.

       With the help of this sign Ularn calculates the number of pages of
       the  'Help'  in  the game. So this sign MUST BE present. Otherwise
       the 'Help' is not visible.

       For this the ASCII-code-number of this  sign  substracted  by  the
       ASCII-code  of  '0'  results  in  the total number of pages of the
       'Help' in the game.

       In the english-version:

       59(';') - 48('0') = 11 pages

       Here a part of the ASCII-table, which maybe useful for you.

       Sign   ASCII-code(decimal)    total pages
       -----------------------------------------

       0      48                      0
       1      49                      1
       2      50                      2
       3      51                      3
       4      52                      4
       5      53                      5
       6      54                      6
       7      55                      7
       8      56                      8
       9      57                      9
       :      58                     10
       ;      59                     11
       <      60                     12
       =      61                     13
       >      62                     14
       ?      63                     15
       @      64                     16
       A      65                     17
       B      66                     18
       C      67                     19
       D      68                     20
       E      69                     21
       F      70                     22

       How many pages  are  neccessary  for  your  translation,  you  may
       discover by using the "Help"-function in the game.

       Count the pages while repeatly press 'space'. If you  are  not  at
       the  end  of  your translated helpfile, when the last page occures
       (no more " Press 'space' ..." is visible), increase step  by  step
       the calculated page number.

       For this, replacing the first sign in the Uhelp-file by  the  next
       in the ASCII-table will increase by one page ... ans so on.

    6. Translating the 'gfx_guide.txt' is not neccessary, because it is a
       information  only  for  GFX-freaks,  which  want  to  make  a  new
       'ularn_gfx.iff'.

    7. Translate also the "Ufortune". These are the hidden messages inside
       the fortune-cookies, which are readable, when you eat one.
