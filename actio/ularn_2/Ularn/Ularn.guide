@node INTRODUCTION "Introduction"

    Welcome to the game of Ularn. At this moment, you face a great problem.
    Your  daughter  has  contracted a strange disease and none of your home
    remedies seems to have any effect. You sense  that  she  is  in  mortal
    danger  and  you  must try to save her. Time ago you heard of a land of
    great danger and opportunity. Perhaps here is the solution you need.

    It has been said that there  once  was  a  great  magician  who  called
    himself  Polinneaus.  Many  years  ago,  after  having  many miraculous
    successes, Polinneaus retired to the caverns of Ularn, where he devoted
    most  of his time to the creation of magic. Rumors have it that one day
    Polinneaus set out to  dispel  an  attacking  army  in  a  forest  some
    distance to the north. It is believed that there he met his demise.

    The caverns of Ularn, it is thought, must be magnificent in design  and
    contain  much magic and treasure. One option you have is to undertake a
    journey into these caverns.


    Good Luck!  (You're going to need it.)

    When dropping gold, if you type '*' as your amount, all your gold  gets
    dropped.  In  general,  typing in '*' means all of what your interested
    in. This is true when  visiting  the  bank,  or  when  contributing  at
    altars.

    When in the store, trading post, school, or home, an <escape> will  get
    you out.

    When casting a spell, if you need a list of spells you can  cast,  type
    'D'  as  the  first  letter of your spell. The available list of spells
    will be shown, after which you may enter  the  spell  code.  This  only
    works on the 1st letter of the spell you are casting. You may also type
    '\' at any time - this will show all the spells you know,  as  well  as
    all the potions and scrolls you have encountered and identified so far.

@node OPTFILE "opt-File"


                   @{b}@{u}How to use the ularn.opt option file@{uu}@{ub}

    The file "ularn.opt", if used, should be  in  your  home  directory  or
    specified on the command line (see -o).

    With this file you can accellerate the startup of Ularn.  If  you  (for
    example)  give  your Ularn-name in this file, Ularn starts up direct to
    the position, where you previous leaved it with "Save & Exit".

    Lines in the options file starting with a  '#'  are  comments  and  are
    ignored.  Game  options  are  specified with the word 'OPTION=' and are
    followed by a comma separated list of options  (Multiple  option  lines
    are allowed).

    Options to enable features may be prefixed  with  no  to  disable  that
    feature. Options that specify a value are in the form:

        <option word>:<value>.

      @{u}Option word             Meaning                                      @{uu}

      (no)welcome             dis/enable display of intro message

      (no)nap                 eliminate/use delays when playing game

      (no)enhanced_interface  dis/enable enhanced interface

      (no)beep                dis/enable beeps during game

      name:<name>             set the players name to <name>

      class:<class>           play a character of <class>
                              (the name of the class)

      gender:<male/female>    specify the gender of the characeter

    Some path names used by the game can also be specified in  the  options
    file.

      LIBDIR:<location of the lib directory>
      SAVEDIR:<location of the directory to hold saved games>

    If these are not specified then games will  be  saved  in  the  current
    directory and the game will look in ./lib for the library files.


# Example ularn options file

# Set character data here

# nap/nonap - add time delays

@node SCOREBOARD "Scoreboard"



               @{b}@{u}Explanation of the Ularn scoreboard facility@{uu}@{ub}

    Ularn supports TWO scoreboards, one for winners, and one  for  deceased
    characters.  Each player is allowed one slot on each scoreboard, if the
    score is in the top ten for that scoreboard.

    This design helps ensure that frequent players of Ularn do not hog  the
    scoreboard  and  gives  more  players  a  chance  for  glory.  Level of
    difficulty is also noted on the scoreboards and this  takes  precedence
    over score for determining what entry is on the scoreboard.

    For example: if "Satyr, the Ularn God" has a score  of  128003  on  the
    scoreboard at diff 0, then his game at diff 1 and a score of 4112 would
    replace his previous entry on the scoreboard. Note that when  a  player
    dies,  his  inventory  is stored in the scoreboard so that everyone can
    see what items the player had at the time of his death.

    First: Besides the other enhancements, this guide was made new by me:

    URL: www.alfred-j-faust.de

    I'm a german men, and I hope you can understand, what I've written.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    User selected Screenmode and Font are saved within the ularn.prefs file
    in the lib-directory.

    If Ularn starts at the first time, a message  appears,  that  no  valid
    prefs file was found, and you are prompted to choose a Screenmode and a
    Screenfont. After choosing they are immediate saved to the  ularn.prefs
    file in the lib directory.
    Now you never will be prompted for a Screenmode or a Font.

    Nevertheless, both, Screenmode and Font are user-selectable during  the
    game is running from the new:

    @{b}Prefs Menu@{ub}


    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Additional Menu-keys (together with right AMIGA)

    D   -   Show Discoveries
    I   -   Show Inventory
    T   -   Show Tax
    W   -   Show Pack Weight

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ularn is now localized. That means  it  maybe  available  in  different
    languages.

    I've made a german translation. You may find the files in the  "german"
    directory. Read the install.txt there.

    If you want to make a own translation to another language  see  in  the
    "makelocale" dir. You find all, what you need there.
    Careful read the "HOW_TO_make_a_translation.txt".

@node EINLEITUNG "Einleitung"

    Willkommen beim Spiel Ularn. Du hast  im  Moment  ein  großes  Problem.
    Deine  Tochter  ist  sehr  krank  geworden,  und  keins  der  bekannten
    Hausmittel kann ihr helfen.  Du  erkennst,  dass  sie  in  Lebensgefahr
    schwebt,  und  du alles versuchen mußt, sie zu retten. Vor einiger Zeit
    hast du von einem Land großer Gefahren und Möglichkeiten  gehört,  dass
    dort die Lösung deines Problems liegt.

    Es wurde davon erzählt, dass dort einmal ein großer Zauberer  war,  der
    sich  selbst Polinneus nannte. Nach vielen Erfolgen in seiner Zauberei,
    hat sich Polineus in die Höhlen von Ularn  zurückgezogen,  und  ersinnt
    dort  mancherlei  Neues  in  der  Magie. Gerüchten zufolge hat Polineus
    sogar eine angreifende Armee in den nördlichen Wäldern  verzaubert.  Es
    scheint sicher, dass er nun seine wahre Bestimmung gefunden hat.

    Die Höhlen von Ularn, so hört man, sind  großartig  gemacht,  und  dort
    kann man viel Zauberei und viele Schätze finden.

    Deine letzte Möglichkeiten liegt dort unten ... ,
    wenn du in diese Höhlen hinuntersteigst ....


            VIEL GLÜCK!

@node ULARNOPT "Das ularn.opt File"

                   @{b}@{u}Die Benutzung des ularn.opt Optionfiles@{uu}@{ub}

    Das File "ularn.opt" ist nicht zwingend erforderlich,  man  kann  damit
    aber  einige  Startoptionen  von  Ularn  festlegen. Wenn man darin z.B.
    seinen Ularn-Namen angibt, dann started Ularn direkt an der Stelle,  an
    der man vorher mit "Sichern & Exit" Ularn verlassen hat.

    Das File wird von Ularn beim Start im Programmverzeichnis  gesucht,  es
    sei den man gibt mit

        ularn -o <[Pfad]filename>

    ein anderes Optionsfile an.

    Zeilen mit einem '#' am Anfang sind Kommentare und werden ignoriert. Am
    Beginn  der  Options-Zeile  steht  'OPTION='.  Dann folgen durch Kommas
    getrennt die einzelnen Optionen,  oder  jede  Option  hat  eine  eigene
    Zeile.

    Beispiel:

-------------- ularn.opt .... hier schneiden ----------------
# das ist ein Kommentar
# das ist ein Kommentar - solche Zeilen können beliebig oft erscheinen
OPTION=nowelcome,nonap,noenhanced_interface

-------------- ularn.opt .... hier schneiden ----------------

    Das ganze könnte auch so aussehen:


-------------- ularn.opt .... hier schneiden ----------------
# das ist ein Kommentar
# das ist ein Kommentar - solche Zeilen können beliebig oft erscheinen
OPTION=nowelcome
OPTION=nonap
OPTION=noenhanced_interface

-------------- ularn.opt .... hier schneiden ----------------

    Die Vorsilbe 'no' unterdrückt eine Option.

    Beispiel:

#mit Wilkommensbildschirm starten
OPTION=welcome

#ohne Wilkommensbildschirm starten
OPTION=nowelcome

Optionen, die einen Wert brauchen haben das Format:
OPTION=<option word>:<value>.

Beispiel:
#startet immer den Spieler 'Heinz'
OPTION=name:Heinz


  @{b}@{u}Optionswort             Bedeutung                                        @{uu}@{ub}

  (no)welcome             ohne/mit Willkommensbildschirm starten
  (no)nap                 ohne/mit Verzögerungen spielen
  (no)enhanced_interface  ohne/mit erweitertem Interface
  (no)beep                ohne/mit Blidschirmblitzen spielen
  name:<name>             Spieler <name> starten
  class:<class>           mit Character <class> starten (Klingone, Hexer usw.)
  gender:<male/female>    legt das geschlecht des Charakters fest
                          male=männlich; female=weiblich

    Einige Pfade können auch im File "ularn.opt" festgelegt werden:

      LIBDIR:<Pfad zum 'lib' Verzeichnis>
      SAVEDIR:<Pfad zum Verzeichnis, wo Spiele gespeichert werden sollen>

    (Die Verzeichnispfade müssen gültig sein, d.h. die Verzeichnisse müssen
    vorhanden sein.)

    Wenn diese  beiden  Pfade  NICHT  angegeben  werden,  sucht  Ularn  das
    'lib'-Verzeichnis  im  Programmverzeichnis,  und  speichert  die Spiele
    ebenfalls im Programmverzeichnis.

    Beispiel eines ularn.opt Files

#
# Charakter-Daten
#
OPTION=name:Fred,gender:male
# keine Verzögerungen
OPTION=nap
# Willkommensbildschirm anzeigen
OPTION=welcome
# kein erweitertes Interface
OPTION=noenhanced_interface
# kein Bldschirmblitzen während des Spieles.
OPTION=beep

@node BESTENLISTE "Ularns Bestenliste"

             @{b}@{u}Erklärung der Möglichkeiten der Ularn Bestenliste@{uu}@{ub}


    Ularn hat eigentlich 2 Bestenlisten, eine für die Gewinner und eine für
    die getöteten Spieler.

    Jeder Spieler wird nur einmal in die TOP 10 aufgenommen, das vermeidet,
    das  Spieler,  die  öfter  das  Spiel  benutzen,  die ganze Bestenliste
    ausfüllen, und sie somit für andere blockieren.

    Der Schwierigkeitslevel ist auch in der Bestenliste eingetragen und hat
    Vorrang vor allen anderen Eintragungen.

    z.B.: wenn "Satyr, der Gott Ularns" einen  Stand  von  128003  mit  dem
    Schwierig-keitslevel von 0 in der Bestenliste hat, dann würde ein Spiel
    mit 4112 im Schwierigkeitslevel  1  höher  bewertet,  und  ersetzt  den
    vorigen Eintrag.

    Wenn ein Spieler stirbt, wird auch seine gesamte Bestandsliste  in  der
    Bestenliste  mitgespeichert.  So  kann dann jeder andere sehen, was der
    "Verstorbene" zum Zeitpunkt seines Todes alles besessen hatte.

@node ERWEITERUNGEN "MorpOS Erweiterungen"

    Zuerst:
    neben den anderen Erweiterungen habe ich diese Amiga-Guide geschrieben.

    Alfred Faust
    email: alfred.j.faust@gmx.de
    URL: www.alfred-j-faust.de

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Der vom Spieler gewählte Bildschirmmodus und der  Font  werden  in  dem
    File: ularn.prefs im lib-Verzeichnis gespeichert. So müssen diese nicht
    bei jedem Spielstart neu gewählt werden.

    Wenn Ularn das erste mal gestartet wird, gibt es eine Meldung, dass das
    ularn.prefs  File  nicht gefunden wurde. Das ist Absicht, diese Meldung
    tritt erst dann wieder auf, wenn man das File  löscht,  oder  es  einen
    Fehler hat.

    Danach wird man aufgefordert einen Bildschirmmodus und  einen  Font  zu
    wählen.  Diese  werden  sofort abgespeichert, der Spieler muß das nicht
    extra machen.

    Ist man dann aber dennoch unzufrieden mit dem gewählen  Bildschirmmodus
    oder  dem  gewählten Font, kann man diese auch noch während des Spieles
    in dem neuen Menu:

    @{b}@{u}Prefs@{uu}@{ub}

    verändern. Auch dort werden die Änderungen automatisch abgespeichert.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    @{b}@{u}Zusätzliche Menu-Hotkeys@{uu}@{ub} (zusammen mit recher AMIGA-Taste)

    D   -   Zeigt alle gemachten Entdeckungen
    I   -   Zeigt die Bestandsliste (was man im Gepäck hat)
    T   -   Zeigt eventuelle Steuerschulden
    W   -   Zeigt das Gesamtgewicht des Gepäcks an

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------


    @{b}@{u}Ularn ist nun lokalisiert.@{uu}@{ub}

    Das heißt, dass Ularn in verschiedene Sprachen übersetzt werden kann.

    Ich habe (wen wundert's?) eine deutsche Übersetzung gemacht. Dafür gibt
    es  einen  Unterordner  "german",  der eigentlich nur zu Installations-
    zwecken da ist. Bitte den "install.txt" lesen.

    Falls du eine eigene oder  andere  Übersetzung(andere  Sprache)  machen
    willst,  dann  schau bitte im Verzeichnis "makelocale" nach. Du findest
    dort alles erforderliche Material.

    Bitte lies dir auch  die  Datei  "HOW_TO_make_a_translation.txt"  genau
    durch.
