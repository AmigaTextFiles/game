Wingnuts was developed over a period of 18 months as a full-priced retail game,
and resulted in a number of nervous breakdowns amongst our development team
before it was completed. However in order to reach as large a player audience
as possible we have now decided to release it as Shareware, and would like to
see it freely distributed by whatever means possible. Pass it on to your
friends, dog, parole officer...whoever.


Wingnuts is Shareware - if you play this game and like it, a small payment would
be most appreciated.

The recommended fee is £5.

Payment should be made by cheque (in Pounds Sterling, drawn on a UK bank),
Postal Order, or International Money Order, to the address below. Cash may also
be sent. Cheques etc. should be made payable to Colin Philpott.
