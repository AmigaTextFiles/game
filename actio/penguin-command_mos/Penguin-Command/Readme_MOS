MorphOS requirements:
- MorphOS 1.4.x
- powersdl 11.4
- powersdl_image 8.2
- powersdl_mixer 8.4

Having the most recent powersdl_mixer.library is important, because there
were bugs with S3M music in previous releases. There are still problems
in powersdl_mixer, leading to some instability, which will hopefully be
fixed in the future.
