## About

This fan-made 16-bit-style 2D puzzle-platformer is a modern reimagining of the 
classic game from the Atari and C64 era. More than just a remake, it stands as 
a heartfelt tribute to the creators of the original character from the iconic 
TV series 'Stawka większa niż życie'. It honors the scriptwriters Zbigniew 
Safjan and Andrzej Szypulski, the actors Stanisław Mikulski (Hans Kloss) and 
Emil Karewicz (Hermann Brunner), and the composer Jerzy Matuszkiewicz, whose 
music helped bring the series to life.

The game also honors Dariusz Żołna, creator of the 1992 Hans Kloss game, 
fondly remembered by fans of early Polish gaming.

## Languages

The game supports the following languages: English, Polish, Czech, Slovak, 
Hungarian, Italian, German, French, Spanish.

## Game Objectives

In the summer of 1944, London becomes the target of relentless attacks by a 
new, deadly weapon developed by fascist Germany - the V1 flying bombs. These 
unmanned missiles bring destruction and terror to the civilian population. To 
stop further air raids and find a way to counter them, Allied intelligence must 
obtain the plans for this secret weapon.
Intelligence reports that the V1 plans are hidden in the heavily guarded 
"Wolf's Lair" (Wolfsschanze) bunker. Securing them will allow the Allies to 
develop an effective defense against further attacks. As a secret Polish agent 
deep behind enemy lines, your mission is to infiltrate the bunker, locate the 
V1 plans, and escape undetected. The enemy will try to stop you.

Good luck, Agent J-23!
