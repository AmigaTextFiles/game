                                  -or-
            (Smashing Space Stuff with Super Sonic Shooter)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 This game was created using Avantage Software's Shoot-Em-Up Construction
Kit. A wonderful piece of software that lets people who can't program
to save themselves (me), pass on strange bits of weirdness to obviously
bored people (you). This game is PUBLIC DOMAIN, You may keep it, copy
it, play it, give it to friends (or enemies), mock it, or erase it. If
you own S.E.U.C.K. yourself, feel free to butcher it to your own
liking. I only ask two things of you-

            1) Please include this Document with the program (Or someone
               else may get blamed for creating it by mistake.)
            2) Please for heavens sake don't send me any money!  The day
               people start paying for games like this is a sure sign
               that humanity has definitely lost it.

If you decide you like this game and can't live without it, Howz about

AMIGA and playing lousy home-made games). My address is:

             Kosmik Debris- The Game

 2 players may play (Gotta have 2 joysticks)
 5 (count em) lives - extra life at 10.000 points
 6 direction movement- alas, you may only fire forward.

 Right Mouse & fire (PAUSE)   Left mouse (RESTART)
 Left & Right Mouse buttons exits game
 Click on top/left of title screen to exit to workbench

The rules-

 You! are the Captain of the USS Exitprise, you are smooth, suave, and
 speak haltingly in choppy phrases. The United Federation of Losers
 has ordered you to clean sector Gamma Alpha Inna Gadda Davita of all
 floating space debris. Since the sector is directly adjacent to the
 Neutral zone you may encounter a Klingoff or two in your travels (yes.
 You may kill them too).

Shoot everything, everything is destructable.
O.k. the brick walls aren't destructable, you got me on that one.
Keep an eye or three open for FUEL depots. These provide NO fuel whatsoever
but you get heap big points.  Phaser? No I don't think it did.
