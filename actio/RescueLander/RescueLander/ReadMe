Lord Year 2024, December 18th, Wednesday

Name of the program: RescueLander.
This is the ninth version fully playable, it is poor
with no sounds and a bit bugged!
Try it and let me know.
This game requires only an external datum that is 
the given font Data70Quad.
You can use the given InstallFontData70Quad.BAT 
script just clicking on its icon to copy it in your 
FONTS: drawer.
The Data70Quad.font installation script requires
IconX or similar.
However you can lauch it correptly after Execute 
command always.
The reason for this upload is the correption of some
errors.
Made few correptions.
Now if the lander hits the landscape at high
velocity it crashes correptly.
Made some improvements.
Now the lander is more visible.
Now the velocity bars are more visible.
Now if you gain 1000 or more points you can buy a
lander for 1000 points.
Now there is a giant lander at start and at end of
the game.
Made some adjustements and some improvements.
Now if time flows a disturbing object flies on a 
rect line against the lander!
Made few correptions.
Now the program is at its best!
Reworked all the game, now the messages are made 
with more sense.
No sounds ATM however.
