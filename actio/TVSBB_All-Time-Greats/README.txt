T.V. Sports Basketball - by CinemaWare
All-Time Greats Roster List up to 2025
v1.0



> SYNOPSIS

This is a Fantasy League I created from scratch for the classic Basketball
game by CinemaWare (1989/1990).
This work is entirely my own and not affiliated with CinemaWare in any way.


> FREEWARE

This patch is considered freeware. Use it as you like, but feel free to drop
me a note at the e-mail address below if you appreciate the work — it took
quite a bit of time and testing to get right.


> DESCRIPTION

I've always wanted to play this game with the very best players for each
team. So I decided to create my own league, with a few rules :

1. Each team features the greatest players in its history, from the late 60s
up to today. Only players who made a significant impact for that team are
included.
Example: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is a Laker, not a Buck. LeBron James is a Cav,
not a Heat.
Some multi-team players were tricky—I used my best judgment.

2. No player duplicates. A player can appear as a coach for another team.

3. Some names had to be shortened due to CinemaWare’s limits.
Example: Roundfield → Rndfield, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar → Kareem Abdl-Jbbr.

4. Jersey numbers are restricted (no x6 to x9, max 55). When a player’s real
number wasn’t possible, I used an alternate.

5. Player heights are accurate to real life.

6. Teams are balanced. Dynasties like LAL, CHI, GSW, HOU, BOS are strongest.
Mid-tier examples: UTH, DAL. Lower-tier: MIN, CHA—but no team is more than
~15 points apart.

7. Ratings exceed the original cap of 32. Superstars (Jordan, LeBron) hit
mid-40s. Starters generally in high 30s–40s, benches mid-30s, very few in
high 20s.

8. The original Atlantic division had six real teams plus a fictional
“CinemaWare” team. I replaced it with Toronto, of course featuring Vince
Carter.

9. Coaches are rated quite high on purpose. Their strength reflects their
influence on the team, not just a sideline role.
