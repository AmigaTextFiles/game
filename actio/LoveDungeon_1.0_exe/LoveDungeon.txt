Phew, its done and its less than 64K ;)

Writing games is exhausting, maybe im getting old, maybe im a little rusty,
but boy does it take a long time!

I wrote my first piece of 68k assembler, in over 20 years, on the
23rd November 2014 and the game is released less than a month later,
coded in 100% ASM, I've learned a lot ion the last 4 weeks..

I hope you like it, please tell me about how you feel about the game on
EAB forums, search for LOVE DUNGEON.

ABOUT

LOVE DUNGEON is a spin off mini game project from my main project
Bruce Lee - a reimaging of the 1984 C64 (and other platforms) game

I wanted a smaller project to start with, the monster (YAMO) was
a late addition he wasnt going to be in this game at all!

SECRETS

Beat world records in any order to unlock the following:
	1st record - unlocks sound test
	2nd record - unlocks Monster Mode
	3rd record - unlocks Hide and Seek + Heart Attack game modes

Reset all World Records to 0, select reset records TWICE!
(Shhhh, dont tell anyone!)

Toggle PARTY MODE (removes options and exit selections from main menu)
Hold down Left Mouse Button when starting a game, once to enable, once
more to disable.

TECHNICAL

The game runs in 320x200 16 color mode (4 bitplanes)
with some copper effects

It only uses a single copper list and a single frame buffer
no double buffering or back buffer of any kind is used.
This gives the game an old school arcade feel
which is what I was aiming for.

Bruce and Yamo are hardware sprites

The game maps and title screens/high score screens etc are all made
from 8x8 pixel tiles There are a selection of 256 tiles
map is 1 byte per character.

The hearts are stored as tiles in the map and are masked onto the screen
I mask with the tile to the right of the heart, this is why you wont see
hearts next to each other horizontally in game ;)

I was originally going to mirror the hardware sprites in realtime
but thats quite of a lot of processing, so I just mirror them all when the
game loads. A side effect of this is that I dont have the sprites
stored in the best possible way and use the blitter to copy the sprite
data to where I want it.
This is the only time the blitter is used in the game.

The font is from the C64 version of Bombjack

MISSED FEATURES

I wanted to include the following but didnt have the time

Load and Save progress

Record the input of a game in progress and play this back in the attract
mode for High Scores per level

Add more maps - Very time consuming to design decent levels

Write a little Cracktro for a laugh

Add proper music to various parts of the game

Make an Icon and allow the program to run from workbench properly, I just ran
out of time! (its almost Xmas you know ;)

** REMOVED ** Keyboard handler - could not get it stable on higher end Amigas
I will get it working, its just that im really pushed for time and wanted
V1.0 out before Xmas 2014, its only used for quiting the game, which you can
do with a second fire button on a joystick.
