@node WBSTART "Starting Abuse from Workbench"

To run Abuse from Workbench, double click on the Starter icon. A small
window will pop up. You can configure Abuse form here. You can give
Starter a settings file as an icon tooltype, INIFILE. The default is
Abuse.ini. You can also use Starter as default tool in project icons.
The main archive contains examples for this. There are two other TOOLTYPES:
ABUSE=<name> gives an alternate name for the Abuse executable. The other
CONSOLE=<window description> describes the console window to use for
output. See the AmigaDOS documentation (Hint: something like CON:0/0/... :)

Here are the options settable form Starter:

@{i}General@{ui}:

    @{b}Game Mode:@{ub} This sets the game mode to either game (for normal
        play) or edit (for editing levels).
        (Default: Game)

    @{b}FPS Limiter:@{ub} This enables or disables the FPS limiter. Normally,
        the framerate will be limited to 15 fps, to avoid drastic changes. If
        you do not want to limit, set this to off. You may also try this for
        slow machines that do not get too high, anyway.
        (Default: on)

    @{b}Light F/X:@{ub} This disables the real-time light. If your machine is
        too slow, this will be done automatically. You may also switch the light
        on and off by pressing F6 during play. Note: this option can have
        great impact on speed. For example, my A4000/060 does 22 fps with light
        enabled (no limiter, off course), and 35 without light.
        (Default: on)

    @{b}Temp dir:@{ub} This gadget holds the name of the directory that holds the
        @{i}fastload.dat@{ui} file. This file may be large, sometimes 1 - 2 MB.
        If you are low on memory, you can point this to a disk-based directory.
        (Default: t:)

    @{b}Startup file:@{ub} Here, you can give the name of a lisp file that will
        be executed instead of abuse.lsp. This option is more or less obsolete,
        as addon modules are the new way for this. This option corresponds to the
        -lsf option.
        (Default: none)

    @{b}Addon module:@{ub} This is the name of an addon module. An example of an
        addon is the deathmat Deathmatch module. This option corresponds to the
        -a option.
        (Default: none)

    @{b}Additional options:@{ub} This field is appended to the command line on
        execution of the Abuse binary. You can give additional options not covered
        by Starter.
        (Default: empty)

@{i}Audio@{ui}:

    @{b}Sound enabled:@{ub} Setting this to off completely disables sound.
        AHI isn`t even opened.
        (Default: on)

    @{b}AHI Mode:@{ub} You can give the numerical AHI mode number here, or
        leave it unchanged at -1 to let AHI use it`s default audio mode.
        (Default: -1)

    @{b}Mixing Frequency:@{ub} Use this to set the mixing frequency. Sound is
        normally onl 11025 KHz in Abuse, so you may set this accordingly, or
        leave it at -1 for default.
        (Default: -1)

    @{b}Select:@{ub} Click here to select an AHI audio mode. A standard AHI
        requester will pop up. Refer to the AHI docs for more information.

    @{b}Channels:@{ub} The number of channels to use. The more channels, the
        more sounds can be played simultaneously.
        (Default: 8)

    @{b}Boost:@{ub} Volume boost. The more channels, the softer the sound. Use
        this to compensate this.
        (Default: 2)

@{i}Video@{ui}:

    @{b}Driver:@{ub} Select the video system to use: RTGMaster, CGX/P96, AGA, ECS.
        (Default: RTGMaster)

    @{b}Pixel doubling:@{ub} Doubles pixels in game, thus accelerating light
        calculation. Note however that the resolution must be at least 640x400
        for this option to work. Corresponding to the -2 command line option.
        (Default: off)

    @{b}Double buffering:@{ub} Enable double buffering. This options can only be used
        with the RTGMaster (not on Workbench).
        (Default: off)

    @{b}WB Color Change:@{ub} Allow RTGMaster to change the screens colors when
        running on Workbench. If you experience strange colors when running in
        a Workbench window, try this.
        (Default: off)

    @{b}CV64 compatible:@{ub} Set this if you have a CV64 (not 3D).
        (Default: off)

    @{b}Video Mode:@{ub} Select best mode, or open a requester (CGX/Native)
        (Default: Best mode)

    @{b}Direct access:@{ub} Access display memory directly (CGX only). Note that
        this can either slow down, or accelerate Abuse. As a rule of thump,
        if you have a slow graphics board, leave it off.
        (Default: off)

    @{b}Width/Height:@{ub} Dimensions of the display to use. This is ignored
        when using a mode requester.
        (Default: 320x200)

@{i}Net@{ui}:

    @{b}Game Mode:@{ub} Enable or disable network support. Remote means network
        enabled, local means disabled. Local corresponds to the -nonet option.
        Note that if you want to start a net game from the main menu, you
        have to use Remote.
        (Default: Remote)

    @{b}Server name:@{ub} Name of a server hosting a net game. This corresponds to
        the option -net <server name>. When using this option, Abuse will directly
        connect to the server, or quit if it can`t contact it.
        (Default: none)

@node HISTORY "History"

Date        Version     Changes

29-Jun-98   1.2         Hopefully, this is the last time we`ve seen the tmp: bug.
                            Should be gone for good with this release.
                        Also, some people reported the dreaded EMT Trap again
                            that also haunted ADescent. This seems to be
                            an error with egcs` -68020-40 option, which *should*
                            compile code optimal for all processors.
                            So, this time it`s different binaries for 020-060
                        As another fix, I tried to work on both the CGX and the
                            RTGMaster code. People who had problems with one of these
                            should try again....

26-Jun-98   1.1         Fixed a bug with the native screen mode requester
                        Fixed a bug that prevented creating the lisp
                            cache file without "/" translation in ixprefs
                        Fixed a bug in Starter which prevented the -modreq
                            option
                        Included in this archive are the net levels, which
                            were only available with the source code archive.
                        Renamed the .ini files (droped the .ini). That way,
                            they may be moved together with the icon

24-Jun-98   1.0         First Release
@endnode
@node FAQ "The Abuse FAQ"
(Note: As this is the first release, there is not much to say in this section. More may come in the future.)

@{b}About these weird effects in the ECS version...@{ub}
Yes, I can see it too, there was nothing unusual in your last cigarette. The ECS version has a problem with the C2P stuff. It may be fixed later...

@{b}How do I report a bug in Abuse ?@{ub}
Have a look at the @{"Disclaimer" link LEGAL} section for our email addresses.

@{b}Where do I get the files needed to play ? @{ub}
Instructions on how to get the required files are available @{"here" link OBTAIN}. If you`ve got them, look @{"here" link INSTALL} for installation instructions.

@{b}Is there any place where I can download the registered files ? Any Warez/Pirate sites ? @{ub}
(Yes, this IS frequently asked). We will not send pirated files, so don`t even bother to ask. And, we do not know where to get a pirated copy. Period.

@{b}Why is there both RtgMaster and CyberGfx/AGA in it ?@{ub}
The EGCS compiler used to compile Abuse has some problems with RtgMaster. This will be fixed later. We suggest you use RtgMaster, as it supports double buffering and custom C2P code. Aditionally, it supports playing in a Workbench window, which isn`t possible on CyberGfx due to a bug in the library.

@{b}Abuse crashes as soon as I start it (after a reboot)@{ub}
This is a bug caused by the opening of rtgmaster.library from egcs. Will be fixed soon.

@{b}Abuse tells me something about "write permission" to /tmp... @{ub}
Yup, Abuse wanted to write to /tmp, not tmp: . This is no problem with
ixprefs "Translate /" option enabled, but this isn`t the default behavior.
It`s fixed in the 1.1 release

@{b}Abuse is too slow, what can I do ?@{ub}
Abuse was originally aimed at a 486/DX2 and early Pentium processors. Thus, it`s a
bit slow on older machines. One of the time consuming things is the light. You can
switch it off with the F6 key. Mat Colton pointed out that you can also limit the
amount of processor time for sound in AHI prefs.

@{b}Talking about sound, when using my sound card, Abuse gets really jerky.@{ub}
Yes, that`s something some folk observed. We know this, and it will be fixed later.

@endnode
@node PLAY "Playing Abuse"

This page lists the Amiga specific changes. For more general information, refer to the README, included in the @{b}abuse200.zip@{ub} archive.

The Keyboard layout has been changed to match the Amiga keyboard. Running and jumping is done with the cursor keys, while cursor down activates lifts and teleporters.

The Del and Help keys switch weapons. Note that this is different from the PC version, which used CTRL and INS. The number keys on the top row may also be used to select the weapon. Additionally, F6 toggles lightning effects. Note, though, that lighting is also atumatically disablede whenever the frame rate drops too low.

Speaking of the frame rate, it is automatically limited to 15 fps to keep speed constant. To turn off this limiter, press F7. Finally, to get a guess at the frame rate, press F8 to show it in the top left corner. The number on the top is the frame rate ×10, while the next three numbers are some debug info.

@endnode
@node INTRO "Introduction"

Welcome to Abuse Amiga...

  If you still remember Obliterator from Psygnosis, you're very close to what Abuse looks like. But under the hood, there's @{b}much@{ub} more...

  Basically, Abuse is a Jump-and-run game for the high-level machine. This means that the requirements to run Abuse are a bit higher than usual for a game of that type, but that's mostly due to the amount of special effects the game features.

  Plus, Abuse is almost ridiculously extendible. Since almost the entire game workings are programmed in Common Lisp (with a few additional functions), it is very easy to add new objects, new aliens, and basically everything you can think of. With the Abuse engine, it is quite possible to "re-build" such games as @{i}Another World@{ui} or @{i}Flashback@{ui} as well as things like @{i}Turrican@{ui}. All you need is a bit of graphics and programming skills.

A word about the graphics systems.

  Abuse uses as it`s primary graphics system the rtgmaster system, written by Steffen Haueser. As a secondary option, it also supports CyberGraphX and AGA native. These options are only to compensate for difficulties with the egcs-compiler used for Abuse. RtgMaster gives you double buffering, customizable C2P and Workbench window support. However, if you run into trouble with it, try -aga/-cgx. These problems will be fixed later.

Features include:
  - @{b}Dynamic light effects@{ub}. Every level is lightsourced in realtime, allowing such nice
    effects like explosions and gunfire.
  - @{b}Network play@{ub}. Up to 8 players via TCP/IP in Deathmatch Mode.
  - @{b}Level Editor@{ub}. Build your own levels, fill them with monsters, then blast them to
    pieces.

And, new for the Amiga version:
  - @{b}Network code actually works@{ub}. The original version had a bug that, when using media
    with small MTU, trashed files that where trasnfered.
  - @{b}Stereo sound@{ub}. The original had only mono.

@node README "Original README file"
@{FG shine}NOTE: This is the original README file as distributed with the source code.@{FG text}

Crack dot Com is hereby releasing the source code to Abuse to the
public domain.

Ownership:

  The following are statements of Crack dot Com's ownership.  These
  items are NOT being submitted to the public domain.

    Crack dot Com retains ownership of the Abuse trademark.
    Crack dot Com retains ownership of the Crack dot Com trademark.
    Crack dot Com retains ownership of the Abuse "retail" data set.
    Crack dot Com retains ownership of the Abuse "registered" data set.

  The "retail" and "registered" data sets are defined as the levels,
  sound effects, music, artwork and other data which are NOT common to the
  "shareware" release of the game.

Licenses and Third Party Owners:

  Crack licensed the DOS Abuse rights to Electronic Arts and the Mac Abuse
  rights to Bungie.  Crack is therefore NOT releasing the full data set to
  the public domain to protect EA's and Bungie's investments in the product.

  Sound effects found in the shareware release of Abuse are the copyright of
  Bobby Prince and are not being submitted to the public domain.

Disclaimer of Waranty:

  As with most public domain software, no warranty is made or implied
  by Crack dot Com or Jonathan Clark.

Examples of What you CAN Do:

  Make another game and sell it commercially using the Abuse source code.
  Use pieces of the source code or shareware data (excluding the WAV's-
    you must speak to Bobby Prince) however you see fit.
  Learn how to make a better game.
  Port Abuse to any system you like.

A note from Jonathan Clark:

  I'm busy coding Golgotha so I don't have time to answer many questions.
  If you e-mail me, I'll read it (unless it's really long), but I may
  not answer.  If you are making a game with the code, I would like to
  hear about that sort of thing.

A note from Dave Taylor:

  I didn't write a line of the Abuse source code, but I'm proud to have
  footed the bill.  If any adventurous coders are interested, I would
  love to someday see a version which runs a lot faster, draws interpolated
  frames between the 15 Hz (i believe) updates, and runs under Win32.  I
  believe in the released versions, we didn't include a line of assembly,
  and we've identified several areas that can be optimized.

  Also enclosed is the Mac Abuse source tree.  We decided to split
  the Mac version from the main source tree.  The Mac version features
  several updates to the Abuse engine and is designed primarily for a
  640x480 resolution.  We do not know if the Mac Abuse source tree
  compiles these days, so it's certainly wiser for the novice to stick
  with the main abuse and imlib directories instead of the macabuse/abuse
  and macabuse/imlib directories.

  Many thanks to Jason Merrill at Cygnus who fitted the Abuse source to
  use configure and fixed several bugs.  The following are exerpts from
  his e-mail to us detailing some of those changes:

    "You'll need to remove abuse/lnx_sdrv and abuse/keydrv before building so
     make doesn't rebuild them in the source directory.

     Some crashes fixed.  Curiously, building the 'opt' target instead of
     'debug' produces a program that doesn't crash in mid-game, though it does
     occasionally say "jfree: bad pointer".  I haven't checked whether this is
     because of optimization or -DNO_CHECK.

     ABUSE_PATH should work now, but it's useless without ABUSE_SAVE_PATH,
     which would be harder to fix.  The 'abuse' script just makes symlinks
     to the installed data files.

     keydrv now works and cleans up after itself.

     Changed SVGA mouse init to be run before vga_init so it only needs to be
     suid root, not run as root.  Use vga_getmousetype() instead of checking
     MOUSE_TYPE.

     The patch uses automake, but stock FSF automake won't work.  I had to
     tweak it to accommodate your source layout.  Avoid rebuilding
     Makefile.in.

     This should work for non-linux UNIX targets as well, but I haven't tested
     it yet.

     Fixes another couple of crashes and fixes support for sparc-sun-solaris2,
     mips-sgi-irix5, powerpc-ibm-aix4.1, and probably others I haven't tried.
     I haven't tested the AIX sound driver."

@node REQUIRE "Requirements"

For playing Abuse, you will need to have the following:
 o an Amiga computer with at least a 68020 CPU. A 040 is recommended.
 o about 4 Megs of memory (exact number unknown).
 o about 8 Megs of harddisk space (no floppies)
 o @{i}any@{ui} display hardware, including AGA, Graphic Cards, and (limited) ECS
 o AHI V4 or better.
 o ixemul.library 47.3 or better
 o ixnet.library 47.3 or better (for internet playing)
 o a GG/ixemul-compatible TCP stack (AmiTCP, AS-255. Miami should do, too)
 o for Graphics Cards, either RTGMaster installed, or a CyberGraphX compatible
   graphics system (CyberGraphX, Picasso96, ProBench).
 o a set of Version 2.0 compatible data files. These can be downloaded at
   various sites, see @{"Obtaining the files" link OBTAIN}. Contrary to Descent,
   the @{i}Shareware@{ui} files will do perfectly, although you will only have
   four levels to play instead of 18...

Recommended:
 o an 68060 for optimal lighting effects
 o lots of memory
 o lots of harddisk space for addon levels and graphics
 o a graphics board is not really required. The AGA version is as
   fast as the graphics card version.
 o sorry, no ViRGE version :-)

If you have ever successfully run ADescent, you should already have most of the stuff... :-)

ECS users note:
  The game also runs on ECS machines in EHB mode. Note however, that the EHB stuff is not really usable right now. Everytime the player gets hurt, there is weird color flickering on the screen. We haven`t been able to trace this bug yet, but we might remove it in the future if we get enough requests for it (if nobody uses the EHB mode, there`s no point in fixing it.)

@endnode
@node OBTAIN "Obtaining the files"

  Abuse Amiga works with both the Shareware and the registered files. The shareware version resides in a file @{b}@{u}abuse200.zip@{uu}@{ub} and can be retrieved from many FTP servers around the world. To download it directly, go to @{FG shine}http://www.crack.com/@{FG text} and follow the Abuse links to the download page. A link to the file is also on our homepage (see @{"here" link LEGAL}).

  Make absolutely sure you get the 2.0 files. There's also a file @{b}@{u}abuse200r.zip@{uu}@{ub}, which is only an upgrade patch for earlier versions. Best use the link on our page, or use FTP Search (@{FG shine}http://ftpsearch.ntnu.no/ftpsearch @{FG text}).

  See @{"Installation" link INSTALL} for a piece of advice on how to unpack and install the files.
@endnode
@node INSTALL "Installation"
When installing, you will most likely have the Abuse Amiga archive already unpacked (or you would not be reading this). Unzip the @{b}@{u}abuse200.zip@{uu}@{ub} archive to a neutral place, for example RAM: if you have enough memory. Now look for the files @{b}@{u}DISK1.DAT@{uu}@{ub}, @{b}@{u}DISK2.DAT@{uu}@{ub} and @{b}@{u}DISK3.DAT@{uu}@{ub}. These are self-extracting PC LHA Archives, so you'll need the LHA program to unpack them.

  On the shell, type the following:

> lha x DISK1.DAT
...
> lha x DISK2.DAT
...
> lha x DISK3.DAT

ignoring any messages about "skipping corrupt data" (that's part of the PC exec stuff). Now delete the zip archive and the @{FG text}DISK?.DAT@{FG text} files and copy everything else to where you unpacked the Amiga Abuse archive.

In this directory, you should now have some files and subdirectories, most notably

ART (dir)       ADDON (dir)     MUSIC (dir)     SFX (dir)
LEVELS (dir)    LISP (dir)

plus a number of #?.LSP files. Everything that ends in .LSP is a lisp file, and basically represents the game flow. SFX contains the sound effects (WAV format), ART contains the graphics in a special format. LISP is the main directory where the biggest part of the .LSP files reside.

  The ADDON directory contains "plugins", that is, external add-ons. Most of the additional files you'll find on the net go here.

  Two absolut must-have addons are @{b}@{u}aliens.zip@{uu}@{ub} and @{b}@{u}claudio.zip@{uu}@{ub}. The first one adds (you guessed it) Aliens graphics and sound effects, while the second is a more general expansion of useful graphics, sounds and add-on objects for custom level editing. Links to both archives can be found on our web page.

@node SHSTART "Starting Abuse"
  Abuse can be startet from shell by typing "Abuse <options>", or by double-clicking
  on the Starter Icon. This section describes shell startup, for help on using
  "Starter", click @{"here" link WBSTART}

  Here's an overview of the most common options:

@{b}@{u}Sound options:@{uu}@{ub}

-nosound
    Disables sound completely (default: Use sound)

-ahimode
    Specifies the (decimal) AHI audio mode to use. (default: Preferences Setup)

-ahifreq
    Specifies the mixing frequency used by AHI. (default: Preferences Setup)

-ahichan
    Specifes the number of channels to use. (default: 8)

-ahiboost
    Specifies a volume boost if the sound it too low. (default: 2)


@{b}@{u}Video options:@{uu}@{ub}

-nocc
    Do not change colors when running in a Workbench window. Default is on.
    This option is only available with rtgmaster, and only if running in
    a window. This prevents changeing of screen colors, otherwise the
    Workbench will hardly be readable.

-cgx
    Use CyberGraphX instead of RTGMaster. (default: Use RTGMaster)
    (using RTGMaster is recommended, because of double buffering and
    workbench window support)

-aga
    Forces the use of an AGA native screenmode. (default: Use RTGMaster)

-ehb
    Forces the use of an EHB native screenmode. (default: Use RTGMaster)

-vdirect
    Only useable with native/CyberGraphX. Does direct WriteChunkyPixels calls instead
    of buffering in fastram. Requires Kickstart 3.1

-dbuf
    Only usable with RTGMaster. Uses double buffering for less flicker.
    (default: use single buffer)

-compat
    Only usable with RTGMaster. Forces the use of standard functions
    WriteRTGPixelArray instead of direct memory writes. Use this
    with CV64 when you encounter the "half screen" effect.
    (default: direct memory access)

-modereq
    Only usable with native/CyberGraphX display. Opens a screenmode
    requester instead of assuming 320x200. Any size is allowed, must
    be 8 bit deep. (default: RTGMaster uses internal request. -cgx
    uses best available mode).

-resolution <w> <h>
    Only usable with native/CyberGraphX display. Opens a screen <w>
    pixels wide and <h> pixels high without asking for a mode.
    (default: 320 x 200)

-320x240
-320x200
-320x256
-640x480
    Only usable with native/CyberGraphX display. Has the same effect
    as specifying -resolution <w> <h> with predefined resolutions.
    (default: -320x200)

@{b}@{u}Misc. options:@{uu}@{ub}

-lsf <file>
    Use alternative startup file instead of abuse.lsp
    (default: -lsf abuse.lsp)

-a <file>
    Shortcut for -lsf ADDON/<file>/<file>.lsp
    (default: none)

-edit
    Do not start the game; instead go directly into the editor.
    (default: start game)

-f <file>
    Instead of going into the first level on game startup, load <file>
    and start the game there. Useful for testing levels or playing
    add-on levels.

-lisp
    go directly into the CLIVE lisp interpreter without starting the game.

-net <hostname>
    try to connect to an active Abuse server and join a netgame. <hostname>
    is the name of the server machine. See also @{"Net Abuse" link NETABUSE}.
    (default: play locally)

-nonet
    Disable internet support.
    (default: internet support enabled)

@node NETABUSE "Net Abuse - Playing Abuse over the 'net"
@{u}@{FG shine}Starting a net game:@{FG text}@{uu}
  Abuse has an integrated network capability that can be used to play a game over the internet. The Amiga version also has this feature. To use it, you'll need an active internet connection (or a local area network running TCP/IP) and a compatible TCP/IP stack, as well as the ixnet.library.
  Abuse is a client-server system. This means that there must be exactly one Abuse server per game, and up to 7 clients. The server must be started first, and must be running before the game can start.
  To start a server for the first time, start Abuse normally, then select "Network" from the main menu. CLick on the "Start new Netgame" button and adjust the parameters to your liking. Once you're done, press the red check mark to start the server.
  A window will appear telling you that Abuse is waiting for <n> additional players to connect. Your clients should now start Abuse on their local machines with the command line "@{FG shine}abuse -net <yourhost>@{FG text}", where <yourhost> is the name of the machine where the server is running (i.e. your machine). After a while of rumbling and a few net transfers, the game will start. This might take some time, especially if many participate in the game, so have patience.
  When you want to re-start the server, you might take a shorter route by entering "@{FG shine}abuse -a DEATHMAT@{FG text}" from the command line. This will automatically lauch deathmatch mode with the parameters of your last game.

@{u}@{FG shine}In play:@{FG text}@{uu}
  Eveything is the same in deathmatch mode, except of course that you encounter real-life players instead of monsters. Pressing the 'c' key during the game will bring up an IRC-style chat window where messages are displayed with the handle in front of every line. Use this to tease your opponents. ;-)
  The player list in the top left corner shows the kill statistics for each player. Once a player has reached the Max. Kill number specified in the "new net game" dialog, the game will continue in the next level.

@{u}@{FG shine}Addons:@{FG text}@{uu}
  For the DeathMatch, you'll need the DEATHMAT/ directory (with contents) in your ADDON directory, as well as the netlevel/ directory. The netlevel directory is not included in the abuse200.zip file, but in the source code distribution. Therefore, we included them in the Amiga Abuse archive.
  There are a number of additional (although not as violent) net games written in LISP floating around the internet, so you might want to keep your eyes open.

@node EDITOR "How the Abuse Editor works"

This node is yet to be written.

For a short introduction, look at abuse.doc.
Read the part about making links. Links always have to go from activated-object-->activator.

A list of lisp commands can be found at @{FG shine}http://www.fortunecity.com/tattooine/carpenter/42/lispedit.txt@{FG text}

I will write a few words about the editor as soon as possible. It's really powerfull, and as such is a bit hard to get to know it, but once you know what is about, you can do almost @{b}anything@{ub} with it. Really.
