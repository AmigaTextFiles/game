Dear Amigan,
            Hi! remember me? Sam, the author of the infamous AMI-Gotchi series of shit...er...games. Well I`m back with a new game, which has been lying on my Amiga untouched for about a month, I would have sent it in earlier but I couldn`t be bothered to. But now it`s the summer holidays and no school for weeks, so it was either * lie in bed all day, * listen to Metallica and other cool bands like the Chili Peppers, * play on the guitar I just bought, or * write a readme file for my latest wonder...SnakeWars. I decided to do all of them. Enough of the gob shite and down to what it is...

...What it is...
----------------

Ever played that old game Egyptian Run, I think it is in the Assassins collection. In Egyptian Run loads of pyramids come shooting at you from the top of the screen (to give the effect you are moving up) and you move left and right dodging them at the bottom of the screen and you have to reach the end. I liked the idea and I thought, I`ll make a version of that which slowly speeds up, not starting at warp factor 5, I`ll give the player more lives, I`ll make there less obsticals,and I`ll incorporate my snake out of my Snake Files joke pictures.(1/2 of joke pictures in gallery on AFCD 15, the first stuff I got published, you can see the rest of them in the gallery section on AFCD 29 which is on issue 113, look in the gallery section in the magazine, top left of page 91)

    There are 2 armys fighting in...somewhere, one army is the Snakes army, the goodies, the people you work for and there is the army of the evil...thing called Futan (pronounced "FOO-TAN") who wants all the snakes eradicated and he wants there country or land for some unknown, evil reason. As you know, in a war, people get hurt and injured, so you drive the ambulance taking the snakes to hospital. Through the game you use 6 different vehicals,(ordinary ambulance,tank,speed boat,helicopter,jet and space shuttle) on 4 different terains,(land,sea,air and outer space). Every few levels the speed will increase and every 5 levels you will get a password, you get a new vehical and work on a new terrain. The distance between the start of the level and the hospital changes every level or 2. There is a total of 30 levels. There are passwords for each vehical and there are a few cheats, 9999 lives and a cheat to increase the speed every time you die, you can also switch the cheats off.

You must enter all codes in upper case (capitals) with no space at the start and there must be a space between all words and words and punctuation.

You start off with 11 lives and you can pause the game by pressing fire, this will tell you lives left,distance left,distance travelled ect. Everything is controlled by the joystick. dodge the things moving down the screen by moving left and right. There is absolutily no sound for 2 reasons, * couldn`t find any good ones and I cannot make my own due to a lack of a sampler and * I couldn`t be bothered to change the code as the game was badly pissing me off. This game unlike AMI-Gotchi will work from anywhere on disc, harddisc, CD or other media so you don`t need to assign it or anything like that. You should be able to work the rest of it out. You must have the font "2001.font" in your fonts directory. After every level you get an extra life. Don`t worry about mines stuck on the background next to you they cannot harm you, it is a bug that I cannot fix.

My game SnakeWars was created on a bog standard A1200

I used DPaint 4 AGA and I think I used PPaint 6.4 ( the version off AF), and it was all coded in
Blitz Basic 2

I got the idea on the 24/05/98, started on basic graphics on 25/05/98 and started the code on the 26/05/98. I finished it a week or 3 before issue 113 arrived, I don`t know how long ago that was as I am writing this on the 29/07/98 and I haven`t use my Amiga since a few days after AF 113 came.

I know it works on a bog standard A1200 as I have tested it on both of mine, it should work on anything with 1 Meg RAM but it might not work on 512 Kb machines as the code is very sloppy.

This game is Freeware, copy this and give it to who you want.
If you want to register as a SnakeWars soldier and/or want the codes then send one or more of the following things to the address a bit further up the page:

  If you don`t know what bands I like call me (Tel no. by address)

If you have any problems with registering call me.


       Enjoy!!
