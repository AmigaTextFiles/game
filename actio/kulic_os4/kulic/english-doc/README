This is my first real Linux game - excuse my mistakes and so.

Requirements
   - allegro library - >= 3.3, >=4 recomended

Install
   - Open /include/lang.h and do little edit if you want Czech or German - default English
   
   - try "./configure"
   - and "make" (ends by ERROR - but executable is created)
   
   - in directory /src should be execitable "kulic"
   
	- now you can play the game but you have to run it from X terminal and first you have
     to copy the executable to /data


	- you can manually install the game :
       switch to root user 
       copy all what is in /data  into /usr/local/share/kulic or usr/share/kulic
       "kulic" copy to /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin or /usr/games or wherever you want
       Now you can start the game by typing command kulic.

	- file .kulic will be created in your home directory. You can adit the game configuration if you want
