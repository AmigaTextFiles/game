Robot World--The ultimate in frustrating platform games.
		         By Derrick Ward in 1995
   

INSTALLATION

To install open the RobotWorld drawer.
The game uses the explode.library so click on the icon called `Install`.  This will copy the file to your LIBS directory on your workbench disk you booted from. You must boot from a disk with Iconx in your C directory (which all hard disks and original Commodore boot disks have on them).

REQUIREMENTS

Amiga, 1meg of ram.

RECOMMENDED

1.5meg of ram, hard-disk.

THE GAME


The first thing you will see is a message asking you if you want to close workbench to save memory. This game takes up alot of memory on a 1meg system like mine and if you are running it from the workbench you should press "y" on the keyboard. I belive this saves about 40k. If you still get an out of memory message close all windows before booting the game. The game runs fine if workbench is not loaded on a 1meg machine. It runs fine from a CLI. 

Pressing left-amiga-A will multitask the game (as in all amos created programs) which will of course not work if you disabled workbench.

When you press fire on the intro, a character selection will appear.
There are few differences between the Robot and the Dragon but some people prefer one over the other for some reason. Press fire and the game boots up. A map screen which will allow you to select one of the four existing levels will appear. Use left or right on your joystick to move the arrow to the level you would like to play and press fire.

When playing the game you use up to jump straight up, the diagonal ups to jump diagonally, and fire to shoot. Also if you have a mouse or joystick plugged into port one then pressing the first button on it will release a energy cloud that will destroy most enemies horizontally to you.  You only have a certain amount of clouds so use them wisely. The status bar at the bottom tells you the amount.

The object of the game is to make it to the end of the level and destroy the control device (a grey thing with a skull-like face on it). Shooting it three times will destroy the level. The control device cannot be destroyed by death clouds. When you have completed all five levels you will have completed the game.

Press L at anytime while in a level to return to the map screen. You will still be in the same game and have the same lives so be careful.
Pressing control-c at anytime will exit the program.
Pressing p while holding left or right on the joystick will pause until you press fire. 
Pressing the escape key will bring you back to the opening of the game. Pressing left-Amiga-A, as in all Amos created games, will multitask.


There are several different enemies you will encounter in the game.
Regular Smileys(1 hit), Chainsaw Man(2 hits), Floating Demon(2 hits - if you watch it closely you will notice that it disappears and then reappears very quickly. This is one of his abilities. Do not be surprised if your bullet seems to go right through him.) Super Smileys (2 hits), Bouncing Spike(cannot be destroyed except with cloud), Pacman(3 hits),
and Drone Spike(3 hits). You can also be destroyed by the blue spikes in the background.   

ABOUT THE GAME

As I said this game was written in Amos Pro and actually is the first program I ever created with that language. I learned how to program it with this game. I had to do something with Amos so I decided to create this game. The game was created on my Amiga 600 80meg hd with 1meg of ram and I barely could manage it. It doesn't help that I was using a TV instead of a monitor. There were alot of things I couldn't add to the game because of the RAM restrictions. I was going to make more than 7 levels but I got tired of using the same blocks and enemies over and over again.

I used graphic workshop (the worst paint program in the universe), 
Fusion Paint (the second worst paint program in the universe),
Octamed Pro 5 (I got it free from a magazine), Imploder 4 (PD), and Interword (free with CU Amiga) in addition to amos pro when creating this game. It cost nothing to make and proves that anyone with an amiga can create a low-B video game at least.

I didn't use any extensions when making this game and it is fully compatible with earlier versions of amos such as 1.3. I made this game right out of the book that comes with Amos Pro. 


There may be a small glitch or two in the game but they will probably not bother you.  If you find any major bugs, like bugs that make everything go bezerk or crash your system badly be sure and tell me about them.

-This game is two years old. I now no longer use my Amiga very often but I have decided to release this game on Aminet for fun. If you want the source code or would like to comment on this game feel free to email me about it at ddward@cswnet.com 
 
Also be sure and visit my MOD music page at www.cswnet.com/~ddward
Many of the MODs there were created using Octamed on my Amiga 600.
