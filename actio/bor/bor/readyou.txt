1. Some words of wisdom

Beats of Rage was created by Senile Team as a tribute to the Streets
of Rage series, which originally appeared on Sega Megadrive/Genesis.
We always hoped that Streets of Rage 4 would someday see the light of
day, however SOR 4 never appeared, so we had to take matters into our
own hands. And Beats of Rage is the result.

The character sprites used in Beats of Rage are not created by Senile
Team, but are actually 'borrowed' from SNK Playmore's King of Fighters
series. Also some parts of the backgrounds are taken from KOF.

As some parts of Beats of Rage were not created by us we wish to
emphasise that the creators of Beats of Rage fully acknowledge the
copyrights to Streets of Rage and King of Fighters, owned by SEGA and
SNK Playmore, respectively. Also Beats of Rage is freeware; no fee may
be charged for copying or distributing the Beats of Rage files.



2. Getting started

Step1.	Download borXXXXX.zip or 6 rars. 
Step2.	Unpack the archive with either winzip (www.winzip.com) or 
	winrar (www.rarlab.com). If you use windows XP, you don't need 
	winzip, because it is built in, but you do need to copy or
	cut the BOR files from the compressed folder.
Step3.	Select bor.exe, press enter and start playing.
Step3.	The standard sound settings in BOR are lowest quality, since 
	this is most compatible. To improve the sound quality go to 
	options, setup soundcard...



3. Q&A

Q: The game is not working.
A: Multiple possibilities exist, so try if your problem may be one of 
   these:
   - The game is still packed, because BOR won't work from the zip 
     file/compressed folder.
   - Your operation system is windows 2000, or XP. These systems have 
     lousy DOS compatibility, so try an older os or wait for the 
     windows version.

Q: Will there be a Mac, Linux, xbox, PS2, gamecube, DC, or Atari 2600 version?
A: We haven't planned any conversion ourselves, but we may release the 
   source code so others might make a conversion.

Q: Why is the sound crappy?
A: - Have you changed the sound settings in BOR to a higher quality 
     (options, setup soundcard...)
   - Your sound device does not support DOS properly.
   - Your operation system is windows 2000, or XP. These systems have 
     lousy DOS compatibility.

Q: Who made the music?
A: We didn't make the music ourselves, but used existing tracks of 
   multiple artists.
Level 1a: Coretex - Ascension
Level 1b: SNK - King Of Fighters '95 AOF stage
Level 2:  VNV Nation - Saviour
Level 3:  Juno Reactor - Guardian Angel
Level 4a: Jesper Kyd - Wasteland
Level 4b: Front Line Assembly/Cydonia - Columbian necktie
Level 5a: SNK - Music from Kizuna super tag battle
Level 5b: Front Line Assembly - Columbian necktie (Goarge mix)
Level 6a: Prodigy - The trick
Level 6b: Project Pitchfork (VNV Nation remix) - Existence
Mr. Y: Cubanate - Ordinary Joe
Ending: Louis Armstrong - We have all the time in the world
Bonus: Future Sound Of London - My Kingdom
