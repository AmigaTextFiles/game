@node 2 "About WormOut 2097"

                        --- About WormOut 2097 ---

The idea to make 'WormOut 2097' came from the 'secret' part of 'Klub Diznee'
by Dexter/Abyss (A GREAT THX music mag!). Then the gameplay was spiced up
with elements from 'The Worms' made by some Polish guy I don't remember
(these so called elements was the rocks) and the inspiration for the door
came from a Mac game I have some weird feeling is called 'Stix' although I
have no idea if it's true. Along with the oversized playing area, this is
what makes 'WormOut 2097' what it is.
   WormOut 2097 does perform a few not so system friendly tricks, to make
the game run smoothly even on slow processors (<68020) therefore it may not
be fully compatible with all system setups. One thing you shouldn't mess to
much around with is switching between NTSC and Pal screenmodes, as this
sometimes makes the computer crash (but only if you keep switching the
option around 10 times a second). Another thing that may upset some 'System
Friendly Gamers' is the disabling of multi-tasking during the actual game
(during the option and intro sequence the game fully multitasks). By
the way A600 users will need a joystick, as there are no arrow keys on the
keyboard of their favorite machine. Elsehow the game should run on all
Amigas with 1mb of memory (I hope ;)
   There is only one known bug in the game, and that is if you keep
preesing 'P' while the game is paused, the game will continue in a sort of
stop-motion slow-mo mode until the keyboard buffer is empty (this takes two
seconds to fix, but who gives a damn anyways?)

@node 3 "The Aim of the Game"

                        --- The Aim of the Game ---

Simple! Take control of a bio-mechanic worm and collect tokens (green
circular things, with numbers inside), your worm will grow with the number
of joints written inside the token and so will your score. At the same time
as collecting tokens you must avoid colliding with the edges of the playing
area, the rocks, and the wall (the rocks and the wall may be disabled if
you are a wimp :). In the upper left hand corner of the screen an arrow
will appear, this arrow points in the direction the next token is, if the
next token is within visble range (on the screen) the arrow will turn into
a dot.
   The option menu gives you the choice of how many rocks you want on the
playing area, the number of rocks is only representative as the game itself
will calculate how many there are room for. Also in the options menu you
can chose wether or not you wan't a door on the playing area. In case you
select that the door should be there (on) a wall will intersect the playing
area in two equal halves, and somewhere in this wall a door is placed. To
open the door you should worm-over a button placed close to the door, the
button will now be green, and the door open, as soon as you have gone
through the door it will close again, and you will have to reopen it, using
the button on the other side.
   If you were ever in doubt: the worm is controlled using either joystick
or the arrow keys on the keyboard (too bad for you A600 owners), and space
does the same trick as fire does on the stick.
   When you eventualy have crashed into something a small request will
appear, asking you whether you want to replay the level or return to the
options (intro) seqtion of the game, chosing replay you will restart on the
same level, with the rocks and wall/door placed at the same places, elsehow
you will return to the options/intro sequence.
   Why, don't just sit there play the game, you will figure it all out in
no time... Good luck (You won't need it ;)

@node 6 "Coders and Soundwizards needed"

                  --- Coders and Soundwizards needed ---

For a new game from LED we need a good coder and a musician/sound FX
creator. The game will be sort of copycat of Prince of Persia, and Tomb
Raider (for PlayStation) mixed with a little more adventure elements. The
game will be presented in a 2D platform way along with some stunning pre-
rendered 3D presentation sequences. Emphasis will be put on super smooth
character animation, and extravagant background scenarios. The game will be
AGA/Graphics card only. To produce this game, a small development team has
to be set up (as I (Mikkel Fredborg) am currently the only member of Living
and Electronic Dreams).
   Coders: must be able to program both action and adventure elements, and
do it in AGA (256 colours) or on graphics boards. A proven track record
would be nice, but is no demand. Send some examples of your AMIGA work to
LED (must be able to run on A1200 68030 8mb fast).
	Musicians/Sound FX artists: Musicians should be able to create high
quality modules in the classical or techno genre (a mix of these would be
highly rated), some theoretical knowledge about music would be preferable,
but if you just do great music then that's more than enough. Sound FX
artists must be able to create/sample realistic human and animal sounds
(footsteps, roars, breathing, etc.). Send examples of your work to LED.
   It is also possible that assistant graphics artists will be required, if
you're good at 3D rendering or 3D/2D animation, then send some examples of
your work to LED.

   As of this moment I cannot in anyway guarantee that the project will be
carried out. Only if the right people (YOU!) are found this project will be
started. If you're into it for the money, then don't bother writing, as it
will be highly unlikely that a great amount of money will come out of this
project. But if the game is finished, I can guarantee that you will at
least get some credit for having been in the development of producing one
of the best AMIGA games ever. If everything works out as it ought to the
game will be published by a software house or be sold via mail order.

   If you are (still) interested then don't hesitate, send your dream works
today...

@node 7 "Magic Digitz and Special Thanx"

                              --- Magic Digits ---

The release of WormOut2097 has been delayed for over a month due to that god
damn f*%¤#!g AMOS Compiler that just happened to go totally nuts and
crash my harddisk completely. Therefore a magic digit goes to

                                Francois Lionet

                             --- Special Thanks ---

But as there are jerks, there certainly are saviours and amongst them are

                                 Søren Jørvang

who supplied me with a spare harddisk, and then the boring part began,
namely copying all intact files from the smashed harddisk to the new one.
Which only took around 150 floppies and some 3 weeks. Then another few weeks
went by because I started my military services, but now finally I have the
game finished, and I certainly hope you enjoy it a million times as much as
enjoyed finishing it.
