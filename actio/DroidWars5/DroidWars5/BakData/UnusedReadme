1: nickname "Roach"

   Has no weapons,
   but it will divide into 2
   every time it is hit by a bullet.
    The armour will however decline
   with each divide.

   Some debris will be thrown out with each divide.

   This type of droid has little power
   so if it doesn't get hit by an enemy bullet
   for a long time, it will die due to
   a power shortage.

   They are very light
   and often have different engines.
