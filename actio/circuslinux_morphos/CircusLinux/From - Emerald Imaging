V1.0 - Oct. 18 2003

This is a MorphOS port of CircusLinux which is
based on the original "Circus Atari", a classic
Atari2600 game.

The original CircusLinux is from the Linux
environment (obviously) ;) and uses SDL plus
several other additional SDL based libraries.

To play just double click the icon and use your
mouse to navigate and bounce the clowns up to
pop all the balloons. Don't let them fall down
or it's over!

Have fun :)
