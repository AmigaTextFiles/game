More info about this game is found in the enclosed Docs/README.txt document.


RUNNING THE GAME - OS3

Just open a shell and type 'Entombed' to get started. You can also start 
by clicking the game icon which starts the game in a window. 

If you start the game in a shell with 'Entombed -h' you can see all the flags
that are available. Starting with 'Entombed -f' starts the game in full screen
mode. 

Some advice: You start with the power of building/breaking a wall 3 times, to 
get more power, find some potions in the maze. Beware of the ghouls and zombies 
walking around... Good luck!
