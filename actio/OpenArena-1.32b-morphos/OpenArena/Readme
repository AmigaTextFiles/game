This is OpenArena for MorphOS.

REQUIREMENTS:
 - At least 256MB of memory
 - TinyGL version 50.9
 - Supported 3D hardware
 - about 280MB free hard disk space

MISC: I (Marcel "frostwork" Unbehaun") simply hacked in the
      openarena changes from the originalcode into 
      Mark Olsens mighty MorphOS port.
      The final diff can be found also in this archive (oa.diff.gz)
      Even this Readme is a ripoff of Mark Olsens original readme,
      which is also included in this archive.

INSTALLATION:
Download the original openarena from http://www.openarena.ws/
and extract the baseoa directory into this OpenArena dir.

USAGE:
To start OpenArena, simply doubleclick the icon.

This distribution also includes the dedicated server for OpenArena. It has no
icon, but should be started and controlled from a shell.

The dedicated server will not accept any client connections till you load a
map, and thus will appear not to function if you don't load one. Loading a map
is done by typing the map command followed by a mapname into the server
console. Example: map q3dm1
