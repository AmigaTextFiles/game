       =============================================================

 Heikki  Kosola gave me a permission to release his  TurboRaketti II as a full
public version.  He would also release the source,  but it was lost due a very
missfortunate HD  crash when making backups! Anyway, I think  that questions &
stuff should be directed to me instead of the author, as  he doesn't even have
a  proper amiga anymore. I can forward the useful stuff to him. 

 TurboRaketti is a  fast and furious 2-player gravity game, and it you haven't
yet tried it, now's your change!

 I'm very sorry for the finnish localization. Feel free to try  to localize it
to english! A great deal of the "texts" are stored as bitmaps, which makes the
task pretty hard. Atleast it is for me. If you can do it, please  let me know!

 I'm also sorry for this absurd  format, but as the game  runs  perfectly on a
stock/vanilla 512k CHIP OCS A500, it's easier to have a disk image around. The
problem is that Aminet won't accept DMS archives, so I had do make some stupid
tricks. So the LHA has fully runable "HD" version on the  game and a imagefile
of the actual  TurboRaketti  II  disk. I  really suggest  that you execute the
install  script, as it will create a self-booting gamedisk. I always play from
a floppy disk, as we use the same TurboRanking file on many machines. So we
have one "official" disk which is used almost always. This disk image won't be
of any use for UAE losers. Sorry for that too. And thanks to Karl J. Ots.

 Very basic instructions:

  a) Run the install script and create the game disk.
  b) Kill your opponent & survive.
  c) Use 2 joysticks.
  d) Don't Write-Protect the disk.
  e) Press ESC to quit when lauched from the WorkBench.
  f) Try to handle with the finnish localization .
  g) Visit the official homepages at http://personal.inet.fi/bailu/zuulikuuli
  h) Harddisk installation simply by copying the files to your desired path.
