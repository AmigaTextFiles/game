                        28 october 1992
                and a little fix this 8 March 1997... see <<-×××->>


                    
This game was realised with the great AMOS (v1.34) on A500+ by Mvt-Man.
<< Now it's compiled on an A1200 with AmosPro... >>

It works with 1Mb.(But now everybody has got 1Mb,no?) 
<<It was right in 1992, and now in 1997, it's always right...>>


                   *** BEFORE STARTING ***

<< You should modify the file Nautilus_script to set the speed of
the game. Higher is the value, slower is the game. On my A1200 + fast,
a value of 2500 is fine, so the line become :
   Nautilus 2500
That's all, sorry for any convenience... 
You must have the AMOS.library in LIBS: ! >>



                       *** THE GAME ***

It requires some reflection,a good joystick(to slalom some times!),and
perhaps some training ...



The game contains 40 levels.

In each level,you must collect all the amphorae with your submarine.
As you can't stop where you want,you must use the vegetation or the wall.
If you can't pass,use one bomb.But be carefull not to use too much !
Each the 50 pots,you win some bombs.
All of this,would be very easy,but there are some fishes to avoid...

There are also big monsters in levels 10,20,30 and 40.


Nautilus can save the high score on disk ! <<Or your hard-disk,of course>>


Use the joystick to play.
On the keyboard :
   P >>> PAUSE
 ESC >>> ABORT (When you don't have any bombs...) 

With 3 lives can you succeed this game ?.

                       **** UPDATES ****


  -> Version 1.2 :    + I have added digits.
     -------------    + Some pots were cut sometimes,now then aren't.
                      + The presentation wasn't very good ... I modified it
                        and now it's better!
                      + The test when you take the pots wasn't very good,
                        now it's little better . But why not make a correct
                        routine of testing? Because it's slacken the prog!
                      + At the GAME OVER,you can see now in which level you
                        lose.
                      + And there are 40 levels.
                      + There is a little music when you begin (made by
                        myself !)


   -> Version 1.3 :   + The version 1.2 doesn't work with only 512 Ko of  
      -------------     chip memory(and of course 512 of fast). As all the 
      28 October 92     AMIGA 500. 
                        I decided to modify the prog. 
                        Nothing astonished because in some part of the game
                        There was 3 screens (320x200) of 32 colours opened!
                        40 Ko * 3 = 120 Ko !
                        Now,at the maximun there is a screen of 32 colours
                        and a screen of 2 colours (40+8=48 Ko !) opened at
                        the same time.
                      + With the little music the bosses didn't say "Kill me
                        boy !" at the start.Now this problem is the past !


   -> Version 1.4 :   + After a long wait behind a lot of old disks, my  
      -------------     sister, found 'Nautilus' and decided to play it 
    << 8 March 97 >>    back. The last time, she had played, it was on
                        A500 (68000 at 7.14 Mhz, do you remember?). And
                        on the A1200 (28 Mhz + Fast Ram), it was totally
                        impossible to play... too much fast! So fastly,
                        I introduce a bad loop in the prog, to slow down...
                        (with a Wait Vbl, it was very slow! and I didn't
                        wanted to pass a lot of time on it (remember my
                        sister wanted playing...) So, voilà !
                        To set the speed, gice a numer in the command
                        line, 2500 is ok for me...
                      + A lot of fix for speed in a lot of subroutines
                        (it was one of my first program, so don't blame
                         me when I was young...)
                      + I decided to release this on Aminet, just because
                        my sister and me have a lot of fun to play this
                        game (5 years later), so why not you ?!
