F.A.Q.
======

What game changes does DevilutionX provide?

DevilutionX's main focus is to make the game work on multiple platforms. 
An additional goal is to make the engine mod friendly. As such, there are no changes to gameplay, 
but we will be making some enhancements to the engine itself. For example, the engine now has upscaling and 
unlocked fps.

Is 1080p supported?

Currently the game simply scales the original 640x480 to best fit, but we are working on widescreen support.

What about Hellfire?

Hellfire is being worked on and is mostly done, though not fully playable at the moment.

Does it work with Battle.net?

Battle.net is a service provided by Blizzard. We are not associated with them, 
so we have not worked on integrating with their service.

Requirements
============

For smooth gameplay an Amiga with Vampire accelerator is recommended.
