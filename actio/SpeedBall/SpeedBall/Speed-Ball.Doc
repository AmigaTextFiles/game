Speed-Ball has lost his FORTY pieces of gold!     Do You think you

could help him recover it?

All you have to do is travel round the rooms and collect it.

Oh... there is just a couple of things you should know, some of the

rooms are locked so you will have to find the keys to open the doors

first....and one other thing someone has left nasty looking canisters

lying around so take care!

                       ________________________

Control Speed-Ball using a joystick,  you can only move up or down.

Pressing 'P' will pause the game and pressing 'M' will toggle the

music ON/OFF.
