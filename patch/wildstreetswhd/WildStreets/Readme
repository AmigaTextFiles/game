That patch applies to Wild Streets (c) 1989 Titus.

You will have to install it with that install to run it from hd.
That install needs WHDLoad and The Patcher 1.05 in the path (eg in c:).

Fixed:  Odd-address-error-exception, runs now on 68020+.
        Display problems with left edge of screen.

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.
Default trainer key is numerical ] (Quitkey-2). Pressing it toggles the
energy loss.

Note:    Once you used the trainer the game wont save highscores this
           run-time anymore.

Comment: That one had a funny comment to its protection, let me quote:
         'I call this protection: HACKERS NIGHTMARE V1.01!
          Do you think it is a good name?
          Anyway, if you succeed to hack it
          Call me, send me a proof, and you will win the big price !
          The price this time is 15000 Pounds !!!!
          So, if you are good enough... talk to you soon'
         - Seems as if i am some years too late (The protection wasnt
           that hard, but a bit better than the usual Rob-Northen-ones...)
         In the first levels its a nice game, but later it becomes way
           too hard *sigh*.

The install is tested with 2 MB on an A1200, and on an 18 MB 68030.

Disclaimer: Although i try to make my installs as reliable as possible, you 
          use them wholly on your own risk.
