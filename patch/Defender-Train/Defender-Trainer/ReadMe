Short:    Trainer for Defender of the Crown

Type:     game/patch
Requires: both disks with Defender game

This  is  a  trainer for very old (1986?) game Defender of the Crown. It is
two floppy disks game for A500. I tried to install it to HDD and play it on
A1200  but  it  crashes.  So  I  decided  to write some starter for it. The
starter was changed by time into trainer for this game.

Defender versions
=================
I found out two (for the present) different versions of defender code.  One
version  is  83832  bytes  long  and  the  second  is 81236 bytes long (not
crunched).   Please,  if  you  find  out  some  different  version  of file
"defender",  e-mail  it  to me (e-mail addr is in the end of this document)
and  I  will  improve  the trainer for this version too.  The first version
(83832  bytes  long)  has the df0:  test, so it wasn't able to play it from
other devices. Trainer fixes this problem - see 2) below.

Trainer has two main functions:
1) trains the game (see TRAINER DESCRIPTION below)
2) fixes  df0:  test,  so  the  game  is  playable  from  any volumes named
   Defender1: and Defender2:

Because  of  the game is very old, any patches and AGA are not suitable for
good functionality.  From  this reason I decided to make the running of the
game  via small RAD disk with own startup-sequence to avoid any patches and
AGA and the game will automatically run in PAL mode with normal ECS sprites
-  it  is  good.  I tried it under DBLNTSC and some graphics errors appears
during the tournament's running horse...

INSTALLATION
============
I  definitely  recommend  to  install  the game with install script in this
package.  Installation  is  very simple and safe. Installer only copies all
needfull files  from  both disks and copies new files from this archive and
makes its own startup-sequence for its own RAD disk. No modification of any
file on your HDD.
You  will  be  asked  for  place, where do you want to install the game.  A
drawer  'Defender of the Crown' will be automatically created (please don't
install  the  game  into  RAM  disk:   because it is cleared after reset of
Amiga).    Now  you  will  be  gradualy  asked  for  disk  'Defender1'  and
'Defender2'.   If  everything goes well, a message 'Installation complete!'
appears.  If you can see a message about length of file "defender", please:
***************************************************************************
          REALLY MAKE SURE THAT THE FILE "defender" IS NOT PACKED
         IF IT IS, PLEASE UNPACK IT IMMEDIATELY AFTER INSTALLATION
***************************************************************************
You  can  do  it for example by xfddecrunch.  Versions ,I tested, was 83832
and  81236 bytes length.  Reason is, that the trainer loads "defender" file
into  memory  and  ALL  MODIFICATIONS  ARE  MADE  ONLY  IN MEMORY.  This is
clearest  way  to train games - no modifications in original files.  If the
"defender"  file  stays packed or modified by another way, trainer will not
be  able  to  train  the  game  and  error  message  appears (see "Defender
versions" above).  But let us go back to installation.  If any error occurs
while  installation,  all  already  installed  data  will be uninstalled (I
hope).  The installation of game will require about 1.6 MB of HDD's space.

STARTING
========
As  I  wrote  above the start of the game requires RAD disk and reseting of
Amiga. After reset of Amiga the trainer should appears.

TRAINER DESCRIPTION
===================
I   tried   to   make   the   comfortable   controlling   of   the  trainer
(gadtools.library  is  used).  I also tried to use maximum of data directly
from game's data files to minimize trainer file length.  Trainer is written
100%  in  assembler using GenAm+CygnusEd.
Here is the list of all controlling items and their description:

CHARACTER  -  selects  the  character you want to edit. "Playable" or "Only
CPU"  messages  tells  you if you can play the character or if it is played
only by computer. Each character has its own editable properties:

  LEADERSHIP, JOUSTING, SWORDPLAY, WARLIKENESS - you can set the quality of
  these properties from WEAK to STRONG,

  WARLIKENESS - I don't exactly know what this property does. I tried it
  for a long time and here is what I found out:
  When the WARLIKENESS is in the lowest value for other players, they:
  1) seems not to attack so often as usually
  2) attack with lower number of soldiers and knights
  3) leaves a very little number of mens in their home castles,

  TREASURE ON START - each character get this value (in gold) on start of
  the game (range 0-127).

Next gadgets, buttons etc. and its values are for all players the same:
COST PRICES: - there are seven string gadgets:
SOLDIER     - price of one soldier,
5xSOLDIER   - price of 5 soldiers bought by right mouse button (RMB),
CATAPULT    - price of one catapult,
KNIGHT      - price of one knight,
5xKNIGHT    - price of 5 knights bought by RMB,
CASTLE      - price of one castle,
TOURNAMENT  - price of tournament.
(all ranges are 0-255)
NOTE: ALL STRING VALUES IN TRAINER YOU MUST CONFIRM BY ENTER OR TAB KEY!

MAP  OF  ENGLAND  -  you can click on any territory on the map and its name
appears  below  "Territory:".   Now  you  can  edit  two values for desired
territory:

  GOLD PER MONTH - value of gold you get from this territory every month,

  VASSALS - number of mens (soldiers) you get when this territory was not
  owned yet and you take it to your ownership.
  (both ranges are 0-127)

That's all 'training' values.

DEFAULTS - resets all values to original values.

START - starts the game. Be patient while loading, some screens appears for
a  longer  time  and  some for a very little time - game was programmed for
floppy  disk  loading.  When the "CHOOSE A CHARACTER" screen appears please
don't take a care of character's LEADERSHIP, JOUSTING and SWORDPLAY values.
This  is only picture and the values set by you in the trainer will be used
in the game.
By  the  way:   When  I  tested  the  trainer for good setting of values of
LEADERSHIP, JOUSTING and SWORDPLAY I found, that the value of SWORDPLAY for
Cedric  of  Rotherwood  is  AVERAGE  on  screen "CHOOSE A CHARACTER" but in
reality the value is WEAK!  It is bug in the picture not in the trainer.

QUIT  -  quits  the trainer and resets computer and RAD disk, so your Amiga
should starts normally.

End of trainer's functions description.

The  trainer  is  suitable  for  A1200  with  HDD.  I  tested  it on A1200,
MC68030/68882/50,16 MB FAST RAM, HDD.

Thanks SLAM for testing, reminders, checked icons and the second version of
defender code.
