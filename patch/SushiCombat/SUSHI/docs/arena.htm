Intro<BR>
-----<BR>
Rocket Arena is an interesting new twist to traditional deathmatch.<BR>

It is a strictly one-on-one game with "winner stays, loser goes" type rotation.<BR>

It is designed both to improve deathmatch skills and be a kick butt patch to boot.<BR>

How to Play<BR>

-----------<BR>



Once connected to a Rocket Arena server, the gameplay is totally automated.<BR>

You are put at the end of a line, and wait for your turn to fight in the arena.<BR>

Your position in line is the ammo count on your status bar.<BR>

Alternatively, you can use the "position" impulse (69) to find out how many people

are ahead of you.<BR>



You can take the time in line to watch other matches, and learn valuble tactics.<BR>

Your "health" and "armor" status bars now show the health of the two competitors<BR>

(look for their names above the status bar to figure out which is which).<BR>

Currently, two impulses control the placement of the statusbar names:<BR>

Impulse 71 : the default, use for 320x200 fullscreen<BR>

Impulse 72 : use for 320x240 windowed, or 640x480 windowed<BR>



For higher resolutions, use impulse 72. DO NOT switch to a lower resolution<BR>

without first going back to impulse 71. Doing so will crash Quake.<BR>

If none of the above made sense, ignore it.<BR>



Should you need to take a short break (grab some food, relieve your self, get an icq
message)<BR>
simply type "impulse 70"<BR>
You will be given up to a 5 minute break. Type "impulse 70" again when you are ready to

return.<BR>
 If you do not return within two minutes, you will be disconnected.<BR>
 You will

be warned as the time drains down.<BR>
 You can NOT use impulse 70 if you are already

in the Arena.<BR>




When it is your turn to fight, you will be put in the Arena and given 200 armor,<BR>
100 health, and a full weapon complement.<BR> A 10 second timer will start.<BR>
 When it

says FIGHT! kill or be killed.<BR>



"TWO MEN ENTER, ONE MAN LEAVES"<BR>



That is the only rule (other than that, it works mostly like normal Quake)<BR>



If you win.. you will stay to fight again.. if you lose.. the back of the line for you.<BR><BR>
