 When testing Gloom3 I never came across any bugs. It all worked fine, but then
 once I released demo's onto the AmiNet there were hundreds of people downloading
 the demo everyday. This mean't that it was being played by a much wider audience
 than my 3 test Amiga's. I decided to write this document to outline some of the
 problems people are having, and how to solve them.

 When playing Gloom3 (or the demo) make sure you have ran the installer and the
 'Setup' program. Then you should reboot. Make sure you have atleast 1.3 meg
 Chip Ram, preferably more by reducing the screenmode & colours etc of your
 Workbench.

 In the setup select either the c2p routine for you processor or the 'default-ze'
 one. Once the setup is correct save it, you can always mess around with the setup
 later if it still doesn't work.

 Right, now click the Gloom3 icon and it *should* load up. If it does then start the
 game and play it. If when you begin the game there are lots of colours on the
 screen each time you fire the gun, or constantly, then you will need to reboot and
 try again. keep trying until you get it working (It is a rare bug normally).

 If none of this works and you still cant get the game to work then try this DOS
 method. 'cd' your way to the directory like this :-

 CD Games:Gloom_3/

 then type this exactly :-

 gloom2

 The game should load up. It will bypass some checking etc which is done by other
 files and hopefully work!...

 ECS users try 'Extra Half Bright' mode in the screenmode section. Cybergraphics
 users try it in a 256 col screen for best performance.

 If however it still doesn't work then read the section in the guide about 'problems'.
 If if all else fails eMail gazy@globalnet.co.uk and ask for help giving details of
 your setup and software etc.

 Gloom3 is normally a very stable game, and if you are having trouble with it then
 I'm very sorry. But I hope you can solve these problems using this text. What I will
 say is that it was really designed for machines which 2meg chip ram (A1200/A4000) &
 some fast ram aswell as a standard accelerator (Blizzard/Apollo). It does support
 lots of types of Gfx cards and screenmodes etc, but I dont know how well because I
 myself have an A1200Tg 040/25/25 + 34Meg Ram. It has been thoroughly tested but my
 knowledge of early Amiga's such as A1000/3000/1500 etc is limited :).

 *NOTE* if you have any tips on how to get Gloom 3 working on your particular setup
 or piece of hardware then please eMail me them! You'll be credited in this doc.
