                     Gloom 3 "Ultimate Gloom" official Patch (v0.2)
                     ---------~--------~--------------------

  This is a patch to fix the 'Crash on returning to Wb' bug in Gloom 3. Some users
  complained about this bug and I am sure that it wasn't there when released but
  hey who cares its fixed now ;-).

  It also contains some text on running Gloom 3 on different CPU's and Chip Sets.

  Simply drag the 'G3_load' Icon to ANY directory of your Hard drive and double
  click it. IF you have the Commercial 'Ultimate Gloom' then it should work
  perfectly. The advantage of this patch means you can put the icon anywhere on
  your hardrive and you dont have to open the CD icon. You will only need about 1k
  of space to drag the icon to.

  For those of you who want to solve this bug on demo's of Gloom3 or other versions
  (hmmm!) which may be floating around, fire up your text editor and change the path
  way in the script to the pathway where you have Gloom 3 installed, simple as that!
 

   WATCH OUT FOR DETAILS OF THE FORTHCOMING 'GLOOM 3 - THE DIRECTORS CUT' SOON...


  *NOTE* if you have any tips on how to get Gloom 3 working on your particular setup
  or piece of hardware then please eMail me them! You'll be credited in this doc.
  Also eMail me if this patch worked or didnt work, so I can make a new one!
