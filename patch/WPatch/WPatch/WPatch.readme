WPatch v1.1
-----------

1.1 What is it?

It is made to patch `WENDETTA 2175`; the patch makes
it possible to run the game without rebooting/bugs on
a Amiga 1200+CD-Rom-system.

1.2 How to install?

(AUTOMATICALLY) There is program called `INSTALL_WPatch`; run
 it to install `WPatch` in your C-path.
(MANUALLY) Just copy `WPatch` to your C-path.

1.3 How to use?

(1) Reboot your Amiga using the magic-keys(CTRL-A-A)!
(2) Hold down both mouse buttons
(3) Disable the cpu-caches in the `Boot-Options`-menu
(4) `Boot with no Startup-Sequence`
(5) Go to shell and type `WPatch` 
(6) Type `EndCli >NIL:` 
(7) Insert the `WENDETTA 2175`-CD in your CD-Drive
(8) Run your game as usual(double-click the game-icon)...

1.4 How to get the code-tables?

In shell/cli, just type in `WPatch >RAM:TXT`. Now view the file:
`More RAM:TXT`. There will be a "section" called `code-tables`.

1.5.2 How to get in touch with THOR/CHIPS
