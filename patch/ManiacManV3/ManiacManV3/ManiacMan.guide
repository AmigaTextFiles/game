@node OVER "ManiacMan V3 Overview"

 ManiacMan was written for a comfortable way to patch savegames. The
 principle is to load a file into memory, change some values and write
 it back to disk - like a hexeditor (AZap or similar) does. But
 ManiacMan does this automatically by using patchfiles for certain
 games, where the addresses and values are stored in.

 The disadvantage is that files can only be patched if the money (etc)
 is always stored in the same position. Games which encode their saves or
 move values can't be patched. Those games are rare, but they exist :(

 ManiacMan offers 5 different patchfile-formats (for identification only),
 Crack, Fix, Savegame, Trainer and Random patches. They all do the same at
 the moment :)

 - Crack patches remove the copyprotection from games
 - Fix patches are used for changing certain values to make programs
   HD/AGA/PAL etc fixed
 - Savegame patches do what they're paid for :)
 - Trainer patches are used to patch a game (not a savegame)
 - Random patches are for future compatibility (or anything else than
   the above)


 WARNING!!!

 Make backups of your savegames before patching them for the first time.
 If one patch doesn't work (maybe you've got another version of the game)
 it's better to have a copy. In this case, please email me!!!

 WARNING!!!


 ManiacMan (the executable) is SUPPORTWARE, so spread it like hell, but
 don't change the code or anything else. If you like and use it you're
 asked to send me some savegames or patch files (new ones, of course).

 UFO(AGA)Cheater (the executable) is FREEWARE, so use and spread it like hell,
 but don't change the code or anything else.


 ALWAYS CHECK FOR ViRUS-iNFECTiON!

@node INST "ManiacMan Installation"

 I'm working on an installer script...

 Copy the font (lucypaz) to your FONTS directory and the ManiacMan-drawer
 to any place on your HD. That should do the job :)

@node USAG "ManiacMan Usage"

 I think the program is self-explaining ;)
 You'll get more information here when it's needed.

@node HILL "Hillsea Lido"

The savegames are stored in Hillsea Lido's -S- -drawer. The name is
xMSAV-3 where x is the save position (1MSAV-3 if you saved at position 1
by pressing F1).

@endnode

@node SBII "Speedball II"

Speedball II saves a game to the bootblock of the savedisk. You'll have
to save the bootblock to a file (1024 bytes) to make use of this patch,
and write it back to the disk afterwards. There are many tools available
for this work (most virus-killers have an option to save the BB).

If you've got SB2 installed to HD, you won't have this problem :)


@endnode

@node UFOA "UFO - Enemy Unknown AGA"

I've added my UFOagaCheater program to the archive.

Usage: UFOagaCheater <option>

options are:   M  - gives you $100Mio.
               S  - powers up all your soldiers

Only use one option at a time.

This is for the old 4-disk-version of UFO. I don't think anything has
changed with the new 5-disk-version.
