INSTALLATION
------------

If you installed pnpatapi, revert to IDE-fix.

1. Copy all the files to the T0 directory on your hard drive.
   Note that T-zer0_custom will need to be overwritten.  That's OK.

2. Run T-zer0Update
   (this will patch your T-zer0 executable)

3. If everything went fine the date of the T-zer0 executable should 
   be set to Today, and from that point on you can run the game 
   the same way you did before (by doubleclicking the T-zer0 icon)
