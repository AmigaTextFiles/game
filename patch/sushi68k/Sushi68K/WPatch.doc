  SYNOPSIS

    wpatch source-file destination-file wdelta-file

  DESCRIPTION

    WPatch applies the wdelta-file onto the source-file and creates the
    destination-file. The source-file is verified by an crc16-sum which is
    contained in the wdelta-file to be equal to the original file the wdelta-
    file has been created for. The resulting destination-file is also verified
    by an crc16-sum. On success WPatch writes the destination-file.

  OPTIONS

    source-file
      source file which should be converted into the destination-file

    destination-file
      file which should be created based on the source-file

    wdelta-file
      differences file created by WDelta

  RESULTS

    On success WPatch writes the destination-file and returns with a return
    code equal zero. Any other return code indicates an failure.
    The following list describes all possible return codes:
      0 .. success
      1 .. wdelta-file is not a wdelta file
      2 .. chksum error in wdelta file
      3 .. wrong source-file
      4 .. error in applying wdelta file
      5 .. chksum error in wdelta file
