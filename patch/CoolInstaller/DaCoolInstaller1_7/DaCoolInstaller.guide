@node "efiles" "Example DCI files"
@{b}Example DCI files@{ub}

  In the drawer Demos/ you`ll find two example .DCI files that
  I`ve created for you with Da Cool Installer:

  Another World: 2 disk game, uses EmulateECS
  Crazy Cars III: 2 disk game, uses EmulateECS

  Perhaps I`ll going to add some more examples in the future. But
  you can create them easy by yourself...why shall I create them
  then ;) ....?

  Okay, so if you want to install them -> simply doubleclick the
  install icon.

  To use DCI files, you need to be registered of course.

                                Version 3.8

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

  MUI  is  an object oriented system to create and maintain graphical user
  interfaces.  From  a programmers point of view, using MUI saves a lot of
  time  and  makes life much easier. Thinking about complicated terms like
  window resizing or font sensitivity is simply not neccesary.

  On  the  other hand, users of MUI based applications have the ability to
  customize  nearly every pixel of a programs interface according to their
  personal taste.

  Please click on the Install-MUI icon to install MUI on your system or to
  update from previous versions.  Latest news and support  can be found on
  Internet at www.sasg.com.

                                ***********

@node "prefs" "Da Cool Installer Preferences"
@{b}Da Cool Installer Preferences@{ub}

  After massive request I`m finally able to present the Da Cool
  Installer Preferences editor (DCIP). Okay, what`s this now? Let me
  explain it with a simple example:  

  Imagine you`ve installed a game with DCI and after the start
  you see that the game has graphical errors. Now you need to
  emulate the ECS chipset. In previous versions you had to
  install the game completely new and select EmulateECS during
  the installation. Now you only need to start the Prefs
  Editor and select the EmulateECS option.

  That was only one example. There`re alot of things possible
  with the DCIP.

  DCIP comes with a full fontsensitive @{"MUI" link "MUI"} GUI.
  If you haven`t installed MUI yet, get it from Aminet (util/libs/MUI3.8usr.lha)
  or Internet: http://www.sasg.com. DCIP requires at least
  MUI3.8.
  
  Although DCIP features bubble help, I'll explain all buttons
  here:

  Path: If you`ve moved the game to an other
        place on your harddisk, you need to
        change the path here too. Otherwise
        the game won`t work.

  EmulateECS: Select this gadget if the game shall 
              run in ECS mode. This is most useful
              for old A500 games.

  Da Cool Booter: Set this to yes, if you wanna use Da
  		  Cool Booter for booting. You need a
  		  registered version of Da Cool Booter
  		  of course!

  Trackdisk.device: If Da Cool Installer has found the
  		    trackdisk.device in a game during the
  		    installation, you can switch the emulation
 		    on or off!

  Save: Saves the current settings. Exit and you can run
        the game with the new settings.

  About: Shows some information about the program.

  Exit: no comment

@endnode

@node "key" "The keyfile"
@{b}The keyfile@{ub}

  The keyfile must be copied to devs:. If Da Cool Installer finds the
  keyfile on your harddisk, all disabled features are automatically
  enabled. Then you can fully use Da Cool Installer!

  You'll get the keyfile by sending US$15 or 20DM and the filled in
  @{"Registration form" link "register"} to @{"me" link "autor"}.
 
  It isn`t allowed to spread the keyfile! Your complete address is saved
  in your keyfile. Spreaded keyfiles are software piracy!

@endnode

@node "wasmacht" "Introduction"
@{b}Introduction@{ub}

  dA cOOL iNSTALLER (DCI) installs nearly every standard Amiga
  game/demo on your harddisk.

  DCI has powerful features. If the game/demo is ECS, DCI degrades 
  the computer to ECS.
 
  DCI can install games/demos with more than one disk too.

  Even trackdisk.device is no problem for DCI. With my trackdisk.device
  emulation DOS games using trackdisk.device should run fine from HD.
 
  ...and the best of all. You don`t need any programming skills!

  Installing a game/demo is as easy as possible.
  See how @{"easy" link "install"} it is.

  Note: You cannot install games only with Da Cool Installer. You can
        install all what you want (Demos, Utilties, Applications...)

  Da Cool Installer is (C) Copyright 1997-2000 by Andreas Falkenhahn.

  You may spread the demo version as you want, but it is absolutely
  forbidden to spread the full version or the keyfile. Furthermore,
  if you are a public domain distributor, it's not allowed to sell
  the demo version for more than 5 DM (3 US$).

  This program is @{"Shareware" link "cardware"}. If you use it and enjoy it please

  To register, please fill in the @{"Registration form" link "register"}, print it and send it to @{"me" link "autor"}.

  Da Cool Installer must distributed with all files on the disk apart from

  as a disk or LHA/LZX archive. 

  If Da Cool Installer is distributed on a Cover CD/Disk, I would like to get
  a free copy of the magazine. Thank you.

@node "System" "System Requirements"
@{b}System requirements@{ub}

  To use dA cOOL iNSTALLER you'll need at least an Amiga (oh, can`t I use
  it on PeeZee ?) with harddisk and OS2.04. I heard that Da Cool Installer
  runs on WinUAE too but you should use it on Amiga ;)

  dA cOOL iNSTALLER should be compatible up to A4000/060. It was successfully
  tested on A1200/030, A1200/040, A4000/040. I think there shouldn`t
  be any problems on higher machines. Let me know if there are.

  dA cOOL iNSTALLER requires also the reqtools.library (© by Niço François)
  in libs:. I`ve stored it in the dA cOOL iNSTALLER`s dir in libs/. Too
  bad that Niço quit the scene :-(

  For the recommended installation of dA cOOL iNSTALLER you'll need the tool
  NewInstaller. Get it on Aminet (util/wb/NewInstaller.lha) or on our homepage
  http://www.airsoftsoftwair.de/.

  Additionally you must have the Workbench installed on your harddisk and
  boot with it.

@endnode

@node "install" "Installing things"
@{b}Installing a game/demo/program/whatever@{ub}

  It`s so easy.......

  I`ll explain it to you in three simple steps:

  1) Start dA cOOL iNSTALLER
  2) Select the destination path
  3) Insert a game or demo disk in DF0:

  THAT WAS IT! ALL IS DONE! Now start the game/demo and @{"register" link "register"}.


  If you're a registered user, you can select some more options
  during the installation procedure:

  1) Select game format: DOS:  The most used format on Amiga! The most games,
                               demos, programs use it. Da Cool Installer`s
                               DOS support is great. It works for nearly all
                               games!

                         DMS:  This is a packed disk format. The unpacked
 			       DMS disk needs to be in DOS format. NDOS isn`t
			       supported in this case yet!

  2) Select diskdrive to use: DF0: This is the standard Amiga internal inbuild
				   floppydrive! Select this if you haven`t any
				   external drives.

 			      DF1: This is an external drive.

 			      DF2: This is an external drive too.


  3) Do you wanna use EmulateTrackdisk.device Option? Yes: Select this if you`re
							   sure that the game
							   uses trackdisk.device.
							   Da Cool Installer checks
							   all files then and tries
							   to find files which use
 							   trackdisk.device. If it
							   finds one you can let
							   it patch. If you`re not
							   sure if the game uses
							   trackdisk.device you can
							   of course let DCI check
							   if it finds one.

						       No: Don`t use the option. 

  4) Do you wanna use EmulateECS Option? Yes: Select this if the game you wanna
					      install is an old A500 game and has
					      problems with running on higher
					      machines. Never use it with AGA
					      games!!

     					 No:  Don`t use this option.

  5) Do you wanna use Da Cool Booter for booting? Yes: Select this if the game needs
						       the full 2MB Chip RAM or if it
						       doesn`t like Setpatch. Note: You
                                                       need Da Cool Booter for this
                                                       option. You can get Da Cool Booter
                                                       from Aminet.

   						  No:  Don`t use this option.

  6) Shall I create a .DCI file for you? Yes: This creates a .DCI file for the currently
					      installed game. See @{"here" link "dci"} for more
					      information about .DCI files.

					 No:  Don`t create a .DCI file.
 

@endnode

@node "dci" "The .DCI install files"
@{b}The DCI install files@{ub}

  From Version 1.5 on Da Cool Installer can create .DCI files for you.
  
  Let me explain what a .DCI file is good for....For example you just
  installed Crazy Cars III successfully with Da Cool Installer and then
  select the option that Da Cool Installer creates a .DCI file for you.

  Now you have the .DCI for example in RAM:. If you doubleclick it now
  you can install Crazy Cars III again - but much easier - you have
  only to insert the disks and select the destination. No more options
  will appear!
  
  You can create .DCI files for your favourite games and spread them
  around (Aminet etc...). Some example files are supplied in the Demos/
  directory!  
  
@endnode
   
@node "option" "Starting a game/demo"
@{b}Starting an installed game@{ub}

  Simply doubleclick the icon.

  If the game doesn`t start, there`re several possibilities why,

  1) the game/demo uses a trackdisk loader, then use Trackdisk.device emulation
     (only registered version)
  2) the game/demo must be degraded (only @{"registered" link "register"} version
  3) the game/demo uses a non-standard loader, these can`t be installed generally
  4) other error !?

 The fullversion (=@{"keyfile" link "key"}) has a lot of really cool features:

 1. Install games/demos with more than 1 disk
 2. Don`t wait 1 min till the game/demo starts
 3. Degrade your computer for ECS games/demos
 4. Install non-bootable games/demos
 5. USE TRACKDISK.DEVICE EMULATION!!!
 6. Da Cool Booter interface
 7. Install DMS disks too
 8. Use .DCI files
 9. USE THE PREFERENCES PROGRAM!!!
 
 and more because of the future versions which run with the @{"keyfile" link "key"} undisabled,
