- AB3D II - The Killing Grounds Startscript    -
- including Savefiles for every level          -


 Using of the startscript
-------------------------

You can copy the script AB3DII-TKG.deu with it's
icon anywhere you want. Then you should make a new 
directory "original" in your TKG drawer and move
the contents of your TKG drawer in it.
Then you should copy the contents of the drawer
"AB3dIITKG" at my archiv in your TKG drawer.
In this drawer exists a dir called extra1. It contains
a german text_file. If you're not a german, that file 
has no meaning for you (DON'T COPY IT).
The contents of the prefs drawer copy to "SYS:Prefs",
that TKG running from WB without problems.

Now you should start an editor and load the script:

In the second line you must enter YOUR path to TKG.
In the two last lines you can start normally the game by
TKG or the TKGPatch (if you have it). You can get the
Patch on aminet. The options of the patch are running on
my system, but that must not be the same on your's.
Changing it, if necessary.

Now you can start the script and choose the level you want
to play. If you have no extra-level, then you can remove
this part.
The usage of the commands in the scriptfile you can get
at your Amiga-DOS manual or from me.

The savefiles i have get from a friend of me. If there
is a copyright on it, please forgive me the distribution.
