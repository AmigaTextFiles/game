INSTALLING THE TRAINER

    ***********************************
    *** Read the NOTES section NOW! ***
    ***********************************

    Workbench or CLI use.

    Installation is best handled by using the "Installer" program
    from Commodore, which should have been provided with your
    original system disks. It is also available from Aminet as:

    util/misc/Installer-43_3.lha
    (NB: the version number might have changed!)

    After installation is complete, you may delete the directory
    produced by extracting this archive ("AB3DTrainer").


    FROM WORKBENCH:
    ---------------
    Have you read the notes section yet?

    Extract all files in the archive to your system.
    They will be extracted to a drawer called "AB3DTrainer"

    Open the newly created "AB3DTrainer" drawer and double click on
    the "Install_AB3DTrainer" icon found there.

    Follow the instructions given to you by the Installer program:
    - all trainer and trainer-GUI related choices are *default* values
      only and may be changed after installation by editing the
      icon tooltypes of the "AB3DTrainer" program or using the
      trainer GUI.

    - when asked to select a directory to install AB3DTrainer in you
      should select the directory that you have AB3D installed in.


    FROM CLI/SHELL:
    ---------------
    Have you read the notes section yet?

    Extract all files in the archive to your system.
    They will be extracted to a directory called "AB3DTrainer"

    CD to the "AB3DTrainer" directory created when you extracted
    the acrhive.

    Type "Installer Install_AB3DTrainer" and press RETURN.

    Follow the instructions given to you by the Installer program:
    - when asked to select a "User Level" you *must* choose "Expert".

    - all trainer and trainer-GUI related choices you make will only
      apply if you start the AB3DTrainer program from Workbench. If
      you start the trainer program from CLI (or from a script) then
      these options will be ignored.

    - all trainer and trainer-GUI related choices are *default* values
      only and may be changed after installation by editing the
      icon tooltypes of the "AB3DTrainer" program or using the
      trainer GUI.

    - when asked to select a directory to install AB3DTrainer in you
      should select the directory that you have AB3D installed in.


CONFIGURING THE TRAINER

    Have you read the notes section yet?

    The AB3DTrainer program icon has a number of tooltypes which may be
    modified at any time to change the way in which it operates. Note that
    if you start the trainer from CLI then options saved in the program's
    tooltypes are ignored.


    "NOGUI"
    -------
    Specify this tooltype to disable the trainer GUI. If the GUI is
    disabled then the game will run with the default options specified
    in the other tooltypes.

    If the NOGUI tooltype is not present then the trainer GUI will appear.


    "INF_ENERGY"
    "INF_AMMO"
    ------------
    Specify any combination of these tooltypes to set the default state of
    the corresponding trainer. For example, if you specify the "INF_ENERGY"
    then the infinite energy trainer will default to being active.

    If any of the above tooltypes are not present, then the corresponding
    trainer will default to being inactive.


    "HACKAB3D"
    ----------
    Specify this tooltype to enable automatic support of the HackAB3D
    patch. If this tooltype is specified and the HackAB3D executable
    can be found at run time, then HackAB3D will be started.


    "CONTROL=[JOYSTICK|JOYPAD]"
    ---------------------------
    There is a problem with using joysticks and CD32 style joypads with
    Alien Breed 3D on certain Amiga models. If you cannot use a joystick
    or joypad to control Alien Breed 3D on your Amiga, specify this tooltype
    and set its value appropriately for the controller you intend to use.

    If you do not have trouble using a joystick or joypad, you should not
    specify this tooltype.

    If you specify the wrong value for this tooltype, eg: CONTROL=JOYSTICK
    for using a joypad, you may find that your controller will not work!


USING THE TRAINER

    Have you read the notes section yet? You really should...

    FROM WORKBENCH
    ==============

    From Workbench, open the drawer containing your AB3D game. There will
    be a new icon there entitled "AB3DTrainer". Double-click on this icon
    to start the trainer program.


    IF YOU OPTED TO USE THE TRAINER MENU
    ------------------------------------
    Read this if you did not specify "NOGUI" in the icon tooltypes.

    The trainer window will open allowing you to select the trainers you wish
    to use while playing the game. Initially all trainers are set to the default
    values specified in the program tooltypes.

    To activate a trainer, e.g.: Infinite ammo, you must click on the
    appropriate gadget. A checkmark (tick) will appear in the box beside
    any activated trainer; if the box is empty then the trainer is inactive.

    When you have selected the trainers you want, click the "Play" gadget in the
    lower left of the window. The game will now load and run if possible.

    If you started AB3D by mistake, or have changed your mind and do
    not want to play the game right now then click the "Cancel" gadget
    in the lower right of the window..


    IF YOU OPTED TO DISABLE THE TRAINER MENU
    --------------------------------------
    Read this if you did specify "NOGUI" in the icon tooltypes.

    The game will load and run if possible. No trainer window will appear.
    Active trainers will be determined from the default values as specified
    by the other tooltypes of the AB3DTrainer program.


    FROM CLI/SHELL
    ==============

    Change Directory to the directory you have Alien Breed 3D installed in.
    To start the trainer, type "AB3DTrainer" followed by the options you
    wish to activate. Note that if you start the trainer from CLI then
    options saved in the program's tooltypes are ignored.

    "NOGUI"
    "INF_ENERGY"
    "INF_AMMO"
    "HACKAB3D"
    "CONTROL=[JOYSTICK|JOYPAD]"
    ---------------------------
    These command line options correspond to the tooltypes described in
    the previous section.

    For example:

    AB3DTrainer NOGUI INF_ENERGY HACKAB3D

    would start Alien Breed 3D with the HackAB3D patch active and give
    the player infinite energy. The joystick/joypad compatibility patch
    would not be activated. No trainer GUI would appear.


NOTES

    The files "AB3DTrainer", "AB3DTBoot", "abd.pk" and (optionally) "abd"
    must all reside in the same directory in order for the trainer to function.
    Additionally, if you opt to use HackAB3D then the HackAB3D executable must
    also be present in this directory.

    The trainer automatically makes the assigns AB3D1: and AB3D2: required
    for the game. There is no need to make them manually or with a startup
    script.

    If requested, the trainer automatically starts HackAB3D for you. You
    should not start HackAB3D yourself (eg: in a script) if you intend to
    use this trainer option.

    If you set the Controller option to either "Force Joystick" or "Force
    Joypad" you must still press the "J" key in the game to activate
    joystick/joypad control.


TESTING INFORMATION

    Created on A1200/68030+68882-40Mhz/8Mb/KS39.106, but should run on
    any Amiga with enough RAM that the original AB3D would run on.

    Tested with both the original game as distributed by Team 17 and the
    patched version available from their web site, combined with HackAB3D
    version 1.00.

    If you have a problem running AB3DTrainer then I WANT TO KNOW! Please,
    feel free to get in touch.
