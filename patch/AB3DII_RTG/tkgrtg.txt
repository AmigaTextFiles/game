                Alien Breed 3D II TKG -- the RTG executable


To run it just run it instead of your normal TKG file, all assigns and
TKG datafiles must be in place, like Doom this is just the executable.
Rename TKG to TKG-old and rename tkgrtg to TKG, do not run any of the
speedup patches people have created, I've heard they don't work with
this.

You need RTG Master, AHI and 18mb ram minimum I'm told, and on a
Cyberstorm 060 with a Cybervision3D setup it can apparently get 24fps.


Have fun!
