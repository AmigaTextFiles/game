Gloom Deluxe with ECS Amiga With CyberGFX in FULL AGA colour!

The GREAT game Gloom Deluxe by Black Magic has one problem for ECS CyberGfx users...
Your STILL in ECS colour mode!

But... After a few minutes playing with the config files looking for a way to promote the gloom
serial device (with no luck. Hard Coded) I started wondering what them two 0's in the config file
did... So, I changed them to 1's and got full colour!  After waking up, I narowed it down to line
10.


To make the adjustment...

In your Gloom Directory you'll see the file  Gloomcfg  .
Using a normal text editor (ED works fine)
Simply count down 10 lines to the line Just below the 8 (or 6 in some modes)
Change the line 10,  0  to  1  and save.

I'm looking for someone to find out what the rest do and if anyone has built a level editor for this
incredible game. Contact me at the above address.
