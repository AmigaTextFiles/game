        "Preview3do" can be used to display a .3do object without the need to load it in the VGP
game. Its use is really straightforward:

Preview3do <inputfile.3do>

        Use the mouse to rotate/move the object, move the mouse pointer to the left corner of the
screen to exit.

        The VGP_DATA: assignment is required before running Preview3do, in order to load the required
textures
