        "ConvCtp" converts a .geo file containing track's physical environment info to the
corresponding .ctp file:

ConvCtp <inputfile> <outputfile>

        Pay attention to the fact that the "Track.ctp" file generated by TrackDesigner is, despite
its name, a .geo file and, in fact, it's exactly the file you must specify as <inputfile> to this
utility
