IMPERATOR HINTS & TIPS
======================

A - H&T FOR THE STRATEGY
    --------------------

1. Always appoint the best possible tribunes to your legions.

2. Invest in your provinces as much as you can.

3. Use the political options to improve your rank quickly.
 
4. Buy up wheat or wine when the market prices are going up, don't
   spare cash
  
5. Market prices follow cyclic trends, study those trends.
 
6. Avoid confronting Carthage in the early years. Just sink their
   fleets, with the help of Neptune.
 
 7. Occupy enemy seas with your fleets, that'll prevent your
    barbaric foes from building their fleets.
 
 8. Attack barbaric countries that have just created a horde. Once the
    horde has moved away, the country will be rather defenseless.


B - H&T FOR THE BATTLES
    -------------------

1. Always fight defensively in the early stages. Let your barbaric
   foes wear themselves out while crossing the distance between you.

2. Whenever possible, meet an incoming enemy unit with several of your
   own units. Hit the enemy's sides and back.

3. If your enemy has catapults, raid them with your cavalry.

4. Boost your archers before all other units, and don't boost the the
   catapults.

5. Archers and, least of all, catapults should never be in direct
   contact with the enemy.

6. Two catapults shooting at the same spot will have a devastating
   effect.

7. Your infantry should never turn its back on enemy cavalry.
