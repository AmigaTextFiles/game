The BINBROOK TRIANGLE Bug!

Here is a fix for the unfortunate 'Binbrook Bug':

USAGE
-----
Copy the enclosed file SUP.FSS72 into your  2/sup/  directory.
Copy the enclosed file DOC.072   into your  4/docs/ directory.

The first exercise mission "Single Landing" has now been moved to Wattisham
to avoid the area around Binbrook airfield that was causing the slowdown.

It was not possible to actually find the bug so you still need to avoid
the 'Binbrook Triangle Area'.

Live Ling & Prosper!
