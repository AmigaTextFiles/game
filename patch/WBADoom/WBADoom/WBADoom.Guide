Welcome to the Amigaguide® Documentation for WBADoom,  a very nice looking Graphical User
Interface Front End for ADoom.

This program was tested on the following systems:-

@{i}68030, 40MHz FPU, 16mb FAST RAM, 1.2 GB HDD, WB 3.1, AGA
68030, No FPU, 16mb FAST RAM, 1.2 GB HDD, WB 3.1, AGA@{ui}

@NODE readmefirst "***** Read Me First *****"

This is the Beta Version of WBADoom.  Some of the functions are still untested
which is why I have made this a POSTCARDWARE version (see @{"Information" LINK information} for more details).

To get all of the functions to work you should copy the WBADoom program to the
ADoom directory and, if you dont have it installed, the Reqtools.library to @{i}sys:Libs@{ui}.

@ENDNODE

@NODE introduction "Introduction"

A While ago now I got the ADoomGUI off one of the AFCDs and for some reason it
would not work on my computer and when it did it looked horrible.

This lead me to write this nice looking, user-friendly, GUI for ADoom.	It has some
very nice extra functions such as box colours and the ability to change fonts etc.
It also has it's own appicon!

@ENDNODE

@NODE information "Information"

This version of WBADoom is BETA and is currently been testing on a number of different
computers.  Up to now it has been tested on the following computers: -

@{i}68030, 40MHz FPU, 16mb FAST RAM, 1.2 GB HDD, WB 3.1, AGA
68030, No FPU, 16mb FAST RAM, 1.2 GB HDD, WB 3.1, AGA@{ui}

But to make WBADoom last I need your help.  I you have already run WBADoom you might have
noticed that you only get a certain amount of tries before you have to register.  This is
usually between 30 and 40 tries.  After this is up a registeration code window will
open with a bunch of String Gadgets in it.  At this you should've have tested WBADoom
enough to have found any errors (or none at all).  If you have found any errors then you
have to help me by writing them down and mailing then to me at the @{"address" LINK address}.
If you haven't found any errors then to get a code you can simply register by telling me
what you think of the program and any thoughts on what you would like to be included in
any newer versions or what you simply think of the program and what I could do to improve it.

Their are a few errors known so far that I am currently fixing.  For more information go
to the @{"errors" LINK errors} page.

@ENDNODE

@NODE installation "Installation"

The Installation/De-Installation script isn't ready yet so you'll have to do it by hand.
It's simple anyway.  Just copy the WBADoom program and icon to the ADoom program directory
and, If you don't have it already installed, the Reqtools.library to @{i}sys:libs@{ui}.
This program also uses gadtools for its interface so you need the @{b}gadtools.libraries@{ub}
(not included) also in @{i}sys:libs@{ui}.

@ENDNODE

@NODE requirements "Requirements"

To run WBADoom you need:-

   * Gadtools.library
   * Reqtools.library

   * A Doom WAD in the PROGDIR: of ADoom

@NODE registration "Registration Requester"

  This a simple window that you cannot close without a registation code which
  is supplied by White Star Software.  This has 3 string gadgets in which you
  are supposed to put your name and address and then your registration code.

  After this you don't get the requester upon startup and you dont get the
  registration requester anymore.

@ENDNODE

@NODE errors "Errors"

  * Problem exists with Screenmodes.  WBADoom autosaves its settings every time you run doom
    and loads the settings everytime you load the program but it doesn't seem to like the
    screenmode setting meaning that you will have to select the screenmode everytime you
    load the program until this is fixed.

  * Registration reguester actaully comes up after 31 goes instead of 30 meaning you get an
    extra go.
