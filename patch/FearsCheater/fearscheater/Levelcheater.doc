 Fears CD32 Levelcheater & more by Software Failure/Airsoft 97
 =============================================================

 This prog allows you to play every level of Fears (CD32). To start,
 simply click on the "InstallLevelcheater" icon and follow instructions.

 Additionally I`ve inbuild some code for the bonus things stored on
 the CD. There are:

 Demos:

 - Real (Complex) 
 - A maze in (Digital)
 - Casual (Bomb)

 Modules:

 - Jimmy Jay
 - Jimmy Jay 2
 - Post Modern

 
 The modules can be saved to harddisk after playing them.


 REQUIREMENTS:

 - Fears CD32 (installed on hd)


 How do I install Fears on Harddisk?
 ===================================

 Simply use my prog CD32 Games Install Kit available on Aminet (game/patch/
 installkit2_1.lha). Version 2.2 (soon to be released) installs & emulates
 over 100 (!) CD32 Games. Many problem games like The Chaos Engine,
 Lotus Trilogy, Out to lunch, Battletoads...too. Get it!

 This prog is e-mail or cardware. If you use it, you must send me an e-mail or
 postcard. I collect postcards so it would be very nice from you, sending me
 one. If I get postcards, I know that my Cheat/Trainer work is used. So I try
 to write other cheating progs. See my adress by clicking on the "about" button
 on the GUI.
