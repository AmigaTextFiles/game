That patch applies to Encounter (c) 1991 Novagen.

You will have to install it with that install to run it from hd.
That install needs WHDLoad and The Patcher 1.05 in the path (eg in c:).

Fixed:  Protection prevented the program from running on 68020+. Removed.

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.

Note:   The program has still a bug, but i cant find the source since
          it occurs so rarely. If the colors are all white, pressing
          numerical ] (quitkey-2) fixes this.

Enhanced: Program saves the highscores.

The install is tested with 2 MB on an A1200, and on an 18 MB 68030.

Disclaimer: Although i try to make my installs as reliable as possible, you 
          use them wholly on your own risk.
