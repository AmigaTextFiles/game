DESCRIPTION

    This is version 1.00 of a hard drive installation and patch package
    for the Cinemaware game "The Three Stooges".


INSTALLING THE GAME

    Read the "SPACE REQUIREMENTS" and "BUGS/CAVEATS" sections of
    this document NOW! They are important. Really.

    Workbench or CLI use.

    Installation is best handled by using the "Installer" program
    from Commodore, which should have been provided with your
    original system disks. It is also available from Aminet as:

    util/misc/Installer-43_3.lha
    (NB: the version number might have changed!)

    After installation is complete, you may delete the directory
    produced by extracting this archive ("3SInstall"). All files
    required for running the game will be found in the "ThreeStooges"
    directory created during installation.


    FROM WORKBENCH:
    ---------------
    Extract all files in the archive to your system. They will be
    extracted to a drawer called "3SInstall"

    Open the newly created "3SInstall" drawer and double click on
    the "Install_The_Three_Stooges" icon found there.

    Follow the instructions given to you by the Installer program.

    The game will be installed to a directory you select on your
    hard drive. You will be alerted if installation fails for any
    reason.


    FROM CLI/SHELL:
    ---------------
    Extract all files in the archive to your system. They will be
    extracted to a directory called "3SInstall"

    CD to the "3SInstall" directory created when you extracted
    the acrhive.

    Type "Installer Install_The_Three_Stooges" and press RETURN.

    Follow the instructions given to you by the Installer program.

    The game will be installed to a directory you select on your
    hard drive. You will be alerted if installation fails for any
    reason.


PLAYING THE GAME

    Read the "BUGS/CAVEATS" section of this document NOW!

    From Workbench, open the "ThreeStooges" drawer created during
    installation and click on the "The_Three_Stooges_HD" icon.

    From the CLI/Shell, CD to the "ThreeStooges" directory and
    type:
        "The_Three_Stooges_HD"


SPACE REQUIREMENTS

    Requires approximately 2Mb of free space on your hard drive.
    Please do not attempt installation if you have less than this
    amount free on the partition you intend to install The Three
    Stooges on.


BUGS/CAVEATS

    3SInstall is provided "as is" and is used at your own risk.

    The author is not liable for any loss or damage caused by the
    use or misuse of this program. It almost certainly *wont* destroy
    your Amiga, but if it does (or does anything else untoward) then
    I cannot be held responsible.

    The installer is written in as system friendly a way as possible,
    but the game is not. Owners of heavily expanded Amigas may have
    problems running the game, but this is not the fault of 3SInstall
    and there is little I can do about it :( Try the usual system
    degrading tricks if you run into difficulties, or get in touch
    and Ill try to sort you out.

    Owners of AGA machines may need to use the early-startup menu
    to set their chipset to "OLD" mode in order to run The Three
    Stooges properly. Please refer to your Amiga's user manual for
    instructions if you are unsure of how to do this.


TESTING INFORMATION

    Created on A1200/68030+68882-40Mhz/8Mb/KS39.106, but should run on
    any Amiga with enough RAM that the original Three Stooges would run
    on.

    If you have a problem running 3SInstall then I WANT TO KNOW! Please,
    feel free to get in touch.
