Short:    SlamTilt launcher that correctly switches in 15KHz
Type:     game/patch

Just a small patch requested by a nice user, which allows to run the game
on a 31KHz screen by switching on a 15KHz screen, and restoring the 31KHz on
exit.

To install, just copy the SlamTilt icon on your HD installed SlamTilt version.

That's all folks.
