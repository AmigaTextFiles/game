This installer requires the original Fuzzball disks by System 3, there are
two.

Thanks to JF Fabre for sending the original.

The HD-Patched game will need 2.0 megs of memory or less with LOWMEM tooltype
active.  There is a seperate loader for the intro and the game.

It has been successfuly tested on a A1200/030/40MHz/10MB.

The intro will quit after the fire button is pressed on the last screen.
Press 'F10' to quit back to workbench.  Press fire on the last screen of
the intro to quit back to workbench.

Setting the TRAINER tootype on the FuzzballHD will give you infinite
energy.

Depending on you system you may have to disable the caches.

This loader uses the JOTD HDstartup written by Jean-Francois Fabre.
