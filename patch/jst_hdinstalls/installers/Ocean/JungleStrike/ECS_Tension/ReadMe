                         JUNGLE STRIKE HD-INSTALLER
                         --------------------------

              Hard disk version by Kong! - Thanks to Mars Bar


You need:   1 meg of fast ram
            2 meg of chip ram (AGA, but WILL work on A3000/2 meg chip!)
            Approx. 2.5 meg of hd space

Un-Arc "JSHD.LHA" to the directory you want to install to. Three sub
directories will be created:

   Disk1
   Disk2
   Disk3

Copy all the files from DISK 1 into the Disk1 directory, all the files from
DISK 2 into the Disk2 directory, and all the files from DISK 3 into the
Disk3 directory.

Load Jungle Strike by executing "LoadIt".  Edit "LoadIt" to 'CD' your
directory.

If you have the Prodigy trainer, alter "LoadIt" to run the Prodigy trainer,
and copy the "JStrike" file from the Prodigy disk into the Disk1 directory.

Dont forget to degrade your system (Vbase, Caches...)
