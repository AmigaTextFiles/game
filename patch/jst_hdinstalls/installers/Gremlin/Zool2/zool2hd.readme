Short: HD Install script & fix for Zool 2

This installer requires the Zool 2 original disks (2)

PATCHES DONE:

- Old install script replaced (it was shit)
- Better startup script (040 and 060, fast VBR support)
- Main executable decrunched
- Protection removed

If you get the message: insufficient memory, just boot without startup-sequence
and it will work.

Thanks to Chris Vella for the original disks images.
