1.  What is it?

The other day, after ages of playing with the idea of buying Alien Breed 3D
2: The Killing Grounds, I finally did.  "Wow, " I thought.  "This game
rules.  I can`t wait to play it!".  So, I got out the disks, installed them
to my hard drive, and double clicked on the games icon.  After getting past
the intro and the code protection screen, the game just stuck on a black
screen.  "Oh well, try again." I thought, but 30 tries later I resorted to
ringing Team 17 up to get some help.  The help they gave me still didn`t
help, so I rang them again.  The only thing they could tell me to do was to
run the game by booting with no startup-sequence, then making all the
assigns manually in the cli and running the game 100% from the cli.  I
tried this and it worked!  However, despite the game being absolutely
brilliant, the game was quite jerky and there was no way I was going to
type a bunch of assigns every time I wanted to play it.

This is where this archive comes in.  I typed up the assigns and saved them
to a text file named "TKG".  I then copied it to my dh0:s/ directory and
when I wanted to use the game I booted with no startup sequence and typed
"execute s/tkg".  Lo and behold, it worked!  With the minimum of fuss!
Anyway, I eventually found a file called @{"TKGPatch" link "Other TKG Stuff" 0}, which, after finally
figuring it out, made a dramatic enhancement to the speed and smoothness of
my Killing Grounds.  So then I made a minor alteration to my "dh0:s/TKG"
file, renamed it "TKG+", now this game kicks ass!

I have an A1200, 8meg fast ram, 030 50mhz Blizzard, and an 850meg IDE hard
drive, so I should not have any trouble running this game from Workbench,
but for some reason I did.  Anyway, I decided to release my TKG and TKG+
files, incase there was anyone else out there who was having the same
trouble as me, and didn`t know how to fix the problem.  If there is any
programmer out their who had the same problem as me but made a patch which
enables you to run the game from Workbench properly, then please @{"contact" link "Who made it?" 0} me
or send me a copy!  It would save me a lot of bother!

2.  How do I use it?

a)  Copy the TKG and TKG+ files from this archive into your dh0:s/
directory on your hard drive.

b)  My Killing Grounds game is in the following path, so you may have to
alter the TKG (or TKG+) file with a text editor and change the path names:

        DH1:Games/AB3DII-TKG/

c)  If you are using @{"TKGPatch" link "Other TKG Stuff" 0}, make sure it is in the same directory as the
game.  If it isn`t, the patch won`t work anyway!

d)  Reset the computer and hold down both mouse buttons until the grey
screen appears.  Click on "Boot with no startup-sequence"

e)  When the cli appears, type:

        Execute s/tkg

(Type Execute s/tkg+ if you want to run TKGPatch)

f)  Press return until the game loads.

Please note:  This stuff is really for very desperate beginners, who know
nothing about making assigns (like I was until recently!).  Anyone with
virtually no knowledge of the Amiga should be able to do all this without
having to read any of this or use either of my files!

3.  Who made (!) it?

Will Morton, that`s who.  I am 18 years old (b. 27/10/78) and have had an
Amiga since 1988.  (My god, 9 years?  It seems like only yesterday :)

Please don`t write to me to give me grief for wasting your time for reading
this load, as the archive takes up hardly any room, and there might (!) be
someone who needs help like this!  I remember that I never had anyone to
help me learn anything about the Amiga, so I am a bit behind considering
I`ve had one for nearly a decade!  :)

If you would like to contact me (for any reason, but especially if you are
into C64 nostalgia [especially @{"music" link "Music" 0}, and especially @{"Martin Galway" link "Martin Galway" 0}]), then
write here:

Will Morton 89 Fordlands Road Fulford York YO1 4QR

If you want to e-mail me, then you might be able to reach me at the
following address.  Please note that you should only use the e-mail as a
last resort, as it is the school address and some idiots in the 1st year
sometimes delete your mail.  However, if you do want to e-mail me, then use
this address:

        Fulford@RMPLC.com.uk

Please put "To Will Morton" or "To Q" in the subject space and at the top
of the letter, just so the IT Technition knows to pass the message to me.

5.  Music

I am a musician on the Amiga (I won the recent CU Amiga mod competition)
and am writing the music for a forthcoming Amiga game, FUBAR.

The address for the FUBAR web-site is as follows:

        http://www.aber.ac.uk/~img4

Also, I am a great fan of C64 music, but my absolute all-time favorite is
@{"Martin Galway" link "Martin Galway" 0}.  I have done Amiga conversions and remixes of several of his
tunes.  If you want to hear them, then you can send me a disk and return
postage and I will send them to you.  I will hopefully be putting them on
Aminet soon.  If you have anything to do with Martin Galway, then please
contact me!  I am looking for the following:

    *Old C64 Magazines with reviews of games Galway worked on
    *Old C64 Magazines with interviews with Galway
    *Addresses for Martin Galway related web-sites
    *Any PC mags with any info about games Galway has worked on
    *Any Galway games!  :)
    *Info on where I can get a CD called ORIGIN SOUNDTRACK, and
     any other Galway CD`s.
    *ANYTHING to do with Martin Galway!

Well, please spread this everywhere!  Do what you want with it, re-arange
it, delete it, I don`t really care.  It`s not as if I can copyright a bunch
of assigns!  A nice @{"`Hello`" link "Who made it?" 0} would be nice though! :)

Martin Galway: The Best C64 Musician ever to live!

Most people say Rob Hubbard is the best, but Hubbards music seemed to get
worse as time went by (no offence Rob!), whereas Galway just got better and
better.

Some of his best tunes (Sid files available from almost any C64 site) are:

Arkanoid Title Music, Comic Bakery Title Music, Rambo Title Music, Rambo
Loading Music, Game Over Title Music, Yie Ar Kung Fu Title Music (Jarre`s
Magnetic Fields 4), Yie Ar Kung Fu 2 Title Music, Parallax Title Music
Terra Cresta Title Music, Mikie Title Music, Ocean Loader Music (1985
version)

But his best tune (my favorite EVER tune) is:

Ocean Loader Music V3.0 (the 1987 version).

The first time I heard this was on Ocean Software`s "Game Set and Match"
compilation....... I fell in love with it at that moment. I would recommend
anyone who has not heard this to listen to it!
