                           What is BloodnetCheat
                           ---------------------


   With BloodnetCheat you can patch your BloodnetAGA savefiles and
   gaining 255 in every stat plus 16,777,215 virtual dollars. :-)



                               Installation
                               ------------

   Just copy the mainfile to any place you like. C: is a good spot,
   and that's it! Easy, huh? :-)



-----
Usage
-----

   BloodnetCheat is a CLI only program and the syntax is:

      BloodnetCheat <name-of-savefile>

   Example: BloodnetCheat game0.sav

   A word of warning though; BloodnetCheat _will_ overwrite your old
   savefile after the patching, so if you don't trust me, make a backup
   of your savefile before using this program. :-)

Offsets
-------

   For those of you that wish to do your own patcher, the following offsets
   might come in handy...

   NOTE: You have to change the value in the positions under both Pos#1
         and Pos#2, or else the game will accuse you of cheating... :-)

                                  POS#1:             POS#2:
