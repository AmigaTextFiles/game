 XtremeMod V1.0
 ==============
 
 Welcome to XTremeMod. This little program allows you
 to use your favourite mods in X-Treme Racing. I wrote
 this patch, because I liked X-Treme Racing very much -
 but HATED the mods (apart from the theme mod)....

 Once you started XTremeMod you have to select a Mod
 for every category (Dance, Techno...). Please note
 that this mod has to be in Protracker format.
 The original XTremeRacing mods will be storaged then
 with a ".o" after the filename!

 XTremeRacing reserves one channel for the sound fx.
 So if a Mod doesn`t sound correctly, convert it
 from 4 to 3 channel.

 If you wanna contact me...
