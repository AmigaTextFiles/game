Updated!!! (See Elerium - 115 cheat at bottom)

Other Patch Files I've done:
	Gloom Deluxe - Cybergraphics ECS users get Full Colour! (Fixes Gloom bug)
	(game/patch/gloomcolourfix.lha)

My System:
	Amiga 3000
	2 Chip, 48 Fast RAM
        CyberStorm MKII 060 50mhz
	340megs of HD's
	GVP I/O Extender
	IOMEGA ZIP: Drive
	CyberVision64
	DELL HD Disk Drive

	Being an A3000 owner, I'm stuck with ECS software unless it supports CyberGfx.  
With Team17 and many soft Co's still not supporting gfx cards my entertainment selec-
tions are severely limited. So when I found 'UFO - Enemy Unknown ECS', I was ec-
static!.

Now, it is missing night and day (a plus for play-a-bility really) and some of the anima-
tions, (They made it for an A500. God only know's why, as it needs power to be play-
able).  but it's playable none the less.  Some of the graphics really lack in colour, but 
hey, it's ECS and I AM being able to play it.

	It's being put out by  PowerPlus  , made by MicroProse and I bought it from Greg 
Scott at National Amiga.  (See Amiga Web DIRECTORY for his Great ad)

	Now down to the part you've all been waiting for.
           -----------------------------------------------------------------
UFO is hard,
Damn hard...

	There are a host of cheats and editors for the AGA version of UFO/X-Com but 
they don't work with the ECS version. It's been redone and all the little game-save files 
are now saved into two files.  One with the saved game name and the other one is a file 
that remains the same size no matter what changes. (As far as I can tell)

	Finding out that the AGA cheats did not work on the ECS version sent me into a 
frenzy, attempting to E-Mail all the cheat creators to ask them to make a change to their 
editors to allow me to play without any money restraints.  Then, not being able to wait 
for any replies I sent out looking for the money location myself.  I figured it MUST be in 
HEX, as DEC wouldn't be efficient.

Well, I found it...

Here's how to do it yourself.  It's very easy.

I used ZAP, but NEWZAP should work too.

Load the file 'Savegame.sav' into ZAP (or equivalent) [from any of the 10 game saved 
dirs]  This file should be  45299bytes.

Goto file byte location    42881  (Zap lets you use  RAMIGA G to hop to the right spot)

And replace what's there with this.          7fffffff

[one 7 and seven lowercase  F's   (f)]

Save it and enjoy!  (Make a copy of the file BEFORE you do this, just in case you make 
a mistake. If you go any higher it goes negative and that's useless.

Do this as often as you like!

ALSO: If you are too timmid to do this edit yourself, I've included a Saved Game file 
that's fresh.  Just copy both files into any of the 10 saved game dirs and you can play it 
with 2+ billion!



*****************************************************************************************

NEW! Elerium - 115 cheat!

Once you progress into the game a bit you will discover you can build new air craft that
run on alien fuel. (Elerium - 115) You can't build or buy this fuel and therefore have to
try to grab it from alien bases or landed ships. (Crashed ships don't have it as it explodes
most of the time on impact.)

Do the same as you would do above with the money cheat. (These can be done at the same time)

Load the 'Savegame.sav' file from any of the game_x dirs.

Goto file byte location   23016

Replace what is there with 7777  (4 7's)

Save it and you now have over 30,000 units of Elerium - 115 waiting for you at your MAIN base.
(That's base one) Move it to your other bases or sell it if you have too much.

**Note to programmers: If anyone would like to make this into a file.EXE cheat please 
give me credit & send me a copy!  Thanks (My E-Mails at the top of the file)


That's it.  With more fiddling I could work in 255 of all items and research but I just 
wanted to make the game a little easier, not cheat all the fun out of the game.
