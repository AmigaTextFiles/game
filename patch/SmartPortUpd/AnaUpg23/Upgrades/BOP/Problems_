IMPORTANT: The analog joystick will not function, if the light labeled "PC1"
           on the AMIGA Smart Port is not on.


PROBLEM:   When I run the upgrade, it returns without doing anything.
SOLUTION:  It has come to our attention that there are two versions of Birds of
           Prey. This upgrade works with the 1991 version. If the files on your
           Birds of Prey disk 2 are dated 1992, then this upgrade will NOT work.

PROBLEM: The controls appear to behave in an abnormal manner.
SOLUTION: Use the SmartPortCal program to adjust the range of the joystick.
          Use the adjustment knobs to adjust the Smart Port such that the
          maximum value at maximum extremes in all directions does not exceed
          251.  A value of 249-251 is fine.  Even a lower value will work,
          just don't exceed a value of 251.

PROBLEM: The game starts, but the screens are garbled.
SOLUTION: Hard disk users: Make sure the assign "Birds of Prey:" is made and
          set to the directory Birds of Prey resides in.
          AGA Users: Make sure you are booting in the ECS chip set mode.


PROBLEM:  The manual target tracking is hard to use because the target ring
          jumps all over the screen.
SOLUTION: If you have an Amiga 500 , then this is normal. Due it's known noise
          problems and the way the Birds of Prey software handles the tracking
          input, it can not be eliminated.
          If you are useing any other type of Amiga , you should not see more
          then a very slight bounce.
