WARNING:   Pressing the digital joystick "FIRE" button will deactivate "ALL"
           analog functions ("PC1" light not illuminated).  Press the analog
           joystick "FIRE" button to restore the analog functions ("PC1" light
           illuminated).

           Pressing the left mouse button ("PC2" light not illuminated) will
           deactivate the analog on mouse port one.  This will cause problems if
           pedals, analog collective, or buttons 3 and 4, are in use.
           To restore the "PC2" functions, perform one of the methods described
           in Step 3 (Above) of "USING THE ANALOG PEDALS".


PROBLEM: The controls appear to behave in an abnormal manner.
SOLUTION: Use the SmartPortCal program to adjust the range of the joystick.
          Use the adjustment knobs to adjust the Smart Port such the Maximum
          value at maximum extremes in any direction does not exceed a value
          of 251.  A value of 249-251 is acceptable. Even a lower value will
          function, just do not exceed a value of 251.

PROBLEM:  The joystick does not respond at all.
SOLUTION: Make sure the "PC1" light is illuminated and the joystick is
          connected properly. Make sure you have pressed the "J" key to
          set the center point of the joystick.

PROBLEM:  The pedals do not respond at all.
SOLUTION: Make sure the "PC2" light is illuminated and the pedals are
          connected correctly. Make sure you have pressed the "R" key to
          activate and set the center point.

PROBLEM:  The collective does not respond at all.
SOLUTION: 1. Make sure either:
            A. The "PC2" light is illuminated and the collective device is
               connected; or
            B. The "Special Mouse Mode Switch" on the AMIGA Smart Port is
               switched away from the 15-pin connecter and the collective
               device is connected properly.
          2. Make sure you have pressed the "~" key to enable the collective.


PROBLEM:  On the mission level, both joysticks (analog and digital) and my
          mouse do not work right.
SOLUTION: You have something set up in your system that is affecting all three
          devices. This is a known problem with the basic GS2000 game. The only
          cure is to stop running the program that causes the problem (The cause
          may vary from system to system).

PROBLEM:  Sometimes, when I am viewing the "MAP" screen or have the game
          paused, I can't return to the cockpit.
SOLUTION: GS2000 Upgrade 2.3 still contains a software glitch which causes an
          interaction with the mouse on some computers. Just move the mouse and
          it will allow you to return to the game. We were ready to release the
          2.3 Upgrade when this was reported.  Because it is such a minor
          problem and does not happen often, we decided to release GS2000 as
          is.  The next release of this upgrade will correct this inconvenience.
