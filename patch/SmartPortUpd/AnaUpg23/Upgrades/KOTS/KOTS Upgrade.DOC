                   InterACTIVE Digital Devices Presents:
               AMIGA Smart Port(TM) Analog Upgrade Version 1.0
                    for Knights of the Sky by MicroProse

                     Upgrade written by Alvin Derouen






-------------------------------INSTALLATION-----------------------------------
NOTE: The default ICONS are designed for WorkBench 2.0. WorkBench 1.3 ICONS are
      also included. They have "For1.3" appended to the normal name. Just
      rename and copy over the normal one to use. (All this will do is make the
      the icons look better , there are no other differences.)


                                 HARD disk
 Move the KOTS Upgrade to the directory in which Knights of the Sky resides.
 This may be accomplished by either:
  A. CLI:
     Insert the original "SmartPortCal" disk in a floppy drive.
     Copy "KOTS Upgrade" and "KOTS Upgrade.info" to the hard disk directory
     that holds Knights of the sky.
  B. Workbench:
     Insert the original "SmartPortCal" disk in a floppy drive.
     Open the directory "Analog Upgrades" on the "SmartPortCal" disk. Open the
     directory inside the "Analog Upgrades" window named "Knights of the Sky".
     Open the directory on the hard disk that holds "Knights Of The Sky".
     (It should be named "KOTS")
     Next use the mouse to move the "KOTS Upgrade" icon and drop it into the
     hard disk "KOTS" window.
     (You may have to rearrange the windows to do this)


                                   FLOPPY
 Move the KOTS Upgrade to the KOTS1: disk (Knights Of The Sky disk number 1).
   WARNING: use a copy , DO NOT use the original!!!
 This may be accomplished by either:
  A. CLI:
     Insert the original "SmartPortCal" disk in a floppy drive.
     Insert a COPY of the original "KOTS1:" disk in a floppy drive.
     (That is the name of the Knights of the Sky Disk 1)
     DO NOT USE THE ORIGINAL DISK!!! Copy the "KOTS Upgrade" program and
     "KOTS Upgrade.info" to the "KOTS1:" disk.
  B. Workbench:
     Insert the original "SmartPortCal" disk in a floppy drive.
     Open the directory "Analog Upgrades" on the "SmartPortCal" disk. Open the
     directory inside the "Analog Upgrades" window named "Knights of the Sky".
     Insert a COPY of the original "KOTS1:" disk in a floppy drive.
     (That is the name of the Knights of the Sky Disk 1)
     DO NOT USE THE ORIGINAL DISK!!!  Now Double Click on the "KOTS1:" icon to
     open up a window for the "KOTS1:" disk. Next use the mouse to move the
    "KOTS Upgrade" icon in the "Knights of the Sky" window and drop it into the
     "KOTS1:" window.
     (You may have to rearrange the windows to do this)


---------------------------------- LOADING -----------------------------------
 Just click on the Icon from the workbench , or from the cli, run the file
 "Knights Of The Sky Upgrade". (With quotes)


  NOTE: You may also run the Upgrade without installing it. Double click on the
        "Knights Of The Sky Upgrade" icon on the original disk. You will then
        be prompted to insert "KOTS1:". After the disk is inserted, it will
        load normally.

  NOTE: This Upgrade does not in any way change the original program. You MUST
        run the program each time by useing the IDD upgrade. If you do not ,
        none of the new features will operate.


  WARNING: A system with only one meg of ram is unlikely to able to load from
           workbench with a full system installed. In this case, you need to
           boot from a copy of the Knights Of The Sky disk with the KOTS Upgrade
           icon in it. You then double click on the icon to start.
           (See floppy installation above)

--------------------------------- NEW FEATURES --------------------------------
ALL of the following NEW features for KOTS are now available using the Amiga
Smart Port from IDD!
 1. More sensitive control!  The KOTS Upgrade will use the full range (0-251)
    of the AMIGA Smart Port instead of the limited original range provided by
    the game (0-40).
 2. Mode Auto-Sensing of the Amiga Smart Port.  The game will switch between
    digital and analog modes automatically with switching of the Amiga Smart
    Port.
 3. Analog joystick works at all levels (including all menus) with automatic
    switching to analog mode.
 4. A centering function allows for precise centering by pressing the "J" Key.
    (can be re-centered at anytime - even in flight!)
 5. Automatic joystick range scaling! The software will adjust the joystick
    scaling to use the full range of your stick without any calibration
    procedure by moving the joystick to all extremes of travel (this is always
    active and will work at any time if you forget - even in flight!)
 6. Three analog sensitivity settings. Use the one you like best.
    The "C" key selects the different settings.  It can be changed at any
    time!
 7. Support for ANALOG RUDDERS!! - with same centering and full use of joystick
    auto-ranging as the joystick. (Uses the "E" Key)
    Rudder and Throttle inputs can be reversed to be compatible with the
    original Rudder Pedal Adapter.
 8. Support for ANALOG THROTTLE!! - (uses "W" Key)
    Rudder and Throttle inputs can be reversed to be compatible with the
    original Rudder Pedal Adapter.

******************************************************************************
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONTROL	  KEY(s)	FUNCTION
--------  ------ ----------------------------------------------------
                 NEW KEYBOARD FUNCTIONS CHART
JOYSTICK:
            C    Set analog joystick sensitivity to "HIGH" (DEFAULT)
      Shift+C    Set analog joystick sensitivity to "MEDIUM"
        ALT+C    Set analog joystick sensitivity to "LOW"

            J    Center analog joystick if active.
                 Needed on start-up and any time the center changes.
                 Which would cause the aircraft to drift. Not to be confused
                 with battle damage.  This will vary according to quality of
                 joystick.

                 SWITCHING BETWEEN ANALOG AND DIGITAL JOYSTICK:
                  ANALOG:
		       Press the "FIRE" button on the ANALOG joystick.
                       This activates the "PC1" light on the AMIGA Smart Port
                       and puts the hardware in analog mode.

                  DIGITAL:
                       Press the "Fire" Button on the DIGITAL joystick
                       to switch off the "PC1" light.  This deactivates the
                       analog mode of the AMIGA Smart Port hardware.

                  NOTE: The KOTS Upgrade software will follow the AMIGA Smart
                        Port mode by switching from analog to digital as
                        the hardware does.


RUDDER:
           E    Make analog rudder active and set center with NORMAL inputs.
       ALT+E    Make analog rudder active and set center with REVERSED inputs.
     Shift+E    Make keyboard rudder active. (DEFAULT)

                NOTE: Analog Pedals will NOT work correctly unless the "PC1"
                      and "PC2" lights on the AMIGA Smart Port are switched on
                      FIRST. (See "USING THE ANALOG RUDDER" below)

                      For technical reasons, it is not possible to sense
                      the Amiga Smart Port Mouse Port 1 mode (indicated by
                      the "PC2" light).  The software will NOT automatically
                      follow any changes in the mode of Mouse Port 1.


THROTTLE:
           W    Make Analog Throttle Active with NORMAL inputs.
       ALT+W    Make Analog Throttle Active with REVERSED inputs.
     Shift+W    Make keyboard Throttle Active. (DEFAULT)

                NOTE: Analog throttle will NOT work correctly unless:
                     1."PC1"  light on the AMIGA Smart Port is activated FIRST.
                     2. Either "PC2" light is on OR the mouse mode switch on
                       the Smart port is switched AWAY from the 15 pin plug.
                      (See "USING THE ANALOG THROTTLE" below)

                      For technical reasons, it is not possible to sense
                      the Amiga Smart Port Mouse Port 1 mode (indicated by
                      the "PC2" light).  The software will NOT automatically
                      follow any changes in the mode of Mouse Port 1.


NOTES ON SPECIAL MOUSE MODE:
 Normally, the "PC2" side of the Smart Port is either "ANALOG" (LIGHT
 ILLUMINATED) or "DIGITAL" (LIGHT NOT ILLUMINATED). However, there is a hybrid
 mode called "SPECIAL MOUSE MODE" which is enabled by switching the mouse mode
 switch away from the 15-pin connector. In this case, you are converting the
 middle mouse button into an analog input.  All other digital mouse functions
 will be unaffected.  This allows you to activate ONE analog line while the
 mouse is still available.  This is VERY useful if your hardware does not
 have a button available to put the port in full analog mode.  With this feature
 the built-in throttle on the CH FlightStick (and others) can be used.  This is
 the mode Fighter Duel Pro uses to provide rudder capability.



******************************************************************************
*Knights Of The Sky - DETAILED PRE-FLIGHT CHECK LIST (after entering cockpit)*
*               Performed on start-up or as needed.                          *
* It is recommended that these procedures be preformed before take off.      *
******************************************************************************
 The following instructions describe various configurations for several
 combinations of hardware.  Locate the appropriate combination for your
 particular situation.



IMPORTANT: NO analog functions will work correctly, if the light labeled "PC1"
           on the AMIGA Smart Port is illuminated. In addition, the analog
           throttle and the analog pedals will not function if the indicator
           light labeled "PC2" on the AMIGA Smart Port is not illuminated.
           Unless the special mouse mode switch is engaged.

IMPORTANT: At the beginning of the session, the center and full scale
           for each analog device must be initialized at least once
           For more information, see the detailed description below.
           This can be repeated as often as necessary.

WARNING:   Pressing the digital joystick "FIRE" button will deactivate "ALL"
           analog functions ("PC1" light not illuminated).  Press the analog
           joystick "FIRE" button to restore the analog functions ("PC1" light
           illuminated).

           Pressing the left mouse button ("PC2" light not illuminated) will
           deactivate the mouse port one analog mode.  Functions such as pedals,
           and throttle, will not operate properly under these conditions.  To
           restore the "PC2" functions, perform one of the methods in Step 3 of
            "USING THE ANALOG RUDDER" described below.



USING THE ANALOG JOYSTICK:
1. Connect an analog joystick to the AMIGA Smart Port.
2. Place Port 2 of the Amiga Smart Port in analog mode by pressing the analog
   joystick "FIRE" button.
3. The "PC1" light on the AMIGA SMART PORT should be illuminated.
4. Make sure the analog joystick is in the center then press the "J" key to
   set the center point for the joystick.
5. Move the joystick to all four corners of its travel to set maximum
   scale.
6. IF you want a different sensitivity then the default (HIGH) then select it
   now (ALT+"C" or SHIFT KEY+"C").

USING THE ANALOG RUDDER:
1. Attach one of the following combinations to the AMIGA Smart Port:
    A. Aircraft pedals and a standard analog joystick connected
       via an Advanced Game Port Adapter (from IDD).
       NOTE: The Advanced Game Port Adapter is necessary if your joystick
             does not incorporate at least three buttons.
       Both switches on the Game Port Adapter should be switched to "NORMAL".
    B. IDD'S PC PEDALS(TM) and a standard analog joystick.
    C. An analog joystick with a second analog joystick (for use as pedals)
       using a standard IBM "Y" adapter cable. (Available from IDD)
    D. Aircraft pedals and a standard analog joystick connected
       via the original Rudder Pedal Adapter (no longer available from IDD).
       In addition the "Special Mouse Mode Switch" on the AMIGA Smart Port
       MUST be switched away from the 15 pin connecter.
2. Perform the steps under "USING THE ANALOG JOYSTICK".

   IF YOU ARE USING A RUDDER PEDAL ADAPTER, SKIP TO STEP 5.

3. Place Port 1 of the Amiga Smart Port in analog mode, using ONE of the
   following methods:
   (If none apply to you, then you do not have the proper hardware)
   A. Press button 3 on your joystick if it has extra buttons. Button 3 is
      simply the button that turns on the AMIGA Smart Port "PC 2" light.
   B. If you have the Advanced Game Port Adapter (from IDD) then enable the
      "PC 2" Trigger Switch then Press the second button on the analog
      joystick.  The "PC 2" light on AMIGA Smart Port should now be on.
   C. If you are using two joysticks with a "Y" cable (available from IDD),
      press the "fire" button on the second analog joystick.
      The "PC 2" light on AMIGA Smart Port should now be on.
   D. Press the mode select button on the IDD PC Pedals... available December
      1993 from IDD.
4. The "PC 2" light on the AMIGA Smart Port "MUST" now be on.
5. Make sure the analog pedals are in the mechanical center, then press the "E"
   key to set the center point(Use ALT+E if you are using a Rudder Pedal
   Adapter).
6. To set the full scale, push the left pedal to the maximum travel, then
   perform the same to right pedal.







USING THE ANALOG THROTTLE:
            NOTE: The built-in throttle on the CH FlightStick (and others)
            will work!
1. Attach one of the following combinations to the AMIGA Smart Port:
   A. Two analog joysticks using a standard IBM "Y" adapter cable.
      (Available from IDD)
   B. Two analog joysticks connected via the PC PEDALS(TM) [BY IDD].
   C. An analog joystick with built-in throttle, using either the
      Advanced Game Port Adapter or the PC PEDALS(TM) [Both from IDD].
      Both switches on the Game Port Adapter or PC PEDALS(TM) should be switched
      to "NORMAL".
   D. An analog joystick with built-in throttle.
      (With this option, the "Special Mouse Mode" switch on the AMIGA Smart
      Port can be switched away from the 15-pin connecter to activate the
      built-in throttle)
   NOTE: Any device used for throttle should NOT be self-centering.
2. Initialize the joystick by performing the steps under "USING THE ANALOG
   JOYSTICK".

   IF THE "SPECIAL MOUSE MODE" SWITCH IS ENABLED(TOWARD THE 15 PIN CONNECTOR),
   SKIP TO STEP 5.

3. Activate the analog mode on Port 1 ("PC2" light illuminated) of the Amiga
   Smart Port by any of the three methods described in step 3 of "USING THE
   ANALOG RUDDER".
4. The "PC1" and "PC2" indicator lights "MUST" be illuminated.
5. Press the "W" key to activate the throttle.
6. Move the device used for throttle to maximum range in both directions.
   WARNING!!! IF the engine is on, be quick or the aircraft will take off!

WARNING:   Pressing the digital joystick "FIRE" button will deactivate "ALL"
           analog functions ("PC1" light not illuminated).  Press the analog
           joystick "FIRE" button to restore the analog functions ("PC1" light
           illuminated).

           Pressing the left mouse button ("PC2" light not illuminated) will
           deactivate the mouse port one analog mode.  Functions such as pedals,
           and throttle, will not operate properly under these conditions.  To
           restore the "PC2" functions, perform one of the methods in Step 3 of
            "USING THE ANALOG RUDDER" described below.

PROBLEM: The controls appear to behave in an abnormal manner.
SOLUTION: Use the SmartPortCal program to adjust the range of the joystick.
          Use the adjustment knobs to adjust the Smart Port such the Maximum
          value at maximum extremes in any direction does not exceed a value
          of 251.  A value of 249-251 is acceptable. Even a lower value will
          function, just do not exceed a value of 251.

PROBLEM:  The joystick does not respond at all.
SOLUTION: Make sure the "PC1" light is illuminated and the joystick is
          connected correctly. Make sure you have pressed the "J" key to set
          the center point of the joystick.

PROBLEM:  The pedals do not respond at all.
SOLUTION: Make sure the "PC2" light is illuminated and the pedals are
          connected correctly. Make sure you have pressed the "E" key to
          activate and set the center point.

PROBLEM:  The throttle does not respond at all.
SOLUTION: 1. Make sure either:
            A. The "PC2" light is illuminated and the throttle device is
               connected; or
            B. The "Special Mouse Mode Switch" on the AMIGA Smart Port is
               switched away from the 15-pin connecter and the throttle device is
               connected properly.
          2. Make sure you have pressed the "W" key to enable the throttle.

PROBLEM:  The joystick or pedals drifts when I release it.
SOLUTION: Make sure you have set the center point for the device in question.
          HINT:  Operate the device several cycles before returning to center
                 and press the "J" (joystick) or "E" (pedal) key to set the
                 center point.
