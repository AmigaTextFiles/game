                            (=====================)


Oh yeah, a new trainer is born. This time for the great game Wendetta. This
time it`s a real trainer, you can choose every level or the end and get 9
lives, which are enough, to finish every level.

REQUIREMENTS:

- Wendetta (installed on HD)


How can I install Wendetta on HD??
----------------------------------

That is very easy. Simply insert the Wendetta CD and drag it`s icon to the
directory where it shall take place. You must have 33MB free on your HD.

Alternately you can install it by CLI. Type something like that:

Copy CD0: dh2:Games/Wendetta all

If you can`t do anything of these methods, install it with the help of the
InstallKit (game/patch/InstallKit2_1.lha). 


           ********************* IMPORTANT *************************
   
           You cannot start this trainer from workbench because 
           Wendetta needs all your memory!! So, do
           something like this:

           1. Reset your computer and hold down both mousebuttons.
           2. Now click on the right button called "boot with no
              startup-sequence"
           3. Now type in "CD [gamepath]" without quotes of course.
              E.Q. "CD dh2:games/wendetta"
           4. Now type in "Execute trainer". The trainer will start
              then.

           ********************* IMPORTANT *************************  
            

 If this was succesfully, a nice GUI appears. Here you can select the
 level you wanna play and something more. 

 If you select start, Wendetta will be started. Now select "Play game."
 Now you see the typical mission 1 animation. I don`t know why, but if 
 you press fire now, your selected level/anim appears. 

 If you have problems or bugs please e-mail me and specify your system-
 configuration. 

 This prog is e-mail- or cardware. If you use it, you must send me an e-mail
 with Bugs, comments, suggestions or a postcard (if you haven`t email).
 I`m collecting postcards so it would be very nice, if you send me one from
 your country/town. My adress can you see by clicking on the "About" Button.
 If I get postcards I`ll try to write cheaters for other games.
