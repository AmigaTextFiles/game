XTreme Racing V1.01 Updates File

* Please Read Carefully *

Here are some details that didn't make it into the manual...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

A FAQ is now provided to answer all your questions. It also contains
some details on linking 2 machines together.

Microbotics Problem Fixed : MBX1230 boards can now have sound effects

2 Meg Fast Ram Amigas

If you only have 2 megs of fast ram you may need to boot up with no
start-up sequence in order to place the game in its full variety
of resolutions. Instructions for this are in the manual. Owners of 
machines with more ram should not have a problem

----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have any problems with this game then please call Guildhall to
check if the problem has been fixed, in which case you will be asked
to return Disk 1 to be replaced by a new disk.

This Game requires PAL to work !

Deathmatch Games

On deathmatch games you will see several numbers at the top right of
each player's play area. The top number is the total number of kills
minus the number of suicides. If the game is set to end after 5 kills
for example, this is the number to watch out for. The numbers below this
are the number of times you have killed all the other players. Your
player is signified by '--'. 

e.g. For 4 players

             10
          -- 05
          04 02

Means this is player 1, and he has killed player two 5 times,player three
 4 times, and player four 2 times. He has also killed himself once, hence
the total number of kills = 10.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Lap Times & Save Option on the Menus

Selecting this will save out all the controls, modules setups, screen
preferences, and so on. It will also save all the best lap times.

*** Lap Times are not automatically saved after races ***

Also note that lap times are not saved out for computer cars because
this would be no fun, and not from seasons because you can have
faster engines in this mode. Single race times can be saved however.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Press ESC or the Play Button (CD32 Pad) while loading a track to abort
a season.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Network Games

Serial Link

To play a network game, one machine must select 'null modem master'
and the other 'null modem slave'. If the connection fails, simply
try again. Its possible that the link may fail very now and again in which
case the game will 'time-out' after a few seconds. this can take up to
about 40 seconds in some cases.
