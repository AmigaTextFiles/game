## Introduction
##
@node introduction "Easy Quake Introduction"


 @{b}Easy Quake Introduction@{ub}


    
 Are you a person which likes to play Quake ? Then this program might be
 useful for you. This program offers a front-end for running your Quake
 game. And this without the need to create a number of icons to get going
 and frag the baddies.
 
 It offers a ClassAct GUI with the parameters for starting up Quake.
 To use it you should have the @{i}ClassAct@{ui} library installed. Or
 have the latest OS3.5 installed.
 
 Go on, fire up EZQuake. Then, just click and fill in the options. When
 options are what you want click "Play". And off you go to kill those
 ugly and violent monsters...
 
 Got a new extention or option pack ? Then just unpack the archive in
 your Quake directory, fire up EZQuake and select the game's place
 using a standard directory requester. Hit "Play" and Quake starts up
 with the installed extention or pack.
 
 You will find a string gadget for any extra parameter you would like to
 supply. Currently I'm using it to supply my playername to Quake.
 But you could easily enter others if needed.   
 
 I'm quite sure you appreciate my effort providing this little program.
 
 Enjoy and frag some for me...
      
 WARNING: some options that can be set might not be available in all versions
 of Quake, since there are a couple of ports around you should check the
 docs of the particulate port you're trying to run.

 EZQuake is known to work with most PPC ports and sets a default stack of
 500.000 bytes for executing Quake as required by most of them.
