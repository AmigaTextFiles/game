DESCRIPTION

 This is a HD-Installer for the Whizz AGA disk-version which is provided
 free with the Amiga(tm) MAGIC bundle from Amiga Technologies(tm) GmbH.

NOTE

 The required 'Installer' tool is NOT included. You can find it on
 your 'Install Version 3.1' disk, on aminet in 'util/misc/Installer*'
 or on various CDs. Copy it to 'SYS:Utilities' or anywhere else,
 where workbench can find it.

 You will see a few blue stripes in background while WhizzHD reads
 data from memory. They are just some kind of progress-indicator.

UPDATE

 If you have already installed WhizzHD 1.0 or 1.1 then just copy the
 file 'Data/WhizzHD' from this archive to your 'WhizzHD' drawer.
 It is not necessary for this update to read the disk-images again.
