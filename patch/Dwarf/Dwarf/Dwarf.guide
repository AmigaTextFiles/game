   How can I enter hexadecimal numbers?

   (0.43) A leading $ specifies hex numbers. $a would be 10.
   (0.45) Doesn't work anymore. I'll rewrite this.

   @{bg shine}@{b}What is this?@{bg back}@{ub}


   If you know @{"TrainerMaker" LINK Trainer} or @{"Cheater" LINK Cheater}, you're already familar with this
   kind of program.

   Why another?

   I've seen TrainerMaker some time ago, and I was surprised to see something
   like the Action Replay trainer mode working in multitasking. But most games
   switched it off and there was no chance to get around this.

   OS-friendly games came to fashion, when people recognized that their soft
   didn't work on any other machine than their own.

   There is Cheater, which comes with a nice MUI window and some useful functions.
   But Cheater was (and still is) Shareware and I didn't want to pay money for
   a program that I was sure I could code myself.

   I started development and created a small program that does what I needed
   from Cheater before. It was really small, not in filesize, but in functions,
   so I called it Dwarf. I know there's another program carrying that name, but
   I just don't care :)

   Use Cheater or Dwarf?

   If you want a nice (but slow) MUI window, some good menus and a requester
   appearing everytime you press a gadget ;), download Cheater.
   If you don't like the requester, pay $10 for it.
   If you want a nice (and fast) GadTools GUI and continuing free support
   - use Dwarf.

   @{bg shine}@{b}Quick Usage@{bg back}@{ub}


   - Start Dwarf by double-clicking on its icon.

   - Play any game, note down the value to be changed, PAUSE the game,
     switch to WB ('Amiga'+'M').

   - Select mode (Byte/Word/Long/Float) with first cycle gadget. If you
     don't know what to select, try Long or Word.

   - Select memory mode (Chip/Fast/Both) with second cycle gadget. Most
     games keep the relevant data in Fastmem, so this should do the job.

   - Enter value you've noted before (hope you did) and type it into the
     string gadget.

   - Press 'Search' gadget. This will take some time.

   - Continue playing your game until that value changes. Pause, and switch
     to WB again.

   - Enter new value into string gadget.

   - Press 'Verify' gadget. This is a fast operation which compares the new
     value with those stored in the listview gadget (or in memory).

   - You've found the address? If not, play on and verify again.

   - Now type your desired value (see limits above) into the string gadget
     and select an address from the list.

   - Press 'Set'. That's it!


   @{bg shine}@{b}ManiacMan Patches@{bg back}@{ub}


   Since 0.45 you can use the .mmp data files of my old program ManiacMan.
   These allow patching of savegames, cracking software, etc...

   To use this feature, press the 'Load Patch' gadget and select a
   ManiacMan patchfile from the file requester. Then press 'Apply Patch'
   and select the file to be patched.

   Please note that files are overwritten after the patch has been
   applied. Make backup copies, in case your data gets lost.
