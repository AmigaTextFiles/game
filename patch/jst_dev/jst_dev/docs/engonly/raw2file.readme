raw2file is a universal raw disk imager.

Useful in development stage only.
It reads the specified track in raw data using index mode
(means no sync, you have to manage to resync the track)

Usage:

raw2file <unit> <file> <track>

<unit>: 0,1,2,3, means DF0:, DF1:, DF2:, DF3:
<file>: diskfile to create
<track>: 0 to 159

raw2file is Kick1.x compatible.

Bugs:

used twice without ejecting the disk, raw2file can give a file beginning with zeroes or $5555s
In this case, just retry after having ejected the disk.
