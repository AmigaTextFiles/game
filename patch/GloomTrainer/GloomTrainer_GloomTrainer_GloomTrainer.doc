INSTALLING THE TRAINER

    Workbench or CLI use.

    Installation is best handled by using the "Installer" program
    from Commodore, which should have been provided with your
    original system disks. It is also available from Aminet as:

    util/misc/Installer-43_3.lha
    (NB: the version number might have changed!)

    After installation is complete, you may delete the directory
    produced by extracting this archive ("GloomTrainer").


    FROM WORKBENCH:
    ---------------
    Extract all files in the archive to your system.
    They will be extracted to a drawer called "GloomTrainer"

    Open the newly created "GloomTrainer" drawer and double click on
    the "Install_GloomTrainer" icon found there.

    Follow the instructions given to you by the Installer program:
    - all trainer and trainer-GUI related choices are *default* values
      only and may be changed after installation by editing the
      icon tooltypes of the "GloomTrainer" program or using the
      trainer GUI.

    - when asked to select a directory to install GloomTrainer in you
      should select the directory that you have Gloom installed in.


    FROM CLI/SHELL:
    ---------------
    Extract all files in the archive to your system.
    They will be extracted to a directory called "GloomTrainer"

    CD to the "GloomTrainer" directory created when you extracted
    the acrhive.

    Type "Installer Install_GloomTrainer" and press RETURN.

    Follow the instructions given to you by the Installer program:
    - when asked to select a "User Level" you *must* choose "Expert".

    - all trainer and trainer-GUI related choices you make will only
      apply if you start the AB3DTrainer program from Workbench. If
      you start the trainer program from CLI (or from a script) then
      these options will be ignored.

    - all trainer and trainer-GUI related choices are *default* values
      only and may be changed after installation by editing the
      icon tooltypes of the "GloomTrainer" program or using the
      trainer GUI.

    - when asked to select a directory to install GloomTrainer in you
      should select the directory that you have Gloom installed in.


CONFIGURING THE TRAINER

    The GloomTrainer program icon has a number of tooltypes which may be
    modified at any time to change the way in which it operates. Note that
    if you start the trainer from CLI then options saved in the program's
    tooltypes are ignored.


    "NOGUI"
    -------
	Specify this tooltype to disable the trainer GUI. If the GUI is
    disabled then the game will run with the default options specified
    in the other tooltypes.

    If the NOGUI tooltype is not present then the trainer GUI will appear.


	"INF_LIVES"
	"INF_BIGGUN"
	"INF_INVIS"
	"INF_THERMO"
	"INF_BOUNCY"
	"MAXBOOSTS"
    ------------
	Specify any combination of these tooltypes to set the default state of
    the corresponding trainer. For example, if you specify the "INF_LIVES"
    and "INF_BIGGUN" tooltypes then the infinite lives and maximum gun power
    trainers will default to being active.

    If any of the above tooltypes are not present, then the corresponding
    trainer will default to being inactive.


TRAINERS AVAILABLE

    Infinite lives should be self explanatory!

    Infinite maximum gun power makes you permanently fire 3 shots at once.

    Infinite invisibility makes you permanently invisible.

    Infinite thermo-glasses gives you permanent use of the thermo-glasses.

    Infinite bouncy bullets gives you permanently bouncy bullets.

    Super weapon powerups makes every weapon powerup you collect fill your
    weapon power to maximum (5 spots on the power display).


USING THE TRAINER

	FROM WORKBENCH
    ==============

    From Workbench, open the drawer containing your Gloom game. There will
    be a new icon there entitled "GloomTrainer". Double-click on this icon
    to start the trainer program.


	IF YOU OPTED TO USE THE TRAINER MENU
    ------------------------------------
    Read this if you did not specify "NOGUI" in the icon tooltypes.

	The trainer window will open allowing you to select the trainers you wish
    to use while playing the game. Initially all trainers are set to the default
    values specified in the program tooltypes.

    To activate a trainer, e.g.: Infinite lives, you must click on the
    appropriate gadget. A checkmark (tick) will appear in the box beside
    any activated trainer; if the box is empty then the trainer is inactive.

    When you have selected the trainers you want, click the "Play" gadget in the
    lower left of the window. The game will now load and run if possible.

    If you started Gloom by mistake, or have changed your mind and do
    not want to play the game right now then click the "Cancel" gadget
    in the lower right of the window..


	IF YOU OPTED TO DISABLE THE TRAINER MENU
    --------------------------------------
    Read this if you did specify "NOGUI" in the icon tooltypes.

    The game will load and run if possible. No trainer window will appear.
    Active trainers will be determined from the default values as specified
    by the other tooltypes of the GloomTrainer program.


	FROM CLI/SHELL
    ==============

    From the CLI/Shell, CD to the directory where you have Gloom installed
    and type "GloomTrainer" followed by the options you wish to activate.
    Note that if you start the trainer from CLI then options saved in the
    program's tooltypes are ignored.

    "NOGUI"
	"INF_LIVES"
	"INF_BIGGUN"
	"INF_INVIS"
	"INF_THERMO"
	"INF_BOUNCY"
	"MAXBOOSTS"
    ------------
	These command line options correspond to the tooltypes described in
    the previous section.

    For example:

    GloomTrainer NOGUI INF_LIVES

    would start Gloom and give the player infinite lives. No trainer GUI
    would appear.


TESTING INFORMATION

    Created on A1200/68030+68882-40Mhz/8Mb/KS39.106, but should run on
    any Amiga with enough RAM that the original Gloom would run on.

    If you have a problem running GloomTrainer then I WANT TO KNOW! Please,
    feel free to get in touch.
