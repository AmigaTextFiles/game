XTreme Racing Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ALL the existing original cup values have been changed in this upgrade - from
Three Wheeler to Turbo Nutter...

Could anyone who uses this patch please let me know what they think of the
new difficulty settings - race through all the cups on all difficulty levels
(NOT with the Easy control enabled), on a per track basis, for example;

Road_Circuit_1 Track	(Three Wheeler)		Just Right
			(2.0 Injection)		A little bit easy
			(Turbo Nutter...)	Too Hard

Do this for all tracks (cup mode only) - so that I can decide if our settings
are just right, or if you want them customised a bit.

I will release another Seasons files based on all your comments.

Please contact me in any of the following ways;

EMail - rich@xtreme.demon.co.uk
Snail - 5 Wyvern Close, Wellesbourne, WARKS, CV35 9TA

And if you do this - I need the info by the 7th of April 1996.
