XTreme Racing V1.1ß Aminet Upgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an upgrade to be provided on Aminet sites and Aminet CDs only.

In order to use this upgrade the user must already own a copy of
XTreme Racing. Otherwise it won't work...obviously!

NOTE : This is a BETA version. Ensure you have a backup of
XTreme Racing before installing.


Whats New?
~~~~~~~~~~

We have received hundreds of letters and emails regarding XTreme
Racing, almost all of which have been very very positive. However,
we have taken on board some of the comments made by you, the players,
and also by some magazines and have strived to improve many things
and correct a few minor bugs. The list is too big to write in full,
but here is a brief list :

Several changes on the Frontend Menus to make it more reliable and
easier to use. This includes adding an auto-save laptimes option
which many people have requested.

LapTime Displayer - This is a beta version and has a couple of changes
yet to be made, but it allows you to display laptimes and to merge
laptime tables with between several different laptime files.

4 Player Joystick Adapter Support - note that joypads cannot be
used on the 4 player adapter since the fire button doesn't work.

New Weapons - try 'em and see!

Modified some current weapons - yes! Invisibility suddenly becomes
more fun, but you will have to see why.

Much bigger differences between each car, in handling, weapon
selection, and speed. There is no real best one, but you can find
ones with handling you may prefer, and if you do well with one car
try on a more difficult one next time.

Easier easy mode - in response to comments from those who are
not so good at games a few things have been modified to stop
them giving in so easily. 

Easy Control - Each player can now individually select to use
easy control. This means that when you start playing you can 
learn to play like this, or if playing with friends you can
play with the harder but more fun control and they can play
on easy control at the same time. Players on easy control
may not save their laptimes. So there.

New Cup - the DEEEEEMOOOW Cup, this is all the extra demo tracks
rolled into one nice new spanking cup - you lucky people!!!

Volcanic Badlands Bonus tracks - both of these have been
touched up (several Lemmings removed) after popular demand.
More fun to play now - far less frustrating! :)

I'm also writing a new c2p routine for low-end 030/020 machines
with fastram that may be faster. This is not fully implented
in this version.


Why is it a Beta Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We want your comments on this version :

Is it Better? Worse? Easier? Friendlier? Better for Beginners?
And Why?

We were particularly looking to add more variety into the cars
and enable first time players to grasp the game much quicker.

Also, we want to know of any bugs or any systems that it doesn't
work on. If you find a bug then email me urgently with a full
statement of your machine setup and exactly how you made the
bug occur. We need to be able to replicate the problem in order
to solve it.

NOTE : We know of a bug when saving lap times on >1 player
currently. I'll probably replace the necessary file in a
new beta version when this is fixed, but most other stuff will
be kept for the Extra Track Discs that this upgrade is really
meant for.

then email rich@xtreme.demon.co.uk (please read the Settings 
README text for further info.)


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure you have a backup of XTR before installing this version.
We are not responsible if anything goes wrong!

Double Click on the HDInstall Icon to install this upgrade.

You will also find that we have included several of the
freebie tracks we have done for demo versions. They have
been combined into a new cup.

Also, we have included snapshots of some of the datadisc
graphics.

Editor & Extra Tracks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Editor, extra tracks, and final version of this upgrade will
be available commercially at Easter. The extra tracks are all
complete and the Editor is simply having the manual written.

But incase you didn't know....

The extra tracks (20) are fun, silly, and challenging, though we have
included a couple of easy ones for dodgy players! So if you want
to run over Elvis, a West Brom football player, drive on Lego Land
or in Hell, then you will want the extra tracks.

But the editor, now thats something else. A fully fledged track editor
that allows you to add in your own objects, tiles, and create your
own race tracks and deathmatch tracks. You can set up where the
computer cars go, add in short cuts, place Elvis whereever you want,
and basically you can do anything! It is a slightly modified version
of our own in-house editor and it has been used to create all our
tracks in a matter of hours. The editor is fully multitasking and
system compliant, and functions well on graphics boards. It does
not require any additional ram though its obviously faster to operate
with more memory. For those people with lower spec machines you can change
the screenmode to suit your need, and turn off several of the draw options.
