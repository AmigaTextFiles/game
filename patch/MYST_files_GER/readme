MYST GERMAN MISSING FILES 
-------------------------


Somehow the final version of Myst saw two English files
turn up on a German Myst CD:

- The note on Myst island on the ground when looked from the other side
- Fourth hologram speech in Channelwood temple

This archive contains both of those files + menu with "Laden" 
instead of "Load".



INSTALLATION
------------

Decompress the archive to the MYST directory on your hard drive.
