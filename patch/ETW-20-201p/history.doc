New features since ETW 2.0:

- Corrected a big bug in the offside handling...

New features since ETW 1.2:

- PowerPC version (needs ppc.library V46 and AHI). 

- 68k/chunky version (to be faster than the standard version needs
  at least a 040/40mhz).

- 50hz!
  Now ETW works internally at 50fps, previous version used to work at 25fps also
  on faster systems to be able to run the game also on lowend systems. This version
  is faster than the original one only on 040/060 based amigas and, obviously, on
  PPC equipped ones. The fact that the game logic is updated 50 times per second
  has also other intresting consequences like the fact that I've been able to improve
  goalkeeper ability and precision.

- New fields (get ETW-pitches.lha in aminet (game/data) or in surf.to/etw), 
  with a better use of the palette.

- Better CPU teams AI.

- Better goalkeepers.

- Improved control response.

- Added offside rule (optional).

- Added a NEW alternative "active player change" method, more similar to the one
  of other games (doesn't need that you left the joy to change the active player),
  enable it with PREFS->GAME->CHANGE ACTIVE = CLASSIC

- Implemented triple buffering.

- Now the game internal clock is of 1/50 of second.

- Added WPA8 fallback mode if C2P (AGA) or direct copy (CGX/P96) fails.
  On AGA you should use the newWPA8 patch to speed up things!

- Chunky and PPC version  has a new graphics mode, scaling, to be
  used if playing on the WB screen. This mode allows REALTIME scaling
  of the game graphics.

- Some bugs fixed.

- A big part of the game has been rewritten for portability.

New features since ETW 1.1:

- AHI support, ETW always use AHI unit 0 if you enable it, so set the
  unit 0 as you want, use AHI only if you have a rather powerful CPU
  (030/50 or better). With AHI enabled ETW uses less chip ram and you
  can run also two ETW copies in multitasking!

- Largely optimized the standard audio code, now it should works correcly
  also with lower configurations.

- Now if you active  "people" in the graphics menu the collision of the ball
  with the people outside the pitch are detected (and make funny noises).

- Improved the special events/leagues support, now the teamfiles converted
  from SWOS can be used to play first divisions of the various leagues
  with correct home/away balancement.

- Slightly improved goalkeepers skills, still some work to do on it...

- Improved active player change routine, now you HAVE to keep the joystick/pad
  in central position to change a man, unless you use joypad control.

- Added linesmen, you can disable them (they require about 10k of
  chip ram) from the VIDEO configuration menu.

- Now if you start a new league or a new cup the match order will be
  chosen randomly.

- New menu option to restart a competition (RESET CURRENT).

- Removed a nasty bug that can cause memory trashing after some matches
  with certain configurations.

- A lot of small changes.

New features since ETW 1.0:

- New menu option: Golden Goal
  Enable golden goal in the extra times.

- New option to play again a match without loading if you are playing a
  friendly (both arcade or simulation).

- Added keyboard control (two different types, see manual)!

- Now ETW works correctly also in 16/24/32bit Workbenches!

- Now option Audio2Fast to speed up spoken comment/crowd loading if you 
  have enough fast ram (>8mb)

- Included ASCII manual since the CD has been distributed without it (the 
  manual is very important to be able to use some features like role playing,
  hightlight saving, or active player change)!

- Resolved a big problem in the "load league/cup" code, now it works correctly.

- Removed a nasty bug that occurs during penalty shoot-out and cause weird results
  if the goalkeeper blocked the ball (fixed also another penalty related bug).

- New menu option: Force SBuffer
  Force the game in single buffering, it's useful when playing on a custom
  graphic card screen with CGX 3 to avoid certain CGX bugs in the double
  buffering handling.

- Some minor bug fixed.
