-----------------------------------------------------------------
This program is useful only for the original Worms, not Worms DC!
-----------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING! - Don't run this program until you have read this bit
           through! I will not be held responsible if this program
           accidentally deletes some of your levels or anything else
           nasty happens! (not that it should, but still...)
           If you have any levels called ?.wrm or ?.????.wrm (where ?
           is any character), you would be advised to make a backup of
           them before running the program. If everything goes according
           to plan, this program will not delete them, but just in case
           something goes wrong and it does, it's not my fault!

This program is totally freely distributable, as long as this doc file is
supplied too, because it contains vital information on setting things up.
Please distribute it everywhere, eg Aminet, Cover CDs, etc etc etc.


Introduction:
             Three of the things that really annoyed me about Worms were:

1) There is a limit on how many custom levels you can have, and
2) You cannot select a random level from within the game.
3) You have to remember the names of the levels, the game doesn't give you
   a nice requestor or anything.

This program is a partial solution to these very annoying faults.


Setting Up:      <<<< IMPORTANT, NEEDS TO BE DONE BEFORE IT WILL WORK! >>>>

First of all, this program needs AMOS.Library. Copy this to your
Libs: directory (you probably already have it in there, anyway, but it is
included in this archive in case you don't). 

This program won't work off floppy disks very well at all, it is
best used if Worms is installed to hard disk. 

Copy the WormLevs executable (and the docs!!) to your Worms root directory 
(eg Work:Games/Worms) and run it. The first time you run it, this program 
will create a directory called STORAGE in the TWCUSTOM directory, and move 
all the Worms levels from TWCUSTOM in there. 

Now, the Program will then pick 26 random levels from the storage directory
in TWCUSTOM, and copy them into TWCUSTOM/A.WRM, TWCUSTOM/B.WRM, etc, up to
Z.WRM. Now run Worms, play the game as normal, and when you type in a level 
name, type a letter from A to Z. This will be a random level.


Recommended way of running the game:

                CD Work:Games/Worms             (or wherever it is)
                WormLevs                        (Run Random Level Selector)

.....then run the game as normal. If you only have 2 Mb, it would be wise
to reset the machine after running WormLevs, and then run Worms.

This program also takes into account the friction / gravity settings as
well, eg if a level is TWCUSTOM/Storage/CoolLevel.2413.WRM, it will be
copied as TWCUSTOM/A.2413.WRM. So you can still play the levels as they
were meant to be played.

To speed things up a little, if you don't think you're going to need 26
custom levels in one Worms session, you can specify your own number on the
command line. So instead of typing "Wormlevs" to run it, you would type
"Wormlevs 10" to copy 10 levels instead of 26 (Without the quotes).


ADVANCED USE:

It may be nice having hundreds of Worms levels on your hard drive, but they
do take up quite a lot of disk space, don't they? One solution to this
problem it to use Powerpacker to crunch the Worms levels (shareware version
2.3b on fish disk 253, or commercial version 3.0 on CU floppy disk 32
(that's the May 1992 edition!!), or you might be able to find version four
somewhere), and use a utility called Powerpacker Patcher (fish disk 601, 542,
or 515) to unpack them. The Powerpacker Patcher program can be run either 
before WormLevs, then you don't need to run it when playing Worms, or it can
be run just before playing worms, that way you don't need it when running 
WormLevs. The choice is yours.


Oh, by the way, for some strange reason, if you Powerpack the WormLevs
executable, instead of quitting properly, you get a lovely black screen and
everything locks up. Wierd or what?


Hope you find this little utility useful, I know I did.
Sorry it is a little rough around the edges, I did just about everything I
could about this, but this is a utility mainly written for myself, and if
anyone else can find a use for it then great, but they've got to set it up!

Oh, and by the way, as you probably guessed, this utility was written in
Amos. Yes, I know Amos is getting on a bit now, but it does the job. It
just needs a serious update, that's all! (Like AGA support and commands
that take less than half an hour to put a line of text on the screen, and
displays that don't corrupt when they're in a bad mood, etc etc..... some
texture mapping commands would be nice as well..... :-)

How does this program relate to "Worms: The Director's Cut"?

   Erm, I can't adapt it for it because I have never seen the game!
   Maybe some of these omissions that this program attemps to patch are
   not present in Worms DC. It probably won't work with Worms DC.

   I wish Team 17 would do a cheap (ie about £5) upgrade offer for the 
   owners of the original Worms to upgrade to Worms DC. It's very 
   annoying to pay £20 for the original worms, and then have Worms DC 
   coming out and the only way to get it is to pay ANOTHER £20 for it!
   Come on, Team 17, you're a great company, so do the right thing!!!



Program History (The Pointless Bit!)


Version 1.00 (30.08.1996)

First Release. Released on CU Amiga CD-Rom 6.
                                                               

Version 1.10 (07.06.1997 released 10.10.1997)

Arbitary limit of 500 worms levels increased to 1000.
Checking included for 1000 level limit (so it won't crash out!)
You don't need the Worms: assign if WormLevs is run from the Worms dir.
Compiled with a later version of the compiler (takes up a lot less disk
space, 23k instead of 49k!!, even with the extra goodies)
E-Mail address included.
Professional title screen ;-)
Version string information in main executable (very handy, not...)
Now uses AmigaDOS copy command to copy files instead of messy AMOS code.
(That does however mean that you cannot have a space character in the path)
Deletes levels from previous run automatically (no need to mess around
with scripts)
Now with automatic TWCustom/Storage setup - no need to do it yourself!
Can now specify how many levels to copy via the command line.






















Oh, by the way, here is something really useless.....

Unpack it, and you'll see.....
