Welcome to InstallWizard.

InstallWizard will allow you to create installer install-scripts and sources
templates/Makefiles in a totally guided process.

Of course, 90% of the work is still to be done on the loader source (and some work
is to be done also on the install-script), but at least it will save you the
hassle of misplaced parenthesis, restless copy/paste, unmatched names between
the loader and the install script, tooltypes forgotten, files non copied.

Okay, the dox are very small and the program is widely untested, but you've got
the source (installer script/other text files), so you can correct/improve, and if
you do so, I'd be grateful if you send me the changes.


The ConfigInstall installer script allows to set (and save) the environment variables
holding your personal data:

$INSTALLROOT: root of the directories containing the user files (install-script,
              readme, other files)

$LOADERDEVROOT: root of the directories containing the developper files (loader source,
                Makefile, empty loader + icon)

$EDITOR: path to the editor used


Enjoy.

InstallWizard tries to be compatible with Commodore/AT Installer and the excellent
and supported InstallerNG. You can report all incompatibilities.

PS:

InstallWizard uses the amiga port of the unix command sed. The binary of the command
is provided in the package.

SED 2.05:
Uploader <scherer@genesis.informatik.rwth-aachen.de>
Type: util/gnu

This is GNU SED 2.05 for the Commodore Amiga.  The port is based on the
unmodified GNU SED source archive sed-2.05.tar.gz, which is assumed as a
prerequisite, and was done with SAS/C++ 6.55 (no ixemul.library needed).
