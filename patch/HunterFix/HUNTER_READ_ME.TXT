Hunter AGA working version quick notes
--------------------------------------

 There were a quite a few problems with this game, which is why we have
written this document to make things trouble free for you.  

Firstly the problems encountered were self modifying code in the boot
routine that stopped the game from even booting.  Secondly the disk
routines were timed by the Processor, which is a seriously bad thing to do!
Also the extra memory routine did not work either. 

So those problems have been fixed.  As a side effect to this, the save
routine is now a little more cumbersome to use, but once you get used to
it, you will find it quite easy.

When you come to the DISK OPTIONS screen and you want to load your SAVE
GAMES, make sure you PUT THE SAVE GAME DISK IN THE DRIVE BEFORE YOU CLICK
ON THE GADGET TO LOAD THE SAVE GAME!  Otherwise, the game will assume that
the disk allready present in the drive is the save game disk and the
information that it reads for the directory will be corrupted.  It wont
make it crash, but it just looks decidedly messy.  The same also goes for
the INIT DISK gadget.  Follow the same procedure and you wont go wrong.

A classic game that deserved to get a welcome A1200 fix, and you will
notice that it is also smoother as well.
