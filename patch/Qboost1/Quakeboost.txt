This is a pakfile for quake, designed for
better framerates during deathmatch games.

List of improvements:

 - Fire is disabled! (fastquake only speeds up the
   timerefresh routine. No actual inprovement when playing)
   My modification works in multiplayer mode too!

 - Missile, grenade and thunderbolt are all less cpu-hungry

 - New crosshair (not a speedup, but more precise than the original)



Instructions:
1) Move the pak0.pak to your gamedir.
2) Start quake.

This is "campaign-ware", meaning that if you like
this modification, send an email to clickboom and
ask them about the QuakeWorld conversion.

Quakeworld is network/internet-play optimized
version of quake.
Even if you have a slow connection like an 28K modem,
precise movement and aiming is possible in QuakeWorld.
In normal quake, even a 2Mbit connection to the internet
is not enough for smooth updates.
This is the reason, that nearly all quakeservers worldwide
are set up for quakeworld.
I have reserched into Quakeworld for amiga, and as far as I
know, clickboom has been working on the conversion for a
looong time, but I haven't heard any news since april 98!
