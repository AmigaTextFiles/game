RELEASE 2 (Kickstart 1.x Bug-Fix)
---------------------------------

1. 1.x-Bug
----------

The Trainer should work on 1.x machines now. I used dos.RunCommand to
start frontier in the first version which is a 2.0-Function (V36).

Now the trainer's behaviour has changed:

Running from OS-1.x :

 dos.CreateProc to start frontier
 sends a imitated WBStartupMessage, because Frontier thinks that it
 was started from workbench (CreateProc does not create a cli-environement)

 Very hacky but working! 

Running from OS-2.x/3.x :

 dos.CreateNewProc to start frontier from a safe cli-environement, no
 tricks and hacks

 Should even work on future kickstart-versions

Thanks to Gary Streeter and to Willem Dijkstra for reporting this bug.

2. Frontier-exit-bug
--------------------

A patch exists which allows you to quit frontier. Now the trainer supports
this ability and quits too.

Thanks to Erik Gerl for mentioning this.

FRONTIER TRAINER
----------------

This trainer has a lot of interresting features and gives you a lot of fun
(ever flown a long range cruiser? No! With this trainer your dreams will
become true!!!).

IMPORTANT
---------

This programm can be freely distributed as long as no fee is charged on
the programm or the documentation.
You use this programm at your own risk. I am not responsible for any damage
caused by this programm in a direct or indirect way.

INSTALLATION
------------

This is a very simple task because the programm does not need to make any
modifications on the original frontier programm. All what you have to do is
to start frontier through the trainer.

Make a copy of your original game and copy the file "FrntTrainer" to the
copied disk. Delete all in the startup-sequence and write
"frnttrainer frontier".
The stack command is not necessary because the trainer sets the stack
correctly (80 kB should be enough).

Now, boot from this disk and wait until the game starts.

HOW TO USE THE TRAINER
----------------------

Press the "DEL" key to activate the trainer (you will see
a short green flash). Press it again to deactivate (now
the flash will be red).

If the trainer is active following options are avaiable.

press LEFT SHIFT and

P   - Increases the number of shields

D   - Selects the next higher hyper-drive-class
      (have you known that the military drive class 4 is
      not the highest one, there is a unknown hyperdrive
      with the same jump distance as the hyperdirve class 8,
      but it uses military fuel)

S   - Selects the next ship (Wow, Longe Range Cruisers and
      Lynx Bulk Carriers are NOW avaiable and you can take
      a look at the famous thargoid ship... it looks like
      a pink frisby in space) If you want to fly a ship
      with its initial specifications just sell it and by
      it back, and you can take a look at the datas of the
      ship: thruster acceleration, crew members and so on.
      But never sell the thargoid ship - the game will
      crash!

0   - Increases the number of gun mountings (4 is the maximum).

1-4 - Selects the next larger gun on the front, the back,
      the top or the bottom turret. Please notice that there
      are different sizes of each gun type. If you want to
      change your gun type you have to press the key a few
      times.

R   - Clears the criminal records... YEAHHH I'm so clean!!!

C   - Increases the number of cabins by one.

Y   - Increases the cargo space by 100 t (up to 8000t).
Z     on english keyboards

M   - Increases money by 10'000'000 credits.

F   - Fills the internal fuel tank.

I   - Changes the ship-id to "TERROR".

A   - Press this one and shoot a ship. You will be on the next
      level in your combat rating

Q   - Same as "A" but for federal rank. Just press it and do
      a delivery mission and you will get a reputation.

W   - Same as "Q" but for your imperial rank.

REMARK: Don't forget to collect all medals by flying each mission
        type one time



press RIGHT SHIFT and

P   - Decreases the number of shields

D   - the next lower hyper drive class.

S   - the previous ship (you can even fly missiles and mines)
      Get the missile, sell it and by it back and you will fly
      a "ship" with 60.5 g main thruster acceleration (12.1 on
      the retros). If you use LEFT SHIFT and "S" again you can
      fly every ship with this incredible acceleration values!
      I recommend you to play some 'cat and mouse games' with
      pirates and police vipers (it's really funny!!!).
      Switch to the outside view and take a look at the thrusters
      of an Imperial Courier or Trader with maximum acceleration-
      WHHHOOOOOOWWWWW!!!!!!

0   - Decreases the number of gun mountings.

1-4 - Selects the next smaller gun on the front, the back,
      the top or the bottom turret.

C   - Decreases the number of cabins

Y   - Decreases the cargo space
Z     on english keyboards

M   - Decreases money




I hope you will have fun with this little cheat programm. It was coded in
OBERON-II.

I did my best to make the trainer safe, but sometimes the game will crash,
especially changing the ship on the fly is a little bit dangerous! Save
your game frequently while you are using the trainer!

Don't worry about some graphic trash that will appear some times. You can
prevent this by reducing the size of your gun.

Changing the ship upwards will cause hull damage. This happens because your
old ship's hull mass is not the same as the new one's. Frontier thinks that
the difference of both is the amount of hull damage. Increase your cargo
space and your money and buy a hull auto-repair system.

Sometimes the trainer doesn't react to your key strokes, especialy a problem 
on slow amigas. Hit the key more than one time until a white flash appears
and/or switch to a less cpu-intense screen (status, cargo list...).




Please forgive me David Braben (and all others of the programming team),
I've not cracked your wonderful game! I bought the original german release
and played it until I got the rank of a Colonel. After this I was bored to
death because the next ranks seem to be unreachable, so I decided to write
a little cheat.

PLEASE REMARK : THIS PROGRAMM DOES NOT REMOVE THE COPY PROTECTION!!!
                I NEVER WROTE AND I NEVER WILL WRITE A FRONTIER-CRACK!

Greetings to Mr. Braben and his developping team (and every frontier-hero!),
great game, great programm, please continue, we all are waiting for 
FRONTIER-II!!!
