TITLE

    SetJoyPort



VERSION

    1.00


DESCRIPTION

    This is version 1.00 of a patch program to improve the chances of
    you being able to use a CD32 style joypad with your games.

    There is a known problem with Commodore's lowlevel.library and faster
    CPUs which prevents the library from correctly determining the type of
    controller you have attached. SetJoyPort allows you to specify the type
    of controller attached to individual ports, thereby improving the
    chances of games using lowlevel.library working with joypads on 040 or
    060 accelerated machines.

INSTALLATION


    No Installer script is provided because installation is so easy!

    To install SetJoyPort, simply copy the "SetJoyPort" program to a
    directory on your command path, for example, "SYS:c/"

    copy SetJoyPort SYS:c/


USING SETJOYPORT

    CLI use only. SetJoyPort *will* crash if started from Workbench!

    SYNOPSIS:
    SetJoyPort [PORTn=AUTO|JOYSTICK|JOYPAD|MOUSE]

    PARAMETERS:
    PORTn: specify the type of controller which is attached to a specific
           port.

      "n":      Specify the port number to set the controller type for.
                "n" must be a digit between 0 and 3, for example "PORT1".

                Port 1 is the port which is generally used for game
                controllers. Port 0 is the port which is generally
                used as a mouse port.

      AUTO:     This is the default setting. lowlevel.library will attempt
                to automatically determine the type of controller that is
                attached to the speified port.

      JOYSTICK: Inform lowlevel.library that there is a standard digital
                joystick attached to the specified port.

      JOYPAD:   Inform lowlevel.library that there is a CD32 compatible
                joypad game controller attached to the specified port.

      MOUSE:    Inform lowlevel.library that there is a standard Amiga
                mouse attached to the specified port.


    EXAMPLES:
    SetJoyPort
      - All ports are set to type "AUTO"

    SetJoyPort PORT1=JOYPAD
      - Port 1 is set to type "JOYPAD", meaning there is a CD32 compatible
        joypad game controller attached to the port. Ports 0,2 and 3 are
        set to type "AUTO".

    SetJoyPort PORT0=JOYSTICK PORT1=JOYPAD
      - Port 1 is set to type "JOYPAD", meaning there is a CD32 compatible
        joypad game controller attached to the port. Port 0 is set to type
        "JOYSTICK", meaning there is a standard digital joystick attached
        to the port. Ports 2 and 3 are set to type "AUTO".


    NOTES:
    SetJoyPort is intended to be executed immediately before starting a
    game which has control problems, for example, in the script file which
    is used to set up game ASSIGNs etc. It may not function properly or
    there may be undesirable side effects if it it used outside of this
    context.

    If you specify the wrong controller type for a port, you may find that
    the controller you do have attached does not work properly! Be careful!

    This program can possibly only help with games that use lowlevel.library
    to read the game controller ports. If the game has its own faulty built
    in routines to get the controller information, SetJoyPort can do nothing
    to help you. If you're not sure, try it and see. It might work, but it
    might not. Either way you havent lost anything.

    For those who are interested, the patch works by calling the
    lowlevel.library function SetJoyPortAttrsA() for each port to set the
    controller type, so bypassing the faulty controller type detection
    routines.

    Created on A1200/68030+68882-40Mhz/8Mb/KS39.106.

    If you have a problem running SetJoyPort then I WANT TO KNOW!
    Please, feel free to get in touch. I don't bite!
