LLamatron patch, version 1.0 by Kjetil Jacobsen, (C) Ymir's Thoughts 1994

Usage:	LLamatron [-1 -2] [Gamefile]
	where -2 loads the 512kb version, and -1 the (default) 1mb version.
	Gamefile (with full path) must be specified if the TRON** files are
	not in the current directory.

Requires original LLamatron TRON512 or TRON1MEG file. ONLY the loader has been
patched (currently), so don't expect this game to behave like a lamb. It's still
raping the system, and should soforth not be started when multitasking I/O.
DO NOT START LLAMATRON IF YOU HAVE ENFORCER, MUNGWALL, ETC. RUNNING.

INSTALLATION:
For floppy systems just copy the patched loader over the old one, and boot
normally (remember 'LLamatron -2' for 512k users). HD users should copy the
TRON1MEG or the TRON512 file (not supplied) and install the loader prog in
the same directory (or to somewhere in the path).

Example (Assumes 'LLamatron' isn't in the path):
To start LLamatron with the loader file in games:misc and the TRON1MEG file
in bogo:mips you'd write :
	bogo:mips/LLamatron -1 games:misc/TRON1MEG

FAILURE:
The patch will report failure if the loader is in danger of "oveloading" itself
when reading the gamefile. This can be caused by shortage of chipmem, or just
bad luck: the os decided to load the loader in the address-area where the game-
file is to be put. This scheme could (and will later) be avoided by moving the
loader to a safer area. Otherwise there should be no problem reading the game-
file from ram:, etc.

Report bugs, improvements, etc to kjetilja@stud.cs.uit.no

IMPROVEMENT SINCE LAST VERSION:
	You should now be able to easily start LLamatron from an icon.
	More userfriendly command-line interface.

TODO:	Make LLamatron return system (implies a major rewrite in TRON** files)
	Use audio.device to reset audio-dma
	Make a 'force load' option to avoid memory overlap between loader/game
