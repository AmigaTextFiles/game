This archive includes a replacement startup-script for Banshee, along with
Embedder II v1.0, for use with the game Banshee on A4000 computers (tested on
A4000/040).  Embedder v2.0 does not work for Banshee in place of v1.0, so do
not use that version.

To install this fix, simply drag the "Banshee" and "Embedder" icons into the
Banshee game directory.  Banshee itself should be installed using the
installer that came with the game.  Banshee should then run by double-clicking
the "Banshee" icon from Workbench.

Enjoy!

Credits belong to Carleton Tsui for discovering this fix, and Bigmama/Balance
for creating Embedder.  I simply modified Banshee's startup-script and
uploaded this to Aminet.
