Version:  1.0

This is a patchfile for Frontier (Release 2G) 1.01 (german version)
which corrects nearly all bad translated german strings and fixes
some minor bugs.


Requirements:
-------------

Frontier (Release 2G) 1.01.

You can search for the string "Release" with a hex editor to
determine which version you have.


How to use:
-----------

Copy your original "Frontier" file into this directory and type

    spatch Frontier

This creates a new patched and playable file named "Frontier.new".


More info:
----------

- The patch corrects a great amount of text strings in the "Frontier"
  binary file. This affects the bad translation and cuts some strings
  which are too long to display at the screen.
- Van Maanens Star is now selectable.
- While playing the intro you can exit the program pressing X.


Have fun playing Frontier :-)
