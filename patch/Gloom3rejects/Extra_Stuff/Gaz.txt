 Hey all, welcome to Gloom 3 Ze! Basically I hope you enjoy this
 game alot and enjoy one of the first of many CD-ROM titles
 which will bring the Amiga back into the 20th Century!

 I assume since you've got an Amiga with a CD-ROM drive and a
 Harddrive that you're serious about Amiga and no doubt you've
 got extra ram and even an accelerator too. So the better the
 Amiga you have the better Gloom 3 will be, a reward for you
 upgrading your Amiga and keeping the Market alive. Buying this
 game shows that you support the Amiga and I thank you for
 spending your hard earned cash on my game ;-)

 I'd like to wish Gateway 2000 and Amiga International good
 luck in their mission to revive the best machine of all
 time! I definately think that PPC Amigas are the way forward
 and the next thing I'll be buying is a PPC board and a gfx card!
