The contents of this drawer are basically things which are related to the
production of Gloom 3 Ze. Included are rejected Sounds and Graphics which
can be viewed by clicking on the 'Rejects' icon. And also available are
readme's by me (Gareth Murfin).
In the SRC dir you will find the source code for the optimised c2p routines,
If you can do better then make your own and eMail them to me.
