XTreme Racing uncrunched season files
=====================================

What do they do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These allow you to edit cups/seasons and add your own, there are a few
restrictions to watch out for (they are also commented in the season files),
the main restrictions are:

Maximum of 12 cups (of 5 tracks - 4 race, 1 bonus)
Maximum of 6 seasons (with up to 4 cups in each)

We offer no other instructions - just follow our example, and BACK-UP YOUR
OLD SEASON FILE!
If you make a mistake in the file, the game won't run.

The season file doesn't have to be crunched to run, these uncrunched versions
will work fine with the game unless you mess them up.
