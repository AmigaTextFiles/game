AFAFconverter

        This utility is used to create/replace the audio files in VGP. Those audio files are placed
in the AudioVideo/ drawer.
        To create a new audio file you must supply a 28kHz sampled mono AIFF file (it can be either
8 or 16bit quality - 16bit audio is replayed by the 14bit routines of VGP):

        AFAFconverter AIFFfile AFAFfile
        
        The AFAF file so created can be used to replace the ones in the AudioVideo/ drawer. Simply
create a new AudioVideo/ drawer in the directory/partition of your HD you have installed VGP onto,
and put there the file so obtained with the name of the file you want to replace. As an example,
provided you want to replace the "Virtual Grand Prix" speech you hear when the first requester
pops up, simply name it "virtualgrandprix.afaf".
        Pay only attention to the fact that very long files are animation ones, and if you replace
them you won't see the animation(s) any more...


TextureConverter

        This is used to replace VGP ingame textures, such as ads. The syntax is:
        
        TextureConverter IFFfile VerBrush.data Number
        
        where the VerBrush.data is the file in the Dati/ drawer to be updated (it must be on the HD,
of course). The IFF file is the texture, stored in the standard ILBM format, that must be
512x64x128 colors - you can paint it with you preferred painting tool. The texture itself should be
256x64x128 colors, but because VGP uses mip-mapping you should provide 128x64, 64x64 and 32x64
textures too that must be packed side to side (the last 32x64 is unused but MUST be provided), so
you end up in a 512x64 wide texture. The colors used must come from the VGP palette, use the Unnamed
brush included as an example on colors and how the texture must be.
        The Number is the number of the texture to be replaced. The original VGP distribution has:

22      Morse ad
23      PIAA ad (side of Tyrrell)
24      Fondmetal ad (wings of Minardi)

26      Shell ad
27      Mobil 1 ad
28      Agip ad
29      Renault ad
30      Foster ad
31      Islona ad

        The last 16 textures are used only in the MonteCarlo track and are building ones.
        
        You can specify a number beyond 47, in that case the new texture will be appended to the end
of the file. It won't be used at the moment, of course, but this way you can add your personal
textures to be used by user-defined objects (more on this point in the next upgrades...)

        
NEW CAR OBJECTS

        Put the .3do files in the Blocchi/ drawer to see the new, more detailed models of these cars.
Give me time and I'll upload all the improved car objects (though a fast Amiga is recommended because
of the higher number of vertexes/polygons)
