  The default icons are in MWB style, because I like MWB very much.
  But if you are a NewIcons user (nice too) you possibly dislike
  this icons. You can replace the drawer icon and the game icon
  easily. Just open a shell and do something like this.


  Copy ram:mydrawer.info dh0:CoolInstaller/dat/def_drawer.info
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        Your new icon                          replace old drawer
  

 Additionally to def_drawer.info (the drawer icon) there`s 
 def_game.info (the game icon). You can replace it by the
 same script. 

 Of course you can use a directory manager like the famous
 DirOpus for those operations (is there really anybody who
 does this like this??)

 If you`ve really problems with this, mail me, let`s see
 what we can do.

@node "search" "Searching..."

  Hi!

  I want to upgrade my A1200 and searching for a 060 turboboard. If
  someone sells such a board, contact me (softwarefailure@dame.de).

  Thanxxx & enjoy this new version of DCI, Greets & best wishes,

                                                          Andreas

@node "key" "The keyfile"

  The Keyfile is file which must be copied to devs:. With the keyfile are the
  disabled @{"options" link "option"} useable and you have automatically the full version
  of the InstallKit, logical!

  You get the keyfile when you send US$15 or 20DM and the filled in
  @{"Registration form" link "register"} to @{"me" link "autor"}.
 
  It isn`t allowed to spread the keyfile! In the keyfile is your
  complete adress saved. Spreaded keyfiles are an act of software piracy!

@endnode

@node "wasmacht" ""

  dA cOOL iNSTALLER (DCI) installs nearly every standard Amiga DOS
  game/demo on your harddisk.

  DCI has powerful features. If the game/demo is ECS, DCI degrades 
  the computer to ECS. (not in the unreg. version)
 
  DCI can install games/demos with more disks too.

  A trackdisk.device emulation is finally in work and will be
  present in one of the next versions. Have a look at @{"History" link "history"}.
  
  Installing a game/demo is as easy as possible.
  See how @{"easy" link "ques"} it is.

@node "System" "System Vorraussetzungen"

  To use dA cOOL iNSTALLER you need at least an Amiga (oh, can`t I use
  it on PeeZee ?) with harddisk and OS2.0. 

  dA cOOL iNSTALLER should be compatible up to A4000/060. It was successfully
  tested on A1200/030, A1200/040, A4000/040. I think there shouldn`t
  be any problems on higher machines. If there are, try to disable the
  caches, if my system patches are failing.  

  dA cOOL iNSTALLER needs also the reqtools.library (© by Niço François)
  in libs:. I`ve stored it in the dA cOOL iNSTALLER`s dir in libs/. Too
  bad that Niço quit the scene :-(

  Additionally you must have the Workbench installed on your harddisk and
  boot with it.

@endnode

@node "ques" "Installing a game/demo"

  It`s so easy.......

  I`ll explain it to your in three simple steps:

  1) Start dA cOOL iNSTALLER
  2) Select the destination path
  3) Insert a game or demo disk in DF0:

  THAT WAS IT! ALL IS DONE! Now start the game/demo and @{"register" link "register}.


  If you`re a registered user, these options appear
  somewhen in the installation procedure:

  1) Do you wanna use EmulateECS option? 
  2) Shall a drawer be created?
  3) if yes -> enter name

  EmulateECS degrades your computer to an unexpanded A500. You
  are now able to boot all your old games.

@endnode

@node "option" "Starting a game/demo"

  Simply doubleclick the icon.

  If the game doesn`t start, there`re several possibilities why,

  1) the game/demo uses a trackdisk loader, these games/demos can`t be installed yet (read history)
  2) the game/demo must be degraded (only @{"registered" link "register} version
  3) other error !?
  
@endnode

@node "history" "History"

  V1.0: (Shareware Release Version)

  - installs games/demos
  - DegradeECS option
  - reqtools.library (© Niço François) support 
  - not keyfile compatible
  - Amiga Guide® Documentation

  
  V1.1: (Shareware Release Version)

  - Keyfile support
  - only some little system changes
  - new Amiga Guide® Documentation
  - Bugs fixed


  V1.2: (Shareware Release Version)

  - fixed a fatal bug, you can now
    abort all operations. Sorry,
    I was blind :)
 
 
  V1.3: (Shareware Release Version)

  - fixed some nervy bugs
  - added option: You can now
    give the drawer a name of your choice
    (not only DaThing...)
  - first tries on trackdisk.device emulation 
    (not implemented)
 

  Future plans:

  - trackdisk.device emulation. Note: The trackdisk.device
    emulation is nearly finished, but now I`ve to inbuild
    it in dA cOOL iNSTALLER and that`s not easy. My emulation
    does not work with every trackdisk DOS game but with
    a lot. Let`s see what I can do.  
  - locale.library support
  - more configurable
  - more options
  - your plan -> contact @{"me" link "autor"}

@endnode

@node "Cardware" "Shareware"

  This program is Shareware. If you like & use it @{"register" link "register"}  yourself by
  sending $15 (20DM) with the filled-in @{"Registration form" link "register"} to
  @{"this" link "autor"} adress. You`ll get a keyfile which enables the disabled options.
  So you have a lot more @{"features" link "option"}.

  Additionally I`m interested in errors or suggestions to dA cOOL iNSTALLER.
  Take a look @{"here" link "autor"}.    
@endnode

@node "why" "Was bringt mir die Vollversion?"

 The fullversion (=@{"keyfile" link "key"}) has a lot of really cool features:

 1. Install games/demos with more than 1 disk
 2. Don`t wait 1 min till the game/demo starts
 3. Degrade your computer for ECS games/demos
 4. Install non-bootable games/demos

 and more because of the future versions which run with the @{"keyfile" link "key"} undisabled,
 of course.

 @{"Register" link "register"} now.
