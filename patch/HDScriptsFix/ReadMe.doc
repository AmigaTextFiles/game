| HD Install Scripts |
 --------------------


Here are some install scripts for the following games :

    - Beneath a steel sky

    - Flashback

    - King's Quest VI


This scripts are AmigaDos Scripts. I made them because Flashback
doesn't have any installation program and the two others come with
a very slow one (I wonder what it does during such a long time).


You use these scripts at your own risks. I can't be responsible for
any damage caused to your hard drive using them. I tested them on an
Amiga 1200 and I don't have any problem.


For comments or critics, I can be joined here :

Theses scripts are FREEWARE. But I keep a copyright on them.
You can diffuse them freely if you don't alter them.

Aminet, Fred Fish and Amiga magazines are allowed to include
these scripts in their collections. Public Domain organizations
also have this authorization if the price of the support is not
too high. France Festival Distribution WILL NEVER BE ALLOWED to
diffuse these script.

But if the authors or the compagnies the games belong to don't want me
to diffuse these scripts I will put them back from the Freeware world.
