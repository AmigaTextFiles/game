F/A-18 Interceptor is a marvelous program. Unfortunately, for $50, you
have to turn a cardboard "code wheel" every 5 minutes. This is idiocy.
I refuse to be humiliated this way after I paid so much money for the
program.

Someone sent me patch instructions to use with newzap, and I incorporated
them into a program to automate the patching. I suppose someone could come
up with a better patch, but this can do for now. You still have to answer
the question, but the answer is always 0000.

Instructions:

Use a copy of your original disk.
Unshar and uudecode.
Run f18fix and put your copy in DF0: when asked.
The disk whirs a few seconds and it's done.
The code response will always be 0000 from this point on.

DISCLAIMER

I am not responsible if you trash your disks with this program. Use
it at your own risk.

If you don't like what I'm doing, or think I advocate software piracy,
get stuffed. If you do like what I'm doing, may you live a long life,
your children have the normal number of limbs, etc...

* F/A-18 Interceptor is a Trademark of Electronic Arts and probably Robert
  Dinnerman too.
