@node "wasmacht" "Introduction"

  Da Cool Booter (DCB) is a reboot-starter for games/demos/programs
  which need the full amount of chip memory or don`t like to be ran
  from Workbench! 

  Some programs that need the full chip memory:

  · Capital Punishment
  · Hoi AGA
  · Wendetta 2175
  · Switchback
  · Whammer Slammer
  · ....

  Some programs which don`t like to be ran from Workbench:

  · Monkey Island I+II
  · Indiana Jones III+IV
  · Big Top o' Fun
  · Windsurf Willy
  · Prospector
  · ....

  Additionally Da Cool Booter can boot directly your DMS disks! For
  this feature you need the program DMS2HD (Aminet: util/arc/DMS2HD1_x.lha)
  installed in C:. This feature does of course only work with DMS disks
  in DOS format!  

  There are some other programs which do nearly the same than Da Cool Booter,
  but here`s why you should use DCB:

  · it`s really easy to use: Simply select a file and DCB will boot it or
    create a script for you so that you can easily start it without launching
    DCB Gui first

  · it`s highly optimized and system-friendly
   
  · it has some nice extra features ;-)

  Booting a game/demo is really easy.
  See how easy you can @{"do" link "ques"} it.

@node "ques" "Booting a game"
 
 After starting Da Cool Booter a requester appears which welcomes you
 to the program. 

 If you select 'Continue' now, a filerequester pops up asking you for
 a file to boot. Three different filetypes can be booted:

 a) Executable: An standard AmigaDOS executable. This is the most common
                type. 
 
 b) Script: An AmigaDOS script which can be executed with IconX or Execute.
            
 c) DMS Archive: As the name says the filetype is DMS. The unpacked archive
                 has to be an AmigaDOS disk of course. NDOS disks are not
                 supported and will never be, because that`s impossible.

 If you`ve selected a DMS archive another requester will ask you if this
 is the only disk the game/demo/program has or if it consists of more than
 one disk. If this is the case you can enter how many disks shall be booted
 else. If you`re using the BootDMS feature the first time you also have to
 supply a temporary directory where the archives will be unpacked in. 

 After that you can select if you want to boot the file now or if you want
 Da Cool Booter to create a script for you.
 
 a) Boot now: This will load in the file and reset your Amiga. Then the game/
              demo/program will be booted.

 b) Create Script: This will place a script with an icon in the selected file`s
                   directory. If you click this icon then, the game will be
                   started with a reboot.

 That was it!! Everything is done. Of course the reboot start will not work with
 all games/demos/programs but it should work with the most. You can contact me
 if you`ve problems in getting your favourite game/demo/program working.
