It Came From The Desert - Bug Fix
Author: Spyridon Papakotsis
Version: 1.3

This program fixes the "Billy Bob Bug", which causes the game to
crash if you choose "Flee" when Billy Bob Morse pulls out a knife
at the Neptune Hall, on the 6th day.

As an Extra, non-WHDLoad users have the option to replace their
HDesert script with an new one, which doesn't require Disk-1 to be
 inserted into DF0: when playing from Hard Disk.
WB 1.3 users are treated with a 4-colour game icon of an ant.

You can easily apply this fix to hard disk installed versions or
floppies, by double clicking the "Install_Patch" icon and following
the installer's instructions. Help is available for every step.

This requires the "Installer" program to be in the Path.
If you don't have it, you can look for it in the WB3.0/3.1 "Install"
disk, or preferably download Installer-43.3.lha from Aminet.

WORKBENCH 1.x users should use the Install_WB13 file in order to 
apply the fix.

Alternatively, you can just use the command line tool in the 
following manner: icfd_fix <Path to game drawer>
Example: icfd_fix DH0:Desert

If you want to fix the floppy version with the command line tool,
insert Disk 2 of the game and enter icfd_fix df0: or something
equivalent.
