@node introduction "XTRU v2.1 - Introduction"
Welcome to XTreme Racing Util,

The reason for this little utility is because some versions of XTR cant load
track files crunched with the CrM2 format. Like us, a lot of people decrunch
all the track,objects...etc files to be able to play these, and some people
probably did not even know about this problem at all.

This is where XTRU comes in, it will convert all Track,Object,Tile..etc
files from CrM2 to XPKZ and back again if need be. Also you can decrunch the
files i.e. if you decrunch Misc/CarTypes you can edit the default values for
all the cars. XTR will still load any of its game files if they happen to be
decrunched, but please note that this utility cant crunch any file that you
decrunch at this time. Although it probably will in the updated version.

XTRU has only been tested on `XTR v1.0', `XTR v1.1b Aminet Upgrade' and
the `XTR Data Disk v1.1 Upgrade (Type A)'.

The newest version does not have the same trouble with the `CrM2' format
as the earlier versions. The only other problem we can think of is track
versions. At this time XTRU has only been tested on track versions:-

                  2.11, 2.12, 2.13, 3.00 & 3.01

If you have other versions please do send them to us, so we can update
XTRU, of course only if the copyright allows.

@node req "XTRU - Requirements"
XTRU - Requirements
===================

All you need is a hard drive, a copy of XTR and the CrM.lirary if you want
to use the packing features of XTRU. The un/packing functions require quite
large amounts of memory, especially unpacking without the CrM.library
installed.


@endnode

@node Installation "XTRU - Installation"
How to install XTRU
===================

XTRU has been developed for HD users and must be used from Workbench.

Sorry floppy owners :-(

We have written a install script, so for a easy life just click the icon.

Or if you wish you can just copy the XTRU draw to where you want it, Maybe
in your XTR draw might be a good place. Then you must Assign `XTRU:' to the
place you copied XTRU  to your `user-startup' for example:-

    Assign XTRU: Work:games/XTR/XTRU

This is all the install script does anyway so we recommend you use that.

@endnode

@node usage "XTRU - Usage"
It's Installed, What now?
=========================

The first time you run XTRU you will be asked to take it into your main XTR
draw so it can find the needed files. Please note this is the main XTR draw
where you see the files `FrontEnd' and `Race', although this is checked by
XTRU just to make sure you get it right. Next XTRU will evaluate all tracks
you have installed, if any are unplayable they are moved into the `Storage'
directory.

Once XTRU has been run, a window will open with a list view and some gadgets

The list view is used to show info about the loaded track file:-

            Track name           : Name of loaded track

            Pack Type            : Is it crunched? If so what type

            Version              : Track version number(?)

            Objects              : These two list objects
            Extras               : used by the track

            Tiles                : Tiles used by the track

            BackGround           : Track background file

            LayOut               : Track layout file

            World                : Track world file

            Sound FX             : Track sounds

Any OBJECTS,TILES or BACKGROUND marked with a `*' means these files are not
installed, therefore you can't play this track.

If LAYOUT or WORLD are marked with `**' this means these files are missing
but XTR will still let you play these tracks, as these images are only used
whilst selecting what track to play on and not during the race itself. If
WORLD is marked as `N/A' the track does not need this file anyway.
DEATHMATCH tracks do not use WORLD files.

Sound FX, as far as v2.11, v2.12, v2.13, v3.00 track files are concerned this
is always `N/A' but v3.01 tracks show `Default.Sfx'. I dont no why this is
at this moment in time because the newest version of XTR that uses sound
files does not take this seting into account, it uses the preset sound file
as selected in the setup menu. This is being looked into though.

  The gadgets :-

@node history "XTRU - History"
@{b}XTRU  history@{ub}

@{b}v1.0 -> v1.3@{ub}    Internal release only.

@{b}v1.4@{ub}    First public release. 17-7-1997
        
@{b}v1.5@{ub}    First registered version, NOT! To *CRAP* not released.

        Fixed laptime bug, it would display 00.64.00 instead of 01.04.00

        Also fixed, tracks that were copied into `Storage' would not get
        converted if selected.

        Recognises v2.13 track files

        Fixed unpack bug. Would crash if a track file was not packed.

        Added PACK and AUTO PACK options.

        Added TOOL TYPES: AUTOPACK , AUTOCONV

        Changed and added to the main and remote GUI's

        Search engine now on average %96 FASTER!

@{b}v1.6@{ub}    The real registered version. ** NOT RELEASED DUE TO DELAYS **

        If CrM.library available use lib decrunch code, %2 faster than
        internal code.

        Crunch and DeCrunch now use the one buffer apart from when
        decrunching with internal code, then i use two buffers for safety.
        It likes to crash when only one is used.

        Crunch bug fixed.

@{b}v1.7@{ub}    The very real registered version.

        Fixed bug when an view option was viewed(apart from lap times), then
        lap times were viewed entries from the last view would still be in
        the display.

        Added window busy pointer.

        Added `User ID' confirmation the first time the registered version
        is run. ** THIS MUST BE THE RIGHT USER ID **

@{b}v1.8@{ub}    The new registered version.

        Fixed *MAJOR* bug! When installing new tracks that were to converted
        for some reason only known to my brain `Object' files were not
        getting converted. I don't no how this one slipped past everyone, Hey
        Andy what happened to the BETA testing? :-)

        When tracks were copied into `Storage' they were getting packed even
        if `AUTO CONV' was set to none, Fixed.

        Fixed unused shape error. May stop some of the crashing problems(?).

        Kept crashing if after packing, think the above has stopped this now.

        Tracks where getting packed if "AUTO CONV" was set to "None" and
        "AUTO PACK" was on, Fixed.

        Found a problem with some tracks,

        1) Two tile files had the wrong filename, renamed to fix.

        2) File names included the word "TILES", This caused a problem with
           the search routine which uses the word "TILE" to extract the tile
           information from the track. Fixed now but there could be a
           problem with other filenames.

        Thanks to Ross Kirk for telling us about some problems, we hope that
        they have been sorted/fixed with this new version.

@{b}v1.9@{ub}    On startup XTRU: assign checked, XTR path checked.
        Increased XTRU.KEY security.

        Fixed irregular crashing, noticed mostly while using the pack button.
        Two things caused this,

        1) unlockwindow being called when window was not locked.

        2) crm.library is opened at start of code but it was being closed
           multiple times during running instead of on program exit, but
           functions were still being called !!!

        Added feature to edit laptimes as asked for by Ross Kirk.

        Added new `Clean up' option, used for sorting all tracks that were
        installed before you owned XTRU or any tracks not installed by XTRU

        Fixed above.

        Added `Sounds' & `Missing' to the view options.

        Thanks again to Ross Kirk for his bug reports and requests.

@{b}v1.91@{ub}   Just some small tweaks, almost nothing at all.

@{b}v2.0@{ub}    Now there is only one version for registered and unregistered
        users, but unless you have a key file you will not be able to use
        the crunch functions of XTRU. Also note that the key format has
        changed.

@{b}v2.1@{ub}    Added merge laptime file function in the `EDIT TIMES' window.
        Asked for by Ross Kirk.

        Fixed a bug in the listview infomation when a track was loaded
        which used no object files, This then caused another bug in the
        conversion code. Now fixed.

        Fixed an old bug with the about requesters.

        Add track extension feature, If you design your own track this lets
        you store the `Track Name' , `Track Version' , `Release Date' ,
        `Author Name' , `Contact Text(e-mail)'. It is ignored by XTR but
        when the track is loaded into XTRU this infomation is displayed in
        the listview along with all the normal info!! Very cool!

        After testing the new merge fuction it was found that the internal
        list buffers were to small for large laptime files. The default has
        now been raised from 200 to 400, Also a new tool type has been added
        to alow for larger buffer sizes. The maximum is only limited by
        memory and the minimum is limited to 200 even if the tool type is
        set lower.

        Fixed an old bug while viewing `MISSING'.

        While viewing `TRACKS' you can now double click on a track name and
        XTRU will then load that track.

        Fixed another bug with the view `MISSING' code. This is it Andy!

        Fixed more problemes with window locking.

XTRU - Load Gadget
==================

Load a track and view info, the list view is used to display info about
the loaded track file:-

            Track name           : Name of loaded track

            Pack Type            : Is it crunched? If so what type

            Version              : Track version number(?)

            Objects              : These two list objects
            Extras               : used by the track

            Tiles                : Tiles used by the track

            BackGround           : Track background file

            LayOut               : Track layout file

            World                : Track world file

            Sound FX             : Track sounds

Any OBJECTS,TILES or BACKGROUND marked with a `*' means these files are not
installed, therefore you can't play this track.

If LAYOUT or WORLD are marked with `**' this means these files are missing
but XTR will still let you play these tracks, as these images are only used
whilst selecting what track to play on and not during the race itself. If
WORLD is marked as `N/A' the track does not need this file anyway.
DEATHMATCH tracks do not use WORLD files.

Sound FX, as far as v2.11 , v2.12 , v3.00 track files are concerned this is
always `N/A' but v3.01 tracks show `Default.Sfx'. Maybe this means that
there will be external sound files!?

This is an example of a loaded track file, this track is (c) Ross Kirk.

XTRU - XPKZ >< CrM2 conversion
==============================

When you install a new track(s) try and play on them, if XTR complains then
load up XTRU, Then:

 A) Check to make sure you have all objects,tiles...etc
 B) If its `Pack Type' is CrM2 convert it to XPKZ and try again.

When you do convert the track it is changed and all the other files are
tested to see if they are packed then converted. When we get a new track we
always convert it even if the track shows XPKZ because sometimes you will
get an odd Object or Tile that is packed with CrM2. It only takes one and
XTR will not let you play on this track.
@endnode

@node gtauto "XTRU - Auto Conv & Auto Pack"
XTRU - Auto Conv & Auto Pack
============================

The `Auto Conv' gadget is used to set what conversion is to be used on
tracks being install. `AUTO PACK' will pack any files that are not packed
to the same format that `AUTO CONVERT' is set to(This can be slow).

   Please see the @{"Tool Types" link tools} information.

XTRU - Tool Types
=================

There are three tool types that can be set for XTRU,

   AUTOPACK=ON|OFF
   AUTOCONV=NONE|XPKZ|CrM2
   BUFFER=`SIZE'

As default BUFFER=400. This should not be changed unless XTRU informs you
that `Internal buffer exceeded' in a requester. This buffer is used for
the listview infomation and some of the `Edit Times' functions.

If you are unsure please contact us about this.

Installation is very easy just click on the `Install' gadget, select the full

    Tiles/
    etc..

XTRU will install all tracks,objects and tiles etc. It will also convert
them to whatever the `Auto Conv' gadget is set to (None,XPKZ,CrM2).Any
tracks that a unplayable will moved into the `Storage' draw. Also when new
tracks are installed all tracks in `Storage' draw are rechecked to see if
they can be made available for playing, if so they are installed ready for
playing.

XTRU - Set Laps
===============

Press on this gadget and enter a number between 1 and 127 and press return!

You can now race for 127 laps! Please note don't try an alter this on the XTR
Setup Menu, It will let you decrease the laps but not increase them. Also

@node gtxtr "XTRU - Start XTR Gadget"
XTRU - Start XTR
================

At this moment in time all this does is start XTReme Racing, but this may
be used also for keeping the integrity of the `.laptimes' file for use in
Ross Kirks `Hall of Fame'. In other words to stop people cheating!!
@endnode

@node gtclean "XTRU - Clean Up Gadget"
XTRU - Clean Up
===============

All this does is go through all your installed tracks and makes sure that
they are packed/converted to the type selected by the `AUTO CONV/PACK'
gadgets. Really this will only need doing when you first ever use XTRU or if
for some reason you have installed tracks without using XTRU. This function
can take a while when a large number of tracks are installed, but it is worth
using.
@endnode

@node gtprint "XTRU - Print & Save Gadgets"

@node gtextn "XTRU - Add XTRU Extension"
XTRU - Add XTRU Extension
=========================

This gadget alows you to add a special extension to any tracks that you have
designed. It alows you to store:
                                `Track Name'
                                `Track Version'
                                `Release Date'
                                `Author'
                                `Contact'

So if i made a track called `mega_speed_1.trk' , I could add an extension
like this:
          `Mega Speed #1 (MY FIRST TRACK!)'
          `1.0'
          `21-03-1999'
          `Iain Hammond'
          `e-mail: iain@hashpipe.freeserve.co.uk'

Then everyone will always no whos track it is!

To add an extension just click on the `Add EXTN' gadget and you will be
asked to select a track, It does not matter if is packed or not.

Next you will be asked for all of the above info, Any fields left empty will
have `N/A' inserted. Each field has a maxuimum of 36 chars.

Then XTRU will add the extension, Please note that if the track is packed
it will take a little time because it will need to be unpacked first, Then
it will have the extension added on then repacked.

If a track has an extension already and you want to change it, Just add one
like normal, XTRU will strip off the old one first.

The only way you or any one else can see the extension is to click on XTRU's
`LOAD' gadget and the extension infomation will be displayed along with all
the normal info.

=============================

There are two types to chose from:-

   @{"  Remote   " link remote}
   @{"Stand alone" link alone}
@endnode

@node remote "XTRU - Remote Install"
XTRU - Remote Install
=====================

XTRU can be started as a `Default Tool' from a Project Icon. So people who
make their own tracks can use XTRU as an installer for there tracks. When
XTRU is started in remote mode the only gadgets available are, AUTO CONV,
AUTO PACK, INSTALL, ABOUT & QUIT. See the Install section about these
gadgets. This type of install is the same as the normal install except XTRU
will no where to find the track files.

Once installed press QUIT and you will be given a choice to either exit or
enter XTRU. An icon is supplied for inclusion with third party track
archives, this can be found in the ICONS draw.

How to include it in your archive.
==================================
To use just copy the icon into your directory that contains the tracks,
,objects etc. draws. There is a supplied icon in the icons draw with the
XTRU archive.
@endnode

@node alone "XTRU - Stand Alone Installer"
XTRU - Stand Alone Installer
============================

This is a completely separate program to the main XTRU program, and it does
not need the main XTRU program to run. All this does is install your tracks
automatically for other people straight into there XTR directory, it also
converts them into the `XPKZ' format to guarantee that they will work with
all versions of XTR. There are no options to convert to `CrM2' or to pack
the tracks it just installs them.

To include this with your track archives you must copy these files from the
draw `Stand_Alone_Installer" in the main XTRU draw.

The files are:-
               1) XTRU_TRACK_INSTALLER
               2) XTRU_TRACK_INSTALLER.info
               3) XTRU_Order.ReadMe
               4) XTRU_Order.ReadMe.info

These files need to be placed in your archive draw that contains the track,
object etc. draws.

Its as simple as that!
