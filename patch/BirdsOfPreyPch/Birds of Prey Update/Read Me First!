Introduction
------------
Birds of Prey by Argonaut software is an excellent flight simulation game.

There are at least two versions of the Birds of Prey program. The earlier
version is dated 26-Nov-91, and the bop_c file length is 494092 bytes. The
later version 1.1 is dated 25-Mar-92, and the bop_c file length is 495240
bytes. (I have original copies of both versions.)

I do not know exactly what differences there are between the two versions.
Presumably some bugs were fixed, at least.

The purpose of this patch is to enable owners of the earlier version of
Birds of Prey to update (a backup copy of) their Birds of Prey disk 2 to
version 1.1.



Requirements
------------
To apply the patch, you need:
  The earlier version of Birds of Prey.
  About 1MB of free space in T: (normally T: is assigned to RAM:T, so you
   will need about 1MB of free RAM).

To check whether you already have version 1.1, load Birds of Prey and choose
ABOUT BIRDS OF PREY from the PILOT MENU OPTIONS menu. If it says VERSION 1.1
somewhere on the screen, you do not need to apply this patch.



Applying the Patch
------------------
I created the patch file using Ralf Gruner's excellent GPatch program. The
full GPatch/GCompare package is available on Aminet as util/misc/gpatch.lha

The GPatch executable is included in this archive, so you do not need to
download it separately. I have created a shell script to allow the patch to
be applied easily. Step-by-step instructions are:

1. Use DiskCopy, SuperDuper or any other disk copier to make a backup of
   your original Birds of Prey disk 2. Make sure that the volume name of the
   backup is Birds of Prey (remove the "Copy_of_" that DiskCopy adds to the
   name if you copy from Workbench).
   
2. Double-click the "Update Birds of Prey" icon from Workbench, and follow
   the instructions.

3. If all goes well, you can now enjoy playing version 1.1 of Birds of Prey!



Notes
-----
The patch will only work on an unmodified earlier version of Birds of Prey.
If your unmodified original is different, please contact me.
