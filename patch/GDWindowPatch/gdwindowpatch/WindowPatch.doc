 Gloom Deluxe Window Patch by Software Failure/Airsoft 97
 ========================================================

 With this patch, you`re allowed to play Gloom Deluxe in
 window on an standard A1200 or A4000 withoutt using
 CyberGraphX or any gfx board. 

 In little window it runs very good on Blizzard 1230IV.
 But don`t try it with higher resolutions, because it`s
 very lame then.

 I wrote this patch months ago, but decided me, to
 upload it to Aminet.


 REQUIREMENTS:

 - Gloom Deluxe (installed on hd)

 This prog is e-mail or cardware. If you use it, you must send me an e-mail or
 postcard. I collect postcards so it would be very nice from you, sending me
 one. If I get postcards, I know that my Cheat/Trainer work is used. So I try
 to write other cheating progs. See my adress by clicking on the "about" button
 on the GUI.
