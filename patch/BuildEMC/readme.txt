                   Dune 2 EMC Patch 1.2 (Amiga ver.)

---------------------------------------------------------------

Dune2 (TM) is a trademark of Westood Studios.

This is patch for Dune 2 (TM) that contains one bug-fix
and two improvements.
It can work with any version of Dune 2 (Amiga version).
It is _not_ created by the creators of the game, so don't mix
it up with patches released by Westwood Studios - the creator of the game.

-----------------------
>>  What is patched?
-----------------------

- Trivial structure damage no more (does not affect caused by low-power);
- Rocket-turret range decreased so launcher destroys it from any angle;
- Repair facility always brings units back to battlefield.

My personal favourite is first change. It will eliminate the need of
repairing all structures every period of time. Also enemy buildings
are harder to destroy.

Second change allows to destroy rocket turrets without feedback.

Third change eliminates the need of surrounding the repair facility
by wall or other buildings.

-----------------------
>>  History
-----------------------

1.2  - Fixed a bug in repair-facility script that caused units to get stuck sometimes.
1.1  - Rocket-turret range is now 7.75 which is much better
1.0  - Initial release

-----------------------
>> How to install?
-----------------------

It's easy. Just backup file BUILD.EMC in your Dune 2 folder/disk
and place there new BUILD.EMC provided in this archive.
