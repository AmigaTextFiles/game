Hi Ya!

I  just  discoverd how hard it was to play FaYoh with a joypad, so I made
this  tiny update. Just put the "FaYoh_PAD"-file in your FaYoh-drawer 'n'
use  it  if you've got a joypad instead of a -stick. All it actually does
is  to  put  jump on the fire-button and run as default. Do NOT overwrite
your old "FaYoh"-file with it!
   The  second  file  - "level12.bsh" - is a new version of the castle in
world three (the iceworld). People complained about the end of it; it was
almost impossible to reach the exit... he-he ;-) Sorry for that!

Don't forget to keep your eyes open for "FaYoh 2 - a new adventure"!
