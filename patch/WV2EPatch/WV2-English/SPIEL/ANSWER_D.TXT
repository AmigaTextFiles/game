#001
CAN I HELP YOU OUT?
#002
I CAN ONLY RECOMMEND KLON SAWA'S SHOP IN THE SOUTH OF THE CITY. 
#003
IT'S A GOOD PLACE FOR GAMBLING, BUT IT SURE IS DRY AND BARREN HERE ISN'T IT?
#004
PARDON?
#005
HMM, HELLO. YOU CAN'T ALWAYS JUDGE SOMEONE BY THEIR APPEARANCE ROUND HERE.
#006
MANY A FRIENDLY FACE HID AN ENEMY, AND VICE VERSA.
#007
I DON'T GIVE CASH TO EVERY GANG AROUND HERE!
#008
LISTEN, YOU'VE BEEN CLEANED OUT, HAPPENS ALL THE TIME ROUND HERE.
#009
NO, I DON'T BUT I'VE HEARD THEY NEED TEXTILES AND COAL ON SNEMIESE, TRY THAT FOR BUSINESS.
#010
WIM, YEAH HE'S A TRAVELLING TRADER.  DOES SOME GUN RUNNING HERE AND THERE I THINK.
#011
ADVENTURERS? YOU PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS RUNNING AROUND RAISING HELL BECAUSE OF SOME CONTRACT.
#012
YEAH WELL, TIMES HAVE CHANGED.  HAVEN'T YOU GOT ANYTHING A BIT MORE SENSIBLE TO DO?
#013
LET ME GIVE YOU SOME ADVICE:  WATCH OUT FOR PIRATES BECAUSE THEY'RE WATCHING OUT FOR YOU!  HA HA.
#014
WIM? DON'T KNOW THE GUY, BUT ASK SENTA HAN (HE'S FAMILY).  HE'LL KNOW.
#015
BECAUSE OF THE ASTEROID BELT ROUND SECURON.
#016
THAT'S COST MANY INEXPERIENCED PILOTS THEIR LIVES, HASN'T IT?
#017
THIS'LL GIVE TOP PROTECTION, WON'T IT?
#018
WIM? PERHAPS HE'S STUCK ON AN ASTEROID, HA, HA.
#024
YES, PENTHE HAS BECOME QUITE DANGEROUS.
#025
YEAH, IT DIDN'T USED TO BE SO BAD.
#026
TRUE, BUT IT WAS A HELL OF A LOT WORSE TWENTY YEARS
AGO UNDER GENERAL NOTH.
#027
WALTER, SURE I KNOW HIM. I HEARD HE FLEW TO CRASH IN HIS GLIDER RECENTLY.
#028
AHH... HICK... FOUR DRUNKS AGAIN... HICK...
#029
LEAVE ME... HICK... IN PEACE...
#030
COME OVER HERE... BURP... IF YOU'RE NOT SCARED...
#032
IF YOU WANT A DRINK, FORGET IT, I'VE GOT NONE LEFT.
#033
YEAH, UNFORTUNATELY DELIVERIES HAVE BEEN A BIT ERRATIC RECENTLY.
#034
HE HIRED A ROOM FROM ME, BUT THAT WAS SOME WEEKS BACK NOW.
#035
NO, EVEN MY RESERVES HAVE RUN OUT.  YOU'LL HAVE TO GO TO BIOS.
#036
HEY, THANKS GUYS, NOW WE'RE IN BUSINESS.  WAIT A SEC, I'LL SHOW YOU THE ROOM WALTER RENTED, IT'S OVER THERE.
#038
WALTER WIM, ...NEVER HEARD OF HIM.
#039
GET LOST!
#040
WIM? NO, DON'T KNOW HIM.
#042
HELLO, CAN I HELP YOU? BUT KEEP IT SHORT, I'M GOING CRAZY HERE.
#043
IT'S VERY COMPLICATED, I'M AFRAID.
#044
SORRY, TOO MUCH PAPERWORK,... IT TAKES TIME,... NOT POSSIBLE RIGHT NOW... A COUPLE OF WEEKS MAYBE.
#045
FIRST YOU HAVE TO FILL IN AN APPLICATION FOR A TRADING LICENCE, AND ONCE WE'VE PROCESSED THAT, IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS, YOU CAN GET YOUR LICENCE.
#046
GENERALLY SPEAKING NO,... BUT,... FOR 10000$ I'LL SORT IT OUT.
#047
EXCELLENT, NOW WE'RE PARTNERS, YOU WON'T NEED A LICENCE.  I'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING.
#048
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?! CLEAR OFF!
#049
OK, OK, BIG DEAL.  YOU WIN, I'LL GIVE YOU YOUR GOODS BACK.  AND I'LL REGISTER YOUR LICENCE.
#050
THAT'S A TRANSPORT UNIT.
#051
NO, THE ENTRANCE IS ONLY FOR AUTHORISED PERSONNEL.
#052
STRANGE? CYBERTECH 1 IS A WONDERFUL CITY, EVERYTHING IS STATE-OF-THE-ART TECHNOLOGY.
#054
I'M A TECHNICIAN BY TRADE. WHAT ELSE?
#055
ALMOST, CYBERTECH 1 IS A PARADISE FOR TECHNICIANS.
#056
SORRY, BUT I'M VERY BUSY AT THE MOMENT.
#059
VULGO IS ALWAYS PRETTY HOT.  WATCH THE SUN, IF YOU'RE NOT USED TO IT.
#060
MOST PEOPLE ONLY GO OUT AT NIGHT.
#061
AH. THE LAST TIME I SAY WALTER, HE WAS TAKING AN ARMS SHIPMENT TO CASTRA.  IT WASN'T COMPLETELY LEGAL, ACCORDING TO SOMEBODY I KNOW.
#063
ONLY THE OLD MAN... AND MY WIFE - SHE'S IN A SANATORIUM AT THE MOMENT, SHE'S VERY SICK.
#064
YEAH, I KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT IT. I OWN ONE, IF THAT'S ANY HELP.  
#067
NO, I DON'T KNOW ANYONE CALLED WIM.
#068
VULGO IS PEACEFUL PLACE, THE CRIME RATE IS VERY LOW.
#069
WALTER WIM - HMM - DON'T KNOW HIM. SEEMS LIKE HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY DEBTS.
#070
YES, BUT WHY DID YOU ACCEPT IT SO QUICKLY?
#071
- MY HAT? - FOR ONE REASON BECAUSE 98 PERCENT OF THE YEAR IS SUNNY.
#072
NO - I'M JUST ON HOLIDAY. I DON'T KNOW ANYONE HERE.
#075
SAMRASA ALWAYS WAS A GREAT PLANET.
#076
IT'S VERY STRANGE, BUT SOME OF THE PEOPLE I KNOW SEEM TO HAVE CHANGED RECENTLY, IT'S LIKE THEY'RE IN A TRANCE SOMETIMES.
#079
SORRY, BUT I'M IN A HURRY.
#080
I'M A BUSINESSMAN AND I CAN'T MISS MY NEXT APPOINTMENT.
#081
I COULD USE IT, SOME OF MY PARTNERS HAVE ADOPTED A VERY STRANGE ATTITUDE TO BUSINESS RECENTLY.
#082
HI GUYS! I FEEL SO GOOD TODAY, I COULD THROW MY ARMS AROUND THE WHOLE UNIVERSE.
#083
ONLY THAT I'M HAVING A GOOD DAY!
#084
SAMRASA IS NOT PERHAPS A PLACE FOR YOUNG MEN, BUT I'M HAPPY HERE.
#085
RECENTLY SOME PEOPLE HAVE SEEMED REALLY DIFFERENT, I THINK IT'S THE STRESS. 
#086
I'M A STREET CLEANER, WHY ARE YOU INTERESTED?
#087
ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE ME BY THE ARM, OR WHAT?
#088
WELL, NOT EVERYONE IS SUITABLE FOR SUCH A JOB.
#089
NO, I HAVEN'T NOTICED ANYTHING RECENTLY.
#092
STAY AWAY FROM THERE, THAT THING WILL ONLY BRING BAD LUCK ON US ALL...
#093
WELL, THEY'VE BEEN MAKING EVERYONE UNEMPLOYED, INCLUDING ME.
#094
I'M NOT CERTAIN, BUT I THINK THERE'S MORE BEHIND.
#095
YES, MY BOSS'S OFFICE IS IN THE TOP FLOOR OF THE CHIRY OFFICE COMPLEX.
#098
AHHH... I'M OFF ON ANOTHER GREAT JOURNEY...
#099
HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THE NEW GEAR, ...AHHHH... THAT'S ON BIOS..
#100
AHHH... ITS REALLY SOMETHING, YOU SHOULD GIVE IT A TRY... AHHH...
#101
I HAVEN'T FELT ANYTHING YET... AHHH...
#102
IF YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING TO ASK ME, GO AHEAD, ASK.  DON'T PLAY GAMES.
#103
INFORMATION? I WAS JOKING, I DON'T SPEAK TO JUST ANYBODY. (OR ARE YOU JOKING NOW?)
#105
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT ANY MORE. SINCE RECENTLY, YOU NEED A LICENCE FOR INTERSTELLAR TRADING AND YOU CAN ONLY GET THEM ON CYBERTECH 1. GO AND SEE THE RELEVANT AUTHORITIES.
#106
NO WAY, PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS COMING TO ME WANTING A CUSTOMS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT SLIP.
#107
SINCE THEY CHANGED THE LAW, I'VE NOT HAD MUCH TO DO, I'M HARDLY EVER IN THE OFFICE.
#108
THAT COMES FROM THE AIR HERE, DOES IT BOTHER YOU?
#109
YOU'RE QUITE DIRECT, IF I MAY SAY SO.
#111
NEFFT? THE POOR BLOKE! HE'S DROWNING IN PAPERWORK!
#112
WHO? THE NAME MEANS NOTHING TO ME.
#113
OH, NEFFT. SORRY, I DON'T KNOW.
#114
MAN, I'M ONLY WEARING THIS HABIT, BECAUSE I'M ON HOLIDAY. IT'S TOTALLY HIP.
#115
ORIGINALLY I WANTED TO VISIT THE RAPHASTRA-SYSTEM, BUT NOW I'VE CHANGED MY MIND.
#116
SURE, YOU SHOULD SPEND A FEW QUIET DAYS HERE. RELAX, INDULGE YOURSELF.
#117
ONLY WITH THE FIRST ONE, BUT ARE YOU READY?
#118
YOU WON'T CONTROL IT, IT WILL CONTROL YOU.  IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE IT, WATCH OUT!
#119
THE UNIVERSAL POWER THINKS YOU WILL FIND THE SECOND ON VULGO, THE THIRD, HOWEVER, LIES OUT IN THE STARS.
#120
I'M TOTALLY DESPERATE, MY WIFE LIES DYING.
#121
I'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU. THE SPIRITBLITZES  ARE RELICS FROM THE PAST, WHEN THE UNIVERSE WAS STILL PERVADED BY ONE UNIFIED POWER.
#122
THERE ARE MANY MYTHS AND LEGENDS, BUT THE SPIRITBLITZES REALLY DO EXIST! I MYSELF POSSESS THE FORCE OF ONE OF THE THREE.
#123
THERE WAS A MAN WITH THAT NAME HERE A FEW WEEKS AGO. HE ALSO WANTED TO BE INITIATED INTO THE SECRETS OF THE SPIRITBLITZ.
#128
GOOD DAY! THE UNIVERSAL POWER BE WITH YOU!
#129
YES, I'VE TOTALLY GIVEN IN TO THE POWER AS WELL.
#130
ONLY THOSE, THAT RENOUNCE WORLDLY THINGS, CAN FIND ETERNAL PEACE.
#131
WELL MY CHILDREN, DO YOU NOT WISH TO JOIN MY ORDER?
#132
THAT'S A REAL SHAME, BECAUSE OUR COMMUNITY COULD USE SOME HARD-WORKING HELPERS.
#133
ITS A PITY, BUT THERE AREN'T MANY YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WANT TO ENTER THE MONASTERY ANYMORE.
#134
MAYBE YOU'LL THINK IT OVER A BIT! THE POWER BE WITH YOU ALL.
#135
THAT DEPENDS, I WORK FOR THE CYBERTECH CORPORATION AND ACCEPT ONLY APPLICATIONS FOR APARTMENTS.
#136
YES, EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO RENT A FLAT, FIRST HAS TO SUBMIT AN APPLICATION HERE TO ME.
#137
SORRY, BUT WE'RE FULLY OCCUPIED NOW.
#138
I REALLY CAN'T DEAL WITH ANY MORE APPLICATIONS. COME BACK IN 3 MONTHS TIME.
#142
 IRADA IS A STRANGE PLANET, THE INHABITANTS ARE ALWAYS TELLING EVERYONE, BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THERE'S A LOT GOING ON. 
#143
THAT'S A VERY DIRECT QUESTION! THERE ARE CERTAIN...AHMM...SUBSTANCES, THAT WILL CATAPULT A MAN ONTO, SHALL WE SAY, A SPIRITUAL PLANE.
#144
I SHOULDN'T REALLY SAY, BUT...PSSST...THE LOCAL SPACE-TRADERS MIGHT OFFER SOMETHING INTERESTING.
#145
I WAS CONSCRIPTED INTO THE HANSE ARMY A FEW WEEKS BACK.
#146
I'M JUST NOT AT ALL HAPPY ABOUT IT. THE WORST OF IT IS, I'VE STILL GOT 9 MONTHS TO SERVE.
#147
ACTUALLY I'M AN AD-DESIGNER AND I WORK FOR A BIG AGENCY...
#148
I COULD SHOW YOU MY WORK FOR HOURS, BUT I'M AFRAID I'VE GOT TO GO.
#149
THE UNIVERSE IS FULL OF DARK SECRETS, TAKE CARE YOU DON'T PUT YOUR TRUST IN FALSENESS!
#150
EVIL IS ALWAYS AMONG US...
#151
NEVER FORSAKE THE SHINING PATH, AS THE DARKNESS WILL BEGUILE YOU 
#154
HA, HA, I'VE ALREADY BEEN TOLD THAT MORE THAN ONCE. I CAN GET MORE FOR YOU THAN YOUR OLD FRIEND.
#155
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT IT WILL TAKE A WHILE FOR ME TO GET THE GOODS HERE.
#156
GOOD TO KNOW.
#161
NOT AT ALL, BUT RECENTLY I WAS ELECTED MISS BIOS AND SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN SWAMPED BY OFFERS.
#162
BEING A MODEL'S HARD NOW. I CERTAINLY DON'T GET PAID TO DO NOTHING.
#164
WHAT ARE YOU GAPING AT?!
#165
ALL ALIENS LOOK AT US BETTAHS AS IF WE'RE LEPERS.
#166
THE BETTAHS HAVE SPECIALISED FOR YEARS IN SPACE TRAVEL, THAT'S WHY WE ARE SUPERIOR TO ALL OTHER RACES IN THIS SECTOR.
#168
AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW, US BETTAHS ARE THE BEST PILOTS IN THIS GALAXY.
#170
CERTAINLY I WORK FOR THE BIOS STATE SECURITY. I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR AIR SURVEILLANCE. 
#171
DON'T KNOW, I'VE GOT TO GO.
#173
AAHRGHAAAA...
#175
I CALLED YOU. MY NAME IS WINNIE WIM. THE MAN WHO HAS GOT HOLD OF YOUR GOODS IS UPSTAIRS.
#176
HERE, TAKE THIS KEYCARD, IT'LL OPEN DOORS FOR YOU. I'LL LEAVE IT HERE.
#177
YOU MUST HELP ME FIND MY FATHER, WALTER WIM. HE DISAPPEARED WITHOUT TRACE ON THE WAY TO VULGO. YEARS AGO, YOU HELPED HIM ONCE BEFORE.
#178
NO, BUT TELL ME AS SOON AS YOU HAVE ANYTHING NEW, PLEASE.
#190
LEAVE ME ALONE!
#201
SEE YOU.
#212
I'LL PAY YOU @XXXXX0 CREDITS FOR IT.
#213
THAT COSTS @XXXXX0 CREDITS.
#214
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
#215
AAAHRGH...
#216
HEY! WHAT'S THAT MEAN?!
#218
GRRRRRRRR!
#219
GET OUT!
#220
MOVE IT!
#221
GET LOST!
#222
FORGET IT!
#223
CREDIT GETS YOU NOTHING FROM ME!
#224
HERE, PLEASE.
#225
TAKE ONE FROM THE COUNTER FIRST.
#226
THANKS.
#227
HEY! TAKE THAT!
#228
I CAN'T ACTUALLY DO MUCH WITH THAT.
#229
CRASH IS HERE ON CASTRA, IT LIES ON CO-ORDINATES 7/40 OR THEREABOUTS.
#231
NO THANKS, KEEP IT.
#232
FLY TO ANTOLOS, IT'LL BE NO PROBLEM, YOUR GOODS WILL BE WAITING THERE FOR YOU.
#233
YOU DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE ME FOR A RIDE!
#234
SINCE THESE CYBERTECH PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INTERFERING EVERYWHERE, IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT TO GET ANY WORK DONE.
#235
NO REALLY? BUT FIRST I MUST FINISH THE POST.
#236
HE'S IN A LONG MEETING IS HE? RIPPING SOMEBODY ELSE OFF I SUPPOSE?
#237
TO LEVEL 2, ON THE OTHER PLANE, BUT HE COULDN'T COME BACK, I THINK.
#238
NO.
#239
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE? ARE YOU CRAZY?
#240
HONESTLY, YOUR GOODS ARE NOW BACK ON BOARD.
#241
HOW CAN THAT BE?
#242
OH YEAH, GOOD DAY.
#243
AND YOU SEEM LIKE VERY INQUISITIVE PEOPLE.
#244
YEAH, I'VE HEARD THE 'MORE HONEST' BUSINESSMEN DO THE ODD DODGY DEAL AT THEIR TRADING POSTS.
#245
ILLEGAL GOODS ARE SOMETIMES SOLD FOR 3 TO 4 TIMES MORE THAN WHAT THEY WERE BOUGHT FOR.
#246
YOU'RE PRETTY EAGER! BUT CHECK THE PRICE FIRST, BEFORE YOU LOSE ALL YOUR MONEY. SEE YOU.
#247
FORGET YOUR WORLDLY CONCERNS! THIS FORCE USES US ALL LIKE WE WERE ITS TOYS.
#248
EVERYWHERE AND EVERYONE.. EVEN YOU WILL SOON BE IN ITS CONTROL...
#249
OH NO, IT TOOK CONTROL OF WALTER... I WARNED HIM HE WAS OUT OF HIS DEPTH...
#250
NOT UP TO NOW.
#251
DON'T TRY TO TRICK ME! YOU STILL CAN'T HAVE IT.
#252
SURE. HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT WHAT I'M OFFERING.
#253
A GOOD ATTITUDE, THAT MORE OF YOUR TYPE SHOULD SHARE.
#254
THANKS A LOT, THE MORE I GET THE BETTER.  BY THE WAY, YOU PEOPLE ARE THE BEST VALUE TRANSPORTERS I KNOW, HA, HA
#255
HEY! THIS IS MY FATHER'S WRITING! THIS SKETCH AS WELL...HMM... IT'S DEFINITELY A CLUE. I'M SURE IT MEANS HE WAS GOING TO CHIRY.
#256
I'VE JUST BURIED THE THING, IT BRINGS ONLY BAD LUCK.
#257
HERE ON BIOS OUTSIDE THE CITY, APPROXIMATELY BETWEEN 20/50 AND 25/55. BUT I THINK IT SHOULD STAY THERE.
#258
IT'S VERY INTERESTING, BUT UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T UNDERSTAND THINGS LIKE THIS.
#259
YEAH?
#260
YEAH? ALSO, I KNOW THIS NICE COSY CORNER...
#261
HEY! AREN'T YOU THOSE CULT GUYS FROM THE WHALE?
#262
SORRY, I MUST HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN... ARE YOU SURE?
#263
GREAT, I'VE GOT AN OUTSTANDING BILL FOR YOU...
#264
PUT DOWN EVERYTHING YOU'RE CARRYING AND COME INSIDE.
#265
AND NOW GET LOST.
#266
NOT MUCH, THESE THINGS ARE ONLY WHISPERED ABOUT, BUT I'VE HEARD THE BETTAHS ARE ALREADY PRETTY NERVOUS ABOUT IT.
#267
I WAS EXPECTING YOU.
#268
YOU HAVE FOUND THE CONNECTION, WHAT YOU NEED NOW IS A TEACHER, WHO CAN INITIATE YOU IN THE ART OF THE THREE SPIRIT FLASHES.
#269
FLY TO SNEMISE AND FIND OLD RAFDEBAN.  HE WAS ONCE A GREAT MAGE, HE KNOWS OF YOU AND WILL HELP YOU MUCH, MORE I CAN'T SAY.
#270
SHE HAS A VERY RARE ILLNESS. SHE NEEDS A BODY-ENERGY DONOR. BUT WE'VE GOT NO MONEY AND NOBODY'S GOING TO DO IT FOR FREE.
#271
WHAT?! THAT IS A VERY DANGEROUS MAGIC SAYING THAT YOU ARE EXPOSING YOURSELVES TO.
#272
I HOPE I HAVEN'T SURPRISED YOU, BUT I WANTED TO GET IT DONE BEFORE YOU CONSIDERED ANYTHING ELSE. MANY THANKS. IF I CAN EVER BE OF HELP, CALL ME.
#273
YEAH WELL, THANKS ANYWAY FOR THE OFFER.
#274
I ONCE BOUGHT ONE FROM ABDUL ASSAN IN PENTHE.
#275
I THINK I MAY BE ABLE TO HELP YOU. I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA HOW I LEARNT THIS SAYING.
#276
THANKS TO YOU I'M ALRIGHT AGAIN. I WILL NOT FORGET YOU FOR THIS.
#277
ARE YOU MEMBERS OF THE SECT TOO? WELL, I CAN'T TEACH SPIRIT FLASH ROUND.
#278
I STILL CONTROL THE S.G. SPIRIT BOLT, ALSO A VERY POWERFUL MAGIC SAYING. YOU'LL HAVE TO PAY A SMALL FEE THOUGH.
#279
THAT'S VERY DEMANDING, YOU KNOW? EXACTLY 2000000 CREDITS,I'LL HAVE NOTHING LEFT AFTERWARDS.
#280
YOU SHOULD COME TO ME, NOT ME COME TO YOU!
#281
YEAH, I THINK YOU BETTER GET SOME MORE MONEY FIRST. 
#282
I THINK THAT WAS A FAIR DEAL ALL ROUND. INCIDENTALLY: DON'T ASK, HOW YOU CAN MAKE USE OF THIS SAYING, I DON'T KNOW MYSELF.
#283
YEAH, I HEARD ONE OF THEM HAD BEEN CAPTURED BY BOUNTY HUNTERS, WHO WERE AFTER SOME GUYS FOR DISAPPEARING WITH SOME GOODS OF THEIRS, OR SOMETHING. 
#284
LOOKING FOR TROUBLE? JUST TRY IT.
#285
TURN OFF THE SONIC ABSORBER, SO WE CAN COMMUNICATE BETTER.
#286
SFXLRDF FFHES NE?
#287
ASDFTH EHET!
#288
GRXF THHF ENEZ ZETYF!?
#289
HGEXXYTZ.
#290
SPFLXXY YXGZT.
#291
STAY THAT SIDE OF THE COUNTER, PLEASE!
#292
YOU HAVEN'T ACTUALLY LOST ANYTHING AT THE BACK.
#293
GO BACK TO THE FRONT, YOU'LL GET THE GOODS ONLY WHEN YOU'VE PAID FOR THEM.
#294
THERE'S NOTHING TO SEE HERE.
