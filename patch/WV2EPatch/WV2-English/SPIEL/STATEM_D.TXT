#000
BY THE WAY, DO YOU KNOW IT ALREADY?
#001
CAREFUL! I THINK IT COULD BE A TRAP!
#002
I CAN'T DISCOVER ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR HERE.
#003
*** GAME OVER! *** YOUR TEAM HAS BEEN DESTROYED. YOU HAVE LOST.
#004
THIS MEMBER IS SOMETIMES NOT FIT FOR ACTION.
#005
FROM NOW ON I'LL RELOAD AUTOMATICALLY.
#006
I DON'T WANT AUTOMATIC RELOAD ANYMORE.
#007
I CAN'T SEE ANY TRAPS AHEAD.
#008
WHO SHOULD I TRY TO DETOXIFY?
#009
WHO SHOULD I TRY TO RESUSCITATE?
#010
WHICH WOUND SHOULD I TRY TO HEAL?
#011
WHO SHOULD I USE THE ESSENCE ON?
#012
I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MENTAL ENERGY FOR IT!
#013
I HAVE SUCCESSFULLY DETOXIFIED HIM! (AND I'M DAMN PROUD TOO!)
#014
BUT HE IS NOT AT ALL POISONED!
#015
THE LOCK'S CRACKED.
#016
I DON'T THINK IT'S LOCKED.
#017
DIDN'T WORK, I'M NOT TOO HAPPY ABOUT IT.
#018
BUT HE IS NOT AT ALL DEAD!
#019
IT'S DONE, HE'S BACK WITH US.
#020
HE REQUIRES NO HEALING!
#021
I HAVE HEALED HIS WOUNDS.
#022
I ESTIMATE THE THING IS WORTH @XXXXXXXXX CREDITS.
#023
I CAN'T FIND ANY NOTICEABLE TRACKS.
#024
THIS ESSENCE INCREASES STRENGTH.
#025
THIS ESSENCE INCREASES HEALTH.
#026
THIS ESSENCE INCREASES MENTAL ENERGY.
#027
THIS ESSENCE DETOXIFIES.
#028
I THINK THIS ESSENCE IS SPOILT!
#029
THAT'S NO ESSENCE!
#030
WHO SHOULD I USE THE ESSENCE ON?
#031
I'VE CONSUMED THE ESSENCE.
#032
I THINK THE BEAMER IS DESTROYED. WE CAN'T GO BACK!
#033
SHOULD WE REALLY GO? CLICK AGAIN TO BEAM UP.
#034
THIS DOOR IS LOCKED.
#035
THERE'S NO MORE SPACE FOR PUTTING STUFF DOWN HERE!
#036
I HAVE IT IN USE RIGHT NOW!
#037
I AM FULLY LOADED. I CANNOT TAKE ANY MORE.
#038
I CAN SEE NO ONE, WHO I COULD IDENTIFY.
#039
I CAN SEE NO ONE, WHO I COULD HYPNOTISE.
#040
I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MENTAL ENERGY!
#041
I THINK I'M TOO WEAK FOR THIS OPPONENT.
#042
THERE IS NO ONE HERE I CAN PARALYSE.
#043
I CAN REACH NO ONE, WHO I COULD MENTALLY STEAL FROM.
#044
THERE IS NO ONE NEAR BY.
#045
I ESTIMATE THEIR HONESTY AT @XXX .
#046
TASTES STRANGE...
#047
ON THE PIECE OF PAPER IT SAID: "BELOVED SISTER, I HOPE YOU GET THIS MESSAGE. BE CAREFUL, THE POWER IS GROWING STRONGER. SOON IT WILL CONTROL THE WHOLE UNIVERSE."  NEXT TO IT IS A SKETCH.
#048
I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO WATER THAT POT AGAIN.
#049
WHY? I DON'T SMOKE.
#050
I CAN'T GET ANYWHERE WITH THIS TOOL.
#051
URGH... THAT'S PURE VINEGAR!
#052
THIS CARD  DOES NOTHING HERE.
#053
FOR ESSENCE USE, SELECT A PERSON WITH THE "USE ESSENCE" ABILITY .
#054
HMM. I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS ALL MY LIFE...
#055
THE GLASS IS EMPTY.
#056
IT'S ONLY WATER, BUT IT'S VERY REFRESHING.
#057
SAFETY CATCH ON, CHANGE MAGAZINE, SAFETY CATCH OFF.
#058
I AM USING NO GUN THAT I COULD LOAD.
#059
BUT THE MAGAZINE IS STILL FULL!
#060
HE'S TOO FAR AWAY!
#061
HEY, NEXT TO IT!
#062
MY WEAPON IS NOW EMPTY!
#063
I'D SAY THAT THING IS WORTHLESS.
#064
WHO SHOULD THE HEALING DEVICE HEAL?
#065
OUR MEMBER HAS BEEN HEALED.
#066
WE'RE NO LONGER CAPABLE OF THAT!
#067
THAT WILL COST US @XXXXXXXXX CREDITS.
#068
I CAN'T FIND ANY ELECTRONICS THAT I CAN MANIPULATE.
#069
THE PART FITS IN, BUT SPRINGS BACK OUT AGAIN.
#070
I'M NOT SURE WHAT TO DO WITH IT.
#071
THE PART FITS IN BUT NOTHING ELSE HAPPENS.
#072
HEY! WHAT'S GOING ON? THEY'VE TAKEN A HOSTAGE!
#073
WELL, I DON'T THINK THE BEAMER HAS SURVIVED THE EXPLOSION.
#074
OUR COMBINED MENTAL PROTECTION AMOUNTS TO @XXX%.
#075
AS DRUNK AS I AM, I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT?
#076
UAAHH... I SUDDENLY FEEL COMPLETELY WEAK...
#077
I DON'T TALK TO GUYS LIKE YOU, I SMACK THEM IN THE HEAD...
#078
WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO NEED MAGAZINES, RIGHT? I'M GETTING ONE.
#079
OOH... I FEEL SO DIZZY, I'M SPINNING...
#080
AHH, IT'S OFF AGAIN, I CAN HARDLY SEE ANYTHING...
#081
BRRRR... IT'S FREEZING HERE...
#082
WHOOPS! HEY! HOPPLA...
#083
WAIT A SEC... WE'LL DO THAT ANOTHER WAY...
#084
I CAN LEARN A NEW ABILITY! WHICH SHOULD I PRACTISE?
#085
I'M NO BETTAH! THEY WON'T UNDERSTAND ME WITHOUT A TRANSLATION UNIT.
#086
I'VE NO STRENGTH FOR THAT JUST NOW.
#087
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, THERE'S A TRAP STRAIGHT AHEAD.
#088
I'VE LAID A TRAP HERE, WE SHOULD MOVE AWAY CAREFULLY.
#089
PHEW, OUR WEIGHER THINKS I'M REALLY OVERLOADED.
#090
WAIT A MO! I THINK THERE'S A TRAP HIDDEN AHEAD.
