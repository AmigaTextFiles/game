@node "require" "-System Requirements-"
@toc "main"
 To Install DNA, you will (probably) need the following:

   * A new version of installer!
   * A little bit of (HD)Disk-Space - 2.0-2.5 MegaByte

@endnode

@node "installation" "-How to install DNA-"
@toc "main"
Just click on the DNA.Install icon and the installer will take you through!

...

When you have started the game it will ask for disks, just press the mouse
and the game will go on loading from your HD.

@toc "main"
What I intend to do in the "The Future":

Make a C-program that patches the binaries instead of using the silly boot script.
