Llamatron Update (Release #4) - by David Kinder
-----------------------------------------------

Introduction
------------

One of my favourite games on the Amiga is Jeff Minter's shareware release
Llamatron, but it doesn't run under Kickstart 2.0 or higher. A bit of
experimentation showed that it was the loader programs (LLAMA and LLAMA512)
that were at fault. Thus I have written my own replacements.

Note that the main game files (TRON512 and TRON1MEG) are required but not
included. These are in the original Llamatron distribution.

Use
---

Make a copy of your Llamatron disk, then replace the files LLAMA and
LLAMA512 with the copies in this archive. These loaders also run from
Workbench, so you can start Llamatron from the included icons (taken from an
Amiga Computing coverdisk).

History
-------

Release #2:

This release corrects a problem on Amigas with the VBR set to an address
other than 0x00000000. Thanks to Thomas Baetzler, who pointed this out
to me.

Release #3:

Removed an Enforcer hit. Updated distribution to separate ECS and AGA
machines.

Release #4:

Fixed the loaders to work correctly on AGA machines without needing
KillAGA, so have removed separate ECS and AGA directories.

Final Note
----------

Support shareware! If you didnt send money to Jeff for Llamatron because it
doesnt run on your new machine, youve no excuse now. If enough people
support shareware we might see more games of this quality released in this
way.
