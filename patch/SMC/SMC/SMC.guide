  Hi. The SMC is a method of altering the amount of money that you have in
  a SWOS career game file. At present, the program has only been tested
  with career files from SWOS 95/95 (non-Euro96) so don't blame me if using
  this program screws up your Career. ALWAYS MAKE A BACKUP FIRST!!!!!!!!!!

@NODE USAGE "Usage"

 Dead easy. When starting the program, a file requester will appear. Using
 this requester, select your career file. When you click OK or double-click
 on your career file, you will see the amount of money you have in that
 save game file in the two number gadgets. Note that you can only alter the
 contents of the New Balance field. 

 To do this, simply click in the text box labelled New Balance and type in
 the new amount. The amount you can enter here has a logical limit. If you
 type in less than 50000 then it will automatically revert to the Old
 Balance. The same goes if you attempt to enter a figure greater than 
 100000000 (100 million). The latter is a limit set in the game itself,
 well in SWOS 95.96 anyway. The former is just common sense. Who would use
 a cheater program to give themselves 50000 pounds?

 When you have done this, and the program has accepted your new amount,
 simply hold down the right mouse button and move your mouse to the menus
 on the top of the screen. Highlight File and then Save Career... and
 release the mouse button. The program will write your new amount to the
 save game file. Now, when you load this game into SWOS, your new bank
 balance should be present in the CLUB BUSINESS section :-)

 And that's it! Easy! 

 The other menu options are self-explanatory.
