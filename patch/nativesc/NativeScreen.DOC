Some games seem not to run when started from a gfx-board Workbench. But
often they run. Only the automatic screen-switcher doesn`t recognize that
there is a AMIGA-display...

NativeDisplay solves this Problem. Use a batch to start the game :

---------------------------------cut here------------------

; Example

RUN NativeScreen   ; Runs NativeScreen which opens a little screen

MegaGame           ; start game

RUN NativeScreen   ; This causes NativeScreen to close the screen

---------------------------------cut here------------------


You can use the games icon if you change the icon into a PROJECT-Icon (e.g
with IconEd), save it as StartGame, apply C:IconX as Default Tool, make a
batch like the one above and save it as StartGame.
Now when you double-klick the StartGame-Icon IconX executes the batch and
starts your game...


Tested with enforcer, on A4000/40/EGSSpectrum and A2000/30/Picasso II
