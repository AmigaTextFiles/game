                          (=============================)

Here is it! The Speris Legacy Levelcheater. With this little prog you can play
any level of Speris Legacy or watch the end.


REQUIREMENTS:

- Speris Legacy (installed on HD)


How can I install Spetis Legacy on HD??
---------------------------------------

Copy all the disks in one directory and assign them or use the installer Ive
put in this package.


           ********************* IMPORTANT *************************
   
           You cannot start this Cheater from workbench because 
           Speris Legacy needs all your memory!! So, do
           something like this:

           1. Reset your computer and hold down both mousebuttons.
           2. Now click on the right button called "boot with no
              startup-sequence"
           3. Now type in "CD [gamepath]" without quotes of course.
              E.Q. "CD dh2:games/Speris"
           4. Now type in "Execute Levelcheater". The trainer will start
              then.

           ********************* IMPORTANT *************************  
            

 If this was succesfully, a nice GUI appears. Here you can select the
 level you wanna play.

 If you select start, Speris Legacy will be started. Now select "New game."
 Now you see the typical intro animation. I don`t know why, but if 
 you press fire now, your selected level appears. 

 If you have problems or bugs please e-mail me and specify your system-
 configuration. 

 This prog is e-mail- or cardware. If you use it, you must send me an e-mail
 with Bugs, comments, suggestions or a postcard (if you haven`t email).
 I`m collecting postcards so it would be very nice, if you send me one from
 your country/town. My adress can you see by clicking on the "About" Button.
 If I get postcards I`ll try to write cheaters for other games.
