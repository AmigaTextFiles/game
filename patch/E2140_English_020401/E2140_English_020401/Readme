Update 02.04.01
===============
Some people reported problems running the game from CDROMs connected to their
BlizzardPPC/CyberStormPPC SCSI controllers, getting "phase mismatch" errors.
This version fixes the CDDA code to support those controllers too.
In addition to that we have fixed some problems regarding the speed setting within
the game. So if the game is too slow now, just move the speed gadget up again -
it's better than the other way around, as before.


Update 12.01.01
===============
Support for graphics cards not supporting big endian modes added. Direct support for
the little endian RGB16PC mode, and (much slower) support for all other modes through
Picasso 96. Just run the installer to patch the executables.

QUICK START GUIDE
=================

  Mouse:
     Left Button -  This button is primarily used to select a
                    soldier/vehicle or group of soldiers/ vehicles by clicking
                    and dragging over them, and attacking the enemy with
                    selected objects. To attack, move the cursor over an enemy
                    object. The cursor will change from green to red crosshairs.
                    Click on the enemy and all of your selected soldiers/vehicles
                    will attack.This button is also used to initiate building of
                    bases, mines, research centers, ect.
     
     Right Button - This button is used to deselect selected soldiers/vehicles,
                    and to call up a status/command menu. To call up the menu,
                    click on a soldier/vehicle.


  Keyboard:
     Ctrl+1,2,3 or 4 - You can create groups of soldiers/vehicles by pressing the 
     Ctrl+5,6,7 or 8 - Control key and any number between 1 and 8. To select one of
                       these units after you have created it, simply press the
                       corresponding number.
                       Example - group
                       Three is a regiment of tanks. You already selected them all
                       and pressed Ctrl+3 to group them, so now to select them,
                       just press the 3 key. You can have up to eight different
                       groups total.

     Ctrl+mouse  - add a unit to the selection.
     Alt+mouse   - remove a unit from the selection.

     Up Arrow    - Scroll up
     Right Arrow - Scroll right
     Down Arrow  - Scroll down
     Left Arrow  - Scroll left

     a - attack mode
     m - move mode
     g - guard mode
     e - escort mode

     r - request reinforcements
     z - select all visible units

     p - pause





TROUBLESHOOTING / COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
======================================
There are some options you could try, if the game doesn't run properly. Add these
to "Earth2140(.wos).exe" line in the startup scripts.

Example:
If you have an OCS/ECS machine, your Earth2140_800x600 file should probably look
like this: (and similar for the other scripts)

stack 65536
earth2140.exe x800 SmallPointers




  SmallPointers
  ----------------
  OCS/ECS systems doesn't seem to support more than 16 pixels wide pointers, even when
  running on a graphics card (with the current graphics systems), meaning that you
  won't see most (if any) of the pointers (which are 32x32 pixels).  If this is
  the case try giving the executable "SmallPointers" as an argument to use another
  set of small, ugly pointers. If the problem continues try the "NOCUSTOMPOINTER"
  argument.


  P96WritePixelArray
  ------------------
  If the pointer flickers, or you have other problems with the screen update, and are
  running P96, you may have succes with the "P96WritePixelArray" argument, which uses
  that method when writing to the screen instead of writing directly. CGX doesn't
  have such a method for 16 bit buffers. Note that this method is much slower than
  our custom routines, especially on a PPC.


  NoCDDA
  ------
  This turns off CD audio support. So if you are running the game from some weird
  device and are having problems, it could be the CDDA system (which uses the
  device "Earth2140:" lies on) trying to play CDDA on that device. In that case,
  or if you want to run from HD only, or just don't have your CD drives audio
  output connected give "NoCDDA" as an option.
