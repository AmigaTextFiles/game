                      Super Stardust CD32 Tunnelcheater V1.0
                      (=====================================)


Here is the *FIRST* Tunnelcheater for the game Super Stardust (CD32
Version). The tunnels of this game are so cool, that I wrote
this cheater. 


REQUIREMENTS:

- Super Stardust (CD-ROM or installed on HD)


How can I install Super Stardust on HD??
----------------------------------------

Please use my program CD32 Games Install Kit available on Aminet
(game/patch/InstallKit2_1.lha). Version 2.2 (will soon be released)
installs over 100 games. 


           ********************* IMPORTANT *************************
   
           You cannot start this cheater from workbench because 
           Super Stardust needs all your memory!! So, do
           something like this:

           1. Reset your computer and hold down both mousebuttons.
           2. Now click on the right button called "boot with no
              startup-sequence"
           3. Now type in "CD [gamepath]" without quotes of course.
              E.Q. "CD dh2:games/ssd"
           4. Now type in "Execute Tunnelcheater". The trainer will start
              then.

           ********************* IMPORTANT *************************  
            

 If this was succesfully, a nice GUI appears. Here you can select the
 tunnel you wanna play. 

 This prog is e-mail- or cardware. If you use it, you must send me an e-mail
 with Bugs, comments, suggestions or a postcard (if you haven`t email).
 I`m collecting postcards so it would be very nice, if you send me one from
 your country/town. My adress can you see by clicking on the "About" Button.
 If I get postcards I`ll try to write cheaters for other games.

 Have fun with this prog!
