Quick doc for this silly little release :)


Background:

I downloaded the OnEscapee demo tonight and got a ton of errors trying to run it.
Reason?  Well basically the person who archived the original file forgot to 
tell LHA to include empty directories necessary for the game to run correctly.

The fix:

Extract the archive straight to the OnEscapee_5meg directory and all the directories
you need will majically appear.  That's it!  Enjoy it - it's a cool game.


Kind Regards,
