Update 06.01.01
===============
This version adds the option SimpleScreenWrite, which seems to fix
the problem of the PPC version crashing. As this option is really
slowing things down, you should avoid it if not neccesary. We hope
to have a stable version running at the usual (actually a bit improved)
speed soon.

A small bug connected to the scrolling in the map and stopping the screen
update was introduced with the LAN version, and removed again now.
