That fix applies to Tangram (c) 1991 Thalion.

You have 3 choices: Install to hd, patch a backup-floppy and (later)
install an already with this script patched floppy to hd.
The Patcher can be obtained from Jeffs Patch&HD-Installers page or 
the WHDLoad-package.

Sorry, there's no quit-option (and probably will never be).
Its not necessary but useful to switch the caches off before starting.
You should boot with OCS (otherwise your mousepointer will flicker due
wrong timing). Maybe KillAGA will also work.

Fixed:  Game hung if the workbench couldnt be closed.
        Wrong screenmanagement on Kick3.x.

To save your scores, choose YES on 'play with scoredisk' and NO on
        'create new scoredisk'. 
If you have already a scoredisk copy the file SCORE.DTA to the Tangram-
        directory.

This fix was successfully tested under Kick1.3, Kick 2.0 and Kick 3.0.
