A small doc for ClickStart V1.0 Rev 3.942 

ClickStart and the other files included in this package can be used by 
anyone who wants to.

There should be two directories with these files:

BootFiles/
	  Startup-Sequence
	  RenamedFile.info
	  RebootStart

and Devs/
	  Min-Mountlist

In the root there should be three files:

ClickStart
Clickstart.doc
ClickStart.info

***************
* What is it? *
***************
ClickStart is an AmigaDOS script that make you choose if you like to run 
the demo or restart your computer. If you have enough memory, the demo will
be loaded right away. If you have to little chip mem, it rebootstarts the demo. 

**************
* History... *
**************
It started with a script that were included on the Amiga Format CD where you 
could select to run the demo or cancel. It also showed how much memory the demo 
required, and if it quitted to DOS. Then I wanted to make a script that 
rebooted your computer if you didn`t have enough memory. Some demos is even 
working better if you don't start them from workbench. So this script was born 
I have done a lot of changes since the first version and is almost free for
bugs. Anyway I'm not RESPONSIBLE for any damage.

Version 1.0 Rev 3.942 - First "commercial" release.

* Mounts a Rad Disk.
* Uses "Pipe-device" / Pipe-mountlist to reqognize filetype.
* Checks if the file is exec or not.
* Checks if the file is a device or library
* If it cannot find the filetype, it asks if it`s a script.
* If it IS a script, it creates a small file with the the original filename
  included, so that you can doubleclick on the icon named "Renamedfile". Then
  you get the original filename back
* Copies ALL needed files to MD0: (A 40k Raddisk)  
* Checks how much Chip memory you have. And asks how much Chip memory that 
  is needed to start the demo. (1200Kb, 1400Kb, 1800Kb, Other)
* Tells wether or not the demo exits to WB (If you configure it to so in the 
  Clickstart script. Eg. types in where this text appears in the script: 
  "Exits to WB = YES, Ofcourse!*) 
* Runs the demo multiple times if wanted (Y/N requester)

**************
* Known Bugs *
**************
- Cannot handle spaces in filenames/dirnames
- Be careful about rebooting the machine while demo runs... Some demos - Eg.
  The Black Lotus demo "TINT" have the ability to cause a validation error..
  The machine will probably fix it, but it sucks like hell to wait for it...
- People with 2MEG CHIP only could still be doomed, because the RAD disk COULD
  take to much space in the memory

********************
* How to install ? *
********************
1.Make sure you have these commands on your your AMIGA

	SYS:C/
		RequestChoice (Included in OS 3.x)
		RequestFile
		ED
		Reset
		Cpu

	SYS:Devs/ or SYS:Storage/Dosdrivers
		Pipe Mountlist

	SYS:L/
		Pipe-handler


(I have not used any third party commands in this script...)

2. Copy ALL files/dirs included in this archive into the "main" directory of
   the demo you want to be Clickstarted.	 


3. When you Start the program for the first time it will ask for a file to
   execute. This could be a script or a executable file. The script will find
   the filetype for you. If you choose a script it will rename this script to 
   ReqBootFile and there will be made another script with an icon called 
   RenamedFile if you have selected wrong script or it seemed to be a datafile. 
   What you do is double click the RenamedFile icon and the file will recover 
   to the original.

4. When you have selected the requested file you will be asked about the
   minimum ammount of chip memory that the demo requires. If you select the 
   "Other" button the program ED will popup on your screen. Then you just type
   in the amount of memory in BYTES and push "Esc" and "x" button. 


If you use the script, and likes/dislikes it, feel free to write to me and tell
me what you think of it. Is it good or is it not worth the work you had to
unarchive it ? Comments, Suggestions, Threatnings and other nice things should
be sent to the following adress:
