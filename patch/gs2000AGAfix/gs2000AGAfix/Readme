Gunship 2000 AGA/CD32 Fix
Author: Spyridon Papakotsis
Version: 1.0

This patch removes the notorious feature present in the AGA and CD32
versions of Gunship 2000, which renders the player's missiles useless
in Flight and Campaign modes.
When patched, weapons effectiveness will be restored and the missiles
will work again, as they do in the ECS version.

You can easily apply this fix to hard disk installed versions or
floppies, by double clicking the "Install Patch" icon and following
the installer's instructions. Help is available for every step.

This requires the "Installer" program to be in the Path.
If you don't have it, you can look for it in the WB3.0/3.1 "Install"
disk, or preferably download Installer-43.3.lha from Aminet.

Alternatively, you can use the command line tool in the following
manner: gs2000AGAfix <Path to Gunship 2000>

If you want to fix the floppy version with the command line tool,
insert Disk 2 of the game and enter gs2000AGAfix df0: or something
equivalent.
