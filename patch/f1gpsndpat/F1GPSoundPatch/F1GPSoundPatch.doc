 F1GPSoundPatch V1.0 (14.1.96) - documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
--------------------------------------------------
1. INTRODUCTION:  F1GPSoundPatch - What is it for?
--------------------------------------------------

 I was annoyed of the fact that if I was listening to some trackermod while
playing F1GP, everytime a menu has faded in, the soundoutput was interrupted.

 So I traced F1GP a bit with my debugger and fortunately found the routine
which disables the audiointerrupts and audioDMA.
And that's where F1GPSoundPatch does a little change in the F1GP-executable.

 Just try it out. F1GPSoundPatch can remove itself when you start it again.


---------------------------------------------------
2. DISCLAIMER:  I'm not responsible for any damage!
---------------------------------------------------

 I've tested F1GPSoundPatch only on my system which is:
A500+, OS2.04, 2MB Chip, 4MB Fast, 68030-14MHz, ATBus-HD
with F1GP version 1.02 and it works with no problems.

 F1GPSoundPatch should (hopefully) work on every other Amiga even with
OS1.x, but it will probably *not work* with a different version than 1.02.

 If you have another version than I, the patch MIGHT CRASH YOUR AMIGA
when you run F1GP. In that case you will have to remove the patch by
rerunning F1GPSoundPatch.


-------------------------------------
3. USAGE:  How to run F1GPSoundPatch?
-------------------------------------

·If you have an assign `f1gp_disk_#2:' just start F1GPSoundPatch without
 arguments. The file `f1gp_disk_#2:f1gp' will be processed.

·Otherwise type: F1GPSoundPatch DH7:games/f1gp/f1gp
 ,where DH7:games/f1gp/f1gp must be replaced with your path and name of the
 F1GP-executable.

 When F1GPSoundPatch is started it scans the F1GP-executable and looks if
it is unpatched or patched.

In case it is unpatched it trys to install the SoundPatch.
If it is yet patched the patch will be removed.

4. LAST WORDS:

 A very big thank flies out to Geoff Crammond for his fantastic racing-games.
The first that fascinated me was `Revs' on my C=+4 then `Stuntcar Racer' on
the Amiga and of course `F1GP'.

 My hope is that with the new Amigas planned for '97 Geoff will release a
shining successor.
