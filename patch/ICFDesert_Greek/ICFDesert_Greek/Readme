It Came From The Desert - Greek Translation (Unofficial)
Author: Spyridon Papakotsis
Version: 1.0

This program will translate your Hard Disk installed "It Came From The Desert" to Greek.

Supported versions are:
1. Original U.S. Release
2. Original European Release
3. Hyperion's release for AmigaOS4

The Billy Bob Bug Fix (game/patch/ICFDesert_fix) is included.

Special thanks to Dimitrios Athanasiou (VincentGR) and Polina Papakotsi for their voices.

You can easily apply this translation by double clicking the "Install_Translation" 
icon and following the installer's instructions. Help is available for every step.

This requires the "Installer" program to be in the Path.
If you don't have it, you can look for it in the WB3.0/3.1 "Install"
disk, or preferably download Installer-43.3.lha from Aminet.

WORKBENCH 1.x users should use the Install_for_WB13 script to apply the translation.

Alternatively, you can use the command line tool in the following
manner: icfd_gr <Path to game drawer>

Non-WHDLoad users can start the game by double-clilcking on the "HDesert"
icon. WB1.3 users are treated with a 4-colour icon of an ant.
