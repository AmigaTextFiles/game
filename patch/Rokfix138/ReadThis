--- Transmission #150696 ---

This archive should contain 3 files:

Roketz          - upgraded program (V1.38)
Roketz_25.Dat   - fixed datafile
ReadThis        - the file you're currently reading.

If you upgrade from 1.31 then you'll need only the main file.

To "Install" upgrade just copy new files over the top of old ones:

Floppy users - Roketz to DISK 1 and Roketz_25.Dat to DISK 2.
HD users     - Both Roketz and Roketz_25.Dat to directory where you've
               installed your Roketz


NB! Floppy users should remove 'Stack x0000' line from s/startup-sequence
    on Disk 1 and HD users should set stack in Roketz.info (icon file) to
    4096 (which is default) - this is only neccesery if you have no fastmem.
