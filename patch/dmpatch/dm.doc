Installing Dungeon Master on a hard disk
---------- ------- ------ -- - ---- ----

The included patches remove all protection AND all the "features" that
prevent it from be run from any device (like a hard drive).

Note that although these docs are geared toward hard disk installation,
you can install it on a plain old floppy too.

What to do:

Create a DM subdir. Copy the two .dat files, DM, and EXEC to the subdir.
(swoosh, the title screen, is no longer needed). Copy the files in this
archive into the subdir. Type:

lpatch dm
delete dm
rename dm.new to dm
lpatch exec
delete exec
rename exec.new exec

Done! To run DM, edit the BOOT file (see below) and type EXECUTE BOOT.
Note that the KillPtr program provided does just that - it makes the
mouse pointer invisible (by calling SetPrefs). DM uses its own sprite for
the pointer.

Hints:

Create a subdir and a version of BOOT for each saved game you want to
maintain. For example, I have a subdir called DanSave that I use; another
member of my family uses a subdir called GwenSave, and there is a boot
file for each.

If you don't have a hard drive, you still get several benefits:
1) No disk access except when saving your game.
2) You can save your game directly on your working copy of DM, so there's
   no disk swapping if you only have 1 floppy.
3) No copy protection

If the patches cause the game to crash, you have a different version than
I do. I have NO idea how many different versions there are (hopefully just
one or two). If you have problems, please contact me.

*** NOTES ON THE CRACKED VERSION OF DUNGEON MASTER ***

1) The cracked version can load from and save to any device or directory -
   a hard disk, for example. Two ASSIGN commands are required to provide the
   device/directory information to AmigaDOS:

   ASSIGN DUNGEONMASTER: PATH1
      tells the system to load the Dungeon Master program from PATH1

   ASSIGN DUNGEONSAVE: PATH2
      tells the system to save/restore your adventure-in-progress
      to/from PATH2

   Substitute the paths you want in the batch file BOOT.

2) Inserting a floppy disk with a label of DUNGEONMASTER or DUNGEONSAVE will
   override the corrisponding ASSIGN statement.

P.S. I (Dan Babcock) cracked this myself, so there are no viruses or other
"tricks" to worry about.
