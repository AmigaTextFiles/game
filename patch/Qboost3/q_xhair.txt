Description             : After I creating the improved crosshair for Hexen 2
                          and emailing a few Hexen 2 pages, I started getting
                          email asking where to get the original Quake
                          crosshair that I mentioned.  I've added this text,
                          but basically here is the original modified gfx.wad
                          for Quake.  Again, I am told Saber9 is the original
                          creator of this crosshair, so the credit goes to
                          him.

                          Although am I not certain of the exact method used
                          by Saber9, the console font can be edited using
                          the program AdQuedit (which can be obtained at
                          http://goldrush.com/~hicks/adquedit/).  Simply
                          export the entry CONCHARS in gfx.wad and edit with
                          any graphics editor, then import the edited version
                          back into gfx.wad and save.

Additional Credits to   : id for creating the Quake.
                               (http://www.idsoftware.com)
                          Saber9 for creating the crosshair.

Installation            : Unzip this archive into a temporary directory.
                          Rename the file pak2.pak to pakX.pak where X is the
                          next highest number of pak file in you Quake
                          /id1 directory.  The default name is pak2.pak.
                          If you have the registered version of Quake
                          and have not modified it, renaming will not be
                          necessary.  However, you are advised to check
                          anyway.  Under NO circumstances should you
                          overwrite an existing pakfile in your /id1
                          directory.  Once you have renamed the file, copy it
                          to the /id1 directory in your Quake directory.
                          You may then delete the files in the temporary
                          directory.
