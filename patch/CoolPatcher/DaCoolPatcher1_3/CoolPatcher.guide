@node "fw" "DCP is Freeware now"

 I finally decided to release Da Cool Patcher as Freeware. There`re
 several reasons why:

 · nearly all the patches were taken from Amiga Patch List by Mark Knibbs
   and not made by me (although coding the rest was alot of work either)

 · and I think 20 DM (15$) were too much as a Shareware fee then so I first
   decided to lower it but then decided to release it as Freeware

 Some thanks also to Magic Rocket who tried to persuade me to release it
 as Freeware ;)

 So enjoy this full version of Da Cool Patcher and DON`T forget to send
 me your feedback! (It`s very important in those hard times...)

 Greets,

         Andreas

@node "install" "Usage"

 Select a game from the listview with the currently loaded patch base
 and click on one of the following buttons:

 Start Patching: This patches the currently selected game. After pressing
 this button Da Cool Patcher will load in the patch and ask you for a file
 of the selected game/program which will be patched. After you`ve selected
 this file DCP will check if you got the correct version and then the file
 will be patched. If the game is disk-only you`ve to insert the disk and DCP
 will do the same procedure as above but from disk.

 Start Unpatching: This unpatches the currently selected game. Unpatching
 can be useful if a patch doesn`t work with a game.

 Patch Editor: With the Patch Editor you can create your own patches. After
 you`ve pressed this button a new window will open. In that window you have
 to type some information like game`s name, game`s developer, patch author etc.
 and you need of course specify the patch offset and the patches. It`s also
 possible to import patches in the Patch Editor: Click the 'Import' button
 and then on a patch in the main listview. If you click on 'Save' the patch will
 be saved to the user patchbase.

 About: Displays some information about the program 

 Exit: Quits Da Cool Patcher.

                        MUI - MagicUserInterface

                              Version 3.8

MUI  is  an object oriented system to create and maintain graphical user
interfaces.  From  a programmers point of view, using MUI saves a lot of
time  and  makes life much easier. Thinking about complicated terms like
window resizing or font sensitivity is simply not neccesary.

On  the  other hand, users of MUI based applications have the ability to
customize  nearly every pixel of a programs interface according to their
personal taste.

Please click on the Install-MUI icon to install MUI on your system or to
update from previous versions.  Latest news and support  can be found on
Internet at www.sasg.com.

    If you're still not registered for MUI, check the new and unique
