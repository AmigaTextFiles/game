                              !!! MAJOR UPDATE !!! 


 Install Kit V3.5 is THE CD32 emulator & installer. With the help of a
 cool GUI you can install over 120 CD32 & CDTV games. There are many games,
 which don`t run with an emulator, for example: Chaos Engine, Lotus Trilogy,
 Out to lunch, Lunar C & Overkill, James Pond 3, Battletoads, Defender
 of the Crown 2, Universe.....

 With the InstallKit`s "Install2001" technology nothing is impossible!

 With the inbuild CD Installer you can even install CD32 Games which aren`t
 pre-defined by me. The CD32 Games Install Kit also emulates the nonvolatile
 memory of the CD32. So you can save all your CD32 games (saves are redirected
 to harddisk!).

 There`s also a direct emulator inbuild in the CD32 Games Install Kit 
 that will boot your game directly off the CD-ROM.

 Install Kit V3.5 comes with a lot of cool bonus programs that are available
 for download on the Airsoft Softwair webpage:

 - CD32Boot, a direct emulator for CD32 CDs. Start it, insert CD. Finished!
 - De-InstallKit, deletes Install Kit installed games.
 - Installer2Disk, extracts your self created Installer and copies them to
                   a drawer you want. That`s good, if you want upload your
                   Installer to Aminet
 - Disk2Installer, copies the Installer (downloaded from Aminet) to the
                   Install Kit directory
 - Install Kit Screenblanker, the original Install Kit Screenblanker.
                              Supports Protracker Module & Password.
 - ChangeIcons, replace the default icons with your own icons
 - Icons, many many icons for lots of games
 - Cheat Kit, over 100 cheats for CD32 games
 - Info Kit, infos and a scanned pic from many CD32 games

 Install Kit V3.5 has an AmigaGuide® documentation in different languages,
 supports reqtools.library and has an inbuild help option for fast online help.
 It supports locale.library too.

 Install Kit was tested on several configurations up to A4000/060. It
 features an intuitive Gadtools GUI and can be installed easily with the
 NewInstaller by Airsoft Softwair.
