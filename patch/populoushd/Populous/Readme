That fix applies to Populous (c) 1989 Bullfrog, various versions.

Supported versions: 
- Original 2.7ß 
- The 2.7ß from the award winner compilation with crunched data files
- Hit-Squad-rerelease.
This install has the parameter-version 1.2.

You have 3 choices: Install to hd, patch a backup-floppy and (later)
install an already with this script patched floppy to hd.
On installing to hd, you have the choice to install Populous or 
the Datadisk. If there is more than one Datadisk, you have to rename
the directory of the datadisk on hd before installing the next one.
The Patcher can be obtained from Jeffs Patch&HD-Installers page or 
the WHDLoad-package.

You will have to install it with that install to run it properly from hd.
Sorry, there's no quit-option (and probably will never be).
You might have to boot with OCS or add something like KillAGA before starting,
only if the workbench can be closed the game degrades itself properly.

Fixed:   Diskprotectionchecks caused crashs on 68020+ (remove taken from 
           Quartex-crack). Now also diskdrive-accesses disabled.
         Delays added, game was too fast (not in the demomode, have a look
           how fast it would be on your computer).
         Access to rootdir of bootdevice redirected to P: on hd-version.

Note:    Some people mentioned that the path which can be entered on the
           file requesters is too short. To save your game in the actual
           Populous-directory simply save it to P:.

This fix was successfully tested on a plain A1200 and on an 18 MB 68030.
