WHAT IS THIS ?
--------------

If you have the game "The Clue" (Standard ECS version), © 1994 NEO Gmbh,installed
on your harddisk you can use this edited savegame datadisk to get started with a
very fat wallet!... (£16M+)... indeed !

You can even use this cheat if you play the game from floppies!.

HOW TO DO IT ?
--------------

Copy the entire "datadisk" drawer into your "TheClue" directory.You may need to
rename your original "datadisk" directory first,just in case you want to play the
game in the "good old hard way" later on !...

If you are playing from floppy,you must first create a fresh Saved Game Disk.
Copy the contents of the "datadisk" drawer (not the drawer itself!) over to the
newly created Savegame disk and overwrite the existing files there.

Start the game and choose "Continue an Old Game" and than choose the first and
only saved game.Voila !!!... Now check your cash and see you have more than 16
million in pounds !.

Well,what's the point if you already have so much cash ?...
You get the things you need more easily,that's all !...

PROBLEM:
--------

If you play this game ,like I, on an A1200 with a multisync monitor,and if you
have Mode Promotion turned ON, you will notice that the game opens its screens in
the current display mode (eg.DblPAL).But the screens that should be placed
edge-to-edge, instead overlap each other , and one of them is quite corrupted!.
With Mode Promotion turned OFF,the game opens its screens in its default mode
(PAL Lowres) and runs without problem.

To cure this problem   (e.g. running the game without rebooting to the "Early
Startup" or changing the system preferences and still using the hires screenmodes)
I tried several degraders-promotors with no avail.The best solution seems to be to
turn OFF Mode Promotion (at Sys:Prefs/IControl , and choose USE -not SAVE !)

If anyone has solved this problem I would much appreciate to hear from him !.
