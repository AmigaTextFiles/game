            Hiscore Joiner for SLAMTILT

              By Oriens / Les Shadock


 This program simply takes two tables  of hiscores,
and  links  them. The result  will be saved  on the
first tables loaded. 

In  order to  use this  joiner, you  should respect
two rules :

1) Execute the program in your  SlamTilt directory.
   (The four hiscores  tables will be only searched
   in  the current directory.)
   These files are: Mean.dat, Pirate.dat, Space.dat
   and Demo.dat.

2) Copy the four others tables on a disk which will
   be asked in DF0:.

NB: This program needs Reqtool.lib to run.

                Have fun with the great SLAMTILT !!
