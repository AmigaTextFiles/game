translatetr 0.1 - an English mod for TurboRaketti by Rixa.

CD to the directory holding the TurboRaketti game files and run the
program to patch them. You can run it again to revert the mod, but
of course you should be smart and not use your original registered
floppy or any other irreplaceable data. Files are being modified,
things can go wrong, and I won't take responsibility for any damage.

The mod should apply to the freeware version as well as version
2.11 registered. The existing WHDLoad slave should continue to work
with the former.

Aside from the translation I have also improved the kerning between
letters in the main menu and patched up the hole that appears in the
ship in certain rotations.

Enjoy!
