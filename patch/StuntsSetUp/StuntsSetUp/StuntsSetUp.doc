Installation:
-------------
Just double-click the icon and select your Stunts drawer.
Note that your existing highscores will be copied to the settings, so
you might have an Indy highscore on your _LM-002 highscore list.

To play stunts:
---------------
1. Start 'SetUp' program
2. Select dir with cars (starts with _)
3. Start Stunts via Workbench
4. After playing, run 'Done' Program

Designing new tracks:
---------------------
1. Start 'SetUp' program
2. Select LM-002
3. Design and test one or more tracks
4. Exit Stunts
5. Start 'NewTracks' program and the highscores for the new tracks will be
copied to all car-settings (i.e. _NSX )

N.B. Selecting LM-002, ensures that the highscore made while testing, is 
beatable.

Erasing highscores:
-------------------
Modifying the track withing a setting, the highscore for that setting will be
deleted (remember to start 'Done')

WHAT ?
------
StuntsSetUp is a program to have seperate highscores for seperate cars in the
commercial game Stunts (4d sports driving).
Normally, Stunts has only one highscore list for each track. With StuntsSetUp,
you can make a 'car setting' with a collection of Cars.
With the supplied setting, there is one highscore for each car-track
combination. Each setting, has cars up to a certain mph. NSX setting has the
AcuraNSX and all slower cars, for instance.
Note that the 'carcount.res' (Lamborghini Countach) file must be present in
all settings, as it is needed by the intro. If you don't want the countach in
a setting, you can clone another file. Just go open a shell, go to where stunts
is located by typing :
CD <where stunts is>
Then type :
Copy carlm02.res _<your setting>/carcount.res
The countach will act as the lm-002, but the shape is selectable. The intro
won't work properly either, but the game should start.
