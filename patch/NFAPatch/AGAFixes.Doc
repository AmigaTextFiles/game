	Don't forget many supposedly incompatible programs will work on the
AGA machines by suitable adjustment of the boot options. (Hold down both mouse
buttons when booting).

****  AGA software patches. *****

These programs were supplied with Amiga Format recently. They seem to
be intended for the A1200, but I have got the Heimdall and Powermonger patches
to work on the A4000. I haven't got the R-Type patch to work.

Patches are included for:

Powermonger

Powermonger World War I data disk

Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker

R-Type

Shadowlands (but it could be Shadowworlds - I don't have the program)

Heimdall

Last Ninja 3

Speedball 2

Naturally these patches will only work on ORIGINAL versions of the games
- so tough luck pirates.

How do I use them?

Place these files onto a disk, or your harddisk. To launch them click
on the icon. The screen will fill with horizontal coloured bars. On the A1200
they should stop moving, on the A4000 wait until the disk drive light goes out.

When the program has loaded, insert the boot disk of the game in 
question and click on the mouse button. It should load as normal.

A final note. I didn't create these programs so don't blame me if they
don't work.
