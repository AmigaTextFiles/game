Frontier patch (v1.1) by Teemu Suikki 09-Nov-93
Usage: FrontierPatch filename

NOTE: This program makes changes directly to the file, and the result
is saved with the same name. So you better not patch your only copy of
Frontier..

After the patch is made, you can EXIT from Frontier by pressing "X" when
the demo is running or in the "Select start position" menu.

This patch should work with all versions of Frontier.
