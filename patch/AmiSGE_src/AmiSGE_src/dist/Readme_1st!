DESCRIPTION

    This is version 1.00 of a program to decode the saved games produced
    by the Amiga version of "Frontier:Elite II" to raw binary files and also
    encode raw files back into a form that will be recognised by the game.

    In this way saved games may be decoded, edited with a binary file editor
    and then encoded again ready for use in the game.

    Saved games from all versions of Amiga Frontier are supported. Savegames
    from the PC version of Frontier are not supported.
