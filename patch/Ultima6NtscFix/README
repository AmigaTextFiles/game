                   NTSC fix for european version of Ultima6
                         Fixed by Entity/CyberNetworx


   If you've purchased a copy of Ultima6 through a european distributor and
hate having to PALboot constantly just to play the game, here's the solution.
Simply copy this file 'ultima6' into your ultima directory.   This file
replaces the old ultima6 file, so just to be on the safe side you might
want to first make a backup of this file.  Just:
 
copy ultima6 ultima6.bak

before you copy my ultima6 fix file in -- Just in case!  If anything screws
up, you can always copy the original back in.  Works 100% for me, but I'm
not liable if it screws anything up for you.  Make a backup of that file
first to avoid any regrets later :)
