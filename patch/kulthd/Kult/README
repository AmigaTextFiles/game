That fix applies to Kult (c) 1989 Ere Informatique.

Fixed:  Soundinterrupt preinitialized to avoid the crash on Kick2.0+.
        Some dbf-delays replaced.
        Accesses to DF0: redirected to KLT:.

Sorry, there's no quit-option.
You have to promote Kults screen to PAL or to boot with OCS before starting.
I recommend strongly to boot before starting the game because i have to
  switch the workbench to PAL and set the screen positions to a special
  value to make the game work properly (and that cant be done if you have
  an active window on the workbench).

Known Bugs/problems: The game uses its own mouse pointer. It may happen
          that it switches unexpected to the workbench (because you clicked
          at the corresponding gadget with the real pointer). In that case
          switch back with LeftAmiga-M.
        Sometimes the sfx are not played fully.
        The original release has a bug in the german data file: if you look
          at the spider mistress the game crashes. Either dont look at her
          or do it in the english/french language.

Note:   The rerelease had so many bugs that i included the original exe.

A solution of the game is provided, but as lha in this archive. Look only
if you are REALLY stuck!

Disclaimer: Although i try to make my installs as reliable as possible, you 
          use them wholly on your own risk.
