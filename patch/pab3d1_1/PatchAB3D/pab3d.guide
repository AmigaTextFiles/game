@node intro "Introduction"
                  
@{b}@{u}Introduction@{ub}@{uu}

Many years ago I bought the classic Team 17 game "Alien Breed 3D". I really
liked this game and played it a lot, using the keyboard. I got quite far
but never really finished it.

Since then I've gone on to enjoy other 3d games such as Duke Nukem, adopting
the mouse as my controller of choice. Recently I thought I'd have another
go at completing AB3D, so I fired it up. I was all ready to go kick some
alien butt, when I remembered that you cant use the keyboard and mouse
at the same time... D'OH!!!

This annoyed me so much, I disassembled the executable and went about fixing
this annoying problem. This was no easy task; the exe took a full 10 minutes
to disassemble, resulting in a humungous 6mb source! So, after a 2 days of
sifting through the gargantuan mess (and mess it is, I don't wish any
disrespect toward Andy Clitheroe, but some of this is really badly coded!!)
I put together some patches. Originally I was just going to patch the
control system, but I kept spotting more and more things that were worth
patching :)

And here is the result!
@endnode

@node usage "Using PAB3D"

@{b}@{u}How to use@{uu}@{ub}

Before you can use PAB3D, you need to backup your AB3D executable like this:

1.Work:Games/AB3D> copy abd.pk abd.bak

Note: It *HAS* to be called abd.bak!! Then we decrunch this backup using
the xfddecrunch program supplied with the pab3d archive, like this:

1.Work:Games/AB3D> xfddecrunch abd.bak

Now copy over the "pab3d" executable to your AB3D directory, and you
are ready to use PAB3D from the CLI. You have to specify which patches
you want whenever you run PAB3D. These patches are available to you:



ND=NODISKWAIT

Removes the request asking you to insert disk 2 at the beginning, which is
pointless if the game is HD installed :)



NP=NOPROT

Removes the codebook protection. PLEASE NOTE that I have *ONLY* included
this option for the convenience of LIGITIMATE USERS. I do not condone
or encourage the use of this program for piracy. If you want to play
AB3D, buy it first.



MK=MOUSEKEY

Allows you to use the mouse to steer and shoot, and the keyboard for
everything else. Also, you can now walk forwards with the right mouse-
button and backwards with the middle mousbutton. The following limitations
apply when this patch is installed:

 * You can no longer move forward/back by moving the mouse
 * You can no longer fire with the keyboard, even in keyboard mode!!!
 
 
 
SP=SAVEPASS

This patch adds two extra options to the main menu, with which you can
save the current password to disk, or restore one you saved earlier.

The password is saved in "AB3D1:password.dat".



SK=SAVEKEYS

This patch adds two extra options to the controls menu, with which you
can save or load your favourite keyboard setup. If this option is enabled,
PAB3D will load in your keyboard settings when you run the game.

Keyboard settings are stored in "AB3D1:control.prefs".



IGK=INGAMEKEYS

This patch adds some more ingame keys. With this patch, you can press:

  TAB: Toggle run mode on/off (run key still works)

It also adds the following cheat keys:  

  F1:  Increase ammo for the pulse rifle (weapon 1)
  F2:  Give you the shotgun, and increase its ammo (weapon 2)
  F3:  Give you the plasmagun, and increase its ammo (weapon 3)
  F4:  Give you the grenade launcher + increase ammo (weapon 4)
  F5:  Give you the rocket launcher + increase ammo (weapon 5)
  F6:  Increase your health
  
  

MS=MOUSESPEED

With this option, you must specify a number from 1-4. This number is
how much more sensitive the mouse is when turning. 2 is twice as fast,
3 is three times as fast etc. etc. If you dont specify a number, the
patch wont be installed and control will be at normal sensitivity.



RH=RUNHACK

If this options is set "HackAB3D" will be run before the game starts.
For this to work, you must have the HackAB3D executable in the AB3D
game directory. HackAB3D is available from the aminet.



PORT0 or PORT1

This patch incorperates the functionality of John Girvin's "SetJoyPort"
program. What this does is tell lowlevel.library what sort of controller
is in the port. You specify one of the following numbers:

  0 = Autosense
  1 = CD32 Joypad
  2 = Mouse
  3 = Joystick


So, to start PAB3D with all patches, a CD32 pad in port 1 and a mouse speed
of 2, type:

pab3d NODISKWAIT NOPROT MOUSEKEY SAVEPASS SAVEKEYS INGAMEKEYS MOUSESPEED=2 RUNHACK PORT1=1

or

pab3d ND NP MK SP SK IGK MS=2 RH PORT1=1

@endnode

@node futur "The Future"

@{u}@{b}Future@{uu}@{ub}

Things that *may* get added:

- Level editor and ability to play user levels

    John Girvin has hacked the level format and sent me the details I did
    start work on a level editor in SAS/C, but it became about as stable as
    Windows. I might start again, I might not. E-Mail me if you really want
    this...

- Exit to OS option

    This is VERY difficult, but may happen...

- Suggestions

Things that *WONT* get added, so don't ask:

- 1x1 pixel mode
  
    No chance
  
- Any modifications to the 3D engine
  
    You know, no matter how long you look at the uncommented disassembly
    of a complex first person perspective 3d engine, it still wont make
    any sense. While I can figure out menu systems, and control methods,
    3D engines are a whole other ball game :)
  
    Actually, I do now have the sourcecode on a CD somewhere, but I still
    don't want to modify the 3D engine, because I don't have time.

@node bugss "Known bugs"

@{u}@{b}Known Bugs@{uu}@{ub}

I dont know if its a bug of PAB3D or the original game, but sometimes you
have to hit "PLAY GAME" several times on the main menu before a game starts.
I dont @{i}think @{ui}its a result of me patching the menu system, but dont
report this bug, because I know about it, and its not serious (just keep
pressing it.. :)

The game can occasionally freeze up. Once again I'm not entirely convinced
this is the fault of the patch, or what I can do about it. The fault is
only intermittant and isnt too much of a problem.

@node usgui "Using the GUI"

@{u}@{b}Using the GUI@{uu}@{ub}

PatchAB3D is designed to be used from the CLI. I have written a GUI which
basically runs the CLI program for you.

Before you can use the GUI, you have to first prepare your Alien Breed 3D
executable, as described under @{"Usage" LINK usage}.

Now, @{b}in addition@{ub} to copying over pab3d to your AB3D directory, you
should also copy over the following files:

pab3d_gui
pab3d_gui.prefs
PatchAB3D_GUI
PatchAB3D_GUI.info
run_pab3d
Run_PAB3D.info

Now, when you wish to change your PAB3D options, click on the "PatchAB3D_GUI"
icon. If you want to start PAB3D with your last saved options, click on the
"Run_PAB3D" icon.

When you run the GUI, just tick all the patches that you want to run.
Selecting "Save" will save these options and run the PAB3D cli program,
selecting "Use" will use these options without saving them.

Note that the keyboard setup shown in the GUI only works if the "Save Keys"
patch is ON, and you leave the GUI with "Save".

@node troub "Troubleshooting"

@{u}@{b}Troubleshooting@{ub}@{uu}

@{b}@{i}All this installation is tricky! I'm not used to using the Shell! What
can I do?? @{ui}@{ub}
Hmmm... I admit it could seem quite tricky to install, but it really isnt
that hard. If you are totally useless with the CLI, then you just wont
be able to install it, sorry.


@{b}@{i}I set up my keys in the GUI, but when the game runs, they revert back! @{ui}@{ub}
Click "Save" when you leave the GUI, and not "Use".


@{b}@{i}When I run the patch, all I get is a blank screen! @{ui}@{ub}
Make sure you have "AB3D1:" and "AB3D2:" assigned to your AB3D directory.


@{b}@{i}I have the CD32 version of AB3D. Can I use the patch? @{ui}@{ub}
You can try, but I doubt it would work, and if it doesnt, theres nothing
I can do to fix it for you. This patch is designed to work with the
A1200 version.

@{u}@{b}Team17 are great!@{uu}@{ub}

I'd like to say a big thankyou to the guys at Team17 for giving me
permission to include the no protection patch. For a moment I thought
I was going to have to remove it, but as long as I don't charge for
PatchAB3D (which I wasn't going to anyway) they said I could keep it
in. Good work fella's :)
