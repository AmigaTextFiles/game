           @{b}Foundation V1.2 (Update 20)@{ub} (5-November-1998)
              * Free from Distribution Restrictions *
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* The term "Demo version" refers to the new Demo released after September
  1998 and not the demo released in 1997.
* The term "Full version" refers to the commercial CD version of
  "Foundation" (C)1997-1998 Paul Burkey & Sadeness Software.

This guide gives information on installing the Foundation Demo and the
regular Updates. The Updates are currently compatable with the Demo
version of the game as well as the Full version.

Updates will continue for yet another 6 months at least! I'm still trying
to keep the Update archives small enough to fit onto a 720k floppy disk
although various extra archives will be released containing extra sound
and improved graphics.

@{b}Note:@{ub} You don't require the previous Update archives. All changes
that have been made since the original CD release are included with every
update archive. The demo archive will come with the latest version already
installed when compiled.

@{b}Important for Demo users:@{ub} The demo version contains features and
improvements that are NOT found in the Full version. However, the Full
version can be updated to contain all these new features by following the
@{"Installation of Updates" LINK "Install"} information. This means everyone
who has the demo will also have the necessary files to update their copy of
the game.

   @{" Information about the Demo " LINK "Demo"} important for demo users!

out for those if you want use the latest version. The latest version will
also be available on the Foundation Support Web page as well as Aminet and
future Aminet CD's. The Updates are free from distribution restrictions so
if you run a PD library, BBS or any other form of software distribution
service, feel free to provide the latest Update to your customers/users.

@NODE "Demo" "Demo Installation"

Installation of the Demo is very easy. You simply unarchive the "FoundDemo"
directory to your Hard Drive and then launch the "FoundationPrefs" program
to setup your Screen Modes and other "optional" settings.

If you want to run the AGA version then you must select standard AGA 256
colour screen modes for the Menu screens and the Game screen. If you re running
the RTG version then you must select 8-bit screen modes for Menu screens and
Game screen.

@{b}Note:@{ub} This demo contains "lowres" files only. A highres distribution
would have resulted in a huge archive. Because of this fact the screen modes
must be between 320x240 - 320x256 in size (lowres screens only!). The Full
version doesn't have such limits and comes with 3 different sizes of graphics
providing more detail for higher resolutions.

@{b}Demo version and Full version differences:@{ub} The demo version is a
vastly cut down version of the game. The Full version CD contains over
180Meg of game data which includes 2Meg of music modules, 6Meg of sound
and over 100Meg of graphics. The Demo version is less than 8Meg in size
so you can imagine how little you are seeing. The biggest difference
is the limit to lowres modes only. With highres screens the menu's and
into graphics are of a very high quality while the demo version is rather
poor and difficult to read. The demo is limited to just one Mission out
of the 40 Missions provided in the Full version. Other features of
the Full version are listed below.

Full version, main features:

  * AGA, CyberGraphX and Picasso96 modes supported.
  * The game can also use AHI for sound effects.
  * Choice of screen modes including Lowres PAL, NTSC, Hires/Laced, DblPAL etc.
  * Screen mode sizes are only limited to Hardware being used. (minimum 320x240)
  * One player Vs. one, two or three computer opponents.
  * A 40 Mission conquest is included. More FREE conquests will be released soon.
  * Custom game setup with custom maps, enemies, startup modes, missions.
  * Many languages are supported - English, German, Spanish, French and many more.
  * Online help is available during play.
  * The game includes a custom made intro of over 700 frames!
  * Special Hi-Res and Med-Res graphics are available.
  * Over 80 breathtaking intro screens are available to introduce each mission.
  * Hundreds of speech samples and sound effects.
  * Amazing original soundtrack provided by Simon Ravn (Melomaniac)
  * CD Audio soundtrack durring gameplay.
  * Flexable Load and Save options.
  * Various game/system preferences.
  * Custom sound support.
  * Ongoing development of the game for many months to come.
  * Much more!

Instructions on playing the game can be found in the latest game Manual. The
latest game manual can be found in various forms including online version,
online archives, aminet archives as well as other sources.

The online Manual can be found on the @{"Foundation Support Site" LINK "SupportSite"} along with
downloadable archives in English and other languages. The support site can also
be found on current Amiga Format CD's.

@NODE "Debug" "Debug Version"

The debug version is only available from the Support Site and will not be
found in Aminet versions. The debug version is used to help those who are
experiencing rare compatability problems.

The game works fine on all 020, 030, 040 and 060 Amigas and also works well
with all tested graphics cards together with CyberGraphX and/or Picasso96.

If you do have problems running the game then you should first:-

Try running the game with a minimal startup eg, Workbench with no commodities/hacks.
Avoid screen promoters which could cause the game to open invalid modes.
Try to free as much chip ram as possible before running AGA version.
Try running the game with a lowres screen mode before trying bigger screens.
Ensure you hve the latest version of CyberGraphX or Picasso96.
Try running the game with CDDA turned off if you suspect CD Audio problems.
Never make Assigns such as "Foundation:" to your HD instilation.

If you still have problems then you can run the debug version of the game. This will
create a report file in the main Foundation directory called FoundationDebug.report
Then send the report file to me at <burkey@bigfoot.com> and I will examine the
results for potential problems. Also, give me some other details such as Amiga setup,
description of problem eg, "Crashes at menu screen" or "Crashes 10 seconds into game".

* WARNING *

The game will write the report file as it is running the game. Each file write will
open/write/close the file... It is unlikely that the game would crash durring this
stage and at all other times the file will be closed. BUT there is a small chance
that a crash could invalidate your Hard Drive so beware! If you can install the
game to a Zip disk, recoverable Ram disk or other safe device then that might be
the ideal solution.

I suspect that this debug version will only be used by one or two people each month
because compatability problems have been very low! If thre is a need to improve the
way the report file system works I will change it.

@NODE "Faq" "Faq's"

Here is a list of Frequently Asked Questions and common problems that have been collected
durring 100's of Emails since the game was released.

@{i}Q. The game won't start! Why can't I get it to run?@{ui}

A. You must setup some basic preferences. You do this by running
   FoundationPrefsand then you press the USE button to setup some prefs in RAM. If
   you've copied FoundationPrefs to the Hard Drive, you could use the SAVE button
   to setup some perminent prefs for future use. If the game doesn't find the prefs
   files in RAM or in the current directory it will not run.

@{i}Q. Why does the game seem to crash as early as the menu screens?@{ui}

   A. You are probably using the AGA version and the crashes are due to a lack of
   chip memory. If you use the default menu screen size (640x256) or bigger, the
   game will use quite a lot of chip memory. This problem is made worse my the
   large 500k music module and also by large Workbench screens. Some checks for low
   Chip-mem have been added to the game but it dosn't seem to be foolproof.

@{i}Q. How can I play the CD Audio tracks? The game keeps loading files, stopping
   the CD playback.@{ui}

A. You must install te minimum files required for CDDA playback. In the current
   version of the FoundationPrefs you must select the first three Instillation
   buttons. These are Samples, Mugshots and Game GFX. This amounts to 33Meg of
   files. In a future update I will provide extra filter options to allow you to
   install `AGA only' or `RTG only' files.

@{i}Q. Why do I have problems running the game in Hires modes with the AGA version?@{ui}

A. The AGA version was developed with `low end' support in mind. This means I
   made every effort to allow users to play the game on a 640x256 size screen but
   anything bigger than that was going beyond the limits of AGA (playability). The
   preferences program should really have been designed to stop users from
   selecting screens bigger than 640x256 but the limit was never implimented.

@{i}Q. Why is the Intro Anim so slow in AGA?@{ui}

A. I had a few small problems with the AGA anim playback routines in the last
   few days of development. These problems forced me to use an older (Chip Mem
   based) routine for the AGA version which made the playback safer but slower.
   This is something I will replace in one of the first updates. The RTG anim
   playback has room for improvement too.

@{i}Q. Where is the game documentation?@{ui}

A. There is documentation on the CD but when it was created we discovered the
   Icon for the html drawer was missing. The documentation can be found on the CD
   in the html drawer. I will also create a detailed Players Guide to provide more help soon.

@{i}Q. The manual states that new trees can be created `at any time'. Is this true?@{ui}

A. I'm afraid this is not true. In order to create new trees and rocks you must
   develop the required commands in the Laboratory. The `Summon Rocks' spell will
   be developed durring Tech Level 6 and the `Summon Trees' spell will come durring
   Tech Level 7.

@ENDNODE


@NODE "Install" "Installation"

The Update files can be used to Update the Demo version AND the Full version.
The exe files will detect which version you have installed and run in that
particular mode.

@{b}Note to users Upgrading the Full version: @{ub}

I would recomend working from a redy-installed version of the game but
the new version of FoundationPrefs will work as an installation tool if you
want to install a fresh copy. Once you have made a Hard Drive installation
of the game you can replace the original exe files (FoundationAGA and
FoundationRTG) with those found in the Update.

*NEW from Update 16* You must also copy the "FoundUpd" directory into
your Foundation instilation directory. This new directory contains extra
graphics and data files. Please note that you do NOT need to copy individual
files from the FoundUpd directory. The FoundUpd directory is copied "as is"
into the root of your Foundation directory.

@{b}Note to users Upgrading the Demo version: @{ub} Installation is the
same as above although you should be starting with a ready installed copy
of the demo. So, you simply replace the exe files and copy the FoundUpd
directory into the FoundDemo directory.

@{b}Note to Full version users Upgrading from Demo: @{ub} If you have
previously been playing the Demo version and you want to update the Full
version then you must first install the game to Hard Drive as normal. Then
you have to replace the FoundationPrefs, FoundationAGA, FoundationRTG with
the versions found in the Demo version.. Then finaly you must copy the
"FoundUpd" directory into your Hard Drive installation.

@ENDNODE
 

@NODE "CustSound" "Custom Sounds"

The custom samples are standard IFF-8SVX sounds which are named using the rules
described below.  The samples are placed in a new directory called "CustSound/"
which will be located in the root of your Foundation installation. If you run the
new version of FoundationPrefs (V1.53 of higher) the Directory will be created
for you. When you run the FoundationPrefs program it will ensure this directory
exists and it will create an index file called CustSound.dat there. This index
file tells Foundation (V1.03 and higher) a little about the available samples.
Using the new "Custom Sounds" page of FoundationPrefs will show you which sounds
are available and you can also Test them to be sure that they are real 8SVX sounds.

Character Speech
----------------

There are three classes of characters in Foundation. The most common is the "male"
class which covers Peasants, Wizards and Scientists. Next is the Soldier class
which covers all battle units. There is also a "Maiden" class. Each character has
4 simple phrases.

   Hello   - a general greeting, used when you select the character.
   Ok      - an acknowledgement, used when you give a 'good' command.
   No      - a refusal, used when you give an illegal command.
   Already - phrase used when you make a command that is already being executed.

Instead of using a messy number system I have built in a name system so
you can give each character a name, for example we may give our first
male character the name "baz". To add a "Hello" sample to "baz" we would
give the sample the name "male-baz-hello0". Now this has added a new
sample set to the "male" class. One "Hello" sample is all you need to
add a new character but I recomend you to use at least one of each type
for example...

male-baz-hello0
male-baz-ok0
male-baz-no0
male-baz-already0

This has added a full range of speech to a new "male" character called "baz".
You could add extra samples by giving them higher numbers so we may have
9 or more samples for this character for example...

male-baz-hello0
male-baz-ok0, male-baz-ok1, male-baz-ok2, male-baz-ok3
male-baz-no0, male-baz-no1
male-baz-already0, male-baz-already1

For Maidens you would use something like "maiden-sally-hello0"
For Soldiers you would use something like "soldier-raj-hello0"

The most common speech is the "ok" sample so please try to use at least 2
"ok" samples for each character. As I mentioned, 1 "hello" sample is the
minimum needed for a character but you should try to add a full range. If
a phrase is missing for your character you will not hear any sound for
that particular phrase.

I have created a small example set of custom speech samples to explain how
this all works. The archive is called FoundCustSpeech.lha and it should be
available on the support web site, Aminet and wherever you found this file!


Sample Limits
-------------

Try not to use samples bigger than 40k but 60k is probably a fair limit. I've
not tested anything bigger than 60k. The current system will cope with up to
128 samples for each character and up to 100 custom characters. These limits
will be raised in the near future. The game was never designed to use samples
bigger than 40k so *beware* of chip mem problems!
