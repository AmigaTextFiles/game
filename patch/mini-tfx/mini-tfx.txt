Mini-Tfx
========

Minimal installer for TFX.

Why ?

I just got the TFX cover disk from CU Amiga magazine, and was a
little miffed that I needed to install 17 Mb off a CD before
playing it.

CD's are there to be used, right ?  not just for archiving !

This hack allows you to run TFX from your hard drive and CD
combined.  You need approximately 500k of hard drive space
available. And a CD Drive, of course.

How ?

As some may have found out like me, TFX can be run from the CD
ROM drive. The only problem is, it kind of falls over because it
tries to write your pilot scores and other details to the CD.
Which duh, won't work. Luckily, using the assign command, we can
put part of TFX on the hard drive (about 500k) and leave the rest
on the CD. So long as you assign DID: to your hard drive first,
TFX looks here for your config and hiscores. TFX then looks for
all the 10Mb of data, can't find it on your hard drive, and so
instead looks for it on the CD. Clever eh ? all this from just
using the ADD feature of the assign command.

Hack bit
========

(sorry, I don't have time to learn how to put this in an
installer script)


Installation of TFX:
====================


1. make a directory on your hard disk for TFX.

eg:

makedir Games:TFX

2. Use Copy to put the following files to this directory:

copy cucd15:tfx/tfxsav#? games:tfx/

copy cucd15:tfx/tfx.cfg games:tfx/

3. Choose your TFX executable to place in the directory:
	
copy cucd15:tfx/TFX.FPU games:tfx/

or

copy cucd15:tfx/TFX.040 games:tfx/

or

copy cucd15:tfx/TFX games:tfx/


Thats it ! All you need to do now is put in your CU Amiga cover
CD and do the following assign command, before playing the game.


PLAYING THE GAME
================


1. use a smart ass(ign) command:

assign DID: games:TFX/
assign DID: CUCD15:TFX/ ADD

2. Set your Stack

stack 16384

3. Play the game:

cd games:TFX/
TFX.FPU

[or TFX.040 or TFX]

NOTE:
=====

The assign ADD feature may not work with weird Shell setups. It
didn't work on my C-Shell. Make sure you do these commands in a
standard amigaDOS shell, or by using the 'execute command' option
on the workbench pulldown menu.

If this still doesn't work, email me.


Happy TFX-ing, and remember,   FLY NAVY !!
