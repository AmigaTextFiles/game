DESCRIPTION

	Removes the manual protection from Faery Tale Adventure.  Works
	with HD patch by Peter McGavin (p.mcgavin@irl.cri.nz), but also
	works with the original and updated disk versions.

INSTALLATION

	For the HD patch, just install the game and copy this patch to
	the Faery Tale Adv. directory.  Double click on the icon and
	it will patch the executable "fmain".  You can now delete the
	patch from the directory.

	For the disk version I suggest you make a backup copy.  Once the
	back up is done, copy "fmain" to ram: and copy the patch to ram:
	run the patch and copy the patched executable "fmain" back to the
	disk.  You could also patch it right on the disk, but there was
	very little free space left on the disk.

	Just press "RETURN" on the protection screen.
