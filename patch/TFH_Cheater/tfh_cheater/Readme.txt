Tales from Heaven Cheater v1.0
------------------------------

Is this nessesary, i hear you think.
Well... we can have a big discussion about it, but in the end, there 
are always people, that not only like to play the game, and try to 
finish it, but that also have interest for the graphics or music only.

Some people can't make it to the second world, but do like to see some
different things from the same game, they do have spend some money for
it.
So i thought, it's a real simple job to do for me, so why not!

The Cheater cheats the following things:
Start in any world any level, with lots of Diamonds/Bombs, and Lives.
(Or watch the end sequence.. )

Problems with this cheat:
Don't get more then 99 Diamonds/Bombs, else the counter simply turns
to 00 again, and you have NONE!!!
(You start with 99 for Bombs/Lives/Diamonds.. don't get more!)

This cheat is : drinksomebeerorlimonadeandenjoytheshow-ware.
           or : sendmeaemailandyoumightgetamipopupprivatebeta-ware.

Have some fun!
