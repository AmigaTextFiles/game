DESCRIPTION

    This is a hard drive installer for the classic Factor 5 blaster
    "R-Type".

    Please read this document *thoroughly* before attempting to use
    the installer! There are some important points you may miss if
    you just dive right in, so much as it may be against your nature,
    I REALLY DO THINK YOU SHOULD READ THIS FILE. You have been warned!

INSTALLING THE GAME

    Read the "SPACE REQUIREMENTS" and "BUGS/CAVEATS" sections of
    this document NOW! They are important. Really.

    Workbench or CLI use.

    Installation is best handled by using the "Installer" program
    from Commodore, which should have been provided with your
    original system disks. It is also available from Aminet as:

    util/misc/Installer-43_3.lha
    (NB: the version number might have changed!)

    After installation is complete, you may delete the directory
    produced by extracting this archive ("RTInstall"). All files
    required for running the game will be found in the "R-Type"
    directory created during installation.


    FROM WORKBENCH:
    ---------------
    Extract all files in the archive to your system.
    They will be extracted to a drawer called "RTInstall"

    Open the newly created "RTInstall" drawer and double click on
    the "Install_R-Type" icon found there.

    Follow the instructions given to you by the Installer program:
    - all trainer and trainer-GUI related choices are *default* values
      only and may be changed after installation by editing the
      icon tooltypes of the "R-Type_HD" program or using the
      trainer GUI.

    - when asked to insert your game disk, do so and wait for the
      floppy activity light to go out before clicking the 'Proceed'
      button.

    The game will be installed to a directory you select on your
    hard drive. You will be alerted if installation fails for any
    reason.


    FROM CLI/SHELL:
    ---------------
    Extract all files in the archive to your system.
    They will be extracted to a directory called "RTInstall"

    CD to the "RTInstall" directory created when you extracted
    the acrhive.

    Type "Installer Install_R-Type" and press RETURN.

    Follow the instructions given to you by the Installer program:
    - when asked to select a "User Level" you *must* choose "Expert".

    - all trainer and trainer-GUI related choices you make will only
      apply if you start the Zeewolf_HD program from Workbench. If
      you start the trainer program from CLI (or from a script) then
      these options will be ignored.

    - all trainer and trainer-GUI related choices are *default* values
      only and may be changed after installation by editing the
      icon tooltypes of the "R-Type_HD" program or using the
      trainer GUI.

    - when asked to insert your game disk, do so and wait for the
      floppy activity light to go out before clicking the 'Proceed'
      button.

    The game will be installed to a directory you select on your
    hard drive. You will be alerted if installation fails for any
    reason.


CONFIGURING THE GAME

    The R-Type_HD program icon has a number of tooltypes which may be
    modified at any time to change the way in which it operates. Note that
    if you start the program from CLI then options saved in the program's
    tooltypes are ignored.


    "NOGUI"
    -------
    Specify this tooltype to disable the trainer GUI. If the GUI is
    disabled then the game will run with the default options specified
    in the other tooltypes.

    If the NOGUI tooltype is not present then the trainer GUI will appear.


    "INF_LIVES"
    "INVULNERABLE"
    --------------
    Specify any combination of these tooltypes to set the default state of
    the corresponding trainer. For example, if you specify the "INF_LIVES"
    tooltype then the infinite lives trainer will default to being active.

    If either of the above tooltypes are not present, then the corresponding
    trainer will default to being inactive.


PLAYING THE GAME

    Read the "BUGS/CAVEATS" section of this document NOW!

	FROM WORKBENCH
    ==============

    From Workbench, open the "R-Type" drawer created during installation
    and click on the "R-Type_HD" icon.


    IF YOU OPTED TO USE THE TRAINER MENU
    ------------------------------------
    Read this if you did not specify "NOGUI" in the icon tooltypes.

    The trainer window will open allowing you to select the trainers you wish
    to use while playing the game. Initially both trainers are set to the
    default values specified in the program tooltypes.

    To activate a trainer, e.g.: Infinite lives, you must click on the
    appropriate gadget. A checkmark (tick) will appear in the box beside
    any activated trainer; if the box is empty then the trainer is inactive.

    When you have selected the trainers you want, click the "Play" gadget in
    the lower left of the window. The game will now load and run if possible.

    If you started R-Type by mistake, or have changed your mind and do
    not want to play the game right now then click the "Cancel" gadget
    in the lower right of the window..


    IF YOU OPTED TO DISABLE THE TRAINER MENU
    --------------------------------------
    Read this if you did specify "NOGUI" in the icon tooltypes.

    The game will load and run if possible. No trainer window will appear.
    Active trainers are determined from the default values as specified by
    the other tooltypes of the R-Type_HD program.


	FROM CLI/SHELL
    ==============

	Change Directory to the directory you have R-Type installed in.
	To start the trainer, type "R-Type_HD" followed by the options you
    wish to activate. Note that if you start the trainer from CLI then
    options saved in the program's tooltypes are ignored.

    "NOGUI"
    "INF_LIVES"
    "INVULNERABLE"
    --------------
	These command line options correspond to the tooltypes described in
    the previous section.

    For example:

    R-Type_HD NOGUI INF_LIVES

    would start R-Type and give the player infinite lives.
    No trainer GUI would appear.


SPACE REQUIREMENTS

    Requires approximately 900K of free space on your hard drive.
    Please do not attempt installation if you have less than this
    amount free on the partition you intend to install R-Type
    on.

    The "R-Type.dat" file (the big one, about 880K) may be crunched
    using a packer/patch combination that modifies the dos.library
    "Open" and "Read" functions eg: XData or PPData. This should save
    you a few hundred Kb of hard disk space if you need it. You will
    still require approximately 900K of hard drive space to do the
    installation however.

    The game disk is cached in memory during play, so you will
    require approximately 1.5Mb of free RAM in order to play the
    game. If this amount of memory is not available the loader
    will report the error and quit.

    Due to the stringent memory requirements, owners of 2Mb machines
    may be unable to run the game while Workbench is loaded.

    If, for whatever reason, the loader stops with a "could not
    allocate xyz" error, then close down some applications or
    commodities to free memory and try again. If this does not
    work then reboot and try running the game again from a minimal
    system (boot with no startup-sequence).


BUGS/CAVEATS

    RTInstall is provided "as is" and is used at your own risk.

    The author is not liable for any loss or damage caused by the
    use or misuse of this program. It almost certainly *wont* destroy
    your Amiga, but if it does (or does anything else untoward) then
    I cannot be held responsible.

    When running the installer it is advisable to disable any virus
    checking software you may have running. The original game disk
    uses a non-standard bootblock which will most likely cause your
    virus checker to complain and this could interefere with the
    installation process. It is not necessary to disable such programs
    before playing the game once it is installed.

    The installer is written in as system friendly a way as possible,
    but the game is not. Owners of heavily expanded Amigas may have
    problems running the game, but this is not the fault of RTInstall
    and there is little I can do about it :( Try the usual system
    degrading tricks if you run into difficulties, or get in touch
    and Ill try to sort you out.

    Multitasking is disabled while the game is running and it is not
    possible to return to Workbench (or whatever) after you have
    finished playing. A system reboot is necessary. Sorry, but theres
    nothing I can do about it - its the way the game was written.

    The original R-Type did not run on Amigas with any processor
    other than a plain 68000. However, during installation the game
    is automatically patched to be compatible with later CPUs.


TESTING INFORMATION

    Created on A1200/68030+68882-40Mhz/8Mb/KS39.106, but should run on
    any Amiga with enough RAM.

    I have also tested the patched version on a vanilla 2Mb A1200.

    If you have a problem running RTInstall then I WANT TO KNOW! Please,
    feel free to get in touch. I *like* getting email :)
