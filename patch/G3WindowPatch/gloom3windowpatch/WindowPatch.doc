 Gloom 3 Window Patch by Software Failure/Airsoft 98
 ===================================================

 With this patch, you`re allowed to play Gloom 3 in
 window on an standard A1200 or A4000 without using
 CyberGraphX or any gfx board. 

 In little window it runs very good on Blizzard 1230IV.
 But don`t try it with higher resolutions, because it`s
 very lame then.


 REQUIREMENTS:

 - Gloom 3 (installed on hd)

 Please note: This is only a quick adaption of my Gloom Deluxe
 Window patch. The engines of Gloom Deluxe & Gloom 3 are nearly
 100% the same. Have fun.

 TO DO:

 - Speed up blitter operations for faster window playing
   
 This prog is e-mail or cardware. If you use it, you must send me an e-mail or
 postcard. I collect postcards so it would be very nice from you, sending me
 one. If I get postcards, I know that my Cheat/Trainer work is used. So I try
 to write other cheating progs. See my adress by clicking on the "about" button
 on the GUI.
