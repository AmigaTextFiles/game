Short:    Quake PPC-Patch was illegal
Replaces: game/patch/QuakePPC.lha

The Quake ppc-patch uploaded to aminet was not by ClickBOOM,
but anonymous coder. It is based on stolen source code, and
is thus illegal. It is by no means "official" as the .readme
claimed.

P.S. It wasn't even the latest version.. ;)
