;First you need to start wihtout Startup-sequence
;Then in the Cli Windows, type "LoadWB"
;Then you can double-click on the icon from that file
;Work fine at home, but i don't know for other cgf
;I think you have more work if you own a GFX.
;But it's enough for a standart A1200 on a PAL screen (or NTSC).
;
;Thanx to Marble eyes for that fantatic game
;Specialy to Martin Halberg for his help and patience !
