If you like i understand you, please write me in French or in English
And sorry for my poor english, but i am french ;)

This is a small script i do for solving my problem with the Audio Track
with GeneticSpecies

First don't use CD.device.

The things i did, and it's working, is first install another device
and also another filling system for the CD ROM

You can use Atapi.device, but also other device, just try them

For the FileSystem, i use Amicdfs2.40, it's free, and it's working

When you think that all your system is ok, then

- First you need to start without Startup-sequence (both mousebutton on boot)
- Then in the Cli Window, type "LoadWB" (you can close that window , Endcli)
  Some Requester can appears like problem with datatype or whatever,
just ignore them (click on ok or cancel, nevermind)
- Then you can double-click on the icon from that file
 Work fine at home, but i don't know for other cgf
 I think you have more work if you own a GFX.
 But it's enough for a standart A1200 on a PAL screen (or NTSC).

And i will be not responsible for anydamage, bla bla bla bla bla ...

run dh0:c/setpatch       ;this for the 680x0 and AGA screen (and some more)
Mount CD0:               ;This is for your .... CD ROM drive !!!! yeah ! 
;Wait 10                 ;May be you need wait the CD ROM mount if doesn't work adjust that value
run execute Engine       ;And then jump to the standart script

Thanx a lot to marble eyes for that fantastic game !
Specialy to Martin Halberg for his help and his patience !
