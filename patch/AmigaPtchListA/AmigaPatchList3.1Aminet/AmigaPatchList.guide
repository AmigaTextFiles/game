@{jleft}@{b}IMPORTANT@{ub}: If you are concerned about the legality of this document, read
about @{"copyright issues and the Aminet situation" link CopyrightIssues}.@{par}

This is not the full version of the Amiga Patch List. This version is
currently @{b}NOT@{ub} available from Aminet sites, due to a (in my opinion) bizarre
censorship policy. This is a cut-down Aminet version. See below for where to
obtain the full version. Patches for the following games have been removed in
this cut-down version:
@{lindent 4}@{pari -2}@{par}@{b}·@{ub} Civilization@{par}
@{b}·@{ub} Formula One Grand Prix@{par}
@{b}·@{ub} Railroad Tycoon@{par}
@{b}·@{ub} Silent Service II@{pard}@{line}

This document is a list of various patches for commercial Amiga software, to
remove manual- and disk-based copy-protection. Of course, you should only
alter a backup copy, and the altered copy is subject to the same distribution
restrictions as the original program. Please don't use information in this
file to distribute unauthorised copies of the games mentioned here. This
document is for use by those who wish to back up their original software, or
remove protection from the same (which can be @{i}very@{ui} annoying - for example the
protection in Frontier).@{par}

This document is freely distributable. Paul David Doherty has made a "front
end" web page for the Amiga Patch List at the following URL:@{code}
@{jcenter}http://amipatch.home.pages.de/@{par}@{jleft}@{body}
You can also download the latest version of the Patch List from my web page
at:@{code}
@{jcenter}http://visitweb.com/mark@{par}@{jleft}@{body}

To apply these patches, I recommend that you use the 'Hex' file editor by
Nicola Salmoria (available on Fish disk #517 and on Aminet). In each case the
first byte of a file is at offset 0, and all figures apart from file lengths
are in hexadecimal. If you're low on memory, you may have to use a
sector-based file editor like NewZAP instead. To make a backup copy of games
which have on-disk protection, use a copier which will not stop at an error,
like SuperDuper. Remember, you should @{b}ALWAYS@{ub} write protect your
original disks. @{b}NEVER@{ub} modify them.@{par}

I use the 'CRC' program to calculate file checksums, before and after
patching. Run CRC on your initial and final executables to verify their
correctness. The CRC program is included in this distribution, and is also
distributed with Zoom 5.4 by Olaf Barthel; see this for more information on
CRC.@{par}

If you have problems with any patches given here, please let @{"me" link AboutTheAuthor} know. If
you've developed patches for any programs not included, please send them to
me, preferably in a similar format to the ones below. Remember to give the
version number if you know it. Future growth of this list depends on you! I
don't own every original game in the world...@{par}

This document uses some @{amigaguide} V40 features. If you have an earlier
version, some things may not appear correctly.@{par}

@node AboutInfocomPatches "About Infocom Patches"

@smartwrap

@{u}About Infocom Patches@{uu}@{par}

Infocom story files contain a checksum used when you type '$verify' to check
the correctness of the story file. Any changes to the story file, like removal
of copy-protection, will necessitate a change to the checksum in order for
'$verify' to continue to work correctly.@{par}

When you save a game in progress, the first part of the story file is included
in the save file; this includes the story file checksum. So if you load a
saved game, @{i}saved when playing from an original story file@{ui}, when playing with
a patched story file, there may be a problem with the '$verify' command due
to the differing checksums. The interpreter may report a bad story file when
in fact the story file is intact. Not every interpreter does this; Infocom's
own does, but ZIP 2.0 does not.@{par}

These patches were made possible by Mark Howell's TxD Infocom data file
disassembler, Paul David Doherty's DebugTool 1.11, and Graham Nelson's Z-Code
specification document. If you're interested in Infocom and interactive fiction
in general, you should check out the FTP site ftp.gmd.de, in the directory
/if-archive.

@{u}About LockPick@{uu}@{par}

LockPick 2.0 is a parameter-based disk copier which contains a very large
number of parameters (504!). Some of the patches in this list came from
LockPick. LockPick also allows some disks which use a non-DOS format to be
backed up, something which isn't possible for a simple patch. You can download
LockPick from the author's home page at the following URL:@{code}

@smartwrap

@{u}Copyright Issues@{uu}@{par}

@{b}This section contains important information. Please read it carefully@{ub}.@{par}

Publication of the information contained in this document does not in itself
infringe any copyrights. The simple fact is that @{i}THE AMIGA PATCH LIST IS
PERFECTLY LEGAL@{ui}. So any decision not to publish, for example on Aminet FTP
sites, amounts to censorship.@{par}

For detailed information on the legal situation in the United States
(relevant since the main Aminet site is in the USA), see@{code}
@{jcenter}http://web.idirect.com/~neverloc/legalcpy.html@{par}@{jleft}@{body}
This page is maintained by a Canadian company called Copyware Inc., which
sells programs to enable backups to be made of commercial copy-protected PC
software.@{par}

To quote Paul David Doherty:
@{lindent 4}@{pari -2}@{par}@{b}·@{ub} patches that only work if you own an original game are not in the
same league as installers that only work with pirated games;@{par}
@{b}·@{ub} crackers aren't interested in patches for original software
because they prefer to crack those games themselves;@{par}
@{b}·@{ub} pirates aren't interested in patches for original commercial software
because they don't @{b}have@{ub} original protected software in the first
place;@{par}
@{b}·@{ub} the only beneficiary of such patches is the rightful owner of commercial
software who wants to protect the valuable original disks from damage or
wants to make the games HD installable.@{pard}@{line}

I will add another couple of points:
@{lindent 4}@{pari -2}@{par}@{b}·@{ub} In the case of games which have manual-based
copy-protection, a patch to allow use without referring to the manual can
greatly enhance game-play. Some games repeatedly ask for a word from the
manual to be entered during the game. This is extremely annoying, and if you
play the game a lot, causes the manual to become "dog-eared" quickly. If you
regularly play many such games, you have to have many game manuals lying
around, cluttering up your room and making it more likely that some will get
lost or damaged.@{par}
@{b}·@{ub} If the owner of an original copy of a game with manual protection is
intent on piracy, the existence of otherwise of a patch in this list will not
stop them -- they will just photocopy the relevant section in the manual.@{pard}@{line}

In any case, there are already programs on Aminet which install (copy-protected)
games to hard disk -- see the many hard disk installers in game/patch. These
remove the copy-protection anyway. So there is @{b}no justification@{ub} for the
Aminet administrators refusing to accept this file.@{par}

The current situation is that the full version of the Amiga Patch List is not
being accepted by the Aminet administrators. I received the following email
from Urban Mueller on 9-Oct-97:@{par}

Sorry about the long delay. Altho I think the file is legal as it is,
I've decided to remove it until these are patches are gone. However
that wasn't an easy decision, I tend to allow as much as possible.

  -Urban

-------- message ends --------

@{body}What this means is that perfectly legal files can be removed from Aminet
simply because someone disapproves for whatever reason of the archive
contents. I don't believe this is an acceptable situation. If you agree, I
suggest that you voice your concerns to the Aminet administrators, Urban
Müller (umueller@wuarchive.wustl.edu) and Mattias Scheler
(mscheler@aminet.org). Aminet should accept @{b}ALL@{ub} legal Amiga-related
files.@{par}

Contrary to what Peter Dalling says in the above quoted message, Guildhall
Leisure have @{i}not@{ui} re-released either Gunship or Silent Service. They
have re-released Gunship 2000 and Silent Service II.@{par}

Sadly, considering the current state of the Amiga commercial software market,
the (very weak) arguments against a list like this are in practice not
relevant anyway. Almost all of the programs covered are available new any
more, so revenue loss is not an issue. The points given above detail why the
Patch List is unlikely to contribute to software piracy. What @{i}is@{ui} an issue
however, is the fact that in almost every case @{b}it is impossible to replace
your original disks@{ub} if something nasty happens to them. Games are usually
de-listed a short while after release, and the software company may cease
trading.@{par}

@node VersionHistory "Version History"

@{u}Version History@{uu}

1.0	Initial release (not widely distributed).

1.1	Various minor changes, and the following new patches:
		AMFV release 79
		Frontier 'Version to Gametek (Release 4) 1.05'
		Sorcerer releases 13, 18
		Stationfall release 107
		Thunderboy

1.2	More minor changes, and the following new patches:
		Breach 1.02e
		Kult
		Mindfighter
		Ogre 1.06
		The Settlers
	Corrected version of Frontier to 1.05 in patch list.
	Added information to (hopefully) allow any version of Frontier to be
	patched.

1.3	More minor changes, and the following new patches:
		Budokan
		Emerald Mine (three versions)
		Epic 3.17
		Extensor
		Gods 1.00
		MovieSetter 1.0P
		Starglider
	Bug fix! Added another word to alter for 'The Settlers' patch. The
	old patch in v1.2 of this list was incomplete, and meant that the
	machine would crash after a while.

1.4	More minor changes, and the following new patches:
		Champions of Krynn 1.0
		Demon's Tomb - The Awakening 1.00
		DragonStrike 1.0

	sequence as in the original versions.
	Added note for Infocom patches.
	Changed name to Amiga Patch List; there aren't only games any more.
	The following new patches added:
		Barbarian - The Ultimate Warrior UK PAL Version 24/03/88

	Many thanks to Tue Brisson for all the new patches in this version
	and the bug report!

2.2	Updated information on the XFD package.
	Vastly simplified the Zool 2 AGA patch - XFD now supports the
	cruncher used. As a side effect, the CRC values have changed.
	The following new patch added:
		Sorcerer release 6

2.3	The following new patches added (all except North & South

Comments:	This patch removes the Rob Northen on-disk copy-protection.
		Due to a certain lameness on the part of the person who put
		the disk together, the game does not work on anything other
		than a 68000. [The header for a normal load file is executed,
		not skipped over.] To fix this, use your disk editor to
		change the 2 bytes at block 100 (track 4, sector 1, head 1),
		offset 0 (starting with $000003F3) to hex 601E. The game will
		work on a plain A1200 by doing this, but you may need to use
		Kickstart 1.2 or 1.3 and turn the cache off.

@node BrianTheLionAGA "Brian the Lion AGA (Reflections/Psygnosis) A1200 Computer Combat version"

"@{u}Brian the Lion AGA@{uu}" (Reflections/Psygnosis) A1200 Computer Combat version

This patch is quite involved. Perform the following steps carefully.

@{b}Stage 1@{ub}
Using a utility such as TrackDOS, create disk images (901120 bytes long) of
disks 2 and 3. If you've installed Brian the Lion on your hard disk, you can
use the files 'DISK2.BTL' and 'DISK3.BTL' respectively.


@{b}Stage 2@{ub}
Load the @{i}disk 2@{ui} image file into Hex.

Click in the Start gadget and enter '400'. Press Return. The start of the
file should now read 'PP20'.

Click in the End gadget, erase the number 'C03FF' and enter 'DF7'. Press
Return.

Save the file as 'RAM:tempfile.pp'


@{b}Stage 3@{ub}
Using a utility such as PowerPacker, DLD, xfdDecrunch or any program which
can decrunch PowerPacker data files, decrunch the file 'RAM:tempfile.pp' to
'RAM:tempfile'.

Now make the following change to the file 'RAM:tempfile'.

	File length:	13040

		@{u}Offset		Change From	Change To@{uu}
		$000001		FA		75

	Original CRC  Checksum = $A20F4E6E
	Original WRAP Checksum = $F0C871C6

	Final CRC  Checksum = $5730D78A
	Final WRAP Checksum = $F14D71C6

Now use PowerPacker (I have version 4.0a - you may need this version too) to
crunch the 'RAM:tempfile' file with 'Best' efficiency. Save it as
'RAM:tempfile.pp'. This should be 3576 bytes long.


@{b}Stage 4@{ub}
Load the @{i}disk 2@{ui} image file into Hex.

Move to offset $400. Choose 'Insert File...' from the Project menu, and
select 'RAM:tempfile.pp'.

Move to offset $1BC00. Choose 'Insert File...' from the Project menu, and
select 'RAM:tempfile.pp'.

Save the file back to disk.

Load the @{i}disk 3@{ui} image file into Hex.

Move to offset $18C00. Choose 'Insert File...' from the Project menu, and
select 'RAM:tempfile.pp'.

Save the file back to disk.


@{b}Stage 5@{ub}
If you were altering your 'DISK2.BTL' and 'DISK3.BTL' files, you can now play
your deprotected Brian the Lion from hard disk. If not, use TrackDOS to write
the modified disk image files to your copies of disks 2 and 3.

This is a two disk compilation of Dizzy games. Disk 1 contains Dizzy Panic
and Spellbound Dizzy; disk 2 contains Bubble Dizzy, Prince of the Yolkfolk
and Kwiksnax. The file 'VC' needs to be patched on both disks. The method
used is similar to that for the 'CJ in the USA' patch given elsewhere.

"@{u}Emerald Mine@{uu}" (Kingsoft)

There are at least four versions of the Emerald Mine game engine around. The
earliest is 28152 bytes long and seems to be unprotected. The time and score
appear in the top-left corner of the screen during play. I give patches here
for the other three versions, which I have dubbed 'Release 2', 'Release 3'
and 'Release 4'. Release 3 has some minor improvements and bug fixes, like
being slightly more system-legal during startup, and can run on NTSC
machines. Also, the data files used by release 3 are encrypted, making it
harder to cheat by editing the 'nam' file. Release 4 is broadly similar.

		version, Kingsoft?

"@{u}Extensor@{uu}" (Golden Games/Smash 16)

Firstly, remove the 'Stack 6000' line from the s/startup-sequence file on the
Extensor disk; this command is actually part of the copy-protection.
	
Then alter the following file:

	File to alter:	"Extensor" on disk "Extensor"

	Final CRC  Checksum = $9A6BFCBA
	Final WRAP Checksum = $AA3FF111

Comments:	This patch removes the on-disk copy-protection. The changes
		to the 'Extensor' file above simply replace the string
		'KEV.library' with 'dos.library'. The 'Stack' program patches
		Exec OpenLibrary() to do this if the copy-protection check
		passed. However, the loader program itself is very badly
		coded. It uses A5 instead of A6 when calling the Exec
		library; hence it doesn't work under Kickstarts later than
		1.3. Also, the game uses memory without allocating it first.

According to Tue Brisson:
Depending on the version, "EOBII" may or may not be crunched. The KIXX budget
version is, and as far as I know it can't easily be decrunched. If you have a
crunched version, try to decrunch it and save it over the original file
before doing alterations. If the game boots without crashing, it has probably
decrunched correctly and you can apply the patch. (Remember that on the KIXX
version you will need to delete the file XLAN and remove it from the startup-
sequence in order to fit the decrunched file onto the disk.) If it crashes,
then it's too bad! At this point I don't know how to decrunch the KIXX
version.
(I could not decrunch the KIXX version properly. I tried several different
unpackers; they all gave slightly different output but all of the decrunched
files crashed. The cruncher was reported as PowerPacker4.0 Overlayed, but
even PowerPacker could not decrunch correctly, neither could it repack the
file.)

You need to unpack the file using xfdDecrunch before applying the patch. If
playing from hard disk, simply copy the altered file to your "HiredGuns"
drawer, replacing the old file. Then change the UNPACK tooltype in the icon
from YES to NO.

If playing from floppy disks, you can pack the file as a data file if you
have the ProPack cruncher (there is unlikely to be enough free space for the
unpacked file). Else you could try packing with PowerPacker/Imploder/
CrunchMania (as executable). However, this is unlikely to work.

@node ManiacMansion "Maniac Mansion (Lucasfilm Games)"

"@{u}Maniac Mansion@{uu}" (Lucasfilm Games)

The original full-price release of Maniac Mansion has copy-protection, where
you need to enter the correct code to open the security door. The patch in
LockPick 2.0 is badly bugged! With the LockPick patch, you are unable to save
games.

Maniac Mansion was later re-released on the Kixx XL budget label. It seems
that someone at Kixx applied the LockPick patch, so that they wouldn't have
to supply a code wheel (or whatever) with the budget release. So you can't
save games with the Kixx XL version!

Consequently, I give two patches here. The first is the bugged LockPick/Kixx
XL patch. If you have the original release, I don't recommend you apply this.

The second, working, patch requires a small program to be run before you
start the game. This program is badly coded. It writes a small piece of code
to address $300, and exits without flushing the cache. The altered Maniac
Mansion executable calls this code. I may re-write this in future, so that a
separate program is not required.

If you have the Kixx XL version and want to apply the working patch, you must
first un-patch the executable, using the information for the LockPick patch
below, but in reverse.

For the working patch, you also need to run the small program 'deprotect'
before 'Maniac' is run. Copy the 'deprotect' file to "Maniac Disk 1" and edit
the startup-sequence so 'deprotect' is run. If you are playing from hard
disk, you could create an IconX script to run 'deprotect' before the main
program. 'Deprotect' can be found in the ManiacMansion directory.

Comments:	For the bugged LockPick/Kixx XL patch, enter any code to open
		the security door. For the working patch, you will always be
		asked to click 4 times on the top left symbol.

"@{u}North & South@{uu}" (Infogrames)

There are at least two versions of North & South. The one that I own is a PAL
version - it contains code to check if you are running a PAL machine; if not
the game will hang. However, the patch for the other version is very likely
to work too.

	You need to use a disk editor for this patch, such as DiskX or the
	EditorTool in ProjectD 2.0.
	
		Locate block 49 (track 2, sector 5, head 0). Make one of the
		following changes, depending on which version you have.
		
	@{b}PAL version@{ub}
		@{u}Offset in block	Change From	Change To@{uu}
		$000020		4EBA 75F0	4E71 4E71

	@{b}Other version@{ub}
		@{u}Offset in block	Change From	Change To@{uu}
		$00000E		4EBA 7546	4E71 4E71

The Populous II executable is compressed. We need to decompress it before
applying the patch; this is done using xfdDecrunch. You will need a directory
with at least 300K free space; I'll call this TEMP:. From a CLI/Shell window,
type:
	xfdDecrunch "POPULOUS II:populous.ii" TEMP:

Now apply the patch to the TEMP:populous.ii file.

@node PowerMonger "PowerMonger (Bullfrog Productions/Electronic Arts)"

"@{u}PowerMonger@{uu}" (Bullfrog Productions/Electronic Arts)

This patch is quite involved. We need to extract some compressed code from
the disk, and from this recreate a file which xfdDecrunch can unpack. We can
then patch the code, and re-crunch it. Perform the following steps carefully.

@{b}Stage 1@{ub}
Using a utility such as TrackDOS, create a disk image file (901120 bytes
long) of the PowerMonger disk.


@{b}Stage 2@{ub}
Load the disk image file into Hex.

Click in the Start gadget and enter '675F4'. Press Return. The first 12 bytes
of the file should now read '00000000 00000000 0000FF88' in hex.

Change these 12 bytes to read '0000FF80 0001B0D4 6D93928C'.

Click in the End gadget, erase the number '74A0B' and enter 'FF8B'. Press
Return.

Save the file as 'RAM:tempfile.bytekillerdata'

There are two small files in the PowerMonger directory of this distribution.
Enter the following CLI command (as a single line, of course):
'Join PowerMonger/Head RAM:tempfile.bytekillerdata PowerMonger/Tail AS
RAM:tempfile.bytekillerexe'


@{b}Stage 3@{ub}
Using a utility such as xfdDecrunch, decrunch the file
'RAM:tempfile.bytekillerexe' to 'RAM:tempfile'.

Now make the following changes to the file 'RAM:tempfile'.

	File length:	110804

		@{u}Offset		Change From	Change To@{uu}
		$00AC9C		9070		303C
		$00AC9E		10		00

	Original CRC  Checksum = $D3FAF504
	Original WRAP Checksum = $8D4B69EF

	Final CRC  Checksum = $4EE6FBB7
	Final WRAP Checksum = $ED7F79EF

We can now use the ByteKiller 1.3 cruncher, included in the ByteKiller
directory of this distribution, to compress the patched file, ready for
writing back to the PowerMonger disk.

Enter the following CLI command: 'ByteKiller/ByteKiller.noforbid'
[This is a patched version of ByteKiller 1.3, which doesn't disable multi-
tasking during crunching, or flash the screen.]

You should now see the following text in the CLI window:
	@{i}BYTEKILLER V 1.3 EXTENDED VERS.
	ADAPTED BY BLIZZARD / J.J. : 18.11.87@{ui}

	Allocate work space (KBbyte) :

Enter '200' and press Return. Type 'RAM:tempfile' when the following appears:
	Filename to load (exit to leave, -(command) to execute CLI command.)
	Filename/Command :

You should now see the following text:
	original length : $0001b0d4
	offset (max $0800) :$

Enter '0800' for the offset. The program will now begin crunching the data.
If you have a slow Amiga, this may take some time. When done, you will see
the following:
	packed length   : $0000ff8c

	create executeable file or data file ? (e/d):

Enter 'd', to create a data file, and type 'RAM:tempfile.bytekillerdata' when
the following text appears:
	save Filename (exit to leave, -(command) to execute CLI command.)
	Filename/Command :


@{b}Stage 4@{ub}
Now we have compressed the de-protected code, we need to replace the original
data in the disk image file with this.

Load the disk image file into Hex.

Move to offset $675F4. Choose 'Insert File...' from the Project menu, and
select 'RAM:tempfile.bytekillerdata'.

The 12 bytes at the cursor should now read '0000FF80 0001B0D4 1F41F3FB' in
hex. Change them to read '00000000 00000000 0000FF88'.

Move to offset $77580. Change the 4 bytes here from '6D93928C' to '1F41F3FB'.

Save the file back to disk.


@{b}Stage 5@{ub}
Use TrackDOS to write the modified image file to your copy of PowerMonger. If
everything has gone to plan, you should now be able to play the deprotected
game.

		be asked to enter a number from the manual.

	not stop at an error.

	You need to use a disk editor for this patch, such as DiskX or the
	EditorTool in ProjectD 2.0. Make the following changes to your copy
	of disk 1.

		Locate block 0 (track 0, sector 0, head 0).

		@{u}Offset in block	Change From		Change To@{uu}
		$00003C		4DF9 00DF F000		6100 012A 4E71

	At offset $000168 in block 0, replace the zero bytes with the
	following:

		@{u}Offset in block	Change To@{uu}
		$000168		48E7 FFFE 41FA 001C 43F9 001F E000 7E2B
		$000178		12D8 51CF FFFC 4CDF 7FFF 4DF9 00DF F000
		$000188		4E75 23FC 001F E010 0007 A22C 4FEF 0052
		$000198		4E75 4EB9 0007 F1C2 23FC 26BC 42ED 0001
		$0001A8		30E0 23FC 69C4 4E75 0001 30E4 4E75

	Note: You need to correct the DOS block checksum here (as it is the
	bootblock). DiskX does this automatically.

		Locate block 105 (track 4, sector 6, head 1).

		@{u}Offset in block	Change From		Change To@{uu}
		$000028		4FEF 0052 4E75		4EF9 001F E000

	Do not correct the DOS block checksum for this block.

Comments:	This patch removes the Rob Northen on-disk copy-protection.

Comments:	This removes the Infotater copy-protection. The current code
		will always be @{i}bloodworm@{ui}, and the corresponding colour
		sequence is of course @{i}white@{ui}, @{i}gray@{ui}, @{i}black@{ui}, @{i}red@{ui}, @{i}black@{ui}.
		There is one small proviso here. The current code is decided
		very early on in the game. If you have saved a game from the
		original version @{i}before@{ui} the trunk is opened, then even if you
		load this into the deprotected version, the code remains the
		same. This shouldn't be a major problem, as the Guild Hall
		section is so small.
		If you have Amiga LTOI I, the Sorcerer data file is in the
		Sorcerer directory on disk 1. Releases 6, 15 and 18 were not
		(as far as I know) available on the Amiga; release 15 was
		included in PC LTOI I, for example. To use these versions
		with Infocom's Amiga interpreter, you need to pad the file
		length to a multiple of 512 bytes.

Comments:	About half way through the game, Belboz asks you to prove
		that you are truly yourself, by asking you one of six
		questions. You do not find out whether you answered correctly
		until later in the game. This patch makes Belboz always ask
		the same question: "Which mage had the motto, 'The hardest
		trick is making it look easy.'?". The answer is of course
		@{i}Barsap@{ui}.

Comments:	Instead of entering the number corresponding to the current

		at the top of the interpreter window).
		If you have Amiga LTOI I, you will find the Stationfall data
		file in the Stationfall directory on disk 3.
		Interestingly, the game doesn't store all the numbers on form
		QX-17-T. It derives the course heading you should enter from
		the current GST as follows (round down to the nearest integer
		at each stage):
			   Heading = ( (GST÷50 - 132)^2 )÷4 + 103
		The above patch simply changes the calculation to:
			   Heading = GST.

	File to alter:	"VC" on disk "SEYMOUR - 23.7.92"
	File length:	8372

	The alterations needed here are quite involved. I will assume that
	you are using the 'Hex' file editor. You will also need FImp from the
	Imploder 4.0 distribution.

	Load the VC file into Hex.
	Click in the Start string gadget and enter the value 1E8.
	The start of the file should read 'CHFI'. Change this to 'IMP!'.
	Click in the End string gadget and change 1ECB to 1EC7.
	Save the file as 'RAM:VCmain.im'
	From a CLI/Shell window enter the command 'FImp RAM:VCmain'. The file
		RAM:VCmain should be 23544 bytes long.
	Load the file 'RAM:VCmain' into Hex. Make the following changes:

		@{u}Offset		Change From	Change To@{uu}
		$000056		6100 0C08	4E71 4E71
		$000682		67		60

	Save the modified file back as 'RAM:VCmain'.
	From a CLI/Shell window enter the command 'FImp RAM:VCmain'. The file
		RAM:VCmain.im should be 7880 bytes long.
	Load the VC file from your (copy of the) Super Seymour Saves the
		Planet disk.
	Move to offset $1E8. Select 'Insert File...' from the Project menu,
		and select the file 'RAM:VCmain.im'.
	Still at offset $1E8, change the 'IMP!' string to 'CHFI'.
	Save the file as 'VC' on your Super Seymour Saves the Planet disk.

	Original CRC  Checksum for VC file = $CE90F0BF
	Original WRAP Checksum for VC file = $C2AA3DFD

	Final CRC  Checksum for VC file = $C08E471E

@node Zool2AGA "Zool 2 AGA (Gremlin Graphics) A1200 Computer Combat version"

"@{u}Zool 2 AGA@{uu}" (Gremlin Graphics) A1200 Computer Combat version

The file that needs to be patched here ('z2' on disk 'z2d1') is packed with a
Rob Northen cruncher. In order to be able to apply the patch, we need to
unpack the file, patch this, and repack the resulting file in order to fit it
back onto the disk.

@{b}NOTE:@{ub} You will need a recent version of the XFD package to unpack the z2
file. Version 1.13 is definitely sufficient. From a CLI/Shell window, type:

'xfdDecrunch z2d1:z2 RAM:z2.unpacked'

(Replace RAM: with some other directory with sufficient space if necessary.)
Now we have to remove the protection from the 'z2.unpacked' file.

	File to alter:	"RAM:z2.unpacked"
	File length:	409372

		@{u}Offset		Change From	Change To@{uu}

	Original WRAP Checksum = $9DCE8E6D

	Final CRC  Checksum = $BB3A3376
	Final WRAP Checksum = $83558E6D

Now use Imploder to compress the patched z2.unpacked file. Any efficiency
above 2 will do; ensure that Library mode is off. Save the compressed file to
'z2d1:z2', replacing the original z2 file.

If all went well, you should now be able to play your deprotected copy of
Zool 2 AGA.
