                             (by Lord Blitter)

         Official Dealer    : BAMIGA SECTOR ONE
         Release date       : January, 2th 1988.

Changes made: All fixed branches are now relatives (faster - shorter - easier
to work with). A bug in the compression was fixed, thanks to Twilight for 
letting us know it !

Changes made: A real cool guy from THE BLIZZARD wrote a great user
interface for your favorite cruncher.

Note to J.J. : please send your address again because we lost it and
we would like you to be the first to test the next version (2.0)
of the Byte Killer.


A FEW NOTES FROM J.J.
---------------------

WELL THE CRUNCH AND DECRUNCH ROUTINES ARE THE SAME,
BUT I WROTE A PROGRAMM AROUND WHICH ALLOWS TO WORK WITH THE CRUNCHER,
WITHOUT THE SEKA. ALSO THIS PROGRAMM IS ABLE TO CREATE A FILE ,
WHICH CONTAINS ALL THE DECRUNCHER AND THE CRUNCHED DATA IN ONE FILE
AND WHICH IS STARTABLE FROM CLI.
(I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST CRUNCHER, WHICH ALLOWS THIS)

HOW TO HANDLE:

TYPE 'BKiller' FROM CLI
THE PRG ASKS NOW FOR MEMORY TO BE ALLOCATED FROM THE SYSTEM
TYPE IN A VALUE OF 1 - 999
IF MEMORY ALLOCATION FAILS, THE CRUNCHER WILL RESTART

NOW YOU CAN TYPE THE FILENAME OF THE PRG YOU WANT TO CRUNCH
EXEPTS:
'EXIT' WILL EXIT THE CRUNCHER
'-' FOLLOWED BY A CLI COMMAND WILL EXECUTE THE COMMAND
THE COMMAND HAD TO BE IN THE CURRENT DIR OR IN THE C DIR

THE PRG NOW TRIES TO LOAD THE FILE
IF THE FILE IS NOT FOUND, OR THE FILE IS LONGER THAN THE ALLOCATED BUFFER
THE PRG WILL ASK FOR ANNOTHER FILENAME

AFTER YOU GET THE LENGTH OF THE UNPACKED FILE,
YOU HAVE TO TYPE IN A VALUE (crunch factor) OF MAX $1000 (SEE LOWER FOR THE
 MEANING OF THE VALUE)

WHILE THE CRUNCHER WORKS THE SCREEN FLASHES FROM TIME TO TIME

AFTER CRUNCHING YOU GET THE LENGTH OF THE CRUNCHED FILE AND THE CHOICE,
BETWEEN SAVING A EXECUTEABLE FILE (TO RUN FROM CLI) OR A DATA FILE (TO USE
IN YOUR OWN PROGRAMMS)

IF YOU CHOOSE THE EXECUTEABLE FILE,THE CRUNCHER NOW ASKS FOR THE ADRESS,
WHERE THE PROGRAMM SHOULD STAND AFTER DECRUNCHING.

NOW THE JUMP IN ADDRESS IS ASKED

AFTER YOU HAVE ENTERED THE SAVE FILENAME , THE CRUNCHER FREES MEMORY AND
EXITS TO CLI

IF YOU HAVE SAVED ONLY DATA, YOU CAN USE THE READCRUNCHED ROUTINE TO LOAD
THE DATA TO MEMORY


A NOTE FROM LORD BLITTER
------------------------

The byte killer was designed to crunch RAW DATA (sound,code,graphics,...)
but not CLI-executable code,this means that you CANNOT crunch a program
like the seka assembler directly , you have to crunch it at a FIXED address
(This is nearly impossible for big programs which are divided in many
parts that load at different VARIABLE places in the memory !!!); but you
can crunch your own programs written in assembly by using absolute
addressing (use ORG & LOAD options under SEKA).
By the way you can use it to make your own hires page SHOW and have
twice as much pictures on a disk than with the standard IFF page show
(you'll have to write your own IFF -> Bkiller converter).

The meaning of the "CRUNCH FACTOR"
----------------------------------

This factor tells the cruncher if it has to be efficient or if it has
to be fast, if you use a big factor the cruncher will be very slow but
very efficient and of course a small factor will be superfast but less
efficient.
If you don't have too much time and you want and good crunch of your
program choose $400.
Please do not use a factor less than 10 because if can cause decrunch
problems.
