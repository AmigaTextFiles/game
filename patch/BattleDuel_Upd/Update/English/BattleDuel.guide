                              ================@{ub}

@{" We " link authors} got the idea for BattleDuel when we played 'Artillery Duel' on the C-64.
After  some  hours  of  playing  we  got annoyed by some small bugs and other
insufficincies. Soon we agreed to program an Amiga version.

There  are  already some games of this type on the Amiga but they mostly lack
good  graphics  and  game  play.  We  wanted  the game to be very near to the
orginal. Furthermore we (and @{" others " link thanks}) got many ideas about improvements and
options that had to be build in :-)

Have fun with BattleDuel...

                             ===================@{ub}

With this window you can control the complete program. The Help-key shows you
the  online  help.  The  escape-key  is  used to close (cancel) a window, the
return  key  is used to confirm a window (ok). If you want to save the window
position on a publicscreen, you just have to save the preferences.

If you want to abort a running game, click on the Game-Menu-gadget.

Gadgets for program control:

@{" Quit        " link quit}   Quit the program
@{" Recalculate " link recalculate}   Calculate a new landscape
@{" Game Menu   " link game_menu}   Game Menu Window

@{" Barrel      " link barrel}   Change the angle
@{" Powder      " link powder}   Change the amount of powder used
@{" Move        " link move}   Change the cannon position

Information gadgets:

@{" Victories   " link victories}   Number of victories
@{" Damage      " link damage}   How much damage have you suffered?

The  colored display (green -> yellow -> red) shows the damage of the weapon,
the blue display shows the energy stock.


You can control the cannons with the keyboard (numeric block) too:

Weapon: keys - and +
Barrel: keys 7 and 9
Powder: keys 4 and 6
Move:   keys 1 and 3
Fire:   Enter


In addition you can control the cannons with a gamepad:

Weapon: green and yellow keys
Barrel: joystick up and down
Powder: joystick left and right
Move:   forward and reverse keys
Fire:   red key


With the blue button (resp. shift key) you can activate the "fast mode", i.e.
if  you  hold  down  the  blue button and change the angle of the barrel, the
angle will change quicker.

@node quit "Quit the program"

With this gadget you can quit the program.

@endnode


@node recalculate "Recalculate"

With this gadget you can calculate a new landscape. It is activated only if a
new  duel is started and no player has fired yet. So you have the possibility
to change an "unfair" landscape.

@endnode


@node weapon "Change the weapon"

The  window  with  the weapon selection is opened with the right mousebutton!
Now  you  can  change  the  actual weapon (click with left mousebutton on the
appropriate  gadget)  or  close  the window with the right mousebutton. Right
beside the weapon the amount of energie the weapon uses is shown.

Every cannon has an energie stock of 100 points. For every used weapon points
are  taken  off  this  stock,  until  the  amount  of energy isn't sufficient
anymore.  Then  the  only possible weapon is "Air Raid". All damages that are
repaired  automatically  (barrel,  powder,  move  and anemometer) require one
energy point, too.


There are five different weapons:

· Normal Shot:

  This is the normal cannonball.

· Parachute:

  This cannonball has a parachute, which opens if the cannonball falls down.
  Because of the parachute, it is very wind sensitive.

· Energy Flash:

  With this weapon one can reduce the energy stock of the opponent. It works,
  if one hits the basis, too, but only with a reduced effect.

· Rocket:

  This is a rocket, which automatically aims for the opponents cannon.

· Air Raid:

  After a radio message is sent, a bomber flies into the screen.  The bomb is
  dropped after a click on the "FIRE" gadget.  The special on this weapon is,
  that it uses two rounds (1. round: radio message,  2. round: bomber flies).
  This weapon uses no energy.  Because of  this,  it is the only weapon which
  is useable after the energy stock is used up.

The cannon can be repaired with "Repair".

This table shows all weapons, the appropriate costs and the caused damages:

                                Damage (Cannon)    Damage (Basis)
        Weapon       | Costs  |    Min |    Max |    Min |    Max |
        -----------------------------------------------------------
        Normal Shot  |      5 |      1 |     50 |      - |      - |
        Parachute    |     10 |     40 |    100 |      - |      - |
        Energy Flash |     20 |     30 |     50 |      5 |     10 |
        Rocket       |     40 |     25 |    100 |      - |      - |
        Bomber       |      0 |     25 |    100 |      - |      - |
        Repair       |     40 |     20 |     50 |      - |      - |

The 'damage' of an "Energy Flash" corresponds to the amount of energy that is
subtracted   of   the  opponents  energy  stock,  the  'damage'  of  "Repair"
corresponds to the amount of damages that are repaired (in procent).

@node barrel "Barrel"

With  this  slider gadget you can change the angle of the barrel. The allowed
range is 0 to 90°.

@endnode


@node powder "Powder"

With  this  slider  gadget  you  can change the amount of powder. The allowed
range is 1 to 200 (1 means 'very feeble', 200 means 'very strong').

@endnode


@node move "Move"

With this slider gadget you can change the position of the cannon.

@endnode


@node victories "Victories"

In this gadget the number of victories of the actual game are displayed.

@endnode


@node damage "Damage"

In this gadget the damage status of the cannon is shown (0 means 'no damage',
100  means  'write-off').  Furthermore  you can see the damage on the colored
display.

The  cannon  can  be  damaged  in four ways. These are displayed right to the
corresponding gadget. Green means all is working well, yellow means there are
light damages and red means there are heavy damages. If the windgauge is hit,
the  wind  for  the next shoot is unknown (the display says "??" instead). If
the  barrel is hit you can only move it in 3 degree steps, the same holds for
the  powder.  If  you  hit  the basis you can move the cannon only in a small
range.  If  a  damaged  part of the cannon is hit again, the damage goes from
light  to  heavy,  which means that the part is unuseable for the next shoot.
All damages are repaired automatically.

@node player "Player"

With these 4 gadgets you can change the players for the games. It is possible
to use 2, 3 or 4 players (dependent on the game-mode). To select a player you
first  have to select him from the list (Available Players) then you click on
one  of  the activated player-gadgets (e.g. Player2). You have to fill in the
selected  number  of players or the game won't start. If there are not enough
human players you can fill up the rest with computer players.

@endnode


@node game_mode "Type of game"

You can select between 4 game modes:

1) @{b}Duel Mode@{ub}:

   normal mode, 2 players

2) @{b}Tournament Mode@{ub}:

   tournament mode, 3 or 4 players (dependent on tournament mode)

3) @{b}Training Mode@{ub}:

   training mode, 2 players

4) @{b}Conquer Mode@{ub}

   conquer mode, 2 players

   The goal is to conquer the opponents castle. The distance between the two
   castles is Conquer Width*2 (represented with blazons). If a player wins a
   duel, he gets a blazon from his opponents, if he loses, he has to give it
   back. The player who first reaches the castle of the opponent has won.

For more options see @{" Game Mode Options " link game_mode_options}!

@endnode


@node nr_of_players "Number of players"

With this gadget you can select the number of players for the tournament-mode
"Each vs Each".

@endnode


@node game_level "Difficulty of the game"

The only difference for now is the maximum strength and the maximum change of
the wind speed. This can change in the future.

@endnode


@node weapons "Weapon selection"

You  can  select  between  two  modes:  "Original" and "Enhanced". "Original"

possibility to use all of the new weapons.

@endnode


@node load_settings "Load other settings"

@{b}Trees@{ub}

Shall trees be drawn in the landscape? 

@{b}Flag Animation@{ub}

Shall  the  flag  move?  If not, only after the wind changes a new picture is
drawn (on a slow computer (e.g. A500) it is better to turn off the animation,
because it uses to much calculation time and the whole game runs very slow).

@{b}Shake Screen@{ub}

Shall  the  screen  shake when hit (or a miss strikes in the near vicinity of
the cannon)?

@{b}Balloon@{ub}

Here can switch the balloon on or off.

@{b}Rabbit@{ub}

Here can switch the rabbit on or off.

@{b}Soldiers@{ub}

Here can switch the soldiers on or off.

@{b}Landscape@{ub}

With  this  slider  gadget  you  can  select the appearance of the landscape.
'Flat' means  a  really  flat  landscape,  while  'Rough' means a mountainous
landscape. (This setting is first used when a new landscape is generated).

@{b}Ground Draw@{ub}

With  this  slider  you can select the speed with which the landscape and the
trees are drawn. (Some people like it, if the landscape is drawn slowly, like
it  was on the C-64 :-) [If the slider is on the right the landscape is drawn
as fast as possible, without a delay]).

@{b}Shoot Speed@{ub}

Here you can change the speed of the weapons (don't make it too slow, because
it then looks very unrealistic).

@{b}Background Directory@{ub}

The directory in which the backgrounds are. Only change this if you know what
you  do! New or changed backgrounds can be saved into this directory. After a
new start of the game they are used too.

@{b}Background Load@{ub}

In which order shall the landscapes be loaded? 'Random Order' means at random
while 'In Order' means one after the other.

@{b}Transfer Mode@{ub}

Here you can select between a normal and a high speed mode. The difference is
that if you select "High Speed" no checksums are calculated and therefore the
amount  of  data  is  much  smaller.  If  you encounter any problems with the

                               ===============@{ub}

In  this window you can see the Top Hundred of BattleDuel players. Only human
players  appear  in  this  list. The list is sorted according to the 'Average
Score',  i.e.  the average score for one game (score / number of duels). Only
highscores for games with at least 3 duels are inserted!

The score is calculated in the following way:

   damage * hits / shots * 100 * (1.01 - shots / 100) + bonus

The bonus (only for the winner) is dependent on the game level:

   1000 for easy, 2500 for medium and 5000 for hard

If  the  enhanced  weapon  mode  is  used,  the  remaining  energy points are
multiplied  by  10 and added to the score. In addition there is a game bonus,
which depends on the settings in the Game Mode Options and Graphic Prefs; the
higher  the difficulty the higher the score. If an enemy balloon is shot down
one  gets  1000  bonus points, if a balloon of the own side is downed, 10% of
the score are taken off.


The highscore list is saved automatically after every change.  The @{b}CLR@{ub}-gadget
clears (after a security request) the whole list!

With the "Up" and "Down" gadgets it is possible to walk through the list (the
cursor keys do the same).

                                =============@{ub}

If  you  want  to  play  BattleDuel over a network you need 2 Amigas that are
connected   with  a  nullmodem-cable,  modem,  Parnet/Pronet  or  TCP/IP.  To
establish  a  connection  you  have  to  select  the 'Network'-Gadget on both
computers.  In the next window you then can select the type of connection you
want.

@{" Nullmodem " link nullmodem}   Connection with a nullmodem
@{" Modem     " link modem}   Connection with a modem
@{" TCP/IP    " link tcpip}   Connection with TCP/IP
@{" Parnet    " link parnet}   Connection with Parnet/Pronet

Now  you  have to select the 'Connect'-gadget. Both programs try to establish
the  connection.  If  all  works well the message 'Connection established' is
shown, if not, please check the network preferences.

@{b}Important:@{ub} You should check the network preferences before you try to establish
a  connection  (especially  the  Server/Client-gadget)  because otherwise big
problems are possible.

If you now want to start a network game you have to select at least one local
player  (L)  and  one  network player (N). After this the network game is the
same as a normal game.


@{b}Differences to a normal game:@{ub}

· one computer is the server the other one the client
· only the server can change the settings for duels (players, ...) and can
  start/cancel the game
· no players can be added or removed
· to cut the connection one program has to be quit
· after a duel the client can only select the gadget ('Next Duel' or 'End Game')
  which was selected by the server
· the client can't change the settings for Trees and Landscape in the Graphic
  Prefs
· it is possible to define 10 messages (with SHIFT+F1 to SHIFT+F10) and to
  send them (with F1 to F10)
· if you press the space key a window opens, within you can enter a message
  and send it (Return-key)
· with the 'C' key you can activate the chat mode, where both players can talk
  to each other
· received messages start with "R:", sent messages with "S:"
· the last five messages that were sent and received can be shown with the
  scroll gadget right beside the status bar (hold down the mousebutton while
  you are scrolling)
· the balloon is not present
· the  bomber is started on one computer @{b}after@{ub} the bomb has been dropped on
  the other computer ("Waiting for bomber")

@endnode


@node nullmodem "Connection with a nullmodem"

If  you want a connection with a nullmodem you need a normal nullmodem-cable.
You  shouldn't  set  the baudrate higher than 19200 if you use a slower Amiga
(e.g. A500). The default value of 9600 should be sufficient.

@endnode


@node modem "Connection with a modem"

The  modem  of  the client is set to the autoanswer mode, that means that the
server  calls  the  client.  It  is  therefore  important to start the client
earlier.

@endnode


@node tcpip "Connection with TCP/IP"

To  connect  with TPC/IP you have to start AmiTCP or AS225 before you start
BattleDuel.   You  can  add the following entry to AmiTCP:db/services resp.
Inet:db/services:

battleduel         3000/tcp

The  number  3000  was  choosen  at  will, so it is possible to change this
number  on  both  computers.   If this entry isn't found, the default value
3000 is used.  It is important to start the server before the client!

@endnode


@node parnet "Connection with Parnet/Pronet"

You  first  have  to  start  Parnet or Pronet, so that you are able to access
devices  on  the  other  computer.  Now  you may have to change the local and
remote path in the network prefs.

@{b}Important:@{ub}

Assume  we  call the first computer "A" and the second one "B". Now the local
path  on  A  must  correspond to the remote path on B and the local path on B
must  correspond  to  the  remote  path  on  A. An example (using Parnet, the
network device is called "NET:"):

Computer:     A           B
Local Path:   "DH0:"      "DF1:"
Remote Path:  "NET:DF1/"  "NET:DH0/"

In  the  case  you  are using Pronet the remote paths probably look more like
"NDF1:" and "NDH0:".

We recommend to use the ramdisk (RAM:) to improve the speed.

BattleDuel    will    open    two    files   called   "BattleDuel.read"   and
"BattleDuel.write" in the local path on both computers. Be sure not to delete
them or nasty things may happen!

Note:  this mode should work with other types of networks (e.g. "Network File
System"),  but  this  was  not  tested!  Please  contact  us if you try other
possibilities with success.

                                 ===========@{ub}

BattleDuel  is  too slow on your computer? The first thing you should try, is
to turn off some of the animations (flag, balloon, rabbit, soldiers), because
they  might  use  too  much calculation time. If this doesn't work you should
control the following settings:

@{b}Problem:@{ub} the landscape is drawn too slowly
@{b}Help:   @{ub} change the Ground Draw in the Graphic Prefs to 'fast'

@{b}Problem:@{ub} the cannonball flys to slowly
@{b}Abhilfe:@{ub} change the Shoot Speed in the Graphic Prefs to 'fast'

In  both  cases  the dual case holds, i.e. if the cannonball flys to fast you
should change the Shoot Speed to 'slow'.

@endnode

                                ============@{ub}

BattleDuel  needs  at  least  1  MByte  chip  memory! The sound module is now
located in fast memory to reduce the chip memory usage.

@endnode


@node graphic_boards "graphic_boards"

                              @{b}3.3 GraphicBoards
                             ===================@{ub}

Of  course you can direct the BattleDuel screen onto a graphicboard. This was
successfully  tested  with  a  lot of graphicboards! The only disadvantage is
that  all  graphicboards  (until now) don't have a copper emulation, i.e. the
generated  copperlists  of the program are not displayed. Because of this the
sky,  the  energy  and damage display consist of only one color and therefore
they   don't   look  that  good.  If  you  own  an  ECS  Amiga  the  tooltype
(see @{" Tooltypes " link tooltypes}) DISPLAY_TYPE should be set to AGA!

@endnode


@node tooltypes "Tooltypes"

                                @{b}3.4 Tooltypes
                               ===============@{ub}

The following tooltypes are supported by BattleDuel:

 · DISPLAY_TYPE

   This tooltype is only for users of ECS Amigas with graphicboards. If you
   own a computer with this configuration you should set this value to AGA.

 · DISPLAY_ID

   The hexadecimal value of the DisplayID. If you want to change the screen-
   mode you have to select a new on in the Screen Prefs. The new screenmode
   is used if you restart the game.

   Recommended values: 0x19004 for NTSC, 0x29004 for PAL (ECS)
                       0x99004 for NTSC, 0xa9004 for PAL (AGA)

First  of  all:  updates  are  free! I.e. if you have registered then all new
versions of BattleDuel will work with your keyfile.

We  will  try to spread out updates as fast and as wide as possible (e.g. per
Aminet  or  Fred  Fish). If you don't have access to this (e.g. per CD-ROM or
ftp)  you  can  send @{b}two@{ub} disks with a sufficiend stamped envelope (3,- DM for
germany) to one of the authors. You then get the newest version of BattleDuel
for  free.  (But  please  don't expect that we finish a new version every day
:-).

If you want, we can send you the update per email.

Updates can be found on the following WWW-servers:

If  you  have  registered  you  get  a  keyfile  that  activates all disabled
functions.  The keyfile should be located in the same directory as BattleDuel
but  you  can  copy  it to the S: or DEVS: directory! BattleDuel supports the
environment  variable KEYPATH, i.e. if you have a directory where you collect
your keyfiles, you can copy the BattleDuel keyfile there, too.

The keyfile contains the following informations:

 · number of registration
 · date of registration
 · name and address

It is strictly forbidden to give the keyfile to other people!
