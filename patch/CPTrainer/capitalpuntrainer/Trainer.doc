                        (=============================)


 Yes, here is it. The ultimate Capital Punishment Trainer. Well, it isn`t
 a real trainer, you can only choose the levels & fighters do you wanna
 play. 

 There are so cool backgrounds and fighters, you can only see, when you`re
 strong enough to beat all types of warriors. Now you can choose the levels
 simply by mouseclick.

 REQUIREMENTS:

 - Capital Punishment
 

           ********************* IMPORTANT *************************
   
           You cannot start this trainer from workbench because 
           Capital Punishment needs all your memory!! So, do
           something like this:

           1. Reset your computer and hold down both mousebuttons.
           2. Now click on the right button called "boot with no
              startup-sequence"
           3. Now type in "CD [gamepath]" without quotes of course.
              E.Q. "CD dh2:games/capital"
           4. Now type in "Execute trainer". The trainer will start
              then.

           ********************* IMPORTANT *************************  
            

 If this was succesfully, a nice GUI appears. Here you can select the
 level and fighter you wanna play.

                                MUST select in the fighter menu
                                (where you see the big pictures of
