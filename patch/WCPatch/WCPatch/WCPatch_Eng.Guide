@{JCENTER}Wing Commander CD³²@{PAR}
The Patch@{PAR}

@{JLEFT}        WCPatch is designed to fix some bugs in order to make
Wing Commander CD³² work on a simple Amiga (without the Akiko chip). In fact
Nick Pelling, the guy who translated the game on Amiga, already did that but
in a so fucking manner that we re-made it. The result is that:@{PAR}

	  First, the game works without Akiko and with FastRAM, before the
patch, Nick Pelling was used to blit in a buffer which allocation he didn't
force to ChipRAM. the second error was a sharp (#) he forgot in his source,
destroying the palette.@{PAR}

	  And second, we replaced its C2P with our brand new one, resulting in
an acceleration about ×1.5 to ×5, depending on your CPU.@{PAR}

NEW FOR VERSION 2.0 : We figured out that many people did not achieved to
			  make WCPatch work because the exe file was imploded,
			  so this version deals with imploded exe files too.
			  Also, it now works with the german version.@{PAR}


Now the syntax:

WCPatch   G=German/S      Use german version instead of english one@{PAR}
			      (same as Exe=wing.german)@{PAR}

	  Exe=WingName/K  Use it if you've renamed the executable, or want@{PAR}
			      to specify its full path. If you specify both@{PAR}
			      this and German, German will have the priority@{PAR}
			      ie. If you want to specify an alternate path@{PAR}
			      for wing.german, DOT NOT specify the German switch.@{PAR}

	  S=Stack/N       The stack given to WC, default is 32768.@{PAR}

	  C=Campaign/N    Number of the campaign (default: 0 (Vega)).@{PAR}
			      Use 1 or 2 for secrets missions.@{PAR}

	  NE=NoExit/S     Only usefull on CD, it disables the exit.@{PAR}
			      (the door in the barracks).@{PAR}

	  T=Trainer/S     activates the ingame-keys (F15 to F19).@{PAR}

	  I=Invincibility/S       Why so much "i" ?@{PAR}

	  Pad=NoJoy/S     Don't patch for use of a joystick.@{PAR}

	  SD=SlowDown/N   060 rulez, waits the specified number of VBLs@{PAR}
			      (1 VBL=0.02 s) between each frame.@{PAR}

	  NoC2p/S         Don't remember how slow it was before ?@{PAR}

	  NoWOTG/S        Disables the "Word of the Gods".@{PAR}

	  Add/S           if used, some of the previous options (C,NE,T and I)@{PAR}
			      won't be overwritten by the WingOpts.@{PAR}

	  WO=WingOpts/F   The command line you pass to WC:@{PAR}
					Campaign x = hx@{PAR}
					NoExit = X@{PAR}
					Trainer = Origin&tonic (beware to the case)@{PAR}
					invincibility = -k@{PAR}

If this doc doesn't seem to be correct, just find Amigaguide.library V40 or
kill all the \@{PAR} in this file.

PS: A big thanks must go to Jan Vieten for his so interesting information and ß-testing.
