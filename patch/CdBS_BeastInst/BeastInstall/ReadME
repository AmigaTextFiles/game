--- Shadow of the Beast HD installer and fix ---

This installer requires the two original Beast disks. To install, just
double-click on 'Install'.

The game should work with at least 1M fast ram. There is two versions, one
with cheat mode and one without. The introduction can be interrupted by
hiting escape key. You can also interrupt game over sequence by pressing
fire. You can quit the game anytime by hiting F10.

This patch uses the wonderful WHDLoad by Bert Jahn, so it should work
on any amiga with enough ram. It has been tested on an
A1200 030/50 16M fast kick 39.106. It has been successfully tested until
the end both with cheat mode and without :^))))
