@Node "INTRO" "A short introduction"
@smartwrap

      BeastInstall is, as you managed to understand, a beautyfull utility
which aims at installing shadow of the Beast on your @{"HD" Sys "Dir SYS:"}.

      Moreover, we had to fix it to make it work on every Amiga. We had to
modify some routines, the disk protections, because they were not compatibles
with the game installed on a HD. That means you CAN copy an already installed
game but YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED to do that. So, please don't copy anything other
than the original package (without the game).


     As we made it from the original disks, it may not work with a cracked
version.


     BeastInstall, as every CdBS Software production, is WYW-Ware, which means
Whatever you want Ware:

     - If you like it, you can send us whatever you want, including green
garden-dwarfs, 5 tons of Coca-Cola, some money, etc... And remember me like
particulary crazy things. But you can send us your own productions we'll be
proud to try and spread if we like it.

     - If you don't like, eg if it has destroyed your Amiga, etc..., you can
insult us. Yes, we like insults, especially good-ones because we developp an
insult launcher program called AIFL for which we need many insults.

@smartwrap
      Well, you've clicked on that word and then ? Do you think you'll look
like anything other that a fool by clicking on such a word. Well... poor
guy, I'm sure you're not able to finish this beautyfull game without the
cheat mode. So now, you're going to read the end of the doc without
clicking anywhere, OK?

@Prev INTRO
      Guess what... To install Shadow of the Beast, you have just to
double-click on the Install icon and follow the instructions.
        Don't panic if the screen becomes black, it's normal.

@EndNode
@Node "HOWTOPLAY" "How to play Shadow of the Beast"
@SmartWrap ON

      Well... If you didn't read the manual, just read it. If you own a cracked
version of Shadow of the Beast, just get fucked...

We added some ingame keys to make it better:

      - Esc during the presentation goes directly to the game.

      - Pressing fire now aborts the game over sequence (we were compelled to
wait till the end of the music).

      - F10 whenever you want quits the game.

@Node "KNOWNBUGS" "Known Bugs"
@SmartWrap ON

     He, he... you think we make bugs, your foolishness is great but we are gods
and gods don't make bugs.

     Well, actually there are still some bugs in Shadow of the beast, they are
due to AGA, espacially the one which perturbs the connexity of some trees (a one
hires pixel wide column between the two half).

     You may find some other bugs in the non-cheated version as it has only
been tested to the beginning of the castle.

     Forget that, MORB reached the end without any bug, at least due to our
Patch.
@EndNode
@Node "FUTURE" "The Future"
@SmartWrap ON
in the Future, we intend to do many beautyfull things like:

        - Beast2Installer

        - Beast3Installer

        - An Elite2 clone named Wee World

        - approximately 20 games

        - kill Bill Gates

        - finish everything we began (especially our OS named CHAOS)
