What's all this PGP stuff ?!?!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pretty Good Privacy is a tool to sign and/or encrypt files using a public and
private key. I've signed all the files in this archive, so that you're able to
check with my public key (http://www.amiga.dk/nybo/binaries/NyboKey.asc) if
someone has edited them.

The PGP software is available at:  http://www.pgpi.com  --


Aaarrgghhh... :-/
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You use this software at your own risk! I will accept no responsibility for
any unwelcome effects resulting from the use of any software or information
in this archive. So there.


AmigaGuide/HTML-docs ?!?!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Come on dudes, this proggy doesn't even exceed a kilobyte! :)
Even this doc is approx. thrice as big as ReLock...


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
An Amiga! KickStart 2.0 or higher (V36).
944 (!) bytes of free diskspace.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Copy it to whereever your want. Ehh, well, I prefer C: ... :)
The code is re-entrant and relocatable (ie. pure) so you can, if you want to, make
it resident with the Resident command.

Usage
~~~~~
Open a Shell and type ReLock
(Provided that it's in your path and that you haven't renamed it. :)

Or:  <drumroll>  Create a nice icon for it and start it from Workbench!! (Wheee!! :)

If you'll ever get that wicked idea of stopping ReLock once started, you'll just
have to run it once again or send a break_c. BUT: If another program is patching
ReLock, it has to be stopped first. ReLock will check for this to prevent system
***k-ups. It is also checking the use of the patch, so that no code is removed
when other programs are using it.


Bugs
~~~~
Haven't noticed any yet!  (Maybe some grammar mistakes... sorry!)
BTW: I've tested it with Enforcer without any hits...
     ...until I started MCP... Hmmmm.. Weird. ;)


Future
~~~~~~
No future, unless any bugs show up. Or if someone mails me a nice icon  (-Hint !! :)
