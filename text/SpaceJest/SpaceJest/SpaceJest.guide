About the game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Space Jest is an adventure game of the old type. No graphics here, this is a
text adventure.
I know that about half the prospective players have just stopped reading and
turned to something more interesting like Monkey Island 6, or something like
that. To those of you who are still reading, thanks. I have tried to make
the game as appealing as possible, but there are those who think that to be
called a game it needs graphics. Ah well, we can't all be perfect!
I have been meaning to write a decent adventure game for some time, but all
of the projects I started have ended up mutating into something else. One
of the things I have mastered as a result is being able to write a decent
input routine, and most of the programs I have written of late (from
databases to all manner of other things) have used the same input routine
which I hijacked from one or other of my attempts at an adventure game.

The idea for the game came after playing Space Quest IV on a friend's
PC (yuk). That game is a graphic adventure, although not what I call state-
of-the-art, but it has a fair helping of humour to make up for the graphics
problems. 
I decided to write my own adventure game with some humour in it, based in
space. Or rather based on dry land, but with a spacey-type background.
Unfortunately, I have about as much graphic ability as a road accident, so I
have been forced to make it a text adventure. *Note to any graphic artists
out there trying to get noticed: I have plot lines coming out of my ears,
but unless someone offers their graphics talents for free, I will just have
to make them text adventures, too.

Other inspiration came from Jim MacBrayn, who wrote the rather good `Golden
Fleece', proving that the text adventure still has some life. Well done Jim,
(And yes, I did send him his shareware fee!)

Playing the game is fairly easy if you can type, but if you're new to these
things, try reading @{"how to play" link HowToPlay} before starting - it also contains loads of
tips and the occasional hint. I won't tell you the plot here: You'll have to
play the game to find out that. The game starts with a page of opening info,
and the plot develops from there as you explore.

The game is not extremely big, containing a little short of one hundred
locations, but the puzzles are much more closely packed than in some other
games I have played. I sometimes find it fustrating in other games to be
able to move all over the place but not actually do anything.

@prev About

The game was programmed using Amos Professional Version 2.00 and the Amos
Professional Compiler. Most of the work was done on an A500 with kickstart
version 1.2, but later changes were made using an A4000/030. The game has
been tested under Kickstart 1.2, 1.3 and 3.0, and works with them all.

However, when I got a 68060 installed into my A4000, I found that the
program only works if I the compiler option "Include Amos.library" is set
to "No", which means that you will need to have the Amos.library in your
libs directory in order to run this game, or any other Amos program by me.

If this really bugs you, drop me a line, and I'll re-compile it for you
with the library included.

Distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This game used to be @{"shareware" link Shareware}. However, I've scrapped that idea
for this program - it's not really in the same league as other shareware
stuff out there, so I'm now giving it away as freeware.

I've still got my rules, though!!!!....
If a price is charged for the program, it must be purely to cover media
costs and other sundries, and may not be above £2 sterling (and hopefully a
good deal lower!). 
However it is distributed, the following files MUST be included:
   SpaceJest            The executable program file.
   Adventext.dat        The location description data file.
   SpaceJest.guide      This AmigaGuide® file.
   Amos.Library (Libs:) Amos Pro's distribution library.
   ...And any icon files associated with the above.

All methods of distribution generally used for PD/Shareware are fully supported
by the author.
The program, and all associated files are @{"Copyright" link CRight} (©) 1994, Simon
Champion, and may not be altered, edited or removed or added to without
prior consent from the programmer.

Distributors Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you are a Public Domain/Shareware distributor distributing this program,
I would appreciate it if you let me know about you.
The reason for this request is simply so that I can send you updates if and
when I write them, as well as other programs. I would prefer to avoid having
libraries distributing old (or buggy) versions of my programs when I could
easily send them updates.

If you are distributing via floppy disk....
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This disk may contain more than one program when supplied to you. These
programs may or may not be by myself, although they will all be freely
distributable. You are not required to distribute these programs with
SpaceJest, but you are required to distribute it on a disk that is at least
80% (eighty percent) full, and you may not sell the disk for and more than
£2 (Two UK pounds), $3 (Three US dollars), or the equivalent. It would be
preferable for you to charge a good deal less than that.

Or on a CD-ROM...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is quite possible that this program may find it's way onto a CD-ROM.
Provided that the software on the CD-ROM is predominantly freely
distributable, all I can say is that the price charged should be in line
with other PD/shareware CD-ROMs available.
Explicit permission is given to Aminet to distribute this software.
Other CD-Rom compilers, please - I'd appreciate it if you at least let
me know you're including it. A copy of the CD would be nice, too :)

Online...
~~~~~~~~~~
Provided that your service is free or non-profit making, you are welcome
to keep this program available for download. But please keep the archive
as you found it.


Thank you for your attention.

Shareware
~~~~~~~~~
Well, actually, it isn't shareware any more, so I don't know why you came
here. SpaceJest is now FREEWARE.

On the other hand, if you feel you've got money to burn, I'd much rather
you sent it (unburnt) to me.... If you think the program is worthwhile.

For your information, any money that is sent to me for my programs, I
use to pay shareware fees for other programs. If that makes you feel good,
you're welcome to send me money.

But! I haven't put my address into this documentation! You'll have to
contact me via e-mail first, and I'll give you my postal address.

About Me
~~~~~~~~
It's a badly concealed fact that most people like to talk about themselves,
with programmers being no exception to the rule, and this programmer being
very heavily in line with the rule, so here is my self-gratifying chance to
be extremely modest (not).

I grew up in England and emigrated here to South Africa in 1991 with my
family when things were looking fairly rosy out there. By 1996, I'd had
enough of South Africa's violence, and moved back to Endland, and I now
work as a programmer in the town of Marlow, near Maidenhead, west of London.
I have been programming since I can remember, and have had an Amiga since
1987, when they were brand new. Until 1994, I was using the same Amiga 500
with Kickstart 1.2, but having had my job for a year, I was able to spend
my entire year's savings on a brand new Amiga 4000. More recently, I upgraded
by buying another A4000, this time with a Cyberstorm 060/SCSII, a 1.2 gig
hard drive and a Picasso IV graphics card. I'm very chuffed with it all,
but I'm now a little bit broke!
I studied computers at school and at college in Pretoria.
When programming, I usually call myself Pegasoft.

Although I have written this game in Amos, I can program in C, Pascal, and
assorted other languages. At work, I am using a language called Synergy Dibol
as part of a team writing a large system on Unix, VMS VAX and Windows NT.

I have written various programs on the Amiga and on the PC (yuk), of all
sizes. I'll refrain from listing them here, but you can get an idea by
looking on my web site - see the address below.

My other hobbies/passtimes/sports besides anything connected to computers
include gliding, chess, reading and writing. I am trying to break into
the fields of freelance journalism, short stories, and I am even trying my
hand at a novel (don't hold your breath, it may take a while!).


If you want to contact me, you can send me an e-mail. (My appologies to
those of you without e-mail - I'd really reccommend getting it though!)

   My address is:   simonc@mcs.co.uk

I am open to any correspondance, and I will try to reply to it all. Please
let me know what program/version you are using!

I'd also be happy to welcome you to my web page. If you're lucky, you might
find something of interest!

Technical stuff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Read this if you want to write your own game, know how to program, but don't
know where to start with an adventure. If a registered user wants more help
writing their own game, I will be happy to help - Just write!

The most important part of the adventure game is the parser or interpreter.
This takes the sentences input by the user, chops it up into it's component
words, and analyses them. The words can be grouped into categories such as
nouns, verbs, etc, and the parser must check each word to see what category
it fits into. Usually each verb will have it's own sub-routine or procedure,
which will then perform the correct action on the object(s) in question.

Objects are usually not stored by the computer in their word form: The
computer stores a list of nouns, and possibly adjectives, and the objects in
the game reference these. When you type GET ROPE, the computer finds rope in
it's list of nouns, and then looks to see if there is an object in the area
with the same noun number.
Locations are also not stored as a description. Each location has a unique
number, and the descriptions are stored in a database with the same numbers.
Location zero is commonly used for objects that are carried by the player,
and negative location numbers are used for items that are worn, eaten,
hidden, or any number of other things.
When the game starts, usually at location 1, the computer loads the location
description and the exit details which tell the computer (and the player)
which direction he can move to, and to what location (if any) each direction
leads.

It is possible to cheat a bit by reading through the data file containing
the location descriptions (although it's not easy!). My original plan was
to encrypt this file, but I never got round to it.
The next text adventure game I release will have this feature. I've already
written it, and it works well. I've tried to make the encryption as strong
as possible, although I know that it'll always be breakable, but it was a
good challenge.

The game's vocabulary is split into three main groups: Verbs, Nouns and
Adjectives. Words such as The, And, A, An, and so on are effectively ignored
by the computer. All the objects you can find in the game are either in the
form of an adjective and a noun, or just a noun. The objects are stored as a
list of six numbers which tell the computer (among other things) what noun
and adjective to call the object by, and where it is (0 for this last field
represents that is is being carried). Doors are special objects in that some
of the data serves a different purpose to that of the others. For example,
doors must be in two locations at once (you can't go through a door and find
it doesn't exist on the other side!), and can be open, closed or locked, but
they can't be picked up, so the weight field used by other objects is used
for the door's status (Open, closed, locked).

Locations are stored in a random access file for flexibility and speed. They
are stored as a title of 20 charaters, six description fields of 70
characters each, and an exits field of 30 characters.
The exit field is in the form of a sequence of numbers, three for each
possible direction (8 compass points plus up and down), which are set to the
location number that the direction leads to, with 000 meaning that no exit
exists. Doors exits are not stored in the file, but are checked when needed
from the door data (see above).

I hope all that was worth it. If you want a more detailed discussion of the
tequniques I've used, please feel free to contact me. My tequniques are
probably very different to anyone else's, but they work for me. They need to
be refined a bit, and I have already got ideas on some important refinements
for my next adventure. I shalln't be fixing this one up before release,
because it is too far gone in development to start changing it now. For
example, doors could in future be stored in the locations file with other
exits, but as negative numbers representing the object number of the door in
question, eliminating the need to check.

                     SPACE JEST IV½
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For those of you who haven't played a text adventure before, here's what
they do:
Rather than give you graphics and using a mouse pointer, you are given text
and use the keyboard. The idea is that words can conjure up a mental picture
of the scene which is far more vivid than any graphics could be.

   To play the game, you must type in what you want to do in the game using
short English sentences like GO NORTH, or TAKE THE LONG ROPE. Quite long
sentences are possible, but usually you will be entering shorter sentences
of three words or less.
   The basic sentence structure is simply VERB ADJECTIVE NOUN. The verb
tells the computer what you want to do, and the adjective and noun tell the
computer what you want to do it to. The adjective can usually be ommitted
unless there are more objects around with the same noun - eg if a Pink flower
and a Red flower are both in the same location, you will need to type GET
PINK FLOWER to take the pink one, but if the red flower is not there, or is
in a different place, you can ommit the word PINK.
   Moving from one location to another is quite a common thing to do in
these games, so rather than typing GO TO THE NORTHEAST every time you want
to go anywhere, the same command could be shortened to simply NE. Other
directions can also be shortened simmilarly to either one or two letters,
and UP and DOWN can also be used, either as is, or shortened to U and D.
   So the command GO TO THE NORTH could be shortend to GO NORTH, or NORTH,
or just plain N.

@node Objects "Objects in the game"
@prev HowToPlay

Objects
~~~~~~~

   Dotted about the landscape are numerous objects that can be manipulated
in various ways. Most can be picked up, although you can only carry so much
weight. You can and should examine all objects you come across. Some objects
will have uses in puzzles or problems later on, some are red herrings. It is
up to you to work out which are which. You can use TAKE or GET to pick them
up and DROP or THROW to get rid of them. Many other commands are possible,
although many commands are only applicable to certain objects.

   You are advised to pay careful attention to the text of the locations,
and to examine every object you find: clues are hidden in the text in
several places, and you will have to be sharp to spot all of them. There are
also quite a few red herrings about, but I'll leave them for you to find.
You can only carry a certain amount at one time, so you may have to drop
some objects to pick others up. Some objects are heavier than others, and
others will be simply too heavy for you to lift at all. Do not assume that
any one object has only one use in the game.

Characters
~~~~~~~~~~

   On your travels, you may well meet other characters. In this game, you
will not be able to interact with them as freely as you might wish. When you
meet a character, you will generally be told what happens, rather than being
asked to interact with them. Sometimes, they might ask you a puzzle for
which you must supply the answer. Most characters will give clues to the
next part of the game, or they might ask you to bring them something.

@node Terminals "Computers inside your computer... like, wow, man."
@prev HowToPlay

Computer Terminals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   An important part of the game are the computer terminals. These link up
to StarNet, as well as to each other. They operate with a simple command
line. All the old favorite commands are there - Dir, CD, etc, as well as
many special ones that you can use to send messages and even teleport with.
The system is spectacularly unfriendly, and although a page of on-line help
is given, you will probably get very irritated with the number of things the
system won't allow you to do. It is important to read the text in the
system carefully, as with the text in the main adventure, as even minor
details can be of importance later on.
   To use a terminal (assuming you have found one), simply type LOGON as
your command in the game. When you are finished (assuming you haven't been
thrown out of the system for security reasons), you should type LOGOFF.

Loading, Saving, Quitting and Restarting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   It is quite easy to die without much warning in the game, so you are
advised to save your position regularly with the SAVE command. Saved games
can be restored later by typing in either LOAD or RESTORE. Saved games will
be saved in the current directory unless you specify a different one, and
with the extension .Jest, again unless you specify a different one.

   If you want to stop playing, type EXIT, QUIT, or just Q. You will be
asked if you are sure before the game quits.

   If you get really stuck, RESTART will take you back to the begining of
the game, so you can start again.

@node CommandLine "Command line and parser"
@prev HowToPlay

The Command Line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Some of the puzzles you will get might need a number as the answer. In
these cases, you will only be able to enter numbers at the cursor.

   If at any point, you want to repeat a previous command, you can use the
up and down cursor keys (just like Amiga Dos Shell), to recall any of the
previous ten commands you entered. If you try to press return without
entering anything, you will find that your entry is not accepted. A space
will also not be accepted as the first character in a command.

   Some commands you might find useful are:
      TIE           -  eg TIE STRING TO PARCEL
      UNTIE         -  eg UNTIE STRING AND PARCEL
      LOCK / UNLOCK -  eg UNLOCK DOOR WITH KEY (you'll need the right key!)
      OPEN / CLOSE  -  eg OPEN DOOR
      LOOK          -  will give you the description of the current
                       location.
      EXAMINE       -  eg EXAMINE TREE - will tell you some details about
                       the specified object. Often very useful.
      THROW         -  eg THROW BONE AT DOG or THROW STONE - if only one
                       object specified, this is the same as DROP.
      TAKE / GET    -  eg GET ROPE - will make your character pick up the
                       specified object.
      DROP          -  Opposite of GET. You will drop the object.

   There are many other commands in the game, but I'll just let you suffer
and work them out for youself.
