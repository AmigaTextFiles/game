Landing Site.                 This is where you crashed your ship. There is a huge area of          mangled vegetation in the centre of which is your ship, or what       remains of it! Looking at it again, you are frankly surprised you     actualy survived that smash, and that ship certainly isn't going      anywhere again! In all directions, thick jungle vegetaion looms up,   but there are a few openings, where unknown animals have made paths.  000003000031002000004000000000Dead end.                     Ah well. This path seems to have become overgrown with disuse. You    have to admit to not being particularly surprised by this. It wasn't  a very convincing path in the first place: too many branches to be    climbed over, under and around. Before you turn back, however, it is  worth noting that your crash must have been worse than you thought,   since parts of the ship are strewn even this far from the crash site. 001000000000000000000000000000Jungle path.                  You are on a narrow path that winds its way through the jungle. To    the south-west is the clearing made by your crash. As you walk along  the path, you can hear the sounds of an animal making hideous blood-  curdling cries, but despite it sounding terrifyingly close, to your   great releif, you never actually get to see it.                                                                                             005000000000000001000000000000Jungle path.                  You are on a winding jungle path that twists and turns until you      almost loose your sense of direction. You eventually arrive at a fork in the path. You can retrace your steps, or you could take one of the other two paths. The widest and most well used path out of the three  heads north.                                                                                                                                006000001000000008000000000000Fork in path.                 After following the path for some time as it twists and turns, you    are about to give up on this path and turn back when you suddenly     arrive at a fork in the path.                                         As you are considering which way to go, you hear a terrifying sound   of some animal roaring, which sounds frighteningly close. The howls   seem to be coming from the north-east fork.                           000009000000003000010000000000Jungle path.                  This path, unlike the others you have been on, is not only fairly     straight, but also wide and high enough for you to walk comfortably   without having to stoop. The path's surroundings, however, are the    same: undergrowth so dense, that even a mouse would have trouble      trying to leave the path!                                                                                                                   007000000000004000000000000000Fortified clearing.           This is possibley the last thing you expected to find in a jungle.    You are in the southern part of a large clearing in the forest. The   northern part of the clearing would appear to be inaccessible, since  the clearing is divided by a huge wooden fence that reaches easily    over twice your height. There is a small, but sturdy wooden door      built into the fence, which looks tiny in the massive fence.          000000000000006000000000000000Top of pit trap.              Walking along this path, you very nearly fall down a pit trap that    has been dug in the middle of the path, and concealed round a blind   corner. As you regain your balance, you are peturbed to see that the  bottom of the pit is filled with bones, most of which you could not   even begin to recognise. The pit takes up the entire width of the pathso though the path continues south, you can't follow it any further.  000004000000000000000000000011Entrance to lair.             You are at the entrance to a large opening, which from the piles of   droppings and other waste, would appear to be a lair of some sort of  animal. The lair is in the form of a tunnel dug into the ground,      simmilar in many respects to the sort of tunnel a rabbit might make.  This, however, is no rabbit tunnel. At least, you never heard of a    rabbit tunnel that you could walk upright in!                         000000012000000005000000000000Jungle path.                  You are on a jungle path. This path is slightly wider and better      used than most of the others you've been on so far. As you walk along the path, you think you can pick up a faint smell of burning, but it  only lasts for a moment, and although you try, you cannot pick up the smell again.                                                                                                                                000000005000000000000013000000Bottom of pit.                You are at the bottom of the pit trap. Your steps make sickening      crunching sounds as you tread on the bones that litter that bottom    of the pit. Looking around, you can see a door set into the northern  wall of the pit.                                                      At the top of the pit, you can see a path in the jungle, but the pit  walls are too high to climb up, so you will have to use the door.     000000000000000000000000000000Dark passage.                 You are in a dark tunnel in the lair of an unknown creature. To the   west, you can see a circle of light indicating the entrance of the    tunnel. Branches of the tunnel fork away into the darkness in several directions, all heading fairly steeply downwards, but you are sure    that none are too steep for you to handle.                                                                                                  014000015016000000009000000000Fortified clearing.           You are on a small patch of bare ground. To the south and east,       the jungle looms impenetrably, but to the north and west, you are     hemmed in by a massive fortification. This fence made from whole tree trunks is well over twice as tall as you are, and you can see         nothing of what is on the other side. Inset into the western side of  the fence is a small door which is dwarfed by the massive fence.      000000000010000000000000000000Food store in lair.           This is quite grusome. This room is full of dead animals. Some have   huge bites taken out of them, and all are obviously destined to be    eaten by the creature that lives here. You almost bolt from the room  as it occurs to you that if you are here when the creature gets hungryyou would probably be mistaken for food! As you survey the grim scene,a disturbing image comes to your mind of your mother's larder at home.000000000015012000000000000000Inner sanctum.                This chamber smells utterly revolting. This is presumably where the   beast sleeps, since the ground is piled thick with matted vegetation  that could pass for a crude nest, or even a (very) crude matress,     assuming the creature could stand the smell. Maybe it doen't have any sence of smell? If you can stay in here more than a couple of minutes,you're braver (or stupider) than you look!                            000000000000000000012014000000New chamber.                  Just in case you thought this lair was abandoned, this proves         otherwise. This chamber is only half dug, with loose earth            everywhere, and massive claw marks in the far wall. You can only      guess that the creature must right now be depositing his last load of soil, since it doen't seem to be currently in the lair. You make a    mental note not to return here, if you can help it - just in case...  000000000000000000000012000000Inside the compound.          You are inside the massive fence. This appears to be some kind of     primitive village. There are huts of varying size and construction    dotted arround the compound, from the huge stone building that you    guess must be their town hall of sorts, to the more commonplace mud   hut type affair where presumably the individual villagers live. Not   one has a door - the fence is quite enough protection, it seems.      021000018000000000020000000000Eastern side of compound.     You are on the eastern side of what looks like a primitive village.   To the east, the huge fence looms up, with a tiny door inset into it. There are many large and small buildings within the compound, but the only one near you at the moment seems to be a watch tower, being      built on stilts, and being about as high as the fence that it is      built against.                                                        000000000000000000017000019000Watch tower.                  I hope you're not afraid of heights! You are (to your best judgement) over fifteen feet off the ground, which is swaying dizzily below you. No. The ground doen't sway. Argh! The building is swaying! It seems tobe fairly safe, just not very pleasant to stay in. It is built againstthe fence, which has peepholes built into it for the watchman to look through, but which are practically invisible from the other side.     000000000000000000000000000018Western side of compound.     You are in the western side of the primitive village. Several         buildings have been built near the fence here, and the fence in this  area has no doorway in it. There is also a watch tower here, but the  ladder leading up to it is totally rotten - when you put your foor on the bottom rung experimentally, the rung breaks almost immediately.                                                                         000000017000000027028000000000North end of compound.        You are at the northern end of the compound. To the west, is the      large stone building that you thought was probably the town hall.     Other buildings are dotted around the place, mainly of the small mud  hut variety. The fence that surrounds the entire compound seems to    be a little higher here than elsewhere in the compound, although that could be your imagination.                                            000000000000017000022000000000In the large stone building.  You are inside the large stone building that dominates the compound.  As you suspected, this is indeed a meeting hall. A large wooden table takes up the largest part of the room. At one end of the table is an  equally large chair, and the sides of the table are provided with     benches.                                                                                                                                    000000021017000000000000000000Top of pit trap.              You are at the top of the pit that you swung so inexpertly over. To   the south, the path continues into the jungle, and coming from that   direction, you can hear the faint sound of waves on a beach. The      other alternative direction to go would be to climb down into the     pit, although you are unsure as to whether you would be able to       climb out again if you did.                                           000000000000024000000000000011Beach.                        You are on a picture postcard beach. On one side it is lined with     a tropical rainforest (beautiful, now that you are out of it), and    to the other side, the sea is crystal clear and remarkably calm. A    few miles out to sea, you can just see on the horizon is another      island simmilar to the one you are on. It's a shame your camera was   broken in the crash!                                                  023000000000000000000000000000Underground Tunnel            You are in a gloomy tunnel which runs roughly north-south. There is   a funny musty smell, which reminds you of your sock drawer in your    room at home. To the south, a door out leads to the pit, and to the   north, the tunnel leads off into a very murky distance.                                                                                                                                                           026000000000000000000000000000Branch in tunnel              You are at a fork in the tunnel. Passages lead to the north, west and south. All are dark and dank. You are begining to wish you had never  come down this passage - it's about as pleasant as crashing a space-  ship on a remote planet..... Oops. Now you really feel bad! I hope    you're not afraid of spiders.... You can just about make out very dim light in the darkness to the north.                                   029000000000025000030000000000Inside a primitive hut        You are inside a small mud hut. When you were trainging as a space    cadet, you never, ever, not in you wildest dreams, imagined that you  would ever be standing inside one of these things, but here you are!  The single room is, to all intents and purposes, bare, except for for the trap door in the middle of the floor. Interesting, eh?                                                                                  000020000000000000000000000000Inside a primitive hut        This is about the least likely place you could ever have imagined     yourself to be, being, as you are, a space pilot. From the pots in onecorner, and the straw matress in the other, you guess that you are in somebody's house. There really isn't much of any interest here. Well, what did you expect? A computer terminal?                                                                                                   000000020000000000000000000000Northern end of tunnel        You are at the northern end of a dark, dank, smelly and generally     unpleasant gloomy underground tunnel. To the south, the passage       dissapears into a gloomy darkness, and above you shafts of light shinedown on you through a trap door above you.                                                                                                                                                                        000000000000026000000000000000Dark tunnel                   You are in a dark, smelly and claustophobic underground tunnel. You   can see just short of nothing, except the darkness and the rocky      tunnel wall you are leaning against to help you find your way. You    thank whatever luck you have been granted that there doesn't seem to  be anything on the ground to trip over.                                                                                                     000000026000000000036000000000Jungle Path                   You are on a winding path through the dense jungle. There is a        heady smell as the fragrances of an assortment of exotic flowers      compete for the attentions of the myriad of insects that seem more    interrested to be swarming round you than visiting any plants.        The path leads back towards your ship to the north-west, and          continues south-east into the depths of the jungle.                   000000000032000000000001000000Outside abandoned House       You are outside a very rickety looking building. The door is missing  entirely, and the window frames contain more cobwebs than glass.      The building is fairly modern-looking, however, and certainly not the sort of thing you would expect to find in a jungle of all places. It  is built from stone, apparently by someone who knew precicely how to  build a house properly, from archetecture to bricklaying.             000000000000000000000031000000Inside abandoned house        This building looks even worse on the inside than it does from the    outside! Just moving around the room, you put your foot through a     particularly rotten floorboard, and the eastern side of the building  is innaccessible due to the fact that the ceiling has collapsed there.The western side of the room looks to be in a slightly better state,  and there is an intact staircase leading up to the attic above.       000000000000000000000000034000Attic                         You are in the attic of the abandoned house. You are amazed frankly,  that the attic floor has not collapsed (it actually has in the easternend of the building), and you are going to have to tread carefully to avoid putting your foot in it, as the saying goes. Needless to say,   the creaking of the floor scares the life out of you whenever you so  much as shift your weight.                                            000000000000000000000000000033Sandy beach                   You are on the sandy beach of the second island. This beach is just   as beautiful as the other, but with the added bonus of a crystal      clear river running south, that is shallow enough for you to follow   as a path. Other than that, this island appears identical to the otherone except that the sand is a slightly paler shade, and so on, but    it's not good form to be too picky over details, so stop it.          000000000000037000000000000000Store room.                   You are in an underground store room which is, compared to the tunnel you were in previously, quite well lit. There are wooden torches      dotted arround the walls, burning to give the room a degree of warmth,light and spooky shadows. The room contains far beyond its share of   parephinalia, most of which seems to be useless junk, but there are a few items of interest scattered here and there.                       000000030000000000000000000000River mouth.                  You are near the mouth of an extremely shallow river. It must be dry  season here, or else there is a much bigger river somewhere else, as  this little stream could never support the jungle that it's running   through! It does however, provide a very convenient path for you      through the otherwise impenetrable jungle. The water is crystal clear,but does not seem to have any fish in it, unless they're hiding!      035000000000038000000000000000Bend in river.                You are at a sharp bend in the river. Until now, the river has been   fairly straight, allowing for normal river-like twists and turns, but here, it makes a sharp bend, flowing from the east, towards the sea   to the north.                                                                                                                                                                                                     037000039000000000000000000000Ravine.                       As you walk along the river, you notice that the sides build up       gradually until you are walking along a narrow ravine with sheer rock face on either side of you, and the shallow river running at the      bottom. Obviously, this river is not a powerful now as it once was!   Another river waterfall's over the ravine's edge into the main river  at this point, but it too carries very little water.                  042000040000000000038000000000End of ravine.                You are at the end of the ravine. Surrounding you on three sides are  the massive walls of the ravine, the southern wall being taken up withthe waterfall that serves to allow the river to get into the ravine.  The waterfall is pitifully weak, and judging by the dryness of the    water-smoothed rocks, it has been for sometime. Behind the waterfall  you can make out a cave dissapearing into the ravine wall.            000000000000041000039000000000Waterfall cave.               You are in a natural cave behind the waterfall. The cave heads south, presumably following the course of the river above, and the floor is  wet with in-spray from the waterfall and leakage from the river above.The tunnel is remarkably light considering that it is underground, as light is refracted along it by the waterfall. The walls are absolutelysmooth with eons of water erosion.                                    040000000000043000000000000000Under the waterfall.          You are standing under a waterfall. You are getting wet. The waterfallis quite powerful, and takes all of a split second to soak you to the skin.                                                                 Now that you are soaking wet and shivering, prehaps you ought to come out of there, and stop being so silly.                                                                                                      000000000000039000000000000000Damp tunnel.                  You are in a smooth water-formed natural tunnel. Although the tunnel  is natural, your keen eye notices that it is not entirely untouched.  Subtle telltale hints can be seen such as the mysterious unmarked     lever sunk into the wall, or the waterproofed light fittings that run tastefully along the ceiling, or the door that sits inconspicuously   in the eastern wall.....                                              041000000000045000000000000000Stairwell.                    You are on a landing on a wide staircase carved out of the solid rock.Stairs lead both upwards and downwards from here, although the stairs leading down are a good deal wider and seem more well used than those leading upwards. None of the water from the tunnel on the other side  of the door seems to have got through, and unlike the tunnel, you can be certain that these stairs are not a natural formation.             000000000000000000000000048049Dank tunnel.                  As you go further along the tunnel, the light fittings which lightenedyour way come to an end, and the tunnel quickly becomes darker and    damper and generally more unpleasantly smelly the further you go. The smell in the tunnel reminds you of rotting fish, although where you   would have smelt that before to remind you of is somthing of a mystery(although you shouldn't think too long about it!).                    043000000000046000000000000000Sloping tunnel.               As you move further along the tunnel, it begins to slope more and moredownwards, and being slippery, you soon find yourself starting to     loose your footing. It is so dark now, that you can hardly see        anything in front of you. If you continue much further, and the slope continues to steepen, you will probably not be able to climb out again(yes, it is that slippery). And yes, it does still smell of bad fish. 045000000000047000000000000000Vertical tunnel.              Well, I did warn you. As you make your way deeper into the tunnel, it does indeed steepen to the point that you wouldn't be able to get backup again, and continues to steepen beyond that. In fact, just as you  are on the point of slipping down anyway, the tunnel finishes curving rather suddenly by aiming vertically downwards into nothingness. You  are dead long before you splash into the subterranean lake far below. 000000000000000000000000000000Wooden staircase.             You are on a wooden staircase. Further downstairs the stairs are stoneand lead to the landing, but looking up, the stairs become a spiral   wooden staircase with the steps built against the walls of a vertical hole that spins giddily when you look up or down it. There is a slightdraught from above, suggesting that the stairs lead into the open air (which would be quite a relief after that tunnel!).                   000000000000000000000000051044Foot of stone stairs.         You are at the foot of a stone staircase that leads up to the landing.You are standing in a small room which is carved out of the rock. The room is decorated with a worn carpet, the colour of which is rather   hard to descern most of the coloured layer has long since             disintergrated. In the east wall, opposite the stairs, is a large     door.                                                                 000000000000068000000000044000This location should never be If you are reading this from within the program, please contact the   author with details of how you got this.

Thank you.                                               000000000000000000000000000000Hollow Tree trunk.            You are at the top of the spiral wooden staircase, inside a hollow    tree trunk. Notches cut into the inside of the trunk serve as foot andhand holds allowing you to climb to the top of the tree, and there is a small hole at the bottom of the trunk through which you could just  about squeeze. Looking up, you can see that the tree is still alive,  despite being hollow, since all you can see above is a sea of green.  000000053000000000000000052048Top of tree.                  You are at the top of the hollow tree, on what seems to be a small    observation platform. Unfortunately, the platform seems to be rather  neglected, and you can see nothing through the thick leaves of the    tree which block your view in every direction. In winter, when the    tree looses it's leaves, this could be a brilliant place to look at   the countryside, but for now, there is just too much foliage.         000000000000000000000000000051Clearing.                     You are in a grassy clearing surrounded by jungle. In the middle of   the clearing is the hollow tree, which looks much bigger now that you are outside of it. In various directions, paths lead off into the     jungle, looking remarkably simmilar to the paths you walked along on  the other island. Where they lead to is anyone's guess.                                                                                     000054000055056000051000000000Quicksand!                    Glug glug glug. That is the sound the ground around you is making. Thereason is that you are standing in a patch of quicksand, sinking      rather quickly. You'd better think of somthing to do, and quickly!    You have about a minute before you will be completely sunk.           And I don't want anyone saying they've got `That sinking feeling      again.'                                                               000000000000000000000000000000Jungle Path.                  You are walking along a path in the jungle. It looks painfully        familiar - you think you recognise each turn, but you never find what you were expecting. You are fooling yourself, as all the paths in thisjungle look basically the same.                                       The path is quite long and twists tortuously, but you eventualy reach a three way junction in the path where you stop to rest.              000057000058000000000053000000Cliff face.                   You are at the bottom of a sheer cliff. It is not a dramatically tall cliff, but it is quite tall enough to be impossible to climb without  proper saftey equipment. About twenty metres above you, you can see   grass hanging over the cliff ledge, along with the occasional tree.   All around you, you are hemmed in by the impenetrable jungle, except  for the path which leads north.                                       053000000000000000000000000000Burnt stump.                  You are in a small clearing in which is a the burnt stump of a huge   tree. It seems to have been burnt down some time ago: The surrounding trees show no burns, so they must have since recoverd, but within the circular clearing, no plant life exists. To the south-west the path   twists into the forest, and to the east you see another tree burning  green flames in its own clearing, beyond which the path continues.    000000059000000055000000000000Cave Entrance.                You are standing at the entrance to a large cave, set in an imposing  sheer-faced cliff. The cave looks natural enough, but is obviously    in use. You can tell this from two tell-tale signs: firstly, there is the remains of a fire in a ring of stones, which is still smouldering,and secondly, there is a large wooden notice prominently positioned   right in front of the cave mouth.                                     000000065000000000000055000000Burning Tree.                 Are you a glutton for punishment, or what? Ah well, it's too late now.You are standing in the middle of a blazing fire.                     It's hot.                                                             Well, what did you expect???                                          In fact, it's very hot.                                                                                                                     000000060000000000057000000000Jungle path.                  You are on a jungle path, not unlike any of the myriad of other paths you have already been down. To the west, the path terminates at the   burning clearing which is still burning with those strange green      flames. To the east, the path continues into the jungle, and in all   other directions you can see nothing but thick, impenetrable jungle   vegetation.                                                           000000067000000000059000000000Top of cliff.                 You are on a cliff ledge. Looking northwards out over the jungle with its criss-crossing paths and clearings, you can see the beach, and    further north, on the horizon you can just make out the other island  across the sparkling blue sea. To the south, quite close to the cliff face, but not running over it, a river runs, and thick undergrowth    blocks your vision and movement in all other directions.              000000000000062000000000000000River side.                   You are on the north bank of a fast flowing river. To the west, the   river splits into two. The weaker branch flows to a cliff edge, into  a waterfall, while the majority of the river turns south and flows    into the distance. The river looks too fast to swim - you'd probably  get carried over the waterfall. To the north, a cliff ledge looks out over the jungle, and thorn bushes block your way in other directions. 061000000000000000000000000000Southern River Bank.          You are on the southern bank of the fast flowing river, quite close tothe cliff where it cascades over as a waterfall. This side of the     river has a small path running alongside it, which heads upstream to  the east, but peters out close to the waterfall to the west. Further  south, the jungle looms up once again, looking even more inpenetreablethan ever.                                                            000000064000000000000000000000Overgrown Path.               If the path peters out by the waterfall, it gets pretty close to doingthe same in this direction. The path is hideously overgrown, and all  but impassable. The river is long since out of sight behind the thick wall of vegetation, but at least you can see the sky, unlike most of  the jungle paths you've been along so far.                                                                                                  000000000000000000063000000000Cave Paintings.               You are in a cave. All around the walls, torches have been hung, whichgive off enough light to illuminate a quite stunning array of cave artwhich, from the scattered charcoal lumps and other material, you wouldguess is still being added to. You can see daylight to the west, and  the main cave continues eastwards, but there is also a small hole in  the south wall that you could probably squeeze through if you wanted. 000000066000074000058000000000Witch Doctor's Room.          You are in a truly odd chamber. In the centre of the room, a large    cauldron bubbles fiercly, and all over the room, bat's wings, frog's  legs, and worse are all to be seen, kept in neatly labeled jars. You  half expect to see three witches from Macbeth suddenly appear! Howeverthere are also things like eye charts and modern medical equipment    that look more than totally out of place here.                        000000000000000000065000000000Garden Fence.                 You are standing by a tall wooden fence which, when you peer through  the cracks, and jump to see over the top, seems to enclose someone's  garden. You can't tell much from what you can see, but it looks fairlywell kept. There is a gate in the fence leading into the garden which is closed, but not locked. The only other path leads west, back into  the jungle.                                                           000000000000000000060000000000Corridor.                     You are walking along a corridor that wouldn't look out of place in   an office building. The walls are wood panneled, and carry various    office type (ie: dull) paintings, and carpet tiles line the floor.    There is a door to the west, and the corridor leads north back to the stairs, or south, where it ends. There are doors leading off it in    both directions.                                                      049000000000069000000000000000Southern end of corridor.     You are at the southern end of the corridor. To the north, the passageleads back towards the stairs, and there is a door to the west. On theend wall to the south is a large painting of a bowl of fruit, looking very boring, and entirely in keeping with it's surroundings in the    corridor.                                                                                                                                   068000000000000000000000000000Office.                       You are in a small office. An office chair squats behind a small desk upon which sits a dusty computer terminal. The decor is of about the  same standard as the passage outside, with the addition of copious    quantities of dust. The computer terminal might be of some use, all   the same - despite the dust, it is working, and is displaying the     logon prompt.                                                         000000000000000000000000000000Changing Room.                You have found some odd things in office buildings before now, but    this must classify as the oddest. Leading off the perfectly normal    looking office corridor, you have found a sports centre. Well, not    quite, but you are in a changing room, and through the archway in the west wall, you can see a swimming pool. Still, remote jungles aren't  the first place you'd expect to find an office building, anyway.      000000000000000000072000000000Swimming Pool.                You are standing on the edge of a medium sized underground swimming   pool. Judging from the air temperature in here, you guess that the    pool must be well heated. The room could almost double up as a sauna! While not quite up to olympic standards, the pool has been well built,but you cannot work out why anyone would build a pool here. Come to   think of it, that could apply equally well to many other things here. 000000071000000000000000000000Herb Garden.                  You are in a beautifully kept herb garden. Dotted around the garden   are simply hundreds of herbs and flowers, nearly every one of them    giving off a different scent, which combines with the drone of insectsto give the place a magically peaceful feeling. To the south, the     garden gate leads back to the jungle path, and to the north-west, a   living archway of flowers leads into another part of the garden.      000000000000000000000075000000Stalacmite Cavern.            You are in a massive natural cavern. Due to the remarkable reflective properties of the huge stalacmites that cover the ceiling, you are    able to see every detail just by the light coming in from the tiny    crawl-spaces at each end of the cavern, to the north and south. Dottedaround the floor are the remains of many fallen stalacmites, and the  rest look rather wobbly. Silence is the watch-word here, I think.     065000000000079000000000000000Ornamental Garden.            You are in another beautiful garden. This one is an ornamental garden,comprising a rectangular fish pond, herbacious borders, and paths     linking them all together. There is also a maze, with a fiendishly    difficult layout, but unfortunately the hedge has not yet grown tall  enough to stop you seeing the entire maze, so you decide not to waste time with it. Flower arches lead north, south-east and west.          076000000073000000077000000000Orchard.                      This is another area of the garden. This time, you are in a large     orchard. Fruit trees of all discriptions, some recognisable, others   not, are arranged in lines. Very few are bearing fruit at the moment, although there are exceptions. Most are in full blossom, and the smellis simply wonderful.                                                                                                                        000000000000075000000000000000Outside Garden.               You are standing by the outer hedge of the garden. To the east, an    arch in the hedge leads back into the garden, and to the west is the  all too familiar sight of the jungle with yet another jungle path     dissapearing into it's depths.                                                                                                                                                                                    000000075000000000078000000000Jungle Path.                  You are getting thoughrouly sick of jungle paths by now! Still, it's  better than not being able to go anywhere, I suppose. This jungle     path is no different from the numerous others you've walked along     already. It twists and turns like a demented snake, leading east      back to the gardens, or south west to goodness knows where.                                                                                 000000077000000054000000000000Gigantic Cavern.              You are standing in a cave of titanic proportions. The walls and      ceiling seem natural enough, but the completely flat floor looks      suspiciously like concrete, and is painted in the standard patterns   of a space port landing pad. Although the only entrance to the cave   is the tiny crawl space you entered through, there is a space ship    in here, although you cannot imagine how it got here.                 074000000000080000000000000000Space ship airlock.           You are in the open main airlock of the RMS Vision. Apart from the    accumulated dust, there does not seem to be much wrong with the ship  other than the lack of power. The airlock exits into the huge cavern  to the north, and to the south into the interior of the ship. The onlylight comes from a dull red emergency light, and a monitor screen withthe words "Aux Power Critical" flashing on it.                        079000000000081000000000000000Space ship interior.          You are in the main access chamber of the ship. Doors lead in all     directions, marked "Cabins", "Cargo Hold", and so on, but only the oneleading to the cockpit is open, and without power, open the others    could prove difficult. Monitor screens placed in strategic positions  all have the words "Aux Power Critical" flashing on them, just to makea point.                                                              080000082000000000000000000000Cockpit                       You are in the cockpit of the starship RMS Vision. All the controls   are dead, except the computer terminal and the status monitors. The   terminal is displaying the usual logon prompt, and the status monitor has the usual (by now) "Aux Power Critical" message flashing on it.   All the controls are totally dead. The terminal in the co-pilot's     position is missing.                                                  000000000000000000081000000000
