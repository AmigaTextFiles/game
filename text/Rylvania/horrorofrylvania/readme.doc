"The Horror of Rylvania" - over two years in development - is a new adventure
from the author of Unnkulia Zero and Unnkulian Underworld!  A more serious
adventure than the Unnkulian games, we're sure "The Horror of Rylvania" will
send shivers up your spine!

I.  THE GAME

We strongly suggest playing the game from a hard drive; it will run MUCH
faster.  All you need to play the game are the files HDEMO.GAM, TR.EXE, and
RYLDEMO.BAT.  To run the game, simply type RYLDEMO. When distributing the 
game, please include the documentation files ORDER.FRM, README.DOC, 
CONTACT.US, GENERAL.DOC and FILE_ID.DIZ.  The game is very forgiving 
about memory; however, if reporting a bug that seems to be memory-related, 
please include a listing of your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files as well 
as your system set-up.

For those of you unfamiliar with text adventures, here are some sample
commands:

get lamp                        examine the shrine
put green key in red box        eat slice of pizza
attack monster with pike        kick the golden door
north ( can be just 'n' )       look under chair
get all                         put the widget on the thingy
drop all                        hit the moron with the cheez key
get the key and the sword and the axe and the widget

...and so forth.  There are several specialized commands supported
that will be familiar to adventure junkies:

    - "x" can be used for "examine"
    - "i" for inventory - lists all carried items
    - "g" for again - repeats last command
    - "l" for look - prints room description
    - "z" for wait - wait one turn
    - "undo" - undo the last turn.  Useful if you've screwed up!  You can undo
		more than one command.  You cannot, however, undo if you are
		killed!
    - "wordy" - prints room descriptions each time a room is entered
    - "terse" - prints room descriptions only the first time a room is
		entered - standard mode
    - "save" "restore" "restart" - commands to save, restore, and restart
		a game
    - "score" - prints your current score and gives you some idea of how
		well you're doing
    - "diagnose" or "health" - find out how you're feeling.
    - "space" - will toggle spacing between paragraphs on or off.
    - "indent" - will toggle paragraph indenting on or off.

Typing Function Key 1 on the keyboard will put the game in "Review Mode."
You can then use the cursor keys and "Page Up/Page Down" to scroll through
the last several pages of your game.  On most systems, the game will save at
least ten pages of text.  Type F1 again to return to the game.

Numbers in brackets (example: [4]) are footnotes.  The footnotes provide
information that may be interesting or amusing, but are not crucial to the
game.  To read a footnote, type "footnote" followed by the number (example:
"footnote 4").

Both games have a fairly large vocabulary.  If the game doesn't understand a
command, try rephrasing it.

For additional help, see the file GENERAL.DOC.

II.  SPEAKING WITH CHARACTERS

You're not the only one wandering around Rylvania!  There are several
ways to talk to others in the game - try any or all of the following syntax
constructions...

Examples:

    There is a huge green dragon here.

    >dragon, hello

    The dragon nods politely at you.

    >ask dragon about the purple key

    The dragon doesn't want to talk about that.

    >tell dragon about the sword

    The dragon's ears perk up.

    >show sword to dragon

    The dragon cowers in fright!

    >dragon, follow me

    The dragon bows its head in submission and agrees to follow you.

III.  GENERAL HINTS

Examine everything, and not just the items you can pick up.  There are
many things in the game that can be manipulated.  Read the room descriptions
carefully.

Save often.  There are many ways to die.  Even the most innocent object
is potentially deadly!

The puzzles are all fairly logical.  Some, however, require violating
certain sacrosanct principles of traditional adventure gaming.

We strongly suggest making a map, and we ain't kidding!  There aren't any
mazes in either game, but a map may help you spot areas you've missed.

IV.  ADVENTIONS AND YOU!  (Here comes the pitch...)

No, it's not too good to be true - you ARE getting something for nothing!
However, we hope you'll seriously consider purchasing the full-length version
of "The Horror of Rylvania."  Travel to sinister Gloomfen Castle...encounter a
crazed scientist...and save the souls of the innocent from the Horror of
Rylvania!

Most game companies have abandoned interactive fiction because it
isn't profitable enough.  We think that interactive novels are
exciting and important elements of the gaming world that offer
possibilities currently impossible to explore in graphics-oriented
settings.  Please support us to help keep the interactive fiction
genre alive.  Thanks!

VI.  A FINAL WORD from the author...

This game is dedicated to all those who registered Unnkulian Underworld and
Unnkulian Unventure II.  Without your support, Rylvania would never have
seen the light of day.

Thanks to Dave Baggett for fake vampire teeth.  Thanks to all the playtesters,
especially Marc Frank who slogged through a very preliminary version of the
game.  Thanks to Tim Trzepacz for yet another spiffy manual, and Chris Nebel
for the labels.  And special thanks once again to Mike Roberts for writing
TADS; keep it up, MJR!

Look for "THE LEGEND LIVES: AN UNNKULIAN UNIVERSE UNVENTURE"  - coming next
spring from ADVENTIONS!
