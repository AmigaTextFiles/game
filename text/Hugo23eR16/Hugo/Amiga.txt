Hugo 2.3e for the Amiga
-----------------------

This is an Amiga port of the compiler (hc), the debugger (hd) and the player
(he or "Hugo Engine") for the Hugo text adventure authoring system. Please
send comments or queries about this Amiga port to the email address below.
Note that these programs may require more than the standard stack (the stack
for the Hugo engine is set in its icon to 8192, and I would recommend
at least as much for the compiler and debugger).

The following Workbench tooltypes are supported by the engine and the
debugger:

    DIR		This sets the initial directory for the file requester
		which opens when the Hugo Engine is started from
		Workbench, e.g.

			DIR=Work:Games/HugoGames

    PROPFONT	These two tooltypes determine which proportional and
    FIXEDFONT	fixed-width fonts Hugo should use, e.g.

			PROPFONT=times/15

		If either are omitted then topaz/8 are used in place
		of the omitted font. Both fonts must have the same
		height, else topaz/8 will be used. Proportional fonts
		are only supported for games compiled with Hugo 2.2 or
		newer. When started from the Shell these tooltypes
		will be processed if an icon is found.
