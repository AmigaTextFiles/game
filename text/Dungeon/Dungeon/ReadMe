		Dungeon 2.7A
		============

This is an Amiga port of Dungeon, a classic text adventure written at
MIT in the late seventies.  The authors went on to form their own company,
Infocom, and released an expanded version of Dungeon as Zork I-III. In
case you've never heard of Infocom (shame on you), they went on to release
some (probably most) of the best adventure games ever written.

This version was built from a source file distribution for the game,
implemented in C.  It is based on the game as distributed on a DECUS tape,
circa 1980.  It has been converted from the original DEC FORTRAN to f77 to
C.  See the file "History" for some revision history and credit to those
whose efforts have made this possible.

This port has an Amiga specific front-end, with proper command line
editing, a command line history (use the cursor up/down keys to step
through previously entered commands) and file requesters for the save and
restore operations. It requires at least Kickstart 2.04.

The generic source for this version was put together by

	Ian Lance Taylor
	ian@airs.com
	11 March 1991

and ported to the Amiga by

	David Kinder
	kinder@teaching.physics.ox.ac.uk

Amiga Release 1.0: 15 October 1995
Amiga Release 1.1: 16 December 1995
		   Corrected a problem with the file requesters.
