Glulx -- specification change log

3.0.0:
    Added Unicode support. This means a new selector; a @streamunichar
    opcode; an E2 (Unicode) string type; a couple of new Unicode compression
    node types; and a type-14 call stub, for printing said node types.
    Note that a Glulx 3.0 interpreter can execute Glulx 2.0 game files.

2.0.0:
    Added modular I/O system system; setiosys, getiosys opcodes to
    support it. The default I/O system is no longer Glk, which makes
    this an incompatible change.

(Previous versions were all called "1.0.0")

* :

    selectors

    Added support for compressed strings.
