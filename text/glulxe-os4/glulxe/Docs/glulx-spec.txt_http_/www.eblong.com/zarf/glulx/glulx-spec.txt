0: Introduction

Glulx is a simple solution to a fairly trivial problem. We want a virtual 
machine which the Inform compiler can compile to, without the increasingly 
annoying restrictions of the Z-machine. 

Glulx does this, without much fuss. All arithmetic is 32-bit (although 
there are opcodes to handle 8-bit and 16-bit memory access.) Input and 
output are handled through the Glk API (which chops out half the Z-machine 
opcodes, and most of the complexity of a Z-code interpreter.) Some care has 
been taken to make the bytecode small, but simplicity and elbow room are 
considered more important -- bytecode is not a majority of the bulk in 
current Inform games.

0.1: Why Bother?

We're buried in IF VMs already, not to mention general VMs like Java, not 
to mention other interpreters or bytecode systems like Perl.  Do we need 
another one?

Well, maybe not, but Glulx is simple enough that it was easier to design 
and implement it than to use something else. Really. 

The Inform compiler already does most of the work of translating a 
high-level language to bytecode. It has long since outgrown many of the 
IF-specific features of the Z-machine (such as the object structure.) So it 
makes sense to remove those features, leaving a generic VM. Furthermore, 
there are enough other constraints (Inform's assumption of a flat memory 
model, the desire to have a lightweight VM suitable for PDAs) that no 
existing system is really ideal. So it seems worthwhile to design a new one.

Indeed, most of the effort that has gone into this system has been 
modifying Inform. Glulx itself is nearly an afterthought.

0.2: Glulx and Other IF Systems

Glulx grew out of the desire to extend Inform. However, it may well be 
suitable as a VM for other IF systems.

Or maybe not. Since Glulx *is* so lightweight, a compiler has to be fairly 
complex to compile to it. Many IF systems take the approach of a simple 
compiler, and a complex, high-level, IF-specific interpreter. Glulx is not 
suitable for this.

However, if a system wants to use a simple runtime format with 32-bit data, 
Glulx may be a good choice.

[[Note that this is entirely separate from question of the I/O layer. Glulx 
uses the Glk I/O API, for the sake of simplicity and portability. Any IF 
system can do the same. One can use Glk I/O without using the Glulx 
game-file format. On the obverse, one could also extend the Glulx VM to use 
a different I/O system instead of Glk.]]

0.3: Credits

Graham Nelson gets pretty much all of it. Without Inform, there would be no 
reason for any of this. The entirety of Glulx is fallout from my attempt to 
deconstruct Inform and rebuild its code generator in my own image, with 
Graham's support.

1: The Machine

The Glulx machine consists of main memory, the stack, and a few registers 
(the program counter, the stack pointer, and the call-frame pointer.)

Main memory is a simple array of bytes, numbered from zero up. When 
accessing multibyte values, the most significant byte is stored first 
(big-endian). Multibyte values are not necessarily aligned in memory.

The stack is an array of values. It is not a part of main memory; the terp 
maintains it separately. The format of the stack is technically up to the 
implementation. However, the needs of the machine (especially the game-save 
format) leave about one good option. (See section 1.7, "The Save-Game 
Format".) One important point: the stack can be kept in either byte 
ordering. The program should make no assumptions about endianness on the 
stack. (In fact, programs should never need to care.) Values on the stack 
always have their natural alignment (16-bit values at even addresses, 
32-bit values at multiples of four).

The stack consists of a set of call frames, one for each function in the 
current chain. When a function is called, a new stack frame is pushed, 
containing the function's local variables. The function can then push or 
pull 32-bit values on top of that, to store intermediate computations. 

All values are treated as unsigned integers, unless otherwise noted. Signed 
integers are handled with the usual two's-complement notation. Arithmetic 
overflows and underflows are truncated, also as usual. 

1.1: Input and Output

No input/output facilities are built into the Glulx machine itself. 
Instead, the machine has one or more opcodes which dispatch calls to an I/O 
library.

At the moment, that means Glk. All Glulx interpreters support the Glk I/O 
facility (via the glk opcode), and no other I/O facilities exist. However, 
other I/O libraries may be adapted to Glk in the future. For best behavior, 
a program should test for the presence of an I/O facility before using it, 
using the IOSystem gestalt selector (see section 2.13, "Miscellaneous").

One I/O system is set as current at any given time. This does not mean that 
the others are unavailable. (If the interpreter supports Glk, for example, 
the glk opcode will always function.) However, the basic Glulx output 
opcodes -- streamchar, streamnum, and streamstr -- always print using the 
current I/O system.

Every Glulx interpreter supports at least one normal I/O facility (such as 
Glk), and also two special facilities.

The "null" I/O system does nothing. If this is selected, all Glulx output 
is simply discarded. [[Silly, perhaps, but I like simple base cases.]] When 
the Glulx machine starts up, the null system is the current system. You 
must select a different one before using the streamchar, streamnum, or 
streamstr opcodes.

The "filter" I/O system allows the Glulx program itself to handle output. 
The program specifies a function when selecting this I/O system. That 
function is then called for every single character of output that the 
machine generates (via streamchar, streamnum, or streamstr). The function 
can output its character directly via the glk opcode (or one of the other 
output opcodes).

[[This may all seem rather baroque, but in practice most authors can ignore 
it. Most programs will want to test for the Glk facility, set it to be the 
current output system immediately, and then leave the I/O system alone for 
the rest of the game. All output will then automatically be handled through 
Glk.]]

1.2: The Memory Map

Memory is divided into several segments. The sizes of the segments are 
determined by constant values in the game-file header.

    
      Segment    Address (hex)
    
    +---------+  00000000
    | Header  |
    | - - - - |  00000024
    |         |
    |   ROM   |
    |         |
    +---------+  RAMSTART
    |         |
    |   RAM   |
    |         |
    | - - - - |  EXTSTART
    |         |
    |         |
    +---------+  ENDMEM
    

As you might expect, the section marked ROM never changes during execution; 
it is illegal to write there. Executable code and constant data are usually 
(but not necessarily) kept in ROM. Note that unlike the Z-machine, the 
Glulx machine's ROM comes before RAM; the 36-byte header is part of ROM.

The boundary marked EXTSTART is a trivial gimmick for making game-files 
smaller. A Glulx game-file only stores the data from 0 to EXTSTART. When 
the terp loads it in, it allocates memory up to ENDMEM; everything above 
EXTSTART is initialized to zeroes. Once execution starts, there is no 
difference between the memory above and below EXTSTART.

For the convenience of paging interpreters, the three boundaries RAMSTART, 
EXTSTART, and ENDMEM must be aligned on 256-byte boundaries. 

Any of the segments of memory can be zero-length, except that ROM must be 
at least 256 bytes long (so that the header fits in it).

1.3: The Stack

The stack pointer starts at zero, and the stack grows upward. The maximum 
size of the stack is determined by a constant value in the game-file 
header. For convenience, this must be a multiple of 256.

The stack pointer counts in bytes. If you push a 32-bit value on the stack, 
the pointer increases by four.

1.3.1: The Call Frame

A call frame looks like this:

    
    +------------+  FramePtr
    | Frame Len  |    (4 bytes)
    | Locals Pos |    (4 bytes)
    |            |
    | Format of  |    (2*n bytes)
    |     Locals |
    |            |
    | Padding    |    (0 or 2 bytes)
    +------------+  FramePtr+LocalsPos
    | Locals     |    (1, 2, or 4 bytes each)
    |            |
    | Padding    |    (0 to 3 bytes)
    +------------+  FramePtr+FrameLen
    | Values     |    (4 bytes each)
    |      ....  |
    +------------+  StackPtr
    

[[WORK: It would be nice to add an end-of-frame field at the beginning of 
the frame. This would always be zero in the topmost frame, but in any lower 
frame would point at the beginning of the next frame. This would make 
save-to-disk a heck of a lot more efficient.]]

When a function begins executing, the last segment is empty (StackPtr 
equals FramePtr+FrameLen.) Computation can push and pull 32-bit values on 
the stack. It is illegal to pop back beyond the original FramePtr+FrameLen 
boundary.

The "locals" are a list of values which the function uses as local 
variables. These also include function arguments. (The first N locals can 
be used as the arguments to an N-argument function.) Locals can be 8, 16, 
or 32-bit values. They are not necessarily contiguous; padding is inserted 
wherever necessary to bring a value to its natural alignment (16-bit values 
at even addresses, 32-bit values at multiples of four).

The "format of locals" is a series of bytes, describing the arrangement of 
the "locals" section of the frame (from LocalsPos up to FrameLen). This 
information is copied directly from the header of the function being 
called. (See section 1.6.2, "Functions".) 

Each field in this section is two bytes:

    * LocalType: 1, 2, or 4, indicating a set of locals which are that many 
bytes each.
    * LocalCount: 1 to 255, indicating how many locals of LocalType to 
declare.

The section is terminated by a pair of zero bytes. Another pair of zeroes 
is added if necessary to reach a four-byte boundary.

(Example: if a function has three 8-bit locals followed by six 16-bit 
locals, the format segment would contain eight bytes: (1, 3, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 
0). The locals segment would then be 16 bytes long, with a padding byte 
after the third local.)

The "format of locals" information is needed by the terp in two places: 
when calling a function (to write in function arguments), and when saving 
the game (to fix byte-ordering of the locals.) The formatting is *not* 
enforced by the terp while a function is executing. The program is not 
prevented from accessing locations whose size and position don't match the 
formatting, or locations that overlap, or even locations in the padding 
between locals. However, if a program does this, the results are undefined, 
because the byte-ordering of locals is up to the terp. The save-game 
algorithm will fail, if nothing else.

1.3.2: Call Stubs

Several different Glulx operations require the ability to jump back to a 
previously-saved execution state. (For example: function call/return, 
game-state save/restore, and exception catch/throw.)

For simplicity, all these operations store the execution state the same way 
-- as a "call stub" on the stack. This is a block of four 32-bit values. It 
encodes the PC and FramePtr, and also a location to store a single 32-bit 
value at jump-back time. (For example, the function return value, or the 
game-restore success flag.)

The values are pushed on the stack in the following order (FramePtr pushed 
last):

    
    +-----------+
    | DestType  |  (4 bytes)
    | DestAddr  |  (4 bytes)
    | PC        |  (4 bytes)
    | FramePtr  |  (4 bytes)
    +-----------+
    

FramePtr is the current value of FramePtr -- the stack position of the call 
frame of the function during which the call stub was generated.

PC is the current value of the program counter. This is the address of the 
instruction *after* the one which caused the call stub to be generated. 
(For example, for a function call, the call stub contains the address of 
the first instruction to execute after the function returns.)

DestType and DestAddr describe a location in which to store a result. This 
will occur after the operation is completed (function returned, game 
restored, etc). It happens after the PC and FramePtr are reloaded from the 
call stub, and the call stub is removed from the stack.

DestType is one of the following values:

    * 0: Do not store. The result value is discarded. DestAddr should be 
zero.
    * 1: Store in main memory. The result value is stored in the 
main-memory address given by DestAddr. 
    * 2: Store in local variable. The result value is stored in the call 
frame at position ((FramePtr+LocalsPos) + DestAddr). See section 1.5, 
"Instruction Format".
    * 3: Push on stack. The result value is pushed on the stack. DestAddr 
should be zero.

The string-decoding mechanism complicates matters a little, since it is 
possible for a function to be called from inside a string, instead of 
another function. (See section 1.3.4, "Calling and Returning Within 
Strings".) The following DestType values allow this:

    * 10: Resume printing a compressed (E1) string. The PC value contains 
the address of the byte (within the string) to continue printing in. The 
DestAddr value contains the bit number (0 to 7) within that byte.
    * 11: Resume executing function code after a string completes. The PC 
value contains the program counter as usual, but the FramePtr field is 
ignored, since the string is printed in the same call frame as the function 
that executed it. DestAddr should be zero.
    * 12: Resume printing a signed decimal integer. The PC value contains 
the integer itself. The DestAddr value contains the position of the digit 
to print next. (0 indicates the first digit, or the minus sign for negative 
integers; and so on.)
    * 13: Resume printing a C-style (E0) string. The PC value contains the 
address of the character to print next. The DestAddr value should be zero.
    * 14: Resume printing a Unicode (E2) string. The PC value contains the 
address of the (four-byte) character to print next. The DestAddr value 
should be zero.

1.3.3: Calling and Returning

When a function is called, the terp pushes a four-value call stub. (This 
includes the return-value destination, the PC, and the FramePtr; see 
section 1.3.2, "Call Stubs".) The terp then sets the FramePtr to the 
StackPtr, and builds a new call frame. (See section 1.3.1, "The Call 
Frame".) Execution then continues.

Function arguments can be stored in the locals of the new call frame, or 
pushed on the stack above the new call frame. This is determined by the 
type of the function; see section 1.6.2, "Functions".

When a function returns, the process is reversed. First StackPtr is set 
back to FramePtr, throwing away the current call frame (and any pushed 
values). The FramePtr and PC are popped off the stack, and then the 
return-value destination. The function's return value is stored where the 
destination says it should be. Then execution continues at the restored PC.

(But note that a function can also return to a suspended string, as well as 
a suspended caller function. See section 1.3.4, "Calling and Returning 
Within Strings" and section 1.3.5, "Calling and Returning During Output 
Filtering".)

1.3.4: Calling and Returning Within Strings

Glulx uses a Huffman string-compression scheme. This allows bit sequences 
in strings to decode to large strings, or even function invocations which 
generate output. This means the streamstr opcode can invoke function calls, 
and we must therefore be able to represent this situation on the stack.

When the terp begins printing a string, it pushes a type-11 call stub. 
(This includes only the current PC. The FramePtr is included, for 
consistency's sake, but it will be ignored when the call stub is read back 
off.) The terp then starts decoding the string data. The PC now indicates 
the position within the string data.

If, during string decoding, the terp encounters an indirect reference to a 
string or function, it pushes a type-10 call stub. This includes the 
string-decoding PC, and the bit number within that address. It also 
includes the current FramePtr, which has not changed since string-printing 
began.

If the indirect reference is to another string, the decoding continues at 
the new location after the type-10 stub is pushed. However, if the 
reference is to a function, the usual call frame is pushed on top of the 
type-10 stub, and the terp returns to normal function execution.

When a string completes printing, the terp pops a call stub. This will 
necessarily be either a type-10 or type-11. If the former, the terp resumes 
string decoding at the PC address/bit number in the stub. If the latter, 
the topmost string is finished, and the terp resumes function execution at 
the stub's PC.

When a function returns, it must check to see if it was called from within 
a string, instead of from another function. This is the case if the call 
stub it pops is type-10. (The call stub cannot be type-11.) If so, the 
FramePtr is taken from the stub as usual; but the stub's PC is taken to 
refer to a string data address, with the DestAddr value being the bit 
number within that address. (The function's return value is discarded.) 
String decoding resumes from there.

[[It may seem wasteful for the terp to push and pop a call stub every time 
a string is printed. Fortunately, in the most common case -- printing a 
string with no indirect references at all -- this can easily be optimized 
out. (No VM code is executed between the push and pop, so it is safe to 
skip them.) Similarly, when printing an unencoded (E0) string, there can be 
no indirect references, so it is safe to optimize away the call stub 
push/pop.]]

1.3.5: Calling and Returning During Output Filtering

The "filter" I/O system allows the terp to call a Glulx function for each 
character that is printed via streamchar, streamnum, or streamstr. We must 
be able to represent this situation on the call stack as well.

If filtering is the current I/O system, then when the terp executes 
streamchar, it pushes a normal function call stub and begins executing the 
output function. Nothing else is required; when the function returns, 
execution will resume after the streamchar opcode. (A type-0 call stub is 
used, so the function's return value is discarded.)

The other output opcodes are more complex. When the terp executes 
streamnum, it pushes a type-11 call stub. As before, this records the 
current PC. The terp then pushes a type-12 call stub, which contains the 
integer being printed and the position of the next character to be printed 
(namely 1). It then executes the output function.

When the output function returns, the terp pops the type-12 stub and 
realizes that it should continue printing the integer contained therein. It 
pushes another type-12 stub back on the stack, indicating that the next 
position to print is 2, and calls the output function again.

This process continues until there are no more characters in the decimal 
representation of the integer. The terp then pops the type-11 stub, 
restores the PC, and resumes execution after the streamnum opcode.

The streamstr opcode works on the same principle, except that instead of 
type-12 stubs, the terp uses type-10 stubs (when interrupting an encoded 
string) and type-13/14 stubs (when interruping a C-style, null-terminated 
string of bytes/Unicode chars). Type-13 and type-14 stubs look like the 
others, except that they contain only the address of the next character to 
print; no other position or bit number is necessary.

The interaction between the filter I/O system and indirect string/function 
calls within encoded strings is left to the reader's imagination. [[Because 
I couldn't explain it if I tried. Follow the rules; they work.]]

1.4: The Header

The header is the first 36 bytes of memory. It is always in ROM, so its 
contents cannot change during execution. The header is organized as nine 
32-bit values. (Recall that values in memory are always big-endian.)

    
    +---------------+  address 0
    | Magic Number  |  (4 bytes)
    | Glulx Version |  (4 bytes)
    | RAMSTART      |  (4 bytes)
    | EXTSTART      |  (4 bytes)
    | ENDMEM        |  (4 bytes)
    | Stack Size    |  (4 bytes)
    | Start Func    |  (4 bytes)
    | Decoding Tbl  |  (4 bytes)
    | Checksum      |  (4 bytes)
    +---------------+
    

    * Magic number: 47 6C 75 6C, which is to say ASCII 'Glul'.
    * Glulx version number: The upper 16 bits stores the major version 
number; the next 8 bits stores the minor version number; the low 8 bits 
stores an even more minor version number, if any. This specification is 
version 3.0, so a game file generated to this spec would contain 00030000. 
I will try to maintain the convention that minor version changes are 
backwards compatible, and subminor version changes are backwards and 
forwards compatible.
    * RAMSTART: The first address which the program can write to.
    * EXTSTART: The end of the game-file's stored initial memory (and 
therefore the length of the game file.)
    * ENDMEM: The end of the program's memory map.
    * Stack size: The size of the stack needed by the program.
    * Address of function to execute: Execution commences by calling this 
function.
    * Address of string-decoding table: This table is used to decode 
compressed strings. See section 1.6.1.3, "Compressed strings". This may be 
zero, indicating that no compressed strings are to be decoded. [[Note that 
the game can change which table the terp is using, with the setstringtbl 
opcode. See section 2.10, "Output".]]
    * Checksum: A simple sum of the entire initial contents of memory, 
considered as an array of big-endian 32-bit integers. The checksum should 
be computed with this field set to zero.

The interpreter should validate the magic number and the Glulx version 
number. An interpreter which is written to version X.Y.Z of this 
specification should accept game files whose Glulx version between X.0.0 
and X.Y.*. (That is, the major version number should match; the minor 
version number should be greater than or equal to Y; the subminor version 
number does not matter.)

EXCEPTION: A version 3.* interpreter should accept version 2.0 game files. 
The only difference between spec 2.0 and spec 3.0 is that 2.0 lacks Unicode 
functionality. Therefore, an interpreter written to this version of the 
spec (3.0.0) should accept game files whose version is between 2.0.0 and 
3.0.* (0x00020000 and 0x000300FF inclusive).

[[The header is conventionally followed by a 32-bit word which describes 
the layout of data in the rest of the file. This value is *not* a part of 
the Glulx specification; it is the first ROM word after the header, not a 
part of the header. It is an option that compilers can insert, when 
generating Glulx files, to aid debuggers and decompilers.

For Inform-generated Glulx files, this descriptive value is 49 6E 66 6F, 
which is to say ASCII 'Info'. There then follow several more bytes of data 
relevant to the Inform compiler. See the Glulx chapter of the Inform 
Technical Manual.]]

1.5: Instruction Format

There are 2^28 Glulx opcodes, numbered from 0 to 0FFFFFFF. If this proves 
insufficient, more may be added in the future.

An instruction is encoded as follows:

    
    +--------------+
    | Opcode Num   |  (1 to 4 bytes)
    |              |
    | Operand      |  (two per byte)
    |   Addr Modes |
    |              |
    | Operand Data |  (as defined by
    |        ....  |      addr modes)
    +--------------+
    

The opcode number OP, which can be anything up to 0FFFFFFF, may be packed 
into fewer than four bytes:

    * 00..7F: One byte, OP
    * 0000..3FFF: Two bytes, OP+8000
    * 00000000..0FFFFFFF: Four bytes, OP+C0000000

Note that the length of this field can be decoded by looking at the top two 
bits of the first byte. Also note that, for example, 01 and 8001 and 
C0000001 all represent the same opcode.

The operand addressing modes are a list of fields which tell where opcode 
arguments are read from or written to. Each is four bits long, and they are 
packed two to a byte. (They occur in the same order as the arguments, low 
bits first. If there are an odd number, the high bits of the last byte are 
left zero.)

Since each addressing mode is a four-bit number, there are sixteen 
addressing modes. Each is associated with a fixed number of bytes in the 
"operand data" segment of the instruction. These bytes appear after the 
addressing modes, in the same order. (There is no alignment padding.)

    * 0: Constant zero. (Zero bytes)
    * 1: Constant, -80 to 7F. (One byte)
    * 2: Constant, -8000 to 7FFF. (Two bytes)
    * 3: Constant, any value. (Four bytes)
    * 4: (Unused)
    * 5: Contents of address 00 to FF. (One byte)
    * 6: Contents of address 0000 to FFFF. (Two bytes)
    * 7: Contents of any address. (Four bytes)
    * 8: Value popped off stack. (Zero bytes)
    * 9: Call frame local at address 00 to FF. (One byte)
    * A: Call frame local at address 0000 to FFFF. (Two bytes)
    * B: Call frame local at any address. (Four bytes)
    * C: (Unused)
    * D: Contents of RAM address 00 to FF. (One byte)
    * E: Contents of RAM address 0000 to FFFF. (Two bytes)
    * F: Contents of RAM, any address. (Four bytes)

Things to note:

The "constant" modes sign-extend their data into a 32-bit value; the other 
modes do not. This is just because negative constants occur more frequently 
than negative addresses.

The indirect modes (all except "constant") access 32-bit fields, either in 
the stack or in memory. This means four bytes starting at the given 
address. A few opcodes are exceptions: copyb and copys (copy byte and copy 
short) access 8-bit and 16-bit fields (one or two bytes starting at the 
given address.)

The "call frame local" modes access a field on the stack, starting at byte 
((FramePtr+LocalsPos) + address). As described in section 1.3.1, "The Call 
Frame", this must be aligned with (and the same size as) one of the fields 
described in the function's locals format. It must not point outside the 
range of the current function's locals segment.

The "contents of address" modes access a field in main memory, starting at 
byte (addr). The "contents of RAM" modes access a field in main memory, 
starting at byte (RAMSTART + addr). Since the byte-ordering of main memory 
is well-defined, these need not have any particular alignment or position.

All address addition is truncated to 32 bits, and addresses are unsigned. 
So, for example, "contents of RAM" address FFFFFFFC (RAMSTART + FFFFFFFC) 
accesses the last 32-bit value in ROM, since it effectively subtracts 4 
from RAMSTART. "Contents of address" FFFFFFFC would access the very last 
32-bit value in main memory, assuming you can find a terp which handles 
four-gigabyte games. "Call frame local" FFFFFFFC is illegal; whether you 
interpret it as a negative number or a large positive number, it's outside 
the current call frame's locals segment.

Some opcodes store values as well as reading them in. Store operands use 
the same addressing modes, with a few exceptions:

    * 8: The value is pushed into the stack, instead of being popped off.
    * 3, 2, 1: These modes cannot be used, since it makes no sense to store 
to a constant. [[We delicately elide the subject of Fortran.]]
    * 0: This mode means "throw the value away"; it is not stored at all.

Operands are evaluated from left to right. (This is important if there are 
several push/pop operands.)

1.6: Typable Objects

It is convenient for a program to store object references as 32-bit 
pointers, and still determine the type of a reference at run-time.

To facilitate this, structured objects in Glulx main memory follow a simple 
convention: the first byte indicates the type of the object. 

At the moment, there are only two kinds of Glulx objects: functions and 
strings. A program (or compiler, or library) may declare more, but the 
Glulx VM does not have to know about them.

Of course, not every byte in memory is the start of the legitimate object. 
It is the program's responsibility to keep track of which values validly 
refer to typable objects.

1.6.1: Strings

Strings have a type byte of E0 (for unencoded, C-style strings), E2 (for 
unencoded strings of Unicode values), or E1 (for compressed strings.) Types 
E3 to FF are reserved for future expansion of string types.

1.6.1.1: Unencoded strings

An unencoded string consists of an E0 byte, followed by all the bytes of 
the string, followed by a zero byte.

1.6.1.2: Unencoded Unicode strings

An unencoded Unicode string consists of an E2 byte, followed by three 
padding 0 bytes, followed by the Unicode character values (each one being a 
four-byte integer). Finally, there is a terminating value (four 0 bytes).

    
    Unencoded Unicode string
    +----------------+
    | Type: E2       |  (1 byte)
    | Padding: 00    |  (3 bytes)
    | Characters.... |  (any length, multiple of 4)
    | NUL: 00000000  |  (4 bytes)
    +----------------+
    

Note that the character data is not encoded in UTF-8, UTF-16, or any other 
peculiar encoding. It is treated as an array of 32-bit integers (which are, 
as always in Glulx, stored big-endian). Each integer is a Unicode code 
point.

1.6.1.3: Compressed strings

A compressed string consists of an E1 byte, followed by a block of 
Huffman-encoded data. This should be read as a stream of bits, starting 
with the low bit (the 1 bit) of the first byte after the E1, proceeding 
through the high bit (the 128 bit), and so on with succeeding bytes.

Decoding compressed strings requires looking up data in a Huffman table. 
The address of this table is normally found in the header. However, the 
program can select a different decompression table at run-time; see section 
2.10, "Output".

The Huffman table is logically a binary tree. Internal nodes are branch 
points; leaf nodes represent printable entities. To decode a string, begin 
at the root node. Read one bit from the bit stream, and go to the left or 
right child depending on its value. Continue reading bits and branching 
left or right, until you reach a leaf node. Print that entity. Then jump 
back to the root, and repeat the process. One particular leaf node 
indicates the end of the string (rather than any printable entity), and 
when the bit stream leads you to that node, you stop.

[[This is a fairly slow process, with VM memory reads and a conditional 
test for every *bit* of the string. A terp can speed it up considerably by 
reading the Huffman table all at once, and caching it as native data 
structures. A binary tree is the obvious choice, but one can do even better 
(at the cost of some space) by looking up four-bit chunks at a time in a 
16-branching tree.]]

[[Note that decompression tables are not necessarily in ROM. This is 
particularly important for tables that are generated and selected at 
run-time. Furthermore, it is technically legal for a table in RAM to be 
altered at runtime -- possibly even when it is the currently-selected 
table. Therefore, an interpreter that caches or preloads this decompression 
data must be careful. If it caches data from RAM, it must watch for writes 
to that RAM space, and invalidate its cache upon seeing such a write.]]

1.6.1.4: The String-Decoding Table

The decoding table has the following format:

    
    +-----------------+
    | Table Length    |  (4 bytes)
    | Number of Nodes |  (4 bytes)
    | Root Node Addr  |  (4 bytes)
    | Node Data ....  |  (table length - 12 bytes)
    +-----------------+
    

The table length is measured in bytes, from the beginning of the table to 
the end of the last node. The node count includes both branch and leaf 
nodes. [[There will, of course, be an odd number of nodes, and (N+1)/2 of 
them will be leaves.]] The root address indicates which node is the root of 
the tree; it is not necessarily the first node. This is an absolute 
address, not an offset from the beginning of the table.

There then follow all the nodes, with no extra data before, between, or 
after them. They need not be in any particular order. There are several 
possible types of nodes, distinguished by their first byte.

    
    Branch (non-leaf node)
    +----------------+
    | Type: 00       |  (1 byte)
    | Left  (0) Node |  (4 bytes)
    | Right (1) Node |  (4 bytes)
    +----------------+
    

The left and right node fields are addresses (again, absolute addresses) of 
the nodes to go to given a 0 or 1 bit from the bit stream.

    
    String terminator
    +----------------+
    | Type: 01       |  (1 byte)
    +----------------+
    

This ends the string-decoding process.

    
    Single character
    +----------------+
    | Type: 02       |  (1 byte)
    | Character      |  (1 byte)
    +----------------+
    

This prints a single character. [[The encoding scheme is the business of 
the I/O system; in Glk, it will be the Latin-1 character set.]]

    
    C-style string
    +----------------+
    | Type: 03       |  (1 byte)
    | Characters.... |  (any length)
    | NUL: 00        |  (1 byte)
    +----------------+
    

This prints an array of characters. Note that the array cannot contain a 
zero byte, since that is reserved to terminate the array. [[A zero byte can 
be printed using the single-character node type.]]

    
    Single Unicode character
    +----------------+
    | Type: 04       |  (1 byte)
    | Character      |  (4 bytes)
    +----------------+
    

This prints a single Unicode character. [[To be precise, it prints a 32-bit 
character, which will be interpreted as Unicode if the I/O system is Glk.]]

    
    C-style Unicode string
    +----------------+
    | Type: 05       |  (1 byte)
    | Characters.... |  (any length, multiple of 4)
    | NUL: 00000000  |  (4 bytes)
    +----------------+
    

This prints an array of Unicode characters. Note that the array cannot 
contain a zero word, since that is reserved to terminate the array. Also 
note that, unlike an E2-encoded string object, there is no padding.

[[If the Glk library is unable to handle Unicode, node types 04 and 05 are 
still legal. However, characters beyond FF will be printed as 3F ("?").]]

    
    Indirect reference
    +----------------+
    | Type: 08       |  (1 byte)
    | Address        |  (4 bytes)
    +----------------+
    

This prints a string or calls a function, which is not actually part of the 
decoding table. The address may refer to a location anywhere in memory 
(including RAM.) It must be a valid Glulx string (see section 1.6.1, 
"Strings") or function (see section 1.6.2, "Functions"). If it is a string, 
it is printed. If a function, it is called (with no arguments) and the 
result is discarded.

The management of the stack during an indirect string/function call is a 
bit tricky. See section 1.3.4, "Calling and Returning Within Strings".

    
    Double-indirect reference
    +----------------+
    | Type: 09       |  (1 byte)
    | Address        |  (4 bytes)
    +----------------+
    

This is similar to the indirect-reference node, but the address refers to a 
four-byte field in memory, and *that* contains the address of a string or 
function. The extra layer of indirection can be useful. For example, if the 
four-byte field is in RAM, its contents can be changed during execution, 
pointing to a new typable object, without modifying the decoding table 
itself.

    
    Indirect reference with arguments
    +----------------+
    | Type: 0A       |  (1 byte)
    | Address        |  (4 bytes)
    | Argument Count |  (4 bytes)
    | Arguments....  |  (4*N bytes)
    +----------------+
    
    Double-indirect reference with arguments
    +----------------+
    | Type: 0B       |  (1 byte)
    | Address        |  (4 bytes)
    | Argument Count |  (4 bytes)
    | Arguments....  |  (4*N bytes)
    +----------------+
    

These work the same as the indirect and double-indirect nodes, but if the 
object found is a function, it will be called with the given argument list. 
If the object is a string, the arguments are ignored.

1.6.2: Functions

Functions have a type byte of C0 (for stack-argument functions) or C1 (for 
local-argument functions). Types C2 to DF are reserved for future expansion 
of function types.

A Glulx function always takes a list of 32-bit arguments, and returns 
exactly one 32-bit value. (If you want a function which returns no value, 
discard or ignore it. Store operand mode zero is convenient.)

If the type is C0, the arguments are passed on the stack, and are made 
available on the stack. After the function's call frame is constructed, all 
the argument values are pushed -- last argument pushed first, first 
argument topmost. Then the number of arguments is pushed on top of that. 
All locals in the call frame itself are initialized to zero.

If the type is C1, the arguments are passed on the stack, and are written 
into the locals according to the "format of locals" list of the function. 
Arguments passed into 8-bit or 16-bit locals are truncated. It is 
legitimate for there to be too many or too few arguments. Extras are 
discarded silently; any locals left unfilled are initialized to zero.

A function has the following structure:

    
    +------------+
    |  C0 or C1  |  Type (1 byte)
    +------------+
    | Format of  |    (2*n bytes)
    |     Locals |
    +------------+
    |  Opcodes   |
    |      ....  |
    +------------+
    

The locals-format list is encoded the same way it is on the stack; see 
section 1.3.1, "The Call Frame". This is a list of LocalType/LocalCount 
byte pairs, terminated by a zero/zero pair. (There is, however, no extra 
padding to reach four-byte alignment.)

Note that although a LocalType/LocalCount pair can only describe up to 255 
locals, there is no restriction on how many locals the function can have. 
It is legitimate to encode several pairs in a row with the same LocalType.

Immediately following the two zero bytes, the instructions start. There is 
no explicit terminator for the function.

1.6.3: Other Glulx Objects

There are no other Glulx objects at this time, but type 80 to BF are 
reserved for future expansion. Type 00 is also reserved; it indicates "no 
object", and should not be used by any typable object. A null reference's 
type would be considered 00. (Even though byte 00000000 of main memory is 
not in fact 00.)

1.6.4: User-Defined Objects

Types 01 to 7F are available for use by the compiler, the library, or the 
program. Glulx will not use them.

[[Inform uses 60 for dictionary words, and 70 for objects and classes. It 
reserves types 40 to 7F. Types 01 to 3F remain available for use by Inform 
programmers.]]

1.7: The Save-Game Format

(Or, if you like, "serializing the machine state".)

This is a variant of Quetzal, the standard Z-machine save file format. (See 
<http://ifarchive.org/if-archive/infocom/interpreters/specification/savefile
_14.txt>

Everything in the Quetzal specification applies, with the following 
exceptions:

1.7.1: Contents of Dynamic Memory

In both compressed and uncompressed form, the memory chunk ('CMem' or 
'UMem') starts with a four-byte value, which is the current size of memory. 
The memory data then follows. During a restore, the size of memory is 
changed to this position.

The memory area to be saved does not start at address zero, but at 
RAMSTART. It continues to the current end of memory (which may not be the 
ENDMEM value in the header.) When generating or reading compressed data 
('CMem' chunk), the data above EXTSTART is handled as if the game file were 
extended with as many zeroes as necessary.

1.7.2: Contents of the Stack

Before the stack is written out, a four-value call stub is pushed on -- 
result destination, PC, and FramePtr. (See section 1.3.2, "Call Stubs".) 
Then the entire stack can be written out, with all of its values (of 
whatever size) transformed to big-endian. (Padding is not skipped; it's 
written out as the appropriate number of zero bytes.)

When the game-state is loaded back in -- or, for that matter, when 
continuing after a game-save -- the four values are read back off the 
stack, a result code for the operation is stored in the appropriate 
destination, and execution continues.

[[Remember that in a call stub, the PC contains the address of the 
instruction *after* the one being executed.]]

1.7.3: Associated Story File

The contents of the game-file identifier ('IFhd' chunk) are simply the 
first 128 bytes of memory. This is within ROM (since RAMSTART is at least 
256), so it does not vary during play. It includes the story file length 
and checksum, as well as any compiler-specific information that may be 
stored immediately after the header.

1.7.4: State Not Saved

Some aspects of Glulx execution are not part of the save process, and 
therefore are not changed during a restart, restore, or restoreundo 
operation. The program is responsible for checking these values after a 
restore to see if they have (from the program's point of view) changed 
unexpectedly.

Examples of information which is not saved:

    * Glk library state. This includes Glk opaque objects (windows, 
filerefs, streams). It also includes I/O state such as the current output 
stream, contents of windows, and cursor positions. Accounting for Glk 
object changes after restore/restoreundo is tricky, but absolutely 
necessary.
    * The protected-memory range (position, length, and whether it exists 
at all). Note that the *contents* of the range (if it exists) are not 
treated specially during saving, and are therefore saved normally.
    * The random number generator's internal state.
    * The I/O system mode and current string-decoding table address.

2: Dictionary of Opcodes

Opcodes are written here in the format:

    opname L1 L2 S1

...where "L1" and "L2" are operands using the load addressing modes, and 
"S1" is an operand using the store addressing modes. (See section 1.5, 
"Instruction Format".)

The table of opcodes:

    * 0x00: nop
    * 0x10: add
    * 0x11: sub
    * 0x12: mul
    * 0x13: div

2.1: Math

    add L1 L2 S1

Add L1 and L2, using standard 32-bit addition. Truncate the result to 32 
bits if necessary. Store the result in S1. 

    sub L1 L2 S1

Compute (L1 - L2), and store the result in S1.

    mul L1 L2 S1

Compute (L1 * L2), and store the result in S1. Truncate the result to 32 
bits if necessary. 

    div L1 L2 S1

Compute (L1 / L2), and store the result in S1. This is signed integer 
division.

    mod L1 L2 S1

Compute (L1 % L2), and store the result in S1. This is the remainder from 
signed integer division.

In division and remainer, signs are annoying. Rounding is towards zero. The 
sign of a remainder equals the sign of the dividend. It is always true that 
(A / B) * B + (A % B) == A. Some examples (in decimal):

    
    -11 /  2 = -5       
    -11 / -2 =  5        
     11 / -2 = -5
    -13 %  5 = -3        
     13 % -5 =  3       
    -13 % -5 = -3
    

    neg L1 S1

Compute the negative of L1.

    bitand L1 L2 S1

Compute the bitwise AND of L1 and L2.

    bitor L1 L2 S1

Compute the bitwise OR of L1 and L2.

    bitxor L1 L2 S1

Compute the bitwise XOR of L1 and L2.

    bitnot L1 S1

Compute the bitwise negation of L1.

    shiftl L1 L2 S1

Shift the bits of L1 to the left (towards more significant bits) by L2 
places. The bottom L2 bits are filled in with zeroes. If L2 is 32 or more, 
the result is always zero.

    ushiftr L1 L2 S1

Shift the bits of L1 to the right by L2 places. The top L2 bits are filled 
in with zeroes. If L2 is 32 or more, the result is always zero.

    sshiftr L1 L2 S1

Shift the bits of L1 to the right by L2 places. The top L2 bits are filled 
in with copies of the top bit of L1. If L2 is 32 or more, the result is 
always zero or FFFFFFFF, depending on the top bit of L1.

Notes on the shift opcodes: If L2 is zero, the result is always equal to 
L1. L2 is considered unsigned, so 80000000 or greater is "more than 32".

2.2: Branches

All branches (except jumpabs) specify their destinations with an offset 
value. The actual destination address of the branch is computed as (Addr + 
Offset - 2), where Addr is the address of the instruction *after* the 
branch opcode, and offset is the branch's operand. The special offset 
values 0 and 1 are interpreted as "return 0" and "return 1" respectively. 
[[This odd hiccup is inherited from the Z-machine. Inform uses it heavily 
for code optimization.]]

It is illegal to branch from one function to another.

    jump L1

Branch unconditionally to offset L1.

    jz L1 L2

If L1 is equal to zero, branch to L2.

    jnz L1 L2

If L1 is not equal to zero, branch to L2.

    jeq L1 L2 L3

If L1 is equal to L2, branch to L3.

    jne L1 L2 L3

If L1 is not equal to L2, branch to L3.

    jlt L1 L2 L3
    jle L1 L2 L3
    jgt L1 L2 L3
    jge L1 L2 L3

Branch is L1 is less than, less than or equal to, greater than, greater 
than or equal to L2. The values are compared as signed 32-bit values.

    jltu L1 L2 L3
    jleu L1 L2 L3
    jgtu L1 L2 L3
    jgeu L1 L2 L3

The same, except that the values are compared as unsigned 32-bit values.

[[Since the address space can span the full 32-bit range, it is wiser to 
compare addresses with the unsigned comparison operators.]]

    jumpabs L1

Branch unconditionally to address L1. Unlike the other branch opcodes, this 
takes an absolute address, not an offset. The special cases 0 and 1 (for 
returning) do not apply; jumpabs 0 would branch to memory address 0, if 
that were ever a good idea, which it isn't.

Note that it is still illegal to branch from one function to another, even 
with jumpabs.

2.3: Moving Data

    copy L1 S1

Read L1 and store it at S1, without change.

    copys L1 S1

Read a 16-bit value from L1 and store it at S1.

    copyb L1 S1

Read an 8-bit value from L1 and store it at S1.

Since copys and copyb can access chunks smaller than the usual four bytes, 
they require some comment. When reading from main memory or the call-frame 
locals, they access two or one bytes, instead of four. However, when 
popping or pushing values on the stack, these opcodes pull or push a full 
32-bit value.

Therefore, if copyb (for example) copies a byte from main memory to the 
stack, a 32-bit value will be pushed, whose value will be from 0 to 255. 
Sign-extension *does not* occur. Conversely, if copyb copies a byte from 
the stack to memory, a 32-bit value is popped, and the bottom 8 bits are 
written at the given address. The upper 24 bits are lost. Constant values 
are truncated as well.

If copy, copys, or copyb are used with both L1 and S1 in pop/push mode, the 
32-bit value is popped, truncated, and pushed.

    sexs L1 S1

Sign-extend a value, considered as a 16-bit value. If the value's 8000 bit 
is set, the upper 16 bits are all set; otherwise, the upper 16 bits are all 
cleared.

    sexb L1 S1

Sign-extend a value, considered as an 8-bit value. If the value's 80 bit is 
set, the upper 24 bits are all set; otherwise, the upper 24 bits are all 
cleared.

Note that these opcodes, like most, work on 32-bit values. Although (for 
example) sexb is commonly used in conjunction with copyb, it does not share 
copyb's behavior of reading a single byte from memory or the locals.

Also note that the upper bits, 16 or 24 of them, are entirely ignored and 
overwritten with ones or zeroes.

2.4: Array Data

    astore L1 L2 L3

Store L3 into the 32-bit field at main memory address (L1+4*L2).

    aload L1 L2 S1

Load a 32-bit value from main memory address (L1+4*L2), and store it in S1. 

    astores L1 L2 L3

Store L3 into the 16-bit field at main memory address (L1+2*L2).

    aloads L1 L2 S1

Load an 16-bit value from main memory address (L1+2*L2), and store it in S1.

    astoreb L1 L2 L3

Store L3 into the 8-bit field at main memory address (L1+L2).

    aloadb L1 L2 S1

Load an 8-bit value from main memory address (L1+L2), and store it in S1.

Note that these opcodes cannot access call-frame locals, or the stack. (Not 
with the L1 and L2 opcodes, that is.) L1 and L2 provide a main-memory 
address. Be not confused by the fact that L1 and L2 can be any addressing 
mode, including call-frame or stack-pop modes. That controls where the 
values come from which are used to *compute* the main-memory address. 

The other end of the transfer (S1 or L3) is always a 32-bit value. The 
"store" opcodes truncate L3 to 8 or 16 bits if necessary. The "load" 
opcodes expand 8-bit or 16-bit values *without* sign extension. (If signed 
values are appropriate, you can follow aloads/aloadb with sexs/sexb.)

L2 is considered signed, so you can access addresses before L1 as well as 
after.

    astorebit L1 L2 L3

Set or clear a single bit. This is bit number (L2 mod 8) of memory address 
(L1+L2/8). It is cleared if L3 is zero, set if nonzero.

    aloadbit L1 L2 S1

Test a single bit, similarly. If it is set, 1 is stored at S1; if clear, 0 
is stored.

For these two opcodes, bits are effectively numbered sequentially, starting 
with the least significant bit of address L1. L2 is considered signed, so 
this numbering extends both positively and negatively. For example:

    
    astorebit  1002  0  1:  Set bit 0 of address 1002. (The 1's place.)
    astorebit  1002  7  1:  Set bit 7 of address 1002. (The 128's place.)
    astorebit  1002  8  1:  Set bit 0 of address 1003.
    astorebit  1002  9  1:  Set bit 1 of address 1003.
    astorebit  1002 -1  1:  Set bit 7 of address 1001.
    astorebit  1002 -3  1:  Set bit 5 of address 1001.
    astorebit  1002 -8  1:  Set bit 0 of address 1001.
    astorebit  1002 -9  1:  Set bit 7 of address 1000.
    

Like the other aload and astore opcodes, these opcodes cannot access 
call-frame locals, or the stack.

2.5: The Stack

    stkcount S1

Store a count of the number of values on the stack. This counts only values 
above the current call-frame. In other words, it is always zero when a C1 
function starts executing, and (numargs+1) when a C0 function starts 
executing. It then increases and decreases thereafter as values are pushed 
and popped; it is always the number of values that can be popped legally. 
(If S1 uses the stack push mode, the count is done before the result is 
pushed.)

    stkpeek L1 S1

Peek at the L1'th value on the stack, without actually popping anything. If 
L1 is zero, this is the top value; if one, it's the value below that; etc. 
L1 must be less than the current stack-count. (If L1 or S1 use the stack 
pop/push modes, the peek is counted after L1 is popped, but before the 
result is pushed.)

    stkswap

Swap the top two values on the stack. The current stack-count must be at 
least two.

    stkcopy L1

Peek at the top L1 values in the stack, and push duplicates onto the stack 
in the same order. If L1 is zero, nothing happens. L1 must not be greater 
than the current stack-count. (If L1 uses the stack pop mode, the stkcopy 
is counted after L1 is popped.)

An example of stkcopy, starting with six values on the stack:

    
    5 4 3 2 1 0 <top>
    stkcopy 3
    5 4 3 2 1 0 2 1 0 <top>
    

    stkroll L1 L2

Rotate the top L1 values on the stack. They are rotated up or down L2 
places, with positive values meaning up and negative meaning down. The 
current stack-count must be at least L1. If either L1 or L2 is zero, 
nothing happens. (If L1 and/or L2 use the stack pop mode, the roll occurs 
after they are popped.)

An example of two stkrolls, starting with nine values on the stack:

    
    8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 <top>
    stkroll 5 1
    8 7 6 5 0 4 3 2 1 <top>
    stkroll 9 -3
    5 0 4 3 2 1 8 7 6 <top>
    

Note that stkswap is equivalent to stkroll 2 1, or for that matter stkroll 
2 -1. Also, stkcopy 1 is equivalent to stkpeek 0.

These opcodes can only access the values pushed on the stack above the 
current call-frame. It is illegal to stkswap, stkpeek, stkcopy, or stkroll 
values below that -- i.e, the locals segment or any previous function call 
frames.

2.6: Functions

    call L1 L2 S1

Call function whose address is L1, passing in L2 arguments, and store the 
return result at S1. 

The arguments are taken from the stack. Before you execute the call opcode, 
you must push the arguments on, in backward order (last argument pushed 
first, first argument topmost on the stack.) The L2 arguments are removed 
before the new function's call frame is constructed. (If L1, L2, or S1 use 
the stack pop/push modes, the arguments are taken after L1 or L2 is popped, 
but before the result is pushed.)

Recall that all functions in Glulx have a single 32-bit return value. If 
you do not care about the return value, you can use operand mode 0 
("discard value") for operand S1.

    callf L1 S1
    callfi L1 L2 S1
    callfii L1 L2 L3 S1
    callfiii L1 L2 L3 L4 S1

Call function whose address is L1, passing zero, one, two, or three 
arguments. Store the return result at S1.

These opcodes behave the same as call, except that the arguments are given 
in the usual opcode format instead of being found on the stack. (If L2, L3, 
etc. all use the stack pop mode, then the behavior is exactly the same as 
call.)

    return L1

Return from the current function, with the given return value. If this is 
the top-level function, Glulx execution is over. 

Note that all the branch opcodes (jump, jz, jeq, and so on) have an option 
to return 0 or 1 instead of branching. These behave exactly as if the 
return opcode had been executed.

    tailcall L1 L2

Call function whose address is L1, passing in L2 arguments, and pass the 
return result out to whoever called the current function.

This destroys the current call-frame, as if a return had been executed, but 
does not touch the call stub below that. It then immediately calls L1, 
creating a new call-frame. The effect is the same as a call immediately 
followed by a return, but takes less stack space.

It is legal to use tailcall from the top-level function. L1 becomes the 
top-level function.

[[This opcode can be used to implement tail recursion, without forcing the 
stack to grow with every call.]]

2.7: Continuations

    catch S1 L1

Generates a "catch token", which can be used to jump back to this execution 
point from a throw opcode. The token is stored in S1, and then execution 
branches to offset L1. If execution is proceeding from this point because 
of a throw, the thrown value is stored instead, and the branch is ignored.

Remember that a branch value can be 0 to return 0, or 1 to return 1. (These 
return from the function that contains the catch opcode.) Otherwise, it 
branches to (Addr + L1 - 2), where Addr is the address of the instruction 
*after* the catch.

If S1 or L1 uses the stack push/pop modes, note that the precise order of 
execution is: evaluate L1 (popping if appropriate); generate a call stub 
and compute the token; store S1 (pushing if appropriate).

    throw L1 L2

Jump back to a previously-executed catch opcode, and store the value L1. L2 
must be a valid catch token.

The exact catch/throw procedure is as follows: 

When catch is executed, a four-value call stub is pushed on the stack -- 
result destination, PC, and FramePtr. (See section 1.3.2, "Call Stubs". The 
PC is the address of the next instruction after the catch.) The catch token 
is the value of the stack pointer after these are pushed. The token value 
is stored in the result destination, and execution proceeds, branching to 
L1.

When throw is executed, the stack is popped down until the stack pointer 
equals the given token. Then the four values are read back off the stack, 
the thrown value is stored in the destination, and execution proceeds with 
the instruction after the catch.

If the call stub (or any part of it) is removed from the stack, the catch 
token becomes invalid, and must not be used. This will certainly occur when 
you return from the function containing the catch opcode. It will also 
occur if you pop too many values from the stack after executing the catch. 
(You may wish to do this to "cancel" the catch; if you pop and discard 
those four values, the token is invalidated, and it is as if you had never 
executed the catch at all.)

[[Why is the catch branch taken at catch time, and ignored after a throw? 
Because it's easier to write the interpreter that way, that's why. If it 
had to branch after a throw, either the call stub would have to contain the 
branch offset, or the terp would have to re-parse the catch instruction. 
Both are ugly.]]

2.8: Memory Map

    getmemsize S1

Store the current size of the memory map. This is originally the ENDMEM 
value from the header, but you can change it with the setmemsize opcode. It 
will always be greater than or equal to ENDMEM.

    setmemsize L1 S1

Set the current size of the memory map. The new value must be a multiple of 
256, like all memory boundaries in Glulx. It must be greater than or equal 
to ENDMEM (the initial memory-size value which is stored in the header.) It 
does not have to be greater than the previous memory size. The memory size 
may grow and shrink over time, as long as it never gets smaller than the 
initial size.

When the memory size grows, the new space is filled with zeroes. When it 
shrinks, the contents of the old space are lost.

Since memory allocation is never guaranteed, you must be prepared for the 
possibility that setmemsize will fail. The opcode stores the value zero if 
it succeeded, and 1 if it failed. If it failed, the memory size is 
unchanged.

Some interpreters do not have the capability to resize memory at all. On 
such interpreters, setmemsize will *always* fail. You can check this in 
advance with the ResizeMem gestalt selector.

Note that the memory size is considered part of the game state. If you 
restore a saved game, the current memory size is changed to the size that 
was in effect when the game was saved. If you restart, the current memory 
size is reset to its initial value.

2.9: Game State

    quit

Shut down the terp and exit. This is equivalent to returning from the 
top-level function, or for that matter calling glk_exit().

Note that (in the Glk I/O system) Glk is responsible for any "hit any key 
to exit" prompt. It is safe for you to print a bunch of final text and then 
exit immediately.

    restart

Restore the VM to its initial state (memory, stack, and registers). Note 
that the current memory size is reset, as well as the contents of memory.

    save L1 S1

Save the VM state to the output stream L1. It is your responsibility to 
prompt the player for a filespec, open the stream, and then destroy these 
objects afterward. S1 is set to zero if the operation succeeded, 1 if it 
failed, and -1 if the VM has just been restored and is continuing from this 
instruction.

(In the Glk I/O system, L1 should be the ID of a writable Glk stream. In 
other I/O systems, it will mean something different. In the "filter" and 
"null" I/O systems, the save opcode is illegal, as the interpreter has 
nowhere to write the state.)

    restore L1 S1

Restore the VM state from the input stream L1. S1 is set to 1 if the 
operation failed. If it succeeded, of course, this instruction never 
returns a value.

    saveundo S1

Save the VM state in a temporary location. The terp will choose a location 
appropriate for rapid access, so this may be called once per turn. S1 is 
set to zero if the operation succeeded, 1 if it failed, and -1 if the VM 
state has just been restored.

    restoreundo S1

Restore the VM state from temporary storage. S1 is set to 1 if the 
operation failed.

    protect L1 L2

Protect a range of memory from restart, restore, restoreundo. The protected 
range starts at address L1 and has a length of L2 bytes. This memory is 
silently unaffected by the state-restoring operations. (However, if the 
result-storage S1 is directed into the protected range, that is not 
blocked.)

When the VM starts up, there is no protection range. Only one range can be 
protected at a time. Calling protect cancels any previous range. To turn 
off protection, call protect with L1 and L2 set to zero.

It is important to note that the protection range itself (its existence, 
location, and length) is *not* part of the saved game state! If you save a 
game, move the protection range to a new location, and then restore that 
game, it is the new range that will be protected, and the range will remain 
there afterwards.

    verify S1

Perform sanity checks on the game file, using its length and checksum. S1 
is set to zero if everything looks good, 1 if there seems to be a problem. 
(Many interpreters will do this automatically, before the game starts 
executing. This opcode is provided mostly for slower interpreters, where 
auto-verify might cause an unacceptable delay.)

Notes:

All the save and restore opcodes can generate diagnostic information on the 
current output stream.

A terp may support several levels of temporary storage. You should not make 
any assumptions about how many times restoreundo can be called. If the 
player so requests, you should keep calling it until it fails. 

Glk opaque objects (windows, streams, filespecs) are not part of the saved 
game state. Therefore, when you restore a game, all the object IDs you have 
in Glulx memory must be considered invalid. (This includes both IDs in main 
memory and on the stack.) You must use the Glk iteration calls to go 
through all the opaque objects in existence, and recognize them by their 
rocks.

The same applies after restoreundo, to a lesser extent. Since 
saveundo/restoreundo only operate within a single play session, you can 
rely on the IDs of objects created before the first saveundo. However, if 
you have created any objects since then, you must iterate and recognize 
them.

The restart opcode is a similar case. You must do an iteration as soon as 
your program starts, to find objects created in an earlier incarnation. 
Alternatively, you can be careful to close all opaque objects before 
invoking restart.

[[Another approach is to use the protect opcode, to preserve global 
variables containing your object IDs. This will work within a play session 
-- that is, with saveundo, restoreundo, and restart. You must still deal 
with save and restore.]]

2.10: Output

    getiosys S1 S2

Return the current I/O system mode and rock.

    setiosys L1 L2

Set the I/O system mode and rock. If the system L1 is not supported by the 
interpreter, it will default to the "null" system (0).

These systems are currently defined:

    * 0: The null system. All output is discarded. (When the Glulx machine 
starts up, this is the current system.)
    * 1: The filtering system. The rock (L2) value should be the address of 
a Glulx function. This function will be called for every character output 
(with the character value, 00 to FF, as its sole argument). The function's 
return value is ignored.
    * 2: The Glk system. All output will be handled through Glk function 
calls, sent to the current Glk stream.

It is important to recall that when Glulx starts up, the Glk I/O system is 
*not* set. And when Glk starts up, there are no windows and no current 
output stream. To make anything appear to the user, you must first do three 
things: select the Glk I/O system, open a Glk window, and set its stream as 
the current one. (It is illegal in Glk to send output when there is no 
stream set. Sending output to Glulx's "null" I/O system is legal, but 
pointless.)

    streamchar L1

Send L1 to the current stream. This sends a single character; the value L1 
is truncated to eight bits.

    streamunichar L1

Send L1 to the current stream. This sends a single (32-bit) character.

    streamnum L1

Send L1 to the current stream, represented as a signed decimal number in 
ASCII.

    streamstr L1

Send a string object to the current stream. L1 must be the address of a 
Glulx string object (type E0, E1, or E2.) The string is decoded and sent as 
a sequence of characters.

When the Glk I/O system is set, these opcodes are implemented using the Glk 
API. You can bypass them and directly call glk_put_char(), 
glk_put_buffer(), and so on. Remember, however, that a Glulx string object 
is not a C-style string, so it cannot be passed to glk_put_string().

Note that it is illegal to decode a compressed string (E1) if there is no 
string-decoding table set.

    getstringtbl S1

Return the address the terp is currently using for its string-decoding 
table. If there is no table, set, this returns zero.

    setstringtbl L1

Change the address the terp is using for its string-decoding table. This 
may be zero, indicating that there is no table (in which case it is illegal 
to print any compressed string). Otherwise, it must be the address of a 
*valid* string-decoding table.

[[This does not change the value in the header field at address 001C. The 
header is in ROM, and never changes. To determine the current table 
address, use the getstringtbl opcode.]]

A string-decoding table may be in RAM or ROM, but there may be speed 
penalties if it is in RAM. See section 1.6.1.4, "The String-Decoding Table".

2.11: Random Number Generator

    random L1 S1

Return a random number in the range 0 to (L1-1); or, if L1 is negative, the 
range (L1+1) to 0. If L1 is zero, return a random number in the full 32-bit 
integer range. (Remember that this may be either positive or negative.)

    setrandom L1

Seed the random-number generator with the value L1. If L1 is zero, 
subsequent random numbers will be as genuinely unpredictable as the terp 
can provide; it may include timing data or other random sources in its 
generation. If L1 is nonzero, subsequent random numbers will follow a 
deterministic sequence, always the same for a given nonzero seed.

The terp starts up in the "nondeterministic" mode (as if setrandom 0 had 
been invoked.)

The random-number generator is not part of the saved-game state.

2.12: Searching

Perform a generic linear, binary, or linked-list search. 

[[These are outrageously CISC for an hardware CPU, but easy enough to add 
to a software terp; and taking advantage of them can speed up a program 
considerably. Advent, under the Inform library, runs 15-20% faster when 
property-table lookup is handled with a binary-search opcode instead of 
Inform code. A similar change in the dictionary lookup trims another 
percent or so.]]

All three of these opcodes operate on a collection of fixed-size data 
structures in memory. A key, which is a fixed-length array of bytes, is 
found at a known position within each data structure. The opcodes search 
the collection of structures, and find one whose key matches a given key.

The following flags may be set in the Options argument. Note that not all 
flags can be used with all types of searches.

    * KeyIndirect (0x01): This flag indicates that the Key argument passed 
to the opcode is the address of the actual key. (If the KeySize is greater 
than 4, the KeyIndirect flag *must* be used, since values in Glulx are 
limited to four bytes.) If this flag is not used, the Key argument is the 
key value itself. (In this case, if the KeySize is less than 4, the lower 
bytes of the Key are used and the upper bytes ignored.)
    * ZeroKeyTerminates (0x02): This flag indicates that the search should 
stop (and return failure) if it encounters a structure whose key is all 
zeroes. If the searched-for key happens to also be all zeroes, the success 
takes precedence.
    * ReturnIndex (0x04): This flag indicates that search should return the 
array index of the structure that it finds, or -1 (0xFFFFFFFF) for failure. 
If this flag is not used, the search returns the address of the structure 
that it finds, or 0 for failure.

    linearsearch L1 L2 L3 L4 L5 L6 L7 S1

    * L1: Key
    * L2: KeySize
    * L3: Start
    * L4: StructSize
    * L5: NumStructs
    * L6: KeyOffset
    * L7: Options
    * S1: Result

An array of data structures is stored in memory, beginning at Start, each 
structure being StructSize bytes. Within each struct, there is a key value 
KeySize bytes long, starting at position KeyOffset (from the start of the 
structure.) Search through these in order. If one is found whose key 
matches, return it. If NumStructs are searched with no result, the search 
fails.

NumStructs may be -1 (0xFFFFFFFF) to indicate no upper limit to the number 
of structures to search. The search will continue until a match is found, 
or (if ZeroKeyTerminates is used) a zero key.

The KeyIndirect, ZeroKeyTerminates, and ReturnIndex options may be used.

    binarysearch L1 L2 L3 L4 L5 L6 L7 S1

    * L1: Key
    * L2: KeySize
    * L3: Start
    * L4: StructSize
    * L5: NumStructs
    * L6: KeyOffset
    * L7: Options
    * S1: Result

An array of data structures is in memory, as above. However, the structs 
must be stored in forward order of their keys (taking each key to be a 
big-endian unsigned integer.) There can be no duplicate keys. NumStructs 
must indicate the exact length of the array; it cannot be -1.

The KeyIndirect and ReturnIndex options may be used.

    linkedsearch L1 L2 L3 L4 L5 L6 S1

    * L1: Key
    * L2: KeySize
    * L3: Start
    * L4: KeyOffset
    * L5: NextOffset
    * L6: Options
    * S1: Result

The structures need not be consecutive; they may be anywhere in memory, in 
any order. They are linked by a four-byte address field, which is found in 
each struct at position NextOffset. If this field contains zero, it 
indicates the end of the linked list.

The KeyIndirect and ZeroKeyTerminates options may be used.

2.13: Miscellaneous

    nop

Do nothing.

    gestalt L1 L2 S1

Test the Gestalt selector number L1, with optional extra argument L2, and 
store the result in S1. If the selector is not known, store zero.

The reasoning behind the design of a Gestalt system is, I hope, too obvious 
to explain.

[[This list of Gestalt selectors has nothing to do with the list in the Glk 
library.]]

The list of L1 selectors is as follows. Note that if a selector does not 
mention L2, you should always set that argument to zero. [[This will ensure 
future compatibility, in case the selector definition is extended.]]

    * GlulxVersion (0): Returns the version of the Glulx spec which the 
interpreter implements. The upper 16 bits of the value contain a major 
version number; the next 8 bits contain a minor version number; and the 
lowest 8 bits contain and even more minor version number, if any. This 
specification is version 3.0, so a terp implementing it would return 
0x00030000. I will try to maintain the convention that minor version 
changes are backwards compatible, and subminor version changes are 
backwards and forwards compatible.
    * TerpVersion (1): Returns the version of the interpreter. The format 
is the same as the GlulxVersion. [[Each interpreter has its own version 
numbering system, defined by its author, so this information is not 
terribly useful. But it is convenient for the game to be able to display 
it, in case the player is capturing version information for a bug report.]]
    * ResizeMem (2): Returns 1 if the terp has the potential to resize the 
memory map, with the setmemsize opcode. If this returns 0, setmemsize will 
always fail. [[But remember that setmemsize might fail in any case.]]
    * Undo (3): Returns 1 if the terp has the potential to undo. If this 
returns 0, saveundo and restoreundo will always fail.
    * IOSystem (4): Returns 1 if the terp supports the I/O system given in 
L2. (The constants are the same as for the setiosys opcode: 0 for null, 1 
for filter, 2 for Glk. 0 and 1 will always succeed, and 2 will also in any 
Glulx interpreter currently planned.) 
    * Unicode (5): Returns 1 if the terp supports Unicode operations. These 
are: the E2 Unicode string type; the 04 and 05 string node types (in 
compressed strings); the streamunichar opcode; the type-14 call stub. If 
the Unicode selector returns 0, encountering any of these will cause a 
fatal interpreter error.

[[The Unicode selector is slightly redundant. Since the Unicode operations 
exist in Glulx spec 3.0 and higher, you can get the same information by 
testing GlulxVersion against 0x00030000. However, it's clearer to have a 
separate selector.]]

[[The Unicode selector does *not* guarantee that your Glk library supports 
Unicode. For that, you must check the Glk gestalt selector gestalt_Unicode. 
If the Glk library is non-Unicode, the Glulx Unicode operations are still 
legal; however, Unicode characters (beyond FF) will be printed as 3F ("?").

    debugtrap L1

Interrupt execution to do something interpreter-specific with L1. If the 
interpreter has nothing in mind, it should halt with a visible error 
message.

[[This is intended for use by debugging interpreters. The program might be 
sprinkled with consistency tests, set to call debugtrap if an assertion 
failed. The interpreter could then be set to halt, display a warning, or 
ignore the debugtrap.]]

This should *not* be used as an arbitrary interpreter trap-door in a 
finished (non-debugging) program. If you really want to add interpreter 
functionality to your program, and you're willing to support an alternate 
interpreter to run it, you should add an entirely new opcode. There are 
still 2^28 of them available, give or take.

    glk L1 L2 S1

Call the Glk API function whose identifier is L1, passing in L2 arguments. 
The return value is stored at S1. (If the Glk function has no return value, 
zero is stored at S1.)

The arguments are passed on the stack, last argument pushed first, just as 
for the call opcode.

Arguments should be represented in the obvious way. Integers and character 
are passed as integers. Glk opaque objects are passed as integer 
identifiers, with zero representing NULL. Strings are passed as the 
addresses of Glulx string objects (see section 1.6.1, "Strings".) 
References to values are passed by their addresses. Arrays are passed by 
their addresses; note that an array argument, unlike a string argument, is 
always followed by an array length argument.

Reference arguments require more explanation. A reference to an integer or 
opaque object is the address of a 32-bit value (which, being in main 
memory, does not have to be aligned, but must be big-endian.) 
Alternatively, the value -1 (FFFFFFFF) may be passed; this is a special 
case, which means that the value is read from or written to the stack. 
Arguments are always evaluated left to right, which means that input 
arguments are popped from the stack first-topmost, but output arguments are 
pushed on last-topmost.

A reference to a Glk structure is the address of an array of 32-bit values 
in main memory. Again, -1 means that all the values are written to the 
stack. Also again, an input structure is popped off first-topmost, and an 
output structure is pushed on last-topmost.

All stack input references (-1 addresses) are popped after the Glk argument 
list is popped. [[This should be obvious, since the -1 occurs *in* the Glk 
argument list.]] Stack output references are pushed after the Glk call, but 
before the S1 result value is stored.

[[The difference between strings and character arrays is somewhat 
confusing. These are the same type in the C Glk API, but different in 
Glulx. Calls such as glk_put_buffer() and glk_request_line_event() take 
character arrays; this is the address of a byte array containing character 
values, followed by an integer array length. The byte array itself has 
neither a length field or a terminator. In contrast, calls such as 
glk_put_string() and glk_fileref_create_by_name() take string arguments, 
which must be Glulx string objects (either encoded or unencoded.) An 
unencoded Glulx string object is nearly a byte array, but not quite; it has 
an E0 byte at the beginning and a zero byte at the end.]]

[[The convention that "address" -1 refers to the stack is a feature of the 
Glk invocation mechanism; it applies only to Glk arguments. It is *not* 
part of the general Glulx definition. When instruction operands are being 
evaluated, -1 has no special meaning. This includes the L1, L2, and S1 
arguments of the glk opcode.]]

2.14: Assembly Language

The format used by Inform is acceptable for now:

    
    @opcode [ op op op ... ] ;
    

Where each "op" is a constant, the name of a local variable, the name of a 
global variable, or "sp" (for stack push/pop modes).

It would be convenient to have a one-line form for the opcodes that pass 
arguments on the stack (call and glk).

It would be convenient if Inform supported the syntax to build an entirely 
new opcode. (It can do this in Z-code.)
