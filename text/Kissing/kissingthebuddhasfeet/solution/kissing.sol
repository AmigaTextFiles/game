Walkthrough for "Kissing the Buddha's Feet"

There are six distractions you have to get rid of to win the game. They are:

the wind coming through the open/broken window in John's room
the loud TV set
Alice and Carl
Evan
Bob
the leaky pipes

The distractions may be handled in any order, although most players
probably won't
find out about the leaky pipes until the very end, since they can't be
heard while
another distraction is around.

The Wind
--------

Get the cookie dough from the refrigerator. Go to John's room. Close the window.
Put the cookie dough in the hole in the window.

The TV
------

Go to John's closet. Wear the catcher's mitt. Go to the living room. Search the
junk pile. Press the power button on the remote that you find.

Alice and Carl
--------------

Go to John's room. Open the desk and get the coupon book. Go into John's
closet and
get the skateboard. Go to the bathroom and get the towel. Go to the living room.
Listen to what Alice is talking about to determine which food she wants to
eat that
night, and give her the corresponding coupon from the appropriate
restaurant. Then
give her the towel, and then the skateboard.

Evan
----

Go to John's room. Get the trivia game on the desk. Get the duct tape from
the broken
models. Put the duct tape on the game's speaker. Give the game to Evan.

Bob
---

Get the wrapper from the wastebasket in John's room. Ask Evan about the
wrapper; he
will tell you which chocolate has which filling. (If he can't answer you because
he's playing the game, take the game from him. You can give it to him again.)
Make a note of which one is filled with cherry liqueur. (This will change after
restores and undoes.) Go to the kitchen and get the appropriate chocolate
from the
box. Give the chocolate to Bob. Go to your room. Push the swivel chair to
where Bob
fell. Get Bob and put him on the chair. Push the chair to your closet.
Leave the
closet and close the door.

The Leaky Pipes
---------------

Get the wrench from your closet. Go to the kitchen. Look at the sink, then
open the
cabinet underneath it. Tighten the pipes. Go to the bathroom. Open the
cabinet under
the sink and tighten the pipes there. Push the swivel chair to the bathroom and
stand on it. Tighten the pipes on the ceiling.
