x     You, Hammurabi, the King of Babylonia, rule over your country making    x
x       the only decision worth making: where does this year's grain go?      x
x      For the food feeds the people now, buys land, or goes to planting      x
x                  for a very variable harvest for next year.                 x
x                                                                             x
x        Choose wisely and your country prospers: people immigrate from       x
x      foreign lands, you expand your land-holding,and the grain reserves     x
x                                 overflow.                                   x

x       Choose poorly, however, and you face the consequences of famine,      x
x                              plague, and poverty.                           x
