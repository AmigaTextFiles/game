DESCRIPTION
===========

You, Hammurabi, the King of Babylonia, rule over your country making the only decision worth making:
where does this year's grain go? 
For the food feeds the people now, buys land, or goes to planting for a very variable harvest for next year.

Choose wisely and your country prospers: people immigrate from foreign lands, you expand your land-holding,
and the grain reserves overflow. 
Choose poorly, however, and you face the consequences of famine, plague, and poverty.
