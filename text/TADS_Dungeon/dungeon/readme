This stuff is a beta release now.  It has been stable, with very few
bugs reported.  Things are randomized now as well.

I have not checked on copyright restrictions, etc.  Just because
the Fortran stuff is free does not mean it isn't copyrighted.

Report any bugs, comments, etc, to djohnson@cs.ucsd.edu
