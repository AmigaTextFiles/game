@NODE INTR "Introduction"
@{BG SHINE}
    welcome to the world of interactive fiction!
@{BG BACK}
So how many text adventures are there around the world? mmm... let me 
count. 1.2.20.145..214... Okay, so there's a hell of a lot of them, and
just about all of them are pretty boring, and with most text adventures you
are given some text and a rather sad text input requester for you to type
`Go north' or `Go south' countless times. 

EAC is not like that at all. There's is no typing, and the adventure possibilities are endless, with it's AmigaGuide style programming language.
By using a simple text editor such as Ed or Transwrite, it is possible to easily create wonderful text adventures for PD release.
@{BG SHINE}
    so what can EAC do?
@{BG BACK}
With EAC it is possible to include IFF ILBM pictures into your text adventures, which quickly remap to your current workbench palette. Standard
tracker modules can also be added into your adventures to give them that
extra bit of atmosphere. You can also place items such as keys, weapons and
treasure in your adventures by using a simple variable system.
@{BG SHINE}
    so why EAC?
@{BG BACK}
One of my first games ever was a text adventure. Andrew Fitzgerald and I
produced a game called `Skool kids revenge' for the ZX Spectrum, and the
idea of it all was to walk around school and bash as many teachers as
possible. Although the game was never finished, and caused us great
trouble with the staff department, it was still kind of fun to play.
A few years later I got hooked on text adventure books by people such as
Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone, and it was their work that was a great
inspiration to me.

Having looked at lots of text adventure games, engines and interpreters 
such as Inform, TADS, Hugo and Level 9, I felt that there was something
missing from them all. Although most of the adventures were okay, the
interpreters were not very impressive at all. One thing which I hated 
most about these interpreters was the fact that you had to type north,
south, east and west hundreds, even thousands of times just to get any
where, making the whole thing just a big waste of time and very boring, 
so I designed EAC in a way that adventure books are created, by giving 
the player a limited amount of options to go somewhere or do something. 

Another thing which I could not really understand about these 
interpreters, was why the authors made the language for them very complex,
almost at a C++ level infact. Surely, a person wishing to write a text
adventure game would not spend days or even months. trying to figure out
how to code in the language first. EAC (I hope!) has a fairly basic
language, which can easily be understood. I like to think of it as a cross
between AmigaGuide® and BASIC.

@{BG SHINE}
    system requirements
@{BG BACK}
To run EAC you will require a system with at least the following
specification:

OS 2.00
1 MEG of RAM
Hard drive Reccomended

@ENDNODE

@NODE use "The EAC Environment"
@{BG SHINE}
    the eac environment
@{BG BACK}
This section briefly describes what each menu item and button does, 
however you should be able to learn how to use EAC quickly as it has
been designed for ease of use.
@{BG SHINE}
    `Adventure' menu
@{BG BACK}

Restart adventure   :   Allows you to restart any loaded adventure.
Load adventure      :   Loads an adventure file.
Reload adventure    :   Mainly for people developing adventures.
                        Simply reloads the entire adventure.
Save position       :   Allows you to save you current adventure 
                        position.
Load position       :   Load back any saved game positions.
About               :   Gives information about the program and the
                        currently loaded adventure code.
Quit                :   Quit from EAC

@{BG SHINE}
    `EAC' menu
@{BG BACK}
Edit Prefs          :   Brings up the preferences menu, which
                        allows you to alter the music volume,
                        colour remapping modes and other various
                        preferences. Note that image remapping
                        time takes longer if selected as BEST.

Save Prefs          :   Saves your preferences. Prefs are saved
                        to ENVARC: as EAC.prefs. Your ENVARC
                        should be an assign to:
                                    Sys:prefs/Env-archive
                        or something similar.

@{BG SHINE}
    `Info' menu
@{BG BACK}
Score               :   Displays score information (If available)

@{BG BACK}
Break               :   If you are stuck in a loop situation, then you
                        may use the Break menu item to stop EAC
                        processing the script.

@{BG SHINE}
    the buttons
@{BG BACK}
The only thing you will be needing to play a text adventure is the
six buttons at the bottom left hand corner of the window. Use these
buttons to go to different places, pick up items, activate switches
etc. A list telling you what each button will do or what affect it will
have on the adventure will usually be given.
@{BG SHINE}
    the `More' gadget
@{BG BACK}
The more gadget is used for adventures which have a lot of text, and is
used to un-pause scrolling text. A and onscreen prompt will usually inform
you that there is more text.

@{BG SHINE}
    commodity information
@{BG BACK}
EAC is now a commodity, meaning that you can make the interface appear
and disappear when ever needed. Simply use the hotkey: `LALT , LSHIFT and
E'. EAC will also appear in the Exchange listings.

    font sensitivity bugs?
@{BG BACK}
Where possible, I have tried to make EAC 100% font sensitive. v1.0 of EAC
had several bugs if the font size was over 8 points, I have now hopefully
fixed all of these problems, but however, if you do spot a bug in EAC, try
using an 8 point screen font - it might go away!. Please feel free to send
bug reports to us.

@NODE DEVE "Creating your own adventures"
@{BG SHINE}
    creating your own text adventures
@{BG BACK}
Hopefully, if EAC is a success, lots of different people will create
adventures for you to play with EAC. If this will happen, I don't really
know. I'll just have to wait for any feedback from this version. If you
would like to create your own adventures look in the Developers drawer, 
and hopefully there should be all the information there about programming
them.

If you create an adventure for EAC please do not hesitate to release it
into the public domain for other people to play, or you could even send 
us a copy of your adventure(s), which we may include along with the next
version of EAC.

You'll find a good few tutorials in the Developers drawer, which you
can load into a good text editor. Also read the UserManual.Guide
carefully for details about the EAC programming language.

Okay, lets get one thing straight. Any further developments of EAC will NOT
be released unless I get any kind of response from this version. So if you
like this program please contact me and say that you do! So at least I know
I am on to a good thing. If you don't, then I'm sorry, but EAC will most
likely die forever, and I will do something else :(
@{BG SHINE}
    coming soon... (maybe)

FONT            :   Hopefully I will add BOLD, ITALIC and UNDERLINE

TEXT GADGET     :   To allow you to speak to people.

            memory. This may solve any incompatibility problems
            with various accelerators.
