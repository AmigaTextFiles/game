Encryptor v1.5
--------------

Encryptor converts normal EAC scripts into an encrypted binary file 
format called EAC-2. There are three advantages of using Encryptor. 
The first is that your code is very secure, as it can't be viewed or
altered because it's all encrypted, making it very hard for people to 
cheat whilst playing your adventures. Secondly, EAC-2 files load around 
40% faster into EAC  than normal EAC scripts do, due to the fact that all
of the jump tables are contained within the code, this does however, make your code a tiny bit bigger. Finally, Encryptor now offers a new
advanced encryption format, which allows you to include ILBM's and
tracker modules into the code itself, making external data files a 
thing of the past!

Why include files?
------------------

Including all of your pictures and modules into your code means that
your adventure becomes just one code, and you no longer have to worry
about external files.

Is Encryptor a compiler?
------------------------

No. Encryptor only scrambles the data so that no one except EAC can
read it. Encryptor will not make executable files.

Disclaimer
----------

This program should only be used by advanced EAC coders. Make sure you
keep a copy of your source code when converting your adventure scripts!

Shareware
---------

Please note that you will only be able to use the Encryptor program
if you have registered EAC. Please read the shareware notice in the
EAC.guide for information about registering this software.
