AmiWelcome v2.0 - EAC release - By Matt Briggs - (C)E9D 1998
------------------------------------------------------------

AmiWelcome is a little program designed to display a message in a window
when you boot up your Amiga. It also allows you to have an ILBM pattern in
the window and to play an 8SVX sample when it loads up. Amiwelcome is a
CLI program and requires the following arguments for it to work:

AmiWelcome command areguments
-----------------------------

[MESSAGE]           : The message to display.

ILBM=[IFF Pattern]  : The window pattern to load into the window.
                      AmiWelcome attempts to remap the specified picture
                      to your current WB palette.

SOUND=[IFF 8SVX]    : The sound file to be played. Note that you will not
                      be able to quit until the sound has finished if the
                      sound file is OVER 127k. Don't ask me why.

AUTOQUIT            : Automatically quits when the sample has finished 
                      playing.

DEFMESS             : Displays the text `Welcome to Amiga Workbench 3.0'

RNDMESS             : Displays random text messages.

NOREMAP             : Stops AmiWelcome from remapping the picture.

PEN=[Pen colour]    : The colour of the displayed text. Note that colour
                      zero is transparent.

BACK=[colour]       : Then background colour of your text.

Information
-----------

If you have not specified an ILBM pattern or a SOUND file, then AmiWelcome
will automatically look in the SYS:PREFS/PRESETS directory for the ILBM
file AmiWelcome.iff and the sound AmiWelcome.snd

Amiwelcome will quit when the mouse is moved, unless AUTOQUIT is
specified, where it will wait until the sample has played and then quit.
