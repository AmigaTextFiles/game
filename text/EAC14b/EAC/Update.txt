What's new in v1.4/v1.4b
------------------------

v1.4    *   More bug fixes :)
        *   New encryption format, which allows you to
            include ILBMs and MODs into the encrypted
            code.
        *   Latest version of AmiWelcome 2 included with
            the EAC suite.
        *   Scalos/DOpus compatible.
v1.4b   *   Tracker handler de-bugged, which caused problems on
            various machines (apparently).
        *   DIV: (Divide) and MUL: (Multiply) commands added.
        *   Extensions to ADD: , SUB: , DIV: and MUL: . It is 
            now possible to do: ADD:[Variable]:[Variable] :)
        *   Bloody hell! The `Ignore colour' option now works 
            properly!
        *   EAC is now a commodity, allowing you to make the
            interface appear and disappear using the hotkey:
            `LALT, LSHIFT and E'
        *   The Default text and background colour can now be 
            altered.
        *   Improved IFF ILBM scrolling :)
        *   New `DEBUG' mode, which forces EAC to use only chip
            memory. This may solve any incompatibility problems
            with various accelerators. Read the guides for more
            information.
