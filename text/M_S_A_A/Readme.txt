1) Introduction

 Hello there! Welcome to the guide to Minnesota Smith's Aztec Adventure.
I hope to make this guide well-written and informative. You may have noticed
that it's supplied in two versions, a simple ascii version and an Amigaguide
version for those who can handle it.

 So, what is Minnesota Smith's Aztec Adventure? It's one of those games that
used to be known as "text adventures," but which are now known as 
Interactive Fiction. If you've never played one before I suggest you read
the section A Beginners Guide To Text Adventures. Of course, first of all
I'd read the Introductory Story, as this will give you an idea of who
Minnesota Smith is and what the adventure is about.

 For those of you expecting a serious adventure, sorry, but this game is for
fun only! There are plenty of jokes in the adventure. I'm especially proud
of the fact that you can examine just about everything - I spent ages 
putting in descriptions of everything I could think of.

 I'm a little worried that this game might be a little short. It has 60
locations to explore, including a 23-room maze. However, in playtesting
it didn't take very long to complete. Therefore I'm already working on a
new challenge for Minnesota to take on, one that will be absolutely 
MASSIVE!

 Thanks for playing my game. I hope you enjoy it!

2) Introductory Story

 It started, as it always did, with a job offer. And with a woman.

 The director of the British Museum didn't approach Minnesota Smith himself.
Instead, knowing Minnesota's weak spots, he sent women.

 The latest was a Reader in Ancient History. Her name was Anna. She was 
beautiful, brunette, buxom and, basically, babelicious, and she sat 
patiently in the living room of Minnesota's flat while he made a cup of tea.

 Minnesota Smith was an explorer and an adventurer. He had modelled himself
on his personal idol, a famous celluloid adventurer with a similar name.
Minnesota had a fedora, a leather jacket and a bullwhip. He didn't come from
America, but figured that was a minor point which could probably be ignored.

 He lived in what would be a posh apartment in a good area of London. Unfor-
tunately Minnesota's personal habits had reduced it to a level somewhere 
near Pigsty. Not the best way to impress Anna, but Minnesota wasn't worried.
At least she liked tea.

 Minnesota poured a cup for Anna (black, no sugar) and one for himself (very
white, so much sugar the spoon stood upright in the mug) and carried the
two mugs into the living room, where Anna was sitting on a spot she'd 
cleared herself on the sofa. She glanced around the apartment, taking in the
beer cans, the pile of unwashed laundry and the large stack of pizza boxes.
"Nice place you've got here," she lied.
 
 "Thanks," said Minnesota, handing her a mug. She smiled, took a sip of tea,
and grimaced. Minnesota carried on reguardless.

 "So, what's the job?" he asked, flopping down into an armchair.

 Anna carefully placed the mug down on a nearby table which actually turned 
out to be a tea-tray stacked on top of a pile of FHM issues. She steepled
her fingers.

 "We've come across a plan for an ancient aztec temple," she said. "The 
temple is situated in the middle of dense jungle and is said to be the home
of a legendary fabulous treasure."

 "What kind of treasure?"

 "Er... our research drew a bit of a blank on that one." Anna sighed. "The
director sent me here to request your help."

 "Really?" said Minnesota, smiling smugly. "He sent you here because he
knew he needed the adventuring, trap-beating, temple-exploring skills of
Minnesota Smith, did he?"

 "No," said Anna. "He said 'Go and get that Minnesota Smith, noone else 
would be stupid enough to fall for the idea.'"

 Minnesota laughed. So did Anna, after a while.

 
 Anna had booked a private charter on a plane which would fly them to a
private airfield near the reputed site of the temple. She'd already made
contact with a local who claimed to have seen the temple as a young man,
and who could guide Minnesota to it now.

 She spent the entire plane journey pouring over piles of books, and seemed
quite happy to do so. Minnesota, on the other hand, was a little 
dissappointed. Usually the heroine (Every hero had to have a heroine, and 
although Anna seemed a little more straight-headed than the women he was
used to, Minnesota was prepared to let her count as one) had given into his
manly charms by now. Usually plane journeys were spent seeing how far the
seats would go back. But Anna was more interested in academia. Minnesota was
more than a little discouraged.

 The plane journey was long and boring, and Minnesota was glad when they 
touched down at the private airfield. After they'd unloaded Anna's books
they telephoned a for taxi. The car that arrived had, apparently, once been 
one of New York's yellow-cabs. Quite what it was doing in the darkest depths
of South America Minnesota couldn't even begin to guess. Anyway, it wasn't a
yellow-cab any more, more of a muddy-cab.

 The car took them to a local village, where Minnesota met the guide. His
name was Salami. Salami seemed friendly enough, except for the distinctive
odour which followed him around and, occasionnally, reached places before
he did. Apparently Salami had been playing in the forest as a child and had
become lost. He had wandered near to the temple before coming across some
distinctly dodgy-looking statues and running all the way back to the 
village. Village elders had warned him that he had encroached upon a sacred
site, and that if he ever returned his feet would be burnt off, and maggots
would crawl into his eyes, and the ghosts of his ancestors would eat his
living soul, and that his bones would become as boiling lead, and that his
brain would melt and run out of his nose, although apparently the large
cash incentives offered to him by the museum were proof against some events
occuring now.

 It was decided that Anna would stay in the village to do further research,
and that she and Minnesota would stay in contact by radio. Minnesota and
Salami, and two local boys who the guide had employed to carry the luggage,
would leave in the morning.


 The next morning Minnesota, Salami and the two luggage-carriers stood at
the edge of the village. The journey to the temple would take less than a
day, but Minnesota had insisted on taking plenty of food and water as they
didn't know how long they'd stay there.

 He turned to Anna. "Well, I guess this is it. I'll keep in contact with 
you over the radio," he said, before turning away.

 "Minnesota," Anna called, and he turned back to her. She walked slowly up
to him. "I... just in case I don't see you again, I just wanted to say..."

 "It's alright, there's no need to say it," said Minnesota. He placed his
hand under Anna's chin and tilted her head up so she was looking at him.
"I know exactly how you feel about me," he said, and Anna smiled. "It's
okay," he continued. "We can still do it later."

 "Do what?" asked Anna.

 "Er, have sex," said Minnesota, aware that the conversation wasn't leading
quite where he'd thought it would.

 "Have sex?" Anna took a step back. "I don't want to have sex with you! I
just meant that I no longer thought that you were a total idiot - although
I think I've changed my mind!"

 Anna turned and stormed off back to the village. Minnesota was aware of 
laughing behind him, and turned round to see Salami and the two boys
sniggering unashamedly.

 "Come on, let's get going," he shouted, hefting the radio onto his back.
He stalked off into the forest, followed by the two boys.

 "...have sex..."

 "Shut up!"


 It was almost mid-day when trouble hit them.

 It started when Salami spotted a rare snake, one which apparently was a
harbinger of bad luck. He spent several minutes gibbering about boiling lead
before Minnesota bought him back to his senses by slapping him with a bunch
of rolled-up bank notes.

 Then one of the boys tripped over a lemur and badly sprained his ankle. The
other boy had to help him back to the village. That left Minnesota and 
Salami to carry the rest of the luggage.

 Just after mid-day Salami motioned for Minnesota to stop. they crouched
down behind a tree.

 "This area filled with traps," explained Salami. "Very dangerous. Lucky
for you that I am best guide in South America! I know where all traps are,
get you through them no problem."

 He stood up and took one step before a piece of ground shifted under his
feet. "Oh dear..." he said before a branch came swinging out of the 
undergrowth and impaled him through the neck on a long spike.

 Minnesota stood up and walked carefully across to where Salami hung, 
impaled on the spike. He waved his hand in front of the guide's face. 
"Salami? Hello?" he said.

 No answer was forthcoming. Minnesota pulled the radio microphone out of his
pocket and pressed down the send button. "Minn to Anna, Minn to Anna, come
in Anna."

 Anna's voice, distorted by the radio, came back to him via the ear-phones
he was wearing. "Anna recieving, what the hell's happenned now, over?"

 "There's been a bit of an accident, over." Minnesota winced.

 "What kind of accident, over?"

 "The native-guide-being-impaled-through-the-neck-by-ancient-trap kind, 
over."

 Anna's next word was luckily obscured by static. "Now what?" she asked.

 "Now," said Minnesota, "It's just you and me. Over."

 "What?"

 "We can still uncover that fabulous treasure, but I'll need you to guide
me. You okay with that?"

 "I suppose so..."

 "Good." Dropping the luggage, Minnesota steeled his nerves, took one last 
glance at Salami, and set off down the path towards the temple.



3) A Beginners Guide To Adventures

 Blimey, this section could be very, very long. There's so much to be said
about text adventures, and I certainly haven't got enough time to go into
all the details, but I'll try to cover the main details here.

 Text adventures are just that. They let you wander around a series of 
linked rooms collecting objects and solving puzzles, but everything is
described to you in text, and the only way you have of controlling the game
is via text input.

 For instance, a room description might be:

 You are standing in the living room of your house. There's a roaring fire
in the grate, and you are surrounded by comfortable furniture. A door to
the east leads into the kitchen, whilst another to the north leads out into
the hall.

 You can also see:

    Your wallet


 From this room description you can do several basic things. To move to
another room you would type in the direction you wanted to travel, in this
case east or north. In most adventure games the directions can be 
abbreviated to N, S, E and W (North, South, East and West). Some games 
support Up and Down directions, and some also support NE, NW, SE and SW
(North-East, North-West, South-East and South-West).

 You can also do some things with your wallet. To pick it up, you would
type in GET WALLET or TAKE WALLET. If you decided that you didn't want it
after all you would type in DROP WALLET. You could examine it using the
command EXAMINE WALLET. That could bring up a message such as:

 The wallet is made from brown leather and looks quite expensive.

 
 In our imaginary game, you will need a front door key which is kept in the
wallet. You would therefore type in OPEN WALLET, which would bring up the
message:

 You open the wallet to find the front door key. So that's where you left
it!


 All basic interaction with text adventures is done in this way. Some more
advanced text adventures may have limited graphical interfaces, allowing
you to choose a direction by clicking on a compass, for instance, or using
objects by clicking on pictures of them.

 The text interface is called the Parser. This is a list of all the commands
that you can type in that the computer will recognise. Basic parser commands
are as follows:

 North     : Move one room North
 South     : Move one room South
 East      : Move one room East
 West      : Move one room West
 				and so on for other directions...
 Take      : Pick up an object
 Drop      : Drop an object already carried
 Examine   : Describe an object in greater detail.
 Inventory : Brings up a list of items you have collected
 Dig       : Dig in the current location
 Push      : Push an object or part of the scenery
 Pull      : Pull an object or part of the scenery
 Eat       : Eat an object
 Drink     : Drink an object
 In        : Enter a building
 Out       : Exit a building
 
 Not all of these commands are use by this game, and there are further 
commands that are used which aren't listed here. If you get stuck there's
a listing of commands in the @{"Help" link help} section - however, you 
should only use that list as a last resort.



4) About This Game

 There are a few things you should know about this game before playing it.

 Firstly, it consists of sixty rooms, including a maze, so making a map 
would be a good idea.

 If you've read the @{"Introductory Story" link story} (and if you haven't, why not?) you'll
know that Minnesota and Anna were talking over a radio. Well, in this 
adventure you don't play Minnesota, you take the very important part of 
Anna (but I'm sure someone will make you put it back). The game is played
as if you are back at base-camp talking to Minnesota over the radio. That's
why he's got to describe everything to you, see...

 You can examine just about everything, and there are clues to the uses of
objects in their descriptions. Sometimes the description will include a
word which can be used in the parser.

 The system I've used to program the game will only accept two words. So
there's no "Pour water on fire", it's just "Pour water".

 This game supports Save and Load functions. Just type in Save to save
your game, and Load to load one.

 There are several red herrings in the game - to see what they are (or
Cheat, as it's known in the trade) see the Help section.

 Finally, you may notice that the objects in the game aften have one word
in their name with a capital letter, such as "a small brass Key". The long
description is because there may be one key in the game, but to keep the 
parser as straightforward as possible, the word with the capital letter is
the only one you need to deal with the object.


5) Requirements

 I couldn't really give you a definitive list, but this game has been
tested on a 1meg A500 and a 10meg A1200, so it should work on just about
everything.


6) Installation

 Installing this game to a hard drive couldn't be simpler. All you have to 
do is drag all the files to the same location. If you get this game in a 
drawer (I'm not sure how CD-roms are compiled - archived or not) then drag
the entire drawer - it'll be simpler.



7) Help Section

 This Help section is divided off into smaller sections to make navigation
easier. It contains several levels of help, from simple tips for those who 
don't wan't to spoil the game too much to the complete solution for those
who are completely stuck.

 The Hints section is just that. The Commands listing is for people who want
to know in general what commands the parser will accept. The Red Herrings
lists the objects you don't need.

 But remember, give the game a go first. Don't resort to cheating unless you
really have to!

7.1) Hints
7.2) Commands List
7.3) Red Herrings
7.4) The Complete Solution



7.1) Hints

 Examine everything!

 Don't worry if you fall into a trap, you're meant to.

 A picture tells a thousand words...

 Think of how you can get rid of vampires...

 Gitter Snakes and Winkle Birds don't get on.

 Scarlet fish - think about it!

 That guano is a load of poo!

 If two short planks were once one long plank then, with the right stuff,
they could be again.

 That statue might move...



7.2) Commands List

 This list does not include the directional commands, and is in no 
particular order.

 TAKE, DROP, EXAMINE, EAT, DIG, INSERT, PRESS, JOIN, UNLOCK, READ, POUR,
FILL, WEAR, PULL, PUSH, BLESS, TICKLE, REMOVE, TIE, JUMP, CROSS, DIE, COMMIT



7.3) Red Herrings

 The following itens are red herrings:

 An aztec Mask
 A scarlet Fish
 Some Guano

 Further more, in one location there is a sign which reads "Now wash your 
hands." It is not important, and was just placed in there for comedic 
effect. Ha. Ha. Ha.



7.4) Complete Solution

 This solution is the quickest way of completing the game. However, if you 
play it straight through you'll miss many of the descriptions, and therefore
much of the humour. Use this as a guide, therefore, and examine everything.

9) About Me And The Game

 My name is Chris Spicer. This game was written over a period of about a 
year, with huge gaps in between bouts of working on the project. My spare
time has been split between working on this, writing reviews for an Amiga
fanzine, writing and drawing comics, drinking, reading, and generally
messing around on my Amiga, an A1200 which I love dearly. Oh yeah, and
having major facial surgery.

 What next? Well, I already have ideas for the next Minnesota Smith game, so
hopefully I'll start work on that soon. Look out for it.

 If you want to write to me for any reason (as long as it's not to write 
abusive letters about how short the game is) send your letters to:

11) An Advert!

 I've been writing reviews for a P.D. fanzine called The Domain. Well, the
Domain has been forced to close, but a new fanzine is being launched. It 
will mostly be dedicated to gaming, and will include commercial and P.D. 
reviews. As I'm writing this a title has yet to be confirmed, but for more
details you can write to:
