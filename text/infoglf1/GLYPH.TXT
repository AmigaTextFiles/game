GLYPH's Inform Hack version 1
=============================

The infoglf1 archive should contain the following files:

"glyph.txt"     - This file
"ggrammar.h"    - Modified grammar.h
"gparser.h"     - Modified parser.h
"gparserm.h"    - Modified parserm.h
"genglish.h"    - Modified english.h


Purpose & Motivation:
=====================
I've been working on my own text adventure engine for a few years, but
when I learned about the Z machine standard I decided to go with Inform.
Inform, as a text adventure authoring language, is exquisite, and the
included parser is handy for getting started quickly.  However, there are
a few features I had built into my parser which are missing in Inform's.
I found I missed them dearly, so I have taken the liberty of adding some
of them to Inform's parser.


What does it do?
================
The modifications I have whipped up extend Inform's standard parser to
include some nifty handy features:

Better handling of AND and THEN
-------------------------------
"Take the box and then open it" works now.
"Take and open the box" works now.
"Pick up the box and the ball and open the box and look in it" works now.
"Take and open the book and the box and put the book in the box" works too.

Better handling of multiple subjects
------------------------------------
Most verbs now allow multiple subjects, like "Look at all".  To keep
things fair, daemons are allowed to run between actions, but only if the
action took time to do.

For example, if you had a Rat daemon going and you typed "open all", you
might get something like this:

Book: Opened.                               <- it worked so it took time
The rats are chewing on your foot.          <- this is the Rat daemon
Table: That's not something you can open.   <- no time taken so no daemon
Door: Opened.                               <- took time
The rats are still chewing on your foot.    <- that Rat daemon again


How do I use it?
================
This is easy.  If you are writing a game in Inform, that wonderful
language by Graham Nelson, all you have to do is the following:

- Put my .h files in your Inform directory, along with the other .h files.
- In your .inf file, change Include "parser" to Include "gparser".
- Also in your .inf file, change Include "grammar" to Include "ggrammar".
- Recompile your .inf file.

Bingo.

You may want to compile "gparserm.h" into a module if you're using
modules.  (They allow faster compilation, see the Inform documentation)

Note that gparser.h is not dependant on ggrammar.h, so if you only want
the better parsing, and you don't want all the extra multi-subject verbs,
simply change "ggrammar" back to "grammar".
