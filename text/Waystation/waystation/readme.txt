                                  Waystation
                                  --======--

Waystation is a piece of interactive fiction (aka a text adventure) written
using TADS.  Waystation is a TADS .gam file.  Bad news: this means you need
a copy of the TADS runtime code, which can be found via anonymous ftp at
ftp.gmd.de in the directory if-archive/programming/tads.  Good news: this
also means that you can play Waystation on any platform for which TADS
has been ported.  You'll need TADS v2.2 or later.

If you have played text adventures before, you shouldn't have any problems
with Waystation. It will understand commands like:

  look
  go west (can be abbreviated as "w")
  open drawer
  unlock door with key
  open it (would refer to the door above)
  pour liquid on umbrella
  type "foo" on keyboard

One note, to save you some angst and frustration.  There are several keypads
in the Waystation universe.  To type a number on them, you HAVE to surround
the number in quotation marks.  If you don't, you won't get the results you're
after.  For example:

  type "3" on keypad


Some shorthand commands that might be useful are:

  x - examine
  l - look
  i - inventory (list everything you are carrying)
  g - again (redo last command)
  z - wait (do nothing for one minute)
  n, w, s, e, nw, sw, se, ne, u, d - move in different directions

You can use multiple objects if you separate them with commas:

  examine dragon, robot and black box

You can use the words "all" and "both" to refer to multiple objects.  You can
also use the word "it" to refer to the last noun you referenced:

  get box and open it

                               About Waystation
                               ---==========---

Waystation is freeware.  Copy it, distribute it, whatever you like, as long as
you don't modify it or remove 1) my name or 2) the TADS acknowledgement line.
However, for $10 US, I'll send you a disk with the latest version of Waystation
on it (including built-in hints) and the source code.  (Please note that
neither of these latter two things is freeware/shareware.)  The money is to
cover postage, plus a little to help me defray the cost of TADS and the time
I spent writing Waystation.

I'm an interactive-fiction buff, and I'd love to hear from others who feel
the same way about IF.  Please drop me a line telling me how you liked the
game, or what you thought needed improvement.  If you need a hint, try asking
around on the Usenet group rec.games.int-fiction.  The gang there is usually
willing to give help.

The easiest way to reach me is on the Internet.  My address is

I'd also appreciate snail mail.  My address is

Hope you enjoy the game!

                                 --=======--

Here's where I thank all the people who helped me iron out many of the bugs
which plagued early beta versions of Waystation:

Paul Gilbert, Anders Haavie, Ville Lavonius, Stephen Tjasink, Drew Vogel.

And very special thanks go to Michael Kinyon, first to complete Waystation
and finder of many MANY bugs, and Michael Self, who put up with me bouncing
ideas off him at a rapid rate.  To all these guys and many more besides, I
owe a great debt of gratitude.
