This is an AmigaOS 4.0 build of TexteElite, based on the AROS build of Ian Bell's 
text version of `Elite'; built from Duane McDonnell's (<dmcdon@bigfoot.com>) 
Amiga-version sources.

This is a modified version which implements commander load, save and reset 
commands as well as some minor changes to the text output. This version is 
called Text Elite.

The original version is in the `src/Original/' directory, and should build
cleanly on any ANSI C compiler (AFAIK, I haven't tried).

The `.readme' file included with the Amiga distribution is in the `src/'
directory. The Amiga version can be found on aminet.

I've just made one small change: I changed a `gets()' in the parser loop in 
`main()' to `fgets()'.

To compile on Linux, remove the line that says "typedef uint16 uint;" 
(line #71).
