Welcome to the Acme Institute!

Congratulations on having been admitted to Unnkulia's most
prestigious university!  We pride ourselves on our thoroughly
modern teaching methods and the fine education we provide for our
students.  Our graduates are prized by employers for their amazing
creativity and dogged determination to succeed even when faced with
ridiculous obstacles and frustrated beyond belief.  You won't find
600 students all trying to get into Intro to Computer Science, or 5
people squished into a dorm room built for two... there are no
classes or dormitories!  This is no diploma mill where you can't
tell one Institute graduate from another.  In order to obtain a
degree, each student faces a unique challenge that will shape his
or her educational experience here ate the Acme Institute.

Our campus is set on 72 acres of beautiful woodland just north of
the capital city.  It's a far cry from the treeless, barren plains
of Western Unnkulia, whence most of our students hail.  So, please,
make yourself at home!  Experience our forests, architecturally
diverse buildings, world renowned garden maze, and fishpond. 
Admire the local wildlife.  Or just stroll around the grassy
courtyard and listen to the words of wisdom that our now-senile but
once-famous faculty may still utter from time to time.

	Looking forward to meeting you,

		Dean Chiquita
