This disk contains a distribution of ADL (Adventure Definition Language).
ADL is a superset of an older language named DDL, by Michael Urban,
Chris Kostanick, Michael Stein, Bruce Adler, and Warren Usui.  ADL
enhancements were made by Ross Cunniff, who submitted this material
for inclusion in the library.  The disk is essentially unchanged except
that:

	(1)	Many icon files have been added to help workbench only
		users get at least some information about this disk
		and about ADL (which is only usable from the CLI 
		environment).

	(2)	The disk name has been changed to AmigaLibDisk91.

	(3)	The standard library files "GeneralInfo", "Contents",
		and "Distribution", along with their associated icons,
		have been added to the disk.

	(4)	The directory 'c' has been added, along with a very
		nice text reader program called "less", which is the
		default tool for reading all the text files for which
		there are icons.

Included here are the sources to the ADL compiler, interpreter, and
debugger.  The binaries were compiled by Ross with the Lattice 3.03
compiler.  Ross noted in his letter that currently ADL is a
CLI environment program only, but that he hopes to offer a more
Amiga'ized version in the future.  Also, the stack size should be
set to at least 10000 before attempting to run ADL.
