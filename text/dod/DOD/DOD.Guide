 Your quest, if you choose to except it, is to travel to the Dungeon of 
Doom, which is situated at the top of a mountain, guarded by Orcs and the 
only way to get there is to pay the ferryman his asking amount, but if you 
don`t you will die, or you will meet a congration of wizards in a pub! But 
maybe you are wondering how you pay the ferryman, well, he is a con man, 
unless you have killed the Imp in the hut (by the road side) he will ask
for more than what you have!
 Well, thats the story, that is what you must do. Have I spoiled it now? Oh
well, please e-mail me if you actually like this! (wrecker98@geocities.com)
 Oh, this is a text-based adventure with a few pictures stuffed in from 
various authors. Thanx guys!

 As far as I know, this will work on a standard A1200, you will need a copy
of Amos.Library either in your Libs: or in a directory Libs/ which is in 
the same drawer/partion as the main DOD executable file.

 To play you use the keyboard, pressing the letters in the [ ] brackets 
to do the desired thing, its simple really. 

 In-game keys are as follows:

 LEFT-AMIGA + A : Flicks between Workbench and DOD.
 CTRL + C       : Quit the program at any time.

   In the future I want your feedback, a want to know if anyone actually 
likes it, I want some ideas for the second part, if I get enough feedback, 
then i`ll continue developing this game.

 What a really need is some talented artists who could draw me something, 
anything will do, so long as its good, i`ll except it and weave that 
picture into the game.
