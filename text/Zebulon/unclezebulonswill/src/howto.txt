How To Compile "Uncle Zebulon's Will"
=====================================

This is a source code release, intended primarily as an example for
TADS programmers. Despite the small size of the game, the code contains
some interesting solutions which you may want to imitate - or which you
may want to avoid (examples of how not to do things are often as
valuable as examples of how to do them).

If you want to play the game as is, the simplest way is to download one
of the pre-compiled versions (see the release notes for details).

Should you wish to compile the code yourself, you need a copy of the
TADS compiler version 2.2. The game won't compile with earlier
versions. It will probably compile with later versions as well, but as
no such versions are available at the moment I can't make promise
anything. 

The source code utilizes the standard TADS libraries std.t and adv.t,
as distributed together with the TADS compiler version 2.2. As with
the compiler, the code may not work with other versions.

Just to be on the safe side legally, let me add that I do not
guarantee that this code will compile with *any* version of the
compiler, nor do I make any guarantees about the performance or
correctness of the generated code. It does compile with my version of
the compiler, however. 

The TADS compiler is available for a variety of popular operating
systems. It can be downloaded from
ftp://ftp.gmd.de/if-archive/programming/tads. 

On most systems, the command to compiler "Uncle Zebulon's Will" is

tadsc zebulon

Some DOS versions of the compiler are called tc rather than tadsc.

This will produce a system-independent game file, zebulon.gam. To run
this, you need the TADS runtime, which is distributed together with
the compiler.


Finally, a few words about the code itself. The main source module,
zebulon.t, includes the remaining code automatically when compiled.
All the files ending in .t must be present in the current directory
when compiling.
