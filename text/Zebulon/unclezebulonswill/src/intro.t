    "\(Uncle Zebulon's Will\) by Magnus Olsson (mol@df.lth.se)\b

    The news of your uncle Zebulon's death came as a shock. You've
    been out of touch lately, and since you left for college a year ago 
    you haven't heard a word from him. During your childhood, however, 
    your eccentric uncle - once the black sheep of the family, 
    an unsuccessful alchemist and self-proclaimed wizard, reputed
    to be a very wealthy man - was your 
    favourite relative. Perhaps you were his favourite nephew as 
    well. You miss his stories of distant realms and the magic gadgets
    he loved to demonstrate...\b
    
    \tYou leave for home immediately on receiving the message, but the
    trip is long and you're delayed by the inevitable train strikes. When
    you finally arrive, you find your family in a state of frustrated
    confusion. Not only is your uncle's will written in a quite
    unsuitably sarcastic tone,
    seriously insulting most of your relatives, but it turns out there 
    isn't much of an inheritance to fight over; despite a thorough 
    search of your uncle's house, no fabulous treasures are found.
    The bequests for you and your cousins are almost pathetic:
    one small memento each, to be selected after everybody else have
    made their choices. Yet what is there to lose? At least you'd like
    to have one last look at uncle Zeb's house; maybe you'll find some
    treasure overlooked by the others, perhaps something magical...
