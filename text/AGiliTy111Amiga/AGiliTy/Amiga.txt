AGiliTy 1.1.1 for the Amiga
---------------------------

This is the Amiga version of Robert Masenten's interpreter for AGT games,
AGiliTy. Please send comments or queries about this Amiga port to me, David
Kinder (davidk@monis.co.uk) and general questions about AGiliTy to Robert
(rcm-math@pacbell.net).

Starting AGiliTy
----------------

The following Workbench tooltype is supported:

    DIR		This sets the initial directory for the file requester
		which opens when the interpreter is started from
		Workbench, e.g.

			DIR=Work:Games/AGTGames

Menus
-----

The AGiliTy window has a Project menu attached to it, with the following
items:

    New Game	Opens a file requester from which a new game can be
		loaded. This will erase the game currently in memory,
		so make sure your position is saved.

    Save	Saves the current state of the loaded game.

    Restore	Restores the state of the loaded game.

    About	Shows version information and credits.

    Quit	Exits AGiliTy.

Other Features
--------------

AGiliTy supports the sound effects used in some AGT games (e.g. Cosmoserve).
To enable, make sure that "tone" is set either in the global configuration
file "agil.cfg", or in the configuration file for the game. It is also
necessary to type "sound on" in the game to enable sounds.
