   You enter Sepulchre Wood - so called because of all the brave young
   adventurers just like yourself who have, in one way or another, been 
   laid to rest within it's boundaries. It is greatly advised that a map
   is made of Sepulchre Wood highlighting clearings and markings of 
   importance.  All clearings are numbered for your reference and all 
   distances are multiples of five (unless otherwise stated) for ease
   of mapping.  Your mission will become apparent when you find the wizard
   Haddagon who has been encarcerated within the forest by the evil
   necromancer Zephilis.   Zephilis' superior magic keeps Haddagon locked
   up and doomed to a life of being fed by goblins.
    Sword sheathed comfortably by your side you walk north into
   Sepulchre Wood.

    Sepulchre Wood is a @{i}Fighting Fantasy@{ui} - style adventure.  It is 
played in exactly the same way (i.e. Dice, scoresheet, etc.). For the 
rules click @{"here" link "here" 0}.  It is almost essential that a map is made of 
Sepulchre Wood, and landmarks, clearing numbers, etc carefully marked.
@endnode

@node "here" "here"

@{u}Rules:@{uu}
    The first thing you must do is arm yourself with a pen, paper and 
    two dice.  Go on!
        Mark the paper thus -

    Skl | Sta | Luk |          Items         |        Battles
        |     |     |             |
        |     |     |             | Him(St)  Him(St) 
        |     |     |             | -------  -------
        |     |     |             |         
        |     |     |             |               
    Next you must work out your Skill, Stamina and Luck values.
    Roll a die and add 6.  This represents your skill.  Roll
    two dice and add 12 for your stamina, finally roll 1 die and
    add 6 for your luck.  You start with 3 Gold Pieces (You will
    come across others on your travels) and 5 ration packs, which
    restore 4 stamina points each and may be eaten at any time
    in the game.

@{u}Battle:@{uu}

    When faced with a creature to slaughter, the text will give you two
    values.  These represent the creatures Skill and Stamina.
    You begin by rolling one die and adding your current Skill.  You 
    repeat the process using the creatures Skill and whoever gets the 
    lowest score loses two stamina points until they be dead! 
    You may face more than one foe, in which case you fight them
    one by one (without stopping for a bite to eat, might I add!).
@endnode

@node "luck" "luck"
@{u}Luck:@{uu}

    From time to time you will be asked to test your luck.  Throw
    both dice.  If the resultant number is higher than your luck, 
    you are unlucky and will probably die!  Each time you test your
    luck, deduct 1 point at the end.  You will be awarded further
    luck points as you play.
    Skill testing is carried out in the same way, but the value remains
    the same unless you are instructed to increase or decrease it.

    This game was written in 1993 on paper and Amiga-ised on12 march
1998. Some aspects of the game translated badly to the computer.  Eg, in 
the book I had the Doctor available on call by flipping to a specified page,
but for that to work in Amigaguide, I'd have to have his call number on 
every page - not to mention the obvious pen-and-paper / dice issue.

Somehow you calm down the Sputnik and explain that you have no intention of
attacking him, but have a quest to complete.  He apologises for attempting
to slice off your head and in return tells you of a secret passage from
clearing 16 to clearing 22.  When you reach C16 if you wish to use the 
secret passage, click on "Sputnik".
Beware when entering clearing 6 again, as Sputniks have very short-term
memories and this one will surely attack you again!

    You need not answer.  She knows you do not have the flower.  She
    raises her hands and lightning dances upon her fingertips.  "Stay

    fingers, but in your hypnotic state you are powerless to jump
    aside.  You take the full force of the blow.  Lose 1 skill and 5
    stamina points.  If you are still alive, you get up and stagger
