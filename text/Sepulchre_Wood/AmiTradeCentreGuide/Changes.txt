David Erman for the swedish catalogs and installer texts.

27.05.2000 V1.2 final Release
=============================
- Doubleclicking a running but not connected server now connects the server
  instead of making a copy of it and connecting this copy.

- A random string was shown in error-requesters if a lib or something else
  couldn't be opened/was not found.
  [Markus Lunk]

- Added all register groups to the cycle chain (TAB cycling).
  [Markus Lunk]

- Added experimental proxy support.  Thanks to Linus McCabe for his
  explainations on how to implement proxy support.
  [Linus McCabe]

- Filerequester structure for the profiles-requester was not freed at
  the end of the program.

- Now uses asl.library instead of reqtools.library for file requesters.
  [Markus Lunk]

18.05.2000 V1.2 PreRelease 2
============================
- Fixed some typos and inconsistencies in the english catalog descriptions.
  Thanks to David Erman for his efforts.

- Added swedish catalogs and catalog translations by David Erman.

- Batchsize is recalculated if one is downloading files with an unknown
  filesize (e.g.  Aminet Charts readme's)
  [Ingo Musquinier]

- ProFTPD 1.2.0pre6 is sending a non-common filesize when resuming a
  download. Added a check for this.
  [Sascha Glade]

- Updated both german and english documentation to represent the last state
  of development.

- Installerscript now also supports swedish.
  [updated by Ingo Musquinier, translation by David Erman]

- Fixed a bug in the current transfer list which prevented ATC to calculate
  the time and the finished time correctly.

- The different texts in the transferpage and the gauge now only gets
  updated if the corresponding value has changed.  Should be more efficient
  now.

- The checkmarks in the prefs now also support shortcuts.
  [Pascal Chiozzi]

- The ADT-Flags for every server were not taken from these serverentries
  when the profiles were saved but instead from the active serverentry.
  [Magnus Bouvin/Marcin Juszkiewicz]

- Removed a bug that caused enforcerhits when connecting to a server and a
  specific message from the ServerManager appeared before the HEREIAM-message
  from the trader.

- Connecting to an ADT-Server, changing the ADT-new date, disconnecting and
  reconnecting again caused the date slider to be immoveable. Fixed.

- Now the transfer gauge is also be updated if one is downloading with
  high bandwidth and a relative slow cpu.
  [David Erman]

- The freediskspace-gauge now gets updated everytime the transfer page is
  updated. (before it was updated everytime a buffer was written to disk)
  [David Erman]

06/09.05.2000 V1.1 final Release a.k.a PreRelease8
==================================================
- Improved check for ram:/ram disk:.  Thanks to Roland "Ronni" Hopfer for
  providing example code and useful hints.

- FTP TYPE command won't be send any longer if the type doesn't change.

- Changed the way the ftp.lib checks the result of ABOR command and EOT.
  Should be more compatible now.

- Serverlist was ghosted if the first entry of a .profile file was a list
  and marked as the active server.  (very strange, dunno why it happened.
  Just set MUIA_Listtree_Quiet, FALSE below MUIA_Listtree_Active and now it
  seems to work without any problem)
  [Jeff German/Jeff Klein/Magnus Bouvin/Pascal Chiozzi/Luca Longone]

- When changing the mode of a disconnected but running serverentry and then
  connecting this server, the GUI was not changed to the new mode.

- Moved the ADT switches (dl readmes, keep dirtree..) to the "Server" group
  in the main prefs, because they serve as server defaults since PreRelease3.

- Fixed a little bug that prevented ATC to set the active server if one
  were using the non-patched listtree.mcc.

- If one adds a server to a closed group, the group is now opened before
  the new entry is added.

30.04.2000 V1.1 PreRelease 7
============================
- Changed some german help bubble texts.

- Moved the popup-window from "more" button (visible if server was set to
  ADT-mode) to an own tab.

- The queuesize wasn't calculated correctly after removing entries from the
  queue.
  [Linus McCabe]

- Credits in the about window were cut off on the right side on some
  configurations.
  [Luca "Hexaae" Longone]

- Seconds only were calculated for "Finished"-time in current transfer list
  (ServerManager) and resulted in something like 195:43:32 for the time.
  Fixed.

- Removed a bug in poslist stuff (remembering and selecting of entries in
  already visited directories) that caused enforcerhits and lockups in rare
  situations.

- If ATC was started from "Ram Disk:" no Trader could be started because of
  the space in the volume name. Fixed.
  [Denis Zwornarz]

- The "not enough free diskspace"-requester won't be opened any longer if
  the download directory is "ram:" or "ram disk:"
  [Oliver Förster]

- Serverlist in ServerManager is now the default/active object for the
  window and receives keyboard input by default.  So there's no need to cycle
  through all the objects to use the keyboard to control the listview.
  [Georges Goncalves]

- Listviews for ADT or remote directory list are now made the active
  objects for the trader window.
  [Georges Goncalves]

- Directorycache for servers with the same comment/port were using the same
  directory for caching. Fixed.
  [Georges Goncalves]

- Batchentries now consuming 5 times less memory than before.

- Localized sliderclass strings.
  [Pascal Chiozzi]

20.04.2000 V1.1 PreRelease 6
============================
- The searchstring in ADT-search mode was not ghosted if the server was
  disconnected while receiving search results.

- If "Suppress ADT login messages" was switched on, no server messages were
  shown anymore in ADT mode.
  [Ingo Musquinier]

- The ServerManager now is no longer iconified if the "auto close" switch
  is enabled and a trader tries to reconnect/redial a server.
  [Ingo Musquinier]

- After copying a server the "bytes received" and "bytes sent" statistics of
  the original were set to zero but not of the copy.

- Logins weren't set to zero after copying a server.

- Connecting a server, making a copy of it and then quitting the connected
  server caused enforcerhits and a forever waiting trader-task. Fixed.

09.04.2000 V1.1 PreRelease 5
============================
- If autosave was set to off, the according internal timer was set to 0
  seconds and 0 micros.  This caused the timer to immediately send a signal
  to the program, everytime the timer was started again and the program
  consumed nearly all CPU time.
  [Thomas Heinrich/Oliver Förster and numerous others]

- Changed the way remote files are deleted.  Now the Trader waits until it
  gets a response from the server before it sends the next delete command.

- Removed a testfunction from the "Parse URL"-button (ATC was iconified
  after pressing the button).
  [Torsten "ToDi" Ketelsen]

03.04.2000 V1.1 PreRelease 4 bugfix
===================================
- The ServerManager was not closed immediately after quitting the
  application (could take several seconds).

- Fixed a bug in the catalogs.  Some texts were shown in english in the
  german locale.
  [Roland "Ronni" Hopfer]

02.04.2000 V1.1 PreRelease 4
============================
- If you're using the standard string class provided by MUI, the password
  for a server was not displayed hidden in l/p mode.
  [Erik Inge Bolsø]

- Pressing the ADT search abort-button while seemingly no data is
  transfered aborts the search immediately and not only if new data
  arrives.

- Optimized the Trader code a bit. Should also have a slightly smaller
  memory footprint now.

- Trader:  Removed an enforcer hit when saving/using the prefs from the
  settings-window. (changes re 23.03.2000 buffersize)

- AmFTP2ATC.rexx profiles converter now works correctly.
  [No Frills <no_frills@x-stream.co.uk>]

- Queue gauge wasn't shown if "edit queue before transfer" was activated.
  It was only displayed after you hit the "start download" button.

- Renumbering of the copy function only worked if an already copied entry
  was copied again.  E.g.  copying Co1_Bla worked and resulted in Co2_Bla
  but copying Bla always resulted in Co1_Bla.
  [Marcin Juszkiewicz]

- Added a set of New Icons and an extended installer-script to support New
  Icons and catalogs selection.
  [Marcin Juszkiewicz/Ingo Musquinier]

- Increased max. searchresults for ADT search to 5000.
  [Ingo Musquinier]

- Added autosave for profiles.
  (-> Menu/Profiles/Autosave, Menu/Profiles/Autosave time)
  [Marcin Juszkiewicz]

- Batchlist in ADT mode wasn't opened if it contained some files after
  login and the appropriate switch was enabled in the settings (in fact it
  was opened, but at a time where the group where the popup belongs to was
  not visible)
  [Ingo Musquinier]

- Copies that were created by pressing the connect button of an already
  connected server are now removed after you disconnect the server. These
  profiles also won't be saved.

- Wrote an replacement e-class for the afc ciatimer e-class since it
  doesn't seem to free all resources (I suppose no AbortIO()/WaitIO(),
  because there were still messages waiting after the class internal
  DeletePort() as per PatchWork)

- "edit queue before transfer" had no effect after disconnecting a server
  where a batch-download was running and reconnecting to the server and
  starting another batch-download.

- Fixed a longstanding bug that occured if you switched off PASV for a
  server while you were still online (PORT command always failed).
  [Michaela Prüß]

23.03.2000 V1.1 PreRelease3
===========================
- It's now possible to change the size of the diskbuffer for downloads.
  (-> Settings/Transfer/Download & Batch)
  [Luca "Hexaae" Longone]

- PageGroup containing free diskspace and low cps warning (trader download
  page) was not set back after a low cps warning.

- Fixed a spelling error in "trasfer" ;) window.
  [David Erman]

- Some ADT specific settings (keep dirtree, get readmes etc.) can now be set
  for every server-entry.  These settings can be reached by pressing the
  "more"-button if a server is set to ADT mode.
  [Marcin Juszkiewicz]

- Uploads are now also shown in the current transfer list (ServerManager).
  [David Erman]

- Send-button now gets disabled while the remote directory is being read in.

- Fixed another spelling error in english catalogs.
  [Marcin Juszkiewicz]

- Trader window won't be activated any longer if an error like "could not
  connect" occured.
  [Marcin Juszkiewicz]

- Added a new option to "show FTP-Log".  It's now possible to select
  whether the log should be shown never, always or only switched off during
  batch-transfers.  (-> Settings/Switches/Show FTP-Log)
  [Marcin Juszkiewicz]

- Expected End, Start Time, Current Time and Expected End (queue) in the
  transfer window also shows the day and the month additionally to the
  time now.

- If a download took longer than 24 hours, the time was not correctly
  calculated (i.e 25 hours 14 mins was shown as 01:14). Fixed.
  [Timm Rutland]

- Aminet MOTD now will be only shown after login if the date of the file is
  newer as the last viewed.  Showing the MOTD can take a little longer than
  before, because ATC has to list the remote directory to get the filedate
  of the MOTD.
  [Marcin Juszkiewicz]

- Downloads are now opened in shared mode, means you can view the contents
  of the files while being downloaded.
  [BKJ <Vulture@freemail.gr>]

- Added shortcuts to MUI_RequestA()-requesters.
  [Marcin Juszkiewicz]

- If you pressed the reload- or parent-button repeatedly (before it got
  ghosted) the directory contents were shown multiple times. Fixed.
  [Luca "Hexaae" Longone]

- Added abort-button to ADT-Search.
  [Marcin Juszkiewicz]

18.03.2000 V1.1 PreRelease2
===========================
- Removed a really bad memory leak in ftp.eclass.  The END methods of the
  internal adt, ftp and smtp e-classes were not called due to a missing PTR
  TO object in the wrapped end() func for these classes in the library.
  [Armin Hübner/Jeff German]

- The right-to-left scrolltext in the about window now stops, if the window
  gets deactivated.
  [Ingo Musquinier]

- If the ADT list has been sorted by directory, it was not properly sorted
  in rare situations. Fixed.
  [Ingo Musquinier]

- Have localized a german text in the trader, which crept in there somehow.
  [Marcin Juszkiewicz]

- CPS-Limit and Drop-CPS can now be set to 500.000 max.  First 20k in steps
  of 100, from 20k to 500k in steps of 2500.
  [Marcin Juszkiewicz]

- Changed again some shortcuts in the ServerManager and the Trader.
  [Marcin Juszkiewicz]

- Added option to show drawers always first when sorting directory lists.
  (-> Settings/Misc/Switches/)
  [Marcin Juszkiewicz]

- Column bars now can be switched on/off for directory lists.
  (-> Settings/Colors/Dirlist-Colors/)
  [Marcin Juszkiewicz]

- Removed a problem with socketbase after closing bsdsocket.library which
  caused enforcer hits/software failures in some situations (changes re
  27.02.2000)

16.03.2000 V1.1 PreRelease1
===========================

14.03.2000 internal
===================
- When adding a new server, the ADT-Date is now set to the current date
  instead of 0 which means 1.1.1978, so it's possible to change the date.
  [Luca "Hexaae" Longone]

13.03.2000 internal
===================
- After endless and disturbing discussions, I decided to change queue.pmcc
  to keep the gauge of the transfer queue visible, even if the last file is
  being transfered and the pagegroup switches to "Queue is empty".
  [Roland "Perfektionist" Hopfer]

08.03.2000 internal
===================
- MUIM_Draw method of cps.pmcc now only draws if MADF_DRAWOBJECT AND
  MADF_DRAWUPDATE are set instead of every time the draw method was called.

- It's now possible to change the format of the filecomments for
  adt-downloads.
  [Armin Hübner]

- Changed "days" to "weeks" in Aminet-Charts' "Age" column.

05.03.2000 public beta
======================
- Rename window always opened if you downloaded from the additional
  filelister, because the filename was not correctly taken over from the
  filelist. Fixed.

- After renaming files that couldn't be opened (see above), the trader
  window wasn't "de-sleeped" again. Fixed.

- Added titleclick functionality to the downloadqueue list, so it's now
  possible to sort the queue by simply clicking on the column-title.

04.03.2000 internal
===================
- I have finally checked tetris.pmmc again and found out that it draws
  outside of MUIM_Draw, which is not allowed.  Changed all draws outside of
  MUIM_Draw to a Mui_Redraw().  Problem was, that I couldn't reproduce any
  enforcer hits the class seems to have indirectly caused (input.device/
  intuition made trouble).
  [Luca "Hexaae" Longone after bugging me with yet another enforcer hit log ;)]

- The status texts regarding sending the rate mail won't be shown any
  longer if there are no files selected for rating.  (changes re 03.03.2000)
  [Ingo Musquinier]

- I've taken the SMTP mail sending stuff into ftp.eclass, to save some memory.

- Added Dis/Re-Connect at low speed.  This means you can set a min. cps
  for downloads and if the average cps drops below this cps, the trader will
  disconnect and reconnect to the server to get a better connection.  Have a
  look at the new register "Transfer" in the ServerManger.  CPS-Limit slider
  also resides in this register from now on.
  [Michaela Prüß]

03.03.2000 internal
===================
- The trader now renames files automatically that are added to the
  downloadqueue and only differ in their case.  So, if you want to download
  '/pub/misc/readme', '/pub/misc/ReadMe' and '/pub/misc/README', the second
  filename will become 'ReadMe.1' and the third will be renamed to 'README.2'
  [Michaela Prüß]

- It's now possible to execute/start a Shell-Command/Arexx-Script for every
  event.  It's very easy now to let e.g. a VirusChecker check all downloaded
  files/archives directly after downloading. (-> Settings/Events/)
  [Michaela Prüß]

- Sorting of the serverlist did not work as it was supposed to, because I
  did assume the sorthook gets 2 pointers to 2 serverentries but in fact it
  got 2 pointers to a muis_Listtree_TreeNode struct.
  [Ingo Musquinier]

- As in nearly every release I've also updated the catalogs (never
  mentioned before I think :)).

- Big thanks to Ingo Musquinier.  Ingo contributed some code to send mails
  directly via SMTP, so there's no need for the Arexx script any longer.
  [Ingo Musquinier]

- Changed some colliding (doubly assigned) menu shortcuts in the
  ServerManager (english catalogs only).
  [Torsten "ToDi" Ketelsen]

- If you were in ADT-Search, opened the settings and clicked use or save,
  the ADT lister was cleared (because of a settings-changed message) and
  became ghosted and you had to search again.  Fixed.
  [Ingo Musquinier]

02.03.2000 internal
===================
- Added another scrolltext to the about window.  BTW, you can stop the
  fire-effect (to make the scroller a bit faster) by simply clicking on it.
  This is no new feature but it's not too obvious at first.

01.03.2000 internal
===================
- Fixed a bug that made the trader always stop at tries-1 by trying to
  connect to a server.
  [Detlef Wojtaszkiewicz]

29.02.2000 public beta
======================
- Changed the changes.  Added all the people that were responsible or
  involved in some changes/bugfixes (Hope I haven't forgotten anyone)

- Updated the german documentation.  Will be included in the next full
  release (to be released sometime during march I think)

- Added "download directly by filename" to the Trader.
  (-> Menu/Action/Download directly by filename)
  [Ingo Musquinier]

- The local directory is read in again after renaming files.
  [Ingo Musquinier]

28.02.2000 internal
===================
- The ServerManager now only gets iconified (if the appropriate option is
  enabled of course), if no error occured during the trader startup.
  [Michaela Prüß]

27.02.2000 internal
===================
- The trader window only gets opened if no error occured during startup
  (couldn't open bsdsocket.library etc.), in order to strain the nerves of
  aga-users not unnecessarily (english, wassat? ;))
  [Michaela Prüß]

- Added ADT-Rate.  It's now possible to rate Aminet files.  ATC uses a
  rexx-script (ATC/Rexx/SendADTRateMail.rexx) which is used to send mails
  with your favorite mailer.  Currently there's only a script for YAM
  included, because that's the mailer of my choice.
  [Torsten "ToDi" Ketelsen]

- Added new string gadget to the settings to change the ADT-Rate email
  address. (-> Settings/ADT/ADT Rate Email Address)

27.02.2000 public beta
======================
- It's now possible to let ATC create a backup of the .profiles file at
  exit. (-> Settings/Misc/Switches)
  [Michaela Prüß]

- Added simple sorting of the serverlist via Conext-Menu (Click right
  mousebutton over the serverlist)
  [Michaela Prüß]

26.02.2000 internal
===================
- Diskspace-Warn-Requester showed negative and incorrect values if the size
  was larger than 32bit.  Fixed.
  [Thomas Heinrich]

- Required diskspace was not calculated and thus the requester was not
  opened if the batchlist contained only one entry.

- A requester now pops up if you have installed the new NListtree.mcc V18,
  asking to install a compatible class.
  [Michaela Prüß]

- If the batchlist is empty after a download, it will be closed automatically.
  [Detlef Wojtaszkiewicz]

- Added another switch to the settings to disable freediskspace
  calculation. (-> Settings/Transfer/Download & Batch)
  [Thomas Heinrich]

25.02.2000 internal
===================
- Added support for NListtree.mcc V18 but had to deactivate it again,
  because of some bugs in NListtree.mcc i've encountered (have informed the
  author).
  [Michaela Prüß]

- Tetris.pmcc now only allocates a bitmap for a temorary rastport, if the
  OS version is <=39.
  [Luca "Hexaae" Longone]

24.02.2000 internal
===================
- Changed some string funcs back to the old ones, because of unsupported
  format commands.

23.02.2000 internal
===================
- After a download the local directory will be read in again.
  [Roland "Ronni" Hopfer]

- Status display of local directory wasn't refreshed after reading a
  directory (number of files/dirs etc).  Fixed.

- Another small speed up while reading the local directory (replaced string
  funcs with faster ones).

- Also new string funcs in adt.pmcc and dirlist.pmcc.  Please report any
  problems that might be the result of the new string funcs (distorted/random
  contents in string gadgets).

- Added updated installerscript (by Ingo Musquinier).  This script now
  handles beta releases as well as normal distribution releases, so there's
  no need for two separate scripts anymore.  Furthermore the script also
  checks for the .adtfilter config and does not overwrite an already present
  adtfilter.
  [Ingo Musquinier]

- Local dirlist still showed entries more than once (I assume
  MUIM_Application_PushMethod doesn't work correctly).  Added a workaround
  for MUIM_Application_PushMethod (simulated pushmethod via messages).
  [Torsten "ToDi" Ketelsen]

- Switched asynchronous to synchronous message passing (readdirtask->trader),
  to have less fragmentation (no need to allocate/free memory for every
  message sent) and less copying of dirlist data.

22.02.2000 public beta 2
========================
- ADT:  Downloading and viewing of .readme's and the Aminet MOTD was broken
  in the first beta.  Fixed.
  [Torsten "ToDi" Ketelsen]

- The protection bits are now also shown in the color of the whole entry.

- Sometimes entries were shown more than once in the local dirlist. Fixed.
  [Torsten "ToDi" Ketelsen]

22.02.2000 public beta
======================
- The trader now starts an additional task for asynchronous reading of the
  local directory. (Speedup, nonblocking GUI while reading large dirs)
  [Jeff Klein gave the final push to implement it]

21.02.2000 internal
===================
- Wrapped poslist (remembering of selected entries) stuff into an eclass.

- At least set a stack for tetris.pmcc (how could i have forgotten?)

- Increased stacksize for AmiTradeCenter (exe), because of problems when
  opening the MUI Prefs.

20.02.2000 public beta
======================
- From now on, it is impossible to upload when in ADT mode.

- Changed ADT Filter and ADT Highlight to also use memorypools.

- Exchanged "Select" and "Download" button in ADT mode to make the GUI more
  logical (compared to FTP mode) when in dual lister mode.

- Changed the way tetris.pmcc checks for graphics.library version (to
  decide whether to use WCP() (OS3.1) or WPL8() (OS3.0))
  [Luca "Hexaae" Longone]

19.02.2000 internal
===================
- The bars in the ADT-lister (sort by date, Charts) are no longer
  considered for calculating the lister information.  A false status was
  displayed before.

- ADT-lister information now shows how many files have been hidden because
  of ADT-Filter.

- Changed some internals regarding drag'n'drop in dirlist.pmcc and adt.pmcc.

- Had to change the .profiles file format because of problems caused by
  fields (password, dirnames, etc) that could contain commas.  The .profiles
  file will be converted as soon as you save the profiles the first time with
  this version.
  [David Erman]

18.02.2000 public beta
======================
- I've finally killed some very nasty bugs in private mcc's (dirlist.pmcc,
  adt.pmcc and xfer.pmcc).  These classes removed additional classes (created
  by these classes) during OM_DISPOSE.
  [Sascha Glade pointed in the right direction, Jeff German made me to take
  a closer look finally]

- ADT:  ADT-Filter added.  You are now able to choose which directories
  will be shown and which will be hidden. (Settings/ADT/ADT Filter)

17.02.2000 internal
===================
- Recursive downloading was not possible anymore due to a messed up
  internal struct (changes re 12.02.2000).  Fixed.

- Added "Skip All" button to the download rename window.

16.02.2000 public beta
======================
- Should also run on OS3.0 now.

15.02.2000 internal
===================
- Added a link button to the about window.  Clicking this button will get
  you to the ATC homepage (using openurl.library)
  [Torsten "ToDi" Ketelsen]

14.02.2000 internal
===================
- Added an option to switch single lister mode on/off for each serverentry
  from the ServerManager (Advanced Settings).

- Removed a check for ProFTP in ftp.eclass (switched PASV off for this
  server automatically).  Now works with ProFTP and firewalls.
  [David Scheibler]

- Tetris now auto-pauses (when a game is running) if you click outside its
  window.
  [Luca "Hexaae" Longone]

- Now shows the protection bits of each entry in the remote lister.
  [David Scheibler]

- Added support for CHMOD (if you don't know what its good for, leave your
  hands off it)
  [David Scheibler]

13.02.2000 public beta
======================
- Fixed a bug in adt.pmcc that could have caused software failures in some
  rare situations.

12.02.2000 internal
===================
- ADT-Mode now uses the same lister for the local directory as in FTP-Mode,
  so you're able to switch between single lister and dual lister mode in
  ADT-Mode, too.

- Added "Abort" and "Skip" buttons to the download rename window.

- You can now select a new downloadpath in the download rename window.
  [Erdey <Erdey@gmx.net>]

- The remote directory is no longer read in twice after an upload.
  [Roland "Ronni" Hopfer]

11.02.2000 internal
===================
- Help bubbles of the settings window displayed garbage after the window
  was closed and opened again. Fixed.
  [Luca "Hexaae" Longone]

10.02.2000 public beta
======================
- Fixed a memory bug in internal listhandling.

09.02.2000 internal
===================
- It was possible to start several tradertasks for one and the same server
  entry by repeatedly hitting the connect button before it got finally
  ghosted.  This caused multiple tradertasks for the selected server entry,
  which, in particular, had done no good...

- download queue: removed the vertical titlebar between date and time

- Set default patternmatching columns for ADT (not highlighting) to
  Filename and Shortcomment instead of Date.

08.02.2000 public beta
======================
- Removed the testfunction from "Add Group" button (cleared the serverlist),
  sorry for this (was introduced in 07.02.2000 public beta).
  [Detlef Wojtaszkiewicz]

- Added new menuitem "MUI..." to the settings-menu of the trader.
  [RUiNa <ruin@frontiernet.net>]

- You have to set the balance-gadgets (Trader) again (only when using
  betterbalance.mcc), because i had to change the MUI_Object_ID's of both
  balance-gadgets.

- Added patternmatching by column.  This enables you to specifically search
  for patterns in any column of the listview.  See "select" button.
  [BKJ <Vulture@freemail.gr>]

07.02.2000 public beta
======================
- Iconification/Deiconification of all traders from the ATC mainmenu did
  not work.  Fixed.

- Removed a bug that caused name collisions of the tasknames if several
  Tradertasks have been started fast consecutively.

- Reworked single lister mode. Single lister mode now shows the complete
  local listview and buttons if you click on the popup button.

- Fixed some bugs in the internal serverlistclass. Setup/Cleanup/Penallocation
  Methods were doing strange things.

===================

  Trader->Menu/Settings/Listermode

- Added a new event:  File already exists.  This event will be invoked if a
  file is already on the local harddrive and the requester opens.

- Added another memorypool for internal data such as pathlists and
  batchlists that each server entry contains.

- The Trader now sends the termination-msg to the ServerManager at a later
  time. Could have caused lockups before if it was timed correctly.

- Catalog/Doc updated

06.02.2000 public beta
======================
- The reconnect-delay value of an running server entry was not taken over
  if changed.  This has been fixed.

- Deiconification (events) worked only, if the checkbox for the signal had
  also been set.

- Download-Ready event won't be played any longer at the end of an
  batchdownload if the Batchdownload-Ready event is also set for playing.
  (same for Upload-Ready and Batchupload-Ready)

- Removed a bug at the title-strings for events in the prefs (deiconify and
  signal where exchanged).

- Size/Position of the additional filelist window in adt-mode can now be
  fixed. (worked already in ftp-mode)
  [Detlef Wojtaszkiewicz]

- Now uses MUIV_NList_Font_Little for the ftp-log list.

05.02.2000 public beta
======================
- Removed a bug in listhandling of the server-manager which caused ATC to
  crash heavily.  Crash occured while removing groups which still contained
  connected servers.
