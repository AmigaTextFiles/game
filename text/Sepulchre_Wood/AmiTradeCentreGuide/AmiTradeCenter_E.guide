@{B}@{FG Highlight}¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯@{UB}@{FG Text}

One day, it was spring 1998, some people told me to write a really new,
comfortable, small, very useful FTP-Client.  The reason for this was the
unflexible dirlistparser of AmFTP which seems to drive all of the
ProClam-chat-demigod-candidates more or less crazy (that doesn't mean that
development of ATC was nice for those candidates.  Not to mention long-term
effects which possibly occur or even thinking about it).

So I took the very unpleasant challenge to write a really new, comfortable,
small, very useful program.

As I have had no idea of TCP/IP programing (don't have and never will
have), development stand still (for the moment) with a dirlistparser which
was really, honestly, at a rough guess, 10 times better than that in this
other program.  Some of my ProClam-chat-demigod-candidates mates went out
to say that this enormous improvement could not be expressed with the
natural range of digits as we know them from school and they have had think
up new digits that would made every highlevel professor of math to enter
new worlds.

Then i, due to my incompetence, made development incredible slow (so no one
would ever notice) to focus on really important things, as we all know how
much one has to care nowadays to avoid things like cutting grass, cleaning
shoes, tidy up your cellar, visit the barbershop, going to a yodel course
and so on.

An incredible amount of time went by and I felt very safe as well as in a
patronizing mood (due to renovation of our local bubble gum machine) so it
seems impossible to avoid unimportant things like mentioned above at this
point.

One day, as I was on the way to cut the grass, while yodelling a bit, i
noticed like thunderstruck how unimportant it was to cut the grass while
yodelling a bit or to do a concentration dance in reversed order and how
important it was to put my
roughly-guessed-10-time-better-dirlistparser-as-it-was-in-AmFTP in a (a)
very expensive MUI-GUI and (b) an already covered in (c) entirety which
would be no challenge for a highlevel professor of math to come up with, to
interpret slowmotion close-ups from a reporter sitting at the beach with
plastic bags around his shoes.

Meanwhile, it was summer 1999 and the program which was named MyFTP at this
point, made very good progress.  I was told to change things here and there
and to add this and that, to quickformat my drives and to add some buttons
and finally, to get ready with the program.

Then, in late summer, I have had hollidays (what luckily gives me some
distance from all unimportant things) as the big question how to name the
program, which was meanwhile named from MyFTP to Hannover, comes to my
mind.

About days and weeks there was only one topic in the ProClam-chat which
was, by the time visited somewhat unregular but consistent by the
ProClam-chat-demigod-candidates, how to name the program finally.

Here is a list of names that were suggested by the
ProClam-chat-demigod-candidates and myself:  GelbFTP, GetOver, GetOverIt,
GetItOver, LetItBe, OverUndAus, Roger, HangOver, L-Over, powerfulFTP,
OverFTP, futschikato, NetOver, OverNet, BetterFTP, ÜberFTP, SpeedFTP,
BlackFTP, DarkFTP, eclipseFTP, BuckelFTP, GamsFTP, ExtraFTP, SuperFTP,
PrimaFTP, UltraFTP, TransferOMat, SpeedOMat, IngOMat, TPFKAH, The Program
Formerly Known As Hannover, Feines Transfer Programm, Heftiges Transfer
programm, warpFTP, FTPBlaster, ZickZack, haFTProbe, GetOMat, XferMe, WAW =
Watch And Wonder, BeatIt!, Vaporizer, Pulverisierer, Fast Totale
Pulverisierung, FireFTP, hotFTP, crimsonFTP, fastFTP, siliconFTP, GummFTP,
FTPExtravaganza, stunningFTP, thrillingFTP, breathtakingFTP, trickyFTP,
amazingFTP, FTPRaider, HolyFTP, FTPUndDerGanzeRest, Turbopump, PumpItUp,
PumpOMat, PumpITOver, FTPumper, iFTP, FTPNG, bulkyFTP, NiceFTP, MuiFTP,
AmiCuteFTP, BoingFTP, BavarianFTP, Interceptor, whodunnitFTP, SmurfFTP,
SmartFTP, TiltFTP, FTP:  Episode I, smarty, mcfly, Hannover, King^Kassel,
BremerStadtMusikanten, CleverFTP, SmoothFTP, SlickFTP, SilkyFTP,
astonishingServerManager, crazyClient, HappyFTP, CrazyFTP, IncredibleFTP,
PricelessFTP, AstonishingFTP, SchlauFTP, whatsoeverFTP, nonameftp,
TrulyFTP, TurboPump, JumboSauger, WorldTradeCenter.

The last one of all names that was elected as the name by a
jury of 2-3 people, was not accepted.  In the mind of the
ProClam-chat-demigod-candidates (actually only one of them)
WorldTradeCenter would be a brilliant and original name that was flawless
and free of spots, which emerge if you drag something very slowly through
cocoa or similar brown material (which could also be syrupy).

It was decided that WorldTradeCenter would not match exactly and that such
a big name would be no name for a program with very simple history and the
term "world" was replaced with "Ami" which made the name a little bit (but
not really that much) more accurate.

After the process to find the right name it was time for me to focus on
the entirety of procedures of hygenic treatment of the face, the hair and
the skin which left me dashed to the ground (but was not really disgusting)
and besides the development of the really new, comfortable, small and very
useful program.

Doubleclick the install-icon and follow the instructions or, if you don't
like that, copy all files to a directory of your choice.  In this case you
must copy all files to the new directory, no file has to be copied to any
other directory because this could bring you into a lot of trouble.  ATC
may behave not the way it should do, you have been warned!

The userinterface was planed to be simple and efficient in usage but with
all the options and features of ATC if was difficult to achieve that.

The design and layout has changed several times during development, the
result is how ATC looks and feels today.  Hope you like it.

This chapter handles all settings that are necessary for a FTP-Site.

· @{B}Comment@{UB} - You can place a comment for a server here.  This could be any
  name that tells you something about the server.

· @{B}Address@{UB} - The domain or IP where the server lives on.
  Must not start with ftp:// as ATC will connect you to a FTP-server
  anyway.

· @{B}Port@{UB} - A portnumber on which ATC should connect the remote server
  If you leave this gadget empty, ATC will use port 21 (hopefully).

· @{B}Mode@{UB} - You can select one of 3 modes here.

  @{B}ADT@{UB} - This is the Aminet-Download-Tool mode. If you connect
  to aminet you want to use this.

  @{B}Login/PW@{UB} - In this mode you give a loginname and a password

  @{B}Anonymous@{UB} - This mode is for anonymous logins like @ftp.vapor.com

· @{B}Remote directory@{UB} - You can put a directory name here, which will be
  visited immediately after a successful login.

· @{B}Checkmark right to "Remote dir."@{UB} - If you check this checkmark, ATC
  will save the name of the last visited directory for this site.

· @{B}PopUp right to "Remote dir."@{UB} - This list contains the last 20 visited
  directories of the remote site.  Doubleclicking an entry will set the
  clicked directory as the remote directory.

· @{B}Local directory@{UB} - Same as remote directory but for local paths.

· @{B}Checkmark right to "local dir."@{UB} - Same as for remote directory (see above)

· @{B}parse URL@{UB} - If you define a new server and write an URL like
  ftp://[username:passwort]@servername[:port]/path into the comment-gadget you
  can use this button to automatically set all fields for the server.

Advanced options are not vital for a successful login to a remote server.
However, you would probably want to set some of these options to your needs.

· @{B}Tries@{UB} - If a login was not successful (too many users, server not
  reachable or whatever reason) ATC will reconnect as often as you define
  here.

· @{B}Delay@{UB} - Time to wait between every try.

· @{B}Keep Alive@{UB} - ATC send a NOOP-command every 30 seconds.  This will prevent
  you from being disconnected from a remote server because of inactivity.
  Note that this does not work on all servers, i.e.  depends on the remote
  server configuration.

· @{B}Cache@{UB} - If you check this checkmark, ATC will use a cachesystem for this
  server.

· @{B}PASV@{UB} - If you check this checkmark, ATC uses the command PASV instead of
  PORT.  You should use PASV if you are behind a firewall.

· @{B}Single Lister Mode@{UB} - Shows the remote directory only

· @{B}CPS-Limit@{UB} - This slider limits the CPS.  You can use it if you connect to
  a friend and don't want to use all his bandwidth.  You could also lower the
  CPS to control your own bandwidth.

· @{B}Disconnect if cps drops below@{UB} - If the CPS drops under this limit, ATC
  reconnects you to this server and resume the download.  The aim is to have
  a better CPS after reconnect.

· @{B}for the last (x seconds)@{UB} - Reconnection takes effect if the CPS is
  below the limit for longer then this value, only.

· @{B}Ignore first seconds@{UB} - You can set how many seconds should be ignored for
  the reconnect feature after a new download.  Especially useful if you start
  a download and the CPS is not immediately up to full CPS.  It takes some
  seconds to reach the full CPS with the server.

· @{B}Tries@{UB} - How many times ATC should try to reconnect to achieve a better
  cps.

This register shows some statistics for the server, such as:

Time and date of your first and last login, the number of connections,
the number of successful logins, the number of files down/uploaded,
the number of bytes sent/received, the maximum and average CPS and
the amount of time you spent on this server.

There's also a button "Clear Statistic" which, of course, set all
statistics to 0 (zero).  This button is only usable if you are not
connected to the server in question.

The NList-listview shows all servers that were currently loaded.  You can
read here the comment, the address, the port and the mode of each server.

With a doubleclick of an entry ATC tries to connect to this server.  If you
are already connected to this server, the window jumps to the front or, if
it's iconified it's deiconified.

If you have installed the MUI-Class "NListtree.mcc" you can see the state of
a server from its color.  NListtree.mcc is part of the release-version of
ATC and can be installed during ATC installation quite easily.

Note:  There is also a "real" NListtree.mcc available since a few month.
Please do not install this one because there are too many bugs atm.

Below the server list, there are funny buttons that you can use to
play funny games with each entry.

· @{B}Add Server@{UB} - Adds a server to the end of the list, default settings will
  take effect as configured in settings/server.

· @{B}Copy server@{UB} - ATC adds a copy of the active server to the list.  ATC
  detects automatically how many copies already exist.  E.g.  a server
  called "Aminet USA" would be "C1_Aminet USA" if you hit this button.

· @{B}Remove server@{UB} - Removes a server from the list.

· @{B}Add goup@{UB} - Adds a new group to the end of the list.

· @{B}Connect@{UB} - Tries to connect you to the server (wow).

The FTP-Mode allows to handle files the way (famous) filemanager does.
You can copy, delete, rename or view a file, you can also create new
directories.

There are 2 listview available for this matter which show your local
directory (left) and the remote directory (right).

Doubleclick an entry either shows the file with the viewer you choose
in ATC-settings or, if the entry is a diretory, change the directory.

On top of every listview you'll find the title of the listview (local or
remote).

· @{B}Strindgadget Path@{UB} - Shows the path that is currently shown in the
  listview.  It is possible to write down a new path here and if it's
  available, ATC changes the directory immediately.

· @{B}PopUp (local)@{UB} - Shows a list with all drives and assigns in your system.
  With a doubleclick you select the drive/assign.

· @{B}PopUp (remote)@{UB} - Shows the last 20 entries of the history from the server.
  With a doubleclick on an entry ATC changes to this old directory.

· @{B}Parent@{UB} - With this button you climb up the tree to the parent directory.

· @{B}Reload@{UB} - If you find out, let me know :-)

@{B}@{U} The Buttons @{UU}@{UB}
· @{B}Send@{UB} (on the left side only) - Uploads all selected entries to the
  selected remote directory.  It is possible to upload a whole directory,
  with its subdirectories as well, to the remote server.  If you indeed have
  selected a directory a requester pops up to ask what you want to do
  exactly.

  @{B}Upload@{UB} - Creates the directory and uploads all files into this new
  (remote) directory.

  @{B}recursive@{UB} - create directory with all its subdirectories on the remote
  server and upload all files.

  @{B}skip@{UB} - Skip this diretory and go to the next entry.

· @{B}Receive@{UB} (remote only) - All seleced files are transferred to the local
  directory.

· @{B}Select@{UB} - With this function you can select files/directories via
  a DOS-pattern (like #?, [1-9] and so on). The window which opens up
  should be pretty self-describing.

· @{B}Makedir@{UB} - Of course, you can create a new directory with this button
  (hey, what did you expect?)

· @{B}Show@{UB} - This starts the viewer you have choosen in ATC-settings for all
  selected entries.

· @{B}Rename@{UB} - If clicked, a requester pops up, where you can enter a new
  name for the active file/directory.

· @{B}Delete@{UB} - Deletes all selected entries.

· @{B}CHMOD@{UB} - CHMOD a remote file. If you don't know what it's good for, just
  don't use it!

@{B}@{U} Statusdisplay @{UU}@{UB}
Below each listview is a textfield where you can see some informations for
the current directory.

This line may look like this:

- @{B}59 Files [2], 16 Dirs [3], 14.505K [4.882K]@{UB} -

That means, there are 59 files with 14.505 kB and 16 directories within the
current directory.  From these entries, 2 files and 3 directories are
selected.  The two files are together 4.882 kB in size.

For the remote listview the statusdisplay also shows CPS and bytes while
reading a remote directory.  You can stop reading directories with the
(wohooo) stopbutton on the right, you will know it's the stopbutton once
you see it.

ADT is a shortcut for Aminet-Download-Tool and is a special mode which
allows to browse a list of recently uploaded files.  Normally this would be
an Aminet-Server.  ATC offers different options in ADT-Mode.

· @{B}Rate Files@{UB} - With this function you can rate a file on Aminet.  The
  charts are maintained on a weekly basis, so don't expect your rating takes
  immediate effect on the charts.  As an Amiga user you should have learned to
  wait, though ;)

· @{B}Show readme@{UB} - If you select a file and hit this button ATC downloads
  and shows the .readme file of the entry.  A doubleclick on an entry has the
  same effect.

· @{B}Select@{UB} - with this function you can select files via a DOS-pattern (like
  #?, [1-9] and so on).  The window which opens should be pretty
  self-describing.

· @{B}Mode@{UB} - There are 6 different modes available.

  · @{B}New@{UB} - This is what you normally want.  It shows all new entries since
    your last login.

  · @{B}Recent 7@{UB}  - Shows all uploads within the last week.

  · @{B}Recent 14@{UB} - Shows all uploads within the last forthnight (2 weeks)

  · @{B}Local@{UB} - Shows all files that are stored on the ADT-Server.  Download
    this list can take some time, be prepared to play tetris or something...
    :)

  @{B}Search@{UB} - You can search through aminet with this function.  Just type
  one or more words into the stringgadget.

  @{B}Charts@{UB} - This mode is not really a standard on ADT-Servers.  There is
  no guarantee that it works on every ADT-Server, at least Wuarchive and
  Paderborn are proofed to work properly.  If you find an ADT-server which
  doesn't work in chart-mode, please report to the ATC-Development-Council(tm).
  However, the charts show 2 lists, one with the most downloaded files and
  one with the highest rated files (ATC tops this list ATM (25.04.2000).

· @{B}Receive@{UB} - Transfer all selected files to your local harddisk.

@{B}@{U} The List @{UU}@{UB}
· @{B}sort@{UB} - To sort the list, just click on one of the titlebars on top
  of the list.

  Of course, in mode "charts" you can't sort the list in any way.

There are two buttons right under the remote listview.  These two buttons
together builds a powerful feature.  Remembering of files.

· @{B}Add@{UB} - All selected files are gathered in a list if you press this
  button.  There is a mechanism to avoid dupes in the list.  Another
  possibility is to drag&drop the entries over the button or you can
  drag&drop directly into the list if the window is open.

· @{B}PopUp (usually a magnifying glass)@{UB} - With this button you open the
  batchlist which holds the files you have added to the list.

If the list is not empty when you disconnect from a server, ATC can do
different things depending on your settings (see @{"Settings" link Settings}).

A very nice feature of ATC is recursive download.  You can choose if you
want to overtake the directory structure from the remote server (you can
easily mirror a server this way).

If you have indeed selected a directory a new window pops up to ask what
to do.

You have the following choices:

· @{B}Download (flat)@{UB} - Just download all files within the remote directory
  to your download directory.

· @{B}Download (create dir)@{UB} - This method is like download with the difference
  that a new directory is created within your download path.
  All remote files are stored there.

· @{B}Recursive (flat)@{UB} - This method downloads all files, include files that are
  in subdiretories, to your download path.

· @{B}Recursive (keep dirtree)@{UB} - Here it is, the exact mirror function :-)
  The directory structure from the remote server is mirrored on your
  harddisk.

The transfer window is used for up and download.
You can see all necessary data for the up/download here.

The window is somewhat divided in two groups.  The first one shows all data
for the transfer.  The second one show the list of files queued for
transfer and some buttons (while downloading only) as well.

If you start a download ATC will first check if you have enough bytes left
on your harddisk for this particular download.  If this is not the case,
ATC bothers you with a requester to ask what to do.

@{B}@{U} Transfer Group @{UU}@{UB}
You can see vital data here, e.g.  local and remote filename, expected time
for the transfer, expected end of the transfer, elapsed time, cps,
sent/received bytes and some things more (have a look).

· @{B}CPS-Limit@{UB} - During transfer you can control the transfer speed with this
  slider if you e.g. don't want to use too much bandwidth from a friend
  or share your bandwidth with other tasks (like webbrowsers and such).

· @{B}CPS-History@{UB} - You can watch the cps of the last few seconds here.  With
  a doubleclick on the CPS-History you can reset the meter.

· @{B}Abort Transfer@{UB} - Abort the transfer of a file.

  If you have set ATC to ask before aborting a download, a requester pops
  up in the first place. You are asked if you want to go on with downloading,
  abort the download and delete the incomplete file (while downloading only)
  or want to add the file to the batchlist.

@{B}@{U} Batch Group @{UU}@{UB}
This group shows a list with all queued files (waiting for transfer).  On
the right of the list you can see some data about the transfer.

· @{B}Abort Queue@{UB} - Abort the transfer of the queue including the file which
  is in progress at the moment. Again a requester pops up, if your settings
  indicate to do so, asking you what to do.

This would be one of this:

· @{B}Remove Entries@{UB} - Kick selected entries out of the list (big fun indeed ;))

· @{B}Clear List@{UB} - Kick all entries out of the list (even more fun).

· @{B}Add To Batch@{UB} - All entries are added to the batch.

· @{B}Arrow up/down@{UB} - With this buttons you can shuffle the active entry
  up and down within the list.

Select TETRiS in the server manager to play some tetris while downloading.

With the "N" key you start a new game, with the "P" key you pause the game.
With cursor up you flip a tetris-stone about 90 degree to the right, cursor
down moves a stone somewhat faster to the bottomline.  The spacebar drops a
stone completely to the bottomline.

If you click outside the tetris window and thus it is no more the active
window, tetris automatically goes into pause-state.

Okay, you got me.  There is one problem I'm not very fond of.  If you are
using the patched Listtree.mcc (patched to use NList) on small screens
(640*480 and smaller) you can be assured that ATC will crash.  The solution
to this problem is, to somehow make the class (resides in mui:libs/mui)
undiscoverable for ATC.  You can do this by either rename it, delete it or
move it to another directory. The name of the class is NListtree.mcc.

ATC doesn't like the OS-patch NitrOS (or maybe NitrOS doesn't like ATC).
If you want to use NitrOS in conjunction with ATC, be assured that this
won't be an easy task and will cause problems. [Thanks to BKJ]

@{B}@{U} Frequently Asked Questions @{UU}@{UB}
Q: The log is too big.  Could you please reduce the size to 60% of
   actually height. (or something like this)

A: There is a balance-object between the log and the upper GUI, so
   you can set the size of the log by yourself. I suggest you to download
   betterbalance.mcc from Aminet, which, in contrary to the original
   balance class remembers the balance settings of the GUI.

-------

Q: If I change the colors of the busy-bar, why won't they be taken over?

A: I assume you changed the colors from the ServerManager.
   If yes, you have to change the colors from the MUI-prefs of every trader.
   That's because ATC (ServerManager) and the Trader are two separate
   applications in terms of MUI and save their prefs to different files.

-------

Q: Everytime I change the font in the MUI-Prefs, ATC uses a different
   font.  Why doesn't ATC use the font I selected?

A: ATC has a BIG GUI so MUI cannot layout it with your selected font.
   Simply change the screen resolution to a bigger size and all should work
   okay.

· Patch Listtree.mcc to NListtree.mcc
  You must not really do this on your own because the installer should have
  copied the NListtree.mcc already, except you deny the question during
  installation (there's no good reason to do that).

  @{B}Background@{UB}:  ATC actually makes use of listtree.mcc in the
  servermanager.  This MUI-Class is unable to display single entries in free
  configurable colors.  At the beginning of development, as ATC managed the
  list via NList.mcc, the colorstuff was already implemented into the
  servermanager to show the state for every server, that was no problem with
  NList.mcc.

  Solution: To get back the nice colorstuff into the serverlist, you load
  the file Listtree.mcc into a texteditor. You then look for 'list.mui',
  remove the 0-byte after 'list.mui' and replace 'list.mui' with 'NList.mui'.
  Save the file as 'mui:libs/mui/NListtree.mcc and you're done.

· Convert AmFTP serverlist:  To use the serverlist you have used in AmFTP
  there is a short Arexx-script to do the job.

  @{B}Instructions@{UB}: You start AmFTP (for the last time in the next couple of decades)
  open a Shell and change the directory to the path where the script is
  stored, by default this is <your path:>AmiTradeCenter/Utilities.  How to
  change the current directory can not be explained any further because this
  a long planned skill-test for everyone ;) If you indeed managed to change
  the current directory (wooohooo, cool), write down in the shell 'rx
  AmFTP2ATC.rexx' and press return very heavy (in case it works a little bad
  these days).

  The script then gets all entries out of the AmFTP serverlist and saves them
  in a format that is acceptable for ATC as 'ram:ATC.Profiles'.  If you
  managed all these magic steps, you can close AmFTP and start ATC.

  You then select the menu 'server/profiles/Add Profiles. A requester pops
  up where you can, with an amazing ease, select the profiles file which is
  still stored in ram:ATC.profiles.

· @{B}ADT-Find@{UB}: If you're in charge for a special archive it is recommended
  to use more than one word to look for. E.g. you are looking for the MUI-Class
  Busy.mcc. You should use 'busy mui' as keywords for the search process.
  You'll see that very little archives will be found that way
  (that's what you want if you are looking for a special archive, isn't it ;)).

There are some people out there to which I want to say thank you because
without them ATC wouldn't exists.  Or at least it wouldn't exists in the
form it actually exists now and makes it cute and likeable.

Furthermore, I have made sorta inexact psychoanalysis for everyone who
deserves thanks.

@{B}@{U} Ingo "Nightrider" Musquinier @{UU}@{UB}
Here we have a guy who, as soon as he starts a program, is just blown by
bugs which no normal user would ever find or even notice.  Furthermore he
has the strange talent to stress me with strange featurerequests which no
one would usually really need but which would be missed in ATC (if you
knew of the feature, because otherwise you'd never could think of such a
feature).

He is responsible for things like edit downloadbatch before download,
surpress ADT-Loginmessage, the batchlist for remembering files, the new
transfer breakline switch in CPS-History, the Aminet-Charts support and
some other useless and at least some useful things, too.

For the icons, which were made from Todis wonderful logo, I put in even
more thanks.  He also made most of the Help-bubbles and the AmFTP2ATC.rexx
convert-script.  He also wrote the installscript from scratch, it was his
first ever installscript (he starts learning the whole stuff especially for
ATC) which was a pretty nice move.  Last but not least he is also
responsible for the demo-profiles and demo-settings and some tips in this
guide.

He also translated the german guide to english and contributed code for the
ADT-Rate-Mode so that ATC can handle SMTP on its own.


@{B}@{U} Roland "Ronni" Hopfer @{UU}@{UB}
Ronni is a pragmatist as written in books or at least how it should be
written in books.  What makes Ronni special and turns out to be no fun for
the developer (me) is his ability to find difficult to implement (but
useful) features as well as really nasty bugs.

Furthermore he can keep you close to a nervous breakdown but is kind enough
to let you not die immediately.  He is responsible for things like sort by
date with the second sort criteria path in ADT-Mode, saving the last active
entry in the servermanager so it is active at the next start of ATC and
also for the active entries in directories when you reenter them.
Furthermore he is responsible for recursive download, keep dirtree in
ADT-Mode and a minor set of suggestions.


@{B}@{U} Torsten "ToDi" Ketelsen @{UU}@{UB}
This outstanding great boy (in any case) deserves most likely the most
thanks because he made this wonderful ATC-Logo (while he was watched,
controlled, instructed, blamed and finally calmed down with nice comments
again, via Webcam).  He is the one who has created and maintains
http://amisource.de/ATC/.

Find out bugs and thinking of new features, I would give him a 2 this time,
but that wasn't a problem as there were two other guys who did that good
enough.

What was really nice, was his praise (without them I would have done it
anyway) in some situations.
