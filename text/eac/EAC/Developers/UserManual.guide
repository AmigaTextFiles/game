Introduction
@{UB}
Although EAC is not a proper programming language and can be used only 
to create text adventure games, I think due to its syntax and style of
variable handling, common in many languages, such as BASIC, COBOL & C,
I think it is fair to call it a `kind programming language'. EAC 
operates by reading scripts which are written using a text editor such 
as ED or Transwrite. These scripts are then loaded into the EAC program
its self.

If you have ever written an AmigaGuide before, then you should be able 
to pick up the EAC language fairly quickly. EAC is slightly more complex
and confusing than AmigaGuide and its syntax can be a pain in the arse
to get a grip of. BASIC programmers should also be able to create
adventures with EAC also fairly quickly as it has many similarities.

@NODE rule "EAC Programming Rules"
@{B}
EAC Programming Rules
@{UB}
As with all programming languages, there are certain rules that you
must follow when creating EAC adventure scripts. These are:

* All commands are UPPERCASE and have a colon after them.

* Each command MUST be on a separate line and located at the START
  of the line. No other text must included after the command or the 
  command and its arguments.

* Page names and variable names are case sensitive. i.e. if you
  have a page name as `MyHouse', EAC will not find `MyHouse' if you
  look for `myhouse'.

* Variable names MUST NOT begin with a number. i.e. Where: Chapter2 is
  legal, 2ndChapter is not. Also do not use any colons or commors in
  variable names.

@ENDNODE

@NODE brie "First Steps In EAC"
@{B}
First Steps In EAC
@{UB}
When a script is loaded EAC will search for a page name called 
`START' - Note that start is in CAPITALS:

                            PAGE:START

Each page must have an end. this is represented by using the command:

                            ENDPAGE: 

Any adventure text must go in between PAGE:[PAGENAME] and ENDPAGE: Any 
text left outside any pages will be ignored. This can be an advantage by
using this as a kind of reminder function.
  
AmigaGuide users will recognize that PAGE: and ENDPAGE: is similar to 
@NODE and @ENDNODE.


To go to a page use the command GOTO:[PAGENAME] like this:

                          GOTO:MyHouse

EAC will then look for a page named `MyHouse', which would be
in your script as PAGE:MyHouse [Case sensitive remember!]

To give the adventurer an option or options to go somewhere use
the command ADDOPT:[Text]:[PageName] You are limited to six options
per page. Use the command like this:

                  ADDOPT:Go into MyHouse:MyHouse

Unlike AmigaGuide, EAC uses a primitive variable system, which allows
you to store information about any items you may have or may not
have. To use a variable you must like many programming languages, 
firstly declare it. To do this use the command DEC:

                        DEC:[VariableName]

By using this command you can declare a variable name, which can 
be used later on in the adventure. *** NOTE *** All declarations of variables MUST be done before the start of the adventure script.

Okay, let me give you an example:

                           DEC:Knife

I have now declared a variable called `Knife' - Case sensitive
remember!! - which now equals zero. This could mean that I have
not collected it yet. We can also declare a variable and change its
value at the same time - like this:

                          DEC:Knife=1

Knife now has a value of 1 - which could mean I now have it. 
To change the value of `Knife' we will have to use the LET command,
like this:
                          LET:knife=2

I have now changed the value of Knife to 2. But have I? - No
actually. I deliberately made a mistake in the variable name.
By calling then variable `knife' instead of `Knife', EAC would have 
thrown a wobbly if I had done this in a real script. So remember 
- Case sensitive! It should be like this!:

                          LET:Knife=2

Now our Knife equals 2! Okay, so now we no how the variables work, do we
can use them in the various IF commands.

          ADDOPTIF:[VariableName=Value]:[Text]:[PageName]

The command ADDOPTIF: will only add an option IF a variable equals
a set value. i.e. Say we have the Knife which equals 1 we could
use ADDOPTIF: to give to option of stabbing someone (like my
brother!):

              ADDOPTIF:Knife=1:Stab the man:StabMan

If Knife=1 then we will be given the option of going to page `StabMan'. No such option will be given if Knife equals anything
else.

                    GOIF:[VaribleName]=[Value]

The command GOIF: is similar to the GOTO: command, however will
only goto a page IF the variable equals a set value (as in ADDOPTIF).
Example:

                    GOIF:NeedToilet=1:BathRoom

@{B}
A few other commands
@{UB}
                           EXEC:[FILENAME]

The command EXEC: will attempt to execute a program. This is good
for sound FX etc. i.e.

                EXEC:RUN >NIL Play16 Sounds:Cheer.snd


These commands will change to About requester in the game:

                        TITLE=[AdventureName]
                          AUTHOR=[YourName]
                      COPYRIGHT=[Copyright Info]


For more commands look at the EAC commands section.

GOIF:[Variable]=[Value]:
    [PageName]              :   Goes to the specified page name, only
                                if the variable equals the specified

                                EAC will look for PAGE:START every time
                                a script is loaded!

PAUSE:                      :   This command will cause the text

                                is ideal for pages with lots of lines,
                                as it gives the user time to read the

                                reccomend sticking to the first 7
                                colours, as many people will have
                                Magic Workbench installed.

QUIT:                       :   Forces EAC to Quit.

IF equal to...
@{UB}

In the given examples of GOIF: and various other IF: commands, I have
stated that the IF part is [VariableName]=[Value], however you ARE allowed
to do more that that. i.e. it is legal to do [VariableName]<>[Value] or
[VariableName]>=[Value]. It is even possible to do [VariableName]=[VariableName]

Firstly, what those symbols mean:

.-------.----------------------------------------------------.
|Symbol |  Meaning                                           |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------|
|  =    | Equal to.                                          |
|  <    | Lower than.                                        |
|  >    | Higher than.                                       |
|  <=   | Lower OR equal to. You can also do ` =< '.         |
|  =>   | Higher OR equal to. You can also do ` >= '.        |
|  <>   | Higher OR lower than. You can also do ` >< '       |
`-------·----------------------------------------------------'

ADDOPTIF:Apples=>3:You have more than two apples!:Eat_One

Example two:

Solutions:

1) Have you typed the page name correctly? Remember that page names ARE
case sensitive!

2) Make sure that there are no `hidden' characters in the page name or
PAGE: command. This can often be the case with both page names and
variable names.

3) Delete the entire line and re-type it.
