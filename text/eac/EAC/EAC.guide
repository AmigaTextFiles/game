@NODE INTR "Introduction"
@{BG SHINE}
    introduction
@{BG BACK}
So how many text adventures are there around the world? mmm... let me 
count. 1.2.20.145..214... Okay, so there's a hell of a lot of them, and
just about all of them are pretty boring, and with most text adventures you
are given some text and a rather sad text input requester for you to type
`Go north' or `Go south' countless times. 

EAC is not like that at all. There's is no typing, and the adventure possibilities are endless, with it's AmigaGuide style programming language.
By using a simple text editor such as Ed or Transwrite, it is possible to easily create wonderful text adventures for PD release.
@{BG SHINE}
    so what can EAC do?
@{BG BACK}
with EAC it is possible to include IFF ILBM pictures into your text adventures, which quickly remap to your current workbench palette. Standard
tracker modules can also be added into your adventures to give them that
extra bit of atmosphere. You can also place items such as keys, weapons and
treasure in your adventures by using a simple variable system.

Buttons
@{UI}
The only thing you will be needing to play a text adventure is the
six buttons at the bottom left hand corner of the window. Use these
buttons to go to different places, pick up items, activate switches
etc. A list telling you what each button will do or what affect it will
have on the adventure will usually be given.
@{I}
The `More' gadget
@{I}
The more gadget is used for adventures which have a lot of text, and is
used to unpause scrolling text. A and onscreen prompt will usually inform
you that there is more text.

    creating your own text adventures
@{BG BACK}
Hopefully, if EAC is a success, lots of different people will create
adventures for you to play with EAC. If this will happen, I don't really
know. I'll just have to wait for any feedback from this version. If you
would like to create your own adventures look in the Developers drawer, 
and hopefully there should be all the information there about programming
them.

If you create an adventure for EAC please do not hesitate to release it
into the public domain for other people to play, or you could even send 
us a copy of your adventure(s), which we may include along with the next
version of EAC.

You'll find a good few tutorials in the Developers drawer, which you
can load into a good text editor. Also read the UserManual.Guide
carefully for details about the EAC programming language.

Okay, lets get one thing straight. Any further developments of EAC will NOT
be released unless I get any kind of response from this version. So if you
like this program please contact me and say that you do! So at least I know
I am on to a good thing. If you don't, then I'm sorry, but EAC will most
likely die forever, and I will do something else :(
