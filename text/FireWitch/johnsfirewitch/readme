Thanks for choosing to try out "John's Fire Witch", a snack-sized beginner to
intermediary difficulty text adventure developed with TADS.  You should have
received the following files all in the same archive:

    firwitch.exe    IBM compatible executable for game.  If your operating
                    system is MS-DOS, this is all you need to play.

    firwitch.gam    TADS gamefile.  If your operating system is not MS-DOS,
                    you will need a copy of the TADS runtime program to
                    play the game.  You should be able to find TADS at the
                    same place you found this.  If not, it is available
                    by internet ftp at ftp.gmd.de under /if-archive.  You
                    can also try the High Energy BBS at (415) 493-2420.

    readme          This file.

If you wish to repackage the game and replace the IBM executable with some
other executable format, just contact me about it first.

"John's Fire Witch" is shareware.  Type "LICENSE" once you have the game
up and running for complete details, or email me at <baker-j@ix.netcom.com>.

You will not find my physical address anywhere within the game or documentation
because I move too often, so I plan on keeping the above email address for a
*long* time.  You should also be able to find me hanging out on the newsgroup
rec.arts.int-fiction.  If for some reason you *want* to register and just can't
get ahold of me, don't worry about it.  The game is not crippled.  Take the
registration money, buy a six pack of Sam Adams Cream Stout, and toast me while
you drink it.
