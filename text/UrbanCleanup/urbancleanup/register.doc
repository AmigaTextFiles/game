    WHY REGISTER URBAN CLEANUP?

  For two reasons.  One, it is illegal and unethical to own shareware
  for longer than the trial period without paying for it, and for another,
  you'll give me the much needed funds to create bigger and better
  games!  Also, it's only $10.  It doesn't mean much to *you*, but
  every $10 counts for me.
