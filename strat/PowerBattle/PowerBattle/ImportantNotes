IMPORTANT NOTES:


  - There is a preferences file that should be placed in S:
    directory.  Examine & adjust it to suit You.


  - Recommended inputs for new game:

    Coastal Cities:    30
    Mainland Cities:   40   (skip when no progress)
    Starting Cities:    5
    Technology Level:   0


  - It is now possible to enter the same hex occupied by enemy IF it
    is NOT the same battletype.

    Due to this feature, attack must be 'activated' by pressing the
    key 'a' before moving.  Remember that cities are ground units,
    therefor enemy ships MAY be there.

    A funny feature (untested, OOPS :-) but better one is under
    development..


  - Although it is now possible for several players to have units in
    same hex this is NOT recommended.  It possible for example to fly
    over enemy units, but definetly DO NOT stay in that hex.  If you
    do, everything will be just fine UNLESS somebody attacks to hex
    that has multiple players.  This is quite new feature, and will
    be fixed soon, in next version.  Meanwhile, force attack (press
    the key 'a') before moving to enemy hex, if it is not of the same
    battletype.

    Combat Report, too, will definetly NOT like multiple players in
    same hex YET.


  - Please report all bugs (not corcerning above thing).  Also report
    me if it works or not.  I haven't had a chance for example to test
    DBL -screen modes.  Just few things about screen modes:

    Screen sizes greater than 640 x 400 may have trouble with ZOOM x4
    on scroll-zoom-map (the thing you get by pressing u,o or p).  This
    bug is not mine but in the library I'm using.

    Some imaginary screen widths may cause bugs in ZOOM x4 as
    mentioned above, some overscanned lowres widths for example.
