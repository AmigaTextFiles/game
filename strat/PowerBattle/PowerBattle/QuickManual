                          -- INTRODUCTION --


PowerBattle is a light multiplayer strategygame.  Game is played on
hex-based map that is linked from edges.  Units are players' military
force that is used to conquer & defence & finally eliminate the enemy.
Cities produce more units.

                             -- UNITS --


Each UnitType has properties that represent units' abilities, for
example Moves (moving speed), HitPoints (general health) etc.

UnitTypes can be divided to groups.  Two most important groups are
MoveTypeGroup and BattleTypeGroup.

MoveTypeGroup tells where UnitType is allowed to move (and where NOT):
ground units may NOT move in water, big ships are NOT allowed to move
in low water etc.

BattleTypeGroup is one of the following:  AIR, GROUND, SEA or SUB.
Each UnitType has ATTACK- and DEFENCE-values for all these 4.  This
adds versatility while keeping rules relatively simple.




                              -- TIPS --


  * Press h to view help-screen.
  * Panel Buttons can be set from preferences.
  * In start, produce TBoat / MechInf units; search new cities.




                  -- SOME RULES CONCERNING START --


  - Requested number of cities are automatically placed to map
  - Players are placed as far from each as possible
  - All players start with (requested) n nearest cities
  - First five turns are 'Protected'.  No violence is allowed
  - During Protection players get multiple turns a time.
    Technology advance count all these turns.




                             -- MOVES --


In order to move:
  -Target terrain must be of suitable MoveType
  -Unit must have sufficiently MovingPoints (Moves)
  -Unit must have Fuel (if it uses fuel)
  -Target terrain must not have any other unit of same
   battletype OR target terrain must be city
  -In city there may only be maximum 12 units

TerrainHex's DamageThreat is constant representing how easily it may
damage units moving there.  Unit's ThreatDefence represents how much
it can turn away this kind of damage.  ThreatDefence may decrease if
unit is damaged.

  IF ThreatDefence < DamageThreat:

  LET Damage = (0-100% of DamageThreat) - (0-100% of ThreatDefence)

  If Damage is positive, HitPoints is decreased by damage.




                -- CLOSECOMBAT & ARTILLERY STRIKES --


Move to the same hex with enemy to enter CloseCombat.  Artillery
Strikes are separate, see controls.

In CloseCombat attacker's and defender's hex is active in turn.
Active hex's all units in turn try to damage other hex's units.  Then,
active hex is switched.

In Artillery Strikes only single attacker unit attempts to damage
units in the target hex.  There is a minimum distance of two hexes for
artillery attacks.


Here is an example of SINGLE damaging attempt.  Note:  'attacker'
doesn't have to be the one who started.


  Attacker: Panzer - GROUND unit
  Defender: Bomber - AIR    unit

  LET  Max_Attack  = Panzer's     AIR-Attack
  LET  Max_Defence = Bomber's  GROUND-Defence

  At this point, Max values are modified.  Possible modifications:
    -Veteran Bonus          * 1.0 - 1.5
    -Defence Bonus          * 0.1 - 2.0  (defence only)
    -Ranged Attack          * 0.5 - 3.0  (attack value)
    -Light Ground Modifier  * 0.1 - 2.0  (if defender is infantry)

  Modified values are Max_Mod_ -values.  Next:

  LET  Attack  = 25-100%  of  Max_Mod_Attack
  LET  Defence = 25-100%  of  Max_Mod_Defence
  LET  Damage  = Attack - Defence

  IF Damage is positive, defender's HitPoints is decreased by damage.




               -- SOME RULES CONCERNING CLOSECOMBAT --


Multiple players may have units in same hex.  Units wonät
automatically attack if they are not of same kind (battletype).  use
Force attack key, a, to force battle.




                       -- TRANSPORTER UNITS --


Transporters and Carriers can be used to transport, refuel & repair
units.  Only AT-Fighters or AT-Bombers may use Carrier.  During one
turn only limited number of units can be (un)loaded.

Loading:
  -Set 'Unit to be loaded nearby tranporter' to LoadPrep
  -Order Carrier to Load

Unloading:
  -Select unit from CargoList, with right mouse button

To cancel Unloading:
  -Select transporter with right mouse button on map (in the same hex)




          -- SOME RULES CONCERNING LOADING AND UNLOADING --


If carrier unit is AirTransport, only prachuted units can be unloaded
outside cities.  All infantry EXCLUDING basic infatry, are parachuted.

Air Transporter units can load only in cities.




                     -- REPAIRING & REFUELLING --


Units are automatically repaired & refuelled in cities and carriers.
Cities repair themselves only if they are set not to produce anything.




                       -- SPECIAL ABILITIES --


  - With Level command units can achieve
    - better Defence
    - decreased Vision & Visible-From ranges
    - decreased Moving Points
    - modified Ranged Attack Modifier (Artillery/Torpedo Strikes)
    - modifies Ranged Attack Range

    This equals to Infantry units' hiding & Submarine units' diving.
    No other units currently have this feature.

  - Settler units can build road and plain.  Instant.
  - Engineers units can build bridges.  Takes 2 turns to finish.

                            -- WANTED --


The game needs BADLY

  1) Automatic Map generator
  2) Computer Opponents - Artificial intelligence

If these can be achieved, there migth be a chance for commercial
product.  If You can offer me any kind of help or support or are
interested in co-operation, please contact.

For automatic map generator I have rough plans.  For computer
opponents' AI I have little more spesific plans, but it may take time
to get them working, and it will most likely require assembly coding.

Please note that 'PowerBattle' is only a project name, I've heard
there exists another game with the same name.
