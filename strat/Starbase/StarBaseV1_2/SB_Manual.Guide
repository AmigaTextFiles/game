@node GAME_MAIN "Start a new game"

  At first you can see a processing panel while creating a new planet.

     @{fg highlight}This doen't take much time so please hold on.@{fg text}

  Then you can see the game screen. At the top left corner you see the
  date (day, month and year) and your money. At the bottom left corner
  you see your colonists and your selected house to build.
   
  The big area in the centre is the @{"building side" link MAP_DISPLAY}. This is a 9 by 9 square
  cut out of the whole map which counts 64 by 64 squares. If you move
  your mouse pointer into it, an animated cursor appears instead of the
  mouse pointer. You can now normally move your mouse.

  There is also a small scrolling pad. Only Click onto the arrows to
  scroll the map into the selected direction. You can also use the right
  mouse button. Then the display scrolls two fields with one click. If
  you have a middle mouse button you can also use that. The 'C' in the
  centre will display the centre of the map at once.

  The screen under the game screen is the menu panel. The four little
  button indicates the playing speed. The 'Zz' symbol pauses the game, and
  the '1', '2' and '3' buttons sets the game speed to slow (1), medium (2)
  and fast (3). The long area above the menu buttons is the message line.
  Here you can see important messages about the game. The menu buttons
  controls all actions for the game. Please select a button to read more
  about this menu functions:

      1.) @{" Build Houses " link BUILD}             2.) @{"   Trading    " link TRADE}

      3.) @{" Map & Graphs " link MAP_GRAPHS}             4.) @{"See Production" link PRODUCTION}

      9.) @{"  Quit  Game  " link GAME_QUIT}            10.) @{"  Strategies  " link STRATEGY}

  Your aim is to destroy the bases of all four enemies and reach lots of
  of score with much money and colonists. Therefore you have to attack
  their bases with military units which must be produced by the appropriate
  buildings. You can buy tanks if you haven't enough, but space ships must
  be built.
  No, it is not enough only to build these houses. You also need colonists
  to support your base (mainly with the tax rate). So you also need some
  hydroponics and apartments for your colonists.
  And all buildings need electricity to work, so solar generators may also
  be built. And stores are needed to trade with your produced goods.

  For all this you have 150 years till the year 2340. If you can't reach
  this line you will be asked if you want to continue up to the year 2500.
  But then everything scores only 50 per cent. After it the game asks if
  you want to quit with your reached score or play until the end without
  scoring. Don't worry now. It sounds more difficult than it is.

  NO, I DIDN'T USE ANY CHEST KEYS TO REACH THIS AIM WHILE TESTING !!!

  If you don't believe me read the @{"Strategies" link STRATEGY} option.
  I don't think that this is too difficult. Now I only wish you good luck.

@endnode
@node MAP_DISPLAY "The map display area"

  I think you want to know how to build houses, right? Fine. Here we go...

  At first you require three things to build a house: money, granite and
  tools. (see menu @{"Build Houses" link BUILD} for required amount.) And then you need
  a free place to build, except OXYGEN PUMPS. They may only be built on a
  full field with oxygen moos. (see menu @{" Map & Graphs " link MAP_GRAPHS}) Now move your
  curser to the desired position and click with left mouse button. If you
  have all required things a building site appears. Otherwise you will get
  a message if something is missing.

  There are three other functions with the left mouse button. If you click
  on a building site you get an information about the built house and how
  long it will take to finish the building. You can also click on built
  houses. Then you get these special informations with the crime rate:

    *) WATER PUMP: amount of produced water (80% - 105%)

    *) OXYGEN PUMP: amount of produced oxygen (80% - 105%)

    *) STORE HOUSE: set up new military (see below...)

    *) GRANITE MINE: effeciency (0% -> no granite; else 66% - 100%)

    *) ORE MINE: effeciency (0% -> no ore; else 66% - 100%)

    *) FUEL PUMP: effeciency (0% -> no fuel; else 66% - 100%)

    *) SHIP YARD: initialize new construction order if ship yard is free
                  or you get a message of space ship type and how much has
                  already been done.

  All other houses will only display the crime rate. And finally you can
  click on activated military units. Then you see the left amount of fuel
  and its shield strength. You may select a new destination field or abort
  by moving the mouse to the menu panel.
 
  The right mouse button clears houses. Move your cursor to a built house
  and click on the right mouse button to remove it. This only requires 1%
  of the building price.
  If you click with the right mouse button on a activated military unit,
  you can destroy it. You had to confirm this action, but I think it will
  be better to attack your enemies than to destroy your units.

  The last thing I mention here is how to operate with activated military.
  Therefore you click onto a STORE HOUSE. Then a small menu screen appears
  and you can set the amount and type of a @{"military unit" link MILITARY} you wish to
  activate.
  You can see the currently active type and the stored amount. Use the '+'
  and '-' buttons to change to the next/previous type. At the right of the
  displayed units you can set your amount of stored units you wish to
  activate. Also use the '+' and '-' buttons. Finally you can see the
  amount of stored fuel and required fuel for your unit. Click on 'SET UP'
  to activate your new units or 'CANCEL' to abort.
   
  Now your military units will be set up on the map. If you click on it
  with the left mouse button you can set a destination field. Click on the
  edge of the map to attack your enemy. (also read page @{"Strategies" link STRATEGY})

  If you've destroyed the last house of your enemies' base, you will get a
  message and you capture 5 per cent of his earned money and some of his
  left goods, excatly 25 to 50 per cent. Therefore check the @{"spies report" link DEFENSE}.

@endnode
@node BUILD "Select building house"

  There you select your building. Use the 'PREV' and 'NEXT' buttons to
  scroll through all houses. A double click onto your choosen house will
  select it and quit back to the game screen. Read the following list for
  all informations about the houses:

  *) @{high "SOLAR GENERATOR"}:

     Cost: $2800 - Granite: 260 - Tools: 140 - Built: 18 - Crime: medium

     Produces 20 megawatt (MW) of electricity. You need it to support your
     houses with it. No electricity production makes your colonists move
     away.
     It's possible that a meteorite hides the sun rays and then the SOLAR
     GENERATOR stops the production.

  *) @{high "NUCLEAR PLANT"}:

     Cost:$24600 - Granite:2400 - Tools:1260 - Built: 68 - Crime: medium

     Produces 160 MW of energy. See SOLAR GENERATOR for main information.
     There is no risk because of meteorites.

  *) @{high "FISSON REACTOR"}:

     Cost:$92200 - Granite:8600 - Tools:4800 - Built:124 - Crime: medium

     Produces 800 MW of energy. See SOLAR GENERATOR for main information.
     There is no risk of meteorites. Built it, if you can affort it.

  *) @{high "ENERGY STORAGE"}:

     Cost: $8200 - Granite: 400 - Tools: 240 - Built: 38 - Crime: low

     Here you can store 80 MW of energy. This energy will be used if your
     base require more electricity than you can produce. Always built at
     least two ENERGY STORAGES !!! Build more, if you use many SOLAR
     GENERATORS, because of meteorites.
   
  *) @{high "WATER PUMP"}:

     Cost:$12600 - Granite: 800 - Tools: 380 - Built: 30 - Crime: high

     Also very important is a good water supply. You can build the pump
     anywhere, but near water field the production increases. On plain
     land you can produce 100 units of water, on a water field 175 units.
     The pump reaches the land around it in a 5 by 5 fields square. If you
     build another water pump into this area the production of both pumps
     is reduced by 600 units.
     You need water for your colonists and the HYDROPONICS. One colonist
     needs 4 units per month, the hydroponics needs 3 units to produce 10 
     units of food per month.
     Finally one water pump requires 5 MW of electricity and must be
     supported with $30 per month (see @{" View  Report " link REPORT}).

     NOTE: If required, 1 unit of water could be about 100 liters. (?)

  *) @{high "WATER STORE"}:

     Cost: $4200 - Granite: 220 - Tools: 100 - Built: 22 - Crime: low

     This building stores 1600 units of water. Don't forget to build some
     of this storages, otherwise you can't trade with water and your
     colonists aren't lucky if they are thirsty. This building needs 1 MW
     of energy.

  *) @{high "OXYGEN PUMP"}

     Cost:$16200 - Granite:1360 - Tools: 780 - Built: 42 - Crime: high

     As you can imagine your colonists also need some oxygen to breath.
     The oxygen pump may only be build on a full field with oxygen moos,
     and produces 100 units on edges, 125  units on nearly full field with
     oxygen and 150 units on full fields. As the water pump the oxygen pump
     also reaches a 5 by 5 fields square. And a new pump into this are also
     reduced the production of both pumps by 600 units.
     One colonist needs 2 units of oxygen, and a HYDROPONICS only uses 1
     unit of oxygen for 10 units of food. The oxygen pump requires 7 MW of
     energy and must be supported with $30 per month.

  *) @{high "OXYGEN STORAGE"}:

     Cost: $5200 - Granite: 260 - Tools: 120 - Built: 20 - Crime: low

     This building stores 1600 units of oxygen. Don't foreget to build at
     least two oxygen storages. You don't want your people to suffocate.
     You also need oxygen storages to trade with oxygen. This building
     requires 2 MW of energy to store oxygen.

  *) @{high "HYDROPONICS"}:

     Cost: $7200 - Granite: 540 - Tools: 280 - Built: 32 - Crime: medium

     Produces 1600 units of food. Therefore the building needs 480 liters
     of water and 160 units of oxygen to produce a maximum of 1600 units
     of food. In detail the building produces 10 units of food with 3 units
     of water and 1 unit oxygen. One hydroponics requires 5 MW of energy
     and costs $50 per month.
     Coordinate these buildings with the food rate (see @{" View  Report " link REPORT})
     that your people have always enough to eat.

     NOTE: A high food production and food rate encourage more people to
           join your base !!!

  *) @{high "APARTMENT"}:

     Cost: $9600 - Granite: 780 - Tools: 360 - Built: 36 - Crime: medium

     This building offers apartments for 200 colonists. Make sure that
     there are always enough APARTMENTS. Otherwise your colonists leave
     your base very early. You need 10 MW to support this colonists with
     energy.

  *) @{high "SECURITY FORCE"}:

     Cost: $6800 - Granite: 640 - Tools: 300 - Built: 34 - Crime: none
      
     You need a SECURITY FORCE to protect you colonists against crime.
     One SECURITY FORCE works in a circle with a radius of 4 fields around
     the building. With increasing distance the protection reduces.
     Use the 'SECURITY' button at the @{" Map & Graphs " link MAP_GRAPHS} menu to see the
     effeciency of your security forces. One security force needs 6 MW of
     energy and costs $50 per month.

  *) @{high "STORE HOUSE"}:

     Cost: $2400 - Granite: 160 - Tools: 100 - Built: 14 - Crime: low

     These important building stores all goods except energy, water, oxygen
     and fuel. You need it if you want to sell goods. Only previously
     stored good can be sold !!! You also need 1 MW of energy to support
     this building.

     One STORE HOUSE can hold: 2400 food, 40 gems, 2000 granite, 1600 ore,
                               1200 tools, 600 arms and 20 tanks.

  *) @{high "FUEL PUMP"}:

     Cost: $9800 - Granite:1160 - Tools: 480 - Built: 37 - Crime: high

     There you can produce from 132 to 200 fuel. You need them to support
     your military units with fuel. If they have no fuel anymore they stop
     moving and will be refilled automatically at the end of the month. 
     Remember that you need a fuel resource under the building to produce
     something. Use the 'RAW MAT.' button at the @{" Map & Graphs " link MAP_GRAPHS} menu to
     locate some fuel. A fuel pump also needs 7 MW of energy and costs $40
     per month.

  *) @{high "FUEL STORAGE"}:

     Cost: $5600 - Granite: 400 - Tools: 160 - Built: 24 - Crime: low

     This building stores 1200 units of fuel. Don't forget to build at
     least two fuel storages. I think you want your tanks to move and
     fuel pumps can't support them. All your tanks get the required fuel
     from the fuel storages. You also need fuel storages to trade with
     fuel. This building requires 3 MW of energy to store fuel.

  *) @{high "GEM FACTORY"}:

     Cost:$23400 - Granite:1780 - Tools: 840 - Built: 60 - Crime: very high

     A special smelting procedure with fuel makes it possible to produce
     gems. This factory smelts 50 fuel into 1 gem. They are very useful
     for trading. But be sure that all your tanks still get enough fuel.
     Also remember to support your gem factories with 13 MW of energy and
     $80 per month.


  *) @{high "GRANITE MINE"}:

     Cost: $8800 - Granite: 920 - Tools: 420 - Built: 31 - Crime: high

     There you can produce from 132 to 200 granite per month, depending
     on the workers effeciency. This is a very important raw material.
     You need it to build new houses. You can built GRANITE MINES anywhere,
     but it will only produce something over an granite field. (Use the
     'RAW MAT.' button at the @{" Map & Graphs " link MAP_GRAPHS} menu) This building requires
     4 MW of energy and costs $40 per month.

  *) @{high "ORE MINE"}:

     Cost: $9400 - Granite:1220 - Tools: 580 - Built: 35 - Crime: high

     There you can produce from 132 to 200 ore per month, depending on the
     workers effeciency. This is a very important raw material. You need it
     to produce tools, and the ship yards require ore to work on the space
     ships. You can built them anywhere, but it will only produce something
     over an ore field. (See 'RAW MAT.' button at the @{" Map & Graphs " link MAP_GRAPHS} menu)
     This building requires 8 MW of energy and costs $40 per month.

  *) @{high "TOOL FACTORY"}:

     Cost:$11200 - Granite:1840 - Tools: 880 - Built: 41 - Crime: very high

     The most important building. There you process 100 ore into 100 tools.
     You need tools for all buildings, so look forward and build many tool
     factories. But remember that you need 10 MW of energy and that you
     need $50 per month to support it.

  *) @{high "ARMS MANUFACTORER"}:

     Cost:$14400 - Granite:1620 - Tools: 760 - Built: 46 - Crime: very high

     Here you can process 100 Tools into 25 arms. You need arms to produce
     tanks for fighting with your enemies. Don't process all your tools.
     You may need some for new buildings. One arms manufactorer needs 12 MW
     of energy and costs $60 per month.

  *) @{high "TANK FACTORY"}:

     Cost:$18800 - Granite:2100 - Tools: 940 - Built: 55 - Crime: very high

     This factory processes 50 arms into 1 tank. Use them to attack your
     enemies. Always keep some tanks stored in case of an counter attack
     of an enemy. You need 14 MW of energy and $80 per month to support a
     tank factory.

  *) @{high "SHIP YARD"}:

     Cost:$20600 - Granite:2240 - Tools:1060 - Built: 62 - Crime: very high

     There you built your space ships. One SHIP YARD uses 32 ore per month
     to work on a space ship. If your space ship has been finished, you get
     a message and it will be stored in a STORE HOUSE. Then the SHIP YARD
     is free to build a new space ship. You need 15 MW of energy and $100
     per month to support a ship yard. You are limited to 32 ship yards
     for the whole game. (Don't worry !!! Each computer player is limited
     to 16 ship yards.)
 
  So that's all. Finally you find under each building the amount you have
  already built. Use the @{"index" link INDEX} if you only need a short information about
  all houses.

@endnode
@node TRADE "Trading screen"

  There you can buy or sell goods. At the left side you can see all goods,
  then the price for buying, the price for selling and finally the amount
  of your stored goods. With the last column you set the number of units
  you want to trade with. Click with the left mouse button to change units
  by one, the right mouse button changes the value by 10, a middle button
  will change the value by 100.

  On the right side are 3 buttons:
    
    *) @{b}BUY@{ub}: Here you buy the amount of units you entered before. Be sure
            that you have enough store houses for the goods. You can't
            buy more units than you are able to store. I hope you are
            familiar with the basics of economic. Then you know that the
            price will raise if you buy many goods.
      
    *) @{b}SELL@{ub}: This button sells the amount of units you entered before.
             Remember that the price will fall if you sell too many units.
             But the minimum you can get is $1 per good per unit.
      
    *) @{b}OK@{ub}: Quits the screen without any actions.

  I think this is a very important option. If you sell many units at once
  you'll get lots of money to build new houses. Surely the price falls
  then, but you can be sure that the price will raise slowly.

@endnode
@node MAP_GRAPHS "Map & Graphs - Overview about the base"

  This is also a very important and useful menu. At the left side you
  have the whole map and can select 5 different displays. The right side
  contains 15 graphic displays for the last 5 years. Here is a short
  introduction to all buttons:

  *) left side:

    *) @{b}RAW MAT.@{ub}: This button displays all available raw materials on the
            planet. The different raw materials will be show with these
            colours:   GRANITE -> grey, ORE -> red, FUEL -> cyan
      
    *) @{b}BASE@{ub}: Displays all houses of your base with different colours.
            I'm sorry, but I can't display a colour list here, so it's
            on your own to find them out. I hope I've chosen the colours
            so that they will match with the appropriate house.

    *) @{b}MILITARY@{ub}: Shows you all military units on map. Your tanks will be
            displayed in dark red, your space ships with light red. All
            enemies' tanks are shown in dark green, and their space ships
            with light green. Explosions are shown in yellow, And finally
            your base will be displayed with light brown.

    *) @{b}SECURITY@{ub}: displays the working area of the security forces.
            The lighter the colour the better the security is working.
      
    *) @{b}CRIME@{ub}: displays the crime for every used field. The lighter
            the colour the higher the crime rate is there. And your 
            colonists don't like it if the crime rate for the whole base
            raises 5 per cent.
   
    *) @{b}OKAY@{ub}: leaves this page and return to the game screen.

    All display modes shows water (blue), oxygen (yellow), hills (light
    brown) and unused land (dark brown). If you click onto the map you
    can directly move to another area.

  *) right side:

    *) @{b}MONEY@{ub}: Shows your development of your money. Sometimes it's very
            useful to know when you have spent lots of money on building
            new houses or sold lots of goods.
      
    *) @{b}COLONISTS@{ub}: Shows you the amount of your colonists. With a little
            study combinated with other buttons here, this could be very
            useful.
      
    *) @{b}BUILDINGS@{ub}: Shows you the amount of your build houses. This graph
            only dislays the size of your base that your can compare it
            with your enemies.

    *) @{b}MILITARY@{ub}: here you can see the strength of all active units.
            Check this graph if you have been attacked by an enemy to see
            the left strength of your military.

    *) @{b}CRIME@{ub}: also very useful is the crime rate graph. The display shows
            the relative percentage of crime at your base. Check this
            graph regularly. Did I mention the 5 per cent limit of your
            colonists which makes them feel secure ?

    The other 10 buttons displays the price development. If you watch
    them carefully you can sell or buy units more effective.

@node PRODUCTION "See base production"

  This screen displays your production. The first column shows the current
  production for this month. The second column display the stored goods.
  And the third column shown the maximum of stored goods.
   
  The production graph at the right side displays your production of the
  last five years. Only click onto the line of the good you wish to view
  the graph. This line is surrounded with a red box.
  The graph displays positive production with green bars up, are negative
  production with red bars down. And you can also see the maximum and
  minimum production.

  The last line displays your stored space ships: amount of fighter (Fi),
  amount of cruiser (Cr) and amount of warships (Wa). Click on this line
  and you will see a list of your ship yards, with the following infos:

    <position> <type> <worked> <todo>   or   <position> Ready.

  Where <position> are the (x,y) coordinates, type is actually the type
  of space ship your are building there, <worked> contains already used
  ore and <todo> is the required month to finish with the current budget
  setting for your ship yards. If there is no space ship order you get
  the 'Ready.' message.

  Make sure that you always have enough granite and tools. You need them
  to build houses! Also have enough ore! You need ore for your ship yards
  and tools. Click on the 'OKAY' button to quit back to the game.

@endnode
@node DEFENSE "Contact with enemies"

  Here you get some information (all you need) about your enemies.
   
  At first use the four arrows to select an enemy. If you own some spies
  there you get a report. You can also see if you have some military units
  which attacks the base at the top right corner. (the crossing swords)

  With the 'BUY' button you can buy a new spy at the base. The more spies
  you have the more informations you get. You can see your number of spies
  at the top left corner. The number next to the 'BUY' button displays the
  cost for the next spy. You can only buy 9 spies per base.
  
  Under the first line are two big areas. On the left you can see 5 basic
  informations:

    *) @{b}CASH@{ub}: displays the enemy's money
    *) @{b}COLONISTS@{ub}: display number of colonists
    *) @{b}BUILDINGS@{ub}: display number of enemy's buildings
    *) @{b}SECURITY@{ub}: display number of security forces
    *) @{b}MILITARY@{ub}: displays amount of owned military strength

  You can activate this 5 informations by buying 1 to 5 spies. The first
  displays your enemies money, the second displays the colonists and so on.

  Then you can buy another 4 spies. The sixth spy reports all building
  actions, the seventh spy reports if your enemy trades, the eighth spy
  shows you the enemies production and the nineth spy reports when the
  enemy plans to attack your base or builds new space ship.
   
  All 4 spies displays their report at the right side of the screen. There
  are only 8 lines to display this informations, so check these reports
  more often the more spies you own there.

  Use the @{b}OK@{ub} button to return to the game screen.

  NOTE: All houses are also built by the computer but with no building
        sites. The computer also sells goods to get more money, so don't
        be surprised when the price suddenly falls and you havn't sold
        any goods! (But space ships must be built like you do.)

  NOTE: It's more difficult to destroy a house if there are more security
        forces. Don't wait too long to attack your enemies. Start with
        the easierst base to destroy about 2210. You will need several
        years if there are also more than 5 tank factories.

@node REPORT "View base report"

  This option displays the base report. There you can see how many costs
  you have and the current cash flow. With the '-' and '+' buttons you
  can set the support and with it the effeciency. Now a list of the costs:

   *) @{b}WATER PUMP@{ub}s costs $30 per month and building
   *) @{b}OXYGEN PUMP@{ub}s costs $30 per month and building
   *) @{b}HYDROPONICS@{ub} costs $50 per month and building
   *) @{b}SECUTRITY FORCE@{ub}s costs $50 per month and building
   *) @{b}FUEL PUMP@{ub}s costs $40 per month and building
   *) @{b}GEM FACTORY@{ub} costs $80 per month and building
   *) @{b}GRANITE MINE@{ub}s costs $40 per month and building
   *) @{b}ORE MINE@{ub}s costs $40 per month and building
   *) @{b}TOOL FACTORY@{ub} costs $50 per month and building
   *) @{b}ARMS MANUFACTORER@{ub} costs $60 per month and building
   *) @{b}TANK FACTORY@{ub} costs $80 per month and building
   *) @{b}SHIP YARD@{ub} costs $90 per month and building
   *) Spies costs 1 per cent of their next buy costs per month

  There are also two ways you get money back:

   *) The tax of your colonists. One colonist would pay 25 money with 100
      per cent tax rate. You can set the tax rate from 0 to 50 per cent.
      Don't set it too high for a long time. The colonists don't like that.
      (eg. 5000 colonists pays $22500 with 18 per cent tax rate. Alright?)

   *) Trading (will be added at once, so it isn't displayed here)

  Then you can set the food rate for you colonists from 5 to 50 units
  of food per colonist. The higher this value the more colonists wants
  to join your base. But remember that you need lots of hydroponics to
  produce that much food. And with it more water pumps and oxygen pumps.
  The best values are 12 at the begining and 8 later in the game.

  And at the right side is a comparative graph. Here you can see how good
  you are working relative to the enemies. There are four types: MONEY,
  COLONISTS, BUILDINGS and MILITARY. Your value is displayed in white.
  Your enemies are red, yellow, green and blue. The four little button
  with the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 5 on it sets the displayed range in years.
  And finally there are 10 lines which display all 10 per cent values.

  Remember that you will see this report at the end of every month. Then
  the cash flow will be added to your money. If you change your settings
  before this day you can watch the effects at the @{"See Production" link PRODUCTION} menu.

  NOTE: You, the player, has always 100 per cent at the graphs. The values
        of the enemies will be subtracted from your 100 per cent rate.
        This looks at little bit funny at the MILITARY graph, especially
        at the begining of the game. I tried to avoid rounding problems
        with integer values, so if you add all values together, you maybe
        get values of 99 or 101 per cent. Sorry.

@node GAME_LOAD "Load a base"

  There only a file requester appears and asks you to select a base to
  load. There are several checks that the file is really a STARBASE file
  so don't try to load another file. Otherwise the game won't work
  correctly, which can crash your Amiga! (Oops)
  All displays will be updated at once and the game continues as normal.

  If you load a game from the main menu the display will appear after
  the loading process.

  NOTE: This is not the system file requester. As you noticed it is
        reduced to a single directory. This directory must be loacted in
        the source directory from where you start the game and must be
        called 'SavedGames'. If the program can't find this directory
        it will be automatically created. You also can't edit your
        entered file name with the arrow keys. And finally only files
        with '.BASE' at the end are displayed.

@endnode
@node GAME_SAVE "Save a base"

  Here you can save a base. Only enter a file name and click onto the
  'OKAY' button to save your base. If you file already exists you have
  to confirm your action to overwrite it.

  NOTE: Please also read the @{"Load Game" link GAME_LOAD} describtion for more details
        about the file selector.

@node GAME_QUIT "Quit a base"

  Quits the game. You can either quit to main screen and let the game
  check for a hiscore. Then a scoring will appear first. Or you can quit
  directly to workbench without hiscore test.

  If you have reached a new hiscore you can enter your name afterwards,
  which is limited to 24 characters.

@node STRATEGY "Some hints to get started"

  The last time: THERE ARE NO CHEAT KEYS !!!   Alright ???   Fine !!!

  As you realized you can sell more when you build more granite mines, ore
  mines, fuel pumps and factories. I think that's the most important thing
  to remember. The more you invest into raw materials and factories the
  more goods you can sell. (But not too much !) And therefore you can
  extend your base and buy tanks (many tanks !!!) to attack your enemies.
  You don't need any special economic tricks to built up a good base and
  defeat your enemies, really. 
  There is only some things I will tell you: build many TOOL FACTORIES. At
  least enough to produce about 1200 tools per month. This also requires
  more ORE MINES (about 16 or 20). Before you start a base check the map
  if all raw materials (granite, ore, fuel), water and oxygen are quite
  good placed in the centre of the map. It could be very frustrating if
  you can't protect your OXYGEN PUMPS or ORE MINES if they are placed very
  close to the edge and your enemy destroyes them always at first.
  You also don't need to build up a base with 20000 colonists or more.
  Earn lot of money, defeat your enemies very early (start about 2205) and
  protect your base. Just have a look at 'Tutorial.BASE'.

  NOTE: I really played this game! No cheats and no extra money. I also
        didn't change the computer to silly players. Just produce enough
        goods to sell, especially granite and tools to build houses.
   
  This isn't @{i}SIM CITY 2000 @{ui}nor @{i}A-TRAIN @{ui}!!! Yes, a little bit of @{i}UTOPIA @{ui}.
  Which was the basic reason, because 'UTOPIA' didn't work on my A4000.

@endnode
@node MILITARY "All about military units"

  The most important part of the game are military units. There are four
  types available:

  TANKS:
  ~~~~~~
    These are the most comfortable (and expensive ?) units to produce.
    You need to build TOOL FACTORIES, ARMS MANUFACTORER and finally TANK
    FACTORIES. Tanks will be produced every month! You can also buy some
    tanks, if you have room to store them in your STORE HOUSES before
    activating them.

  FIGHTER:
  ~~~~~~~~
    This is only a small space ship, which is not very good in fighting
    with other space ships, but you can use it to break through a tank
    barrier in the last stage of your attacks.

  CRUISER:
  ~~~~~~~~
    A larger space ship than a fighter. Very good for defense, because
    it takes a acceptable time to build. But there is also no chance if
    you had to fight against several warships.

  WARSHIP:
  ~~~~~~~~
    The largest space ship your can build. It takes very long to build
    (nearly 2 years), so it always good to attack your enemies or defeat
    attacking military of your enemies. Start to build them very early
    that you have enough by about 2205.

  After this short introduction read through the following table for all
  important destails:
   
             | shield | strength | requires | max. fuel | fuel usage
    ---------+--------+----------+----------+-----------+------------
     tank    |   12   |     2    |  50 ARMS |      60   |      1
     fighter |   48   |     6    |  288 ORE |     400   |      4
     cruiser |   72   |    11    |  480 ORE |     720   |     10
     warship |  108   |    17    |  704 ORE |    1280   |     16

  If your SHIP YARD has enough ore every month the space ships requires
  these production time to finish: (otherwise it takes longer !!)

     fighter -> 9 months, cruiser -> 15 months, warship -> 22 months

  Military units on water fields are hovering and therefore require one
  fuel usage per month. Remember this and have enough fuel to refill these
  units or they will be destroyed. ( -> sinks into water, causes a short
  circuit which leads to system malfunctions and finally an explosion! )

  At the end of every month all military will be refilled, if they run
  out of fuel. And damaged space ships will be repaired with 4 shield
  strength. But I suggest to attack your enemy if a warship is damaged
  with shield strength of 32, because it would take about 19 months to
  repair it. So you could also built a new one!

  NOTE: If you set up new military units remember that every unit needs
        maximum fuel. The same applies for all enemies too. So the attacks
        of your enemies starts if they also have enough fuel to support
        their military units.
