This is Freeciv 1.7 AMIGA compile for Xgeek!


FILES

   Needed files:

      FreeCiv1.7-020.lha  OR  FreeCiv1.7-040.lha
      FreeCiv1.7-dat.lha
      FreeCiv1.7-xpm.lha

      FreeCiv1.7-src.lha (only needed for recompile)

      (from Aminet, e.g.
       ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/systems/amiga/aminet/game/2play/)


   Additionally needed files when using AmiWin (registered):

      X-11R6.3-ixlib-bin.tgz

      (from Geek Gadgets, e.g. http://www.ninemoons.com/ or on CD (!!) )


   Additionally needed files when using AmiWin (unregistered):

      X-11R6.3-ixlib-bin.tgz
      X-11R6.3-fonts-bin.tgz

      (from Geek Gadgets, e.g. http://www.ninemoons.com/ or on CD (!!) )

   NOTE: '.tgz' means '.tar.gz'! So you maybe need a GUNZIP tool to unpack
         the file(s) - this creates a '.tar' file - and a TAR tool to
         list/extract the files inside of the '.tar' file !! These tools
         are available from Aminet, too.


INSTALLATION:

Unpack FreeCiv to wherever you like. Start "InstallXPM" to install
the libXpm.ixlibrary to GG:Sys/libs (it is included in the GG package,
but as src only).

If you use AmiWin, you should first unpack FreeCiv to wherever you like.
Then copy libXpm.ixlibrary by hand to LIBS:. Unpack X-11R6.3-ixlib-
bin.tgz and copy the files from the Sys/Libs/ directory to LIBS:. The
other dirs aren't useful for you.

If you use the unregistered version of AmiWin, you should register ;-).
Or you unpack X-11R6.3-fonts-bin.tgz and copy the whole directory
X11R6.3/lib/X11/fonts/misc to AmiWin/x11/lib/x11/fonts/misc (you should
first backup your old 'misc'). Perform all the steps from above, too.


USAGE:

Start your TCP/IP stack LOCALLY (you don't need a connection to your internet
provider if you play locally, but server and client communicate via IP).
Start the XServer (Xgeek: see GeekGadgets docs for usage - AmiWin: see AmiWin
docs for usage; it's not that easy :-( ). This should open a new screen. Go
back to workbench.

Open a shell, cd into the FreeCiv directory. Type

	Stack 100000
	civserver -n

You should see

	Freeciv version 1.7.0 server
	> 1: Now accepting new client connections

Now the FreeCiv server is running. Let's start the client. Open a second shell,
cd into FreeCiv dir. Type

	setenv DISPLAY "localhost:0"
	Stack 300000
	civclient 

Now you should change back to your XServer screen where the client window
appears. See README and HOWTOPLAY for further usage and tips.


HINT FOR AMIWIN USERS:

Normally, AmiWin only allowes connections from programs compiled especially
for Amiwin, so it prevents the FreeCiv client from opening the window.
There are several ways to suppress this:

      - turn off 'Access security' at the 'Security' page
      - add 'localhost' to the 'Authorized hosts' list at the 'Security'
        page
      - type a 'xhost + ' (note the trailing SPACE!) or 'xhost +localhost'
        into the shell
      - add '127.0.0.1' to X11:etc/X0.hosts
        (works permanently and should be preferred; AmiWin reads this file
         only once at startup, so you eventually have to restart it)

After one of these changes is made there should not occure a problem with
AmiWin together with FreeCiv any more.


ADAPTATION:

Only a few modifications had to be done to compile and use FreeCiv with the
GeekGadgets package:

- The XServer Xgeek does not seem to handle the keypad keys right, so I had
  to change the internal mapping. As a side effect you can play FreeCiv even
  without a keypad at all (A600).
  (FIXED in 1.0)

- The Amiga version seemed to hang from time to time while decreasing the hit
  points of two fighting units. This bug was first mentioned by Lindqvist Marko
  (thanx for reporting!).
  (FIXED in 2.0)

- While fixing the above mentioned bug I added a new feature: You can now
  watch the hit points decrease; previously this was done in milliseconds ;-).
  Now every fight takes one second.

There are versions for 020 and 040; automatic stack extension is turned off,
so always use a large stack (100,000-300,000 should be enough).
