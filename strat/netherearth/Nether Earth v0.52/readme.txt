Version 0.52 has been made by Sergey Popov AKA Marlock Blaker (from Russia) and includes the following changes:
  - bullets go through half-height walls (and robots use it:)
  - new born robot walks 9 steps only, then stops (before, only an obstacle could stop it)
  - enemy robots are produced from all warbases, not only that one closer to factories
  - human and enemy buildings have flags on opposite sides (like in original)
  - initial zoom is 2 times less, and not reseted after being changed
  - you can zoom in/out using ± (as well as PgUp/PgDn)
  - zoom out margin extended 2 times, now you can see all field in most of the maps
  - left/up and right/down changed to how it was in original
  - in menu, after giving order, cursor stands on "LEAVE ROBOT"
  - in construction menu, the default option is "BIPODS"
  - radar shows low-height walls with slightly lighter color

Version 0.51 just allows you to change the colour depth, switch off the radar, and the maps
             have a separate folder.
Version 0.5 fixes small bugs of v0.41, also includes 5 extra maps designed by collaborators
