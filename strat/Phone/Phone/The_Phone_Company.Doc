Instructions:
-------------
The  Phone Company was in deep trouble.  There were many people, who wanted
to  get  connected  to  the  Net, but the Phone Company only had an limited
amount of wire.  Further the country in which these people happened to live
in  was not just plain, but full of high mountains, deep rivers, and highly
frequented  roads.   So  the  Phone  Company decided, that what they really
needed was an expert.

This  is,  where you get involved.  You can help the Phone Company by using
the Landscape-Design program called 'The Phone Company', which can be found
on this disk.

Once  you  start  the  program and pass the welcome-text, you will see some
kind of main-menu, where you can choose whether to solve some mind-boggling
phone-problems  (Game),  or  to  design  some problems (=level) by your own
(Editor).


Rules of the game
-----------------
When  you  choose  to  solve problems, you will be asked, which problem you
specifically  mean,  i.e.   which  level  you want to play.  Just enter the
number  and  the according level will be loaded.  (Sorry there are only six
different  level  on  the  disk,  but  I  just  couldn't  think of any more
difficult  ones  -  maybe you can.  If so, feel free to send me a disk with
your  own levels.  If you are not the only one who does so, I will send you
a  disk  with  the level, other people sent me.  However, I can't guarantie
that there's anybody who plays this game at all :-).

The  playfield  ocupies  most part of the screen.  In the lower half of the
screen  some  values are displayed.  These should tell you, which playfield
you are actually on, and how many wire, dynamite, bridges and tubes you got
left  to  solve the level.  If you are tired of solving this specific level
and  want  to  see another one, just click on the gadget which you think of
expressing  your wishes best.  When you think you have solved all problems,
click  on  the  gadget  'Test the Net'.  You will then get to see, how 'The
Phone Company' tests your work, and being notified, if you did well or not.

How do I play?
--------------
You  can  lay  a  wire  just by positioning the mousepointer at the desired
position  and  clicking  the left mousebutton.  You can retain this wire by
clicking the right button.  When laying an wire throughout an mountain, you
automatically  use one Unit of Dynamite.  Doing so with roads uses an tube,
handling wires on water will use a bridge.

What do all these different colors mean?
----------------------------------------
The  specific  landscape  is represented by these funny colored hexagons on
the screen.  The colors mean:

Green   - Nothing (Plain grass)
Blue    - Water
Brown   - Mountains
Gray    - Road
Yellow  - Wire
Red     - Somebody waiting to get connected to the Net
Black   - When you notice a black hexagon in any playfield, you should
          immidiatly go and visit you optician :-).

How to win
----------
You  have  solved  the  level,  when  you  layed the wire to the form, that
everybody  is  connected  to everybody else, that means, that all these red
hexagons  are  connected  to each other by yellow hexagons.  To make things
more  easy  a  person is connected to another person, when there is a third
person,  who  is connected to both of them.  For expample:  if Mr.  Kohl is
connected  to  Mr.   Kraut,  and Mr.  Kraut is connected to Mr.  Meier, Mr.
Kohl is automatically also connected to Mr.  Meier.

When  you  get  the  impression,  that all the people are connected to each
other,  just  try  clicking  on  'Test the Net'.  When doing so, 'The Phone
Company'  will  test  if  you  worked  properly.  If not so, a note will be
displayed  in  the  upper  half  of  the screen, where everything else, the
programmer thought somebody might be interested in, is displayed too.

If  you  actually solved all the problems, you get lots and lots of points,
where one point is given for a wire you did not use, and two for everything
else nobody wanted (bridges, tubes and dynamite).  In order not to increase
your stress-level, I did not build in an time-limit.


How to build level on your own
------------------------------
When you are tired of playing and want to edit some level of your own, just
choose  'Editor' instead of 'Game' in the main menu.  In the Editor you can
design  the  landscape  by  pressing  the  left or right mousebutton at the
disired  position  (just  play  around a bit).  In the lower section of the
screen,  you can determine, how many wires, dynamite, tubes and bridges one
can  use  by  solving  this level, and which level you're actually editing.
Further there are two gadgets which allow you to load and save playfields.


How to leave...
---------------
You  can  end  every  part  of  the  program  by  clicking on the according
window-closing-gadget.
