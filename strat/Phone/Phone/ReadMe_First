Before starting 'The Phone Company', you have to copy the file
'mmv8.library' to your 'libs:' directory.

'The Phone Company' assumes all Playfield- and Sound-Data to be in the
Root-Directory.

When starting the program out of the Shell, you have to change to the
according directory via the 'CD'-Command. Before starting the game you have
to increase the stack-size by typing 'Stack 20000'.
