DEAD METAL II (Strategy Gaming)

Welcome to Dead Metal. Your mission General is to capture the REACTOR
ICON it will not be easy, your plans have fallen into enemy hands and
they are ready for you.

Click the right mouse button to scroll the map have a look round for
your UNITS and click the right mouse button again.
Move the YELLOW pointer over one of your units. Your units are
identified by having a RED gun muzzle. A RED or BLUE (BLUE denotes Light
Tanks) circle will show your unit and the YELLOW pointer will turn GREEN.

Click the left mouse button and the direction pointers will appear. With
the arrow icon you can scroll the map by moving the arrow icon to the
top, bottom, left or right of the map. Now move the arrow icon over your
unit and click the left mouse button. The move icon will now appear.
Move over one of the RED WHITE or YELLOW direction pointers and click the
left mouse button to move your unit in that direction.

The enemy will now take its move. The YELLOW icon on the top right of
the screen represents each enemy unit. Enemy units have a YELLOW gun
muzzle. You will see a small RED icon move across the YELLOW icon. Each
YELLOW line represents an enemy unit. (When an enemy is Destroyed one of
the YELLOW stripes will turn off)

The horizontal GREEN, YELLOW and RED icon which moves up as each unit
has it`s move denotes:-

                     ENEMY in Range
                     GREEN = easy thinking (Enemy Looking For You Close)
                     YELLOW = medium thinking ( Getting Closer )
                     RED = hard thinking (Watch Out)

You must wait for your move. When it`s your move this will be denoted
by a pointing hand at the top left of the screen.

If you moved and have not been destroyed there will be a GREEN REACTOR
icon over your unit. You will be ready to fire at something. To do this
move the mouse fire icon over a target. If you move it over an enemy
unit it will turn RED. (RED cross in the Cross Hires Denotes Heavy-Tank)
Press the left mouse button to fire.

The bottom left of the screen the RED flashing numbers indicate your
fire power and the flashing YELLOW numbers on the right indicate the
defensive values of the enemy unit you are firing at. The RED (1-6max)
number must be higher than the YELLOW (1-6max) number in order to
destroy the enemy unit.( Etc Infantry Firing at Heavy Tank Long Range
The RED Numbers May Only Get Up To 1-4 And The YELLOW Numbers-(De-fence
Value Enemy) May Be 6 You Can Not Do Any DAMAGE).

Tanks have Armour all around them:-

                     Front Armour value is +5
                     Side Armour value is +1
                     Rear Armour value is -3

Therefore to fire at the front will make it harder to destroy a tank
than to fire at the rear. Also the closer you are the more fire-power
you have.


Fire mode is indicated by either a:-

RED square with the sides cut out. Denotes no line of sight and you
cannot fire at that place on the map.

BLACK circle with cross-hairs You can click the right mouse button to
switch between fire mode and scroll map mode to search for enemy units.


You can decide to move and not fire or stop and fire. To stop and fire
click the left mouse button to bring up the move icon. Move the icon
over the middle of your unit and press the left mouse button. Your unit
will now be in stop fire mode. This gives you greater fire- power. If in
stop fire mode you do not wish to fire, move the BLACK cross-hairs icon
over the middle of your unit (It Will Turn GREEN, GREEN Are Your Units)
and press the left mouse button. Your unit will now be in stop mode. the
reason for this is to not give your position away as the enemy can
detect the gun flash.


When in fire mode you can fire at whatever you like even if you cannot
see any enemy units So if you think the enemy are hiding in cover move
the black cross-hairs over the area you want to shoot at and press the
left mouse button. If any enemy units are hiding there you may destroy
them. Note:- The fire-power and defensive value numbers will not be
displayed.

When you have finished moving infantry units if they have cover they
will have a higher defensive value and turn BLUE or  GREEN with circular
ring around your Unit. Infantry units have bazookas and will use them
when necessary. To use a bazooka against tanks you must get close and
shoot at the side or rear of the tank.

When moving tanks a YELLOW or WHITE  (white Forward) ( yellow reverse)
direction pointer means the front of the tank is pointing in that
direction. The direction pointer turns yellow when the tank reverses.
Reversing uses more fuel as does moving through different types of
terrain. You are allocated a certain amount of fuel per move. Light
tanks are allocated more fuel than heavy tanks. Heavy tanks look
slightly bigger on the screen. Infantry and tank move points are
indicated by a BLUE BLACK icon on the top left of the screen. The RED
line will decrease as fuel is used. You will not see a fuel indicator
for enemy units.

Remember icons on the top right of the screen are enemy icons and
friendly icons are on the top left. (Exception Very Top Left of Map May
Show Enemy YELLOW Unit ICON so you can see how many units he has
Destroyed).

The spyglass icon indicates observation mode...Wait

When a unit has finished its move it must miss a move. This is indicated
by the YELLOW move pointer turning RED when over the unit.

Light Tanks when you pick to move have a BLUE circle, Red circle for all
other units

The GREEN horizontal line at the top left of the screen is morale status
of the unit you are using. Low morale will cause many factors to come
into play. Morale also applies to enemy units but enemy morale status
will not be displayed on screen.

Anti-tank guns are deadly at close to medium range but are easy to
destroy. Anti-tank guns are represented by cannon icons.

If the YELLOW defensive values do not appear in the BLACK oblong box in
the bottom right of the screen then that enemy you are firing at will be
destroyed.

When RED EMPTY appears in the fuel points icon at the top left of the
screen this signifies allocated fuel movement points have expired for
that unit and must miss one move.

To win in Dead Metal you have to capture the REACTOR ICON on the Battle
field by moving one of your units onto it.

Tip. Do not destroy enemy tanks on a bridge as your tanks will not be
able to cross it and you will have to wait until it stops burning before
your infantry units can cross.

Try drag the enemy away from the REACTOR icon and flank him.

You need 2 or more UNITS to win DEAD METAL.

You can only see enemy units that are in your line of sight so enemy
units will disappear and then reappear when you can see them.
