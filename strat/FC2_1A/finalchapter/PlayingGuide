1.1 Legal and Contact info
==========================

I have released this game into the Amiga community as a little 'thank you'
for all the enjoyment that you and this machine have brought me over the
years.

You may distribute it as you wish. All I ask is that the files contained
within this archive remain unmolested, intact and together, and that I
remain credited as the author.

This is a hobby for me, and I am not a professional game or graphic
designer (as will become blindingly obvious). As such I would greatly 
appreciate any bug reports, suggestions and help with improvement or 
expansion etc.

I can be contacted by e-mail at sabregolly@yahoo.co.uk


Have fun, and thanks for trying my game.

Scot Gordon, December 2003


1.2 History
===========

FC is a game I wrote many years ago (1993!) to be played by myself and 
mates. At the time, I had just got hold of Blitz Basic 2 - and was dying
to create something. I looked at the sorts of games we played when we
were gathered for an evening's drinking and gaming, and decided the most
fun was playing simple multiplayer strategy games like Laser Squad, Space
Crusade, Lords of Chaos and similar gems of the 8/16 bit era.

I tried to create something that could be played by up to six players, 
was simple to use and understand, yet deep enough to allow for interesting 
strategies to develop.  

Many years have passed since those days. We have all moved to different 
corners of the country, and its only me that still has, and uses, his 
Amiga. On visiting EAB I realise that there are others still out there 
still using these machines - so I have resurrected it. I continue 
fiddling with the code etc now for my own enjoyment, but would love to 
hear other peoples ideas as to making it better.


1.3 About the Game
==================

FC is an old fashioned turn-based strategy game for 1 to 6 players, set 
in a clichéd future of people in huge mechanical suits fighting skirmishes 
on distant planets.

You are placed in control of a team of eight combatants on a large map and 
are pitted against other human commanded teams, and/or a large group of 
computer controlled nasties. The game is played entirely using a mouse.

The objective is to gain the highest score, mainly by destroying all the 
other teams.



******************
2. Getting Started
******************


2.1 Game Selection
==================

On starting the game, you are presented with the 'Game Selection' screen. 
This is where you choose the type of game you want to play. You can select 
one of three scenarios (maps on which to play), the number of human 
controlled teams to battle it out (up to six), and if you would like the 
added distraction of the computer controlled beasties out to get you too. 
*Note: For single player games, the computer controlled team is 
automatically switched on.

Click the various blue buttons to make your selections, and then press 
'OK' when you are ready.


2.2 Team Selection
==================

You can then select which team(s) you would like to play as from the 
twelve available. Click on each team you wish to have representing a human 
player (clicking again deselects them). Once you have chosen enough the 
'OK' button appears again, and you can start the game.

*Note: The teams only differ cosmetically i.e. their names and the team 
colours. There is no strategic advantage in choosing one team over another.
The play order is decided randomly at the start of each game, so you 
cannot force a certain team to play first.


2.3 About the teams
===================

Each team consists of eight combatants. The strongest member of the team 
is the captain (cpt.), followed by two sergeants (sgt.) and then the five 
privates (pvt.), who are considerably weaker by comparison. Losing your 
captain can be a disaster, whereas privates are reasonably expendable. 
There are many differences between the ranks, which will be explained more 
fully below.

2.4 About weapons and objects
=============================

Each member of your team has a number of 'slots' in which they carry 
weapons/items, depending on their rank.

|    Rank    |   Number of Slots   |
====================================
|  Captain   |          4          |
|  Sergeant  |          3          |
|  Private   |          2          |
====================================
 
So a private has two slots, so can carry two weapons/items, a sergeant 
three etc. 

Some weapons, however, take up two slots. These are called heavy weapons. 
A private can carry two normal weapons, or one heavy weapon.

There are essentially three different types of items available...

Close combat weapons (e.g. laser mace) used for up close and personal 
battles. These weapons considerably increase the damage you can inflict 
in this way.

Ranged weapons (e.g. auto cannon), the meat of your arsenal, used for 
long range attacks. Each type of weapon can be fired a certain number of 
times each round, do varying amounts of damage, and fire over different 
amounts of range and accuracy. How you use each weapon most effectively is 
up to you.

Support items (e.g. mines) are other items that you can use in battle, 
from tactical weapons such as mines and explosives, to supply items such 
as extra ammo and medikits to restore hit points.


2.5 Equipping your team
=======================

Once the game has loaded, the team chosen randomly to play first gets to 
arm their team. The eight members of your team are shown at the top, with 
the selected combatant highlighted and their name underneath. That 
combatant's inventory (items they are carrying) is shown on the right part 
of the screen. 

Below this is a description of the currently selected weapon. You can 
cycle through all the available weapons/items for that scenario by 
clicking the 'previous' and 'next' buttons. Only a limited number of each 
item is available, shown next to the picture of the item. You can give the 
item showing to your selected combatant by clicking on 'pick up', or 
clicking on the picture of that item. 

This item will now be showing on the inventory on the right for your 
selected combatant. Also shown here is the number of available slots 
the s/he has. You will not be able to equip an item unless you have enough 
available slots - remember 'heavy weapons' need two slots.

Clicking on any item in a combatants inventory will remove that item and 
return it to the available list, so it can be left or given to another 
member of your team.

If it is your first time playing, or you can't be bothered, you may wish 
to click on the 'auto-arm' button. This will automatically arm your team 
with a balanced selection of armaments and support items. You can, if you 
desire, change items around, after choosing this option.

*Note1: Auto-arm is only available if none of the team members are 
carrying anything. Return any items (by clicking on them in the inventory) 
if you wish to use this option.

*Note2: Auto-arm always equips the same items to the same corresponding 
members in each team, so if everyone chooses this, and doesn't alter the 
selection afterwards, all the teams will have exactly the same weaponry.

When you are ready, you can click the 'End turn' button, to finish arming. 
It is worth clicking through all of your team to make sure they are all 
fully equipped before clicking this, and allowing the next player their 
turn. Once you have finished arming, you can't go back, and items you have 
left behind are not available to you in the game.


***************
3. Doing battle
***************


3.1 The team screen
===================

A window on the map is shown of the left. You can move the map around by 
moving the mouse pointer to the corresponding edge of the screen. Shown on 
the right are each of the members of your team, with the objects they are 
carrying and the number of moves they have left. You can choose a 
combatant from here, or by clicking on them on the main map.

Clicking on an opponent or object on the map will give you information 
about that combatant or object. 

Other options available here, below the team list, are 'scan' which shows 
you an overall map, with the position of combatants shown in their team 
colours (computer controlled enemies are shown in dark grey), 'info' 
which displays your score, and 'end turn' which finishes your go.


3.2 Combatant options.
======================

After choosing a combatant to use, you will be shown their options on the 
right of the screen. At the top is a picture of the combatant. Clicking 
on this will give an information screen about them, such as their hit 
points and the weapons/items they are carrying (click on an item for 
the weapon spec screen)

The main part contains buttons for each available option for that 
combatant. Which options are available depends on the combatant's 
situation and inventory. 

Many options become unavailable once your combatant has either used 'fire' 
or 'fight' in a turn. Options like this have buttons which are coloured 
light blue.



3.3 'Move'
==========

Moves the combatant. This option is only available if you have at least 
one move left. The number of moves your combatant has left is displayed 
on the button.

Each combatant is assigned a certain number of moves that they can use in 
each turn (diagonally counts as one move). Your combatant does not have to 
use all their moves in one go.

On clicking 'move', the map screen will show all the available squares 
that your combatant can reach, given their current position, and how many 
moves it takes to get there. To move him/her, just click on the square you 
wish them to get to. Click 'go back' to cancel.

Combatants can move through doors, but not each other. You may find your
 combatant can move further if you move others out of the way first.


3.4 'Fire' (ranged weaponry)
============================

Fires a weapon, or lays mines or explosives (see below). This option is
 only available if... 

(a) your combatant has a gun(!) 
(b) your combatant hasn't used up all the shots allowed each turn for that
gun. 
(c) your combatant hasn't attacked an opponent in a close combat 'fight' 
this turn.

If your combatant has more than one gun, you will be asked to choose which 
you would like to fire. Once your combatant has fired that weapon, you 
can't choose a different one for them this turn. Click 'go back' to cancel.

Various information, such as the ammo left, and the shots left will be 
shown on the right. An alarm will sound to remind you that you are 
firing. Clicking on the map now will cause your combatant to fire at the 
location you clicked on! 

Each weapon has a maximum range, and its accuracy depends on the distance 
to the target. On the weapon spec screen, you may have noticed a chart in 
red/orange/yellow. This chart shows you the accuracy of that weapon at 
different ranges. The red is close range, orange medium range, and yellow 
long range. The chart shows how many squares away each range is. When 
firing, these accuracies are displayed again at the bottom of the screen, 
and any opponents in range, and within line of sight, will have a target 
shown on them in the corresponding colour. All accuracies are shown as a 
percentage hit rate. This can be increased if your combatant is also 
carrying a targetter.

You do not have to select an enemy to shoot at, any square will do 
(especially if you are using a weapon with explosive damage, or you are 
firing at explosives). If your combatant can see the square, and it's 
within range, the shot will then fire. If the shot hit the target (or 
anything else for that matter) you will see the damage you inflicted. 
The average damage caused by each weapon is shown in the weapon spec 
screen.

If your combatant's weapon can be fired again this turn, the number of 
shots left will be displayed on the fire button on the main screen.


3.5 'Fire' (mines and explosives)
=================================

If you select these as weapons to fire, a button will appear marked 'set'. 
This will lay the mine or explosive at the square your combatant is 
standing on. That square must be clear for you to set mines or explosives 
(i.e. no other objects). Mines are detonated by combatants standing on 
them (including your own). Explosives are detonated by shooting them with 
any weapon.

Your combatant may set a limited number of mines or explosives each turn, 
and your combatant cannot fire any other weapon once you have chosen to 
set mines or explosives.


3.6 'Fight'
===========

Allows you to attack an opponent in close combat. This option is only 
available if...

(a)  Your combatant hasn't 'fired' this turn.
(b)  There is an opponent standing in an adjacent square.

Clicking this button will initiate an attack on an opponent standing on 
any square adjacent to your combatant. If there is more than one opponent, 
you will be asked to choose which to attack.

Your combatant does need a close combat weapon to 'fight', but they are 
pretty weak without one. However, with a powerful weapon, these attacks 
can be devastating.

Sometimes the combatant being attacked can return a blow. Be sure to 
attack weak, unarmed opponents to minimise any risk!

Your combatant is allowed to 'fight' three times in each turn, and each 
attack can be on different opponents. If you choose to 'fight' in a turn, 
then your combatant will not be allowed to fire. You must choose one or 
the other.


3.7 'Drop'
==========

Drops an item/weapon being carried. Only available if...

(a)  your combatant has items/weapons in their inventory.
(b)  the ground you are standing on is clear (no other items).
(c)  your combatant has not yet used 'fire' or 'fight' in this turn.

On choosing this option, you will be asked to choose which item from your 
combatant's inventory you wish to discard. They can drop as many items as 
you like in each turn, but only one object is allowed on each square. 
If you wish to drop more of your items, keep moving your combatant to 
empty spaces for each one.


3.8 'Pick Up'
=============

Takes an item which is lying on the ground. Only available if...

(a)  there is an item/weapon on the square your combatant is occupying,
(b)  your combatant has enough slots to accommodate that item/weapon, 
(c)  your combatant has not yet to used 'fire' or 'fight' in this turn.

Items will often become available in the game. Sometimes crates contain 
items, and any combatants that are killed will drop all of their weapons 
in the surrounding area. Since only one item is permitted on each square, 
it is easy to see exactly what is lying where. If you click on an item on 
the map display, you will be shown the weapon spec screen for that weapon.

If your combatant is standing on an item that can be taken, it will say 
'found:' and a small picture of the item, just below the combatants name 
on the right side of the screen. Clicking here will again show the weapon 
spec screen for that item.

The weapon spec screen tells you everything about that type of weapon, 
except how much ammo this particular one has left. There is no way to know 
this, unless one of your combatants picks the weapon up. Check their info 
screen by clicking their picture to see the amount of ammo in all that 
combatants weapons.

Your combatant can't drop and pick up at the same time, so if you wish to 
swap their weapon for another that is lying around, be sure to drop the 
old weapon first, on an empty space, before moving to the new weapon to 
pick it up.

Your combatants may 'pick up' and 'drop' as many times as you like in your 
turn, but not once they have used 'fire' or 'fight'.

3.9 'Reload'
============

Allows you to restore the ammo of any weapon (except grenades, mines and 
explosives) to its maximum value. Only available if...

(a)  your combatant is carrying, or is standing on, an 'extra ammo' item.
(b)  your combatant has a gun that can be reloaded.
(c)  your combatant has not yet used 'fire' or 'fight' in this turn.

Once you have used an 'extra ammo' item in this way, it is gone, and 
cannot be used again.


3.10 'Heal'
==========

Allows you to restore the hit points of your combatant by ten points, or 
up to its maximum value. Only available if...

(a)  your combatant is carrying, or is standing on, a 'medikit' item.
(b)  your combatant has not yet used 'fire' or 'fight' in this turn.

Once you have used a 'medikit' item in this way, it is gone, and cannot 
be used again.


3.11 'Send'
===========

Certain items can be found, and returned to your starting point to 
increase your score. Only available if...

(a)  your combatant is carrying a scoring item,
(b)  your combatant is standing on your team's starting point,
(c)  your combatant has not yet used 'fire' or 'fight' in this turn.

Your starting point is a glowing box, in your team colours, around which 
your team were arranged at the beginning of the game. Information about 
the scoring value of any item you have found can be gained by looking at 
the weapon spec screen for that item. 


3.12 'Get Flag'
===============

If you reach an opponents starting point, you can collect a flag which 
will increase your score. Only available if...

(a)  your combatant is standing on an opponents starting point,
(b)  your combatant has not yet used 'fire' or 'fight' in this turn.


3.13 'Op Door'
==============

Short for 'operate door'. This allows your combatant to open or close 
doors. Only available if...

(a)  your combatant are standing adjacent to a door.
(b)  the door is not blocked by another combatant or an object.

If there is more than one door adjacent to your combatant, you will be 
asked which one you wish to open or close. There is no limit to the 
number of times your combatant may to open or close doors in a turn.


3.14 'Search'
=============

Allows you to smash open a crate to check its contents. Only available if 
your combatant is standing adjacent to a crate.

On each map there is a number of crates scattered around. Some may contain 
items, including some seriously powerful weapons, some may be empty, and 
others may be booby trapped and explode when opened. Whereas the type of 
items available in crates is set for each scenario, their location changes,
so the next time you play the chances are that wonderful weapon you found 
before is now in a different crate!

Your combatant may open as many crates as you wish in a turn.


3.15 'Go Back'
==============

Return to the team screen. You may return to this combatant at any point 
later in your turn and continue where you left off.



*************************************
4. General Hints, Tips and Strategies
*************************************


4.1 Differences between the ranks
=================================

As mentioned previously, your eight combatants consist of one captain, 
two sergeants and five privates. The table below shows the main 
differences between the ranks...

| Rank     | No of Moves | Hit Points | Close Combat | No of Slots |
====================================================================
| Captain  |      8      |     20     |      5       |      4      |
| Sergeant |      6      |     15     |      4       |      3      |
| Private  |      5      |     10     |      3       |      2      |
====================================================================

Your captain has twice the hit points (can sustain twice the damage) as 
your privates, can move much further each turn, and can carry twice the 
equipment. Your two sergeants' stats are somewhere in-between. 

The differences in close combat rating (how good they are in a fight) in 
practice do not mean much (it is the maximum damage that the combatant 
can inflict in a 'fight'), as close combat weapons greatly increase this 
value.
 

4.2 Scoring
===========

Each team has a score. At the end of the game, the team with the greatest 
score is considered the winner. This does not have to be the last team 
with any survivors. Points can be gained in a number of ways...


(a) Killing Opponents
The main way to score! For human commanded teams, each combatant has a 
score value (available on the info screen) depending on their rank.
 
   Captains: 10pts.    Sergeants: 5pts.    Privates: 3pts.

Computer controlled combatants such as aliens and droids also have score 
values. The computer team, however, does not have an overall score.

If an opponent dies on your turn, no matter what the cause, your team 
gets the points! 

Suicides, or deaths from friendly fire, do not gain points for anyone. 
Some unscrupulous players have been known to kill their own captain if 
their hit points are low, rather than allow opponents the chance of 
gaining the points. Obviously this sort of behaviour must not be tolerated
and steps should be taken to make the player realise the error of their 
ways (e.g. physical violence). 


(b) Survivor Bonus - Being the last team alive

If you are the last team to survive, the score value of all your surviving
 combatants is added to your final score. This is called the 'survivor 
bonus'. This of course does not guarantee a winning score, especially if 
you are the last team by virtue of spending the whole game hiding far away 
from the action. 

As the computer team, if activated, does not have a score, they do not 
gain a survivor bonus.


(c) Returning valuable items

If you find an item which has a scoring value, e.g. an 'artefact', and you 
return this item to your start point you gain the stated number of points 
for your team. Whether or not this is worth your while will depend on the 
circumstances at the time.

If you should be the last surviving team, and one of your combatants has 
an item of value in their inventory, then that score is added at the end, 
as if they had returned it during the game.


(d) Collecting flags

This is of interest especially in a game with lots of players. If one of 
your combatants gets to an opponents starting point and selects 'get flag' 
then your team gains 10 points. It is up to you whether you think this is 
a worthwhile endeavour, or if it is a good idea to protect your starting 
point. 

Each starting point can be visited by all the other teams, and they can 
all get the points.

Computer teams do not have starting points. Consequently, you cannot gain 
points in this way while playing a single player game.


4.3 Explosions
==============

Some weapons, eg rocket launchers, and other items, eg. mines, cause 
explosions. Damage from explosions can be inflicted over a wide area. The 
greatest damage would be inflicted at the centre of the explosion, less 
as you move away. This is an excellent method for hitting an opponent 
hiding behind a corner out of sight, or for decimating a group of 
opponents gathered in one place.

There are other ways to cause explosions, as well as with weapons. Oil and 
oxygen tanks litter the maps, explosives can be left by combatants, and 
mines explode if stepped on. 

If an explosion occurs, and there are any other explosive items within the 
range of that explosion, then they will explode as well, causing a chain 
reaction. Any combatant caught up in such a chain reaction can kiss their 
life goodbye. Even standard weapons can start explosions if they hit an 
explosive item directly. 

Mines, however, are protected from exploding in this way. The only way to 
clear a mine is to stand on it, and accept the consequences. It is 
advisable to proceed in little steps when navigating a minefield, as the 
computer may choose a different path from the one you envisaged when 
moving a large number of steps.

You may find it wise to clear a room of explosives before entering it with 
valuable forces, if it is possible for the explosives to be set off, 
either accidentally, or by hostile fire.

It is possible for an entire team to be wiped out in one go by sending in 
a lemming to plant explosives around a group of opponents, and then get 
someone else from afar to shoot the explosives. You can really upset 
people by doing things like this.


4.4 Targetters and Shields
==========================

These two items are probably the most useful equipment available in the 
game. How these are used can seriously enhance your chances.

(a)   Weapon targetters

Targetters increase the accuracy of your weapons by 25%. It is possible, 
depending on the range and accuracy of the weapon you are using, to 
increase the accuracy above 100%, meaning you are guaranteed a successful 
hit. 

Pay close attention to the range chart on the weapon spec screen. This 
tells you the distance from your combatant that each accuracy refers to. 
Since targetters take up one slot, and heavy weapons take up two, only 
sergeants and captains can equip a targetter with a heavy weapon. Equip 
the targetter with your most powerful weapon for best results!

(b)   Deflector Shields

Shields have two functions. Firstly, they reduce the chance of a direct 
hit by half. This means that if an opponent targets you directly, it is 
much more likely that the shot will miss. Secondly, they absorb some of 
the damage taken by your combatant from any source, even explosions and 
fights. The amount absorbed is random, so you can't depend upon your 
shield to protect your combatant if their hit points are low, but they 
will have a better chance. Obviously more valuable members of your team 
should be first in line to get the shield, e.g. the captain or your 
sergeants.

If you are attacking an opponent with a shield, try to use explosive 
weaponry, and do not aim directly at the enemy. The shield is designed to 
deflect shots coming directly at the owner, so if you target an adjacent 
square, you are more likely to be successful in doing at least some 
damage, when they are caught in the blast.

If you kill an opponent who had either of these items equipped, get in 
there and grab it quick!


4.5 Need re-supplied?
=====================

Invariably, the combatant needing extra ammo or a medikit is never 
carrying the items. Since these items take up valuable slots, you will 
probably not take any at the beginning and then need plenty later in the 
game. It is always a good idea to equip at least one of each somewhere in 
your team so that they can be used in emergencies. These items can also 
sometimes be found in crates.

Both these re-supply items can be used if the combatant in need stands 
over them. Use the one carrying the item to take it as close to the 
recipient as possible, drop it, and move away. Then the combatant needing 
the re-supply can just stand on the square where it lies and use it. Note 
that you cannot 'Reload' or 'Heal' if the combatant has fired or fought 
that turn, so bear that in mind when considering your options.


4.6 Doors
=========

These can play an interesting part of your strategies. After attacking, 
it is a reasonable option to hide members of your team behind closed 
doors, to minimise the chances of a successful counter strike.

Closed doors can obviously be opened by a combatant next to them, but 
this is not always an option. It is useful to note that doors can also be 
opened by shooting them directly, or by nearby explosions. This only 
causes the doors to open - they are not damaged permanently and therefore 
can be closed again. 

You can prevent doors being closed by blocking them with a dropped item, 
mine or explosive. These of course can all be removed, but not without 
considerable inconvenience to the team wishing to clear the way.


4.7 Playing against the computer
================================

Computer controlled teams are different from the teams that are played by 
human commanders. For a start there are up to fifteen computer combatants, 
and at the beginning of a game they are placed all over the map.

If you play a single game against the computer, you will be outnumbered 
and outgunned by the computer team. Defeating the computer can be quite a 
challenge. The computer's strategy is one of relentless attack, but you 
can use this to your advantage.

Computer teams do not consist of the same combatants as played by humans. 
Some computer teams consist of droids, others aliens. Each type of 
computer controlled enemy will have come in different ranks, or in 
different versions, and the score value will vary accordingly. They have 
different stats and different sets of strengths and weaknesses to human 
commanded combatants. Again, you should look at the info screen to check 
the strengths of these combatants.

Some computer combatants, e.g. most droids, do not use items in the same 
way as normal teams. They are armed with a built in weapon, which is 
destroyed if the droid is killed. 

Some others types carry the same sort of weapons as player commanded 
teams. These computer combatants will use items such as extra ammo and 
medikits that they have or are lying around, and their weapons will be 
dropped, and available for you to use, should you kill one of these 
combatants. Beware, however, that computer combatants will drop their 
weapon, and pick up another, if, for instance, it is better than the one 
they have, or if it has ran out of ammo.


4.8 General play tips
=====================

It is important to remember that apart from certain options becoming 
unavailable after firing or fighting, there are no restrictions on what 
each combatant can do and when. 

In one turn, for instance, a combatant can move up to crate, open it to 
find a weapon, drop their current weapon, move to where the crate was to 
pick up the new weapon, move a few steps towards an enemy, fire at them, 
then move back behind a door and close it. The only limits are the number 
of moves the combatant has, and the number of times they can fire 
(depending on their selected weapon) or fight (three times) in each turn.

You do not need to finish moving each combatant in turn, you can skip 
between any of them at any stage. On the team screen (with the combatants 
listed on the right) the number of moves left for each combatant are shown 
- so it is easy to see who can still move. You may wish to swap to a 
different combatant to move them out the way, for example, then move back.
