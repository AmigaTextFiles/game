;Note that I put a space at the end of the first print, (an )
;instead  of at the start of the underlined word
;so that the space before "underlined" does not get underlined.


;example of hiliting a word:

 SetAPen grey220

 setapen grey240

  print  a word.

;example of using colors:

 SetAPen grey220
  print You can have:
  print
 setapen green200
  print any text in shades between 1 to 255
 setapen yellow200
  print yellow.
 setapen magenta200
  print magenta. (purple)
 setapen red200
  print red.
 setapen cyan200
  print cyan.
 setapen blue200
  print blue.

;note that even though James have included tutorial words
;for absolutely all shades from 1 to 255
;I would reccomend using tens (10) in the shade number (ie 210 or 240)
;because the TC palette is not really capable of supporting
;much more than 25 shades of each color anyway.
