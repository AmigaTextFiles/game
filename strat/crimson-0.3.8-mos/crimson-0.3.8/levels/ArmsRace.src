(#12/18-12-2002)
by Jens Granseuer <jensgr@gmx.net>

Second installment of the Nexus campaign.

Access Code: CIRCUIT
%
After their arrival on Nexus, the Kandelians have often chosen not to take over the existing bases with the rather outdated Nexian equipment and instead built their own. As a result, many of the small supply bases scattered all over the planet have been unused for the last two years.

The Kandelians may have superior weapon systems, but a single gun may decide the battle. Therefore we have decided to reactivate those bases, if possible without the Federation knowing about it. However, our plans have somehow leaked to the Emperor, and they have already begun to occupy or destroy installations they have no use for.

We must act quickly to get as many of the remaining bases into our hands as possible. In the Shalassian Mountains we have located two of those depots which the enemy may not have detected, yet. Find out if there is any useful equipment left and end the Kandelian presence in this sector.

Good luck!
%
All over Nexus there are small supply bases from the time before our landing. We have ignored most of them because they were equipped with inferior Nexian weapons. A few days ago we got word that the FNA are trying to reactivate those depots. Even though the outdated tanks they used cannot compete with our technology, they will be a real nuisance and probably make the rebellion last a few weeks longer.

For that reason we have already begun to take over any installations we know of, or at least render them unusable.

You will take care of two more of those depots in the Shalassian Mountains. You may take any steps you deem appropriate, but these buildings must not fall into rebel hands.

Long live the Emperor!
