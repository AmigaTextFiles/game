Operation: Foxhole
(#4/21-04-2003)
by Jens Granseuer <jensgr@gmx.net>

Third installment of the Nexus campaign.

Access Code: CAPITAL
%
The cause of the Free Nexus Army is winning more supporters each day. The Kandelian Empire has lately suffered defeats in a few battles. Most of those have only been minor skirmishes, but they had a very important psychological aspect to them: Many local leaders now believe that the Empire's powers are waning and the time has come to shake off the yoke of their rule.

The city of Valdan recently decided to join the FNA. Valdan is a regional capital located close to the mouth of the river Sarph into the Northern Sea, and has so far been an important coastal guard tower to the Empire. To join our forces, the leaders of Valdan and representatives for the FNA arranged a secret meeting in the nearby town of Rhin's Head. However, it seems like details about the conference have leaked to the Empire as they have gathered their forces in the vicinity. In response we have dispatched a small force to rendezvous with the Valdans and safely escort them to Rhin's Head.

Your job is to make sure that the armoured carrier with the Valdan leaders reaches Rhin's Head in one piece. Should you fail, Valdan will likely remain in the Emperor's hands for a long time to come.

Intelligence reports indicate that many of the Emperor's subjects sympathize with the rebellion of the Free Nexus Army and their goal, to shatter the Empire of Kand and bring chaos to our peaceful lands. It seems like our recent efforts to solve the problem with more diplomatical means has only encouraged them to openly support the FNA.

We now received note that Valdan, a regional capital on the northern coast and a key location in our defence plan, is about to join forces with the FNA. We must make absolutely clear that we won't tolerate such a behaviour and that our preference of diplomatical means is in no way a sign of military weakness. We will not stand by and watch the FNA tear down everything we have built with our own sweat and blood.

Our sources say that the Valdans are to meet the leaders of the FNA in the small town of Rhin's Head. This is where you come in. Make sure that this meeting never takes place. The Valdan emissaries have boarded an armoured personnel carrier and are on their way to Rhin's Head. Make it a most unpleasent ride. Don't let the carrier reach Rhin's Head!

We are still relaying forces to the area, so expect some reinforcements in a few days.

Long live the Emperor!
