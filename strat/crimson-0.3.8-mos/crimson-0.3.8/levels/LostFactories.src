The Lost Factories
(#1/2003-01-22)
by Laurent Le Guillou <leguillou.laurent@free.fr>

Battle for two strategic factories.
%
A spy of the Free Nexus Army has just reported the existence of two old factories, on the small Palish Islands in the north of the former city Illidia (now called Kandos by the invaders). These old factories, neglected for 80 years, are in good condition and represent an important potential for the Free Nexus Army. They may be used to produce a large variety of ground, naval, and airborne units, but have no resources available. If enough crystals can be stolen from the enemy, the Palish Islands will become a strategic site for Nexus, and perhaps the key to victory.

The information transmitted by our spy, just before his capture by Kandelian secret service, seems to indicate that a great amount of crystals is stored in the Zakandska depot, north of Illidia, and that this depot is not well guarded.

Your commando will be landed near the small airport of Rhokaswi. Taking advantage of the air forces at Rhokaswi, your mission is to take the crystals in the depot of Zakandska, to transfer them to the old factories on the Palish Islands, and to build a great army to defeat the invaders and free the city of Illidia.

As our spy was captured, the Kandelian armies are most certainly aware of our projects... Good luck!

The area of the city of Kandos (which was formerly called Illidia by the natives) is well controlled by the Imperial Army of Kand. We took Illidia during the first month of our campaign on Nexus, and established a few bases around the city.

Our intelligence agency has recently captured a spy (this infamous rebel has since been tried and executed) who has acknowledged that the Nexus Free Army, as the rebels call themselves, has started a project to establish a new base on the Palish Islands, north-west of Kandos.

As the chief general of the Imperial Forces in the Kandos area, you should keep control of the city of Kandos, and destroy all rebel forces in the area.

During the last campaign on Nexus a large amount of crystals was discovered near the north pole of the planet. 1000 crystals have been secretly transferred to the small depot of Zakandska, and you must guard them well. Crystals are essential for the Empire...

Long live the Emperor!
