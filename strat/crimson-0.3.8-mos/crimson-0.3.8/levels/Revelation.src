In the eastern part of the continent Llan lies an area called the Kingdoms of the East. They are reigned by the kings of Kyo, Rho-Tan and Lingay. Since the beginning of the invasion, the Kingdoms have been largely ignored by the Empire of Kand. We believed the reason for this was that they are a only a regional and comparatively small power, so that the Kandelians decided to deal with them at a later time. The Kings themselves have also kept a very low profile, to the effect that their realms have so far gone unharmed by the war.

Unfortunately, our initial assessment of the situation was incorrect. The Empire did not yet go after the Kings because they are cooperating!  Last week a reconnaissance squad was attacked by the Kings' Men just west of Kyo. The Kings are now considered a major threat to our operations in the region, and we have decided to deal with them accordingly. Despite the small size of the Kingdoms, they maintain a sizable force that makes a direct assault impossible.

We sent out a small force to stage an attack on Kyo from the north. The Kings reacted just as we were hoping they would, and diverted a major part of their forces northwards. Now we are sending our strike force in from the south. Even though their defense has been severely weakened they still have the advantage of superior numbers, but this is the best chance we will get.

Your mission is to either destroy the Kings' Men around Lingay, or to take the city itself. You must not hesitate as we do not know how long we can bind the forces in the north. Also keep in mind that the small outposts around Lingay are pretty unimportant as long as you can conquer the capital itself.

Good luck. For a free Nexus!
%
The time has finally come. The Kingdoms of the East are calling to the weapons.

Gouverned by the wise Kings of Kyo, Rho-Tan and Lingay, we have long gathered our forces, for it was foretold there would come a time of dire need. When the fighting started between the Free Nexus Army and the invaders from Kand, the Kingdoms had no part in it, both to protect our people and to be able to strike when the Kandelians would be getting weak and tired.

Now the time of the prophecy has come. Last week, Kandelian forces appeared west of Kyo but were easily driven away. A few days later, more troops attacked Kyo from the north. We sent twelve sons of the Kings' Men to Kyo to repel the assault. They did not meet much resistance, and it is clear now that the attack on Kyo was only a means to lure our forces to Kyo, because a much bigger army has been secretly assembling in the south and is now marching on Lingay. However, even though our defenses are weakened, we can still muster roughly twice the men they have.

Defend the city well. Hail to the Kings!

Well done! One third of the Kingdoms of the East is now basically under our control. You have drastically reduced the threat to our operations.

Mission accomplished.
%
Your assault on Lingay has failed. The fierce defense has repelled the attacking army under your command, and the Kings' banners still fly over Lingay.

Mission failed.
%
On reflection, it seems very odd that the Empire would attack the Kingdoms with such a small force. They must be very desperate or even more stupid. You cannot expect them to make the same mistake twice, though, so you will spend the next weeks preparing the defense lines for when the Kandelians return for real.

You are victorious.
%
It looks like Lingay is lost. The defense has crumbled, and the people are fleeing north, hoping to reach Kyo or Rho-Tan. There, the Kingdoms will assemble another army to take the city back. You have been defeated.
%
The enemy has captured Lingay. The King and his remaining followers will join with the Kingdoms' forces in the north and try to reclaim the city as soon as possible. You have been defeated.
