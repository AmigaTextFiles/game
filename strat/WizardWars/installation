To install this version of wizard wars on your Amiga you'll need a couple
of files from your workbench disc.

    The program requires 2 fonts, garnet-9, and sapphire-14. Also the
diskfont.library must be present. These files must be in the fonts: and
libs: directories respectively.
    Secondly, to call the program from workbench by clicking on the icon,
you'll need iconx in your c: directory.

    All the files I've enclosed here must be in the same directory, ie
wizwar, Wizard Wars, and Wizard Wars.info.

    If you want to make a bootable disc of this (though register and I'll
send you one) use workbench or a CLI to format and install a disc, makedir
the fonts, libs, c, and s directories and copy the fonts, library and iconx
files across. Copy the 3 wizard wars files to the disc, type the following
3 lines:
    cd df0:      ((where df0: contains your intended boot disc))
    copy * to s/startup-sequence
    wizwar
press ctrl-\ and you'll be able to boot with it.





{    PD libraries should alter the Wizard Wars script to assign fonts:
libs: and c: to places that contain the necessary fonts, library and iconx
files if they want people to simply click on the icon to run it (or rely
upon them having the necessary files on their workbench disc). - Andy}
