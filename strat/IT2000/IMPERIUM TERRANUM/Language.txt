the history of
all civilisations ends.
Some of them have been able to build high-tech Space-
ships, but they didn`t ever really understand the
technologies, they used.
That is the only reason, why the explosion of one single
spaceship causes such a huge desaster. The whole
known space went into a anomal spacetime and nobody
was able to stop this disturbance.
So all these stars will be frozen for all times into
this anomal spacetime.

the
civilisation ends.
They weren`t able to survive the fight of life.

areas, all planets where occupied.

blood of millions of people.
Next generations will have to pay for that:
The occupied and suppressed civilizations will stand
up and fight for freedom and for their rights, they
will destroy these dark, bloody empire!
