Dependencies are at the very least:
libz
libpng
libbz2
libSDL
libSDL_mixer

Get Simutrans sourcecode here (unless you want a nightly build):
http://sourceforge.net/projects/simutrans/files/simutrans/

Copy the contents of this directory to where you extracted the source code.
I haven't tried compiling statically in a long time but doing that should make
it run on AmigaOS 4.0, too.
