Note for HARD DISK users :

If you wish to install SOLAR LORDS on your hard disk you will need to set up
an ASSIGN statement for it in your startup-sequence or user-startup

Simply enter the following :



ASSIGN LORDS: <Partiton> <Path>


For example if you wished to install it in your DH1 games directory you would
enter :


ASSIGN LORDS: DH1:Games/ 


To run simply click on the GO icon



Thanks a lot
