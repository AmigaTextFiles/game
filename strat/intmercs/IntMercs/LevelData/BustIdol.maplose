Memo from Boss:
Imbecile! With that failure goes all our hopes! Our first big job and you
blew it. Good-bye.

Earl:
The Boss is being damn hard on you. That was one tough mission - we should
have allocated at least twice as many men. Nice working with you.

Leecker:
Hard luck! That was all the men the Boss would let go - he messed up too!
