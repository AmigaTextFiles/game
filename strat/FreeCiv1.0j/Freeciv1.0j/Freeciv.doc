Introduction
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Talking to some of the daimi XPilot players during an XPilot tournament they
told me they had programmed a Civilization clone in C for unix and X11.  I'm
a big fan of strategy games, so I tried it out and thought it was very nice.
I began looking at the code and thought that it looked reasonably portable,
the platform independent code was nicely isolated from the X11 gui code.  So,
when my summer vacation started I sat down and began the port to Amiga and MUI.

This is the result. It isn't quite finished yet, but it should be quite 
playable. At least on gfxcards, it is still a bit slow on AGA. 

Consider this a prerelease and mail me your comments.  You probably won't get
an answer until August since I'm off for 5 weeks of vacation in two days. :)

Requirements
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 · Amiga with 68020 or better and AGA or better (gfxcard).
 · AmigaOS 3.0.
 · picture.datatype V43 (AGA users can use the Picasso96 datatype, get 
   gfx/board/Picasso96.lha and install the included datatype).
 · A gif datatype like zgif/akgif/gif.
 · MUI 3.8 or higher.
 · An AmiTCP compatible TCP/IP stack (like AmiTCP, Miami, TermiteTCP, mlink or
   As225/Inet225 with the bsdsocket.library emulation library).
 · ixemul.library V46 and the matching ixnet.library if you intend to run the 
   server on your machine. Both can be found on aminet and on 
   ftp.ninemoons.com.

Features
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 · Multiplayer strategy game exactly like Civilization with up to 14 players 
   at the same time.
 · Two different sets of tile graphics are included and it is also easy to
   make your own if you wish.  (Graphics are loaded with datatypes of course.)
 · The server is very portable and can be run on either Amiga or just about any
   Unix host.
 · Has all the features of a modern Amiga application like customizable gui,
   reduced memory usage due to dynamic object creation, commodity interface,
   simple arexx, iconification, etc etc thanks to MUI.  

Usage
¯¯¯¯¯
This is not going to be an explanation on how to play Civilization, if you
want docs, buy the original MicroProse game. ;)

To start the game, simply start the "civserver" program in a shell window of
your choice. Then invite all your net-friends to join your game by running the 
Freeciv with the arguments "server=your.host.name username=MyName".  The one
running the server does not need to specify server, the default is to connect
to localhost.  Everyone needs a unique username, otherwise they will be
rejected by the server.

When all your friends are connected, start the server by "s" and pressing
enter in the server shell window.  If all goes well, all clients will pop up
a window asking for Race and Name.  From there you'll have to take it
yourself. :)

The server saves the game every few rounds, and you can restart a saved game
by running the server with "civserver -f civgameXXXX.sav".

You can leave and rejoin the game at any time.  The important thing is to use
the same username as you picked inside the game.

If compiling things on a unix host doesn't scare the living daylights out of
you, it is recommended to download the original freeciv game v1.0j with
source and compile it at your login shell account at your ISP (provided you
have one :) and run the server there.  That will hopefully ensure better
bandwidth and less lag for everyone.

Have fun...

There are two sets of tiles provided with the game.  The default is the tiles
painted by the original freeciv team.  If you use the argument "tileset=civ2"
when starting the client you get a nicer, bigger and better looking set of
tiles (at the expense of quite a bit of memory).

The game should be 100% controllable from the keyboard, except for scrolling
the main window gamemap, and adjusting which tiles are used by the city (in
the city window).  Pressing leftmousebutton on a tile centers the view on
that tile.  Pressing shift+lmb or mmb on a tile open a small info window that
shows you the resources of the tile.  Other controls not shown in the menus
are the keys for moving your units.  Use either the cursor keys or the keys
on the numeric keypad.

For some tips on how to play see the builtin help available in the game.
