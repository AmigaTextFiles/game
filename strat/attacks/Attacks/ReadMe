     Hello, and welcome!  I have a new one here for the Amiga
community.  I call it Attacks (based on the arcade game, Ataxx).  Just
to make sure that you have everything, here's a complete listing of
all the files included with the program.

     As far as I can tell, this program doesn't require anything other
than a reasonable stack size to use (10000 should be fine).  Just run
it from the workbench or cli and enjoy!
