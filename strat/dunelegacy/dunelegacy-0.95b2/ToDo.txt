Bugs:
-----

Bug:	If you have a lot of units and send them out all together you can see some flickering.
Update: Should be solved now.

Bug:	AI tries to place buildings outside the map if base is near map edge (see Harkonnen Level 16 (SCENH016.INI)).
(Fix:)Until now this bug isn't really fixed but AI is prevented to build outside the map. It seems, that AI can handle this situation and tries somewhere else.

Ideas:
------

In Multiplayer games two gamers can control one house. The mousepointer of the other guy is shown in grey. Only one person can select a unit/building at a time.

A Tower-Defense mode. The computer sends units from one point on the map (source) to another point (sink, destination). The way between these to points is very complicated. The goal for the human players is to kill these units before they reach the sink. For every killed unit the player gets money. The player can only build towers.
