                Amiga Empire by Chris Gray - Factors


There are a number of numerical factors associated with many of the
operations in Amiga Empire. Many of them are adjustable by a deity. The
current values of all factors can be seen using the 'info' command. A
number of the factors consist of pairs, usually called 'xxxBase' and
'xxxRand'. These together determine a random value by adding a random value
between 0 and xxxRand to xxxBase. The various factors, grouped as they are
under 'info', are:

production
    Costs in production units of
    - research (medical breakthroughs), technology (technological advances)
    - guns, shells, planes, gold bars
mobilities
    Mobility costs of various actions/movements
    - mountMob - basic cost of moving onto a mountain
    - wildMob - basic cost of moving onto a wilderness
    - defMob - basic cost of moving onto a "normal" sector
    - civMob - cost of moving 5 civilians
    - milMob - cost of moving 5 military
    - shellMob - cost of moving 5 shells
    - gunMob - cost of moving 1 gun
    - planeMob - cost of moving 1 plane
    - oreMob - cost of moving 5 tons of iron ore
    - barMob - cost of moving 1 bar of gold
    - attack costs - costs of attacking from various types of sectors
        to various other types of sectors.
plague
    The various factors that influence plague.
    - plagueKiller - this value scales the number of people who will
        die when a sector is in the third plague stage. A larger value
        will result in LESS people dieing.
    - plagueBooster - this value adds to the probability of getting
        plague, by increasing the plague factor. It is added to the top
        line in the plague factor formula.
    - plagueOneBase, plagueOneRand - determine length of stage one
    - plagueTwoBase, plagueTwoRand - determine length of stage two
    - plagueThreeBase, plagueThreeRand - determine length of stage three
costs
    Various monetary costs.
    - efficCost - cost of each increase in sector efficiency
    - milSuppliesCost - affects the cost of military supplies. A larger
        value means LESS cost.
    - utilityRate - cost per ETU of utilities in a sector
    - interestRate - interest rate per bar per ETU in percent
    - bridgeCost - cost in dollars of a bridge span
    - shipCostMult - cost in dollars per production unit for ships
    - refurbCost - cost in dollars per level of technology added to ship
scales
    Various work scale factors. All of these are multiplicative factors
    with 100 being the neutral position. Increasing them will increase the
    production rate as appropriate.
    - resScale - production in reasearch institutes
    - techScale - in technology centers
    - defenseScale - defense planes
    - shellScale - shell industries
    - airportScale - airports
    - harborScale - harbors
    - bridgeScale - bridge heads
    - goldScale - gold mines
    - ironScale - iron mines
    - shipWorkScale - improvements in ships
updates
    Factors affecting sector updates.
    - secondsPerETU - seconds per Empire Time Unit. The normal value is
        1800 (half an hour). A good fast value is 20 seconds.
    - efficScale - scale efficiency increases - 100 is neutral
    - mobilScale - scale mobility increases - 100 is neutral
    - urbanGrowthFactor - larger value slows down civilian growth in
        urban centers
    - bridgeDieFactor - larger value slows down civilian deaths on a
        bridge span
    - highGrowthFactor - larger value slows down civilian growth in
        non-urban center sectors with 32 - 96 civilians
    - lowGrowthFactor - larger value slows down civilian growth in
        non-urban center sectors with < 32 or > 96 civilians
    - BTUDivisor - larger value will slow down the production of BTU's in
        country's capitals
    - resDecreaser - larger value will speed up the decrease in research
        level over time (due to obsolescence, etc.)
    - techDecreaser - larger value will speed up the decrease in country
        level over time.
    - hurricaneLandBase, hurricaneLandRand - yield the percent of damage
        done to land sectors by hurricanes
    - hurricaneSeaBase, hurricaneSeaRand - yield the percent of damage
        done to ships by hurricanes
fighting
    Various factors that affect fighting of various kinds.
    - assFortAdv - the defensive advantage of forts being assaulted
    - assCapAdv - the defensive advantage of capitals being assaulted
    - assBankAdv - the defensive advantage of banks being assaulted
    - attFortAdv - the defensive advantage of forts being attacked
    - attCapAdv - the defensive advantage of capitals being attacked
    - attBankAdv - the defensive advantage of banks being attacked
    - assAdv - the defensive advantage of any sector being assaulted.
        This one is a scale factor with 100 being neutral.
    - fortAdv - attack advantage of forts at 100% efficiency
    - boardAdv - the defensive advantage of defenders during a board
        attempt. A scale factor with 100 being neutral.
sea
    Various factors relevant to sea conflict.
    - torpCost - number of shells needed for one torpedo
    - torpMobCost - mobility lost when fire a torpedo - note that the
        first shot sets mobility to 0. If this is 0, then there is no
        cost at all.
    - torpRange - maximum range of torpedos
    - torpAcc0 - percent hit for torpedo at range 0
    - torpAcc1 - percent hit for torpedo at range 1 (orthogonal)
    - torpAcc2 - percent hit for torpedo at range 2 (diagonal)
    - torpAcc3 - percent hit for torpedo at greater ranges
    - torpBase, torpRand - determine torpedo damage (which will be
        scaled by the damage factor of the target ship)
    - chargeCost - cost in shells for one depth charge
    - chargeMobCost - mobility cost, similar to torpedos
    - chargeBase, chargeRand - depth charge damage (times sub factor)
    - mineBase, mineRand - damage done by a mine (times ship factor)
air
    Some factors affecting airplanes.
    - fuelTankSize - amount of fuel a plane can carry
    - fuelRichneess - multiplier for mobility -> plane fuel
    - flakFactor - larger value decreases hits by flak
    - landScale - scale chances of landing - 100 is neutral
    - bombBase, bombRand - damage done by a bomb
    - planeBase, planeRand - damage done by a crashing plane
miscellaneous
    A few miscellaneous factors.
    - contractScale - scale the value of contracts offered
    - deathFactor - cost in 100ths of a BTU per death of an attacker in
        an attack, assault or board
    - gunMax - maximum guns usable by a sector (normally 7)
    - rangeDivisor - larger values decrease gun range
    - gunScale - scale damage by guns (100 is neutral)
    - lookShipFact - smaller value means ships can be visually seen
        further away
    - collectScale - scales the value of a sector which someone is
        trying to sieze when collecting a loan - 100 is neutral.
    - radarFactor - larger values increase the range of land-based
        radar
    - spyFactor - smaller value makes it more likely that a spy will be
        detected
    - shipTechDecreaser - rate at which ship technology level decreases.
        (scale is 1/10 that of the country tech decreaser)
flags
    Some boolean flags affecting permissions.
    nonDeityPower - true if non-deitys are allowed to do 'power force'
    sortCountries - true => 'country' command produces a listing with no
        country numbers sorted by name. false => the list includes country
        numbers and is sorted by country number.
    Allow public messages - true if countries besides a Deity are allowed to
        send public messages.
    Allow changing countries - true if players are allowed to change
        countries without hanging up (via the change country command).
    Flush buffers on client termination - if true then EmpServ will flush the
        buffers, close all the files it has opened, and reopen them. This
        may take 10 to 15 secs, and should probobly only be used in a
        single user game, or one where you are paranoid about losing data
        and the users understand that it may take 10-15 secs to get a
        command prompt at times.
    Allow normal users to flush buffers - true if normal (non-deity) players
        are allowed to use the "flush" command. If you are running a multi-
        user game you will probobly want this set false, so users can't
        obnoxiously flush the buffers to slow down other players. But on a
        single user system prone to crashes, it can prevent you from having
        a corrupted database.
