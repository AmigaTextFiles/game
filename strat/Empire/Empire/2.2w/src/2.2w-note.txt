    This disk contains the source code for Amiga Empire 2.2w. Noe that this
only included the working copies (not RCS archives), and that only the
updated versions of files you sent me are included.

    If you would, could you please put the files that you have changed since
2.0 on this disk and return it? I would be interested to see any other bugs
you might have found, and what you changed to allow the deity to edit the
4 basic files.

    I have tested Empire on my new 3000, and it works fine under 2.0 and
with all the caches turned on (as I expected it would). I can now compile
the entire library directly in about 8 minutes or so, and it improves
the performance of Empire radically...
