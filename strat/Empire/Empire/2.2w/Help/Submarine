       A submarine is one of the deadliest types of ships. While it lacks
the power to function as an all-out assault craft, it can lie in wait for
enemy ships while staying out of sight under the waves. Only destroyers and
other subs have sonar to enable them to detect other subs. Typically, when
you detect a sub, only the sub number will be shown, NOT the owner. But if
you manage to sink a sub, some times the wreckage will identify the owner.
Note that it takes 3 shells for one torpedo, so a fully loaded sub can fire
9 shots before it must return to base. The guns are used as torpedo tubes,
and if they are damaged, the sub can't fire torpedos.
