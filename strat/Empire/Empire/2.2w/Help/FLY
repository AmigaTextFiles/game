fly <ship>|<sector> <plane-count> <bomb-count> <directions>
    fly planes (possibly with bombs) from ship or airfield. Directions are:

	u  - up                     8 - up
	/r - up right               9 - up right
	r  - right                  6 - right
	\r - down right             3 - down right
	d  - down             -OR-  2 - down
	/l - down left              1 - down left
	l  - left                   4 - left
	\l - up left                7 - up left
	e  - end of flying          . - end of flying
         (land or crash)
	v  - view sector below      5 - view sector below
	b  - drop some bombs        0 - drop some bombs

    Movement prompt is:
        <fuel left:planes:bombs each:position>
    Fuel comes from the starting airfield or carrier mobility. Landing
    chances vary greatly. Watch out for anti-aircraft fire. Fuel units per
    plane is from:

	fuelAvailable := sectorOrShipMobility * 4;
	fuelUsed := min(fuelAvailable, 32);	/* fuel tank size */
	fuelUnits := techFactor * fuelUsed;

    Note that these, as well as most other "magic" constants can be changed
    by the Deity. In good weather, when carrying no bombs, planes can fly
    one orthogonal sector per fuel unit. Fuel used rises by 1 for each bomb
    rack required (each rack can hold 3 bombs) and by 0.2 for each bomb
    carried. Diagonal flying takes 1.414 times as much fuel.
