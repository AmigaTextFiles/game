    Read your telegrams. If the telegram is from another country, and not
    generated by Empire itself, you will be able to reply before going on to
    the next one. After reading all the telegrams you will be asked if you
    wish to delete them. Answering yes will clear out your mailbox, while
    answering no will allow you to keep ALL the messages. If your mailbox is
    over 6k, you will NOT be able to receive new public messages (but you
    may still receive private messages), so you should clear out old
    messages as soon as possible. You may abort the current message by
    typing CTRL-C.
