buy <lot #>
    the specified lot, if it is still for sale, will be shown to you, and
    you will be given a chance to purchase it. If the lot is a ship, the
    purchase is straightforward. If the lot is items at an exchange, you
    will be asked how many of each item to buy and which exchange of yours
    to deliver the items to. Both the selling and the buying exchange must
    be at least 60% efficient, and you must be neutral or allied with the
    seller.
