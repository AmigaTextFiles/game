b   battleship   127 25  25  8   -  127 127   4   -   -    -    6

       The battleship is the biggest and most powerful of all the ships.
It can fire 4 guns at a target, and can carry the most military. They
are the best ship to use for an assault, and can start an invasion force
out right. They are also great for boarding other ships, but they will be
picked up on radar while they are quite a ways off, so a sneak attack is
out.
