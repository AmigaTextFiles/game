       Contracting a sector allows you to earn money instead of production
from certain sectors. This can be used if you should happen to go broke,
and can't get a loan from another player. You will be offered a price per
unit of production, and if you accept it, you will receive cash whenever
that sector would normally deliver it's production. Ore mines are the
best to contract. Needless to say, it won't do any good to contract a sector
that needs ore to produce production units if you are broke, as no ore
will be produced. You MUST contract the ore mines in that case.
       To remove a contract from a sector, and receive the production again,
contract the sector again, and refuse the amount offered.
