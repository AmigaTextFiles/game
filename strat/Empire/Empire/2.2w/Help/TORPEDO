torpedo <victim-ship> <submarine>
    Launch a torpedo against a ship from a submarine. Maximum range is less
    than 2 sectors. Each torpedo costs 3 shells from the submarine. The
    chances of the torpedo hitting drop greatly as the distance increases.
    To prevent submarines from being too powerful, a penalty is imposed for
    using the torpedo command - the sub's mobility drops to 0, and by a
    further 10 for each torpedo fired. If the target is a submarine, it may
    fire back, and any other subs owned by the same country in range will
    also launch torpedos. If the target is a surface ship, destroyers in
    your sector may drop depth charges on you.
