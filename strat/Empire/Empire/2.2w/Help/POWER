power {all} {force}
    Displays a summary of each countries status. It will be rebuilt if Empire
    can't find the power report where it expects it to be, or the report is
    not for the current day. If 'all' is specified then every country, even
    those that are dead or have quit, will be displayed. If 'force' is
    specified, then the report will be updated even if it is not out of date.
    Note that the Deity may restrict the force option.

       Power is calculated based on the following magic formula:

    (a*g+d)/3 + (b+c+e+ii)/10 + j/100 + f+i+h*5

    where

    a - number of sectors
    b - number of civilians
    c - number of military
    d - number of guns
    e - number of shells
    f - number of planes
    g - average sector efficiency
    h - number of gold bars
    i - number of ships
   ii - total ship tonnage
    j - money
