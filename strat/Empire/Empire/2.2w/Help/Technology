       Technology level determines how far your guns can fire, how fast
your ships are, and your likeliness of catching the plague. The higher
your technology level, the greater your chance to catch the plague. To
offset this you must also build up your research level. Having a higher
tech level will let you move your ships farther, and will give you greater
range for your guns on both ships and land. If you sell a ship that you built
to a country with a LOWER technology level, you will be able to charge a
"technology tax", and earn more than if you sell it to someone with an
equal or higher tech level.
