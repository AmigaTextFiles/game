info [what]
     [?]
    give info about various counts and factors in the current world. If
    no 'what' is given, only some general information is given.
    Possible values for 'what' are:
        production, mobilities, plague, costs, scales, updates,
        fighting, sea, air, miscellaneous, flags, naval
    The 'naval' can be followed by one of:
        cost, size, lrange, shrange, capacity, speed, damage
    You may also specify '?' for 'what', and a summary of all the topics will
    be listed. The output format is not pretty - it is exactly the same as is
    used when a deity is editing the same values.
Doc: deity, updates
Help: update, census
