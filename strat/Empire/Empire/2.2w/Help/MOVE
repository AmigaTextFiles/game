move <what> <sector> <count> <directions>
    <what> is cmsgpob. <sector> is where to move from. <count> is how many
    to move (watch out for bundling). <directions> are:

    u  - up                     8 - up
    /r - up right               9 - up right
    r  - right                  6 - right
    \r - down right             3 - down right
    d  - down           -OR-    2 - down
    /l - down left              1 - down left
    l  - left                   4 - left
    \l - up left                7 - up left
    e  - end of move            . - end move
    v  - view current sector    5 - view current sector

    Movement prompt is:
        <mobility:position>
    Mobility costs vary with sector type, weather, and what is being moved.
    Costs for an orthogonal move onto a "standard" sector in good weather
    are:

    c - 1 mobility per 5 civilians
    m - 1 mobility per 5 military
    s - 2 mobility per 5 shells
    g - 2 mobility per gun
    p - 4 mobility per plane
    o - 1 mobility per 5 tons of ore
    b - 10 mobility per gold bar  (armored cars, guards, etc.)

    Some sectors are better at moving some items than others. For
    example, warehouses can move ore, guns and shells in bundles of 10
    for the cost of 1 unit; banks can move gold bars in bundles of 4.
    Also, moving onto a 100% efficient highway costs no mobility.
