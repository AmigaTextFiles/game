Realms

   Realms are a short-cut to entering a set of sectors over and over.
Realm 0 can be abreviated as #, all other realms are referenced as
#1, #2 etc...

   Any time you need to enter a <sectors> (note <sectors>, not <sector>) list
you may enter a realm number. Realms may be set using the realm command. Any
changes you make to a realm will remain in effect from call to call. This
allows you to define a realm to contain one of your enemies and then refer
to that realm instead of having to manually enter the sector co-ords to bomb
etc.
