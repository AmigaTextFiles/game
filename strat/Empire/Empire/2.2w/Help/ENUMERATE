enumerate <sectors>
    count the number of sectors that match the <sectors> specification. For
    example, the command:

	enumerate #0?des=g&prod<10&gold<5

    could count how many gold mines in your realm #0 are ready to be turned
    into something else. To actually see the sectors, you can apply the
    same condition on a 'census' or 'map' command.
