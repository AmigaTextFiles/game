map <sectors> {compressed}
    shows the designation of the sectors you or god owns within the region.
    Other people show up as '?'. You can see sectors beside ones you own.
    When a deity does a map, he/she can see all sectors, and water shows
    up as spaces instead of dots. If 'compressed' is specified, then a
    horizontally compressed format will be used, which is harder to read
    but allows mapping of larger areas. A full <sectors> specification is
    allowed, which allows a map to show only selected sectors you own.
