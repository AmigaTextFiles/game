country
    list the countries in the world along with some info about them. A
    deity-settable flag controls whether or not country numbers appear as a
    left hand column of the list, or whether countries are just sorted
    alphabetically. In either case, a '*' to the left of an output line
    indicates that that country is currently connected to Amiga Empire.
