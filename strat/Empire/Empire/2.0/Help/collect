collect <loan #>
    if the given loan is an outstanding defaulted loan owed to you, you
    will be given the opportunity to confiscate a sector from the debtor in
    full or partial payment of the loan. Empire uses some magic to
    determine the "value" of a sector, which must not be too much greater
    than what you are owed. Note that you can only confiscate sectors that
    are orthogonally adjacent to a sector that you own.
