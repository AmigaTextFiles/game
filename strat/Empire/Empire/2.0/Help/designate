designate <sectors> <what>
    designate sectors to be a new type. The efficiency and production in
    the sectors will be set to zero unless the sector was already of the
    given designation. Your current capital cannot be redesignated as
    anything else. The LAST sector designated as a capital will be your
    current capital, which is at 0,0 in your co-ordinate system. 'what' is
    the single-letter name of the desired sector type. Only a deity can
    designate more mountains or sea sectors.
