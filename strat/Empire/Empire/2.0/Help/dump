dump <sectors>
    dumps sector information in a very compact, hexadecimal format. Useful
    for those who want to set up tools to display more useful maps, etc.
    The format is as follows:

	rrccdCCmmppMMeessggPPoobbddiiGG[dt*7]OK

    where

	rr - row, 0 to size of world - 1
	cc - column, 0 to size of world - 1
	d  - designation character
	CC - civilian count
	mm - military count
	pp - production
	MM - mobility
	ee - efficiency
	ss - shell count
	gg - gun count
	PP - plane count
	oo - iron ore count
	bb - gold bar count
	dd - relative location of defender (rowDelta + 8, colDelta + 8)
	ii - iron mineral deposit
	GG - gold mineral deposit
	dt - delivery direction and threshold for
	     civilians, military, shells, guns, planes, ore, gold bars
	O  - 0/1 indicating sector is contracted
	K  - 0/1 indicating sector is checkpointed

    When the Deity does a 'dump', the following is appending to the
    output lines:

	oossttuuuuuuuu

    where

	oo - owner of the sector
	ss - plague stage
	tt - plague time
	uuuuuuuu - last update time

    The sector output will be preceeded by a line giving the time and date
    of the dump. Note that some sectors "bundle" some items - urban centers
    bundle civilians, warehouses bundle shells, guns and ore, and banks
    bundle gold bars. The counts shown are the number of bundles. Bundles
    are bundles of 10, except for gold bars which are bundles of 4 in
    banks.
