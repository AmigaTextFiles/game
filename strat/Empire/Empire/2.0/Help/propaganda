propaganda [< file]
    allows you to insert an item into the 4th page of the newspaper. The
    items cannot be forged. The '< file' notation indicates that the
    message can be read from the named file in the default data directory.
    This is only of use to those playing directly on the host machine -
    those playing remotely can use facilities in their terminal program to
    use a file as propaganda.
