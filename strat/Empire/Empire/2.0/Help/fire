fire <sector>|<ship> <sector>|<ship>
    fire gun(s) at sector or ship from fortress or ship. If the target is a
    fortress it will try to fire back. If the target is any land sector
    that is defended, the defending fort will try to fire back. If the
    target is a ship, any ships belonging to the same country which are in
    the same fleet will attempt to fire back. The amount of damage done
    depends on how many guns are fired (from a ship), and on the type of
    the target ship. Firing requires 60% efficiency, a gun crew of at least
    5 military (for a fort), at least one gun and at least one shell.
