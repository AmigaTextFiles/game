radar <ship>|<sector>
    do a radar scan from a ship or a radar station. Shows the ships you
    find and a small map of what the radar sees. Range varies with ships
    and with sector efficiency. Note that submarines do not show up on
    radar (destroyers and submarines have sonar, however), and that PT
    boats are very hard to see. Also, radar does not show ownership of
    sectors it displays, so beware of relying on radar to see an enemy
    approaching overland.
