attack <sector>
    attempt to take over a sector with military from orthogonal sectors.
    Costs mobility and BTUs. The sector may be defended. For each
    orthogonal sector you own, you will be asked how many of the military
    there you wish to commit to the attack. Troops from a 100% efficient
    fort have a 4 to 1 defending advantage, and troops from 100% efficient
    capitals or banks have a 2 to 1 advantage. Troops attacking from a 100%
    efficient fort have a 2 to 1 advantage. Attacks cost BTUs at the rate
    of .15 per attacking troop killed. Also, mobility is used up in the
    attacking sectors depending on the terrain types as follows:

			  type of sector being attacked
	attacking from	    (+)   (?)	(-)   (^)
	(+) highway	   .125  .208  .291  21.3
	(?) others	   .167  .250  .333  21.3
	(-) wasteland	   .208  .291  .375  21.4
	(^) mountain	   10.7  10.8  10.9  31.9

    The running battle will be displayed using '*'s, '!'s and '@'s.
    A '!' indicated a defender has died, an '@' indicates an attacker
    has died, and a '*' indicates an entire attacking sector has run
    out of attackers.
