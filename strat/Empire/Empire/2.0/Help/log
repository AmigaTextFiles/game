log [<fileName>]
    attempt to log all subsequent input and output to the specified file.
    The local client 'Empire' supports logging, but the serial port client,
    'SEREmp' does not. Thus, the log attempt will fail for people who are
    logged in over a serial port. 'log' with no file name will turn off any
    current logging.
