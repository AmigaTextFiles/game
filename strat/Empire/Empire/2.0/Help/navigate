navigate <ship>|<fleet> <directions>
    sail ships. <directions> are

	u  or 8 - up
	/r or 9 - up right
	r  or 6 - right
	\r or 3 - down right
	d  or 2 - down
	/l or 1 - down left
	l  or 4 - left
	\l or 7 - up left
	e  or . - end of sailing
	v  or 5 - look at current sector (shows sea versus harbour)

    Costs vary with ship type and technology level. Watch out for mines.
    Movement prompt is <flagship mobility:minimum mobility:position>. You
    can't navigate fleet '*'. The flagship is the first ship given when the
    fleet was set up. When the flagship can no longer navigate, the whole
    fleet stops. Sailing into a hurricane can damage your ships. Ships use
    less mobility for navigating as your country's tech factor increases.
