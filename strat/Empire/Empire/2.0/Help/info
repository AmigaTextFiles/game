info [what]
    Give info about various counts and factors in the current world. If
    no 'what' is given, only some general information is given. 'what':
	production, mobilities, plague, costs, scales, updates,
	fighting, sea, air, miscellaneous, flags, naval
    'naval' must be followed by one of:
	cost, size, lrange, shrange, capacity, speed, damage
    The output format is not pretty - it is exactly the same as is used
    when a deity is editing the same values.
Doc: deity, updates
Help: update, census
