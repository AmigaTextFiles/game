telegram <country> ... <country> [< file]
    Send a telegram to the given country(s). A deity can send the telegram
    to everyone by using '*' as the country. You will be prompted for the
    telegram. Note that sending a telegram to someone is noted in the
    newspaper. The '< file' notation requests that the telegram contents be
    read from the given file. The file will be looked for in the default
    data directory, so this feature is only of use to those running
    directly on the host system. Those playing remotely can usually send a
    file using facilities of their terminal program.
