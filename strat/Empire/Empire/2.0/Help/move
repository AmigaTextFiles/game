move <what> <sector> <count> <directions>
    <what> is cmsgpob. <sector> is where to move from. <count> is how many
    to move (watch out for bundling). <directions> are:

	u  or 8  - up
	/r or 9 - up right
	r  or 6 - right
	\r or 3 - down right
	d  or 2 - down
	/l or 1 - down left
	l  or 4 - left
	\l or 7 - up left
	e  or . - end of move
	v  or 5 - view current sector

    Beware that the numeric directions correspond to numeric keypad
    positions, and are not the same as the delivery directions show on the
    'census' command. Movement prompt is <mobility:position>. Mobility
    costs vary with sector type, weather, and what is being moved. Costs
    for an orthogonal move onto a "standard" sector in good weather are:

	c - 1 mobility per 5 civilians
	m - 1 mobility per 5 military
	s - 2 mobility per 5 shells
	g - 2 mobility per gun
	p - 4 mobility per plane
	o - 1 mobility per 5 tons of ore
	b - 10 mobility per gold bar  (armoured cars, guards, etc.)

    Some sectors are better at moving some items than others. For
    example, warehouses can move ore, guns and shells in bundles of 10
    for the cost of 1 unit; banks can move gold bars in bundles of 4.
    Also, moving onto a 100% efficient highway costs no mobility.
