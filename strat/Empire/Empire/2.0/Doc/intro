		Amiga Empire by Chris Gray - Introduction


Amiga Empire is a multi-player game of exploration, economics and warfare.
It can be played by a single player, but most of the fun will be absent.
People who have never played before can set up a small game for
experimentation, however. Amiga Empire does not use any graphics or sound -
it uses a simple command oriented text interface. This is because most
players will be connecting to the game over a modem, and many of them will
not even be playing on Amigas. Thus, a consistent interface which uses
sound, graphics, menus, or the mouse, is simply not possible. Other
programmers, notably "Håkan Thörngren", have written graphical interfaces
to Amiga Empire. These tools can given a significant advantage to those who
use them.

The basic structure of an Empire "world" is that of a square array of
sectors. Each sector will be a sea sector, a mountain, or a regular land
sector. Regular land sectors are the only ones which players can own and
build on. Moving people and things across mountain sectors is very
expensive in terms of mobility, so they can be thought of as natural
barriers. Sea sectors cannot be moved into at all, but there are several
types of ships that can be built to move things and engage in naval
warfare. Also, bridges can be built over narrow gaps of sea sectors. The
world is "torroidal" in that it wraps around on all edges.

An efficient government (I haven't seen one of those for a long time!)
doesn't waste time or effort. To encourage this, Empire has the concept of
Bureaucracy Time Units (BTU's) which are required to execute many commands.
The game prompt consists of '[', followed by the number of remaining BTUs,
a ':', the number of remaining minutes of time for the day, ']' and the
prompt " Command: ". As you play, keep an eye on the two numbers, and make
sure you get the important things done. BTUs are created by your active
capital in accordance with the number of civilians there and the efficiency
of the capital. Connect time is reset at or after midnight.

Money is needed to build ships and bridge spans, for upkeep of various
types of sectors, for military supplies, etc. It can be earned as interest
on gold bars at banks, by contracting production of appropriate sectors, by
selling things to other players, or by making loans to other players.

Technology level controls your technology factor, which affects the range
of guns, airplanes, ships, etc. Technology level is increased by the
efforts of technology center sectors.

Research level, in combination with technology level, affects your
likelihood of catching the plague. Research level is increased by the
efforts of research institute sectors.

Both technology and research levels go up 1 for each 25 units of production
available in the appropriate sectors. Both also decay away at the rate of
1% per day.

The full game seems quite complicated, but in reality an entire game
can go by without some of the commands ever being used. The most commonly
used commands are:

    bye - exit the game
    map - display a rectangle of sectors
    move - move men or materials from one sector to another
    designate - start building a sector as something
    navigate - sail a ship or fleet of ships
    fire - fire from a sector or ship at another sector or ship
    telegram - send a telegram to someone
    read - read your own telegrams
    census - get a detailed report of some sectors
    country - see what other countries exist and are currently connected
    power - get a summary of the power of the various countries

Game play typically goes through several phases:

    exploration - players move out from their initial sanctuaries and
	explore and claim a region of territory.

    contact - some of the countries meet and set up borders. Small fights
	can break out, but these can severely weaken the participants.

    development - players set up their countries. This involves getting
	gold mines running and delivering gold bars to banks, getting an
	urban center going to produce more civilians, choosing which
	sectors to turn into iron mines and various factory types, setting
	up delivery routes for ore and manufactured goods, finding a
	hiding place for a backup capital, etc. The priority of these
	things will vary from player to player, and a surprise attack
	during the later parts of this phase can badly damage a country
	that is not adequately defended.

    naval exploration - countries now have ships (often a couple of PT
	boats at this point) and start exploring the oceans. There are
	usually two goals - one is to find large, unclaimed islands to take
	over; the other is to map out the basic shape of the world and find
	where the other countries are. Naval warfare can crop up at any
	time. Submarine "wolfpacks" prey on underdefended fleets, coastal
	radar station/fort pairs fire on ships that come too close,
	paranoid countries mine their harbours to keep others out, nasty
	people mine other countries harbours, etc.

    stockpiling, alliances, war - the players start to get bored if they
	haven't been involved in a fight, so the slightest excuse (often a
	sector or two on a shared island, or minor things like a fleet
	being sunk) can be used to pick a fight.

    victory - one possible victory condition is when one country (or one
	strong alliance of countries) controls the entire world. In a large
	game with many players, such a final victory is difficult to
	accomplish, and is boring for those whose countries have already
	been destroyed. An alternative victory condition is that of being
	at the top of a "power" report at a pre-specified time or date.

By default, Amiga Empire will run with an ETU (Empire Time Unit) of 30
minutes. Such a game will last 2 - 4 months. This parameter can be changed,
either when creating the world with EmpCre, or by a deity in Empire itself,
to much lower values. Values of 10 - 30 seconds will result in a game which
can probably be played over a weekend. Such games have a quite different
flavour, especially if the hosting system has enough serial ports and
modems to support 4 or more simultaneous players. Such a fast update time
with a large world may require a faster CPU and a hard disk.


The easiest way to learn how to play Amiga Empire is to play it. When you
don't understand something, or want more information, these documentation
files and the shorter, more specific help files are available on line via
the 'doc' and 'help' commands. (The hosting system may not have all of them
online.) A printed manual, at least of the 'doc' files, is probably best.
Details of command syntax can be found under 'help syntax'.


The other documentation files in this directory are:

    communication - talking to other players, editing messages, etc.
    economics - earning and spending money, loans, etc.
    society - a random grab-bag
    sectors - details on the various sector types
    ships - details on the various ship types
    weather - how it works, what it can do
    aircraft - planes, anti-aircraft fire
    war - land, air, sea, defense
    update - details of sector and ship updating
    factors - the many deity-adjustable factors
    deity - how to be a deity
    hosting - notes on running a game
    empcre - details on creating new worlds
    seremp - details on running the serial port client

Most players need not read any of the last 6 files.


As an example, here is a log of starting up a new country. User input can
be identified by the "Command: " prompt. The new country is called
'Amelon', which is what I usually call my countries. Commentary is shown
indented from commands and output.

[96:60] Command: map -2:2,-2:3
   - - 0 0 0 0
   2 1 0 1 2 3

01   - . . .   01
02	       02

   - - 0 0 0 0
   2 1 0 1 2 3

    This country, like all new countries, starts out with two sanctuary
    sectors, side by side. In the map, I can only see sectors which are
    beside sectors I own. I can see 6 wilderness sectors (the -'s) and 4
    sea sectors (the .'s).

[95:60] Command: move m 0,0 1 \le
You are breaking sanctuary!!!
You now own sector -1,-1

    Move a single military from sector 0,0. It is moved up-left to sector
    -1,-1. Moving anything out of a sanctuary causes that sanctuary to be
    "broken", turning the sanctuary into a capital. The sector moved into
    was vacant, so it now belongs to this player. If you have trouble
    remembering what the parameters to some commands are, just leave off
    the parameters - Empire will prompt for them. For the 'move' command,
    the available directions are:

	u  - up
	/r - up right
	r  - right
	\r - down right
	d  - down
	/l - down left
	l  - left
	\l - up left

    I remember them by remembering that the '/' or '\' always comes first,
    and the movement hits it going in the direction of the 'l' or 'r' and
    slides up or down the '/' or '\'.

[93:60] Command: move m 0,0 1 /le
You now own sector 1,-1
[91:60] Command: move m 0,0 1 le
You now own sector 0,-1
[89:60] Command: move m 0,0 1 ue
You now own sector -1,0
[87:60] Command: move m 0,1 1 ue
You are breaking sanctuary!!!
You now own sector -1,1
[85:60] Command: move m 0,1 1 /re
You now own sector -1,2

    Continue moving military out, taking over all of the visible
    wildernesses. Note the BTU count going down as I issue commands.

[83:60] Command: map -2:2,-2:3

   - - 0 0 0 0
   2 1 0 1 2 3

    The map now shows many more sectors, including a mountain (^). The
    sector at 0,3 is accessible from sector -1,2.

[82:60] Command: realm 0 -3:3,-3:4

    Typing the four corners of a box is tiresome, so use the 'realm'
    command to define a realm (box). I can then use '#0' to talk about
    this realm. As a further abbreviation, just '#' refers to realm 0.

[82:59] Command: designate #/- +

   - - - 0 0 0 0 0
   3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4

    Turn all of the wilderness that we own in realm 0 into highways (+).
    (The "#/-" notation is a simple form of a "condition" which can be used
    to select a few sectors out of a large rectangle of them.) Highways are
    easier, in terms of mobility, to move across than wildernesses. Note
    that the highways will not be efficient yet, so they will not cost NO
    mobility, which they do when they are 100% efficient. Another reason
    for doing a designate like this is so that I can tell which of the
    sectors I own.

    Take a detailed look at the sectors I own. 'cmsgpob' refers to delivery
    directions for civilians, military, shells, guns, planes, iron ore and
    gold bars, none of which we have set up yet. We see that our two
    initial sanctuaries at 0,0 and 0,1 are now 100% efficient capitals.
    They started out with 100 mobility, 64 civilians, 64 military and 64
    iron ore each. The 'min' and 'gold' columns are the important ones here
    as they show the richness of the iron and gold deposits in the sectors.
    Sectors -1,-1 and -1,2 look like good places for gold mines, and
    sectors 0,-1 and 0,0 look like good places for iron mines.

[77:58] Command: designate 0,0 m
*** can't redesignate your current capital ***

    Empire won't let us redesignate our current capital (at 0,0), so we
    must first move the capital (to 0,1 here, since having a 100% capital
    is good).

[76:58] Command: designate 0,1 c
WARNING: your co-ordinate system has shifted to center on your new capital!

    0,0 is now at what used to be 0,1.

[75:58] Command: designate 0,-1 m
Tearing down 100% efficient capital at 0,-1

    Changing a sector into something else involves tearing down what was
    there before, so we are told of the destruction. Lets see what other
    countries can see of what we have been doing, and what anyone else has
    done:

    There is no initial power report. Also, a deity can control whether or
    not non-deities can 'force' a new power report (it can take quite a
    long time on large worlds), so one is not automatically built.

[73:58] Command: power force

    The 'nation' command shows some information about my country. I haven't
    spent any money yet, and my technology and research levels are still 0
    since I haven't even built any technology centers or research
    institutes yet. Six realms can be defined.

    Another country, called 'Victim' has been created. He was last playing
    a few seconds ago. Note that my capital was automatically updated when
    I entered the game. This has given me more BTU's, and, because it is
    the next day, has reset my time left to 60 minutes.

    'Victim' is already ahead of 'Amelon' in the power report. Perhaps he
    is a more experience player. Looks like I might want to take over some
    more sectors. Has anything else happened while I was away?

    The capital hasn't changed much, but did get some more mobility. The
    mine has grown to 10% efficient. A few more civilians have appeared in
    both sectors. What did my country look like again?

    Expand realm 0 yet again. It looks like I'm definitely on the south
    shore of a continent or island. Future exploration will have to be to
    the north. How am I doing now?

    Much better, but I still have more to do. (The main reason that
    'Victim' has more "power" is that he hasn't redesignated either of his
    sanctuaries yet, so he still has two sectors at 100% efficiency.)


This should have been enough to get you going. Strategies beyond this point
vary greatly from person to person. Some even vary what you've seen here,
e.g. by moving out in straight lines from the sanctuaries, getting a "long"
view of what the world is like. In moving, be careful not to dump people
into the sea, or waste mobility making them climb a mountain! Also keep in
mind the mobility costs of varying the number of military moved, whether
they are moved orthogonally or diagonally, what they are moving onto, etc.
It usually doesn't matter, but if you are cutting things close, it can.

You should now either start up a small test world to explore for yourself,
or continue reading the documentation in this directory.
