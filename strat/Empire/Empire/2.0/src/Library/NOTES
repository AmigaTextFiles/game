Only one resource (world, country, sector, ship, fleet, loan, offer) may be
locked at a time. The following operations are allowed while a resource is
locked:

    readWorld, readCountry, readSector, readShip, readFleet, readLoan,
	readOffer, news, sendTelegram

Note, however, that the client must save and restore the locked resource from
the request while doing one of the above while a resource is locked, since
doing one of them uses the space of the resource.

Messages to the user should NOT be done while a resource is locked, since the
user can suspend output, thus locking the resource indefinitely. Flag
ES*.es_noWrite is available to ride over a lock period. When it is set, all
output to the user is buffered up, rather than being flushed when a newline
is seen. Thus, it can be set when the lock is obtained, then cleared when
the lock is released. 'uFlush' can be called to flush anything buffered up.
