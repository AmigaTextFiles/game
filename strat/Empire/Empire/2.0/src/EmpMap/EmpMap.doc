Sorry, I don't have any documentation for EmpMap yet. The deity should do
maps of sectors owned by a specific country, e.g.

    map >pipe:map 0:255,0:255?owner=1

then, from EmpMap, do a 'god map parse', selecting the correct country, and
read from pipe:map (using pipe: saves a lot of disk space - the maps can
be big). NOTE: you must use the new drio.lib to make the stuff with
pipe: work properly. Note also the special code in Empire's redirection
code to handle it.

A regular user just does a map of his region. Each regular user will likely
make himself the first country, and add the others as he finds them. The
deity will likely add them in country-number order.

Country names must match in order for lookout parsing to work.

The change owner and change designation modes work with the mouse - click
on the right button to turn the mode off. If one of the modes is on and
you've gone to another window and want to come back to the EmpMap one, just
click in the title bar.

The colour requester sometimes makes the background red (at least on my
system it does). As near as I can tell, this is a system bug.
