			       Update notes:

Empfe 2.1.1 -> Empfe 2.2.0
	- Added more parse code.
	- Minor internal changes to the parse code.
	- Minor internal fixes with ship link/unlink from sectors.
	- Messages and "You have new telegrams." is not eaten by
	  hidden delayed commands any more.
	- Internal delayed commands will no longer survive a reconnect
	  to Empire.
	- New menu option "Misc->Verify and fix database" which will
	  try to fix database problems.
	- New menu option "Set->Sectors dirty" which will mark all your
	  sectors dirty. The auto dumper will then auto dump all your
	  sectors. This is useful if Empfe fails to understand when it
	  should auto dump all your sectors.
	- Spy on sea sectors caused incorrect sea sectors in the database,
	  fixed.
	- Added semaphores to protect the database when accessing it from
	  several tasks at the same time. It could go wrong in same rare
	  situations before and it's probably not 100% bullet proof now
	  either.
	- Fixed a bug in NextShip which caused some ships to be skipped.
	- Maximum length ship names (12 characters) will no longer cause
	  ship info lines to be shifted one position to the right.
	- ARexx put_ship('name'..) will return an error if the given name
	  is longer than 12 characters.
	- The local client wouldn't accept lines longer than 128 characters.
	  The limit now is 499 characters and Empire won't accept more.
	- The 7th bit of entered characters was always cleared, fixed.
	  Empfe should now read and write foreign characters properly.
	- Fixed a real nasty bug that caused a thrashed Empfe database
	  when a sector was overwritten (this happens when the user takes
	  over a new sector) in 128x128 and 256x256 worlds when the path 
	  finder was running.
	- Ships were not unlinked when their sector was deleted, fixed.
	- The sector size modify routines didn't always inherit the
	  ships list and could write previously freed memory in some cases,
	  fixed.
	- Changes in the doc, it appears as ARexx cannot handle optional
	  arguments properly. If an argument is left out it seems that
	  the previous argument at that position rules, not funny.
	  This affects read_empfe_screen() and write_empfe_screen()
	  which no longer have an optional pen color.
	- It's now possible to click sectors and ships as a response
	  to read_empfe_screen() while not connected to Empire.
	- The path finder can now generate paths through mined sectors,
	  but it will try to avoid it if it's possible.
	- Added new ARexx function mobility_length() which will 
	  return the path length times 2.
	- Added new menu option "Preferences->Send return on block"
	  which tells Empfe whether you want a block to be terminated
	  by a return or not.
	- Added new ARexx function in_fix_coordinate() which will convert
	  an external coordinate (returned by out_fix_coordinate) to
	  the internal format. You should call this function to normalize
	  any coordinate given by the user.
	- Lots of bug fixes made in external ARexx macros.
	- It was possible to write your own anonymous telegrams and fool
	  another Empfe into just anything, fixed.
	- Empfe will no longer permit the user to load a database, the menu
	  option is still there, but shaded. There were bugs in this code
	  and it wasn't really useful as you couldn't change the init file.
	- Fixed a problem with stopping a not complete navigate/move/fly 
	  when the command was issued by ARexx.
	- It's now possible to reach the screen's depth arrange gadgets.
	- Added new flags in the info window:
	  3-9 - The info is this number of days old.
	  X - The info is 10 or more days old.


Empfe 2.1.0 -> 2.1.1
	- Fixed three bugs that caused Empfe to read low memory.
	- Added delivery threshold and defender information in the
	  title.
	- do_command() and queue_command() will no longer freeze when a
	  '' argument is given. 
	- Bundling is now done properly for delivery thresholds.
	- Empfe will now auto-view sectors in interactive 
	  move/fly/navigate when the sector below is unknown. 
	  Empfe will not auto-view nasty unknown sectors who fires
	  flak.
	- Added a few more texts to the parser.
	- Added user variable `Priority' (integer) which is the Task 
	  priority  Empfe will use. If not given, Empfe will use the
	  priority given by the operating system.
	  You may also use the new -p switch in the command line (CLI)
	  to set the priority.
	- Fixed a bug in logical expressions. '-' was treated as the
	  start of a (negative) number, but it also was a wilderness
	  sector. Empfe now assumes that you mean wilderness when '-'
	  isn't followed by a digit.
	- Login with a new country will now terminate the login procedure
	  when Empire asks if you want to create the country.


Empfe 2.0.4 - > 2.1.0
	- Added some new user variables:
	  DropDTR
		Empfe will drop the DTR rather than sending +++ATH
		to hang up the connection if this variable is set
		to 1. Default is 0 (+++ATH).
	  Serial7Wire 
		Use real hardware handshake if set to 1, default is 0,
		which should use the serial settings from preferences.
	  DelayedCommandColor
		The pen color for delayed command issued by ARexx.
		(default 1 (white))
	  HideDelayedCommandsFromARexx
		A boolean variable that tells whether Empfe will display
		delayed commands for ARexx or not. 
		If you set this variable to 1 (TRUE) and the variable 
		HideDelayedCommads 0 (FALSE), you will see delayed commands 
		issued by ARexx as well.
		(default 0)
	- Added some new ARexx functions:
	  get_variable('var') 
		Will return the value of the given user variable.
		get_variable('PrinterDevice') => 'prt:'
	  hang_up()
		Hang up any serial connection.
	- Empfe used to guru when quitting with macros still running.
	  Empfe now waits for each macro and gives them a helping hand to
	  terminate as they show up.
	- Added Workbench Tool Type INITFILE. Have a line like:
	  INITFILE=filename
	  as a Workbench Tool Type to read the init file filename as it
	  would have been specified from the CLI.
	- The user variable ARexxLogin now has "LoginCmds.empfe" by default.
	  The old name conflicted with a built in ARexx function.
	- Empfe will now auto login properly as a local client.
	- International character handling has been improved, Empfe simply 
	  used to strip off the high bit before.
	- There seems to have been trouble cleaning up properly after 
	  get_match().
	  I was able to make it guru myself when I quitted Empfe while a 
	  get_match() was running. 
	  I fixed the code a bit and were unable to make it guru again. 
	  I'm not sure what the problem really was or if it's bullet proof now,
	  but it seems to work better.
