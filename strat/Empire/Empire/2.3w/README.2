             Amiga Empire Version 2.2w by Chris Gray & David Wright

If everything unpacked OK, you should have the following files on this disk:

    ReadMe - this file.

    Doc - directory of Amiga Empire documentation. If you haven't played
        this kind of Empire before, fire up 'Reader' in that directory -
        it will read through all of the documentation files. Type a
        question mark for help within 'Reader'.

    Help - directory containing the online help files.

    EmpFE - A graphic front-end for Empire which may be usede locally or
        over the serial port. This is the reccomended way to play Empire,
        if you have the RAM to support it.
