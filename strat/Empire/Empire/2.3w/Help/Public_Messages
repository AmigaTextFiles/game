       Public messages can be sent by using * for the name of the country.
You will enter the message as usual, and when you are done a copy will be
sent to every active player. Note that the system owner (deity/god) may
not allow public messages. The usual reason for this is limited disk
storage space, or a system running without a hard drive.
   You may send messages to all your allies by using &, to all your
enemies by using !, and all countries you are neutral to by using @.
