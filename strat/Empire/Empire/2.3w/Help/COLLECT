collect <loan #>
    If the given loan is an outstanding defaulted loan owed to you, you
    will be given the opportunity to confiscate a sector from the
    debtor in full or partial payment of the loan. Empire uses some
    magic to determine the "value" of a sector, which must not be too
    much greater than what you are owed. Note that you can only
    confiscate sectors that are orthogonally adjacent to a sector that
    you own. If the country that owes you money should be destroyed, you
    will have the option of collecting 80% of the balance, without interest.
    The loan will then be considered PAID IN FULL.
