radar <ship>|<sector>
    Do a radar scan from a ship or a radar station. Shows the ships you find
    and a small map of what the radar sees. Range varies with ships and with
    sector efficiency. Note that submarines do not show up on radar
    (destroyers and submarines have sonar, however), and that PT boats are
    very hard to see.
    Also, radar does not show ownership of sectors it displays, so beware of
    relying on radar to see an enemy approaching over land. Enemy sectors
    will sometimes show up as 'W', allied sectors as 'A', and everything
    else as '?' if the range or weather is good enough.
