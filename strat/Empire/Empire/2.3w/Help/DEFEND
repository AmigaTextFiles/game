defend <sectors> {%|sector}
    if the '%' is given, then you will be asked for your password, and, if
    correct, the defender for any defended sector in the specified area is
    displayed. Otherwise, you need to enter the location of a fort to
    defend the given sectors. If no defender is given on the command line,
    you will be asked for the defender for each sector in the specified
    area. When a defended sector is attacked, assaulted or fired on, the
    defending fort will attempt to fire on the attacker. The presence of a
    defense is indicated by a '%' in the census listing.
