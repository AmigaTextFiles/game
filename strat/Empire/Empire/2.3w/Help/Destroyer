       The destroyer is the workhorse of the military fleet. It has a very
good speed, excellent visability, and is quite small. It may also drop
depth charges on enemy subs, and lay mines in open ocean. This is about
the best ship to use in a boarding attempt. Note that it takes more than 1
shell to drop mines.
