       Fleets allow you to set up logical groups of ships, and refer to
them as a single unit using a single letter. Typically you will want to
set all the ships in a given area or sector into a single fleet. This
will allow you to navigate them at the same time (saving time and BTU's).
To navigate using fleets, use the fleet letter (a-z and A-Z). Each fleet
has a flagship. The flagship will be the first ship specified in the
fleet except fleet *, in which the lowest ship number is the flagship.
       Having ships in a fleet will also help them if they are attacked. A
ship that is in a fleet will be defended by the other ships in the fleet
if it is attacked (and the defenders are in range).
       You must put ships in fleet * before you can put them up for
sale.
