refurb <ship>
    refurbish a ship at a harbor. Refurbishing brings the ship's technology
    level up, possibly to your nation's technology level if the harbor has
    sufficient production units. Ship technology levels drop over time, but
    normally much slower than your country's does.
    Refurbishing a ship will cost you money, as well as 1/4 of the tech
    levels to be raised in production units.
