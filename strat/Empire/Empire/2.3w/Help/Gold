       Gold bars are produced in gold mines (g). The higher a sector's GOLD
rating, the more gold bars it will produce. GOLD does go down as the bars
are made, so you should have the delivery for the bars set and be ready to
turn the gold mine into something else when the GOLD rating drops to less
than 10.
       The more gold bars you have in the bank, the more interest you will
earn, and the higher you will be in the power report. You should think
twice before selling gold bars at an exchange center because the generate
money for the rest of the game, making their value much greater.
