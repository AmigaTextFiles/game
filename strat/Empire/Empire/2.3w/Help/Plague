       The plague is a viral disease born of crowded cities and technology
run rampant without regard to health research. It spreads in 3 stages.
In the first stage you will find your people feeling ill and God will
send you a telegram telling you of outbreaks of the plague. During this
initial stage it is not contagious, and you have time to evacuate the
sectors. The next stage IS contagious, and any movement through the sector,
by the move command or deliveries, will spread the plague to the sectors it
passes through. There is no notification of stage 2. The last stage is the
deadly stage. People will begin to die, but it is no longer contagious. It
is possible for an entire sector to be wiped out and an enemy may walk in and
take what is left there...
