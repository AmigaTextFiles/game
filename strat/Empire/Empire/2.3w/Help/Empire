       Empire is a fairly rich simulation of international politics,
economics and war. It is played over a period of a few months by 2 or more
people. The Empire world consists of a toroidal grid of sectors consisting
of regular land, mountains and water. Players govern countries, which start
out as a pair of adjacent sectors and soon spread into large areas
requiring much management and protection. Various sector types can be
created which build ships, bridges, guns, shells, airplanes, and which make
medical and technological breakthroughs. Others are things like radar
stations, weather stations, fortresses, highways, warehouses, etc. A
special country, the Deity, is available, which has godlike powers to
modify sectors, ships, etc. The Deity is responsible for fixing up any
problems which occur during the game.
       Empire is a freely distributable program written originally by
Chris Gray for the Amiga, and has been modified by David Wright to
it's present form. If you are interested in getting Empire, just send a
telegram to god asking for more information.
       Just for your information, the current version of Empire is in
several pieces. There is a server program which is running at all times, and
which does all disk access and file I/O. The client programs make use of a
shared library (199k long), which allows another player to be added at a cost
of less than 40k. Altogather about 300k is consumed for a typical 3 users
at a time system. However, the sectors data file alone can be from 600k to
2.8 MEG long, so it remains on disk.
