       Guns may not always be used to shoot shells. A sub uses it's guns as
torpedo tubes. The more guns a ship may have, the more damage it can do in
a single turn. Guns are produced in defense factories (d). On land,
fortresses need guns and shells to be able to defend other sectors. Other
sectors such as capitals and banks need guns if they are to do anti-
aircraft firing.
