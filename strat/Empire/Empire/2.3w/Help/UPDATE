update <sectors> {verbose|quiet}
    perform the update operation on the given sectors. Other commands that
    need to change a sector will do an update too. Order of access is from
    top-to-bottom, left-to-right. This can affect how you want to set up
    deliveries, since this is when they are done. 'verbose' will supply
    more messages than you would normally get about the updating. 'quiet'
    will suppress nearly all update messages.
