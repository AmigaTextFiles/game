census <sectors>
   Prints a detailed census for the specified sectors.
   Some entries:
     * - checkpointed - allows others access if they know
         the code
     cmsgpob - delivery direction for item - 0 is up, go
               clockwise
         c = Civilians      7 0 1
         m = Military        \|/
 Item->  s = Shells         6- -2   ---> Direction
         g = Guns            /|\
         p = Planes         5 4 3
         o = Ore
         b = Gold Bars
     $ - sector's production is contracted
     % - sector is defended by a fort

       Example census report:

    In the aboce example the ore mine at -1,0 delivers it's ore to the
    right, as indicated by the "2" under the "o" of "cmsgpob".

    The right-hand column is the co-ordinate of the sector. The column
    headed 'des' is the current designation of the sector. 'eff' is the
    sector's efficiency, 'min' and 'gold' are the richness of the iron and
    gold deposits, respectively, and 'mob' is the sector's mobility.
    Columns from 'civl' to 'bar' are the current quantities of those items
    in the sector. 'prod' is the number of production units currently in
    the sector. For a harbor, this is the number available for building
    ships; for many other sectors it is a transient work value that will
    soon be turned into that sector's final product. The column headed
    'cmsgpob' summarizes the delivery directions for goods in that sector.
    This will be 'x's for an exchange, but for other sectors it will be a
    number from 0 to 7 or a space. A space is normal, and indicates no
    delivery set up. A number is the direction, where 0 is up, 1, is up-
    right, 2 is right, etc. There are two unlabelled columns to the left of
    the delivery directions. The first can contain a '$', indicating that
    the production of the sector is contracted. The second can contain a
    '*', indicating that the sector is checkpointed. The space column
    between the 'b' delivery and the 'des' heading can contain a '%',
    indicating that the sector is defended by a fort.

    NOTE: unlike in previous releases of Amiga Empire, the current 'census'
    command will NOT update sectors. You must use the 'update' command to
    do that. Any sector which can be changed by a command will be updated
    by that command, however.
