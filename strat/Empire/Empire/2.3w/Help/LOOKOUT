lookout <ship>|<sector>
    visual lookout - reports on nearby ships and sectors. In good weather,
    orthogonal and diagonal land sectors can be seen; in bad weather, only
    orthogonal neighbors. Lookout from ship to ship depends on the size of
    the ship doing the lookout and the ships to be seen.
