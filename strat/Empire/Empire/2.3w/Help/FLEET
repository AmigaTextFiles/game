fleet <fleet> {<ships>}
    add the ships to the given fleet. All start out in fleet '*'. Valid
    fleets are A-Z and a-z. The first ship specified will be the flagship
    of the fleet - when it can no longer navigate, the entire fleet will
    stop. For non-flagship ships in a fleet which is moving, the ship will
    drop behind if it can't move. A ship can be removed from a fleet by
    adding it to the '*' fleet. If no 'ships' argument is given, then the
    ships in the given fleet are displayed.
