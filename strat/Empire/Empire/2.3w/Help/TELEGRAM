telegram <country> {<country> ... <country>}
         * | & | ! | @
    Sends a telegram to another country. A telegram is ended by an
    end-of-file marker (control-backslash) or by a period (.) on a line by
    itself. Private telegrams are sent by giving a single country name or
    number (a number MUST be used is the country name has spaces in it). A
    public message can be sent by entering '*' for the country name. This
    will send a copy of the message to every ACTIVE player that has LESS
    THAN 6k in their mailbox (they can still receive private mail).
    Remember, this sends a COPY of the file, not just a pointer as on a BBS,
    so if you send a 1k message, the system will need to make up to 45
    copies (45k), and this could take up time.
    You may also send telegrams to countries based on your diplomatic
    relations to them. Using & will send a copy of the telegram to all
    countries that you are ALLIED with, using ! will send a copy of the
    telegram to all countries you are at WAR with, and using @ will send a
    copy of the telegram to all countries you are neutral towards.
    If more than one country is specified, then a copy will be sent to each
    of those countries.
