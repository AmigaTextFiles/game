ships {<ships>} {<fleet>}
    Like census, but displays info for ships. If <ships> is not given, all
    of your ships will be displayed. if <fleet> is given then only ships in
    that fleet will be displayed. You may also use conditions to list
    ships the same as you can for sectors. The conditions of a ship which
    can be tested are:
         efficiency, mobility, military, planes, shells, ore, civilians,
         guns, bars, type, tf (tech factor), and owner
    The last is only useful for the Deity.
    This command DOES update the ships.
