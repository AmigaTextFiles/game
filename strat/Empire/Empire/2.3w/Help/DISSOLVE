    THIS IS A NON-REVERSIBLE ACTION
    Dissolve allows you to remove your country from the game if you
    wish to no longer be an active player in the current game, but don't want
    your sectors getting taken over immediately. All of your sectors will be
    torn down and may be contaminated with the plague. All ships will be
    ordered to blow up, and a news item will be generated. This is
    considered an extremely cowardly action, and should be used with care,
    as it is irreversible. You must enter your password to verify this
    action.
