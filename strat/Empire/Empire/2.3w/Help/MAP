map <sectors> {compressed} {!}
    Shows the designation of the sectors you, a country you are allied with,
    or god owns within the region. A sector owned by a country that
    is at war with you shows up as 'W', while sectors owned by a country
    that is neutral to you show up as '?'.
    You can see sectors next to ones you or a country allied with you owns.
    Beware of angering God, or you may find yourself surrounded by fog...
    Using the options "compressed" or "!" will do the opposite of the
    default compressed option. Use the "change" command to change your
    countries compression default. By default, compression is off. Having
    compression on results in a map with no extra spaces, and so you can see
    more columns on the screen.
