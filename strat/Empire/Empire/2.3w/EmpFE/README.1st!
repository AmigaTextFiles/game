    This entire contents of this directory was provided by Håken Thörngren
for inclusion in version 2.2w of Amiga Empire. This entire directory may also
be archived and distributed seperately, if you choose.

    The only change made to the files was to move the demo sectors he
provided into a directory called "demo", and to point all the references
to the demo sectors back to this file.

    If you click on the Empfe icon, you will get the demo sectors and not
any world you may have created. To actually start using Empfe you must
edit the Empfe icon and change the line:

    SectorFile=:empfe/demo/empfe.sectors

to

    SectorFile=:empfe/empfe.sectors


    Of course, you must also edit the icon tooltypes for the other settings
to reflect your country name, size of the world, etc. as described in the
Empfe manual.
