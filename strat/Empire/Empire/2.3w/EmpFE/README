Empfe is an intuition based terminal program written for Amiga Empire.
If you are not familiar with Amiga Empire, you should read the doc file
for it. It may be distributed with this package or you may find it on
Fish disk #329 and Fish disk #118.
This version should work with all Amiga Empire versions released by
Chris Gray and those updated by David Wright.

If you are familiar with Empfe before, please consult the file
Empfe.changes for fixed bugs and new features. You may also want to
take a look into Empfe.doc.

Please read the dokumentation file (Empfe.doc). If you just want to check
Empfe out without reading the dokumentationfile, try:

    copy libs/arp.library LIBS:   ; if you aren't running ARP on your Amiga
    Empfe -iEmpfe.init -dEmpfe.sectors


This program works with kickstart 1.2, 1.3 and >2.02.
This program WILL fail on all 2.0 kickstart released before 16 january
1991. 
There is a TitleKludge flag in Empfe that will get around the some of the 
problems. Refer to the changes file for more information about it.
