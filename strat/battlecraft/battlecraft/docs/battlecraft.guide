         * NON-OFFICIAL RELEASE - many features do NOT work yet *


Warcraft II players should know this after running the program. It's Warcraft
clone (a god-game, like populous). Besides this game, an editor and CD player
are also released.


* IMPORTANT *

This version of the game enables you to cheat by displaying the complete map.
To do this you have to select the "god"-button. This is the left button under
the minimap (there are four buttons). The right button will stop the game and
return to the menu.

Note : units can now be moved by selecting them and pressing the right
       mousebutton on their destination (just like War2).

Note2: To create a snapshot press F1. A file called "snapshot.iff" will be
       created and placed in the battlecraft directory.

@{i}Installing the game@{ui}

The archive decompresses into its own drawer. Just copy or move the
drawer and its icon into whatever directory you want to keep it in. Sorry,
there's no install script yet, you really don't need one anyway.


@{i}Installing extra maps@{ui}

When you've got a new map you can install it by putting it into the maps
directory. The program will know if it's there. No more is needed to use
these extra maps. Just run the game, choose your new map and have fun.


@{i}Installing keyfile@{ui}

To install the keyfile, copy it into the battlecraft directory. From then
on you'll be able to use external maps and make savegames.

Q: Why does my compter crash after pressing the start button?

A1: You dont have enough memory (about 3-4MB required)

    copy the library (in the BC archive) into LIBS:


Q: How come <not implemented feature> isn't working?

Although I have got a lot of ideas to improve the game, it would be nice
if you, the user, would let me know what features you would like to see in
the next version of Battlecraft. The amount of requests will determine what
will be implemented first.

As you can imagine there are a lot of possibilities to improve the game.
Why not send @{" me " Link Author} your own ideas.

I spent a lot of work and 6 months of programming in Battlecraft so I think
it's only fair to demand a little reward if you, the user, want to use my
program on a regular basis.
