Overview
========

   This is a mythical strategy game for up to eight human and/or
computer players. It is a game of justice and vengeance, of good versus
evil, of life versus death, of light versus shadow, as a group of
wizards battle ferociously to exterminate their opponents and achieve
world domination.

   If you dare to compete, you will be faced with beasts of all
descriptions, from everyday animals like horses and lions; to monsters
of hideous proportions, from fire-breathing multi-headed pyrohydras to
extremely dangerous dragons that sail through the air hunting their
favorite food -- you. Creatures from the spirit world are also in
abundance; you may even meet the devil himself. Say your prayers if you
do.

   You will experience the most cataclysmic natural disasters ever to
occur in the course of human history. You may be drowned in swift-moving
floodwaters, burned beyond recognition in raging uncontrolled
hellfires, or be swallowed up by the very Earth itself in horrific
earthquakes.

   With your own eyes you will witness corpses rising from the dead to
rejoin the battle. You will be struck with terror as your army succumbs
to massive piles of green slime and purple fungi. Even the humble tree
is not always what it seems.

   Your army is not restricted to man alone. Your forces will be filled
out with orcs, elves, ogres, and a host of other races. You will
doubtless send many of these creatures to a premature death as they
blindly follow your every command. Only those wizards who use the
strategy of a Perfect General, possess the bloodlust of a Warlord, make
effective use of their Hired Guns and have the zeal to build an Empire
will triumph in the end.

   You will utilize and be subjected to some of the most powerful magic,
sorcery, and necromancy known to the human mind. You may be cursed,
drained, and infected with disease. You may disappear into the ethereal
plane or vanish into a timewarp. You will twist time, garble gravity,
and rip holes in space as you criminally violate all the laws of
physics with the unbridled arrogance of the dictatorial tyrant you
really are.

   You will cause untold destruction of a once pristine environment as
you destroy entire forests on a whim, saturate the air with
foul-smelling toxic fumes and unleash the apocalyptic fury of nuclear
devastation on all who oppose you.

   The grapes of wrath never tasted so good.

   To survive, you must strike a fine balance between defending your
wizard and attacking the other wizards. Only one wizard can rule the
world, but it can be a long time in coming, with up to eight wizards
chasing the same goal. Furthermore, the wizards may lose control of
their powerful magic and suffer the dreaded fate of mutual
annihilation; forever cleansing the world of disruptive magic!

System requirements
===================

   Total Chaos AGA requires a 68020 processor or better and OS 3.0 or
higher, and the AGA screen modes.

   Total Chaos requires 2 megs of chipram and 16 megs of fastram.

   It will only actually use about 1 meg of chipram and 11 megs of
fastram so you can still multitask.

Installation
============

   Just toss it on your hard drive somewhere.

   You do not need to copy any files to LIBS: or FONTS: or anywhere
else.

   You do not need to edit your startup-sequence.

   You do not need to make any ASSIGNs.

   There are no other files that you have to mess with.

   You do not need to run any install scripts or answer any complicated
questions.

   All Amiga software should be this easy to install, don't you agree?

   WARNING! The very first time you run the game, the game must
decompress 1000 audio files.  This will take several minutes but is
only done the very first time you play the game.  We apologize for the
delay but this allows us to reduce the size of the lha archive by 7.5
megs in v5.20.

   We recommend that you reset your computer before running the game the
first time.  This will defrag your ram and guarantee a perfect startup
with no problems.

   If you don't reset first then you may have 256 megs of ram, which is
more than enough, but due to all the software you have been running all
day, your ram may be fragmented into 1000s of small chunks, which might
stop the game from running.

   Let's go kill some Ogres now. :)

The game
********

   It should be unnecessary to read all the instructions to play the
game. For those who are itching to start skip to the Game Startup
section(see @{"GameStartup" Link "GameStartup"}.) to see how to load the game and then just
follow your nose. For the rest of you, the following describes how the
game is played.

   Each player (human or computer controlled) starts the game with a
wizard and a randomly generated repertoire of spells. The idea is to be
the last wizard alive and to amass the greatest score. Once your wizard
is killed you are out of the game, so protecting your wizard is vital
to your survival. The options available at the start of the game allow
for a wide range of scenarios.

   A game is organized as a series of rounds. Each round consists of
several stages, and each living wizard may partake in each stage of
each round. The major stages are: spell selection, spell casting, and
movement. Each stage is described in detail below. As well as these
main stages there are also a number of auxiliary stages performed
solely by the computer.

   The game can be played almost entirely with the mouse and is icon
driven.  All the entities in the game have animated graphical
representations. A text region at the bottom of the screen is used to
display other information. Initially, you may be perplexed by the wide
range of spells available but after a few games you should become
comfortable.

   The world once was comprised of a 7000 mile diameter sphere covered
with beautiful vegetation, crystal clear water and wonderful wildlife.
But that was before the 1000 year wizard war of Irvine vs. Conwell; the
culmination of which resulted in the destruction of most of the prime
material plane of existence.(1) All that is left is a flat rectangular
board of square cells, measuring 17 across by 14 down.

   The game is played on this rectangular board of square cells. You
move your pieces around the board using the mouse. The cost of a move
depends on the distance between the initial cell and the final cell. It
costs more to move diagonally than it does to go vertically or
horizontally.

   It is important to understand there is a distinction between the
gaming environment supplied by the computer and the computer controlled
entities.  When a computer player moves it does not get access to any
information that you cannot get. In fact, the computer bases it moves
on less information than a human player.

How to win
==========

   You have to:

   @{b}*@{ub} Kill all enemy wizards,

   @{b}*@{ub} kill or block all enemy generators,

   @{b}*@{ub} kill all enemy creatures that are still roaming around.

   A generator needs an empty space on which to generate creatures
onto. So if you can block all the spaces surrounding a generator, then
it cannot generate anything.  Corpses don't block a generator.
Generators are quite happy to generate monsters on top of dead corpses.
It gives them something to snack on. ;)

Game startup
============

   The game can be started from the Workbench or from the command line.
Some of the options can only be controlled from the command line. The
usual way of starting from the command line is to enter the command
@{b}chaos@{ub} when in the directory containing the chaos files. There is an
icon for starting from the Workbench. Installation is discussed in
Section Installation (see @{"Installation" Link "Installation"}). You should ensure Chaos has a
stack of at least 50000 bytes. From the command line this can be done
by typing @{b}stack 50000@{ub} before starting chaos.

   These instructions are accurate for 5.0 of the game.  However, Total
Chaos is a rapidly evolving program and new features are continually
being added and some instructions may become obsolete or inaccurate in
the future. Only registered users are guaranteed of being informed
about new releases.

   After passing the introductory screens you will arrive at the first
setup screen. This screen allows you to select which wizards will be
playing, whether or not they will be computer controlled, the teams,
and their names. By default it starts with two human controlled wizards
on different teams. The @{b}T@{ub} column is used for team selection. The icons
appearing in this column represent a team. By clicking on them they
move on to the next team in the sequence. If two wizards are showing
the same icon this means they will start on the same team. There also
exist spells which can alter the teams during the course of a game.

   Once you are satisfied with the setup click on @{b}Start@{ub} which will take
you to the second initialization screen. On this screen you can select
the number of generators (default 4, maximum 99), number of spells
(default 20, maximum 99), and level of computer wizards (maximum 9).

   The wizard level influences only the allocation of spells to computer
players and does not influence the way the computer moves or casts
spells.  Any wizard can improve their level rating by casting Level
spells during the game. Doing so increases the chances of getting
useful, rare and powerful bonus spells.

   You should decide how many turns the game should last for. The
default action is forever which means the game continues until all
human players have been killed or one human player remains and all
computer players are dead. Alternatively, any number up to 999 can be
specified. The number of turns remaining is displayed at the top right
of the screen as a series of tally marks. If these are shown in yellow
then you are into the last few turns.

   You can also turn @{b}Texas Trash'em@{ub} on or off. Texas Trash'em allows
you to optionally trash (discard) one of your spells in addition to
casting a spell each turn. This allows you to discard spells you don't
like or don't want. In version 1.8 and below, computer players do not
discard spells. In version 1.9 and up you MUST discard a spell each
turn but casting a spell is optional (unless there are 5 spells or less
left in your spell list in which case you don't have to discard if you
don't want to.)

   By default the game will operate in @{b}Classic@{ub} mode. In this mode only
a limited number of spells are available. This mode is particularly
suited to neophytes. If you switch off this mode then the full
repertoire of spells is made available and Total Chaos will run rampant.

   You may also select the number of artifacts that will be randomly
placed on the board. Allowable settings are 0 to 99.

   Artifacts are like a regular creature object except it belongs to
@{b}NOBODY@{ub} until someone moves adjacent to it.

   An Artifact's owner is determined at the beginning of each movement
phase.  It is determined according to who has the most creatures
adjacent to it. In the event that 2 or more players have an equal
number of creatures adjacent to it then it remains @{b}NOBODY@{ub}'s.

   Inanimate objects and other artifacts do @{i}NOT@{ui} assist in controlling
artifacts.

   Currently there are only 4 artifacts:

   @{b}*@{ub} Bolter Wall Artifacts

   @{b}*@{ub} Dalek Artifacts

   @{b}*@{ub} Robot Artifacts

   @{b}*@{ub} Stone Golem Artifacts

   Artifacts have 0 movement points.

   Most magic spells can be cast on Artifacts so you can heal an
Artifact or increase its capabilities, etc.

   If you play Total Chaos against human opponents who hide in a corner,
cowering in fear, then try playing the game with some artifacts. The
sight of a nice, big, powerful artifact just sitting there waiting for
someone to claim it can be a strong incentive for them to charge out
after it and has been known to spark intense power struggles.

   @{b}Hidden Artifacts@{ub}: If this is turned on then artifacts will be buried
underneath walls, trees, rocks and other inanimate objects. These
objects will have to be destroyed in order to take posession of the
artifact underneath.

   You can also select the number of scrolls that will appear on the
board.  Allowable settings are 0 to 99. A scroll is a spell lying on
the board which is free for the taking. Isn't that cool? Scrolls are
magically inscribed on extremely delicate, dry, brittle, paper. They
are therefore excessively fragile and even the tiniest amount of damage
will destroy them. The scroll rules should be set to one of the
following:

  1. Scrolls can be picked up by anybody.

  2. Scrolls can be picked up by wizards only.

  3. Scrolls can be picked up by anybody except flying creatures.

   Inanimate objects can never pick up scrolls.

   There are normally only 3 ways to affect scrolls:

   @{b}*@{ub} By entering a cell that contains a scroll and surviving there
     until the end of the complete round. The complete round means
     until everyone has finished their turn for this round, including
     all wizards and independents. If you survive in a cell containing
     a scroll until the end of the round then the scroll is magically
     added to your commanding Wizard's spell list.

   @{b}*@{ub} Destroy them by shooting them.

   @{b}*@{ub} Destroy them by Burying them with the Bury spell.

   @{i}Caution:@{ui} shooting the scrolls of Undead Elementals may produce
Ungood side effects. }8>

   If you play Chaos against human players who just sit in a corner and
avoid conflicts with each other then try playing the game with some
scrolls laying around. This can draw them out of their corner and start
up some fierce battles!

   @{b}Scroll Delay@{ub}: Allowable settings are 0 to 6.  This controls how many
consecutive turns you must control the cell before you are awarded the
scroll. 0 means you will acquire it at the end of @{i}this@{ui} round. 1 means
you will acquire it at the end of the @{i}next@{ui} round and so forth.

   If at the end of a round, you no longer control the cell then you
must start over again so if @{b}Scroll Delay@{ub} is 6 and you lose control of
the cell after only 5 turns then you must regain control for 6
consecutive turns to obtain the scroll.

   You are permitted to move creatures into and out of the cell
containing the scroll without any penalty so long as you control the
cell with a scroll-capable creature at the end of the round.

   @{b}Hidden Scrolls@{ub}: If this is turned on then scrolls will be buried
underneath walls, trees, rocks and other inanimate objects. These
objects will have to be destoryed in order to take posession of the
scroll underneath.

   @{b}Agent Casting@{ub}: An Agent is something which is capable of casting its
own magic spells on its own accord.  Some examples of agents are the
Agathion, Azer, Cat Lord, Chronomancer, Dao, Fake Wizard, Faun,
Inanimatologist, Inanimage, Jann, Marid, Mullac de Irvine and
Necromancer.  When agent casting is turned on, these creatures will be
able to cast their spells.  When agent casting is turned off, these
creatures will never cast any spells.

   Turning this option on makes the game wildly unpredictable.

   @{b}Impurities@{ub} If impurities are turned on then
   @{b}*@{ub} Sometimes creatures will randomly change their allegiance.

   @{b}*@{ub} Sometimes things will randomly disappear into another dimension.
     (They will randomly reappear later.)

   @{b}*@{ub} With every attack made there is approximately 1 chance in 400 that
     the attacker will really kick some ass!  In such a circumstance
     the attacker will whack his opponent with an incredibly amazing 50
     points of damage!  Furthermore, the awesomeness of this attack
     cannot be mitigated by a cloak!  The attacker goes around the
     cloak, hits the most vulnerable part of his enemy and sadisticly
     inflicts massive damage!

   @{b}Exploration Mode@{ub}: When exploration mode is on you cannot see cells
which you have not explored. Once you have explored a cell it stays
permanently explored, there is no need to maintain line-of-sight to the
cell. This makes the gameplay nice and simple, the way I like it.

   Most creatures simply explore the cell they are in and all adjacent
cells.

   Some creatures, like Eagles, explore further and can see behind
walls due to flying high in the air.

   Other creatures, like snakes, can "feel" the movements of other
creatures at far distances, thus allowing them to map cells which are
hidden behind walls that cannot be seen by normal creatures.

   Certain other creatures can hear or smell other creatures at a
greater distance than they can see.

   This adds the "Explore-the-Map" play mechanic to the game. You can't
see any cells until you have sent a unit to map them. Once mapped the
cell remains visible forever even if you have no nearby units or no
line-of-sight.

   You can also see the cells that your allies can see. But if they
stop being your ally then you can no longer see those cells.

   You'll need to explore the level and map it out.

   Having @{b}Exploration Mode@{ub} turned ON makes the game MUCH harder since
you have no idea what direction you should be going in the early stages
of the game. Nor do you have any idea what direction you will be
attacked from at first.

   @{b}Ruthlessness Mode@{ub}: This AI option causes the computer players to
become ruthless in their combat tactics.  They won't cheat, but they
will fight in a more intelligent manner.

   When Ruthlessness mode is activated computer players will:
   @{b}*@{ub} Cast pits, magic glass, walls, rocks and miner willy more
     intelligently and aggressively.

   @{b}*@{ub} If they are an arborist they will cast shadow wood and dark wood
     trees in a more aggressive and intelligent manner.

   @{b}*@{ub} Whenever a creature is engaged it will always attack the strongest
     creature that it can acutally kill.  If it cannot make a kill then
     it will attack whichever enemy it feels is the most dangerous.

   @{b}*@{ub} A shooting creature will always attempt to shoot the strongest
     creature that it can actually kill.  If it cannot make a kill then
     it will shoot whatever enemy it feels is the most dangerous.  They
     never try to shoot a wizard who is invulnerable or has a reflector.

   @{b}*@{ub} A nonengaged ground creature will always check first if there is a
     path to any enemy wizard that it can kill.  If it cannot kill any
     enemy wizard then it will check if there is a path to any
     favorite-food creature that it can kill.  If it cannot kill its
     favorite food then it will check if there is a path to any
     bonus-spell creature that it can kill.  If it can find a path to
     one of those things then it will charge after it and kill it!

   @{b}Aggressiveness Mode@{ub}: This AI option will cause creatures which
cannot make a kill or a good attack to move toward the nearest enemy,
even if they have to navigate a complicated maze to do so.  With this
option OFF computer players will try to "crunch through the walls" of
DungeonWars mode in a straight line instead of going around to attack
you immediatlely.

   The @{b}Aggressiveness@{ub} option requires that @{b}Ruthlessness@{ub} be activated.

   @{b}Kill the Humans Mode@{ub}: This AI option makes the computer players
realize that human players are far more dangerous, evil and
untrustworthy than computer players.  Computer players will therefore
place a higher priority on attacking and killing things owned by a
human player.

   The Kill the Humans option requires that both @{b}Ruthlessness@{ub} and
@{b}Aggressiveness@{ub} be activated.

   @{b}Dungeon Wars Mode@{ub}: This option will cause the game to randomly
generate a dungeon for you to fight in.  Strangely, there is no roof
over the dungeon. :)  Its more like a maze and flying creatures can
easily fly over the walls.

   @{b}Blood@{ub}: This option will activate damagable creature gfx.  Damaged
creatures will lose limbs and bleed in accordance with the severity of
their wounds.  The Blood option also has the effect of enabling
creature powerup gfx so that creatures who are hit by a fly spell
actually sprout wings.  However all these graphical effects ONLY happen
to creatures who have had their gfx designed for this.  As of March 22,
2002 only the Lion, Leopard and Elephant have been designed in this
way.  Feel free to examine these creatures and then make the blood and
powerup fx gfx for any other creatures of your choosing.

   When you have made any desired changes, click on @{b}Start@{ub} to begin the
game.

Troubleshooting
===============

   Game reports a file is missing or "Problem with IFF file" or "Can't
open xxx file":

   First of all, you can't install Total Chaos: Battle at the Frontier
of Time on top of an old Total Chaos installation.  It just won't work
for many reasons, sorry about that. :)  Just unarchive the
TotalChaosAGA.lha file into a freshly made virgin directory and
everything will work great.

   Secondly, you absolutely positively CANNOT use lha v2.1!!!!!!!!  lha
v2.1 is totally and completely bugged out!  Delete it immediately!  It
will usually only unarchive around 1000 files out of a 3700 file
archive!  How can you expect to play the game if 2700 of its files are
missing?  Have you deleted lha v2.1 from EVERYWHERE off of your hard
drive?  No?  Stop reading this until you have deleted it.  Go on.  I'll
wait.

   If you get to this part you either were smart enough not to use lha
v2.1 or you have now deleted it. *Whew*, your system is now much more
stable.  Don't you feel better now? :)

   I strongly recommend you to only use lha v1.x.  There are known bugs
in lha v2.2.  v2.2 may or may not unarchive the file correctly.  It
probably will but it might not.  You are 100% guaranteed to succeed if
you use lha v1.x

   Total Chaos has been extensively and continuously tested by many
experienced and some not so experienced :) Amiga users for nearly a
year.  It should provide you with thousands of hours of good clean
monster mashing fun. :)

   Should Total Chaos fail to load it is most likely a simple case of
not enough memory.  Make sure that you have at least 11 megs of free
fastram and at least 512k of free chipram.  If you've got enough ram
but the game won't load then its probably because your memory is
fragmented.  Go to shell and type Avail

   If your largest chunk of fastram is under 5.5 megs then Total Chaos
v4.x just isn't going to be able to load.

   If your largest chunk of chipram is under 400k then the game won't be
able to load either.

   MUI software, like YAM - and especially web browsers - just love to
thrash your memory and fragment it into many small pieces.  Luckily for
you this very easy to fix! :)  Just reset your Amiga and your memory
will be returned to a pristine, fast and unfragmented state.

   Have no fear, Total Chaos does not use MUI.

   Total Chaos only uses AmigaOS.  Total Chaos does not use MUI OS, P96
OS, CyberGraphX OS, Linux OS, Mac OS, Palm OS, Bill Gates OS nor any
other OS that you can think of.

   Why are the sounds out of Sync?

   If you have a problem where the sound fx keep stopping the game, at
first just for a second then later for a few seconds and by the 10th
turn the sounds have a 30-100 second delay on them making them 100x
slower than an old unexpanded 1985  7Mhz Amiga then you are obviously
using UAE and you need to get a real computer.

   MagicMenu users read this!  1. Do not use MagicMenu v2.33 or 2.34.
They are bugged to hell and back.  2. The default settings of MagicMenu
v2.33 and 2.34 change the TotalChaos menus, screw them up and make them
look utterly horrible.  3. Other versions of MagicMenu probably have
the same problem but I don't have time to test any more.

   If your menus are all messed up looking you can A: Try MagicMenu
v2.35 B: Change the MagicMenuPrefs to use "Standard Look" menus and
popup menus.  This works for me.  C: Don't use MagicMenu.

   The choice is yours.

   MCP users read this!  If you have strange blue boxes around your
inactive menu items in the "Controls" menu of TotalChaosAGA this is
caused by an illegal (and very rude) hack in MCP called "Force NewLook
Menus".  Go to MCP and turn this off or die.  The "Force NewLook Menus"
hacks into AmigaOS and intercepts my orders to Intuition(tm) and
replaces them with wrong buggy orders.

   CyberGraphX and Picasso96 (CGX and P96) users read this!  All cgx
and P96 users report some bugs in cgx and P96 that can cause some minor
or very serious problems.

   Bug #1: If cgx or P96 is active in your system and workbench is
displayed on a cgx or P96 screen then the title screen will be trashed
(possibly other screens also).

   Bug #2: Some cgx and P96 users report a random lockup bug that
happens when switching screens to/from TotalChaosAGA screen to/from
Workbench on cgx/P96 screen.  Hopefully this bug in P96/cgx will not
affect you, but if it does then read the solutions below.

   SOLUTIONS to work around the above bugs: Solution 1.  Make your
workbench open on an AGA screen before running the game.  This will
magically make the bugs in CyberGraphX and Picasso96 go away.

   Solution 2.  Delete all your P96 and cgx drivers from DEVS:Monitors/
and reboot.  Be sure to keep copies of your drivers somewhere else.  I
keep mine in "DEVS:Copy_of_Monitors/".  By deleting the drivers and
rebooting you are preventing cgx and P96 from hacking into the OS and
installing bugs into it.

   Mutliple people have tested both workarounds and report them to work
100%

   If you are a CyberGraphX user you must also make sure your
configuration is correct: (courtesy of Piru) 1. 56KHZAUDIO must be OFF
2. KEEPAMIGAVIDEO must be ON 3. MCP hack "Force Chip -> Fast" must be
OFF 4. Do not try to hijack the screens of Total Chaos and force them
to do things.  You will fail.

   P96 OS and CyberGraphX OS are not 100% compatible to AmigaOS
therefore you cannot force Total Chaos to run on a P96 or CyberGraphX
screen.  You'll have to use a real AGA screen.

   Why is the game so slow?

   Stop using UAE and get a real computer.  A real Amiga is much much
faster than UAE unless you have a 256 Ghz P9 with 0ns ram, then if you
are lucky, you might be able to run as fast as a real Amiga.

   Why is the bottom row of the board 2/3 covered up by the text area?
Is this a bug?

   Its covered up because you are using a buggy piece of trash called
"UAE".  Get a real computer.  Real Amigas display graphics correctly.

   Yes, it is a bug in UAE.

   It has been reported that some versions of UAE do not have this bug.

   Why is there excessive popping, crackling and dropouts in the speech?

   Because you are attempting to emulate an Amiga megacomputer on a lame
litte Pentium with UAE.  I used 2 versions of UAE, one version has this
bug all the time.  The other version has this bug replaced by new &
improved, more terrifying audio bugs. (As tested on Athlon 650Mhz +
SoundBlaster Live + GeForce gfx card + 256k L2 Cache + 256 Megs of RAM)
You can save yourself a lot of grief by using a real computer.

Spell selection
===============

   For each human wizard in turn, the right of the screen is filled
with the currently available spells for that wizard. Information can be
obtained about the spells by reading about the spells in this manual or
by selecting the @{b}?@{ub} gadget and then clicking on the spell you wish to
know about.  Or simply by pointing the mouse at the spell in question
and then pressing the @{b}q@{ub} or @{b}?@{ub} key on the keyboard.  Pressing the middle
mouse button does the same thing.

   A wizard can decide not to choose a spell by clicking the end turn
gadget at the lower right of the screen, or the escape key, whence
control will pass to the next wizard.

   Assuming you wish to pick a spell, simply click on the desired spell.
During the casting stage you will attempt to use your selected spell.
Care should be taken in spell selection. Consider such things as the
range of the spell, the situation of the wizard, your position on the
board, and whether line of sight is required for the spell. Just press
@{b}c@{ub} (for Casting possibilities) while the mouse is over a spell and
all the possible places that you could cast that spell will be
highlighted on the board.

   Once selected, a spell must be attempted. If the spell is aborted,
it will still be considered used and will not appear on your spell list
in the next round.

   If @{b}Texas Trash'em@{ub} was selected then you will also be required to
select a spell to be discarded (unless you have less than six spells
remaining). Such a selection must be made even if you choose not to
select a spell for casting.

Spell casting
=============

   During spell casting, each player who selected a spell during the
spell selection stage will in turn get a chance to actuate the spell.
Computer controlled wizards will attempt to cast a spell at their
position in the sequence. In addition, each generator on the screen
might produce a creature. Certain other creatures also occasionally
cast spells.

   For each player in turn the spell selected is shown on the bottom
line of the screen, together with the number of attempts and the range
for the spell. For example,

     Gray Elf x1  Range=2

   means 1 Gray Elf is being cast, and the elf can be cast either
immediately adjacent to the wizard or one cell removed from the wizard
(just press @{b}c@{ub} to see all possible legal cells). A range of zero means
the spell can be cast simply by pressing the left mouse button and
there is no need to select a cell. Such spells are often special powers
for the wizard. The computer automatically applies the spell to the
correct wizard or creature.  Certain spells have a range of 15, these
spells can be cast on any appropriate cell on the screen and do not
require line of sight.

   Most spells have a fixed range, measured in a straight line from the
casting wizard. For instance, nearly all creatures have a range of one
and so can only be cast immediately adjacent to the wizard. All these
spells require line of sight. The line of sight is measured from the
centre of the wizard's cell to the centre of the destination cell. You
can see over blank space, dead creatures, pits, pools, and fires.
Sometimes line of sight can be obtained by waiting until an appropriate
time in the animation sequence.(1) By pressing @{b}c@{ub} (Cast) you can ask the
computer to show you all legal target cells.

   Spells can be aborted by pressing the right mouse button or backspace
key.  Aborted spells still get used up, so try to avoid having to abort
spells.  If you find yourself aborting spells often, you are probably
not choosing spells appropriate to your situation.

   Most spells can be cast only on certain types of cell (the program
will notify you of any errors you make in selecting the cell). If you
make an error you are free to choose a new cell. For instance,
creatures can be cast on empty cells or cells containing dead
creatures, but cannot be cast on other creatures or inanimate objects.

   After each wizard has cast, the generators may produce creatures on
any cell adjacent to the generator which is empty, or contains a dead
creature.  Adjacent cells occupied by creatures or inanimate objects
will never be generated upon.

Board update
============

   The board update is handled entirely by the computer. The update
carries out activities which are not directly under any player's
control. During the update any or all of the following things might
happen:

   @{b}*@{ub} The growths (earthquakes, fire, flood, fungi, orange jelly, gooey
     blob, and green ooze) are permitted to grow. Each cell containing
     a growth may or may not grow. If a cell is going to grow it will
     do so in only one direction in any particular turn. The direction
     of growth is chosen at random.  Earthquakes cannot "grow"
     diagonally. Some of the growths grow faster than others, orange
     jelly is particularly voracious while floods tend to be sluggish.
     If a cell doesn't grow it might dissipate instead. You may have
     some of your creatures buried, killed, or revealed in this growth
     process.  Should your wizard be buried or killed you are
     considered dead and your game ends (an exception occurs in the
     case of a wizard having previously cast Lich Lord).

     Any creature which is covered by a growth will have its life set
     to one half of its normal maximum upon being uncovered. If the
     growth is killed somehow, such as you shooting it with a bow, then
     all the other stats are left untouched.  But if the growth has
     died of natural causes then @{i}all@{ui} the creature's stats will be set
     to their normal intial values, though life will still be cut in
     half. These effects can be exploited by clever players.

     Neither case applies to dead bodies, scrolls or artifact
     creatures. Thus you cannot morph an artifact creature into a non
     artifact creature by letting it get covered up with a growth.

   @{b}*@{ub} Any tempests on the board may move. A creature in the path of the
     tempest will be thrown to a new random location. On very rare
     occasions a creature will be killed as a result of the throw.

   @{b}*@{ub} Any vortices may move. A creature in its path will disappear into
     the future.

   @{b}*@{ub} Ropers get tired of constantly sitting in the same place.
     Sometimes they decide to teleport to a new location.

   @{b}*@{ub} There is a chance that each magic castle, dark citadel or dark
     city on the board might collapse. If a wizard is inside the castle
     or citadel when the collapse occurs the wizard will be granted a
     bonus spell.

   @{b}*@{ub} Any magic wood occupied by a wizard might collapse, resulting in a
     new spell for the wizard.

   @{b}*@{ub} Each sleeping entity is examined and has a chance of dying or
     collapsing.  The weaker things are the more likely they are to be
     destroyed than the stronger things. The destruction will be
     complete and no trace of the entity will remain.

   @{b}*@{ub} Each Haunt has a small chance of changing sides.

   @{b}*@{ub} Each Spriggan has a small chance of falling asleep.

   @{b}*@{ub} (When impurities are turned on) With a small probability an object
     might decide to change sides. This may work to your advantage or
     disadvantage. It is even possible that a generator will become
     your friend and decide to emit creatures for you.

Movement
========

   The movement stage is the most complex stage, since normally there
are a large number of creatures to be moved and each creature has a
number of possible moves. Each player is given a chance to move in turn
(unless he is the victim of a Freeze spell). The strategies employed
during the movement stage will have the greatest effect on your
survival in the game. Movement involves not only the shifting of
creature positions but also combat.

   Dead creatures, sleeping creatures, and growths cannot be moved. No
inanimates can be moved, although shadow wood trees and bolters may be
used to attack enemy creatures(1) in adjacent cells. Special objects
like ropers, wasp nests or solars are controlled by the computer.

   A player is able to move each creation once in each turn. To end
your turn click on the end turn gadget (or press the escape key) and
control will pass to the next player.  Players having cast the Move It
spell in the current round will get a second chance to move after all
other players have moved, but before the independents move.

   A creature is said to be @{i}engaged@{ui} if it is adjacent to an enemy
creature and is unable to retreat. Engaged creatures cannot be moved but
may still be able to fight. How likely a creature is to be engaged is
dependent on its manoeuvrability and the number of adjacent hostile
creatures.

   To move a creature simply click on the creature using the left mouse
button. Normally, the distance the creature may be moved will be
displayed in the text bar. Depending on the creature, it will be flying
movement or walking movement. There is a special cursor when flying
movement is active.  To see all legal moves press the @{b}m@{ub} (Move) key.

Flying movement
---------------

   For flying creatures you can pick any cell within the given range
except cells occupied by your team's creations. If the cell is empty or
contains a dead creature then the creature will move to the selected
cell, otherwise an aerial attack will be made on the selected cell.

   The Fly spell is able to provide any creature with wings, however its
movement points won't be altered. The Wizard wings spell gives the
wizard the ability to fly in the range of an eagle.

   Flying movement can be temporarily impossible in the world if the
gravity sphere has been cast, or permanently for a creature if it is
the victim of a singular or dual earthbind spell.

Aerial attacks
--------------

   An aerial attack results when a flying creature is moved onto a cell

moved into the cell.

   A ground based creature can only move one cell at a time and you
must show the computer exactly how to move multiple cells by clicking
in each cell in turn. Many walking creatures can only move one cell
anyway. For those which can move more than one cell you should select a
sequence of adjacent cells -- you can abort the move at any time by
pressing the right mouse button or backspace key.  During the course of
a move a creature may become engaged in which case it will move no
further.

Combat
------

   Engaged creatures can take part in combat. You cannot attack your
team's creatures (but see @{"RangedCombat" Link "RangedCombat"}), unless the creature currently
moving has a negative combat ability, meaning the attack will actually
heal.  Living creatures cannot (normally) attack undead creatures,
otherwise anything goes. Once engaged, an attack is induced by clicking
on the cell containing the creature you wish to attack. If successful,
the defendant will be killed and the attacker will move onto the
corpse. For a successful kill of a strong opponent you may be awarded a
bonus spell.

   It is possible to attack inanimate objects and growths, although you
cannot get engaged to them. Be wary of killing growths with buried
creatures beneath, as the buried creature will be revealed and will
probably be quite hungry.

Ranged combat
-------------

   Some creatures such as elves, dragons, and wizards carrying bows,
have additional attacks. Such an attack is indicated by the @{i}sights
pointer@{ui}. Line of sight is required for most of these weapons. It is
possible to shoot your own creations or creations of your team members,
so choose your targets carefully. Occasionally it might be desirable to
kill one your own creatures due to insanity or disease (especially if
you are playing for points).

   Creatures which posess the @{i}archery@{ui} skill (such as the Wood Elf and
Gray Elf) do not need line of sight to shoot a target. Their shots
simply arch over any intervening obstacles. The Archery spell can give
the archery skill to creatures with some ranged combat ability, while
the Archerotomy will remove this skill.

Wizard movement
---------------

   Under normal circumstances the wizard can be moved like any other
creature.  However, wizards are capable of special movements. Wizards
can climb magic trees, enter castles, and ride certain creatures. For
convenience these activities are collectively called @{i}mounting@{ui}. You
cannot mount if you are engaged, otherwise mounting is effected by
simply moving the wizard onto the cell occupied by the entity you wish
to mount.

   Dismounting is somewhat more complicated as the computer needs to
distinguish which of the two entities is to be moved. For trees and
castles the computer will assume the wizard. For ridden creatures the
default is the creature. To dismount from a creature the following
sequence should occur:

   @{b}*@{ub} Select the creature the wizard is riding.

   @{b}*@{ub} Click on the `D' gadget at the top right of the screen.

   @{b}*@{ub} Move the wizard to a cell adjacent to the creature (wizards with
     high movement allowance or wings still only move one cell when
     dismounting).

   Mounting is generally a good idea, as it hides the wizard from view
and gives the wizard additional protection.

Ending your turn
----------------

   Once you have moved all creatures that you wish to, select the end

at the appropriate point in the sequence. After all wizards have moved
the independent creatures will be moved by the computer according to
the same rules.

   Finally, any wasp nests, ropers, fungi and anything else that has the
Special Combat Attribute will attack adjacent opponents.

   Note that some objects such as Pools, Apple Wood Trees, Hippocrates
and others have @{i}negative@{ui} special combat. This means their Special Combat
actually heals those that it attacks.

   The round is now effectively over and the game returns to the spell

are mountable set 1 can be directly ridden by the wizard.  They range
from the Horse and Pegasus to the Magic Wood and the Shadow City.
Objects which are mountable set 2 can only be ridden by the wizard
after he has cast the Ride spell, as mounting them requires more
training.  They include all dragons, the hardy Elephant, the swift Bird
Lord and even the fearsome Tyrannasaurus Rex.  The mountability
statistic can be affected by the Mount and No Mount spells.

Meditation
..........

   Some mountable objects provide a meditation place for the wizard.
When the wizard enters a meditation object, there is a chance on each
turn during board update that the object collapses. If this happens,
the wizard is granted a bonus spell. This is the case for some trees
and various types of castles, specifically: Magic Wood, Castle, Dark
Citadel, and Shadow City.

Action on line of sight
.......................

   Most objects in the game block line of sight for everybody, with
consequences on mapping the world, casting spells and ranged combat.
However, there exist certain objects which don't block line of sight at
all, like corpses or earthquakes.  This is determined by this statistic,
which can have another value indicating it blocks only enemies' line of
sight.  This usually involves some kind of magic, like the Magic Glass

living creatures cannot attack the undead but there are exceptions like
the Arctic Wolf and Iridium Horse.  Undeads can usually attack both the

   For an object capable of ranged combat, this statistic states if
line of sight is needed to shoot a target or not. All elves have this
archery skill. The Archery spell can provide it to a creature which

Life force
..........

   Life Force is also known as "hit points".  This very important
characteristic determines the resistance of the object to physical
damage by combat, ranged combat, special combat, magic and poison.  If
the life force of an object becomes negative the object dies.  Normally
if the life force becomes 0, the object dies.  However, death by poison
requires that the life force drop to below 0 before death occurs.  The
life force of a corpse begins at 0 and is lowered when a scavenger eats
some of it.  When a corpse's life force reaches the negative of its
normal maximum, it is considered consumed and disappears from play.  A
recovery rate from -7 to 7 is available on each turn:  auto-healing
capabilities (when positive) or poison (when negative).  The Armor
spell can be used to raise the life force of a creature, and it can be
lowered by numerous other means.  Other spells or forms of combat (like
the bite of the Giant Rat) affect the recovery ability.

Magical resistance
..................

   All creatures are not equal when it comes to magic. Some are very
vulnerable to magic spells whereas others (not necessarily those which
are physically resistant) can show a very strong aptitude to resist
magical attacks. Usually a creature dies when its magical resistance,
which normally ranges from 0 to 7, becomes negative.  Certain
ultra-powerful spells such as Justice, Dark Power and Exorcism kill the
creature if they lower the magic resistance to 0.

   A recover rate from -7 to 7 is possible. The magical resistance of a
particular creature can be raised by the magic shield spell, which can
also be used to improve the recovery rate for magical resistance. The
spells which attack the magical resistance are many, and there are also
creatures which attack it like the Juju Zombie.

Manoeuvrability
...............

   Ranging from 0 to 15 with a maximum recovery of 7, this
characteristic (also called agility) determines the probability that
the creature gets engaged at the beginning of its movement phase when
an enemy is adjacent.  Creatures whose manoeuvrability is 0 are always
engaged while those whose manoeuvrability is 15 are never engaged and
can always escape a battle.  All creatures immediately become engaged
upon moving next to any enemy creature, regardless of their agility
rating.  The Command spell can be used to raise the agility of all the
creations of the casting wizard.  The Spectator, Python and a few other
creatures attack this statistic.

Intelligence
............

   The intelligence or stupidity of a creature in Chaos is measured
from 0 (very stupid) to 15 (most intelligent), with a recovery rate
from -7 to 7.  When the intelligence of a creature becomes negative, it
dies as the synaptic damage prevents its brain from maintaining its own
vital functions.  Intelligence can be raised by the Brain Boost spell
or lowered with the Brain Drain spell, among others. This
characteristic also determines the probability of success of
Subversion-like spells on the creature.  Certain creatures, such as the
Mind Flayer, attack this statistic.

Combat
......

   One of the most important statistics, combat reflects the ability of
a particular creature to cause damage to other objects in the world.
Possible values range from -15 to 15 with a recovery rate from -7 to 7.
Each time the creature attacks another object, its combat statistic is
subtracted from the target statistics of the attacked creature.  If the
combat statistic is negative, this means that the attack will in fact
heal the targetted creature (which can be an ally or an enemy).
However, creatures with positive combat cannot attack their allies.
This prevents simple mistakes of accidentally clicking on a friendly
creature and wounding it.  A variety of characteristics can be altered
by combat.  Usually this will be the life force but, for example, the
Arctic Wolf attacks simultaneously the life force, manoeuvrability and
movement points.  The combat ability can be magically raised for
example by the Combat spell, destroyed with Demonic Touch, or the
target statistic changed by the Poison Dagger spell.

Ranged combat
.............

   Some creatures have the ability to shoot missiles, such as arrows or
fire breath (like Red Dragons). This is indicated by a positive (from 1
to 15) ranged combat ability, which will be subtracted from the target
statistics of the targetted creature. A negative ranged combat ability
means ranged healing. This statistic can be magically altered by the
Range Boost spell or the Range Drain Beam. However, there is no direct
way to produce a generic creature which has no initial ranged combat
ability with this capacity. The wizard, however, can make use of the
Magic Bow and protect himself with the Reflector spell. A recovery rate
from -7 to 7 is possible.

Special combat
..............

   This very special capability ranging from -15 to 15 is like combat
in that it attacks some characteristics of other creatures, but differs
in the way it is done. Special combat takes place after the movement
phase and possibly affects every surrounding object. It can also affect
allies as well as enemies, depending on the object possessing special
combat. Any creature can be given special combat through the Shocker
spell and there is almost no way to ever remove it. A recovery rate

points from the corpse it's standing on as its scavengerism statistic
and add them to its own life force. When the life force of the corpse
reaches the negative of its initial value, the corpse is fully consumed
and disappears.  Some creatures such as the Dire Wolf, Arctic Wolf,

highlighted then it shows the legal moves for the creature under the
mouse pointer. "Moving" includes "attacking" so often the cells of enemy
creatures will be highlighted (because it is legal for you to attempt to
move there) even though you perhaps don't have a snowball's chance in
hell of really killing the creature (e.g. orc vs. stone giant).

   Pressing @{b}r@{ub} for @{i}Range@{ui} shows all the cells that are within range of
the currently highlighted creature's ranged weapon or if no creature is
currently highlighted then it shows all cells that are in range of the
creature under the mouse pointer. @{i}Please note@{ui}: this shows all the cells
that are within range not all the cells that you can actually hit.
Many times the cells shown will be unshootable due to intervening
objects blocking line-of-sight or the fact that undeads cannot be shot
by living creatures.

   Pressing @{b}s@{ub} for @{i}Shoot@{ui} shows all the cells that can actually be shot
by the currently highlighted creature's ranged weapon or if no creature
is currently highlihgted then it shows all the cells that can actually
be shot by the creature under the mouse pointer. @{i}Please note@{ui}: this
takes into account line-of-sight and living/undead restrictions.

   Pressing @{b}l@{ub} for Line-of-Sight shows all the cells that can be seen by
the currently highlighted creature or if no creature is highlighted
then it shows all the cells that can be seen by the the cell under the
mouse pointer. This is particularly useful when you are thinking of
casting a spell that requires line-of-sight and you want to see if your
wizard can actually see the intended target. It is also good for
checking out where enemy wizards can/cannot see to so you can hide your
creatures behind walls and things to protect them from subversion,
betrayal, abduction, sleep, braindrain etc.

   Pressing @{b}f@{ub} for Feel shows all the squares that can be felt by the
currently highlighted creature or if no creature is highlighted then it
shows all the squares that can be felt by the creature under the mouse
pointer.

   Pressing @{b}h@{ub} for Hear shows all the squares that can be heard by the
currently highlighted creature or if no creature is highlighted then it
shows all the squares that can be heard by the creature under the mouse
pointer.

   Pressing @{b}o@{ub} for Olfactory (smell) shows all the squares that can be
smelled by the currently highlighted creature or if no creature is
highlighted then it shows all the squares that can be smelled by the
creature under the mouse pointer.

   Pressing @{b}y@{ub} (flY) shows all the squares that are directly in movement
range of the flying creature. It won't show squares that could be
reached by flying to maximum range, landing, getting engaged and
attacking an adjacent square that is 1 square further away.

   Pressing SHIFT in combination with @{b}m@{ub}, @{b}r@{ub}, @{b}s@{ub}, @{b}f@{ub}, @{b}h@{ub}, @{b}o@{ub} or @{b}l@{ub} will @{i}always@{ui}
show the relevant cells for the creature under the mouse pointer,
regardless of any currently highlighted creature.

   SHIFT @{b}m@{ub} always shows the @{i}full@{ui} movement range of the creature even if
that creature has already moved.

   @{b}RETURN@{ub} = Select creature under pointer.  Use like LMB.

   @{i}Cursor Keys@{ui} = Move pointer 1 square.

   @{i}Backspace@{ui} = End a creature's move.

   @{b}ESC@{ub} = End your turn (movement phase only).

   For crazy people who don't like mouse control:
--------------------------------------------- You can generally use the
return key in place of the left mouse button and the backspace key in
place of the right mouse button.  So if you want to play the game
entirely with the keyboard you can move the mouse pointer around with
the arrow keys, click on creatures with return, move the pointer with
the arrow keys to where you want to move to, press return to move
there, press backspace to cancel this creature's movement, etc.  Press
the Escape key to end your turn.

   Of course since this is an Amiga you could have just used left
alt-amiga as the left mouse button and right alt-amiga as the right
mouse button as in all other amiga applications.

   It is now possible to use your own creations in the game. This is
done by replacing some files in the Chaos directory. Be sure to keep a
copy of the original files !

Graphics
--------

   As of 3.0 a new graphics system that uses standard iff pictures to
describe how monsters and magic spells and all other objects in the
game look has been introduced.

   Each object in the game has its own 320x256 64 color EHB mode iff
file.

   The name of the file is, and must be, the @{i}exact@{ui} name of the object in
English. The spaces must be there so don't try to rename them. All the
files are already included with the proper name in @{b}gfx/Spells/@{ub} so you
don't need to worry about this.

   All you have to do is edit any of the files you want and they will
automagically get included into the game. Unless for some reason the
clock in your Amiga is broken. In which case you may have to type in
the shell: @{b}delete gfx/dat/#?@{ub}

   That will delete the graphics index files and force the game to
rebuild them from scratch. It takes a full minute to rebuild all the
tiles from scratch because it must open and close 350 files + read in
350 files + decompress 350 files + cut and paste 731 tiles, check for
blank frames, etc. These numbers are only accurate as of July 25th,
2000. The numbers will be much larger in the future.

   If you change any graphic file then the next time you start the
game, it will notice that you have changed something and will rebuild
the tile indexes. This will take a full minute or more.

   Selecting @{b}New Game@{ub} from the menu is currently not sufficient to
reload the tiles. You must completely quit the game (exit to DOS or
WorkBench).  Then reload the game and all will be well. 8)

   The old 3 frame animation limitation has been @{i}ERADICATED@{ui}. You may
now draw or render as many frames as you like.

   The old 32-color limitation has been @{i}ERADICATED@{ui}. I couldn't think of
any conceivable reason why any strategy game should be limited to 32
colors.  All Amigas support 64 colors or more so we are going to use
them.

Ye Olde Rules for GrafixMages
-----------------------------

  0. The first 31 pixels at the top of the screen are ignored.

  1. All Living Creatures @{i}MUST@{ui} have a dead image! (Even if you just cut
     & paste in an image of a dead orc.) The leftmost tile is reserved
     for the dead image and only the dead image.

  2. All Inanimate Objects and Growths and Undeads must @{i}NOT@{ui} have a dead
     image. Its dead image space should be blank.

  3. You may have as many frames of animation as you like. Ping-Pong and
     continuous looping playback are both currently supported.

  4. In order to specify that you want your animation played in looping
     mode you must change the purple line at line 32 to be color #1.
     This tells the game to play this animation in a continuous loop.

  5. The animation frames are terminated by the first completely blank
     frame.

  6. The image must use the supplied palette. If you rearrange the
     palette for artistic reasons then you @{i}MUST@{ui} rearrange it back to
     its original state before saving the file. Failure to do this will
     result in wrong-looking graphics.

  7. If you want to leave extra grafix on the screen that you are
     working on then that's ok. They will be ignored. Only the tiles up
     to the first blank tile are processed by the game. Any extra gfx
     at the bottom of the screen are ignored.

Music
-----

   If you liked the music in the game then you'll love the CDs produced
by the legendary Sidewinder. Sidewinder composed a LOT of the music for
this game (ChaosThemes #3-#10). The game music is all 8-bit so it
sounds a bit rough but the CDs are 100% 16-bit CD quality!

Announcing new sidewinder CD "2BadSheep"
========================================

   New CD made and composed using the Amiga computer and an array of
sounds and keyboards.. the latest hottest electronic album from the
artist Sidewinder 60 minutes play.. also catch the first Sidewinder
album "Future Shock 2" released Spring 1994, with over 74 minutes of
techno-rave and electronica 100% Amiga made. Hear just what an Amiga is
capable of performing. Radio Quality.

Adding your own sound effects
-----------------------------

   Beginning with Chaos v2.81 it is very easy to add your own sound
effects into the game.

   Once you have a sound effect that you want in the game you must save
it as a @{b}.8svx@{ub} sound file.

   In the @{b}Chaos@{ub} game directory there is a @{b}Sounds/@{ub} directory. In that
dir are 3 other directories @{b}Combat/@{ub} @{b}Death/@{ub} and @{b}Kill/@{ub}.

   The @{b}Combat/@{ub} directory contains the sounds that play when a creature
attacks another in hand-to-hand combat.

   The @{b}Death/@{ub} directory contains the sounds that play when a creature
dies.

   The @{b}Kill/@{ub} directory contains the sounds that play when a creature
kills something.

   So let's say you have a really great sound that the Mind Flayer
should make when it attacks someone. Just put the sound effect into the
@{b}Combat/@{ub} directory under the name of @{b}Mind Flayer@{ub}. The filename of the
sound effect must @{i}EXACTLY@{ui} match the name of the creature in the game!
You @{i}MUST@{ui} use correct spacing and uppercase/lowercase letters.

   If you add new sounds in the middle of a game then you must quit the
game completely (exit back to workbench). Then restart the game and the
sounds will then be activated.

   If you have a sound that you would like to play when a Mind Flayer
dies then just put it in the @{b}Death/@{ub} directory with the name @{b}Mind Flayer@{ub}.

   If you have a sound that you would like to play whenever a Mind
Flayer kills something then put it in the @{b}Kill/@{ub} directory with the name
@{b}Mind Flayer@{ub}.

   Using this system you can implement special sounds for any and all
of the monsters in Chaos.

WARNING on Automatic screen activation hacks
********************************************

   WARNING:  You should not use illegal hacks of the "Automatically
activate any screen that is ever in front" variety.  This is simply
improper and just won't do.  Hacks like this will not crash Chaos but
they will cause it to behave in an annoying manner since hacks of this
nature will constantly activate the WRONG screen.  Do not use
"AutoActivate FrontMost Screen" hacks.

   Failure to heed the above warning may cause the screen scrolling to
stop working.  This will prevent you from reading certain lengthy spell
descriptions.

   MCP has such a hack.  It should be turned off when playing Chaos.

Future additions
================

   We can only work on Total Chaos in our spare time but are always
pleased to hear suggestions for improvements from people who play the
game.

   Here is a list of features that may be added in the future:

   @{b}*@{ub} More spells (send me your favourite ideas, and pictures of wanted
     creatures).

   @{b}*@{ub} Improved sound and sampled speech.

   @{b}*@{ub} More setup options.

Known bugs
==========

   Total Chaos has been extensively tested with @{b}Enforcer@{ub}, @{b}MuForce@{ub},
@{b}Mungwall@{ub} and @{b}MuGuardianAngel@{ub} and in our experience does nothing nasty.
However, crashes may happen, if they do it is most helpful to me if you
can note carefully what was happening when the crash occurred.  There
are a few less serious bugs within the game which may be fixed in the
future.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Reinstatement Bug@{ui}: When Dark Power, Vengeance, Consecrate or
     Justice succeeds in killing a creature upon a corpse, the creature
     is killed but the corpse is brought back to life. This "bug" is
     deliberately incorporated in the program. Advanced players will
     exploit this fact in the obvious way.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Cat Lord@{ui}: Theoretically there should only ever be one Cat Lord.
     However, it possible to create more than one by a variety of
     methods:

       a. using Alter Reality,

       b. using Mutate,

       c. by waking a sleeping one,

       d. by raising a dead one,

       e. using Request.

     Multiple Cat Lords will not cause the game to crash but may result
     in cats changing sides several times, moving multiple times, and
     other undocumented effects. We leave it to you to explore the
     possibilities.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Classic Bugs@{ui}: The classic mode is not perfect and it is
     possible that spells not normally available will occur. Known
     cases are the faun casting sleep. The thundermare and iridium
     powerups are still possible. If generators are used then the
     bipedal generator will still generate creatures not normally
     available in classic mode.

   James Conwell has had the following utilities installed on his old
ECS Amigas for years and has used them every day and they work great
and he recommends them to everyone: CPUblit 1.0, Arq 1.78 (Animated
Requesters), FastExec (Loads Exec.library to fastram instead of
chipram; speeds up multitasking and interrupts, etc.)

   On his AGA and ECS Amigas: PoolMem, the most useful utility ever: It
greatly reduces memory fragmentation in your system, thus increasing
speed and reliabilty.

Technical features
==================

   This game was coded in a mixture of JC and Assembly code. We use JC
for the main game and super high speed optimized assembly code for
certain time-critical things like the music and the ray tracing and
certain math operations and certain graphics operations.

   Version 2.3 contains 313 spells. Version 3.0 contains 349 spells.

   This game features 50 fps animation in the quadrascopes and
quadspectrograms.

   The sprite that highlights the current creature only runs at 25 fps
no matter how fast your computer is. We did this on purpose because
when it moves faster than 25 fps it becomes unpleasing to the eye.

   The color cycling on the QUIT and NEW GAME requesters moves at 50
fps. If you only have a 7 Mhz 68000 then it is only about 25 fps.

   The vector graphic pentagrams on the ABOUT requester rotate at 50
fps on all Amigas.

   The intro music utilizes 4 simultaneous channels of audio, each one
at up to 28,000 samples per second.

   The introductory credits are displayed in 640x512 resolution with 8
colors and smooth full-screen scrolling.

   This game utilizes ray-tracing. When calculating line of sight to a
target a beam of light is traced from the source to the target. If the
beam gets through then you have line of sight. If the beam is blocked
then you do not have line of sight.

   Ray Tracing is an inherently slow process so if you only have a 7
Mhz 68000 you will notice a delay of up to .5 seconds when you push the
"l" key to see all the cells on the board that you have line of sight
to while the computer ray-traces all the possiblities. If this is too
slow for you then please upgrade to a 25 Mhz 030 and then you'll be
happy 8)

   This game was programmed to be 100% OS friendly and Multitasking
friendly, however it will not work on graphics cards because

   Picasso96 OS and CyberGrafix OS simply don't support many standard
Amiga OS functions.  Examples are ChangeSprite(), MoveScreen() with
attached screens.  OpenScreen() with attached screens,
OpenScreen(640,512..), MoveSprite(), parent screens, child screens etc.

   This game can be played on Amigas which are equipped with graphics
cards however no benefit will be derived from the presence of a
graphics card.

   If you want me to rewrite the game to support P96 OS then you need to
complete the following 2 steps: 1. Register the game.  2. Do one or
more of the following:    A: Send me a Voodoo3 PCI gfx card or better
with 16 megs of ram or more.     B: Send me an S3 Virge DX PCI gfx card
or better with 4 megs of ram.     C: Send me 2 megs of ram chips which
I can install into an       existing S3 Virge DX (170 Mhz RAMDAC).

   It would also help speed things up if you explained how to get around
the lack of OS support for P96 and CyberGfx (especially the sprite
problems).  It would also help if you redrew all the gfx in 24-bit
color using 32x32 or 64x64 sized tiles.

   Version 2.3 utilizes a main gameboard resolution of 320x256 pixels
with 32 colors. The text area at the bottom of the main screen is
displayed in 640x256 resolution with 8 colors. The information panels
are also displayed with 640x256 resolution in 8 colors.

   Version 2.8 utilizes Information Panels, Scroll Panels and Score
Screens of 640x512 pixels in 16 colors on both ECS and AGA Amigas. And
a specially designed Calligraphy font is used with anti-aliasing and
anti-flickering to make it appear extremely smooth looking on
interlaced screens.

   Version 3.0 utilizes a main gameboard resolution of 320x256 pixels
with 64 colors.  It contains 904 64-color tiles.

   Version 3.4 contains 2352 64-color tiles.

   Version 3.49cd was the last version that could be run on an ECS
chipset.

   V3.49 and under had only 1 animation speed for monsters, 3fps.  No
faster, no slower.

   Version 4.0 is the 1st version to require AGA.  It runs entirely in
640x512 resolution with 256 colors @24 fps.  The Title Screen and About
Screen are displayed in 640x512x262,000 colors.  It contains over 6000
256-color tiles.

   Version 4.0 also features the new multispeed anim system for the
monsters.  Monsters can now be animated at up to 24 fps.

   Version 5.0 features 50 fps animation, continuous hiliting of all
your creations throughout your turn, backdrop terrain, shadows, paths
and high speed quadruple-layer cell rendering routines.  It contains
over 18000 256-color tiles.

   The documentation was written using the Texinfo system to produce
both online and printed documentation. A translator package is
available from fdelacroix@nordnet.fr.

   Bill Gates does not profit in any way from the sale or use of this
game.

Abath
=====

   A variation on the unicorn having a somewhat enlarged horn which it
can use to induce severe bruising in an opponent.  The abath can also
be ridden by the wizard.

   For many years the existence of the creature was the subject of much
debate, and only recently have any instances come to life.

Abduction
=========

   Like subversion, abduction is an attempt to convince an enemy
creature that its interests may better lie with allegiance to your
wizard.  Intelligent creatures are more likely to see through this ruse
than stupid creatures.  However, as abduction applies to a random
creature you cannot know beforehand the intelligence of the recipient.
Further, because the targeting of this spell is so imprecise it is
possible that it will be applied to one of your own creations.
Therefore, the spell is most beneficial when you have relatively few
creations.

   Line of sight is not required and your chosen target can be anywhere
on the board.  This spell will not attempt to target Artifacts,
Scrolls, Wizards or corpses.  If successful, the target will
immediately come under control of your wizard and no longer respond to
the commands of its previous lord.

Achiyalabopa
============

   A large low-flying bird with poor eyesight.  The history of this
creature is unclear, but it has evolved feathers which resemble knives.
It attacks simply by brushing against the opponent.  The knife-like
feathers are sharp enough to make a large number of serrations on the
hides of the opponent.

Acid Rain
=========

   Causes a global rain storm with droplets of extreme acidity.  The
rain drops are a mixture of water, sulphuric acid, formic acid, nitric
acid, phosphoric acid, carbonic acid, and surprisingly citric acid.
The droplets also contain hydrazine and various other flammable
compounds.  Because of these flammable compounds acid rain will not put
out fires.  Further, acid rain does not harm creatures in general
although during the rain it may be painful to them.

Curse
=====

   The curse is a highly desirable spell.  It is best cast when the
world is full of many enemy creations and your position is reasonably

growths, and even inanimate objects.  Sleeping creatures are also

generators owned by the killed wizard will live on and continue to be

It is best to use this spell when you have several good creatures on
your spell list with which you can repopulate the world after the
devastation.

   The use of this spell is bound to cause outrage on the part of other

   At the conclusion of the spell all objects (including those of the

Golden Dragon
=============

   A very intelligent creature that rules amongst the good living
species with the exception of the immensely rare platinum dragon.  The
golden dragon can fight in a similar vein as the stone giant but has
the gift of fire breathing and flight which makes it extremely deadly
to any creature or wizard that attracts its attention.

Gooey Blob
==========

   Gooey blob is particularly useful and can be conjured some distance
from the wizard provided there is line of sight.  The gooey blob then
grows much like a fire does.  No part of the gooey blob can be moved.
Although the gooey blob has no intelligence it will never harm its
master or any of its master's creatures.

   However, the gooey blob quickly grows over enemy creatures
preventing them from moving but not actually killing them. Buried
creatures can be recovered by killing the gooey blob on them.

   Rescued creatures will have half their initial life remaining after
being uncovered no matter how much they had when they were buried, so
their life on recovery can be more or less than what it was when they
were buried. If an enemy wizard succumbs to the blob that wizard dies.

   Gorillas are a good middle of the road animal and are a worthy

Gravity Sphere
==============

   Causes the wizard to create a dense sphere of neutrons, much like a
miniature neutron star, which causes the gravity to increase
exponentially.  Indeed, gravity becomes so strong that flying movement
becomes impossible.

   All creatures which can normally fly will be forced to move like any
other creature. The sphere will eventually decay and normal flight can
then resume.

   A typical instance will last for 6 turns, however, if several

does not appear on spell lists (you are about as likely to get a

horse only occurs when a thundermare kills a red, green, blue, or
golden dragon.  The iridium horse is the ultimate in mounts. It is
strong, swift, and deadly in combat. Not only can it attack in similar
vein to the thundermare, but it also has a powerful iridium stare which
affects several statistics of the target simultaneously. The irdium
horse also freely attacks undeads even though it is not undead itself.
The nightmare pales in comparison to this awesome beast. Even demons

the tree at the time is granted a new spell.

   Unlike castles the trees will not collapse unless occupied. The tree
also provides a wizard with shielding from the watchful eyes of the
independents. Magic trees can be destroyed by combat and some magical
weapons.

   Any wizard may make use of any magic tree provided it is not already
occupied. Each magic wood spell can produce up to 8 trees.

Replicate
=========

   Replicate makes a clone of the chosen creature.  The clone will

Turmoil
=======

   Turmoil affects every square in the world.  Every cell is randomly
transposed to a new location.

   The result is very unpredictable and may or may not improve your
situation.  Often useful when attacking a well fortified opponent. This
spell is only available through meditation and is very rare.

Turns
=====

   Are you tired of expending a large amount of energy struggling in
what seems to be a never ending battle?  This spell could be the
answer.  If the number of turns remaining exceeds 10 then this spell
will give everyone a major hurry up by cutting the number of remaining
turns to just 10.

   However, the spell is bipolar and if the number of turns remaining
is less than 10 then an additional 10 turns will be granted.

Ubiquiscope
===========

   The Ubiquiscope is equivalent to a Crystal Ball + a Magic Wand
combined.  A highly desirable spell which removes the need for your
wizard to have line of sight in order to cast a spell.

   With the Ubiquiscope, your wizard can "see" everywhere. Range
restrictions still apply as usual, though each Ubiquiscope will add +1
to your casting range.

Uncertainty

fighting ability and a good magical resistance as well as endurance.

====

   The wake spell is used to reverse the effect of the sleep spell or
to wake creatures which went to sleep when a wizard died.  Once woken a

   A wasp nest is pretty self-explanatory, any enemy creature
approaching a wasp nest will be automatically attacked.  Once you cast
a wasp nest you can forget about it, since you cannot move it and it
attacks automatically.  It will attack all adjacent squares
simultaneously.

Weak Wall
=========

   Despite its name, the weak wall is a formidable obstacle for an
opponent to overcome.  It is extremely useful for slowing the passage
of fire, or blocking the growth of gooey blob.  The name only implies
that this wall is weaker than standard wall or strong wall.

   Most magical attacks will eliminate a weak wall. The wall can also be
destroyed by combat but this will usually take several rounds. For each
weak wall spell 6 pieces of wall may be cast anywhere in the world.

White Dragon
============

   White dragons normally dwell only in cold regions.  Meditation may
allow a wizard to call upon a white dragon.  The white dragon is very
strong but slower than other dragons due to its lower metabolic rate.

   The white dragon can freeze other species to death with a breath
weapon which is more effective than the breath weapons of the red and
green dragons.

Wood Elf
========

   Like all elves the wood elf has a pure heart giving them a high
magical resistance (particularly from the darker kinds of magic).  Wood
elves are physically weak and should best avoid direct combat.  Wood
elves are highly skilled with a bow.  Every wood elf comes complete
with an ash bow and a full quiver of arrows.

   The ability of the wood elf is slightly exceeded by their rarer
cousin the gray elf.

X-Ray
=====

   This spell blasts an object with a high dosage of X-rays.  Weak
creatures may die instantly, as this spell will lower their magical
resistance by 2 points and transfer the excess damage to their life
force at a 10:1 ratio.

   For example a creature with magical resistance of 1 and life of 15
will be reduced to a magical resistance of 0 and life force of 5.  This
spell requires line of sight and can be used on inanimate objects.

effective at blocking the progress of land-ridden living creatures.

   Other undeads, however, can quickly dispose of the zombie.
