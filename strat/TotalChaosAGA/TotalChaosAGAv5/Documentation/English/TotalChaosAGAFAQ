             F.A.Q.  Frequently Asked Questions:
             -----------------------------------


> * In exploration mode, the lightning spell effect
> reveals who is casting the spell.  Why?

Yes that is the disadvantage to casting Lightning.
Lightning is highly visible and can easily be seen from
miles away.




I know how to cast spells and creatures,
but it all looks so complicated and I don't
know what the spells do. Is there anything
available to help me on this?

Joar's A:
Thats why every spell and creature has a
description that tells you the main things.
You can view the description on any of
your spells in the spellbook,(right side),
by pointing at them and pressing q.
Or you can click the query icon above your
spellbook first and then click on anything
you want to know about.

Well the Arctic Wolf damages life AND movement so its very dangerous.
The Arctic Wolf is a naturally occuring animal.
The Arctic Kitty Wolf is rumored to be a  genetically engineered monster.



> The Lion has 8 in combat,
> while all other cats have more.
> even the cheetah. why?

Because it is a male Lion.  Female Lions do all the hunting and killing.
The male Lions must conserve their energy because they must supply
lots of sex to all the female Lions so they aren't really that great at
fighting.




Q:  Why can't I kill wizards with Justice, Vengeance or
Exorcise?  When I cast these spells on an enemy wizard he gets
damaged and he "virtually" dies and I get bonus spells but he never
"really" dies no matter how many of these spells I cast on him!

Joar's Answer:
You dont kill them because if you did, you would lose some
additional hours/minutes of fun.

Robin's Answer:
That's just a feature enabling you to get several bonus spells out of
one wizard!  Think it in another way:  This feature helps you to
survive for more than 1 turn.

Frédéric's Answer:
No matter how hard you try, you cannot expect to kill a wizard by
seeking justice or vengeance.  An enemy wizard will always try to do
his best to him; you won't succeed in making him feel guilty for
this.  Exorcise is another matter.  Wise archimages suspect that
being a lich wizard denotes a very high knowledge of death and magic,
enough to gain invulnerability to this.

However, the energy developed by a wizard to resist those spells easily
grants the caster a bonus spell...



Q: Sometimes when picking my bonus spells the names of the spells
are displayed at the bottom of the screen when I move the mouse over
them.  Other times no text is displayed and I have to go by memory or
guess which spell I'm choosing.  What's up with that?

Robin's Answer:
There are creatures with more knowledge than you.
Some know the names of some spells (Omnibiologists, Inanimatologists),
some know all the spells (Recognomancer).  If you have one of these
knowledgable creatures then you will know which spell you are pointing
at.


James's Answer:
The game will _never_ display the names of the bonus spells that
you can choose from unless you have assistance from certain special
creatures who can recognize scrolls instantly just be seeing their
picture.  Examples are:
Inanimatologist and Inanimage who can only recognize scrolls of
inanimate objects.
Omnibiologist who can recognize any creature scrolls.
Recognomancer who can recognize anything.

If you don't have one of these creatures on the board to assist you
then choosing bonus spells is a "memory game" for experienced players
or a "guessing game" for newbies. :)


Q: Why can't I poison a Generator?

Joar's Answer:
Try to poison a steel chambered machine... what happens?.. yeah
that's right, nothing..... actually the fluid of the poison helps
lubricate the wheels in the machinery.

James's Answer:
You can poison Aviaries, Dragon Nests and Bipedal Generators but
not the _real_ Generators because those Generators are supposed to be
VERY hard to kill!  They heal all 63 life points per turn + all their
other stats magically heal to maximum each turn.


Q: Why are Generators so tough to kill?

James's Answer:
Because they are. :)  The standard way to kill a Generator is to
inflict 63 points of damage to it in a single turn.  There are
other ways to kill Generators but we will leave them as a mystery for
the adventurous to (maybe) figure out one day. :)



Q: How can I remove this wizard's reflector ? I tried restoration but it
didn't help. And, doh! This wizard has forced me into an alliance !

A: You can't remove his reflector.


Q: Is there a way to provide a given creature with ranged combat besides
Touch of God ?

A: Yes :-)


Questions from Stefan:

The creator of Grim Reaper (Death) says Grim Reaper cannot attack
directly.  He can only suck the life from all those around him
with his special combat.

If you cast a Chainsaw onto Death then it _will_ be
able to attack things directly.  This is because Chainsaw adds new
capabilities to a creature but Combat merely increases existing
capabilities.

If you look at the 2nd info panel of Death aka Grim Reaper you will
see that he cannot attack the living nor can he attack the undead.
So he can't attack anybody unless you cast a spell on him which
activates attacking living/undead things such as Sword of Sassenrath
or Chainsaw.


> 3) It seems, that the pond doesn't affect a wizard, which is

Irvine's Invulnerability makes the Wizard invulnerable to physical
attacks of Combat, Ranged Combat and Special Combat.  The Pool heals
by attacking things with its Special Combat.


> 4) I have killed an invulnerable enemy wizard (19 LP) with orange

Yes.  Orange Jelly doesn't attack.  It merely grows over things.
There is a rule in the game docs that says if a wizard gets covered
by growth then he immediately dies.

> _PS:_ What a GREAT game!!!

Hehehe I agree!!!  I stopped playing Chaos for about 3 weeks but then
I resumed play a couple of days ago and WOW the games have been
totally interesting and wild!!!!

Of course, because the animated creature that was blocking the LOS
has just moved his arm or leg out of the way.  Chaos uses real-time
raytracing to determine LOS.

If you point at anything on the board with the mouse and then hold down
the "l" key you can watch the LOS changing in real-time.  Its really
cool.


SP> - Is there any spell that can be spoken on an enemy

Yes, all of them.

SP>  Will such a wizard die of a growth like Green Ooze?

Yes.

Irvine's Invulnerability only protects you from standard combat
attacks.  This includes combat, ranged combat and special combat.
It does not protect against being covered over by tons of Green
Oozy crap. :)


SP> - Why do you get a spell for speaking justice on a wizard with

Because you "virtually" killed him.

Do you think you deserve a bonus spell for killing a defenseless
hole in the ground?!?  :)


SP> - do the different meditation places provide a different number

I think they are all the same except the Shadow City gives more.  The
Shadow City rules!


JB> Is it possible to swap the creature that stands on top of the scroll

Yes, absolutely.  You are allowed to shuffle your creatures during
your turn with no penalty.
