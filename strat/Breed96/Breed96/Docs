                            Required Files
                           ================
Breed requires Breed.dat in the same drawer as the executable. It also
requires diskfont.library in your libs drawer.

                          Disk Installation
                         ===================
You can just double click the Breed icon after booting from workbench or:
Drag the Breed96 drawer to a blank installed disk, drag the libs drawer from
your workbench disk and put it on your breed disk. Write a startup-sequence
file in your s drawer with the lines: "cd Breed96"  , and then "Breed"
without quotes.

                       Hard Drive Installation
                      ========================= 
Just drag the Breed96 drawer to DH0: as you would normally.
               
                              Forward
                             =========
    I know how much people hate reading docs so I made the game easy enough
to get by without them. If you need more documentation then register the game
and you'll get documentation with more volume and detail.

                   1. Infomation about units.
                  ============================

BUILDING SHIPS
You can build ships by first doing these things:
 - Build a docking port (so they can be controlled)
 - Build a mining station (so fuel can be refined from the ore)
 - Build an ore silo (so you can have a reserve of ore)
 - Make sure you have a power station (a ship uses 100 energy)
Also note that to build a lazer drone or a battle cruiser you will need
12 people to crew these. You need 25 ore for each ship.

RESIDENTIAL UNIT
Holds about 50 people providing minimal living provisions.

FOOD GENERATOR
Horticulturally produces food sustaining about 10 residential units.
Food is only produced if there is room in a food silo.

FOOD SILO
Hold about 200 units of food. Food is transported to food silos automatically.

POWER STATION
Provides power to about 18 different power draining units.

ROAD
Provides a better transportation method between different units.
Adding more roads to an colony with traffic problems reduces the traffic.

DISRUPTOR
Disruptors hit aliens within range with a disruptor wave. They are programmed
only to hit aliens. To activate a disruptor simply click on the disruptor and
then select the activate disruptor button.

DROID
Droids are placed on the map and when clicked on, may be moved or will fire
hitting both aliens and units. Droids may also be selected to repair a
structure by clicking on the droid and then selecting the repair button
repairing the unit that is directly in front of the droid.

COMMERCE CENTRE
Commerce centres provide shopping entertainment and employment for people in
the colony.

LAW CENTRE
Law centres provide a form of law enforcement and a justice system.

MINING STATION
These mine deep into the core of the planet or moon and mine ore.
The ore is transported to ore silos if they are available.

ORE SILO
Ore silos are used to store ore produced from mining stations.
They hold about 200 ore units.

DOCKING PORT
Docking ports provide a means for people and produce to be transported onto
waiting ships. They also allow monitoring of ships whereabouts and
communication to them. A docking port can handle 8 ships at one time.

OBSERVATORY
Once installed the orservatories astronomers discover planets. Discoveries are
reported on the messages screen.

PROBE
Probes may be sent to other known planets and will report on will about the
planets defences and stocks. They are essential to find out your enemies
strengths.

LASER DRONE
Laser drones are sub intelligent war robots used to attack other planets.

BATTLE CRUISER
Battle cruisers are deep space warrior class manned ships capable of
destroying a planet.

CARGO SHUTTLE
Cargo shuttles allow trade between two planets. They may be manually load and
unloaded or a path between the colony planet and another planet may be
programmed.

DIPLOMAT VESSEL
Diplomat vessels can communicate with the inhabitants of another planets once
sent there. You are given the option of negotiating trade agreements, peace,
war and alliances discussed later.

WEAPON UPDATE
Upgrades the efficiency of weapons such as disruptors and ships such as laser
drones and battle cruisers.

SHIELDING UPDATE
Upgrades the efficiency of shields on ships and also increases the range of
disruptors.

CARGO HOLD UPDATE
Upgrades the cargo hold capacity of cargo shuttles to allow more resources to
be transported.

SPACE STATION
The space station does nothing in the this release. It is used in the
registered version to colonise uninhabited planets and to move your home world.

                 2. Information about button functions
                 =====================================

MESSAGES
   The messages button is located near the food and electricity bar graphs at
the bottom right of the screen. The button will light up blue when a message
has been left. To view the messages click the messages button and the last
messages will be displayed.

PRODUCTION
   Selecting the production icon gives you a list of items you can produce.
Clicking on one of the items for example a residential unit will request you
to place the unit on the map. The appropriate amount of credits is removed
from you. (note : if you press ESC you can abandon the request).

RESEARCH
   After pressing the research button you are prompted with a list of items
you may research. After selected an item the researchers in the colony begin
researching that project. Once the suitable amount of time elapses the item
becomes available for production.

INFORMATION
   The information button gives a screen which informs you as to how much ore,
food, people and energy you have. The rating gives an indication of how well
the people like the situation of the colony. The calculation of the rating
depends on these factors and influences :

              Traffic...............Roads
              Famine................Food generators
              Population density....Residential units
              Crime.................Law centres
              Employment............Commerce centres
              Tax...................Tax rate

By improving these factors the population rises quicker and more credits may
be taxed.

TAX RATE
   The tax rate is the percent that is removed from a persons income.
The tax rate is generally set to about the rating given in the information
screen. Any lower and the population gets overcrowded, too high and people
will move out.

ADVISOR
   By clicking on the advisor button an advisor pops up and gives advice as
what to do next. However the advisor does not tell you things like when to
assemble an attack fleet or who you should trade with. If the advisor
continually asks to add more residential units just bump up the tax rate.

SHIPS LIST
   The ships list is provided once a ship has been produced by you.
By selecting a ship on the list you are given information about that ship.
Click on one of the entry and the ship may be launched etc.

GALACTIC MAP
   The galactic map gives a representation of the planets and moons and by
selecting on one of the planets gives a list of ships on that planet. These
in turn can be selected and the ship can be launched etc.

RELATIONS
   The relation screen shows which alien races you have agreements with.
These are war, peace, trade and alliance. A picture of the race will appear
once you have made agreements with them.

PLANET OWNERSHIP MAP
   After clicking on the relation screen and then the ownership icon you
are presented with a map of the planets with different coloured circles
signalling who owns which planet. Also note that these colours are on
the relations screen to show what agreements match which planets.

OPTIONS
   The button menu gives you options to save your game which saves in the
current directory. It also gives you means to get back to the main menu.
The registered version allows you to save more than one game.

WAGE WAR
   By selecting this button you are given a list of planets you may attack.
You will need a planet inhabited by aliens to attack which you have declared
war on and war ships such as laser drones on that planet.
Once selected the ships orbitting that planet will attack its defences.
The outcome is depend on the amount of ships on either side and the shields
and weapon strengths of both sides.

REPAIR
   This option is selected by producing a droid. Then clicking on the droid
and then selecting the repair button. The droid will repair whatever is
directly in front of it. A message then tells you whether the unit is fully
repaired or not. Repeated clicking of the repair button will fully repair the
unit.

MOVE
   This option allows a droid to move around. You control the droid by using
the cursor keys on the keyboard. Pressing the space bar makes the droid fire.

DESTROY
This button self destructs the unit that has been clicked on.

NEGOTIATIONS
   Negotiations are made by producing a diplomat vessel and then selected
it when orbitting an alien planet.

    TRADE :  When trade agreements are made cargo shuttle may freely trade
             resources between the two races.

      WAR :  When war is declared war ships are allowed to attack that race.
             However that race will also attack your colony and planets.

    PEACE :  When peace agreements are made then the two races are at peace
             with no wish to wage war on each other.

 ALLIANCE :  When an alliance is made the alien race you have made an alliance
             with may assist you when another race is attacking you.
             However you will also be asked to lend ships when the other alien
             race is attacked or attacking planets.


                                Program Info
                               ==============
   Sorry to say but Breed was written in AMOS using an Amiga500 (without a
harddrive) So if you want better software then support authors and if you
want a really great game then register. It's about triple on the playability
and longevity stakes.
   If you want to say hey then email me on c9424357@peach.newcastle.edu.au
I'll be there until the end of 96. Enjoy the game. CU L8TR, Damian.

                            Appendum for V1.3
                           ===================
This release has been made to inform users that the game is available through
Vulcan Software. It is also to tell users that the problems with this demo
do not occur in the commercial game.

Version 1.3 over Version 1.2
============================
- Breed has now been compiled to be AGA friendly.
- The sounds from the war screen are less crappy.
- Cargo/Shield/Weapon updates are now saved.
- Alien casualties now register on their planet.
- Aliens start interacting sooner.
- Aliens are now more agressive if provoked.

Please Note
===========
1. You can't colonise other planets (that means you can't have more than
   one planet you are managing). In the registered version you can
   claim uninhabited planets.
2. You CAN remove road by pressing the right mouse button when laying road.

Thanks to everyone for their help, bug notifications, advice and compliments.
