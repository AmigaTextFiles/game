  TANX SQUADRON is a turn based stratergy game based around LASER SQUAD 
and UFO. In TANX you must manage and direct a group of 10 miltary 
vehicles and use them and the weapons avalible to you to destroy an 
Alien threat which is currently attacking the Earth. Your units will 
be affected by individial aspects such as their own SKILL, MORALE as 
well as TIME, FEAR and the VEHICLE type to which they have been 
assigned. Ultimately the outcome of the game will depend on
how well you are able to co-ordinate your units and how you 
will spend money gained from successful missions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

@{b}Background Story...@{ub}

  Several months ago, it came apparent to the Governments of Earth
that a global conspiracy designed to prevent information about a race 
of aliens becoming greater and greater in number, was failing. 
Attempts to keep these aliens in check has begun to fail due to 
increasing difficulties in keeping the actions discrete and also 
attacks on civilian areas.

  Having agreed that a pool of military resources and an immediate
counter strike was needed, Earth began its fight back against the 
alien invaders... only to be faced with odds that had clearly been 
under estimated. The aliens were able to regain their numbers almost 
as quickly as they were destroyed. But this was only the beginning.

  Although it had always been known that the alien weaponary and the
beings themselves were heavily based around organic technology, 
chemical weaponary had little or no affect on them. The aliens 
themselves were "born" on Earth and had lived there long enough to be 
immune to almost every single weapon Earth had. It seemed as though 
these "aliens" were almost native to the planet itself.

 During the fighting, the original teams setup to battle the aliens
suffered many casualties and even though they fought hard, it was a 
loosing battle. However, a group of high spirited individuals were 
not about to see their planet over run by the invaders. Taking 
weaponary and military vehicles that had been classed as "destroyed", 
they rebuilt and repaired them, fitted new weapons and decided to 
take on the aliens themselves. As a mercenary unit they would be able 
to accomplish their goals more easily, and keep fighting until the
aliens were driven from the face of the planet.

The unit was codenamed TANX...

@node REQ "Game Requirements"

TANX SQUADRON GAME REQUIREMENTS
-------------------------------

TANX was coded on an AGA AMIGA with an 030/25Mhz Processor. This 
should therefore be the minimum usable Amiga. It is NOT recommended 
that you play this game on an 020 as it has been not tested on this 
machine, but it may actually be too slow to be playable. Given the 
nature of the game, an 040 is realistic.

4 Megs of RAM (Including 1.5 Megs of Chip RAM which *must* be 
available).

2.5 Megs of Harddrive Space ; The game can only run from Harddrive.

Mouse and Keyboard. (duh!)
@{i}Actually, not really a Duh, since you cannot play the game without
both and the joystick cannot be used.@{ui}

@endnode

@node INSTALL "Installing the Game"

@{b}Installation@{ub}

        Well, you're reading this so you must have done something 
right. No, seriously. You should have a Drawer called TANX containing 
two icon files, TANX and TANX.GUIDE. As well as these, you will find 
that you have 4 hidden drawers called DATA, GFX, MUSIC and SOUND. The 
game should be unarchived or copied into your harddrive or partition. 
However, you @{b}MUST@{ub} copy the 2001.font file AND the 
2001 drawer to your FONTS: directory of your harddrive. This FONT is 
contained in the DATA directory of TANX. Failure to do so will result 
in the game locking up completely when it is run, and we'd hate you 
to think that you'd downloaded / bought it for nothing. 

        Once this is done, you are all set to play. Just double click 
the TANX icon to play the game.

@node NEWGAME "SETTING UP A NEW GAME."

@{b}Starting a New Game@{ub}
-------------------

        Once you have watched or clicked through the Startup, you are 
presented with a screen that will have three options avalible for you.

                            START NEW GAME
                               LOAD GAME
                             CONTINUE GAME*
                          VIEW CURRENT STATUS*
                            EXIT TO SYSTEM

         @{i}* - Only avalible upon loading a Saved Game.@{ui}

START NEW GAME
--------------

        If it is your first time playing the game, or you want to 
create a new team, the you will need to select START NEW GAME. Move 
the mouse pointer over this option and a box will appear around it. 
Select it with a click of the left mouse button. You will be presents 
with a new screen containing a list of 10 people (named by their sex) 
and also their SKILL and MORALE.

        Follow the On Screen instructions until you are satisfied 
with your Team Members. Note that SEX does not affect either SKILL 
or MORALE. Once you have choosen your team, you will be given the 
chance to name them. It is recommended you don't stick to MALE and 
FEMALE as this will lead to lots of confusion later on. However you 
should try and name your Members according to SEX. Follow the 
onscreen instructions until you are satisfied.

        After a short time, you will be presented with a different 
screen. This is probably one of the most important parts of the 
game, as it is where you assign your members to their Vehicles. All 
the vehciles are avalible from the start and there is no cost in the 
purchase of them. However there is a restriction - You may only 
assign one person to a Devestator and also to the Trojan. Apart from 
this you are free to assign anyone to any vehicle you wish. 

LOAD GAME
---------

        Selecting this Option will present you with a screen showing 
the number of saved games avalible. Select which one you want to use 
by pressing an F KEY. Once you have selected a saved game (or pressed 
escape) you will be taken back to the Main Menu with some extra 
options.

CONTINUE GAME
-------------

        This will simply continue your current game. If you are in a 
battle during the save it will reload the battle for you to play, the 
game will restart where you left off. If you are not in a battle you 
will be taken to the equipment screen.

VIEW CURRENT STATUS
-------------------

        This option will show you all the members of your team and 
highlight those that you should pay special attention to. It will show
you their current ARMOUR, SHIELD, TIME and FEAR. It will also inform 
you of your current Mission and Stage, as will as remaining objectives
and your current objective.
        There are certain attributes of this information that you
should take particular note of. The first is team members whose 
information is in RED. This indicates that their ARMOUR is below 10 
and they are very close to being KILLED or WOUNDED. Team Members whose
information is in YELLOW indicates that their shield (if they have 
any) is either completely depleted or is very low. Two other pieces of
information worth noting are "MISSING" and "DEAD". The latter is self 
explainatory, whereas MISSING means that a team member was lost during
a RETREAT and is currently not with the group.

Left Click to return to the Menu.

EXIT TO SYSTEM
--------------

        Exits the Game back to Workbench, or whereever you ran it 
from. Exit is immediate without prompting.

@node TEAM "TANX Member Attributes"

@{b}Team Member Attributes@{ub}
----------------------

   TIME  - During a battle this will affect how many things a Team 
           Member can do during that turn. MOVING, FIRING and TURNING 
           are all a reliant on having time units avalible to you. 
           Once your time units are used up, the Team Member is 
           unable to do anything more that turn and must wait until 
           the next turn. The amount of time a player has is affected 
           by their SKILL and also the VEHCILE that they are in.

   SKILL - This affects how many TIME UNITS a player can have and
           also how accurate their SHOOTING is. Skill points are 
           raised after combat experience, depending on how well they 
           did and if they managed to stick out the entire battle 
           without retreating.

   MORALE - This affects how likely a Team Member is to PANIC if 
            their FEAR levels become too great. The higher the 
            Member's MORALE, the less they will be affected by fear. 
            However, if their FEAR levels exceed their MORALE, they 
            may panic with two possible affects. MORALE is increased 
            with combat Experience.

   FEAR - Fear increases as an unprotected (unshielded) Team Member 
          recieves damage and their armour is less than 100. These 
          fear points decrease 1 point per turn (including Aliens 
          Turns). If a Team Member is KILLED, fear points for all 
          other alive Team Members will rise by 10!! If a Team Member 
          panics, it will happen at the start of your next turn. They 
          can do one of two things, either refuse to move or try and 
          run away. If they run-away is it not always in an 
          intelligent direction and they could run into the middle on 
          bunch of Enemy units who will probably kill them on the 
          next turn. Either way, a paniced team member if of no use 
          to you until the following turn when they have calmed down 
          (provided they haven't be shot up again).
          

@endnode

@node CONTROL "BASIC CONTROL"

@{b}Basic Gameplay@{ub}

        Controlling the vehicles is quite straight forward. If you 
have played UFO or Laser Squad then this should be simple for you. 
Below the main screen is a control panel which has various buttons on 
it. When you start a game there will be a vehicle selected with a 
square yellow box round it. You can move the yellow box by using the 
arrow keys (the ones below Help and Del). This will determine the 
direction you want the vehicle to move or face. Move the yellow box to
a postition on the screen and press the return key and the vehicle 
will move to that square. Note that Tanks cannot move into water, rock
squares or squares currently occupied by other vehicles. The planes 
can move over water and rocks but cannot occupy a square that has a 
vehicle already in it. To make a vehicle face in a direction, use the 
space bar instead of return and the vehicle will face in that 
direction. You can only move or look around if you have enough time 
units. To scroll the map around, use the numeric key pad. Key 5 will 
re-center on the vehicle currently in use. You can still move a 
vehicle to a square even if it is not on the screen by using the arrow
keys.
        If, while moving, a message in the information bar appears 
saying that an enemy has been spotted, the green status bar at the 
bottom of the control panel will turn red. Either side of this bar 
are 2 arrows. Clicking on these arrows will scroll though the 
enemies that can be seen by the vehicle and the yellow box will 
change to a crosshair. This allows you to fire at the currently 
selected target. In the information bar, a short description of the 
target will appear. You can either fire at the target, or just move 
away from it. Assuming you actually want to fire at it, you must 
first choose what weapon you want to use. The weapons available to 
that vehicle are listed on the right hand side of the control panel 
and are selected by pressing the relevant number on the main 
keyboard. Next, select the rate at which you want to fire: Normal, 
Rapid or Bezerk. Normal fires one accurate shot at the target, Rapid 
fires three shots in the targets direction and Bezerk fires ten 
shots at the target. These shots are dependent upon the time units 
the vehicle has and also how much ammo the weapon has left. To fire, 
select the box marked Fire on the left of the panel, or press the 
return key. Note that there are two other boxes above this: Move and 
Aim. Move allows you to move around the map as usual and Aim allows 
manual aiming, while on Aim, return will fire the currently selected 
weapon at the point the crosshhair is on. You cannot shoot yourself. 
Note that explosions caused by some weapons will damage a vehicle in 
the adjacent square.
        Radar is also available in two forms: one is a standard 
radar which shows you the map with any fires that are currently 
buring and any enemies that have been spotted. Your team appears in 
green, enemies are in red and fires are yellow. On some missions 
there may also be a white flashing spot. This is where the current 
objective is. At the bottom of the map screen is information about 
what the current objective is and how much cumulative time has been 
spent in the game. This radar is available by pressing the Help key 
during your turn. The other form of the radar is much more powerful. 
It is accessed by pressing the options button BEFORE YOU MOVE ANY 
VEHCILES. At the top of the screen is a button marked Radar and a text
message stating whether or not the radar is available. It is only 
available provided you haven't moved any vehicles that turn. Pressing 
it does two things: You will be able to see ALL the enemy vehicles 
anywhere on the map. Then it ends your turn as soon as you exit.
           
@endnode

@node WEAPONS "WEAPONS"

        In this Preview, there are 4 weapons available for you to 
use, one of which must first be obtained during one of the missions. 
There are 8 weapons overall, all with their own strengths and 
weakness. Some vechicles can use weapons that others can't, and only 
the DEVASTATOR can use all of the weapons.

        In the main game screen and on the equipment screen, shown 
between missions, you are presented with the weapons currently 
available by a group of numbers indicating their readyness. At the 
start of the game, only 3 weapons are available for use, but this 
number will increase as you travel further into the game.

        A brief description of the weapons follows. The number that
preceeds the weapon name is the number that is used to select it when 
you are playing the game.

@{b}(1) - MACHINE GUN@{ub} - The standard weapon used by all the 
vechicles. It is unlimited, firing rounds of bullets at the target. 
It is a fast, accurate weapon but compared with all the others is 
very weak. A good weapon to use when attacking immobile and 
non-aggressive targets.


@{b}(2) - SHELLS@{ub} - A weapon that is used by the Light Tank, 
Heavy Tank and the Devestator. Shells are very powerful and can 
destroy surrounding obstacles as well as take out the enemy quickly. 
Normal shells can occasionally start fires.

@{b}(3) - ROCKETS@{ub} - These are used by the AKIKIAO fighters, 
TROJANS, Heavy Tanks and the DEVESTATOR. Not as powerful as the 
shells, but still enough to cause an enemy serious amount of damage. 
Normal rockets can take out obstacles and occasionally start fires.

@{b}Note - Normal SHELLS and ROCKETS can be replaced by NAPALM 
versions by simply pressing 0 (ZERO) when they are selected. To switch
back, just press the relevant weapon number again. NAPALM SHELLS and 
ROCKETS *ALLWAYS* start fires on flamable materials. This is not 
always a Good Thing(TM)@{ub}

@{b}(4) - LASER@{ub} - Not much is known about this weapon. What we do
know is that it has limitless ammo, travels through many things and 
overheats quickly. It is also relatively expensive to produce.

@{b}(5) - PLASMA@{ub} - A highpowered bolt that inflicts massive
damage on the target. Like the LASER it is quite expensive to
produce.

@{b}(6) - FREEZE CANNON@{ub} - This weapon does not actually inflict
any damage, but instead freezes a target. When the target is frozen
it cannot move for 1 turn and weaker aliens can also be killed in
one shot when they are frozen. Note that this allies to you as well!!

@{b}(7) - CONCUSSION MISSILE@{ub} - A large and very powerful weapon
that causes major damage to intended target (should it hit!). It
also causes fires to erupt on flamable materials in the region. In
addition to this (yes there's more!), it causes confussion to aliens
within a certain range, making them either attack anyone, each others
or carry on as normal. TANX members in the area will have their fear
increased by 10 points because of this.

@{b}(8) - NEUTRON CANNON@{ub} - Whilst it looks like a normal plasma
shot, Neutron Bombs completely destroy an area. Most aliens will be
killed outright by this weapon and so will any TANX units in the area.
Shielding does not provide that much extra cover as heavy damage will
still be taken and the shields will be destroyed.

@endnode

@node ENEMIES

During the game you will encounter various enemies. Here are some 
brief descriptions of those you will encounter.

@{b}ORGANIC TANK@{ub} - An organic version of the Light Tank. These 
creatures are fast moving, dumb creatures that are not very powerful, 
but can be a serious threat in large numbers. Spits acid, and 
occasionally much larger acid balls that can cause a LOT of damage.

@{b}DIPTERIOUS@{ub} - A flying equivalent of the ORGANIC TANK. Once 
again, they are fast and stupid and should not cause too much of a 
problem. Their ability to move over more terrain than their ORGANIC 
counterparts can make them more of a handful. Spit acid, but do not 
possess the ability to spit large balls.

@{b}ALIEN GUN ENPLACEMENTS@{ub} - Immobile, but a hell of a lot 
stronger and much more deadlier than organic enemies. These guns are 
usually found guarding structures of high importance and will fire 
upon intruders on sight. They fire both bullets and shells and should 
NOT be simply ignored!

@{b}ROYAL GUARD@{ub} - A much tougher, more intelligence, faster and 
more deadlier version of the ORGANIC TANK. These grey creatures are 
specially bred for protecting the Royal Alien Tanks, and are 
determined enough to drive any unworthy challenger back where they 
came.

@{b}LARGER ALIENS@{ub} - There are larger Aliens about, but reports 
are scarce.

@{b}THE CYBERWOLVES@{ub} - Members of the original Alien Extermination
Team, who have been assimilated by the aliens and now work for them. 
Controlling Earth vehicles very much like your own, they are an assett
to the aliens conquest of the planet. The Cyberwolves are TANX 
arch-enemies and encounters are never usually won easily by EITHER 
side. You have been warned...

@endnode

@node EQUIP

@{b}Equiping the Squadron@{ub}

After you have finished a mission, you will return to the Equipment 
screen. On this screen you have the chance to repair your Squadron, 
buy more ammo, replace lost weaponary, buy shields and buy new 
weapons. A status bar at the bottom of the screen shows information. 
Clicking on the bar shows you how much money you have left.

To move between your Team Members, press the left or right buttons 
next to the name line. Clicking in the name line itself will allow you
to change the name.

All the details about that particular member are displayed. This 
includes ARMOUR, SHIELD, MORALE and SKILL. Weaponary and Ammo are
shown on this screen too. Like the game screen, weapons available to 
that vehicle are displayed as small number buttons, at the top of the
screen. Ammunition for that weapon is displayed over the actual weapon
image in the middle of the screen.

There are three main items available to buy. WEAPONS, SHIELDS and 
ARMOUR. Each can be purchased by clicking on their image, or the 
"UNIT" and "AMMO" labels above and below the weapons. When you click 
on a picture of a weapon or the armour or shield, the information bar 
will display how much it costs or what it is. At this point you will 
also be presented with some other options.

A "REPAIR" box will appear when you click on the armour. Click this 
box to repair damage to your vehicle.

Clicking the SHIELD or UNIT label of a weapon will tell you the cost 
of the item and also give you two options - "BUY" and "SELL". Click on
the option of your choice. SELLING an item will only return *half the 
cost* of a new one.

Finally, AMMO will allow you to buy more AMMO for the particular 
weapon. Push the UP and DOWN arrows next to the status bar to BUY or 
SELL the AMMO.

@{i}NOTE - Not all Weaponary and Ammo is available to all vehicles.

@node HINTS

@{b}Gameplay HINTS and TIPS@{ub}

1) Remeber that a wounded alien is just as deadly as one with full
   energy.

2) Don't waste heavy weapons on weak aliens or inanimate objects,
   unless you have to!!

3) When fighting the Cyberwolves, don't mess around! They are very
   intelligent and will take you apart very very quickly. Use your
   most powerful weapons to drive them away. NOTE - Early in the
   game it is not possible to kill the Wolves. They will simply
   escape when seriously threatened.

4) BUY SHIELDS!!

5) The Devestator is a very powerful vehicle, use it for heavy duty
   battles against powerful aliens since it is much more likely to
   survive then anything else.

6) Missions that are classed as Optional, may be a blessing, but
   it is quite likely there is something very useful there.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

@{i}What happened to the faces you were going to use?@{ui}

When they were reduced in resolution they looked very bad, and
I did not have the patience to redraw them myself.

@{i}What did you use for the rendered images?@{ui}

They were rendered in Imagine 4.0 and then altered in PPaint 6.

@{i}Who wrote all the music for the game?@{ui}

Like most other Parallel Realities games, we took the music
from Aminet. Various artists were used, including Bjorn Lynne
of Team 17. As this game is Freeware and they also chose not
to charge for their music it was perfect for us. It is highly
recommended you search Aminet and Magazine CDs for music if you
want to develop a game.

@{i}Can I have the Source Code?@{ui}

Yes, it will be released early 2000. But will remain uncommented!
