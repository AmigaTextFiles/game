                                 Introduction
                                **************

                       	Thank you for trying my program!

	What is this thing? Well awhile back while playing a role playing 
game, name doesn't matter, I failed to locate my bag of dice. Well there was 
this beige box sitting on my desk doing NOTHING. Then I recalled a short
program I wrote on my C-64, remember them? That would solve the problem.
Being as the 64 was packed up in a box somewhere I sat down to  write one on
the Amiga. So basicly what this is, is a dice rolling program.

	Well the first one that made to a working condition (DieV101.lha
on aminet) was pretty rough. This is the result of hammering over the code.
Adding a few things to make it more useful and such.

    This document assumes some familarity with the various gadget types and 
general knowledge about the way the Amiga works. If you are unclear about any
of this then please consult your manual that came with the machine.

	The gadgets labeled Four, Six ... Percent, will roll a die with that
many sides on it. Example, pressing the gadget labeled 'Four' will roll a
four sided die, the number on the 'N Rolls' @{" Slider " Link "Sliders"} times.

	The 'User' Gadget will roll a die with the number on the 'Sides' 
@{" Slider " Link "Slider"} sides, the number on the 'N Rolls' @{" Slider " Link "Sliders"} times. Example, if the 
'Sides' @{" Slider " Link "Slider"} is set at 13, default, and the 'N Rolls' @{" Slider " Link "Slider"} is set at 1, 
One thirteen sided die will be rolled.

	The gadget labeled 'Clear' will clear the Total(s) and Roll(s)
@{" ListView " Link "ListView"} gadgets. Pressing the 'c' key will have the same effect.


	The 'Close' gadget will terminate the program.

                               ****************

	The 'Modifier' slider will determine the amount, if any, to be 
applied to the total roll. (ex. you set the program to roll three
six sided die, it will roll the three die and then apply the modifier
according to the action gadget above it.)

	The 'N Rolls' slider will determine the number of rolls for the 
slider gadget cluster and the preset gadgets above them. Range 1-60.

	The 'Sides' slider will determine the number of sides on the user-
defined die. Range 1-300.

	The 'Min Roll' slider will determine the lowest acceptable roll,
while the program calculates this internaly it will ignore bogus 
settings, e.g. setting minimum roll to 10 on a one sided die will be
quietly ignored. I suppose this is one area that could use some 
enhancement such as setting the range of the gadget according to the
rest of the group, let me know if you want this..

"Roll(s)" in this one is displayed the current rolls seperated by a bar.
The other one is labeled "Total(s)" in this one the running totals are
displayed.

	At this time they are a read-only gadget.
