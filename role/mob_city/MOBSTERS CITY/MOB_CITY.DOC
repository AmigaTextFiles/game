   AND NOW...................THE STORY



   It was a cold windy night in Poosford,  on the outskirts of  Mobsters 

   City.  In  this town stood the Wetfish police headquarters,  a  large 

   building contructed with the finest lego.



   Detective  Sargent Silly was singing in his bath whilst  playing  the 

   banjo  overlooking a basket of vipers doing the conga  when  suddenly 

   the phone rang. Jumping out of the bath D S Silly grabbed the nearest 

   towel to cover his expenses,  and skipped along to the  phone.  Still 

   dripping  with  water and baby oil,  he raised the  receiver  to  his 

   earhole and said........."Hello!"



   "Hello fluffykins"........boomed a voice from the other end. "Its me, 

   your fat moaning smelly boss. I have a job for you.".



   "Oh goodie poos"....cries D S Silly, "I could do with some  work. My 

    landlady wants her money and I've run out of sweeties.".  He  grabs 

    his clothes and rushes over to Wetfish Police headquarters.

 

   Parking  his car in a nearby tramps vest he enters the  building  and 

   takes  the  lift up to the top floor.  When he enters the  office  he 

   notices  the boss shouting abuse at a turnip.  Upon seeing D S  Silly 

   the boss turns and sits at his desk and picks up his knitting.

 

   "You wanted to see me sir" exclaims D S Silly.



   "Yes"  said the boss.  "I have a job for you.  I want you to  go  and 

   clean up Mobsters City."



   "Certainly sir" replies D S Silly, "errm, what do I do"?



   "The city is overrun by some of the lowest scum in our society"  says 

   the boss.  "Scum such as gangsters and Amiga users.  We know that the 

   operation  is controlled by the big boss but we can't find  him.  But 

   one  of  our  detectives have heard that each of  the  twelve  wanted 

   gangsters carries part of a map showing the way to his hideout."



   "So where do I fit it boss" asked D S Silly?

 

   "I  want you to find the gangsters and kill them",  replys the  boss. 

   "Once you have collected the 12 pieces of map showing where the  boss 

   is,  I want you to arrest him and put him behind bars. Only then will 

   the city be free from worry."



   "Okay boss" exclaims D S Silly....."I'll go after Playschool".



   "GO NOW" growls the boss, and don't fail.



   With an heavy heart and a clean change of underwear, D S Silly leaves 

   the  office and goes back to his car only to find  it  stolen.  After 

   saying some very naughty words he catches a taxi to the city.

   BIG BOSS:



   You can only go here if you have all twelve pieces of map.



   There are other places you can go to as well,  note that if you click

   give you information while some just talk silly.  Move the mouse over 

   the  text  to say something to that character and click on  the  text 

   see their answer.



   SHOOTOUT:



   As mentioned before, when you enter the pub there will sometimes be a 

   gangster in there.  If one is found then you will be given the option 

   to  challenge him.  If you decide to do so you will be asked who  you 

   think he is.  Get the name wrong and you will be arrested for  murder 

   should  you  shoot  him.   The  message  before  will  give  you  his 

   description and you name him according to his description.  So if you

   think  Sean Silly is the man who limps with his left leg then  select 

   his name.

 

   Once the name is selected you go to the back of the pub to face  each 

   other.  Wait till he draws then press either the left mouse button to 

   shoot him if you have bullets or right mouse button to blow him up if 

   you have grenades........you only get one chance.  After shooting him 

   you take him to the police who will either reward you or throw you in 

   jail depending on if you got his name right.
