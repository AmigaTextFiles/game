Yes I wish to register GRAAL. In exchange for my money, I will receive
a personal keyfile enabling me to use GPRO to encrypt and compress my
game files.

I enclose one of the following amounts, in cash, well concealed in
a sturdy envelope:


           o  SEK 150 (Swedish Crowns)

           o  £ 15    (British Pounds)

           o  $ 25    (U.S. Dollars)

           o  DM 40   (German Marks)


Note that developing games using GRAAL requires a hard drive, Workbench 2
or better, and preferrably 2MB of RAM or more. Fast RAM and an accelerator
is strongly recommended. (But then, aren't they always??)
