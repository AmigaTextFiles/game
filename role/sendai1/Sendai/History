==========
KNOWN BUGS
==========
	Certain computers may fail to run this game. It may have

something to do with memory, 1 Meg being the apparent cutoff point.

I'll need more info on this bug before I know for sure what 

configurations will trigger it.

	This is a problem with AMOS, not Sendai per se, but I'll list it

here in case anyone doesn't know about it. AMOS screens won't work

on VGA monitors, and they cannot be mode promoted. The only solution

is to alter the scan rate on the hardware level using a flickerfixer or

scan doubler. Sorry.

	The save game routine is unsafe on AFS disks prior to

version 16.16. If this includes your HD, try playing from a FFS floppy,

or update your version of AFS.
