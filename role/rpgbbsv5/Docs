--=:)) RPGBBS V5.x ((:=--
      -------------
First release: August 28, 1992
 This release: February 20, 1993

This is a standalone BBS program to play a Role Playing Game.  It is a very
addicting game to those people who are familiar with D&D style of play.
User interaction, mixed with intelligent computer opponents, makes this BBS
unique and popular to call.  Everyone gets tired of message bases,
networks, nodes, file uploads & downloads.  Most people want fun from their
computers.  Why not play games with other people?  Let your keyboard be
your joystick and your modem be your game cartridge!  Go kill a monster or
another user.  Joust for gold and glory.  Rob another user.  Pick pockets
in the Square.  Buy a naval warship and hunt sea monsters or sink another
user's ship.  Create a gang of users to party against another gang or the
fearful Monster Mash.  Drop into a dungeon and explore your way to
adventure.  Or, drink beer in the Tavern and start a brawl amongst the
other players.  Sure, there is even E-mail and a message base for
communicating and posting, but the real fun is beating up players, taking
their possessions, and hoarding gold!  This demo version is fully playable.
The only difference is that you become Immortal upon reaching level 30
instead of level 100.  Levels 30-99 are v-e-r-y interesting as magic users
become more powerful and fighting classes get tougher.

RPGBBS can run using any Commodore Amiga hardware configuration with a
Hayes compatible program.  Among hardware tested, an Amiga 3000 under
WB2.04/2.1 and a Supra2400, SupraFAX 14.4, and a Practical Peripherals 9600
modems were used.  RPGBBS supports 99 levels, 200 users, 50 gangs.  The
demo version only 29 levels of play.  The message bases hold a specified
amount of messages.  The software multitasks very well, as it is event-
driven and demands very little CPU power at a clip.  The program was
written in SAS/C v6.2 (the only language for Amiga!)

There is ONLINE documentation in the Help & Hints section.  Read them all for
game play instructions!!!

Sysops can access their menu from the pulldown option Sysop or Right-Amiga-S.
From remote locations, King and Queen level users can type an @ at the Main
Menu to get into the Sysop menu.  Access levels determines the user's ability
to use the game features.

To configure RPGBBS:

    Copy the Venus font to your System FONTS directory.  This font is necessary
    for the local, custom screen.

    Copy noisy.library to your System LIBS directory.  Any IFF sound file named
    Chat.snd will be played whenever a user requests chat.  Press the ESCape
    key to toggle chat mode.

	All files created prior to version 5 are not compatible ! ! !

    RPGBBS.hof file contains Hall Of Fame information for top-notch users.  If
    this file does not exist, a new one gets created.
