Classes define the nature and tendacies of a given character.  A Fighter will
generally hit harder than a Magician, but the Magician may clap his hands and
and send perilous thunder upon his opponent.  What character class you select
has a heavy impact on your game play.  They are as follows:

-=> Alchemist <=-
This character depends greatly on his ability to use poisons.  His skills
enable him to apply 4x the posion value yielding the greatest effect on his
weapon.  Without that aid, the alchemist leaves much to be desired as far as
natural fighting skills is concerned.  Being a creature of science, this is
the one class that cannot use any magical powers or wands.  The alchemist may,
however, resist the effects of a spell or magical device.  Alchemists
receive an extra bonus in Intellect per experience level.

-=> Assassin <=-
A ninja-style fighter, the assassin has extra fighting ability making him
tough to defeat.  With the use of poisons and backstabs, the assassin will
usually have enough firepower to defeat any fighting class.  Assassins receive
an extra bonus in Agility per experience level.

-=> Barbarian <=-
The strongest, combat-class fighter in the game, but the most susceptible to
the effects of magic.  As the Barbarian grows in experience, his hitting power
augments.  There will be a point where a Barbarian's essence can match the
power of any man-made weapon.  Barbarians recieve an extra bonus in Stamina per
experience level.

-=> Bard <=-
The Bard-class enjoys every aspect of the game: backstabbing, magic, stealing,
and fighting.  However, the bard does not specialize in any of his abilities,
thus his experiences can be either rewarding or frustrating.  An entertainer
by trade, Bards receive an extra bonus in Charisma per experience level.

-=> Beast <=-
Beasts hit like a Barbarian, but have the extra ability of using a magic scroll
to some degree.  A beast may also backstab an opponent.  The Beast class only
receives +5 in Stamina per experience level.

-=> Cleric <=-
A Cleric has good combat and magic abilities.  His ability to Heal is stronger
than his ability to Blast.  Clerics get to use poisons cheaply, but not too
effectively.  Clerics receive an extra bonus in Charisma per experience level.

-=> Fighter <=-
Fighters are excellent killers.  Their extraordinary combat ability makes them
difficult opponents.  Though their class has no extra abilities, there are no
extra penalties levied against them either.  Fighters receive an extra bonus in
Stamina per experience level.

-=> Jester <=-
Jesters are annoying pests.  They lack serious hand-to-hand combat power, but
their acrobatic-like abilities gives them edge in dodging attacks.  Jesters
also possess some magic, backstabbing, and thieving abilities.  Jesters receive
an extra bonus in Charisma per experience level.

-=> Lizard <=-
Lizards use poison almost as effectively as an Alchemist, but hit harder.
Although a Lizard cannot backstab, they still have good ability to steal.
Lizards only receive +2 in both Stamina and Agility per experience level.

-=> Magician <=-
The Magician is the opposite of the Fighter; powerful magic opposed to combat
abilities.  Magicians can consistently cast spells effectively and yield better
results.  Magicians receive an extra bonus in Intellect per experience level.

-=> Ranger <=-
Rangers are great survivors, because they must depend on their ability to live
off the land.  Like Bards, they have many special abilities, though they do not
excel at any particular one.  Their fighting and healing powers are among their
best abilities.  Rangers receive an extra bonus in Intellect per experience
level.

-=> Rogue <=-
A Rogue is similar to a Thief class: good backstab, poison, and stealing.  But,
their advantage lies in their effective use of magic scrolls.  Rogues get only
the usual +1 in all abilities per experience level.

-=> Sage <=-
The weakest combat-class is the Sage.  His hand-to-hand abilities leave much to
be desired, but as the Sage grows in experience, his spell casting abilities
can dominate any class, mortal or divine.  Sages receive an extra bonus in
Intellect per experience level.

-=> Thief <=-
The Thief class relies on its ability to stealth approach an enemy and deliver
a powerful backstab.  Without it, the Thief is quite ordinary.  Other abilities
include the use of poisons and robbing other users more effectively.  Thieves
chief ability is Agility and therefore receive an extra bonus in Agility per
experience level.

-=> Undead <=-
Undead creatures are as excellent fighters as they are in magic.  However, they
do not move as fast and are more susceptible to magic used against them.  The
Undead only receives +5 Stamina per experience level.

-=> Hero <=-
A Hero class can only be achieved by becoming immortal (100th level) and
solving the Ancient Riddle of the Keys.  A Hero is the lowest class of the
superbeings.  Heros have Barbarian combat abilities coupled with a Bard's use
of magic scrolls.  Heros receive an extra bonus in all abilities per experience
level.

-=> Titan <=-
You can only ascend to a Titan class from immortalizing a Hero class and again
solving the Ancient Riddle of the Keys.  A Titan is the second class of the
superbeings.  Titans have Barbarian combat abilities coupled with a Magician's
use of spells.  They get greater backstabs and use of poisons than the Hero.
Titans receive two extra bonuses in all abilities per experience level.

-=> God <=-
The highest superbeing of them all, you can only ascend to a God from a Titan
class.  Gods have what is best in all of the classes: a Barbarian's strength,
spell-casting power of a Sage, a Thief's backstab, an Alchemist's use of his
poisons.  A God receives three extra bonuses in all abilities per experience
level.
