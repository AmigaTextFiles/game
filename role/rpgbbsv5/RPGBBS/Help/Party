Successful partying can increase your experience points rapidly as well as
obtaining gold.  You may either start your own gang and optionally invite other
players to join your gang, join a gang that needs any member or one that has
specifically invited you.  Gang wars adds to the enjoyment of this game and
everyone's participation is expected.

A simple way to calculate your chances of defeating a gang, though there are no
guarantees, is to add up your gang members' experience levels (1-99) and then
compare that result to another gang's experience levels.  If your result is
greater than theirs, you have a better chance of defeating them.  This does not
take into account your members' weapon, armor, strength, and agility versus the
opponents'.  You may find that you can defeat a superior gang in experience
levels, should one or more of their members been 'stripped' of their weapon and
armor.  Take the necessary time to scout out the opposition before making your
attempt to defeat them.
