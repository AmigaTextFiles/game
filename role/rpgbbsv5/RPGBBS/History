                      use them to augment their real characters.  There are a
                      lot of cheaters who can't play by the rules, thus the

                      in BadPhone.list to mark unwanted dialbacks.

                    * Riddle of Key sequence remains same for rolling user
                      until it is solved to advance to Hero.  It gets reset if
                      System Reroll or Hero does not advance to Titan.

                    * Defense agility was not taken in account properly!
                    * Key Hint works properly now.
                    * Brawl algorithm calculates for character class now.
                      This is to account for Beast & Undead class that get no
                      + agility bonus.  Magic users (again) get screwed, but
                      it goes with the flow.  Defense agility calculated in.
                    * Robbing the bank properly alerts users-with-Bank-money
