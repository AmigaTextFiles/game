Note: this a very early beta version of nethack 3.2.2 for AmigaOS.
This is the seventh public beta.
Please report all problems to
   stieber@informatik.tu-muenchen.de
Suggestions and comments are welcome, too.

Known bugs:
- CTRL-C during tile-loading leads to crash
- Message window: sometimes the string gadget cursor remains visible
  (apparently after the gadget was covered), or after activating/deactivating
- open windows (inventory) won't pick up changes from tiles to tty and
  vice versa
- recover mode is not completely sound --- unexpected results can occur
  if an error/crash happens during recovery
- occasional crashes
- message window scroll problem
- ZEROCOMP doesn't work --- for some reason nethack can't read it's own
  savefiles if ZEROCOMP is compiled in; so I leave it disabled for now.
- sometimes colors seem to be wrong
- record file doesn't work

Not tested:
- TERMCAP support
- V37 support

Changes since beta-7 (probably incomplete):
- scaling for "who are you?" images, to make nethack start on small screens
- quest levels now included in distribution :-)
- text windows no longer get a minimum width
- fixed a bug in ScreenSupport.library, which caused trashed gfx if the screen had
  more colors than the image file. Don't know why it works now, though --- some
  functions in graphics.library have bad documentation.

Missing features:
- icons with two images
- scores option should be acessible from tooltypes
- Scores icon
- external utility to create icons
- the error message "NetHack is only available in english" should be available
  in as many languages as possible (except english, of course). Currently only
  "deutsch" is available.
- get rid of "map window scrolling" effect during level change
- background for message window
- LEVELDIR to set directory for level files
- sound volume control
- xpk compression on dlb members
- config program
- error messages
- docs
- utility to convert *.aiff -> *.8svx
[ - make it non-MUI ]

Ideas:
- allow pickup from PermLook window
- allow basic functions from PermInvent window
- password protection
- allow several map windows. In this case it makes sense to add scaling as well,
  so we can use one of the map windows as "overview" window.

Misc:
- better realname and character name handling, if names are different
  but yield the same filenames... partially implemented already

probably Nethack bugs:
- count doesn't work for "single object" inventories (such as d?)
- shopkeeper doesn't charge you for Engraving with a magic marker
- lots of complaints about being to unable to open the record file, if there
  is no record file and player enters the valley -:) (NEW_AMIGA fixes this)

probably MUI bugs:
- left mouse button always initiates drag&drop
  (confirmed by Stefan: ignoring the prefs is a "feature")
- borderscrollers cause a lot of weird problems -> investigate
- lock on CurrentDir() kept by muimaster.library
