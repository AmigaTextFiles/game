  Important notes:

    Tiles
     The Guidebook is, unfortunately, not quite up to date. In
     particular, it only talks about tty mode, which is something that
     only extra-conservative nethack users want to use.

    Amiga
     Since my AmigaOS port is not the official port, all references to
     "Amiga" in this Guidebook refer to the old port. Just ignore
     them.

@NODE Node1 "NetHack Guidebook: Introduction"

                                @{b}Introduction@{ub}


  Having exhausted your own meager financial resources, as well as those
  of your parents, you find that you must end your formal education.  Your
  lack of experience and skills leaves you facing a pretty grim future.
  You could look for some sort of menial job and hope to perform well
  enough to be noticed and perhaps rise in responsibilities until you were
  earning enough money to be comfortable.  Or you could set out into the
  world and make your livelihood by prospecting, stealing, crusading, or
  just plain killing, for your gold.  Over the objections of your local
  guildmaster, you opt to follow the adventuring route.  After all, when
  adventurers came back this way they usually seemed better off than when
  they passed through the first time.  And who was to say that all of
  those who did not return had not just kept going?

  Asking around, you hear about a bauble, called the Amulet of Yendor by
  some, which, if you can find it, will bring you great wealth.  One
  legend you were told even mentioned that the one who finds the amulet
  will be granted immortality by the gods.  The amulet is rumored to be
  somewhere beyond the Valley of Gehennom, deep within the Mazes of
  Menace.  You decide that even if the rumors of the amulet's powers are
  untrue, and even if it won't cure the common plague, you should at least
  be able to sell the tales of your adventures to the local minstrels for
  a tidy sum.  You spend one last night fortifying yourself at the local
  inn, becoming more and more depressed as you watch the odds of your
  success being posted on the inn's walls getting lower and lower.  In the
  morning you awake, gather together your belongings, and set off on your
  adventure...

  Your abilities and strengths for dealing with the hazards of adventure
  will vary with your background and training.

  @{i}Archeologists@{ui} understand dungeons pretty well; this enables them to move
  quickly and sneak up on the local nasties.  They start equipped with the
  tools for a proper scientific expedition.

  @{i}Barbarians@{ui} are warriors out of the hinterland, hardened to battle.  They
  begin their quests with naught but uncommon strength, a trusty hauberk,
  and a great two-handed sword.

  @{i}Cavemen@{ui} and @{i}Cavewomen@{ui} start with exceptional strength but,
  unfortunately, with neolithic weapons.

  @{i}Elves@{ui} are agile, quick, and sensitive; very little of what goes on will
  escape an Elf.  The quality of Elven craftsmanship often gives them an
  advantage in arms and armor.

  @{i}Healers@{ui} are wise in medicine and apothecary.  They know the herbs and
  simples that can restore vitality, ease pain, anesthetize, and
  neutralize poisons; and with their instruments, they can divine a
  being's state of health or sickness.  Their medical practice earns them
  quite reasonable amounts of money, with which they enter the dungeon.

  @{i}Knights@{ui} are distinguished from the common skirmisher by their devotion
  to the ideals of chivalry and by the surpassing excellence of their
  armor.

  @{i}Priests@{ui} and @{i}Priestesses@{ui} are clerics militant, crusaders advancing the
  cause of righteousness with arms, armor, and arts thaumaturgic.  Their
  ability to commune with deities via prayer occasionally extricates them
  from peril, but can also put them in it.

  @{i}Rogues@{ui} are agile and stealthy thieves, with knowledge of locks, traps,
  and poisons.  Their advantage lies in surprise, which they employ to
  great advantage.

  @{i}Samurai@{ui} are the elite warriors of feudal Nippon.  They are lightly
  armored and quick, and wear the @{i}dai-sho@{ui}, two swords of the deadliest
  keenness.

  @{i}Tourists@{ui} start out with lots of gold (suitable for shopping with), a
  credit card, lots of food, some maps, and an expensive camera.  Most
  monsters don't like being photographed.

  @{i}Valkyries@{ui} are hardy warrior women.  Their upbringing in the harsh
  Northlands makes them strong, inures them to extremes of cold, and
  instills in them stealth and cunning.

  @{i}Wizards@{ui} start out with a knowledge of magic, a selection of magical
  items, and a particular affinity for dweomercraft.  Although seemingly
  weak and easy to overcome at first sight, an experienced Wizard is a
  deadly foe.

  You set out for the dungeon and after several days of uneventful travel
  you see the ancient ruins that mark the entrance to the Mazes of Menace.
  It is late at night, so you make camp at the entrance and spend the
  night sleeping under the open skies.  In the morning, you gather your
  gear, eat what may be your last meal outside, and enter the dungeon.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Node2 "NetHack Guidebook: What is going on here?"

                           @{b}What is going on here?@{ub}


  You have just begun a game of NetHack.  Your goal is to grab as much
  treasure as you can, retrieve the Amulet of Yendor, and escape the Mazes
  of Menace alive.  On the screen is kept a map of where you have been and
  what you have seen on the current dungeon level; as you explore more of
  the level, it appears on the screen in front of you.

  When NetHack's ancestor @{i}rogue@{ui} first appeared, its screen orientation was
  almost unique among computer fantasy games.  Since then, screen
  orientation has become the norm rather than the exception; NetHack
  continues this fine tradition.  Unlike text adventure games that accept
  commands in pseudo-English sentences and explain the results in words,
  NetHack commands are all one or two keystrokes and the results are
  displayed graphically on the screen.  A minimum screen size of 24 lines
  by 80 columns is recommended; if the screen is larger, only a 21x80
  section will be used for the map.

  NetHack generates a new dungeon every time you play it; even the authors
  still find it an entertaining and exciting game despite having won
  several times.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Node3 "NetHack Guidebook: What do all those things on the screen mean?"

                @{b}What do all those things on the screen mean?@{ub}


  NetHack offers a variety of display options.  The options available to
  you will vary from port to port, depending on the capabilities of your
  hardware and software, and whether various compile-time options were
  enabled when your executable was created.  The three possible display
  options are: a monochrome character interface, a color character
  interface, and a graphical interface using small pictures called tiles.
  The two character interfaces allow fonts with other characters to be
  substituted, but the default assignments use standard ASCII characters
  to represent everything.  There is no difference between the various
  display options with respect to game play.  Because we cannot reproduce
  the tiles or colors in the Guidebook, and because it is common to all
  ports, we will use the default ASCII characters from the monochrome
  character display when referring to things you might see on the screen
  during your game.

  In order to understand what is going on in NetHack, first you must
  understand what NetHack is doing with the screen.  The NetHack screen
  replaces the ``You see ...'' descriptions of text adventure games.
  Figure 1 is a sample of what a NetHack screen might look like.

@NODE Node4 "NetHack Guidebook: The status lines (bottom)"

                         @{b}The status lines (bottom)@{ub}


  The bottom two lines of the screen contain several cryptic pieces of
  information describing your current status.  If either status line
  becomes longer than the width of the screen, you might not see all of
  it.  Here are explanations of what the various status items mean (though
  your configuration may not have all the status items listed below):

    Rank  
     Your character's name and professional ranking (based on the
     experience level, see below).

    Strength
     A measure of your character's strength; one of your six basic
     attributes.  Your attributes can range from 3 to 18 inclusive
     (occasionally you may get super-strengths of the form 18/xx).
     The higher your strength, the stronger you are.  Strength affects
     how successfully you perform physical tasks, how much damage you
     do in combat, and how much loot you can carry.

    Dexterity
     Dexterity affects your chances to hit in combat, to avoid traps,
     and do other tasks requiring agility or manipulation of objects.

    Constitution
     Constitution affects your ability to recover from injuries and
     other strains on your stamina.

    Intelligence
     Intelligence affects your ability to cast spells and read
     spellbooks.

    Wisdom
     Wisdom comes from your practical experience (especially when
     dealing with magic).  It affects your magical energy.

    Charisma
     Charisma affects how certain creatures react toward you.  In
     particular, it can affect the prices shopkeepers offer you.

    Alignment
     @{b}Lawful@{ub}, @{b}Neutral@{ub}, or @{b}Chaotic@{ub}.  Often, Lawful is good and Chaotic
     is evil.  Your alignment influences how other monsters react
     toward you.  Monsters of a like alignment are more likely to be
     non-aggressive, while those of an opposing alignment are more
     likely to be seriously offended at your presence.

    Dungeon Level
     How deep you are in the dungeon.  You start at level one and the
     number increases as you go deeper into the dungeon.  Some levels
     are special, and are identified by a name and not a number.  The
     Amulet of Yendor is reputed to be somewhere beneath the twentieth
     level.

    Gold  
     The number of gold pieces you are openly carrying.  Gold which
     you have concealed in containers is not counted.

    Hit Points
     Your current and maximum hit points.  Hit points indicate how
     much damage you can take before you die.  The more you get hit in
     a fight, the lower they get.  You can regain hit points by
     resting, or by using certain magical items or spells.  The number
     in parentheses is the maximum number your hit points can reach.

    Power
     Spell points.  This tells you how much mystic energy (@{i}mana@{ui}) you
     have available for spell casting.  Again, resting will regenerate
     the amount available.

    Armor Class
     A measure of how effectively your armor stops blows from
     unfriendly creatures.  The lower this number is, the more
     effective the armor; it is quite possible to have negative armor
     class.

    Experience
     Your current experience level and experience points.  As you
     adventure, you gain experience points.  At certain experience
     point totals, you gain an experience level.  The more experienced
     you are, the better you fight and withstand magical attacks.
     Many dungeons show only your experience level here.

    Time  
     The number of turns elapsed so far, displayed if you have the
     @{u}time@{uu} option set.

    Hunger status
     Your current hunger status, ranging from @{b}Satiated@{ub} down to
     @{b}Fainting@{ub}.  If your hunger status is normal, it is not displayed.

  Additional status flags may appear after the hunger status: @{b}Conf@{ub} when
  you're confused, @{b}FoodPois@{ub} or @{b}Ill@{ub} when sick, @{b}Blind@{ub} when you can't see,
  @{b}Stun@{ub} when stunned, and @{b}Hallu@{ub} when hallucinating.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Node5 "NetHack Guidebook: The message line (top)"

                           @{b}The message line (top)@{ub}


  The top line of the screen is reserved for messages that describe things
  that are impossible to represent visually.  If you see a ``@{b}--More--@{ub}'' on
  the top line, this means that NetHack has another message to display on
  the screen, but it wants to make certain that you've read the one that
  is there first.  To read the next message, just press the space bar.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Node6 "NetHack Guidebook: The map (rest of the screen)"

                        @{b}The map (rest of the screen)@{ub}


  The rest of the screen is the map of the level as you have explored it
  so far.  Each symbol on the screen represents something.  You can set
  various graphics options to change some of the symbols the game uses;
  otherwise, the game will use default symbols.  Here is a list of what
  the default symbols mean:

    - and |
     The walls of a room, or an open door.

    .
     The floor of a room, ice, or a doorless doorway.

    #
     A corridor, or possibly a kitchen sink (if your dungeon has
     sinks) or drawbridge.

    <
     A way to the previous level.

    >
     A way to the next level.

    +
     A closed door, or a spell book containing a spell you can learn.

    @
     A human (you, usually).

    $
     A pile of gold.

    ^
     A trap (once you detect it).

    )
     A weapon.

    [
     A suit or piece of armor.

    %
     Something edible (not necessarily healthy).

    ?
     A scroll.

    /
     A wand.

    =
     A ring.

    !
     A potion.

    (
     A useful item (pick-axe, key, lamp...).

    "
     An amulet (or a spider web).

    *
     A gem or rock (possibly valuable, possibly worthless).

    `
     A boulder or statue.

    0
     An iron ball.

    _
     An altar, or an iron chain.

    }
     A pool of water or moat or a pool of lava.

    {
     A fountain.

    \\
     An opulent throne.

    a-zA-Z and other symbols
     Letters and certain other symbols represent the various
     inhabitants of the Mazes of Menace.  Watch out, they can be nasty
     and vicious.  Sometimes, however, they can be helpful.

  You need not memorize all these symbols; you can ask the game what any
  symbol represents with the `/' command (see the Commands section for
  more info).

@ENDNODE

@NODE Node7 "NetHack Guidebook: Commands"

                                  @{b}Commands@{ub}


  Commands are initiated by typing one or two characters.  Some commands,
  like ``search'', do not require that any more information be collected
  by NetHack.  Other commands might require additional information, for
  example a direction, or an object to be used.  For those commands that
  require additional information, NetHack will present you with either a
  menu of choices or with a command line prompt requesting information.
  Which you are presented with will depend chiefly on how you have set the
  @{u}menustyle@{uu} option.

  For example, a common question, in the form ``What do you want to use?
  [a-zA-Z ?*]'', asks you to choose an object you are carrying.  Here,
  ``a-zA-Z'' are the inventory letters of your possible choices.  Typing
  `?' gives you an inventory list of these items, so you can see what each
  letter refers to.  In this example, there is also a `*' indicating that
  you may choose an object not on the list, if you wanted to use something
  unexpected.  Typing a `*' lists your entire inventory, so you can see
  the inventory letters of every object you're carrying.  Finally, if you
  change your mind and decide you don't want to do this command after all,
  you can press the ESC key to abort the command.

  You can put a number before most commands to repeat them that many
  times; for example, ``10s'' will search ten times.  If you have the
  @{u}number_pad@{uu} option set, you must type `n' to prefix a count, so the
  example above would be typed ``n10s'' instead.  Commands for which
  counts make no sense ignore them.  In addition, movement commands can be
  prefixed for greater control (see below).  To cancel a count or a
  prefix, press the ESC key.

  The list of commands is rather long, but it can be read at any time
  during the game through the `?' command, which accesses a menu of
  helpful texts.  Here are the commands for your reference:

    ?
     Help menu: display one of several help texts available.

    /
     Tell what a symbol represents.  You may choose to specify a
     location or type a symbol (or even a whole word) to define.  If
     the @{u}help@{uu} option is on, and NetHack has some special information
     about an object or monster that you looked at, you'll be asked if
     you want ``More info?''.  If @{b}help@{ub} is off, then you'll only get
     the special information if you explicitly ask for it by typing in
     the name of the monster or object.

    &
     Tell what a command does.

    <
     Go up to the previous level (if you are on the staircase or
     ladder).

    >
     Go down to the next level (if you are on the staircase or
     ladder).

    [yuhjklbn]
     Go one step in the direction indicated (see Figure 2).  If there
     is a monster there, you will fight the monster instead.  Only
     these one-step movement commands cause you to fight monsters; the
     others (below) are ``safe.''
                       y  k  u        7  8  9         
                        \\ | /          \\ | /          
                       h- . -l        4- . -6         
                        / | \\          / | \\          
                       b  j  n        1  2  3         
                               (if @{b}number_pad@{ub} is set) 
                                  Figure 2


    [YUHJKLBN]
     Go in that direction until you hit a wall or run into something.

    m[yuhjklbn]
     Prefix: move without picking up any objects.

    M[yuhjklbn]
     Prefix: move far, no pickup.

    g[yuhjklbn]
     Prefix: move until something interesting is found.

    G[yuhjklbn] or <CONTROL->[yuhjklbn]
     Prefix: same as `g', but forking of corridors is not considered
     interesting.

    .
     Rest, do nothing for one turn.

    a
     Apply (use) a tool (pick-axe, key, lamp...).

    A
     Remove one or more worn items, such as armor.  Use `T' (take off)
     to take off only one piece of armor or `R' (remove) to take off
     only one accessory.

    ^A
     Redo the previous command.

    c
     Close a door.

    C
     Call (name) an individual monster.

    ^C
     Panic button.  Quit the game.

    d
     Drop something.  Ex. ``d7a'' means drop seven items of object @{i}a@{ui}.

    D
     Drop several things.  In answer to the question ``What kinds of
     things do you want to drop? [!%= au]'' you should type zero or
     more object symbols possibly followed by `a' and/or `u'.

     Da  - drop all objects, without asking for confirmation.
     Du  - drop only unpaid objects (when in a shop).
     D%u - drop only unpaid food.

    ^D
     Kick something (usually a door).

    e
     Eat food.

    E
     Engrave a message on the floor.  Engraving the word ``Elbereth''
     will cause most monsters to not attack you hand-to-hand (but if
     you attack, you will rub it out); this is often useful to give
     yourself a breather.  (This feature may be compiled out of the
     game, so your version might not have it.)

     E- - write in the dust with your fingers.  

    i
     List your inventory (everything you're carrying).

    I
     List selected parts of your inventory.

     Perform an extended command.  As you can see, the authors of
     NetHack used up all the letters, so this is a way to introduce
     the less useful commands, or commands used under limited
     circumstances.  You may obtain a list of them by entering `?'.
     What extended commands are available depends on what features the
     game was compiled with.

  If your keyboard has a meta key (which, when pressed in combination with
  another key, modifies it by setting the `meta' [8th, or `high'] bit),
  you can invoke the extended commands by meta-ing the first letter of the
  command.  In OS/2, PC, and ST NetHack, the `Alt' key can be used in this
  fashion; on the Amiga set the @{u}altmeta@{uu} option to get this behavior.

    M-a
     Adjust inventory letters (most useful when the @{u}fixinv@{uu} option is
     ``on'').

    M-c
     Talk to someone.

    M-d
     Dip an object into something.

    M-e
     Advance or check weapons skills.

    M-f
     Force a lock.

    M-i
     Invoke an object's special powers.

    M-j
     Jump to another location.

    M-l
     Loot a box on the floor.

    M-m
     Use a monster's special ability.

    M-n
     Name an item or type of object.

    M-o
     Offer a sacrifice to the gods.

    M-p
     Pray to the gods for help.

    M-r
     Rub a lamp.

    M-s
     Sit down.

    M-t
     Turn undead.

    M-u
     Untrap something (trap, door, or chest).

    M-v
     Print compile time options for this version of NetHack.

    M-w
     Wipe off your face.

  If the @{u}number_pad@{uu} option is on, some additional letter commands are
  available:

    j
     Jump to another location.  Same as ``#jump'' or ``M-j''.

    k
     Kick something (usually a door).  Same as `^D'.

    l
     Loot a box on the floor.  Same as ``#loot'' or ``M-l''.

    N
     Name an item or type of object.  Same as ``#name'' or ``M-N''.

  Rooms and corridors in the dungeon are either lit or dark.  Any lit
  areas within your line of sight will be displayed; dark areas are only
  displayed if they are within one space of you.  Walls and corridors

  Secret corridors are hidden.  You can find them with the `s' (search)

  Doorways connect rooms and corridors.  Some doorways have no doors; you
  can walk right through.  Others have doors in them, which may be open,
  closed, or locked.  To open a closed door, use the `o' (open) command;
  to close it again, use the `c' (close) command.

  You can get through a locked door by using a tool to pick the lock with
  the `a' (apply) command, or by kicking it open with the `^D' (kick)
  command.

  Open doors cannot be entered diagonally; you must approach them straight
  on, horizontally or vertically.  Doorways without doors are not
  restricted in this fashion.

  Doors can be useful for shutting out monsters.  Most monsters cannot
  open doors, although a few don't need to (ex. ghosts can walk through
  doors).

  Secret doors are hidden.  You can find them with the `s' (search)
  command.  Once found they are in all ways equivalent to normal doors.

  There are traps throughout the dungeon to snare the unwary delver.  For
  example, you may suddenly fall into a pit and be stuck for a few turns
  trying to climb out.  Traps don't appear on your map until you see one
  triggered by moving onto it, see something fall into it, or you discover
  it with the `s' (search) command.  Monsters can fall prey to traps, too,
  which can be used as a useful defensive strategy.

  If you see a monster and you wish to fight it, just attempt to walk into

  You start the game with a little dog (`d') or cat (`f'), which follows
  you about the dungeon and fights monsters with you.  Like you, your pet
  needs food to survive.  It usually feeds itself on fresh carrion and
  other meats.  If you're worried about it or want to train it, you can
  feed it, too, by throwing it food.  A properly trained pet can be very
  useful under certain circumstances.

  Your pet also gains experience from killing monsters, and can grow over
  time, gaining hit points and doing more damage.  Initially, your pet may
  even be better at killing things than you, which makes pets useful for
  low-level characters.

  Your pet will follow you up and down staircases if it is next to you
  when you move.  Otherwise your pet will be stranded and may become wild.

  You may encounter the shades and corpses of other adventurers (or even
  former incarnations of yourself!) and their personal effects.  Ghosts
  are hard to kill, but easy to avoid, since they're slow and do little
  damage.  You can plunder the deceased adventurer's possessions; however,
  they are likely to be cursed.  Beware of whatever killed the former
  player; it is probably still lurking around, gloating over its last
  victory.

@NODE Node15 "NetHack Guidebook: Objects "

                                  @{b}Objects @{ub}


  When you find something in the dungeon, it is common to want to pick it
  up.  In NetHack, this is accomplished automatically by walking over the
  object (unless you turn off the @{u}autopickup@{uu} option (see below), or move
  with the `m' prefix (see above)), or manually by using the `,' command.

  If you're carrying too many things, NetHack will tell you so and you
  won't be able to pick up anything more.  Otherwise, it will add the
  object(s) to your pack and tell you what you just picked up.

  When you pick up an object, it is assigned an inventory letter.  Many
  commands that operate on objects must ask you to find out which object
  you want to use.  When NetHack asks you to choose a particular object
  you are carrying, you are usually presented with a list of inventory
  letters to choose from (see Commands, above).

  Some objects, such as weapons, are easily differentiated.  Others, like
  scrolls and potions, are given descriptions which vary according to
  type.  During a game, any two objects with the same description are the
  same type.  However, the descriptions will vary from game to game.

  When you use one of these objects, if its effect is obvious, NetHack
  will remember what it is for you.  If its effect isn't extremely
  obvious, you will be asked what you want to call this type of object so
  you will recognize it later.  You can also use the ``#name'' command for
  the same purpose at any time, to name all objects of a particular type
  or just an individual object.

@NODE Node16 "NetHack Guidebook: Curses and Blessings"

                            @{b}Curses and Blessings@{ub}


  Any object that you find may be cursed, even if the object is otherwise
  helpful.  The most common effect of a curse is being stuck with (and to)
  the item.  Cursed weapons weld themselves to your hand when wielded, so
  you cannot unwield them.  Any cursed item you wear is not removable by
  ordinary means.  In addition, cursed arms and armor usually, but not
  always, bear negative enchantments that make them less effective in
  combat.  Other cursed objects may act poorly or detrimentally in other
  ways.

  Objects can also be blessed.  Blessed items usually work better or more
  beneficially than normal uncursed items.  For example, a blessed weapon
  will do more damage against demons.

  There are magical means of bestowing or removing curses upon objects, so
  even if you are stuck with one, you can still have the curse lifted and
  the item removed.  Priests and Priestesses have an innate sensitivity to
  this property in any object, so they can more easily avoid cursed
  objects than other character classes.

  An item with unknown status will be reported in your inventory with no
  prefix.  An item which you know the state of will be distinguished in
  your inventory by the presence of the word ``cursed'', ``uncursed'' or
  ``blessed'' in the description of the item.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Node17 "NetHack Guidebook: Weapons (`)')"

                               @{b}Weapons (`)')@{ub}


  Given a chance, most monsters in the Mazes of Menace will gratuitously
  try to kill you.  You need weapons for self-defense (killing them
  first).  Without a weapon, you do only 1-2 hit points of damage (plus
  bonuses, if any).

  There are wielded weapons, like maces and swords, and thrown weapons,
  like arrows and spears.  To hit monsters with a weapon, you must wield
  it and attack them, or throw it at them.  You can simply select to throw
  a spear.  To shoot an arrow, you should first wield a bow, then throw
  the arrow.  Crossbows shoot crossbow bolts.  Slings hurl rocks and
  (other) stones (like gems).  You can wield only one weapon at a time,
  but you can change weapons unless you're wielding a cursed one.  To
  switch to bare hands, wield `-', or use the `A' command which allows you
  to unwield the current weapon in addition to taking off other worn
  items.

  The ``#enhance'' command will be present if the ``weapon skills''
  feature is enabled, and deals with your proficiency in various types of
  weapons.

  Enchanted weapons have a ``plus'' (or ``to hit enhancement'' which can
  be either positive or negative) that adds or subtracts to/from your
  chance to hit and the damage you do to a monster.  The only way to
  determine a weapon's enchantment is to have it magically identified
  somehow.

  Most weapons are subject to some type of damage like rust.  Such damage
  can be repaired.

  Those of you in the audience who are AD&D players, be aware that each
  weapon which exists in AD&D does the same damage to monsters in NetHack.
  Some of the more obscure weapons (such as the @{i}aklys@{ui}, @{i}lucern hammer@{ui}, and
  @{i}bec-de-corbin@{ui}) are defined in an appendix to @{i}Unearthed Arcana@{ui}, an AD&D
  supplement.

  The commands to use weapons are `w' (wield), `t' (throw), and the
  ``#enhance'' extended command.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Node18 "NetHack Guidebook: Armor (`[')"

                                @{b}Armor (`[')@{ub}


  Lots of unfriendly things lurk about; you need armor to protect yourself
  from their blows.  Some types of armor offer better protection than
  others.  Your armor class is a measure of this protection.  Armor class
  (AC) is measured as in AD&D, with 10 being the equivalent of no armor,
  and lower numbers meaning better armor.  Each suit of armor which exists
  in AD&D gives the same protection in NetHack.  Here is an (incomplete)
  list of the armor classes provided by various suits of armor:

                          dragon scale mail      1 
                          crystal plate mail     3 
                          plate mail             3 
                          bronze plate mail      4 
                          splint mail            4 
                          banded mail            4 
                          elven mithril-coat     5 
                          chain mail             5 
                          scale mail             6 
                          ring mail              7 
                          studded leather armor  7 
                          leather armor          8 
                          no armor              10 

  You can also wear other pieces of armor (ex. helmets, boots, shields,
  cloaks) to lower your armor class even further, but you can only wear
  one item of each category (one suit of armor, one cloak, one helmet, one
  shield, and so on) at a time.

  If a piece of armor is enchanted, its armor protection will be better
  (or worse) than normal, and its ``plus'' (or minus) will subtract from
  your armor class.  For example, a +1 chain mail would give you better
  protection than normal chain mail, lowering your armor class one unit
  further to 4.  When you put on a piece of armor, you immediately find
  out the armor class and any ``plusses'' it provides.  Cursed pieces of
  armor usually have negative enchantments (minuses) in addition to being
  unremovable.

  Many types of armor are subject to some kind of damage like rust.  Such
  damage can be repaired.  Some types or armor may inhibit spell casting.

  The commands to use armor are `W' (wear) and `T' (take off).  The `A'
  command can also be used to take off armor as well as other worn items.

  Food is necessary to survive.  If you go too long without eating you
  will faint, and eventually die of starvation.  Some types of food will
  spoil, and become unhealthy to eat, if not protected.  Food stored in
  ice boxes or tins (``cans'') will usually stay fresh, but ice boxes are
  heavy, and tins take a while to open.

  When you kill monsters, they usually leave corpses which are also
  ``food.''  Many, but not all, of these are edible; some also give you
  special powers when you eat them.  A good rule of thumb is ``you are
  what you eat.''

  You can name one food item after something you like to eat with the

  Scrolls are labeled with various titles, probably chosen by ancient
  wizards for their amusement value (ex. ``READ ME,'' or ``HOLY BIBLE''
  backwards).  Scrolls disappear after you read them (except for blank
  ones, without magic spells on them).

  One of the most useful of these is the @{i}scroll of identify@{ui}, which can be
  used to determine what another object is, whether it is cursed or
  blessed, and how many uses it has left.  Some objects of subtle
  enchantment are difficult to identify without these.

  A mail daemon may run up and deliver mail to you as a @{i}scroll of mail@{ui} (on
  versions compiled with this feature).  To use this feature on versions
  where NetHack mail delivery is triggered by electronic mail appearing in
  your system mailbox, you must let NetHack know where to look for new
  mail by setting the ``MAIL'' environment variable to the file name of
  your mailbox.  You may also want to set the ``MAILREADER'' environment
  variable to the file name of your favorite reader, so NetHack can shell
  to it when you read the scroll.  On versions of NetHack where mail is
  randomly generated internal to the game, these environment variables are
  ignored.  You can disable the mail daemon by turning off the @{u}mail@{uu}
  option.

  They disappear after you quaff them.

  Clear potions are potions of water.  Sometimes these are blessed or
  cursed, resulting in holy or unholy water.  Holy water is the bane of
  the undead, so potions of holy water are good things to throw (`t') at
  them.  It is also sometimes very useful to dip (``#dip'') an object into
  a potion.

  Magic wands usually have multiple magical charges.  Some wands are
  directional - you must give a direction in which to zap them.  You can
  also zap them at yourself (just give a `.' or `s' for the direction). Be
  warned, however, for this is often unwise.  Other wands are
  nondirectional - they don't require a direction.  The number of charges
  in a wand is random and decreases by one whenever you use it.

  When the number of charges left in a wand becomes zero, attempts to use
  the wand will usually result in nothing happening.  Occasionally,
  however, it may be possible to squeeze the last few mana points from an
  otherwise spent wand.

  In a truly desperate situation, when your back is up against the wall,
  you might decide to go for broke and break your wand.  This is not for
  the faint of heart.  Doing so will almost certainly cause a catastrophic
  release of magical energies.

  The command to use a wand is `z' (zap).  To break one, use the `a'

  unlike the usually fleeting effects of potions, scrolls, and wands.

  Putting on a ring activates its magic.  You can wear only two rings, one

  Spell books are tomes of mighty magic.  When studied with the `r' (read)
  command, they bestow the knowledge of a spell - unless the attempt
  backfires.  Reading a cursed spell book or one with mystic runes beyond
  your ken can be harmful to your health!

  A spell (even when learned) can also backfire when you cast it.  If you
  attempt to cast a spell well above your experience level, or cast it at
  a time when your luck is particularly bad, you can end up wasting both
  the energy and the time required in casting.

  Casting a spell calls forth magical energies and focuses them with your
  naked mind.  Releasing the magical energy releases some of your memory
  of the spell with it.  Each time you cast a spell, your familiarity with
  it will dwindle, until you eventually forget the details completely and
  must relearn it.

  Casting a spell also requires flexible movement, and wearing various
  types of armor may interfere with that.

  The command to read a spell book is the same as for scrolls, `r' (read).
  The `+' command lists your current spells and the number of spell points
  they require.  The `Z' (cast) command casts a spell.

@NODE Node28 "NetHack Guidebook: Gems (`*')"

                                 @{b}Gems (`*')@{ub}


  Some gems are valuable, and can be sold for a lot of gold.  They are
  also a far more efficient way of carrying your riches.  Valuable gems
  increase your score if you bring them with you when you exit.

  Other small rocks are also categorized as gems, but they are much less
  valuable.  All rocks, however, can be used as projectile weapons (if you
  have a sling).  In the most desperate of cases, you can still throw them
  by hand.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Node29 "NetHack Guidebook: Large rocks (``')"

                             @{b}Large rocks (``')@{ub}


  Statues and boulders are not particularly useful, and are generally
  heavy.  It is rumored that some statues are not what they seem.

  Very large humanoids (giants and their ilk) have been known to use
  boulders as weapons.

@NODE Node30 "NetHack Guidebook: Gold (`$')"

                                 @{b}Gold (`$')@{ub}


  Gold adds to your score, and you can buy things in shops with it.  Your
  version of NetHack may display how much gold you have on the status
  line.  If not, the `$' command will count it.  There are a number of
  monsters in the dungeon that may be influenced by the amount of gold you
  are carrying (shopkeepers aside).

@NODE Node31 "NetHack Guidebook: Options"

                                  @{b}Options@{ub}


  Due to variations in personal tastes and conceptions of how NetHack
  should do things, there are options you can set to change how NetHack
  behaves.

   @{" Using the NETHACKOPTIONS environment variable " LINK Node33}
   @{" Using a configuration file " LINK Node34}

@ENDNODE

@NODE Node32 "NetHack Guidebook: Setting the options"

                            @{b}Setting the options@{ub}


  Options may be set in a number of ways.  Within the game, the `O'
  command allows you to view all options and change most of them.  You can
  also set options automatically by placing them in the NETHACKOPTIONS
  environment variable or in a configuration file.  Some versions of
  NetHack also have front-end programs that allow you to set options
  before starting the game.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Node33 "NetHack Guidebook: Using the NETHACKOPTIONS environment variable"

               @{b}Using the NETHACKOPTIONS environment variable@{ub}


  The NETHACKOPTIONS variable is a comma-separated list of initial values
  for the various options.  Some can only be turned on or off.  You turn
  one of these on by adding the name of the option to the list, and turn
  it off by typing a `!' or ``no'' before the name.  Others take a
  character string as a value.  You can set string options by typing the
  option name, a colon, and then the value of the string.  The value is
  terminated by the next comma or the end of string.

  For example, to set up an environment variable so that ``female'' is on,
  ``autopickup'' is off, the name is set to ``Blue Meanie'', and the fruit
  is set to ``papaya'', you would enter the command % @{b}setenv
  NETHACKOPTIONS "female,\\!autopickup,name:Blue Meanie,fruit:papaya"@{ub} in
  @{i}csh@{ui} (note the need to escape the ! since it's special to the shell), or
  $ @{b}NETHACKOPTIONS="female,!autopickup,name:Blue Meanie,fruit:papaya"@{ub} $
  @{b}export NETHACKOPTIONS@{ub} in @{i}sh@{ui} or @{i}ksh@{ui}.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Node34 "NetHack Guidebook: Using a configuration file"

                         @{b}Using a configuration file@{ub}


  Any line in the configuration file starting with ``OPTIONS='' may be
  filled out with options in the same syntax as in NETHACKOPTIONS.  Any
  line starting with ``DUNGEON='', ``EFFECTS='', ``MONSTERS='',
  ``OBJECTS='', or ``TRAPS='' is taken as defining the corresponding
  @{u}dungeon,@{uu} @{u}effects,@{uu} @{u}monsters,@{uu} @{u}objects@{uu} or @{u}traps@{uu} option in a different
  syntax, a sequence of decimal numbers giving the character position in
  the current font to be used in displaying each entry.  Such a sequence
  can be continued to multiple lines by putting a `\\' at the end of each
  line to be continued.  Any line starting with `#' is treated as a
  comment.

  The default name of the configuration file varies on different operating
  systems, but NETHACKOPTIONS can also be set to the full name of a file
  you want to use (possibly preceded by an `@').

@ENDNODE

@NODE Node35 "NetHack Guidebook: Customization options"

                           @{b}Customization options@{ub}


  Here are explanations of what the various options do.  Character strings
  that are too long may be truncated.  Some of the options listed may be
  inactive in your dungeon.

    autopickup  
     Pick up things you move onto by default (default on).

    BIOS    
     Use BIOS calls to update the screen display quickly and to read
     the keyboard (allowing the use of arrow keys to move) on machines
     with an IBM PC compatible BIOS ROM (default off, OS/2, PC, and ST
     NetHack only).

    catname
     Name your starting cat (ex. ``catname:Morris'').  Cannot be set
     with the `O' command.

    checkpoint
     Save game state after each level change, for possible recovery
     after program crash (default on).

    color   
     Use color for different monsters, objects, and dungeon features
     (default on for microcomputers).

    confirm 
     Have user confirm attacks on pets, shopkeepers, and other
     peaceable creatures (default on).

    DECgraphics
     Use a predefined selection of characters from the DEC VT-xxx/DEC
     Rainbow/ANSI line-drawing character set to display the
     dungeon/effects/traps instead of having to define a full graphics
     set yourself (default off).  This option also sets up proper
     handling of graphics characters for such terminals, so you should
     specify it when appropriate even if you override the selections
     with your own graphics strings.

    disclose
     Offer to disclose various information when the game ends (default
     all).  The possibilities are identifying your inventory ('i'),
     disclosing your attributes ('a'), summarizing monsters that have
     been vanquished ('v'), and listing monster species that have been
     genocided ('g').  Note that the vanquished monsters list includes
     all monsters killed by traps and each other as well as by you.

    dogname
     Name your starting dog (ex. ``dogname:Fang'').  Cannot be set
     with the `O' command.

    dungeon
     Set the graphics symbols for displaying the dungeon (default &``
     |--------||.-|++.##<><>_\\\\#{}.}..## #}'').  The @{u}dungeon@{uu} option
     should be followed by a string of 1-38 characters to be used
     instead of the default map-drawing characters.  The dungeon map
     will use the characters you specify instead of the default
     symbols, and default symbols for any you do not specify.
     Remember that you may need to escape some of these characters if,
     for example, you use @{i}csh@{ui}.

     Note that this option string is escape-processed in conventional
     C fashion.  This means that `\\' is a prefix to take the following
     character literally, and not as a special prefix.  The special
     escape form `\\m' switches on the meta bit in the following
     character, and the `^' prefix causes the following character to
     be treated as a control character.

     The order of the symbols is: solid rock, vertical wall,
     horizontal wall, upper left corner, upper right corner, lower
     left corner, lower right corner, cross wall, upward T wall,
     downward T wall, leftward T wall, rightward T wall, no door,
     vertical open door, horizontal open door, vertical closed door,
     horizontal closed door, floor of a room, dark corridor, lit
     corridor, stairs up, stairs down, ladder up, ladder down, altar,
     throne, kitchen sink, fountain, pool or moat, ice, lava, vertical
     lowered drawbridge, horizontal lowered drawbridge, vertical
     raised drawbridge, horizontal raised drawbridge, air, cloud,
     under water.

     You might want to use `+' for the corners and T walls for a more
     aesthetic, boxier display.  Note that in the next release, new
     symbols may be added, or the present ones rearranged.

     Cannot be set with the `O' command.

    effects
     Set the graphics symbols for displaying special effects (default
     &``|-\\\\/*!)(0#@*/-\\\\||\\\\-//-\\\\| |\\\\-/'').  The @{u}effects@{uu} option
     should be followed by a string of 1-29 characters to be used
     instead of the default special-effects characters.  This string
     is subjected to the same processing as the @{u}dungeon@{uu} option.

     The order of the symbols is: vertical beam, horizontal beam, left
     slant, right slant, digging beam, camera flash beam, left
     boomerang, right boomerang, four glyphs giving the sequence for
     magic resistance displays; the eight surrounding glyphs for
     swallowed display; nine glyphs for explosions.  An explosion
     consists of three rows (top, middle, and bottom) of three
     characters.  The explosion is centered in the center of this 3 by
     3 array.

     Note that in the next release, new symbols may be added, or the
     present ones rearranged.

     Cannot be set with the `O' command.

    female
     Set your sex (default off).  Cannot be set with the `O' command.

    fixinv
     An object's inventory letter sticks to it when it's dropped
     (default on).  If this is off, dropping an object shifts all the
     remaining inventory letters.

    fruit   
     Name a fruit after something you enjoy eating (ex.
     ``fruit:mango'') (default ``slime mold'').  Basically a nostalgic
     whimsy that NetHack uses from time to time.  You should set this
     to something you find more appetizing than slime mold.  Apples,
     oranges, pears, bananas, and melons already exist in NetHack, so
     don't use those.

    help
     If more information is available for an object looked at with the
     `/' command, ask if you want to see it (default on). Turning help
     off makes just looking at things faster, since you aren't
     interrupted with the ``More info?'' prompt, but it also means
     that you might miss some interesting and/or important
     information.

    hilite_pet
     Visually distinguish pets from similar animals (default off).  In
     text windowing, use text highlighting when color is turned off;
     with X tiles, display a heart symbol near pets.

    IBMgraphics
     Use a predefined selection of IBM extended ASCII characters to
     display the dungeon/effects/traps instead of having to define a
     full graphics set yourself (default off).  This option also sets
     up proper handling of graphics characters for such terminals, so
     you should specify it when appropriate even if you override the
     selections with your own graphics strings.

    ignintr
     Ignore interrupt signals, including breaks (default off).

    legacy
     Display an introductory message when starting the game (default
     on).

    lit_corridor
     Show corridor squares seen by night vision or a light source held
     by your character as lit (default off).

    mail   \\
     Enable mail delivery during the game.

    male    
     Set your sex (default on, most hackers are male).  Cannot be set
     with the `O' command.

    menustyle
     Controls the interface used when you need to choose various
     objects (in response to the Drop command, for instance).  The
     value specified should be the first letter of one of the
     following: traditional, combination, partial, or full.
     Traditional was the only interface available for earlier
     versions; it consists of a prompt for object class characters,
     followed by an object-by-object prompt for all items matching the
     selected object class(es).  Combination starts with a prompt for
     object class(es) of interest, but then displays a menu of
     matching objects rather than prompting one-by-one.  Partial skips
     the object class filtering and immediately displays a menu of all
     objects.  Full displays a menu of object classes rather than a
     character prompt, and then a menu of matching objects for
     selection.

    menu_deselect_all
     Menu character accelerator to deselect all items in a menu.
     Implemented by the X11 and tty ports.  Default '-'.

    menu_deselect_page
     Menu character accelerator deselect all items on this page of a
     menu.  Implemented only by the tty port.  Default '\\'.

    menu_first_page
     Menu character accelerator to jump to the first page in a menu.
     Implemented only by the tty port.  Default '^'.

    menu_invert_all
     Menu character accelerator to invert all items in a menu.
     Implemented by the X11 and tty ports.  Default '@'.

    menu_invert_page
     Menu character accelerator to invert all items on this page of a
     menu.  Implemented only by the tty port.  Default '~'.

    menu_last_page
     Menu character accelerator to jump to the last page in a menu.
     Implemented only by the tty port.  Default '|'.

    menu_next_page
     Menu character accelerator to goto the next menu page.
     Implemented only by the tty port.  Default '>'.

    menu_previous_page 
     Menu character accelerator to goto the previous menu page.
     Implemented only by the tty port.  Default '<'.

    menu_search
     Menu character accelerator to search for a menu item.
     Implemented only by the X11 port.  Default ':'.

    menu_select_all
     Menu character accelerator to select all items in a menu.
     Implemented by the X11 and tty ports.  Default '.'.

    menu_select_page
     Menu character accelerator to select all items on this page of a
     menu.  Implemented only by the tty port.  Default ','.

    monsters
     Set the characters used to display monster classes (default
     ``abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ@
     '&;:~]'').  This string is subjected to the same processing as
     the @{u}dungeon@{uu} option.  The order of the symbols is ant or other
     insect, blob, cockatrice, dog or other canine, eye or sphere,
     feline, gremlin, humanoid, imp or minor demon, jelly, kobold,
     leprechaun, mimic, nymph, orc, piercer, quadruped, rodent,
     spider, trapper or lurker above, unicorn, vortex, worm, xan or
     other mythical/fantastic insect, light, zruty, angelic being,
     bat, centaur, dragon, elemental, fungus or mold, gnome, giant
     humanoid, invisible stalker, jabberwock, Keystone Kop, lich,
     mummy, naga, ogre, pudding or ooze, quantum mechanic, rust
     monster, snake, troll, umber hulk, vampire, wraith, xorn, yeti or
     ape or other large beast, zombie, human, ghost, golem, demon, sea
     monster, lizard, long worm tail, and mimic.  Cannot be set with
     the `O' command.

    msghistory
     The number of top line messages to save (and recall with ^P)
     (default 20).  Cannot be set with the `O' command.

    name    
     Set your character's name (defaults to your user name).  You can
     also set your character class by appending a dash and the first
     letter of the character class (that is, by suffixing one of @{u}"-A
     -B -C -E -H -K -P -R -S -T -V -W" ).@{uu}  If @{u}"-@"@{uu} is used for the
     class, then a random one will be automatically chosen.  Cannot be
     set with the `O' command.

    news    
     Read the NetHack news file, if present (default on).  Since the
     news is shown at the beginning of the game, there's no point in
     setting this with the `O' command.

    null    
     Send padding nulls to the terminal (default off).

    number_pad
     Use the number keys to move instead of [yuhjklbn] (default off).

    objects
     Set the characters used to display object classes (default
     ``])[="(%!?+/$*`0_.'').  This string is subjected to the same
     processing as the @{u}dungeon@{uu} option.  The order of the symbols is
     illegal-object (should never be seen), weapon, armor, ring,
     amulet, tool, food, potion, scroll, spell book, wand, gold, gem
     or rock, boulder or statue, iron ball, chain, and venom.  Cannot
     be set with the `O' command.

    packorder
     Specify the order to list object types in (default
     ``\\")[%?+/=!(*`0_'').  The value of this option should be a
     string containing the symbols for the various object types.

    perm_invent
     If true, always display your current inventory in a window.  This
     only makes sense for windowing system interfaces that implement
     this feature.

    pettype
     Specify the type of your initial pet, if you are playing a
     character class that uses both types of pets.  Possible values
     are ``cat'' and ``dog''.  Cannot be set with the `O' command.

    pickup_types
     Specify the object types to be picked up when @{u}autopickup@{uu} is on.
     Default is all types.

    preload_tiles
     For the protected mode MSDOS version, control whether tiles get
     pre-loaded into RAM at the start of the game.  Doing so enhances
     performance of the tile graphics, but uses more memory. (default
     on).  Cannot be set with the `O' command.

    rawio   
     Force raw (non-cbreak) mode for faster output and more
     bulletproof input (MS-DOS sometimes treats `^P' as a printer
     toggle without it) (default off).  Note: DEC Rainbows hang if
     this is turned on.  Cannot be set with the `O' command.

    rest_on_space
     Make the space bar a synonym for the `.' (rest) command (default
     off).

    safe_pet
     Prevent you from (knowingly) attacking your pets (default on).

    scores
     Control what parts of the score list you are shown at the end
     (ex.  ``scores:5 top scores/4 around my score/own scores'').
     Only the first letter of each category (`t', `a', or `o') is
     necessary.

    showexp
     Show your accumulated experience points on bottom line (default
     off).

    showscore
     Show your approximate accumulated score on bottom line (default
     off).

    silent  
     Suppress terminal beeps (default on).

    sortpack
     Sort the pack contents by type when displaying inventory (default
     on).

    standout
     Boldface monsters and ``@{b}--More--@{ub}'' (default off).

    time    
     Show the elapsed game time in turns on bottom line (default off).

    timed_delay
     When pausing momentarily for display effect, such as with
     explosions and moving objects, use a timer rather than sending
     extra characters to the screen.  (Applies to ``tty'' interface
     only; ``X11'' interface always uses a timer based delay.  The
     default is on if configured into the program.)

    tombstone
     Draw a tombstone graphic upon your death (default on).

    toptenwin
     Put the ending display in a NetHack window instead of on stdout
     (default off).  Setting this option makes the score list visible
     when a windowing version of NetHack is started without a parent
     window, but it no longer leaves the score list around after game
     end on a terminal or emulating window.

    traps
     Set the graphics symbols for displaying traps (default
     &``^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^#^^^^'').  The @{u}traps@{uu} option should be
     followed by a string of 1-22 characters to be used instead of the
     default traps characters.  This string is subjected to the same
     processing as the @{u}dungeon@{uu} option.

     The order of the symbols is: arrow trap, dart trap, falling rock
     trap, squeaky board, bear trap, land mine, rolling boulder trap,
     sleeping gas trap, rust trap, fire trap, pit, spiked pit, hole,
     trap door, teleportation trap, level teleporter, magic portal,
     web, statue trap, magic trap, anti-magic field, polymorph trap.

     Cannot be set with the `O' command.

    verbose
     Provide more commentary during the game (default on).

    videocolors
     Set the color palette for PC systems using NO_TERMS (default
     4-2-6-1-5-3-15-12-10-14-9-13-11).  The order of colors is red,
     green, brown, blue, magenta, cyan, bright.white, bright.red,
     bright.green, yellow, bright.blue, bright.magenta, and
     bright.cyan.  Cannot be set with the `O' command.

    videoshades
     Set the intensity level of the three gray scales available
     (default dark normal light, PC NetHack only).  If the game
     display is difficult to read, try adjusting these scales; if this
     does not correct the problem, try !color.  Cannot be set with the
     `O' command.

    windowtype
     Select which windowing system to use, such as ``tty'' or ``X11''
     (default depends on version).  Cannot be set with the `O'
     command.

                                  @{b}Scoring@{ub}


  NetHack maintains a list of the top scores or scorers on your machine,
  depending on how it is set up.  In the latter case, each account on the
  machine can post only one non-winning score on this list.  If you score
  higher than someone else on this list, or better your previous score,
  you will be inserted in the proper place under your current name.  How
  many scores are kept can also be set up when NetHack is compiled.

  Your score is chiefly based upon how much experience you gained, how
  much loot you accumulated, how deep you explored, and how the game
  ended.  If you quit the game, you escape with all of your gold intact.
  If, however, you get killed in the Mazes of Menace, the guild will only
  hear about 90% of your gold when your corpse is discovered (adventurers
  have been known to collect finder's fees).  So, consider whether you
  want to take one last hit at that monster and possibly live, or quit and
  stop with whatever you have.  If you quit, you keep all your gold, but
  if you swing and live, you might find more.

  If you just want to see what the current top players/games list is, you
  can type @{b}nethack -s all@{ub} on most versions.

  NetHack is an intricate and difficult game.  Novices might falter in
  fear, aware of their ignorance of the means to survive.  Well, fear not.
  Your dungeon may come equipped with an ``explore'' or ``discovery'' mode
  that enables you to keep old save files and cheat death, at the paltry
  cost of not getting on the high score list.

  There are two ways of enabling explore mode.  One is to start the game
  with the @{u}-X@{uu} switch.  The other is to issue the `X' command while already
  playing the game.  The other benefits of explore mode are left for the
  intrepid reader to discover.

@NODE Node38 "NetHack Guidebook: Credits"

                                  @{b}Credits@{ub}


  The original @{i}hack@{ui} game was modeled on the Berkeley Unix @{i}rogue@{ui} game.
  Large portions of this paper were shamelessly cribbed from @{i}A Guide to
  the Dungeons of Doom@{ui}, by Michael C. Toy and Kenneth C. R. C. Arnold.
  Small portions were adapted from @{i}Further Exploration of the Dungeons of
  Doom@{ui}, by Ken Arromdee.

  NetHack is the product of literally dozens of people's work.  Main
  events in the course of the game development are described below:


  @{b}Jay Fenlason@{ub} wrote the original Hack, with help from @{b}Kenny Woodland@{ub},
  @{b}Mike Thome@{ub} and @{b}Jon Payne@{ub}.

  @{b}Andries Brouwer@{ub} did a major re-write, transforming Hack into a very
  different game, and published (at least) three versions (1.0.1, 1.0.2,
  and 1.0.3) for Unix machines to the Usenet.

  @{b}Don G. Kneller@{ub} ported Hack 1.0.3 to Microsoft C and MS-DOS, producing PC
  HACK 1.01e, added support for DEC Rainbow graphics in version 1.03g, and
  went on to produce at least four more versions (3.0, 3.2, 3.51, and
  3.6).

  @{b}R. Black@{ub} ported PC HACK 3.51 to Lattice C and the Atari 520/1040ST,
  producing ST Hack 1.03.

  @{b}Mike Stephenson@{ub} merged these various versions back together,
  incorporating many of the added features, and produced NetHack 1.4.  He
  then coordinated a cast of thousands in enhancing and debugging NetHack
  1.4 and released NetHack versions 2.2 and 2.3.

  Later, Mike coordinated a major rewrite of the game, heading a team
  which included @{b}Ken Arromdee@{ub}, @{b}Jean-Christophe Collet@{ub}, @{b}Steve Creps@{ub}, @{b}Eric
  Hendrickson@{ub}, @{b}Izchak Miller@{ub}, @{b}John Rupley@{ub}, @{b}Mike Threepoint@{ub}, and @{b}Janet
  Walz@{ub}, to produce NetHack 3.0c.

  NetHack 3.0 was ported to the Atari by @{b}Eric R. Smith@{ub}, to OS/2 by @{b}Timo
  Hakulinen@{ub}, and to VMS by @{b}David Gentzel@{ub}.  The three of them and @{b}Kevin
  Darcy@{ub} later joined the main development team to produce subsequent
  revisions of 3.0.

  @{b}Stephen Spackman@{ub} and @{b}Pierre Martineau@{ub} designed overlay code for PC
  NetHack 3.0.  @{b}Johnny Lee@{ub} ported NetHack 3.0 to the Macintosh.  Along
  with various other Dungeoneers, they continued to enhance the PC,

  Headed by @{b}Mike Stephenson@{ub} and coordinated by @{b}Izchak Miller@{ub} and @{b}Janet
  Walz@{ub}, the development team which now included @{b}Ken Arromdee@{ub}, @{b}David Cohrs@{ub},

  Linhart@{ub}, @{b}Dean Luick@{ub}, @{b}Pat Rankin@{ub}, @{b}Eric Raymond@{ub}, and @{b}Eric Smith@{ub} undertook
  a radical revision of 3.0.  They re-structured the game's design, and
  re-wrote major parts of the code.  They added multiple dungeons, a new
  display, special individual character quests, a new endgame and many
  other new features, and produced NetHack 3.1.

  @{b}Ken Lorber@{ub}, @{b}Gregg Wonderly@{ub} and @{b}Greg Olson@{ub}, with help from @{b}Richard

  @{b}Janet Walz@{ub}; and, @{b}Paul Winner@{ub}, release version 3.2 in April of 1996.

  Version 3.2 marks the tenth anniversary of the formation of the
  development team.  In a testament to their dedication to the game, all
  thirteen members of the original development team remained on the team
  at the start of work on the current release.  During the interval
  between the release of 3.1.3 and 3.2, one of the founding members of the
  development team, @{b}Dr. Izchak Miller@{ub}, was diagnosed with cancer and
  passed away.  This release of the game is dedicated to him by the
  development and porting teams.

  @{b}Pat Rankin@{ub} maintained 3.2 for VMS.

  @{b}Michael Allison@{ub}, @{b}Yitzhak Sapir@{ub}, and @{b}Paul Winner@{ub}, with help from @{b}Steve
  Linhart@{ub}, @{b}Kevin Smolkowski@{ub}, @{b}Mike Stephenson@{ub}, and @{b}Stephen White@{ub} ported 3.2
