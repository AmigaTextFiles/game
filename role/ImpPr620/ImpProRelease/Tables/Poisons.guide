@Node Main "Poisons, toxins, venoms, and acids"
   This document reveals most of the poisons, toxins, venoms, and acids
that have been discovered in use around the realms. The terms are
described below. Note that some of these are real-life poisons and
should @{b}Not Ever@{ub} be considered for anything other than game use.

 @{" The Poisons " Link "The Poisons"} 

@{b}Poison@{ub} Some form of harmful substance that exists in naturally with no
     alterations from PC's (Other than the collecting of said poison)

@{b}Toxin@{ub} A damaging substance that does not occur in nature. A toxin must
     be produced manualy by an alchemist or assassin. Mixture: A
     substance that is used as a poison, but must be made and produced
     by magic.

@{b}Venom Spit@{ub} A damaging substance that is produced only within the glands
     of an animal. Generally thought to be the strongest of the poison
     types, but also the hardest to collect.

@{b}Acid@{ub} A corrosive substance that either exists in nature, is produced by
     an animal gland, or is produced by someone. Causes damage upon
     contact but can usually  be washed off upon initial contact to
     stop damage, unlike a poison.

@{b}Ingestive@{ub} This form of poison is the most common. To effect a creature,
     it must first ingest the poison. This means that the creature must
     eat the poison one way or another. Getting a poison in this form
     is of a normal cost.

@{b}Insinuative@{ub} This form of poison will effect a creature just by getting
     it into it's blood stream. This is the form of poison that is used
     on weapons. (And in specialized weapons as a Dagger of Venom).
     This form of poison costs an extra 50%  to create (Cost * 1.5)

@{b}Contact@{ub} This form of poison will effect a creature just by coming in
     contact with the poison. This is one of the most expensive and
     most dangerous forms.  Many a user has slain themselves through
     carelessness. This form of poison costs 300% normal cost (Cost *
     3) NOTE: This form of poison is easily bypassed by thick gloves.
     However I have heard of an assassin which mixes acid and poison
     for just that sort  of case.

@{b}Gas@{ub} This form of poison is very dangerous. It will effect everything
     within range. You will have to pay a pretty gold piece for any
     alchemist to add an  oxidizing agent to a poison and it's
     expensive to ask someone to risk their life for  that. This form
     costs 1000% normal costs (Cost * 100). The normal effect is a
     sealed  vial which when broken will produce a 20' x 20' x 20'
     cloud of gas.

@{b}Antidotes@{ub} Antidotes are available if a sample of the poison is made
     available. The antidote usually cost 120% of the purchace price of
     the poison.   Antidotes take approximately one week to create, and
     must be administered within  2 rounds of the toxification to be
     effective. If no sample of the toxin is availible,  one cam be
     distilled from a blood sample, but that will take approximately a
     month and a 1,000 extra gold (by then it's too late anyway).

Note to GM's
************

   These poison (toxins...etc...) have not been assigned any  price or
dosage for effect (with few exceptions). These  things are up to you.
This also goes for availability of  these and antidotes (Note thought
that there are a few that  have no known antidote!) The only other note
I should make  is to keep these in control. To many can really throw a
game out of balance. For assassins to study these, I  usually allow
them on type (Poison, Toxin, venom...etc...)  to learn and they may
learn how to use, collect, produce..   it from 5th level on. For each
level afterwards, they may  learn one more from that type of poison.
