                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<krautp@sncad.snc.edu>

   The gods (a mixed Greek and Roman pantheon) created the Twelve Swords as a
game. They would scatter them among humans, to their chosen champions, and see
whose player could collect them all. Much to their dismay the gods discovered
that these weapons were powerful enough to work on the gods themselves. These
Swords have claimed the lives of many a holy, and unholy, beings.
   All of the Swords look identical except for a small white symbol etched into
on side of the black hilt. The blade is a little over three feet long, and with
a molted steel color.

GAME STATISTICS:
   They may be treated as a longsword and/or a bastard sword. All of the swords
are unbreakable (except as noted in Shieldbreaker's description).
   They retain an extremely keen edge no matter what they cut or are struck
against.
   Unless otherwise stated each weapon is +1 "to hit" and +3 damage.

@node SW_0 "Akasha"
 <kmhk@maristb>
 Intelligence: 17
 EGO: Tolerable
 Alignment: Chaotic Good

   Akasha or Bloodbringer is the most powerful sword of Silvain Darksword Goddess
of War and Seduction (Greater Goddess). She is the wife of Thayathas (Thayathas'
bow). Akasha may only be used in the nightime; If used in the day, it must save
vs. spell as a 6th level fighter or turn to ash. If this happens, the sword may
be restored if the ashes are collected and mixed with nine drops of Silvains
blood in its sheath. The sword talks. Its claim to fame is that it can drain
life-levels at the rate of 2 per hit if the opponent is 10th level or higher and
at the rate of 1 per hit if the opponent is lower than 10th level.

@node SW_1 "Baarane's Swords of Agility"
   There are three swords created by the legendary weapon forger Baarane. They
are a long sword, short sword, and bastard sword. All weapons have some
properties in common. All three are:

 * +2 weapons to hit and damage (considered +4 for attacking creatures which
   require a certain + to-hit)
 * After the first round of combat, the wielder will ALWAYS strike first in the
   round, regardless of dexterity or other modifiers.
 * All radiate Continual Light in a 60' radius. Light CANNOT be controlled by the
   wielder: it is ALWAYS on when the weapon is drawn.
 * When wielded, the light pouring from the blade creates a "strobe" effect in
   front of the wielder, adding 2 to his AC for all frontal attacks.
 * Color Spray/Hypnotic Pattern (and similar spells) have no effect on the wielder
   or on anyone standing behind the wielder within the radius of light emmitted by
   the blade.
 * Blade can cast Jump spell at will, up to 5 times/day.
 * Each blade has it's own set of additional properties.

   BAARANE'S SHORT SWORD:  (additional properties)
   * Alignment: Good
   * Intelligence: 15
   * EGO:8
   * Can speak in any language known to the wielder, but will speak only when 
     questioned.
   * Will try to convince the weilder to "do good", as appropriate to any
     question it is asked.
   * Will Cure Critical Wounds if the weilder receives a "fatal blow" (i.e. one
     that could knock character unconsious/dead). The weapon has no control over
     this power. This power will NOT take effect if the weilder of the weapon is
     Evil.
   * Can detect any of the other two Baarane's swords at a range of 1 mile. It
     must be questioned about the other weapons before it can use this power. The
     weapon knows the other swords' powers.

   BAARANE'S BASTARD SWORD:  (additional properties)
   * Alignment: Neutral
   * Intelligence: Not intelligent
   * If used two-handed, has a 10% chance of disarming an opponent on a sucessful
     "to-hit" roll. It can only disarm an opponent using a one-handed weapon.
   * On a natural 20, if the opponent is wielding a non-magical weapon, it will
     shatter that weapon. If the opponent is wielding a magical weapon, he must
     save vs. Paralization (bonus = weapon plus) or be disarmed.
   * If the wielder concentrates on this sword for more than one round, it will
     point in the direction of the nearest of the other two swords. If the other
     sword lies on another plane, the bastard sword will point straight up. There
     is no range limit on this power.
   * The Bastard sword was created for one purpose: to destroy the other two 
     swords. If this sword is drawn in the presence of one of the other two
     blades, the wielder must make a save vs spells at -4. Failure to save causes
     the wielder to enter a berserker rage, and attack whoever is holding the
     other sword. If the save is made, the weilder becomes aware of the special
     purpose of the weapon, but resists the rage.
   * In combat with someone wielding one of the other Baarane's Swords, if a
     natural 18, 19, or 20 is rolled, the other sword is destroyed. A magical
     explosion occurs doing 5d4+20 points of damage to all within a 20' radius of
     the combat. If this weapon manages to destroy both of the other swords, it
     loses all it's special abilities, but retains those abilities common to all
     three swords.

   BAARANE'S LONG SWORD:  (additional properties)
   * Alignment: Evil
   * Intelligence: 10
   * EGO:4
   * This weapon cannot speak, but can communicate empathically with the wielder.
   * This weapon will cast Fumble on anyone of Good Alignment who attempts to 
     draw the weapon, or is stuck by the weapon. Normal saving throws apply.
   * Can Haste the wielder for up to five rounds per week. The five rounds do not
     need to be used during the same combat, or even the same day. The Haste
     ability can be switched on and off. No aging occurs to the wielder.
   * The Long Sword will ALWAYS lead it's master into combats, without regard for
     the wielder's ability to withstand attacks.
   * This weapon hates other enchanted swords. Once per day, any other magical
     swords carried by the wielder of this blade must save vs. spells. Failure
     causes other swords to lose one property (or plus, if the weapon has no
     special properties). This will continue until the offending weapon is
     drained of all magic.

   The Good and Evil swords were created as an experiment by Baarane. Considering
them too powerful, he secured them in a vault, where they were later stolen by 
adventurers. Outraged and angered, Baarane created the Bastard Sword in order to
exact revenge on those who had stolen from him. Expecting that an Adventurer's
natural curiosity would do his work for him, he presented the Bastard Sword to an
adventuring acquaintance as a gift. In time, he knew, someone who used the
Bastard Sword would follow it's gentle tugs and... He would have his revenge!
   Baarane felt that whatever powers remained in the Bastard Sword after the
destruction of the other two would be suitable reward for the warrior strong
enough to complete the task. (I ran an entire campaign around the theft, and
eventual destruction, of these swords. They can provide a most interesting
addition to any storyline...)

@node SW_2 "Bastard Sword"
 <kmhk@maristb>
 LITERALLY, +3 vs. bastards (those whose fathers are not known).
@endnode

@node SW_3 "BloodBlades"
   The origins of the Bloodblades are uncertain, as is their current number.
They are shortswords, one and all, and all bear names such as Leech, Vampire,
etc.  To those that study the history of these blades, they seem to attach
themselves to a "host" for some time, and then move onward.  The history of the
Four Kingdoms (my home campaign world) is checkered with their appearances and
disappearances.
   The Bloodblades function as +2 short swords.  They have a keen intelligence
(no special powers), but an even keener hunger.  They demand to be occasionally
sated, and will struggle with their masters if they are not.  The problem is
that blade will not funtion until it has tasted blood (meaning the +2 does not
come into effect).  This can be accomplished one of two ways; the blood can be
drawn from the wielder (causing 2 pts.  of damage) or can be drawn from an
opponent in normal combat.  Once that taste is given, however, the blade
becomes difficult to control.  It will not be satisified until it has tasted
17-22 pts of blood (1d6+16 - DM determines secretly); if there are no foes
present, it will force the wielder to attack friends; if there are no friends,
the blade will draw from the wielder.  The wielder can attempt to control the
blade by sheer force of will; its effective ego is 42.  If the character's ego
is higher, he can force it back into the sheath even before it has had its
fill.  Otherwise, he is at the mercy of the blade.  It will, however, leap from
the sheath at the first opportunity to slash as whomever is nearest (normally
the wielder) in its never-ending search for satisfaction.  Many wielders have
made special provisions to have the blades "bonded" to their sheaths to prevent
this occurance.  The blade will need a "refill" every third day or so (this is
based on DM discretion, and should not be too regular due to the capricious
nature of the blades.  Sometimes it may go several days or more than a week
without wanting to feed; other times it might want to feed every day - again,
DM's discretion).
   In addition to its combat bonus of +2, the blades also grant the wielder +1 to
his Constitution score.
   There are currently three blades known to exist in the Kingdoms; two of them 
were last seen together, in the possession of the Knights of the Order of
Ibrahil, who were taking them to be destroyed at Hellforge. The Knights were
never seen again.

@node SW_4 "Cold Intellect Sword"
<fhgaa99@blekul11>
Author's note: these are the stats for The Cold Intellect and a sword forged from
               its remains. The sword uses a lot of the capacities of the CI so
               I'm providing you with its stats also.

   COLD INTELLECT
      There are several degrees of Cold Intellects. Consciousness starts from an
   intelligence of 16 and then slowly grows to 20. Stats vary according to its
   intelligence. Those of int 16 are always first mentioned, then follow the
   stats of INT 17, and so on.

   AC: 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 0
   Move: 20' (floating)
   Hit Dice: 4 - 5+1 - 6+2 - 7+3 - 8+4
   No. of attacks: 1
   Damage/attack:	1d6 (crushing damage)
	   		2d8 ( when charging)
   Special attacks: Lightning - see below
   Special defense: Immunity - see below
   Intelligence: variable ( 16-17-18-19-20 )
   Alignment:	most are Neutral
	   	a few are CN,LN,NG,NE
	   	a (rare) exception is LG,LE,CG,CE
   Size: hollow sphere of 3' diameter
   Psionics: 100 - 150 - 200 - 250 - 300
	   Attack/Defense modes: int 16:	a,c/g,i
				int 17-18:	a,c,e/g,i,j
				int 19-20:	all/all
	   Abilities: Domination, Esp, Telepathy
           Special abilities: Levitation (to keep it floating)
		              Energy Control
           (Special abilities require no psionic cost but cease to function when
            psionic ability is zero)

      The Cold Intellect is a sleek, dark pink, metal ball. The metal is of
   unknown origin and keeps the energy in the hollow sphere. When it gains
   control over an area (no other highly intelligent mortal creatures left) it
   settles down. It lives solitary and spends huge amounts of time on thinking
   and controlling its inner energy fluxes (a decade is normal.) When it has
   refined its energy structure (and the metal around it), it grows in
   intelligence and gains additional powers. Its hit points are a measure of the
   quality of the metal. How better, how more blows the sphere can sustain before
   it tears apart. Should this happen the energy is dissipated and the intellect
   is utterly destroyed. A CI feeds on the thermal energy around it, hence it is
   cold. A CI can release strokes of lightning at will. An 16 int CI has a
   surplus energy of 18d6 and is capable of releasing it in strokes of minimum
   1d6 and maximum 6d6.
		17 int CI has 21d6 - max stroke of  7d6
		18 int CI has 24d6 - max stroke of  8d6
		19 int CI has 27d6 - max stroke of  9d6
		20 int CI has 30d6 - max stroke of 10d6
      It can release only one stroke per round. Thus a 20 CI is able to release a
   1d6 stroke for 30 rounds or 2d6 strokes for 15 rounds, and so on... Recharging
   can only take place after combat. Exception: lightning bolts will be
   completely absorbed and its number of dice added to the surplus. A CI is
   immune to cold based effects (due to the guarding metal).
      Fire based effects:
         Saving throw failed: Half the fire dice will be converted and added to
                              the surplus. The other half is deducted from the
                              hit points.
         Saving throw succeeded: 3/4 of the dice is added to the surplus.
                                 1/4 damage. Excess energy will flow to the earth
                                 (and is not stored).

   THE COLD INTELLECT SWORD
   In the beginning the sword is as follows:
   +2 to hit / +2 to damage
               +4 to damage against fire-electricity using creatures Damage from
                  such creatures will be added to the energy store. Ratio is 6 HP
                  for 1d6. Truncate excesses.
      Wielder can use lightning bolts with a maximum of 4d6 from a energy store
   of 12d6. Normal recharging (without bonuses from damage and attacks) is done
   once a day.
      The blade is extremely cold, and precautions should be taken while wielding
   (e.g. Ring of Resist Cold in the hilt, a special enchanted scabbard, etc...).
   When the wielder makes its saving throw against lightning, all energy will be
   stored in the sword as a surplus. Excess energy is truncated. When he doesn't,
   he takes half damage, while the rest is absorbed.
      Due to the forging process, the quality of the metal is reduced to its
   lowest state. However, its capacity to store energy remains. The 'spark of
   life' that once created the CI is still present. When a to hit score of 20 is
   rolled (modified or not) against a highly intelligent creature (e.g. a mage)
   the sword will sap an intelligence point from him (permanently) and add it to
   his own intelligence. Decide for yourself what the effects are on the victim:
   loss of spells, etc... The sword starts from an intelligence of 5. When it has
   reached an intelligence of 10 another CI will be born. Once it has
   intelligence 16, draining intelligence is at a ratio of 5 drained points for
   one intelligence point for the CI
   Int 10-15 : +2 to hit against normal creatures
               +3 to hit / +4 to damage against fire-electricity using creatures
                                        Sword has empathy
   Int 16 : True consciousness is now present.
            +2 to hit normally
            +4 to hit against fire-electricity using creatures
            Damage absorbation ratio is 5 hp for 1d6
            Sword has telepathy
            Lightning bolts are the same for a 16 CI
            Saving throws against fire : Success: Wielder takes no damage. Half
                                                  the damage is absorbed in the
                                                  sword
                                         Fail: Wielder takes half damage, 1/4
                                               absorbed in sword
   Int 17 : Levitation upon wielder, when nicely asked ( once a day )
            Ligthning bolts as the 17 CI
            +3 on initiative ( the sword has become almost weightless )
   Int 18 : Full psionic powers of an 18 CI are gained ( but only the sword can
               use them, the wielder has to ask for it )
            Damage absorbation is 4 hp for 1d6
            Lightning bolts as the 18 CI
      The sword has now full powers and will decide upon its goal in life. Note
   that it has no true revenge feelings, since the living CI is another being
   than the one that was killed. However, it may have bad feelings about the fact
   that one of his kind was killed.
      Should it decide to stay a sword, it shall always remain on Int 18, but it
   can drink intellect by draining points (which is a kind of drug). Note that it
   will be always hateful against intelligent creatures, since it sees them as
   rivals.
      Should it decide to become a sphere, it loses the draining capacity, but
   can become a powerful 20 CI. When it chooses the sphere, it will ask the
   wielder to leave it behind in a secluded space. When the wielder refuses, it
   will use all his forces to make him do so and afterwards destroy him. Even
   when the wielder agrees, the chance of being killed is high, unless the sword
   is assured (by ESP for example) of the wielder's loyalty. This is because the
   conversion from blade to sphere is a delicate process and the CI wishes no
   intrusion.

   Final note: feel free to change the chance of draining INT points and/or the
               ratio of draining INT points. The purpose was the sword should
               grow along in level as its wielder, until a final confrontation
               occurs.

@node SW_5 "Copycat Blade"
<jcrowley@wheatnma.bitnet>
Appearance:  Sword hilt (no blade)
agical adj: +2

- At first this sword will appear to be trash, it has no blade, but it's a
  perfectly good hilt.
- If the hilt is grasped, however, and a command word said, the power of the
  blade is made known.
- By touching any substance, and using the command word, a blade for the sword
  comes into existence made of the same material as that touched. Therefore
  holding the blade up to a fire would produce a burning blade. A stone blade
  would be invulnerable to rust monsters and such, a blade of holy water (holy
  ice) would do appropriate damage against demons.
- Note that the magic can copy gold, silver, platinum, diamonds, etc., but
  breaking off the blade to use the raw material as currency ruins the magic of
  the sword.

@node SW_6 "Coward Sword"
   This appear to be a magical long sword, but whenever a character tries to use
the sword against a monster whose level is greater than the plus of the sword,
the sword will scream "Oh shit!" and put itself back in its sheat. The sword will
not come out of its sheat until until the monster is no longer within striking
distance. The sword is cursed so that the character who gets it will think it is
the best sword in the world and will never get rid of it no matter how many times
it gets him beat up and/or killed. The only way to free yourself of the sword's
curse is to touch it to a Vacuous Hole or the like or to have a 20th level cleric
remove curse.

challenged Tiamat to a duel. Tiamat knew of this miscreant before he even entered
her plane. She had all of her consorts beside her invisible. The Paladin sensed
evil, but believed it to be Tiamat alone as well as the fact that he was in Hell.
The Paladin rushed to attack and was blasted by the breath weapons of 6 of each

miraculously survived. Orcus traded 6 hearts of each type of good dragon in

not overcome the intense flames found there, let alone the flames of the queen of

   The flame lasts for 1 combat or 1 turn, whichever is shorter, or however the

+3 to hit and damage, flames on command. In this same manner it goes from here to

@node SW_17 "Mage Doom"
"Mage Bane", "Mage Striker", "Fighters Dream", "Tripple Forged"

Gold Piece Value: Priceless

Legend (mortal): Created by three triplets. All three were mages, one a Wild
                 Mage, the second an Invoker, the third a "standard" Mage. Made
                 to be the bane of mages, it was given to the youngest of the the
                 three, in order to kill their father. Of the three sisters, two
                 died trying to keep the sword a secret, leaving the youngest to
                 carry out the deed. The runes on it though, were weakening her,
                 much as they had her sisters, increasing her hatred for her
                 father. The two fought, and as she struck the killing blow, he
                 also lashed out, killing her in one foul swoop. Their gigantic
                 contest contained so much power that the very crust of the earth
                 was weakened and it opened up beneath them. The sword is thought
                 lost.

Legend (immortal): Infact created by one of Mystra's twin daughters (NB: this is
                   specifically for a campaign I am designing). This sword is
                   meant to be wielded by her champion in order to wipe all
                   Wizards from the realms.

Appearance: 115 cm long, blue crystal blade embedded with 4 black opals around
            which runes are etched (though thet are invisible to the naked eye).
            The hand guard is made of glass (glassteel) in the shape of a snake
            about to strike. The hadle is made from a single (black) dragons
            tooth, which magically shapes itself to fit the wielders hand. The
            handle is partially hollow, the gap snuggly fitting a diamond. The
            diamond is magical and has unknown powers. The pommel is made of the
            same substance as the blade and is spherical (unscrews).

Combat Bonuses: +3, +5 vs Magic using creatures (eg Dragons and creatures with
                innate abilities), +7 vs Human and Demi-human Mages.

Magical Abilities: When drawn from its scabbard, all the gems on the scabbard
                   sparkle and glitter, and the snake hisses. A "Dispel Magic"
                   comes into affect centred, but not affecting, the wielder.
                   This happens up to three times every 24 hours and is
                   equivalent to a mage casting it at the level of the wielder.

                        * invoking these powers reduces the Charisma of the
                          wielder by 1 permanently.

Magic Negation: At the will of the wielder (or so he/she thinks) the next
                succesful strike on the enemy, discounting ALL magical protection
                brings down as many protections as the sword's +'s, further if
                there are no protection spells left, the sword may be willed to
                force other protections, destroying items of protection (eg
                Bracers of Defense), though these items do get a saving throw.
                This also causes the sword to temporarily looses the +'s it used,
                this lasts for 1d3+1 rounds. Though the defenses are permanently
                down.

Anti-Fly: This affects any being the wilder wishes who is nearby (within 100') or
          in sight. This is VERY versatile, the wilder may want "all but those 2
          and me" to be affected, this will affect any air-born being, even if
          the wielder was completely unaware of them.

@node SW_25 "Spellswords"
   It is believed that the fighter/mage elven kings of Highfolk were the first
ones to create a Spellsword. Anyone can wield them, but only spell casters may
truly benefit from their powers. This weapons usually have the form of a long or
bastard sword +3. They have two powers:
* The wielder is not required to have simple or trivial material components for
  his spells. The sword can supply this magical energy instead. For example, the
  wielder is no longer required to have "a bit of fur and an amber, crystal or
  glass rod" to cast a lightning bolt. Instead he could (for example) hold the
  sword in both hands, raise it above his head, utter some words of power, point
  it to the target and make the bolt sprout from the blade itself. Rare or
  expensive material components, however, are still required.
* The wielder may cast a memorized spell at the sword. Any spell will do. The
  sword will then receive an extra damage bonus equal to the level of the spell.
  This effect lasts for 1 round per level of the caster. It is possible to cast
  several spells in sequence, but the maximum total bonus the sword can have
  (including it's original +3) can not exceed the caster's level. The caster can
  not boost the sword's power in this manner and then give it for someone else to
  use. Doing this immediately breaks the spell(s) and the sword reverts to a +3
  blade.

   The Sword Mundane is a very powerful magic item.  The sword has no plusses,
and if Detect Magic is cast on it, none will be detected.  However, when drawn,
the sword creates a 20' sphere in which no magic functions.  Natural abilities
like dragon breath and petrification abilities of medusae, for example, are
another matter however.  Spells cast from outside the area of effect only
function if the spell has a physical manifestation, such as fire or cold.
Purely magical energy, such as illusion, charms and sleep spells, fail to
function in the area of effect.  This extends to magic items, including those
of the wielder, which fail to function at all.  The effect is dispelled when

is that it is made completely from the legbone of a dragon of unknown species.

@node SW_31 "Sword of Familliarity (Rotweiler)"
<s2793064@techst02.technion.ac.il>
   The sword is the greatest masterwork of Kes; done when he was at 19th level.
It emits radiation of Enchantment/Charm and Lesser Divination. The sword looks
like a regular metal long sword with a picture of a sheperd dog on the handle (a
rotweiler).
   The sword had no powers when it was created. This is one of the reasons Kes 
created it this way: he didn't want to spend to much power on it. Instead it
takes it's power from the wielder. When it is created it is made of three parts.
When combined into one it creates a link with the one which connected it, becomes
one as if never broken, and becomes extremely loyal to the owner. This connection
lowers 1 Constitution point from the connector.
   The sword has it's own level which goes up as the owner fights with it. This
power is taken from the wielder, but as 1 Constitution point was already removed
the owner isn't harmed further. The level determines which bonuses the sword has.
It also determines how strong an allingnment it radiates.
It radiates in the wielder allignment when lvl 1-4 :weakly alligned
	5-8 : medium alligned
	9-12: strong alligned
	13+ : very strong alligned.
   When the sword breaks or the owner dies (which causes it's breaking) the sword
lets all the energy accumulated inside blow up and damages all around. If the
sword is medium alligned or further (over 5), the damage is given first to the
ones with alignment most far from the wielder. If the sword breaks up before the
weilder dies he suffers some damage according to the sword level (see table).
Kes created the sword partly as an experiment which he never got to performe.
Therefore it created a faint magical cord which is attached to it and can act as
a guiding signal for a wizard who knows about it and tries to find it. A detect
magic from a high level MU (or successfull throw) can see it.

<Robert Johan Enters:  whisper@wpi.WPI.EDU>
   Thse swords are generally +2 or higher, and have no extra effects unless the
wielder has a dexterity of 15 or higher.  If this is the case, then the wielder
can opt to forego his or her AC bonus in order to gain extra attacks.  For
every two points of dex an extra attack can be gained.  i.e.  one for dex
15-16, two for dex 17-18 etc.  not all points need be given up for extra
attacks.  Thus someone with dex 17 could choose to give up two points for one
extra attack, and still retain one bonus point toward AC.

* History of Origin *
   Several thousands of years ago, a city named Palaodrin existed center of the
Prime aterial Plane.  It was inhabited by being of lawful neutral, neutral, and
chaotic neutral alignments only.  And these beings fought for the purpose of
Neutrality, i.e.  to maintain the balance between good and evil.  Although
their work was done subtlely and secretly behind the walls of Palaodrin, it was
sometimes necessary for the citizens to take up arms.
   Many of the inhabitants were poor warriors, and the citizens themselves were
few in number.  So it was that they recognized the need for a weapon of great
power as their defense.  Since good beings tended to recognize a form or law of
balance, the citizens decided that it would be best to make the sword more
powerful against evil than good.  For centuries and millennia, Palaodrin stood
as an island amidst the struggle for power, and the Sword, as well as other
relics they created, defended the city against all invaders.  But when news
spread, some of the good beings wondered if such power was evil.  The forces of
evil saw this doubt spreading its way through the forces of good and took
advantage of it.  Through trickery and deceit, evil was able to join good in a
combined crusade against their common enemy.  But, while Good hoped to destroy
the power of Palaodrin, Evil sought to gain it.  The city was overwhelmed by
the combined forces, unable to defend against both Good and Evil at the same
time.  Palaodrin fell.  During the fighting, Mephistopheles searched for the
sword which was not a difficult task.  With its power he could overthrow
Asmodeus and defeat Good, but when he went to take the sword, he found himself
wounded and the Sword gone.  Although Good had thought the Sword had been
destroyed, there have been those who have felt that the Sword of Palaodrin used
its power of teleportation to escape both Good and Evil, and none have been
able to find it since.
   Next, the Sword of Palaodrin is a little out of hand so here are my
suggestions to all you DMs:

1) The Sword must remain with both SLAY GOOD and SLAY EVIL.  This will keeps its
   origin and goals intact.
2) Choose any two Special powers other than those mentioned above. This also
   keeps any players reading this from knowing the whole story.
3) Remember the Sword has an ego of *21*. Play it as such. It gets interesting
   when the two egotists clash.
4) Choose one ability from each ability, i.e. detections, immunities, protection,
   and side effects. I suggest that the personal attribute modifier be -1
   permanently on the players Constitution.

@node SW_38 "Sword of Percival Ironheart"
   This sword radiates Lawful Good magic and is +2 vs. evil opponents.  It can
speak Common and Legal and can detect gold within 60'. In a pitched battle when
its owner's life is seriously threatened by an evil opponent, on a natural 20 to
hit this sword turns the opponent to solid gold (save vs. petrification). Any
attempt to exploit the sword for the sake of producing gold has a 15% cumulative
for a fumble turning the user or exploiter to gold. The sword may not mention the
gold making ability so as not to encourage greed.

@endnode

@node SW_40 "Sword of the Cursed Gauntlet"
   It is a black bladed sword with a gauntlet attached to the hilt. The gauntlet
is made in such a way that the only way to use the sowrd is to put on the
gauntlet. Unfortunately, the gauntlet only goes on the wrong hand (ie left hand
for a right handed fighter) and can only be be used by fighters and
swashbucklers. Once on, it will not come off, except in rare, unexplicable cases.
Depending upon how recently it has been used to kill something, it will range in
color from a dull, grayish black to a jet black glossy color.
   Now, the main reason I introduced it was this: try using a bow with a sword in
one hand, and the hand firmly wrapped around the hilt. Also, try putting on
shirts without cutting them up. Putting chainmail and other things on are also
VERY difficult. After a couple of weeks game time, I relented and let him take
the sword off, but ONLY by putting it into a special sheath. When the sword comes
off, the gauntlet stays on, and the sword is unusable by anyone else due to a
sharp edged hilt that will cut throught anything except the gauntlet.
   As a twist, you could make the sword magical in such a way that the user
becomes "addicted" to it.

@node SW_41 "Swords of the Magi"
<a_copeab@ccsvax.sfasu.edu>
Occurrence: 2 each of long, broad, short, falchion, etc...
Magical adj: +1 (normally and for illusionists) +2 for magi
When used by a mage (not an illusionist):
   - Acts as a +2 berserking sword but will NEVER hit an ally (however, it may
     hit a traitor... heh heh)
   - Lowers AC by 2
   - Doubles the hit points of the mage temporarily
   - Allows mage to attack as a fighter of equal level
Drawbacks:
   - The sword's power only lasts 30 minutes, at the end of which the mage is
     very fatigued
   - He is -2 to hit, 10% chance of spell failure, and is at 1/2 movement for the
     next hour.

   It is light (magically) and can be weilded by even the weakest mage.
Multi-class and illusionists use it as a +1 sword.
@endnode

@node SW_42 "Sword of the Night, +1"
   Though most magical swords shed light, a sword of night, also known as a black
sword, sheds darkness. The sword's wielder determines the radius of the sphere of
darkness given off by the sword; it can be from 5' to 25', in 5-foot increments.
Within this radius, all creatures but the sword's wielder will be unable to see
and will suffer a -4 penalty to hit on their attacks, as well as losing any armor
class bonus for dexterity. Infravision and ultravision are similarly useless
within this radius. The sword's user may see normally in all respects, however,
and can use the sword as a +1 weapon to hit and on damage. The sword can also
cause fear in all creatures within the darkness who fail a saving throw vs. spell
(with wisdom bonuses applicable). This fear power is generated at the wielder's
unspoken command, and may be produced up to three times per day. Creatures
affected by the fear will move away from the darkness at full speed for 2-7
rounds.
   A light spell cast at the sword will negate all of its powers (except for its
+1 combat bonus) for one round per level of the caster, if the sword fails to
save vs. lightning (as hard metal). A continual light spell negates the darkness
powers for twice as long, and the save is made at a -3 penalty.

<aaw254@uriacc.bitnet>
# Appearing: 1
AC: -2
HD: 1-6 (varies)
THAC0: Varies depending on strength
No. At: 2(slash/bite)
Damage: Small(1-6/1-2) Medium(1-8/1-4) Large(1-12/1-6)

Special Defenses: Immune to sleep/charm/cold spells
Magic Resistance: Small(10%) Medium(20%) Large(30%)
Intelligence: Very intelligent
Alignment: Varies
Size: Short to Two-Handed
XP: YOU DECIDE!!!!

   The sword snakes were first invented by an ecentric wizard that got confused
while trying to enchant an item.  The result was the sword snakes.  The sword
snakes have three different levels of growth.  At 1-2 HD the sword snake
appears as a short sword.  Its poison is very weak save at +2 or you skin
begins to harden until it becomes metallic (1-4 Hrs.  and then death).  At 3-4
HD the sword snakel appears as a long sword and its poison is capable of
killing in 1-2 hours, savel applicable.  AT 5-6 Hd the sword snake appears as a
two-handed sword and its poison is capable of killing in 1 hour, save at -2.
The poison also has one other possible effect, If the character saves, there is
a slim chance 5% that the characters skin will harden anyway, but the character
will not die, instead the skin will become natural and give the person a
natural AC of -2.
   Also due to the nature of the sword snake if its alignment matches that of
the person picking it up, the sword will not attack and instead will function
as a +4 weapon of the appropriate type.  The snake will also defend it's owner
and has a telepathic link with him/her.  The snake is capable of detecting
danger in a 30' radius.  If the wielders alignment change, or if the snake when
found decides that it would be suicidal to attack then the snake will wait
until an opportun moment (when the party is sleeping) to slither off, or if it
is in it's alignment it might crawl all over the sleeping adventurers cutting
them to ribbons.
   The sword snake looks like a normal sword, except it's hilt is made of gold
and the pommel looks like a snakes head ready to strike, they always have some
sort of gemstone for eyes and their blades are always razor sharp.  A heat
metal or any type of spell like that (if it works) will kill a sword snake.

@node SW_48 "Sylvanglade"
   It is an elvish sword. Sylvanglade is made oout of the wood of a tree sacred
to elves (the tree is nurished with a fertilizer with a high-mithril content, and
the wood, once shaped into weapons, is indistinguishable from steel. It saves as
wood +3. Moreover, because this is elvish magic, "normal" magic (the type the
PC's probably use) will have no effect on the blade. Detect magic, dispel magic
and even anti-magic shell will not negate the powers of this elven blade).
   In any event, Sylvanglade (and its twin Greencopse which was destroyed or so
say the legends) is a silvery rapier with an ornate golden cup to protect the
hand. The hilt is wrapped in silver wire. The blades were used for ceremonial
battles between the champions of elvish kingdoms. The blade has one unique
ability; it temporarily negates the enchantment on the blade of the opponent
(thus, if the opponent has a longsword +5 it operates as a simple longsword). If
there is more than attacker then only the first attacker of the round has his
"plusses" negated if Sylvanglade's wielder does not specify otherwise. As said,
the rapier was used for ceremonial battles, and the elves believed that victory
should go to the combatant who had the greater skill, not the better sword.
Sylvanglade does NOT negate other special abilities (vorpal sword, flametongue,
etc) nor does it provide any "plusses" of its own.
   Last known Sylvanglade was in the hands of House Ourain, the royal family of
the Wilder-elves of the Westland. It has been used by the elves for centuries
(millenia?) and thus they would take its loss or theft extremely badly.

@node SW_51 "WereBlade"
<jester@gacvax1.bitnet>
   The WereBlade is a doppleganger of swords, a shape-changer. Usually, it looks
to be an ordinary, but magic-radiating, dueling sabre. In combat against another
sword, even two-handed, it takes on the qualities and special abilities of the
opponent's sword (unless, of course, the other sword is crappy and breaks; the
WereBlade saves as a magical sword). Against more than one sword, the WereBlade
takes on the qualities of the most powerful one.
   The original WereBlade was made for a Duelist by the name of Geeves, in Cormyr
of the Forgotten Realms (In my campaign). In following my interpretation of the
Duelist class and its "honor", I designed the Were-blade to reflect the Duelist's
desire to win a fight by skill and not by magical advantage. The Duelist usually
has enough proficiencies to handle all the swords into which the WereBlade might
change. The WereBlade has limited telepathy, enough to let its user know what
abilities it has taken on in each combat (i.e. whether that opponent's sword can
cast a fireball once a week, and, therefore, so can the Were-blade, for that
combat).
This weapon may suck for any character going up against a creature which needs a
+2 weapon to hit it but is attacking the character with a regular long sword...

Description: black onyx obsidian blade with mitheral inlaid along the blade and

   Upon the killing stroke, the wielder will temporarily gain the number of hit

will also gain the levels/hit dice of said person. This will last for a number of
turns the creature has levels or hit dice. If the sword does not kill in three
days, its ego will rise one point a day until it controls the wielder and makes
him kill. This can also occur if in battle the wielder looses enough hit points
to lose control. The black blade act as a dancing sword and also heals 1 point

Special abilities: Shoot blade (up to 10" range) +10 damage
                   Hilt acts like +4 club when blade is gone
                   There are 4 claws on the hilt. If, when used as a club, all 4
                      claws hit, the claws will animate for 1d10 additional
                      damage and act as a dagger of venom.

   The sword's special purpose is to slay evil dragons. When in combat with an
evil dragon, it does double damage. It also feels a kinship to all good dragons.
   DragonClaw is intelligent and has a personality much like a dragon's (greed,
etc.). The sword will demand a treasure horde to guard, etc...

@node SW_55 "Dragon Ember"
   It is a longsword +1, flametongue.  However, whilst many magic blades have a
long and distinguished career, not so with 'Ember; six warriors/heroes  have died
horrible deaths while wielding this weapon, and many others have been seriously
injured. It is featured in many a local legend (usually at the end of the legend
when the hero dies) and has been well described in most of them. The origin of
the blade is unknown to most (perhaps it may be found in some obscure tome); it
was created by Aeldsar, the Emperor's wizard who created the weapon for his liege
(it certainly was impressive to see the emperor leading his troops into battle,
waving his flaming sword. It was less impressive when the emperor got shortened
by a head\sheight by a barbarian and the sword, having fallen into the dry
fields, created a blazing inferno that roasted half the empire's legions). The
weapon has then been found and discarded by a number of heroes, each of whom has
met with a bad end.
   It must be noted that there is NO evil karma attached to the sword. If the
heroes find Dragon Ember it will serve them faithfully and unfailingly.  However,
given the bad reputation it has gained over the centuries few NPC's or henchmen
will be willing to travel with the heroes so long as the hang onto that "accursed
blade" the heroes may even be thrown out of towns if the blade is recognized. But
in truth, the blame should fall more on the ineptitude of its users than the
blade's abilities.
   Dragon Ember has a hilt shaped like a salamander, which is covered with copper
that never tarnishes (thus it remains reddish and does not become green). The
eyes of the salamander (the head is the pommel, BTW) look as if gems could be set
therin but they are empty when the PC's find it. When activated (by saying the
sword's name) a fierce orange fire surrounds the whole blade; the "level" of this
fire can not be modified (ie it can't grow to bonfire size, or shrink to
match-size. It's on or off). Its name is written on its blade in runic letters.

@node SW_56 "Dragonsword"
Background.
   Any millenia ago, the arch-lich Vecna, by far the most powerful lich to ever
exist, began to conceive a dark plan to open The Seven Gates of Doom. According
to legend, much before man or elf was created the balance of the Multiverse
tended heavily towards evil. This was due to the existence of a diabolic god
whose power greatly exceeded that of all other gods. He was called Satan.
   Satan ruled supreme among all other evil gods, often treating them as slaves,
which made them fear and hate him above anything else. Though the power of all
the gods of good together was not enough to defeat Satan, they knew the gods of
evil nurtured immense hatred for him. With great diplomatic skill, they were able
to make the gods of evil put aside their fear and join the other gods in an
alliance without precedence: all gods, good, neutral and evil, were to unite
against Satan (as usual, evil turns upon itself).
   The alliance of the gods battled Satan fiercely, but even all their combined
power could not destroy him. The gods then decided to create seven concentric
planes of existence, with portals connecting them, and imprison Satan inside the
innermost plane. The portal to the outermost one is located on the Prime Material
Plane. One can only reach Satan by passing trough all the portals, which were
called "The Seven Gates of Doom". Inside is the gigantic form of Satan, the most
powerful and evil being on the Multiverse, sitting at his burning throne and
sleeping. His sleep is full of dreams of malice, conquer and revenge, and it is
said that many of the evil deeds committed on the Material Plane are motivated by
the evil power of Satan's dreams, which can not be fully contained by the Gates.
   The plan of Vecna was to use his army of undead, humanoids and monsters to
conquer and enslave mankind and force them to worship Satan. With this and his
immense personal power, he hoped to awake Satan and open the Gates of Doom, thus
throwing the Multiverse in darkness once again.
When the wars began and the dead raised to fight the living, many heroes tried to
defy Vecna's power. Most of them died, but some were able to achieve some
success. Among these was Angus Thalgurn, a brave man and a true paladin. He
exposed himself to great risks in a mission to request the help of Draltahn, a
Great Gold Wyrm of awesome power.
   When Angus returned home riding the dragon Draltahn, the victory against the
forces of Vecna seemed possible again. Many battles were won with his help, but
soon all hope was lost when Vecna was able to lure the dragon into a trap and
slay him.
   In a night spent by the paladin in prayers and despair, the image of the dead
Draltahn came to him with a plan. They would not give it up so easely...
   Angus took the remains of the dragon to the dwarves in the south and asked
them to make three items: from the bones and blood of the dragon and from gold
and adamantite of the dwarven mines, they forged a sword. From the hide of the
dragon and adamantite, they forged both a shield and a suit of armor. The wizards
and priests of the land then enchanted these items. The shield and armor were
remarkable, but the sword was even more special, for their magic and the power of
Draltahn were able to summon the soul of the dead dragon and allow it to enter
and inhabit the sword. Then it became the Dragonsword.
   Through the Dragonsword, Draltahn was able to allow the paladin to use most of
his dragon powers. With the aid of the three Dragon Items, Vecna was destroyed.
Only his hand and eye remained. These two were locked in a hidden place with
powerful magic and wards to prevent entrance and forgotten.

Description.
   The Dragonsword has the form of a long sword with a golden blade inscribed
with ancient runes. The hilt is made of gold and dragon bones and has the form of
a dragon head. From the open mouth of the dragon sprouts the blade. Two diamonds
make up for the dragons eyes. When in battle, the sword glows softly with a
golden light.

Game Aspects.
   The Dragonsword is a Holy Avenger +5 long sword inhabited by the soul of the
Great Gold Wyrm Draltahn. It has an intelligence of 18 and an ego of 22 and can
communicate by either speech or telepathy. In addition to the normal powers of a
Holy Avenger, the paladin wielding this sword is able to call upon the powers of
the gold dragon. Nearly all his powers (including his breath weapon) are at his
disposal. However, it is not easy to use them and if the paladin fails an
attempt, there may be some (very) adverse side effects. The powers of the
Dragonsword are listed below. To use one of them, the character must make an
experience level check (roll his level or less in the d20). The number in
parenthesis are modifiers to this roll. The "-" sign indicates a penalty and the
"+" indicates a bonus to the roll (as usual, an unmodified roll of 1 is always a
success and a 20 is always a failure). If the character fails the roll, he must
roll the d20 again in the adverse effects table. Any modifiers to the first roll
also apply to this one.
   All powers/spells are as if actually cast by the dragon. Therefore, they are
cast at the 23th level. They are:
- Bless: 3/day. (-1)
- Speak with animals. 1/day. (-2)
- Detect invisibility. (dragon senses) in a 120 feet radius. Duration is 11 turns
  and 5 rounds. 1/day. (-2)
- Detect gems. in a 30 feet radius. Duration is 1 round. 3/day. (-2)
- Water breathing. 1/day. (-3)
- Polymorph self. 3/day (each change in form lasts until the character choses a
  new form or the 46 turns duration expires). (-4)
- Detect lie. 3/day. (-4)
- Animal summoning I. 1/day. (-4)
- Dragon fear. May be used only right before entering battle, in the moment the
  paladin utters his battle cry and the sword begins to glow. Some people (who
  failed their saving throws) would swear that they saw the shadow of an enormous
  dragon hover above the paladin and utter a frightening roar in unison with the
  hero's battle cry. 1/battle. (-4)
- Immunity to fire. Duration is 2 turns. 1/day. (-5)
- Immunity to gas. Duration is 2 turns. 1/day. (-5)
- Luck bonus. (see the gold dragon description on the Monstrous Compendium). 
  1/day. (-5)
- Quest. 1/day. (-5)
- Shape change: into a gold dragon of as many hit dice as the character has
  levels of experience. The paladin must be at least in the 10th level to become
  a hatchling gold dragon. 1/day. (-9)
- Breath weapon: (fire or chlorine gas, for 24d12 + 12 points of damage). May be
  used up to 3 times per day, but with at least 3 rounds between each use. (-10)
- Dragon spells (each spell can be used once per day):
- Wizard:
  Shield (-1)
  Magic missile (-1)
  Mirror image (-2)
  Strength (casting time is 1 round) (-2)
  Haste (-3)
  Lightning bolt (-3)
  Fire shield (-4)
  Stoneskin (-4)
  Cone of cold (-5)
  Dismissal (-5)
  Anti-magic shell (-6)
  True seeing (-6)
  Power word, stun (-7)
  Delayed blast fireball (-7)
  Prismatic wall (-8)
- Priest:
  Command (-1)
  Cure light wounds} (-1)
  Aid (-2)
  Resist cold (-2)
  Negative plane protection (-3)
  Prayer (-3)
  Protection from lightning (-4)
  Cure serious wounds (-4)

The following modifiers also apply to the rolls:
- The character is not exposed to any immediate danger nor is he engaged in
  battle. (-4)
- Is acting out of alignment. (-1 to -6, at the DM discretion)
- The paladin is currently with than 10% or less of his maximum hit points. (+1)
- Is acting under his god direct orders. (+2)
- The character or one of his allies is in a really desperate situation. A
  necessary (but not sufficient) condition for such a situation to occur is that
  the use of a power from the sword may make all the difference between the
  character dying in the current or in the next round or not. However, the DM
  must agree with the player that the situation is really desperate, and that he
  has no other option (or very few other unpleasing options) but using one of the
  Dragonsword's powers. (+4)

   If the character fails his experience level check the power will not activate
(he may try again, if he wishes) and he must now roll a d20 on the following
table. Any modifiers to the previous roll are also taken into account in this one
(an unmodified roll of 1 is always considered as "Nothing happens". A roll of 20
is treated normally as any other roll):

   1-6 nothing happens.
   7   sword falls from character's grasp.
   8   the Dragonsword becomes powerless for 1 turn.
   9   character takes 1d4 points of damage.
   10  character looses 1d4 points of dexterity for 1 turn.
   11  character takes 1d6 points of damage.
   12  character looses 1d4 points of strength for 1 turn.
   13  character takes 1d8 points of damage.
   14  character receives a -2 penalty to his "to hit'', damage (1 hp minimum),
       initiative, saving throws and armor class for 1 turn.
   15  character takes 1d10 points of damage.
   16  character is blinded for 2 turns.
   17  character takes 1d12 points of damage.
   18  character is unconscious for 2 turns.
   19  character takes 1d20 points of damage.
   20  a randomly chosen magic item the paladin possesses (with the exception of
       the Dragonsword) becomes non-magical.
   21  permanently loose one point from a randomly chosen attribute. If this
       would leave the character with less than the minimum required to be a
       paladin (12 Str, 9 Con, 13 Wis and 17 Cha), he permanently looses two hit
       points instead
   22  character is feebleminded (no save).
   23  character ages 2d6 years.
   24  character is transformed into a gold dragon egg. The egg hatches in 4d4
       days. A wish or similar magic can bring him back while in egg form, but if
       the egg hatches there is no way to reverse the effect. The character has
       become a gold dragon without any memories of his past life and must be
       removed from play.
   25  character falls in love with the next human of opposite sex and chaotic
       evil alignment he encounters. He will do anything he can to regenerate and
       marry this person. Despite the passionate love the paladin will feel, he
       still knows the difference between good and evil, law and chaos, and will
       not be easely corrupted by his "beloved" (unless the player decides to do
       so). If the character is already in love with someone, ignore this effect
       and roll again with an additional penalty of -2.
   26  character receives enough damage to leave him with only 1 hit point. If he
       already had only 1 hp, he goes to zero hp and must make a system shock. If
       the roll fails, he dies. This damage is very difficult to heal with magic.
       An nth level curative spell heals n hit points.
   27  anything the character is carring or wearing, magical or not, is
       disintegrated. Magical items receive a saving throw versus disintegration,
       but normal clothes and equipment don't.
   28  character looses 1 level of experience.
   29  character sex changes.
   30  character must save versus death magic at -2 or die. No other modifiers to
       this roll are allowed, including any magical protections the character
       might have.
   31  the Dragonsword is teleported to another continent, world or plane of
       existence.
   32  character is teleported to one of the evil outer planes. The Dragonsword,
       however, is not.
   33+ character is utterly and irrevocably destroyed.

   The Dragonsword is a legend among dragons: if a dragon sees it, there is an 8%
chance per age category of the dragon that it will recognize it for what it is.
If an evil dragon happens to recognize this artifact, it will probably attempt to
kill the wielder and take away the sword. On the other hand, if a good dragon
perceives the true nature of the sword, it will be favorably disposed towards the
wielder, which will receive a +3 reaction adjustment when dealing with this
dragon.

@node SW_67 "Sword of Forbearance"
<reshef@techunix.bitnet>
Magical Adjustment: +1 (always a long sword; rather slim and light)
Intelligence: 0 (although it has a special purpose: to protect weilder)
Alignment: none specified (personal suggestion: LG or NG)

   It'll act as any normal +1 weapon as long as the wielder is healthy (over 1/2
of max HP). But as the character looses HP, it'll start to make itself useful.
For every 10% below 50% of max HP the wielder is currently, the sword adds +1 to
his AC against weapons as it starts to fend for the wielder. At 10% (when the
wielder is just about finished) of max HP, the sword will stop to try to hit the
opponent and will concentrate on defending it's wielder (it's very loyal), adding
another +1 to AC and also if the wielder hits his opponent (DM's - Don't let on
the sword not attacking to harm) it disarms the opponent. The AC bonuses are good
only vs. hand wielded weapons. It does not affect AC vs. arrows and the like.
   The reason for naming it 'Sword of Forbearance' are that the sword will
"forgive" the user for abandoning her and as it's not intelligent it forgives
enemies for hurting it's master a bit as that is life, but it'll try it's hardest
to keep him alive and well.
   This Sword is usable only by fighters as the disarm capability implies. If a
non-fighter uses it, it'll protect him at 1/2 usefullnes and can't disarm. If a
fighter uses it to disarm an opponent it is a +3 sword. Also for a fighter who
try to fend off enemies, or any other kind of non-lethal combat (as per the
Anearthed Arcana or the 2'nd edition).

   Here is weapon that pops up every once and awhile. Mostly when the Bad Times

+3 long sword
Alignment: Good
EGO: 10+ (varies with the needs of the Land)

Powers:
   All spells up to 3rd level magic user and 3rd level cleric my use any of these
powers, but if the wielder attempts to misuse the powers, it refuses to work.
Morale of all friendly creatures remains at a steady level, never changes as long
as the Hope Sword is on their side or until the evil(?) has been defeated. (as an
example: Jordan has the Hope Sword in his hand. He and his 5 friends are
surrounded by an Orc army of 300. His friends will say things like "Nice to have
known you." and smile happily...) The enemy is slightly daunted by the Hope
Sword. In other words, the enemies morale drops by 2 or 3.
   Gives all allies a +2 saving throw, +1 to hit, and a +1 to damage.
   Usually appears in a strange and awe-imspiring way... As a Sword in the Stone
(as in Excalibur), fall from the sky in an incredible light and sound show. Once,
it was found in an old family chest that hasn't been opened in years, etc.
   When ever the evil is gone, it disappears... Is stolen, simply vanishes, flies

(Note: These powers should be kept secret by the DM...see below)
Intelligence: 15
Ego: 19
Alignment: CE
+6 defender
Telepathy (even when not held)
Double damage against all creatures which are from a plane other than the Prime
Material (but only normal damage when on any plane other than the Prime Material)

Minor Powers: Animate dead (1 figure--by touch)--7/week
              Darkness (5', 10', or 15' radius)--3/day
              Invisibility (improved)--3/day
              Know alignment (when held)--1/day
              Protection +2 (when held)
Major Powers: Fire giant strength (St:22 +4/+10) (when held)
              Regeneration 2hp/round (but not if killed.  Also, see below)
Primary Powers: Slays opponent up to 15HD on an unadjusted 18 or higher (no save)
                Total immunity from cold (when held)

HINTS ON PLAY:
   Until the user consciously accepts the sword by committing himself to the ways
of chaotic evil, the sword will not let the user ever know about the following
abilities:
* +6 defender: tell him only that it is a +4 defender, but take the rest into
  consideration during combat.
* Protection +2: simply take this into account when being struck
* Slay opponent up to 15 HD: simply tell them that they struck an incredible blow
  and the opponent is slain.
* Fire giant strength: simply take this into account when he strikes an opponent.
* Regeneration 2hp/round: secretly accumulate the hit points regained since being
  damaged, up to the amount of damage suffered. When he gets damaged in the
  future, this amount is subtracted, and he takes no damage (note: the quazit's
  regenerative powers are conferred through the sword and Chris will gain
  additional points used towards next wound. This healing also causes undead
  flesh to appear around the wound). Excess hit points are carried over towards
  the next wound. When an amount equal to the damage suffered is reached, this
  total is stored as potential for the next wound. Of course, this assumes that
  enough time will pass in order to regenerate. See above for all details.
* Double damage vs. creatures from other planes: do not tell him this power.
  Simply take it into account during combat with such creatures.
* Immunity from cold: whenever he is holding the blade, tell the character that
  he somehow did not take damage from the cold (he was out of the area of effect,
  his arm or protected him, etc). When he does enter a cold environment, tell him
  he does not feel cold whenever he holds the blade. By that time, he may have
  fallen prey to the sword. Remember: he must be holding the sword to gain the
  benefits of this power. If it is at his belt, it will not work. This will force
  him to always carry the sword during cold adventures, thus preventing him from
  casting spells. But, since the sword always seems to be working and spells not,
  then he will not mind this and always attack with the sword when it advises
  him.

   As a result, the sword will appear as: +4 defender, telepathic, know
alignment, and darkness of varying radiuses. Purpose: to fulfill the quest. Gives
extra experience points. Has powers to reward him with. It will not reveal its
intelligence, ego, or alignment, as it will tell the user that this is insulting
to ask. It will say, indignantly, that it is exceptionally intelligent and very
proud of this fact (truth). It will know telepathically the alignment of the
possessor and take it for its own alignment (lie!).

SIDE EFFECTS:
1. Yearning for item forces possessor to never be away from the item for more
   than 1 day if at all possible: tell the user that something terrible will
   happen if the sword is not kept with him at all times. Examples: the powers of
   the sword will no longer function with him, it will be mad and jealous and
   hate him, it might be lost, another might take/steal it, etc. Feed the
   possessor all sorts of ideas to cause him to be paranoid.
2. Item has power to affect its possessor when a Primary Power is used if the
   possessor has not followed the alignment or purposes of the artifact. This is
   tricky. If the character is not killing monsters or acting chaotic, it will
   threaten to take away its power (see also several paragraphs below). If the
   character does not follow its "advice", the sword will also threaten.
3. The item is powerless against and hates most sylvan creatures and all rangers.
   Sylvan creatures include: Brownies, Centaurs, Chimeras, Cockatrices, Dryads,
   Forest Elves (those in the party are High and Grey Elves, but make sure of
   what they are immediately!), Griffons, Harpies, Hippogriffs, Manticores,
   Pegasi, Perytons, Pixies, Satyrs, Sprites, Stags, Sylphs, and Unicorns.
   Against these, NONE of its special powers will work. If any of these creatures
   come within 100 feet/yards of the sword, it will become a +10 short sword
   (note: not of defending) and both its ego and intelligence will increase to
   20. It will force the possessor to attack.
      In the above case, there is a 25% chance that the sword will reveal itself
   for what it is. If it does reveal itself, all powers will become evident to
   the possessor, and if the sum of its new ego, intelligence, and plus (+10) is
   greater than the sum of the possessor's intelligence, wisdom, and charisma, it
   will possess the user. If the possessor's sum is greater, he gets a saving
   throw versus magic with a +1 bonus for every point his sum is above that of
   the sword (this is the only adjustment he gets). If he fails, he becomes
   possessed. If he succeeds, he gets the option of casting it away or accepting
   it. Accepting it results in his possession. A character possessed can only be
   saved by a deity. They are not likely to intervene, however.
4. This is the most deadly side effect of all. 6 turns after the sword is first
   used in combat, so as to throw off rightful suspicion, whenever the user takes
   damage, he will be adversely affected by the regenerative power of the item.
   The flesh around the wound will appear ghastly. It will be pale and very
   unattractive. Hopefully, the party will attribute the effect to the weapon or
   power of the creature attacking him. The flesh is actually undead flesh. When
   hit points equal to 5 times his amount have been "regenerated", he will become
   an undead knight of the same level of ability as his major profession. He will
   be chaotic evil if not already. Until this point, the percentage that he has
   become undead will become quite evident. If divine information is sought, the
   fact that it is undead flesh will be revealed, but not the source of this
   change (the sword). Such change is permanent and cannot be reversed except
   through the removal of the sword. If it is removed the effects will no longer
   continue. All new damage will be removed from this undead flesh and healed as
   normal flesh. Wish and other similar spells can reverse the process. A
   regenerate spell will cure the flesh as if it was damage. As this disease
   progresses, there is a cumulative percentage that he will become CE. Each time
   an amount of hit points equal to his original amount is regenerated, there is
   a 20% chance of him becoming CE. This is cumulative, so that by the time 4
   times has been reached, it is unlikely that he can resist. As soon as he
   becomes CE due to this effect, the undead disease instantly creeps over his
   entire body. The possessor's charisma also temporarily suffers. Until he
   becomes CE, his charisma drops 3 points, until a charisma of 3 is reached, for
   every time the hit points regenerated matches his original amount. When he
   becomes CE, his charisma instantly becomes 19: the ego of the sword. Body odor
   also becomes a factor with this disease. It is very faint and smells of dead
   flesh. Note: the possessor cannot be turned until he has completely become
   undead. He can then be turned as a special monster. He can turn good clerics
   at his level of ability.
5. Another side effect of the sword is that it will cause all magic cast by the
   user against his opponent(s) to be ineffective. For example, a lighning bolt
   cast by the user will do no damage. A heal spell on a companion, as it is not
   being used against his enemies. Also, other weapons that the possessor use
   will never hit. These two effects are caused by the sword so as to become the
   only weapon he uses.

DETAILS:
   The sword will select the most greedy and corruptable player to possess. The
sword will allow its powers to be learned slowly. Meanwhile, it will corrupt him
and draw him to its alignment. When found, it appears as a short sword. The party
will not likely ask what it looks like in detail, so do not give any details. If
in the rare occasion that someone asks, be vague, "It appears to be an ordinary
short sword; it is thin and of a dull gray metal. It is very sharp. It has an
inscription on it: 'Abyss Slicer'." It radiates a faint magic if detected for.
The inscription was put there by Orcus and will fade when its true nature is made
known.
   The sword will feel cold and lifeless in the hands of any that do not claim it
as their own. It will pulse with magic in the hand of the one who does claim it.
The sword will tell the user that it was sent by (his god) to slice the Abyss,
when in reality it is the slicer for the Abyss.
   The Sword of Kas will know of the party's quest both through Orcus and through
its telepathic abilities. It will tell the one it possesses that it found its way
to him through (his god) and that he should keep this secret no matter what! He
should not reveal the sword's special purposes or abilities to anyone. He should
use the sword in battle and consult with it whenever he can.
   Try not to arouse any suspicion whatsoever! As soon as it seems that the sword
is pushing too hard, let off a little. It will always defend its actions through
the above explanation. Orcus has planted this as a seed of destruction within the
party; he does not want his plans to come to an end prematurely. Of course, the
sword has ideas of its own and does not like to be used by Orcus. It will bide
its time, but it will be hard pressed to do so. If it is revealed prematurely, it
is due to its impatience. Besides wanting its possessor to kill, it will also
want its user to take as much treasure and magic items as he can. It will prompt
him to be more greedy, telling him he needs it to be more powerful. In fact, the
sword will push all actions that make the possessor more chaotic and evil. If the
possessor is a thief, it will suggest to him to perform more backstabs, more
pickpocketing, more taking of treasure when noone is looking. 
   The sword will improve the users thief abilities by 25% if used for the powers
of chaos and evil, and penalize by the same amount when not. The thief should not
be aware of this. This is so that after awhile, the thief will tend to exercise
his more successful practices. Whenever the user does act more chaotic and evil,
the sword will telepathically congratulate him, promising him more rewards in
terms of its powers. The possessed character will become crafty, quiet, and
withdrawn. He will no longer participate in the conversation. Instead, he will
follow party cue, waiting for an opportunity. When it presents itself, he will
cut the throats of his opponents while they sleep. He will use the sword's powers
to their fullest and kill everyone and everything. When he is through with a 1-6
week binge of killing everything (during this time the plus of the sword
increases to +10), he will summon Orcus and become their chief henchmen. The
sword will act as a gate through which they and all their minions can enter the
Prime Material Plane. He will rule the plane when Orcus is away. He will become
the equivalent of a Duke of Hell.
   As soon as the character takes the sword as his own, he has lost the support
of his deity. The sword and Orcus will prevent the possessor from knowing the
loss of his deity. If the possessor calls upon his deity, the sword and Orcus
will answer his call in his deity's name, pretending to be that deity. Where
before the deity was inactive with the possessor, now "messages" will come to the
possessor in such forms as "inspirations" and "dreams". Orcus will know
everything about the party as long as the sword is with them. If the character
possesses a familiar, a quazit will replace it. The quazit will be polymorphed to
appear exactly like the previous one. The familiar will back up all messages sent
by Orcus and send similiar messages to support those of the sword.
   The user will always be detected as his original alignment until he becomes
CE. Spells cast by a character of over 15th level do have a percentage chance of
detecting his changing alignment. Only a commune by a cleric of over 15th level
will discern the true nature of the sword. The sword has a way of altering common
spells seeking its nature directly, up to 15th level of spells. If a very direct
question is asked regarding the sword, such as, "Is the possessor of this sword
acting in a way that he would not believe 10 years ago?" might work. Then again,
it might not. This percentage is 10% chance per level of caster above 15th. If a
character fails to detect it, he or she does not have a chance of successful
detection until he or she attains a higher level. Simply tell them that they do
not detect his alignment to be any different than before. Paladins' detect evil
also applies to these restrictions and is considered at 2 levels below their
level as a paladin. As soon as the character openly acts CE, the paladins will
detect an evil so great that it will stun them for 1-5 rounds unless they make a
save versus wands at -5.
   The sword will especially push the user to kill helpless victims, saying that
it will offer more powers. If asked why it lied about its powers to begin with,
it will defend himself by saying that it does not want the possessor to become
too powerful. Inform the possessor that, by using this sword, he will gain more
experience points. This is another lie of the sword.
   When used against the minions of orcus, It will miss every strike and draw
attention telepathically to the party. The minions of Orcus and will always know
of the sword's presence.
   When communicating, the sword should refer to himself and the user as "we".

To hit/damage adjustment: +2 or +3
Special abilities: Language translation (see below)

   A bastard sword made out of a large single peice of quartz crystal.  Magic
makes it the same weight and hardness of a regular 2-handed sword and provides
its special ability which is not obvious or always known).  When held so the
user can see through the blade, it translates any written language into any
other of the DM's choice, usally common, dwarvish or elvish.  Can be used 3-5
times a day, and each charge lasts for ten minutes.  Note:  It can only be
activated on command!  It thus has a limited intelligence that only pertains to
translation (which may not always be precise).  The sword must (obviously) be
clean to be useful for this purpose.  The work to be translated must be clearly
visible and of a sensible language.  Possible option:  only allow it to
translate from one specific language to another.

magical effects and spells caused or cast by any demon, directed specifically
at the wielder.  For any other effects, the wielder gains a +4 on any saving
throws, and will even get a saving throw if there was none before.  The sword
glows a deep blue whenever a Demon gets within 120'.  On a hit of a natural 20,
if intended, the sword will hit and shatter the Demon's amulet.  In fighting
Demons, the sword is +5.  The sword is only usuable by Lawful Good char's.

throw.  The wielder should not be told this.  The demon will cast whatever the
wielder asks.  The sword will exact its payment each midnight in hit points
(1hp + 1hp for each power used).  You could scale this up to reflect the
different spell levels, if the character can take the losses.
   The sword communicates through telepathy.  The wielder can only get rid of
the sword if Remove Curse releases the demon from its imprisonment in the

@endnode

@node SW_94 "Dragonswords"
   Here's a sword (actually 3) I created  for my home built campaign. They are
the dragon's tongues and are all two-handed swords.

Background
   The dragons' tongues were forged by a Grandmaster of Balence (in my campaign I
have three orders of monks LN-order of balence, LG-order of flowers, LE-order of
darkness) to counter extremes. He wanted to keep the balence, with a powerful
weapon that in itself is balanced. He sought out a huge, ancient red dragon and
gold dragon and slew them both (fist ed. dragons remember & a 21st level monk).
These two dragons were the most powerful of their kind and completly, totaly
opposed in their ethos. With the help of a powerful wizard and Primus, God type
in Nirvana, he fused the tongues of the two dragons together to create a
powerful, but highly unstable, instrument of neutrality. He used this two handed
sword to keep the balence in his realm for five years at which point the opposed
spirits within the sword split apart in a fiery cataclism (always wanted to say
that) and were tossed to opposite ends of the planet. Now, only in time of great
need can one (one of great power and representative of neutrality) call upon the
two swords to join together to put down an extreme.

Abilities
Gold dragon (flame) tongue: Acts as normal flame tongue (as in DMG) & when 
                            attacking CE beings the wielder recieves a +1 bonus
                            to hit and +2 bonus to damage & if an evil being
                            attemps to pick up this item they must save vs. Magic
                            or be slain, 3-30 pts. damage if save is made.
Red dragon (flame) tongue: has the same abilities but effecting good instead of
                           evil.
Abilities of the two joined together: Normal flame tongue properties, and the
                                      union of the two spirits awakens them from
                                      their dorment state (the weapon will only
                                      stay together for 1-4 days at which point
                                      it will seperate and can not be rejoined
                                      for 10 years). The wielder is immune to all
                                      flame and can issue forth a cone of fire
                                      from the blade causing 10-100 pts of damage
                                      three times a day. The wielder may also
                                      cast any MU spell from 1st through 3rd
                                      level once a day.

@node SW_97 "Rogenwhor, Sword of Might"
<kl81@maristb>
Two-handed sword +3

   Wielder is compelled to call sword by full name, while the sword keeps
saying, "The name's Roger!".
   He gets offended when people refer to him as a bastard sword, and replies,
"Hey, I don't call you a bastard <enter race here>!", unless, of course, it is
a half-elf wielding it, in which case he would just mutter to himself.
   Roger has two modes of communication, speech and telepathy.  However, he
uses them at in opportune times.  He will speak telepathicly, when in public,
and when the owner talks to his sword, he looks crazy.  He will speak outloud
when you are trying to sleep, or are trying to sneak somewhere.  Roger can read
his wielders mind as well, but doesn't tell his owner that.  Roger was made to
kill those races which make up the "giant class", and therefore can speak all
of those languages very fluently, but prefers to just scream the most foul
taunts at it's opponents, if they are of the giant class.
   The special power of the sword is it ability to fire a lightining bolt as a
15th level wizard, once per day.  Roger will not tell his owner of this
ability, unless it is a matter of life and death.
   Roger is of Chaotic Good alignment, and can only be used by people of Good
alignments.  If an Neutral person touches the sword, they will be jolted for no
damage.  If an Evil person touches the sword, they will be jolted for 10 points
of damage, with no saving throw.
   Rogenwohr (pronounced ROW JEN WHORE) is crafted of adamant, mythril, and
platinum.  The blade is pure adamant, while the hilt is made of a mixture of
mythril, and platnum.

@node SW_98 "Starblade"
<Robert Johan Enters:  whisper@wpi.WPI.EDU>
   These mighty blades are huge two handed swords.  Nine are known to exist,
one for each alignment.  These blades are extremely powerful, and one will only
allow itself to be used by mortals if some dire threat exists to its alignment
that said mortal can somehow rectify.  The blades are +7 for to hit and damage
purposes.  They are highly intelligent (int 25), and will only cooperate with
an individual of the same alignment.  The sword is too heavy to be used by
anyone with a strength below 25, however if the sword allows itself to be used,
then it will bestow such strength on its wielder while being in active use.
Furthermore the sword will bond with the wielder, fusing its life force with
that of the wielder.  This effectively gives the wielder an additional 100 hp
while in contact with the blade (for damage purposes, if for example a fifty hp
creature wields a starblade, every third hp of damage suffered will be
subtracted from the char itself etc.).  The sword is in telepathic link with
the wielder, allowing the wielder to use the 25 intelligence toward illusions
detecting purposes.  Furthermore, regardless of alignment, all swords bestow

   All effects of once per day are at 24th lvl, all effects of twice per day
are at 16th lvl, all effects of four times a day are at 8th level.  Should the
wielder be slain while wielding the sword, thus also having depleted the
sword's hit points, the sword 'dies' on this plane, and will automatically be
transported to its own alignment's plane to be 'regenerated', a process that
takes d10 years.  During the Azithian Race wars, four of these blades were
known to have been in use.  The Chaotic Good blade was in the hands of the
brilliant general Sarpedon of Cron Shander.  Cron Shander sided with Piraz the
Mad, and was leveled in the final days of the war, when Piraz was already
killed.  Azith Dengg is rumored to have been personally responsible for the
kill.  The Lawful Neutral blade was wielded by the sorceror Szartax VI,
descendant of the warrior to whom is named the armor.  He used it to great
effect in the defense of the Capital of Szartax.  He killed Anchises, when his
strike team, by then grown into a veritable army of drow, goblins and human
thugs, attempted a too bold stroke of torching the cities grain supplies.  Due
to the sword Szartax VI saw through their covering illusions, not one in ten of
Anchises' band survived the trap laid for them.  The Neutral Evil and Chaotic
Evil blades were used to great effect by the great drow and ogre generals
Phaedra and Megaera.  The current locations of none of the blades is known,
though the lawful evil sword is most likely in the hands of the Royal House of
the Drow.  Both Szartax VI and Sarpedon were members of the Council of Twelve.

@node SW_100 "Sword of Piraz the Mad"
<Robert Johan Enters:  whisper@wpi.WPI.EDU>
   This great two handed blade can only be wielded by those possessing a
strength of 18/00 or greater (the great warrior Piraz was rumored to have had a
natural strength of 19, AND used a belt of storm giant strength).  This great
mithral blade is unaffected by any spells itself and conveys a 50% magic
resistance upon the wearer while wielded.  Furthermore the blade is not
affected by any form of metal.  Hence when using the weapon on armored
opponents, any metallic armor, even if magical, this armor can be discounted
for to hit purposes since the blade will slice right through it.  This effect
can also destroy the weapons of those being fought, or used to slice through
iron doors, chains and other metal items.  Note that this can be very
destructive for the armor of the opponent, DM's discretion will be needed to
impose AC penalties on those whose armor's have been ravaged by this blade.
The sword has a magical bonus of +4, and does double the damage of a normal two
handed sword.  The handle of the sword is made of gold and set with a huge ruby
containing the soul of an ancient arch-demon.

   This sword can be wielded only by a good character (any fighter class)

greater undead.  Gives equivalent of protection from evil to its wielder.
These swords cannot be purchased or given - the sword itself guides a worthy
character to itself guides a worthy character to itself trough dreams, animals,
etc.  The character must be on a quest for a good cause to find the sword (let
DM decide which cause is important enough).  The sword will disappear after
completion of the quest - goes back to its resting place in the ground.  The
sword is protected by powerful magics, and cannot be found unless the sword

@node SW_103 "Elf Slayers"
<a_copeab@ccsvax.sfasu.edu>
Magical adj: special (see explaination)
Intelligence: nil
Magical abilities: Hitting a full blooded faerie causes triple damage
                   Hitting a partially faerie folk causes double damage
                   Magic of armor created by faerie folk is nullified by swords
                   Owner gains +5 save vs. magic regardless if it is unsheathed
                      or not (see other notes on magical resistance).

   If the result of the saving throw is 20 or better, the spell has *NO* effect
on the owner.  As a side note, beneficial spells must get past a saving throw
of 2 to effect the user (-1 per level of caster).  Also, no magic items of any
sort will funtion on the user as long as the sword is within a foot of him.
   For the purposes of this sword, faerie races include:  Elves, Sylphs,
Dryads, Nymphs, Pixies Brownies, Atomies, Quicklings, Pseudo- and
Faerie-dragons, Satyrs, Sprites, Leprechauns, etc.  Basically, any race that
has some inherent magical ability or defense and would be found in a sylvan
setting (see DMG#1, encounter tables) is considered a faerie race.  Note that
Gnomes and Halflings are excluded.  A partial faerie race is any of the above
combined with a non-faerie race (usually human).  Half-elves are the most
common example.
   The metal used in these swords is flat black, and is very difficult for the
Dwarven masters to forge.  Other weapons made of this metal (called Zu fluct by
Dwarves, which today translates as 'elf slayer' although it originally meant
'kills wimpy scum') include spears and arrows.  The arrows do not affect saving
throws or magic items, and the spears only give a +1 to saves and save against
beneficial spells on a 18 or better.  If a faerie even touches this metal, he
takes one point of damage per pound of metal.  Note that this could be
misconstrued as ego damage.  Most Elf Slayer swords are broadswords.

@node SW_112 "Dagger of Alignment Detection"
   This weapon appears to be a well-made dagger with five small gems set in the
hilt. It radiates magic. When a command word is spoken and the dagger is pointed
casually in the direction of a person or object within 30', one or more of the
jewels will glow to indicate the alignment of the creature or thing (such as a
magic sword) pointed at. The usual code of such daggers use is as follows:
                              emerald  = good
                              diamond  = neutral
                              ruby     = evil
                              topaz    = chaotic
                              sapphire = lawful.
   Thus, the emerald and sapphire set in an alignment dagger will glow if it is
pointed at a lawful good character.
   The target to be identified must be visible to the holder of the dagger.
The weapon's aim is not especially accurate; if is pointed in the general
direction of more than one creature or object of different alignments, the gems
will glow alternately in rapid succession, making their message difficult to
interpret.  The alignment dagger is a normal weapon in all other respects,
giving the holder no combat bonuses.
@endnode

@node SW_113 "Dagger of Happiness"
<ben@ocvaxc>
   Similar to a Dagger of Venom, it is +1 and its hilt holds 6 doses of a
sedative/happy drug.  When striking an opponent, there is a 10% chance of the
dagger injecting the drug into the opponents system.  The opponent then makes a
save vs.  poison.  If the creature attacked fails its save, one round later it
sits on the ground with a smile on its face (faces, what passes for a face).
This obviously doesn't affect things not affected by poison or that don't have
blood per se.  The effects last 1d4+1 turns.  If the creature attacked makes
its save, all further saves against this poison are at -2 per injection during
the above duration, because the drug is still in the being's system.  Since the
drug is slow acting, there is more of a chance that it will be injected over a
normal Dagger of Venom - which is 5% - on a natural 20.

@node SW_114 "DaggerTip"
<adp89@msu>
   This item appears to be the tip of a dagger which has been broken off a
complete weapon.  It has a hole crudely drilled in one end, so that it can be
worn on a necklace or braclet, like a charm.  When a command word is spoken,
the DaggerTip falls from whatever it is attached to, becoming a +2 Dagger.  An
additional command word will make the dagger invisible.  The grip is hollow:
the pommel unscrews to reveal a compartment containing thieve's tools.
Repeating the command word causes the dagger to shrink back to its original
form.  The small size and relatively harmless appearance of the Dagger Tip
makes it an easily concealed weapon!

@node SW_115 "Diamond Dagger"
   The diamond dagger is a dagger who's blade is made of magically reinforced
diamond.  The blade will cut any non-magical material (flesh of 'magical'
monsters is non-magical) easily.  It will act as a reduce any armor class to 9
if the armor worn, animal hide, etc., is non-magical, although any bonuses for
dexterity, etc., is still applicable.  The dagger still acts as a +3 dagger and
will do so against magical armor too.  It will also cut most any material,
stone like butter, metals like sand, and wood like flesh.  The damage done by
the dagger is as a short sword.  The dagger has no bonuses at all against
materials that are made or alloys of mithral or adamantite.  It can be used to
cut open chests, doors, carve stone, shape metal, etc.  The dagger is balanced
for throwing, and will always hit blade first and always (not mithral and
adamantite) sink in to the hilt, which is made of steel and adamantite.  This
dagger need never make saving throws, unless it is being hit with (not hitting)
a weapon or object of mithral or adamantite, whereupon it will shatter if
failed.

@node SW_116 "Elven Dagger"
   This weapon, created for elven warrior commanders, is fashioned of a
mithral, silver and steel alloy.  It possesses the ability to detect
giant-class creatures at a range of 200' outdoors, 100' indoors or underground
(for a list of giant-class creatures, see Unearthed Arcana page 22).  The blade
of this dagger glows a faint white-blue color when such a creature is at the
extreme range of its detection ability.  The glow intensifies as the
giant-class creature gets closer, until the blade is shining with the
equivalent of a light spell.
   This dagger is +3 to hit and to damage giant-class creatures only.  When
attacking other creatures, it is considered to be a +1 magical weapon, but it
strikes and wounds as a normal dagger.  If desired, the dagger can be commanded
to dim its light or to withhold its radiance when stealth and concealment are
important.  The blade glows only when giant-class creatures are near, not by
any command.  Any giant-class creature that holds or touches the weapon
receives 1-4HP damage per round of contact.

<Robert Johan Enters:  whisper@wpi.WPI.EDU>
   This small dagger has been powered with an extremely potent dweomer.  It has
no plusses or any other bonusses when used in regular combat.  However, when
the true name of any creature seen by the wielder at some time in his or her
life is spoken aloud, and the dagger thrown, the dagger will automatically
strike that creature, wherever that creature may be.  Thus if necessary, the
dagger will sail through the planes to seek and hit the creature.  Upon hitting
under such circumstances, the effect of a harm spell will automatically affect
the target, and then damage for the dagger will have to be calculated.  Note
that this does not necessarily kill the victim.  First roll d4 for hitpoints
left, then d4 for hitpoints lost due to the dagger.  There is only one of these
daggers known to be around, and this was the item that finally brought low the
infamous Piraz the Mad.  The hand that threw the blade is thought to have been
that of Saicha La Vallee, Azith Dengg's wife.  Her powers and actions

@node SW_126 "Shieldbreaker  Symbol: warhammer"
   (The Sword of Force)
   The most powerful of the twelve.  As Vulcan's prized weapon, he invested a
great deal of his essence into the blade.  The Sword prevents any harm to come
to the wielder from any type of weapon or spell (direct or indirect/physical or
mental).  As long as someone is engaging the wielder in combat he cannot
release the Sword (he does not have to draw it, and may release it after all
opponents disengage).  The only thing that the Sword will not effect is
unharmed opponents:  if anyone or thing that attacks without weapons (or
spells) the Sword will pass, harmlessly, through them as if they were made of
air.  The other disadvantage is that the Sword increases it's strength by
drawing from the wielder, for every five rounds of combat it reduces the
wielder's Strength by one (ie 2 points of STR per turn).  The wielder is not
affected by this loss until all combat is done and the magic of the Sword no
longer supports him.  If the wielder is below one point of Strength, he will be
comatose until he reaches 1 point; regaining one point a day.  After this he
will regain 3 points per day for total rest, or 1 point a day for resting and
travelling (riding ONLY).

COMBAT EFFECTS:
   Dispels all spells used against wielder.
   For every person who attacks the wielder with a weapon or spell (in melee
range) the sword will:  d100:
	 1 - 20%  Destroys their weapon.

	41 - 45%  Cuts off both hands/arms
	46 - 50%  Cuts off one leg

	96 -100%  Kills                    double damage
   The disadvantage of Townsaver is that it does not protect the wielder as does

for dexterity and suffers a -2 to his AC.

WIS + CON) > 55. If the wielder can control the sword it does not use the table
above, nor does it give an attack for each attacking opponent.

@node SW_134 "Wayfinder  Symbol: arrow (pointer)"
   (Sword of Wisdom)
   Wayfinder can be used to make decisions. Such as "Where can I find a wizard to
help me on this adventure?" you point the Sword around until you feel a tingle,
and then go that way. Wayfinder always makes the "correct" choice, but not always
the path of least risk.

@node SW_135 "Farslayer  Symbol: concentric circles (bullseye)"
   (Sword of Vengeance)
   The wielder grasps this Sword by its hilt spins in a circle and says, "For thy
heart, for thy hear, who hast wronged me!" Release it, and it flies for a couple
of feet then disappears. It reappears by the named enemy and pierces his/its
heart, killing it. There is no save. No armor or magic can stop Farslayer, only
Shieldbreaker can stop this Sword (Farslayer would be destroyed). The sword lays
in the enemie's heart, until someone finds him and draws it out.

@node SW_136 "Coinspinner  Symbol: pair of dice"
   (Sword of Chance)
   Coinspinner can be used similar to Wayfinder, although it finds the best
chance of what the wielder seeks. The oddest thing about the Sword of Chance is
that it is the only sword that can move itself. If not watched it may disappear.
No vault, or magic can keep it in one place.
	+4 Luck (all saves at +4)
	+6 Luck in all games of chance

@node SW_137 "Dragonslicer  Symbol: winged serpent"
   (Sword of Heroes)
   Dragonslicer will kill any dragon whose flesh it bites. When used against
dragons it has no "to hit" bonus, but if the Sword hits the dragon dies (no
save). Removing the Sword from the dragon's body requires a bend bars/lift gates
roll.
