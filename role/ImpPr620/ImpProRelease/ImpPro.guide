   -- Run the supplied installation script.  You'll need a copy of CBM's
      Installer in your C directory.  This Install program can be found
      on many of your commercial program disks or on the AmigaDOS 2.1+
      Install disk.

   -- Make sure you have AmigaGuide or Multiview installed in your 
      Utilities drawer, along with any datatypes and or libraries it
      needs.  Multiview comes with WB3.0+, and the AmigaGuide
      distribution can be found on the Aminet.

   -- Several additional reference AmigaGuide files are available:

          Prices.guide  --- List of prices in a mideval city
          Swords.guide  --- A collection of magical swords
          Poisons.guide --- A collection of poison descriptions
          Spells.guide  --- A collection of mage and priest spells

      Mail me if you wish to obtain these reference items.

   -- Also be sure that AREXX is running before ImpPro is started, or you
      will lose scripting abilities.

   -- To start ImpPro, just double-click on it's icon.  ImpPro will then
      ask you for the screen mode to use.  After this selection, ImpPro
      will set-up and display it's custom screen and you're ready to go.
      Be aware that @{"modules" link "Modules" 0} in the @{"modules†directory" link "Modules_dir" 0} can be started

@node "Imp_exe" "Imp Professional Desktop and Module launcher"
To start the Imp Professional desktop and @{"module" link "Modules" 0} launcher, simply run it
through the CLI or double-click on it's icon.

Upon startup for the first time, the launcher will ask for the screen mode
you wish to use. Simply double click on the screen mode you wish to use and
the desktop will open.  You may also select the number of colors for the
desktop, up to 256 colors for AGA Amigas or 16 colors for OCS/ECS Amigas.
If you wish for the desktop to be larger than the screen, specify
"Autoscroll" and set the dimensions of the screen larger than the screen
mode you are using.  ImpPro will insist that your screen is at least
640x400.  After the screenmode is selected, ImpPro will prompt you for the
default font to use.  Do not select a font that is too large or ImpPro may
fail to open.

ImpPro will then read in the @{"Default.dock" link "Default_dock" 0} file in the Data directory.  For
your convienience, a sample dock has been provided for you containing
buttons for every module and table currently available.

If "ImpPro:Scripts/Startup.launcher" is present, it will be executed.

Finally, @{"Default.state" link "Default_state" 0} is read in containing the shared module information
from your last session of ImpPro.  This allows things like Running Party XP
and Game Time to be preserved.

To configure ImpPro, press the @{"Preferences" link "Preferences" 0} dock button.

Free memory and copyright information can be found in the "About" dock
item, along with a nifty picture of an Imp!

To leave ImpPro at any time, select "Quit" from the dock.  You will be
asked for confirmation.  If there are still windows on the screen after the
shutdown script is run, Imp Professional will inform you and request that
you close them before exiting.  The Default.state file will be saved to
disk to retain any shared variables within the launcher for your next
session.

@endnode

@node "Tables_dir" "Tables directory"
This directory contains any tables that may have been provided with ImpPro.
Because of copyright laws, verbatim copies of the AD&D tables cannot be
provided. The tables are usually in AmigaGuide format, although they may
also be simple text files. If you find yourself using a table from the DM's
guide quite often, take the time to type it in and put it in this
directory. Then edit @{"Preferences" link "Preferences" 0} in the launcher to add the table in the
launcher's dock using your favorite viewer or AmigaGuide to display it.
Note that this copy is for your own use and is not to be redistributed.

This directory may also include a Spells Guide and a Sword Guide.  If it
does not and you wish to obtain these huge databases for use with ImpPro,
please contact me at fors0037@gold.tc.umn.edu.

Also available is a Price Guide and a Poison Guide, also available from me
directly.
@endnode

@node "Dice_module" "Dice Module"
The dice module provides a user-definable button strip ( defined in
"Default.state" ) and a combination gadget which accepts standard die
string interpretation.

At startup, the dice module will look for the file
"ImpPro:Save/Default.strip", and read the user definable button strip from
there.

To roll a die in the button list, simply double-click on it and the result
will be displayed. The die will be copied into the "Combo" string gadget
for editing if you wish. You may repeat any die roll by clicking on the
"Roll" button.  A running total of all previous die rolls is also kept that
may be cleared at any time using the "Clear" button.

The "Combo" string gadget allows you to enter standard die strings. When
you hit return in this gadget, the die string is interpreted and then
rolled.  To repeat this roll, simply press the "Roll" button.

Some examples of die strings that may be entered into the "Combo" gadget:

   1d20
   1d20+1
   3d8-2
   1d100
   100     <-- @{i}Will always return 100@{ui}
   1d10*2
   400d10000

@{b}Beware of rolling things such as "10000d4" because the computer may bog for
quite some time while rolling all of those dice!@{ub}

If you wish to add a die string to your list of dice available in the list
view for double-clicking, simply type in the desired die string and hit the
"Add" gadget.  To remove a die string from the list, select it and hit the
"Rem" gadget.

The "Load die strip" and "Save die strip" selections in the menu load and
save the list of die strings.
@endnode

@node "Dungeon_module" "Dungeon Module"
The dungeon module will eventually be the central control module for
ImpPro, launching encounters, traps, and events.

Upon startup, you will be presented with two windows.

  @{"Dungeon†View" link "Dungeon_View" 0}
  @{"Toolbox" link "Dungeon_Toolbox" 0}
@endnode

@node "Dungeon_View" "Dungeon View"
This window allows you to scroll around your dungeon.  The scrollbars at
the right and bottom of the view are used for this purpose.

If you wish to change the size of the dungeon, select "Dungeon Map Size"
from the menu.

To paint the dungeon, simply press the left mouse button on a square and it
will be replaced with the currently active brush.  To select a different
brush, use the @{"Toolbox†window" link "Dungeon_Toolbox" 0}.

The right mouse button acts as an eraser, always painting with brush 0.

Holding down the left or right mouse button will draw or erase until you
release it.
@endnode

@node "Dungeon_Toolbox" "Dungeon Toolbox"
This window contains all of the commands for the Dungeon module.  A menu
strip is also attached to this window.

By either selecting "Load dungeon" from the menu or clicking on the "Load"
gadget, you can load in a dungeon.  Likewise, the "Save dungeon" and "Save"
gadget save a dungeon to disk.  Note that the default extension for
dungeons is ".dun" and the default directory is "ImpPro:Save".

The "Clear" gadget will clear the ENTIRE dungeon.  You will be asked for
confirmation.

The "About" menu item displays version information and compilation date.

"Hallway" will prompt you for a begin point and end point and will draw a
line between the two.

"Region" will prompt you for two corners of a box and will fill that region
with the current brush.

"Event" is not yet implemented.

To change the size of the dungeon, select "Dungeon map size" from the
Settings menu.  A small window will pop up allowing you to enter new X and
Y maximum values for the dungeon.  As much of the current dungeon as
possible will be copied into the new dungeon.  If you make the dungeon
smaller, you WILL lose the parts of your dungeon that exceed the new
maximum values.

This window also contains all of the brushes available to the Dungeon
module. To change the active brush, simply click the left mouse button on
the brush you wish to use.  To paint with this brush, use the @{"Dungeon†view" link "Dungeon_View" 0}.
A description of the current brush can be seen in the information box below
the brush bank.

press the "Do" button to the right.  To import the current running XP total
from the @{"encounter†module" link "Encounter_module" 0}, click "Import" and the XP will be added to the
value already in the "XP to add" gadget.  Be sure to click "Do" to carry
out the action.  If more than one character is selected, the XP will be
divided up equally between them.  To select more than one character, hold
down the left mouse button and drag select them.

To give an "XP Gift" to a character (for doing something clever for
example), simply double-click on a single character and the value will be
added to their XP total.  The size of a XP gift is determined by the "XP
Gift Amount" gadget.

Loading and saving entire character lists and individual characters is
available via the menus
@endnode

@node "Encounter_module" "Encounter Module"
The Encounter module keeps track of vital information and hit points for a
group of monsters.  The file @{"ImpPro:Data/Monsters.data" link "Monsters_data" 0} is loaded to provide
a list of monsters from which to pick.

To add a monster to the list, click on "Add" below the list view.  A window
will pop up containing the monster database.  To generate a single monster,
simply double-click on the monster to generate.  To generate more than one
monster of a type, highlight it in the list view, enter the number to
generate in the gadget below the list view, and then click "Generate". Each
monster's hit points will be rolled and vital statistics copied from the
database.

To remove a monster from the list, hightlight the monster and click
"Remove". Note that this does not add XP to the running XP total.  To clear
the monster list, click "Clear". You will be asked for confirmation.

You may edit all of each monster's statistics by highlighting the monster
in the list view and editing any of the fields to the right.  A comment
field is available, allowing you to add any other information you may need
on this monster (such as weapon, a description, etc.).  If you change the
monster's hit dice or hit RETURN in the Hit Die field, the monster's hit
points will be re-rolled based on the new information.  The monster's XP
value will also be re-calculated to reflect the change in hit points.

To damage a monster, enter either a number or a die string (1d4, 2d10,
6d6+1, etc.) into the "Damage" gadget and click "Do".  If the monster's hit
points reach 0, the monster will be either removed from the list or marked
as "DEAD" and it's XP value added to the running XP total.  A monster's hit
points may also be directly changed via the "Current HP" gadget.  Note that
the monster's XP will not be re-calculated based on the new hit points when
this is done.

To damage more than one monster, simply drag select a group of monsters or
hold down SHIFT while selecting individual monsters.  When you click "Do"
to cause damage, separate damage will be rolled for each monster.

To change the behavior of the module with respect to dead monsters, use the
"Remove Dead?" menu item.  If this menu item is checked, dead monsters will
be removed from the list, otherwise they will be simply marked as "DEAD"
and you must remove them manually.

The running XP total for an encounter is displayed in the "Encounter XP"
gadget. This value may be imported into the @{"Character†Module" link "Character_module" 0} to be divied
up among the characters. To reset the running XP total, click "Clear" to
the right of the gadget.

Loading and saving of encounters as well as version information is
available via the menu.

@node "Clock_module" "Clock Module"
The clock module acts as a time keeper for ImpPro.  It updates the game
time used by @{"modules" link "Modules" 0} such as the @{"Game†Log" link "GameLog_Module" 0}.  Upon startup, it reads the
current game time saved in @{"Default.state" link "Default_state" 0}.

The current game time is shown in six number gadgets corresponding to Days,
Hours, Turns, Rounds, Segments, and Seconds.  Beside each of these gadgets
are an up and down arrow that can be used to raise or lower each value.

The "Alarms" gadget brings up the @{"Alarm†window" link "Clock_alarms" 0}.

The "Reset" gadget will reset game time to Day 0, 00:00.00 and clear all
@{"alarms" link "Clock_alarms" 0}.

To add an alarm, click "Add" below the list view.  A new alarm will be
created with no name and set to go off immediately.  The alarm's name may
be changed via the text gadget below the alarm list.  To change the time
that the alarm will go off, use either the number gadgets or the sliders to
the right to set the desired alarm time.  To remove an alarm before it
rings, simply select it from the list and click on "Remove".

There are three types of alarms currently:  Absolute, Relative and
Periodic.  An absolute alarm will go off at the exact time specified by the
sliders. A relative alarm will go off at the current time PLUS the time
indicated by the sliders.  Think of an absolute alarm as exact time and a
relative alarm as "time from now".  The alarm types are interchangable via
the cycle gadget above the sliders.

A periodic alarm is much the same as a relative alarm except that it will
continually repeat until removed manually.  A periodic alarm must have an
interval of at least 1 segment.

After you are finished setting alarms, click on the close gadget to return

editing the "Name" gadget.  The command that a particular dock button will
run can be either typed in the "Cmd" gadget or picked via the "Pick"
button.  The number of columns in a dock may also be changed via the number
gadget.  A high column value may cause ImpPro to spit out an error message
and exit.  After you are done editing the dock, be sure to save it via the
"Save Dock" button.

A dock button may be moved up or down in the list by selecting it and
moving it with the Up Arrow and Down Arrow gadgets.

You may also alphabetically sort the button list by clicking on the "Sort"
button.

You may load in an alternate dock at any time via the "Load dock" item.  In
the future, alternate docks will be available via a keypress, but not yet!
:)

To leave the preferences section, simply click on the close gadget.  The
dock will be updated at this time.
