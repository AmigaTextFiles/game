conditions:

- You may not remove any copyright notices from the software or any
accompanying files.

- You may not resell this software for profit, except that you may

with TADS 3 and which you sell for profit.  (In other words, we don't
want you to make a profit at our expense by selling TADS itself, but
we want TADS game developers to be able to share or sell their games,
which necessarily include the TADS run-time, in any way they please.)

- Any copies you share with others must be complete and unmodified
from the original copies you received, and you must include this
license and the copyright notice with all copies.

- Anyone to whom you give a copy of this software receives all of the
same permissions that you did under this License.

Any games you create with TADS 3 are entirely your own to do with as
you please.

LIBRARY LICENSE
---------------

The TADS 3 distribution includes the standard adventure library, a
set of TADS source code (files whose names end in ".t", plus header
files, whose names end in ".h", that the .t files include) defining
the world model, parser, and so on.  You may use and redistribute the
library source code, and you may modify the library code and create
derived works based on the library, subject to the condition that you
include the original copyright notice on each original or modified
file that you redistribute in source form.  You may add your own
copyright notice as well to cover the changes you make.

If you create a new work based on the library, or you so extensively
modify the library that you create a predominately new work, you must
still include the original copyright notice, but you may make the
original copyright notice secondary to your own and you may modify
the original notice to indicate that your work is "based on the TADS
3 library."  For example, you might change the copyright notice to
read:

   My Extended Library, copyright 2003 by John Q. Author
   Based on the TADS 3 Library, copyright 1997, 2003 by Michael J. Roberts.

If you use the library (or a modified version of the library) to
create a game, and you distribute your game only in compiled form (as
a ".t3" file), you are NOT required to mention the library copyright
anywhere, but you are certainly welcome to mention us in your game's
credits if you'd like.
