TADS 3.0.18 for the Amiga
-------------------------

This is Mike Roberts' TADS 3, ported to the Amiga by David Kinder. Included
is the game player ("TADS3 Run-time") and the compiler ("t3make").

In order to run TADS 3, Kickstart 2.04 (or better) is needed, as is a lot of
memory: in order to play anything more than the smallest games at least 8Mb
of free memory is needed. The run-time and compiler also need more than the
default stack: a stack size of at least 20K is recommended for the player,
and at least 50K for the compiler.

TADS 3 games can be found on the Internet: see

TADS3 Run-time
--------------

To run a TADS game, double click on the "TADS3 Run-time" icon, then select
the game file (usually ending in ".t3") with the file requester. The icon
can have the following tootypes:

DIR	     This indicates which directory TADS should open the file
	     requester in, e.g.

		 DIR=Adventures:TADS/

SCREENMODE   This indicates the screen mode to be used. The mode
	     should be spelled exactly as it appears in the ScreenMode
	     Workbench preferences program, e.g.

		 SCREENMODE=PAL:High Res Laced

FONT	     This indicates the font name and size to be used, e.g.

		 FONT=Courier/13

WINDOW       If present, the player uses a window on the Workbench
	     screen rather than opening a custom screen.  

The player can also be used from the Shell by giving the game file path as
the first argument, e.g.

	"TADS3 Run-time" Elysium.t3

Calling the player without any arguments will give a list of all possible
arguments and their function.

The player has command line editing (cursor left/right, delete and back-
space), a command line history (cursor up/down to go through the previously
entered commands) and a review mode (accessible by pressing F1) in which
text that has scrolled off the display can be recalled.

If the player is run with a "-plain" argument, it only uses standard input
and output, for use in a Shell window or over a network.
