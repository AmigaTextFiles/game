   Introduction:
   -------------
   -=Dungeon=- is a game that can be played each day as an ongoing epic
   adventure.  Since there are 10 levels in each segment of the game,
   and 100 levels total (future), you can rest assured that you will be
   spending more than just a half hour, or even a day playing your Dungeon
   adventures.

   Dungeon is meant to be played like a D&D game.  You begin by choosing
   a character name and race.  The rest is calculated for you,
   including your armor class, hit points, and other character stats
   which you do not see listed.  Each character class has its' own set
   of attributes, and depending on your style of play you will choose
   the one that suits you best. 

   Also remember that you will only have 800 turns per day (the SYSOP
   can change this if he/she so desires).  This is to insure that
   those of you who really like to play this game don't stay online
   for an entire day, thus keeping other people from using the BBS!
   350 turns is usually enough to get through AT LEAST 1
   Dungeon level. 

   The Dungeon:
   ------------
   During the game, you will encounter various creatures and items. 
   You begin the game with a short sword and no armor.  As you progress
   in your adventure, you will find different types of weapons and
   armor (if you're VERY lucky); these items will improve your armor
   class (usually by 1).  The lower your armor class, the better your
   position.

   If you are unlucky enough to meet up with a dragon (usually on level
   10), you can use whatever scrolls you still have left to help you
   to defeat this evil creature.

   Traps are common in some parts of the Dungeon, but thankfully not
   all of them are deadly; they will usually only damage you (you lose
   hit points).  Some of the traps WILL kill you however, and if they
   do you'll have to start a new character entirely.  Map these out as
   you play the game a few times - that way you'll know where they are
   the next time through.

   DIFFICULTY LEVEL!
   -----------------

   At the beginning of the game, you can choose the game mode.  If you
   choose EASY, all spaces which are not used in the Dungeon will be
   mapped out BEFORE you begin each level.  This is a "cheaters" mode.

   Movement:
   ---------
   All of the rooms and passageways of the Dungeon are mapped out; you
   can only go in certain directions, and these directions will be
   evident by looking at the square you are on.

   Use the NUMBER KEYPAD for your movement.



				Direction	 |- = Right/Up/Down
				Symbols:	-|  = Left/Up/Down
             North	     			-+- = All directions
               8                                -^- = Left/Right/Up
               |                                -.- = Left/Right/Down
     West 4 ---|--- 6 East                       o- = Right only
               |                                -o  = Left only
               2                                -.  = Left/Down
             South                              -'  = Left/Up 
                                                 `- = Right/Up
                                                 ,- = Right/Up
                                   		 '  = Up only
                             		         ,  = Down only

   SEARCH MODE
   -----------

   Of course when you come across a SECRET door, it will NOT show up
   on your screen, and it is often wise to turn your SEARCH mode ON
   when going through a room.  This will take considerably more time
   each move, but it can be worth the effort.  In fact, without
   the search mode, you will not find ANY treasure, or even the key
   to the exit!  Beware though - when using SEARCH, you take more
   turns, and thus have less time to play.

   Winning the Game:
   -----------------
   Each set of 10 Dungeons ends with a battle with a dragon.  You may
   choose the set of Dungeons you wish to play when you first create
   your character.  Each set has its' own unique appeal.

   If you wish to try to make the all-time HIGH SCORE listing, you MUST
   select ALL levels by hitting the RETURN key when asked which SET you
   wish to play.  Otherwise, your game will be considered a practice
   game, and your score will not be saved.
