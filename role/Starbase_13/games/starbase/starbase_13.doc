                        ------------------------------

This game may be freely copied, but all files must remain intact including 
the documentation. If the game is sold, the price must not
exceed that of the disks and postage cost. Both disks must be distributed
together.

Starbase 13 is a graphic adventure, similar in style to Monkey Island or
Operation Stealth. The controls and what they do are fairly obvious, but since
there is 3K left on this disk I may as well use it by explaining it all
anyway.

Starting the program
--------------------

To run the program, reboot with Starbase_13 in df0: and click on the icon.
Once the program is running, it will play some music, and show the 
introductory animation. The adventure will then begin.
To skip the introductory animation, hold down any mouse button.

The Control Panel
-----------------

You may notice at the bottom of the screen a few buttons and a black area.
This is fairly important to the running of the game, and works as follows:

On pressing a button, the appropriate light appears. Basically, the buttons
change the way you interact with the background when you click the left mouse
button. The way each button works is explained below

walk: When this is selected, the character walks to the spot you selected 
with the mouse.

examine: If you click on an object, a short descriptive passage appears in 
the text window. You can also click on items in the inventory, which are 
shown in the text window when you move the mouse pointer over it. Otherwise 
it acts as if walk was selected.

operate: Similar to examine, but will attempt to `operate` the selected item.

use: Two items must be selected, the first of which must be from the 
inventory, the second can be either in the inventory or in the background.

talk: Use this to talk to somebody or something 

take: Pick up an object 

shoot: Blast something into atoms! Note that this is the only option which 
does not allow you to walk if you did not click on an object.
Hint: you will need to be very quick on the draw.

Unlike most adventures, there is no need to click on the verb for every action
you perform. Once it is selected, you can use it as many times as you like.

Saving/Loading games
--------------------

There are five save game positions, corresponding to the two rows of function
keys. F1-F5 load from the respective position, and F6-F10 save. 

Quitting
--------

If it`s getting too much for you, Ctrl+C exits to workbench.
