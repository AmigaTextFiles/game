       DISTRIBUTION
       
       This game is Public Domain;  it  can  be freely distributed,
       providing that:
       
          - none of the files included is modified in any way;
          - no charge is made that exceeds the average cost for
            duplication and postage.
       

       SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
       
       To play this game you need an Amiga  with at least 1M of RAM
       with OS 1.3 or higher and a PAL  display; 1.2 should also be
       OK, but I couldn't test it. Sorry!

       
       QUICK START
       
       Before playing, you need to  copy  some fonts in your FONTS:
       directory; let's say that you have extracted the archive to
       a floppy named 'Buzz'; open a shell window and type:

            Copy Buzz:Cyberdrone/fonts to Fonts: all

       If you don't have  enough  space  on  your  boot-disk or you
       don't want a permanent modification you can type:

            Assign Fonts: to Buzz:Cyberdrone/fonts add

       The Assign command must be in your C: logical device.
       Now the  game can be started  by  double-clicking  its icon.
       Two 'Assign' will be made by the program itself:

            CybData:    if not already present, is assigned to
                        [Cyberdrone_dir]:data
            CybSave:    if not already present, is assigned to
                        [Cyberdrone_dir]:saved_games


       HD INSTALLATION

       If you want to run the  game  from  your  Hard Disk,  simply
       drag the Cyberedrone icon  into  the  selected partition and
       directory, and copy the fonts to your Fonts: directory

          Copy Buzz:Cyberdrone/fonts to Fonts: all


       HOW TO PLAY


       Cyberdrone is a RPG game with  a  sci-fi background; in this
       game you play the role of a cadaver.
       Well, to be more precise, of a clinically dead subject whose
       body has been sold to a corporation  specialized in building
       cyborgs. The good  news  is  that  your  brain  has not been
       damaged and still retains all  your  memory; the bad news is
       that nobody cares for this and what is left of you is thrown
       into the productive process as raw material.
       Fortunatly, a failure of the machinery avoids you the latest
       phase of the process, and  this  is the point where the game
       begins.
       Your task is simple: find the exit and flee.
       To do such a simple  thing,  though,  you  must  explore the
       complex,  collect  the   magnetic  keys  needed  to  explore
       further, find the controller  cards  for  all the cybernetic
       devices that are now an integral  part of your body, keep up
       the energy level and feed your organic subsystem.
       The only way out is blocked by a security door, whose sensor
       will not let pass any synthetical being, so your only chance
       is to disable the sensor by  activating  the self destroying
       sequence; to sort out how is one of yours problems.
       Many others problems are scattered  around the complex; some
       of them walk, others just wait for you to step on them.
       To make the task a bit easyer  I  have enclosed a brief list
       of hints: feel free to ignore them if you are an experienced
       RPG player, but at your own peril.


       CONTROLS

       The game  is  entirely  mouse-driven;  if  you  have already
       played with games like Dunge*n  Mast*r or Capt*ve you should
       have no problems; if  not,  study  carefully the information
       screens that are  available  at  the  startup by clicking on
       'Information' (what else?? ;-)
       You  can  also  walk-slide-turn  using  the  arrows  and the
       Del-Help keys.
       Other keys combinations  are  available,  bur  they  are for
       cheating only; I'm sure that you  are so smart a player that
       you don't need to use them...


       HINTS

       First of all, find the  disk  that  contains the dictionary;
       without it, you are not able to understand what you read.

       Try to avoid zones with  strong  energy  fields; they have a
       strange effect on magnetic stuff...

       Map carefully every level.  The  complex is build up by four
       linked towers with three levels  each; for every level there
       is a specific hardware  key  that,  connected  to  the right
       terminal,     allows you to download  the level map, but you
       cannot benefit  of this  until  you  find the 5th controller
       card, so you have only pen and paper to begin with;

       Some devices consume more energy  than others; use them only
       when it is unavoidable;

       You don't need to  kill  every  enemy;  if  you have a light
       armour or the 'wrong' weapon,  running  away could be a good
       idea;

       Think twice before getting  rid  of  an item that has become
       unusable; sometime the damage can be fixed;

       Before entering a hole,  check  the  map of the level below:
       you could fall into the garbage cruncher instead of reaching
       a safe location;

       When you find a weapon that  you  already have, try to think
       to an alternative use for it...

       Finally, save the game often; you  never know what you could
       find behind the next corner - or what could find you -.


       A FINAL WORD ABOUT DISTRIBUTION

       This game is Giftware;  this  means  that  If  you decide to
       keep it, you should send a  little  donation  to the author,
       that could decide to  write   a  sequel  or  even to put the
       game-editor in the Public Domain...
