Annoucing with reasonable vociferousness: Zerg 1.0!

If you disliked the 0.5 demo/BETA version of Zerg, chances are that you'll
hate this version. It passes as nominally well-featured amongst those who value
their online time so little that they actually download it. For those
of you fortunate enough not to have been acquainted with the aforementioned
demo, Zerg is a cheesy Ultima clone with a nominal plot. You can waltz
your character about a simple but deadly fantasy world, slaughter monsters,
talk with the inhabitants of fully populated towns, embark on royal quests,
purchase a plethora of murder devices with which you can remove this from
this of about 12 different monster types, cast a spell, and otherwise
occupy yourself while your computer is engaged in more important business
(it DOES multitask well). New features include...

	- Improved character development
	- Fully populated towns with vaguely interactive characters
	- New monsters, weapons, magic, etc.
	- 3-D ray traced graphic landscape (*)
	- Pulse-pounding 4-voice digitized soundtrack (*)
	- Real time HAM animation (*)	

	Download Zerg today! I dare you to try and have fun...


(*) Forthcoming
