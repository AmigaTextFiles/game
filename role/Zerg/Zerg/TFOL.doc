     The Zerg Tourists Guild extends the most fervent welcome to any soul who
would journey in our humble world, and in a tax-deductible fit of altruism,
we have published this guide for your exploratory pleasure. Heed its words
well, oh noble adventurer, lest your carcass rot in the gullets of the less
culinarily discriminating denizens of our fair land.
	
	Read on, adventurer!  And learn...



                          PART ONE: THE WORLD OF ZERG
	
	Zerg is a fantastic and magical world, spanning endless leagues full
of idyllic wilderness, the surface of which Mankind has truly only scratched,
owing both to Zerg's inherent dangers, and Man's inherent incompetence.  Indeed,
as the elvish Tralbinorian philosopher Meraedin sagaciously observed in the days
of yore, "Methinks it a rare and oft amusing circumstance when a Human doth
succeed in distinguishing 'twixt his face and his posterior."  Yet despite 
petty squabbles, political wars that have decimated entire towns, disease,
starvation, hostile magic, and roving bands of monsters that plague the
various lands, Mankind still manages to build towns, establish armies, form
factional governments, and generally attempt to civilize things. 

	There are many different kingdoms spread around the continents of Zerg,
each with its own cities, towns, dungeons, characteristics, and population.
Each shall be dealt with individually anon.  No one emperor has managed
to establish himself as Overlord of all the various nations since the days
of Kvileek the Auspicious of Sparadan, although many have tried.  The state
of affairs between kingdoms varies from cordial goodwill to cordial war,
and many adventurers owe their fame to the peculiarities of Customs at the
frontier of certain kingdoms alone.

					
                         PART TWO: THE GEOGRAPHY OF ZERG

	An uprising adventurer should verily familiarize his, her, or itself
     with the various types of terrain in our pleasant world. 


     Water - The oceans are just full of this stuff, and the torrential
             waves of the Three Seas have seen the demise of many well-
             stocked merchant vessels.  No man has crossed any large body
             of water unaided, which is damned obvious, methinks.

     Grass - The knotty green carpet that blankets many of the kingdoms is
             easy travel, and serves as grazing material for one's mount,
             as well as other offices, which has seen the ruination of many
             a pair of adventurer's boots.
	
     Light Brush - Denser than grass, but only a moderate impediment to
                   open travel, the thick under and overgrowth of Zerg
                   houses a variety of specimens of wildlife, most of which
                   are too small to be of notice.

     Forest - Many adventurers have lost their way amongst these tall, shady
              oaks, which is a good indication of the intelligence of the
              average adventurer, for the trees that comprise the wild
              forests of Zerg tend to be scanty and sparse, save in certain
              regions well-suited for the growth of flora.

     Mountains - Impassable for all but the most rugged of Trolls, who make
                 their homes in these airy peaks, the Mountains of Zerg
                 make convenient natural boundaries for many kingdoms.

     Lakes - Home to many inland freshwater fish, the lakes of Zerg are
             serene and undisturbed by the tides.  Some lakes, such as
             Lake Forinthia, located in southeastern Durollinae, are 
             notorious tourist traps.

                              
                         PART THREE: THE INHABITANTS OF ZERG

     While the type and size of a given populace will vary from kingdom to
kingdom, the stock of intelligent life on Zerg has been systematically
analyzed and categorized.  Note that the humans and humanoid races tend to
classify living things as either People or Monsters, whilst the monsters
themselves classify beings as either Other Monsters or Food.
     Using the classification system developed in 8122 by the biologist
Tailailio of Tralbinor, we shall briefly look at each type of known race.

     HUMANOID RACES:
          Humanoid races all share the same general appearance  -
          two arms, two legs, upright stature, prehensile thumb, and other
          traits - although they come from radically divergent evolutionary
          origins.  That the grouping is called "humanoid" is an irony, when
          one considers that the humanity is the youngest of these races.
          The name in all likelihood owes to the fact that the author of the
          Tailailioan system was a human.


              Humans - The first recorded human sighting occurred in the
                       year 7201, according to elvish textbooks, and since
                       then this relatively young enterprising race has
                       managed to pervade all but the most hostile areas
                       of Zerg. Humans are strong, arguably intelligent,
                       and largely considered to smell unpleasant. It is
                       virtually impossible to travel in Zerg without
                       encountering humans or their settlements, and most
                       intelligent creatures know human as a second 
                       language.

               Elves - Last of the ancient Elder Races, the elvish people
                       differ from their human counterparts in being on the
                       whole much slighter of build, more intelligent, and
                       in possession of a sense of tact.  Sometimes reaching
                       a thousand years of age, the typical elf's natural
                       agility and magical aptitude lend themselves to making
                       him an excellent spellcaster, and few mages' guilds
                       discriminate against elves in their admissions
                       procedures.

             Dwarves - Thought until the advent of Parsollian Biology to be
                       a diminutive mutation of the Gosakk'l Elder Race
                       (long since disappeared), the dwarves tend to be
                       short of height and temperament, and prone to fits of
                       fervid dourness. Few dwarves engage on adventures, or
                       other pursuits outside their small hilly communities.
                         
           Halflings - Called hobbits until the Great Tolkien Lawsuit of 8244,
                       these stout, diminutive (3 feet tall on the average -
                       slightly smaller than the average dwarf) and often
                       mischievous folk are contemporarily known as "the
                       little people", "brownies", or, more accurately,
                       "gluttonous little rats".  They are often mistaken
                       for gnomes, a fact the latter resents keenly. Most
                       halflings live peaceful, rustic lives, and the more
                       industrious ones will serve on human manors as 
                       farm managers.


          INHUMANOID RACES:
               The term "inhumanoid" is a loose classification that 
               pretty much encompasses all known intelligent, non-humanoid
               (note that most inhumanoids hold that the two preceding
               adjectives are mutually inclusive) non-magical, four-limbed
               races that populate the kingdoms of Zerg. Many are generally
               hostile to humans and their ilk, and are generally not
               considered good people to hire as babysitters.


               Kobolds - Cunning, intelligent, ferocious, and adept at most
                         forms of hand-to-hand warfare these creatures are
                         not at all. In fact, were it not for their natural
                         speed and general propensity not to attack creatures
                         who aren't tied up and asleep, it is dubious that
                         the world would know the mischief of a single kobold
                         today. Kobolds are pack-oriented, and usually attack
                         as ambush squads, pelting unwary travellers with 
                         stones and verbal abuse from above before dropping
                         in for the cul-de-sac. Physically, they resemble
                         extremely short and thin scaled elves or humans, with
                         prehensile tails and vaguely canine faces.  They
                         carry little gold or treasure, not being intellect-
                         ually advanced enough to have a grasping of the concept
                         of economics, and often wonder what the big fuss is
                         about.

                  Orcs - It is a tribute to the minds of the orcish race that
                         they have relentlessly avoided extinction despite
                         being the butt of the violent aggressions of
                         adventurers in nearly every fantasy role-playing
                         game known, yet despite this orcs remain almost
                         distressingly stupid. Tall, strong, brutish
                         creatures with the strength of an ox and minds to
                         match, they are often employed by evil human
                         warlords as soldiers, due to their inability to
                         grasp the concept of death. (Indeed, the armies of
                         Forzin of Gondrick's Continental Crusade were
                         almost entirely composed of orcish regulars, and
                         were sadly obliterated by the superior Sparadan
                         forces.)

               Goblins - Although not terribly strong, or bright, goblins
                         have a high population, and therefore manage to
                         survive and propagate the kingdoms of Zerg in
                         spite of their physical inferiorities. Goblins
                         are short in stature (about as high as dwarves)
                         and survive primarily in nomadic tribes. They
                         are most common in plains or area of light forest.

            Hobgoblins - Somewhat bigger, meaner, and less pleasant to
                         talk to than conventional goblins, Hobgoblins will
                         often bully their lesser cousins, and are viewed
                         by the latter with slightly less warmth than are 
                         dead skunks (who at least are considered to have
                         some culinary value).

                 Ogres - The only challenges to the widely-held view that the
                         orc is the least intelligent of all species of Zerg,
                         ogres stand at least 10 feet tall, and are fierce foes
                         in battle. Iracundulous and belligerent, ogres will
                         attack humans on sight, along with anything else.
                         Being extremely ravenous by nature, an ogre will
                         generally attempt to eat anything that looks vaguely
                         organic, a definition which sadly includes trees.
                         A traveller visiting the forests of the Dierian   
                         province of Chork can often admire a variety of 
                         interesting art sculptures which are actually nothing
                         more than Toopa trees that have been more aesthetic-
                         ally mauled by hungry ogres.
                          
                Giants - Sluggish and dim-witted, giants are simply humanoids
                         who, through some strange hormonal imbalance, 
                         achieve heights averaging from anywhere from 30 to
                         200 feet tall. They are not a true race among them-
                         selves, and thankfully cannot reproduce, yet appear
                         frequently, and share common characteristics that
                         are presumably side-effects of their wretched 
                         state. They are of incredibly slow metabolish, and
                         typically awkward, and therefore easily evaded.
                         Still, when provoked, a more powerful giant can 
                         level a small village within seconds.  Many
                         survivors of the obliterated town Collindamaine
                         will attest to the might of giants.


     MONSTERS:
          The generic term "monster", (deriving from the Old Elvish word
          "monestaeri", which roughly means "he who inspires rapid flight")
          was applied to inhumanoids as well as members of certain 
          nationalities that bathed irregularly, but was restricted to signify
          those living creatures that did not classify as humanoid or
          nonhumanoid under the Tailailioan system.
          

                Trolls - These horrible creatures should be avoided at all
                         cost, and were it not for their scarcity and natural
                         reclusiveness, the entirety of Zerg would likely
                         serve as one big troll dinner plate. Described by
                         one famous sage as "thin and rubbery", trolls have 
                         a characteristic immunity to all but the nastiest
                         weapons, fire, and certain spells. They furthermore
                         possess the power of Regeneration, and can grow back
                         a severed limb within minutes, or shrug off a sword's
                         welt within seconds as it closes on its own accord.
                         Highly intelligent, they are often employed by lesser
                         demons as advisors, servants, or accountants.

             Gargoyles - Creatures of magic, extremely fierce and intelligent,
                         gargoyles are presumed to derive from a lesser 
                         stock of demons. When not engaged in their odious
                         practices, they sometimes assume a characteristic 
                         frozen stance that often leads unwary adventurers
                         into the false assumption that they are statues.
                         This is ostensibly just fine with gargoyles, who
                         enjoy a crunchy human from time to time to 
                         supplement their diet of tortured ethereal souls.

                Demons - Supernatural denizens of the netherworld, these
                         ghastly creatures hail from regions such as Hell,
                         Hades, Tartarus, and Chicago. Entire platoons have
                         been known to turn and scamper for home at the
                         terrible sight of an angry demon. They possess
                         magical abilities that have baffled the most learned
                         of sages, and are impervious to all but the mightiest
                         of forces. They are extremely rare on this plane of
                         existence, popping by only for brief, purposeful
                         missions of diabolical nature before fading into the
                         ether of their own universe.

               Dragons - It is a queer fact that the mightiest of creatures -
                         the dreaded dragons - are not of supernatural origin,
                         but are quite native to Zerg. Dragons are an ancient
                         and majestic race with a history dating back to the 
                         dawn of time (and thus are more closely related to
                         the elvish peoples than others), and indeed, those
                         few dragons that roam Zerg today are often centuries
                         old. The numerous tales of valiant warriors 
                         infiltrating the lairs of dragons, slaying their
                         occupants, and making off with their considerable
                         bounty, and perhaps a fair maiden or two, are little 
                         more than ravings of warped imaginations. Dragons are
                         simply not to be trifled with, period. Valiant
                         warriors? Valiant ARMIES often can't put a dent in the
                         armored hide of a dragon, and a dragon can decimate
                         large cities with a geyser of flame from its mouth
                         (as did the dragon Greymaxanan to the Jerian city
                         Tei Alinoe in 8230). The intellect of a dragon will
                         dwarf all others' save the greatest of demon lords,
                         who do not venture onto this plane, and thus they can
                         be considered the most intelligent creatures on
                         Zerg. Trying to trick a dragon is the next idiotic
                         thing to attacking one. Still, mighty wizards under
                         great magical protection occasionally beg a dragon
                         for its council on some pertinent matter, and a
                         dragon will often comply, when offered sufficient
                         treasure to compensate for the bother of speaking
                         to such insignificant creatures. (It is said that
                         dragons not only know the meaning to life, but are
                         bored by it.) Dragons are by nature utterly self-
                         interested, shrugging off concepts like good and 
                         evil as the pathetic propensities of insects. Dragons
                         have a fondness for treasure - gems in particular -
                         although it is generally not known why. Fortunately
                         for everybody else, dragons are extremely few in
                         number, and their locations are carefully kept 
                         track of by most kings, who insure that dragons
                         and their territories are given a wide berth.
                         
                         
                        
                         PART FOUR: THE KINGDOMS OF ZERG

     The kingdoms of Zerg are organized societies in which people may co-
habitate with somewhat less the amount of conflict, deceit, corruption,
and outright war than do those residing in different kingdoms. The forms of
government and histories of the kingdoms vary so widely that another section
of this Textfile is given to that discussion. As of this publication, over
thirty different kingdoms are known to exist.
     There are, however, certain institutions that are common even amongst
greatly differing cities, and a prospective adventurer would best familiarize
his or herself with them.


           Homes - Ranging from weather-beaten hovels to the most elegant
                   of mansions, public and private housing for the lower
                   classes is a feature of nearly every city (save some
                   in Sparadan, where lodgings are under the jurisdiction
                   of the military). Residents will sometimes welcome news
                   from the outside world, and an adventurer might even be
                   offered shelter for a night in exchange for some 
                   inter-kingdom gossip. 

    Taverns/Pubs - The number #1 form of recreation in most cities (for
                   adult males, in any event) seems to be the spending of
                   many an hour in these hostels of crapulence and inebriation.
                   'Twould seem that the corollary arts of imbibing much ale,
                   singing loudly, hurling epithets, and the gradual loss of
                   consciousness are of no slight popularity either. During
                   the less dipsomaniacal hours of the day, however, one may
                   obtain food and drink in such establishments, and often
                   some local gossip from a loquacious bartender as well.

    Weaponsmiths - Here one may purchase with one's hard-earned gold the tools
                   of the delicate art of Slaughtering Others. While the 
                   quality, price, and assortment of weapons will vary from
                   locale to locale, one can generally sell his used arms
                   of any type in such establishments (albeit for a lesser
                   price.)

        Armories - When in the midst of battle, many an adventurer will ask
                   of himself why so many arrows seem to be protruding from
                   his back, and why the orcish swords seem to be cleaving
                   apart his torso like butter. Had he purchased a suit of
                   protective armor from a local armory, chances are he 
                   would not be in such a plight. Do yourself a favor
                   and preserve your paltry existence with some form of
                   protection, purchasable in such places.
                   
         Healers - Ranging from professional magiphysicians who can raise
                   the dead with a thought to primitive witch doctors who
                   more often than not make the afflicted's condition more
                   severe, healers are nonetheless excellent finds for the
                   forlorn adventurer with one too many lacerations from
                   poisoned arrows in his abdominal region. In relieving you
                   of your injuries, healers are equally inclined to relieve
                   your purse of much of its weight, and paupers are scoffed
                   at vociferously by this parsimonious creed.

  General Stores - While most of the fare vended at such establishments are
                   mundane, domestic things, and useless to the average
                   adventurer, there are often many items of genuine value
                   as well. A well-stocked general store may have magical
                   items of minor power for sale as well.

           Banks - Excellent places of residence for the adventurer's excess
                   accumulations of cash, the major banks have outlets in
                   many cities, and often in different kingdoms as well.
                   Some of the wealthier banks offer hearty interest upon their
                   investments. Many will often lend money as well, but it
                   is good to keep in mind that usury has only been abolished
                   in the kingdom of Dieria.

          Guilds - Rumored to exist in dense cities, these infamous coalitions
                   of thieves and brigands reputedly exert more than a moderate
                   influence upon many local governments. Reputedly, much
                   information can be gathered at such establishments as well.
                   For a price...

            Inns - These comfortable hostels tend to afford one excellent
                   shelter from the various elements, and often sport a 
                   pub or tavern as well. Beds should be inspected for lice,
                   however.


                              PART FIVE: COMMON PROFESSIONS

     While the populace of the various kingdoms enjoy many different positions
and professions, there are again many which are axiomatically common to most
cities, and therefore, the Zergian traveller should well acquaint oneself with
them.

          Adventurers - Stalwart souls like yourself, sharing your love for
                        the unknown, disturbing inclination towards danger,
                        and tendency towards early death. Adventurers range from
                        trembling neophytes taking their first steps in a 
                        new kingdom to jaded trollsquashers bearing magical
                        treasures beyond imagination, and seething with useful
                        information. Adventurers in general tend to rarely
                        taste solvency, and a heavy purse will oftentimes
                        elicit heavy talk.

                        Fighters - Specializing in the fine art of Slaughter-
                                   ing Others, fighters are adventurers skilled
                                   with arms and armor. Like all adventurers,
                                   many have stepped down the dark path of
                                   Evil, and attack travellers for their
                                   treasure, or for their own pleasure.

                           Mages - Embittered by years of gruelling study at
                                   some thaumaturgical university, the mage
                                   who has decided to forego sensibility and
                                   become an adventurer is indeed putting his
                                   formidable skills in the Magical Arts to
                                   unorthodox use. Most mages typically settle
                                   down, establish laboratories, guilds, or
                                   medical establishments.
         
             Guards - Keepers of the peace and justice as interpreted by
                      the local monarch, or whoever fills their purses,
                      these warriors tend to be well-trained and taciturn.
                      The wealthier cities will hire guards of Sparadan
                      stock, who are incorruptible and possess a
                      discipline unrivaled by those of other kingdoms.

          Merchants - Ah, the heart of nearly every civilized state - the
                      bourgeoisie! Ranging from simple peddlers to world-famous
                      financial entrepreneurs, it is the financially active
                      middle class that serves as the lifeblood of the more
                      politically advanced kingdoms. 
          
           Peasants - The mainstream populace of many cities and towns is
                      comprised primarily of these hardworking souls, ranging
                      from the prosperous small farmers of rural Ontego to the
                      impoverished serfs of feudal Golforham. Typically
                      agriculturally-oriented, peasants will often supply a
                      friendly adventurer with valuable information not
                      gleanable from other sources.

            Thieves - Sometimes harmless village idiots, sometimes devious
                      tricksters who pickpocket the elderly and deranged,
                      sometimes warlike brigands who roam the countryside
                      in search of prey, thieves are viewed by most others
                      in the same sphere of preference as some of the more
                      deforming pestilences, and oftentimes city guards will
                      amuse themselves devising pretexts upon which they can
                      hunt down a lone thief and bathe him in his own blood.
                      (This auspicious event is less commonplace than one
                      would think, owing to the typical intelligence of guards,
                      and their resulting inability to formulate any such
                      schemes.)

             Nobles - Be they the powerful, landed aristocracy of Golforham,
                      or the powerless, incompetent slobs of the old
                      Dierian provinces, nobles of all kingdoms share a common
                      set of distinguishable personality traits: overwhelming
                      arrogance, sneering aloofness, nigh-obsessive materialism,
                      and a patronizing contempt for anyone of lesser birth.
                      In the more advanced kingdoms, these hereditary 
                      bluebloods have little or no influence upon governmental
                      affairs, but in almost all cases are descended from 
                      ancient lineages of dominating lords or semikings. Most
                      find condescension a fine substitute for the intelligence
                      that years of inbreeding has robbed the majority of this
                      ilk, and amuse themselves with their fantastic wealth.
                      Nobles are generally deemed, particularly in times of
                      war or famine, an expendable part of society, and often
                      serve as scapegoats during peasant uprisings. The richer
                      nobles maintain luxurious manors, often with private
                      armies (typically comprised of orcish mercenaries).

          Officials - Bureaucrats, diplomats, and other such governmental 
                      white-helmet workers all fall under this broad category.
                      The actual involvement of a given class of officials
                      depends entirely upon the form of government under which
                      they work. Officials tend to have little knowledge of
                      local matters, but are usually familiar with the current
                      state of inter-kingdom relations and may have some
                      political wisdom to impart upon the inquisitive 
                      adventurer.

          Minstrels - Also called bards, troubadours, or less flattering names,
                      the musically inclined may glean great enjoyment from
                      listening to the tunes of these wandering musicians,
                      and the politer adventurer may throw a few coins into
                      the hat of a minstrel who imparts such harmonic delight.
                      As they tend to remain in a city only as long as it takes
                      the city officials to write a warrant for their arrest, 
                      they move from kingdom to kingdom quite rapidly, and
                      accumulate much interesting knowledge in their journeys.

              Kings - Some of the monarchs of the kingdoms of Zerg are wise,
                      and some are not. Some are compassionate and dedicate
                      themselves to the welfare of their nations, while 
                      others think only to fill their pockets with everything
                      that will fit.  Kings in general tend to be materialistic,
                      self-righteous, gluttonous pigs, but there is a smattering
                      of intelligence amongst the bluebloods, and the wise
                      adventurer is advised to seek an audience with his
                      local monarch.
                     


                              PART SIX: KINGDOM PROFILES

     Since the more courageous adventurer will not restrict his exploits to any
one kingdom, we present here an abbreviated list of some of the more important
kingdoms, and a smattering of their history. All population data is from the
8721 Census, whose accuracy has been questioned upon many an occasion. The
"minority" field is a percentage of non-human humanoids known to reside in
the kingdom. "Ruler", where appropriate, will list the principal figure of
governmental power. "Income" is the average yearly per capita in gold pieces
among the working class and farmers (if any exist).


       Name: Dieria
      Ruler: Lord Greenham Yiddish
 Government: Disrepresentative idiocracy
 Population: 2,234,926
   Minority: 15 %
       Size: 215 l.
     Income: 124 gp.

     Post-revolutionary Dieria has rapidly replaced Jeria as the economic hub
and trade center of Zerg. Extremely small in size, Dieria is a small island in
the midst of the Northeast Sea and strategically placed in proximity to many
other of the large nations. The Dierian island capital, Scumford, is bustling 
with merchants, sailors, free traders, and other such worldly persons.

     Dieria's history is one of an ongoing conflict between the middle class
free-traders, and the imperialistic nobles of the older Northern Provinces.
For hundreds of years, the nation's economy sagged due to the unwillingness
of the nobility to pay any taxes or relinquish their feudal dues and priv-
eleges, and Dieria was an incessant target for invasion by other nations 
(from 7923 to 8103 Dieria was a territory of Sparadan). With the death of
the last of the noble-dominated Araesius line of kings, the Derian trader
Jermias Denchri led peasants and middle-class into the Revolution of 8644,
and established the country's current form of government. With the collapse
of Jeria in 8457, Dieria rose to power as the leading trade center of
Zerg, and remains the most prosperous, wealthy kingdom in the world.

     Dieria today is theoretically ruled by a body of officials representing 
the various Provinces and the vestigial remainder of the noble lineage, 
but in reality power hails from Scumford, not Ardon, where an assembly of
the nation's most wealthy merchants decides social and political policy
for the nation on a yearly basis. Internal development and infrastructure is
under the auspices of various wealthy merchant lords, and generally is more
efficient and expedient than most conventional governments. Uprisings or
internal strife are very rare, and usually controlled by private armies and
organizations. While there is then an extremely weak official central
government, national stability tends to remain extremely high.

	Laissez-faire (an obscure Elvish term meaning "let it be") is the law
of the land in Dieria. The official government was deliberately constructed
by the middle class of the Revolution to be weak and inefficient, and not
to obstruct free trade. There are thus not only no tariffs or duties on
imports and exports, but no taxes whatsoever, facts that helped Dieria
skyrocket to its present position of center of commerce. Traders and 
merchants of all sizes, kinds, and creeds reside in Scumford, and a man
make amass a fortune or lose his life's savings within hours in the
frenzied interactions. A merchant who knows his business can easily
rake incredible profits on a brief trip to Dieria. One of the reasons
that political conflict among merchants is so rare is because they are
loathe to take their attentions away from business for more than a few
weeks, and that any gain won through such an altercation would hardly
rival that gleaned from the same amount of time spent on trading. This fact
has saved post-Revolutionary Dieria from military conquest time and time
again -- invading armies usually disband to sell their arms and armor
for unimaginable profits, then return to their homeland to fetch more. Thus
are most visitors to Dieria absorbed in the thriving economy.

	The rural Southern Provinces on the mainland are generally occupied
by small, land-owning farmers who make a comfortable living supplying Scumford
and the other large cities with their produce.
