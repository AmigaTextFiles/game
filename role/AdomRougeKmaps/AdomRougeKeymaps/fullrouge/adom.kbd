#  ----------------------------------------------
#    Keymap file for Ancient Domains Of Mystery
#  ----------------------------------------------
#
#  Lines starting with a '#' are ignored.  Empty lines are also ignored.
#
#  Definitions may be up to four characters long (the \C directive does
#  not count as an extra character, e.g. \Cxs is a definition of length 2).
#  If you want to use more than one keycode for a specific command, you can
#  define multiple key-bindings by using the same three-letter-prefix more
#  than once (see the 'Wait' command for an example).
#
#  The following special characters are used:
#
#      \Cx  -- press the controll key and some key x
#      \S   -- SPACE
#      \E   -- ESCAPE
#      \\   -- the backslash '\' itself
#      \xxx -- use the plain ascii key code xxx
#
#  IMPORTANT NOTE:
#  While in theory you can redefine the keys in any way you like in
#  practice this is not necessarily recommened, because some functions
#  in ADOM expect certain commands *not* to be bound to certain letters.
#
#  The following commands (the abbreviations from the definitions are
#  used)			   
#
#    MON MNW MOW MSW MOS MSE MOE MNE WAT
#
#  should *NOT* be bound to one of the following keys (separated by white-
#  space):
#
#    t T z Z \S + -
#
#  You *can* set them to one of the keys mentioned but this breaks all
#  functions for targetting and determining directions.  You have been
#  warned.
