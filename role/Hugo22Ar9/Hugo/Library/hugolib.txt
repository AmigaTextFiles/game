A NOTE ON PRECOMPILING THE HUGO LIBRARY:
----------------------------------------

Generating a precompiled version of HUGOLIB.H can greatly speed up game
development time by saving the compiler having to recompile the Hugo 
Library each time the game source is compiled.

In order to do this, two steps are necessary:


1.  Compile the short file HUGOLIB.HUG as HUGOLIB.HLB via:

        hc -h hugolib.hug

Looking at the Hugo source for HUGOLIB.HUG will reveal that it is basically
a couple of #settings--which notify the compiler to include the files
HUGOFIX.H (the HugoFix debugging library) and VERBSTUB.H (the set of 
additional action verb routines)--the #inclusion of HUGOLIB.H, and an empty 
MAIN routine.  The -h switche forces creation of an .HLB precompiled file
instead of the normal .HEX Hugo executable.

If it is desirable to have a version of HUGOLIB.HLB that does not include
the code for the debugging library or the verb stub routines, it is 
necessary to remove the #setting(s) in question from HUGOLIB.HUG, then 
recompile.


2.  Change the line

        #include "hugolib.h"

in the Hugo game source to

        #link "hugolib.hlb"

and the definition for the MAIN routine from

        routine main
        {...

to

        replace main
        {...

(since HUGOLIB.HLB already has a MAIN routine defined in it).


That's it.  Now whenever the game source is compiled, the Hugo compiler
will quickly and efficiently link the precompiled library.

NOTE:  It is probably desirable to compile a release version of a game
using the original library files instead of a precompiled header.  The
reason for this is that a game compiled with the precompiled header
may tend to be larger due to the fact that it contains unnecessary code--
i.e. the code for routines that are REPLACED in the game source, or
routines that would otherwise have been excluded due to the setting 
or clearing of compiler flags such as DEBUG and VERBSTUBS, or NO_AUX_MATH
and NO_SCRIPTS.
