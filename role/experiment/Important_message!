                                ----------
The Graphic Adventure Creator, or GRAC, is the first program of its kind
to be released for the Amiga. There have been many text adventure creators, 
some of which allow graphics to be added, but GRAC deals with fully animated
graphic adventures in the style of most modern commercial adventure games.
GRAC is designed to be easy to use. No programming experience necessary!

The Experiment was created with GRAC.


   Features of GRAC include:

   * Import graphics from any paint program (including Dpaint).

   * Animation frames grabbed from pictures with the mouse controlled image
     grabber.

   * Up to 100 characters (5 on any single screen) all of whom can walk, 
     talk and perform any other actions.

   * Set up objects, walk areas and puzzles in the room editor, all using 
     the mouse. Typing is kept to a minimum.

   * Music support (Soundtracker) and sound effects. 

   * Customise the control panel, mouse pointer and fonts to give your game
     a distinctive look.

   * Freely distributable player module. GRAC games can be released as PD
     or licenceware.

   * Generic install program will install any GRAC game to hard disk.

   * Tutorial provided to help you get started.

   and many more features all described in the comprehensive 
   documentation.
