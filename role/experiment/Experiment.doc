Instructions
------------

   To start the game, double-click on the icon.

   A screen will appear giving the Story So Far, although the full game has a
   proper introduction. From there, you take control of Bud Lightning.

   It will be a good idea to read the documents... oh, you are. That`s okay
   then. This demo cannot be installed, but the final version will be fully
   installable.

Game Controls
-------------

   The screen is divided into two areas: the control panel and the graphics
   window. The control panel contains a message window, a text window and 
   five verbs;

      Examine               Used for looking more closely at objects
      Use                   Items in the inventory (displayed in the large 
                            window) can be used on other objects.
      Operate               Use an object on its own.
      Take                  Pick up an object.
      Talk                  Talk to anyone worth talking to.

   The left mouse button is used to select verbs in the control panel and 
   move the character if clicked in the graphics window. The right mouse 
   button is used for selection of objects.

   Example: To take the glass, first click with the left button on the 'take' 
   verb, then move the mouse pointer over the glass (the name of the object 
   will appear in the message window) and click the right mouse button.
