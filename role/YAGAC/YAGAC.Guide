  NUM -> internal number of object
  TYPE -> 3 types of objects

        0 for MANAGEABLE -> You can use this type of objects, and pick up

    IF CONDITION

        STAMENTS

    ENDIF

    multiple conditions:

        IF CONDITION
          IF CONDITION
            STAMENTS
          ENDIF
        ENDIF


    the conditions can be:

        OBJECT is the number object


    all conditions of an object present this structure

        DEFATT(OBJECT)

            IF CONDITION
                STAMENTS
            ENDIF

            ENDATT

        ENDDEF

    ENDATT means the finish of conditions of this objects
    and ENDDEF is necessary too.

    IF VERB(OBJECT)
        VERB can be TALK,USE,LOOK,etc

        mean: IF YOU TALK WITH OBJECT THEN STAMENTS

    IF SITEM(OBJECT)=0/1

        mean: IF OBJECT IS IN INVENTARY THEN STAMENTS  0 object in room, 1 object in inventary

    IF VAR(NUMBER)=/>/</»/«NUM

        mean: IF INTERNALS VARIABLE NUMBER IS NUM THEN STAMENTS

            » IS > OR EQUAL

        mean: IF MAN IS IN SCENE ROOM THEN STAMENTS

    IF STATUS(OBJECT)=0/1

        mean: IF VARVAL OF OBJECT IS 0/1 THEN STAMENTS

  STAMENTS:


  VAR(NUM)=1

    Let the internal variable num to 1 or anything number

    variants: VAR(NUM)=+1

            is the same that ADD to VAR(NUM) the number 1

            VAR(NUM)=-1

            is the same of VAR(NUM)=-1 but with minus

  SHOWTEXT "Text",OBJECT
