ATENTION!!! OLD CAG USERS (BELOW V5):


LOAD COMMAND:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~                         

- Command Load changed the way it works. 
  It still resets counter 9 but no longer makes an
  automatic DESC (leaving the conditions).
  This was made to get more power since the big problem
  was always to restore the directory in that present
  game position so that pictures could be correctly
  loaded from disk.
  Eg: if in a LOAD people changed the directory because
      the saved position was not in the current directory,
      it was
      hard for the game to restore it after a SAVE
      as a DESC was made and there was no way for
      the game to know a LOAD had been made. Now it is
      a lot easier.

      Eg: All you have to do is to create a procedure
          specially to restore the directory.
          Use a counter to keep the disk which is
          to be used, for example 255. This counter
          (or any other) everytime you told the user
          to change disk during the game it would assume
          a particular value.
                 Eg: =1 ;disk 1 being used
                     =2 ;disk 2 being used 
                         ...etc

          After a LOAD or SAVE you could jump to 
          a procedure (Eg: Procedure 5) which could have
	  something like:

                 ? ?: equal 255 1 cd "cowabunga_disk1:" desc
                 ? ?: equal 255 2 cd "cowabunga_disk2:" desc
                       ... etc.
       
      
- To make the command Load work as it used to just add
  a Desc after the Load


- There are some limitations of the command SAVE so after a
  LOAD command and before the DESC you must do things like:

  o use the command LimitMouse again
    if during the game you use diferent
    types of mouse limitation

  o change the directory back to
    the one were the files used by
    your adventure (in your present
    room) are (if you are using files
    from disk)

  o if you were playing a specific music
    at the LOAD game position room
    don't forget to activate it again

  o if you were using reserved screen zones
    activate them again

  o restore some colours in screen 0 if
    needed using COLOUR ...

  The best thing to do is to jump to a Procedure after a
  load



DEMO REQUEST.CAG:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CAG is no longer supplied in disks, so to simulate inserting
disk 2 (demos:) just multitask to WB (LEFT AMIGA+A) and from
the EXECUTE or CLI type ASSIGN DEMOS: RAM:   . To remove the
assign just type ASSIGN DEMOS:



VOCABULARY:
~~~~~~~~~~~

I forgot to mention this in old versions of CAG but you can
have up to 255 verbs, 255 adverbs, 255 nouns and 255 adjectives
all numbered from 1 to 255.
