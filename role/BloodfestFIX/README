BloodfestFIX

I forgot an important file from the Bloodfest1.lha archive,
so you have to unpack the BloodfestFIX.lha file to your Bloodfest1
disk (or in case you have installed Bloodfest to your harddisk,
just extract the BloodfestFIX.lha to your Bloodfest directory).
And make sure the terminalpic.im file goes to the gfx directory!

If you have other problems, please send me email at mystic@tlti.tokem.fi.
