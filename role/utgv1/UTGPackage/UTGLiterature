@Node Intro "Introduction to UTG"

        Thank you for trying UTG.  UTG is my attempt to write a 
decent completed game while learning C in the process.  If you
have played the @{" Ult*ma " link Ulti} series, @{" Zerg " link Zerg},  @{" Legend of Lothian " link Lothian} 
or any similar game,  you will likely be quite at home with UTG.
My intent has been to write an entertaining game that will waste a
few days, so unlike most of the Ult*ma series, you should be able to 
play this game to completion without sacrificing your @{" Social Life " link Social},
food or work.  
	If you find bugs, please send me a description via internet at the 
addresses below and I will attempt to correct the problem and dispatch 
an update.  I hope you have as much fun playing this as I did writing it.

@Node Nifty "Nifty"
	There is a lot of stuff that I consider 'funny' in UTG.  If you
think so too, be sure to tell me.  If you don't find things funny, or
any of the political jabs offend you, lighten up!  It's just a game. 
@ENDNODE
@Node Story "Storyline and Playing Guide"
	The King of Agima has ruled fairly and honestly for many 
years, without making many enemies.  While thing King has 
occassionally made unpleasant decisions, they were always for the 
good of Agima.
        Recently, this peaceful rule has been interrupted by evil 
magic, of all things.  The King's servants entered his chamber 
one morning to find him missing, unexplained.  The King's 
advisors have no clue as to the king's whereabouts.  To further 
complicate matters, the King's army,  has disbanded, afraid of 
disappearing themselves. As a direct result, wild animals and 
monsters roam the landscape freely ravaging towns and attacking 
travelers, setting the standard repetitive scenario of games in 
this genre. 
	A simple serf, you are puzzled by the mysterious events that 
are befalling your country.  Ashamed of the state of your 
country, but unable to understand what has happened, you begin 
to experience horrible nightmares of monsters attacking your 
family and of a great evil figure rising to rule the kingdom.  
At last you can take the nightmares no longer, and awaken to 
find that you must try to resolve the problems of the kingdom by 
finding the King, if he is still alive.  The kings advisors 
provide you with a current @{" Map " System "showmap UTGmapIFF"} of Agima, and pledge their aid to 
you in your quest.  With your life's savings and a bit of food, 
your quest begins...@{ " Sieze the moment! " link Sieze}

	Agima is largely a grassy country, with some bushes, trees, 
hills and mountains.  While grass is easily traversed, bushes, 
trees, and hills slow your travel. Mountains totally impede 
travel.  Horses travel more quickly through varied terrain than 
you can on foot, making them extremely handy in dangerous areas, 
paticularly when you realize that monsters can't ride horses!
Players on foot or horseback may also wade in the shallow water 
at the edge of lakes and oceans, but may not swim, due to the 
weight of provisions, armour, etc..  
	Unfortunately, Agima has recently been overrun with animals 
and monsters (due to the decay of the King's military force) 
which wander about the landscape looking for trouble (you.) You 
must purchase weapons and armour and fight these monsters during 
your travels. 
	Spotted across the country are towns and castles.  Oddly 
enough, people typically live in these dwellings, and 
occasionally have things to talk about. Towns and Castles also 
feature merchants eager to sell you their wares from armour to 
weapons to lodging.  Towns are typically monster-free, although you
can never be too sure.
        The key to UTG is talking with other characters.  
Conversations with characters will occasionally yield information 
which will aid you in your quest, although many characters have 
little or nothing useful to say (as is frequently the case in 
real life.)  Characters may also posess items of use to you, but 
may not simply hand them over to you.  While the names of some of 
the characters may or may not be amusing to you, you may gain 
this information by LOOKing at them (presumably they see you 
staring and volunteer their name so as to avoid being brutally 
slain by you :) )  It is rather important that you speak with all 
the people in Agima, to gather all the clues necessary to rescue 
the King (and to see all the semi-amusing jabs I've slipped in.  
Hey, some people simply have nothing of use to say!)
	Upon beginning a new character in UTG, it is wise to stay 
near a town and save very often, as death is very swift and very 
permanent.  As you fight and kill more and more monsters, your 
ability to withstand attack will increase, as will your ability 
to purchase better weapons and armour since most monsters will 
either carry gold, or have some sort of resale value (furs, teeth,
extremely large bottles of premium malt liquor,etc...)

@ENDNODE
@Node Control "Controlling UTG"
	UTG may be started from it's icon, or from a saved game icon 
in the same drawer.  UTG Does not run from the CLI.
	Upon starting UTG, the screen is displayed, and game data is 
loaded  (~2 seconds from Hard Drive.)  When UTG has finished 
initializing, you are asked for your name (1-10 characters, 
followed by ENTER.)  If UTG cannot find a saved game under that 
name, it will begin a new game,  which begins when the exquisitely
primitive UTG Map is displayed at the left.  If a saved game is found,
it is loaded and play continues where saved.
	Be sure to save your game frequently, accomplished with a 
pull down menu, or AMIGA-S.  As noted before, Death is very swift,
and very permanent in UTG.
	Pressing the HELP key at most any time will yield a list of  
commands which are available.  Pull down menus provide additional 
commands and shortcuts.  
	If the Display Map options in the textfile do not work, you
may customize the file "showmap" for your favorite IFF viewer.
@{" Command Summary " link Commands} @{" Tooltypes " link Tooltypes}


@ENDNODE
@Node Status "Status Display"
	As the main character of UTG, you are provided with a 
sophisticated display of indicators representing your status.
If you are slain and restart the game, these values will return
to their defaults or what they were when you saved the game. (You
did save didn't you?) 

Food:

	Food is consumed as you travel about Agima.  If you run out 
of food, your health will, oddly enough, go down, bringing you 
slightly closer to death.  For this reason, if you are planning a 
long  journey, either make arrangements to buy food, or make 
arrangements to die.  Simple 'eh?

Health:

	Heath will also be affected by attacks.  If you are  injured 
during melee, your health will recede.  Health may be  restored 
by several methods:Sleeping, Magic, and good old fashioned time.  

Experience:

	As you become more worldly and skilled (through the defeat 
of animals and monsters) your experience increases.  This in  
turn increases your overall ability to withstand pain and injury, 
making your death less likely.  Unfortunately, as you grow in 
experience, different and more powerful monsters will naturally 
seek you out and attack you.  There are however, no extremist environmental
groups to hassle you in Agima, so feel free to slay everything that
gets in your way.  In fact, if you see an environmentalist in Agima, 
feel free to slay them too.  

Gold:

	The accumulation of gold and gold-yielding items.  Agima benefits
from being a fictional world, in that there are no neo-socialists seeking
to take your gold and give it to others in some sort of pseudo-equality.
You may therefore feel free to excell, without regard to such stupidity.

Wind:

	Wind direction affects your ship-based travel.  As you can tell,
there is plenty of hot-air in UTG to stir up wind currents.  It is also
worthy to note that there are no luxury taxes for ships in Agima.

Technical Notes (How to Make a 1 Month Project turn into a Year)

	UTG was coded with both Lattice C 5.04 and SAS/C 6.00 on 
both an Amiga 500 with 3 megs of memory and an Amiga 3000/25 with 
6 megs of memory.  
	Enforcer was run during most of UTG's development, so UTG
should be fairly well behaved (although I'm not sure how legal my 
double-buffering routines are, hence the tooltype to turn it off.) 
There are no Enforcer hits that I have found while running it.  
I can not understand how some folks can write software and release 
it with enforcer hits, unless they just don't test it.  Not having
an MMU is NO EXCUSE.  There were over 20 people on internet who 
volunteered to help me test this when I asked, most of which had 
A4000's.
	Although I initially planned to release this in September 
1992, it quickly became evident that UTG would take longer than 
expected.  Final Release Date: 
	UTG is my first major project in C.  Coding a big project 
in stages seems to be a magnificent way to learn a new language.  
	Now What Do I Do?  If You'd Like to See a UTG II, be sure
to tell me.  If you have suggestions, be sure to let me know, 
although, If you're writing to tell me to keep my creations to myself,
mail your reasons directly to NIL:

@Node Ulti "Ult*ma"
	I'd be amazed if they even work on your machine, with the
bad programming they contained.  When I saw that Ult*ma IV wouldn't
even work on my A3000 correctly when degraded (anytime you have to 
type something, you either get no characters, or a bunch of
characters) I realized that some people can't program to save their
life.  I wonder what they will do when MS-DOS finally dies and they
have to program to an API such as OS/2 or Windows.  This is probably
why they ignore the Mac, even though millions of them have been sold.
@ENDNODE
@Node Zerg "Zerg"
	Zerg is a fanciful little work by Mike Shapiro.  While the game
was a bit brief, the docs were riotous.  Even today, several years
after it's writing, Zerg works, with only minor problems.
@ENDNODE
@Node Lothian "Legend of Lothian"
	A similar game in this genre by David Meny.  Lothian displays
still images of monsters as you fight them.  The pictures are far
better than anything I could draw.  If you haven't seen this, scan the
FTP sites.  It's quite entertaining.
@ENDNODE
@Node Double "DoubleBuffering"
	Double-buffering uses two screens.  One you can see, and one
you can not.  The program draws to the screen you can not see.  When it
has finished drawing, it shows you the finished product, instead of
building it before your eyes.  The next time it needs to update the 
screen, you see the last screen while the other screen is built 'behind
your back', and then switched in when ready.  Double-Buffering is
frequently used to eliminate flickering in animation.
@ENDNODE
@Node Social "Social Life"
	A Social Life is when you go out with a member of the opposite
sex, talk about anything except computers, and do analog stuff afterwards.
(my appologies to Guy Kawasaki.)
@ENDNODE
@Node Fastmem "Fast Memory"
	The fact that you are running Amiga Guide means that this
probably won't be much of a problem.  The Amiga family of microcomputers
seem to run much faster with fast memory, than without.  Indeed if you
have no fact memory, you should save every penny you get, including
money that would normally be spent on food, and get some fast memory.
	If you are not fortunate enough to have fast memory, but have
1 megabyte of Chip memory, UTG will happily run, although a bit more slowly.
@ENDNODE

@Node Sieze "Sieze the Moment"
	In other words, get to it.  Begin, Start, Commence, Break it down...
@ENDNODE
@Node Music "Music"
	The music in UTG was composed by me.  Most parts were originally
written for guitar, then twisted and contorted until I could tolerate
their electronic equivalents.  The fight music is very similar to a
song I wrote and play with my band whenever we have a drummer.
	There is also a huge med module which consists mostly of samples
of me playing guitar.  Due to size, it is not the default music for UTG.
You can find it in the UTG archive, but the installation utility will
not install it.

@Node CLI " Running UTG from the CLI"
	The Amiga Workbench is finally robust enough, with the release
and widespread usage of Kickstart 2.04. to be used for every-day tasks.
	As a direct result, UTG does not run from the CLI.  It was 
explicitly written to run from an ICON.  
	You may, however, feel free to copy your UTG saved games with 
the CLI, or even browse the various UTG drawers with the CLI.

@Node warning " UTG Warning "
--- W A R N I N G:
	UTG contains graphic situations, and language which may 
unsuitable for children.  It is suggested that parents preview UTG to
determine it's suitability for their children.  The author accepts no
responsibility for any problems that arise from small children playing
UTG.	UTG is not intended to indoctrinate your children, so it is
probably safer than the US public education system, although the heavy
satire may be more than younger players can handle.

@ENDNODE
@Node Tooltypes "UTG Tooltypes"
	UTG supports the following tooltypes:

		DISPLAYID=hexnum  -  Forces UTG to use a screen with 
					the ID you specify by hexnum. 
					If this tooltype doesn't exist,
					or is remarked out, a requester
					will let you pick the mode, and
					output the appropriate ID, so 
					you may update your icon.
		NOMUSIC           -  Startup without @{" Music " link Music}
		NODOUBLEBUFFER    -  Startup with @{" Double Buffering " link Double} off.
					Double-Buffering may smooth
					the games appearance a bit, but
					detracts from speed. 
		NOCUSTOMSCREEN    -  Open UTG on Workbench.  This also
					turns off doublebuffering.
					The NOPALETTESET tooltype will
					control palette behavior in 
					workbench mode.
		NOPALETTESET	  -  Don't change the palette.  Normally,
					in Workbench mode, UTG will modify
					the palette to suit it when it's
					window is active, and put it back
					via the PALETTE preferences editor
					when it's window is inactive.  If you
					want to suspend this behavior, use
					this tooltype.
