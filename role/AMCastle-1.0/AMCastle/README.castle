To run this castle demo, put file "tiles.iff" into your AmigaMUD:Images
directory. Then, run MUDServ from the directory you have unpacked this
archive into. Then, run MUD for a local connection, and explore the castle.

P.S. I actually built this castle with Lego bricks, so it makes sense
physically.
