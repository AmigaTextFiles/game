(a) Cannot play games requiring Z machine versions above version 3.

(b) The interpreter is just crying out for an X interface.  I have
    many ideas but not much X experience (or time :)  If you're an
    experienced X and C programmer and would like to take a stab at
    it, please contact the current maintainer (see above).
