Dungeon V2.00 Introduction

Got an Amiga?  Got a Modem?  Good.  Now, get a friend with a computer - any
computer - and a modem.  Have your friend call you up with an ANSI terminal
program and play Dungeon V2.00!

Whether your friends have IBMs, Macs, or even Ataris, if they have a modem
and an ANSI terminal program, they can enter the Dungeon!

Dungeon V2.00 is a full-blown text-based adventure engine.  Any person with
an ANSI terminal can enter the dungeon with you and go head-to-head in a
fight to the finish.

It's not just a dungeon slaughterfest either.  Custom modules allow you to
explore many different worlds with many different goals.  You can cooperate
with your remote partner or attack!

Dungeon V2.00 Requirements

You'll need an Amiga computer with at least 1 Meg of memory (1 Meg of CHIP
memory is recommended but not necessary).

Dungeon V2.00 should work with any version of Kickstart.

If you have registered, you'll also want a modem and someone to play
against.

Dungeon V2.00 Installation

Copy the Archive to your hard drive or floppy.  Keep the integrity of the
archive intact (don't go hiding the "Maps" directory).  Put the Library
into your "Libs:" directory.

Pretty simple, huh?

Dungeon V2.00 Startup

Double click on the DungeonV2.00 Icon to start the game.

The program will open its screen and display the registration number.

Firt time you run it, the program will not be able to find the configuration
(since it has not created one yet).  If you have Kickstart 2.00 or higher,
it will grab your serial prefs from your "ENV:" directory.  In any case,
you can set the prefs irrespective of your Intuition prefs.  I suggest you
use at least 16k for your buffer, to avoid slowdowns of the data transfer
at higher speeds.

The relevant function keys scroll through the options for each setting.

Once you've set your serial prefs, it will then open your serial port (Make
sure your modem is turned on).  Note: It will only attempt to open the
serial port if you have selected `No' for `Solo Game'.

The program will then ask if you wish to make a Null Modem connection (in
case you don't have Null Game selected in your prefs).  If you don't
answer, the program will default to "No" after about five seconds.

Next, you will be presented with options for game play.

Intro Mods are just music modules which play while the intro text for a
dungeon is displayed.  If your computer keeps crashing during gameplay, try
turning this option off.

Sound allows you to hear indicators of some of the functions, such as
dropping items, equipping weapons and opening doors.  If you are low on
memory, turn this option off.

If you haven't registered, the next two options will be unalterable.

Solo game refers to whether or not you wish to have a remote player in the
dungeon with you.

Null Modem allows you to disable the Hayes(tm) command set and go directly to
the main game mode.  Set this option to yes if you have two computers
linked together through a null modem cable.

Once you have verified these settings, you are ready to play!

Dungeon V2.00 Playing The Game

While you are offline, you can quit with the upper left quit button,
iconify the program with the upper right iconify button, change your modem
settings, game settings and select a dungeon map.  The status window at the
bottom of the screen shows your current settings.

If you are in a hurry, just hit the start button.  If you haven't picked a
dungeon map yet, You'll be presented with that requester.

Map Selection

The requester is the same as one you would find on the workbench.  Just
double click on the name of the map you want to play.  You can change the
path to the map files by ckicking on the current path and entering a new
one.

If you are in the "modem" mode, the game will set your modem to "auto
answer" and go into a "wait state" with a simple display until the phone
rings.  (Remember to turn off your answering machine and tell your
family/friends/inmates to KEEP THEIR DAMNED HANDS OFF THE PHONE!)

When the phone rings, the screen will return to the Dungeon V2.00 display
and the connection will be negotiated.

Let The Battle Commence!

The first thing you will see is the FBN title page, which lets you, and
your opponent, know who made this fine program.

Next, the introductory text for the dungeon will be displayed.  If you have
music turned on, the intro tune will play at this time (if there is an
intro tune for that particular dungeon).

You will next be prompted to enter your name.

Next, a page of quest information will be displayed, such as whether or not
items, potions or armour will be added to the dungeon.  It will also tell
you what your goal is and where the exits are (if any).

After you have read the quest information, you will be told who you are
facing in the dungeon (if anyone) and the game will add the random elements
to the map.

You may now truly enter the dungeon.

Room Display

The program will give you a display of the room in the following fashion:

Room Name        The name of the location you are in.

Endurance        Your current and maximum endurance.  If it falls to zero,
                 you are dead.  Each monster you kill raises your maximum
                 endurance.

Bonus            The higher this number is, the better you will be at
                 combat.

Weapon           This shows the name of the weapon you are currently using.
                 Don't forget to equip new weapons when you pick them up.

Armour           The name of your armour and its condition will be
                 displayed here.

Room Description If you have not been to a room before, the room location
                 will be displayed.

Directions       The valid directions in which you may move from this room
                 will be displayed, as will the status of any locked doors.

Items            Any items that you may pick up will be here.  Weapons and
                 armour show up in purple, potions and keys in green, items
                 in yellow.

Monsters         If the monster is alive, it will show up in red.  If it is
                 dead, it will show up in green.

Entering Commands

Commands in Dungeon V2.00 are similar to those in any adventure game.  A
verb is followed by a noun of some sort.  A full list of verbs can be found
on the Vocabulary page.  Not all verbs require a noun to complete the
sentence.

The parser (the code that deciphers your English words into something the
program can act upon) is fairly intuitive in that, if you say "get gu", it
will look at the room to see if anything there contains "gu".  So, that
command would pick up either a "ray GUn", a "bowl of GUppies" or some such.
It has been designed this way so that you are not required to type in huge
names for items.  Be advised, however, that you may sometimes get strange
results if you are not specific enough.  For example, if your inventory
contains a "Pass Card" and an "Assault Rifle" and you enter "Drop ass", the
"Pass Card" will be dropped first, as it is the first item which contains
the "ass" string.

You may also use the button interface to enter commands.  The Close Button,
in the upper left corner, is now the quit button.  Use this button to end a
dungeon game in progress.

The centre panel contains a "movement diamond" with pass being the "X" in
the centre.  The lower right panel contains ten icons which represent game
commands.  They are, from left to right:

Top Row:    Up   Fight*     Equip* Get*  Use*
Bottom Row: Down Inventory  Wear*  Drop* Quest

The icons with * beside them require you to enter a noun and press RETURN.

Aggression

Sometimes, the monsters just don't like your looks.  These monsters will
attack you as soon as you walk into the room.

Combat

It's important to be ready for combat.  So equip those weapons and wear
that armour.  Don't be afraid to run away if you are getting pummelled.
Every monster you kill, however, adds one to your Bonus and a varying
amount to your endurance.  Here's a hint: You can equip and wear without
finishing your turn, so check your equipment BEFORE entering combat.

Potions

They aren't always called potions, but they always do the same things.
Potions (or food or drinks) can do one of four things:  Heal your wounds
(endurance), Raise your strength (bonus), Teleport you, or Kill you.
Beware of poison.  It's not a nice place out there in dungeon-land.

Gunda

Sometimes, your luck just runs sour.  You can wander for days and never
find a good weapon or that healing potion.  That's where Gunda comes in.

Gunda is a roaming merchant.  His brightly striped tent has been found in
the oddest of places, and Gunda is ever ready, with his refreshing fruit
drinks, to sell you what you need.

You will be allowed five options before control returns to the other
player.  Gunda is never in one place for long, so do your shopping quickly.

Gunda sells items for endurance.  And it isn't current endurance, it's
maximum.  Watch out and don't overspend, just in case there's a monster
lurking around the corner.

Goals

Sometimes, you just have to kill everything.  But, since that is boring at
times, not to mention hazardous to your health, a lot of dungeons have
different goals.  In "Aliens!", for example, you have to find the research
notes and the experimental weapon and take them to the escape pod.
Sometimes, you have to kill a special monster.  Special monsters don't
always stay in one place, though they are limited to the map, as you are.

The "Quest" command will tell you what you need to get or do to win.  If
you are required to have items, they must be in your inventory, not in use.
So, for "Aliens!", don't equip the experimental weapon, just leave it in
your pocket.

Aftermath

Once the game is over, either by achieving the goal or one of the players
dying, you will be shown a final standings tally.

If you are in modem mode, you will be put into chat mode to talk with your
opponent.

You will then be presented with an option to play another game of Dungeon.
If you say no, the connection will be closed and the program will end.

If you say yes, you will be asked whether to use the same dungeon map
again.  If you say no, the requester will pop up and you can select a
different map.

Then the game begins again.

Dungeon V2.00 Vocabulary

Commands                   Actions
?, Help                    Display this list of verbs and give some
                           information on how the program understands your
                           commands.

Quit, Exit                 End a dungeon game.  When you use this command,
                           you are giving up and, therefore, you lose the
                           game.

Chat, Talk                 Engage the remote player in chat.  This option
                           only works while you are connected to a remote
                           player.

Yell                       Send a short message to the other player without
                           engaging in chat.  This command is only useful
                           when you are connected to a remote player.

Go, Move, Walk, Run        Follow this command with a direction, such as
                           "Go North" or "Move Aft", to move in that
                           direction.  You may also use just the first
                           letter of a direction, such as "N", to move to
                           the north.

Get, Take, Grab            Follow this command with the name, or partial
                           name, of the item you wish to pick up.  For
                           example, "Get Gun" to pick up a gun.

Inventory, Carrying        This command will give you a list of what you
                           are carrying in your pockets.  You can carry a
                           maximum of five items.

Information, Quest         This command will tell you how close you are to
                           winning the game.  It will tell you what you
                           need to do, or get, and the names of the rooms
                           that are considered exits.  It will also give
                           you the location of Gunda The Merchant if there
                           is a store in the dungeon.

Pass, Wait                 If you are waiting for your opponent to catch
                           up, you can use this command to remain where you
                           are, doing nothing.

Use, Eat, Drink            Be it a potion, food, drink or an item, this
                           command allows you to do with the item whatever
                           you should.  Follow the command with the name of
                           the item.

Wear                       If you have armour in your inventory, this
                           command, followed by the armour name, will put
                           on the armour and discard whatever you were
                           wearing before.

Equip                      This command, followed by the name of a weapon,
                           selects that weapon to be the one you use.  It
                           puts any previous weapon back in your inventory.

Drop                       If you have too many things in your pockets, or
                           just want to get rid of an item, use this
                           command, followed by the name of the item you
                           wish to drop.

Fight, Attack, Kill, Punch Follow this command with the name of the thing
                           you wish to attack.  Fighting lasts for a
                           maximum of five rounds before control is passed
                           back to the other player.  You may attack again
                           on your next turn.

Shop, Store, Gunda, Tent   If there is a store somewhere in the dungeon and
                           you happen across it, this command allows you to
                           enter the shop and purchase items.

Pickpocket, Steal, Thief   If you are connected to a remote player and that
                           player is at the same location as you, you can
                           attempt to take an item from the remote player's
                           inventory.

Look                       If you want to redisplay the information for the
                           current room, you can use this command to do so.

Dungeon V2.00 Dungeon Theory

Once upon a time, computers didn't have Megs of memory to throw around
willy-nilly.  Back then, text was all you could expect from a game, if you
were lucky enough to be able to play a game at all.

From that sad beginning, adventure games sprang (That's right, sprang.  Got
a problem with that?)  Most memorable are the Infocom games such as Zork.
There were a few attempts at making these games graphical, but it just
didn't capture the feel of the old games - games that let you use your
imagination.

I always liked those adventure games, even if they were easily solved.  It
was interesting to wander around in an old castle, or in a spaceport,
interacting with objects and creatures.  The only thing missing was the
human element.

There were a few attempts at making the adventure game more modern and at
linking it to another computer, but those programs are mostly gone and
forgotten.

There is something to be said for the game that relies on your imagination
for its appeal.  That's where Dungeon came in.  It was a simple adventure
game, pitting you against computer controlled monsters and a human
opponent.  Unfortunately, it was just one dungeon, over and over, and the
options were rather limited.

With Dungeon V2.00, the entire look and style has been altered.  With the
addition of external maps, Dungeon V2.00 has become not one, but many
different adventures.  I hope you will enjoy and use the program as often
as I do.

Dungeon V2.00 Registration

What's Missing?

If you are trying Dungeon V2.00 for the first time, you'll notice something
is missing - the modem options.  That's it, though.  You won't see any
time-wasting requesters or silly screens added for your aggravation.

Why Register?

If you don't register, you're doomed to wandering around in the dungeon
alone.  One of the best features of Dungeon V2.00 is the ability to get
another victim, err, opponent, into the dungeon with you to take out your
frustrations on.

It should be noted, however, that your unregistered version of Dungeon
V2.00 will still make use of any Dungeon V2.00 Modules that you have
purchased.

How Do I Register?

Dungeon V2.00 can be registered at a cost of $15.00 plus $2.00 for shipping
and handling, or include a blank disk and a SASE (a regular letter stamp
should suffice) to avoid the shipping and handling charges.

If you are interested in other FBN products, take a look at the FBN
Catalog.  You'll find descriptions of all the current products, as well as
news about upcoming releases.  There is also a handy order form for you to

Dungeon V2.00 Modules

Module                 Description
Classic                From the good old days of Dungeon V1.00, this one is
                       an homage to the spirit of the original.  The same
                       monsters, the same weapons - it's all here, and it's
                       included with the Dungeon V2.00 program.

Alien Derelict         Out in space, far from any help, you have to find
                       the code key and get off the alien vessel so that
                       the scientists of Earth can use that information to
                       destroy the alien vessel before it hits the Earth.
                       Grab your weapon and hope you can survive the
                       monsters and other hazards of the Alien Derelict.

The Riddle Of Chang Ku In a far off land that no one remembers, stand the
                       twin fortresses of Chang Ku and Chang Lom, former
                       home of the warrior priests of the two headed god
                       Lom Ku.  Archaeologists and grave robbers alike
                       scour the ruins for treasures.  As an ancestor of
                       the original warrior priests, you must rid the area
                       of those who wish to desecrate the sanctity of the
                       great fortresses.  Beware, the gods are watching.

The House Of Fright    In a normal world, things like this don't happen.
                       In a normal world, you wouldn't be searching a haunted
                       house for the last will and testament of someone
                       named `Uncle Bohunk'.  Find yourself something to
                       protect yourself with - even a book - and grab up
                       something to fend off the hordes of undead that keep
                       popping up.

Aliens!                In a blaze of flame, you blast through another
                       clump of aliens.  The research notes are in your
                       pocket, nestled against the experimental weapon that
                       can save the galaxy from the slavering hordes of
                       voracious aliens.  Now all you have to do is get out
                       alive!

Shootout At The
     CyberSpace Corral Welcome to the Old West!  The town of CyberSpace
                       Gulch needs your help, Pardner.  Giark and the BBS
                       Gang has taken over the town.  It's up to you to
                       bring law back to the town.  Don't be fooled by
                       them!  They'll gun you down without a thought.

Rumble In The Subway   The exits are sealed and so is your fate.  As a
                       member of the special crime task force, it's your
                       job to take out thegang boss that your team has
                       trapped in the subway station.  Only problem is, he
                       won't stand still.  Catch and kill Big Bad Louie -
                       if you can.

        I find the game very addicting.  Its extremely fun to play against a
friend especially since you can yell to him/her while you're playing.  Another
cool thing I like about it is that the different weapon, armour, and enemies
are all randomly placed in the different scenarios each time that you play.
That makes it kinda different each time you play.  Another cool added feature
is the missions in each scenario. Win by killing your opponent (2 player) or
by completing a mission objective before the other person.

and thats what I think....   (I'm not kissing up for a cheap registered copy
either)   <GRIN>

Dungeon V2.00....Hmmmm   Dungeon 2.00 is a highly versatile game, while being
quite simple for the player(s) to handle.  You could be in a dungeon one game,
and be on a space ship the next....  Monsters are also versatile....some are
HARD to beat(Demon...I did not have holy weapons!), and others are just cannon
fodder(Goblins).  I highly enjoyed playing the game with Giark.
I found it easy to learn, and VERY addictive.  IF(I do not know) the person
(user) could design their own 'adventures' I would WANT the game!!!!!  It is
a GREAT effort, on Giark's part.  Hope you have a lot of success!!

Note:  I WILL make a Map Editor if I get enough registrations.  For now,
all maps are created at FBN Headquarters.
