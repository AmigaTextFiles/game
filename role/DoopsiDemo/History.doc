           them!!)

V1.30   EDITOR

        -  Fixed a bug in the Empty Zones: if the scene is not loaded (i.e.
           a "File Not Found" occurred) they won't try to redraw anymore.
        -  Now Lister and other objects slide correctly.
        -  Now all upcoming window will lock the previous one.
        -  Fixed a display bug in the DOOPSI-Coder, now all the code should

           restored to their originals.

        -  Now player checks if the default man is actually an anim obj.
        -  Some internal code sniff-snuff.

           "kill" gadget without any file, it crashes the machine.

           can see the file name that you have selected.
        -  Lister interface completely rewritten.
        -  Dialog Editor now uses the new Lister in all situations.
        -  Now all ListView shows the selected item (OS3.0+ only).

           one will move also the second (OS3.0+ only).
        -  Better clean up routine (about 20% faster).

        -  NEW TUTORIAL... try to talk with the "Black Hole" in the third
           screen!!!!

V1.11   -  Fixed a small bug in the Path Editor.
        -  Now the "current object" field is updated also when you 
           click on an object on the scene. (Before this fix, the object
           selected become the current one, but the "current object" field
           was not updated.)
