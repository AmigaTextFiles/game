 Now you can choose whether you will see the full calculation of tests in

 as it makes roleplaying much easier and more fun if your character has a

 things like why your character began adventuring, and what their long
 term goals are. Try not to make it too unlikely..

  BACKGROUND: Algahaarn was abandoned by his mother as a baby, and was
 brought up until the age of 8 by a group of cut throats in the town of
 Tharthaal. When Nuln inquisitors first came to the town they took it upon
 themselves to eliminate all traces of the 'theives guild', and murdered
 his only family. The only way of life he knew was that of the theif, but
 he was not a very competant one, and was cought by town guards and put in
 prison for a short period as a warning. One of the cooks at the gaurd
 building and prison liked him, and decided to take him in, and they lived
 quite happily there for about two years. Then one night 3 of the town
 guards died in their sleep, and after examination the cause of death was
 thought to be poison. The order of Nuln found out about this, and
 concluded she (the cook) was a witch, burning her at the stake publicly
 in the town's arena. Since that day, Algahaarn has sworn revenge on the
 inquisitors, and uses all opertunities to damage them without being
 found.
