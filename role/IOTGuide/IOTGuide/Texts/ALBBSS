 The Sword & Skull BBS: 0113 2260866 (Mike Dawes)

  The Sword & Skull is the worlds AL headquarters, offering the best
 support to players when it comes to advice on the games. The author of
 Arcane Lore, Mystic RPG, and Insignia Of Terror is the sysop of the BBS,
 and is available at most times for discussion, questions, complaints or
 praise. The S&S is designed soully with AL players in mind, and does not
 have a strong filebase or mail options. I'll leave this up to the big
 boys in the BBS scene as they can do it much better than I... For friendly
 help and advice on the game, the Sword & Skull can not be beaten, and
 there is always a guarantee that all the latest AL related files will be
 online. AL players should point off another BBS with either an ALNet
 node, or Email facilities. (preferably both!)

  Also there is a NEW addition to the S&S in the online RPG section! This
 new development lets you take the role of a character in the Sword &
 Skull Tavern in the town Tharthaal, and your actions and speech are
 relayed back to players in IOT proper.. You can also roleplay with the GM
 live as long as you can remain in character! It's quite complex, so I
 won't explain.. If you're interested in this idea just call the S&S!


 The Borg Homeworld: 0113 2253772 (24h) (Paul Green)

  Probably Northern England's best Amiga BBS! Carries many networks and
 has a very helpful and friendly sysop. The Borg Homeworld is also the
 originator of BorgNet, the best 'small' mail network going. The Homeworld
 is always happy to recieve new points, and has an extremely healthy
 filebase containing multiple online Aminet CDs.
