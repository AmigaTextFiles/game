@node "PGuide" "IOT - The Player's Guide"


  Insignia Of Terror is a new type of RPG.. After years of development it
 is a formidable multiplayer game that offers something to new and
 experienced Roleplayers alike. A completely open ended game, IOT lets
 players choose their own goals, friends and enemies, and has a very
 detailed campaign world.

  This player's guide to IOT tells you everything you need to know before
 you can start playing in the game, including masses of background
 information for the gameworld, and graphic illustration!

  The player's guide is FREE, and available in AmigaGuide and HTML formats
 with a printed version to follow shortly. The files can be found on BBSs
 worldwide through aminet, or downloaded from Aminet itself. The Sword &
 Skull BBS is guarenteed to carry ALL Arcane Lore related files, call on:
 0113 2260866 (UK).

@node "MMag" "Mystic Magazine"


  Mystic Magazine is an AmigaGuide/HTML quarterly diskmag primarily for
 discussion of MFD products, and what has been happening in the land of
 Irall Rhin, where IOT is set. The magazine is edited by Mike Dawes, the
 author of IOT, who also contributes most to the magazine's text.
 Readers are encouraged to send in contributions of any type (as long as
 it's legal!) For inclusion in the diskmag. Mmag is an indisposable source
 of background information for IOT, especially if as a player you don't
 have access to ALNet or the S&S BBS.

  Issue 1 of Mystic Magazine can be found in all the normal places, and
 the possibility of a printed version is currently being looked into.

  Mystic magazine is FREE in it's electronic forms.

@node "GMG" "Mystic RPG, the GM's guide"

 
  This is the definative Mystic RPG rulebook, containing all the
 information from the players guide, and much, much more. The guide
 explains all of the tests and tables, details character generation,
 combat, magic calculation etc, as well as having a HUGE section full of
 background info, and creature statistics.. In fact, it documents over 70
 indevidual races! Also there are pages deticated to the realm of Irall
 Rhin, it's cities, and how it's politics work. The guide also contains
 the information you need to start playing a Mystic based game at home
 with your friends, as well as how to run a Mystic RPG in ANY setting,
 from medieval, through modern day to fantasy and futuristic! The
 information's also there for you to start GMing IOT alongside MFD, so as
 a GM you'd effectively own a town in Irall Rhin, GMing many players.

  The GM's Guide is available ONLY in printed form. This is to increase
 it's usefulness as well as decrease the chances of piracy.

  The Guide's cost has not yet been decided.

@node "GMTool" "GM's tool pack"


  This package contains utilities designed by MFD and other contributers.
 All of the utils in this archive are for the AMIGA range of computers,
 and have been designed to help the GM do his/her job. Utils include a

 Ascii character sheets, an Arexx dice rolling module for GED and WW6, a
 description adder for use in players turns, a helpful 'wizard in a
 window' who can help you with any of the rules, and a turn interpretter
 that can respond to the *Command lines.

  It is possible that any part of the archive mentioned above may not be
 included, especially in it's first release.

  The price for the GM's tool pack is undecided at this stage, but money
 will be divided between the authors of the included programs.

                           The year is 3015 AD
           Earth is in a state of ruin after it's 4th World War
                  The Terrans have other problems too..


 The Major Powers: 1) Terran Confederate
                   2) The Empire Of Taavin
                   3) Black Viper Loyalists


 1) The Terran Confederate: The remaining humans set up the Confederate
 after the 2nd great disaster. Headed by a small govournment, the
 Confederation fights both the Empire Of Taavin and the Black Viper
 Loyalists to keep it's territory. There is a project to clear up Earth
 and re-colonise, unfortunatly the other powers have similar ideas.

 2) The Empire Of Taavin: Ruled over by Emperor Tienarch, the Empire of
 Taavin was originally led by Rian Hudson, who was killed by the Terran
 Special Forces Operative; Francis Burnard. Tienarch was Hudson's 1st
 Officer, and claimed the empire his own upon his master's death. Hudson
 was merely an extremly powerful terrorist leader, and commanded his
 allies under a banner of 'The Black Vipers'.

 3) Black Viper Loyalists: A great number of Rian Hudson's followers split
 from the force when Tienarch took control. They stick to the more chaotic
 and destructive policies of their former leader, but tend to concentrate
 their fire-power on the Empire Of Taavin.


 The Major Races:

 1) Terrans     : Human
 2) Pollorn     : Grey/blue skinned, agressive humanoid
 2) The Bhuk'an : 8 ft honourable warrior race
 3) The Illiad  : 1ft long flying tadpole, with a big eye on the front


 Threats to all powers include space pirates, the fearful Kruxxos, and
 it's hybrid the Kruxxorn. Recent development of light speed drives have
 made the discovery of new races frequent. Another possible threat is that
 of the Illiad-ry, the outcast warrior species of the Illiad.


 Player races: Terran
               Droid (terran, Bhuk'an, Illiad or Illiad-ry)
               Pollorn
               Bhuk'an
               (More to come)

 Player forces: Terran Confederate
                The Empire Of Taavin
                Black Viper Loyalists
                Space Pirates
                Independant
                Rebellion (against the confederation)
                Priesthood Of Khil-dor
                (More to come)



  Space Mystic is a new game that works in the same way as IOT.. Obviously
 there is one major difference; It's set in the extreme future! The game
 is set around station 3014, a huge, mobile station constructed for the
 terran confederate. S3014's location on the edge of human territory makes
 it a popular meeting place for the main races and powers.

  SM will cost the same to play as IOT, and will have a simialr player's
 guide which contains useful background information etc.

@node "Alone" "AL-One.."


  AL-One.. This is a planned Amiga RPG that should have both single and
 multiplayer (networked) options. There are complex plans for this game,
 and as such it is quite possible that it could be a long time/eternity
 before it appears. The concept of the game would be to have a randomly,
 or player generated dungeon made from HAM-8 hires-laced/productivity
 rooms, and have the players walk about this dungeon searching for wealth,
 and the other player. It may not sound original, but, in reality it will
 be, as there is a lot I'm planning to put into it.

@node "PBM" "Play By Mail IOT!"


  A PBM version of IOT is in the pipework, allowing people to through the
 post! This addition to the game is extremely important as it will cause a
 massive increase in the game's playerbase. Playing in the PBM version
 will cost more than the Email version because of printing and postage
 costs, but it will still be very competative. Getting more players is the
 most effective way to improve the enjoyment of the game for players, too,
 so this will probably be the game's most important step since it's
 initial release.

  To play the PBM game you'd have to purchase the printed version of the
 Player's Guide, which will detail what steps you have to go through to
 start playing in this way.

  When the PBM line is passed, IOT will be competing with the best PBM
 games around, and could fall at their feet after a one sided battle. One
 of their strongest points next to money is their long standing player-
 base. My strategy here is to use little advetising, but offer players
 large bonuses for new player recruitment, as well as having all the Email
 players here first.. Basically, before IOT even ventures into the PBM
 field it should have a strong playerbase, and I'm SURE that with
 everyone's support, and continued interest, IOT, AL and Mystic RPG will
 live a long and healthy life.

@node "3015" "Space Station 3015, a new type of adventure!"


  SS3015 will be a new type of RPG for amiga computers. Inspired by
 popular space combat games, MFD realised that the really worthwhile and
 interesting part wasn't in fact the space travel and combat, but the
 interlinking plot sections! SS3015 is what happens when you remove the
 space combat sections, and add a lot of new RPG elements. I have many
 ideas for this game, some of which may not be included, but, in it's
 finished state this game could be very nice indeed..

  If either of the two Amiga game tie-ins are made, it will be this one
 first, and hopefully it will be around in time for the launch of Space
 Mystic, so that players can use it as a source of background information.
