 Playing Costs

  Now is a great time to start playing in the sense that, for the moment
 at least, playing Insignia Of Terror is FREE.. Yup, FREE. Doesn't cost
 anything at all over Email/Netmail. Unfortunatly it can't stay this way
 forever, and after a few months of research I intend to start charging
 players. Don't worry, it will be a very acceptable and competative price,
 especially when compared to other PBM game costs.

  It's true, I dream an impossible dream, living off a home grown RPG 
 system. I realise it's unlikely, and probably impossible, but I'd really 
 like to be proven wrong on this!
