  It was cold and dark in the catacombs. People who went down there often
 didn't come back, and the broken corpses of the young and inexperienced
 were found quite regularly by patrols. Some say that the town was cursed,
 while others blamed the Council. But there's just no putting off some
 people....

@node "The" "About The Guide"


  In this guide you will find all the information needed to start playing
 in the Email/Netmail based game 'Insignia of Terror', which is GM'd by
 myself, the author of both Arcane Lore and Mystic systems. This guide does
 NOT contain the information required for you to run your own campaign, or
 create your own Mystic RPG based game. If after reading this you do want
 to use the GM's rules, there is a section later that informs you of the
 various options available.

  This guide should be understandable for even a complete beginner to
 RPGing, and I hope this doesn't put off any of the veterans out there.
 I've done this to make the game as user friendly as possible, as when it
 comes down to it, the point of any game is to be entertained. Pages of
 jargon aren't entertaining to the average potential player.

  So, as this is the play by netmail/email starter pack for Insignia Of
 Terror, it contains all the info you need to get your character(s) up and
 running in the game world. It covers all the procedures you need to go
 through to pick your character's race and class, and informs you how the
 mechanics of this remotely refereed game work.

  As you read you'll learn it's not as complicated as it first seems. And
 if you've never role-played before I'll make you into an expert in no
 time. Oh, and another point I think I should make. Don't panic! This
 guide may appear very bulky, but you only really need to read some of it.
 I'll leave it up to you to decide how much you're going to read, because
 what you should read depends entirely on what type of character you want
 to play.


@endnode

@node "WhRPG" "What IS an RPG?"


  An important question, that needs to be answered. An RPG or Role-
 Playing Game is essentially a game in which the player or players
 have to act, or play out the part of a pre-created character. In a
 traditional RPG this means trying to think your character's way out
 of situations, and acting as your character to communicate with Non
 Player Characters (NPCs). NPCs are controlled by the Games Master
 (GM), as is everything else in the game world excluding the Player
 Characters (PCs), who are controlled by the players as said above.
 No real definition of RPG exists, and it's meaning is extremely
 debatable. Some would argue that an RPG must have at least two
 players, although many single player 'RPG' books and computer games
 exist.


@endnode

@node "ImAb" "Important Words & Abbreviations"


  To avoid confusion in the early stages I have listed all the very common
 abbreviations and game words that you will come across in this guide:

 Arcane Lore: A detailed RPG system that I run only as a standard paper
     (AL)     based system.

 Mystic: Basic Arcane Lore, the system used in Insignia Of Terror.

 Insignia Of Terror: The name of the game you are about to take place in.
        (IOT)        As said above, the Mystic rules system is used.

 GM: The Games Master, or referee.. In Mystic he/she is called simply
     'The Master'.

 PC: No, not the computer (thank ye lords!) but a Player Character. This
     is what you'll be controlling one of when you start playing IOT.

 NPC: Non-Player Character. These are controlled by the GM, in this case
      me.

 Test: When a random number is used to decide the result of an action in
       the game.. As a general rule tests are decided by dice rolls.


@endnode

@node "Game" "About Mystic RPG"


  I started writing Mystic in mid 1996. I needed an easy and fun system
 that worked alongside my other, more complex system, Arcane Lore. I had
 to make sure I included all the correct information and rules. Making a
 good, simple system is much harder than making a good complex one.

  The following is a short history of the Arcane Lore system:

   1992-93: Old form of Arcane Lore paper based system created,
            whole idea behind project being it had to be VERY simple.
      1993: Reconsidered design, started adding detailed rules, as the
            rules were very restrictive.
      1994: Completely redesigned the mechanics, to allow the extra rules
            without slowing the system down. It was now a complex system.
      1995: Gave it the name Arcane Lore, and found no need to change the
            game mechanics. It seemed to work very well now.
      1996: Opened up the play by Email version of Insignia Of Terror to
            playtesters. This proved successful. Development began on
            Mystic, a basic version of AL that would be more suitable
            for combat oriented games, and Insignia Of Terror.
      1997: Development of Mystic completed, relaunch of Insignia Of
            Terror to old playtesters and new players. Now IOT uses
            Mystic's rules exclusively.

  Designing Mystic has not been as difficult as I had expected. Actually
 the process has been quite enjoyable. The system is basically a cross
 between the very first version of Arcane Lore, and a simplified version
 of the most up-to-date one. Looking back at work I did that long ago
 made me realise how far the system has come since then. The first
 version was weird to say the least, and although the ideas were simple,
 the methods used for usual things like character generation were very
 obscure!

 So now we have the two systems:

  Mystic: for IOT and paper based campaigns where masses of rules aren't
 important.

  Arcane Lore: For paper based campaigns where detail is a factor. I will
 not GM IOT under Arcane Lore rules as it is a complex system, and would
 take up a lot more time to GM and play than needed.


@endnode

@node "IOT" "About Insignia Of Terror"


  Insignia of Terror was an idea I had, soon after I started out in the
 world of comms. I realised that there was such a vast gap to fill where
 RPG gaming was concerned, and I had already designed the perfect system
 for it! I quickly adapted the advanced Arcane Lore system to work over
 netmail on a local network, and opened it for play by anyone there who
 wished to playtest it in those early stages. It worked excellently, with
 only one main problem. Because it used the hefty Arcane Lore system it
 took up masses of my time to GM. I had to stop and rethink my strategy.
 After a great deal of thought it occurred to me that if I designed a more
 basic system it would save a lot of my time, and be more fun to the
 general player. I set to work on the system now known as Mystic, and now
 it's complete I have altered Insignia Of Terror to use these rules.

  Why Insignia Of Terror? Well, there is an important reason for this
 name, but I won't go into it now. You should be able to work out the
 title after reading some of the world's background information.


@endnode

@node "Basics" "Basics of Insignia Of Terror"


  In Insignia Of Terror the main part of your gaming time is taken up by
 communication with both PCs and NPCs. It is not a combat frenzy, and all
 characters start their adventuring career in the same town, making party
 formation a lot easier.

  The game runs in the following way:

   1  You get this guide from me.
   2  You follow the character creation process detailed in this guide.
   3  You send your character details back to me.
   4  I finish the character generation.
   5  I send you the finished character profile, and your first turn sheet.
   6  You fill in the turn sheet, and send it back.
   7  I reply to your turn sheet.
   8  You reply to that.
   9  Repeat steps 7 and 8 until you stop playing.

  All these steps are explained fully in this guide.

  IOT is a completely open-ended game.. This means that there is no single
 'mission' you have to complete before the game ends. Think of it in
 this way.. Tharthaal, the town your character lives in is a real place,
 where real people live. When you die or stop playing, the world doesn't
 'stop'.. Neither does it end when you've achieved your goals. You
 basically 'are' a person in the fantasy world for an amount of time in
 their life. Perhaps difficult to grasp, but it's fairly simple once
 you've got the general idea. Also, IOT has complete freedom of movement.
 There is no set way you have to play, and virtually no restrictions on
 how you write your replies. So, in effect, you can write a message
 telling  me  you  want  your character to dance a jig then hit their head
 against the wall three times, and it would happen in the game.

  IMPORTANT: turns are calculated twice a week.

@node "Stats" "Statistics and their meanings"


  Statistics are numbers that show how good your character is in certain
 areas. When the character wants to do something difficult or unusual, a
 test is made against the respective statistic. For example, if the
 character had to hold up a collapsing corridor so that his friends could
 pass, a Strength roll would be made. I make all the rolls for IOT when
 GMing your turns. I don't think I'd believe your own rolls. :)


  Physical Statistics

  Appearance:  Your physical appearance and charisma rolled into one. A
 high value increases your chance of being able to persuade people to do
 things. A high appearance is extremely useful for attracting members of
 the opposite sex. Clothing can affect the total value.
  Appearance will be known as APP from now on.

  Combat: Your ability to handle yourself in a fight. Simply, if you have
 a very low Combat, you are very bad at combat. Strength is also used in
 combat, so it is possible to make up for what you lack in combat skills
 with sheer strength alone.
  Combat will be known as COM from now on.

  Dexterity: A character's skill at using his hands. This is used whenever
 the character tries to do something like pick-pocket or lock-pick. A very
 useful statistic for Rogues and Rangers, as throwing and archery are also
 tested using the character's dexterity.
  Dexterity will be known as DEX from now on.

  Speed: Your physical speed. This statistic is often used in combat to
 dodge the enemy's blow. It would be used if you were attempting to run
 away from something, and also decides who gets the first round in a fight.

  Strength: A character's physical strength. This also contains an element
 of mental strength. It is possible to have a very high Strength without
 being massively built up. Strength is used in combat, and to do things
 like pick up heavy objects, or knock down doors. The Maniac and Warrior
 classes should have a relatively high Strength, for obvious reasons.
  Strength will be known as STR from now on.

  Hit Points, or Health: Your character's life-force. When this runs
 out, as a general rule you die. If you're in a fight, and this starts
 getting low, try to escape and get medical attention. When wounded,
 blood-loss can cause a rapid decrease in Hit Points.
  Hit Points will be known as HPs from now on.

  Mental Statistics

  Intelligence: Your character's ability to work things out in their head.
 If we're going by stereotypes, Mages have an extremely high Intelligence,
 and Maniacs have very little. This statistic also accounts for your
 character's education, and it can be increased considerably as you learn.
 Intelligence tests are usually made when trying to learn spells.
  Intelligence will be known as INT from now on.

  Mystical Force: The strength of your psychic and mystical powers.
 Mystical Force tests are very rarely made. Instead, this statistic
 decides the power of any spells you successfully cast. The one obvious
 time a Mystical Force test is made is when a Priest makes a prayer.
  Mystical Force will be known as MF from now on.

  Observance: Simply how aware you are of details in your surroundings.
 Observance rolls are very common, and mostly occur when a PC walks into a
 new location. This is an important statistic if you're worried about
 surprise attacks. A test is also made when you search a room.
  Observance will be known as OBS from now on.

  Magic Points: How much magic or mystical power you have. Casting spells
 will eventually deplete your Magic Points. When this happens you can no
 longer perform magic until you have properly rested. Magic Point tests
 should probably never happen, as there is no obvious situation in which
 they could.
  Magic Points will be known as MPs from now on.

@node "Chrace" "Choosing a race"


  There are many intelligent humanoid races in IOT, some of which you
 can choose to control as a character. Each race has different statistics
 and abilities due to their racial background and culture.

  Choose wisely, as the only way you can change races is by dying, and
 rolling up a new character. Unless you survive so long that you end up
 old and decrepit or something.. I'd let you change then. :)

  The following applies though; Only Humans, Hill Dwarves, Elves and
 Dwarves are widely accepted as factual by the Human population of
 Tharthaal. In fact, many Humans don't even believe in Elves. You must
 always think about this when playing, as people are often afraid of the
 unknown.


  Here you can see 'the circle of the six civilised races', an
 illustration from an ancient study by a human scholar. It outlines the
 anatomy and homeland of each of the six major races:

@node "Human" "The Human race"


  The Humans.. A relatively young race that began it's evolution in the
 southern isles of Irall Rhin. The earliest known Human remains were
 found buried in the land surrounding the now mighty town of Vahrtaan.

  The Humans have built a strong empire in the south, where they are more
 common than the other races because of their shorter life-spans and quick
 breeding coupled with formidable force in numbers.

  The isles of Irall Rhin are not very safe though, and particularly in the
 south of Lyona, where Humans are thought to have originated from,
 barbarism is the norm. This has given Humans a rather bad reputation among
 other races who often think of them as a rather savage and 'pointless'
 race.. The equivalent of humanoid Goblins. Well, that's what many
 Dwarves think, as Humans aren't strong like a Dwarf, and they're pretty
 un-intelligent compared to Elves and the like. You can imagine what
 Dwarves think of Hill Dwarves..

  Never the less, Humans do have some advantages.. They are highly
 dexterous, and have speed and agility advantages over the stronger races.
 Granted, they aren't that intelligent in the scale of things, but they
 have a strong will, and are a lot more common than the other races in the
 South at least..

  Humans speak Common Tongue, and very rarely any other languages.

@node "Elf" "The Elven Race"


  The Elves are an ancient race of unknown origin. They generally live in
 the forest areas of Lyona, usually in small tribal groups. The Elves are a
 very peaceful race, and avoid conflict if at all possible. But, if
 attacked Elves are very able to defend themselves, especially on their own
 territory.

  Elves are one of the most agile of the humanoid races, but are not as
 physically strong as the Humans or Dwarves. Elves use their speed and
 intelligence to give them the edge over such races.

  The greatest number of Elven tribes are thought to exist in Baerille
 Woods, in the north east of Lyona. This is not certain though, as the
 Elves are very secretive, and would not allow any race other than
 Fairy-Folk to know the location of their villages.

  When an Elven adventurer walks among Humans, they are likely to try to
 hide the fact that they are Elven. The physical differences between Elves
 and Humans are very small, so this is not too difficult. Elves never have
 blonde hair or blue eyes, and are shorter than Humans. An Elf's ears grow
 pointed over the years, although this is only noticeable over the age of
 40 (elven years), so older Elves tend to wear hoods or hats in Human
 company. There are some Elves who are not so worried about being
 recognised. It really depends on the town's attitude toward outsiders.

  Elves speak Elven, and Forest Tongue, and most of the time can also
 speak Common Tongue.

@node "Dwarf" "The Dwarven race"


  The Dwarves are a race of short stocky humanoids who live in the highland
 areas of Irall Rhin. They are an extremely ancient race that can be traced
 back to times thousands of years before even Elven civilisation.

  Unlike the Elves, the Dwarves are not against combat. In fact, most
 Dwarves enjoy nothing better than a few beers followed by a quick brawl.
 They are heavily muscled and suited for combat, despite being quite slow.

  Dwarves have a strong sense of honour, and make great companions. It goes
 both ways though, and Dwarves also make formidable enemies. They are not a
 stupid race by any means, but rather cunning, often with a fierce temper
 and a rather warped sense of logic. It is advisable to stay on the right
 side of Dwarves, especially if there are a few of them present, as they
 stick together at all times despite their frequent arguments and brawls.

  The Dwarves tend to live either in mountain cities and keeps, or in
 underground tunnels dug initially for mining. It is said that they never
 used to live under the crags, but were forced down there during the first
 Goblin war. They were fighting the Goblins off from the centre of Lyona,
 just to the north of Tharthaal, while the Humans grew from the South,
 unaware of the Dwarves' existence. When the war was over and the Dwarves
 were about to expand back outwards they found Human settlers to the South
 and West, the Goblin homeland to the North, and Baerille wood to the East.
 Dwarves are not suited to life in the forest, so they were forced to stay
 in the mountains and live by mining. Now the Dwarves are thriving, but
 some are still angered at the Humans for 'stealing' what was once their
 land.

  Dwarves are a proud race, and would never try to hide their identity from
 the other races. They guard their possessions and land fanatically though,
 and are very suspicious of other races, especially the Elves. All problems
 they have with the Humans they can put down to the Humans being such a
 young and unknowing race (or just plain stupid), but the Elves to them
 seem very 'odd'. This is because of their shy and secretive behaviour more
 than anything else.

  Dwarves take great pride in their appearance, and attempt to look as
 formidable as they can. This leads to them wearing as much armour as
 possible, and growing long beards. They also tend to prefer as big a
 weapon as possible. Quite how a beard is supposed to make you look fierce
 is unknown, but nobody has ever asked about that. Well, not without
 getting a prompt smack in the face as an answer.

  Dwarves speak Dwarven, and a basic, strongly accented form of Common
 Tongue.

@node "HillDwarf" "The Hill Dwarves"


  The Hill Dwarves are a race that now live among the Humans in the towns
 of Irall Rhin. They also have their own towns in the hills and mountains
 of Lyona, but many have moved into the smaller Human towns for
 convenience and comfort.

  Nobody is quite certain where the Hill Dwarves originally came from, or
 what they really are. There are many theories put forward by the other
 races. One of these, believed by many Humans, is that the entire
 Hill Dwarven race is half Human - half Dwarf. Of course, Dwarves don't
 think much of this theory, and neither do a lot of Humans. Hill Dwarves
 have a bigger problem with the theory though, as they aren't that fond of
 Dwarves at all, in fact, apart from in appearance and name, Hill Dwarves
 and Dwarves couldn't be more different.

  Hill Dwarves, like Elves, try to avoid combat if at all possible, and
 never willingly put themselves into situations where they might have to
 fight. Instead, they tend to be good house keepers, and enjoy comfort a
 lot more than damp caves full of goblins. This is the main difference
 between the Dwarves and Hill Dwarves.

  It is thought that the only real physical differences between the two
 races are the Hill Dwarves' weaker build, and inability to grow beards.
 The latter point is completely untrue, as Hill Dwarves are able to grow
 beards quite easily, they just don't want to be mistaken for Dwarves, as
 being mistaken for a Dwarf can result in a lot of fighting, and Hill
 Dwarves don't like that sort of thing.

  Hill Dwarves speak Common Tongue, but often learn other languages.

@node "Fairy" "The Fairy-Folk"


  The Fairies of Irall-Rhin are possibly the oldest of all races in the
 world. This has been established by historians who have studied ancient
 Dwarf history, and discovered that the Dwarven people used trained Fairies
 as lanterns for their mining expeditions. It is said in the Dwarven
 manuscript of Kruq-Lynn:

 "From the great woods we found them, in their great town. Small and weak
 they are, but in a great village in the trees. Many of them there were
 there, fly they did! Magic creatures we thought! I told Mhakar these
 things are good! We talk to their leader called Reobil, and he says 'many
 welcome friend! Mine you have? We give light-guides, you give gold! And so
 many mining therafter became easy!"

  Apart from proving that the Fairies existed during the Dwarves early
 days, this out-take also gives insight into how well educated most
 Dwarves are.

  Fairies are by far the most magical of the major races, and all have
 strong magic powers. They are also extremely fast, and can fly! Also, at
 a few inches in height, they are near impossible to hit with normal
 weaponry. Generally dreadful at combat, a Fairy can't cause much damage
 to a target, regardless of the effort used.

  Fairies are the most beautiful of the major races too, and are generally
 very good at persuading people to do things, whether they would want to
 do them or not.

  The Fairies live in forests, usually in very dense areas with lots of
 places for them to hide. They don't like to be seen, only Elves, and
 some Gnomes know the locations of their hideouts. In these dense areas
 often thousands of Fairies live together in close communities.

  Fairies' magical traits also expand to their senses, as they can
 understand anything said by any of the major races using a hybrid Sixth
 Sense ability.. They are also taught how to cast mantra magic from birth,
 as well as how to use the magical powers of nature..

  Fairies don't dislike any of the major races, but find the Dwarves and
 Gnomes quite amusing. Fairies can be quite mischievous too, but never
 intend to do harm, unless their target has evil intent. A lot of young
 Fairies get bored of the life offered to them by their villages, and
 leave to adventure. As Fairies are so weak, they often end up dead. So
 many in fact, that in the last few centuries Fairies have begun to build
 up small armies of soldiers to keep their children from getting
 slaughtered by the first hostile creatures they meet..

  Fairies speak their own language, Forest Tongue, and Common Tongue, and
 can also understand anything said by any of the major races.

@node "Gnome" "The Gnomes"


  Although the Gnomes are quite common in forest areas, very little is
 known of them. They tend to keep to themselves, and don't communicate
 with the other races much at all.

  Nothing is known of the Gnome race's origin. They live alongside the
 Fairies, but try their best to keep out of their way. Gnomes are 
 extremely unsociable creatures, but are very hardy. There is no other
 race as earthly as the Gnomes.

  Gnomes live quiet lives, maintaining independence by farming and
 hunting. They do not live in communities like the Fairies, but move away
 from their families as soon as they are old enough to support themselves,
 and set up their own homes.

  Gnomes are thought by the other races to be extremely grumpy and bad
 tempered, and to some degree this is true. They can also be quite
 violent, but this is most often caused by a stranger trespassing on their
 land. Gnomes are a very territorial people, and fight passionately for
 their possessions.

  Gnomes don't approve of religion. They respect everything around them,
 and worship it all. They do not understand the need for a 'deity of trees'
 when they could just worship the trees in the first place. They have
 reasonable psychic and magical potential, but very few practise the art.

  The most common reasons for Gnomes to start adventuring are to find
 the perfect home-place for themselves, find a mate, or get revenge on
 anyone who damages their land or possessions or hurts their
 relatives. Gnomes do not stand for any disrespect to their family.

  All Gnomes need to find their own home when they are young. This is one
 of the two tests of a Gnomes life. It is seen as a sign of stupidity by
 other Gnomes if one has to move house again after picking his homestead.
 The name the Gnomes give to those who leave their originally picked home
 is 'Groebi!', which roughly translated means 'home leaver'. The reason
 that moving house is looked on so badly by them isn't known, but it can
 lead to Gnomes spending a good fifty years or more finding the perfect
 land. Punishment for moving is usually being rejected by the Gnome's
 family, and although the Gnomes may not often see their family, this is
 extremely degrading to them.

  These same rules apply to finding a mate.. All Gnomes leave their homes
 temporarily to find a suitable mate. To protect their land while they do
 this they often leave trained animals and small traps. Again, once a
 mate has been found, there is no chance of 'divorce' without becoming
 outcast from the family. This is usually the only real time a Gnome
 leaves his home for any longer than a hunting trip. He spends a lot of
 time preparing himself, his land and his possessions for the search,
 which can also take many years. When you are less than a foot tall, and
 a single Gnome's territory spreads over just a few meters, finding any
 Gnome can by hard, and finding a willing mate is near impossible. The
 couple then move into the 'superior' of the two homes, and the families
 are joined. They then become just as protective about their new family
 members.

  Gnomes speak Gnomish and Forest Tongue.

@node "Chprof" "Choosing a profession"


  Your character's profession determines their abilities. It greatly
 influences how your character must be role-played, and is a basic
 description of their favoured area of learning or adventuring expertise.
 Each profession also starts off with it's own trappings, amount of
 wealth, and choice of weaponry.

 IMPORTANT: You should pick a class from the following sections, and also
 write exactly what you want to be. This is to make your character more
 complex. After all, 'Fighter' doesn't mean much, but 'Town Guard' does.

  Again, choose wisely. Changing your profession is possible once you have
 begun playing. This is not advised, as it means you have to gain a lot of
 experience in the relevant areas, and risk putting yourself in difficult
 situations. For example, a Mage wishing to become a Warrior would need to
 get into a lot of hand to hand combat before he could fight very well,
 and this can be very dangerous.

  The Maniac group represents the less 'civilised' type of warrior. The
 class name makes them sound mad, which is somewhat misleading. Often they
 are, but generally this isn't the case. The title Maniac is just to
 emphasize their great strength and rage while in combat.

  Barbarians and Berserkers fit in this class.

 Maniacs, as well as being more quick-witted.

  Guards, Fighters and the like belong to this class.

 who kills villagers for a laugh would also make you an outlaw, but you'd
 be classed as a Maniac then. Alright, so the Rogues are outlaws who's
 primary illegal activity isn't hand to hand combat.

  There is one major rule that must be adhered to when thinking up your

 network, or even your real name.

  Apart from that, there are no real rules. Just avoid making it too
 silly. After all, the atmosphere of the event can be seriously damaged
 when you find out that the fearsome, blood-caked werewolf is called 'Bob

@endnode

@node "Chlig" "Character's Alignment"


  IOT uses a very basic alignment system for players, allowing you to
 choose from good, evil, neutral or secret. NPCs and monsters have a wider
 variety of alignment options. It is important that players use their
 alignment to effect their character's behaviour. These alignments help me
 to moderate the game, as they are a solid point of reference, but if
 players do not wish to be confined by an alignment they can pick the
 'secret' option. Neutral alignment is always the simplest choice, and
 probably a good idea for a first character. This is why alignment can be
 restrictive, as 'good' in most systems means that your character has to
 behave in a certain accepted way, usually a 'moral' way. The problem with
 this is, who exactly decides what is morally correct? It's usually the
 game's authors who impose their values upon the game. I will try not
 to do this. Often someone we may think of as 'evil' thinks they are
 doing the 'right' thing, so, in their eyes they are 'good'. It's a very
 difficult area indeed. The other method is to have some sort of galactic
 scale of alignment, and this is what most systems use. Unfortunately this
 nearly always means you get a moral code that mirrors that of the society
 the authors live in. Basically, in my honest opinion, Alignment systems
 suck. IOT is lenient in it's alignment rules, and uses a mixture of the
 'galactic scale' and 'motivation' methods. Finally your alignment is not
 a ball and chain that limits your lines of actions, it is merely a
 guide-line to add direction to your role-playing.

@node "Chplusses" "Rolling for statistics"


  As the GM it is my job to generate your statistics. This is done
 using random numbers, and you can be assured that I never cheat to make
 characters either good or bad. Basically, without going into much detail
 (if you want to know these things you'll have to buy the GM rules) each
 race has different averages for each statistic, and each character group
 has a value that is added to those.

  Obviously it's nowhere near that simple, but I'm not revealing all the
 secrets to players. After some playing you may be able to work it out
 anyway.

@node "Chwealth" "Defining your character's wealth"


  All Character classes start with a random amount of gold pieces, the base
 amount of money for that particular race is added to another roll defined

 a lot more gold, and would start off extremely rich.

  Before you try looking it up, there is no 'Dwarf goldsmith' class. :)

  This is also part of my job as GM. There is a standard adventurer's set

 character groups. These are added together to give you all the correct
 trappings for your trade. Also, if you pick an obscure spin-off trade in
 your character group (Witch-Hunter from Priest for example) you will
 receive new trappings picked by myself (torturing equipment in the

 All details on these beliefs are in the @{"Religion" link "religion"} section.

  A note about religions in IOT: This is one of the areas in which
 Insignia Of Terror is most detailed. As a player, if you choose to play
 a religious character you must try your hardest to play with the views
 and biases of that religion. If you choose to disobey your religion's
 laws or principles you should be prepared to face some sort of
 consequences. Many Priests obey their gods because they believe that if
 not, they will be punished. Take this into account when adventuring and

@node "BOP" "Basics Of Play"


  The following is an example of a turn sequence. I would say it's
 typical, but there are no typical turns in Insignia Of Terror!

  So, this is something like what I'll send you on your first turn:

 ----------------------------------------------------------


  You are in the town square of the town Tharthaal, largest town on this
 side of the mountains. The weather is fine and sunny. This town seems
 very strange to you after your up-bringing in the forest. The buildings
 here are large and made of stone; you don't feel very welcome. As you
 look toward the huge stone fountain in the centre of the square you
 notice two large men towering over a beggar; they look as though they're
 demanding money.

 People:

  A tall cloaked figure carrying a two-handed sword. He is about 6 feet
 tall. He is pestering a beggar.
  A strong looking man wearing only a loin-cloth and a very silly helmet.
 He is carrying a battle axe. He is also pestering the beggar.
  A battered looking beggar with a long white beard. He looks very
 dismayed.

 Places:

  Armoury
  Weapon Seller
  Blacksmith's
  General Store
  Arena
  Town Guard
  The Butchered Boar Inn
  The Two-Headed Chicken Inn
  The Dragon Tavern
  The Fighter's Guild
  Town Gates

 ----------------------------------------------------------

  Notice there are no set options for you. IOT doesn't work like that.
 It's unlikely that you'll ever see anything like:

  Do you wish to go east into the cave?
  Or do you want to wait here and see?

  This is because IOT tries to be as much like a TRUE RPG as possible. In
 a real RPG, the GM doesn't give you the choices, he informs you of the
 situation. For all I know, you want to light a fire in the eastern cave
 entrance, and do a rain dance. IOT lets you do that, or anything else if
 you so desire.

  Also note that your turns may not be set out like this. There is a
 standard turn sheet, which would be hard to fit in this space.

 ----------------------------------------------------------

  Now, the following shows a possible reply to that turn. You'd send this
 as a reply to my original message in your mail program. You should leave
 the following parts of my message intact as quotes: people list,
 anything relevant to your reply.

 ----------------------------------------------------------

 I'll walk up to the cloaked man. I draw my weapon and:
 *SHOUT "Leave that man alone, or pay the consequences!"
 If they continue or are physically hostile towards me:
 *ENGAGE 20,0
 If I kill them, I will talk to the beggar:
 *SAY "You alright?"

 MD> A battered looking beggar with a long white beard. He looks very

 ----------------------------------------------------------

  Obviously this is a bit of a suicidal thing to do, but it gives you an
 idea of how it works.

  There is no need to write your reply solely at the bottom of the text.
 If you find it easier to interrupt my text with actions, that's fine.
 Whatever is easiest for you. In large turns this is unavoidable anyway.

  Don't panic! The *Engage will be explained later. I'll simplify it,
 and tell you that anything following a '*' prefix is a 'command'. These
 are the things you do a lot, but require special rules.

  Note that MD> stands for Mike Dawes, me! I might use a different RPG
 related name to write your turns though. Don't worry about that yet.

  Notice that the people list is still there. This is ESSENTIAL.

  After your turns, you can comment, or have a running conversation with
 me about the RPG by dividing the text off with a line of, errm.. wobbly
 things. Hmm. These: ~~~ :)

 ----------------------------------------------------------

  Now, I think you get the idea. But I'll show you my reply to that, just
 to make sure. Here it is:

 ----------------------------------------------------------


 PL> I'll walk up to the cloaked man. I draw my weapon and shout: "Leave
 PL> that man alone, or pay the consequences!"

 The man laughs: "What consequences? Surely you're not challenging me?!"
 He draws his weapon: "Now you'll pay!"
 He signals to his friend to put his weapon away, and engages you!

 You get the first attack.
 You hit him for 30 hp on his R.Arm.
 He misses you.
 You hit him for 45 hp on his head. He is unconscious.
 The warrior readies his weapon, and charges at you shouting: You'll pay
 for that, hellspawn!!"
 He gets the first attack.
 You dodge his first blow.
 You kill him after a while.

 (That combat was extremely simplified)

 You turn back towards the fountain and the old man has gone!

 ----------------------------------------------------------

  In that turn PL> is just short for player.

  Oh, I'd also like to comment that the turn sequence was overly clichéd
 and cheesy. The game does have humorous moments, but generally it's a
 dark, moody and atmospheric game.

  And that's basically how it runs throughout. If you're having any
 trouble absorbing all this information, don't worry. I am here to help,
 and will answer any genuine questions.

@node "LOP" "Laws Of Play"


  This section lists the things a player must do, and NOT do when playing
 the game. Some of them you may find peculiar, but I insist on them:

  Punishable offences: I'd like to say that I will not ban you from the
 game, or anything like that, unless you do something REALLY bad.
 Punishments work within the game whenever possible. There is a standard
 one, but I will not tell you what it is. Hopefully fear of the unknown
 will stop you from acting stupidly.


  1) NEVER delete any of your turns. You may need to look back on them
     later, and it's easier than taking notes.

  2) ALWAYS remember to update your profile. If your copy is wrong, you
     may do things that you wouldn't do if you knew. I always update your
     profiles at my end, and will tell you when you need to change it.

  3) ACCEPT that the GM's word is final.

   * Persistently questioning the GM's judgement: Not that serious an
     offence, but If you go about it the wrong way things may be seen
     differently.

  4) DO NOT attack other PCs or NPCs without good reason. First time this
     happens you will get away with it. Second time you will get a
     warning. Note that if you state from the start that you intend to
     play as an Evil/Chaotic character, this will be normal behaviour,
     and not only accepted by myself, but encouraged.

   * Unreasonable, out of character assaults on PCs or NPCs: Powerful
     NPCs, and quite a few PCs notice this sort of activity, and you
     probably don't want to become a fugitive.

  5) NEVER use out of place modern language. I can sort it out afterwards
     when relaying the text to others, but I'd rather not. Swearing is
     allowed, but only where necessary. I don't expect barbarians to
     shout 'Oh dear!' when they're being eaten by a dragon. Use your own
     judgement on this.

  6) ALWAYS remember to use the command lines. Now, things like *SAY and
     *ENGAGE are compulsory. You HAVE to use these codes.

  7) ALWAYS use first person when writing your turns. You can't say 'my
     barbarian looks around the corner'. Instead you must say 'I look
     around the corner.'

  8) NEVER reveal your characters name or whereabouts to any other
     players. You aren't allowed to tell other players where you've been,
     or anything of substance about any characters or locations. If you
     want to tell someone something, tell a character it in the game.

   * Giving out information about your character, other PCs, NPCs or
     places: PLEASE only speak about the game world while in the game!
     You can seriously damage the game by giving out information. If I
     know you have done this, I will give you a warning.

  9) REMEMBER to ASK me if you don't know what something does. Don't use
     command lines that you don't understand! It makes things very
     difficult to moderate afterwards..

 10) ROLE-PLAY as well as you can! If you're a Priest, for god's sake act
     and talk like a Priest. Alignment is important too. Although you
     don't have to stick strongly to this, it is there as a guideline for
     you're actions. A lawful, good Elven Priest does NOT go around
     murdering people! I'll always comment when I think you've acted
     strangely. I won't stop you from acting like this, that's up to you.
      Actually, I'll use this chance to say I put Alignment in the system
     for reference purposes, and to speed up moderation of the game. I
     don't really agree with alignment in normal RPing, that's why I gave
     players the 'secret' Alignment option.

 11) And finally, an obvious, but extremely important law: DO NOT delete
     or lose this document! (it's been done more than once before)

@node "COM" "Communication between PCs and NPCs"


  The most important part of any RPG is communication. This is the area
 which tests the player's role-playing skills to the limit. It is very easy
 to implement communication in your turns. You would go about it in the
 following ways:


 *SAY [target] "communication"

  So.. For example: *SAY Elf "Well met traveller!"

  If you don't specify a target then it will be said to all those within
 hearing distance. This is useful for talking to your party.

 *SHOUT [target] "communication"

  As *SAY, but louder. :)

 *WHISPER [target] "communication"

  As *SAY, but so quiet that it is very unlikely that anyone other than
 the target will hear what is said.

 *SIGNAL [target] ["action"]

  eg: *SIGNAL Elf "Nod head"

 *ASK (Preset question number) [target]

  To make the game run faster, and to make character interaction easier I
 have added preset questions & answers. You have to fill in your
 character's answers to each of the questions when you're creating your
 adventurer. As all the players and NPCs have a file full of these
 answers, very quick communications can be made by using this command.
 Note that if you wish to change any of your preset questions and answers,
 you can send altered versions of the communication lines during your
 turn, preferably in the format of the original sheet. It is recommended
 that you only use the *ASK command on NPCs and PCs who you don't know
 well, as they are perfect for finding out their details, but are quite 
 useless for real conversation.


  Please note that the *SAY, and other codes are compulsory now. It may
 confuse at first, but all you need to know most of the time is the normal
 speech method. *ASK can be used to seriously speed up and improve the
 game too.

  There is one important thing you need to know about communication in IOT.
 You can only speak or interact with characters in your current location,
 BUT: Sometimes a player who is slightly behind you in game time will
 communicate with you once you've moved. When this happens, you can
 reply. This is ALL you can do though, and if you wish to continue the
 conversation you must go back and find them.


@endnode

@node "CCOM" "Character Commands"


  If you had to write vast descriptions every time you wanted your
 character to perform a common task, you'd probably get bored quite
 quickly. Also, having no structure to the turns at all makes it hard to
 GM properly. So, to make it easier for both players and GM, I created
 Character Commands. You've already seen the communication ones. Here is a
 list of the commands for other actions:


 *MOVE (location name)

  Simply moves your character from one location to another. This is just
 as necessary as the other commands, and cuts down on the amount you have
 to write as a player. If you don't know the exact name of the target
 location you can insert anything that explains where you want to go. For
 example; *MOVE North, or *MOVE Upstairs.


 *ENGAGE [Target] [Min HPs,Enemy HPs]

  Min HPs: Minimum amount of HPs your character has before running
           away. So if this is set to 10, you'll run away once you have 10
           or less hit points left. For normal fights I'd use about 20%
           of your total HPs in here.

  Enemy HPs: How many HPs the target has left when you stop fighting them.
             Be careful not to have too small a value if you're not trying
             to kill the character, as it is quite common to hurt someone
             more than you've intended, and possibly kill them.

 eg: *ENGAGE Elf 10,0

  An Engage command without the combat details (10,0 etc.) is counted as a
 fight to the death. This is a very important thing to remember. :)


 *EXAMINE (Target)

  This causes your character to look at a specified item, place or entity.
 You have to put the target name in, or it won't know what to describe.


 *USE (Item1) [on Item2]

  Item1: The object that you wish to use.

  Item2: The object you want to use it on. This isn't essential, as for
         example, if you type 'use potion' it'll assume you want to drink
         the potion.


 *SPEECH See 'Communication'


 *CAST (Spell) [Target] (see Magic)


 *PRAY (The Prayer)


 *HOSTILITY [Level]

  Level: 1=Never attacks or defends (Unless you tell them to)
         2=Defends
         3=Attacks as self-defence (Until enemy is neutralised)
         4=Attacks enemies on sight (Kills enemy)
         5=Attacks enemies and anyone/thing that gets in their way.
           (Neutralises PC/NPCs and kills enemies)

  When generating your character you will be asked what hostility level
 you wish to start on. You can change your hostility at any stage in the
 game. This is a very useful feature, and should always be considered
 when venturing into new territory.


 *INVENTORY

  Simply orders a list of all the objects your character is carrying. It
 will be sent to you when your turn is processed.


@endnode

@node "COMB" "Combat"


  Combat is very simple from the player's point of view. IOT is not a
 combat based system, but violence is often unavoidable. Sometimes you may
 even want to get into fights, and if this is in character then I
 encourage it.

  First you should know that in any fight your best weapon, or chosen
 weapon is automatically armed.

  When your character gets into a fight, you will be sent a description of
 the events that took place. This shows exactly what is happening in the
 combat, without many confusing dice rolls or mathematics. You may get
 some combat statistics but generally I keep these to myself, as to a
 player they aren't vastly important.

  If you really want to see the workings of the combat as it goes on,
 there is a option when rolling up that lets you see the system working on
 both combat and magic.

  Another important note on combat is this: Combat involving one PC is
 resolved in a SINGLE turn, whereas combat involving more than one PC can
 take multiple turns to complete. Because combat against NPCs can happen
 so quickly, you may well lose your life in a single turn. The best way to
 avoid this is to make sure you leave a reasonable amount of Hit Points in
 your engage command. This vastly increases your chances of survival and
 possible escape if things don't go your way in the fight.


@endnode

@node "MAGI" "Magic"


  Magic is an area of IOT that had to go through a lot of changes since
 it's first incarnation in Arcane Lore. The magic system now used is one
 that leaves most of the work up to the player instead of the GM, allowing
 extra flexibility. Suffice to say, I do not recommend using a magic user
 as your first character, unless you are prepared to get well versed in the
 rules.

  There are now THREE types of magic, and they are as follows:


  Symbolic: Symbolic magic is based around a series of magic runes,
            symbols, sounds and codes. Learning the use of these symbols
            allows the caster to release their powers. By mixing the
            symbols a wise magic user can create their own spells.

   Psychic: Psychic magic comes from the caster's mind. Those who
            practice it believe there is vast power held in the mind,
            which, when properly trained can be unleached with tremendous
            force.

    Prayer: This sort of magic relies on a god's power instead of the
            caster's. Prayer is just as powerful as the other magic types,
            but most of the time is much less reliable. Gods don't answer
            a character's prayers unless they have good reason to.


  When you roll up your character, if you pick Mage you will have to
 decide on whether your character practices Symbolic magic or Psychic
 magic predominantly. Symbolic magic is certainly more commonly used by
 wizards and the like. Priests automatically practice Prayer magic over
 the other types.

  Before I can decide what magic your new character knows you must choose
 which type of spell they are most likely to know. There are five
 categories: Offensive, Defensive, Elemental, Spiritual and Earthly. The
 first three should be quite obvious as to their functions, but the others
 need more description. Spiritual magic is magic involving the spirit
 plains, so could be used in clairvoyance, necromancy, or anything else
 that includes entities from other plains. Earthly magic is magic that
 can't be related to any of these groups. Examples of earthly magic are
 love potions and spells, communication spells, and any other mostly
 non-harmful spells that effect things or beings in the physical world
 rather than other states of existence.

  When you get you character profile you will see what magic words, runes
 or ingredients you have learnt before you started adventuring. These
 only apply to the Mage class, as Prayer magic is cast in an entirely
 different way.


  Casting Symbolic Magic:

  Each word, rune or symbol has its own magical attributes, and can be
 arranged in a chain with other words. So, if you were given the words
 Summon, Beast and Fire, you could use them for many different things,
 from summoning and commanding beasts, to lighting fires. If you wanted
 to summon up some sort of fiery beast, you could do the following:

 *CAST Summon, Fire, Beast

  If you are successful with the spell, something should appear. If you
 have a high mystical force, the effectiveness of any spell is increased.
 This is especially noticeable in offensive magic, as a spell of high MF
 can devastate the enemy.

  Runic magic and magic involving ingredients work in much the same way
 as word magic. What sets them apart is this: in Runic magic, the spells
 cannot be spoken, but must be written or cast with rune-stones. This
 makes runic magic a bad choice in combat. Magic that needs ingredients
 is also not instantaneous, and must be prepared beforehand. Obviously
 using ingredient based magic can increase a spells lifetime, as you
 could keep the resulting magical substance in a container, preserving it
 for later use. Having prepared spells could help in combat, as you may
 want to reserve as much of your magical energy as possible.

  If you wanted to cast Ingredient magic, you'd do something like this,
 but with the right ingredients.

  *CAST Ragweed, Rat's brain

  To cast a rune spell, you use the same *CAST command as for word magic,
 but make sure you only use runes, and not words in these spells, as they
 are not interchangeable. You can't use runic symbols in Word magic, or
 Words in Runic Magic.

  Summary: Word magic MUST be spoken.
           Ingredient magic takes a long time to prepare, but you can make
            long lasting magical potions with it.
           Rune magic MUST be written, or cast with stones, and the spell
            takes effect at that point.


  Casting Prayer Magic:

  Prayer magic allows the priest to ask a god a question, and on
 succeeding a Mystical Force roll the God will answer. The god will also
 do it's best to perform requests in the same way. Prayer magic is very
 rarely successful, but once a priest becomes experienced their god may
 notice them, and reward him more frequently.

  To pray, all the character needs to do is speak the words, or if in a
 place where he can concentrate, think them. This could be a request or
 question. The *PREY command must always be used. Praying is a good way to
 keep in contact with your god, and a priest should pray in his free time.
 Generally, Priests should make prayers of thanks to their gods, just to
 keep the gods on their side. If you get to be a really high level priest,
 and have a suitable god, you may even get results from prayers such as
 this:

  *PRAY Please, give me the strength to destroy this enemy!

  Prayer will not deplete your magic points, but there are reasons why you
 can't just keep retrying a prayer if it fails. Most of all, gods can get
 very aggravated by their loyal followers keep asking them to do things.
 If they don't reply, or do what you request first time, it usually means
 they don't want to, not that they didn't hear you. Priests don't want to
 pester or beg their gods, as an angered god can be dangerous.


  Other Notes:

  Casting spells depletes your Magic Points. You regain some of these
 magic points every time you sleep.

  You can only attempt to learn a spell once every moon cycle, and if you
 fail, can retry 30 days or more after the failed attempt.

  Experience points will be awarded to your character when they achieve
 something noteworthy. This could be by defeating a powerful foe,
 finding an item, or persuading an NPC to do something they wouldn't
 normally want to do. Note that if you often kill goblins, killing more
 isn't going to gain you Experience unless they're particularly nasty
 goblins, or if they greatly overpower you.

  When you get a set amount of Experience points, one of your statistics
 will increase. This will always be the one you used most to gain the

@endnode

@node "HTPA-Human" "How to play as a... HUMAN!"


 Role-playing:

  No special rules apply to role-playing Humans. As you know from
 experience, Humans are all very different in personality. The main
 rule is that you play consistently. It's no use being a really kind
 priest one minute, who helps old crones across the road, and then turning
 around and slaughtering thousands of children. Not usually, at least.

  The Human race's society is very sexist toward women. Considered by a
 lot of men as weak, women are forced to do housework and other such
 things. Most Human religious groups are not like this toward women,
 causing a disproportionate number of Human female priestesses.


 Rules:

  No special rules apply to the Human race.


@endnode

@node "HTPA-Elf" "How to play as an... ELF!"


 Role-playing:

  Never provoke a fight, or attack anything unless you have very good
 reason to. For example, in self defence, or defending a loved one. Play
 secretively, and try not to reveal details about you or your race to
 anyone other than your own kind or the other forest dwellers. Elves are
 dreamers, and perfectionists, and will occasionally lose sight of reality
 when pursuing their goals.

  Female Elves are VERY rare. It is thought that there could be as many as
 10 male Elves to every one female. Because of this the females are very
 highly regarded and respected throughout Elven community.


 Rules:

  Elves can see well in the dark, and have very good hearing.


@endnode

@node "HTPA-Dwarf" "How to play as a... DWARF!"


 Role-playing:

  The average Dwarf likes a good fight, and drinks a lot of beer. It is
 not necessary to play in this fashion though. If you do opt for a
 stereotypical Dwarf, then you must put a lot of effort into role-playing.
 After all, soberly trying to RP a drunken combat-hungry Dwarf is not
 easy. I'm not recommending that you get drunk before filling in your
 turns by the way ;) As a Dwarf you are suspicious of the other races,
 especially the Elves. Play honourably toward your civilised acquaintances,
 but treat Goblins and the like as vermin, ready to be stamped out. If
 someone opposes you, you should challenge them to a fight. If they
 challenge you, it is usually out-of-character to deny the challenger the
 combat.

  Dwarven males work in the mines as much as the male ones do, and fight
 alongside the males in battle.


 Rules:

  Because of their underground lives, Dwarves can see extremely well in
 the darkness. Their eyes have adapted to the dark, and now Dwarves find
 it uncomfortable to move around in sunlight. They are greatly hindered in
 combat if they are in bright light.


@endnode

@node "HTPA-HillDwarf" "How to play as a... Hill Dwarf!"


 Role-playing:

  The Hill Dwarves are a friendly race who always see the good side of any
 situation. Remember this, as it's extremely useful for frustrating other
 party members, especially Gnomes, who see things in the exact opposite
 way. Hill Dwarves are very forgiving, and are quite talkative. Try to avoid
 combat when at all possible. Also, never go anywhere unless absolutely
 prepared for anything that could possibly go wrong.

  Male and female Hill Dwarves are equal in their society.


 Rules:

  No special rules apply to Hill Dwarves.


@endnode

@node "HTPA-Fairy" "How to play as a... FAIRY!"


 Role-playing:

  Play Fairies mysteriously. Try to keep out of sight of other races, and
 act mischievously toward them, especially the Humans. Communicate with
 those that you like the look of, and act innocently, almost as if you
 aren't very intelligent. All Fairies act like this among the other
 races, making the other races think of them as quite childish. Fairies
 don't act like this amongst themselves. Use your charm on members of the
 opposite sex, but try not to reveal your magical powers to other races.

  Female Fairies are vastly more common than male ones, and are higher
 than male Fairies in their own society. Female Fairies are slightly
 weaker than the male equivalent, but as they are so small, the difference
 is virtually unnoticeable. A male Fairy is no more likely to hurt you in
 a fight, at least.


 Rules:

  Fairies are the most magical, and non-human of all the player races, and
 thus require quite a few extra rules.

  All Fairies start off with an amount of non-hostile spells. These are
 unlikely to be rune or ingredient based. Around 6 is the norm.

  Fairies get two attacks in combat (this is taken into account when
 combat is calculated)

  Fairies can't carry much because of their size.

  Fairies can understand all of the major races' speech, using a hybrid
 sixth sense ability.

  Also Fairies are extremely empathic, and can tell what an entity is
 feeling with great ease.

  They can see perfectly in both day and night, but have average hearing.


@endnode

@node "HTPA-Gnome" "How to play as a... GNOME!"


 Role-playing:

  Role-play Gnomes in a grumpy fashion. Argue with other characters, even
 just for the sheer hell of it. This also applies to stronger people than
 yourself. Gnomes will argue with anyone or anything, and don't really
 think of the consequences. Moan a lot, and always blame the other party
 members if anything goes wrong. Be indecisive, and once you've made your
 mind up, never budge on it. Question everything, and trust no-one. Be
 cunning, and if anyone pays any disrespect to you, your possessions, or
 your family, then plot your revenge secretly. Avoid other people when
 possible, regardless of their race, and only talk to ones you really like,
 or have to speak to.

  Males and females are equal in Gnome society.

 Rules:

  No real special rules apply to the Gnome. They don't have night vision,
 and prefer the daytime.

 Role-playing:

  No guidelines for this group, except a reminder that, although you are
 basically a barbarian, there is no reason why you can't be a very
 intelligent barbarian. You can play as a huge muscle-bound moron if you
 really want to, but it's not forced upon you.


 Rules:

  The only special rule for Maniacs is the BERSERK rule. When in combat, a
 roll is made which determines how angry you are. If you are really mad,
 then you go berserk, and get less defence, but a much greater attack
 value. This is sometimes decided without dice, for example, if a Dwarf
 maniac gets into a fight with a group of Goblins who've just killed his
 best friend, he's automatically pretty angry. :)

 combination of magic words doesn't do what you expected in combat, you

  The one rule to follow when playing a Priest is: remember your religion!
 If you remember this at all times, it should make role-playing the

 Rules:

  Priests start off with an inbuilt 'spell' that depletes their MPs, but
 never fails to work. In most cases this is a healing ability, but it
 depends on what your deity stands for. Apart from that, the only magic a
 priest starts off with is prayer magic. Priests can learn other spells
 of any type, but if this is not normal or allowed by their religion, they
 may not be accepted as a priest of that order. Even worse, their deity
 could stop supporting them. If this happens the priest would lose his
 inbuilt 'spell'. It is thought that some of the gods like to punish
 Priests who haven't gone by their rules.

@node "IRAL" "The Realm of Irall Rhin"


  The realm of Irall Rhin is a series of isles located in northern
 Hyalmarin. The largest of these islands is Lyona. The home of many
 races, Lyona is a very varied place. The other minor isles of Irall Rhin
 have much smaller humanoid settlement. The races that have evolved on
 Lyona rarely venture any farther than the isles on the border of Irall
 Rhin.

  Pictures: @{" Old map of central Lyona " system "multiview bank/midlyonmap"}


 Time in Irall Rhin:

  There are a few things players must take into account, especially when
 embarking on long journeys.. Time in the RPG world is different to that
 in the real one.. These are the main differences:

  There are eight days in a week.

  Each day is 24 hours long.

  The weekdays are called:

     Monday - Fotyn-raa
    Tuesday - Jaandy
  Wednesday - Trobensdy
   Thursday - Ioldimaar
     Friday - Barsdy
   Saturday - Heldenbrot
     Sunday - Worsdy
      Extra - Mardy

  There are 344 days in each year...

  There are 43 weeks in a year.

  There are no months as such, but there are moon cycles of 30 days.

  The year is divided into three seasons, these are:

     Balarhtak - Hot (Summer)
       Veartak - Medium (Autumn & Spring)
    Rhikaantak - Cold (Winter)

  So, instead of months, you get '4th moon of Balarhtak" and similar.


 Monetary systems of Irall Rhin:

  The universally accepted currency in Irall Rhin is that of gold, silver
 and copper pieces. These are referred to as 'thrones' by the humans,
 Dwarves and Hill Dwarves. Other races are less concerned with such
 material things, but would collect any riches they found for later use.
 In such a primitive world it is also important to remember that trading
 with goods was just as common as trading with gold.

@node "IRAL-PEOPLE" "Important People of Irall Rhin"


  Irall Rhin is a colourful, and extremely varied place. The main humanoid
 races all have a strong presence, especially on the mainland.

 Human influences:

  King Ailbur II: Once a great king, Ailbur is now seen as a reasonable,
 but weak leader. Ailbur was in power at the time of a great war against
 the undead army of Hokharn, a powerful necromancer. It was during
 this war that Ailbur was forced to endorse the new system of power, put
 forward by one of his knights, Reikan of Yelm. This system basically
 shifted all true power of government to the lords and knights of a
 council. This system is massively corrupt, but was necessary to unite
 the separate lords' armies in the war against the undead. This system is
 still in operation and rumour is that if the king was to break the
 treaty, he would quickly find himself dead at the hands of one of his
 knights. Ailbur's palace lies it Jetsie, in far western Lyona.

  The Grand Inquisitor: A strange, old man who leads the Order of Nuln.
 The Order is a very unforgiving cult that looks down on other religions,
 claiming that theirs is the only true god. Nuln is gradually becoming the
 most widespread religion in Lyona, mostly through propaganda and force.
 The Grand Inquisitor heads all of this, and is not worshipped, but
 followed by his millions of fellow believers. Hailed as the lord's chosen
 one, nobody questions him, as although he is a weak man, he has control of
 vast armies of witch-hunters, and fighting priests. He lives in the great
 temple of Nuln in Bogaar, central west Lyona.

  Baron Tracht: King Ailbur made Lothan Tracht a baron after his great
 effort as a Knight in the battle against Hokharn's army. Tracht seemed to
 actually scare off two combat groups of 'zombies', something that was
 thought impossible. What makes this even more amazing is Tracht's
 fighters only suffered very minor casualties. Now Tracht is seen as a
 strong leader, whose interests unfortunately are not the best for the town
 he governs over. The Baron lives in, and is responsible for Tharthaal,
 the great town in central Lyona. Unfortunatly he'd much rather be off
 fighting battles with his many enemies, and neglects the town, leaving
 most of the work to his advisor, Tyan-haarin.

  Catherine of Lakeside: Catherine is followed by a great number of people
 throughout Lyona. Allegedly the daughter of the late king Markhath, she
 has used this fact, and her great charisma, to gain great respect.
 Climbing the system of government until she was given a city to rule, she
 was determined to do as much as she could to damage the Council and the
 order of Nuln which has such a great presence in it.
  King Ailbur gave her Lakeside, a town that was unhealthily near to
 Baerille woods. It was thought at the time that an Elven attack from the
 forests was about to happen, as the Elven forces were still angered by the
 Human conquest of Lakeside hundreds of years ago. Catherine broke off all
 ties to the King and Council, and installed in a new council at Lakeside.
 She does not rule over Lakeside, that position went to her Elven friend
 Sara Hytell. What made Catherine such an influence in Lyona was her
 attitude toward the new system of rule and the Order of Nuln. The
 Lakeside council doesn't even allow Nuln Priests within the town gates.

 Elven Influences:

  Sara Hytell: A childhood friend of Catherine, Sara is a respected
 leader. With Catherine and her allies' assistance they were able to
 restore peace to Lakeside, and banish any possibility of Elven attack
 from Baerille woods. A lot of Humans don't believe she's an Elf at all,
 and most who do show great prejudice toward her and her people. All the
 same she has an excellent, if short, record of leadership over Lakeside,
 and is loved by her townspeople as the only person to make both resident
 Humans and nearby elven people co-operate peacefully..

 Other Races:

 Although other races have massive influence in Irall Rhin, for the
 purposes of this guide, no more information can be disclosed. From a
 Human perspective, these are the people your character has probably heard
 of. Other races have important leaders, and the Elves have more important
 influences than those listed above, but as the game is stationed in a
 Human town, and most of the characters are to be Human, I can only give
 out information relevant to them.

@node "IRAL-POWER" "Important Powers of Irall Rhin"


 Human Powers:

  The Order Of Nuln: The followers of this religion are widespread, but
 are almost certainly all Human. Nuln is very unaccepting of anything that
 does not fit within their guidelines. The Order has a complex hierarchy,
 and supports ideas like Humans are the greater race, and all
 non-believers are automatically evil. The Order has a massive foothold in
 the political matters of Irall Rhin, as well as having temples in all
 major Human towns. Possibly the most feared of all people in urban Lyona
 are the Inquisitors, Warrior-Priests, and 'Witch-Hunters' of Nuln. The
 Order has it's greatest presence in southern and central Lyona,
 especially in the towns of Tharthaal, Vahrtaan and Bogaar. Throughout
 Irall Rhin there is a massively varied view of Nuln. In Tharthaal they
 are feared and respected in equal measure, as whenever the town guard
 fails, the inquisition always has well trained militia ready. In the
 coastal town Vahrtaan, Nuln is generally welcomed, as their inquisitors do
 a good job of keeping crime down, where before there was gang rule, and
 merciless vigilante justice. In Bogaar, where the great temple of Nuln
 is situated, the Order is loved greatly by the townspeople, who follow
 their leader fanatically. The Order's activity in this city is
 phenomenal, they virtually run the city independently of King Ailbur, or
 Reikan's council. Needless to say, the people of Lakeside are adamantly
 against the Order of Nuln.

  Reakan's Council: The Council consists of one representative for each
 of the towns of Lyona. Each of these representatives must remain on site
 in that town permanently while they hold their position in the Council,
 and if titled correctly are entirely responsible for all elements of that
 town's wellbeing. The system would work well if it was not for the fact
 that most of the lords, knights and barons of the realm did not gain
 their titles through any act of their own, but through their breeding.
 This said, the towns with decent and strong leadership often can do well,
 especially if allowed to prosper away from the Order of Nuln.

  The King's Militia: One of the remnants of the old rule, the militia
 are now considerably weaker than in King Ailbur's greater days. The only
 major town in Lyona to retain it's militia is Tharthaal. In Bogaar and
 Vartaan the Order of Nuln have their own armies. In Tharthaal the role of
 the militia is not a certain one either, and heated, sometimes violent
 arguments go on between the Nuln and kings troops. The fact that the
 town also has a strong independent town guard confuses matters even more.

  Town Guards: The baron or knight appointed rule of a town has choices to
 make regarding how the law will operate in that town. If the town
 already has a long-standing town guard, it would be hard to dismantle, as
 there is no longer a strong militia to transfer the guards into to
 prevent massive unemployment. This is a problem that Baron Tracht faced
 when he took rule over Tharthaal. Eventually he decided to keep the
 town's independent guard, and also to keep it's militia as a sign of
 regard to the king. The Tharthaal guard is very well regarded in other
 towns, but their reputation is changing as they cooperate with the Order
 of Nuln in their investigations. The Tharthaal town guard has a leader
 in Sarbuk-Yan, who keeps in close contact with Baron Tracht's advisor
 Tyan-haarin.

  The Nester People: Little is known about these people. All that is known
 is that they are Human, and do not swear alliance to any of the southern
 Human powers. Only quite recently discovered, the Nester People have
 responded quite aggressively to the explorers of the south, and some
 minor battles have broken out. The Nester people live on the north side
 of Lyona.

@node "IRAL-PLACE" "Important places of Irall Rhin"


  All of the important places to the Humans of Irall Rhin are on the Lyona
 mainland.. Here are some of the most important cities, towns, and
 landmarks. (only locations that are widely known of by the general Human
 population of Tharthaal)

 Towns and Cities:

  Tharthaal: One of the largest towns in Lyona, Tharthaal has a complex
 history, and is located in the centre of the isle, at the base of the
 Kelber mountians. See the Tharthaal section for more details.

  Bogaar: The birthplace of the Order of Nuln, Bogaar is a cold and
 religious city. It is located in the central west of Lyona, next to
 Goblin Mire; a source of great problems before Nuln. There is a legend
 that 'Goblins' had a settlement on the Bogaar site, and that Humans burnt
 it to the ground, killing many of their women and children. Nobody's sure
 where this legend comes from, or whether it is complete fabrication.

  Vahrtaan: Once a great coastal town, it is now a port of rest for all the
 pirates and smugglers of the surrounding seas. Vahrtaan is on the
 southern coast of Lyona, on the borders of the Great Waste. Humans of the
 far south are generally a primitive, and possibly barbaric people, making
 it a dangerous place to visit. Nuln has used this fact, and their
 superior knowledge of magic and technology to gain a foothold in Vahrtaan.
 Inquisitors and Fighter-Priests patrol the streets at night, trying to
 'keep the peace', but truthfully, they have little more power in Vahrtaan
 than some of the unlawful gangs there.

  Jetsie: In it's former glory, Jetsie was an amazing city. It was built
 hundreds of years ago by the very best Human workers available. King
 Ailbur II makes use of the palace there now. But his land is the only
 part of Jetsie that is well preserved, as almost all industry has moved
 to Bogaar and Tharthaal, leaving only food producers. The king is said
 to be very distressed about the state of Jetsie, as what it once
 represented is now being forgotten. Jetsie is in the far west of Lyona,
 north of Grey Forest.

  Lakeside: Once an 'Elven' town, Lakeside is a massive and powerful
 independent city. It is located at the base of Baerille Woods, relatively
 near to the town of Tharthaal. The name Lakeside comes from the fact that
 the city lies on the west coast of Lake Herimon, the largest mass of
 water in Lyona. See sections on SARA HYTELL and CATHERINE OF LAKESIDE
 for more information.

 Territories:

  Goblin Mire: Between Tharthaal and Bogaar lies this giant patch of
 swampland. The road between these two cities cuts straight through the
 mire, and is greatly feared by travellers. Many people have lost their
 lives in this hellish place, either by ambush, or simply getting lost in
 the foggy marshes. The Order of Nuln have been the only Humans to
 attempt to map out and conquer the swampland, but even they had to give
 up due to massive losses of both money and men. Those stupid enough to
 travel along the Bogaar-Tharthaal path tend not to go alone, but
 sometimes this is necessary. Many messager-boys are said to have gone
 missing along this road.

  Kelber Mountains: The range of rocky crags to the north of Tharthaal.
 These mountains are said to be virtually impassable, so very few except
 the most courageous adventurers even try. There are legends of Dwarven
 settlements in these isolated, shadowy lands, but nobody can confirm this.

  Baerille Woods: A place that is feared and avoided by the Humans. A lot
 of Humans think of it as an amazing, magical place, romanticising about
 it in their literature and the such, but very few Humans dare enter the
 place. Never ending forests in all directions, with areas of little or no
 sunlight, surrounded by many unknown and possibly hostile creatures, the
 Humans leave this land to those who already live there..

 Special locations:

  When the repetitiveness of normal town life gets to young people, they
 often wander off looking for more interesting pastimes. Sometimes they
 take the path of the adventurer, walking from place to place, solving
 people's problems. Otherwise, it is not uncommon that a young, or
 possibly older towns-person would take some time out to see some of the
 landmarks of Lyona. There are some places that everyone wants to see once
 in their life, but for most this is not practical. A note to all players
 though.. As you're playing in a pretty primitive society, your character
 would be awe-struck by most of these amazing places.. Here is a list of
 some of the locations of interest.

  The King's Palace: Although not as highly respected as previous kings
 were under the old system, people still like to see Ailbur's home, as
 this truly is outstanding building in all respects.

  Lakeside: If travellers can get in at all, this is supposed to be a
 place of quite amazing beauty. The young and innocent are especially
 likely to come to this place, as are couples who do not wish to marry
 under the laws of Nuln.

  The Great Wall of Lakeside: A landmark in it's own right, nobody is
 quite sure who made the Great Wall, how, or why it was built there. The
 wall is a gigantic stone structure, shielding the west side of Lakeside
 from the Kelber Mountains. The wall is ancient, and of great interest to
 historians and architects, while the view from on the wall over Lakeside
 and Lake Herimon attracts many lovers, poets and artists.

@node "Religion" "The major religions of Irall Rhin"


  If starting off as a priest, it is necessary that you pick a religious
 order to follow. There are many different religions in Irall-rhin, some
 are obscure, with small followings, while others, like the Order of Nuln
 have a huge following throughout the entire of Lyona. Here is a list of
 all the religions you could worship. Some of the religions are not
 covered in much detail, as most people aren't supposed to know about the
 less popular religions and cults.


  Human religions:

  Major religious groups:


  The Order of Nuln: Easily the widest-spread of the Human religions, the
 Order of Nuln has a complex structure and disciplinary code. Nuln
 Priests preach justice, judgement and punishment.

   Beliefs: The Order of Nuln believes in a single god, who has no real
  name, but is referred to as 'The Creator', or 'The Lord' by some
  followers. They believe this single deity to be the creator of
  everything that exists, including the other gods if they exist at all.
  To the Order of Nuln, anyone who worships any other god is seen as
  incorrect, and probably evil. Fortunately though, only in Bogaar,
  Vahrtaan and the wilderness do they have enough power to charge people
  for worshipping other deities. Nuln is even more strongly against
  witchcraft, and the mystic arts, especially when practised by
  non-religious citizens. According to the Book of Nuln, the creator is
  sleeping until a day when he will awaken once again, and take power of
  the land once more. In the mean time, it is up to his followers to
  maintain the laws of Nuln, and keep the people on the right path,
  preparing them for the day of dawning. He who does not believe will be
  judged, and he who worships a false god will be cast into eternal
  anguish in the pits of hell. So, Nuln's believers move around Lyona,
  'converting' people to their faith by both spoken and violent means.
   For obvious reasons, quite a lot of people disagree with Nuln's methods.
  Nuln is the only Human religion that regards the others as false. The
  Order of Nuln have a 'leader' in the Grand Inquisitor, otherwise known
  as the Supreme Mage. He is regarded by the Order as the 'chosen one'.
   It is written in the second Book of Nuln that 'he who defeats the
  demon's child will guide the flock through bad times, until the day of
  rebirth'. The 'demon's child' was apparently lord Hokharn, the man
  responsible for a recent war, and who the Grand Inquisitor killed in
  armed combat in that very battle.

   Structure: The Order of Nuln have at least one place of worship in
  each of the major Human towns of Lyona (except for Lakeside). The
  priests of the Order have a complex hierachy, with symbolic broaches and
  uniforms showing what position they hold in the Order. Most of the
  marking are secret, with only Nuln members knowing their meaning, but a
  few are commonly recognised, like the scythe of Nuln, worn by all
  members, and the mark of the hunter, worn by inquisition forces. Females
  are accepted as members, and generally get treated the same as the males
  by other Nuln members.

   Picture: @{" The scythe of Nuln " system "multiview bank/SOnuln"}


  The Fellowship of Realzear: The goddess of truth and justice has a
 strong following throughout Lyona. This following is also quite strictly
 structured, and is made up mostly of normal townspeople.

    Beliefs: The followers of Realzear believe, but not exclusively, in
  the principals of truth and justice, upheld by their deity Realzear, as
  outlined in the fellowship's ancient scriptures. They also believe in
  the other gods, apart from Nuln's interpretation of the 'Creator'. The
  follower's call is to uphold the law as well as possible, without giving
  in to judgement or bias. Only priests, or higher ranking followers are
  supposed to judge others, while the lesser supporters are encouraged to
  work within the system to bring judgement to offenders, using
  by-the-book means. There is a great tension between Realzear followers
  and the Order of Nuln, as their beliefs overlap, and contradict each
  other. When at all possible, Realzear's people try to keep out of the
  way of Nuln. The followers of Realzear strongly believe that if they
  follow her, and are good of heart and mind, if challenged, they should
  always win, as she favours the righteous.

   Structure: There are no temples built for the worship of Realzear.
  Instead, there are numerous statues and small monuments dedicated to
  her. Statuettes of her can be found on a lot of buildings, and there is
  usually at least one in a court, prison, or other place related to law.
  There are Priests and bishops of Realzear, but they have no form of
  leader, or high ranking Priest. Women can become Priests or bishops,
  and generally aren't looked down on by other members.

   Picture: @{" Realzear, goddess of law " system "multiview bank/Realzere"}


  Worshippers of Balarh: Balarh is the sun, and is worshipped strongly in
 the south of Irall Rhin in particular. This is an unorganised religious
 group, who's priests are strictly self-declared, and which has no
 temples, or recognised places of worship. Members of this group meet up
 in natural surroundings to worship the sun, giver of life. Although
 Balarh has such a large amount of followers, they haven't really spread
 north as far as central Lyona. They have no special beliefs, or
 structure, and are equally generous toward women as men, if not more so.
 Followers of Balarh worship life, and are extremely unlikely to take a
 life without very good reason indeed.


 Minor religious groups:


  The Order of Solos: Solos only has one major temple, which is located in
 Tharthaal. Apart from that it has a small temple in Lakeside. Despite
 this, Solos has quite a large following. See 'Important places in
 Tharthaal: The temple of stars' for more details on this religion.

  Picture: @{" The mark of Solos " system "multiview bank/Solos"}


  Rievere: Rievere, goddess of nature, has a steady following among the
 Humans. She is one of the old gods, who has complementary statues and
 monuments built in her honour across Lyona, especially in the northern
 Human territories. Rievere is also worshipped by the forest folk of
 Baerille woods, like the Elves and Fairies.

  Picture: @{" Rievere fountain in Tharthaal " system "multiview bank/Rievere"}


  Roelon: The god of war, weapons and battle, also has a steady
 following. This god is especially popular among the militia, for obvious
 reasons. There are old statues of him all over civilised Lyona.

  Picture: @{" Ancient stain illustration of Roelon " system "multiview bank/Roelon"}


  The Conclave of Krobaal: Krobaal is the deity of murder and foul play.
 It's unknown whether Krobaal has a strong following, but he's one of
 the old gods, and such is believed to exist by all groups apart from the
 Order of Nuln.


  Ilyana: Inyana is the Humans' sex goddess. She is also one of the old
 gods, and has statuettes built throughout Lyona, especially in the South,
 where she is said to have quite a large following. The followers of
 Ilyana are also quite secretive, and don't reveal information to
 non-members.


  Gelder: Gelder is the god of luck and good harvests, and has some
 following, especially in western Lyona.


  Grym: Grym is the goddess of darkness, who has a following of unknown
 size. Like the followers of Krobaal, they are very secretive, so very few
 details can be given.

  Picture: @{" Gyrm, goddess of Darkness " system "multiview bank/Grym"}


  Khastahn: Otherwise known simply as death, is said to have some
 followers and priests.


  B'hahkin: The god of chaos. Extremely obscure. Very little is known
 about the god himself, let alone his followers.


  Petriosa: The goddess of water and love has a reasonable following
 throughout Lyona.


  Tarimai: God of Life, animals, and drink. Has followers around Lyona,
 especially in the south.


 Elven religions:

  The elves were worshipping their gods before the Human race was even
 discovered. Many of the Elven, and other forest folk's gods are followed
 by Humans too. Elven civilisation doesn't generally have such things as
 temples, or other built places of worship, with the exception of some
 in the town of Lakeside.

 Aleria: Goddess of music and the dance.

 Rievere: Goddess of nature.

 Realzear: Goddess of law.

 Petriosa: Goddess of water and love.

 Tarimai: God of life, animals, and drink.

 Balarh: The sun.

 Iella: Goddess of fertility.


 Dwarven religions:

  Although not the most religious of races, the Dwarves are a very
 honourable people, with a complex culture. The gods they do have they
 respect equally, and serve to the best of their ability. Dwarves have
 built temples and shrines to all of their deities, most often underground
 or in their isolated mountain towns.

 Bar'ym-Or: An ancient hero, who has place in Dwarven legend. He
  apparently led vast armies through various battles, wielding his magic
  axe Treal-am-ra. Suffice to say, he's been dead a long time.

 Tortaal: The Dwarven god of beer and ale is equally popular. There are
  no records of any Tortaal priests.

 Godril: The god of wealth and good fortune.

 Waryll: Dwarven god of battle.

 Py-karah: God of the mountains.


 Hill Dwarf religions:

  The Hill Dwarves have few religions, but often follow them fanatically.
 Like the Elves, they don't build temples, or other places of worship.

  Borbun: God of food and friendship.

  Realzear: Goddess of law.

  Gerti: Hill Dwarf goddess of fertility

  Pelper: Hill Dwarf god of wisdom and learning.


 Fairy religions:

  Although Fairies are the most magical of all races, their range of
 religious beliefs is very limited. Fairies believe solely in the ways of
 the forest, and worship the gods that supply them, and their surroundings
 with life and prosperity. Fairies never build places of worship.

  Rievere: Goddess of nature.

  Iella: Goddess of fertility


 Gnome religion:

  Gnomes do not subscribe to single religious beliefs. They don't really
 see the point in gods, and haven't created any of their own. A lot of
 Gnomes dismiss the whole idea as rubbish, while others are more open
 minded but still don't worship any of them.


@endnode

@node "THAR" "The City of Tharthaal"


  The city of Tharthaal is magnificent, or at least most of it is. Set on
 the side of a great mountain, this city has gained much of it's growth
 through mining and industry. Tharthaal is seen by most as a sort of
 middle-ground where all the different colours of Lyona meet. This is
 quite close to the truth, as Tharthaal has the most central position of
 all of the greater cities, and is not too near to the grasp of Nuln for
 them to affect it in the way it has Bogaar and Vahrtaan. This has
 allowed it to grow quite quickly, and accumulate the largest number of
 combat ready troops in any town. Tharthaal is the only city apart from
 Jetsie that retains it's king's troops, and it also has a very active
 town guard.

  Picture: @{" Tharthaal town gates " system "multiview bank/Thargates"}

  Tharthaal has a very complex history, most of which is unknown to the
 general populace, here is a list of facts about the town's well known,
 and recent history, as well as other information that characters would
 know before embarking on there journeys.

  Baron Tracht rules over Tharthaal quite fairly, but spends a lot of his
 time fighting in minor battles with the Nester People of North West
 Lyona.

  Tyan-haarin, the Baron's advisor is left in charge of the town in the
 baron's absence.

  Tharthaal is allegedly built upon ancient mines of unknown origin.
 The tunnels are only ever ventured into by foolhardy adventurers.

  Not long ago it is said that a plague of Goblin fog-riders struck the
 town in the dead of night. Whatever they were, the situation was critical
 enough for all of the towns troops to be summoned.

  The attackers got about half way through the town, and burnt down
 a considerable amount of houses on the southern side, before they were
 stopped by Nuln inquisitors.

  The mountain on which Tharthaal is built is named Kelber Mountain. It is
 the first mountain seen when coming from the South, marking the beginning
 of the uncharted realms, and the land of the Nester People.

  Baron Tracht has been cooperating with the king's construction workers
 on the Northern section of Tharthaal for around a year and a half. Over
 this time, the section has been closed off to townspeople, with a strong
 guard presence around the entire section.

  The Northern section was intended to be a place of great beauty, for
 people of Lyona to look to, and be proud of. It was expressively wished
 by the king that everyone should be free to enter this great place.

  Baron Tracht quickly opened the Northern wing of Tharthaal shortly after
 the recent attack. Apparently this was to help hide the fact that
 Tharthaal had suffered great losses in the skirmish and had not come out
 well at all considering the amount of troops sent out to intercept the
 attackers.

  The townspeople are generally not happy about the Northern section, as
 only the richest of merchants and nobility can afford to accommodate
 themselves there.

  The New-Tharthaal sewer is the first Human attempt at a true sewer
 system. Cut out from the mountain stone, this system is extremely
 efficient, spilling water out of the sides of the mountain.

  The Order of Nuln paid a huge amount to build a second great temple in
 the northern part of Tharthaal. This temple is to be smaller than the
 Grand inquisitor's current one, but will be used as a second home,
 hopefully increasing the Order's power in Tharthaal and the neighbouring
 area.

  The Nuln presence in the northern section of Tharthaal is tremendous,
 fuelling beliefs that Nuln intend to make Tharthaal their next city.

  Most townspeople are very distressed at the idea of more Nuln men in
 Tharthaal, and many small businesses have shut down, moving to Lakeside,
 to avoid the inevitable.

  Tharthaal is the most varied town in all of Lyona, with a wide range of
 cultural and religious communities. The difficult thing now will be for
 the town to preserve this.


@endnode

@node "THAR-PEOPLE" "Important people of Tharthaal"


  Baron Tracht: The nobleman effectively in charge of Tharthaal, and
 responsible for it's welfare. He is quite highly regarded by most, and is
 seen as a truthful and just master.

  Tyan-haarin: The Baron's advisor, an old, weak looking man. He has a
 peculiar whining voice, and looks rather skeletal. Tyan-haarin is not
 liked at all, and even hated by some townspeople, especially those with
 children, as he has been known to terrify small children while walking
 around town with his bodyguards.

  Arch-Bishop Musach: Nuln's most important priest in Tharthaal, he is an
 aged man, probably in his 60s, who wears black robes, and has a short
 white beard. Musach is extremely highly regarded in the Order of Nuln for
 unknown reasons, but to the townspeople he is seen as very demanding.
 It seems everything must always be to Musach's liking. As he monitors
 the work of his fellow inquisitors, he decides on the actions to be taken
 on special cases, especially involving witchcraft, and reports back to the
 Grand Inquisitor. There are a LOT of people in Tharthaal who adamantly
 HATE Musach because of what he has done to their families. This is
 common because, when a family member is executed, the friends and family
 will always blame the person who made the initial decision.

  Sotan-bar: High Priest of the relatively new religion of Solos. He takes
 charge of the Temple of the Stars in South East Tharthaal. Not much is
 actually known about him, or his Priests, but they have not caused any
 trouble, and the only people who seem to seriously dislike them are Nuln
 followers.


@endnode

@node "THAR-PLACE" "Important places in Tharthaal"


 Territories:

  Central Tharthaal: The central area of Tharthaal is walled off, and
 contains buildings like the baron's keep and most of the town guard
 buildings. This area is heavily guarded by both militia and town guards.

  Northern Tharthaal: This section takes up about a quarter of Tharthaal's
 current area. Only recently built, this part has very little in terms of
 industry, and is mainly full of accommodation for the wealthy, and
 temples. Only the wealthiest nobles could afford to build here, so Nuln
 have quite a large presence, and a great temple in construction. Three
 of the constructions put there by the king's workers are a primitive zoo,
 a museum, and a second 'King's College' (the first was built in Jetsie).
 These locations were originally supposed to be accessible to all
 townspeople, but it didn't turn out that way and the nobles of the North
 have employed guards to keep the poorer people of the south out. Most of
 Northern Tharthaal is set on a steep mountainside, as Tharthaal has
 already taken up all the flat land on the side of Kelber Mountain.
 Northern Tharthaal also has a primitive, but effective sewer system.
  Northern Tharthaal is generally referred to as New-Tharthaal.

  Southern Tharthaal: The largest area of the town, southern Tharthaal is
 a very varied place, with influences from all sides of Lyona. The south
 contains a lot of places of religious relevance, and a lot of pubs and
 taverns. As Tharthaal is so central to Lyona, it is a very common place
 for people to take rest on their travels. The southern side is also full
 of small patches of farmland, amongst other things.

  South East Tharthaal: A very poor area, where the houses are simple mud
 huts and similar structures. Nobody really patrols this area either, so
 crime is extremely common here. There is already a massive divide between
 the people of this area, and the rest of Tharthaal, so it's not hard to
 imagine what most of these people think of the new northern section.

 Places of religious interest:

  Shrine of Roelon: The shrine of Roelon, god of war is located by
 Tharthaal's main gates, on the south western side. Set on top of a raised
 marble pedestal, this statue is about the height of 3 men.

  Shrine of Rievere: Rievere, goddess of nature has a statue and fountain
 in the South East of Tharthaal. It is located just south of the poor
 land, and is always watched over by Rievere priestesses, to avoid the
 possibility of vandalism to their sacred worship place.

  Temple of the Stars: A great temple constructed within the last century
 by followers of the relatively new, but quite strongly followed religion
 of Solos. Solos is a very strange religion, in effect it's an anti-belief
 system. Followers of Solos basically believe that humanity knows very
 little, or nothing, and that worship should not be limited to a select god
 or power. Instead, Solos worships everything simultaneously. Because of
 these beliefs they are quite understanding of everyone, and don't dismiss
 anything as impossible, making them probably the least offensive religious
 group in the entire of Lyona. This temple is also located in the South
 East, above the poor-land, but is not strongly guarded.

  Shrine of Realzear: The goddess of truth and justice has a statue in
 North East Tharthaal. The statue is about the same size as the Shrine of
 Roelon. It is located next to the Nuln 'temple' for Southern Tharthaal.

  Inquisition HQ: A small Nuln temple, which houses around 40 Nuln troops,
 Priests and Inquisitors. It is extremely heavily guarded, and it is no
 coincidence that it was built next to the shrine of Realzear.

  The Second temple of Nuln: A vast and imposing building, made from black
 marble, cut from the mountains to the north by armies of Nuln workers.
 Slightly smaller than the temple in Bogaar, it is still the largest
 building of any sort in the entire of Tharthaal. Construction on the site
 should be completed within a few months, and Nuln Priests and followers
 are already using the temple. The temple is extremely heavily guarded,
 with around eight fighter priests at it's door at any one time.

 Places of interest to travellers:

  The Sword & Skull Tavern: A busy tavern, with rooms for any travellers
 and a common room. In central southern Tharthaal, this is the tavern that
 characters are likely to find first. Within the town it has a reputation
 as the place that adventurers get their drinks. It can be a very noisy
 place, and on some occasions quite violent, but is has it's regulars, and
 the staff try to be as helpful as possible to travellers.

  The Town Square: As in all towns, there is no better place to find
 bargains than at the town market. There are a selection of stalls that
 are set out here every day, and more that are set out on Worsdy and
 Mardy (equivalent of sunday, and the extra 8th day).

  The Arena: A large arena for gladiatorial combat. It is also used
 for public executions and tortures. It is located in the central south
 west of Tharthaal, near the Sword and Skull Tavern, and the town square.

  Shops and taverns: There are many shops and taverns throughout
 Tharthaal. Consult the map for the location of some of the more popular
 ones.

  The King's College: Those of good breeding, or considerable wealth may
 wish to enrol into the King's College. It runs courses in the sciences
 and some old languages. It is located in New-Tharthaal.

  The King's Museum: An interesting place to anyone who has an interest in
 the history of Lyona, this building contains many ancient artefacts.

  The King's Zoo: As with the other two king's buildings, most of the
 things on show here have been transported here from his older, now
 virtually unused versions back in Jetsie. There is quite a range of
 strange species here. A note about the king's buildings; you are unlikely
 to be able to get into New-Tharthaal without looking the part, or
 sneaking in past Nuln troops.

  North Park: A woodland gardened area that has been constructed in
 New-Tharthaal. Used a lot by lovers and people walking their pets.


  Picture: @{" The Town Map (south only) " system "multiview bank/Southmap"}
 The south Tharthaal map is produced by the town store, and is sold at the
 town gates by one of their workers. Every traveller would purchase one of
 these as they are extremely cheap, and very helpful.


  Finally here is a list of all the location names you know of when you
 start in the game. These names are used with the *MOVE command to move
 around. Note that you don't have to be too exact in your location names,
 this is just for reference. There are many other locations that are not
 on this list, and to travel to these locations you would need to use
 the *MOVE command more masterfully.

@node "Law" "The Law in Tharthaal"


  The laws in Tharthaal are extremely archaic, but most are quite logical.
 For example, it is illegal to steal another's property, or murder people.
  Here is a list of some of the laws that a character is likely to come
 across. Sentences are decided by someone, but quite who depends on the
 seriousness of the offence.

  Murder: If you are caught whilst in the process of murdering someone,
 you can be punished there and then by death, or imprisoned for public
 execution. If you are witnessed murdering, or there is sufficient
 evidence to link you to a murder, you will be put on trial by the town's
 court.

  Fighting: If you are found fighting in the streets, you may be
 imprisoned for a short time and fined. Fighting indoors is NOT necessarily
 illegal, even in some public places, as the owners of the location decide
 whether or not the law will apply to their land.

  Being drunken and disorderly: If caught drunk while on the streets you
 can be imprisoned temporarily or possibly fined.

  Rape: Rape cases with significant evidence are always taken to court.
 The victim is extremely unlikely to win though.

  Acting suspiciously: If a town guard thinks he has good reason to stop
 you for acting suspiciously, he will question you and if the
 answers are not satisfactory, you can be fined or imprisoned for a short
 time.

  Insulting a guard: you can be imprisoned or fined for insulting a
 member of the town guard whilst they are on duty.

  Assaulting a guard: If you attack or retaliate against a town guard
 whilst he is on duty, it can be punished with a long period in prison, or
 execution depending on exactly who you attack, and how you do it.

  Vagrancy: Anyone found sleeping on the streets can be fined. If they can
 not pay the fine, they can be imprisoned.

  Consistently offending: If a single person is convicted of 5 or more
 crimes, he can be given long term imprisonment, or possibly be executed,
 depending on the offences. If a person commits the SAME offence 3 or more
 times, the same applies.

  Robbery or burglary: Robbery is generally punished by a short
 imprisonment and a fine. Also, stolen goods will be returned to their
 respective owners. Depending on the scale of the theft, larger penalties
 can be introduced, like chopping off the criminal's finger/hand/arm/head.

  Vandalism: Vandalism is punished by a fine double to that of the cost of
 damage done. If you are unable to pay, you can be given prolonged
 imprisonment, or worse.

  Any crimes committed that are of special relevance to the Order of Nuln
 will be passed to them if a ballot held by the Tharthaal council agrees.

  Any crimes involving magic, witchcraft, or religion are automatically
 forwarded to the Inquisition, who can choose whether to put the criminal
 on trial, or to give an instant judgement. All Inquisition trials,
 investigations and convictions should be reported by the involved
 followers, to the higher body in the Order of Nuln.

@node "FRIENDS" "Making Friends in Tharthaal"


  Before deciding on where you want to go in Tharthaal it is a good idea
 to think about what your character is like, and likes doing. When your
 character is detailed enough to have his/her own personal taste, you will
 be able to think of the sort of places that your character likes to spend
 his/her time in.. There are many places where anyone can meet like-minded
 people in Tharthaal, it's just a matter of looking on the map, and
 talking to people, as a lot of locations are not on the map..

  Adventurers: There are many taverns in which you'll meet adventuring
 types. Ones of particular interest are: The Sword and Skull and the
 Warrior's Rest.

  Town Guard: The best place to meet members of the town guard, and king's
 militia when they are off duty, is the Guard's Arms, a large tavern that
 only lets people in that are known to the guards and militia within.

  Order of Nuln: The second great temple of Nuln is a good place to meet
 up with fellow believers, as is the Inquisition headquarters. Neither of
 these locations let you in unless you are very well known to them or a
 member of the Order..

  Wealthy citizens: If you have enough money, there are a lot of places in
 Northern Tharthaal where you can meet with fellow nobles. Young gentry
 can make friends by enrolling into the King's College, or by spending
 time in the New-Tharthaal bars.

@node "EQUIPMENT" "Buying Equipment"


  There are many shops in Tharthaal that sell items useful to an
 adventurer. Here is a list of all the interesting shops, and what they
 sell.

  Mafri The Blacksmith's: Mafri is a skilled blacksmith, and makes quality
 weapons and other metal tools.

  The butchers: Sells meat.

  The Armoury: Sells inexpensive common weapons, and supplies weapons to
 the town guard and militia.

  The Town Stables: Sells horses, ponies, donkeys, and other riding
 animals.

  The Town Stores: Sells objects that are useful to adventurers and
 townspeople. This includes rope, torches, candles, paper, ink, spades,
 etc. etc.

  The Market Square: Sells many different objects that may or may not be
 of interest.


@endnode

@node "SLEEP" "Finding somewhere to sleep in Tharthaal"


  Finding a good place to sleep in Tharthaal is not always an easy task.
 The inns and taverns may have space, but often cost more than you're
 willing to spend. Some of them have common rooms, but these are great
 places for thieves and drunkards. The streets are dangerous at nights,
 and sleeping on them is illegal anyway. Sometimes it is possible to find
 sympathetic temples that will offer you place to sleep, but generally they
 wouldn't do that unless they knew you had good intentions or followed
 their religion.


@endnode

@node "MONEY" "Making A living In Tharthaal"


  There are many ways that you can make money in Tharthaal,
 unfortunately, as a newcomer, most of them are extremely difficult.. To
 some though, money is of no importance anyway. Here is a list of some of
 the things you could do to pass the time, and make money if necessary.

  Join the town Guard: The town guard are very welcoming towards people
 who wish to join them. You could either become a civilian official, who
 effectively spies on other townspeople, or a full-blown guard. The latter
 is more difficult, requiring around a year's training, or proof that you
 are good enough to work for them and evidence that you're not completely
 psychotic or likely to perform crimes yourself. The perks of being a
 guard are getting optional full accommodation in the guards barracks, and
 a reasonably steady wage.

  Join the king's militia: Although not everyone's idea of a good living,
 work in the militia does have some good points. First of all, the militia
 is always happy to take on new members, and has many different positions
 for workers. They require cooks, musicians, and troops of various levels
 of skill. To become a base level troop you must go through approximately
 two years of training, or have adequate experience prior to joining. The
 militia spend a lot of time outside of the town, and have recently taken
 part in battles against the Nester People of the north-west. The militia
 also have full free accommodation if required, in the militia barracks,
 and get a medium working class wage.

  Join the Order of Nuln: The Order is quite secretive about what methods
 it uses to recruit Priests and fighters, but they certainly would welcome
 volunteers. The amount of training required for a position is unknown, as
 are the wages, if any. Accommodation is definitely offered to their men
 though, in either their headquarters in south Lyona, or in the great
 northern temple.

  Join one of the other religions: Although none of the other religious
 groups are known to offer any sort of financial payment to their priests
 and volunteers, they may offer them good favour and possibly accommodation
 and food. All the religious groups in Lyona would be happy to gain more
 support, so you shouldn't have any trouble finding something of interest.
 Just make sure that you join the right religion though, as you wouldn't
 want to have to break your religious code later on.

  Become a thief!: Both southern and northern Tharthaal contain enough
 riches to keep a good thief continuously in pocket. There are major
 problems if caught though, so this probably isn't a very easy job,
 especially to those who are new to the town. There is rumoured to be a
 thieves guild within the town, that meets up to plan it's next raids,
 but nobody has been able to prove this.

  Be an adventurer: The life of the average adventurer is a surprisingly
 dull one. Generally sitting in taverns, drinking a lot, adventurers wait
 for rich businessmen and nobles to call upon them and pay them large
 amounts of gold to do odd jobs, like act as a body guard, assassinate an
 enemy, or steal an item. There are more active adventurers than this
 too, who do not quest for money or personal gain, but for justice or
 revenge. These adventurers with a cause are rare beasts indeed, and don't
 usually live very long anyway. Solely adventuring is unlikely to gain you
 enough money to live off, so getting a second income is recommended.

  Do something entirely different: There a hundreds of opportunities for
 your character in Tharthaal. All you have to do is think up some sort of
 career plan, and either seek employment, or set up on your own business.
 The latter is very unlikely, as there are very few unoccupied buildings
 in Tharthaal, and you'd have to pay quite a large sum to persuade a
 family to move out.


@endnode

@node "ADVENTURE" "Finding adventure in Thaarthaal"


  Finding adventure in Tharthaal is not usually that difficult, as there
 are always people who want work done for them. Jobs as bodyguards or
 messagers are particularly common, as are spying jobs. Adventures in the
 traditional role-play sense, by rescuing maidens, killing dragons, and
 running around in dark corridors full of Goblins, are very rare.
 Tharthaal is a city, and most adventures you'll find yourself on will be
 inside the city walls. On occasion you may find yourself outside the
 city, though, so it helps to be equipped for these circumstances.

  Here is a list of things you could do to guarantee an exciting, but
 possibly short life in Tharthaal:

  Spend time in taverns, listening for rumours, and hoping for employment.
 This is what most adventurers seem to do. You'd have to get a good
 reputation as a mercenary to get an acceptable wage though.

  Always aim all of your character's actions toward achieving a certain
 goal or ambition. A lot of adventurers quest for glory more than money,
 while others seek revenge. You must have some idea as to why you choose
 such a hazardous, and generally badly-paid job.

  Volunteer to do odd jobs for the religious groups and organisations of
 Tharthaal. The town guard and Order of Nuln in particular make use of
 civilian spies and observers.

  Join a religious group as a missionary, fighter priest, guard, or any
 other position you are interested in. There is always a lot of work to do
 as a priest of most religions, but the work can be very rewarding.

  Most of all, be observant. The most successful of adventurers do not
 wait for someone to ask them to do something. Instead, they wait and
 listen, adventuring for themselves, not some rich businessmen.

@node "QUEST" "The New-Player Application and Generation"


  The Mystic Initiation Sheet is split into three sections: New Player
 Application, Character Generation, and Communication sections. You
 must answer all questions fully for the application to be valid.


 New Player Application:

  The information I get from the application section I can use to database
 my players, and get some idea of what they're expecting from the game, as
 well as tell what game options the players want active.


 Character Generation:

  Before filling in the Character Generation section it would be wise for
 you to read a lot, if not all, of the guide, so that you can answer the
 questions accurately and won't want to change your mind about them later.

  Using the answers you have given to these questions I will generate your
 character for use in the game, so make sure you are clear in what you
 want your character to be like.


 Communication Section:

  This is the section on which you plan your preset questions and answers.
 What you input here is used solely by the *ASK command, which is used to
 speed up communication between players.

  This section is different to the others in a few ways. I'll explain; You
 will see a list of communications or phrases, with a number by each one.
 Underneath each question there are two gaps for you to write your answers
 in. A completed example for one communication:

        Q1: What is your Name?
        C1: By what name shall I call thou?
        A1: My name is Jaarin of Itona, son of Kyanto.

  Q: This is the meaning of the question. Do NOT change this.
  C: The communication YOU make when you choose this entry number.
  A: This is the answer YOU give when asked this question number.

  When you insert a communication into the C or A column, be sure that
 there is NO line wrapping. If it has to be long, it still must on a
 single line.


 Editing the initiation sheet:


 So, I expect you'll want to fill the sheet in now. Providing you have
 one of the following editors in your path, you can edit the sheet from
 this guide by simply pressing the button for your editor. Don't worry,
 there's a backup of the application in the 'texts' directory, named
 'PlayerQuest.BLANK'. If you do not have any of these editors in your
 path, you can edit the text-file 'PlayerQuest' with whatever you please.

  Arcane Lore and Mystic RPG will have continuous development over the
 following years. With work by both Mystic Force Design and third
 parties, the range of Mystic and AL related products should be quite
 large. Already there is work in progress, and a great deal of plans for
 the future. I can guarantee that any MFD product is of optimum quality
 and value. You can find information on the AL range in the text file

@node "GMING" "GMing a Mystic Campaign"


  GMing a Mystic campaign is perfectly possible (I can do it, after all!),
 but not without the rules. Those interested in game mechanics will have
 realised by now that this guide contains very little of substance in the
 rules department. That's how it should be though, as the guide is
 already intimidating to a beginner. Also, I wouldn't want people
 stealing my ideas (I might run out), or using the rules against me.
 Those of you who've GM'd will know exactly what I mean. You know, that
 one player who's read the entire rule book, and knows all the statistics,
 and all of the surprises and abnormalities of the game world. I think
 I've limited the chances of getting any of these troublesome entities by
 only using this guide for universal background information and rules.
 Those aren't the only measures I've gone to to make players unfamiliar
 with their surroundings, not by a long shot. Irall Rhin has it's fair
 share of surprises and perculiarities, which may come as a shock to
 anyone expecting the stereotypical fantasy realm.

  If you wanted to GM, either in a PBM/PBEM sense, or in a traditional
 home RPG with your friends, you would need the Mystic GM's guide. The
 guide uses Irall-Rhin as it's example campaign world, but the Mystic
 system is a generic one, that can work in many separate sorts of game
 world. There are example game world ideas in the guide for the more
 imaginative GMs. Now, if you were seriously thinking of taking up GMing
 for the remotely played game, there are two ways you could go about it.
 Firstly, you could use the Insignia of Terror setting, or secondly you
 could make up and use your own campaign world. Either way, you would be
 expected to keep MFD updated on things going on in your GM territory,
 especially if you have territory in Irall Rhin, as your players could
 quite easily decide to stroll over to my GMing city of Tharthaal.

  For more information on GMing a Mystic campaign, see the GM's guide or
 contact me at any of the addresses in this guide.

@node "FINSTA" "Final Statement"


  That's it! You're at the end of the Insignia Of Terror Player's Guide.
 Thank you for reading this guide, it's taken a lot of my work, and
 a great deal of patience from my friends and family. If you're going to
 play in IOT I also thank you for supporting Mystic Force Design in it's
 first large scale creation.

  Yes, you look upon this screen with an air of relief about you. If you
 have finished filling in the character application, and have sent it off,
 you're already on the way to becoming a player in a game that I hope you
 will enjoy and continue to participate in.

  Thanks to all those who have helped create and support Mystic RPG, I owe
