#P:A
HI! I AM MIKKO THE
PROGRAMMER OF THIS
GREAT GAME.
#A:0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7:9

#W:0:WHY ONLY A DEMO
GOOD QUESTION. THIS
PROJECT HAS SURELY
TAKEN SOME TIME.

#W:1:WHEN IT WILL BE READY
I CANNOT PROMISE ANY
EXACT DATES, BUT I
HOPE THAT IN 
SUMMER 96.

#W:2:WILL IT BE AMIGA ONLY
YES. ONLY AMIGA MAKES
IT POSSIBLE.

#W:3:REQUIREMENTS
ANY AMIGA WITH 1 MB
MEMORY AND A HARD 
DISK WITH SOME ROOM.
IT SHOULD WORK EVEN
ON AN A500, BUT I 
WOULD RECOMMEND AT 
LEAST A 68020 WITH 
SOME FAST MEM.

#W:4:WHAT DOES IT COST
THE FULL VERSION WILL 
BE FREEWARE LIKE THIS 
DEMO.

#W:8:WHY NOT AGA AND 18MB
GO ON AND BUY YOURSELF
A PC AND SOME WINDOZ 
GAME INSTEAD. I THINK
IT IS STILL POSSIBLE
TO MAKE A GOOD GAME
WITH 1MB AMY.

#W:5:IS IT SYSTEM FRIENDLY
YES IT IS PROGRAMMED 
USING SYSTEM ROUTINES 
AND KEEPING 
MULTITASKING AND 
EFFICIENT MEMORY 
USAGE IN MIND.


#W:6:DO YOU USE AMOOSE
NO, IT SUCKS. ALL 
REAL PROGRAMS ARE 
MADE WITH C.


#W:7:ANYTHING ELSE
HAVE FUN WITH THIS 
DEMO AND KEEP UP 
WITH YOUR AMIGA!

#W:9:BYE
BYE
