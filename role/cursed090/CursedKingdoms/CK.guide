     +-----------------------+

@{b}Commands
@{ub}
SLASH - Slashs your opponent with weapon.

BASH -  Bashs your opponent very hard. If succesfull then a damage is done 
        with weapon and enemy falls down for several battle turns. But if
        not then your character falls down.

KICK -  Kicks your opponent. If succesfull only a minimal damage is done,
        but your opponent falls down for several turns. There is no risk
        of falling down when kicking.

PARRY - Tries to block opponent's slash.

@{b}Positions
@{ub}
FRONT - Best possibility to hit opponents or being hit yourself.
...
BACK - Worst possibility to hit, but best possibility for not being hit.

@{b}Tactics
@{ub}
Try to kick as many enemies down in the first turn as possible. Then
it should be easy to kill the collapsed enemies. When they get up try to kick
then again. But don't kick all the time, because kicking does only 
minimal damage. When you have superior power you can try to bash your
enemies, but bashing a superior enemy is very risky business.
