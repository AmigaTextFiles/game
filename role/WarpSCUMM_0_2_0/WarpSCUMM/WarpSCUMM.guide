--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@{b}Running:@{ub}

    Before you run the engine, you need to put the game's datafiles in a
    directory. The filenames must be in lowercase on *nix systems
    (monkey2.000 and monkey2.001). If you use a game with speech, the file
    monster.sou must reside in the same directory as the datafiles.

    The short game name you see at the end of the command line is very
    important. A short list is contained @{"here" link GameList}.

@{b}Command Line Options:@{ub}

        scummvm [OPTIONS] [GAME]

        [GAME]     - Short name of game to load. E.g. monkey for Monkey Island.

        -p<path>   - Path to where the game is installed. Default is PROGDIR:.
        -b<num>    - Start in room <num>.
        -c<num>    - Drive to play cd audio from.  E.g., 0 is first drive.
        -s<num>    - Set the sfx volume, 0-255.    Default is '100'

        Alt-Enter                - toggles full screen/windowed

    Note that using ctrl-f and ctrl-g are not recommended: Games can crash
    when being ran faster than their normal speed, as scripts will loose
    syncronisation.

@{b}Graphics filters:@{ub}

    ScummVM offers several anti-aliasing filters to attempt to improve visual
    quality. These are the same filters used in many other emulators, such as
    MAME.

    They are:
        -gnormal     - No filtering, original 320x200 resolution. Fastest.
        -g2x         - No filtering, double screen/window size to 640x480 (def).
        -g3x         - No filtering, triple screen/window size to 800x600.
        -g2xsai      - 2xsai filtering, double screen/window size to 640x480.
        -gsuper2xsai - Enhanced 2xsai filtering. 640x480 screen/window size.
        -gsupereagle - Less blurry than 2xsai, but slower. Also 640x480.
        -gadvmame2x  - 640x480 scaling. Doesn't rely on blurring like 2xSAI.

    Note that filters are very slow when ScummVM is compiled in a debug
    configuration without optimizations. And there is always a speed impact
    when using any form of anti-aliasing/linear filtering.

@{b}Autosaves:@{ub}

Because ScummVM is still a beta product, it -can- crash and/or hang
occasionally. As such, every five minutes it will save a game in Slot 0. This
game can be loaded via Ctrl-0, or the F5 menu.

@{b}Savegames:@{ub}

    Savegames are by default put in the current directory. You can use the
    environment variable SCUMMVM_SAVEPATH to specify where to put save games.
    Don't forget the trailing directory separator. Also be aware that saved
    games can, and probably WILL, break between ScummVM releases.

@{b}Music and Sound:@{ub}

    By default, on most operating systems, ScummVM will automatically use ADLIB
    emulation. However, some games do not include Adlib music - such as Sam and
    Max.

    Theese work under WarpSCUMM/WarpSDL:

        -eadlib     - Uses internal Adlib Emulation (default)
        -emidiemu   - Emulated midi music, for Sam and Max (BETA - BUGGY)
        -enull      - Null output. Don't play any music. (Good for slow 680x0
                      cpu's).

@{b}Playing sound with Adlib emulation:@{ub}

    By default an Adlib card will be emulated and ScummVM will output the music
    as sampled waves. This is the default mode for most games, and offers the
    best compatability between machines and games.

@{b}Playing sound with MIDI emulation:@{ub}

    Until recently, some games (particually Sam and Max) were only able to run
    in MIDI mode. This prevented music for these games from working on
    platforms that do not support MIDI, or soundcards that do not provide MIDI
    drivers (eg, many soundcards will not play MIDI under Linux). We have
    recently added an 'emulated MIDI' technology. It can be accessed using the
    'midiemu' option, and is the default for Sam and Max on UNIX platforms.
    -HOWEVER-, it is still very buggy and the emulation is not perfect.
    If you are capable of using native midi, we recommend using one of the
    MIDI modes below.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ScummVM is an implementation of the SCUMM (Script Creation Utility for
    Maniac Mansion) engine used in various Lucas Arts games such as Monkey
    Island and Day of the Tentacle. At this time ScummVM should be considered
    ALPHA software, as it's still under heavy development. Be aware that while
    many games will work with few major bugs, crashes can happen. Also note
    that saved games can, and probably will, be incompatible between releases.

    Also ScummVM is capable of playing several non-SCUMM games, at the moment
    this includes Simon The Sorcerer.

    If you enjoy ScummVM feel free to donate using the PayPal button on the
    ScummVM homepage. This will help us buy utilities needed to develop ScummVM
    easier and quicker. If you cannot donate, help and contribute a patch!

    At the moment the following games have been reported to work, and should
    be playable to the end:

        Loom (256 color CD version)               [Game: loomcd]
        Zak McKraken (256 color FM Towns version) [Game: zak256]
        Monkey Island 1 (CD version)              [Game: monkey1]
        Monkey Island 2                           [Game: monkey2]
        Indiana Jones And The Fate Of Atlantis    [Game: atlantis]
        Day Of The Tentacle                       [Game: tentacle]
        Sam & Max                                 [Game: samnmax]
        Simon The Sorcerer                        [Game: simon1dos/simon1win]


    The following games should load, but are not yet fully playable. Play at
    your own risk, and please do not file bug reports about them. If you want
    the latest updates on game compatibility, visit our web site and view the
    compatibility chart.

        Monkey Island 1 (VGA floppy)                   [Game: monkeyvga]
        Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (256 color) [Game: indy3]
        Full Throttle                                  [Game: ft]
        The Dig                                        [Game: dig]

    The following games are SCUMM engine, but NOT supported by ScummVM (yet).

        Maniac Mansion
        Zak McKraken (16 color floppy version)
        Monkey Island 1 (EGA, 16 color floppy version)
        Loom (16 color floppy version)
        Curse of Monkey Island

    Please be aware that the engine may contains bugs and non-implemented-
    features that sometimes make it impossible to finish the game. Save often,
    and please file a bug report (details on submitted bug reports are below)
    if you discover such a bug.

    ScummVM has been ported to run on many platforms and operating systems.
    Links to these ports can be found either on the ScummVM web page or by a
    Google search. Many thanks to the effort of porters. If you have a port of

@NODE "FAQ"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ScummVM FAQ
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@{b}Why is it called ScummVM - what does this name mean?@{ub}
Scumm comes from the fact that it was designed to run SCUMM games, like
Monkey Island. VM stands for VIRTUAL MACHINE.

@{b}What is SCUMM?@{ub}
SCUMM stands for "Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion". It is an utility
used to create the famous LucasArts adventure games. It was initially created
in 1987 by Aric Wilmunder and Ron Gilbert for the game "Maniac Manson" and was
used later, with some modifications, for Zak McKracken and the Alien
Mindbenders, Loom, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Indiana Jones and the
Fate of Atlantis, Monkey Island 1,2,3, Sam & max Hit the Road,
Day of the Tentacle, The Dig and Full Throttle.

@{b}Is ScummVM free?@{ub}
ScummVM is released under the GPL (General Public License), so it's more than
free. ScummVM source code is freely available and you can do whatever you want
with it. If you make modifications to it and redistribute your work you MUST
make the source available. However, ScummVM team would be pleased if you choose
to send them your modifications, so they can be merged into the main tree.
More information on the GNU GPL at @{u}http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html@{uu}.

@{b}What games does ScummVM support?@{ub}
We have a @{"Compatability List" link GameList} on our website that contains an up to date list
of what games work, and how well they work.

@{b}Will ScummVM support other games?@{ub}
The ScummVM team is working to make newer games, such as "The Dig", playable.
We are also working to correct make the currently supported games more
accurate.

@{b}Where do I find ScummVM?@{ub}
You can find it on the page on sourceforge:
@{u}http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/scummvm@{uu}. You can download the
latest version, which could be a little old. For the most recent version,
you have to get it via CVS (instructions are on SourceForge page).

@{b}On what platform does ScummVM run?@{ub}
ScummVM should be able to be compiled on any SDL platform, just with small
modifications. Currently tested platforms are Win32 (Windows 9x/ME/NT/2000),
Linux i386 and PPC, BeOS, Solaris, MacOS 9, MacOSX, Dreamcast, MorphOS,
IRIX, AmigaOS(WarpSDL) and WinCE. It is also part of the FreeBSD ports
collection.

@{b}Does ScummVM run any non-Scumm games?@{ub}
Yes. Currently the only non Scumm game supported is Simon The Sorcerer.
This game was added because it was very similar to Scumm. We don't have any
plans to support any other non-Scumm games at this time. If we do, it will be
added to the @{"Compatibility List" link GameList}.

@{b}Do I need original CD or Floppy disks?@{ub}
Most definitely. ScummVM won't work without them. If you would like to buy
these games, we suggest you browse Ebay. Do not ask the ScummVM team where you
can download the full versions of Lucas Arts games. These requests will be
ignored.

@{b}Can I save/restore the game?@{ub}
Yes. Saving and restoring is already supported (SHIFT-1/9 to save, CTRL - 1/9
to restore, or F5 to access the saving screen).

@{b}Do savegames from the original games work in ScummVM?@{ub}
No. We do not have any plans to load old savegames. Newer versions of ScummVM
have also broke compatibility with older ScummVM savegames. Since ScummVM is
still considered alpha, we may break savegames again in the future.

@{b}Does ScummVM support CD audio?@{ub}
Yes, ScummVM fully supports CD audio in Monkey Island CD, and Loom. Just keep
your game CD inserted into your CD drive when you start ScummVM. If you have
more than one CD drive in your system. You can specify your CD drive using
the -c command line parameter.

@{b}Does ScummVM support using MP3 files instead of CD audio?@{ub}
Yes. You can use LAME or some other CD audio conversion utility to convert
your CD audio to MP3. @{u}Note:@{uu} WarpSCUMM is not compiled with MP3 support
enabled so this feature is disabled, use CDDA instead!

@{b}Does ScummVM support filtered graphic modes?@{ub}
Yes, ScummVM supports several filtered graphic modes such as super2xsai.

@{b}Can I run my game full screen?@{ub}
Yes. You can either start your game using the -f command line parameter.
Or you can hit Alt+Enter in game to switch between full screen and windowed
modes.

@{b}My game won't run.@{ub}
First make sure your game is supported. If it is a supported game and you have
followed the instructions in, then report this as a bug.

@{b}I don't hear any music.@{ub}
By default, on most operating systems, ScummVM will automatically use ADLIB
emulation. However, some games do not include Adlib music - such as
Sam and Max.

@{b}My game crashes at some point.@{ub}
If you can reproduce this crash more than once, please report it to our
Bug Tracker.

@{b}The game colors are messed up.@{ub}
This is a known issue with using Amiga version datafiles. Use the -a command
line parameter to enable Amiga pal conversion.

 Bugs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Bugs that you think are caused by WarpSDL.library you send to ME, other
    bugs you send to the ScummVM team. And not bother them with
    WarpSDL.library issues please ;).

    This release has the following known bugs. There is no need to report them,
    although patches to fix them are welcome.

       Indy 4 (Fate Of Atlantis):
                - Keyboard fighting does not work. ScummVM now defaults to
                  using mouse fighting.


       Sam and Max:
                - Subgames are not all fully functional.

                - Conroy singing in Bumpusville may work incorrectly. Eg,
                  music will overlap and Conroy will get stuck singing. Just
                  hit escape to skip the cutscene. This is due to SNM using
                  a different iMUSE implementation to previous games.


       Zak McKracken Fm Towns:
                - The Fm Towns 256 color version of Zak McKracken is rare,
                  And as the ScummVM team does not encourage piracy in any
                  way, we do not know where to buy or download a copy of this
                  game. Petition LucasArts to re-release it :)

                - No music or sound effects yet.


       Loom (256 Talkie):
                - If you are having random crashes, this is a Windows bug.
                  Try copying the data files from CD to your hard disk.

                - Bobbin may sometimes appear to walk backwards.

    To report a bug, please create a SourceForge account and follow the bugs
    link from our homepage. Please make sure the bug is reproducible, and
    still exists in the latest daily build/current CVS version. Also check the
    compatibility listing for that game to ensure the issue is not already known.

    Do NOT report bugs listed as being completable above.

    Please include the following information:
        - Game version (PLEASE test the latest CVS/Daily build)
        - Bug details, including instructions on reproducing
        - Language of game (English, German, etc)
        - Version of game (Talkie, Floppy...)
        - Platform and Compiler (Win32, Linux, etc)
        - Attach a save game if possible
        - If this bug only occurred recently, please note the last
          version without the bug, and the first version including
          the bug. That way we can fix it quicker by looking at the
          changes made.
