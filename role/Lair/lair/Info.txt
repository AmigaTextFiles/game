	The world is  Loria - probably set back in 10000 BC around
the time Atlantis fell into  the ocean.  The world  is filled with
many magical beasts -  wizards - fighters - and all sorts of small
towns.  Gandir Zhan - the  evil  arch-mage has  retrived the three
pawns of power and  now threatens  to destroy  the world  and take
it over  with his own army of beasts. Many  brave adventurers have
died trying to defeat  him. There is little time left - maybe just
enough time  for one  or two  brave souls to  defeat him  and save
the world. Maybe...
