	LairMUD V1.0  - Docs!

	Okay, these are going to be short and simple. LairMUD is
a 1 or 2 player text based fantasy adventure. After playing several
MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons) on Internet, I decided I could make one
on the Amiga that two people could play together. If you want to
play with another player (which is reccomended) the  person will
need a modem to call you on. This game supports speeds 1200-19200BPS.
This game should work on ALL Amigas, however, the only Amiga I have
tested this on is my Amiga 500 with 512K Chip and 2.5K RAM with
OS 2.04. Its written in GFA-BASIC 3.52, and runs very fast with no
lag whatsoever. The program is FREEWARE, which means, its free to
upload anywhere or send it to anyone you like. Im not asking for
donations for this program or anything. I WILL be updating it a lot
nd it will be posted on the internet whenever a new version is
released, so it should spread around fairly quickly. If you have any
questions or comments you can mail me at  dongho@cs.wisc.edu on the
Internet. Hope you enjoy it.

Quick overview of files:

Lair         79184 Bytes - Main program. Type "lair" in cli/shell to run!
Lair.doc      3656 Bytes - The documentiation file (This file).
Info.txt       552 Bytes - Info for Lair game, NEED THIS!
Map1.txt       598 Bytes - Map of the currect world of Loria, NEED THIS!
Monsters.txt   234 Bytes - Monster data file for lair, NEED THIS!
Objects.txt    137 Bytes - Object data file for lair, NEED THIS!
Helpmenu.txt   965 Bytes - The online help menu, NEED THIS!
Shorthelp.txt  106 Bytes - Shortcuts for commands menu, NEED THIS!

How to play!

First, make a directory somewhere named "/lair" or something. Then you
NEED to ASSIGN this directory to "Lair:". PUT ALL FILES IN THE LAIR
DIRECTORY! Then to run it, cd to "Lair:" and type "lair" or "run lair"
and if all the correct files are in the directory UNALTERED the game
should run fine!

	You then will be asked for 1 or 2 players. If its just you, just
type "1" and then the game will continue on. The game is pretty self
explanitory from there.

Playing with another person via modem!

This DOES work, I have tested it with another person a lot. The only 
thing is the process of getting to do it. Select 2 players when you run,
you will then be asked for the baud you wish to set the modem port at. 
After that you will be put into a terminal mode. When you see the person
call by the result "RING" coming to your screen, type "ATA". Then the
two of you can talk freely. If it doesnt show what you type, or if it
echos everything funny, you have to set your modem with ATE command.. 
When you two are ready, you have to hit CTRL-P and it will let you play.
Everything from there is pretty self explanitory. 

BUGS! ? 

This is version 1.0.. This game is NOT by any means CLOSE to completetion. 
What it basically is, is a rough skeleton for the finished product. There
are 61 rooms total in this version. Explore all you wish. Fight the 
monsters you encounter, help each other out. Collect objects. There isnt
a set adventure or objective yet, mainly because I havent coded it all
yet. I want people to try this game out and to let me know wht bugs they
find and what they think should be added, or changed. My final goal is to
finish this game with over 500 rooms, a full adventure, and mini mysteries
to be solved. Puzzles to be solved, etc. But before I code all of that I
just want to know what you feel about it. This version IS fairly stable
as far as I can tell after playing it often. Happy gaming!
