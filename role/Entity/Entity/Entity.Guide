We planned Entity as long ago as 1996, and began developing it in 1998.
However, other commitments halted its progression, and the game stagnated on
our hard drives.  As we did not want to have wasted 18 months' work, we
decided to release Entity in an unfinished state: the "90% mix".

Soon after the release, we were informed of a whopping bug that prevented
anyone from progressing more than half-way through the game.  This bug has now
been fixed and, thanks to the encouragement of a few DAS Software fans, we
have now finished making the game.

The final release had all of the music incorporated, all bugs squashed, and
there are only a few minor plot holes left to detract from a fun (if short)
adventure.

After the final release, we were made aware of @{b}another@{ub} bug, and a problem with
the archive that stopped the load/save function working.  This @{b}final@{ub} final
release fixes the two problems, and also fixes another problem unnoticed by
anyone but ourselves.

Many thanks to Frederic Bezies and Thomas Chen for the bug reports.

@{b}@{u}The Plot@{ub}@{uu}

Entity follows on from Bud Lightning's adventures in The Experiment, and pits
our hero against a new, more terrifying threat to Freedom and Justice than
ever before encountered!

@{fg shine}YOU@{fg text} control Bud as he struggles to overcome the Forces of Evil, and fights to
unravel the mysterious fate of the passengers of the starship Du Pont...

Never fear; this time, there are NO Primitive Tribes, mountain sides, Alien
Scribes or small fluffy creatures.

First of all, you need to extract this archive to your hard disk.  I will
assume that you have already done this.  If you haven't, yet are still able to
read this, I will assume that you really don't need any help, and lo! I move
to the next, more salient, point.

Copy the contents of the libs/ directory to your SYS:Libs (or just LIBS:)
directory.  Do not copy the fonts to your Fonts: directory, as AMOS cannot
cope with large numbers of fonts and crashes hopelessly.  Entity cunningly
skirts around this bug via the means of a shell script.

And that's that.
@endnode

@node "Requirements" "Requirements"
The minimum system requirements for Entity are:

 - Workbench 2.04+
 - 1 megabyte RAM
 - A mouse
 - A hard drive (or similar high-capacity drive, such as the RAM disk,
   a Zip disk or a CD-ROM)

A basic A600 will do, but a souped-up A500 could run it, too.

It plays best with:

 - A monitor
 - An accelerator
 - Fast RAM

Eyeballs help too.

It is probable that DAS Software, like the classic Amiga and Amiga Power, has
no future.  We have no more graphic adventures planned.  However, I still want
to finish the Gorman Fishtank, and have plans for a one-on-one beat-em-up.
Otherwise, DAS has gasped its last.

We won't develop for the new AmigaDE.  If it doesn't run Lotus Esprit, and
doesn't contain a 68K CPU, it's not an Amiga.

@node "Bud" "Bud Lightning"
Contrary to what you might expect, Bud Lightning was invented before Buzz
Lightyear.  Several years before, in fact, and if we (or more specifically,
John) had felt the need to trademark the name, we could have made millions!

Ah, well.
@endnode

@node "General" "Instructions   "
@toc "Instructions"
Control is via the mouse.  To make @{"Bud" link "Bud" 0} walk, move the mouse pointer to where
you want Bud to walk to, and click the @{fg shine}left@{fg text} mouse button.

The icons in the control screen (pictures of keys, a mouth, etc) are @{"verbs" link "Verbs" 0};
click on a @{"verb" link "Verbs" 0}, and then an object, and Bud will perform the action on the
object.  For example, if you clicked on the Operate button, and then on an
airlock, Bud would open the airlock and space himself, to avoid being included
in yet another poor adventure game.  Needless to say, this puzzle is not
included in the game, because we didn't want to draw the explosion.

To use a verb, click on the appropriate icon with the @{fg shine}left@{fg text} button, and then
the object with the @{fg shine}right@{fg text} button.  Otherwise, Bud will simply walk over to it.
An object is either:

 - A thing in a room, eg. a table
 - A word in the inventory (the large blue window in the control panel).

Move the mouse over the object or word, and its name will appear in the blue
strip at the top of the control panel.
@endnode

@node "Verbs" "Verbs          "
@toc "Instructions"
The verb icons are as follows:

@{b}@{u}EXAMINE (an eye)@{ub}@{uu}

Bud walks over and describes an object.


@{b}@{u}TAKE (an upwards-pointing arrow)@{ub}@{uu}

Take an object.


@{b}@{u}OPERATE (an arrow pushing a button)@{ub}@{uu}

Operate a single object.  Also opens doors.


@{b}@{u}USE (an arrow pushing a key into a hole)@{ub}@{uu}

Use one object on another.  The first object is usually held in Bud's
inventory.  It can also can be used to give an object to another character.

@{b}@{u}
TALK TO (a mouth)@{ub}@{uu}

Talk to another character.


@{b}@{u}SHOOT (a gun)@{ub}@{uu}

Shoots something.

@node "Load" "Load/save games"
@toc "Instructions"
To save a game, press @{fg shine}SHIFT@{fg text} and @{fg shine}F1@{fg text} - @{fg shine}F10@{fg text}.  Each function key selects a
different save game slot; there are, therefore, 10 slots available.  Press
either the left mouse button to confirm the save, or the right mouse button to
cancel.

To load a game, press @{fg shine}F1@{fg text} - @{fg shine}F10@{fg text}, and then the mouse in the same way as above.
If a saved game is not found, the game currently in progress will continue as
normal.



@{b}@{u}Notes@{ub}@{uu}

A saved game can be loaded at any time, but saving is not allowed during a
cut-scene (when the player has no control over Bud).

Make sure you have not got @{fg shine}Caps Lock@{fg text} enabled; the computer will think you are
pressing @{fg shine}SHIFT@{fg text}, and will save a game instead of loading it.  Frustrating.
@endnode

@node "Other commands" "Other commands "
@toc "Instructions"
The following can be pressed at any time in the game:

   M        -     Memory remaining

   V        -     GRACPlayer version number

   Q        -     Quit (left mouse confirms, right mouse cancels)

   Ctrl C   -     Quit (no confirm necessary)

@node "Hints" "Helpful Hints  "
@toc "Instructions"
Examine everything.  This will give vital clues as to the object's use, if it
has one.  There are plenty of @{"red herrings" link "Secrets" 0} about, eg. @{"false leads" link "Secrets" 0}, useless
objects (1200 motherboard revision 1d.4), but all of the puzzles are logical.
The key to success, apparently, is to think like John.

This is an AmigaGuide, a form of "hypertext", and is very easy to use.  If you
need help, I suggest three things:

 1. Try to become "computer literate".
 2. Try to become literate.
 3. If both (1) and (2) fail, try a psychiatrist.

If you follow these basic steps, you will become a Happy Camper.
