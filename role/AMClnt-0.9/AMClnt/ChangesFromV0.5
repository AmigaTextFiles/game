Changes made to AmigaMUD since the initial V0.5 release


Scenario

    look/examine can now examine the merchandise in a store.
    Decided to not make all of the other commands, like "smell",
    "touch", etc. do this.

    Corrected the usage lines for "@room new" and "@room newname".

    Moved "MakeBulletinBoard" from the public table to "t_util".

    Made "makebuilder" private to SysAdmin instead of public.

    Fixed the build stuff so that the button works again.

    Added more stuff above the rockpile area.

    Added more of the goblin city.

    Added "bluegrey", "reversegrey" and "textcolours" text window
    colour commands. Made the scenario save the colours between
    sessions. Made the 'gold' settings the same as the ones that
    "MUD" uses with normal, -B and -D.

    Minor corrections to the books in the Builder's Guild.

    When you are hit during combat, you are now shown your hits
    remaining and your total hitpoints.

    defined DelNorthChecker, ... etc.

    In build code, added "@room subdircheck <dir> <action-symbol>".

    In build code, use of "nil" as the action in any "setXXXaction"
    command results in any existing action being removed.

    In build code, renamed all "@o XXXaction" to be "@o XXXchecker".

    In build code, treat "read" special - more like "desc". Also made
    corresponding new handler for verb "read".

    Universally made "inactivate" the same as "deactivate".

    Added spell "unmakebuilder" and fixed "makebuilder"

    Added command aliases - commands 'alias' and 'aliases'.

    Changed the way max hitpoints are calculated.

    Added adverbs to the action/noise pose words, and added a bunch
    more of the words.

MUDServ

    Fixed "FindName" to check its parameters before using them.

    Fixed parser to allow verbs with ISO Latin-1 characters.

    Added a couple more checks of cl_canWizard, etc.

    Fixed version calculation in a couple of places.

    Fixed list size check in GDefineTile.

    Removed builtin "MainGrammar".

    Made the thing display not shown unknown properties unless it
    is SysAdmin doing the display.

    Added builtin DumpThing.

    Added support for synchronous shutdown requests.

    Added builtins SelectName and SelectWord.

    Added builtin Pluralize.

    Added code to use the stuff to not send passwords in the clear.

MUD

    Fixed rawkey handling to do ALT-keys and European shift-keypad
    keys properly.

    Fixed version calculation.

    Made it go back into terminal mode after a session when using a
    serial connection.

    Hitting the close box when in the internal editor is now the same
    as typing a ^C, rather than being a request to exit MUD.

    Prevent sending input to the server until the first messages
    from the server have been seen, i.e. that everything is ready
    to go.

    Fixed some problems with editing.

    Added -Nname and -Wword CLI options. Renamed previous '-W'
    (close Workbench) to be '-w'.

SMUD

    Added an inactivity timeout option. See the updated SMUD.txt for
    why this doesn't work very well. Sigh.

    Fixed SMUD so that input/output mixups do not occur. This required
    some "cheating" using carriage returns. It seems to work fine.

    Added -Nname and -Wword options.

MUDAgent

    Added -Nname and -Wword options.

MUDShut

    Added -w option for synchronous shutdown.

mud.library

    Fixed lexical scanner to allow ISO Latin-1 characters in identifiers.

    Prevent rawkey, button hit and mouse-up events from being sent to the
    server until we are in st_normal state.

    Mark the current edit proc as non-existant if that proc has just been
    deleted in the server.

    Add 'def' as synonym for 'define'.

    Add the 'delete'/'del' command to delete symbols.

    Added support for using preset character name and password.

    Added support for not sending passwords in the clear.

Documentation

General

    Changed all "wizard.txt" to be "programming.txt".

MUDServ.txt

    In "A Few Basic Wizarding Procedures" added description of
    "DestroyCharacter", "BootClient" and "NukeClient".
