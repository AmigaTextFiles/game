		    Things That Need to Be Done

Add much more to the scenario. I've got lots of ideas, but I wouldn't
want to give away any clues!

Add SMUS music output to MUD.

Enhancements to parser. E.g. distinguish between 'a'/'an' and 'the' so
    that the player can more easily refer to ambiguous objects.

Would be nice to have online building commands that allow adding
    monsters.

Could have more complex actions on monsters, by having a small textual
    "program" that they follow. Don't want to get too carried away!
