Addendum to Experiment.Guide
----------------------------



This is the Internet release of DAS Software's "The Experiment".



The Experiment is no longer available from the recently-defunct F1
Software, and is now freeware.  This means that it can be freely distributed
as long as all files remain intact.  The Experiment remains Copyright
©1996-2001 DAS Software.  Magazines can include the game on coverdisks/CDs
without permission, but we'd like it if they told us about it.  Emulation
sites are encouraged to include the game in their archives.  Again, we'd
like to be notified.



This is the original distribution of The Experiment, with the following
changes:

 - New icon for The Experiment (In The Style Of... Entity).
 - Experiment.Guide executable is no longer powerpacked (powerpacked exe
   files do not seem to work properly on '060 Amigas)
 - This version of The Experiment will only run from a hard disk, or similar
   large disk (ie. CD-ROM, RAM disk, Zip, etc).
 - The ReadMeFirst.doc has been removed.
 - This document has been added.
 - The extra programs and documents from disks 2 and 3 are no longer
   included (they can be downloaded separately from the Green Tentacle Pizza
   website).
 - The Install program is no longer necessary, and so is not included.  To
   install the game, just copy the libs/powerpacker.library to your LIBS:
   directory.
 - An IconX script has been included to make the necessary assigns for the
   game to work (do not worry if you don't know what this means; the system
   is entirely automated). It also circumvents a serious bug in AMOS.
 - The introduction does not include the F1 Software logo screen.
