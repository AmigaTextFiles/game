GRAC Bugs
---------

This is a list of all known bugs in GRAC 1.0. If possible I will say how
to work around them, otherwise you will need to upgrade to GRAC 1.1. This
can be bought from F1 Licenceware, or I will supply the program if you send
a disk with proof of purchase and postage costs.
Please report any more bugs that you find; I will do my best to fix them.
This list is not necessarily complete. I sometimes find bugs and fix them
without noting it down.

1. Grabbing objects from top left to bottom right is the only direction 
   which will not crash the program.

2. It is not possible to change some of the paths, for objects and the
   control panel. Therefore these items must go in the first path on the
   list. If that is a problem the only solution is to use GRAC 1.1

3. Horizontal scrolling does not work properly. Vertical scrolling should be
   fine. I believe this affects GRAC 1.1 as well, but I have fixed it in the
   unreleased GRAC 2. You will have to wait a few months for that.

4. If you quit GRAC without saving, then try to run the game, there is a 
   good chance that the computer will crash. GRAC 1.1 will give an error
   message instead. In both cases the solution is to load the game back 
   into GRAC, reload the file that caused the crash, save it, then save the
   game.

5. Not really a bug but a limitation of the software. Hi-res control panels
   are possible but you have no way of setting the mouse colours because
   hi-res iff files only store the first 16 colours. If you want to change
   the mouse colours (17-20) you will need to load the GRAC# .picture file
   into Amos, unpack it and change the colours, then save it again.

6. Samples don't work properly if the computer has any fast memory. Use the
   gracplayer on this disk to correct this.

7. Having any other character except the first in the list as the player's
   character can cause problems. Solution: use the gracplayer on this disk.
