Here are three IFF screens full of graphics that you could use as objects.
They are drawn by our good friend Malcolm Lavery, now a commercial artist.
You can use them freely in your productions, but please credit Malcolm
for his work somewhere in your game. Expect lots more in Grac User disk #2.

Double click on the icons to view the pictures now.

Apologies to Malcolm fo remapping the screens to the same colour palette, but
they would have been unusable otherwise.
