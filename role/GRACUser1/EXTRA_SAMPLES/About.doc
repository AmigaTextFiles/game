In this directory are four sound samples you could use in your games.
Door_Open, Explosion, Glass_Break and Gunshot. All are pretty self
explanatory.

Sorry, but there was no room left on the disk for a sample player. So
load your own sample playing software to try them out or just use them
in GRAC.
