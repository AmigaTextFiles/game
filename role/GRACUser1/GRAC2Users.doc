GRAC 2 Users
------------

This disk was put together before GRAC 2.0 was released. However, I made
certain that the tutorial would be compatible with GRAC 2. So if you can't
get it to work, please don't complain to F1 Licenceware, first try it
again, following all instructions carefully, then, if that does not solve
the problem, write to me and I will sort it out.

You cannot load the demo into GRAC 2. This is not necessary in any case
since the object of the tutorial is to create your own version of the demo.

The scripts described in the tutorial file are in GRAC 1 format but they
will all work with GRAC 2 if you just put a comma between the two numbers.

   eg.        say    -1           -1

   becomes:   say    -1,-1

   or even:   say    pc,string

The third line is using the new GRAC 2 preset variables described in the 
GRAC 2 documentation.

You should of course use GRACplayer2 rather than GRACplayer as stated in the
tutorial.

The bugs file refers entirely to GRAC 1.0 and 1.1. There are no known bugs
in GRAC 2.0, a situation which is certain to change before long.
