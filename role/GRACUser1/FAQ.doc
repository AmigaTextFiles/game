GRAC FAQ
--------

Naturally I only called the program GRAC so that I could use the above title.
In case anyone doesn't know, FAQ stands for Frequently Asked Questions.
Actually I generally include a question even if I have been asked it only
once; this would be a very short file otherwise. If your question is not
listed, write to me at the address in the GRAC documentation or e-mail
E.W.Clay@durham.ac.uk
If you don't get a reply to e-mail within a few days I'm probably away
from university and you will have to write (snail-mail) instead. I guarantee
a reply to all mail with an S.A.E.

Here are the questions:

Q. Why won't the documents print out?

A. Because the printer.device is missing from the disk. Solution: copy it 
   into the devs directory, or boot from Workbench. This only affects
   GRAC 1.0.


Q. I find it hard to draw characters. Can you help?

A. No. Drawing characters is very difficult, but you will just have to get
   to work in Dpaint. What I usually do is create an eight frame animation,
   then copy each frame onto a single picture when it looks all right.
   You should use a frame rate of ten per second.


Q. Why does GRAC crash when I grab an object?

A. You have to grab from top right to bottom left (see the bugs file).


Q. Why does the script editor clear what I have typed after a few seconds?

A. Another minor bug. You need to use the mouse to get to the first entry
   in the script; don't press return.


Q. I have managed to complete the tutorial but I can't get my own game to
   run. What am I doing wrong?

A. It could be any of a number of things. I will list everything I can think
   of, but GRAC is very touchy; it won't work unless you get everything 
   right, and it doesn't always tell you why. That is something I could
   improve on in GRAC 2.
   Here is what you need to get a game to run:

   * Obviously, the game file, with an icon, and the gracplayer in the same
     drawer.

   * A control panel. This should have a text window, message bar, and at
     least one verb.

   * An inventory. It needn't have anything in it.

   * A character. All of the preset positions must be there, in all
     directions. This includes the heads.

   * An object bank. Again, it can be empty at first. Please use different
     banks for the control panel and the room. You are just wasting memory
     otherwise because GRAC will load it in twice.

   * A room. It will need to have a walk zone with a point in it for the
     character to start at.

   * Then, to put it all together, go to the object bank and select your
     character. Click on START in the main menu and choose a starting
     room, character and point. Then when you run the game it should load
     everything and let you move the character around. If not, you have
     done something wrong. It really does work; I have several working games
     to prove it.


Q. I can't get the tutorial to work. Why not?

A. The most likely reason in that you haven't followed the instructions
   accurately. Try it again.


Q. How do I make a self-booting disk?

A. The easiest way is to take the Lethal Formula disk, delete all of the GRAC
   files and copy your own game onto it. You must then make sure that the
   path name used by your game matches the name of the disk. If you want
   to make a multiple disk game then you need only one boot disk and use
   ordinary blank disks for the others. It's just a matter of making sure
   that all of the paths are correct; that is, is GRAC thinks that a certain
   file is on a certain disk then it had better be there, otherwise it's
   going to crash. I will warn you that GRAC 1.0 has bugs which could
   prevent the use of more than one disk. The solution is to upgrade to
   GRAC 1.1 (see the bugs file).


Q. Why does the room move around as the character walks?

A. All GRAC rooms will automatically scroll centred around the player's
   character. This is to allow rooms larger than the physical screen.
   The only way to stop it is to have a picture the same size as the visible
   area of the display. If you are using Dpaint this will usually mean
   grabbing the picture as a brush and saving it that way, because Dpaint
   will not save pictures smaller than the full screen.


Q. Can I run GRAC from Amos?

A. Yes. You will need Amospro 2.0 and powerpacker. Then, unpack the
   gracplayer (it will nearly double in size) and from your Amos program
   use the lines:

   Command Line$="name of your game"
   Run "Gracplayer"

   Where naturally you have to fill in the blanks and and get the paths
   right.


Q. Can I run an Amos program from GRAC?

A. No. Technically this is possible, but you could never get back to GRAC
   afterwards, so I haven't implemented it. I could save the game to ram,
   I suppose, then restart the Gracplayer and reload it. It would be fiddly
   and heavy on memory. GRAC can handle most sequences anyway. There's little
   need to go back to Amos.


Q. Is it possible to have map screens?

A. Not in GRAC 1. I have already programmed the feature in GRAC 2 though!


Q. What about character scaling?

A. This can't be done in Amos. (I'm waiting for someone to prove me wrong.)


Q. Is there any possibility of AGA support?

A. As soon as an AGA extension is released for AMOS. This is likely to
   happen quite soon.

Q. What does a minus sign in front of a flag signify?

A. This has caused a bit of confusion. Read the following carefully:

   GRAC uses 1000 flags to keep track of the state of a game. These flags
   each hold an integer value which can be positive or negative. The value
   held by a flag may be changed at will in a script.
   The LOGICAL value of a flag depends entirely on its integer value. It is
   not a separate thing. If a flag holds the value zero then its logical
   value is FALSE. Otherwise it is TRUE.
   The logical value of a flag is used for one purpose only. This is when
   an object or zone is assigned a flag. In this case the object will only
   appear if the logical value of the flag is TRUE. Now, it may be that you
   want the object to appear when the flag is FALSE. For example, all flags
   (except flag zero) start off as FALSE, so if you want an object to be
   there at the start of the game then you will want to assign the flag
   this way round. To do this you put a minus sign in front of the flag.

   example: flag #1 has the value 0 at the start of the game. There is an
            object on the floor which needs to disappear when the player
            picks it up. So, enter -1 as the flag for this object.


Q. Can I have a step-by-step guide to creating a game from scratch please?

A. Well, it would take me all of my spare time for a week to put it 
   together, but all right. You will find it on this disk.
