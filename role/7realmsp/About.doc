About the game.

The game was begun on the 24th March 1996, inspired by one of my mates.
It is my first full game for the Amiga, although I have a background
in writing on the spectrum 48k.

    It's written in Blitz Basic 2.1 which is frankly absolutely great
(no plug intended), and has enabled me to create a first game which I
am modestly (*blush*) proud of.

    The Seven Realms of A'Teth was begun after I decided to abandon a
project I was working on called SuperSchizoids - which was set to give
the old Speccy classic - schizoids - the stardust treatment. However, my
then-limited knowledge of Blitz meant that it was much too hard and I
started 7Realms because I thought it would be an easier undertaking - ho
ho ho ho ho!!!!!!!!!!! I was wrong. Collision detection is one problem,
but keeping track of 1600 monsters per level, each with seven different
subvariables plus dialogue, weapons, character attributes is entirely
another problem.

    I can be reached at: Jarvisc@wkac.ac.uk, if you want to e-mail me
with comments, further suggestions, enquiries etc.

    Also tell me how difficult you though it was, as difficulty curves
are one of the hardest things I have been working on.

    Anyway, play this version, if you like it, you can register with me
and get the full version plus lots of other stuff (see 7Realms.doc), if
you don't like it, e-mail me and tell me why so that I can change it.

    History.

    v1. - My mate has this brilliant idea that I should try to write
          this game. - so I write a basic mapscroller, with the ability
          to go into other maps (i.e. towns)

    v1.1 Wrote a text output routine to tell you what was happening to
         you as you moved around the level.

    v1.2 Really naff monsters added + a wholly unsatisfactory fight
         routine.

    v1.3 Fight routine stripped and re-written + decent monsters added

    v1.4 Four different characters added + weapon/spell system added

    v1.5 Routine added to pick four characters from a list of 16
         characters + dialogue with houses added

    v1.6 Save/load game added

    v1.7 SFX added

    v1.8 major playtesting sessions and extreme bug-fixing sessions.

    v1.9 After comments from 1.8 various points reworked
         Instructions Redone
         Complete keyboard or joystick control possible
         Credits added

         custom team editor designed and implemented
         multiple save slots
         all levels designed
