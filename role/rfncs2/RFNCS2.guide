@{b}Introduction@{ub}

This program reads a text file and generates a number of random 
names from the information.

This is my second release of this program. The big change is the 
addition of a GUI. Admittedly it is a rather simple one. But then 
this is my first shot at creating and programing a GUI Interface.

I don't remember the exact place I found the original code, put 
it was listed as totally free. So I modified the original source 
code to run  on my Amiga. Since I had not done anything in C for 
awhile, this  seemed like a simple way to get back into it. The 
only name I found on  the original code was Johan Danforth. And 
in the spirit of that  original code, this is absolutely freeware 
and in the public domain.

As is usually the case, the author can not be held liable for any  
damage resulting from the use of this program. In other words, 
use it  solely at your own risk. I have used it on my A3000 and 
A500 with no  problems. I will not guarantee that it will work on 
other systems.

If you are reading this, you have already dearchived the files. 
Put RFNCS2 anywhere. Put the testfiles anywhere. Put the 
documentation anywhere. It is the suggestion of the author that 
it would probably be simplest and easiest to put everything in 
the same  directory.

That's about all there is to it.

@{b}Operation@{ub}

This program can be started from a command line or from its icon.  
It requires no arguments.

Click DoIt to run the program.

Enter the name of the data file in the file box. If the data file 
is in a different directory, you must enter its path also.

Enter the number of names to generate in the count box. Only 
numbers between 1 and 24 will be accepted.

The name files have the following Format:

Anything can go here
  [start]
    Up to 100 lines of data.
  [middle]
    Up to 100 lines of data.
  [end]
    Up to 100 lines of data. 
  [stop]
Anything can go here

Note that the sum of the longest lines in all fields must not 
total up to more than 15 characters.

@{b}Some Thoughts@{ub}

When generating name files, think about how the names should 
sound. Do names from certain regions or belonging to certain 
races have similar sounds? Are only certain sounds used at the  
start of a name?

For example if all males who come from region A have names that 
start with hard consent sounds, then only use Hard consent sounds 
in the [start] section of the name file.

Anything can be written before [start] and after [stop]. So these 
areas are good places to write some additional information about 
the name file.

Look at how the examples are laid out before writing your own 
name file.

This program will filter both <cr> and <lf> characters, so it 
should work with text files created on that other platform.

History

15DEC97  Release of Version 1.0

17APR98  Release of Version 2.24

For the future I would like to; add printer support, create a 
scrolling display, increase the size of names, improve the look 
of the graphical interface.
