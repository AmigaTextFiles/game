Dark Obsession
Version 1.0

Shareware Version

-Instructions

Introduction:

In this game, you play an emotionally disturbed individual involved with a
cheating wife, and a possible plot against your life. Unlike most
adventures, in this game the main character (the player) has
many negative attributes, some of which may be disturbing and violent.


To Begin Game:

Disk users:

If you have received this game in its' compressed format, Dark_Obsession.lha,
you will need to copy some Workbench files onto the game disk.
Decompress the game using LHA, and then copy the following files:

From WB: c/ copy, echo, run, stack, wait
to Dark_Obsession c:

From WB: devs/ ramdrive.device
to Dark_Obsession devs:

From WB: libs/ diskfont.library, icon.library
to Dark_Obsession libs 

Next use the install command to make the game bootable.
Simply boot the game disk and the game will start automatically.

Hard Drive Users:

If you received the game in its' compressed format, simply decompess
using LHA onto you hard drive.

If you received the game on disk, copy the entire disk onto your
hard drive, making sure you keep the same directory name,
Dark_Obsession.

Hard drive users have no need to copy Workbench files.

Once copied, simply click on the Begin_Game icon to start.

Gameplay:

After the game has loaded up, a brief introduction will be presented.
Your current location will be described through text, which includes
a menu at the bottom of the screen. The function keys provide commands
which can save time typing. The game accepts short verb-noun sentences,
such as Open the drawer or Talk to the man. Keep experimenting until
you find the correct terms for the commands you want. By using the function
keys, the user will find it much easier to play the game. You may notice
that certain objects in the game may not be interacted with, but are
described in the text. They are simply used to add more detail to your
current location.

The top left section of the screen provides several menus for saving,
loading, quitting, or starting a new game. To turn the background music
off, simply press both mouse buttons at the same time.

As you play this game, you will notice it is quite violent, and the
main character has a number of flaws in his nature 
(a bit of an understatement). I do not condone such actions in any way,
but have simply created a game from a different perspective than most 
other games. The main character is not sympathetic, and is a disturbed,
violent individual. The game itself was somewhat inspired from reading
too many EC horror comics, so it is not for the squeamish.

This version of the game may not be copied for commercial purposes.
