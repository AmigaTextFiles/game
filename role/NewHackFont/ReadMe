NetHack font with graphic monsters.

I haven't changed any of the existing character set, only 
added characters in the empty spaces.


To Use
======
Copy the hack.font file to your NetHack: directory and the
hack/8 file to your Nethack:hack/ directory.  To use the
new graphics you must replace the NetHack.cnf file in the
NetHack: directory.  Make sure to make backups of these files 
so that you can go back to them if you don't like the new 
graphics.


The file Font.Numbers indicates which character position is 
what.  You can use this to figure out which character to edit 
using Fed (the WB 1.3 font editor).

Happy hacking!
