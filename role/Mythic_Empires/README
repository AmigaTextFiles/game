Mythic Empires

This is the preview version of Mythic Empires. The game is full playable, but is
still in development. It's a multiplayer-network-strategie game. The goal is to
found cities, develop them and spread over the world with your armies and people.
To trade with your neighbors and fight your foes. It is somewhat base on the
well-known games empire, settlers, civilization and populous.

It's no action game. each player tells the computer what he likes to do in this
turn and, when all players are ready, the computerupdate will perform these
actions.

This program requires MUI3.2+ and Amitcp2+.
A Workbench running more than 16 colors is recommended but not required. On
standard display you should give the amigaclient a screenmode like

amigaclient SM="PAL:High Res Laced"

to open a screen with enough private colors.

It is also available for NeXTStep3.3. If you are interested in this version call
for it by (NeXT-)email: joerg@onevision.de

An X11 version is under development, but not estimated to be finished before August 96.

The archive contains the actual development binaries of server and client for the
amiga and a documentation in ASCII and DVI. Using the game without looking into the
documentation is not recommended.

I strongly urge you to test this game and send any comments about it to:

joerg.bublath@rz.fh-regensburg.d400.de
or
joerg@onevision.de

To get a real fast reply send to both, because I not always able to check both addresses
regulary, but only one.
