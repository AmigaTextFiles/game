Rogue (Amiga v1.1)
------------------

This is a version of Rogue, the ancestor of all hack-and-slash dungeon
games. Its direct descentdants include NetHack, Moria and Angband, and
games such as the Ultima series owe much to Rogue.

This version was written by Tim Stoehr, whose original "ReadMe" file is
included. Also included is "Rogue.man", a manual for playing Rogue. Note
that this being Amiga and the manual being written for Unix, there are some
slight differences between the manual and this Amiga version.

Tthe following tool types can be included in the icon:

	PLAYER		The name Rogue should use for the current
			player. The default is PLAYER=Player

	SAVEGAME	If the file specified is found, Rogue will use
			continue the game using this save file. If it
			cannot be found, Rogue will start a new game.

	PUBSCREEN	Only valid for Kickstart 2.04 or higher. This
			causes Rogue to open in a window on the default
			public screen. Rogue's display must be at least
			80 characters wide by 25 characters deep. Note
			that this means that a standard 640x200 screen
			with the topaz/8 font is not big enough.

If run from the Shell, the following options are valid:

	-s		Just display the scores then exit.

	-u		The name Rogue uses for the current player. The
			name should follow immediately after the switch,
			e.g.
				Rogue -uPlayer

	-p		Has the same effect as the "PUBSCREEN" tool type.
