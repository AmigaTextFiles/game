SHAREWARE INFORMATION:

For those who enjoy The Child Murderer, I am offering another one of
my horror games through mail order. The game is more complex than Child
Murderer and I am releasing it as a commercial product. It contains music
and digitized graphics, which takes up three disks. It will work okay
with single drive systems however, as I have cut the disk swapping down to a
minimum.


INNER DEMONS

The game available is titled "Inner Demons" and is an adventure in the
horror genre. In this game, the user is put inside the mind of a madman,
trying to deal with the hallucinations that from his reality. It uses a
text parser system for entering commands and simple sentences. Function keys
are used to cut down on the typing required.

The game takes up three diskettes, which includes full instructions
on disk. I will also send a copy of the game's solution, to those
who request it.  For those of you who are stuck in The Child Murderer
game and would like a copy of its' solution, simply request one and I will
send it out.

Due to the violent content in the game, it is recommended for mature
players only.


Inner Demons .... (3 Diskettes) $10.00

Requires: 1 MB Amiga, 2 drives recommended.

(Game solution available upon request).

Foreign Currencies accepted, so long as you are willing to send cash
through the mail. Foreign checks cost too much to convert.

(I accept cash, check or money order. Foreign Currencies accepted through
mail. Do not send foreign checks. If you decide to send foreign currency
please keep in mind the U.S. dollar conversion rates.)

Free Postage on all orders.

Also, I am looking for any artists or musicians who would like to
work on a future game (Amiga or IBM). Anyone who is interested can feel free
to write me or send samples of their work.

Please send orders or any correspondence to:
