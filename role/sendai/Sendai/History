==========
KNOWN BUGS
==========
	Certain computers may fail to run this game. It may have

something to do with memory, 1 Meg being the apparent cutoff point.

I'll need more info on this bug before I know for sure what 

configurations will trigger it.

	The save game routine is unsafe on AFS disks prior to

version 16.16. If this includes your HD, try playing from a FFS floppy.
