SAY Hello there, #VAR1#!
SAY Sorry about that. We didn't really need your name for anything important.
SAY That was just to show off the new string variable & user input features...
SAY Anyway, welcome to a new, exciting issue of The GRAAL Herald!
SAY This program should be easy enough to use.
SAY Just right-click on a topic in the list below to read it, or use the READ command on the left hand side combined with a topic name.
SAY Note that there are more subjects than fits in one screen - click the lighted arrows to scroll the list.
SAY Use the INDEX command to get back to this front page from where ever you happen to be.
SAY The yellow commands on the right hand side are only available in  the topic "New features mini-demo".
SAY See ya later!
