TYPE 3,20,10,40,NONE,As usual, the details are in the .readme file for
TYPE 3,20,10,50,NONE,2.1. I THINK I just may have hunted down and killed
TYPE 3,20,10,60,NONE,the largest, ugliest and most unpredictable bug I
TYPE 3,20,10,70,NONE,have ever come across in my programming career this
TYPE 3,20,10,80,NONE,time around! Oddly enough, no-one but me has ever
TYPE 3,20,10,90,NONE,reported it happening although it has been with us
TYPE 3,20,10,100,NONE,ever since version 1.0!
TYPE 3,20,10,115,NONE,As a result, GRAAL seems much more stable now - It
TYPE 3,20,10,125,NONE,doesn't seem to be thrashing the memory the way
TYPE 3,20,10,135,NONE,it used to after repetitive restarts anymore.
TYPE 3,20,10,145,NONE,Could we really be so lucky...?
TYPE 3,20,10,160,NONE,Apart from that, a big "thank you" to all who have
TYPE 3,20,10,170,NONE,written in and told me about some other bugs. I
TYPE 3,20,10,180,NONE,hope I haven't forgotten to fix any of them...
