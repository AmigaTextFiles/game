SAY Welcome to this mini-demo. It's very small indeed, but it shows a lot of interesting stuff.
SAY For example, We have already used the multiple inventories feature.
SAY The topics on the front page are in inventory 3, whereas I use inventory 1...
SAY ...which is currently empty, as you can see.
SAY The big thing, however, is the multiple character control.
SAY My new buddy, Thorfinn, is in the other room. You can switch control between us by clicking our names in the command area.
SAY When we talk to each other, you get a quick demo of room versus section dialogues.
SAY The "pick up" sound heard in this demo is an instant, pre-loaded effect.
SAY It can be heard along with the music because the tracker module only uses tracks 2-4. Track 1 is reserved for the sound effects.
SAY Also note that the tracker module is under BPM tempo control, and that it fades out nicely if you return to the index page.
SAY One more thing: Item "F" is a magic item.
SAY If I give the "F" to Thorfinn , he must follow me around until control is switched to him, and vice versa.
SAY Now test away!
