TYPE 2,21,-1,20,BORDER,Multiple inventories
TYPE 3,20,10,40,NONE,This subject is also covered in the GRAAL_Manual.
TYPE 3,20,10,50,NONE,However, it may be worthwhile to point out that
TYPE 3,20,10,60,NONE,multiple characters may not be the only reason to
TYPE 3,20,10,70,NONE,use multiple inventories: Perhaps you want to store
TYPE 3,20,10,80,NONE,different types of objects in different inventories
TYPE 3,20,10,90,NONE,although you only have one controllable character?
TYPE 3,20,10,105,NONE,The list of subjects on the front page of this
TYPE 3,20,10,115,NONE,GRAAL Herald is a fine example of how you can use
TYPE 3,20,10,125,NONE,GRAAL inventories as menus, for example.
TYPE 3,20,10,140,NONE,And sorry, no you can't have different layouts
TYPE 3,20,10,150,NONE,for different inventories. I have to draw the
TYPE 3,20,10,160,NONE,line somewhere!
