TYPE 2,21,-1,20,BORDER,Sound support
TYPE 3,20,10,40,NONE,Sadly, the quality of GRAAL sound support always
TYPE 3,20,10,50,NONE,depends on the quality of the Amos Pro sound and
TYPE 3,20,10,60,NONE,tracker commands available. The originals were
TYPE 3,20,10,70,NONE,bugged beyond belief, and some of the replacements
TYPE 3,20,10,80,NONE,available are not much better. However, the AMCAF
TYPE 3,20,10,90,NONE,extension which I recently acquired seems to do the
TYPE 3,20,10,100,NONE,job rather better than the rest, which is why
TYPE 3,20,10,110,NONE,a number of new features are now available, like
TYPE 3,20,10,125,NONE,- BPM tempo control and
TYPE 3,20,10,135,NONE,- Tracker module channel assignment.
TYPE 3,20,10,150,NONE,And oh yes, you can now pre-load up
TYPE 3,20,10,160,NONE,to two sound effects in graal.main for instant
TYPE 3,20,10,170,NONE,access and replay with the new SOUND command.
