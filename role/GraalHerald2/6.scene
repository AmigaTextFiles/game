TYPE 3,20,10,40,NONE,They said it couldn't be done - well, actually, the
TYPE 3,20,10,50,NONE,only one who said so was myself, and then I went
TYPE 3,20,10,60,NONE,and did it anyway. Very nicely it turned out, too.
TYPE 3,20,10,75,NONE,For a complete discussion, turn to the much revised
TYPE 3,20,10,85,NONE,GRAAL manual called GRAAL_Manual.text, which is
TYPE 3,20,10,95,NONE,included in the GRAAL 2.1 release. Some other loose
TYPE 3,20,10,105,NONE,text files have also been integrated into the
TYPE 3,20,10,115,NONE,manual, replacing all the old files: Prod.text, 
TYPE 3,20,10,125,NONE,editor.text and GRAAL_Tutorial.text.
