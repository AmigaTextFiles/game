TYPE 2,21,-1,20,BORDER,Welcome to GRAAL 2.1!
TYPE 3,20,10,40,NONE,Well, here we are again - another GRAAL release.
TYPE 3,20,10,50,NONE,Although perhaps not as big a leap forward as
TYPE 3,20,10,60,NONE,2.0 was compared to 1.2, I have still managed to
TYPE 3,20,10,70,NONE,add quite a nice bunch of major enhancements.
TYPE 3,20,10,85,NONE,Because the basic demo included in the delivery
TYPE 3,20,10,95,NONE,package can't be updated with all the new goodies
TYPE 3,20,10,105,NONE,for each release - my God, it would become a
TYPE 3,20,10,115,NONE,mess! - I felt a new issue of this very special
TYPE 3,20,10,125,NONE,disk mag was needed to fill the gap. It isn't
TYPE 3,20,10,135,NONE,very big, but then again, all it is here for is
TYPE 3,20,10,145,NONE,to tell you about and show off the new 2.1
TYPE 3,20,10,155,NONE,features. In fact, I hope you spend more time
TYPE 3,20,10,165,NONE,looking at the scripts than looking at this!
TYPE 3,1,-1,190,NONE,Always right-click or press [.] to continue!

TYPE 2,21,-1,20,BORDER,Stepping Through...
TYPE 3,20,10,40,NONE,One of the best ways to really see what each
TYPE 3,20,10,50,NONE,command does is to use the new single-step trace
TYPE 3,20,10,60,NONE,mode while running GRAAL. This is how to do it:
TYPE 3,20,10,75,NONE,1. Press the [G] key to call up the monitor.
TYPE 3,20,10,90,NONE,2. Click the <Trace> button.
TYPE 3,20,10,105,NONE,3. Click the <Back to GRAAL> button.
TYPE 3,20,10,120,NONE,4. Now all the commands and conditions GRAAL
TYPE 3,20,10,130,NONE,   executes will first be shown at the top of
TYPE 3,20,10,140,NONE,   the screen, waiting for a keypress from you.
TYPE 3,20,10,150,NONE,   (The full stop [.] key is recommended, 
TYPE 3,20,10,160,NONE,   because it also allows you to skip pauses.)
TYPE 3,20,10,175,NONE,5. To exit the trace mode, repeat steps 1-3.
TYPE 3,20,10,190,NONE,Enough of this. Go explore already!
