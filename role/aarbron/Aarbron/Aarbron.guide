@NODE intro
@title Introduction

 The Chronicles of Aarbron initially started life on the @{"PC" link pc} - as a programing project for the course we were on. But with two of us being Amiga owners it was decided that an Amiga version would follow.

However neither of use had much experiance programing on the Amiga and so it was decided that an adventure creating program would be used. We chose @{"CAG" link cag}, mainly because Simon had used it to create another game called @{"The Elven Crystals" link elven}. This means that me (Duncan) didn't have much to do with the Amiga version except beta test it, and write this guide.

@title Running the game.
 The directory structure looks some thing like this:

                    Aarbron
            ___________|___________
           |           |           |
        Aarbron1    Aarbron2    Aarbron3

Simply change into the directory you want and type Aarbron1, Aarbron2 or Aarbron3 according to what directory you're in.

It is recommened that you play Aarbron1 first, then once you've completed it, play Aarbron2, then Aarbron3.

@title System specs

Any Amiga with 1Mb or more should do fine.

It has been tested on:

Simons miggy:
A1200
2Mb ram
520 Mb Hard disk
1 external floppy
1084 Monitor

Duncans miggy:

A1200
6Mb
120Mb Hard disk :-(
1 external floppy
VIDI Amiga digitizer (like it would make a differance)
1084 Monitor

@{"UAE" link uae}

It will not work if you use a SVGA monitor, unless you use some mode promotion software.
Graphics cards may cause a problem. We cant be sure about this becaue we dont have one.
Future Amigas. As @{"CAG" link cag} was written in @{"AMOS" link amos} we cannot be sure that Aarbron will work on future Amigas.

Hello to all you out there in Computerland. This is just a short info message
about myself. I LIKE AD&D. So there. I've said it. I'm not a geek
but I like RPGs. And Amigas. I love my A1200. So all you PC owners
out there can like it. I also like Cthulhu stories. And gamebooks. And J.R.R.
Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. But not the film so much. I'm running out of
interesting things to say. What else? I like smilies ;-)
                Do you know this one? 8-0 `-{====*
I also like Fantasy films. Have you seen THE BEASTMASTER film (1982)?
Or HAWK THE SLAYER (1980)? CONAN THE BARBARIAN (1981)? CONAN THE DESTROYER
(1984)? I think they are better than the crap you get with Jim Carrey in
all the time.
Magnamund is (C) 1984-97 Joe Dever in his Lone Wolf Gamebooks, but
its such a good name we decided to borrow it for our world.
Have a good time with Aarbron Chronicles. Incidentally Aarbron was the
character in Shadow of the Beast games. Bet you didn't know that.
@endnode
@node duncan
Hi, greets to all enjoying the universe of Magnamund (where Aarbron is set).
This is a short text about me (I'm being forced to write this crap). Like
@{"Simon (weenie) Osborne" link simon} I too own a A1200 (had an Amiga since 1989!). You can
visit "www.geocities.televisioncity/5744" 'cos it has lots of pictures, of
Star Trek, Star Wars, the X-files and any other Sci-fi stuff I can find (it
sort of reflects my own interests). I also have a @{"PC" link pc}. Oh and the last time
@{"Carl" link carl} used an Amiga was over 4 years ago, and that was to play Streetfighter.
If anyone wants to convert it to another format (UNIX, Mac etc..) then send
an e-mail to us.
@endnode
@node carl
Yo Lamers! I hate writing about myself but seeing as the other two have I
suppose I must what can I say I like Star Trek even some of the one with
Willam (I can't act) Shatner which @{"Simon" link simon} & @{"Dunc" link duncan} think are crap, I also like
Star Wars (George Lucas is A God !!!!) and the Special Editions were
Excellent even though @{"Oz" link simon} hasn't seen Empire or ROJ (slack!). I like reading
cool stuff like by Steven Jackson, J.R.R. Tolkien and Terry Pratchett!
Death rocks the party.

@node pissed
We were thinking about putting this trilogy out as shareware, but as we had
ripped the graphics from commercial games, we would be dangerous copyright
grounds, and F.A.S.T would be breathing down our necks ready to lock us in
chains and throw away the keys, so we place this in the Public Domain as
Lager-ware. If you like these games, please send some lager to:

                Lion Software c/o Simon Osborne
                9 Charnwood Road
                Hinckley
                Leics
                LE10 1PX
                England

and we will drink to your memory. If you want, please feel free to send
photographs of yourselves also, so we can see what YOU look like ;-) and / or
a postcard from where you live. This will be particularly interesting if you
live outside the UK. We are very interested to see how far our humble work
travels.
