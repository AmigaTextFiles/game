A Matter of Time

This game is an introductory level adventure using a simple keyboard
interface. There is no need to type in commands or the names of objects to
control the game. Simply select a key from the selection of options
available and press return.

The puzzles in the game were kept purposely simple, as the game is designed
with the beginning adventure player in mind.


Special thanks to Vivian McAlexander who worked on some of the artwork,
(several very nice ray-traced and character screens).

Those who are interested in 3D artwork can order some of Vivian's
3D textures at a very low price. You can write to her at:
