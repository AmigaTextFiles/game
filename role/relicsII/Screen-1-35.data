This place seems dedicated to a most hidious looking creature.  A brain for eyes is just not natural!

Battery Slot
The battery slot is well situated to be replaced by a smaller floor bound robot.  Identical to the robot in the storage room.

You know, I can`t help but think this is the recharger from my home?  It even has the small coffee stain running down the side!  Weird!

My laserpen almost vibrates from the refreshing surge of native power.  My laserpen now ready FULL!
