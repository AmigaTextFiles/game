The most captivating feature has to be the huge gold doors.  Very tempting.

With power I could destroy the whole wall...But alas, my laserpen is bare.  That is, no power!
Why? I`ve created as big a hole as I`m prepared to risk.  Anymore, and anything could happen.  Huge hidden monsters...Hull breach...Ripping the fabric of reality...ANYTHING!
If I thought for one minute he`d drink it and die, I would give it over.  But I`m just not sure.
Sure, throw it all over the poor fellow.  If he wants it, I`ll give it to him, not throw it at him!
It doesn`t open when I push it?  Must be another way!
