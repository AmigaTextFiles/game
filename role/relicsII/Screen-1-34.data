Dispenser
If plastic tape could be eaten, this would be a food dispenser.  I know it's not funny, but it's true.

The metal ball, whatever it may be, seems now to be receiving power!
I hear something from the metal ball...`Sleeping Dome Active...Security forcefields not responding...Ready to accept droid for sleep mode'.
The optiwire needs something to bind it to the lead!
The grounded lead has melted to the metal floor. If a connection is going to be made, I`ll need more wire!
