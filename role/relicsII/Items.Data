Fluffy Dice
No luxury space vehicle is perfect without a pair of these fluffy dice.  Illegal, but cute!

Magnet
The magnet is lightweight but VERY powerful.  I can feel it`s pull on my fillings.
The magnet flies the short jump from my hand to the belt buckle.

Belt
The belt is riddled with curious control things.  All seem to be out of power.  The only practical component is the quite excellent example of crafted metalwork on the belt buckle.
The magnet jumps the small gap between my hand and the metal belt buckle.

Energy Cell
The pack has to be the most simplest device of any advanced species.  The capacitor has the ability to store a charge for various lengths of time.  This rather large capacitor is quite empty!

Spangley Object
It has pronglike metal sticks, poking out of it.  It looks like slimey metal and is grey in colour.  Hmm, doesn`t suggest anything to me!

Tape
It's a very sticky plastic role of plastic tape.
I wrap the tape around the wire to repair the loose connections.  The wire is now quite sticky.

Optiwire
It`s a fair length of electric opto cable.
Using the tape, I repair the optiwire by taping the loose connections poking out of the wire.  It's getting rather sticky.

Paper
The material has been torn from a sheet of insulator behind the wall.  If feels very much like a paper we used on Deldronis for smoothing wood!

The Venturi school never taught me how to attack such things.
My Venturi training, I am ashamed to say, did not prepare me in the ways of fighting THAT!
Although my training suggests over ten ways to murder the aforementioned entity, I feel it is not appropriate.
Destroying things should be for recreation only, not while I`m on duty.
My laserpen should not be used fruitlessly.
I believe there is another solution, without resorting to THAT!
