DEMO VERSION DOCUMENT
---------------------
No Install Software is available with the demo version as there really
isn't much point.  The following document has been left on the disk if
you feel confident enough to manually install this demo.  Lord knows
why you might wish to do so, but hey, maybe 5 scenes is plenty for
some of you?!?

Installing Relics
-----------------
Some machines use hard drives that do not use DH0: as their main HD device
and the INSTALLER will not work straight away on these machines.  I have
used DH0: only as a default.  If you use AQ0: or HD0:, or some other type
then simply replace all occurances of DH0: with your own device.  Simple!

Hard Drive Relics
-----------------
Some machines, say an A1200 with no FASTRAM will use a significant amount
of CHIPRAM to run Workbench.  This takes memory needed by Relics to run
fully, thus may not run completely and crash out at any time.

I recommend you A1200 owners to reset your computer, holding both mouse
buttons until you receive the system menu.  BOOT WITHOUT STARTUP-SEQUENCE
and you will be given a CLI window, type:

Cd Dh0:Relics-BookTwo
Execute s/startup-sequence

This will run Relics if you have not changed any of the installer devices
or moved the Relics draw.  If you have moved the draw, simply change the
directory to where-ever you have placed it, and simply type:

Execute s/startup-sequence

to run the game.  If you have changed DH0: to that of your own device,
simply change the device declared in the line:

cd DH0:relics-booktwo

Plenty of text to guide you through a VERY simple process.  As long as you
are in the main Relics-BookTwo directory, and NO chip memory has been taken
up by other software, the game will run without a hitch.
