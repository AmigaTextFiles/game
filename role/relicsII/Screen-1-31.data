The oil creeps slowly into the small container.
The surface is now abit more tough.  What if I tried the laserpen on it?  A dull surface may not as easily reflect!
No way!  This door is as reflective as a mirror.  Ever tried firing a laser at a mirror?  Well, you'd only find out once!
No handle.  No keyhole.  No nout!  How do I open the door?
