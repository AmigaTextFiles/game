Aminet, Fred Fish, and all other CD (or any other storage method for that matter) compilation creators may, nay, must!, use this in their collection. @{b}ON ONE (sorry, two) HEFTY CONDITIONS:@{ub}

            1. The archive must not be changed. In any way.

@node "WhatUseHasThisCrapThing" "What is this?"

@{b} It looks nice, but WHAT is it?@{ub}

Err. Well. If you don't know what @{b}Shadowrun@{ub} or @{b}Matrix@{ub} is, then I'm afraid you have been fooled. You should have read the readme file, anyway. Ofcourse it could also be that you've read some cyberpunk novels (esp "Neuromancer") and recognised the word @{b}Matrix@{ub}, and thought that this is a game offering you a true 3D texture mapped sight of the@{b} Matrix@{ub}, etc. But alas, then you are fooled as well.

But for all you chummers out there, who are well aware of what the @{b}Matrix@{ub} is: this is a @{fg shine}Security DataSheaf Generator@{fg shadow}@{fg text} for the second edition of the @{b}Shadowrun Matrix@{ub} rules. (I know, I know, the name of the program isn't exactly correct, but you'll have to admit it sounds more appealing than "Security DataSheaf Generator" (which would probably lead to even more misunderstandings).

Now, go back to @{"<contents>" link "Main" 0} and learn how to use it.

@node "Use" "Agreed. Now I know what it is, but I cannot use it."


                                 @{b}@{u}TUTORIAL@{ub}@{uu}

@{u}1. Installation@{uu}

No special files are required to run this program, apart from @{"MUI" LINK "Mui"}, that is. Unpack the archive to any directory you want.

@{u}2. Starting up.@{uu}

Go to wherever you've unpacked the archive to and type 'MatGen', omitting the quotes.

Usage: MatGen D=DEBUG/S

When the DEBUG switch is specified, MatGen will print relevant debugging information to a CON: window. See @{"<Bugs>" LINK "Bugs"} for details.

@{u}3. Using the program.@{@{uu}@{uu}

Set the Intrusion Difficulty (Keyboard ShortCut: i) and the Host Security Code (Keyboard ShortCut: s) and click on Create (Keyboard ShortCut: c). A DataSheaf will pop up. Now you can save ("Save Datasheaf") or print ("Print Datasheaf") it. Hard, or what? If you're not pleased with the result, just Create another Sheaf.

---
NB: Clicking "Create" while the Datasheaf window is still open will fill in the new datasheaf in the same window, ie the dimensions will not change. This could bother very picky people. If you are that kind of human, then close the DataSheaf window before creating another one.

NB: Printing consists of a direct dump through "PRT:". Printing has not been tested, but I cannot see why it should ever fail.

                                       -- The Author.


@{b}
@{b}1. Hey! Wot a lousy programmer you are! It doesn't make it's own PartyIC.@{ub}

Yes yes, ok, I know. Maybe I will, one day, include an IC constellation constructor.

@{b}2. What is that DEBUG switch?@{ub}

It's a tool for me (and, incidentally for you too) to check whether MatGen is compliant with the Virtual Realities 2.0 rules. To see how it works, let's look at an example output. (NB: An easy way of assuring a debug log is by starting up MatGen like this: 'MatGen DEBUG >filename'. All debugging info will then be streamed or piped into the specified file. But I guess you knew that already.)

For terms etcetera, see p159ff. of VR 2.0

Modifier=4. @{i}This is the modifier derived from the host Security Code@{ui}
Easy/Blue/4 --> Min/Max Gap between steps=5/7.
@{i}Intrusion Difficulty/Security (Color) Code/Security Value@{ui}
------
Trigger Step=5 ; # Steps=1.
@{i}This is self-explanatory.@{ui}
Modified Roll=3.
@{i}The roll to determine which type of IC is triggered.@{ui}
Reactive White [IC rating:  4]
@{i}Type of IC and its rating.@{ui}

... @{i}And so on.@{ui}

This debugging option is very basic, but that is because it initially only was implemented for own usage. I decided to leave it in the final executable, just because, well, it does no harm, does it?

@{b}3. Strange characters appear upon loading the DataSheaf is some editors.@{ub}

Yes. That is true. I don't know why, but it appears MUI's control codes aren't very err... @{i}universal@{ui}. I hoped the logs would turn out to be ANSI texts with the control codes in it, but alas. Mind that PPMore and the DirOpus reader (to name a few) read the Sheafs without a problem.

If you'd like me to remove the control codes, or perhaps include an option to (de)activate them, tell @{"me" LINK "Moi"}.

There are undoubtedly more bugs (remember,@{i} I @{ui}have written this), but I haven't found them yet. Report to @{"me" LINK "Moi"} if you do.

@node "history" "This program has a history. So respect it."

Try to understand this:

Some two years ago: @{b}@{u}Matrix Generator 2.0@{ub}@{uu}

Written in AMOS Pro. Here's an excerpt from the Guide:
@{i}
Maybe I'll make a MUI Matrix Generator one day (for I have evolved away from AMOS - ain't I a smart feller?), maybe I'll make a game someday concerning the Matrix, maybe I'll come over to your place and eat your cat. Who knows. It all depends on whether @{b}YOU@{ub} write or not...

Nah, just kidding.
@{ui}
Well, exactly @{b}one@{ub} person wrote in to say he was pleased to find this particular piece of software. (Luckily I didn't make it shareware). And I @{i}did@{ui} make a MUI Matrix Generator. So I @{i}wasn't@{ui} kidding. 

Was I disappointed? No. Because it was mentioned in Amiga Computing, March 1997 issue! Great, or what? AND it had good review too. Just to state my case, and not to blow my trumpet, here goes an(other) excerpt:
@{i}
Shadowrun GMs will therefore consider the Matrix Generator something of a godsend - in a matter of seconds it can generate an entire computer system (...) Whilst it clearly caters for an extremely small number of people, this is the sort of simple but useful program that the Public Domain was made to house.
@{ui}
AC did manage to refer to the wrong file on Aminet and they printed a very ugly screenshot as well. I threatened to chop off both the reviewer's legs if he didn't rectify the erroneous filename, but it didn't work. I didn't even get a reply...

And here's another excerpt from the MatrixGenerator 2.0 Guide:
@{i}
But when I come round to coding a MUI version, it'll be completely bug-free and the constellation thingies will be in there too. And perhaps even more...
@{ui}
So, if @{b}two@{ub} persons write in now and if Amiga Inc. recognises my considerable donation to the Amiga community with a large amount of hard cash (magazine recognition isn't enough anymore!), perhaps I will make a include room for Party IC. Or do you @{i}still@{ui} think I'm kidding? @{i}Eh@{ui}?

@{u}@{b}MatGen 0.1 (04/05/98):@{uu}@{ub}

The start of the MUI MatGen. I'm preparing my exams, so that is why I began to write this (out of boredom) and why completing it took so long.

@{b}@{u}MatGen 0.9 (12/05/98):@{uu}@{ub}

It's ready, but the source is illegible. Honest.

@{b}@{u}MatGen 1.0 (16/05/98):@{uu}@{ub}

MAJOR speedup (though hardly noticeable, as it created DataSheafs in less than a second even in AMOS Pro).
Quase-legible source.
Writing of Guide and Archiving results in loss of time better spent in studying.
      
@{b}@{u}MatGen 1.1 (06/06/98):@{uu}@{ub}

Thanks to @{i}Trey@{ui} (I'm sorry, but I couldn't find any more info on the author's name) and his @{b}stayrandom@{ub} E Module, random now really means random. Thanks Trey!
Upload to Aminet.
Changed Task Priority in order to prevent it from hogging the system.
