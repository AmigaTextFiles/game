Changes to AmigaMUD from the V0.6 version uploaded to Aminet.


mud.library:

    - fixed to not ask for a creation password if that password is
	the empty string (broken by V0.5)

    - upped the version to 0.7 (7)


MUDServ:

    - fixed the parameter to a "Lock" called used on the database file.
	This prevented MUDServ from running on a MultiUser filesystem.

    - request proper version of mud.library

    - made the icon request a stack size of 25000


MUD:

    - request proper version of mud.library

    - added menu items for serial speeds 57600 and 115200

    - added support for OwnDevUnit.library (ODU)

    - fixed a connection bug introduced in V0.5

    - fixed a connection bug, sometimes causing a crash.
	At least, I hope I fixed it. It isn't exactly reproducable.
