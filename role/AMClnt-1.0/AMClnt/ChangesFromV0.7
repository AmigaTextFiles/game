MUDServ:

    Added one to the size of the buffer used for ReadFile. The old
    version would get in trouble with an input line of length > 511
    characters. (No space reserved for the NUL at the end!)

    Server would die if you 'display'ed a nil list. Fixed that, and
    made it much more paranoid about nil values.

    Slightly improved the error reporting when parsing Verb2 commands.

    Deleting symbols from tables, whether via builtin "DeleteSymbol",
    or using the 'delete' wizard-mode command, was completely broken.
    It's fixed now.

    Added builtin "ScanTable" to allow scanning the symbols in a table.

    Added new initial string parameter "alternateName" to "Say",
    "Pose", and "Whisper". If not empty string, then is used instead
    of the name of the active character.

    Added builtin "ForEachClient" to allow scanning of the active
    clients.

    Added builtin "QueryFile", which allows a scenario to check for a
    file under AmigaMUD: on the client system.

    Found an "out by one" error when freeing lists of things or actions.
    This could have caused random failures.

    Renamed some builtins:

	OpenFileForRead -> FileOpenForRead
	OpenFileForWrite -> FileOpenForWrite
	CloseFile -> FileClose
	ReadFile -> FileRead
	WriteFile -> FileWrite

    and added some more: FileOpenForUpdate, FileReadBinary,
    FileWriteBinary, FileSeek

    Added "SetPrefix" builtin.

    Added "SetMachineOther" builtin, and the code to enable it.

    Fixed an off-by-one error when deleting a list. This bug may have
    been recently created, so this fix may not affect any released
    versions of MUDServ.


mud.library:

    Allow three tries at entering a character name.

    Change all occurences of 'player' during login to 'character'.

    Added support for the QueryFile operation.


MUDServ & mud.library:

    Modified password changing so that the old password is needed in
    order to change the player password.
    NOTE: this is an incompatible change, in that an old client
    mud.library will not work with a new MUDServ!


MUDAgent:
    Added '-h' flag, which is equivalent to "-a -td1". This is useful
    for hardwired connections.

    Fixed a small (100 byte per run) memory leak.


MUD:
    Fixed display of brushes that had no masking.

    Fixed things so that MUD won't try to use more rows or columns than
    are supposed to be available. This was happening wrong on my A4000T
    when in maximum double-NTSC overscan. This may cause it to run a
    smaller screen than it could in some other larger modes, however.
    Better safe than sorry, I figure.

    Put in checking of values of command-line and tooltype flags.


SMUD:
    added -p flag which selects "polling mode". In this mode, SMUD
    polls for input characters from the player. This allows it to not
    have a read request outstanding all the time, and so can be shut
    down by a NukeClient call in the server. This is useful for those
    who are unfortunate enough to have a BBS that cannot use MUDAgent
    for connections to clients.

    added -n flag which makes SMUD convert all output newlines into
    carriage-return/linefeed sequences. This was requested by a BBS
    user.


Scenario:

    Made command aliases work for players other than SysAdmin.

    r_provingTunnel3 in tp_proving2 needed thing status ts_wizard.
    It had status ts_private, and was inherited by a bunch of rooms
    in the goblin city area. This causes "thing is not readable by
    others" errors in that area. (e.g. giving things, entering or
    exiting the game there).

    Used effects subroutines for all of the building button-sets.

    Made roads C_TAN like paths, instead of C_BROWN.

    Added a ring road around the town.

    Made lighting a lamp/torch/etc. give a message to the character,
    and another to all observers. Made extinguish give a message to
    the character.

    Fixed a problem with tracker monsters (e.g. the tracker spiders)
    where the die checker was not being added to the player, and so
    was not being executed if the player was killed.

    Added routine "Paginate" (and helpers) which attempts to print a
    long string in several pages. It is currently used when reading
    things.

    Using the new "SetMachineOther" facility, made:
	- anything happening in the minimall is echoed in SysAdmin's
	    Study, prefixed by "MM: "
	- anything in the Proving Grounds sewer location with the slot
	    in the wall is echoed to the room behind the slot
	- stuff is echoed between the location on both sides of the
	    grating on the end of the sewer

    Added the "follow" and "unfollow" commands, where a player can
    follow another player or a machine.


Documentation:

    updates for new builtins

    added "Declarations" section to Programming.txt. Oops!

    removed the "not working" note from "SetMachinesActive" and
    replaced it with a description of what the flag actually does.
