@NODE playing "How To Play"
@{BG SHINE}
    introduction
@{BG BACK}
A virus as infectious as a cold but as deadly as the plague swept this land, killing almost everyone. Where this virus came from is a total mystery. As yet, there are no known cures.

In a desperate attempt to control the spreading disease, government army forces began attacking the villages that housed the sick. Thousands of anti-personnel land mines were placed in order to stop contagious people from escaping the war zone. Millions of people were killed.

The government now plans to air-strike the entire diseased area. It will only be a matter of time before you are hit. You are the only survivor for miles, and you must escape.
@{BG SHINE}
    getting started
@{BG BACK}
If playing TimeBombs from floppy disk then turn off your Amiga for around 30 seconds, insert the TimeBombs disk #1 into your internal disk drive (DF0:) and turn on back on. The game should now boot.

If playing TimeBombs from your hard disk or CD ROM then double click the `TimeBombs' icon. The game should then run.

Make sure a controller in plugged into the joy port of your amiga.
@{BG SHINE}
    playing the game
@{BG BACK}
In order to escape from each level you must find a set number of keys which are scattered around in various places. As the levels progress there is either more keys to collect or they are harder to find. Once you have collected all of the keys you must then find the teleporter which will take you off to the next level. 

Failure to collect all of the keys and find the teleporter before the time runs out will result in the level being air-striked and you loosing a life. 

@{BG SHINE}    go for the coins@{BG BACK}

Collecting coins and other various bonuses will give you points. An extra life is awarded at every 50,000 points. Your score will also be recorded if you gain an entry on the high score table.

* Extra lives are not awarded in this demo.

@{BG SHINE}    tactics@{BG BACK}

The best method for completing a level is to find all of the keys FIRST. Once you have collected all of the keys and located the end-of-level teleporter, you can then spend the rest of your time hunting for bonuses etc.

@{BG SHINE}    find the cure@{BG BACK}

The deadly virus, which is suspected of originating from the usage of Microsoft's windows 98 software(!) can only be cured by seven sacred Amiga Boing Balls. These balls, the symbol of true Amiganism are worth 5000 points each.

@{BG SHINE}    look for secrets!@{BG BACK}

Remember to keep an eye out for suspicious looking patterns or items on the ground etc. You never know - it may be a secret! :)

@{BG SHINE}    controls@{BG BACK}
