@node legal " Read this and take note, everybody!"

Ok, here we go...This software may be distributed freely, as long as no files are changed or added. The program and files are included AS-IS, and that means that anything weird happens, you're the one to blame, not me. The files have been checked for viruses, but no virus-free guarantee is provided. You are in no possesion to change, add to or hack any of the files included. Enjoy the game instead of poking around.

This game is shareware, and that means that if you like Madhouse, then you should pay the registration fee of (a mere) £3 or the same amount in NOK. Checks or money, but no credit cards or animals are accepted. Oh, by the way, click on @{"this button" link address} to see my address and stuff!

@node whatis " What the heck is Madhouse?"

Madhouse - indian spirit (to give its full name) is a graphical adventure for any Amiga equipped with 2 Mb of ram and a hard disk. It's to big to be played from floppy, so you MUST @{"install it!" link install}

Madhouse was programmed in AMOS pro and compiled with the 'Pro compiler. If you think that AMOS programs can't be good, let this one change your mind. It includes hand-drawn graphics, soothing music and over 100 frames of animation! And it is rather funny too!

@node install " Let's install the damn thing!"

I haven't been able to write an installation script yet, so we'll have to do it the old-fashioned way. OK, here's the To-Do-List:

1. Copy the drawer "Madhouse" to where you want the game to be installed.
2. When that's done, you must add two assigns in you startup-sequence. These should look something like this:

assign Madhouse1: harddiskname:wherever you put the Madhouse drawer
assign Madhouse2: harddiskname:wherever you put the Madhouse drawer

4. Now reboot the machine with three fingers, locate the Madhouse drawer on your HD, double-click on the Madhouse icon and enter a insanely stupid world!

@endnode

@node controls " The controls in the game"

Unlike other graphic adventures, this one is controlled by a joystick in port 2. If you push the stick left, you character goes left. If you push it to the right, he goes right. Quite simple, that. Madhouse incorporates an I.C.O.M. system, which is an abbreviasion for Intelligent Character Object Manipulation. If you want to pick up an object, you press the joystick button. The character knows what to do, so he'll do it for you. No messing around with 477 commands just to examine a condom.

When that's said, bear in mind that Madhouse is not a puzzle game - it's an adventure, where you experience things, do things, and above all - have fun!

@{b}Important note! @{ub} Never, ever hold down the joystick button! This causes text to disappear before you've read it and other horrible things. So tap it, gently, like patting the head of a small fish.

@{b}Another important note! @{ub} In the introduction-sequence, you press any key on the keyboard to skip to the next line! Again, gently!

@node story " The background story..."

Greg Kapschnitz is the young janitor on the Valverdance Mental Instituition. The dream of his life (and indeed, night) is to cruise around on a large Blardbird Motorcycle, with the beautiful sister Rina at the back. Sadly, this is a dream he can't afford, and he therfore heads to the boss for a raise. This is where the story begins, as you guide and lead young Greg through an insane world filled with bad guys, good guys, and, for most of the time, completely and utterly mad people...

@node future " About tomorrow, next week, next year..."

Well, I haven't recieved @{b}any @{ub} feedback on this game, even if it was released to PD-companies more than half a year ago! That dissapointed me a bit. Hmm...anyway I hope that it will change with this nice Amigaguide manual. If people report to me with suggestions, bugs, improvements (improvements?) and so on, I would become an extremely happy man. I'll even consider continuing with another project which will be approx. 350 % better than this game (in every department)!

If you want that game, register and let me know! My adress @{"is right here" link address}

Anyway, this game took almost a year to complete (ok, I am lazy, but not as much as certain politicians!), so the new game won't appear before, say, 23.00 P.M. some day in the future...

@node sex " Well, not really..."

Actually, that was bit of a lie. I just thought that it would make you read this message, which goes:@{b} Register now, live tomorrow! @{ub}
