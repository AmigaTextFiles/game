* battle-story.. (end-monsters say something after the 4th battle round,
		 (then you can use an item.. and then cast a spell and..)

and much more....

maybe you will not find everything in the game, because, i didnt do
a special DEMO-version, where all abilities of the game are showed...
(e.g. the battle-storying...)
some maps really look messed up... this is due i changed the gfx-tile-files
but didnt convert the maps.. dont care...
actually i will NOT finish the game... my main gfx-artist seemed to stop all
his activitys and i have noone to make all the mapfiles... so..
if YOU say, you are a great designer and roleplayer and YOU want to do it..
just contact me... if there are any soft-ware companies out there who are
intrested in buying or supporting the game, contact me...
aehm.. by the way.. the whole game is german... if somebody want, i can
translate it to english... just ask for it...


KNOWN BUGS:

* the shop may not work correctly.. (actually only the damn item selector!)

* may crash in battle due to blitting somewhere into mem... 

if you think you found a bug, contact me....
