Bloodfest V22 (29.10.1995)
--------------------------


General info & history
----------------------

Bloodfest V19 was Mellow Chips' contribution to the Amiga Format AMOS
programming competition. It was made during the spring -95 under
high pressure. Written using AMOS Professional and compiled
using Amos Pro Compiler.

Version V20 was a later update.
The main differences between versions V19 and V20 were:
 * only 3 disks instead of 4 because of the new packing routines
 * faster loading speed
 * some spelling mistakes fixed in the game and in this readme file

Version V22 (this one) has even better compression routines
than the V20 and therefore the game has only 2 disks. The compression
was achieved using Turbo Imploder routines by P.Struijk & A.Brouver.
Some minor bugs were also splatted.

System requirements
-------------------

This game needs lots of chip ram because of the heavy load of graphics and
sound effects. It has been tested on A1200 (2 megs of chip ram) and
it works fine. It may work on B2000 and other models with 1 megabyte of
chip ram and with some fast ram, but due to the limited time we haven't
tested it throughly. Worth trying though!

Harddisc is not neccessarily neeeded but very recommended.


Installation
------------

Unpack the lha files on two disks. Bloodfest1.lha should be
extracted to a disk labeled Bloodfest1 and Bloodfest2.lha
on Bloodfest2.

If you're going to play this game on floppies, you should also
format a disk and label it 'BloodfestSave'. When you decide
to save your game click on the disk icon in the game panel
and follow the instructions on the screen.


Harddisk installation
---------------------

This is very easy. Just copy all the files from the disks to 
any directory in your hd. No assigns are needed. Click on the
icon to start the game.
