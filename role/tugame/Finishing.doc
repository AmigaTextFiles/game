Now, for the secret to finishing.  You can't!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!  I was gonna make it so you would have to
find a key, but after about getting 3/4 of the way thru it, I changed my
mind.  Don't despair, you won't have to reboot to get out of the game.
Just press <CTRL>-c (hold down the CTRL key and press c), then hit return
and that will abort the program.

Some of you will probably find this a mean, underhanded, sneaky low blow.
Well, it is. :-)
Anything else I write will *most-likely* not be this way.  I just wanted
to do this to be different.

Anyway, till next time.
