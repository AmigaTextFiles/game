Welcome to my very first Amiga C project.

About Me:
I'm Todd Courtnage, a 3rd year university student at the University of
Regina, in Regina, Sask., Canada.  I'm majoring in computer science.

About my game:
    Title:  Totally Useless Game
    Etc:  You somehow get locked inside this house.  The idea of the game is
          to explore the house and try and find a way out.  Make sure you
          explore EVERYTHING there is to explore.  And, naturally, as is the
          case with most maze type games, the way to get out, will be
          farthest part from where you start.
    Details:  It was programmed using Matt Dillon's DICE C compiler, v2.06.21,
              unregistered version (I'll register RSN, Matt (ya, like you'll
              be reading this file and playing this stupid game :-)))


I tried to make this game humorous.  I think it is anyway.  That was my
number one priority in writing this game.  There are absolutely no
graphics, and absolutely no sound, but, to a certain extent, alot to
explore.  There are 20 rooms in the house, and in some rooms, there can
be quite a bit to do.  Make sure you explore EVERY possibility, because
there is humor to be found in many places.

Setting Up the Game
*******************
This is a CLI only game.  I haven't learned how to open up new windows
and screens yet (hey, it's only my first program!).  Open a CLI and make it
as large as the screen, or else you won't be able to play it very good (lots
of important stuff will scroll by to quickly in a small window and then be
lost forever).  Once you have your CLI (or shell) setup, just type in the name
of the program, and you're away.  In each room, you'll be given a list
of possible things to do, numbered from 1 to however many choices there are.
Just type in number and hit return.

FINISHING THE GAME
******************

I've included a separate text file that tells how to finish the game.
DON'T LOOK AT THIS FILE, UNTIL YOU'RE SURE YOU HAVE EXPLORED EVERY NOOK
AND CRANNY OF THE HOUSE.

Send me postcards.  Send me E-mail.  Send me money!!!!
I'm always reading the Amiga Games echo, so you can reach me there (just make
sure the message is on topic :-).
I can be contacted by Internet E-mail at:
    courttod@max.cc.uregina.ca

to be contacted there.
I can be contacted via Netmail.  Haven't a clue what my netmail address is tho.
I can be contacted via C$erve.  Usernumber is 71621,414.  I DON'T use C$erve
hardly ever, because it costs a fortune here in Canada, so thru C$erve mail
is not recommended.
