How to Play

Here are some rough instructions:

Use the joystick or arrow keys to move your character around.
Push the UP arrow key to enter a command

Commands are simple sentences like 'take rock' or 'use spring'
If a command doesn't appear to work try rephrasing it, for instance
if 'take ball' doesn't work then try 'take red ball'. Try to be
specific with your commands and try everything.

Commands:
