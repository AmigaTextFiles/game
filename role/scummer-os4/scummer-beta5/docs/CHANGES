History
-----------

 
Beta 5: Completely rewrote scummer (fiuuu!). Hopefully it will be easier to mantain. I looked into 	
	FreeCnC sources (I didn't know ANYTHING about c++ classes). Object decoding removed (it was
	very buggy). Implemented scrolling (it's slow because image is loaded "on the fly" from disk).
	BTW, I am still looking for programmers.....

Beta 4: Rewrote some i/o functions (Now they are WAY faster!!!).

Beta 3: Completely rewrote Scummer (and it will not be the last time... :-/ )
	Now it's more modular. Objects decoding (it works, but it's deactivated 
	by default).

Beta 2: Added support for Sam&Max & Day of the Tentacle.

Beta 1: First public beta.
