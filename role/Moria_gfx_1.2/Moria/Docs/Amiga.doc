AMIGA MORIA GRAPHICS VERSION
----------------------------

One morning, a few weeks ago, my brain said to me:  'Henrik it's time you
played some Moria, remember how fun it was?'.  'Shut up!' - I said, 'I
don't have time to play Moria, I have to study Queueing theory and Discrete
simulation techniques'.  My brain continued..  'Never mind that, remember
you never slayed the Balrog?  Plaaay Moooria, Heeenrik!'.  Well, what can
you do?  I had to get it out of my system.  So, 'OK!' I said, 'I'll play
some Moria, if you insist!'.

I made some archeological excavations among my disks, and found Amiga Moria
V3.0, which I'd been playing on my A2000 more than a year ago.  I installed
it and started it up.  After a few seconds of gameplay...  'WHAM!!'.  My
Amiga, now an A3000 running 2.04 didn't even guru!  I don't think it ever
knew what hit it...  It was so bad it wouldn't even resurrect, so I had to
turn it off _physically_ :-)...  Well, 'I can't play any Moria.  Sorry,
NoCanDo, since Amiga Moria won't work on my Amiga 3000' - I told myself.
But would my Moria-playing-almost-drugged-like-brain give up?.  Nooo...
Nope...  'Since you know where you can find the source code for Moria, you
could always add some graphics and it would look just like Amiga Moria 3.0'
I thought about it for a while (about 3 seconds) and said to myself, Hey!
Since I really need to practice some C-coding, maybe that's not such a bad
idea...

So, I started working, and after a lot of ugly shortcuts and hacks I ended
up with 'Amiga graphics 'Umoria 5.4' V1.0', and I had a lot of fun doing
it...

The main idea is to play UMoria 5.4 as close to the original as possible
concerning objects and nasty creatures.  In Amiga Moria 3.0 they added a
lot of really nasty creatures like 'Bigger blue Icky thing', or something,
and some weapons that made you practically invincible.  I didn't want this,
I thought some of it ruined the game.  So what you have is basically UMoria
5.4 with a lot of extra goodies to make it attractive to the graphical-
oriented Amiga public.

If you ever played Amiga Moria 3.0 you should feel at home, some of the
graphics are directly taken from that version, and a lot of it repainted,
but it basically looks the same.  
I didn't put any menus in it.  'Hey, no menus in an Amiga program!?', I can
hear you say, but the truth is, there were menus in Amiga Moria 3.0 and
when I learned the keyboard combinations, I _never_ used the menus.  When
you learn how to play the game via the keyboard, you'll never want to touch
any menus...

So what is new in this version from the original UMoria 5.4?
------------------------------------------------------------

Well, let's see... (a lot of the ideas taken from Amiga Moria 3.0)


* All characters are bitmapped (graphical).

This is why you would ever want to play Moria at all...


* Enhanced global mapping that shows the whole map at once, reduced
  in size 4 times.

Press , (comma) and a map will be drawn.


* Continous running mode added. Every time you move, you run instead.. :-)

Press '(' and when you move somewhere with the keypad, you will run.  You
cannot fight in this mode.  Press '(' again to unselect.  '(' was chosen
for this partly because all the other keys were taken :-) and because I
have my keymap setup so I have '(' directly above the '7' on the keypad.
As a bonus I set ')' to do a single run.  (Like '.' does).


* Colour coded messages.

Most messages are displayed in some color, this is what they mean:

White - Normal info.

Red - Danger, you are hurt in someway, or something else really bad happens.

Yellow - Warning. A message that means trouble, or you failed to do something
         will be displayed in yellow.

Green - You hit a monster or you succeded on doing something, like
        casting a spell.

Light blue - You killed a monster.

Dark red - Real danger, one of your stats has been decreased.

Blue - One of your stats has increased.


* Automatic update of messages that would otherwise require some extra
  input from the user, gives gameplay speedup.

Press '`' and all messages normally followed by a '-more-', that wants you
to press space, will automatically be updated in a defineable time.  Press
'`' to unselect.  Press '=' to setup if you want this ON or OFF and to
define the update time.  Press 'g' to set the update time quickly.


* Mouse click identify. Click on something with the mouse to identify it.

Press '/' and click on something you wish identified.


* Time and day is always displayed (unless there is another bug... :-)


* LOT'S of work on all graphic (even if you may not beleive it.. :-).


* Stats display (like strength and XP) is color coded.

When some status has decreased, it will be displayed in yellow.  When
hitpoints or mana is between 0-25% it will be red, 25%-75% in yellow,
75%-100% in light green and 100% in white.  This is because you always need
to keep track of these vital data, and by color coding them, you can read
them quicker.


* '0' means 'open' command, '+' means 'look' command.

To acces the open command 'o' quickly, you can use '0' if you are playing
with the original commands (not rogue like).  Likewise, '+' works as the
look command does.  This is for faster access to the look command on the
numeric keypad.


* Something else I've forgotten...


Installing:
-----------

Moria _can_ be run from WorkBench, but I do not recommend it.  Some
problems are generated when you want to save and exit the game.  So, run it
from a shell instead.

Make a directory and put all the moria-files in it.
Assign 'moria:' to this directory.
Copy iff.library to libs: (the version in this distribution is 18.5)
Set your stack to 30-40k.
Run moria.

These are all the vital files you have to have to get moria running:

In 'moria:'
hours, moria, moria_gfx.iff, moria_gfxsmall.iff moria_title.iff, news,
origcmds.hlp, owizcmds.hlp, roglcmds.hlp, rwizcmds.hlp, scores,
version.hlp, welcome.hlp.

In 'libs:'
iff.library.


Other interesting info...
-------------------------

This program has some very low level routines to speed up graphics, so do
NOT expect it to work if you play around with the screensize and stuff like
that with some screenmanager program.  For example, the screensize should
ALWAYS be 640x200, no more, no less.  You have been warned.  (Even though
this is something you would not normally do anyway..  :-)

This version does not understand any other Moria savefiles.  I needed some
extra space to save some things.

Not all creatures in the dungeon has it's own graphics, the centipedes for
example, all look the same.

Does anyone know what a Yeek looks like?  I made a wild guess and made it
look like a colourful Icky thing..  :-) If anyone knows, please tell me, or
send me a version of your moria_gfx.iff.  If anyone feels the graphics
don't really match the creatures, repaint it the way you want it to look
like, and if you want, please send me a copy of your graphics, but you may
not distribute a Moria with your version of the graphics. Anyway, not
without clearly indicating this some way.  This applies to all files in this
distribution, by the way.  I don't want the heat for someone else's changes
to the worse...

This version has been tested on an A500 running 1.3 and 2.04 and it works
fine on my A3000 running 2.04.  Its memory usage seems to be about 610k.

This program needs iff.library 18.5 (comes with this package) installed in
libs:  to work.

You can repaint all graphics if you like.  It's all in IFF.

Main graphics is in moria:moria_gfx.iff.
Small graphics (1:4) is in moria:moria_gfxsmall.iff.
Title picture is in moria:moria_title.iff.

If you find a bug and send me a bugreport, I might not fix it immediately,
since I'm loaded with other (school) work...

I will not release source code for this, it's not intended to be read by
others than me.  I might send you the source code if you ask specifically
for it, but it needs a LOT of work to be as readable as the other original
sources.  (Unless you take into consideration the fact that all the other
sources are written for Mac, Amiga, Atari, VMS and UN*X *simultaneously*
with one hundred million #ifdef's and #endif's all over..  :-)

Thanks to Kent Sandstrom for beta-testing.


Have fun!
