Updates & changes:

***** 1.0 1992-04-11

First public release. See Amiga.doc.

***** 1.1 1992-05-15

Added:  Menus!  At popular request, I put in menus.  No extra functionality
however.  Everything you can do in the menus, you can do via keyboard.  All
corresponding keyboard-commands are shown in brackets.  Original commands to the
left, and rogue-like commands to the right.

Added:  More graphics.  Snakes, Jellys, Icky-Things and Centipedes now have
individual graphics so you can tell them apart easier.

Added:  When you press SHIFT and a number on the keypad you make a 'run'.  Just
like SHIFT + direction in rogue-command mode works.  Also, when you press CTRL
and a number you do a tunnel.

Change:  Speed increase of graphics display.  Especially when you change map
sector.

Change:  The '-more-' update-text are not colorcoded, thus not to spoil the
surprise of a monster-kill for example.  In 1.0, the '-more-' text always had
the colour of the following message.

Change:  When you get hungry, the 'Hungry' - message in the stat block is now
yellow, and when you get 'Weak' it is displayed in red.  This is so you'll
notice that you are hungry even in a ferocious battle.

Change:  The ONE change I've made to the gameplay concerns haggling in the
stores for better price.  I was fed up with all haggling, and made it easier to
get final price and a better price faster.
It's a bit complicated to explain, but at level 16 to 30 chances rise you don't
have to haggle at all, at level 30 you never have to haggle anymore.  Also, at
level 11 and up, chances increase that you will get a better price faster.

Bugfix:  The graphics for the mushroom and the mold was mixed.

Bugfix:  When you died and exited and you wanted to take a look at your
inventory, the -more- was auto-updated. (Not my bug... :-)

Bugfix:  The flush-buffer routine was unnecessarily slow.  It always called on
the timer to wait, even for 0 microseconds.  Since the IO to the timer is not
very fast, the delay is now checked and only performed when the delay is not
zero.  Since this function is called practically constantly, this greatly
improves speed sometimes, especially when there are many monsters around, like
breeding lice for example.  Version 1.0 had a 'feature' this version hasn't.
When you had a fast setting on the key-repeat, the game would halt your
character when danger was imminent.  Since the new version is a lot faster when
handling input, it is now possible to hold down a direction-key and run straight
into a monster and get killed before you even saw what happened.  So be warned!
Do NOT play Moria using the key-repeat feature of the keyboard unless you know
what you are doing...

Bugfix:  All characters in the font/keymap that the Amiga can handle to print
(and some more) should now be able to be used in the character name etc.  Even
Swedish letters works...  :-) (Stupid compiler doesn't know Swedish...)

Bugfix:  When you tried to tunnel into a shop, the game would crash.

Bugfix:  The graphics for the Lucerne Hammer should have been a pole-arm, it was
a hammer instead. (Like I'm supposed to know what ancient old weapons are supposed
to look like, especially when their names are in English... :-)

Bugfix:  When hallucinating, you would sometimes get graphics that were ASCII
instead.

Bugfix:  When displaying a gascloud or something like that, the update would be
unnecessarily slow on non-A3000's.  I used another way to do the small delay
that is needed when displaying the graphics, so now it's hopefully fast/slow
enough.  But I have difficulty verifying this since I run on an A3000.

Note:  'Run' doesn't work in one instance:  When one of the shops are placed
with only one space to the wall, it is not possible to run in the corridor
created betweeen the shop and the wall.  I haven't been able to figure out why,
but since it's not exactly a screaming bug I'll let it be.  Maybe the original
UMoria 5.4 behaves like this too, I don't know.

Note:  Instead of running the actual moria from the icon in workbench, a script
has been added that runs moria from IconX.  You can duplicate this script and
edit the name of the savefile, which is moria.sav as default, thus making it
easy to run several savefiles at once.

Note:  Several users has noticed a delay when stepping on a pot of gold to pick
the money up.  I have checked this, and can verify this, but I haven't seen this
delay longer than when stepping on something else.  It's a bit difficult to see
since I run on a 25MHz 68030.  I don't think this is a bug, however.  I think it
might be some kind of garbage collect routine, I'm not sure.  But anyway, you'll
probably have to live with this...

Note:  My version of Moria displays time and day.  This complicates things a
teeny weeny little bit, because it's not updated accordingly to speed,
searchmode etc.  The thing is, when you enter search mode or decrease your speed
in any way, this will not change how long each move takes, but instead it moves
the other characters faster/slower. (.. or something like that :-)

Note:  I am releasing the source-code now so it won't get lost, because I
probably won't do much more work on my Moria version.  It's distributed so if
anyone wants to, he/she can continue the work.  It's been compiled on an
A3000/2.04 with Aztec 5.2a.  I don't know how it compiles under different
configurations.  Please refer to moria.doc.amiga concerning legal issues of
copying and distribution.  All disclaimers for the binary distribution holds for
the source-code also.  Note that the source-code is not in this archive, but is
distributed in an archive of it's own.
The sourcecode is NOT pretty in some places, rather ugly I would say.  But I am
releasing the sourcecode now because I might not have more time to work on it.
And since shortage of time was the reason I released the sourcecode it was never
intended to be beautiful code...

***** 1.2 1992-11-28

Bugfix: Updated to UMoria 5.5.  That was mainly bugfixes.  Not so much work actually...

Bugfix: If you do a menu-operation at the same time as the game redraws the
screen, the game won't trash the menu-graphics and vice-versa.

Note: About haggling in UMoria 5.5:
It seems to be a bit easier to haggle in the shops in UMoria 5.5, but I haven't
changed my routines.  So in my version, it's still a lot easier to haggle.
Please see note above on this.

Note: If you want the sources for this release, just e-mail me, and (if I have the
time) I'll send it to you. (Or maybe release it to some ftp-site)

Note: The iff.library in this version is 22.1




As always, Have Fun!
