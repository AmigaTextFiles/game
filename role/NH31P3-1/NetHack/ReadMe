I. Introduction

I.A. Overview
    Welcome to Amiga NetHack!  If this is your first visit to our fair
    city, you are in for an amazing and dangerous journey; if you have
    visited us before, beware! the city has changed in many strange and
    subtle ways; it has also grown quite a bit.  This missive brings to
    light those mundane tasks which must be dealt with before beginning
    your journey; for those of you who are faced with the task of
    installing the pre-fabricated version of our town, section III
    (Installing Amiga NetHack 3.1) will guide you through the task at
    hand.  If you are ready to visit, the local visitors guide is in
    section II (Using Amiga NetHack 3.1); please also see the general
    guide packaged separately (the file GuideBook).
    
    To all our visitors, a hearty Welcome! - and please be careful.

    [Those responsible for the previous paragraphs have been sacked.  The
    documentation has been completed at great expense in a more traditional
    style. -- The Management]

I.B. Getting Help
    If you have questions about strategy, weapons, or monsters, the best
    place to go for help is the Usenet newsgroup rec.games.hack.  If you
    have problems with installation or think you have found a bug in
    the game, please report it by electronic mail to the development
    group at nethack-bugs@linc.cis.upenn.edu, where it will be routed
    to the appropriate person.  Include your configuration, the version of
    NetHack you are playing, and as much specific information as possible.
    As NetHack runs on many different machines, be sure to mention that
    you are playing the Amiga version.  Finally, if you are having trouble
    compiling NetHack, you may use the same address, or, for compiler
    specific problems, send mail to:
    	Greg Olson (golson@sundown.sun.com) for Manx.
    	Richard Addison (addison@pollux.usc.edu) for SAS/C.
    We do not currently have a contact for the DICE port.

I.C. Credits
    Olaf Seibert first ported NetHack 2.3 and 3.0 to the Amiga.  Richard
    Addison, Jochen Erwied, Mark Gooderum, Ken Lorber, Greg Olson, Mike
    Passaretti, and Gregg Wonderly polished and extended the 3.0 and 3.1
    ports.


II. Using Amiga NetHack 3.1
    The short version: from the WorkBench click on HackWB and from the
    CLI invoke HackCli.

II.A. Sources of Information
    Where to go depends on what you want to find out.  If you want to find
    out about distributing NetHack, read the license (in NetHack:license or
    type ?i during the game).  For an introduction to NetHack, read the
    GuideBook file.  Finally, for information during the game on all kinds
    of things, type ? and select from the menu.  Further information on
    HackWB is below and available from HackWB - press the Help key; more
    information on HackCli is in the NetHack ManPage.

II.B. The Amiga NetHack WorkBench Front End
    The Amiga NetHack WorkBench Front End, HackWB, looks more or less like a
    WorkBench Drawer - and acts the same way.  Games start with double clicks
    and menus provide more detailed control of games and defaults.  On-line
    help is available - just press the help key.

    Just as with WorkBench itself, options for games are set using the Info
    menu item to modify Tooltypes.  Most common options can be set more 
    easily using buttons available via Info also.

    If necessary, you can adjust the following using the ToolTypes from the
    Info command:

	* OPTIONS=<options> - Options as available in the NetHack.cnf file.

	* HACKDIR=<directory> - Set NetHack working directory to be this
	  directory.

	* LEVELS=<levels> - Intermediate level saving device/directory.

	* PATH=<path> - To search for files such as rumors, help, etc.

	* CMDLINE=<args> - Arguments as passed on the CLI command line.
	  Note:  only the following flags are valid: n, X, D, and r.

	* SCORE <options> - Display the record of scores.  Options as
	  available on the CLI command line after a -s flag.

	* FONT=name.font:size - Set font used for text on screens which are
	  tall enough (>250 lines).

	* PENS=col0/col1/.../col7 - Set palette colors.

    Note that the NetHack.cnf file is read first, then the ToolTypes.  This
    means that the options specified in the NetHack.cnf act as defaults
    which can be overridden by an individual's personal icon's ToolTypes.
    Thus the system oriented entries (HACKDIR, LEVELS, and PATH) should
    generally be set only in NetHack.cnf.  NetHack.cnf should have default
    values for OPTIONS, which will generally be overridden by ToolTypes
    entries.

    Also, there are two additional options that may be specified in the
    NetHack.cnf file or on an OPTIONS line: flush and silent.  When enabled,
    flush discards all characters in the queue except the first, which limits
    typeahead accidents.  The default setting is noflush.  Silent turns off
    the audio output.

    Usually, most of the confusing options will be set in the NetHack.cnf
    file once when the game is installed and can be ignored after that.

II.C. The Amiga NetHack CLI Front End
    The CLI Front End, HackCli, provides the standard Unix-like command line
    interface to NetHack.  Unlike the Unix front end however, the CLI front
    end will ask if you want to play again (and optionally change the
    arguments) before exiting.  See the ManPage file for the standard Unix
    flags for NetHack.  In addition to those flags, Amiga NetHack accepts
    flags -l to force non-interlaced mode and -L to force interlaced mode.


III. Installing Amiga NetHack 3.1

III.A. General Installation
    Installation should be easy - basically it consists of putting files
    where they belong and adding assigns to your startup.  If you are
    installing from the official binary distribution, simply unpacking
    each archive in the appropriate directory will put the files in the
    places they belong (note that the archives may have been split
    for distribution).  If you are installing from source, most of this
    work will be done by the time the build is finished.  See below for
    complete installation instructions.

    IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A PREVIOUS VERSION INSTALLED YOU MUST DELETE THE
    OLD SAVE AND BONES FILES - THEY WILL NOT WORK!  This includes save
    and bones files from NetHack 3.1.0 and 3.1.1.

Will NetHack fit on your machine?
    NetHack 3.1 is large.  NetHack 3.1 is very large.  You will need:
    > Amiga 500, 1000, 2000, 2500, 3000, or 4000.  The A600, and A1200
      should work, but have not been tested.
    > WorkBench 1.3 or 2.04 or later.  WorkBench 1.2 or 2.02 will NOT work;
      we will NOT be fixing that. 
    > At least 2 meg of RAM.  NetHack will NOT run in 1 meg.
    > Mass storage: NetHack will run on one floppy - but it won't be nice.
      Two floppies are almost enough.  A hard drive with over 3 meg of
      free space is recommended.

Find space for the files
    Floppy installation:
	Format five disks named:
	    NetHack
	    HackExe
	    HackExe2
	    NHsave
	    NHlevels
    Hard Disk installation:
    	cd to wherever you want to install NetHack
	make a new directory to be the main NetHack directory:
	  makedir NH313
	  makedir NH313/NetHack
	  makedir NH313/HackExe
	  makedir NH313/HackExe2
	In S:User-Startup (under 2.0 or later) or S:Startup-Sequence
	(under 1.3):
	  assign NetHack: to the NetHack directory you created above.
	  assign HackExe: to the HackExe directory.
	  assign HackExe2: to the HackExe2 directory.

Install the files
    Unpack the archives in the directories or onto the disks.  Cd to
    the appropriate places then unpack the files:
    Archive 1 (the one this ReadMe came in), should be unpacked into
    NetHack:.  If you are installing to hard disk, cd to the NH313 directory
    before unpacking.
      lz x NH31P3-1.lzh
    Archive 2 unpacks in two sections to two different places.  If you are
    installing to hard disk, cd to the NH313 directory before unpacking; if
    you are installing to floppies, unpack each section to a different disk.
      lz x NH31P3-2.lzh HackExe/#?
      lz x NH31P3-2.lzh HackExe2/#?
      
    Use the table in the next section to see where things should end up.
    Be sure that the file 8 ends up in NetHack:hack/8 and that the sounds
    files end up in the NetHack:sounds directory.

Floppy fixup
    If you are installing to floppies the files on each disk are probably one
    level too far down (for example NetHack:NetHack.cnf is probably
    NetHack:NetHack/NetHack.cnf).  This is how to fix that:
    Put the following lines into the file ram:fixit (be sure to delete the
    blanks from the start of the lines or this will NOT work!)
      .key x
      rename <x> /<x>

    For each of the disks NH313, NetHack, and HackExe, cd into the "inner"
    directory (for example "cd NetHack:NetHack") and execute these commands:
      list >ram:x lformat="execute ram:fixit %s" #?
      execute ram:x

Configuration
    Using your favorite text editor, edit NetHack:NetHack.cnf to match
    your system.  Check HackExe:NetHack.dir and be sure that the paths
    are correct (note that the C or D beginning the line is required and
    is not part of the file path).  The HackWB program uses two standard
    Amiga programs that must be installed in their standard places: c:copy
    and c:rename.  The icons for the documentation invoke SYS:Utilities/More
    and will probably need to be updated for your installation.

    If you want a log kept of each game, execute this line:
	echo to NetHack:logfile

    If you are installing to a hard disk, installation is complete.

    If you are installing to floppies, you must format a disk for save files
    and one for levels files.  Edit NetHack.cnf and change the SAVE= and
    LEVELS= lines to match.
