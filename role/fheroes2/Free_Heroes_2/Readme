                 A FREE HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC II ENGINE REMAKE

Peter Lemenkov - minor updates and fixes
Josh Matthews - battle AI, assorted updates and fixes

Free Heroes2 Engine is a pre-alpha version, many features are missing still.
The game is progressing in a steady pace though, so I thought it was worthy
of a release. I will keep maintaining the AmigaOS 3.x version and release
regular updates.

The game requires the original Heroes of Might and Magic II game data.

So copy Heroes_2_CD:data/HEROES2.AGG into Free_Heroes_2/data
and Heroes_2_CD:maps/#?.mp2 into Free_Heroes_2/maps/.

Hot keys:
F4             - switch to fullscreen
PrintScreen    - create screenshot

Loading is not yet implemented, and the battle system is WIP.

Finally, a lot work was required to make this release. 
I had to fix SDL_Mixer to support midi, and I had to fix the GUS soundfont.

So, I hope you think it is worth it, or will be worth it once the game is more
mature. Have Fun!
