INSTALLATION:
Note that the demo only runs from floppy, which needs to be labelled "CDI", 
but the full game HD installs.


This demo is the entire first level of Crystal Dragon, but comes with no
instructions.  Most things are DM/Black Crypt standard, but although I
know it's possible to swap the two characters around so that the strong
one goes to the front, I've so far been unable to figure out how the hell
you manage this.
