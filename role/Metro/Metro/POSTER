This material was downloaded from People Link.  Below is a copy of the
information from the People Link Amiga Zone library section.  I added the
InstallFont script and icon, and updated the Instructions icon with my
standard readme icon, instead of the funky notepad one.  I did notice
one small problem with the menus under AmigaDOS 2.0, with the menus
being rendered in two different fonts.

     In METRO, you play the role of a city planner. Using limited funds, you
must construct a mass-transit subway system capable of meeting the needs of
your city. Build wisely and your system will be a success, but poor planning
will lead to disaster and financial ruin.
