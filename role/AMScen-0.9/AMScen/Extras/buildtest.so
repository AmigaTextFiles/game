This is the entry foyer to a small office. There are a few

This appears to be the office of someone in middle

to be a power-user status symbol more than anything else.

You can tell this is the boss's office by the size of the

The desk is quite massive. It is made from some kind of
very pretty redish wood. There don't seem to be any
scratches on the highly-polished top, but there are some
ugly coffee-cup rings there.
