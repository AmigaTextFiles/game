*** SCUMMER ***
	*beta 5*

A program which reads and display images from GREAT old
LucasArts games files. It can display images contained in 
"*.001" files, from MONKEY ISLAND I CD version, MONKEY 
ISLAND II, INDIANA JONES AND THE FATE OF ATLANTIS, 
probably others. Because it uses SDL it should work with a 
lot of OS, and a lot of systems. Contact me if it doesn't work
or doesn't compile on your system.

Usage: scummer <filename>

where <filename> is a SCUMM resource file (example: scummer ATLANTIS.001).
Some games may have resource files with different extension (".SM1", for example). 

Just hit a key (or click mousebutton) to see next image, "q" to quit.


Enjoy!


P.S: I would like to thank Tremal-Naik, who bravely first tried my program on his pc, 
gave me a hand to test Scumer, told me how to make a makefile :) , made the
splash screen, and many, many other things. Thank you again, Tremal!

P.P.S: To write this simple app, I peeked at the source of ScummRev 
(http://scummrev.mixnmojo.com) by Serge and Scumm16 (you can find it at LucasHacks! 
(http://scumm.mixnmojo.com), and even FreeCnC (I am definitely incompetent about c++ classes). Last but not least, this program would not ever been made without the documentation at ScummRev site.

P.P.P.S: Oh, and I thank LucasArts (c), for having done such beautiful games.

Very Last P.S: I'm looking for more expert programmers to write a more complete
SCUMM resource viewer, and maybe a SCUMM interpreter to play SCUMM games.
