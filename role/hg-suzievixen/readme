    This is an uncompiled Hired Guns character graphic. You'll need to run it
through 'convert' before you can use it (sorry, but i took HG off the drive
some time ago, having won it!).

    The art is (c) 1993 Paul Trauth. Use and distribute it freely. If you want
some cartoonish graphics done for a game/demo/etc, contact me at
"mjtmc.uno.edu" with "Attn: Paul" or the like in the subject (It's not my
account, i just use it sometimes!).

Note that the address "mjt@mc..." that i gave in the previous two HG graphics
doesn't seem to work. Blame the horrible documentation for the VAX mail that
led me to believe that mjt@mc was the proper address. My apologies to anyone
who tried to mail me; try again.
