Description
This game is based on Leisure Suit Larry 1, created and published by 
Sierra On-Line. You play the role of officer Sonny Bonds investigating 
missing persons reports at the notorious Lefty's bar, uncovering a 
prostitution ring that leads to a deadly confrontation with his old 
nemesis Jessie Bains. What begins as a routine investigation becomes
a carefully orchestrated trap, as Sonny discovers that every clue 
he's found was planted to lure him into the Death Angel's web of revenge.

How to play
