10-May-1992 [lars] : v 1.0
  First version.

05-Jun-1992 [lars] : v 1.1
  'Port' argument added.

22-Oct-1992 [lars] : v 1.2
  Console prompts for RETURN now if driver shuts down.

02-Apr-1993 [lars] : v 1.3
  Adapted for Amiga-Oberon 3.00
  A 'shutdown' message will be sent on unexpected termination.

09-Apr-1993 [lars] : v 1.3c
  First C version, reluctantly converted from the Oberon sources.
   The C version always mirrors the Oberon version, and is in fact
   just a plain ripoff.

03-May-1993 [lars] : v 1.4(c)
  Merged in patches by John Fehr.
  CNN: is no longer mandatory (no requesters when not found).

06-Sep-1993 [lars] : v 1.5
  The current console can be opened explicitely.

04-Oct-1993 [lars] : v 1.6
  On shell start, .info-Files are evaluated before parsing the cli args.

10-Oct-1993 ..
15-Nov-1993 [lars] : v 1.7(c)
  Small fixes.
  Sources reorganized for multiple Frontends.
  Frontend to AmiExpress implemented.

11-Jan-1994 [lars]
  Fixed an off-by-one bug in PlayMud.c, which resulted in null strings
    being sent to the mud all the time ('pos' was initialised to 0
    instead of -1 ... *growl*).

13-Feb-1994 [lars]
  The sequence IAC GA is now properly ignored (DGD uses it to mark the
    end of the prompt strings).

25-Feb-1994 [lars]
  The DosHndlFront did synchronous Write()s instead of asynchronous.
    Changed that.

17-Jul-1994 [lars]
  Adapted PlayMud.c for DICE 3.0 by adding some type casts.

20-Nov-1994 [lars]
  To prevent lockups on abortions (caused by too eager muds sending data
    after receiving the shutdown message), ShutdownAll() closes the
    readPort before shutting down the frontend.

02-Jan-1996 [lars] : v 1.8(c)
  On connection end, the "Press RETURN" prompt will no longer printed if using
    the current console.
  Connection losses during echo-off-phases left the console in invisible mode.

01-May-1996 [lars] : v 1.9(c)
  The ConMan console CNN: is no longer tried as default - OS 1.3 might not be
    dead completely, but surely smells funny.
  The CON: default console is opened with the /CLOSE attribute.
