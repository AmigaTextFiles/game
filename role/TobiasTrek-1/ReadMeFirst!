NOTE: I have nothing to do with this program except for getting this
archive into a format that is acceptable to BIX. I have successfully run
this game from the hard drive of my A3000 under Workbench 2.02, and from
floppys on a 1M A500 with Kickstart 1.2.

PS: This disk came from PLink in ZAP or WARP format, I've packed it in
LHarc format to save space, and because the custom bootblocks on the disks
caused a Guru on the A3000 (even though the game itself runs fine!).
