Important notes for Adventure Design System:

If you are using WB 3.x and ADS doesn't load up properly, go into your
preferences and re-save your OVERSCAN and SCREEN preferences.  You don't
need to change them, just save them again.  Then re-boot and load ADS.

This program supports AGA, but for best results always use pictures with a
resolution of 640 x 400!
