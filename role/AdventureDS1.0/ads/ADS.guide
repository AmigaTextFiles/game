@NODE "Program Information"
                                 What the hell is This?


   Adventure Design System (ADS) is a shareware program that allows you to
create and subsequently play an adventure/role-playing game.  It is highly 
flexible and configurable.  If you're like me and and want to get started 
immediately without going through all the docs, read the @{"Quick Start" link "Quick Start"} docs.
   ADS also has an online support system to help you as you use the 
program.  Press the HELP key or if yours is broken, press the right mouse 
button to access the online help menu from the game.  Even if you don't 
need it, at least admire it once to justify the time that Travis put into 
it... PLEASE???  Thanks.

                  Gem, or Scroll. Just press one of the buttons to the
                  right of the object type text window that corresponds
                  to the options.  The text in the object type text 
                  window will change to reflect the currently selected
                  object type.
                      
@ENDNODE

@NODE "Affects Character's"

    Affects Characters' - This option allows you to select what 
                          attribute of the characters' in the game (@{"NPC" link "GLOB" 3}
                          or @{"PC" link "GLOB" 5}) the object effects.  The options are: Hit 
                          points, Armor, or Money.  If you have selected
                          Weapon, Armor, or Money as the Object type, 
                          this field will be automatically set and not 
                          be changeable since weapons always affect an 
                          opponent's hit points (negatively), Armor 
                          always effects a player's armor rating, and 
                          Money always effects a player's amount of 
                          money.  For the other object types however, 
                          you can set this in any way you like.  ADS
                          will automatically figure out when to affect
                          a PC's attributes and when to affect a NPC's
                          attributes.
                          
@ENDNODE

@NODE "Amount to Affect"

    Amount to affect - How much you want the object to affect the
                       attribute you defined in the "Affects character's"
                       field. Negative values are allowed. For example:
                           
                            Affects character's: Money
                            Amount to effect: 5
                                
                       will increase the amount of money the character
                       has by 5 whereas this:
                           
                            Affects character's: Hit Pts
                            Amount to effect: -5
                          
                      will decrease the amount of hit points the

@NODE "RN" "Room Number"

    This is the slot number of the room you are editing.  You can have a
    maximum of 1000 rooms (in the registered version and 10 in the 
    unregistered version).  You can use the left or right arrow buttons
    or the scroll bar to advance through the creature slots.  You can
    also type in the number directly by clicking into the field and
    typing it in.
        
@ENDNODE

@NODE "RT" "Room Type"

    This specifies the type of room you are currently editing.  The options
    are Normal or Market.  Also, rooms that have not been created will have
    "No Room" as a room type.  A "Market" room is where the PC's can buy or
    sell items.  A "Normal" room is everything else.
    
    @{b}NOTE: SELECTING A ROOM TYPE CREATES THE ROOM.  IF YOU DO NOT SPECIFY A
          ROOM TYPE, YOUR CHANGES WILL NOT BE SAVED!@{ub}
            
@ENDNODE

@NODE "CE" "Cardinal Exits"

    North, East, South, West, Up, and Down are all standard exits.  Your
    rooms should have at least 1 exit so that the PCs can enter and exit.
    Typing in the number of the room slot that you want an already created 
    room to exit to creates the new room as a normal room if it hasn't 
    already been created.  (Say that ten times fast!).  By clicking on the
    text of the exit name (i.e. "North Exit") will take you to the room that
    is specified as being an exit to the current room (if there IS one).
    
    When you set a room to exit to another room through a particular
    direction, the opposite direction in the new room is set to exit to the
    previous room.  For example:
    
        If you set room 1 to exit to the North to room 2:
        
                                Room 2
                                  |
                                  |
                                  |
                                Room 1
                                
        Then room 2's South exit is automatically marked as exiting to Room
        1.  Also, a room cannot exit into itself (I know your dissappointed).
        
    Also, when you're editing a room and you want to go back to the previous
    room you were editing, just click on the Room Number icon and it will
    take you to the room number you were in right before the current one.
    
@ENDNODE

@NODE "SE" "Secret Exit"

    This option will let you supply a secret exit that the room can have.
    To set this however you must first set the @{"Secret Destination" link "SD"} number to
    a room.
    
@ENDNODE

@NODE "SD" "Secret Destination"

    This lets you specify the room number that secret exit exits to.  As of
    this writing, unlike the Cardinal Exits, the secret exit option DOES NOT
    create the room for you.  You must do that on your own.  Also, the exit
    of the created room is not automically specified to exit to the previous
    room.
    
@ENDNODE

@NODE "ACLS" "All clear buttons"

Each @{"clear" link GLOB 1} button clears its corresponding room field.  The clear button at
the top, next to the Room Type field, clears all the fields in the entire
room including the exits, picture and sound files, Room Descriptions and the
Objects & Creatures section.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "OBBUT" "Objects"

    You have 10 slots to which you can assign the objects that will be in
    the room.  You can pick slot number one, for example, and assign it an
    object number such as 1 which may be a sword then you can pick slot
    number 2 and assign another object number 1 (our sword) to it or maybe
    object number 2 which could be armor or something.  Anything you want
    basically.
    
@ENDNODE

@NODE "CREAT" "Creatures"

    The creatures section works pretty much like the objects section.  
    You have 10 slots to which you can assign creatures.  Slot number 1
    could be assigned creature number one which might be a skeleton.
    If you want 2 skeletons, assign slot number 2 to creature number 1
    which is the number of our skeleton.  You can have ten of the same
    or ten totally different creatures in a room.
        
@ENDNODE

@NODE "RAND" "Random"

    Random creatures appear in their respective rooms on a percentage chance
    and after they are killed can come back again.  Just select which slot
    you want to make a random creature and then select the percentage chance
    that it might appear.  If you set this field to 100% then the creature
    will always be there when you go back to the room no matter how many 
    times you have killed it.  If a creature is not random it is in the room
    once and once killed, it does not come back.  At this time you can only
    have one random creature per room.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "RD" "Room Description Window"

    Here you can enter a description of the current room for the player to
    see.  When typing in the descrition, you have to press return at the
    end of each line because it will not automatically wrap.  It will, 
    however, go to the beginning of the next line.  The @{"clear" link GLOB} button will
