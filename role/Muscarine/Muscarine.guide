@{i}Muscarine or Erica's Trip @{ui}

A rather surreal, absurd and psychedelic adventure game with
hand-drawn graphics. You have to guide Erica Evermore through her
pretty weird adventure. In the beginning Erica's mission is to have
fun. But you will soon discover more interesting quests when you
explore the marvels of this game.

This are the first two parts of this game. The last part is still
missing. Consider this release as a demo of work in progress. If you
have any suggestions, bug reports, etc. please @{"contact me" link "author" 0}.

This game was created using GRAAL (Graphic Adventure Authoring
Language) which was written by Per Thulin. GRAAL is a great
thing if you hate nasty "low level" programming and still want
to create a graphic adventure. Check it out!

@{i}LEGAL STUFF @{ui}

Since the worth of this piece of very high art can't be measured
with money, "Muscarine or Erica's Trip" is FREE! It may be freely
distributed for any non-commercial purpose providing that the archive
and all documentation is not altered.

You are not allowed to play this game if you are Bernard Elk! I have
made this game for everyone but not for you Mr. Bernard Elk!


@endnode


@node "require" " REQUIREMENTS "
@next "install"
@prev "legal"


@{i}REQUIREMENTS @{ui}

Any PAL Amiga with OS 2.0 or higher and a harddisk is required
to run this game.

Well, GRAAL should run with OS 1.3 but I couldn't get my game
to work on my old A500 with OS 1.3! Don't know why?!

It runs on my A4000 with 18MB. It should also run with
2MB Chip-RAM, but some additonal Fast-RAM is recommended.

@node "install" " INSTALLATION "
@next "playing"
@prev "require"


@{i}INSTALLATION @{ui}

 1. Unpack the archive to a hard disk drawer.

 2. Double-click the "Muscarine" icon and play!


@{u}NOTE!!!@{uu}

If you want to play the game from RAM before installing it to
your HD, don't put the game in the root directory of RAM: as this
will confuse the buffering, make a directory in RAM:, extract to
there, and run it from there. Then it should work.

@prev "install"


@{i}PLAYING THE GAME @{ui}

Ok, you can build sentences by clicking on verbs and objects.
With these sentences you tell Erica what she should do. Every
object has a default verb (look at in most cases). You can do
the default action for an object by simply clicking it with
the right mouse button.

Besides verbs and objects there are exits. If you click on an
exit Erica will leave the current location and go to another.

The user interface is easy enough. Just try it... There are
also some special keys explained in the @{"keyboard reference" link "keys" 0}.
Note that you can always have a look at the keyboard reference
during the game by simply pressing the HELP key.

If you really need a more detailed explanation of the user
interface download GRAAL from aminet game/role.


@{u}NOTE ON SAVING@{uu}

You can bring up the save/load requester by pressing the
'S' or the 'L' key. You should save from time to time. Not
because you can die in this game but because the game could
crash. Well, I gave my best to avoid nasty bugs, but you never
can be sure that the game is 100% error free. So better save!

@{i}STORY AND GRAPHICS: @{ui}

The game was written and the graphics were drawn by the part-time
dadaist @{"Rainer Appel" link "author" 0} (that's me) in 1999.

All graphic-artwork was done with DPaintV and ImageEngineer. I've
drawn the pictures in a resolution of 640x512 at first. Then I did
some image processing with ImageEngineer (gaussian blur and scaling
down to 320x256). Then I used DPaintV again to do some "fine tuning"
and to get the rigth colors.

DpaintV was created by Daniel Silva, Lee Ozer, Dallas Hodgson and
Chuck Swan. It is © by Electronic Arts.

ImageEngineer is © by Simon Edwards. It is Shareware and you can
download it from Aminet.


@{i}MUSIC: @{ui}

I've used some of my own modules and some modules I've found on
Aminet for this game.

Modules by Martin Teichmann: brainbird-song, my mind is a space,
second techno.

Modules by Johan Alpmar: wave after wave, never until now, standing
lowground, pussdub, the infinite, mahassna, quite infinite

The "Tango Love Song" is from lizardking/alcatraz.

The title track "Foxy Lady" was ©omposed by "jimi hendrix of melon"
and a little bit modified by me.


@{i}GRAAL: @{ui}

The GRAAL Adventure Language system was written by Per Thulin.
Download it from Aminet in the game/role directory.


@{i}JOKES: @{ui}

The parrot joke is from Monty Python's "Pet Shop Sketch".

The whales joke is from a Simpsons episode. (Where Lisa falls
in love to Nelson)

All other jokes by @{"me" link "author" 0} :-)
