SAY But I don't think you have any reason to be ashamed! Come on, get out.
RESP R,19,You don't understand the problem. The problem is not that I'm ashamed.
RESP R,19,The problem is that the creator of this game was too lazy to draw the animation for me climbing out of the cauldron.
RESP R,19,That's the reason why you have to leave this location before I can get out of here.
SAY Ah, I see. Ok then, goodbye!
RESP R,19,Goodbye!
