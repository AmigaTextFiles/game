	CATACOMB is a graphic adventure game set on a small island in the
middle of the land of EXOUSIA. Your quest is to discover the secrets and
treasures of this underground maze while staying alive. The rest of the
setting is presented in the introduction.

	SETUP: To play CATACOMB simply click on the CATACOMB icon OR CD to
the catacomb directory and type "PROJ2 CATACOMB" from CLI. CATACOMB is
very happy running from a HD. simply copy the entire catacomb directory to
the HD. names are not important but the files must be in the same
directory. CATACOMB looks for the "run" command in the c: directory. it
must be there to play the game. Hope this is not a problem, but is was
unavoidable. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------	

	CATACOMB is very easy to interact with. You simply point and
click on the different controls displayed on the stone wall. There are
also optional keyboard commands that can be used entirely or in
conjunction with the mouse. The commands are as follows:

	ICON	   COMMAND	KEY 	EXPLANATION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	EYE	   LOOK,      	-L-	THIS COMMAND WILL GIVE YOU A BRIEF
		   EXAMINE		DESCRIPTION OF WHAT IS IN A ROOM.
	
	LIGHT      THINK      	-T-	THIS COMMAND PUTS YOU INTO THE 
	BULB                            MIND OF A TRUE ADVENTURER...

	UPSTAIRS   GO UP	-U-     ASCEND IF POSSIBLE.

	HAMMER     USE 	      -SPACE-	THIS ALLOWS YOU TO THEN SELECT WITH
                                        THE MOUSE THE OBJECT YOU WISH TO
					MANIPULATE

	CHEST	   OPEN		-O-	THIS WILL OPEN ANY OBJECT ON THE 		
                                        SCREEN THAT CAN BE OPENED

	DOWNSTAIRS GO DOWN      -D- 	DESCEND IF POSSIBLE

	UP ARROW   NORTH	-8-     MOVE NORTH IF POSSIBLE 
		
	DOWN ARROW SOUTH	-2-     MOVE SOUTH IF POSSIBLE 

	LEFT ARROW WEST 	-4-     MOVE WEST IF POSSIBLE 

	RIGHT      EAST 	-6-     MOVE EAST IF POSSIBLE 
        ARROW

				

	TO PICK UP AN OBJECT SIMPLY CLICK ON IT WITH THE MOUSE. IT WILL
THEN BE ADDED TO YOUR INVENTORY.

	AN EXPLANATION OF THE MOVEMENT METHOD IS NECCESSARY. THE FOUR
ARROW BUTTONS REPRESENT THE FOUR COMPASS DIRECTIONS. THE ARROW POINTING UP
IS ALWAYS NORTH, DOWN IS ALWAYS SOUTH, ETC. THE DIRECTION YOU ARE
CURRENTLY FACING IS DISPLAYED IN THE COMPASS BELOW THE OPTION BUTTONS. THE
AVAILABLE DIRECTIONS FOR MOVEMENT ARE SHOWN BY SILVER DIRECTIONAL DISKS
PLACED ON AVAILABLE DIRECTION BUTTONS. THIS WILL BECOME QUITE CLEAR AS YOU
PLAY THE GAME. 
	KEEP IN MIND THAT THE ROOM PICTURE MAY SHOW A PATH OR DOORWAY
DIRECTLY AHEAD OF YOU, BUT IF YOU ARE FACING EAST, THE "UP" (NORTH) ARROW
WILL ACTUALLY LEAD YOU THROUGH THE DOOR TO THE LEFT. IN OTHER WORDS, THE
DIRECTION BUTTONS ARE CONSTANT, BUT THE DIRECTION YOU FACE IS NOT. PAY
CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE COMPASS. I'M SORRY IF THIS IS CONFUSING, AND IT
WILL BE IMPROVED ON VERSION 2. 

	TO QUIT OR RESTART HIT THE -ESC- KEY.
