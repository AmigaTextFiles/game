A. How to install ADOM
----------------------

  When  installing ADOM you have two choices. Either you choose the automatic
  installation with the Installer or you install it by hand.

  и Using Installer

    Extract  the  archive into a temporary directory (e.g. RAM: disk). Double
    click  the Installer icon to start the installation. Follow the on screen
    instructions.

  и Manual installation

    Extract the archive into a temporary directory (e.g. RAM: disk). Create a
    target  directory  (e.g.  Adom) and copy all files (except the Installer)
    into this directory.

  If  you  want to be able to call ADOM from anywhere in your system you must
  set the environment variable 'ADOM_HOME' to the directory in which ADOM was
  installed.


B. Using the launcher window
----------------------------

  ADOM  now  has  a  launcher  window  which  simplifies  the change of Amiga
  specific  settings  like  screenmode  or font. The usage should be obvious,
  therefore  I only give some additional comments. The launcher window can be
  closed with the space, escape, return or "r" key.

  и Screen Type

    You  can  select  wether ADOM should open its own custom screen or should
    open  the  window  on a publicscreen. To use the publicscreen you need at
    least Kickstart 3.0!

  и Screenmode

    Within  the screenmode window you change the screenmode which ADOM should
    use  for  the custom screen. The list only contains screenmodes which can
    be  used  by  ADOM (modes like HAM or EHB are not displayed). You can use
    the cursor up/down keys to step through the list.

  и Publicscreen

    Within  the  publicscreen  window you change the name of the publicscreen
    which  ADOM  should  use.  The  list  contains  all actual publicscreens.
    Attention: the game only checks if the publicscreen can be used after you
    start it! You can use the cursor up/down keys to step through the list.

  и Font

    Within  the  font  window you change the name, size and style of the font
а   which  ADOM  should  use.  The  fonts for custom and public screen can be
    changed  separately.  The list only contains non proportional fonts which
    fit  onto  the  currently selected screen! You can use the cursor up/down
    keys to step through  the  list.  You can change the size with the cursor
    left/right keys.

  и About

    Some informations about ADOM.

C. Changing the tooltypes
-------------------------

  It is not recommended that you change the tooltypes by yourself. But if you
  really need to change one of the settings, here is a list of all tooltypes:

  и SCREEN_TYPE = <integer value>

    Screen type: 0 = custom screen, 1 = public screen

  и DISPLAY_ID = <hexadecimal value>

    Display id used for custom screen

  и PUBLICSCREEN = <name>

    Name of publicscreen

  и TOP=<integer value>
  и LEFT=<integer value>

    Upper left position of the ADOM window on the public screen

  и CUSTOM_FONT = <name>

    Name of font used for custom screen

  и CUSTOM_SIZE = <integer value>

    Size of font used for custom screen

  и CUSTOM_STYLE = <hexadecimal value>

    Style of font used for custom screen: 0x0 = normal, 0x2 = bold

  и PUBLIC_FONT = <name>

    Name of font used for public screen

  и PUBLIC_SIZE = <integer value>

    Size of font used for public screen

  и PUBLIC_STYLE = <hexadecimal value>

    Style of font used for public screen: 0x0 = normal, 0x2 = bold

  и LAUNCHER_TOP = <integer value>
  и LAUNCHER_LEFT = <integer value>

    Upper left position of the launcher window


D. How to recover after a crash
-------------------------------

  As  much  as  I believe that there are no longer any fatal bugs in ADOM for
  Amiga  there still probably is some way to get it to crash. If ADOM crashes
а you  normally  won't  be  able  to  just restart it without risking to ruin
а further  games,  because  several  directories  used  by ADOM will be in an
а unhealthy state. If ADOM crashes while you are playing, you will have to do
а the following two things to ensure, that you can play safely:

  1) delete ".adom.prc" from the ADOM data directory (if in doubt see
     "adom -d")

  2) Enter the temporary directory (if in doubt see "adom -d") and delete all
     files in that directory. If this directory does not exist there is no
     need to worry.

  The  document  "readme.1st"  will  tell you, what to do, if you encounter a
  fatal bug in ADOM.


E. Configuration files
----------------------

  Appendix  D  in the manual (refer to the file "manual.doc") explains how to
а write a local configuration file for ADOM.


F. What is...?
--------------

  и Adom

    The executable of the game.

  иаReadme.1st

    "An attempt to answer all meta-questions regarding Adom..."

  и Manual.doc

    The manual containing all the infos necessary to play the game.

  и AdomFAQ.txt

    The official ADOM FAQ file

  и Adom-Amiga.txt

    You are reading it right now.

  и adom.data/

    A directory created by ADOM to save all data files.

  и adom.data/savedg/

    A directory created by ADOM to hold all the save files.

  и adom.data/tmpdat/

    A  temporary  directory  created by ADOM to store temporary data during a
    game. This directory should be gone after a game is ended. If this is not
    so you are probably facing a bug.

  и adom.data/adom.cfg

    The configuration file for each user.

  и adom.data/adom.kbd
