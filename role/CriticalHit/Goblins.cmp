For months the goblins have been gathering under the banner of King Gurlag. The most powerful goblin army seen since the Great War is now marching on the Border Lands. You must lead the Knight Lords to victory against the goblin army as it attacks your land.

Well done. You have driven Gurlags army back from your border. You must now defeat them at Blackthorn Pass to win a lasting peace in the land.

The goblins have invaded the Border Lands. They are now marching on your farmsteads. If the Knight Lords kingdom falls then the Inner Kingdoms will stand little chance.

The retreating goblin horde are making a stand at Blackthorn Pass. If they can be driven back from their mountain stronghold then they will no longer be a threat to the human kingdoms.

Congratulations. A lasting victory has been won against the goblins. The Border Lands will enjoy a peaceful existence for many years to come.

You have failed to push the goblins from their mountain hide out. They will regain their strength and attack your lands again soon.

The advancing goblin horde has reached the homelands of the Knight Lords. If this land is lost then there will be little to stop Gurlags march into the Inner Kingdoms.

Utter defeat has been avoided. The goblins have been driven back from your land... for the moment.

Gurlag proclaims himself King of the Outer Lands. He turns his attention to the rich human kingdoms beyond...
