CHAOS V1.01
-----------

Written by Alastair Murray in about 2 or 3 years ago
Graphics were mainly done by me with a little help from Philip Nichols.
Based on the Julian Gollup Spectrum game also called CHAOS.

Updates from V1
---------------
Simple instructions manual included
Bug Fixed that meant the computer wizards would try to move Shadow Forest
rather than just attack with it.

Newer Version (V2.0)
--------------------
I'm considering a total rewrite. (The code is soooo old and terrible).
I could definately make it better presentable while keeping the
excellent game play intact.
For this I could do with some-one to help with Graphics etc.
I can send the original graphics to anyone who wants to play
with them. (I might even make them customisable.)
What do you think?
E-mail me.
-------------------

If you haven't played it, then it will seem confusing at first but
you'll soon get the hang of it.

PLEASE mail me if you download it.

I can make the source code and/or graphics files available to anyone
who may want to fiddle with it.
