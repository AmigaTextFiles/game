@node whatitis "What it is"

	What it really is:
	------------------

	RGAE is supposed to be Nethack/Larn/Moria type game engine. I'm
	not saying that those  games were so bad that I had to write my
	own. No, not at all.  I just wanted to know am I able to do it.
	This game IS  and WILL BE freely distributable,  so you can and
	have to	spread it like hell. :) 

	As  you might  have already  noticed,  this version is  still a
	little "alpha" release.  Most general stuff  is working  like:
	inventory,   wear/takeoff  item,  pick  up  and  ascent/descent
	stairs, but  many things  are not even  implemented yet.  (See:
	@{" To do list " link todolist}) Many things are added since last version, so check
	out also the @{" new features ",link newthings} list.

	If you are wondering why this engine is so small (about 25 kb),
	I  can say  that it  has been  written completely  in assembly.
	Sources are "only" 180 kb,  but wait  until you  see the  final
	version.  It  has been   compiled  with  SNMA V2.054b.  SNMA is
	copyrighted 1993-1995 by Samu Nuojua. 

	RGAE is not the name of the final game. I just didn't know what
	kind of  name would be good.  Thanks to all  who have  given me
	those weird name suggestions. ;)

	Oh, one more thing:  there exists a lot of things that have NOT
	been documented yet. Explore the dungeons  carefully, you never
	know what'll happen...

@node mistakes "Known bugs/disadvantages"

	Bugs'n'disadvantages:
	---------------------

	Not so long  time ago I realised that my  graphic routine for RGAE
	was  way too slow.  I tried to increase speed by  many efforts but
	the  result seemed to be  worse and worse.  Finally I removed  the
	whole routines and wrote totally new ones.  This time I hit needed
	gfx directly into BitPlane memory.

	No rules have been  broken except that the  game may not work with
	graphical booster cards (such as Cybervision etc) I haven't tested
	this on  graphic cards, so  it's impossible to say  anything sure,
	but at least I  think  that if RGAE  is not  working with  graphic
	cards then this might be the problem.  If there is someone who can
	actually inform me about this thing, then please do so.

	Because I just  (few seconds  ago) fixed  a nasty bug  from  throw
	routine,  there may not be too many bugs. Or at least I don't know
	about them. Oh yes. There really exists few ones:

	* Scroller can  be slow on slower amigas,  but that's the price of
	  multitasking  environment.  ScrollRaster()  routine is scrolling
	  the screen,  so you  might imagine  that it  isn't  the  fastest
	  around.
	* You  cannot use  left alt  and amiga  as  LMB  anymore.  When  I 
	  switched my  message handling  routines to use  RAWKEY messages,
	  left amiga and alt stopped working.
	* Sometimes when you use some Shift or CTRL combination you may be
	  unable to  move or the character remains in  continous run mode.
	  Just press shift or CTRL again to return to normal mode.

	I'm sure something has slipped through my fingers and if something
	like that has happened, then make a report.  Fixed bug is always a
	better bug. I think you already know my @{" address " link address}.

	Thanks for those who  have already reported  some errors. You know
	who you are.

@node goal "How to complete the game"

	Goal:
	-----

	Actually there is no goal. This is just a test version where
	exists some swell items to test. Some @{" new features " link newthings are
	also available for testing. 

	No matter what, I think you can find some fun from this.

@endnode

@node todolist "To do list"

	To do list:
	-----------

	As an "demo" release this game has a long list of uncomplete
	things.

	- More items and gfx. (what, even more :)
	- 100-200 different monsters. Or course with different behaviours.
	- 32 predesigned levels. Yes, there will be puzzles, and
	  other cool stuff to bother your brains. :)
	- Secret levels, and yes, secret underground town(s).
	- Separate character generator.
	- Improved shops with bargain option.
	- Some graphical tricks, like different light sources. (street posts)
	- Flexible game engine will allow you to design own adventures.
	  For this purpose I'll write an adventure editor.
	- Perhaps even Sound Fx.
	- I dumped the idea of serial link 2 player mode. Instead I'm thinking
	  to add an net game possibility, using AmiTCP. I also thought that
	  this improvement would make the game ShareWare. Don't worry, it'll
	  be a separate version. This game is and will be FreeWare.
	- Lot's of lot's more.

	  Please contact me if you have a suggestion/wish that would make
	the game even more interesting. There doesn't exist a dumb idea.
	Remember that. @{" Contact me " link address}

@node system "System Requirements"

	System requirements:
	--------------------

	You will need...

	- CyberStorm 50 Mhz '060 Turbo.
	- 512 MB of free RAM.

	Ha ha, just a joke... :=) This is not a PeeCee nor Windows(tm)
	game :E

	Actually you need...

	- OS 1.3 or above.
	- About 100 kb of free chip memory ...
	- ... and about 120 kb of any other memory.
	- About 140 kb of disk space for game.
	- And an empty disk for save games, if every slot is used. That is
	  about 800 kb. This size will be reduced in future.
	- Possibly you will also need a color monitor, such as Philips
	  CM8833-I/II because these 16 colors might look a bit blurry on
	  TV.

@endnode

@node wizard "Wizard/Debug mode"

	Wizard/Debug mode
	-----------------

    WARNING: This game's  debug mode is not the usual one.  It is only
             meant to  debug the game.  It can be  used as a  discover
             mode, although  I don't recommend it. It's easy to  crash
             the whole machine.

	By entering  this debug-mode  the game  will remove  different
	check  routines allowing you for example to run through walls.
	This means that you  can run out from  the screen and  mess up
	with  memory that  doesn't belong  to RGAE.  This causes  most
	usually crashes to guru 81000005 or 8100000F.

	It's  true that  when your  hitpoints are not decreasing,  and
        food and water statuses  are stable, the game can be very much
	easier.  That's why this mode can be  used as a discover mode.
	Do remember  that I wrote these  routines only for  debugging,
	so don't blame me if you gain some hardware or software damage
	from possible crashes. I TAKE NO RESPOSIBILITY.

	I could hide the keyboard combination to enter to  debug-mode,
	but because it's  easy to seek the correct combination there's
	no use to hide it.  Someone will most  likely discover  it, no
	matter what. Use ctrl-w to enter the debug-mode.

	This mode will be removed in full version, but until then, use
	with caution.

@node newthings "History list."

	V0.020a
	-------
	- First release, very poor, (I think :)

	V0.040a
	-------

	- New map system. Allows 65536 different items in game.
	- Intuition-gadget interface. (keyboard shortcuts still missing)
	- Multicolor messages.
	- Multicolor inventory.
	- Throw option.
	- New filesystem. Holds the game in memory in three parts.
	  Each part about 30 kb. Shouldn't be too much.
	- Better load and save options (probably with bugs).
	- Few tools added. (Hand missile, keys...)
	- 16-color graphics drawn by Sami Kemilä. Greatest @{" Thanks " link thanks}
	  man... :)
	- RGAE font removed.
	- Little explosion routine written. Lousy routine but good enough for
	  alpha version.
	- @{" Wizard/debug mode. " link wizard}
	- 100 new items added in data files.
	- Food and water added.
	- Some weapons added.
	- Cast option. RGAE has NO spells yet, but the spell routine is
	  ready.
	- Many routines debugged and optimized. See also @{" disadvantages " link mistakes}

	V0.044d
	-------
	- A bug in AGuide file fixed. Never use comma before link command.
	- Can be launched from WorkBench, but it requires an assign COC:
	  into game directory.
	- Hopefully no more load and save problems.
	- Keyboard shortcuts for gadgets added. Yippee. :)
	- RGAE window changed to be borderless -> more space for map.
	- Size of map changed from 51*22 to 78*18. -> Memory usage raised
	  about 20 kb.
	- "New game" gadget replaced by "Options" gadget, although there
	  is no options menu yet.
	- New graphics for explosions. Check it out :)
	- Encryption system developed. Uses random-kind crypt seed.
	- New mapping routine. Heavily more realisctic than the last one.
	- To break doors they usually have to be kicked more than once.
	- Some misspellings fixed.
	- Little improvements added here and there.

	V0.052a
	-------
	- If correct level file wasn't found when descenting stairs, the
          game would usually crash. Fixed.
	- No more food and water loss, if no action was made. For ex. by
          pressing shift and other exotic keys you could lower the food and
          water level. Fixed.
	- A routine to keep the floors separately in memory. Removes few
	  graphical bugs, and gives more possibilities in creating levels.
	- Run mode. Hold down shift to run.
	- Town created. Shops added also, but you cannot visit them yet.
	- Improved DisplayInventory routine.
	- New items added to data files.
	- About 100 items added into data files.
	- Fire power removed, because the game will be happening in
	  about 1920s. There were no Nuclear missiles in 1920s :(
	- Regeneration routine added. Player regenerates in every 50 turn.
	- More intelligent system created for mapping. Thanks are going
	  to my maths teacher.
	- Routine for palette fading written. This will be an option when I
	  get my options window working.
	- Somehow workign randomnumber generator. It's used in many new
	  things.
	- Some routines optimized.

	V0.060s
	-------
	- The player is defined now with 4 values: physical strength, 
	  intelligence, mental strength and dexterity. However, only 
	  physical strength has an effect currently. Play the game, you'll
	  see how.
	- TADAA!! Working shops. Too bad you cannot bargain yet.

	V0.2
	----
	- We're closing the full version.... :)
	- Routines for monsters written. This version includes 4 differently
	  acting monsters. One of them is invisible.
	- Can you believe, you can even smash a door on monsters to kill them
	  Boy, I love Dungeon Master. :) Of cource you can kick 'em and throw
	  items on them, and... 
	- Routines for following statuses written: hallucination, poisoned
	  invisible, paralyzed, confused, stunned. Monsters have these: 
	  Ability to open doors, invisible, fire resistant, cold resistant,
	  friendly, undead. More will follow.
	- A system that allows multiple items in one place at a time. You know
	  NetHack. No more messages: "No space to drop here". Because of this
	  new feature I had to rewrite almost thw whole game. That's why this
	  took so much time.
	- Simple and separate mapeditor for level editing. See MapEditor.guide
	  for more details.
	- Items in shops are now displayed with item graphics.
	- About 250 new items in datafiles.
