@node what "What can you do with this editor"

	What can/can't you do with this editor
	--------------------------------------

	RGAE Level editor is meant to be a tool to generate your own levels
	and adventures for RGAE.  However, this version of editor cannot do
	anything  else than edit one levelfile at a time, and you certainly
	are not able to  generate your own adventures.  Example: you cannot
	place items on maps and the editor doesn't understand few mappieces
	yet. But as I mentioned, this is a simple alpha.

	Full  version of this editor  will be released with RGAE  itself or
	soon after it. It'll be freeware as RGAE will be, but I'd like that
	if you manage to make an adventure all by yourself, you should send
	it to me. If this  project gets a lot of  spectators then I'm going
	to start  collecting a library  that contains different  adventures
	for RGAE.

	This version updates following things since V0.9a
	 - Map piece follows mouse on map window.
	 - Several bugs in AGuide docs fixed.
	 - Level file names changed from *.enl to *.map. Check out the
	   Levels/ subdirectory.

	As you  might already guess,  RGAE will be just an  flexible engine
	behind all this.

@node information "Information about level files"

	Info about RGAE level files:
	----------------------------

	I've collected some information about levels files that you need to
	know before doing anything.

	RGAE's levelfiles contain 3 sections each.  One with mapdata. It's
	called  "The ForeGround".  And one  with some  special data.  It's
	called "The BackGround". The last section  is used to hold visited
	places in memory but that doesn't  affect levelfile  generation at
	all.

	  3+-------+	
           |       |	Think the sections like they were limited like this:
	 2+-------+|	1 = The ForeGround
          |       |+	2 = The BackGround
	1+-------+|	3 = Section for holding visited places in memory.
	 |       |+	
	 |       |
	 +-------+

	The ForeGround contains all  that data  what is visible  to user at
	first  time he  wanders  around the  level. All  objects and  items
	were  stored in this  section, but now  the system allows  multiple
	items in one place at a time, so this section holds nothing but map
	pieces.  The BackGround  is not visible to  user unless he  somehow
	removes something from ForeGround.

	Let's take  an example: User is a  powerful mage and he is about to
	cast an fireball. He misses the enemy and fireball strikes the wall
	behind the  monster.  Fireball is so powerful  that it removes all
	wall pieces in explosion. So, now the ForeGround in  this explosion
	is removed and  the BackGround  is "copied"  to the ForeGround. The
	BackGround becomes visible and all other things in it.

	This would  mean that a powerful mage could  crash the whole  level
	with just fireballs,  but what if  you put walls  on the  BackGround
	on the same spots that ForeGround walls are located.  Then when this
	explosion  happens,  the ForeGround  walls are  removed,  BackGround
	walls  are copied  on ForeGround,  and the  visible  result is  that
	nothing  happens. Walls  remain there  so it  makes an  illuson that
	these  walls are unbreakable.  ***  The items that are stored in the
	BackGround cannot be removed or destroyed ***

	If there is  nothing defined in the  BackGround and  that  explosion
	happens, then FloorType1 will will be copied on the foreground. Note
	that this means that if  you use some else  FloorType than 1 on your
	map, then the floors you use must be put into BackGround also. You
	probably now understand that if that explosion happens on FloorType2
	and nothing is defined in the BackGround then 8 pieces of FloorType1
	will be copied on the  ForeGround. Believe me  that in the middle of
	FloorType2, the FloorType1 looks very ugly. :)

	Do you get my point:

	 1) Build a level on The ForeGround.
	 2) Place all those mappieces on The BackGround you like NOT to be
	    destryed in explosions or similiar.
	 3) Don't worry about the 3rd mapsection.
	 4) Save the map and rename it into Level01.map, so you can test it
	    with RGAE.
	 5) Fix errors which more probably are caused by the BackGround.
	    So, go back to 2. :)

	Please @{" contact me " link contact} if you have problems. I'd like to see levels that
	are generated by someone else that me, but that's not going to
	happen if I have written bad instructions. Please, ask if you have
	problems, and please send me your levels. Perhaps they will be added
	in RGAE full release.

@node usage "How to use"

	How to use this editor:
	-----------------------

	Editor is build to be very simple to use.. :) The area where the map
	is  constructed  is placed in  the same spot than  in the real game.
	Editor screen has 3 gadgets  for actions and  20 gadgets to choose a
	map piece. 

	The gadget above map pieces is meant to be a browser for map pieces.
	Firstly there  are walls and walls  with secret  door in them on the
	screen. By clicking  this browse  gadget it  moves into next  row of
	map pieces which contains stairs, open doors and  locked doors. This
	is  the way  you browse  through map  pieces. There are  about 80 of
	them.

	I think save and quit gadgets'  purpose is quite clear.  Load option
	is not implemented yet,  and most probably  won't ever be, bacause I
	lost the sources in a crash. :( I have to write a new editor.

	The chosen mappiece is surrounded  with white box. Use LMB on screen
	to draw  with that map  piece. RMB can be used to clean  pieces from
	screen. It uses always the floor  type which looks black. You cannot
	change this yet.

	Editor has few keyboard commands also:

	SpaceBar	- Switch between ForeGround and BackGround view.
	Del		- Copy ForeGround into BackGround.
	~ (below ESC)	- Clear map.
	s		- Show secret doors.

	See the meaning of ForeGround and BackGround from @{" levelfile info " link information}
	section.

	That copy option is useful when you have a lot  of stuff you want to
	hold in  background also. You just  have to build the foreground and
	then copy the whole  thing into background with one button. Then you
	only have to clean the background up to fit in your purposes.

@node pieces "List of current mappieces"

	Selection 1: Solid walls and walls with hidden passages.
	--------------------------------------------------------
	This is obvious, isn't it? Use solid walls to build the main
	structure of the maze and then place secret doors in it, to make
	it more... fascinating?? :) After placing those secret doors
	you can relocate them by pressing letter "s".


	Selection 2: Stairs, open doors and locked doors.
 	-------------------------------------------------
	Stairs include 4 pieces:
	  a) Normal stairs to up.
	  b) Normal stairs to down.
	  c) Closed trap door and..
	  d) ..opened trapdoor.
	Make sure that if you generate more that 1 level, then you should
	take care that the stairs are placed on each other. I mean that
	there should be stairs waiting for you when you descend.

	Opened doors mean the they can be opened without keys. And locked
	doors need that key of course. However, there's not much point in
	using locked doors since you cannot place items on maps yet.


	Selection 3: Floors and houseroofs.
	-----------------------------------
	It's your decision what kind of floor you use. Just pick the best.
	House roofs are used in town.


	Selection 4: Misc graphics and shops.
	-------------------------------------
	Misc graphics include: Water, trees, fences, pits, radioctivity and
	gold. Shops are the same shops that are in town. They are in this
	order:
	  a) Weapon shop
	  b) Armor shop
	  c) Book shop
	  d) Drink shop
	  e) General store and training hall.


	I hope these instructions are enough for you to generate your own
	mazes. I also hope this shows you what kind of editor is coming for
	adventure editting purposes. Contact me and comment this. I'd 
	appreciate any mail from the users of my programs.
