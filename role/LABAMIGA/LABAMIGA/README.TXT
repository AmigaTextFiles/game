INTRODUCTION

This archive contains the adventure game The Labyrinth of Time 
for the Amiga computer. The game requires AmigaDOS 1.3 or later, 
1 Meg of chip RAM and 512 KB of fast RAM. It is known to run fine 
under UAE (an Amiga emulator).

Although this is almost the same version that was originally 
released for the Amiga CDTV and CD32, it does not contain the 
files that would allow it to boot on those consoles.

Once you have dearchived the files, open the LABAMIGA drawer and 
double-click on THE_LABYRINTH icon to start the game.

Warning: Because this game was designed to run on a CDTV or CD32, 
the game does not provide a way to exit the game. You will have 
to reboot your computer stop the game.

The Windows, Mac OS X and Linux versions of the game can be 
purchased at The Wyrmkeep Entertainment Co. web site – see the 
contact information at the bottom of this document.
