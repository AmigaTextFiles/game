                          -----------------

                This game is copyright E.W.Clay 1994.
                  Written using Amos Professional.

Starting the game
-----------------

   Double-click on the 'Lost_prince' icon. An animated introduction plays,
then the game begins.
   You can skip the introduction by holding the left mouse button down.

How to play The Lost Prince
---------------------------

   You control Prince Rindlepoke, on a mission to do whatever comes into his
head. Use the mouse to direct his actions. Click with the left mouse button
in the top part of the screen to walk around. Clicking on something with the
right mouse button will have different effects depending on which verb is
highlighted. The available verbs are these:

   Examine - Prints a description of the object.
   Use     - Lets you use something (believe it or not).
   Use..on - Use an object on another object.
   Take    - Pick up, remove, steal, that sort of thing.
   Talk    - You can work this one out.
   Options - This is not actually a verb.

Hints
-----

   * Examine everything; this will often give clues. Some options only
     become available once you have found the clue. The environment of
     The Lost Prince is not static, it changes depending on what you do.

   * Not all items have a use, and some need to be used in several places.
     nearly all background objects register under the pointer, but it is up
     to you to discover which ones are relevant to the puzzles.

   * It is impossible to reach a situation from which you can't proceed
     but it is possible to mess things up so that the game will end.
     Save occasionally just in case.

   * Some objects can bo combined to make new ones.

   * A combination of imagination and logical thinking will lead to the
     solution eventually.

Saving the game
---------------

   Insert your save game disk, then click on Options (I told you it wasn't a
verb). The directory is loaded. Type a name, then click on save. Loading a
game is similar. Click on the name, then on load. Other options (hence the
name) are:

   Text Speed - Move the slider with the mouse. Note - you can clear text
                with the left mouse button when you have read it.

   Game - Resume without loading a game.

   Quit - But you won't want to do that.

General Comments
----------------

   First, an apology for not including any sound effects in the game. I had
prepared a bank of samples, but when I tried to use them I found a
compatibility problem between the med library (which plays the music) and
the AMOS sound system. In other words, it was music or sound effects but not
both. I sent my AMOS system disk back to Europress asking if they could fix
the problem, but they just sent the disk back, after 'updating' it to an
older version (thanks a lot). Anyway, I chose to keep the music, so you will
have to use your imagination as far as sounds go.
   There were a lot of trees in medieval times, so a fantasy game has to
include quite a number of them. After drawing more trees than I can count,
I've had enough. Therefore, I have no plans for a sequel. There will be more
games, but set in the future, after trees have (hopefully) become extinct
due to climatic changes.
