            IMPORTANT INSTALLATION INFORMATION
*********************************************************************************

1. Create a Drawer named "GQ2Demo" on any partition.
2. Extract the Archive GQ2Demo into the Drawer "GQ2Demo" you just created.
3. There  are four files that must remain in the drawer for the Demo to play:
 GQ2_Demo.AED, GQdemo.amin, AnimatEDPlay (AnimateED v1.52 by Marco Vigelius) and
 musix-shine.mod (from Amos PD CD - author unknown).
4. Additionaly, ensure you have the Pal Driver in the DEVS Monitor Drawer as the
 anim is set to play in Pal Low Res.

That's it. Double Click the "GQ_Demo.AED icon" and the demo animation will play. It
 is a little more than 4 minutes long giving you a sence of the adventure.

The animation should play on any amiga 1MB or higher, OS 2.0 or higher. The
 faster the  Amiga the better viewing experience of course.

Requirements
------------

Any Amiga with Workbench 2.0 or higher and at least 1mb Chip Ram. (2MB Chip Ram
prefered, this is a graphically intensive game).The game will run on the 68000 
CPU, but it will run faster & smoother on the 68020 & higher Processors. 
On an emulated Amiga, the play is seamless with literaly no wait for room loads 
and smooth animations.


History
-------
I started working on this game in 2000, and was  nearing completion around 2002. 
but life happened and I did not complete it. I almost finished the story, but
 never refined it or  tested it, just no time. I uploaded the very buggy
 incomplete version I had to Aminet, which among others issues, and unknown to me,
 was infected with the <Happy New Year 96> virus. So, we removed it from Aminet.
 
Fast Forward 20 years later; now that I am retired, I resurected all my old
 projects in hopes to see them to completion. 

This is the first of 4 projects I started (please note GQ1 was simply a trial and
 error of how to use GRAC2, and not afilliated with this series)
I have 3 more chapters written in this Geo's Quest series which will form part of
 GQ3,"Geo's Quest - Gateway to Nowhere" and a prequel of how it all began for
 George.

I re-worked this chapter with new graphics, incorporated dozens of(PD) sound
 effects, wrote and incorporated music, re-wrote the story line, added rooms,
 closeups and new characters. In all I have spent over 500 hours fixing and 
redoing the game.

The game engine is Edmond Clay's Grac2 based on AMOS Professional. I have attempted 
to test the game thoroughly but alas I am my own beta tester and GRAC2 has bugs. 
Unfortunately, the game freezes unexpectedly at random locations, and not
 repeatedly.

For this reason, the game will be freely distributable. How can one expect any
 donation for a shareware product that may, or may not crash on ocassion?

The game was developed initially on an A1200 w/030 card & 16mb ram. After I sold
 that in 2007, then resurected this project in late 2021, I used my Macbook Air
 with FS-UAE but wasn't satisfied with the "feel" so I searched ebay for an A600
 or A1200, and after recovering from heart failure at seeing the prices !!!OMG!!!,
 I found an A1200 w/8mb ram  I could afford and completed it on that. 

Yes the Mac was so much faster, but banging this old keyboard, and experiencing the
 ocassional GURU error made the experience all the more original.

The game play is intended for teens and up. Although there are some light adult 
situations and minor language,there is no violance, blood, death or shooting. 
You will not die anytime you make a wrong choice, if fact you can't die anywhere
in this game. You will be able to end the game rather easily. The game has several 
branches to it depending on what choices you make leading to different rooms, 
adventures etc. So, it can be played multiple times and appear like a different 
game at various points.

It is intentionaly designed in the nastalga genre modelled after the Roberta
 Williams Sierra low resolution 32 colour Quests (King Quest 3,4, etc). 
There are over 100 hand drawn rooms and close ups, dozens of characters, plenty of
puzzles, many sfx, songs, mazes and more. It, along with future chapters, are  a
 parody of the Commadore story. (names intentionally misspelled so not to infringe
 or offend).

I will be uploading the game soon (hopefully) following this demo release. 
I am still testing it trying to find resolutions to the GRAC2 bugs causing the
ocassional freezes.

So hang in there. If you like what you see in the demo, you should be able to find 
it soon on Aminet, or you can email me your interest in having the game, and once
 it is ready for distribution I will  email you an archived file of the game. Then
 it's off to completing GQ3. :-)

Peace, and remember what those great philosopher's of the 80's Bill & Ted said

                    "Be Excellent to Each Other Dudes"
