IMPORTANT!!! READ THIS BEFORE LOADING STAR TREK!!!

Some files have been removed from Tobias' Star Trek game, from
DISK NUMBER ONE ONLY.  This is because these files are original WorkBench
files and programs, copyright Commodore Business Machines and they may
not be freely-distributed in this form.  What follows is a listing of
the Tobias Star Trek Game, DISK ONE ONLY and the files that are not
included in the .WRP upload where you found this have been marked
with two asterisks (**) and are NOT on this disk, so you need to
put them back on DISK ONE.

You will need to copy the marked (**) files back over to the Tobias
Star Trek DISK ONE disk from your own WorkBench disk, version 1.3,
1.3.1, or 1.3.2 (do NOT use files earlier than version 1.3!!). I have
no idea if the corresponding ARP commands will work or not.  I didn't
try them.   

Everything marked with a double asterisk (**) below will be found
in the same-named directories on your own WorkBench disks except
for "FastMemFirst" which will be found on your WorkBench disk in
the SYSTEM drawer.  Thus, all the files **marked in the "C" directory
below need to be copied over from your WorkBench:C directory to
the Star Trek Disk One C: directory, and the files **marked in the
LIBS: directory below need to be copied over from your WorkBench:Libs
directory, and so on.  The *ONLY* exception to all of this is
"FastMemFirst" which goes in C: on the Star Trek DISK ONE but is
found in the SYSTEM drawer on your WorkBench disk.  Got it? Good!

See the end of this file for a couple more notes.

A COUPLE MORE NOTES:

1. This game was designed by its author for European Amigas with a PAL
video display.  If you load the game directly from its WorkBench
icon (rather than rebooting off its disks) the game will come up in
PAL mode, and many of the game's important control windows will not
be entirely visible on your screen.  You will not be able to click
your mouse on some important gadgets and generally, you will not have
good time.

This disk has a program called "PatchNTSC" in its C: directory.  If you
intend to play the game by running it from its icon rather than
booting off of it then you should issue this command before you do so:

STGAME:C/PATCHNTSC <return>

This will run the PatchNTSC program so the game display will shift into
a hi-res mode (kinda looks like a 70mm movie screen) and all game
gadgets will then be visible.  After quitting out of the game and
returning to your WorkBench you just issue that command a second time
to turn off that video patch routine.

IF you boot off the Star Trek disk one game disk you can ignore this
advice as the PatchNTSC program will run automatically from the disk's
startup-sequence.

2.  The documentation for Star Trek supplied on this disk is in German.
I don't read nor speak German so I couldn't translate it.  If, in the
future, someone can translate this documentation into English, we'll
post it as a separate file in the Amiga Zone on People/Link where you
can download it and replace the German version with an English version.
