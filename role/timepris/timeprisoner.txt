                               Time Prisoner
                Released 950411 - (c) 1995 Niklas Mattsson

This is a VERY small adventure game that I wrote to test out the ADMS
adventure game creator... And since I liked it I will start writing a
bigger adventure now. Since this is NetMailWare you may spread it to anyone
you wish, but only if all the files are included! You may not modify any of
the files in any way. If you play this game you MUST write me a netmail and
tell me (thats the rules of a NetMailWare:)). These files should be
included in the package:

TimePrisoner
TimePrisoner.info
TimePrisoner.txt
ADMSPlay

My credits to Adam Daves, the writer of ADMS. 

And remeber, this is NetMailWare and it is distributed "as is". I can not
be made responsible for ant damage caused by the program. Use at your own
risk. 


Waiting to hear from ya!
