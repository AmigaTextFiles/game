    This is an Amiga port of Sangband 0.9.5, yet another variant of Angband.

    Sangband [Skills Angband] allocates experiences to skills, rather than
have the concept of character level. So while killing monsters gains you
experience (as normal), it's up to you how you invest that experience; you
may choose to increase your endurance, or weapon skills, etc.

@node "Requirements" "Requirements..."
@next "Installation"
                            @{b}Requirements@{ub}

@{b}Absolute Minimum@{ub}

You'll need at *least* this to run plain Angband.

Kickstart 1.3
1.5 Mb of memory
68000 - a faster processor is nice, but by no means necessary.

@{b}Recommended Level@{ub}

This is what I'd recommend to get the most out of SAngband:

Kickstart 3.0 or better
2Mb of memory
68020 or better.
A Hard drive.

Note that usage under 1.3 is somewhat restricted. As from this point, extra
1.3 code is pretty unlikely to happen; I'm going to assume that everyone
has 2.04 or better. The game will still run under 1.3, but you won't be able
to use many of the advanced features.

@endnode

@node "Installation" "Installing Angband"
@next "Differences"
                            @{b}Installing Angband@{ub}

Installing Angband is straightforward. I`ve not provided an Installer script
because it doesn't need one.

   Installing to Hard disc:

      Just unpack the archive to a directory of your choice.

      If you have a KS 2.0 or better system that's all you'll need to do. To
      run SAngband, just run the program 'bin/SAngband'



      If you only have Kickstart 1.3, you'll also need to:

      Place these two commands in your 'S:startup-sequence', or, better, make
       a small script file with these two lines in and execute that everytime
       you want to start Angband:

      assign SAngband: DH1:Games/Angband
      path add SAngband:bin

      Replace 'DH1:Games/SAngband' with your path. Note that 'SAngband:'
      needs to point to the directory containing 'file', 'data', 'apex' etc.

   3.2. Floppy installation

      You can (just about) install 'SAngband' onto floppy discs, but it's
      pretty tight. Compression utils might help.

      First get two empty (and formatted) discs. Name the first one
      'SAngband', and call the second 'AMain' (or something). Assuming
      you've extracted the archive somewhere (RAM: ??), copy the 'bin'
      directory to 'AMain'. Everything else ought to go on the 'SAngband:'
      disc.

      You (probably) won't be able to fit everything on the second disc
      I suggest you delete the sound files, and/or the help files. And the
      graphics if you don't use them.

      I`m guessing everyone still using an Amiga has a hard drive these days.
      You cam mail me if you`re having trouble running from floppies.

                            @{b}Playing Angband@{ub}

   Assuming you have Angband installed properly, just run the 'bin/SAngband'
   file. Note you can use the '-u' option to load a previous savefile; if
   you don't specify one, SAngband will attempt to load the one you last
   used.

   SAngband -uMark         (or whatever your savefile is called)

   Type SAngband -? for a list of options.

   Note AngMan now has some (very basic) save file handling. As always,
   its being worked on.

                            @{b}Special Notes@{ub}

First, see the @{"Amiga features" link "Specific" 0} section if you haven't
already. This explains the extra things that have been added in this port,
compared to the generic UNIX version, for example.

Things to note about this particular version of SAngband:

It's been compiled with WIZARD mode on, but not spoiler mode as this will
not compile properly, and I don't think it's worth investing the time to
fix it. There should be graphics for all the objects, (not necessarily
unique ones: notably, the graphics for bronze/iron/mithril etc. weapons
are all exactly the same).

@endnode

@node "Specific" "Amiga Specific Features"
@next "Extra"
                        @{b}Amiga Features@{ub}

   Amiga-specific features of this version of Angband:

@{"Graphics" link "node004" 0}
@{"Sounds" link "node005" 0}
@{"Windows" link "node006" 0}
@{"Other options" link "node007" 0}

@endnode

@node "node004" "Graphics"
@node "node005"
                           @{b}Graphics@{ub}

   Standard Angband is designed to be played on an 80 x 24 terminal using
ASCII graphics. If you want to play Angband in this mode, just turn
graphics off using AngMan and it'll use a 16 colour screen.

   With graphics on, Angband will attempt to use a 640 x 200 x 32 colour
screen. This is the minimum screen setup needed to use graphics.

   You can also use higher resolutions if you like (under 'Screen Prefs' in
AngMan), but at the moment you can't choose the number of colours. Note
Angband won't actually utilise the increased resolution - it still sticks to
that 80 x 24 screen. What you *can* do is activate some of the extra windows
(see @{"Windows" link "node006" 0}). For example, one window could contain an inventory listing,
one a character dump, etc.

   To increase the available screen space, you can:

a) Use a bigger screen :)
b) Pick a larger overscan setting in AngMan.
c) We PAL users can use the bottom ~60 lines.

   Please note that graphics cards aren't supported particularly well at the
moment. It should now work (previous versions of Angband may not have worked
at all), but it needs *major* improvement, especially the graphics remapping.

	To use graphics, turn the `RTG` option on in AngMan or add `SCREEN.rtg`
to the settings.prf file.

   Also note that it doesn`t attempt to autodetect graphics cards at the
moment, though it will do soon. I`m not totally sure how to do this...
anyone know if GetBitMapAttr(...) and testing for the IS_FOREIGN flag
will always work?

                        @{b}Other graphics options@{ub}

Angband can also be played on a public screen (under KS2.0 or better). Note
that 2.0/1 public screen support is very dodgy at the moment.

[2.0/2.1 don't have the ObtainBestPen() call, so the colours under <3.0
will probably be totally wrong. Try using 'Load Palette', or redefining the
palette (either with the 'Redefine Colours' option or some other utility)

I'll improve this in future versions.

Of course, you can use custom screens as normal]

Under 3.0, public screens should work without problems. Turn on
'Use public screen' in AngMan/Screen Prefs, and supply the name of the
desired public screen in the string gadget below. So now you can play
Angband on your Workbench.

                            @{b}Quick Gfx@{ub}

The 'Quick Gfx' option attempts to speed up graphic redraws on custom
screens. It only works on screens with 8x8 fonts and 8x8 icons. Generally,
the graphics will redraw at least twice as quickly with this turned on
(and often faster).

Don't use this option unless you feel you need to - as it writes directly
to screen memory it's rather unsafe :)

Having said that, I've never had any problems.

***************************** IMPORTANT ***********************

Oh, and don't use this if you have a graphics card (like you would, eh?).
It just won't work, and might crash your machine.

                        @{b}Other gfx options@{ub}

You can redefine the colours using the 'Redefine Colours' menu option.
This brings up a ReqTools palette requester.

Note this won't actually save the new palette unless you choose
'Save Palette' from the menu (RAMIGA + 's'). This saves the colours to
the 'user/colours.prf' file, which is automatically loaded upon startup.

There is a 'Load Palette' option (RAMIGA + 'l').

You can have graphics in store/equipment/inventory listings - see the
'Options/User Interface' menu.

There are Intuition Menus, which again can be controlled by AngMan. This
requires KS 2.0 or better.

And finally, you can also pick any monospace font for the display; see @{"Windows" link "node006" 0}

@endnode

@node "node005" "Sounds"
@node "node006"
                                @{b}Sound@{ub}

Angband is supplied with sound effects for things like attacking, eating,
dying etc.

These are stored in the 'xtra/sound' directory (as 8SVX files). You can
replace these with more interesting sounds (which must be in 8SVX format).
To stop certain sounds being played, just move them out of the directory.

@endnode

@node "node006" "Windows"

                                @{b}Windows@{ub}

   Angband can have upto seven additional windows, which can be used to
display inventory listings, messages, character dumps etc.

   Previous versions of Amiga Angband required a public screen for this
feature, but now you can use these windows on a normal custom screen.

   This section assumes you use AngMan.

   To turn on a window, run AngMan and pick 'Define Windows'. The cyclic
gadget at the top lets you choose a term window.

   From the top, we have:

'Use' - select this to activate a window. Note that the 'Main' window
*must* be activated.

'X Pos' - The left part of the window, in pixels
'Y Pos' - The top part of the window, in pixels
'Cols'  - The width of the window, in *characters*. Note that you have to
          allow for the width of the window borders when setting this.
          Normally, you can't fit 80 characters on a 640 pixel screen.
          This isn't normally a problem (see below).
'Rows'  - The height of the window, in characters.

The bottom two gadgets set the window name, and the font you'd like to use.

The lowest gadget, `Use scrolling`, allows you to have scroll bars in
the window. Normally, this should be *off*; this option is rather hacky.

If you want to use a window in Angband, make sure 'Use' is selected. Then
save and run Angband. If the window does not appear, go to the 'Windows'
menu, and select the relevant window - it should now be created.

Now you should (hopefully) have a new window on screen. You can drag this
around and resize it as you wish, but note that after you've resized a window
its dimensions may be adjusted slightly.

Once you're happy with the window setup, choose 'Save Windows' from the
'Windows' menu. When you next load Angband the windows ought to remain where
you left them.

Thanks to everyone who`s reported a bug, or given me any feedback. I do
appreciate it. Special thanks must go to the people below, who deserve a
special mention and a gold star... take a deep breath:

First, the three brave (*very* brave) beta-testers:

Joseph Dixon, for bug reporting and giving me most of the new ideas in recent
  versions. Even if some of them are rather tricky to code :)

Bablos, who found pretty much every bug going (the early versions were
  umm.. a little bugged), and has given me loads of suggestions. And he
  uploads all these ports to Aminet.

Eivind Olsen, for patiently testing the graphics card compatibility. I
  really *must* get a graphics card one day...

Andrew Tait, for reporting some very odd behaviour in Zangband, and
  pointing out that it crashed when SwazBlanker was installed. He wasn`t the
  first to point out the bug, but he gave me such a comprehensive bug report
  that it virtually fixed itself.

Robert Ruehlmann, author of the MS-DOS port, who I`ve stolen some ideas
  and graphics from :)

Lars Haugseth for allowing me to use his Amiga source code.
Magnus Holmgren and Nico François for 'reqtools.library', which this program
  uses.

                              @{b}Extra@{ub}

   New for this version of Angband is the 'AngMan' program (also in the
'bin' directory). This is a small (but hopefully useful) GUI that allows
you to experiment with different options without messing around with
text editors and a copy of the source code.

It uses the 'Triton' GUI library, available from Aminet.

I apologise for the lack of proper documentation, but I'm hoping it's
fairly intuitive.

AngMUI is currently in progress, which will be much nicer, and will
probably replace AngMan.

@node "node001" "Requirements"

                              @{b}Requirements@{ub}

AngMan, unlike the main Angband executable, requires Kickstart 2.1 or
better. It also needs the 'triton.library' somewhere in your 'LIBS:'
path. The 2.1 requirement is from AngMan, not Triton - it ought to become
2.0 compatible eventually.

It also needs a Sangband: path assigment.

@endnode

@node "node002" "Operation"

                              @{b}Operation@{ub}

AngMan still recognises only one argument, and doesn`t know about tooltypes
at all. Sigh.

You can supply a `PATH` argument:

   eg. AngMan path xh2:source/other/angband/zangband206

@endnode

@node "node008" "Known Bugs & FAQ"

                            @{b}Known Bugs & FAQ@{ub}

Here is a list of some of the problems I know about. Most of these should
hopefully get fixed.

  *  Graphics card behaviour is very nasty. In future versions I may
     support graphics cards directly with Picasso 96/insert similar. Note
     (I think) this only really applies if you use the graphics (not text)

  *  Graphics in inventory/equip/store options will not work properly with
     RTG mode on. This probably won`t get fixed until I get a graphics card
     myself.

  *  2.0/2.1 public screen support very flaky. Apparently it
     doesn`t work at all, though I can`t figure out why.

  *  Quick graphics option should optimise text too.

  *  Scroll bars are a little dodgy at the moment.

And now, the mini-faq:
                                  @{b}AngMan@{ub}

Q: AngMan refuses to load at all, or crashes.
A: Make sure that an appropriate version of triton.library is in LIBS:
   I've heard that the 3.0 version of library crashes on 2.0, rather than
   gracefully aborting; hopefully this is wrong. Some early versions of Triton
   also ask for key files and refuse to load without them - try a more modern
   version.

Q: AngMan won't load the settings.prf file!
A: First, make sure you actually have a settings.prf file in your user
   directory; AngMan won't create one for you.

   Assuming you've left AngMan in 'bin/', it will look in the 'user/'
   directory first, then look in 'Angband:user/'. So try assigning Angband:
   to the appropriate place, and run AngMan again.

   You can also supply AngMan with a path, using the path keyword:

   eg. AngMan path xh2:source/other/angband/zangband210

Q: AngMan is eating up all my CPU time :((
A: This bug should now be fixed.

                                  @{b}Angband@{ub}

Q: How do you persuade Angband to use a public screen?
A: The easiest way is to use AngMan:

    Go into 'Screen Prefs', and ensure 'Use Public screen' is checked.
    Put the public screen name into the 'Public screen' gadget below.
    (For the Workbench screen, use 'Workbench')

    If you don't like AngMan, or can't run it, you can edit the settings.prf
    file directly:

    Load settings.prf into your favourite text editor, and delete (or
    comment out) all references to SCREEN.mode
    Now insert a line 'SCREEN.name <name of public screen>'

Q: The screen looks odd...
A: Angband tries, by default, to use a NTSC screen. So if you have a NTSC
   monitor driver present it may produce some interesting results. To fix,
   either a) choose a screenmode b) resize the main window to fill the screen
   c) remove the NTSC driver.

Q: The colours look odd in graphics mode.
A: If you find that the colours look wrong, try using a 32 colour screen if
   you can. If that doesn't work, try temporarily removing the file
   colours.prf in the 'user' directory.

For more information about Angband, you can visit one of these:

ftp://export.andrew.cmu.edu/angband

   The Official Angband FTP site. Angband will be found in the 'Amiga'
directory but most Amiga stuff will be found in the Variant or Incoming
areas. Note that Incoming is not publicly viewable; you can only retrieve
files if you know the exact name. Amiga archives are generally of the
form ???amxxx.lha, where ??? indicates the variant (zng,sng etc.) and
xxx is the version. There are also a couple of LZX archives floating around,
because I can't make up my mind which format is best :)

http://www.phial.com/angband                      - Official Angband Site

   This has an extensive bug list, some information on Angband's history, etc.
It also has a small links section and pointers to the FAQ and ftp site. It's
aimed more at developers than users though, and isn't updated all that
frequently.

http://homepages.enterprise.net/bablos/angband    - Angband Variants Page

   Contains a list of all known (and some unknown) variants, as well as
descriptions, mail addresses, pointers to the source and executables etc.
If you suddenly need to know what Ying-Yang Angband is, or what version
of Zangband we're up to, visit this. It's somewhat Amiga orientated but
covers everything. It also has a huge list of Angband links, and even
some information on Nethack, ADOM, etc. Highly recommended.

http://www2.krisalis.co.uk/wwwdheb/index.html     - Roguelike News Page

   Useful and updated most weekdays, this holds most of the important
roguelike news. Also has articles on rl development, links, etc. Another
good one.

rec.games.roguelike.development                   - Development newsgroup.

Okay - here are the things that I'm planning, in order of likely arrival.

If you've got *any* ideas, even a small suggestion, please let me know.

 256 colour tile support. There are a set of 16x16, 256 colour tiles by Adam
  Bolt that look amazing but they need fairly extensive changes to the
  Angband code. From the feedback I've had most Angband/Zangband players
  use ASCII anyway - but I don't. I've not touched this for a while, since
  I've heard that the maintainer of Angband is looking into it.

 Better graphics card support. I'm hoping to get a BlizzardVision PPC card
  pretty soon which should give me some incentive to improve it :)

 'Fancy' lighting effects in graphics mode.

 More of an 'Amiga' feel - eg. tooltypes, icons, etc.

 Better documentation. I've been saying this for months though.

 AngMUI, which is currently about 45% finished.
