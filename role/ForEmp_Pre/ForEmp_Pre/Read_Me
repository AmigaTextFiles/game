Forgotten  Empires
------------------
This is my first game in Blitz Basic 2, Forgotten Empires I. 
It's still very simple and you should not have any problems playing it.

To install it copy the contents of Fonts directory to your FONTS: drawer 
and assign ForEmp: to the directory you keep the game in. It requires 
WB 2.04, and about 200K of Chip-Ram
