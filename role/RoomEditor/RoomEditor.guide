@database "Room Editor"
@NODE Main "Room Editor"
This program is fairly simple.  In fact that was the idea, to make
being able to edit rooms on CircleMUD v2.2 simpler.  In fact with
this program you don't have to worry about knowing how to add bits
to get the proper flags.  Everything should come out in perfect
format.

The program consists of 3 basic editors. An main, exit, and extra
editor.  The latter two are launched from main editor.

This program is slightly limited however in that it can not edit
the entire mud.  It allows for only one world file to be open at
a time.

@NODE new "What is new with RoomEditor"

Not much really has changed.  Mostly a bug fix with extras and the added
feature of producing the room descriptions to be word-wraped.  Though the
wrapping may cause some other formating quarks.
@ENDNODE
@NODE install "Installation of Room Editor"
Installing this editor is very simple.

If you have AmigaDOS 2.x place the .gadget files in a directory called Gadgets
in the working directory of the program.

For AmigaDOS 3.x move the .gadget files to SYS:Classes/Gadgets directory. 

You will need to have AmigaDos 2.4 or higher and MUI 2.2 (version 9) or higher.
@ENDNODE
@NODE WI_main "Main Editor"
The Main window for Room Editor.  It is where all of the current
rooms information is displayed.
                @{" Zone # " link STR_zone }
                @{" Room # " link STR_room_number }
                @{" Description Editor " link TXT_room_desc }
                @{" Room Flags " link room_flags }
                @{" Sector Type " link CY_sector_type }
                @{" Usable Exits " link exits } 
                @{" Compass " link gr_compass }
@ENDNODE
@NODE STR_zone "Zone number"
This is for the current zone number.  For the most part will stay the same for
the entire world file, but not always.  For the most part the zone number
is equal to the first digits of the world file, that is zone 30 for 
room number 3001.
@ENDNODE
@NODE STR_room_number "Room #"
This is the current room number of the room.  It can not be
changed.  Instead when a room number is typed into it the program
will switch that room to the current room to be edited.  If the
room does not exist then the editor will prompt the user if that
room should be inserted into the list of rooms.
@ENDNODE
@NODE STR_room_name "Room Name"
This is a simple string for the name of the current room that is being edited.

Remember this is a room name, not a description of a room.
@ENDNODE
@NODE TXT_room_desc "Description Editor"
This is a simple test editor with cut and paste functions, as well
as an undo function.  These functions work exactly like a normal
text editor. 
                 Right Amiga V for Paste.
                 Right Amiga C for Copy.
                 Right Amiga X for Cut.
                 Right Amiga U for Undo.
                 Del to delete current highlight.

For this I would like to thank Mark Thomas (mthomas@zilker.net) for the
textfield BOOPSI gadget that work so well with MUI.  The full archive is
available on Aminet dev/gui/textfield.lha.
@ENDNODE
@NODE room_flags "Room Flags"
These are the different room flags for the room.  They set the attributes
for how the room effects characters and mobs.
                @{" Dark " link dark }
                @{" Death " link death }
                @{" No Mob " link no_mob }
                @{" Indoors " link indoors }
                @{" Private " link private }
                @{" God Room " link god_room }
@ENDNODE
@NODE dark "Dark Flag"
This room is dark and always requires a light source for any characters
to be able to see in or into this room.
@ENDNODE
@NODE death "Death Flag"
This room will instantly kill any normal player character that steps into
it.  They will lose all of there equipment.

Use this flag as little as possible.
@ENDNODE
@NODE no_mob "No Mob Flag"
No mobiles are allowed in this room making it a very calm place.
@ENDNODE
@NODE indoors "Indoors Flag"
This room is indoors, which means that certain mud messages will not be
displayed.
@ENDNODE
@NODE private "Private Flag"
A nice way to keep a room from people telporting in on you.
@ENDNODE
@NODE god_room "God Room Flag"
With this flag set only gods (level 31+) can enter this room.
@ENDNODE
@NODE CY_sector_type "Sector Type"
These are the various sector types for a room.  It is the sector
type that determines how much movement is taken away from a character.
@ENDNODE
@NODE exits "Usable Exits"
These are the exits that are current being used.  If an exit direction
is not checked here then the exit will not exist on the mud, or
will it be allowed to be edited.
@ENDNODE
@NODE gr_compass "Navigation Compass"
This is a direction compass for walking around the mud.  It will change
the current room being edited to what ever room that exit goes to.

The single letter direction n, e, s, w, u, d also activate the buttons.

All exits are shown even if they are not in the world file.  Thus you may
receive an error message telling you that the room does not exist.
@ENDNODE
@NODE WI_edit_extras "Extras Editor"
This is the editor for editing the extras which are used in the
each room. There is a maximum number of 8 extra descriptions for a room.
                @{" Key List " link extra_key_list }
                @{" Extra Description " link extra_desc }
@ENDNODE
@NODE WI_exit_editor "Exit Editor"
This is the editor for editing the attributes of an exit.

Remember that only an exit that is checked in the Usable Exits group
will be allowed to be edited.
@ENDNODE
@NODE WI_system_message "System Message"
This window is used to produce error or other system messages for the
Room Editor program.
@ENDNODE
@NODE extra_key_list "Key list"
This is a simple string list of all of the possible descriptions that can
be used by a player to look at an extra.  Remember to use these key words
in the description of the room, other wise no one will be able to see your
work.
@ENDNODE
@NODE extra_desc "Extra Description"
This is a simple text editor for the description of what the player
sees when he looks at the extra.
@ENDNODE

I do the best that I can to check for all bugs before releasing a product,
but it is really up to you to tell me what I did wrong.

To register this program, please post me a check, or money order for
$5 US or anything else of value for my computer to...

Those who do let me know, I can let you in on the other programs I'm currently
working on.  ObjEdit, MobEdit, ZoneEdit, and Social/MessageEdit.

I must also thank Mark Thomas (mthomas@zilker.net) for the textfield.gadget, which
is available on Aminet.  Saved me a lot of work.
@ENDNODE
@NODE bugs "Quick kill it! It's a BUUGGGG!"
OK people are going to find bugs.  So tell me about them.

1) If your is if your computer runs out of memory, while either loading 
   a file or adding to an existing room there is no error message.

2) Compass buttons lock in their selected state if you move into
   a new room where there isn't an exit in the same direction that
   you just came in.  This has no effect on the program.

3) The editor may have some problems with loading in files that have
   mistakes in them.  It may either lock in a loop, or just have bad data.
   If this happens on a particular file, edit it by hand and see if you
   can find the problem.  The 'Loading Room #' counter should give you an
   approximated idea where it is.

4) Doesn't seem to open any windows on a AmigaDOS 3.x machine.  I think this because
   of the textfield.gadget and it's placement.  At first I said to put the
   files in a directory called Gadgets, but AmigaDOS 3.x uses a different directory.
   I have no way at this time to test the program under with AmigaDOS 3.x so
   I will have to depend on bug reports.
   
This program has been tested on a A600 2Chip 2Fast, and yes the MUD runs
under the same conditions.
@ENDNODE
@NODE future "Future Improvements"

There are a lot of ideas that I have for this program.

1) Faster loading of rooms.
2) Having more than one world open at a time.
   a) list view of all open files.
   b) save only current wld file or save all.
   c) open the needed world files when trying to navigate.
3) Linklist of extra objects.  Right now limited to an array of 8.
   This change will save memory as well as allow for as many extras
   a person could want.  I already have the code for it, but haven't
   done it yet.
4) Remove MUI, I don't really want to, but I may have to.  If the split
   libraries ever come about then this may be enough.  Memory usage is
   always a big item.
5) Hypertext version using forms, so it can be accessed across a network
   connection.  This I would have done  right away, but my machine doesn't 
   have AmigaDos 3 so I can't test the stuff out yet Amosaic :(.
6) Finishing the other editors and cross-linking them into one or two
   programs.


Any other ideas send them to me.
