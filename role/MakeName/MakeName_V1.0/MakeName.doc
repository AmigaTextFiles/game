				 MakeName V1.0
				 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
MakeName creates randomly names which are somewhat speakable.
The C-source is provided so you can change it to your needs or include
it into your programs (then please don't forget to credit me).

MakeName can get up to four parameters:

MakeName min max num cols width

 min	= Minimum of syllables
 max	= Maximum of syllables
 num	= Number of names to generate
 cols	= Either number of columns with names or chars per line
	  (assumed if cols > 10)

The width of the columns is calculated as "max * 4".

Examples:

 MakeName
	Gives 48 names with 2-4 syllables in 4 columns
 MakeName 3 6 100 5
	Gives 100 names with 3-6 syllables in 5 columns
 MakeName 3 5 100 120
	Gives 100 names with 3-5 syllables in 6 columns (120 / (5 * 4))

MakeName ? (or '-?' or 'h' or '-h') gives little help-line.

If you do major changes, please send the source to me.
