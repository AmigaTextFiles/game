/***************/
/* Description */
/***************/

This is the first part of a graphical adventure game. (We don't have
time enough to finish it).

The interface is very similar to the game "Monkey Island".
Everything in the game is made using the mouse: the first button is used
to select and the second one is used cancel actions or to bypass animations.

You can save just one game clicking with the left mouse button on the
left part of the save/load button. clicking on the right part reload the
game previously saved.



/*****************/
/* Installation: */
/*****************/

You can put the executable and the Data drawer everywere you like following
two restrictions:
- The Data drawer must be at the same place as the executable
- You MUST NOT modify anything in the Data drawer

Just double-click on the executable's icon to start the game.


/***********/
/* Remarks */
/***********/

- The game needs a lot of chip-RAM. So if there isn't enough RAM try to
  remove all programs, to close all windows of the workbench and eventually
  to degrade the workbench screen.

- The animations are much slower if the game's screen is opened in DoublePAL
  (with the workbench preference "Mode Promotion" selected) so don't select
  it while using the game.

- The game is much faster with a dynamic cache.
