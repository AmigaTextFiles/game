                         Lost On Parrot Island
                         =====================

Required hardware
=================

Any Amiga with 1 MByte RAM or more and a hard disk with 3 MByte free space.


Instructions
============

After loading appears a screen where you can click the flag of your choice
to choose the language for the game, i.e. English or German.
Shortly afterwards appears the title picture. You can now see the intro or
start, load and quit the game.
When starting the game the screen shows that the player has been able to
find land and leaves the water. He finds himself on a deserted island.
Your task is to find a possibility to leave the island.
The screen shows 3 different sections: The playfield (the upper part of the
screen), the indicating field (the black stripe between the upper and
lower section) and the control panel at the bottom.

The game figure can be moved by clicking on any location in the playfield
with the left mouse button. If possible, the game figure is to be moved
to this location (it's impossible to walk behind pits or rocks).
If you move the mouse to certain sections in the playfield, e.g. to the
edge or to an object, a related sign usually appears in the indicating
field, provided the object is important.
You can move to these by simply clicking on them. You are also able to
investigate them, for which you need the control panel. There you find
some text gadgets such as "Use", "Push", "Talk to", "Look at", "Open",
"Close", "Give" and "Take". These gadgets allow you to execute commands,
to take objects, to talk to persons, etc. For command execution
you have to click one gadget and thereafter an object in the playfield,
e.g. a person with "Talk to" or something to take with "Take".
If your command is workable (you cannot want to talk to a stone, for
example), you can see how the game figure acts upon your command.
Otherwise the figure tells you that it's not workable. When some text
appears on the screen, you must press the left mouse button to continue
playing or to see the next text.
Objects you have picked up appear on the right side of the control panel.
If you click on these, the game figure tells you what it sees or thinks.
You can use these objects by clicking on "Use" and after that on the
object. The game figure then waits for you to click on an object in the
playfield and thereafter you may be quite a bit closer to the solution...


Hints
=====

· Have a look at all objects, take everything along with you, just
  try everything.
· Search the playfield thoroughly with the mouse. Maybe this way you'll
  discover something which you haven't seen before.
