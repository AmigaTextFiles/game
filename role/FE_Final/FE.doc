STORYLINE

Mike had three hundred pages of Geology II textbook to dive 
into that weekend, and he was less than willing to do so.  Not 
only was this the driest textbook on Earth, but his family's 
last vacation had caused him to miss a whole weeks worth of 
notes.  His classmate Chrissy offered him her notes, but he 
didn't know which was worse:  A twenty page dissertation on 
the nature of pumice, or the random "I Love Billy"s strewn 
through the sloppy notes.  After four hours of solid studying, 
he glanced outside.  It was a beautiful spring day.  Why they 
couldn't hold final exams during the dead of winter, when no 
one wanted to be outside, instead of during the sweet, 
gorgeous spring was beyond him.  Probably some form of 
punishment, he thought.  He returned back to his textbook, 
sick of all the hearts and scribbles courtesy of Chrissy, and 
began to read about the Earth's core, and the molten magma 
within...

PLAYING FINAL EXISTENCE

Final Existence is not the typical tile-based role 
playing game.  You have the ability to move about the entire 
screen, in any direction, and around objects more realistically.
than most RPGs.  Control is done by the joystick.  Simply 
push the joystick in the direction you wish to travel.

You are also not the only person in this game.  When you 
meet up with other people, hit the fire button to talk with 
them.  You can also pick up objects by hitting the fire button.

Room exits are usually doors or passageways.  Look for them 
on the edges of the screen.  Sometimes they may not be too 
visible, so keep trying.

Unfortunately, unlike other RPGs that follow this design, you 
cannot walk behind objects yet.  One example is the 
television set in your living room.  The only solution is to walk 
around it.  But don't worry--our crack programming team is 
working day and night to solve this nasty, multi-legged bug.  
Expect to be able to walk behind trees in the next Internext 
Software RPG.

Sometimes, talking characters will pose a question within the 
dialogue box.  Simply move the pointer up and down until 
you've selected your choice, and then press fire.

Dialogue boxes are not the only way to communicate.  
Circular Menus are a common way to select items from a 
store, and they are also used in the in-game menu system.  
With Circular Menus, the currently selected option is usually 
above your head, depending upon your position on the 
screen.  The description of the current item is also on the 
bottom of the screen.  Move the joystick left and right in the 
direction you want the selected item to go, and hit fire when 
you've selected the item you wish.

IN-GAME MENU SYSTEM

The in-game menu system is a hierarchical menu that lets 
you select weapons & armor, use items, save & load games, and 
check character statistics.  The structure of the menus, with 
child items indented below parent items, is below:

EQUIPMENT
	EQUIP
		WEAPON
		ARMOR
		GLOVES
		HAT
		CANCEL
	USE
		(List of Items)
		MORE...
		CANCEL
	MAIN MENU
LOAD/SAVE
	LOAD
	SAVE
	MAIN MENU
STATS
	HP/MHP
	STR/DEX/INT
	CREDITS
	ATK/DEF
	EXP
	MAIN MENU

EQUIPMENT
The equipment menu, where you equip and use items
EQUIPMENT/EQUIP
The menu where you equip items for battle, and also tells you 
which items are currently equipped
EQUIPMENT/EQUIP/(Piece of Equipment)
The menu will show available weapons and armor, which you 
can choose from to equip
EQUIP/USE
Lists items that can be used to restore Hit Points (described 
in Battle)
EQUIPMENT/USE/(List of Items)
All of your unequiped items are listed here.  You can scroll 
through them.  Any items that restore Hit Points are marked 
by how much they restore.  Select them and press fire to use 
the item and restore HP.
LOAD/SAVE
Load or save a game in progress.  Be sure when naming 
your game you give it the extension ".game", otherwise it 
won't come up on the requested when loading.
STATS
Shows individual statistics on the player.  (Statistics  
explained in Battle).

BATTLE

So you managed to run in to a bad guy, huh?  The battle system is easy to 
pick up on, but differs from most other RPGs, because battles are real-
time.  You can't afford to be indecisive, as the 
enemy will attack even if you're not ready.  This will involve a 
lot of fire-button pressing and quick decisions when fighting.

When fighting, all other characters are frozen, and the enemy 
surrounds you.  All fighters draw their weapons and begin 
battle.  Depending on your position on the screen, the battle 
window, which contains the power gauge, will open up on the 
top or bottom of the screen.  Battle now begins.

In its simplest form, battles only involve you pushing the fire 
button when the white power gauge, in the center of the 
battle window, fills up, and the action (usually Attack) is 
highlighted.  You'll leap at the enemy, fire off a shot, and 
leap back, causing a certain amount of damage, shown by 
the damage number that bounces at their feet.  Enemies fight 
the same way, using internal power gauges and attacking 
when their gauge is full.  Damage also appears below you 
when they attack.

There is a chance that your hit or the enemies will be more 
powerful than normal.  If this happens, the screen flashes 
white when the hit occurs, and the damage is slightly higher 
than what a normal hit would've been.

If you find that certain enemies in certain battles are weaker 
or stronger than others, you may wish to eliminate them first.  
You can select an individual enemy by moving the joystick 
left and right.  An arrow on the main screen points to the 
currently selected enemy.

Enemies can hit hard, and you may need to use some of your 
healing items during battle.  Move the joystick up and down 
to select three different healing options:

LightHeal	Use item with lowest healing power
SmartHeal	Choose best item for amount of HP lost
MaxHeal	Use item with highest healing power

When you finally eliminate an enemy, they will disappear 
from the screen.  Once all enemies are eliminated, the battle 
is over, and you are awarded Credits and Experience.  
Credits and Experience are two other statistics, including 
Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Hit Points:

Strength		Increases Attack
Dexterity		Increases Defense
Intelligence	Increases both Attack and Defense 
          	slightly
Credits		Money.  To buy stuff.
Hit Points	Amount of damage you can take before you 
			die.  You can't get any more Hit Points than 
			your Max Hit Points
Experience	Get enough and you get more Strength, 
			Dexterity, Intelligence, and Hit Points

Attack and Defense are calculated from Strength, Dexterity, 
Intelligence, and your Equipment.  The higher the Attack, the 
more damage you'll cause.  The higher the Defense, the less 
damage you'll take from enemy hits.

Attack and Defense, when added together, become your Hit 
Percentage.  The higher your hit percentage, the more likely 
you'll hit an enemy.

If you get killed in battle, all of us at Internext Software hope 
you read the part on saving your game.
