TADS 2.2.1.0 for the Amiga
--------------------------

This file contains Amiga-specific information about the TADS system, version
2.2.1.0, based on the Unix release. For general information about TADS, see
the other documentation files included in this package. TADS consists of 3
parts, the compiler, the debugger and the player. Most games are distributed
as compiled games (files ending in ".gam"), for which only the player is
required. The compiler is used to build compiled games from their source
(files ending in ".t"). You should only need to use the compiler and
debugger for writing your own games. Lots of TADS games can be found on the
Internet at the ftp site ftp.gmd.de in the directories

	/if-archive/games/tads
and	/if-archive/games/adventions

The full TADS package for many different machines can be found at the same
site, in

	/if-archive/programming/tads

Kickstart 2.04 or better is required for this version of TADS.

Using the TADS player
---------------------

The player for adventure games created with TADS is called "TADS Run-time"
on the Amiga (it is also commonly refered to as "tr" or "TADSr" in document-
ation for other systems). To run a TADS game, double click on the
"TADS Run-time" icon, then select the game file (usually ending in ".gam")
with the file requester. The icon can have the following tootypes:

DIR	  This indicates which directory TADS should open the file
	  requester in, e.g.
				DIR=Cheez:TADSGames/

SWAPDIR	  This is the directory to store temporary swap files. The
	  default is T:

The player can also be used from the Shell by giving the game file path as
the first argument, e.g.

	"TADS Run-time" Cheez:TADSGames/UU1.gam

Calling the player without any arguments will give a list of all possible
arguments and their function. Note that the player requires more than the
standard stack to run successfully; the stack in the player's icon is set
to 50000, and if the player is run from the Shell then the Shell's stack
should be set to at least as much.

The player has command line editing (cursor left/right, delete and back-
space), a command line history (cursor up/down to go through the previously
entered commands) and a review mode (accessible by pressing F1) in which
text that has scrolled off the display can be recalled.

There is also a version of the player, called "tr", which only uses standard
input and output, for use in a Shell window or over a network.

Using the TADS compiler and debugger
------------------------------------

The compiler for TADS games is called "tc" (on other systems it is sometimes
refered to as "TADS Compiler" or "TADSc"), and may only be run from the
Shell. The compiler requires more than the default stack: For "Ditch Day
Drifter" (the included sample game) 30000 is enough, but for serious work I
would recommend a larger stack (say 100000). There is also a debugger
available, called "tdb". For more information on how to use these tools,
see "TADS.doc" and the full manual which is available from ftp.gmd.de in the
directory
