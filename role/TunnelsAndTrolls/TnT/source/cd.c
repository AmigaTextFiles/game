/* Unofficial errata (%%):
 Applying to Corgi and FB versions:
  CD5/1E: There appears to be no way to reach this paragraph.
  CD25/4D: Casting Blasting Power here (while fighting Delverdinger)
   leads to room 66/8H (which is part of the Ythul encounter).
   There does not seem to be any appropriate paragraph existing in the
   module.
  CD134/18D: Says "amount of you missed the roll" instead "amount by
   which you missed the roll".
 Unofficial Corgi errata:
  On the 'Glib Tongue Table' (CDp71), "go to 97*" should be "go to 105".
 Official FB errata:
  On the 'Glib Tongue Table' page 29, "go to 119" should be "go to 13F".
 But this doesn't matter anyway because there is never any situation
  where "you haven't been told otherwise".

Ambiguities:
 We are allowing spellcasting during normal combat rounds, ignoring the Magic Matrix. We probably shouldn't allow this.
