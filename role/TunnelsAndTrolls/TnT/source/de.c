"INTRODUCTION\n" \
"  Umslopagaas of the Shiny Teeth is your host in the Deathtrap Equalizer and it is he who gives out the Frog Rings for those who want to make quick in-and-out excursions, as well as the Lion Ring for anyone who dares try the Trip of the Lion. There are some rules that you, as players, must conform to in order for this game to work. First of all, all the regular rules of Tunnels & Trolls apply in the situations inside. Second, a delver must go alone. Sorry, no groups. Thirdly, you will have to use your imagination and sometimes do the dice-rolling for the monsters as well as for your own character. Some monsters use the Monster Rating system developed in T&T, and some fight as individual characters. Saving rolls are made on a variety of attributes, but the minimum saving roll will always be 5, just as it is in a regular T&T game. Now let's pick up on what Umslop (as his friends call him) is saying...\n" \
"  \"...Most of you will be taking the Frog Trip; that is, you get into one situation, solve it and come back out where I can award experience points, patch up minor wounds, and whatnot. Those who think they are heroes will use the Lion Ring, and will go in sequence through all 16 of the Equalizer situations. I wouldn't try it myself, but the rewards are tremendous if you make it. Each time your ring lights up, you go on to the next adventure. (Instead of going to {3}, you go to the next situation right through to {88}, which is the last situation.) Okay, step right up and take a ring.\"\n" \
"  Umslopagaas continues his pitch. \"Now, as you all know, this is an equal-opportunity dungeon, licensed by the chamber of commerce of downtown Khosht, and in reality it is more of a pocket universe in a close time loop than a conventional complex of tunnels and chambers. Everyone has the same basic chance of getting rich or getting dead. It depends on you. We will allow you to take any magical weapons, protective charms, armour, etc. that you might already own. There is only one catch. In situations where there is a conflict of interests or instructions, the Equalizer instructions take precedence. (If you have a magic weapon that is supposed to be unbreakable, and we say it breaks, then we broke your magic weapon.) Also, those of you who are shape shifters will find you are limited to human form while inside, and no one can be more than 7' tall.\n" \
"  \"Some words of caution. The Equalizer was designed to kill fools. Be wary of making choices, but be not afraid when you must. You would be wise to take some means of making a light, and some money in case you might want to buy anything within. Remember that courtesy may be as important as weapons skill. Now goodbye and good luck. I'll be watching, but you're on your own.\"\n" \
"  Any character going in on a Frog Trip now rolls 3 dice. If you score 3, turn to paragraph {5}; 4, turn to {11}; 5, turn to {18}; 6, turn to {23}; 7, turn to {29}; 8, turn to {34}; 9, turn to {40}; 10, turn to {46}; 11, turn to {51}; 12, turn to {57}; 13, turn to {62}; 14, turn to {67}; 15, turn to {72}; 16, turn to {78}; 17, turn to {83}; 18, turn to {88}. Read each paragraph of information carefully, following instructions as soon as you receive them. You may read a whole paragraph before going to another page unless specifically instructed not to. You may never exercise more than 1 option at a time, nor go back and change your mind after reading the consequences.\n" \
"  If you are taking the Trip of the Lion, begin with {5} and continue through to {88} in the order listed above.[ The time spent in each situation is considered 1 game turn as far as recovering strength goes. Constitution or other depleted attributes may not be recovered until you leave the Equalizer.]"

"\"Welcome back!\" cries Umslopagaas. \"I've been watching you in this magic mirror.\" If you've completed the Trip of the Lion, you are awarded a bonus of 10,000 ap, plus whatever experience you gained during your adventures.[ If you brought back any treasure, it is customary to tip your host about 10%.]\n" \
"  If you have completed a Frog Trip, you are awarded a bonus of 100 ap, plus whatever experience you have gained during your adventures.\n" \
"  If you enjoyed this adventure, and would like to re-enter the Equalizer, throw 3 dice. If it is the same as the one you just came back from, add 1 to the number and go to the next situation.[\n" \
"  If you have completed 4 or more adventures in the Equalizer with this character, perhaps it is time you tried another dungeon, or dare to venture the Trip of the Lion. Thank you for playing, and tell your friends.]"
