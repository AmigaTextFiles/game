"`INSTRUCTIONS\n" \
"  The Red Circle is a solo adventure written for Tunnels and Trolls. Any single humanoid character may enter this adventure provided he has no more than 60 personal adds. This adventure has been written with the 5th edition of the T&T rules in mind. The rules presented in this book will allow you to play the game with no problem.\n" \
"  In addition to the rules presented here you will need many six sided dice, paper and pencils to play the adventure. Create your hero and begin.\n" \
"  Enjoy!\n" \
"~INTRODUCTION\n" \
"  You've been travelling the caravan route alone despite the danger. You've heard all the stories about the raiders, The Red Circle, and you do find them interesting. Still you know the Red Circle will be a power only so long as they do not get powerful people angry.\n" \
"  You top a small hill on the road and rein your horse to a stop. Before you, at the base of the hill, you see the remains of the caravan you've been following for three days. All the horses, camels and pack mules are dead. The wares carried in the caravan are spread all over the little meadow below; the most valuable goods are gone. The bodies of the soldiers and people in the caravan are also lying there. Carrion birds are feeding on the remains.\n" \
"  It is rather obvious that the raiders took the caravan by surprise. The meadow around the battleground is pockmarked with holes, like shallow graves, where the raiders had buried themselves while waiting for the caravan. The attack was well planned, and executed ruthlessly.\n" \
"  If you want to continue down the road, past the carnage, and on your way, go to {31}. If you want to investigate the battleground for any possible survivors, go to {62}. If you want to look for the raiders' trail and backtrack them, go to {93}."
},
{ // 1
"You sneak forward silently. Around a turn in the trail ahead you see two members of Red Circle crouched in ambush. Both are young and have bows. You note, with a certain amount of surprise, that their quivers and bracers are made of Dhesiri flesh. You were not aware any of the little dragonmen were this far north in Karesia.\n" \
"  If you want to talk to the youths, make a first level Charisma saving roll (20 - CHR). If you make it, go to {125}. If you miss it, go to {156}. If you decide to attack mercilessly, go to {211}. Because you have sneaked up on them they will not have any hit point total for the first round of the fight."
},
{ // 2
"Your move takes the Red Circle warriors by surprise. If you can avoid a couple of arrows you should be able to escape the Red Circle warriors.\n" \
"  Make a first level Luck saving roll (20 - LK). If you make it, you may travel north to the next town at {13}, or you may head West toward Goblin Mountain at {171}.\n" \
"  If you miss the saving roll you are hit with one arrow for each point you missed it by. Each arrow does 3 dice of damage. If you survive, the above options are for you."
},
{ // 3
"You pivot and grab the wrist behind the dagger heading toward your back. You twist the knife around and force it back into the stomach of the blonde woman who showed you the secret stairway. She drops to the floor, lifeless.\n" \
"  The Baron stands, his face pale. \"Just you and me.\" He dismisses his guards, leaving his nephew the only other person in the room with you.\n" \
"  Because you slew his mistress right before his eyes the Baron is going to be a bit distracted in this fight. [You will get a 20% bonus to your combat rolls for this fight. ]Go to {182}."
},
{ // 4
"The cavern is huge, and back near the dragon's tail you see what might have been an opening large enough to get two or three wagons into the cavern. Still it is much too small to ever have admitted the dragon.\n" \
"  Continuing around the dragon, ignoring the shifting carpet of coins and jewels, you locate three smaller doorways. One has a pair of hands carved into the rock above it. The second has a helmet carved above it. The last has a sword carved above it.\n" \
"  If you would like to enter the Hands door, go to {128}. If you want to enter the Helmet door, go to {190}. If you want to enter the Sword door, go to {37}. If you want to ask the dragon about this place, go to {35}."
},
{ // 5
"\"It must be all very confusing. As I understand it the situation is this. You and I are in the treasure laden Tomb of Rex Sunwolf, the first king of free Karesia. I happen to know, having been trapped here for the last 1000 years or so, that no one has come to visit. The people of the Red Circle live on the surface above us, pleased with the water that I warm for them. Between them and us are Dhesiri, introduced by Baron Valdemar to drive the Red Circle people out.\"\n" \
"  You blanch at the thought of anyone bringing the burrowing lizardmen into an area just to drive others out. \"That's like setting a house on fire just because you don't like the colour of the outside!\"\n" \
"  The dragon nods. \"True, but that will be academic soon. The Dhesiri will burrow in here and we'll both be killed. I'm so large I can only fry those near my head. It was nice knowing you.\"\n" \
"  If you want to ask the dragon to point out where the Dhesiri will come through so you can set up some defences, go to {159}. If you want to search the cavern for treasure or tools that might help your defence, go to {4}. If you want to search for an exit, go to {191}."
},
{ // 6
"If this is your first time at this paragraph roll one die. Subtract the number you roll from 12. Keep the result noted on a piece of paper.\n" \
"  On every subsequent trip to this paragraph roll one die and subtract it from the total. If the total ever hits zero or goes negative go immediately to {100}. If it is still positive you may go after any treasure you have not gotten. The Hand room is {128}, the Sword room is {37} and the Helmet room is {190}. You may also ask the dragon about the odd pounding sound you hear by going to {38}."
},
{ // 7
"The Dhesiri horde breaks through the cavern wall in several spots. The small scaly lizardmen are unarmed, their teeth and claws more than enough to deal with you or the dragon. You look up from your breastwork and can see no end to them. Your heart sinks and you prepare to sell your life dearly.\n" \
"  Roll two dice. This is the number of Dhesiri who can get at you in any one round. [Since they care nothing for defence you may distribute half your hit point total, even if you lost the round, on to the horde. Divide the hits by 5 and count that number of Dhesiri as dead, the remainder being passed off on a surviving Dhesiri. ]Keep track of the number you kill.\n" \
"  The Dhesiri each get 2 dice and 2 adds. They have a CON of 5 each. There is no end to them so you must just keep fighting. If you survive 5 combat rounds, go to {131}."
},
{ // 8
"You are in a cell, of sorts, with 1 die + 1 other prisoners. They all look as if they have not been here long, but they all have a haunted look in their eyes. None of them seem very disposed to talking.\n" \
"  The cell is an alcove dug into the wall of the warren. Wooden bars prevent you from moving about freely, though it is really the presence of an 8' tall Dhesiri Warrior that slows any thoughts of escape. It is huge and looks formidable.\n" \
"  The only chance you have for escape, realistically, is if you can convince your fellow prisoners to join you in fighting the Dhesiri warrior. To try this make a second level Charisma saving roll (25 - CHR). If you make it, go to {39}. If you miss it, your fellow prisoners are apathetic. In this case make a first level Luck saving roll (20 - LK). If you miss it, go to {70}. If you make it, you may try to convince your fellow prisoners to escape again. Repeat the above process until you either make the Charisma roll or miss the Luck saving roll."
},
{ // 9
"Roll the other prisoners up as normal human characters. They will have no weapons so they will only get 1 die in combat. They will fight on your behalf, but you will have to take all the risks. Any saving rolls called for you will have to make, and you alone will suffer the consequences.\n" \
"  Having the prisoners with you automatically raises your Alarm level by 2.\n" \
"  Return to the paragraph you came from for your current options."
},
{ // 10
"One of the prisoners grabs your arm. \"We better hurry. An alarm will be sounded and we'll never get to the queen. I was there before, that's where they captured me.\" She leads off through a maze of ttmnels to the Queen's climber at {16}."
},
{ // 11
"The steaming pool is warm, but you notice turbulence in its surface. There is a current there. If you would like to slip into it, to see where the water comes from or is going to, go to {196}. If you decide to return to the Grand Gallery, go to {154}."
},
{ // 12
"You have had the luck to stumble upon the sleeping quarters of the Dhesiri Warriors. There are three of them in here at this time. You may butcher them in their sleep. Each has a CON equal to the roll of four dice. Roll your damage and apply it to them one at a time. If you finish a combat round with the Warrior you are attacking with a CON of 5 or more, he will awaken, raise an alarm, and fight you.\n" \
"  In combat the Warriors are worth 6 dice and 3 dice worth of adds. Their CONs are as above, but [in combat ]they also get 3 hits worth of armour from their leathery skin. Other sleeping Warriors will join the fight one round after the alarm is raised.\n" \
"  [If the battle lasts more than 5 combat rounds, go to {131}. If an alarm is raised jack your Alarm level by 2.\n" \
"  ]If you kill the Warriors you get [50 points per sleeping Warrior and ]100 per [awake ]Warrior you slay. From here you may only return to the Grand Gallery at {154}. You may not choose this northwest corridor again."
},
{ // 13
"The nearest village is the provincial capital, Valdemarton. It is the seat of Baron Valdemar's power; his castle overlooks the village from a hill to the north. The town itself is a small collection of buildings clustered around the road. The only two buildings that interest you are the Dusty Rose Tavern and the inn. All the other buildings look like houses or businesses used primarily by townspeople.\n" \
"  If you want to go to the tavern, go to {75}. If you want to check into the inn, go to {137}."
},
{ // 14
"You awaken the prospector. His rheumy eyes clear and he strains to focus on your face. You motion him to silence and press a gold coin into his palm. In a whisper you say, \"I understand there are Dhesiri about. You would know, in the mountains.\"\n" \
"  Make a first level Luck saving roll (20 - LK). If you make it by more than 5, go to {45}. If you make it by 5 or less, go to {77}. If you miss it, go to {107}."
},
{ // 15
"The Baron's throne hall is large and very dark. Sunlight streams through the windows on both sides of the hall. The stained glass depicts the exploits of past heroes, though the Baron himself is featured in the newest pane. The red carpet leading from the doorway to the high throne is worn but suitable for the room.\n" \
"  There at two people at the far end of the room. One is a powerfully built man with a shaved head. He is dressed in dark blue clothing and wears a dagger. A broadsword and scabbard hangs from the left armrest on the throne.\n" \
"  Beside him is a stunningly beautiful blonde woman. She is dressed in a blue velvet robe. A silver collar and chain link her to the throne. The chain is very light, and probably could be broken with ease.\n" \
"  \"I have need of someone who could solve a problem for me. I need to know what you know of Dhesiri.\"\n" \
"  Add your Luck and IQ and divide that total by 2. To that total add your current level. Make a first level saving roll on that total (20 - Total). If you make it by 5 or more, go to {50}. If you make it by less than 5, go to {81}. If you miss it and know something about Dhesiri, go to {142}. If you miss it and know nothing of Dhesiri, go to {204}."
},
{ // 16
"You wander down a short corridor and turn the corner into the Queen's chamber. At once you are filled with conflicting emotions: wonder and fear. The scene you are watching is incredible, the stuff folktales are made of.\n" \
"  The Queen is huge, fully 12' long and fat like a walrus. Workers crowd around her, some spooning food into her mouth while others carry away the eggs she produces. Her only purpose in life is to produce the eggs that insure the life of the colony. It is amazing and revolting.\n" \
"  Scattered all around the room are the bones and remnants of previous meals. The stench of decaying meat is very strong. The production of life amid the charnel house atmosphere seems very inappropriate.\n" \
"  One Dhesiri Warrior stands guard over the Queen. The eggs are taken back into a chamber off toward the southeast.\n" \
"  If you want to shoot or throw a missile weapon at the Queen, you are trying to hit a large target at pointblank range. If you hit, go to {112}. If you want to engage the Warrior in combat, go to {143}. If you want to dash past the Warrior to the Egg Chamber, go to {174}. If you want to back out and go to the Grand Gallery, you may do so by going to {154}. Write down the number of this paragraph, though, because once you are here you should be able to reach it from the Grand Gallery at will."
},
{ // 17
"You pry open the long-sealed doorway into the Baron's castle. The stone around it is weathered and covered with faint carvings. Were you not so intent upon killing the Baron you might balk at entering such a doorway. Still, you are not daunted.\n" \
"  The corridor beyond the doorway is dark, but luminous moss and lichen provide enough light for you to navigate by. You head in toward the castle and marvel as you pass up through several different levels of basements. You hear things scurrying around in the shadows, but you decide not to investigate.\n" \
"  At this point you realize there are two ways to go about your task. One is to pursue a course of stealth, trying to pass unnoticed. The other is to power your way through the castle, killing others before they can raise an alarm. Both are effective ways of travelling.\n" \
"  At any paragraph you should have a choice between stealth and power, as well as options that offer themselves. If you want to choose the stealth option you will have to make a first level Dexterity saving roll (20 - DEX). If you make it, you may choose that option. If you want to choose the power option, you must make a first level Strength saving roll (20 - ST). If you make that roll, you may take the power option.\n" \
"  If you miss the saving roll, either one, you must take the Failure option listed at the paragraph. If there is no Failure option, any option other than Stealth or Power may be used at that paragraph.\n" \
"  You reach the first torchlit corridor and hear someone walking down it toward your position.\n" \
"  Stealth: {56} Power: {87} If you want to slip into the shadows and watch make a first level saving roll on Luck (20 - LK). If you make it, go to {118}. If you miss it, go to {212}. Failure: {26}."
},
{ // 18
"As a prisoner you are conducted before the headman of all the Red Circle. He is an old man, thin yet not frail. He wears the red headband you recognize on all Red Circle warriors. He points a crooked finger at you and your captors remove your bonds.\n" \
"  \"We do not keep prisoners. We offer them a chance to join us, work for us, or to depart if we believe we can trust them.\"\n" \
"  You rub your wrists where the leather thongs had rubbed the flesh a bit raw. If you want to join the Red Circle, go to {85}. If you are willing to work for the Red Circle, roll one die. If it comes up odd, go to {116}. If it comes up even, go to {147}. If you want to convince them you are to be trusted and released, go to {178}."
},
{ // 19
"You leap from the saddle, hit the ground and roll to your feet. Your horse screams and struggles as it is dragged down. You see the scaly claws of Dhesiri tearing at it. The Dhesiri had dug out a pit beneath the road and waited for prey to come along. You barely escaped being captured by them.\n" \
"  You scout around the area, knowing the Dhesiri do not like to range very far when hunting. With ease you locate the opening to their underground lair. Screwing your courage to the sticking point you enter and soon find yourself at {154}, the Grand Gallery."
},
{ // 20
"You were not lucky enough to be suspicious about the Baron. Just for your edification he has a vested interest in keeping the Dhesiri problem as undiscovered as possible. Now, far from his castle, three of his men murder you. They ride up like fellow travellers, and are quite pleasant. Unfortunately your luck fails you and they kill you with little or no resistance.\n" \
"  For you this adventure is done. Better luck next time."
},
{ // 21
"Make a first level IQ saving roll (20 - IQ). If you make it by 5 or more, go to {206}. If you make it by less than 5, go to {83}. If you miss it, go to {145}."
},
{ // 22
"You wedge yourself in between two smaller stalactites and kick the big one free. It drops slowly, tumbling so the widest end hits the water first. The splash is deafening and you get covered with water.\n" \
"  The stalactite has its expected effect. It displaces enough water to flood back into the other chambers of the Dhesiri warren. Furthermore it ripped a narrow hole in the cavern's roof, allowing you an exit. You climb up and out, taking great delight in the sunlight and lack of Dhesiri.\n" \
"  You have succeeded in destroying the Dhesiri threat to Karesia. This adventure has been worth 2500 experience points for you. Congratulations."
},
{ // 23
"You find yourself in a huge cavern, scattered with gold and human bones. It is very dark and you squint to see anything. Then, suddenly, the room is lit with a ball of dragonfire! All too late you see the dragon and its claw arcing toward you.\n" \
"  Make a first level IQ saving roll (25 - IQ). If you miss it, take 4 dice damage from the blow. If you are killed, go to {153}.\n" \
"  If you survive the attack or make the saving roll you feel the searing pain of the dragon's three claws slicing parallel scars in your left cheek. You black out.\n" \
"  You awaken in the Soulcave. You know you are now immune to damage from fire. This does not apply to your armour and equipment. This does not mean you can bathe in lava (it would smother you) but the heat and fire of anything will not harm you. Go to {30}."
},
{ // 24
"\"Good, I am glad you are brave enough to undertake this mission.\" The headman presses a small jade amulet into your hand. \"This is a Dhesiri amulet. Our sorcerer Andar created it. With this you will appear to all other Dhesiri to be Dhesiri. It will make your journey easier in the Warren.\" He also tells you that he is sending 5,000 gold pieces to the nearest village for you to recover after you are done and the Dhesiri Queen is dead.\n" \
"  You are given whatever weapons you want and taken to the entrance to the Warren. It is unguarded and you slip unnoticed to the Grand Gallery at {154}."
},
{ // 25
"You rein your horse around and spur it forward. The only person standing between you and freedom is a warrior with a crossbow. He raises it and shoots.\n" \
"  Make a second level saving roll on Luck or Dexterity, your choice. (25 - attribute.) If you miss it, take 5 dice off your CON. If you survive the attack, or make the roll, you escape after riding the man down and killing him. You leave the adventure with a bonus of 1500 experience points.\n" \
"  Congratulations, you have won."
},
{ // 26
"You whirl around the corner, anticipating the guard's continued stroll toward you. As it is, the guard had a nasty feeling about the doorway to the lower dungeons and stopped a step ahead of it. With a push he sends you back into the wall where you smack your head and lose consciousness.\n" \
"  You awaken in one of the Baron's cells.[ Place this character card inside the front cover of this book. If you ever have a character make it to the dungeons of this castle and release the prisoners this character will be free to exact his revenge.]"
},
{ // 27
"You silently slip inside the doorway. The Baron is sitting proudly on his throne. He sees you, but the four guards near the door do not. You slip up beside one of the guards and press a dagger to his throat. \"Just you and me, Baron.\"\n" \
"  The Baron smiles and draws his broadsword. To the guards he says, \"You are dismissed.\" Only one remains, his nephew. For this combat, go to {182}."
},
{ // 28
"Your weapon is knocked from your hand, only your shield protects you. You run up some stairs and burst onto the castle roof with the Baron in hot pursuit.\n" \
"  Make a first level Luck saving roll (20 - LK). If you make it, go to {184}. If you miss it, the Baron catches you and throws you off the roof. Oddly, you note, the fall is not fatal. Hitting the ground is."
},
{ // 29
"You round a corner in the corridor and discover you are in the dungeons. There are 1d + 1 prisoners in the cells. To free them you have to open the cells. You may pick the lock with a first level Dexterity saving roll (20 - DEX)[ or if you can do 15 points of damage to the lock you will open it].\n" \
"  For each turn you spend opening the doors roll one die. If it comes up a 1 you will have to fight a 4 dice, 6 adds guard with a CON of 12. Freed prisoners will join you, and you may pull prisoners from the front of this book (if there are any there), but no more than the number rolled above will join you. The others will flee. If you need more prisoners, just roll them up as you would new characters."
"  From here the only place you can go is up the stairs at {57}."
},
{ // 30
"You walk from the Soulcave and present yourself to the Headman of the Red Circle. He smiles and presents you a red strip of cloth to be your headband.\n" \
"  If you have a symbol on your chest, go to {148}. If you have scars on your face, go to {179}. If you have no special marks on your body, go to {65}."
},
{ // 31
"The carrion birds fly off and scream at you. They settle back down once you pass through their feast. You urge your horse forward and into the dark safety of the forest on the other side of the meadow. In no time you have left the caravan behind.\n" \
"  Make a first level saving roll on Luck (20 - LK). If you make it, go to {124}. If you miss it, go to {155}."
},
{ // 32
"Your approach was not as noiseless as you might have hoped. Roll two six sided dice, doubles add and reroll, as if you were making a saving roll. If your total is 10 or above, the first archer hidden in the brush has hit you. Roll for the second archer as well.\n" \
"  Each arrow that hits you will do 2 dice plus 5 in damage. Armour may be applied against the damage, but may not be doubled because you have been attacked from ambush. If you survive the arrows, you may run off, go to {64}, or you may fight the hidden warriors at {211}."
},
{ // 33
"Attacking when you are outnumbered and covered is not the brightest of moves, but it does show heart. The archers take careful aim and shoot. Their arrows, blunt varminting arrows, strike you in the head. You black out.\n" \
"  When you regain consciousness you find yourself stripped of your weaponry and tied to your saddle. You are being led into the Red Circle encampment. Go to {18}."
},
{ // 34
"Excerpt from Encyclopaedia Imperiana:\n" \
"  \"Dhesiri, also known as goblins in some locales, are generally small lizardman creatures who live underground in colonies. Dhesiri break down into one of three types. At the head of each colony is a Queen. She is a large snakelike monster whose sole purpose is to produce eggs and the various hormones that determine the product of those eggs. A queen can produce over one thousand eggs from one mating.\n" \
"  Most common are the workers. They stand 4' tall, are sexless and tailless. They mindlessly follow the orders of the Queen or a Warrior. They do all work, from gathering food to digging and tending the eggs. While they are extremely easy to kill they always attack in groups, overwhelming their prey.\n" \
"  Lastly there are the Warriors. They are twice the size of the workers and very male. They mate with the queen and are used to destroy major threats to the colony. It is rare to have more than a half dozen Warriors in a colony at any one time since their appetites are voracious and they are not above cannibalism.\n" \
"  Dhesiri prefer temperate or warm climates.\""

"\"A thousand years ago this was the tomb of Rex Sunwolf, first king of free Karesia. He united Karesia and freed it from the Empire. He was a great king and upon his death he was interred here, beneath Goblin Mountain.\n" \
"  \"His court wizard laid a curse on the tomb itself. The curse was in the form of a spell that would make any robber grow to 100 times his normal size, and would last for 1,000 years. The wizard expected most robbers to die in that time, but he did not anticipate a dragon being one of the first in here.\"\n" \
"  You leap back off the gold coins. The dragon laughs.\n"
"  \"Don't worry, expanding my bulk burned out the spell. Pack rats have stolen gold and jewels without any problem in the last four hundred years. In fact, if you wanted to, you could probably get Rex's last three treasures. Better you than the Dhesiri.\"\n" \
"  If you want to ask the dragon about Dhesiri, go to {129}. If you want to explore the cavern, go to {4}."

"Power floods through your body as your hands slip into the gauntlets. You ball your fists and the stone explodes.[ The gauntlets have formed themselves to your hands, they feel like a second skin.\n" \
"  Since you are very intelligent you grasp and can control the gauntlets and their full power. In addition to digging through 100 cubic feet of stone a turn at the cost of one Strength, the gauntlets will let you double your strength in combat for five turns in any one day.]\n" \
"  Sunwolf's shade smiles and fades; go to {6}."

"The Sword room has rainbow coloured walls. Hanging in the air, about 2' the ground, is the tip of the 6' long crystalline blade Rex Sunwolf was known to wield. It slowly spins, light glinting from it.\n" \
"  Beyond the sword stands a ghost. It is a tall, handsome man. It speaks to you. \"I am the ghost of Rex Sunwolf. I have long waited for someone to come take my sword. Though Sunshard was created for a hero, any who are worthy can wield it. Those who are not worthy will die by it.\"\n" \
"  If you decide not to try for the sword, go to {122}. If you decide to take it, make a Charisma saving roll on your own level. If you make it by 5 or more, go to {130}. If you make it by less than 5, go to {161}. If you miss it by rolling less than 5, go to {192}. All others, go to {69}."

"\"That sound you hear is the sound of Dhesiri tunnelling their way here. We'll be dead soon,\" is the dragon's reply.\n" \
"  If you want to go after one of the treasures you have not yet obtained, you may. The Hand room is {128}, the Helmet room is {190} and the Sword room is {37}. If you would like to prepare some defences against the Dhesiri attack, go to {122}. Keep track of the number of visits you have made to this paragraph - that number will be important at paragraph {122}."
},
{ // 39
"You grab a wooden bar and rip it free. You can use it as a quarterstaff. [Roll up the characteristics for the other prisoners and arm up to three of them with quarterstaves as well. With this crew ]you must battle the Dhesiri Warrior.\n" \
"  The Dhesiri Warrior gets 6 dice in combat and 3 dice worth of personal adds. His CON is equal to the roll of 4 dice, and his leathery skin takes 3 hits in combat.\n" \
"  If you kill it, everyone gets 100 experience points for it. Make a first level Luck saving roll (20 - LK). If you make it, go to {101}. If you miss it, go to {132}."
},
{ // 40
"This tunnel is fairly large and seems well travelled. The dusty floor is hard-packed, the earthen walls are trimmed of roots and stones. It runs on about a hundred yards into the darkness, then ends abruptly in a tangled ruin of debris.\n" \
"  Make a second level saving roll on IQ (25 - IQ). If you make it, read {71}. If you miss it, you have the choice of continuing on to {102} or you may retrace your steps to the Grand Gallery at {154}."
},
{ // 41
"You scramble to the surface with Dhesiri clawing at your heels. You kill a few that dare poke their heads above ground but you know you've only bought a little time. The Dhesiri horde will be after you yet.\n" \
"  Then you notice one of the prisoners. She rises to her full height and changes. Her voice becomes spectral and hollow. \"Free again, and granted the sunlight!\" Light sweeps over her and she is transformed into a beautiful Sun-nymph. A cold, grim expression captures her features.\n" \
"  She gestures at the hole in the ground. Light flies from her fingers and a Dhesiri leaving the hole is fried on the spot. Then, like water, the light pours down into the hole. You hear muffled screams, see light pouring from countless warren exits all over the landscape.\n" \
"  \"That will fix those disgusting creatures!\" She smiles, sweet and ice cold, at you. \"Thank you for your help.\" With that she turns into pure light and flies off to the sun.\n" \
"  The adventure is through for you. You get 10 points for each Dhesiri you killed, and a bonus of 1500 experience points for the adventure. You have succeeded in stopping the Dhesiri, which will stop the Red Circle from raiding. Try and tell anyone about it, though, and they'll assume the Sun-nymph you saw was a figment of your imagination.\n" \
"  [Oh, you can keep any other prisoners you created and escaped with you.\n" \
"  ]Thanks for playing."

He waits for your reaction.\n" \

"  You are released by the current, but being prudent you don't immediately strike for the surface of this new pool. Instead you look up and see white, translucent sacks floating on the water. Through them you can see the outline of Dhesiri young. You have been dragged into the warren's Egg chamber!\n" \

"The news of the caravan being slaughtered surprises the townspeople and the newly awakened prospector. The news has no effect on the guards, and it strikes you as unusual. They notice your attention, whisper to themselves and cross the room to you. Both are weaving slightly and they are obviously drunk. You know there's going to be trouble.\n" \
"  \"How much did you loot from the caravan, drifter?\" One of them, a small man, pushes you. His taller compatriot drops a hand to the dagger at his belt. \"We don't like thieving scum like you in this town,\" he continues.\n" \

"  You are turned over to a robed Chamberlain who says nothing to you. He takes you to a room, rather small but very clean, with a tub of hot water and a clean robe. He indicates you should bathe and prepare yourself for an audience with the Baron. Once you are presentable, go to {15}."

"Listening to idle gossip in an agricultural village is about as exciting as watching grass grow. You learn there is a worm blight on a farm north of the city and you gain the impression that the Baron is not well liked. If you had gone to {108} before, you may still question the sergeant about the information you learned there by going to {46}. You may also go to {109} and ask about signing up with the guard. Lastly you could go to {75} to see if the Dusty Rose Tavern is as boring as the inn."

"The crowd in the inn stands stunned. From behind you comes applause. You turn and see a handsome man clapping. He is dressed in the colours of the Baron. \"You have dealt with him quite well.

"You realize, a bit late, that the Baron is not the sort of man to be trusted. Luckily you recognize this fact just as three riders come out of the shadows at you. They ride up slowly, like fellow travellers, but you hear one of them say, \"There, that's the adventurer.\"\n" \
"  You spur your horse forward and knock one of them down. The other two get a total of 6 dice plus 2 for their weapons and 3 combat adds each. Each has a CON of 10.\n" \

"The solution to the problem is obvious to you. The lake is fed by a warm spring, but has not flooded out the cavern. That means there in an outflow. If you could enlarge the outflow, the lake would drain and the Dhesiri eggs would be swept out to sea where the cold water would destroy the eggs.\n" \
"  You shuck your clothing and dive into the lake. You can feel the current. You follow it and discover the outlet, and note there are some rocks blocking it, limiting it.\n" \

"  If you miss it, take 3 dice damage. If you die, go to {153}.\n" \
"  If you survive the combat or make the saving roll, you have learned something about being a bear. Part of you finds this metaphysical experience funny, but another part remembers how a bear slows down his body during hibernation. This is a gift you retain. [You may survive on no food or water for four months provided you remain quiet and do nothing during that time. Four months should be enough time to have friends rescue you from even the worst dungeon cave in. ]Go to {30}."

"In your dream you see yourself running with a pack of wolves across a moonlit snowfield. The pack leader howls and you feel a thrill go through your blood. He's located a moose trapped in deep snow and you are going to help taking it. It is at this point you recognize you are in wolf form.\n" \
"  The fight is long and gruelling. Quickness is your only defence against the massive rack of antlers. Two other wolves are hit and broken in the fray. Make a first level Dexterity saving roll (20 - DEX). If you miss it, take 3 dice damage. If you die, go to {153}.\n" \
"  If you survive the combat or make the saving roll, [you learn how to avoid taking dama]g[e in a fight.
