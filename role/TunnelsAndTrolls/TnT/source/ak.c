/* Ambiguities (%%)/unimplemented:
 ak_missile_far() and ak_missile_near() should probably check the weapon's
  range, a la ak_missile_extreme().
 When fighting several of something, and some but not all are at <= 5
  CON, those ones are presumably considered disabled, and thus should not
  participate in the combat.
 Should the required saving roll "to hit" level for missile attacks
  really be multiplied by the number of foes? We assume so, but it seems
  strange/unfair.
 Against eg. the balrog, if they are using one magic weapon and one non-
  magic weapon, only the magic weapon should generate any hits. Also, it's
  possible, after the magic weapon check is done, to change back to non-
  magical weapon and use those.
 Trolls, ogres and goblins are given in eg. MS as being large-size (ie.
  man-sized), but AK treats them as huge (trolls and ogres) and small
  (goblins).
 Not all Corgi paragraphs have FB equivalents, and vice versa.
Notes:
 Although there is a Magic Matrix (AK113), paragraphs where it applies are
  not marked (eg. by '*'). Instead, the text refers you to AK113.

"`INSTRUCTIONS\n" \
"  This solitaire dungeon simulates the adventures possible to characters who wish to compete in the Arena of Khazan, also known as the City of Death. Its dire reputation comes from its ruler, Lerotra'hh, the Death Goddess of Khazan, who has ruled for centuries since slaying the city's founder, the mighty wizard Khazan. Her Trollish hordes and her minion Khara Khang have held the city in an iron grip, although the reign of terror has mellowed over the years. Now most of the bloodletting takes place on the dark sands of the grand Arena.\n" \
"  The Arena is open to all - Wizard, Rogue or Warrior, Human, Elf, Monster or Beast. It is possible to win great prizes for victory, but it is more likely the fighter will die before his/her contract is fulfilled. Be warned: this is an adventure for those who love to fight, not a puzzlebox as are some other solitaires!\n\n" \
"HOW TO READ A PARAGRAPH\n" \
"  Some of the paragraphs here are long and complex. Keep the following suggestions in mind, and you should have no problems.\n" \
"  [1. While playing this solitaire, keep a piece of scratch paper handy to jot down paragraph numbers as you read them. Then, if you are told to return to the paragraph you just came from, you'll get there.\n" \
"  ]2. I have gone to considerable effort to phrase these paragraph with the choices arranged so that when you reach a choice that applies to your character, you may quit reading immediately and go to the next reference.\n" \
"  3. Some of the introductory paragraphs require you to perform some action before the fight can start. Generally, you will have to create a card for your opponent, according to the formula given - when you are told to create a Dwarf, stop everything and create a Dwarf."
"  4. Some paragraphs are divided into subparagraphs in this manner: 7A, 7B, 7C, 7D. All these are subparagraphs of paragraph 7. Usually these subdivisions segment your options in time, ie. what you have the option of doing first, then next, etc. Occasionally you will be sent back to the second or fourth part of a paragraph, like 'go to the fourth part of 7.' This means go *directly* to 7D. You no longer have the option of using any listed choices before 7D now (no 7A or 7B or 7C). Once you have done this a few times, you should have no trouble at all.\n\n~" \
"PARAMETERS FOR ARENA COMBAT\n" \
"  These are listed to give you a good idea *in advance* what kind of things you can and can't do here.\n" \
"  1. You may bring any type or level of character. Once you get the character in, you may find its powers and abilities severely limited. Remember this: if the text doesn't say you can, then you can't (ie. Shadowjacks couldn't just slip into a shadow and disappear). Khara Khang is a higher level wizard than anything you've got, or anything you can protect against, and he actively prevents you from doing things that actually aren't spelled out in the text. It's part of his job to see that the audience gets a good show - even at the price of your blood.\n" \
"  2. You may use enchanted weapons or armour in the Arena, as long as the magic fits into the scheme of regular T&T combat. If you have a ring that makes you invisible to monsters, don't expect it to work, because Khara Khang will simply negate it. The people in the stands come to see a fight, not empty air.\n" \
"  3. It is possible to be defeated in the Arena but not lose your life. If your CON (Constitution) or MR (Monster Rating) is reduced to 5 or less during combat, you will be considered 'disabled'. Usually this means you will have lost the fight, but (under some circumstances), you'll live through it.\n" \
"  4. Like all the solitaire adventures, the Arena of Khazan depends on the honour system to insure fair play. Read the paragraphs only as you reach them, and follow the instructions to the letter as you play out the game. You may expect many of your characters to die, but don't let it discourage you. If you play the game honestly, it has enough variations that it should be able to surprise you for some time to come.\n\n" \
"A QUICK NOTE ABOUT COMBAT\n" \
"  Sometimes the fall of dice will determine that you fight a type of opponent you have already fought once before. You will almost always be instructed to fight one more opponent than you did last time. Usually this is no problem if you assume your foes behave identically. You often have to make certain saving rolls, however, before or during the basic chop and hacks. It is reasonable to assume that extra foes increase the likelihood of danger.\n" \
"  *Therefore: always multiply the level number of saving rolls you are called upon to make times the number of foes you are facing.* For example: if you are fighting 2 Dwarves, and text calls for a L2-SR, you will have to make a *L4-SR in the same situation*. (Yes, I know a L4-SR is more difficult than two L2-SRs, but that is as it should be.)\n" \
"  In similar situations, the problem of using missile weapons may come up. Let us say you can put a crossbow bolt through one of those Dwarves, and you kill him on the spot. But don't think you can do it twice in the time you have. That second Dwarf isn't going to slow his charge to let you shoot at him also. If you manage to shoot and kill one of them, fine - but if you miss, or merely wound the first one, you will then be in close combat with *two* angry Dwarves.\n\n" \
"WHEN YOU ARE READY TO BEGIN, START HERE\n" \
"  It is important to establish why you are fighting in the Arena - not everyone is here voluntarily. Make you L1-SR on Luck (20 - LK). And remember, no matter how high your luck is, you must always make the minimum 5. If you make the roll, go to {71}. If you miss it, go to {77}."

Thumbs up from the crowd and you will be spared; thumbs down and you will die on the spot. Figure out how many combat turns you battle lasted, then roll 1 die: if the number you have thrown is smaller than the number of combat turns you fought, you will be spared. (Thus, mercy is automatic is you lasted at least 7 combat turns - and death is automatic if you lasted only 1.) You will get no reward for this fight, and any money you bet on yourself will be lost.

"`DETERMINING THE ODDS AGAINST YOUR CHARACTER FOR A FIGHT\n" \
"  Before each combat you must determine the odds against (or for) your victory. This represents the official odds on your match which are being offered the bettors in the seats. It is also used to determine how great a prize you should get if you win the fight.\n" \
"  Odds are expressed as a ratio of two numbers, A to Y, where A stands for the Arena and Y for You. This can be written as a ratio (A:Y) or as a fraction (A/Y). If A is larger than Y, the odds are against you; if Y is the larger number, the odds are in your favour.\n" \
"  In the lists, below, you may not need every step for every fight. Just use the pertinent ones for your circumstances. Keep the figures for A and Y separate, but written down as you go through the lists here.\n\n" \
"TO DETERMINE 'A'\n" \
"  1. Use a poly-die or a deck of cards and randomize between 1 and 10. This is the basic number. (Example: you've rolled a 5. Stick with me, and it'll be all clear...)\n" \
"  2. Add to A the number of *extra opponents* you must fight. (Ex: You are fighting 3 dwarves. That is 2 more than usual, so add 2 to A.)\n" \
"  3. If you're fighting Trolls, Giants, or any Animal (not Monster) with a rating above 100, then multiply A times 2.\n" \
"  4. If you're facing any of the Wizards, add 1 to A for each level the sorcerer has attained. (Ex: fighting the fourth level wizard, you must add 4 to A.)\n" \
"  5. If you are facing any of the Monster class, multiply A times 3.\n" \
"  6. If you own character is a Hobbit, Gremlin, Leprechaun, [or any animal or monster with a Monster Rating of 50 or less, ]multiply A times 2.\n\n" \
"TO DETERMINE 'Y'\n" \
"  1. Your basic value for Y *will always start at 1*.\n" \
"  2. Multiply Y times the number of fights you have *already won*. If you have not won a fight (or even fought a fight yet), skip this step and *do not* multiply times 0. (Ex: If you have fought 5 times, and won 4 times, multiply Y times 4 = 4).\n" \
"  3. If you are facing Gremlins, Hobbits, or any Animal (not Monster) with a MR of 50 or less, multiply Y times 2.\n" \
"  4. If you are a wizard or warrior-wizard, add your *level number* to Y. (Ex: a third-level wizard must add 3 to Y.)\n" \
"  5. If you are a Troll, Giant, [or Beast with a MR more than 100, ]multiply Y times 2.\n" \
"  6. If you are a Balrog, Demon, Naga, Lamia, Centaur, or any other non-human character from the monster-creation tables, multiply Y times 3. (If you are not certain whether you fall into this class, then you probably do. So multiply times 3.)\n\n" \
"Now you have numbers for both A and Y. Put these two numbers together as 'A:Y' and reduce the fraction to its lowest common denominator. Let's say you eventually got odds of 5:2. In terms of betting and money, this means that for every 2 pieces gold you bet on yourself, the Arena will pay you 5 gold *if you win*. (If you don't win, but still live, you'll pay 2 gold pieces to the people who put down the 5.)\n" \
"  NOTE: The odds do not always reduce to something simple like '2:1' - they will often be improper fractions like 5:2, 9:4, 13:15. In terms of winning prizes, cut Y to 1 (regardless of what this does to A) and you should get some idea of what your odds are, relative to the prize-odds. In the examples just given, 5:2 is a 2:1 against you, 9:4 is 2:1 against you, and 13:15 is a little bit more than 1:1 for you.\n" \
"  ~*You can bet on yourself in the arena, but importantly: You are never allowed to bet more than 1000 gold pieces!* This is the easiest way to make extra cash in the arena - if you lose, you will probably be dead. If you do wager on yourself, you must write down how much you want to wager, and at what odds. If you lose the fight and survive, your money is gone. If you win, you keep your money as well as the odds payoff. Do not give yourself experience points for prize money or money won in betting.\n" \
