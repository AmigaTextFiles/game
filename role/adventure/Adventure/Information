Adventure was written in FORTRAN by Donald Woods and Will Crowther.  It was
the first game of its type, and became so influential that similar games have
been known as "adventure games" ever since.  Historically, Adventure provided
much of the underpinnings of modern computer gaming, and directly inspired
other classic games such as Dungeon (AKA Zork) and VCS Adventure.

Many versions of the program have been hacked, ported, modified, and
otherwise distributed amongst users worldwide.  Some versions are incomplete,
some are bug-riddled, and some have additions not sanctioned by the original
authors.

To present Adventure in its original form, Marvin W Rasmussin took the BDS-C
users group version and revised it to conform with FORTRAN source code from
versions running on two other computers.  The program was then converted to
Megamax C for the Atari ST computer.  His version, distributed by the Austin
Atari Computer Enthusiasts, is believed to be one of the most historically
authentic.

Converting the program to SAS/C on the Amiga required only minor changes to
conform with picky ANSI C conventions.  I have also taken the liberty of
correcting a few trivial spelling and grammatical errors.  Otherwise, this
version should function identically to the Austin ACE version.

I think today's players will find that Adventure, though it doesn't exactly
stretch the limits of the Amiga, is still well worth playing.

This distribution should contain the following:

  advent0.dat     Required adventure data file
  advent1.dat     ditto
  advent3.dat     ditto
  advent4.dat     ditto
  advent5.dat     ditto
  advent6.dat     ditto
  adventr.dat     ditto
