By registering this game you are compensating me for the time and
effort put into creating the game. You will also encourage further
work on the Amiga platform. All users who submit the shareware fee
will receive the registered hard drive version of Inner Demons, 
full support, and a copy of the solution to the game. 

I will also include the complete registered version of Dark Obsession,
a text based adventure in which you play a disturbed individual 
trying to cope with a cheating wife. It is similar in style
to Inner Demons and is recommended for mature players due to violence.
It includes a menu style parser system and background music. It will 
work on all Amigas with 1 MB Ram.

Registration materials include 3 compressed disks (requires 
LHA to decompress), full support, and printed instructions 
and solutions.

Please allow 5-7 days for shipment to arrive.
