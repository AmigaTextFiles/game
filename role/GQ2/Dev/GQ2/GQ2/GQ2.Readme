This is the completed (finally) version of my Graphic Adventure 
Geo's Quest "In Search of Queen Lorraine". I started this in 2000
only to stop in 2002 as life happened; never to return to it until
last year in my retirement. The original version from 2002 that
has been floating about these 20 years is incomplete, full of errors
and bugs. This is the finished, refined, corrected & completely 
reworked version.

Just create a folder/drawer named GQ2 anywhere on your Amiga or 
emulated Amiga and extract the archive into the folder/drawer you 
just created. Ensure the folder/drawer remains named GQ2 and all the 
files in the archive remain in the GQ2 folder.

Double click the GQ2 icon to start the game and off you go!

The file includes a Game Guide. Please spend a little time to read 
this before playing for a better playing experience. It provides 
important information such as how to play the game, and very important
memory management information.

Requirements: Any Amiga/Emulated Amiga with 2mb chip ram and 2.04> Rom(s)
Recommended: Any Amiga with 2mb chip ram 2.04>Rom(s) '020/greater CPU.

Now off to complete the next 3 chapters of the adventures of George Angus
in Geo's Quest, "Gateway to Nowhere". Coming Soon.

Thanks for playing Geo's Quest.

Cheers
