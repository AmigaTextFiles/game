<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<REQUIREMENTS>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>


1. Any Amiga with 2MB Chip Ram. This is a Graphic Intensive game. The game uses on
   average between 600k and 1400k chip ram throughout the game. Accordingly you 
   should have at least 1500k of available chip ram to play Geo's Quest.
   (Emulated Amigas enjoy the luxury of breaking the 2mb chip ram barrier and it 
   is recommended to set it higher than 2mb for a more stable game play. 

2. 2.0 or higher Roms and Workbench.

3. A Hard Drive, or CF Card, or can be played directly from a CD (but you will not 
   be able to save games on the CD).

3. The game will run on the 68000 CPU (slowly) but it will run faster & smoother 
   on the 68020 & higher processors. Emulated Amigas will experience a near 
   seamless gameplay.
   

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<INSTALLATION>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>


1. The Game can be on any partition or drawer/folder on your HardDrive or CFcard to 
   be played. Just create a folder/drawer named GQ2 anywhere on your Amiga or your
   emulated Amiga and unarc/expand the archive into the folder/drawer you just
   created. Keep all the files that were in the archive in the GQ2 folder.


<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<GAME PLAY>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

+++++++++++++++++
Starting The Game
+++++++++++++++++

Once you have followed the above installation instructions, Double click the GQ2
game icon to start the game.The game will have a brief intro then a <Start Screen> 
will appear giving you three choices:
   1. Intro ->  This is the back story of the game and some important information
                is provided to the game player. It is recommended to watch it the
                first time you play the game.
   
   2. Play  ->  Selecting this will take you directly to the game's first room
                without watching the intro.
                
   3. Quit  ->  Selecting this will quit the game. (IMPORTANT = Game is not saved
                when using the Quit function)
                
Additionally, the game player may select a saved game here (or in most rooms in the
game) by simply pressing any of the Function Keys (F1 to F10). You can save ten
places in your game, then recall anyone of them at any time and you will be taken
directly to the room you were in at the save, at the status you were in, with the 
inventory you had at that time. 
Note: You cannot save in some rooms so just experiment.

Each time you start the game regardless of how many saves or times you played, you
will be brought to the Start Screen.


+++++++++++++++++
The Control Panel
+++++++++++++++++

The bottom of the game consists of the Control Panel, the Message Line and the
Item/Choice Window. The Control Panel has 9 Verbs for the Player to utilize.

icon in the Control Panel (LOOK) will appear on the EYE, "Look At" will appear in 
the Message Line, then hover the mouse over the tree in the game room and the
word tree will appear beside "LOOk AT" in the Message Line (if the tree can be
examined - not all things in a room may be examined) Then Right Click the tree.

+++++++++++
THE WINDOWS
+++++++++++

There are three (3) windows in the game. 

    1. The Game Room Window 
       This is the large window above the Control Panel where the Quest plays out.
       Here you will select things to take, or characters to talk to, or actions to 
       try, etc. Essentially any verb you select in the Control Panel will play out 
       in this window.
        
    2. Control Panel Windows 
       a) The Message Line window is located at the top right of the Control Panel.
       It is a narrow one text line window that will display names of things in the 
       Game Room when you point to them.It will also explain your action. 
       For Example: if you wish to look at the tree you would select the verb LOOK 
       with your left button (Look at....) will appear in the Message Line window 
       then when you point at the tree in the Game Room and select it with the right
       button (Look at tree...) will appear in the Message Line window.

       b)The Item/Choice Window is the larger window below the Message Line window.
       It will list all of your inventory items you carry throughout the game. It 
       also will list conversation sentences or choices for puzzels you will need 
       to select throughout the game. You can select these with the Left Mouse 
       Button. Whatever you select will allways appear in text in the Message Line 
       window.
       
+++++++++++++++++
MEMORY MANAGEMENT
+++++++++++++++++

Geos Quest uses a lot of Chip Ram. The rooms vary between 600k and 1000k (1MB)
depending on how many samples and anims, the complexity of the script, how many 
objects, etc are in the room.

The "LOOK IN POUCH" verb (which is the built in hint/clue guide) uses about 350kb
when you first select the verb. (you can look at as many items after that while in
the room you selected it, and it will not use any more ram). Once you leave the 
room it is cleared from memory and the memory is freed once again.

Additionaly when you "TRY" the Map and transport, it draws about 150k ram.

So you could need about 1.5mb of Chip Ram available at some points in the game.

Exiting each room clears everything from memory accummulated from that room except 
the flags; they keep track of what's going on in the game. Therefore, much of the 
chip ram is freed again to be used in the next room.

The game has a running monitor of how much chip ram you have at any given time.
Just press your "c" key (not capitalized) and the amount of free chip ram will
appear in the Message Line window.

So, if you wish to "Look In Pouch" press your "c" key first to make sure you have 
about 500k chip ram free. 
 
Same thing when you wish to "TRY" the Map, check your chip ram (press the "c" key) 
to check how much chip ram you have free.(you will need about 250k available)

If you transport alot (Try the Map)the ram usage accumulates and does not recover; 
so a good tip is to save your game at that point then quit. Then start the game
again and once at the Start Screen select your saved game (F1-F10) and you will be 
back to exactly where you were but now with the recovered Chip Ram.

That's it! It's that Easy! You should complete it in 1 or 2 sittings. Enjoy.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<GAME INTRODUCTION>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>


I statrted working on this game in 2000, and was about half way done around 2002. 
but life happened and I did not complete it. I partially finished the story, but 
never refined it or  tested it thoroughly, just no time. I uploaded it to Aminet 
in the unfinished state hoping another GRAC2 user woould finish it, but no one did.
Fast Forward 20 years later now that I am retired, I resurected all my old projects 
in hopes to see them to completion. Don't want to build bird houses...;-)

This is the first of 4 projects I started (please note GQ1 was simply a trial and
error of how to use GRAC2, and not afilliated with this series revolving around
George Angus). I have 6 more chapters in this Geo's Quest series which will form
GQ3, and a prequel of how it all began for George.

This game design is intended for teens and up. Although there are some light adult 
situations and minor language,there is no violence, blood, death or shooting. 
You will not die anytime you make a wrong choice, if fact you can't die anywhere
in this game. You will be able to end the game rather easily providing you use your
problem solving skills.
 
The game has several branches to it depending on what choices you make leading to 
different rooms, adventures etc. So, it can be played multiple times and appear 
like a different game at various points.It is intentionaly designed in the nastalga 
genre modelled after the early Roberta Williams Sierra low resolution 16 & 32 
colour Quests (King Quest 1,2,etc). There are over 100 hand drawn rooms and close 
ups, many characters, plenty of puzzles, many mods, samples, mazes and more. 

It is a parody of the Commodore story (names & characters intentionaly mispelled so 
not to offend or infringe.

The game engine is Edmond Clay's Grac2 that he created using AMOS Professional. 

This game was developed initially on a NTSC A1200 w/030 card 16mb ram. After I
sold that in 2007, then resurected this project in late 2021, I used my Macbook 
with FS-UAE but wasn't satisfied with the "feel" so I searched ebay for an A600
or A1200,and after recovering from heart failure at seeing the prices !!!OMG!!!, I 
found a PAL A1200 w/8mb ram that I could afford and completed it on that.(after 
recapping by Retro Rewind). Yes the Mac was so much faster, but banging this old 
keyboard, and experiencing the ocassional GURU error made the experience all the 
more realistic. It was a tremendous sole effort, literally years and thousands of 
hours developing the story, hand drawing all the graphics and anims (PPaint 7), 
coding all the scripts (GRAC2), writing and recording the music (OctaMed),adding 
all the samples, coverting the original work to PAL, and the never ending testing. 
(Hopefuly I caught and corrected every bug)

This game is freely distributable. But please keep it in tact as it is part of a 
graphic storybook which will not be freely distrubutable.

Various Samples, and Mods are from the AMOS PD LIBRARY, authors unknown.

I am open to any comments, constructive criticism (be kind please), suggestions, 
bug reports, whatever your heart desires.

Stay tuned for the continuing adventures of George Angus in the next 3 chapters=>
Geo's Quest - Gateway to Nowhere. Coming Soon to Aminet or directly from me.

Thanks for playing Geo's Quest!
