@{u}START-UP INSTRUCTIONS@{uu}


@{i}General Requirements@{ui}

The game requires about 1,5MB of free RAM to run, which means your
machine must have at least 2MB to begin with.

Testing has been done on ECS (A600) and AGA (A1200) machines with
Workbench 2.05 and 3.0, with and without fast RAM. I do not guarantee
that it works well with older versions of Workbench. 

The recommended equipment is a standard A1200 or better - on older
machines, things are a bit sluggish. Of course, we are all also aware of
how nice it is to have a hard drive :-)


@{i}Installation:@{ui}

 1. Unpack both archives (OlafInBaghdad.lha and OlafInBaghdad2.lha) to
the
    same hard disk drawer.

 2. Double-click the "Olaf 1" icon and play!


@{i}NOTE! Known bug!!!@{ui}

Well, it is not a very big one - more of an irritating fact, really. At
least on some machines, you cannot set a warning sound in the Workbench
Prefs, if you wish to play Olaf 1. Something in large, compiled AMOS Pro
programs seems to trigger the Workbench warning beep all the time, which
is very annoying.

The solution is simple enough - just open the Workbench Sound Prefs and
turn off the sound.


@{i}Trouble-shooting@{ui}

Olaf has been tested with various peripherals connected to the machines,
without any significant problems. If the program works all right, then
don't bother with any of this!

On the other hand, if you experience paranormal activity, try the
following:

* Re-boot! Olaf is happier when started in a "clean machine".

* Turn off commodities that may cause trouble: Screen blankers, mouse
  blankers, clocks, application launchers...

* Turn off hardware extensions: accelerator boards, PCMCIA equipment,
etc.

@{u}WELCOME TO 950 A.D.!@{uu}

The Vikings were a truly adventurous breed. So what could be more
natural than casting a Viking as the big hero of a computer adventure?
Nothing. And so we did!

Our hero is Olaf Longhair - a rather short and rather fat Viking from
just outside the town of Birka in the Baltic Sea. Like many fellow
countrymen, he has steered his longship eastwards on the Russian rivers
to find fame and fortune in the Middle East.

After losing his ship and crew in Gurgan, Olaf has now arrived in
Baghdad where he must obtain a pass from the Caliph of Baghdad in order
to continue his journey home.

If you have played any of the now classic adventures, such as the Indy
games or Monkey Island, you should soon come to grips with how the game
works.

@{u}PLAYING THE GAME@{uu}


@{i}The Basics@{ui}

The screen is divided into two main parts: The upper part is the scene
area, and the lower part is the command area.

You guide Olaf through the game world by giving him commands. Commands
are constructed by combining one of the nine available verbs, shown in
the command area, with one or two objects. Object are found in the
inventory (to the right of the command verbs in the scene area) and in
the scene area - whenever you move the mouse cursor over an object in
the scene area, its name appears above the cursor.

By clicking a verb or an object with the left mouse button, you
"transfer" it to the sentence box at the very top of the command area.
You may click the verbs and objects in any order. If a certain verb and
object combination requires that you select a second object on which to
operate, a preposition (connecting word) is shown in the command area,
and the game does not try to act on the sentence until a second object
has been clicked. For example, if you click the verb "USE" and then the
object "SMALL KNIFE" (which is in the inventory from the very start of
the game), the sentence box read "USE SMALL KNIFE ON" and waits for you
to click on the object on which to use the small knife.

When a sentence is complete, it is highlighted, and the mouse cursor
temporarily disappears while the system acts on the command. When it is
time for you to take control again, the sentence is erased, and the
cursor re-appears.

Note: When there are more than six objects in the inventory, arrows
appear next to it. The inventory list can be scrolled up or down by
clicking on the arrows with the left mouse button.


@{i}Walking about@{ui}

If you wish to move Olaf to another place in the room, point to the
desired spot with the cursor and click the right mouse button. Olaf
walks to the closest possible point.

Some locations are so big you can't see all of them at the same time. If
you make Olaf walk close to the edge of the screen, the "camera" will
automatically follow him, revealing more of the background scenery (if
there is any).


@{i}Making an Exit@{ui}

Apart from the objects in the scene area, there are also one or more
exits from each location ("room") in the game. When you move the cursor
over an exit, a text appears above the cursor specifying where it leads.
(The colour of the exit names are not the same as for the object names,
so it is easy to tell them apart.)

Just click with the left mouse button on an exit to make Olaf use it.


@{i}Talking with people@{ui}

You will spend lots of time talking with other people you encounter in
the game. Usually, a conversation is started by using the command "TALK
TO object" (where the object would normally be a person:-) . Sometimes,
another command or walking into a particular spot also makes you engage
in a conversation.

Talking with people is easy: The ordinary command area disappears and is
replaced with a dialogue area, where all lines available to Olaf are
shown.

Click the left mouse button on a line, watch Olaf speak it, and await
the response. Usually, each time you get a response, the set of
available lines changes. If there are more than four alternatives
available, arrows appear next to the list of lines. The list can then be
scrolled by clicking the arrows with the left mouse button.


@{i}Cutscenes@{ui}

At some stages, the game goes into a fully automatic mode requiring no
input from you. You will be treated to short animated scenes telling
part of the story and setting the scene for things to come. Such scenes
are called cutscenes. During most of them, a movie camera icon is shown
instead of the nine command verbs in the command area.

When you have played a certain part of the game a couple of times, you
may wish to skip these cutscenes, since they are always the same. In
most cases, you can do this by pressing the [Esc] key. Some cutscenes
actually consist of a number of consecutive cutscenes, som you may have
to press [Esc] several times to skip to the part you wish to go to.

@{u}HINTS AND TIPS@{uu}

 * Pick up everything you can get your hand on. Sooner or later,
   chances are you will need it.

 * You must often talk to the same  character several times to get all
   the information available. Things you observe or other conversations

   may give you new dialogue alternatives when talking to others.

 * When you get stuck, try to think about all the objects you have and
   have seen, and think about new ways to combine them. Search through 
   all accessible locations again to see if you have missed any
   objects.

 * Look at everything closely. Close examination often reveal
   astonishing things, and may also give you additional material for 
   dialogues with other characters.

 * It is very hard to get Olaf killed. Don't be afraid to experiment!

@{u}The GRAAL Language@{uu}


In the process of making this game, a whole new language has been
cnstructed. Based upon Amos Professional, the Graphic Adventure
Authoring Language  - GRAAL for short - only needs standard ASCII text
files, IFF picture files,  Protracker sound files and raw or IFF sample
files to produce the results you see in "Olaf".

The shareware version of GRAAL is available on aminet. Enjoy!
