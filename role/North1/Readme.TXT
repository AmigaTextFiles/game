North Ridge Episode 1-10  READ ME File.
And Other's

OK, I have seen the tremendous possibilities that Dungeon II has to offer.
Giark has 'lent' me a map maker/editor and I have created a few maps with
more to come.  

Requirements:You NEED an Amiga....That's it for hardware.  You need to be
running Dungeon II V2.14, for the map(s) to work completely.

To explain how EASY it is to make your OWN adventures you FIRST have to
register the program, (see bottom) and MAYBE Giark will release the map
maker.
  
Step 1)Write your idea(s) down on paper, including a plot line IF yo intend
       to have more than 1 'episode'.

     2)Make a MAP, on GRAPH PAPER!  This is a MUST! Lable the rooms..etc.

     3)Number the rooms from 1....(end) MAX of 200, as far as V2.14 is
       concerned.

     4)Create a list of Foes,Weapons,Armour,Items, and Potions that can be
       found in the game.

     5)Start filling in the information into the map editor. Avoid being
       repeditive in your room descriptions, but it was easier for ME in
       the beginning.

     6)When you are finished entering the information, DOUBLE check it!
       Remember, this is your FIRST map.  You WILL encounter problems, I
       did, but they are easily tracked down and fixed.

That's BASICALLY it for the map editor, except it has it's own built in
'tester(s)'.  The map editor will test your rooms, as if you were walking
from room to room.  I have added in some features of my own, into the one I
use.  Item checker, will display ANY room with something that YOU put in a
room.  I am currently working on a moc 'combat' to TEST the strength of the
monsters, to avoid creating 'god' creatures which you can NEVER beat.

The map editor is NOT available YET, as of 03/21/96. IT MIGHT become
available to regestered users.  It's up to the response of the people now.

OK, on with the program!

I currently have NorthRidge Episode(s) 1 AND 2 finished.  There is a plot
to the damned story, which I intend to follow.  Basically I hope you enjoy
it, and you can find the other episodes wher ever you found this one.

Disclamer:

	I take NO responsibility, implied, or said(written or verble) for
ANYTHING this program does, either directly or indirectly to the USER or to
the user's computer.  I take NO responsibility for my shitty spelling OR my
use of harsh languages. I'll try and keep the language to a minimum. 
YOU are WARNED that this module is only MAKE BELIEF, and I will not feel
guilty about someone loosing sleep for playing it 24hrs/day.

NO ONE has the right to CHARGE for this program, other than Shipping +
Handling.  Being as I am not charging for it, NO ONE else should.  This
program is Public Domain, or what ever.  It's for EVERYONE to enjoy.

Dungeon V2.00 Registration

What's Missing?

If you are trying Dungeon V2.00 for the first time, you'll notice something
is missing - the modem options.  That's it, though.  You won't see any
time-wasting requesters or silly screens added for your aggravation.

Why Register?

If you don't register, you're doomed to wandering around in the dungeon
alone.  One of the best features of Dungeon V2.00 is the ability to get
another victim, err, opponent, into the dungeon with you to take out your
frustrations on.

It should be noted, however, that your unregistered version of Dungeon
V2.00 will still make use of any Dungeon V2.00 Modules that you have
purchased.

How Do I Register?

Dungeon V2.00 can be registered at a cost of $15.00 plus $2.00 for shipping
and handling, or include a blank disk and a SASE (a regular letter stamp
should suffice) to avoid the shipping and handling charges.

If you are interested in other FBN products, take a look at the FBN
Catalog.  You'll find descriptions of all the current products, as well as
news about upcoming releases.  There is also a handy order form for you to

Dungeon V2.00 Modules

Module                 Description
Classic                From the good old days of Dungeon V1.00, this one is
                       an homage to the spirit of the original.  The same
                       monsters, the same weapons - it's all here, and it's
                       included with the Dungeon V2.00 program.

Alien Derelict         Out in space, far from any help, you have to find
                       the code key and get off the alien vessel so that
                       the scientists of Earth can use that information to
                       destroy the alien vessel before it hits the Earth.
                       Grab your weapon and hope you can survive the
                       monsters and other hazards of the Alien Derelict.

The Riddle Of Chang Ku In a far off land that no one remembers, stand the
                       twin fortresses of Chang Ku and Chang Lom, former
                       home of the warrior priests of the two headed god
                       Lom Ku.  Archaeologists and grave robbers alike
                       scour the ruins for treasures.  As an ancestor of
                       the original warrior priests, you must rid the area
                       of those who wish to desecrate the sanctity of the
                       great fortresses.  Beware, the gods are watching.

The House Of Fright    In a normal world, things like this don't happen.
                       In a normal world, you wouldn't be searching a haunted
                       house for the last will and testament of someone
                       named `Uncle Bohunk'.  Find yourself something to
                       protect yourself with - even a book - and grab up
                       something to fend off the hordes of undead that keep
                       popping up.

Aliens!                In a blaze of flame, you blast through another
                       clump of aliens.  The research notes are in your
                       pocket, nestled against the experimental weapon that
                       can save the galaxy from the slavering hordes of
                       voracious aliens.  Now all you have to do is get out
                       alive!

Shootout At The
     CyberSpace Corral Welcome to the Old West!  The town of CyberSpace
                       Gulch needs your help, Pardner.  Giark and the BBS
                       Gang has taken over the town.  It's up to you to
                       bring law back to the town.  Don't be fooled by
                       them!  They'll gun you down without a thought.

Rumble In The Subway   The exits are sealed and so is your fate.  As a
                       member of the special crime task force, it's your
                       job to take out thegang boss that your team has
                       trapped in the subway station.  Only problem is, he
                       won't stand still.  Catch and kill Big Bad Louie -
                       if you can.
                       (Requires Dungeon Version 2.10 or higher.)

Thanks:  Many thanks go to Giark, for creating dungeon II
	 And Shawni Stevens, without you it would have taken me longer to
	 create some of the games!
