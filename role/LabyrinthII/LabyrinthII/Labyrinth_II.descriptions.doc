{1}[Staffroom][This is the staffroom, littered with empty coffeecups and pieces of paper. A photocopier stands in the corner. The only exit is to the southeast.][SE -2]
{2}[Outside Stationery Shop][You are standing outside the school stationery shop which lies to the west. The staffroom is to the northwest and a corridor leads back to the south. An open glass door leads north.][N 74 NW -1 S 4]
{3}[Office][This is the main office, actually a series of rooms but portrayed here as a single room basically because the programmer couldn't be bothered putting in any more. The door leads southeast.][SE -4]
{4}[Reception][This is the main reception area. A telephone is on the wall. The office lies to the northwest, the library to the southwest and the dining hall to the south. A catwalk leads east to the main part of the school.][N 2 E 7 S 6 SW 5 NW -3]
{5}[Library][You are in the school library, whose door bears the sign GAMBLE LIBRARY for some reason beyond mortal ken. The exit is to the northeast.][NE 4]
{6}[Dining Hall][You are in the dining hall, a large chamber which is about the only place in the school with windows big enough to take advantage of sunlight for illumination. It seems almost dazzlingly bright compared to the sickly glow of the fluorescent tubes elsewhere. A corridor leads north.][N 4]
{7}[Catwalk][You are on a catwalk which leads from east to west above the assembly hall. A microphone and lectern are in front of you. Trying to go south would result in a nasty fall but you can descend into the hall via the steps to the southwest and southeast.][SW 8 SE 8 W 4 E 24]
{8}[Assembly Hall][This is the main school assembly hall, also used as a gym. It contains nothing of any interest whatsoever apart from a few hand-lettered NO SMOKING signs on the walls and some lines painted on the floor. You can ascend the steps to the northwest or northeast or go out the back way to the south.][NW 7 NE 7 S 9]
{9}[Back of Assembly Hall][You are on a sort of ledge at the back of the assembly hall which stretches out before you in all its immensity. It can be entered to the north or abandoned via the stairway to the south.][N 8 S 11]
{10}[Cold Smelly Room][You are in a small dusty classroom. On the wall is a blackboard covered in writing about accountancy with the words DO NOT ERASE next to it. To make sure that people will always have the freedom to obey or disobey this command according to the dictates of their own conscience, the duster is chained to the blackboard. The room smells like the rhinoceros cage in the zoo, which is probably the reason why the window is always kept open, letting in a freezing draught. The exit is to the east.][E -11]
{11}[Bottom of Stairs][You are at the bottom of a small staircase which rises to the north. A classroom can be entered to the west and a corridor to the southeast.][N 9 SE 48 W -10]
{12}[Junior Assembly Hall][This is a smallish hall with no catwalk or microphones. It can be left to the east. It could also be left to the west if the door wasn't jammed which it is (i.e. if the programmer hadn't made a mess of the map and been too lazy to redesign it) or to the south if the big wooden partition could be rolled back (which it can't; this is a simple RPG not an Infocom interactive novel).][E 23]
{13}[End of Main Corridor][You are at the "northern" end of the main corridor. A smaller corridor leads off to the east and a girls' toilet lies to the southeast.][E 15 SE 22 S 23]
{14}[Room One][This is a totally boring classroom with some stupid Irish language (excuse the tautology) posters on the wall. The exit is to the southeast.][SE -15]
{15}[Language Block][This is the region of the school where languages are mostly taught. Classrooms lie on all four diagonal compass points. The main corridor is west of here and a tiny little passage leads east.][NE -16 E 18 SE -20 SW -21 W 13 NW -14]
{16}[Room Two][This is an unremarkable classroom with some French language posters on the wall. The exit is to the southwest.][SW -15]
{17}[Room Three][This is an ordinary classroom with no posters that the programmer can remember on the wall. The exit is to the south.][S -18]
{18}[Tiny Little Passageway][You are at the end of a tiny passage which leads west. Rooms are to the north and southeast.][W 15 N -17 SE -19]
{19}[Room Four][This is an uninteresting classroom with some German language posters on the wall. The exit is to the northwest and another door lies to the north.][NW -18 N -70]
{20}[Room Five][This is a classroom of no great importance. There may or may not be posters on the wall but since the programmer hasn't been in here for years he doesn't remember any. The exit is to the northwest.][NW -15]
{21}[Room Six][You are in Nellie's room. It isn't really any more interesting than the other ones around here. The exit is to the northeast.][NE -15]
{22}[Girls' Toilet][This is presumably your average sort of girls' toilet; the programmer of course has never been in here, so cannot provide much detail. Perhaps a more dedicated programmer would have researched it for this game. Oh well, when you're a genius who needs dedication? Exit is northwest.][NW 13]
{23}[Near Corridor End][You are near the end of the main north-south corridor. A door leads west.][N 13 S 24 W 12]
{24}[Crossroads][From here you can go north or south along a long corridor, west into the hall or east along a much smaller corridor. A toilet is northeast of here and a deserted cloakroom lies to the southeast.][N 23 NE 25 E 28 SE 26 S 34 W 7]
{25}[Girls' Toilet][Use your imagination! Exit southwest. I probably shouldn't waste memory telling you the exits like this, you should have a map anyway (what do you mean, you don't find my games interesting enough to map?!?) but what the hell, we're not likely to run short of it on the Amiga.][SW 24]
{26}[Deserted Cloakroom][This unfortunate cloakroom was put out of a job by the amazing new technological innovation, Lockers Big Enough To Hold Coats As Well As Other Stuff, and has not seen a human being for many ages. It must be very grateful to you for giving it some company. When you tire of being kind to a lonely cloakroom you may leave to the northwest.][NW 24]
{27}[Room Seven][This room has a big map of the world on a wall and a smaller map of Africa near the door which has many useful dates and things like that on it but unfortunately not the date of the map itself so you can tell how out of date it is. The door leads southeast.][SE -28]
{28}[Humanities Block][This is the block of classrooms mostly used for teaching boring things like geography and economics and so on. Classrooms lie to the northwest, northeast, southwest and southeast and corridors lead east and west.][NE -29 E 31 SE -32 SW -33 W 24 NW -27]
{29}[Room Eight][You really don't want a detailed description of this crummy little place, just leave to the southwest.][SW -28]
{30}[Room Nine][This is the room used by the careers guidance teacher and is full of the appropriate documents, posters and so on. Material here could be borrowed by providing a written request but since there's no writing materials here that saves the programmer the bother of including the facility in the game. One door leads south.][S -31]
{31}[End of Little Corridor][You are at the end of a little corridor whose only purpose is to lead to the room to the north. You can also go back west.][N -30 W 28]
{32}[Room Ten][No, you can't play a C64 version of 3D Breakout here, this is just the "geography room" which doesn't make much sense to the programmer since all the geography classes he had to endure were in Room Eleven next door. The room is full of wooden stools and a few cushioned ones for which there is always a frantic scramble at the beginning of every  class. Exit northwest.][NW -28]
{33}[Room Eleven][This is Spencer's room; on the wall is the result of a pupils' survey nominating him as the most popular teacher along with some ghastly model advertisements. Exit northeast.][NE -28]
{34}[T-Junction][A smaller corridor branches off to the east from the main corridor here. A deserted cloakroom is northeast of here and a toilet lies to the southeast.][N 24 S 48 E 38 NE 35 SE 36]
{35}[Deserted Cloakroom][The dust of the ages hangs heavy on this long-disused place, and your footsteps sound hollowly in the stillness. A single doorway leads southwest to areas where life still goes on.][SW 34]
{36}[Boys' Toilet][If you've seen one you've seen them all. Exit northwest.][NW 34]
{37}[Room Twelve][This place is of no interest whatsoever and if it wasn't for its possible use as a combat arena there would've been no point in putting it in at all. If you're not using it for that right now you can leave to the southeast.][SE -38]
{38}[Science Block][This is where the science subjects are mostly taught. Classrooms can be entered to the four secondary compass points and a corridor leads east. Another door leads south.][S -72 NE -39 E 41 SE -43 SW -44 W 34 NW -37]
{39}[Room Thirteen][Another totally boring room. I've been giving you the directions of exits from all rooms for so long I might as well keep at it; this one's exit is southwest.][SW -38]
{40}[Room Fourteen][This place used to be mildly interesting but unpleasant; now it's less unpleasant and totally uninteresting. What the hell, you're probably engaged in mortal combat and not paying any attention to this description at all. Exit south.][S -41]
{41}[End of Corridor][A small corridor leads off to the west and rooms can be entered to the north, south and southeast.][W 38 N -40 SE -71 S -42]
{42}[Physics Lab][This is where Walter ("Wally") Hosford teaches physics (to the best of his ability). Several books on the subject are on a shelf near the door, the most used being one entitled HOW TO GET A JOB AS A PHYSICS TEACHER WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING THAT COSMIC RAYS ARE NOT PART OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM, and a couple of propaganda posters for the nuclear power industry are on the opposite wall. This room also functions as the school junk food shop and boxes of crisps and sweets are in a cupboard. If you make the wise decision to leave this place you can use the door to the north.][N -41]
{43}[Chemistry Lab][This is McArdle's chemistry lab, redolent with the exotic aromas of carcinogenic chemicals. Many stools are arranged around the place but here and there (wow, such blatant luxury!) are actually a few CHAIRS! If you were having a class in here you would be well advised to grab one immediately but as it is you can continue to examine the room and note that there are two exits, one to the northwest and the other to the southwest, and a small door leading west.][NW -38 SW -67 W 72]
{44}[Biology Lab][This is Dr. Frewin's biology lab, lined with various posters of the intestines of rabbits and earthworms from which you hurriedly turn your gaze. Doorways lead northeast, southeast and east.][NE -38 E 72 SE -67]
{45}[Main Corridor][You are on the main north-south corridor which stretches into the distance in either direction. A toilet lies to the northeast and the prefects' room to the east.][N 48 S 49 NE 46 E 47]
{46}[Boys' Toilet][This is your average toilet, with graffiti on the walls and cigarette butts in the urinals. Some of the graffiti might make interesting reading but this is supposed to be family entertainment so I'll refrain from quoting it here. Exit is southwest.][SW 45]
{47}[Prefects' Room][This is the room which the prefects are allowed to use in the hope that it'll compensate them for having to spent half the day doing menial unpaid labour and maybe failing their Leaving Cert because of all the classes they miss. If you're not a prefect you should really leave by the door to the west.][W 45 SW 49]
{48}[Pupils' Entrance][An exit from the school leads west of here. Radiators have been cleverly positioned on the walls at this point so all the heat can escape from the building as quickly as possible. A large open door leads northwest.][N 34 S 45 NW 11 W 73]
{49}[T-Junction][A corridor leads east at this point. The prefects' room lies to the northeast and a toilet to the southeast.][N 45 S 51 NE 47 SE 50 E 61]
{50}[Boys' Toilet][This is the second southernmost of the chain of toilets which runs all the way down the school, apart from the new prototype model at the end which was retired from service shortly after construction, perhaps due to underlying flaws in the design. Exit northwest.][NW 49]
{51}[T-Junction][One last side corridor leads off to the east from here. A toilet lies to the northeast.][N 49 S 69 E 55 NE 53]
{52}[Room 23][Forget it. There's nothing worth describing here. Exit southeast.][SE -55]
{53}[Girls' Toilet][You think you've got problems? Have you ever had to write individual descriptions of half a dozen toilets simply because they're in the actual design of the place you're doing a map of? Exit southwest.][SW 51]
{54}[Room Whatever][At this stage I can't remember what number this room is and I'm sure you're not interested either. Exit NE. In case you've just started exploring the game and wonder why I sound so tired of the descriptions already, I started at the far end.][NE 55]
{55}[New Block][Well, new-ish, built about three or four years ago. Standard layout, classrooms NE, NW, SE, SW, corridors west and east.][NE -57 E 58 SE -56 SW -54 W 51 NW -52]
{56}[Boring Room][Exit northwest. Nothing much else to describe, in fact I've never actually been in this room so I wouldn't know if there was.][NW -55]
{57}[Room 24][(I think.) I'm beginning to lose track of the numbers at this stage. Exit southwest.][SW -55]
{58}[End of Little Corridor][Rooms are to the northeast and east, with the usual smart notice on the door about the computer club. Corridor leads west.][W 55 NE -60 E -59]
{59}[Computer Room][This is the major centre of learning in the school in that Mr. Reeves teaches the higher level maths class here. It's also the site for the school computer club. Along two walls are rows of the latest super-high-tech microcomputers; peering closely at one of them you make out  the words "Personal Electronic Transactor" inscribed on the side. It's running a beta-test version of MUD; a note on the desk beside it says, "MUD development currently ahead of schedule; at this rate we should have it finally finished by 1998 at the latest...". On another table is an Amiga running the game Emerald Mines, with the initials RW at the top of all the high score tables. The door, which is beginning to sag drunkenly on its hinges after repeated dismountings and remountings to provide access to the large-screen display unit for CUGI meetings, leads west.][W -58]
{60}[Room 25][This is where Harry Tilson teaches the plebs lower maths. Intelligent people like you will want to immediately use the exit southwest.][SW -58]
{61}[Whatchamacallit Block][This block of classrooms is used for whatever people happen to use it for and has no specific purpose. A corridor leads west and another one east. Rooms lie to the south and southwest and an empty space is to the north.][N 67 E 62 S -65 SW -64 W 49]
{62}[End of Short Corridor][This is the end of a short corridor. It continues to the west. Rooms are east and south of here.][E -63 S -66 W 61]
{63}[Room 19][Yeah, yeah, we've seen it all before. Exit leads west.][W -62]
{64}[Room 22][Etc. Exit northeast.][NE -61]
{65}[Room 21][Basically, this is just sort of like your genuine Room 21. Exit north.][N -61]
{66}[Room 20][Apologies for not giving you some more interesting descriptions, but what can you say about Room 20 that you haven't already said about Rooms 1 to 19? Just for a change I won't tell you where the exit is, you know it already anyway.][N -62]
{67}[Corridor to Art Room][You are in a short corridor leading west to the Art Room. The corridor is of glass and illustrates some brilliant features of the school's architecture, such as the layout designed to expose the maximum surface area to the outside while not actually letting in much light, and the radiators placed along glass walls so that the largest possible fraction of the heat goes straight out of the building. The other rooms in this block lie to the south and doors lead northeast and northwest.][NE -43 NW -44 E -68 S 61]
{68}[Art Room][This is the room in which art is taught. Not surprisingly, the walls are lined with sketches and paintings of varying quality. Some particularly good ones from a couple of years ago have the initials "RW" inscribed in one corner. A door leads westwards. The windows would lead out to the grounds if you could open them, or in this case they would lead to Nothing, Absolute Void, so it's probably just as well you can't.][W -67]
{69}[Lockers][This is the "southern" end of the main corridor. A bank of lockers is arranged along the wall and another one in the middle. A disused toilet lies to the southeast; it was very cleverly put out of use immediately after it had been completed so that none of the expense of its construction could be spared.][N 51]
{70}[Private Chamber][This is Mr. Stiobhard's private chamber where he spends much of his time when he isn't teaching a class, doing whatever he does in here. A strong odor of fresh coffee pervades the air. The classroom can be re-entered to the south.][S -19]
{71}[Darkroom][This is the darkroom used by the school photographic club, also for the occasional physics experiment which requires silence/darkness and also benefits from the absence of hassle to actually do the experiment instead of just hanging around chatting and making up the results at the end. Exit northwest.][NW -41]
{72}[Storeroom][This is a storeroom for equipment and chemicals used in chemistry and biology classes. An oven and a small refrigerator are present. The chemistry and biology labs can be entered to the east and west, and an exit leads north.][N -38 W 44 E 43]
{73}[Outside School][You are standing just outside the Pupils' Entrance which is to the east. To the west the concrete paving seems to fade into mist, though becoming no less substantial to the touch.][E 48 W 75]
{74}[Misty Corridor][To the south you can see some prosaic walls and corridors but to the north the passage fades into a pale mist.][S 2 N 75]
{75}[Space Warp][This is a region of space-time extruded from hyperspace. Below you is a rotating collapsed object anchoring this region to normal space and generating a gravitational pull which anchors you to the force-field you stand on. A sign in disembodied glowing letters above you says PLEASE DROP ALL VALUABLE OBJECTS THROUGH FORCE-FIELD TO SCORE POINTS. The boundary walls become permeable to the north, south and east. To the west, through a discontinuity, you can see bright daylight.][N 95 S 74 E 73 W 116]
{76}[Kitchen][To the east you can see the dining hall and to the south is the main hallway.][E 77 S 80]
{77}[Dining Hall][The kitchen lies to the west.][W 76]
{78}[Basement][This is a damp, gloomy basement. A door leads east to the jail and another one south to the town hall.][E 79 S 82]
{79}[Jail][With the doors jammed open this is merely a place like any other. Exits lead west and south.][W 78 S 83]
{80}[Hallway][This is a simple north-south hall.][N 76 S 84]
{81}[Library][Most of the shelves here are fully stocked, but a gap appears in the section on adventure games, under the heading SOLVING MAZES. A door leads east.][E 82]
{82}[Town Hall][You are in the Town Hall of Atlantis. Doors lead west and south. Another one leads north. Beside it is a piece of paper saying YOU MAY REGRET IT IF YOU GO NORTH. This is because that door used to be one-way but it has now been jammed permanently open both ways.][N 78 W 81 S 86]
{83}[Railway Station][The plaza lies to the south and, incongruously, the jail to the north. In order to dispense with the hassle of getting trains, they have been replaced with a space-warp which leads directly east.][N 79 S 87 E 108]
{84}[Olympic Field][I didn't know they had the Olympic Games in Atlantis. Nevertheless, the original map says Olympic Field and why bother changing it? All the sporting equipment has been looted by thieving adventurers. Exits lead north, south and east.][N 80 S 88 E 85]
{85}[Supply Room][This is a small underground room used for storing supplies. Exits lead west to the Olympic Field, east to an open plaza and south to an underground chamber.][W 84 E 86 S 89]
{86}[West End][You are standing at the western end of a long plaza. A sated manta ray regards you from a corner. Passages lead north and west.][N 82 E 87 W 85]
{87}[East End][You are at the east end of the plaza. A railway station can be entered to the north.][W 86 N 83]
{88}[Ahab's Chamber][This is the chamber once used by Captain Ahab (don't ask me what he's got to do with Atlantis!). Doorways lead north and south.][N 84 S 91]
{89}[Barren Chamber][You are in a large empty chamber. A passage leads north and a small narrow doorway leads east.][N 85 E 90]
{90}[Barber's Shop][This is a fairly ordinary barber's shop except for the fact of its being in the lost city of Atlantis. The main exit leads south to the street and a small back door leads west.][S 97 W 89]
{91}[Graveyard][You are in an ancient graveyard. Most of the tombstones are still in place but the earth covering some of the graves has been washed away by the currents revealing the skeletal remains of the buried bodies, some with tatters of flesh still clinging to them and being nibbled by passing fish. Exits lead north and east.][N 88 E 92]
{92}[Dead End][It isn't really since you can go either west or south.][W 91 S 93]
{93}[End of Street][You are at the western end of a long street. A small side road leads north and an underground passage leads south.][N 92 S 96 E 97]
{94}[Submarine][This is an old Polaris nuclear submarine made obsolete by the new Trident system and converted to a different use. The nuclear engines power two devices: a spacewarp generator which holds open the tunnel to the south and a gaseous diffusion catalyser which enables you to breathe in this region even though it's all underwater. A sign on the wall says, "The map for this area was taken from Atlantis Adventure on the Commodore PET. All of the obstacles to movement have been removed for your convenience. Please do not try to disturb any of the objects which come with the scenery as this could lead to a causality violation. Safety precautions have been taken to ensure that this rule is obeyed." The airlock to the east is open and the vessel is flooded with water, but you find no difficulty in breathing.][S 95 E 96]
{95}[Misty Tunnel][You are in a strange vague misty passage which seems to lead from the south, where it becomes even mistier, to the north, where you can see the glow of fluorescent lights.][N 94 S 75]
{96}[Corridor][You are in a gloomy underwater corridor which runs from an opening in a gleaming metal hull to the west into darkness to the east. An opening in the wall leads north.][W 94 E 98 N 93]
{97}[Street][This is a wide, open street running from west to east. A shop is to the north and a passage leads south.][W 93 E 99 S 98]
{98}[Alcove][This is a small alcove off the main street to the north. A tunnel leads west and you can also wander east into some growths of coral.][W 96 E 100 N 99]
{99}[End of Street][You are at the eastern end of a long street which leads west from here. A dark cave opens to the east and a side road runs south.][W 97 S 100 E 106]
{100}[Coral Reef][Coral has taken over what used to be a patch of open ground. You can go west into a narrow gap or north along a small street between buildings. An exit also leads east, where you can see the swirl of disturbed water.][W 98 N 99 E 107]
{101}[Orchard][This is an ordinary apple orchard except for one particularly large tree which bears the plaque "Arborus aurum". All the fruit from this tree appears to have been stolen by robbers though. Exits are west and south.][W 112 S 102]
{102}[Passageway][You are walking along a simple north-south passage.][N 101 S 103]
{103}[Colosseum][Wasn't this supposed to be in Rome or somewhere like that? Maybe they copied it from Atlantis. Exits lead north and south.][N 102 S 104]
{104}[Hole][You are scrambling through a jagged hole in a thick stone wall. Exits lead north and south.][N 103 S 105]
{105}[Fort][This is a primitive stone fort whose high walls overlook the watery deeps to the east and south. A tunnel leads west and the huge iron cannon pointing at the wall to the north appears to have been used for that wall has a gaping hole in it.][N 104 W 106]
{106}[Dark Cave][You are in a dark, gloomy cave. Light shows to the east, west and south.][W 99 E 105 S 107]
{107}[Whirlpool][You are at the bottom of a huge whirlpool. A strong current of water rushes downwards and dissipates as it hits the ground. The occasional piece of debris rushes down the whirlpool but you couldn't possibly go up it, only west or north.][W 100 N 106]
{108}[Warp Tunnel][Cannibalized from a disused Pac-Man game, this tunnel replaces the old-fashioned rail link between the two stations to the east and west.][W 83 E 109]
{109}[Railway Station][You are standing on the platform of an old station. What appears to be a long tunnel leads west and there is no sign of any train. A doorway leads east.][W 108 E 110]
{110}[Rubbish Tip][You are at the bottom of a tall cliff, surrounded by rubbish which has presumably been tipped over the top. The cliff looks climbable. A road leads west.][W 109 U 111]
{111}[Clifftop][You stand at the top of a tall cliff overlooking lower ground to the west. A path leads east. The cliff, though steep, looks climbable.][W 110 D 110 E 113]
{112}[Hill][You are on a low rounded hill. Paths lead east and south.][E 101 S 113]
{113}[Temple][You are in a magnificent stone temple. Passages lead north, south, east and west.][N 112 S 115 W 111 E 114]
{114}[Danger][I haven't played Atlantis Adventure in two years and I can't remember what this place was like. My map simply says DANGER so I'll have to leave it at that. Anyway the only exit leads west.][W 113]
{115}[Passage][This is a short passage leading from the temple to the north to the edge of a steep precipice to the south. A strong swirling current flows over the edge and down towards the murky deeps.][N 113 S 107 D 107]
{116}[Shore][You are on a sandy, sandy shore on the northern edge of a desert island. A sign on a post reads as follows: "The map of this region was taken from the Commodore 64 game Island Adventure by Peter Gerrard. This is a shareware program so I'm fairly sure I'm not violating any copyright laws. Detailed text is entirely my own responsibility. Have fun. Signed - Russell Wallace." A path leads south into the dense tropical jungle. A large misty circle hangs in the air to the east, inviting you to enter.][E 75 S 117]
{117}[Strolling in Sun][You are strolling in the sun along a north-south path through the jungle.][N 116 S 118]
{118}[Near Path End][You are near the southern end of the north-south path.][N 117 S 129]
{119}[Drop][You are forced to a halt by a steep drop on all sides except south.][S 120]
{120}[Near Swamp][You are near a swampy region which lies to the south and east. A narrow path leads north.][E 121 SE 124 S 123 N 119]
{121}[Dirty Trail][This trail has not been washed in several weeks. It leads in all non-northerly directions at once.][W 120 SW 123 S 124 SE 126 E 122]
{122}[North Edge][Northeast edge really.][W 121 SW 124 S 126]
{123}[Other Side][(Of the swamp.) You can go north, east or northeast.][N 120 NE 121 E 124]
{124}[Heart][(Of the swamp.) Paths lead off in all directions except southwest.][N 121 NE 122 E 126 SE 127 S 125 W 123 NW 120]
{125}[Gloomy Trail][In some ways the counterpart of the Dirty Trail to the north, it only leads in four directions simultaneously - northwest, north, east, northeast.][NW 123 N 124 NE 126 E 127]
{126}[Swampland][You are on the eastern edge of the swampland. A path leads back off to the east.][E 128 S 127 SW 125 W 124 NW 121 N 122]
{127}[South Edge][Southeast edge actually.][W 125 NW 124 N 126]
{128}[Path to Swamps][This path leads west to the swamps or east to a crossroads.][W 126 E 129]
{129}[Choice of Routes][You are faced with a choice of routes and can go north, south, east or west.][N 117 E 130 S 144 W 128]
{130}[Near Forest][This path leads east to the forest or west to a crossroads.][W 129 E 131]
{131}[Foot of Tree][You are at the foot of a huge fallen tree. Paths lead north and south into the forest and west out of it. A space to the east has been cleared by the tree as it fell.][N 132 E 137 S 143 W 130]

{181}[Ridge][This is a high ridge connecting lower ground to north and south. A vicious poisonous beetle jumps at you and tries to bite you but you are protected by hidden force-shield generators.][N 173 S 184]

{191}[At Door][This is a magic door which in the original Island Adventure required you to type SAY OPEN before it would open. There was no hint of this whatsoever in the text, mind you. Can you beat that for bad puzzle design? In revenge I have had it smashed to bits and used for firewood, so to the south gapes an empty doorway. A path leads north.][N 190 S 193]
{192}[Edge][Northwest corner, really.][S 195 SE 196 E 193]
{193}[Magic Land][What used to be magic about this enclosed area, which stretches away in all directions to south, east and west, was that the mapping was totally illogical and it was very difficult to find your way around. Beside the doorway to the north, however, is a Sub-Cyclic Normality Assert-i-Tron powered by a portable diesel generator, which keeps the spatial topology of this region in conformity with standard Euclidean geometry.][W 192 SW 195 S 196 SE 197 E 194 N 191]

{209}[Heart of Caves][You are at the centre of the cave system. The cavern extends westwards and there is a smaller chamber to the east.][E 210 S 212 SW 211 W 208 NW 206 N 207]
{210}[East Edge][You are in a small chamber set into the eastern edge of the main cavern.][W 209]
{211}[South Part}[This is the southwest corner of the large chamber.][N 208 NE 209 E 212]
{212}[Narrow Tunnel][You are at the southeast corner of the cavern at the entrance to a narrow tunnel.][W 211 NW 208 N 209 S 213]
{213}[Passage][You are walking through a narrow north-south passageway.][N 212 S 215]
{214}[Westside Chamber][A small chamber set into the western wall of the passage.][E 215]
{215}[Magic Door][You are at the end of the passage, in front of a magic door which is open to the south. Chambers lie to the east and west.][N 213 W 214 E 216 S 217]
