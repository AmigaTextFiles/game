@node Introduction
This program is designed for players of Chaosium's @{b}Call of Cthulhu@{ub} role-playing game (5th edition rules).  It allows quick and easy creation of Investigators and features a nice GUI and the ability to save, load and print Investigators.

@{b}ICS@{ub} will only let you change your Investigator in accordance with
the @{b}CoC@{ub} rules.  This means that statistics are generated randomly, and you are limited in the number of skill points you can assign to skills. Occupation skills are seperate from other skills and @{b}ICS@{ub} keeps track of how many points you can spend in each category.  The effects of age on EDU and other stats is taken into account, and even the "additional schooling" option is included.

All the 5th edition occupations and skills are included, and @{b}ICS@{ub} makes it easy to add totally new skills should they be needed.  Things like Damage Bonus, Hit Points, Luck etc.  are calculated for you and included on the print-out.  @{b}ICS@{ub} doesn't handle income, savings or equipment; these things must be dealt with afterwards.

The print-outs produced by @{b}ICS@{ub} give all the information about an Investigator in a way that makes it easy to transfer to a character sheet; you simply copy the details across (which are in roughly the same place on the print-out as they are on the 5th edition character sheet).  Just fill in the skills and the Investigator is almost ready to play.

@node UsingICS "Using ICS"
After starting @{b}ICS@{ub} from the Workbench or a Shell, its main window will appear.  The easiest way of explaining how to use @{b}ICS@{ub} is to walk-through the process of creating an Investigator, so here goes.

First, you need to generate a good set of statistics.  Click on the @{i}Statistics @{ui}button.  A window will appear, showing the Investigator's current statistics along with some related information.  Now select @{i}New @{ui}from the @{i}Project @{ui}menu.  The values will change to a newly-generated set.  Keep doing this until you get some you like.

Next, decide upon an age for your Investigator.  @{b}ICS@{ub} will not let you enter an age below the minimum (EDU+6 years).  The maximum age is 99, and don't forget that if you choose an age over 40, certain statistics will drop slightly due to ageing.  Entering an age now is important, because @{b}ICS@{ub} won't let you change it once you've chosen an occupation.

Now you can choose an occupation.  Click on the @{i}Occupation @{ui}button. A window will appear containing a list of occupations (these are as close as possible to the 5th edition @{b}CoC@{ub} ones).  Select an occupation.  A window will appear asking if the Investigator should take additional schooling (see the rules for details on this).  Note that this only happens when you @{i}first @{ui}choose an occupation.

If the occupation you chose allows you to choose other skills as personal specialities, another window will appear containing a list of skills, from which you can select one.  If you choose a skill such as @{i}Pilot @{ui}or @{i}Art@{ui}, another little window will appear asking you to enter the name of the skill speciality (such as @{i}Helicopter @{ui} for @{i}Pilot@{ui} or @{i}Ballroom Dancing @{ui} for @{i}Art@{ui}).  If you select @{i}Other @{ui}from the skills list, a window will appear asking you to enter the name of the new skill, along with its base value.

Once you've finished doing your occupation, you can start deciding where to put your skill points.  Click on the @{i}Skills @{ui}button in the main window.  A window will appear containing a list of your occupation's skills. You can select skills and adjust their values with the slider next to the list.  You will notice that the number in the top-left corner of the window changes when you move the slider.  This is the number of skill points you have left in the @{i}occupation @{ui}skills category.  If you click on the cycle gadget next to this, the list will change to show the other (non-occupational) skills your Investigator has (there aren't any at the moment).  Clicking on @{i}Add @{ui}will bring up the @{i}Select a Skill @{ui}window from which you can select one to add.  Skills can be deleted by selecting them and then clicking @{i}Delete@{ui}.  To clear the whole lot, click on @{i}Clear@{ui} (notice that the @{i}Add@{ui}, @{i}Delete @{ui} and @{i}Clear @{ui}buttons don't work with the @{i}occupation @{ui}skills list). All points allocated to skills deleted or cleared are returned to be used again.  If you want to reset all the skill values in the visible list to their base levels (i.e.  return all used skill points) but you don't want to actually delete the skills, click the @{i}Reset @{ui}button.

When you're happy with your Investigator's skills, you can add the finishing touches by entering his or her name, birthplace etc.  Finally, save the Investigator to disk with @{i}Save As...  @{ui}in the @{i}Project @{ui}menu. This means you can load them again (with @{i}Open...@{ui}) and alter the name, skill values, or even change their occupation.  At some point, you will probably want to print out what you've done, so you can copy the details on to a character sheet.  @{b}ICS@{ub} makes this easy; just select @{i}Print @{ui}from the @{i}Project @{ui}menu and your Investigator's details will be sent to the printer.  Occasionally, you may want to "print" to a file, so you can print it later or incorporate it into another document.  To do this, select @{i}Print As... @{ui}from the @{i}Project @{ui}menu, and a file-requester will appear asking you to choose a file to print to.

@node Problems
Here is a list of known problems/differences (not bugs):

	In the rules, certain occupations such as Professor allow one or more skills to be selected from a small list of related skills.  This is not implemented in @{b}ICS@{ub}; instead, skills must be picked from the whole range of skills.  If this bothers you, the only solution is to refer to the rules and choose only those skills that are listed in the occupation description.

	@{b}ICS@{ub} will not warn you if you choose a skill more than once. This includes choosing a personal interest skill that is already amongst your Investigator's occupation skills.  The only solution to this is to choose skills carefully.
