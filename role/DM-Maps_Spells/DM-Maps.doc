	I looked all over the net for Dungeon Master maps and
spells and couldn't find anything except *.gz (some IBM zip files).
I finally found these maps and spells on one of my old accounts
(I knew they were around somewhere).  I'm posting this because I
believe these maps should be on Aminet and you still see posts to 
Usenet asking for them all the time.

	All the .pics are actually .iff format -- 32 color, although
most of them only use 2 colors.  To understand my spell list, you still
need the manual.

Disclaimer:  I don't know where they came from, but I'm sure they're
PD since I found them on usenet a long time ago and because there are
lots of PD maps for Dungeon Master.  But if anyone know why they should
be taken off the net, then feel free to delete them.
