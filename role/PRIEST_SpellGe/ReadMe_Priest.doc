Hi to all,

I hope that all of you GameMasters out there will find this program
useful, for I know that I have spent hours generating Spellbooks for
Clerics, or Spellbooks of defeated Clerics.  Frankly, this is a side
task when dealing with setting up everything that is required to run
a game.

The Basic Program

I have included a nice icon to go with this program, along with a 16
color palette (it is Magic Workbench compatible).  The first thing the
program asks for is the name of the file which the spell list will be
written to.  Unless a complete path is provided, the file will be
written in the same directory where you place this program.  The
program then loads the spells.  It then asks you for the highest level
spells that you want, then the minimum number of spells per level,
then the maximum number of spells per level.  The spellbook is then
generated.  At the end of this, you are asked if you would like to
generate another spell list.  If you do not want another spell list,
just type in 'n' (without the quote marks of course), and the program
will end.  Otherwise, just type in 'y', and the process will repeat
again.

This program may run from from Workbench by clicking on it's icon, or
from the Cli by typing the name of the program.  In either case, it
opens it's own window.

To register this program costs $10.  For that, you get version 2,
which is an expanded version of this program.  It contains spells from
not only the Player's Handbook, but also from the Tome of Magic, and
other sources.  In addition, version 2 is the version I use
personally, so it may have spells in it that you do have access to. 
If you get some of these spells, either edit them out, or make up your
own descriptions.  Plus, version 2 will contain 10th level spells
(this also means TRUE Dweamors).  Sorry, but no spells above 10th for
you power-mongers out there.  Please make certain when registering
this program that you include your name, your address, and your email
address (if you have one).  Otherwise, I may not be able to get the
expanded version to you.

Plus, Quest spells are included in version 2, and are considered 11th
level spells, for the purpose of having the program generate them. 
That is, when asked for the highest level of spell, type in '11' if
you want the Priest to have Quest spells.

Any bugs, please let me know.  This program should work on any Amiga, if
it doesn't work on your machine, please let me know.

When I come out with version 3 (probably just more spells), I will
advertise it on Aminet.  Make sure to check out the Priest Spell
Generator as well.  Enjoy :)

*A special note
For a Priest to cast 9th+ level spells in my game,  I require that the
Priest in question has found some way to obtain a 19 wisdom, and
is 18th level.  Since quest spells read as 11th level spells to the
program, and are available to Priests of 10th level and up, ignore
spells generated of levels that are not usable by the Priest, edit
them out of the file.  Of course, these are only a suggestions.

Presently, I do not have a reliable email address, though I can send
email, I am not sure that I can attach files.
So, for now, here is my address:

Stephen Ray Meade
409 A North Martin Luther King Blvd.
Lexington, Kentucky  40508

Overseas registers make sure to add USA to the address.
Please do not send me personal checks.  Money orders are preferred.
