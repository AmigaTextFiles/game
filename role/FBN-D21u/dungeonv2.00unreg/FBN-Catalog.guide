@{b}Fly By Nite Videe-Oh!@{ub} began its life as a video production company
for my home movies.  The name stuck and I used it for all my subsequent
projects.

Over the years, quite a few @{"people" LINK "Team"} have played a part in the
FBN activities.

FBN began with my Commodore 64 computer and Movie Maker by Electronic Arts.
It has progressed to my Amiga computer using a large variety of programs.

The main players in the FBN world are @{"Garak" LINK "Garak"}, @{"Shape Shifter" LINK "SS"} and
@{"joe hick" LINK "joe"}.

I'm Giark (Guy-Ark).  I began FBN as a name for my movies and such like.
I've been making movies of one type or another for 19 years and have been
programming for 13 years.  You can contact me on @{"CyberSpace BBS" LINK "CyberSpace"} where,
as well as managing the FBN and @{"AMOS" LINK "Amos"} support areas, I am CoSys.

Garak joined the FBN team in 1994 and was the co-writer of @{"SoloTrek" LINK "Solotrek"}.
He is currently in his final year of high school and is working in a joint

What can I say about Shape Shifter?  He has been instrumental in the FBN
motion pictures, as well as a willing co-conspirator in the now infamous
Black September debacle.  (Not really.  I made that up.)  You might
recognize him from his role in the FBN Blockbuster @{"ScrollQuest" LINK "Scrollquest"}.
The MOD Winky Commander was written with SS in mind.

As the years progressed and technology became cheaper, FBN expanded into
the print market.  This made FBN a truly multimedia company (Print, Disk,
Video, Audio, etc.)

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Videos"
@NEXT "Star"
@PREV "Multimedia"
@TOC "Main"

FBN has been involved in many different productions over the years.  In the
early years, movie production was on 8mm film with no sound.  At that time,
the company went under the name of Leadstar Newt productions.  The best of
the LN films was the hilarious (in retrospect) copy of @{"Star Wars" LINK "Star"} that
contains the famous three pass kissing scene and the `Chewie wants a banana'
segment.

Among the video titles are the Sheridan family series, The Texas Instruments,
The Rhinos - Live! and Conestoga Homegrown.

Star Wars

Shot in silent 8mm format, this is one of the wierdest films that FBN has
been involved in to date.  Watch for the spinning christmas lights of the
hyperspace segment and the funky tartan blanket used for Darth Vader's
cloak.  No, that's not a lightsaber, it's a hockey stick!

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Texas"

@PREV "Star"

Out Of The Basement, Into The Attic: The Texas Instruments Reunion Concert

Another in the genre of `fake band rockumentaries' like `This Is Spinal Tap',
`The Ruttles' and others.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Scrollquest"
@NEXT "Rocket"
@PREV "Texas"
@TOC "Main"

Scrollquest marked FBN's entry into high tech production.  The entire musical
score was composed by me (Giark) and produced using the Amiga.  Another
member of the FBN team made his presence known in Scrollquest: The Master,
who plays Lex Farslayer.

ScrollQuest is the story of a group of young barbarians who must try to
recover the scroll of doom.

Cost: $15 Cdn.

Rocket Commandos is yet another technological leap for the FBN crew.  The
special effects are being produced using rendering technology which is also
used on tv shows and movies, such as Babylon 5, SeaQuest and Jurassic Park.

Rocket Commandos is currently on hold due to production difficulties and
other technical considerations.
