@node Installation "Installation"

Installation
------------

Installation of the Omega is rather easy. To launch omega you need to
copy provided libraries into LIBS: is you don't already have them in there.

  iff.library		Needed to load the graphics file. If it is
			not present, graphics cannot be used. Version 23
			is in the archive but you only need version 21.

  reqtools.library	If present, it is used for all requesters. If not,
			intuition.library is used instead.


Omega has been compiled to run on systems that run on m68020 or higher
CPU. Floating point unit is not needed.

Running Omega
-------------

To start Omega from the Workbench, double click on the icon, but before
you do that you should change the icon tooltypes into the ones you want
them to be. Following tooltypes are valid:

 · SAVEFILE/K	Selects the savefilename.
 · FONTNAME/K	Selects the fontname to use.
 · GRAPHICS/S	Use graphics or not.
 · NODELETE/S	Delete save file after loading or not.
 · SCREENREQ/S	Use screenmode requester to select a screenmode.

The original Unix version of Omega represents the Omega world using
ascii characters to indicate the area around the player, but this Amiga port
can optionally use graphics. These graphics are taken from Lars Haugseth's
excellent Amiga port of Angband but are enhanced by ones drawn by Sami
Kemilä. About half of the graphics are made by Sami and other half by James
Larimer, Thomas H. Davies and Torben Kristiansen.

Graphics are stored in file Omega.iff. If the file is faulty or is missing,
the normal ASCII characters are used instead. The file must reside in the
same directory than omega executable itself.

In-Game Menu
------------

When the game is running a "Project" menu is available, with two options:
"About", which shows a requester with information about Omega; and "Quit",
which immediately exits Omega. If the current game has not be saved it will
be lost.

History
-------

******************************************************************************

0.80.4 (14th Dec 1998)

Source changes:
---------------

- In some rare cases, Omega could just exit without a reason. This would
  mean that all resources would be left allocated. I tried to find all of
  the causes for these exits and replaced them with the cleanup routine that
  frees all the Omega has reserved. Omega can still exit without a notice,
  but this time all resources are freed on exit.

Game changes:
-------------

- You can select a screenmode now. Use argument or tooltype SCREENREQ
  which opens a screenmode requester. If requester fails or if it's not
  needed, the default screenmode is copied from default public screen.
- Other parameters have changed to this:
  · SF=SAVEFILE/K	Selects the savefilename.
  · FN=FONTNAME/K	Selects the fontname to use.
  · GFX=GRAPHICS/S	Use graphics or not.
  · NDEL=NODELETE/S	Delete save file after loading or not.
  · SC=SCREENREQ/S	Use screenmode requester to select a screenmode.

0.80.3 (by Jarkko Vatjus-Anttila)

Source changes:
---------------

- Recompiled with StormC 3
- Removed compiler warnings (about 600 of them)
   · Changed old style parameterlists into new style,
   · Removed unused and obsolete variables.
   · Used Linux header files to assist recompilation, because I didn't
     have some specific files that Omega required. 5 constants were not
     defined in my include files.
- Removed Amiga specific compiler errors.
- And finally recompiled for 020.

Game changes:
-------------

- Removed compression code because it didn't work with my 060. If I ever
  discover why it doesn't work, I'll adapt it in as an option. This version
  does not compress your savefiles.
- Changed the game graphics to ones drawn by Sami Kemilä. In my opinion
  they look much better than the original ones. However, use GFXFILE
  tooltype to change the graphics if you like to use your custom ones.
- You cannot bypass the hunger messages anymore and therefore you cannot
  accidentally die to starvation.
- All kinds of requesters accept now case sensitive replies. (ie. 'X' is
  the same as 'x')
- Tooltype and argument parser rewritten. The old one was *too* ancient and
  actually didn't work.
- Added a commandline parser. The following parameters as well as tooltypes
  are accepted:
   · SAVEFILE/K,	This is the name of your save game file.
   · FONTNAME/K,	This is the name of your fafourite 8x8-font.
   · GRAPHICS/S,	Use the graphics or not. (Default: No)
   · NODELETE/S,	Don't delete the savefile after loading. (Def: No)
