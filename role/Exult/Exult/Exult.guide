@node introduction "Introduction"

@{b}Introduction@{ub}

@{i}200 years have passed since your last visit to Britannia. You return as the
Avatar to arrive on a scene of gruesome murder. Could the new-founded
organization known as "The Fellowship" which gains more and more followers be
involved in it? And what about this demonic creature called The Guardian who
seems to have an eye on every step you tread ...@{ui}

I'm very happy to present you the Amiga port of Exult, the role-playing game
engine which allows you to play Ultima 7 datafiles. Ultima 7 with its epic
storyline and vast world is still popular despite its age.

I had an eye on the Exult project from the very moment I heard of it. What made
this port finally feasible was Gabriele Greco's superb AmigaSDL port. Still,
it wasn't easy to build Exult, but it's done now so here it is for your enjoyment.

So if you are a role-playing game fan like myself and are tired of waiting for
Dafel: Bloodline, then put on the Avatar dress and step out onto the dusty and
dangerous roads of Britannia once more. Meet your old friends from Ultima 6, but
beware ... there's a foe. And he's strong. And he watches your every step ...

@node required "System Requirements"

@{b}System Requirements@{ub}

In order to run Exult, you must have ...

   · a 68020 processor or better with FPU
   · AmigaOS 3.0 or later
   · a graphics card
   · CyberGraphX or Picasso96 with CGX emulation library installed

Optional are ...

   · AHI for sound effects
   · AMidi for MIDI music
   · OS3.5 or later for easier configuration

You'll also need the original Ultima 7 data files. Please notice that the
files in the Ultima 7 disk version are severely compressed, and you will
need to install the game under MS-DOS first before you can access the
required files. Alternately, the "Ultima Collection" CD-ROM contains the
unpacked game files.

Both the original "Black Gate" as well as the "Serpent Isle" add-on are
supported.

@endnode

@node installation "Installation"

@{b}Installation@{ub}

To install, copy the entire STATIC drawer of the original Ultima 7 game into
the empty BlackGate directory you'll find in the Exult directory after unpacking
the archive (note: copy the @{i}drawer@{ui} itself, not just the contents of the
drawer!).

If you own the add-on "Serpent Isle", copy its STATIC drawer into the SerpentIsle
directory.

If you downloaded the digital sound effects as well, please put the into the data
directory.

Basically, you can put the directories anywhere you like to, but then you'll have
to tell the game where to find them (see @{"Configuration" link configuration}.

@endnode

@node configuration "Configuration"

@{b}Configuration@{ub}

When you start the game, you have the chance to access the Setup screen where
you will be able to change some basic settings.

@{b}AmigaOS 3.1 and earlier@{ub}
If you want to change more settings or set some paths you have to edit the Exult.cfg
file in the Exult directory. See @{"part 3" link faq3} of the @{"FAQ" link faq} for
more information about doing this.

@{b}AmigaOS 3.5 and later@{ub}
If you double-click on the @{i}ExultPrefs@{ui} icon, the Amiga configuration
program will be loaded. This is currently still in beta, but it should work fine
already.

At the bottom of the window, you'll find three buttons:

@{i}Save & Launch@{ui} - saves the current configuration and starts Exult
@{i}Save@{ui}          - saves the current configuration and exits to Workbench
@{i}Cancel@{ui}        - exits to Workbench without saving the configuration

Click on the tabs to access the configuration pages. Currently there are ...

@{u}Games@{uu}
  Allows you to change the paths of the games to run with Exult. Currently, there are
  two subpages: Black Gate and Serpent Isle. Each presents you the following options:

  @{i}Data Path@{ui}   - set to the directory that contains the game's STATIC drawer
  @{i}SoundFX File@{ui}- the .flx file holding the sound effects. This file is not
                included in the distribution and must be downloaded from my
                or the Exult homepage seperately. There are different sound
                files for Black Gate and Serpent Isle.
  @{i}Keybindings@{ui} - the file with your custom keybindings. To switch back to the
                default keybindings, click the "Default" button next to it. See
                question 4.1 in the @{"FAQ" link faq4} for information on how to write your own
                keybindings.

@{u}Video@{uu}
  Settings for display and scaling.

  @{i}Resolution@{ui}  - the dimension of the game window. 320x200 is the original,
                but you can set it to anything you like. The chooser gadget gives you
                two preset resolutions (320x200 and 640x400); if you set it to "Other",
                you can enter your preferred resolution in the Width and Height gadgets
                next to it.
  @{i}Width@{ui}       - display width if Resolution is set to "Other".
  @{i}Height@{ui}      - display height if Resolution is set to "Other".
  @{i}Fullscreen@{ui}  - if checked, the game will open its own custom screen.
  @{i}No Fades@{ui}    - some screens are faded in and out. This option suppresses
                this fading.
  @{i}Enable Upscaling@{ui} - scales the original graphics to twice their size. Please
                note that the screen size will be doubled if you select this, so if
                you selected 640x400, then a 1280x800 window will be opened! There are
                several scaling strategies implemented. Display quality and speed decreases
                will depend on the chosen strategy.
  @{i}Scale Method@{ui} - here you can choose a scaling strategy. The best ones are
                probably SuperEagle and 2xSaI, but they're also very slow.
  @{i}Gamma Correction@{ui} - you can set gamma correction here, usually you won't
                need this.

@{u}Audio@{uu}
  @{i}Enable All Audio@{ui} - turns on all audio globally.
  @{i}Enable SFX@{ui}  - turns on sound effects. Note that you must have the sound
                pack installed which can be downloaded from my or the Exult
                homepage. Is always turned on if "all audio" is checked.
  @{i}Enable Speech@{ui}- turns on speech. Is always turned on if "all audio" is checked.
  @{i}Enable MIDI@{ui} - turns on MIDI. MIDI will only play if you have AMidi installed.
  @{i}AMidi Unit@{ui} - select the AMidi unit on which you'd like to play the music.

@{u}Gameplay@{uu}
  @{i}Skip Intro@{ui}  - skips the game intro that appears when you start a new game.
                It's recommended you watch it at least once.
  @{i}Skip Splash@{ui} - if selected, the Ultima 7 title screen and the intro will
                not appear and you will be taken directly to the game menu.
  @{i}Allow Cheats@{ui}- enable cheats. More information on cheats can be found
                in the @{"FAQ" link faq4}

@{u}Debug@{uu}
  @{i}Usecode@{ui}     - enables usecode debugging output. This should always be turned
                off since ordinary players won't give a damn about it.

@node notes "Amiga Notes"

@{b}Amiga Notes@{ub}

@{i}Changed Keybindings:@{ui}

Those who have played Exult on other systems should be made aware that two
keybindings have been changed on the Amiga: you center the map with <Delete>
instead of <Home>, and the alternate Serpent Isle intro can be viewed using
Shift-F10 instead of F11.

@{i}Speed:@{ui}

The default configuration I provide with the Amiga version has been optimized
for slow Amigas - which does not mean it must necessarily run fast (although
it does here on my 060/50; I haven't tried with slower processors). It uses
the original Ultima 7 resolution of 320x200 pixels without scaling.

Owners of faster Amigas might want to try running the game in 640x400 resolution.
There is a scaling engine with various scaling strategies built into Exult.
Some are faster, some are slower but provide higher quality. You may want to
try several and see how they affect speed.

@{i}Cheats:@{ui}

In the default Amiga configuration, cheats are turned off.

@endnode

@node source "Sourcecode"

@{b}Sourcecode@{ub}

  The general source code is available from the Exult sourceforge page at
  http://exult.sourceforge.net. As of this writing, the changes for the
  Amiga version have not been integrated into this source tree, though.
  I have contacted project leader Jeff Freedman, and he was very positive
  about merging the Amiga changes into the main CVS tree, but I haven't
  heard from him anymore since then. I'll keep working on it.

       GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
          Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

       Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.


       GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)


These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.


  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.


  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

       NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS


       How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

@node faq1 "Frequent Questions: Introduction"

@{b}Frequent Questions Part 1: Introduction@{ub}

@{b}1.1. What is Exult?@{ub}
Ultima 7, an RPG from the early 1990's, still has a huge following. But, being a DOS game with
a very non-standard memory manager, it is difficult to run it on the latest computers. Exult is
a project to create an Ultima 7 game engine that runs on modern operating systems, capable of
using the data and graphics files that come with the game.

Exult is being developed in C++ under Linux, MacOS and Windows using the SDL library to make
porting to other platforms relatively easy. The current version supports much of the game's plot,
allowing you to talk to NPCs, use items, solve quests, and even fight monsters. Music, speech,
and the full introduction are also implemented. This, and further development, is only possible
due to the work done by other fans who have decoded the various Ultima 7 data files, especially
Gary Thompson, Maxim Shatskih, Jakob Shonberg, and Wouter Dijkslag.

Exult aims to let those people who own Ultima 7 (copyright 1993) play the game on modern hardware,
in as close to (or perhaps even surpassing) its original splendor as is possible. You need to own
"Ultima 7: The Black Gate" in order to use Exult, and we encourage you to buy a legal copy.


@{b}1.2. Why is it called Exult - what is the meaning of this name?@{ub}
Jeff wrote on the Boards:
I originally wrote it [Exult] solely for X-windows, so that's where the 'X' comes from. The "ult",
of course, comes from Ultima. It was only about 6 months ago [02/29/2000] that I replaced the
X code with SDL, which is multiplatform. Then Arthuris ported it to Win32 (and to BeOS). He had
also ported the earlier version, but it was much harder to maintain that way.

Ibrahim Holtzmann:
I'd like to point out that "exult" is also an English verb that means "to rejoice, to exhibit
great happiness".


@{b}1.3. Is Exult free ?@{ub}
Exult is more than free: it's Free (notice the caps). Exult is released under the GNU GPL (General
Public License). This means that the source code for Exult is freely available and you can do
whatever you want with it. However, if you make modifications to any of Exult's components and
publicly redistribute your work you are required to make the source freely available in turn.
Obviously the Exult team would be very grateful if any modifications you make are contributed back
to the main code, so that everyone can benefit from them. If you want to work on Exult just send
an e-mail to the team. More information on the GNU GPL at http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html.


@{b}1.4. Does Origin support Exult?@{ub}
First of all, Origin has been owned by EA for a long time now and from recent developements it
seems that Origin only exists now to maintain Ultima Online. Furthermore, Origin and/or people
that worked for Origin claim that the source code for Ultima 7 (BG/SI) has been lost for some
time. So there is no chance for the Exult team to have a look at the actual code.

Also the team tried to contact some people from Origin earlier but got no positive or negative
response on the Exult project. So far it seems that both Origin and EA have decided to ignore Exult.


@{b}1.5. Will Exult support other Ultimas?@{ub}
Exult supports only Ultima 7 (BG/SI and the add-ons). It will never support any other Ultima nor
do members of the team plan to develop something similar. The reasons for this are that no other
Ultima is similar to Ultima 7 in the internal workings and also the team is quite sick of
reverse engineering a game already.


@{b}1.6. Where do I find Exult?@{ub}
The latest official version is found on http://exult.sourceforge.net/
Daily snapshots of the Win32 binary and of the CVS source tree can be found at
http://exult.on.openave.net/


@{b}1.7. What is a snapshot? Are these screen shots or what?@{ub}
The snapshot is the newest source code of the program. It is updated almost daily, sometimes twice
a day. There is information on how to build your own binary of the source but there is also the
newest pre-compiled Windows binary.


@{b}1.8. How do I compile a source code snapshot under Linux?@{ub}
Install the latest version of SDL (http://www.libsdl.org)
Extract the Exult source code archive to ~/exult:
unzip exult.zip -d ~
Create a fresh install of U7. I'll assume that you've installed U7 in ~/ultima7
Run autogen.sh to create a configure script, then compile Exult:
cd ~/exult; chmod u+x autogen.sh; ./autogen.sh; ./configure; make
Install Exult and the Exult data file:
cp exult ~/ultima7; mkdir ~/ultima7/data; cp ./data/exult.flx ~/ultima7/data
Run Exult:
cd ~/ultima7; ./exult


@{b}1.9. How do I compile a source code snapshot under Win 9x?@{ub}
The source code snapshots contain a file called "README.win32" that explains everything.


@{b}1.10. What is the latest version of Exult?@{ub}
The current official release is V0.93 Alpha4. See also 1.6. to learn where to get the latest
version.

To find out which version you are running, press 'v' while in game.


@{b}1.11. On what platform does Exult run?@{ub}
Exult should be able to be compiled (with minor modifications) on any platform that SDL
supports. Right now the source can be compiled in Linux/i386, Linux/Alpha, MacOS, OpenBSD,
FreeBSD, Solaris, BeOS and Win32 (Windows 9x/ME/NT/2000).

@node faq2 "Frequent Questions: Exult and Ultima 7"

@{b}Frequent Questions Part 2: Exult and Ultima 7@{ub}

@{b}2.1. Do I need Ultima 7?@{ub}
Yes. Exult won't work without the original files.


@{b}2.2. Does Exult work on all versions of the game?@{ub}
It seems to run most of the available versions of the game. The most common ones nowadays
with the included Add-Ons (Forge of Virtue and Silver Seed) runs for sure.

However there are reported problems with the localized versions of the game (French,
German and Spanish). Conversation threads don't seem to skip to the next line in the proper
places and therefore are unreadable in some cases. SI was only published in English so no
localization problems with that one.

V0.91 Alpha2 adds fixes for the french version, which should work now. No work has been
done for the german version, due to lack of testers. If you have the German or Spanish
version, and want it to run, contact us.


@{b}2.3. How about Serpent Isle?@{ub}
The team is working on it. It is not yet fully playable but you can walk around, talk to
some people, finish some quests... Plotwise you will get quite far but you certainly won't
be able to play through it yet.

Old quotes on this topic from the time when SI wasn't playable at all in Exult.

Colourless:
I can't say much about the what will happen except that a completely working Serpent Isle
will be an annoying task to complete. It is close to BG in some ways, but very different
in others.

Jeff:
My feelings about SI are the same as Colourless, who has done all the work so far on it.
I'd much prefer to add enhancements to BG (which would apply to SI as well), and perhaps
write a new RPG. Now, if EA would provide us with information about SI's internals, that
would change things. And also, since Exult is open-source, it would be fine if anyone
wants to volunteer to work on SI.


@{b}2.4. Do the Add-Ons work?@{ub}
"Forge of Virtue" (Add-On to Black Gate) is supported. Even though SI is not yet fully
running the same holds true for "The Silver Seed".


@{b}2.5. Can you play through U7 yet?@{ub}
You can play through the Black Gate/Forge of Virtue without cheating and plotholes.
SI is partially playable since V0.91 Alpha2.


@{b}2.6. Do savegames from the original work in Exult?@{ub}
Savegames that were made with the original Ultima 7 or U7Run don't work with Exult. You
have to start a new game when you begin playing with Exult. Sorry!


@{b}2.7. Where do I find Ultima 7 on the net to download?@{ub}
Don't! You may be able to find it on the net but it would be pirating the game and the Exult
team doesn't support pirates. Look for the Ultima Collection in stores or on Ebay
(http://www.ebay.com).

Don't ask the team for copies.

@{b}Frequent Questions Part 3: Configurations, Resolution, Music@{ub}

@{b}3.1. What is it with the exult.cfg file?@{ub}
Most of the switches in the exult.cfg file are now handled via "Setup" when you start
up Exult. For further understanding read the following descriptions.

From the ReadMe:
The file uses a simple hierarchical XML-like syntax, which should be simple to understand
and modify. Take care though. Handling of syntax errors in this file is not well tested.
Exult will create this file for you, with some sensible defaults, and you can then edit
it to suit your preferences.

Okay, the default file looks like this (do not copy the **and following - these are my
remarks).

   </video>
</config>


@{b}3.2. What do I have to change in the Path-Settings?@{ub}
You have two choices on how to setup Exult.

The first one is very easy, just extract all the files from the compiled snapshot archive to
the directory where you have The Black Gate or Serpent Isle installed. Concerning the paths
you don't have to configure anything.

The other is a little more complicated but appeals to control freaks like me:
Make a directory c:\ultima7
make two subfolders named "blackgate" and "serpentisle" (without the quotes of course)
Extract or install the two Ultima 7 games into the appropiate folder ("The Black Gate" to
c:\ultima7\blackgate and "Serpent Isle" to c:\ultima7\serpentisle)
Extract the compiled Exult to c:\ultima7
Now you have to edit the exult.cfg file like this:

<disk>
<data_path>
data
</data_path>
<game>
<blackgate>
<path>
./blackgate
</path>
<title>
blackgate
</title>
</blackgate>
<serpentisle>
<path>
./serpentisle
</path>
</serpentisle>
</game>
</disk>

You can either use the relative (./blackgate) or absolute (c:\ultima\blackgate) path to point to
the correct directory.

Word of advice: Don't copy the files from the one game into the directory of the other.


@{b}3.3. Do music and sound effects play?@{ub}
Yes. Music plays via MIDI and sounds quite like the original. Sound effects either play
via digital (.wav) sfx. Even speech is supported. You can change the way the music and
the sound effects play via the setup menu or the exult.cfg file.


@{b}3.4. How do I enable Exult to play digital wave sfx?@{ub}
You have to set a path to the sfx pack in the waves settings in exult.cfg (see 3.1.). You
have to download seperate packs for each game as order of the sfx in BG and SI varies a
bit and otherwise will sound odd. However there is a little issue with sfx playback in SI
(see 6.2.).

Note that configuring your soundfonts is not needed for digital wave sfx.

The sfx pack made by Joseph Morris can be found at http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/exult/jmsfx.zip
(~4.55 MB) for "The Black Gate" and http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/exult/jmsfxsi.zip (~6.01 MB)
for "Serpent Isle". He recorded the original 114 sfx used in Black Gate which must have been a lot
of work. If your soundcard doesn't support soundfonts this pack is a "must-have". Enjoy!


@{b}3.5. How to turn off audio?@{ub}
Press 'Esc' to turn on/off Music, Speech and SoundFX or change the settings in exult.cfg - see 3.1..


@{b}3.6. What does the Scale option mean?@{ub}
By default Exult runs at 320x200 (which is the resolution the original Ultima VII used). Exult
uses different scaling engines to double the size to 640x400 and increase the quality of the
graphics. More information on the excellent scaling engine by Derek Liauw is available at
http://members.xoom.com/derek_liauw/. The scalers also work with higher resolutions. To change
the scaling method either use the Exult menu or change your exult.cfg - see 3.1.. "2xSaI" is
the new scaler, "bilinear" is the old one, "point" duplicates the pixels, "interlaced" is the
same as "point" except misses every other line, "SuperEagle" is another scaler by Derek
(the author of 2xSaI). Try them out to see how they look and which you like best.

Your screen should be set to 16-bit color mode.

Within the game you can use the 'Alt +' and 'Alt -' to switch resolution. The game will save
the last selected mode and reuse it the next time you run Exult.

See 6.2. for issues with scalers and resolutions.


@{b}3.7. Is Exult case sensitive?@{ub}
Case sensitiveness is a slight problem with Exult when you are not using the Windows port.
Exult tries lower and uppercase versions, and reports the error after trying the last (ie.
uppercase) filename. If the "static" directory and the files within are uppercase you might
run into problems. Better make sure that all these are lowercase. When unzipping the Ultima
files from a zip in Linux you can set it to extract in lowercase with the "-L" switch (e.g.
'unzip -L ultima7.zip'). This is fixed in the latest release.

@{b}Frequent Questions Part 4: Keyboard Commands, Miscellaneous@{ub}

@{b}4.1. What are the keys used in Exult?@{ub}
Starting with V0.91 Alpha2 all key commands can be changed. However, there is a default
setting which closely follows the original with the addition of some improvements.

To change your key bindings first edit the file defaultkeys.txt in your Exult directory,
change the bindings and save the file (e.g. as my_keys.txt). Now you have to change
exult.cfg to use that file. You can even choose if you want to change your key bindings
for BG or SI. See the keys settings at 3.1.. Change (default) to my_keys.txt.

During the game press 'h' to see a help screen with all the keys (for MacOS change Alt for
Cmd - the in-game help screen shows the correct key combination for MacOS).

@{b}4.3. Do the various cheat rooms work?@{ub}
Yes.


@{b}4.4. Where Do I find them@{ub}
Just keep on looking for them :-)


@{b}4.5. Do the carriages, ships and the magic carpet work?@{ub}
Yes. The sail of ships look odd sometimes but otherwise these means of transportations
work quite well.


@{b}4.6. Why is the party formation different?@{ub}
In Exult the party (the Avatar and his companions) move quite differently than they do
in the original. This is actually not a bug but a disliking of the old style.

Jeff:
It's not a bug, it's a feature! I like it that way. Everyone is sensitive to different
things, and I always though the formation-walking in the original U7 looked really
stupid. Eventually, someone may add the original type of walking to Exult, probably as
an option.


@{b}4.7. Serpent Isle had many more improvements over Black Gate (keyring, better
     paperdoll...). Will these be implemented?@{ub}
Right now the main goal is to get the Black Gate 100% working. After that it could be
that some more things will be improved as far as it is possible to implement these.

The keyring is not in Black Gate but there is the 'k' key which tries all the keys in
the inventory to open a lock.

Recently Ryan added paperdoll support in Black Gate. Though it is still buggy (some
items disappear to Neverneverland) it is beautiful to look at. Very impressive. For
this you need to have Serpent Isle installed on your hard drive and you must set the
path to it in exult.cfg (see 3.2.). If an item seems to have disappeared press 'F2' to
activate the cheat menu and disable Paperdolls. Now you should find that missing item
in your inventory.


@{b}4.8. Any other improvements/features?@{ub}
Since the Alpha 4 release a new game menu was added with an improved sound settings
box and a very much improved (awesome) savegame box. This allows you much more
savegames than the original (you should run out of disc space before you run out of
savegame slots), shows a screenshot of the location you saved at, the members of your
party, your stats, game time and the date you actually saved. The game menu is opened
via 'Esc' and the save game box is opened either via the game menu or the 's' key.

In Exult, you can still move your party even if there is a box/body/stats open/on. In
the original, the world was kind of frozen. Now it is only frozen if you hit the 't'
or 's' key.


@{b}4.9. How do I disable all improvements?@{ub}
To get an Ultima 7 that looks and behaves as close to the original as possible there
are several things to do (though I wonder why you'd want to do that):

make custom keybindings files (see 4.1.) in which you disable all the keys that were
not in the original for Black Gate and Serpents Isle. Since the Alpha 4 release you
have to assign 's' to old_file_gump to enable the old savegame menu (the line in your
custom keybindings file should look like: S old_file_gump)
Edit the exult.cfg file to point to those custom keys.
Don't set the path to the Serpent Isle files (see 3.2.) and put SI and a second copy
of Exult in a seperate directory (note: you can no longer launch both BG and SI from
the same exult.exe). This disables SI paperdolls in BG.
Alternatively you can leave the cheat menu binding in the keybindings file ( 'F2' )
and disable "Paperdolls" each time you run Exult.
Edit the exult.cfg to use the resolution of 320x200, to run in full screen and disable
scalers.
The disc icon in the Avatar paperdoll opens the new game menu. As of now this cannot
be altered. Sorry!


@{b}4.10. I heard that Exult is meant to be a game engine. Can I make my own game with Exult?@{ub}
Work has begun on "Exult Studio" which is aimed to be an editor for all kinds of files
that are used by Ultima 7. As of now there is already a Gimp plug-in to edit shapes.

For much more information "Exult Studio" see @{"5. Exult Studio" link faq5}.

Jeff:
As for the future, my main plan is to add editing capabilities, with the long-range
goal of writing an original RPG.

@{b}Frequent Questions Part 5: Exult Studio@{ub}

@{b}5.1. What is it?@{ub}
Exult Studio is a map-editor for Exult, allowing you to modify the map of a game and,
eventually, to create a completely new landscape for a new game.


@{b}5.2. Who came up with the cool name?@{ub}
Tristan


@{b}5.3. What do you need to run it?@{ub}
Currently, you need to be running Exult on X (Linux, Unix, etc.), with Exult set to run
in a window (not fullscreen). You also need the GTK+ library installed.


@{b}5.4. When will it be ported to other platforms?@{ub}
That depends on when someone volunteers to do the work :-) There are three issues:

GTK has to be ported to the platform. I think this is already true for Win32.
Exult Studio uses sockets to communicate with Exult. This also shouldn't be a problem
for Win32. X drag-n-drop is used to put new objects on the landscape. The 'drop' part
of this will have to be rewritten for Win32 Exult, OR, drag-n-drop could be an
enhancement to SDL someday.


@{b}5.5. How do you run it?@{ub}
You can run Exult Studio all by itself, but it isn't useful that way, as it uses Exult
as a server. What you really want to do is:

Put 'exult_studio.glade' in the Exult 'data' directory.
Be sure 'exult_studio' is in your path.
Run Exult.
Press 'alt-ctrl-m' to go into 'map-editor' mode. If all is set up correctly, exult_studio
will start up, and will have a list of files on the left side of its window.
You can also start up one or the other separately, and they'll reconnect:

If Exult isn't running, start it up. Then, in Exult Studio, use the 'File' menu to
choose the static directory (for the game you're playing).
If Exult Studio isn't running start it up with: exult_studio -x (path to dir containing
exult_studio.glade) -d (path to game directory)


@{b}5.6. What can you do at the moment?@{ub}
You can browse shapes in the main window.
You can drag a shape from the shape browser to Exult, and that object will be placed in
the game. (Note: Not all such objects are saved with the game yet; saving things like
buildings will be implemented soon.)
You can edit an 'egg' by double-clicking on it. An edit box should appear.
You can create a new 'egg' using the pull-down menu in Exult Studio. In the Egg edit box,
after you hit 'Apply', you'll be prompted to click in Exult where you want the egg to appear.
If editing a 'monster' egg, you can set the monster by dragging the shape from the
browser to the area that displays the monster.


@{b}5.7. What's next?@{ub}
The next things to be implemented are:

An NPC editor, similar to the one for Eggs (but with lots more stuff to set).
A simple object editor, that lets you modify an object's 'quality', 'quantity' and flags.
A 'save-map' function in Exult to save the whole map (not just the moveable objects that
'save-game' stores).


@{b}5.8. What's with this client/server stuff?@{ub}
A map-editor needs to provide the ability to display the game, place objects on the map,
and move objects around. That functionality is already in Exult, and it makes sense to
reuse it. So we could have made Exult a part of Exult Studio. However, Exult is already
a huge program, and is getting unwieldy to work on.

With this architecture, Exult Studio can have all the messy code for displaying/editing
dialog boxes, while Exult only needs a little bit of work to handle requests.

Also, I (Jeff) wanted to get a little experience programming with sockets:-)

@{b}Frequent Questions Part 6: Bugs, known issues, and not yet implemented features@{ub}

@{b}6.1. Bugs@{ub}
To see a list of open bugs and bugreports go to http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=2335


@{b}6.2. Known Issues@{ub}
Movement is sometimes jerky or slow.
We don't know what all the data in 'weapons.dat' and 'ammo.dat' means, so hit points
and damage don't work as well as in the original game. Sound effects in SI are sometimes
odd with the wave pack as some sounds were coded in Exult to correspond to the sfx
number in BG. This is a bug and will be addressed in due time.

In Fellowship meetings some NPCs appear not to attend these though they should and
sometimes even speak there. This is due to a bug in Exult which makes NPCs sit on
already taken seats and only the top most NPC can be seen. Moving the top most via
Hackmover makes the others visible.

If you run a resolution higher than the original (320x200) some NPCs that are further
away from the Avatar may seem to disappear and reappear when you get away or closer to them.

With scalers enabled you might encounter slow downs of the game. The team is working
on this right now and it is already a lot faster.

The speech in the intro is out of synch with the lips animations. But now it matches
the speed of the text.

There are reported problems with digital sound effects or speech when using Vortex series
sound cards under Win9x/ME. It's not sure if this is a driver or Exult issue.


@{b}6.3. Not yet implemented@{ub}
A few magic spells don't work yet.
