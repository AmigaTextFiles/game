 "The Seven Realms of A'Teth," my first full game for the Amiga. It is
written in Blitz Basic2.1, and was begun in March 1996 and was completed
at the end of March 1997. By registering with me and showing your support
for both the Amiga and for independent game writers, you will ensure that
I will develop my knowledge of programming and will certainly work on
other projects for the Amiga. Please see the document 'registration' for
details.

   This, the full version of the game, has been released as public domain on
the first anniversary of the date of its completion. It is far from a
polished product, but as I have said, it has been my first game for the
Amiga. My second game, "Time Campaign," will be finished shortly, and
represents a major step forward for me. I already have many future titles
planned, taking advantage of new amiga hardware as it becomes available.

   The game involves travelling around the game world, entering cities, and
talking to the inhabitants, to find out information about your quest. On
your way around, you will have to fight the evil enemies which have taken up
residence in your home realm.

   The concept of the game was to write a simple RPG. There are no thousands
of useless objects, and no complex fight system. The aim was to create a
simple RPG which people other than experienced RPG fans could enjoy.

   There are full instructions available from the game menu.


    History.
    ~~~~~~~~

    v1. - My mate has this brilliant idea that I should try to write
          this game. - so I write a basic mapscroller, with the ability
          to go into other maps (i.e. towns)

    v1.1 Wrote a text output routine to tell you what was happening to
         you as you moved around the level.

    v1.2 Really naff monsters added + a wholly unsatisfactory fight
         routine.

    v1.3 Fight routine stripped and re-written + decent monsters added

         characters + dialogue with houses added

    7Realms is, to the best of my knowledge, an entirely safe program. It
has been throroughly tested on a standard Amiga 1200 with Hard-drive. I
