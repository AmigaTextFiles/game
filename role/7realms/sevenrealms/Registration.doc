~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you enjoy playing this game, then I would appreciate a small cash
donation, to reimburse the time and effort that goes into game production
for public domain, and as a sign that there are users out to develop for.
   I suggest a donation of £3-4, and it should be a cheque/PO only (no cash)
made payable to Christopher Jarvis at this address:

   15, Loughton Way
   Buckhurst Hill
   Essex
   IG9 6AE

   I would also appreciate comments on this game, even if you do not wish to
send any money. You can either write to me at the above address, or e-mail
me at c.j.r.jarvis@wkac.ac.uk
