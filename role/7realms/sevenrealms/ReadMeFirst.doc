Running "The Seven Realms of A'Teth"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 In order to run 7Realms, you need to make sure the directory SevenRealms:
is assign to the game directory (i.e. BLAH:Blah/SevenRealms/). This will be
done for you if you click on the Assign-Me! icon before running the game.
Alternatively, if you are an experience w/b user, then you can add the
assign to your startup-sequence.
   Contact me if you want a version which runs from floppy disk.
