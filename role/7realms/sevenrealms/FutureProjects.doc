Future Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I am already working on a first-person perspective shoot-em-up, but I would
appreciate some comments from you on what projects you would like to see on
the amiga.
   See the document marked 'Registration' for my snail-mail address or
e-mail me with your comments on c.j.r.jarvis@wkac.ac.uk
   Here are the game styles I would like to work on, but if you have another
suggestion, please feel free to send it to me.
   Also visit my Webpage at http://www/geocities.com/TimesSquare/Arena/1829/
for details on my latest projects.

   Planned projects:

   Hi-spec Flaskback/Abe's Odyssey style game
   Arcade/Adventure RPG
   Point and click adventure
   Space battle/Trading Game
   Simple 3d adventure game in TombRaider vein.

   Please bear in mind that I am not able to do full-on
texture-mapping/gourardshading and stuff, although if anyone out there has
the ability to create such code, I would be more than happy to collaborate
on future game projects.
