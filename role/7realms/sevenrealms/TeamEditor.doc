   Using the 7Realms Custom Team Designer
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   This utility will allow you to create a custom team for use in the game.
To load a custom team into 7Realms, select "Start New Game", followed by
"Custom List." Type in the name of a previously created custom team, and if
the computer finds it in SevenRealms:data/ (disk one if you are using
floppy) it will load the custom team. There is one on the disk for you to
try called "xmas" already on disk one.

   Load up the team editor program. All control is via the keyboard, except
for one part which I will come onto shortly.

- Select "C)reate new team".
      you will be prompted to choose the icon which will represent that
      character in the game. You can scroll the box around the collection of
      faces at the bottom of the screen, either using the arrow keys or
      joystick. When you have found a picture you like for this character,
      press RETURN or FIRE to select.

      You will then be asked for a name for that character. Type in a name
      for that character up to 7 letters. The only symbols the game will
      admit are "-" and "'" - so plenty of Bab5-type names are advised. The
      game will then ask you to verify the name.

      Then you must select a class for the character:

         Fighter - average skill/strength - no magic - good all-rounder
         Hunter - low skill/high strength - does lots of damage but has low
                skill - good weapons available - no magic
         Mage - average skill/low strength - starts magic level 2
         Thief - High Skill/Average strength - good fighters but it takes a
                while to reduce an enemy's strength
         Sprite - High Skill/low strength - starts magic level 1 - has
                thief's skill advantage combined with magic ability

      The computer will then roll some random statistics for the character -
      you can keep rerolling the stats until you are happy. Remember that
      the higher the skill, the lower the strength - otherwise it would be
      too easy!

      This will be repeated four times, to complete the team, then you will
      be asked if you want to save the team. If you select "yes," you will
      be promted for a name for the team, which must not be an existing team.
      This is the name you must type in on the character selection screen.
      If you select "no", the team will be cleared and you will be returned
      the menu.

- Select Edit Existing Team

      Type in the name of a previously existing team, and you will be able to
      change their details. Once this is done, you can save, but you must
      use a different name. If you want to edit the team "Scum" and still
      call it "Scum" you must save as something like "ScumB" and change the
      filename in either W/B or Shell.

- Select Load Faces

      if you want to load in a different set of face icons for your
      characters, then this will enable you to load in an ILBM picture (Lores
      320x256 - 32 colours) containing the faces. The faces must be in the
      top left-hand corner of the picture. The faces must be 16*16 pixels,
      and you can have up to thirty faces on a picture, in the format 10*3.
      The picture must be in "SevenRealms:Graphics/" (disk two) and must
      only have a name up to 7 characters long. There is already an extra
      batch of faces on a file called "FACEPIC". You can use this in the
      TeamEditor or load it into your favourite paint program. Your picture
      must use the game palette, which you can find in
      "SevenRealms:graphics/".

- Select Quit

      Bye bye...



      About the custom teams
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   I declare all custom teams created for "The Seven Realms of A'Teth"
public domain and may be shared, copied and uploaded to Aminet or whereever.
I will also upload and distribute to registrees (by the method detailed in
the 7Realms.doc on disk one) teams from time to time. No-one is allowed to
sell or make profit from custom teams, and may only charge for the price of
postage and disk costs. I take no responsibility for custom teams created
by other users of this game.

      enjoy
