  CharGen is a character-generation program that lightens the workload
of the Dungeon Master in the roleplaying game >Advanced Dungeons &
Dragons< (also known as AD&D) from TSR Inc.

  If you have no prior knowlegde of AD&D, the program will _not_ be of
any great use to you. The program does _NOT_ replace any puplished
material from TSR, i.e. you cannot learn the game from this program,
nor can you learn the spells contained in the different source books
from this program.

  CharGen is FreeWare :-)

@Prev "Introducing"
@Next "Package"

  Be sure the settings in the Settings menu corresponds to the rules
you use in your game, as this can influence the way certain rules are
applied. If you cannot recreate a character from your game, check the
menu items in the Settings menu.

  Do not use the '@' character, as this is used to embed printer
escape sequences in your character sheet. If you do use it, there is a
high propability that it will mess up your character sheet (or even
crash the program if you are very unlucky!).

  In CharGen you will sometimes see a recessed gadget showing a number,
with a integer gadget to the right of it, such as the pair shown under
@{" Edit/Level and Xp " LINK "Edit_Level"}. The first of these shows the total number (in this
case the total number of hit points), and the second the adjustment you
have applied (a kind of 'cheat' gadget).

  It is important for you to know that an adjustment entered into
CharGen will be shown with a '+' or a '-'.
  A '+' should be taken to mean that it is a bonus, and a '-' means
that the number is a penalty. Thus if you enter +2 in the THAC0
adjustment gadget, under @{" Abilities, Fighting " LINK "Abilities_Fighting"} you will see the
THAC0 _decrease_ by 2.

  Under some of the very long scrolling lists you will find a string
gadget named 'Find'. This gadget is a search gadget that allows you to
enter a piece of text to search for. If the text piece is found, it
will be the new top item in the list. The search ignores case, and
doesn't need the full text (e.g. When searching the priest spell list
for cure spells you can enter 'cure'. You will then see the next spell
with the letters 'cure' in its name at the top of the list - this
could be one of the Cure xxxxxx Wounds spells, or even the Obscurement
spell).
  The search routine will wrap around, when it finds no matching name
in the list below the present top.

    Development on the present version of CharGen has stopped. If a future
version of CharGen is relseaed it vill be a WB 2.x+ version.

  The following file structure must be kept so that CharGen can find

  *) Must be named Characters, and must be in the same directory as
CharGen, unless the @{" CHARACTERS " LINK "Tool_Characters"} tooltype says otherwise. This is the
initial directory. You can off course load characters from any source.

  **) Must be named CharData, and must be in the same directory as
CharGen, unless the @{" CHARDATA " LINK "Tool_Chardata"} tooltype says otherwise.

  ***) Must be in the CharData directory, and must be named
CharGen.prefs, unless the @{" SETTINGS " LINK "Tool_Settings"} tooltype says otherwise.

  You can still load characters created with earlier versions of
CharGen, but you might see minor changes in you character. You should
read the History.doc to see what you can expect, when you load an old
character into CharGen.

  In addition CharGen needs the following libraries, which must be the
LIBS:  directory.

info.library - Get this from your workbench disk.
diskfont.library - Get this from your workbench disk.
reqtools.library - Use @{" Install_ReqTools " LINK "Important"} script to install

@Endnode

@Node "Important"
@Title "Important !!!"
@Prev "Installation"
@Next "Shortcuts"

  CharGen uses the ReqTools.library © by Nico François to gain a
Workbench 2.0-look on it's requesters, even under Workbench 1.3.
CharGen must have at least version 2.0a of this library to function
correctly.

  You must install the ReqTools.library in your LIBS: directory. Use
the Install_ReqTools (by double-clicking it) script for this, since
there are two versions of the library (one for 2.0+ and one for 1.3).
If you are running Workbench 2.0 or lower, just use the
Install_ReqTools script. If you are running under Workbench 2.1 or
higher, get hold of the ReqTools package (version 2.0a or higher), if
you would like to 'localize' ReqTools. Many @{" thanks " LINK "Thanks"} to Nico 
for this great library.

@Endnode

@Node "Shortcuts"
@Title "Keyboard Shortcuts"
@Prev "Important"
@Next "Sheet"

  In order to cut down on the number switches between the keyboard and
the mouse you have to make, CharGen provides you with the following
keyboard shortcuts:

All versions of WB:

 · If no string gadget on the screen is activated, and you press
   <RETURN>, the first string gadget (if there is one) on the screen
   will activate.

 · When you use <RETURN> to exit a string gadget, the next gadget (if
   there is one) will be activated.
   When using <RETURN> (and <SHIFT><RETURN>, see below) to walk among
   the string gadgets on the screen, CharGen will wrap around when
   reaching the last/first string gadget (i.e. if you press <RETURN> 
   in the last string gadget, then the first string gadget will be
   activated and vica versa).

WB version 2.0 and up:

 · If you use <SHIFT><RETURN> instead of just <RETURN> when exiting a
   string gadget, the previous string gadget (if there is one) will 
   be activated, not the next.

 · You can make a cycle gadget cycle the opposite way by holding down
   the <SHIFT> key while clicking it.

 · The up/down cursor keys can be used to scroll through a scrolling
   list. If there are two such lists on screen at any one time, the
   second can be scrolled by using the right/left cursor keys. It 
   only works if no string gadget is active on the screen at the same
   time.

 · When using the arrow gadgets of a scrolling list, or the cursor
   keys, pressing <ALT>, <SHIFT>, or <CTRL> on the keyboard has this
   function:

        <ALT>  : Move by a half view full.
        <SHIFT>: Move by one view full.
        <CTRL> : Move to start or end of list.

 · Keybord equivalents for the Ok, Cancel, Continue, and Find gadgets
   shown on many screens are implemented:
         <o>    ok
         <ESC>  cancel
         <o>    continue
         <f>    find
   If a string gadget is active <right amiga> and the key will work as
   the keyboard equivalent.
   (I haven't used <c> as "cancel" to avoid conflict with the StringClip
    program, which is quite useful in conjunction with CharGen.)

@Node "Sharing"
@Title "Sharing files with others"
@Prev "Sheet"
@Next "CG_HELP"

  If you play in a group where several others also have CharGen, and
you want to be able to share character files between you, there are
several steps you must take avoid problems:

 · Make sure you are all using the same (and newest) version of CharGen.

 · Make sure the datafiles are identical. This is only a problem if
   somebody in the group wish to design something. Appoint one of you
   to have the 'Master files' and design everything here. Then make
   copies of the master files (the @{" CharData " LINK "Package"} directory) and distribute
   them.

  There are two reasons that the latter is nessesary. The first is
simple, the second complex:

  If a person designs something and uses it in a character which he
then saves and gives to another, the other person's CharGen will have
no information about the data the first person designed (while this
could be a minor problem if it was a spell, imagine trying to load a
character of a class that doesn't exsist in your system - CharGen
would simply refuse to load the character).

  CharGen gives each data item (a spell, a weapon, or whatever...) a
identification number. If two people independently designs something
(e.g. a spell) it will have the same identification number, even
though they are very different (one could be a 1'st level spell, the
other a 9'th level). When a character is saved, only the
identification number of his data items are saved, and not the data
itself (would result in _very_ large files for spellcasters). So when
a character, who can cast the 1'st level spell designed on the first
system, is saved, and later loaded on the second system the character
can now cast a 9'th level spell.

  These are the chances for the different frequencies:

                        Uncommon        30%

                        Very Rare        1%

  Choose Race and Class. If you already have a character this should
be done with great care, since it can change (or even delete) other
parts of the character which are illegeal for the new Race/Class
combination.

  The total xp of the character remains unchanged.

  Wizard types and Priesthoods are also chosen here, if more than one
is allowed. If only one is allowed, you will not be asked which one
you want (e.g. the wizard type of an elven fighter/wizard is always a
mage, unless you have designed some wizard schools yourself).

@Endnode

@Node "Edit_Ability"
@Title "Edit/Ability Scores"
@TOC "Edit"
@Prev "Edit_Race"
@Next "Edit_Level"

  This is where you choose Strength, Intelligence etc...

  On the left there are seven boxes containing the present ability
scores (and one for exceptional strength). It is these scores you will
get when you press the OK box. They can be altered by clicking the
appropiate box and entering the desired score. This can override the
Min-Max range shown next to it.

  Below is a gadget labeled 'Enforce Ranges'. If you click this, the
ability scores will be adjusted so that they fall into the ranges
shown. Please note that these are not the same as those in the PHB.
They are the _effective_ limits, meaning that they have been adjusted
by the racial ability score adjustment, to reflect the true range
allowed (the ranges shown in PHB must be imposed _before_ racial
ability adjustments are added).

  Below this is a gadget labeled 'Reroll Ability Scores'. If you click
this, the ability scores will be rerolled (surprise!), using the
method you have chosen in @{" Settings/General " LINK "Settings_General"}.

  Method: PHB 1 and UA
  There are no further gadgets on screen when you use these methods.

  Method:  PHB 2, PHB 3, PHB 4, PHB 5, and Custom.
  On the far right are 7-14 boxes. These contain random numbers
generated by rolling according to the chosen method (either 3d6, or
4d6 and discarding the lowest roll, or as defined in the
@{" Settings/General " LINK "Settings_General"} menu). If you click on one of these boxes it will
be highlighted. This indicates that you are about to place that
number on one of the ability scores, which is done by clicking on one
of the gadgets with the name of the appropiate ability score. If you
want to place a number on another ability score, simply click the
gadget with the number, and it will become free to be placed somewhere
else. Method PHB 2 is a little special, in that you can only place a
number on the ability score that is on the same level with it on the
screen.

  If the above explanation confused you even more, then try it out,
and see what happens.

  The methods have been extended (from those explained in PHB) to also
take comeliness into account.

  The adjustment of Comeliness for high or low Charisma is not
performed until the character sheet is shown or printed.

  CharGen uses the fighting-system from 'The Complete Fighter's

use a Bow one-handed), or because of the characters class or height.

  This is the number of attacks per round the character has with this
weapon. To the right is a number gadget that allows you to increase or
decrease the number of attacks, by entering a positive or negative
number. This is the possible values:

                Nil, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 1/1, 3/2, 2/1, 5/2, 
                3/1, 7/2, 4/1, 9/2, 5/1, 5 ½, 6/1

  The rate of fire (ROF) for a weapon specialist using some missile
weapons have been set by me, when I could not find any relevant
information (in the case of the new firearms), or when the information
available didn't make sense. If you disagree with any of my choises
simply change them via @{" Design/Weapon... " LINK "Design_Weapon"}.

Here is a list of the changes:

   · The blowgun has a base ROF of 2/1, but if you specialize you
     get a ROF of 3/2 (according to table 35 in Player Handbook),
     which doesn't make much sense.
   · The hand crossbow has the same ROF progression as 'Other
     (Non-bow) Missiles' in table 35 in Players Handbook.
   · The knife, shuriken, and stilleto has the same ROF
     progression as the dagger.
   · The ROF progression for firearms has been based on the
     weapon's base ROF and the progression shown in table 35 in
     Players Handbook for light and heavy crossbows, thus on
     levels 1-6 the ROF is unchanged, on levels 7-12 it is one
     step higher, and on level 13 and above is it two steps
     higher.

  Please note a spell that normally (in AD&D books) start with the
name of its creator (fx. 'Melf's Minute Meteors'), do not do so in

  There are two way of giving your character psionic powers. The
first is by choosing the Psionicist character class, the second is by
making a Wild Talent. Simply click the 'Wild Talent' gadget to make
your character a wild talent.

  The number gadgets labled 'Dis', 'Sci', 'Dev', 'Def', shows how many
disciplines, sciences, devotions and defense modes you can learn. If
you are a Psionicist the numbers shown will correspond to the table in
the Psionics Handbook. For wild talents you must enter the numbers
your self, as CharGen doesn't select wild powers for you.

  The number gadget labled 'PSP' shows the number of Psionic Strength
Points your character has. For wild talents you have to enter this
your self.

  Before you can choose any powers, you must have access to a
discipline. You gain acess to a discipline by selecting it from the
list 'Clairsentience', 'Psychokinesis', 'Psychometabolism',
'Psychoportation', 'Telepathy','Metapsionics'. The primary discipline
(the first one chosen) has its text written in black on blue
background, while the rest of the chosen disciplines are written in
white on blue background.

  To the right of the chosen disciplines, are numbers that show the
number of sciences/devotions you have chosen in the corresponding
discipline. Please note that defense modes do not show up in the
number of sciences/devotions chosen, nor are they counted when
checking the rules.

  Select 'Learn' to be able to select and unselect psionic powers. To
relearn a power select 'Relearn'. To see information about a power
(including how many times you have learned it, if any) select
'Information'.

  If you "unlearn" powers or whole disciplines, the rules for
selection given in The Complete Psionics Handbook are not checked. To
see if anything needs fixing, click on the 'Check for problems'
gadget. This will test for most rule violations, but is not perfect
(you still have to think ;-).

  If you try learning a power but cannot, the reason is the rules
given in The Complete Psionics Handbook.

  Psionicists generated randomly will not have psionic powers selected
for them. This should be done by you.

  Using the items in this menu can have very sad consequences, so make
a backup of the CharData directory before you change anything.

  As a general rule you should look at some examples before you try
designing on your own. Specificly you should keep in mind that:

o A race should have at least one class allowed.

o If a class can cast priest spells you must make a priesthood
  available to it, even if the class is not a priest (e.g. Paladins
  and Rangers).

o If a class can cast wizard spells you must make a wizard school
  available to it, even if the class is not a wizard (e.g. Bards).

  When you create new things by using this menu you may get the
message: 'Not room for more races !' or something similar. The cure
for this is simple (assuming you have enough memory). Save all you
work, quit the program, and start it again. You will now have some

  This is a rule I use myself. Uses the dex check penalty for armor
(from Fighter's Handbook) as a penalty on initiative. This penalty can
be reduced by magical armor (each '+' reduces the penalty by one,
although it cannot make the penalty into a bonus). Thus if a character
wore a Banded Mail + 1 (Banded mail has a dex check penalty of -2) the
penalty for wearing armor would be -1 on initiative (see the effect on
weapon speed). Shields do not affect initiative under this rule. Use
this rule as a counterbalance to the @{" Initiative adjusted by dex. " LINK "Settings_Character_InitiativeDex"} rule.

  This method of calculation hit points for multiclassed characters is
more generous than the one given in PHB. The reason for this is mainly
that the routine rounds up instead of down, and you can add all rolls
before dividing by the number of classes.

  My rule: All hit dice for each level divided by the number of
classes (round up) plus the most advantageous constitution bonus. When
you don't advance simultaneously in all classes you only gain hit
points when your higest class level increases. Example: A 3/3 level
fighter/thief with constitution 17, who advances a level as thief gets
(d6+d10)/2+3 hit points. He gets no hit points when he later advances
to 4'th level as fighter.

  Normally thief skills cannot exceed 95% (99% for Rangers), but I use
a slightly different rule in my campaign (yes, yet a another rule ;-).

  My rule: A thiefs skill _CAN_ exceed 95%, but if, when the skill is
checked, you roll 96% or above the skill check fails. Now you might
say that there is no practical difference between this rule and the
one in PHB, but there is: If the DM decides to penalize the characters
skill (e.g. because of a difficult lock) the penalty is deducted from
the characters skill before the roll is made. Thus if a thief with
105% skill in an ability gets a -20% penalty he would have a 85%
chance of succeding, whereas a thief under PHB rules (max 95% skill)
would have 75% chance of succeding.

different abilities according to their relevance to the race and class
of the character. The degree to which this placement of scores should
be random, can be controlled with this number. A very low number
assures that Fighters will have high strength, Thieves high dexterity
and so on... Please note that the race of the character also affects
the distribution of the scores, so a Halfling Fighter is also likely
to have a high dexterity. The higher the number, the more random the
placement of the highest scores will be. This does in no way change
the value of the rolled scores, only on which ability they are placed.

  This is where you define the user definable spell printing formats.

  Using the 'Data Format' boxes on the left side of the screen, you
can edit the way spell data is printed, when using the 'User defined
format' print method.

  Using the 'Column Format' boxes on the right side of the screen, you
can edit the width the lines and spell names, when using the 'Names in
x columns' print method.

  The editable number boxes define how wide the data field in question
is. You can change this within certain limits. The recessed 'Width'
boxes show the total width of a line (in characters), excluding any
margin you might have set in printer preferences, and the print pitch
that will be used when printing. CharGen selects the print pitch
(Pica, Elite or Fine) based on the widths, and the left and right
margins you have set in the printer preferences.

  Allows you to pick the screen mode CharGen will use. The screen mode
and screen size are saved in the Settings file, along with window size
and position. Is only available under 2.0+.
  The screen opened by CharGen is a public screen with the name

  Although available font sizes will depend on the size of the screen
CharGen is on, it can still happen that some text or gadgets 'crawls'
out of the window, so after changing fonts, CharGen will resize the
window so that this is unlikely (when possible - if you use large
fonts it might be unavoidable). The program font can be proportional.

  These tool types can be placed in the CharGen icon using the Info

use these tool types if you run from shell (perhaps from the startup-
sequence of a boot disk), Example:

        CharGen PUBSCREEN=Workbench PROGRAMFONT=topaz/11

@Endnode

@Node "Tool_PubScreen"
@Title "ToolTypes/PUBSCREEN"
@TOC "ToolTypes"
@Prev "Tool_Nosize"
@Next "Tool_Programfont"

Usage: PUBSCREEN=<screenname>

  Tells CharGen to open its window on the public screen named (case
sensetive!).

  Example:

                        PUBSCREEN=Workbench

@Endnode

@Node "Tool_Programfont"
@Title "ToolTypes/PROGRAMFONT"

Usage: PROGRAMFONT=<font>/<size>

  Selects the @{" program font " LINK "Settings_Font_Program"}. Overrides the font saved in the
Settings file. Do not include ".font" in the font name.

  Example:

                        PROGRAMFONT=helvetica/13

@Endnode

@Node "Tool_Characterfont"

@Node "Tool_Chardata"
@Title "ToolTypes/CHARDATA"

@Next "Tool_Characters"

Usage: CHARDATA=<directory path>

  Allows you to specify a different directory from which CharGen will
get its data about races, classes,... This is useful if you run
several campaigns which differ greatly in races, classes,... 

  Example:

                CHARDATA=work:AD&D/SpellJammer/CharData

@Endnode

@Node "Tool_Characters"
@Title "ToolTypes/CHARACTERS"
@TOC "ToolTypes"
@Prev "Tool_Chardata"
@Next "Tool_Screen"

Usage: CHARACTERS=<directory path>

  Allows you to specify a different directory to which CharGen will
save the characters you create. This is also useful if you run several
campaigns.

  Example:

               CHARACTER=work:AD&D/SpellJammer/Characters

@Endnode

@Node "Tool_Screen"
@Title "ToolTypes/SCREEN"
@TOC "ToolTypes"
@Prev "Tool_Characters"
@Next "Tool_Nosize"

Usage: SCREEN=<NTSC|PAL|LACE> (not 2.0+)

  Force screen mode selection. The program detects weather the machine
run in PAL or a NTSC mode, so this tool type is not nessesary for the
ordinary user, but it helps me when I have to check the Gadget layout
on an NTSC screen. The LACE option can be used with NTSC and PAL in
this way, but is not required:

                            SCREEN=NTSC|LACE
                            SCREEN=PAL|LACE

  or it can be used alone

                              SCREEN=LACE

  If you run in NTSC mode and have an anti-flicker device, then I
strongly recommend that you use the LACE option, as the screen layout
improves (more room for all the gadgets, see also NOSIZE).

  If you use the LACE option you might consider using a larger font,
such as topaz 11, so the text will be easier to read.

@Endnode

@Node "Tool_Nosize"
@Title "ToolTypes/NOSIZE"
@TOC "ToolTypes"
@Prev "Tool_Screen"
@Next "Tool_Pubscreen"

Usage: NOSIZE

  If you run CharGen in NTSC, you should use this tool type to remove
the sizing gadget in the lower right corner of the window. The gadget
layout on a NTSC screen was created with the assumption that you use
this tool type. This tool type can of course also be used if you don't
run in NTSC, giving you a little more room in the window.
