Chapter 1 Introducing CharGen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    CharGen is a character-generation program that lightens the workload
of the Dungeon Master in the roleplaying game >Advanced Dungeons &
Dragons< (also known as AD&D) from TSR Inc.

    If you have no prior knowlegde of AD&D, the program will _not_ be of
any great use to you.  The program does _NOT_ replace any puplished
material from TSR, i.e.  you cannot learn the game from this program,
nor can you learn the spells contained in the different source books
from this program.

  CharGen is FreeWare.

1.2 Generel notes

    Be sure the settings in the Settings menu corresponds to the rules
you use in your game, as this can influence the way certain rules are
applied.  If you cannot recreate a character from your game, check the
menu items in the Settings menu.

    Do not use the '@' character, as this is used to embed printer
escape sequences in your character sheet.  If you do use it, there is a
high propability that it will mess up your character sheet (or even
crash the program if you are very unlucky!).

    In CharGen you will sometimes see a recessed gadget showing a
number, with a integer gadget to the right of it, such as the pair shown
under 'Edit, Level and Xp'.  The first of these shows the total number
(in this case the total number of hit points), and the second the
adjustment you have applied (a kind of 'cheat' gadget).

    It is important for you to know that an adjustment entered into
CharGen will be shown with a '+' or a '-'.  A '+' should be taken to
mean that it is a bonus, and a '-' means that the number is a penalty.
Thus if you enter +2 in the THAC0 adjustment gadget, under 'Abilities,
Fighting' you will see the THAC0 _decrease_ by 2.

    Under some of the very long scrolling lists you will find a string
gadget named 'Find'.  This gadget is a search gadget that allows you to
enter a piece of text to search for.  If the text piece is found, it
will be the new top item in the list.  The search ignores case, and
doesn't need the full text (e.g.  When searching the priest spell list
for cure spells you can enter 'cure'.  You will then see the next spell
with the letters 'cure' in its name at the top of the list - this could
be one of the Cure xxxxxx Wounds spells, or even the Obscurement spell).
  The search routine will wrap around, when it finds no matching name in
the list below the present top.

    Development on the present version of CharGen has stopped. If a future
version of CharGen is relseaed it vill be a WB 2.x+ only version.

1.4 Installation of CharGen

    The following file structure must be kept so that CharGen can find
it's data (or you can use the SETTINGS, CHARDATA and CHARACTERS tool
types).

    CharGen
    Characters (Dir) *
    CharData (Dir) **
        Armor
        Class
        Major Class
        Priesthoods
        Proficiency
        Psionics
        Race
        Spells
        Weapon
        Wizard Schools
	CharIcon.info
	Sources.prefs
	CharGen.prefs ***

    *) Must be named Characters, and must be in the same directory as
CharGen, unless the CHARACTERS tooltype says otherwise.  This is the
initial directory.  You can off course load characters from any source.

    **) Must be named CharData, and must be in the same directory as
CharGen, unless the CHARDATA tooltype says otherwise.

    ***) Must be in the CharData directory, and must be named
CharGen.prefs, unless the SETTINGS tooltype says otherwise.

    You can still load characters created with earlier versions of
CharGen, but you might see minor changes in you character.  You should
read the History.doc to see what you can expect, when you load an old
character into CharGen.

    In addition CharGen needs the following libraries, which must be the
LIBS:  directory.

info.library - Get this from your workbench disk.
diskfont.library - Get this from your workbench disk.
reqtools.library - Use Install_ReqTools script to install (see below).


1.5 Important !!!

    CharGen uses the ReqTools.library © by Nico François to gain a
Workbench 2.0-look on it's requesters, even under Workbench 1.3.
CharGen must have at least version 2.0a of this library to function
correctly.

    You must install the ReqTools.library in your LIBS:  directory.  Use
the Install_ReqTools (by double-clicking it) script for this, since
there are two versions of the library (one for 2.0+ and one for 1.3).
If you are running Workbench 2.0 or lower, just use the Install_ReqTools
script.  If you are running under Workbench 2.1 or higher, get hold of
the ReqTools package (version 2.0a or higher), if you would like to
'localize' ReqTools.  Many thanks to Nico for this great library.


1.6 Keyboard shortcuts

    In order to cut down on the number switches between the keyboard and
the mouse you have to make, CharGen provides you with the following
keyboard shortcuts:

All versions of WB:

 · If no string gadget on the screen is activated, and you press
   <RETURN>, the first string gadget (if there is one) on the screen
   will activate.

 · When you use <RETURN> to exit a string gadget, the next gadget (if
   there is one) will be activated.
   When using <RETURN> (and <SHIFT><RETURN>, see below) to walk among
   the string gadgets on the screen, CharGen will wrap around when
   reaching the last/first string gadget (i.e.  if you press <RETURN> in
   the last string gadget, then the first string gadget will be
   activated and vica versa).

WB version 2.0 and up:

 · If you use <SHIFT><RETURN> instead of just <RETURN> when exiting a
   string gadget, the previous string gadget (if there is one) will be
   activated, not the next.

 · You can make a cycle gadget cycle the opposite way by holding down
   the <SHIFT> key while clicking it.

 · The up/down cursor keys can be used to scroll through a scrolling
   list.  If there are two such lists on screen at any one time, the
   second can be scrolled by using the right/left cursor keys.  It only
   works if no string gadget is active on the screen at the same time.

 · When using the arrow gadgets of a scrolling list, or the cursor keys,
   pressing <ALT>, <SHIFT>, or <CTRL> on the keyboard has this function:
	<ALT>  : Move by a half view full.
 	<SHIFT>: Move by one view full.
	<CTRL> : Move to start or end of list.

 · Keybord equivalents for the Ok, Cancel, Continue, and Find gadgets
   shown on many screens are implemented:
         <o>    ok
         <ESC>  cancel
         <o>    continue
         <f>    find
   If a string gadget is active <right amiga> and the key will work as
   the keyboard equivalent.
   (I haven't used <c> as "cancel" to avoid conflict with the StringClip
    program, which is quite useful in conjunction with CharGen.)

1.8 Sharing files with others

    If you play in a group where severel others also have CharGen, and
you want to be able to share character files between you, there are
severel steps you must take avoid problems:

 · Make sure you are all using the same (and newest) version of CharGen.

 · Make sure the datafiles are identical.  This is only a problem if
   somebody in the group wish to design something.  Appoint one of you
   to have the 'Master files' and design everything here.  Then make
   copies of the master files (the CharData directory) and distribute
   them.

    There are two reasons that the latter is nessesary.  The first is
simple, the second complex:

    If a person designs something and uses it in a character which he
then saves and gives to another, the other person's CharGen will have no
information about the data the first person designed (while this could
be a minor problem if it was a spell, imagine trying to load a character
of a class that doesn't exsist in your system - CharGen would simply
refuse to load the character).

    CharGen gives each data item (a spell, a weapon, or whatever...) a
identification number.  If two people independently designs something
(e.g.  a spell) it will have the same identification number, even though
they are very different (one could be a 1'st level spell, the other a
9'th level).  When a character is saved, only the identification number
of his data items are saved, and not the data itself (would result in
_very_ large files for spellcasters).  So when a character, who can cast
the 1'st level spell designed on the first system, is saved, and later
loaded on the second system the character can now cast a 9'th level
spell.


1.9 HELP

  Pressing the <HELP> key under WB 2.04+ will bring up the CharGen
documentation file via AmigaGuide on the CharGen screen. To use this
feature you must have the amigaguide.library installed.

  If you enter a menu item (such as 'Weapons' in the 'Equip' menu) and
press <HELP> you will be given information about that menu item's
function.

  If you select a menu item and press <HELP> (while still holding the
right mouse button depressed over the menu item) you will be given
information about that menu item's function.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Chapter 2 The Project menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

2.1 New

    2.1.1 Enter

    Allows you to create a person from scratch.  You are guided through
most menu-items in the Edit, Equip, and Abilities menus (see below).
You can cancel at any time by clicking CANCEL.


    2.1.2 Random

    Creates a random character, taking into account the frequency of the
different Races, Classes etc...  You are first asked to set certain
variables which also affect the result.

    These are the chances for the different frequencies:

			Common		65%
			Uncommon	30%
			Rare		 4%
			Very Rare	 1%

    So if you would like to have more half-elves when rolling random
characters simply change the frequency of half-elves in the Design Race
menu (and so on...).


2.2 Open

    Loads a character.


2.3 Save

    Saves a previously saved character.


2.4 Save As

    Saves a new character.


2.5 Print

    2.5.1 Character

    Prints a character-sheet (normally to PRT:, but this can be changed
in 'Settings, Printer') using standard Amiga printer control codes.  To
get a good looking result the left margin in prefrences should be set to
about 5.


    2.5.2 Description

    Prints a characters description, notes and equipment seperatly.


    2.5.3 Spells

    Prints spellslists/spellbooks.  Please note that this menu item only
functions when the current character is a spellcaster.

    Here is a short summary of what different methods prints:

 · 'User defined format'
   You can define how this should work in 'Settings, Formats/Spells'.

 · 'Standard format'
   Name, Range, Duration, Area of Effect, Casting Time, Save,
   Reversability, and Components.

 · 'Spellbook format'
   Name, Range, Duration, Area of Effect, Casting Time, Save,

functions when the current character has psionic powers.

    Here is a short summary of the method:

 · Name, Type, Power Score, Initial Cost, Maintainance Cost, Range,
   Preparation Time, Area of Effect.


2.6 About

    Shows some details about CharGen (version number and date), and how
to contact me.


2.7 Quit

    Guess what...


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Chapter 3 The Edit menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.1 Race and Class

  Choose Race and Class.  If you already have a character this should be
done with great care, since it can change (or even delete) other parts
of the character which are illegeal for the new Race/Class combination.

  The total xp of the character remains unchanged.

  Wizard types and Priesthoods are also chosen here, if more than one is
allowed.  If only one is allowed, you will not be asked which one you
want (e.g.  the wizard type of an elven fighter/wizard is always a mage,
unless you have designed some wizard schools yourself).


3.2 Ability Scores

  This is where you choose Strength, Intelligence etc...

  On the left there are seven boxes containing the present ability
scores (and one for exceptional strength).  It is these scores you will
get when you press the OK box.  They can be altered by clicking the
appropiate box and entering the desired score.  This can override the
Min-Max range shown next to it.

  Below is a gadget labeled 'Enforce Ranges'.  If you click this, the
ability scores will be adjusted so that they fall into the ranges shown.
Please note that these are not the same as those in the PHB.  They are
the _effective_ limits, meaning that they have been adjusted by the
racial ability score adjustment, to reflect the true range allowed (the
ranges shown in PHB must be imposed _before_ racial ability adjustments
are added).

  Below this is a gadget labeled 'Reroll Ability Scores'.  If you click
this, the ability scores will be rerolled (surprise!), using the method
you have chosen in 'Settings, General'.

  Method: PHB 1 and UA
  There are no further gadgets on screen when you use these methods.

  Method:  PHB 2, PHB 3, PHB 4, PHB 5, and Custom.
  On the far right are 7-14 boxes.  These contain random numbers
generated by rolling according to the chosen method (either 3d6, or 4d6
and discarding the lowest roll, or as defined in the 'Settings, General'
menu).  If you click on one of these boxes it will be highlighted.  This
indicates that you are about to place that number on one of the ability
scores, which is done by clicking on one of the gadgets with the name of
the appropiate ability score.  If you want to place a number on another
ability score, simply click the gadget with the number, and it will
become free to be placed somewhere else.  Method PHB 2 is a little
special, in that you can only place a number on the ability score that
is on the same level with it on the screen.

  If the above explanation confused you even more, then try it out, and
see what happens.

  The methods have been extended (from those explained in PHB) to also
take comeliness into account.

  The adjustment of Comeliness for high or low Charisma is not performed
until the character sheet is shown or printed.


3.3 Level and Xp

  Enter your characters level and xp.  You can change the hit points by
using the 'REROLL' button, or directly entering the hit dice rolls for
each level.  There is also a 'cheat' gadget that allows you to add hit
points directly.


3.4 Saving Throws

  Allows you to review/alter the characters saving throws.  The
'Protection' box simulates the effect of a Ring of Protection as it
affects saves.  It has no influence over the armor class of your
character.


3.5 Description

  Allows you to enter a short/long description of the character in
question.


3.6 Notes

  Here you can enter various notes for your character.  If you don't see
these written at the bottom of the sheet, check that the 'Show notes and
equipment' option in the 'Settings, Format/Sheets' menu is on.  If it is
on and you still don't see it try, turning 'Show full description' in
the same menu off, or make the sheet longer ('Sheet Lenght').


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Chapter 4 The Equip menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

4.1 Armor

  Choose the armor for your character.  Some armors may be disallowed
because of the characters class, or priesthood.  If you have selected
the option 'Piecemeal Armors' under 'Settings, This Character', and your
present character is allowed to use armors that can be used in pieces,
you will be presented with five extra cycle gadgets to control the
makeup of your armor .


4.2 Weapon

  Choosing a weapon

  You choose a weapon by clicking on it in the scrolling list named
'Available Weapons'.  When you do this, the weapons name will appear in
the 'Chosen Weapons' box, which is the weapons which will be shown on
the character sheet.  Below it is the options 'Edit', 'Copy', 'Swap',
and 'Remove'.

     · 'Edit'
        Can be used on any weapon displayed in the 'Chosen Weapons' box,
        and gives you extensive control over the characters skill with
        the weapon in question.  See below for some hints about editing.

      · 'Copy'
        Lets you to make a copy of a weapon shown in the 'Chosen
        Weapons' box.

      · 'Swap'
        Lets you to change the order the weapons in the 'Chosen Weapons'
        box will be shown on the character sheet.

      · 'Remove'
        Lets you remove a weapon from the 'Chosen Weapons' box, and
        makes you non-proficient with it, if it was the last of its type
        in the 'Chosen Weapons' box.

  Editing a weapon

  Most of the gadgets that appears, when you have chosen 'Edit' and
clicked on a weapon in the 'Chosen Weapons' box, need no further
explanation, so here are just a few notes to help you:

      · Skill
        Even though you have a fighter, and have slots left, you might
        not be able to specialize because you can only specialize once
        on level one, and again each time you gain new weapon slots
        (i.e.  every third level).

      · Style
        CharGen uses the fighting-system from 'The Complete Fighter's
        Handbook' - i.e.  it is possible to use different fighting
        styles (Weapon & Shield, One Weapon, Two Weapon, Two Hander).
        Some styles might not be available due to restrictions on the
        Weapon (its hard to use a Bow one-handed), or because of the
        characters class or height.

      · Combat
        Tells CharGen weather it should treat the weapon as a missile
        weapon or a meele weapon.  This is useful with weapons such as
        the dagger.

      · #Att
        This is the number of attacks per round the character has with
        this weapon.  To the right is a number gadget that allows you to
        increase or decrease the number of attacks, by entering a
        positive or negative number.  This is the possible values:

                Nil, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 1/1, 3/2, 2/1, 5/2, 
                3/1, 7/2, 4/1, 9/2, 5/1, 5 ½, 6/1

        The rate of fire (ROF) for a weapon specialist using some
        missile weapons have been set by me, when I could not find any
        relevant information (in the case of the new firearms), or when
        the information available didn't make sense.  If you disagree
        with any of my choises simply change them via 'Design,
        Weapons...'.  Here is a list of the changes:

         · The blowgun has a base ROF of 2/1, but if you specialize you
           get a ROF of 3/2 (according to table 35 in Player Handbook),
           which doesn't make much sense.
         · The hand crossbow has the same ROF progression as 'Other
           (Non-bow) Missiles' in table 35 in Players Handbook.
         · The knife, shuriken, and stilleto has the same ROF
           progression as the dagger.
         · The ROF progression for firearms has been based on the
           weapon's base ROF and the progression shown in table 35 in
           Players Handbook for light and heavy crossbows, thus on
           levels 1-6 the ROF is unchanged, on levels 7-12 it is one
           step higher, and on level 13 and above is it two steps
           higher.

      · Special
        This is where CharGen writes special information.  This could be
        the range of a missile weapon, effects of style specialization,
        a reminder of the possibility of extra damage with firearms and
        so on...

The size of a person (which is used for determining which weapons can be
used and how) is now calculated from the person's height and not from
the average racial height, thus a very large (higher than 4' = medium
size) halfling can use a scimitar (also medium size). I have used the
height intervals from Monstrous Compendium:

                Tiny        : up to 2'
                Small       : 2'+ to 4'
                Medium      : 4'+ to 7'
                Large       : 7'+ and up


4.3 Magic Items

This menu-item has not been implemented yet.


4.4 Equipment

Here you can enter various equipment for your character. If you don't
see this info written at the bottom of the sheet, check that the 'Show
notes and equipment' option in the 'Settings, Format/Character' menu is
on. If it is and you still don't see it, try turning 'Show full
description' in the same menu off, or making the sheet longer.


4.5 Wealth

  Here you can enter the amount of money the character has, and in which
coinage it is.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Chapter 5 The Abilities menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


5.1 Fighting

  Here you can choose which (if any) fighting styles the character is
specialized in.  You can become proficient in whole groups of weapons,
or give your character ambi-dexterity as defined in 'The Complete
Fighter's Handbook' and 'The Complete Spacefarer's Handbook'.


5.2 Proficiencies

  Allows you to choose which proficiencies your character shall have.
You will notice that there are different colors on the lines in the
scrolling list of proficiencies.  These colours relate to how many slots
the proficiency takes in the manner descriped on screen.

· Free proficiencies are just that, Free.  They are available to your
  character at no cost in proficiency slots.

· Normal proficiencies are those that your character can learn normally,
  at the normal cost.

· Special proficiencies are those proficiencies that your character
  needs to use an extra proficiency slot to learn.


5.3 Spell Casting

  Allows you to choose the individual spells your character can cast.
Some spells may be unavailable due to various restrictions. You can
change the Settings and/or your character to make them available.

  All normal spells from Players Handbook, Wizards Handbook, Tome of
Magic (not Quest spells), Greyhawk Adventures, and Forgotten Realms
Adventures, are available in CharGen, as are some spells from Dragon
Magazine.  If you see a spell you cannot find anywhere, it is properbly
one of my own creations.

  Your chosen spells can then be printed using the Print Spells item in
the Project menu.

  Please note a spell that normally (in AD&D books) start with the name
of its creator (fx.  'Melf's Minute Meteors'), do not do so in CharGen.
In CharGen the name of the creator is not part of the name of the spell.
So if you are looking for 'Melf's Minute Meteors', you will find it
under 'Minute Meteors'.

  The random spell selector (when used by wizards), takes the
intelligence limit on spells into account, weather the character is a
specialist wizard (spells of his specialist area are made more
frequent), and selects the Read Magic spell.

  If you have a character with severel spellcasting classes (E.g.  a
Ranger/Priest) you can switch between the different classes via the
cycle gadget labeled 'Spellcaster'.


5.4 Thieving Skills

  If the character has any 'criminal' skills, this is where you edit
them.

  The recessed box shows how many point you have left to distribute, and
the total number of points you may distribute.

  By clicking 'Base Skill Points' the points will be reset, to the
characters base points, adjusted for armor, race and dexterity.

  By clicking 'Distribute Points' the remaining points will be randomly
distributed among the skills.


5.5 Turning Undead

  How good is your character at turning undead (requires a priesthood
that can turn undead, and sufficent level).


5.6 Psionics

    There are two ways of giving your character psionic powers.  The
first is by choosing the Psionicist character class, the second is by
making a Wild Talent.  Simply click the 'Wild Talent' gadget to make
your character a wild talent.

    The number gadgets labled 'Dis', 'Sci', 'Dev', 'Def', shows how many
disciplines, sciences, devotions and defense modes you can learn.  If
you are a Psionicist the numbers shown will correspond to the table in
the Psionics Handbook.  For wild talents you must enter the numbers your
self, as CharGen doesn't select wild powers for you.

    The number gadget labled 'PSP' shows the number of Psionic Strength
Points your character has.  For wild talents you have to enter this your
self.

    Before you can choose any powers, you must have access to a
discipline.  You gain acess to a discipline by selecting it from the
list 'Clairsentience', 'Psychokinesis', 'Psychometabolism',
'Psychoportation', 'Telepathy','Metapsionics'.  The primary discipline
(the first one chosen) has its text written in black on blue background,
while the rest of the chosen disciplines are written in white on blue
background.

    To the right of the chosen disciplines, are numbers that show the
number of sciences/devotions you have chosen in the corresponding
discipline.  Please note that defense modes do not show up in the number
of sciences/devotions chosen, nor are they counted when checking the
rules.

    Select 'Learn' to be able to select and unselect psionic powers.  To
relearn a power select 'Relearn'.  To see information about a power
(including how many times you have learned it, if any) select
'Information'.

    If you "unlearn" powers or whole disciplines, the rules for
selection given in The Complete Psionics Handbook are not checked.  To
see if anything needs fixing, click on the 'Check for problems' gadget.
This will test for most rule violations, but is not perfect (you still
have to think ;-).

    If you try learning a power but cannot, the reason is the rules
given in The Complete Psionics Handbook.

    Psionicists generated randomly will not have psionic powers selected
for them.  This should be done by you.


5.7 Extra Abilities

    As the name implies, where you enter all those extra special
abilities or notes, that CharGen does not otherwise handle.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Chapter 6 The Design menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Danger !!!
  Using the items in this menu can have very sad consequences, so make a
backup of the CharData directory before you change anything.

  As a general rule you should look at some examples before you try
designing on your own.  Specificly you should keep in mind that:

· A race should have at least one class allowed.

· If a class can cast priest spells you must make a priesthood available
  to it, even if the class is not a priest (e.g.  Paladins and Rangers).

· If a class can cast wizard spells you must make a wizard school
  available to it, even if the class is not a wizard (e.g.  Bards).

  When you create new things by using this menu you may get the message:
'Not room for more races !' or something similar.  The cure for this is
simple (assuming you have enough memory).  Save all you work, quit the
program, and start it again.  You will now have some more working space.


6.1 Race

  Allows you to change the different races, or create new ones.


6.2 Class

  Allows you to change the different classes, or create new ones.
Please note that any new classes you create will not be available until
you make them so via 'Design, Race'.


6.3 Armor

  Allows you to change exsisting armors, or create new ones.  Please
note that any new armors you create will not be available until you make
them so via 'Design, Class' and perhaps 'Design, Priesthood'.


6.4 Weapon

  Allows you to change exsisting weapons, or create new ones.  Please
note that any new weapons you create will not be available until you
make them so via 'Design, Class' and perhaps 'Design, Priesthood'.


6.5 Proficiency

  Allows you to change exsisting proficiencies, or create new ones.


6.6 Spell

  Allows you to change the spell list.  This is the 'safest' item of all
the items in the in the 'Design' menu.


6.7 Priesthood

  Allows you to change exsisting priesthoods, or create new ones.
Please note that _any_ class (i.e.  not just priests) that can cast
priest spells should have at least one priesthood available to them.


6.8 Wizard School

  Allows you to change exsisting wizard schools, or create new ones.
Please note that _any_ class (i.e.  not just wizards) that can cast
wizard spells should have at least one wizard school available to them.


6.9 Psionics

    Allows you to change exsisting psionic powers, or create new ones.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Chapter 7 The Settings menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

7.1 Options

    7.1.1 This Character

  Different options that changes the way CharGen works.  These options
are saved along with the character.  If you select no options, the
program will work in accordance with basic PHB rules.

 · 'Slow, unlimited advancement'
   This optional rule from DMG allows multiclassed demihumans to advance
   above their normal maximum level limit.  The slow advancement rate
   can be changed by you in the 'Settings, General' menu.

 · 'Race affects years/level ratio'
   Choosing this option makes CharGen adjust the age according to the
   highest age catagory of the race, and the level of the character.  If
   this is not selected the adjustment to age is independant of race.
   Generally, the longer lived races takes more years to advance.  The
   year/level ratio can be changed by you in the 'Settings, General'
   menu.

 · 'High prime affects max. level'
   This optional rule from DMG allows demihumans to have higher maximum
   level limit than normal, if they have high prime requiste ability
   scores.

 · 'Weapon style spec. allowed'
   Use the rules for weapon style specialization as given in 'The
   Complete Fighter's Handbook'

 · 'All warriors can specialize'
   This is the rule from the 'The Complete Fighter's Handbook', that
   allows all warriors to specialize (an error ???).  This is
   implemented by allowing all classes, which have the 'Weapon
   specialization' and 'Max one weapon specialization' options under
   'Design, Class, Options' selected, to specialize.  Please note
   that unless you also choose the 'Multiple weapon specialization'
   option below, the character can only specialize in one weapon, unless
   he is a fighter.

 · 'Mutiple weapon specialization'
   Allows all who can specialize to specialize in more than one weapon.

 · 'Spec. bonus on missile weapons'
   According to Players Handbook the +1 to hit and +2 on damage given to
   weapon specialists only apply to meele weapons.  This option allows
   you to also gain these bonuses on missile weapons.

 · 'Initiative adjusted by dex.'
   This is a rule I use myself.  The speed of weapons are adjusted by
   dexterity reaction adjustment.  Thus a character with 17 dex gains a
   +2 bonus on initiative when fighting (see the effect on weapon
   speed).

 · 'Initiative adjusted by armor'
   This is a rule I use myself.  Uses the dex check penalty for armor
   (from Fighter's Handbook) as a penalty on initiative.  This penalty
   can be reduced by magical armor (each '+' reduces the penalty by one,
   although it cannot make the penalty into a bonus).  Thus if a
   character wore a Banded Mail + 1 (Banded mail has a dex check penalty
   of -2) the penalty for wearing armor would be -1 on initiative (see
   the effect on weapon speed).  Shields do not affect initiative under
   this rule. Use this rule as a counterbalance to the rule above.

 · 'All races can have Excep Str'
   Normally halflings cannot have exceptional strength, so this option
   is for your _very_ special halflings.  If you design other races that
   also cannot have exceptional strength, this option also affects them.

 · 'No extra proficiencies for Int'
   Allows you to disable the rule from PHB that gives extra nonweapon
   proficiency slots to characters with high intelligence.

 · 'Int 13 for Thought and Numbers'
   A recomended rule from the Tome of Magic.  It requires the character
   to have 13 in intelligence before he/she can cast spells from the
   Thought and Number spheres.

 · 'Maximum hp on first level'
   The character gains maximum hit points on first level (i.e.  no rolls
   are nessesary).  Use this option to create tougher characters, if
   your campaign is especially 'high-powered'.

 · 'Generous hp calculation method'
   This method of calculation hit points for multiclassed characters is
   more generous than the one given in PHB.  The reason for this is
   mainly that the routine rounds up instead of down, and you can add
   all rolls before dividing by the number of classes.

   My rule:  All hit dice for each level divided by the number of
   classes (round up) plus the most advantageous constitution bonus.
   When you don't advance simultaneously in all classes you only gain
   hit points when your higest class level increases.  Example:  A 3/3
   level fighter/thief with constitution 17, who advances a level as
   thief gets (d6+d10)/2+3 hit points.  He gets no hit points when he
   later advances to 4'th level as fighter.

 · 'Less damage on tiny thrown wpn.'
   This is a rule I use myself.  It does not grant a full damage bonus
   for high strength, when the weapon is a very small thrown weapon
   (such as a thrown knife).  In these cases the program gives you half
   the strength damage bonus (rounded down).  By selecting this option
   you can use this rule.

 · 'No bonus for strength on bows'
   This option dissallows strength bonuses on bow attack roll and
   damage.  It is an option here, rather than just under 'Design,
   Weapon', so you can let some characters have heavy pull bows, while
   not others.

 · 'Do not limit AC from -10 to 10'
   CharGen normally limits AC to the 10 to -10 range.  If you don't want
   these limits imposed, select this option.

 · 'Piecemeal armors allowed'
   Use the Piecemeal armor rules from 'The Complete Fighter's Handbook'.

 · 'No maximum on thief skills'
   Normally thief skills cannot exceed 95% (99% for Rangers), but I use
   a slightly different rule in my campaign (yes, yet a another rule
   ;-).

   My rule:  A thiefs skill _CAN_ exceed 95%, but if, when the skill is
   checked, you roll 96% or above the skill check fails.  Now you might
   say that there is no practical difference between this rule and the
   one in PHB, but there is:  If the DM decides to penalize the
   characters skill (e.g.  because of a difficult lock) the penalty is
   deducted from the characters skill before the roll is made.  Thus if
   a thief with 105% skill in an ability gets a -20% penalty he would
   have a 85% chance of succeding, whereas a thief under PHB rules (max
   95% skill) would have 75% chance of succeding.

 · 'Long equipment lines'
   Causes the equipment lines to be twice as long, but there will be
   half as many of them.  Changing this option might loose you some of
   the equipment information you have already entered (especially if
   changing from short to long lines).

 · 'All armors allowed'
 · 'All weapons allowed'
 · 'All proficiencies allowed'
 · 'All spells allowed'
 · 'All priesthoods allowed'
 · 'All wizard schools allowed'
   This option is for when you want to create a character that goes
   beyond the normal rules of the game (i.e. a halfling using large
   weapons, a human fighter/mage etc....). It doesn't override you
   source settings.


    7.1.2 New Characters

  Here you can edit the options new characters will be given. For an
explanation of how these options work, see above.


7.2 General


  On the second screen you can edit some other settings:

Ability Score Methods:

 · 'Ability scores (humans)'
   Here you choose which method should be used when rolling ability
   scores for humans.  If you choose 'Custom' the program will use the
   information you have entered in the 'Custom Method' boxes below.  The
   following methods have been implemented:  PHB 1, PHB 2, PHB 3, PHB 4,
   PHB 5, UA and Custom.

 · 'Ability scores (non-humans)'
   As above, but for non-humans.  This division between humans and
   non-humans is nessesary in order to use the UA method correctly.
   This method can only be used for humans according to the rules
   (although many people use it for all races, even multiclassed
   characters).

Custom Method:

 · 'Rolls'
 · 'Type of dice'
 · 'Number of dice per roll'
 · 'Number of dice to use'
 · 'Added to result'
   These numbers define the custom method of rolling ability scores.

Magic Numbers:

 · 'Slow level increase factor'
   An optional rule from DMG allows multiclassed demihumans to advance
   above their normal maximum level limit.  The slow advancement rate
   can be changed here.  For this to work you must have the 'Slow,
   unlimited advancement' option selected.

 · 'Years/level ratio (Humans)'
   This is the number of years added to a humans age for each level he
   has achived, when creating random characters.

 · 'Random placement of scores'
   When rolling a random character, the scores rolled are placed on the
   different abilities according to their relevance to the race and
   class of the character.  The degree to which this placement of scores
   should be random, can be controlled with this number.  A very low
   number assures that Fighters will have high strength, Thieves high
   dexterity and so on...  Please note that the race of the character
   also affects the distribution of the scores, so a Halfling Fighter is
   also likely to have a high dexterity.  The higher the number, the
   more random the placement of the highest scores will be.  This does
   in no way change the value of the rolled scores, only on which
   ability they are placed.


7.3 Sources

  This menu-item also allows you to tell the program which source books
are available to you.  A selected book will be available, and an
unselected book unavailable.  Do not delete any of the books already
entered, as this can cause trouble in future versions.  You may rename
the books, but keep the name of any source book that contains spells
short, so that it can fit when you print the spells.

  The information you enter here is checked against each items's 'Source
Book' field to determine if the item is available or not.  Items that
are not available will be ghosted, when you select from among that type
of items.

  The following items have sourcebook information in the present version
of CharGen:  Armors, Proficiencies, Spells, Weapons, and Psionics.

  The use of the source book fields will perhaps later be extended to
other things.

  Here follows a list of the source books already in CharGen.  Some of
the sources are not yet used, but are included for completeness.

7.4 Printer

  Allows you to change the print destination from the standard PRT:
(this means you can print to a file, if you enter a file name).

Printer options:

 · 'Send form feeds to printer'
   Selecting this option sends form feeds to the printer when printing
   to PRT:.

 · 'Remove printer codes when not printing to PRT:'
   When you print to a file you often don't want the printer escape
   codes printed also.  Choose this option to remove the escape codes.

 · 'Print description, notes and equipment on seperate sheet'
   Makes sure the description, notes and equipment are not printed on
   the main character sheet, even though they may be seen on screen.
   You should use 'Project, Print Description' to print these data on a
   seperate sheet of paper.

 · 'Reading guides on spell or psionic lists'
   Makes CharGen underline every third line printed on spell or psionic
   lists, to make the list easier to read (no need to use a ruler to
   keep your eyes on the same line).


7.5 Format 

    7.5.1 Character

    7.5.2 Spells

  This is where you define the user definable spell printing formats.

  Using the 'Data Format' boxes on the left side of the screen, you can
edit the way spell data is printed, when using the 'User defined format'
print method.

  Using the 'Column Format' boxes on the right side of the screen, you
can edit the width the lines and spell names, when using the 'Names in x
columns' print method.

  The editable number boxes define how wide the data field in question
is.  You can change this within certain limits.  The recessed 'Width'
boxes show the total width of a line (in characters), excluding any
margin you might have set in printer preferences, and the print pitch
that will be used when printing.  CharGen selects the print pitch (Pica,
Elite or Fine) based on the widths, and the left and right margins you
have set in the printer preferences.


7.6 Show Full Sheet

  Should the full character sheet be visible on the screen ?


7.7 Create Icons
  
  Selecting this will make CharGen create icons for any character it
saves.


7.8 Screen Mode

  Allows you to pick the screen mode CharGen will use.  The screen mode
and screen size are saved in the Settings file, along with window size
and position. Is only available under 2.0+.
  The screen opened by CharGen is a public screen with the name
'CHARGEN.1'.  If CharGen is run again the new screen will have the name
'CHARGEN.2' and so on...


7.9 Font

    7.9.1 Program

  Allows you to pick the font CharGen will use throughout the program,
except for the character sheet (see below).

  Although available font sizes will depend on the size of the screen
CharGen is on, it can still happen that some text or gadgets 'crawls'
out of the window, so after changing fonts, CharGen will resize the
window so that this is unlikely (when possible - if you use large fonts
it might be unavoidable). The program font can be proportional.


    7.9.2 Character

  Allows you to pick the font CharGen will use for the character sheet.
The 'Character' font must be fixed width.


7.10 Palette

  Allows you to change the programs colors.  The color change is
permanent if you save the settings.


7.11 Load Settings

  Loads settings file (including sources).


7.12 Save Settings

  Saves settings file (including sources).

Chapter 8 Tool Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  These tool types can be placed in the CharGen icon using the Info
(Information under WB 2.x) item in the Workbench menu.  You can also use
these tool types if you run from shell (perhaps from the
startup-sequence of a boot disk), Example:

	CharGen PUBSCREEN=Workbench PROGRAMFONT=topaz/11


8.1 PUBSCREEN=<screenname>

  Tells CharGen to open its window on the public screen named (case
sensetive!).  Example:
                          PUBSCREEN=Workbench


8.2 PROGRAMFONT=<font>/<size>

  Selects the program font (see 7.9.1).  Overrides the font saved in the
Settings file.  Do not include ".font" in the font name.  Example:

                        PROGRAMFONT=helvetica/13


8.3 CHARACTERFONT=<font>/<size>

  Selects the character sheet font (see 7.9.2).  Overrides the font
saved in the Settings file.  Do not include ".font" in the font name.
Example:
                        CHARACTERFONT=courier/13


8.4 SETTINGS=<file path>

  Allows you to specify a different settings file to use.  Example:

              SETTINGS=work:AD&D/SpellJammer/CharGen.prefs


8.5 CHARDATA=<directory path>

  Allows you to specify a different directory from which CharGen will
get its data about races, classes,...  This is useful if you run severel
campaigns which differ greatly in races, classes,...  Example:

                CHARDATA=work:AD&D/SpellJammer/CharData


8.6 CHARACTERS=<directory path>

  Allows you to specify a different directory to which CharGen will save
the characters you create.  This is also useful if you run severel
campaigns.  Example:

               CHARACTERS=work:AD&D/SpellJammer/Characters


8.7 SCREEN=<NTSC|PAL|LACE> (not 2.0+)

  Force screen mode selection.  The program detects weather the machine
run in PAL or a NTSC mode, so this tool type is not nessesary for the
ordinary user, but it helps me when I have to check the Gadget layout on
an NTSC screen.  The LACE option can be used with NTSC and PAL in this
way, but is not required:

                            SCREEN=NTSC|LACE
                            SCREEN=PAL|LACE

  or it can be used alone

                              SCREEN=LACE

  If you run in NTSC mode and have an anti-flicker device, then I
strongly recommend that you use the LACE option, as the screen layout
improves (more room for all the gadgets, see also NOSIZE).

  If you use the LACE option you might consider using a larger font,
such as topaz 11, so the text will be easier to read.


8.8 NOSIZE

  If you run CharGen in NTSC, you should use this tool type to remove
the sizing gadget in the lower right corner of the window.  The gadget
layout on a NTSC screen was created with the assumption that you use
this tool type.  This tool type can of course also be used if you don't
run in NTSC, giving you a little more room in the window.

Chapter 9 Program Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The program imposes the following restrictions on the number of:
			
			Races:                32
			Single Classes:       32
			Classes:              80
			Armors:               80
			Weapons:             250
			Proficiencies:       250
			Wizard Schools:      250
			Priesthoods:         250
			Spells:		        2000
			Psionic Powers:      500

    This should be enough to for most people.
