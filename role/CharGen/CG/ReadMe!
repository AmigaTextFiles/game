    Development on the present version of CharGen has stopped. If a future
version of CharGen is relseaed it will be a WB 2.x+ only version.

    For an explanation of what is new, and what is changed in CharGen, I
refer you to the History.doc file.

May 1999

I have taken over the development of CharGen. This is a rerelease of
Version 1.17, as I couldn`t find it on AmiNET.

Please email suggestions to Joooch@gmx.de

Big thanks to Troels.
