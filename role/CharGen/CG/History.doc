                           **** History ****


   CharGen was developed and compiled on an Amiga 3000 with SAS C v6.3.
The program was compiled for all 680x0 cpu's.  It has been tested with
Enforcer on an Amiga 3000 (KS 2.04), and generally on an Amiga 500 (KS
1.3)

   Please note that not all of the following versions have been
released.  I will only release a new version of CharGen when there is
something _signifiantly_ new, or when an annoying bug has been
discovered.

   Reference to specific sections in the CharGen.doc file is for that
version only, and may have changed since.



                                 v1.17
                                 _____

NEW:

 · A new settings switch under Settings/Format/Character controls
   weather the THAC0 or To Hit adjustment should be shown on the
   charactersheet in the 'Hit' colum in the weapons section.

 · Keyboard eqv. for the Ok, Cancel, Continue and Find gadgets shown on
   many screens are implemented (see documentation).

 · Implemented an 'All classes allowed' switch so you can create special
   characters, such as a human Fighter/Mage.

 · All gods from Forgotten Realms Adventures except Tyr entered by
   Victor Alvarez. Also entered a few weapons needed by the Priesthoods.
   (thanks Victor!).

 · Next to the normal thiefskill on the character sheet, will be shown
   the skill the character has when not wearing armor. This is useful if
   the thief has lots of time, and can waste some taking of his armor.

 · An active string gadget will be highlighted.

 · "Copper" added to wealth information, and "At Home" changed to
   "Cache".

CHANGES:

 · A few spelling mistakes corrected: "Rouge" -> "Rogue", "Meele" ->
   "Melee"....

RULES FIXED:

 · The first of the rule fixes for v1.16 (below) introduced a new error:
   Large one-handed weapons (e.g. Javelin) were unavailable to everybody.

 · A priest needs 27500 xp not 27000 xp to reach level 6.

BUGS FIXED:

 · Maximim level for demihumans was not calculated correctly if when a
   character had high prime ability scores.

 · If you didn't select a sex when entering a new character, CharGen
   could crash when selecting a priesthood.



                                 v1.16
                                 _____

NEW:

 · You can now print a characters description, notes and equipment on a
   seperate sheet of paper (see CharGen.doc - Section 2.5.2 and 7.4)

 · Now CharGen can underline every third line when printing spelllists
   (not columns) and psionics, to make the list easier to read (no need
   to use a ruler to keep your eyes on the same line ;-) (see
   CharGen.doc - Section 7.4)

 · The screen opened by CharGen is a public screen under version 2.04+
   of the system software, with the name 'CHARGEN.1'.  If CharGen is run
   again the new screen will have the name 'CHARGEN.2' and so on...  up
   to CHARGEN.9.

 · Pressing the <HELP> key under WB 2.04+ while in the main CharGen
   window bring up the CharGen.guide file on the CharGen screen.

   If you enter a menu item (such as 'Weapons' in the 'Equip' menu) and
   press <HELP> you will be given information about that menu item's
   function.

   If you select a menu item and press <HELP> (while still holding the
   right mouse button depressed over the menu item) you will be given
   information about that menu item.

   To use this feature you must have the amigaguide.library installed.

   The doc file was converted to amigeguide format for this purpose by
   Lars Meldgård (thanks Lars!).

 · It is now possible to edit the wealth information.

 · All Greek priesthoods from Legends & Lore 2.Edition have been entered
   into CharGen.

CHANGES: 

 · Compiled with SAS/C 6.3.

 · Now allocates a new stack on startup, if the supplied stack is to
   small (less than 10Kb).  This feature was broken in previous versions
   of SAS/C.

 · Minor changes in the Settings menu.

BUGS FIXED:

 · Would crash when printing a character under version 1.3 of the system
   software.

 · Would crash if there wasn't enough memory for loading the datafiles.

 · Removed all known Enforcer hits.

RULES FIXED:

 · Would allow small races to use some weapons one-handed, that were to
   large for use in just one hand.

 · When a new character was created, spells of the thought and numbers
   spheres were selected before the intelligence of the character was
   known, thus CharGen would use a wrong intelligence when the option
   'Int 13 for Thought and Numbers' was used.



                            v1.15 (released)
                            ________________

NEW:

 · Implemented 'Abilities, Psionics' (see CharGen.doc - Section 5.6).

 · Implemented 'Project, Print (Psionics)'.

CHANGES:

 · CharGen now cannot load characters saved by pre v1.00 versions of
   CharGen.  If you have some of these, I suggest that you load them
   into CharGen v1.01-1.13 and save them.  They should then be loadable
   by this (and future) versions of CharGen.

 · The size of a person (which is used for determining which weapons can
   be used and how) is now calculated from the person's height and not
   from the average racial height, thus a very large (higher than 4' =
   medium size) halfling can use a scimitar (also medium size).  I have
   used the height intervals from Monstrous Compendium (see CharGen.doc
   - Section 4.2).



                        v1.14 (private release)
                        _______________________

NEW: 

 · Added the Psionicist, Fighter/Psionicist and Psionicist/Thief
   classes.

 · Created 'Design, Psionics...'.  This version does not allow you
   to select or print psionic powers, merely to design them.

 · All Psionic powers from The Complete Psionics Handbook and Dragon
   Kings entered into CharGen (by Rasmus Hansen.  Thanks Rasmus!)

 · Spells from 'Forbidden Lore' entered into CharGen (also by Rasmus).

CHANGES:

 · Minor cosmetic changes to the menu layout.

BUGS FIXED:

 · Level calculated wrongly for high-level demihumans above their normal
   maximum level, when using the 'Slow, unlimited advancement' option.

 · Didn't clear the source gadget when creating new spells.

 · It was possible to design a new spell that didn't belong to any
   Priest Sphere or Wizard School.



                            v1.13 (released)
                            ________________

BUGS FIXED:

 · Sometimes didn't recognise when an armor made up of parts was in fact
   a full suit of armor.

RULES FIXED:

 · Arrghhhhhh....  While the Chapter 6: Money and Equipment of the PHB
   only mentions a damage bonus on bows for strength, Chapter 9: Combat
   says, that if you have a properly prepared bow, you get both attack
   roll and damage bonus's for strength.  Accordingly the option 'No
   bonus for str.  on bow damage' has been changed to 'No bonus for
   strength on bows', and CharGen now adjusts both attack roll and
   damage bonus for strength, unless you select this option.
