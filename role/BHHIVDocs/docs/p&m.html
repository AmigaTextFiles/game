The player editor sould be fairly intuitive I hope! Most of the string gadgets
at least sould be obvious. The less obvious being the NP penalty, these values
can be found in players hand book sections on weapon proficiencies.
<p>
A note on the stats, when entering a new character, or any time when the Max points 
field is 0 entering a value in the Hit Points gadget will also place this in the 
Max Points field.
<p>
Both the Hit Points field and the XP field have limited support for math functions, so
that you may enter +5 to add five points, or -20 to subbtract 20.  This can either be 
placed in the gadget after the current value (ie: 35+5) or on it's own. It is not 
possible to set the Hit Points field above the Max Points value.
