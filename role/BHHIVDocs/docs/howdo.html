<a name=instal><h3>Installation</h3></a>
<p>
Installing Bigby's Helping Hand - IV is rather simple, and if you follow the
steps described below there should be no trouble.
<ol>
<li>Find a place to unpack the BHHIV.lha file.  The 'where' is not important,
nor is the name.  Into this 'place' will go the BHH Drawer.
<li>Add the system ASSIGN BHH: to the drawer BHH.
<li>Copy the fonts to your system Fonts: assign.  Rember to update any cache
you might have installed.
<li>Double click on the BHHIV icon.  A note about the icons.  I am useing the
NewIcons patch and as shuch the normal icons will appear as a small square.
Sorry for all the MagicWB fans, but I have no MWB icons.  Feel free do design
you own.
</ol>
<ul>
<img align=middle src=warn.gif>An important note about the GUI.
<p>
I have tweeked 
some of the cycle gadgets to work in a different manner, and these will need a cycle
to menu utilitie.  I have found that the cycle to menu used with MCP and the likes does 
not handle this to well, nore does it handle more then 39 items in a cycle gadget.  Use 
a stand alone commoditie for best results.
</ul>
<p>
The window should open on your WB screen and shortly after it's own screen
should appear.  Unfortunatly this and other windows that open on the WB screen
can look a little strange, this is because I use 'sysihack' to modify the
borders of the windows on my system.  I feel that the 2 point borders look
silly and wimpish.  A nice even 4 points all around looks much nicer.  But hey,
thats just my opinion, it need not be yours.

<a name=howto><h3>Now, how to use it</h3></a>
<p>
Opon loading you will be presented with the Bigby's Helping Hand - IV screen.
In the middle of this will be the 'About' window.  Click on it and you are left
with the screen.  It probably has already loaded the D&D.Party.  
<p>
The screen is devided into three parts.  The party information is at the top,
in the middle we have the control section and below this the monster section.
<p>
The <a href=p&m.html>party and monster sections</a> differ only in apperance, so I shall cover them
togeather.  The <a href=control.html>controls</a> will be dealt with later.  Now lets tour the menus.
<h4>The 'Project' menu</h4>

<dl>
<dt><img align=middle src=b.gif>Open<br>
<p>  
<dd>Character
<dd>Adds a single Character from one of the saved parties to the current party.
<p>
<dd>Load into
<dd>Adds an encounter to the existing encounter, alows for extra troops to
arrive after the start of combat.
<p>
<dd><a href=#calendar>Calendar</a>
<dd>Loads in custom calendar files.
<p>
<dd><a href=#events>Events</a>
<dd>Adds an events file to the current events list.
<p>
<dt><img align=middle src=b.gif>Save<br>  
<dd>Encounter
<dd>Saves either the Party or Encounter.  When saving an Encounter do not 
include the .Encounter extension.  (lazy programmer has not fixed it yet)  
<p>
<dt><a name=backup><img align=middle src=b.gif>Restore</a><br>
<dd>Backup A
<dd>Backup B
<dd>At the end of every combat 'round' Bigby's Helping Hand - IV saves the HP
of every Player Character and Monster.  The file it is saved in is writen to
the <a href=#output>BHH_(date)</a> file in T:  Should the computer crash or
there is an interuption to the power supply, simply load up the party, load the
encounter and select the correct Backup and all the HP will be restored as at
the end of the last round.
<p>
</dl>
<h4>The 'Edit' menu</h4>
<dl>
<dt><img align=middle src=b.gif><a href=items.html>Items</a>
<dt><img align=middle src=b.gif><a href=#events>Events</a>
</dl>
<h4>The 'Tools menu</h4> 
<dl>
<dt><img align=middle src=b.gif><a href=#calendar>Calendar</a>
<dt><img align=middle src=b.gif><a href=dice.html>Dice</a>
<dt><img align=middle src=b.gif><a href=#events>Events</a>
<dt><img align=middle src=b.gif><a href=movement.html>Movement</a>
<dt><img align=middle src=b.gif><a href=potion.html>Potion</a> 
</dl>  
<h4>The 'Game' menu</h4>
<p>
<dl>
<dt><img align=middle src=b.gif>Share Remaining XP
<dd>When a monster is 'killed' Bigby's Helping Hand - IV adds the XP to the
players total,  when the DM decideds that an encounter has been defeated but
some monsters still remain he may select this item and share the XP of the
remaining monsters with the party.
<p>
<dt><img align=middle src=b.gif>Add XP...
<dd>This brings up a requester, enter the total amount of XP for the party.
This is then shared by the whole party. 
</dl> 


<h4>The 'Options' menu</h4>  
  
The options are fairly self explanitory, and are saved when you Quit Bigby's
Helping Hand - IV.  Only the first two might need an explination.
<p>
<dl>
<dt><img align=middle src=b.gif>KO PC's Share XP
<dd>When this option is checked any PC who is between 0 and -10
HP will still gain XP for monster that die or when either of the XP items from
the Game menu are chosen.
<p>
<dt><img align=middle src=b.gif>PC's Share Monster Kills
<dd>When this item is checked PC's gain experence when a monster kills another
monster.  Why?  I actually have no idea!  But it's there if you want it.  
</dl>

<a name=output><h3>The 'Print out'</h3></a>
<p>
Bigby's Helping Hand - IV writes an output file labled BHH_(date) where the
(date) is the current system date.  This file is mainly for debuging during
development, but has been included here as some of my players offten ask 'How
did they do that' and I have to lookit up and say 'well, they needed a 19 or
better to hit and they rolled 19'.  You know how it is, it's ok in the players
eyes for a monster to get a thrashing but not for them to give one.
<p>
This file will look something like this.  The (on #) refers to the initiative
and weapon speed of the attacker.  Where the file begins with a number (ie: 2:)
it is the number of the monster attacking.  This is because I often have 5 or 6
goblins all called 'Goblin'
