<p>
Potion is a small description generator for DM's who would like to add a little 
flavour and aroma to their campaign.
<p>
Run either by the Workbench Icon or from a menu in Bigby's Helping Hand - IV,
Potion will attempt to open on Bigby's Helping Hand - IV's screen, failing this
it will then open on the Workbench screen.  
<p>
There is one string gadget and one menu option.  Enter a name in  the string 
gadget and press return.  A description is generated randomly, though each time
you re-enter the same name the description will be the same.  The Menu option
'containers' when checked will also repeat the container description.
