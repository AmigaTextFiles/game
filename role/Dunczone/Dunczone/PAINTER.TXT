 This game is really quite bad. In fact
 it's SHITE- hence the name. In the  
 game you also control a small piece of
 turd.                       
 
 Use your joystick to guide the little
 plop. Press ESC during play to quit
 (if you're really lame)   

 Watch out for those red things     
 though, they'll kill you if you 
 hit them.            

 Make a line around the boxes to reveal
 a picture. Uncover them all to win.               

 ( press fire, you thick or somethink )
