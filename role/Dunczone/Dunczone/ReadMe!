This game is a kind of parody-translation of a German game called "snackzone",
on the Aminet in game/role with the short (and rather smug) description
"Promotional adventure game. German. Good!". Basically, I've taken a German PD
game, played through it, seen what happens after each thing is said, and then
changed what is said to an English sentence which would explain the result.
(If you understood all of that first time, I suggest you go and have a lie
down.) Some of the pictures have also been changed.

If you like this game, I have some other half-to-three-quarters finished games
in the same vein(ie. "creative translations"). These are:

 ORIGINAL                         CREATIVE TRANSLATION     % COMPLETE
 Backstage                        Duncstage                75
 Das Erbe 2                       <unsure name>            99
 Erben der Erde AGA (demo)        Essen der Erde           60-70

If you want me to complete these then mail me(I will anyway, but mailing me
will speed it up a lot)at duncan@grignr.abelgratis.com. (Please note that at
the time of writing (3/8/99, 1:49am) this e-mail address is not yet set up.
However, when it is set up, that is what it will be.)

This game does contain a fair (!) amount of bad language. Whether or not this
is a problem is up to you, but I would advise any parents to check the game
before allowing their kids to play it.
