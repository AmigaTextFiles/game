Character sheets for 1st Edition Advanced Dungeons and Dragons

These are some character sheets that I created way back when with
Pagestream 1.8 on my A2000 (without a flickerfixer back then).

Still however, I think they came out very good and are still usable. I`ll 
let you all be the judge of that. 

There are 2 files Character.p2 is in the old Pagestream 2 format and
Character.p4 is in the new Pagestream4 format. I did some touching up on 
this one. The P2 file is still the way it was the last time I loaded it 
into P2.

This software is Notifyware. If you use it then you must notify me and let
me know. I think that is cheap enough. :)
