    @{b}Angband@{ub}
    @{b}~~~~~~~@{ub}
    Angband is a single player role playing game. You choose a race and a
    class, then roll up statistics to describe your various abilities. Then
    you're unleashed upon the dungeons of Angband, ultimately dropping to
    dungeon level 100 and trying your damndest to kill Morgoth, Lord of
    Darkness.

    Along the way you encounter a myriad of creatures and uniques to hinder
    your progress, and objects and artifacts to help you achieve your goals.

    Angband is loosely based on the works of JRR Tolkein, and had the game
    Rogue as an ancestor, hence the term 'roguelike' that is encountered in
    this guide and many other documents relating to Angband and it's variants.

    Angband is constantly under development, and has been since it came out
    in its most basic form back in 1985.

    @{b}Zangband@{ub}
    @{b}~~~~~~~~@{ub}
    Zangband is an Angband variant. This is probably the most radically
    different variant available, and in my opinion is the best around, even
    beating plain old vanilla. The Z is for Zelazny, as Zangband is based
    around Roger Zelazny's 'Amber' universe. The game has a revolutionary new
    magic system derived from the game 'Master of Magic'. Other than this, the
    game now has 26 race types, each having their own special abilities as
    they reach certain levels, loads more monsters, a HUGE array of vaults of
    all sizes, random artifacts in addition to the traditional set, new
    objects, new player and object flags, and a new goal at the end of the
    game. 

    For full details of all the changes made to Zangband throughout it's
    history, please consult the @{"z_update.txt" link "z_update.txt/MAIN"} file, either via the link in
    the guide or by perusing the file itself which you will find in the
    game directory.

@node "Requirements" "Requirements..."

    @{b}Requirements@{ub}
    @{b}~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ub}

    @{b}Absolute Minimum@{ub}
    @{b}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ub}
    You'll need at @{b}least@{ub} this to run plain Zangband.

    o  Kickstart 1.3
    o  1.4 Mb of memory
    o  68000 - a faster processor is nice, but by no means necessary.

    To run a borg compiled executable, you`ll need at least 2Mb of free
    memory, and a fast processor would definitely be a bonus too.

    @{b}Recommended Level@{ub}
    @{b}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ub}
    This is what is recommend to get the most out of Angband:

    o  Kickstart 3.0 or better
    o  2Mb of memory
    o  68020 or better.
    o  A Hard drive.

    Running Angband and it's variants under kickstart 1.3 is somewhat
    restricted. Mark doesn't plan to support 1.3 further, and the assumption
    will be made that everyone is using 2.04 or better. Don't worry though,
    the game will still work under 1.3, it'll just do so without the bells,
    whistles and shiny bits that Mark's put together for those of us that
    aren't living in the stone age...

    Machines that Zangband have been tested on;

    o    A1200T, 68040/25, 603e/200, 32Mb FAST, 24xCDROM, 2.1Gb HD (Mark)
    o    A1200, 68060/50, 603e/200, 32Mb FAST, 5.04Gb HD (Bablos)

@node "Installation" "Installing Zangband"

    @{b}Installing Zangband@{ub}
    @{b}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ub}

    @{b}Installing to Hard disc@{ub}
    @{b}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ub}
    Couldn't be easier - just unpack the archive to the directory of your
    choice! Then it all depends on what kickstart your machine has;

    o @{b}KS 2.0+@{ub}
      If you're lucky enough to have a kickstart 2.0 or better machine, then
      all you need to do to get Zangband up and running is to run the program
      bin/Zangband.

    o @{b}KS 1.3@{ub}
      If you only have Kickstart 1.3, you'll also need to place a few
      commands into your S:startup-sequence file, or make a script file if
      you're feeling particularly adventurous and execute it as and when you
      intend to play Zangband. Anyway, the commands required are;

      assign Zangband: DH1:Games/Zangband
      path add Zangband:bin

      Obviously, replace the DH1:Games/Zangband with the path to the Zangband
      directory on your system. Make sure that this new Zangband: assignment
      points to the right place! It should point to the main directory
      containing all the file, data, apex, raw etc. directories.

    @{b}Floppy installation@{ub}
    @{b}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ub}
    What, no hard drive? Never mind. You can @{i}just about@{ui} install Zangband
    onto floppy discs, but it's a tight fit. Your friendly neighbourhood
    compression programs might help you out here.

    First get two empty, formatted discs. Name the first one 'Zangband', and
    call the second 'AMain', 'Winifred' or whatever takes your fancy. Once
    your archive has been extracted, copy the contents of the 'bin' directory
    to the 'AMain' disc. All the other bits go on the 'Zangband' disc.

    Problems fitting everything onto that second disc? Don't worry. All the
    files aren't essential. You can lose any of the sound files from
    xtra/sound, or the help files which are cunningly hidden in /help.

    Practically everyone has a hard drive in this day and age, but if you're
    still running off floppies and having trouble persuading Zangband to
    become floppy based, mail Mark and I'm sure he'd be more than happy to
    help.

    @{b}Playing Zangband@{ub}
    @{b}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ub}
    If everything went well, and you successfully installed the game, then
    all you need do is run the bin/Zangband executable. Zangband automatically
    loads in the previously saved character, but you can change this if
    needs be using the -u command;

    o Zangband -u<char>

    So, if you wanted to load up Sharon the Half-Troll Warrior, you'd type
    the command Zangband -uSharon. Simple, huh? Typing Zangband -? will give
    you a list of the options available.

@node "Settings" "Settings"

    @{b}Settings@{ub}
    @{b}~~~~~~~~@{ub}
    Angband and it's variants need to know how to set themselves up, what with
    screenmode, graphics, sound, menus, windows - it's all user configurable.
    The configuration for this is read from the settings.prf file, which can
    be found in the /user directory. Below is a brief description of the
    various settings available and how they can help to make your gaming
    experience that little bit easier. All of the settings are optional, and
    have their own default settings.

    o @{b}ANGBAND.gfx@{ub}
      Do you want graphics or just plain ASCII?  Rogue old timers and users
      that find the graphics version a tad slow on 68000 machines may well
      benefit from setting this to Y.  Set to N for ASCII, Y for 8x8 bitmap,
      E for 16x16 bitmap and A for autoscale. Check to see if the latter two
      options are available.

    o @{b}ANGBAND.sound@{ub}
      Do you want to include sound in the game?  Floppy users will have no
      choice but to leave sounds out.  Individual sounds can be removed, see
      the section of the documentation on sound for that.  Set to Y or N.

    o @{b}ANGBAND.version@{ub}
      The version of the game that you're playing. A setting used by the
      AngMan program for determining the type of variant being played.
      Optional.

    o @{b}SCREEN.blankmouse@{ub}
      Blanks the mouse pointer as and when a key is pressed.  Saves mouse
      pointer getting in the way whilst you're playing the game. Set to Y or N.

    o @{b}SCREEN.menus@{ub}
      Use the pull down menus or not?  Set to Y or N.

    o @{b}SCREEN.quick@{ub}
      Quick graphics - can speed things up on 68020+/AGA machines. Set to Y/N.

    o @{b}SCREEN.rtg@{ub}
      Use RTG system for screen display? Set to Y or N.

    o @{b}SCREEN.name@{ub}
      If you've made a custom screen for Angband to display on, then you
      provide the name of the screen after this setting.

    o @{b}SCREEN.mode@{ub}
      Choose the screenmode that the Angband public screen will open under.
      Set to the mode value or ? to have a screenmode requester pop up.

    o @{b}SCREEN.width@{ub}
      Width of the public screen in pixels. Minimun default of 640.

    o @{b}SCREEN.height@{ub}
      Height of the public screen in pixels. Minimum default of 200.

    o @{b}SCREEN.depth@{ub}
      Depth of the public screen in bitmaps.

    o @{b}SCREEN.overscan@{ub}
      Screens overscan settings. Set to 1 for text size, 2 for graphics size,
      3 for extreme size and 4 for maximum size.

    @{b}Window Options@{ub}
    @{b}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ub}
    Angband and it's variants has the choice of using up to eight different
    windows to display all of it's information. The use of MAIN is an
    absolute necessity, but the use of CHOICE, RECALL, MIRROR, WIN5TH, WIN6TH,
    WIN7TH and WIN8TH are all optional. They come into their own when used
    with high screen resolutions, as they can be used to constantly display
    information which you would otherwise have to access via options - keep
    a list of your inventory in one, a list of your equipment in another, a
    list of all past messages in a third - the choice is yours. What the
    window actually displays is set from within Angband itself via the options
    menu (= command). Their settings and positions can also be saved from the
    pull down menus in Angband too.

    @{b}MAIN Window@{ub}
    @{b}~~~~~~~~~~~@{ub}
    o @{b}MAIN.use@{ub}
      Should the main window be displayed?  Should be set to Y at all times,
      otherwise you've no chance of seeing a single thing!

    o @{b}MAIN.title@{ub}
      The main windows title, to be displayed in the title bar if on a custom
      screen.

    o @{b}MAIN.font@{ub}
      Font to use with the main window. Defaults to topaz/8.

    o @{b}MAIN.xpos@{ub}
      X-axis offset for the main window from the top left of the screen. Set
      with number of pixels.

    o @{b}MAIN.ypos@{ub}
      Y-axis offset for the main window from the top left of the screen. Set
      with number of pixels.

    o @{b}MAIN.cols@{ub}
      Number of text columns that the main window has. Must be set to at
      least 80.

    o @{b}MAIN.rows@{ub}
      Number of text rows that the main window has. Must be set to at
      least 80.

    o @{b}MAIN.background@{ub}
      Path to a file that is used as a background pattern for the main
      window. This option is only active in current versions of Angband and
      it's variants.

    @{b}Other Windows@{ub}
    @{b}~~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ub}
    In the example below, I've used the window CHOICE, but this can be
    substituted for any of the remaining windows as they're all defined in
    exactly the same way.

    o @{b}CHOICE.use@{ub}
      Same as for MAIN. Should the window be used? Set to Y or N.

    o @{b}CHOICE.show@{ub}
      Should the window be displayed? Set to Y or N.

    o @{b}CHOICE.title@{ub}
      Same as for MAIN. The title of the window to be displayed.

    o @{b}CHOICE.font@{ub}
      Same as for MAIN. The choice of font that will be used in the window.

    o @{b}CHOICE.scroll@{ub}
      Should the window have a scroll bar? Set to Y or N.

    o @{b}CHOICE.xpos@{ub}
      Same as for MAIN. X-axis offset from the topleft of the screen.

    o @{b}CHOICE.ypos@{ub}
      Same as for MAIN. Y-axis offset from the topleft of the screen.

    o @{b}CHOICE.cols@{ub}
      Same as for MAIN. Number of columns of text to display.

    o @{b}CHOICE.rows@{ub}
      Same as for MAIN. Number of rows of text to display.

    o @{b}CHOICE.background@{ub}
      Same as for MAIN. Choose a background pattern.

    @{b}Borg Options@{ub}
    @{b}~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ub}
    A Borg is a piece of code that will play Angband or it's variants all on
    it's own. If your current version of Angband has been compiled with a Borg
    included, then you will be able to use the following options;

    o @{b}BORG.turns@{ub}
      How frequently the display is updated, in turns. Can be set to anything
      up to every 500 turns.

    o @{b}BORG.keycheck@{ub}
      How the user can interrupt the Borgs game. Can be set to delayed,
      normal or joybutton.

@node "Inscriptions" "Inscriptions"

    @{b}Inscriptions@{ub}
    @{b}~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ub}
    Inscriptions are a pretty useful part of Angband and it's variants, so
    long as you know how to make the most of them. Once you've been playing
    the game for a bit, you'll be used to the standard inscriptions that
    objects have - telling you when they're cursed or uncursed, your pseudo-id
    kicking in to announce that an object is terrible, worthless, average,
    good, excellent or special. Shopkeepers will inscribe items with any
    special offers they might have going. You might even get imaginative
    yourself and decide that Brian the Broadsword should have his name
    enblazoned across his blade. Well, written in braces next to his
    inventory slot!

    @{b}Protecting Items@{ub}
    @{b}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ub}
    Inscriptions can help you protect your items from any inadvertant
    keypresses your impatient fingers may be capable of. Once you become adept
    at the controls of Angband, and could guide a character with your eyes
    closed, or in your sleep, you'll soon discover that it's all too easy to
    destroy, drop, activate, fire, etc that one item that you just can't do
    without. How do you get around this?  Use the following inscription;

    o @{b}!X@{ub} where X is the command to protect the item from.

    So, if you inscribe an item with !d, you'll be asked if you really do want
    to drop that particular object. If one check isn't enough, you can add
    multiple inscriptions of the same type - inscribing !d!d!d will ask you
    about dropping the object three times over. You may think it overkill, but
    you don't want to go dropping plenty of things in the lower depths of the
    dungeons of Angband.

    You can combine the !X commands - if you inscribe !d!k, then you'll be
    asked again if you try to either drop or destroy the item. If you need
    FULL protection, you can use !*, which will ask for verification no matter
    which command is used upon the item in question.

    @{b}Roguelike Keyset Users@{ub} - you'll have to inscribe the original commands, not
    the roguelike ones, unfortunately.

    @{b}Numbering Items@{ub}
    @{b}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ub}
    Inscriptions of the following form are incredibly useful when combined
    with macros. They assign a number to a particular item, thus;

    o @{b}@n@{ub} where n is a number between 0 and 9.

    What use is this? Well, say you have a particular wand or staff that you
    use all the time. Instead of having to check your inventory to see which
    slot it's in when you want to use it, you could inscribe it with @1 which
    would let you select it by using the number 1 in with your command. You
    can also restrict what commands use the numbered item;

    o @{b}@Xn@{ub} where n is a number between 0 and 9, and X is a command.

    This will cause the item to only be referred to as this particular number
    by the command X. A fine example of this is the one macro that's
    automatically defined in all Angband variants - if you inscribe your main
    weapon as @0, and your shovel, pick or secondary weapon as @0 also, the
    command X will swap between these two items for you.

@endnode

@node "Macros" "Macros"

    @{b}Macros & Keymaps@{ub}
    @{b}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ub}
    Macros are mappings from a single logical keypress to a sequence of
    keypresses, allowing you to use special keys on the keyboard such as
    function keys or the keypad, to automate repetitive multi-keypress
    commands that you use alot.

    The macro system has changed between Angband 2.8.2 and 2.8.3, and some
    older variants are still based on the 2.8.2 code. I shall concentrate on
    the 2.8.3 code here, and direct users of the older system to the file
    help/command.txt, which should contain details on the old macro system.

    Macro and keymap definitons are kept in what are called user pref files,
    which can be found in the user/ directory, funnily enough. Specific .prf
    files are loaded in with each character - if you run a human priest called
    Kenneth, then the files human.prf, priest.prf and Kenneth.prf would all be
    loaded. You can thus have similar macros and keymaps together - spell
    macros could be in priest.prf, and macros you wanted humans to have in
    general could go in human.prf, and any specific to just this character -
    say to activate a particularly good item they have - would go in
    Kenneth.prf.

    So, how do you define macros and keymaps? Both of them need an action;

    o @{b}A:<action>@{ub} - this is the definition of the action the keymap/macro
                   will expand to.

    To define a macro to perform the above action you would follow the action
    definiton line with;

    o @{b}P:<str>@{ub} - str is the sequence of keypresses that would perform
                the action.

    If, however, you wanted to define the above action as a keymap, then you'd
    follow it's definition with the line;

    o @{b}C:<mode>:<keystr>@{ub} - mode is the keymap mode where the keymap will take
                          effect (0 for original and 1 for roguelike) and
                          keystr is a string that translates to one key. Note
                          that Ctrl-<char> is considered one key, but function
                          keys aren't.

    So, a macro is defined by;

    o @{b}A:<action>@{ub}
      @{b}P:<str>@{ub}

    and a keymap by;

    o @{b}A:<action>@{ub}
      @{b}C:<mode>:<keystr>@{ub}

    Whenever macros need to contain special characters, they are represented
    in a specific way, thus;

    o \xHH - character number HH in hexadecimal
    o \NNN - character number NNN in octal
    o \e - ESC
    o \n - newline
    o \r - RETURN
    o \s - space
    o \\ - backslash
    o \^ - caret
    o ^X - code for any control key "ctrl-X"

    So, what's the difference between the two? Why choose a macro definition
    over a keymap definition, or vice versa? There are three main differences;

    o Keymaps don't get executed in stores, macros do. Imagine having 'u' set
      up as a macro, then trying to sell item 'u' in your inventory - as you
      hit u, up sprouts your macro string! You can't sell item u!

    o Keymaps are defined as one key, but macros can be triggered by an
      arbitary number of keys. As function keys are considered more than one
      keypress, anything you bind to a function key has to be a macro.

    o Keymaps can be different depending on the mode - original or roguelike.
      Macros use original commands.

    Examples; well, ones that I use..

    Activate light source - this is a macro which uses F1 for when I have the
    Phial of Galadriel. It can't be defined as a keymap as the code for the
    F1 key isn't a single key. Not that it stops anyone else using another
    key, or course!

    o A:\e\eAf\e
      P:\x9B0~

    Kill top item on the floor - I played the `bands for SO long without
    knowing how useful this little one could be. If you've got a pile of stuff
    on the floor, and you know the top three items are useless, just stand on
    it and hammer the key three times, and they're destroyed. Very useful for
    going through good sized treasure hoardes.

    Macro;

    o A:\e\e^d-yy\r
      P:`

    Keymap;

    o A:\e\e^d-yy\r
      C:0:`

    I use a keymap in the above example, as a) it's simpler, and b) you don't
    have to rely on the ` key in stores whatsoever. I map it to the ` key as I
    use the roguelike command set, and so I can hit it with my left hand whilst
    controlling the character with my right. If you use the original command
    set, and you use the keypad, you might find it easier to maybe set up F10
    as the macro. Why all the \e in the commands? It's to flush the output
    buffer of any text it might display, and to get rid of any -more- messages.
    Some people use \s too, as it performs the same task, so long as you have
    quick messages activated in your options.

    Example using numbered inscriptions;

    Say you have a Rod of Trap Detection inscribed with @z1, and a Rod of
    Detect Doors and Stairs inscribed with @z2. You could combine the
    activation of the two by pressing F1 by setting up the macro;

    o A:\e\ea1\ea2
      P:\x9B0~

    \e\e will clear the output buffer of any existing messages that have yet
    to be displayed, a1 will activate rod 1 (trap detection, irrespective of
    it's location in the inventory), \e will clear the result of the
    activation of rod 1, a2 will activate rod 2 (doors and stairs). Easy, huh?

@node "Variants" "Variants"

    @{b}Variants@{ub}
    @{b}~~~~~~~~@{ub}
    Sure, Angband is a great game, but there are people out there who want
    more. People who want to personalise the game, make their own alterations,
    or take it in a completely new direction. If they're lucky enough to be
    familiar with programming C, then all they need do is alter the source
    code and a new variant is born.

    What follows is an exhaustive list of the variants available. Unfortunately
    (fortunately in some cases) they're not all available for the Amiga. Those
    that are can be found in bold type. Check out the links section of the
    documentation if you'd like to know more about any of the variants below.

    o Angband/64 - lots more traps, bigger dungeons, reformed spell system.

    o AngbandTk - Angband with a swanky graphical system written in TCL 8.0.

    @{b}Credits@{ub}

    o @{b}Mark Howson@{ub} <Mark.Howson@nottingham.ac.uk>
      Mark maintains all of the ports of Angband and it's variants that
      are currently available. Mark took on development from Lars'
      2.7.9v6 Angband code, and things have just grown exponentially
      since then. In amongst the Amiga ports, he also manages to be the
      official maintainer of Kangband, believe it or not!

    o @{b}Ben Harrison@{ub} <benh@phial.com>
      Ben is the current maintainer of Angband. See the official website
      at http://www.phial.com/angband for more information on the history
      and current status of Angband.

    o @{b}Robert Ruehlmann@{ub} <rr9@angband.org>
      Robert is the current maintainer of Zangband. He took ovee from Topi
      Ylinen, who had to abandon the game due to real life taking over his
      spare time. Topi still has a great deal of input with regards to the
      direction of the game, though...

    o @{b}Lars Haugseth@{ub} <larshau@ifi.uio.no>
      Lars wrote the original Amiga Angband source code.

    o @{b}Torben Kristiansen, James Larimer and Thomas H. Davies.@{ub}
      The original Amiga Angband graphics were designed by these guys.

    o @{b}Bablos@{ub} <bablos@cableinet.co.uk>
      Me. I wrote this documentation (well, the bits that I didn't rip
      off Mark's initial efforts!), I upload the variant archives to
      Aminet, I beta test both 0x0 and PPC versions, and I run the
      Angband Variants Website - I'd best not plug it again in these
      docs, as Mark will want to hit me with a large stick...

    @{b}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ub}

    Got something to say? Like to buy Mark a pint or a Mars Bar for his
    wonderful work? Head full of suggestions, questions, comments,
    criticism, improvements or insults? If so, Mark wants to hear it.

    Start up your favourite email client and drop him a line at;

    o @{b}Mark.Howson@nottingham.ac.uk@{ub}

    Mark wants people to understand that he didn't actually write any
    of the ports available, he just converts them for our use. Any bugs
    that are obviously specific to the code and not the Amiga version
    should be directed towards the original author via email or the
    newsgroup.

    Should you have the need to contact my good self, be it suggestions
    for additions to the documentation, questions regarding the Aminet
    uploads, or adoration of my web page, you can find me at;

@node "borg" "The Borg"

    @{b}The Borg@{ub}
    @{b}~~~~~~~~@{ub}
    The Borg is an automatic Angband player, ie. the computer will play
    Angband and it's variants as if it was a human player, making decisions
    on its own.

    o The borg will not be getting support - Mark says "I'll fix the Amiga
      code bugs, and I'll look into fixing main source code ones (or report
      them to Ben), but I don't want to get into debugging the thing."

    o The borg needs at least 2Mb of memory, and at least a 68020 to be
      usable.

    What follows is a list of the basic commands for the borg. Should you
    want to know more, I suggest you aim your queries at the borg source
    code.

    Use Ctrl-Z to activate the borg, reply yes to the warning messages, and
    then press 'z' to start the borg running. It will stop when you press a
    key, so you can play the game yourself for a while and then let the borg
    takeover.

    o Note - You can`t have graphics & the borg at the same time - you @{b}must@{ub}
      turn graphics off first. If you can, open up a couple of extra windows
      for the borg messages/status.

    The rest of the borg commands are documented internally - type Ctrl-Z ?
    for a simple summary. But I will mention here the `f` command, which can
    be used to save the borg whenever it changes level or depth. Use `fs` or
    `fd`.

    There are a great many more commands than this - refer to `borg9.c` for
    a more thorough explanation. If you can`t read C, get in touch with Mark.

    Oh, and the borg @{b}does@{ub} seem to crash occasionally. I`ve left it running
    overnight without problems, but it may hang once or twice. You have been
    warned - don`t leave anything really important unsaved in the background.
    I'm sorry about this, but I think this is a borg bug, rather than an
    Amiga one. And whatever it is, it`ll be @{b}VERY@{ub} hard to find. Don`t let that
    put you off - it seems to be fairly stable. More so than some Amiga
    programs I could mention!
