Notes
-----

o  This is a somewhat experimental PPC version. There is already a (more or
   less complete) AngbandPPC + borg, but Zang hasn't been tested or developed
   anywhere near as much. There is considerable room for improvement, but I
   won't be fixing anything until I know people are actually playing it :)

o  The SCREEN.quick option is somewhat dodgy. If you have an AGA machine,
   you can use it, but it isn't perfect. Also note that SCREEN.quick Y with
   text mode will automatically use topaz/8 - you cannot change this. Consider
   SCREEN.quick a development option...

o  You may find graphics are slower than normal; there is very little I can
   do about this...Believe it or not, the routine for this has already
   been optimised - you should have seen how it was before. If you have an
   AGA machine, try the SCREEN.quick Y option.

o  'Equippy' Inventory/Equipment/Store lists don't work properly in the PPC
   version (the background won't be masked off). I expect I'll get around
   to fixing this eventually.

Thanks to the AngbandPPC beta testers, Bablos and Svein Johansen.

If anyone uses this, and thinks it would be worthwhile to develop this
further/continue PPC releases, let me know, otherwise I'll stop ;)
