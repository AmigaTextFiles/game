InformTool V1.1

You may have seen a previous incarnation of InformTool.  Since then, I've
taken a couple users' suggestions and added a bit to it.

Disclaimer

I am not responsible for anything you do to your Amiga, your brain, or your
family members or any other such nonsense.  I am not liable if you do
something dopey and format your hard drive.  I am not at fault if taxes are
raised or if somebody swipes your CD player.

Requirements

Reqtools Library is needed.  You might want a copy of Inform, the Infocom
Adventure writing compiler.  You'll probably also want a version of
Z-Machine or some other Infocom player.

Use

Click on the FBN Icon to get the program going.  You can abort the info
screen after three seconds by pressing a key.  If you don't, it will go
away on its own after a while.

InformTool will check to see if there is a previous session's settings in
your S: directory.  If not, you'll have to set the paths.  InformTool will
save your paths before beginning compiling.  [It used to erase them after
each compile.  What a pain.]  To set the paths, use the pulldown menu [Hold
the right mouse button, fool!].  A requester will pop up with instructions
on what file to select [for the Inform and Inform Library files].

Due to the funkiness of AMOS Pro, the Inform output is not displayed on the
screen as it compiles, but is saved to RAM: for later perusal.  There will
be a tone when the compile is finished.

Menu

Set Inform Path      - Tell the InformTool where your copy of Inform is
Set Library Path     - Tell the InformTool where your Inform Library is
Set Source File      - Set file to compile
Set Destination File - Set destination name and directory
Compile              - Attempt to compile the source
About                - Same as the info screen at program start
View Compiler Log    - See the results of your compile attempt
Quit                 - Um, I'm not sure

Freeware

This program is freeware.  That means, as long as the archive is intact,
you can distribute it anywhere.  Fred Fish collections and such, sure!  If
you like it (or even if you don't) drop me a line at CyberSpace BBS or
through the internet [joehick@ophelia.waterloo.net].

Well met and godspeed,
                      Giark
