Notes for OS4 port:

There are still some bugs left that iam aware of, an updated version will come 
out 2006 since i first have to get the daimonin team to include the OS4 changes 
in the project tree. Meanwhile you can (hopefully) play a little around and start
building up a character :)

Maybe some able Amiga gfx wizards can contribute to the daimonin project with better
icons or other stuff ?
