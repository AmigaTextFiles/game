   This is a program to help game masters design dungeons. You can have it
generate a dungeon randomly and use it as is, or load the map into the
editor for alteration and fine tuning. You can also draw a dungeon from
scratch. I wanted an alternative to drawing with pencil and paper.
   Make sure that the Help directory is in the same directory as the Dun_Gen
program. If you don't run the program from the Workbench, change directory to
wherever the program resides before starting it up. Otherwise it won't find
the help files.
   The documentation is accessible from within the program. There are four
help screens. Press the Help key on the 1st screen (front panel) for an
explanation on using the various buttons there. For the editor screen, there
are two help documents. To get help for the edit panel where you select which
brush to draw with, move the mouse pointer over it and press Help. Pressing
the Help key anywhere else on the edit screen loads a different file dealing
with the other aspects of the editor. The fourth help screen deals with the
menu. Access it by selecting Help from the menu or typing Ctrl H while in the
editor. The menu is disabled while the mouse pointer is over the edit panel.

              Happy mapping! Hey! How did that orc get in here?

   The program does not have any of the features turned off. There is not
even an annoyance screen that automatically pops up. I hope you find it
useful. Send comments and questions to URLAND on Delphi or to
urland@delphi.com or mark.hemsath@quandra.flagstaff.az.us on Internet.
