New:

   Wipe out the current project and return to the front panel. Pressing the Esc
key will also take you back to the front panel but without deleting the current
map in memory. The latter feature is so you can change the overall dungeon size
without losing the current map in memory. Note that if you change the size to
something smaller than the current map you may not be able to see all of your
work after returning to the editor.

Open:

   Load a previously saved data file.

Save As Data:

   This will save the current project in a form that can be loaded back into
the editor.

Save As IFF:

   This saves the editor screen in IFF format so that you can load it into a
paint program. Note that you can't load an IFF so you'll need to use the paint
package to print the dungeon if you go this route. The palette is reversed so
the screen is saved with a white background and the dungeon graphics are drawn
in black.

Print:

   Prints the current dungeon loaded into the editor. Make sure you have the
scale dots and printer prefs set the way you want. I find that having density
set to 5 gives good results. Setting the printer for B&W, Grey Scale, or Color
should not matter since the image is in black and white anyway. The colors are
reversed so that the dungeon graphics are printed in black.

Scale All:

   Draws scale dots across the entire map.

Scale Dungeon:

   Draws scale dots only where there are dungeon graphics.

Scale Off:

   Turns off all the scale dots.


Refresh:

   Redraws the map. Its a good idea to do this once in awhile to make sure your
map is the way you want it.

Help:

   Brings up the screen you are reading. Help is also available by pressing the
Help key while on the front panel, the editor screen, and the editor brush
panel (position the mouse pointer over the brush panel before pressing Help).

Quit:

   Exit the program.


   The menu system is disabled when the mouse pointer is over the brush panel.
