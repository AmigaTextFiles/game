   To choose a drawing tool from the editor panel, move the mouse pointer over
the one you want and click with a mouse button. The last image on the panel
(dagger) will alter its effect depending on which mouse button you use. A left
click makes it into an eraser that will delete the graphic definitions under it
but will leave the area as part of the dungeon. So when you refresh the screen,
the graphics will be gone but a scale dot will still be drawn if you have Scale
set to Dungeon. Scale set to All puts a dot in every square whether an area is
part of the dungeon or not. A right button click on the image will give you an
eraser that gets rid of graphic definitions and will remove the area under it
from being part of the dungeon as well.
   The wall brush "--" can be toggled north and south of the pointer by using
the up and down cursor keys once you move it over the editing area. Likewise,
the "|" wall brush toggles east and west of the pointer with the left and right
cursor keys. The door and secret door brushes use all four cursor keys to
change their placement in relation to the pointer.
   The text brush is for entering a single character on the square you left
click on. Then you can do the usual writing out of a description of whats so
special about point "a" or "h" in the dungeon (I think "h" is a constipated
mind flayer who perceives no humor at all in the world). Note that the program
does not have a built in text editor. This just allows you to label a spot. For
hallways that run east/west, the letters "a c e m n o r s u v w x z" work best
since they won't intersect with the hall graphic.
   If you are working on a dungeon that is wide enough to go under the editor
panel, press F1 to toggle the panel on and off.
