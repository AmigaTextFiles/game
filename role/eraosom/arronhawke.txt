Hello Rich,

Thanks for dragging me back in to the dim and distant past of Seamus O'Mally.
I would of course be delighted to have him resurrected by yourself and willingly
waive any rights to it. Do with it as you please. As you said F1 went down the
pan years ago and I forget who took over their catalogue as I never heard anything
from them again.

You or also free to put my e-mail address on the readme if you so wish, in case
anyone needs some help, although it is actually fairly easy and quite short if
done in a completely linear fashion (and the game is very linear in construction).
I never claimed to be a good designer. Hahaha.

One thing you might like to mention is there is a major bug in the 'airport' which
I never did fix. It happens on the one section I pushed the boat out and used a
double screen which scrolled across to appear as one. It does occassionally lock up
in that area and I have no idea why. The only advice I can give is to save the game
before you enter the airport as if it happens the odds are it won't the next time. 

I must admit I miss the days of GRAC and AMOS to write these style games. I did in
fact do one GRAC game based on a famous 'Australian Soap Opera' for my sister. I
guess you can work out what one I mean. Hahahaha.

I wish I had more stuff for you to add, but sadly Seamus was the zenith of my career
in that respect. Hahahaha. I always intended doing a Seamus II on the PC but found
the time required just so daunting and also the PC just isn't as friendly as the Amiga
was in that way.

Have fun 

Arron
