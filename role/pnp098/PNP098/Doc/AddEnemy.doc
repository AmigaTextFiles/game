With this module you can easily add enemies to your enemyfiles.


First you should choose a terrainfile. The contents of it are shown in the
ListView-gadget (see enemygenerator from PNP).

The text-button opens an asl-filerequester where you can choose a text that will
be shown when clicking the info-button in enemygenerator.
The pic-button does the same with a picture.

See the description of the enemyfiles in PNP.doc for information about the other
gadgets.

After choosing an enemyfile you can add the dataset to this file by clicking the
add-button or, if your editor is open, insert the dataset at the current
cursorposition of the editor by clicking insert.
