INTRODUCTION
************

    PNP helps you to create adventures for nearly every RPG. PNP offers some
    windows where you can easily create data that's important for RPGs. You can
    define datafiles which describe your RPG. You may have such files for several
    RPG-Systems, so you can use PNP for different RPG-Systems. You can also
    configure PNP to open your preffered editor (or some Word-Processor like
    Final Writer(TM)) on its screen. Here you can write your adventure. Now, when
    you need some data that PNP has created, it can be inserted in your text
    by pressing an insertbutton.

SYSTEM-REQUIREMENTS
*******************

    - An Amiga running Kickstart 2.04+ (I think so, it's only been tested
      with KS3.x)
    - 2meg of RAM (perhaps PNP runs with less ram, but i don't know).
    - A screensize of at least 640x256, PNP starts to be happy with
      640x480!!



    PNP has been developed on an A4000, 68040/40, 28 Meg FastRam,
    340Meg SCSI HD, Cybervision64, 17" monitor.

INSTALLING
**********

    Just copy the unpacked archive somewhere to your harddisk.
    Now doubleclick on the PNP-Start icon. It assigns pnp: to the current
    directory and starts PNP.
    If you want PNP to be able to insert text in an editor, you must have
    Rexxmast running.

STARTING
********

    Please don't start PNP directly. Do always use the script PNP-start.
    PNP: is assigned to the current directory and an important argument is given
    to PNP here!!!

    PNP opens an own screen, that's cloned from the Workbench-screen. Later
    you can define another screenmode.

    At startup PNP asks you for a project file. When starting PNP the first
    time you can only choose sample.prj.
    After that you can define you own Preferences, but you first should try
    out some things.


Some general things:

    - When a String-Gadget is labeled with capitals you can enter
      several data or commands by seperating them with a seperator,
      a "," for data and a ";" for commands. The last character must be the
      seperator, but PNP automatically adds it if it's not there.
    - You can open and use several windows at the same time.
    - A "?"-button opens an asl-requester.
    - I think i'm not allowed to give data of some RPGs with PNP, so you
      have to enter it yourself.
    - PNP is font-sensitive

THE MENUS
*********

PROJECT
*******

    INFO
    ****
        Shows some infornation about PNP, the status (registered/unregistered),
        etc.

    OPEN
    ****
        Here you can choose another project.

    SAVE
    ****
        Saves the current project. A project contains information about the
        preferences, which windows are currently open and which position and
        size  they have.
        So if you open some windows and save the project, these windows will be
        opened on next startup.

        You can have projects for several RPGs. So if you like to work on an
        adventure for e.g. AD&D(TM), open your AD&D project and all preferences
        (enemyfiles, etc.) are loaded for AD&D (of course you have to define these
        prefs first). If you want to work on another RPG, just load another
        project.

    SAVE AS
    *******
        Saves the current project under another name.

    QUIT
    ****
        Quits PNP and all open windows except modules and other programs
        that open a window on the PNP-screen. If windows not under the
        control of PNP are open, a requester asks you to close these
        windows. (But PNP can close the Editor if it has an ARexxport!)


TABLES
******

    This menu differs from project to project as it is user defineble.
    If you choose a menupoint a window opens that contains data that is read
    from an ASCII-file. There can be 4 tables opened at the same time.

WINDOWS
*******

    ROLL DICE
    *********

        This opens a window with some gadgets
        (Combination does not work for now!).

        With the first MX-Gadget on the right side (d4-d100) you choose the die
        you want to roll. The second one selects how many times the die is
        rolled, so d6+x3 means, a 6 sided die is rolled 3 times and the results
        are added.
        With the Slider-Gadget and the Cycle-Gadget you can modify the result by
        adding, subtracting, dividing or multiplying with a value that's giving
        by the Slider-Gadget.

        The Button "roll" rolls the dice and shows thw result in the Text-Gadget
        on the right.

        The Checkbox-Gadget "History" opens an other window. Every result is
        added to the left list and the number of results is shown above.
        When clicking "Sum" the results are added and the result is added to
        the right list. With "Reset" the list is set to null.

        You can manipulate the behaviour of the left "Sum"-Button in Misc-Prefs.

    TREASURE GENERATOR
    ******************

        This one creates a treasure by interpreting a treasurefile in
        pnp:daten/Tres.

        In the String-Gadget "Type" you choose the treasure. "A" means that
        the file
        "A.tres" in pnp:daten/Tres shall be used.

        Clicking "Generate" creates the treasure. This may take a while...
        The result is shown in the big Bevelbox.
        When the editor is open, you can insert the result by clicking the
        "Insert"-Button.
        "Close" closes this window.

        See chapter TREASURES for more information about creating treasurefiles.

    FOE GENERATOR
    *************

        The Slider labeled "Enemy" defines the value that is used by the 4 "<"
        and ">" buttons which enter this value in the corresponding String-
        gadget. The values define the min and max number of normal enemies
        and leaders.

        The checkbox "Level/HD" selects whether the enemies are monsters or
        humans.
        The checkbox "Time" selects which time you actually have, so if it's
        day, there can be enemies that appear in the daytime or both, but not
        only during the night.

        "Terrain" shows which terrain you're actually in, behaviour is the same
        as "Time".
        The content of the list is read from file given in Misc-Prefs.

        "Scenario" defines from which scenario enemies may appear, that differs
        from the behaviour of the last to gadgets. So if you want enemies that
        appear in all scenarios and enemies that appear e.g. in Krynn, you have
        to enter All,Krynn, .

        "Enemy" : Here you can select special enemies. You can select fixed
                  enemies or races.
                  See chapter ENEMIES for more.

        "Save" saves the contents of the two String-gadgets.
        "Load" loads it.

        "Info" shows an additional text if it is available.
        "Pic"  shows a picture of the enemy if it is available.

        "Generate" creates some enemies.
        "Insert" inserts them in editor.
        "Close" closes this window.

    EVENT
    *****

        A randomly generated event is shown in the Bevelbox. With "New" you can
        load another event, "Insert" inserts the text in your editor if it's
        open, "Close" closes the window.

        The events are read from a file in pnp:daten/events/. This file is given
        by Misc-Prefs.

        See EVENTS on how to create eventfiles.

    EDITOR
    ******

        This opens the editor given by Editor-Prefs. See there for more
        information.

        Note: Ed2.0 has some problems with inserting text via ARexx.
              The text does sometimes not appear at the screen.
              When this happens just scroll the window so the position
              is not on the screen anymore. Now when scrolling back the
              text should be there.

    CALCULATOR
    **********

        This opens sys:tools/calculator, so it should be there, if you want
        to use it :-).

    MODULES
    *******

        Here you can open the modules that are defined in modulesprefs.
        You can add 20 Modules to this menu.
        


    PREFERENCES
    ***********

        EDITOR
        ******

            "Path":     here you have to choose an editor by giving the
                        programname with full path. The "?"-button opens
                        an asl-filerequester.

            "Screen":   If the editor supports pubscreens insert the argument
                        in the String-Gadget (but NOT the screenname!).
                        Otherwise select SHANGHAI. This will put PNP to
                        SHANGHAI-Mode when opening the editor and back to
                        normal mode after that.

            "ARexx":    The Checkbox does not work for now.

            "Port" :    Enter the name of the ARexx-Port of the editor
                        here.

            "Startup":  The value of the Slider-Gadget is the time PNP waits
                        after starting the editor before setting its
                        windowposition and size.

            "Control":
                        "Save":     The ARexx-command of the editor for saving
                                    the current-file.
                        "Filename": Does not work for now. In later verions you
                                    can enter a command that returns the name of
                                    the edited file and PNP saves it within the
                                    projectfile, so it can automatically
                                    be loaded on next startup.
                        "QUIT":     A Control-Sequence that will be send to the
                                    editor when quitting PNP.

            "Insert Text":

                        No Clipboard-support yet.
                        "Insert":   Enter the command for inserting text in the
                                    first String-Gadget. The text to be inserted
                                    will be send between the contents of the
                                    first and the second gadget.
                                    In the second gadget you can e.g. enter a ",
                                    when your editor wants the text to be
                                    enclosed in " ".
                                    There are also two special characters: < and .
                                    < adds a linefeed after the text,  a
                                    carriagereturn.
                                    This is for programs like FinalWriter that
                                    have no ARexx commands for inserting a
                                    new line.

                        "DOWN":     A control-sequence for inserting a new line.

            "Set Windowposition":

                        With the checkbox you choose wether to set the position
                        and size of the editorwindow by ARexxcommands or an
                        intuitioncommand.
                        I think that the intuitioncommand is better.

                        "X": The Arexx-command for setting the x-position.
                        "Y": The Arexx-command for setting the y-position.
                        "h": The Arexx-command for setting the height.
                        "w": The Arexx-command for setting the width.

            The checkbox Mode2 sets the internal mode of windowhandling. This
            should be placed in Misc-Prefs but i realised the problems with
            mode1 when trying out some editors, so it's placed here.
            If your editor has problems, you should try out mode2.

        TABLES
        ******

            Here you can add tables to the tablesmenu.

            "Add": This opens a filerequester and the file you choose is added
            to the list (the name that appears there is read from the file).
            "Del": Deletes the selected item from the list.

            With the Buttons under "Position" you can change the position of
            the selected item.

            You can add up to 30 tables to the menu.

            When clicking "Use" or "Save" the tablemenu will be updated.

        Screen
        ******

            "Clone WB"  : Check wether WB-Screen is cloned or not.

            "Mode..."   : If Clone WB isn't checked, you can define
                          a screenmode for PNP here.

            "Font..."   : Choose a font for PNP here.

            "Background": A filerequester appears where you can choose an
                          iff-file that's shown in the mainwindow. 
                          The first 4 colours should be the standard
                          workbenchcolours.

            "Shanghai"  : The PNP-screen will be in Shanghai-mode.

            "Use"       : Use the Prefs.

            "Save"      : Save the Prefs into the selected file.
                          The font- and the screenprefs are always
                          written to font.prefs/screenmode.prefs.
                          You can't have different prefs for different
                          projects (guess that's no problem).

            "Open"      : Opens a prefsfile.

            "Cancel"    : Cancel the changes.

        Misc
        ****
            "Autosave": Does not work for now.

            "Rearrange Gadgets": When this checkbox is checked the gadgets of
                                 the windows will rearrange when the window
                                 size is changed. This does not works correct
                                 yet, so the gadget is disabled.

            "Autoreset": This tells PNP whether to reset the dicehistorylist
                         when clicking "Sum" or not.

            "Terrain":  Here you must enter the file that's used for the
                        terrain-list in Enemy Generator.
            "HD":       The datafile for Monsters.
            "Level":    The datafile for human enemies.

            "Event data": The eventfile.

        Modules
        *******

            Here you can add modules to the modulesmenu.
            The behaviour is the same as in tablesprefs.

TREASURES
*********

    This generator is not finished. It큦 quite slow and there are some other
    not very nice things.
    Perhaps I will rewrite it.

    Usage:

    I decided to make it flexible, to be useful with most RPGs.
    So it큦 implemented as an interpreter-language.

    Commands:

        ( <...> : here you will add other commands )

        KIND(kind)          <kind> is the kind of treasure (e.g. Copper)
          ...               which is rolled.
        ENDKIND        

        TRES(tres,num,a,b,c,...)
         ...
        ENDTRES
                            This opens another treasurefile.
                            The filename is given by <tres> in combination
                            with <num,a,b,c,...>.
                            This is needed if there is more than one table
                            for the same treasurekind.
                            Let큦 say you have the treasuretables

                                Scrolls_1
                                Scrolls_2
                                Scrolls_3

                            Then you must say: TRES(Scrolls,3,1,2,3)
                            where the first 3 stands for the number of
                            different tables.

                            Another example:

                                Potions_A
                                Potions_B
                                Potions_C
                                Potions_D

                            -> TRES(Potions,4,A,B,C,D)

                            Now let큦 say we have 2 tables and there is
                            a 2/3 chance of getting the first one and 1/3
                            for the second.

                                table_1
                                table_2     are tablefiles in PNP:daten/Tres/

                            -> TRES(table,3,1,1,2)

                            THE _ BETWEEN TABLENAME AND APPENDIX IS
                            NECESSARY!!!!!

                            If there is only one table, just type:
                            TRES(tres,0)

        ROLL(dice)          Rolls a dice on a given table.
         ...                ROLL(100) will roll a d100,
        ENDROLL             ROLL(54) will roll a d54. (see example below!)

        %(percent)          the chance the treasure is found.
                            <percent> is from 0-100.

        RANGE(min-max)      The amount (at least <min>,at most <max>)
                            of treasure is rolled. min,max are integers.

        VALUE(val)          The amount of treasure is given by <val>.

        ANY(val),           This means a die is rolled <val> times
        ANY(min-max)        on a treasuretable. With ANY(min-max) <val>
                            is a random number between min and max.


    Examples:

        KIND(Copper)
            RANGE(1000-3000)
            %(25)
        ENDKIND

        KIND(Gold)
            RANGE(1000-6000)
            %(50)
            KIND(Silver)
                VALUE(300)
            ENDKIND

         THE LAST CHARACTER OF EACH TREASUREFILE MUST BE THE #  !!!!!!

         Put the files in pnp:daten/tres/ .
EVENTS
******

    The ASCII-file must begin with a "{". After that you enter the first event.
    Every event is closed with a "{" except the last that's closed with a "#".

    Example:

    {
        Event one. (Used as title)

        This happens.

    {
        Event two.

        This happens.
    {
        last event.

        This happens.

    #   (End of file)

    This files should be placed in pnp:daten/events.

ENEMIES
*******

    You should create two enemyfiles for each RPG, one for monsters and one for
    humans.

    An enemyfile looks as follows:

    enemyname, leaders, level/hd, scenario, terrain, daytime, race, text, pic,

    take care of the last ","!!!

    enamyname: the name of the enemy

    leaders: if you enter a name of another enemy that's also specified in this
             file, these enemies are used, when there shall be leaders. If you
             specify "None" any other enemy that has higher level/hd and has the
             same race is used as leaders.

    level/hd:   the level or hit dice of enemy.

    scenario:   the scenario the enemy appears in. If you specify "All", the
                enemy can appear in every scenario.

    terrain:    this is the NUMBER of the item in the listview-gadget (beginning
                with 0) that represents the terrain the enemy may appear. You
                should use "0" for "All".
                As you can specify your own terrainfiles you can do this the way
                you want.

    daytime:    the daytime the enemy may appear.
                Values are: "Day","Night" or "Both".

    race:       the race of the enemy. You can specify the race in the
                enemy-gadget. This is also used for specifying the leader of
                an enemy.

    text:       this text is shown when clicking the info-button in enemygenerator.

    pic:        this pic is shown (using MultiView) when clicking the pic-button.

    # again marks the end of the file.

    See the enemyfiles for examples.


TABLES
******

    A tablefile looks as follows:

    Line 1: The name of the table (this one appears in the PNPmenu)
    Line 2
     ...    This is the Headline of the table.
    Line x
    {
        The table itself.
    }
    Some comments (if you want).
    ...
    # The end.




    Example:


    Constitution  (the menuentry)
     Attribute-      Hit-
       value        points
    {
        1           -3
        2           -2
        3           -1
        4           -1
        5            0
        6            0                (the table)
        7            0
        8           +1
        9           +1
        10           +1
        11           +1
        12           +1
        13           +2
        14           +3
        15           +4
    }
    *) Here you can add comments.
    **) and even more lines.
    #




TERRAINS
********

    This file defines the content of the listview-gadget in foe generator. The
    first line is the first item in the list, the second line the second one and
    so on ...

    No # at the end here.

HINTS
*****

 -  You can simply add a ToolManager-Dock to PNP:

    1. Create a ToolManager-Dock, that's not activated at startup.
       Assign publicscreen PNP to it, and choose a key-shortcut.
       If the pograms that shall be started from the dock have publicscreen
       support just give PNP as argument to the publicscreen argument.
       You have to choose CLI as programtype!!
       ( e.g. ged SCREEN PNP, clock pubscreen PNP,
         newshell "CON://///SCREEN PNP", ... )

       (Perhaps for some programs the pubscreen gadget of ToolManager may work,
       for programs like MultiView, Clock, NewShell, etc. it doesn't.)

       IF a program don't has pubscreen support, don't do anything here.
       Save it.
    2. Start PNP.
       IF you added a program without pubscreen support to your dock select
       SHANGHAI from Screen-Prefs. ( Now EVERY program will open its screen on
       the PNP screen)
    3. Press the Dock-shortcut. It should appear on the PNP-screen.

 -  Use a tool like CycleToMenu.

 -  Create an iff-picture of important tables, that's shown in background.

 -  Create treasurefiles that create weapons and armor, that you can use for
    arming the enemies generated by PNP. Or use the textfield in your enemyfile
    where you can add weapon and armor.

 -  If you've forgotten the seperator, just enter any text into the gadget and
    press return.
    Now PNP will add the seperator as last character.

 - If you use a small screensize use a small font too.

 - If you have problems with the screenmode, load screenmode.pref into your
   editor and change the first character from 0 to 1 and save the file.
   Now PNP will clone the wb-screen.

 - If PNP slows down your system a lot, try to increase the number that's
   given as argument to pnp in PNP-Start. You should start with 2 ...

Please send comments,bug-reports and suggestions to me (e-mail preferred).

CHANGES
*******

    V0.96   - Added modules.
            - Two more buttons in enemygenerator and two more
              fields in the datasets of the enemyfiles.

            - Bug Fixes:
                - The iff-pic is shown correctly now.
                - Some minor fixes (corrected prefspaths etc.).

    V0.97   - Added a FontRequester.
              PNP uses its own font now.
            - Added a ScreenModeRequester.
              PNP can use its own screenmode now.

    V0.98   - The tables are shown correctly now with
              different fonts.
            - A pointer to textattr is given as argument to modules now.
            - Fixed several enforcer hits.
            - Fixed a bug in loadfontprefs().

            - Some internal changes and minor bugfixes.

KNOWN BUGS
**********

 - You can't delete the last item in table- and modulesprefs twice, If you try this
   PNP hangs up. So if you want to delete the last two items you should delete the
   second last one first.

 - The cancel-buttons of the prefs-windows may course crashes.
 - The event-win doesn't change it's size to fit the text in.
 - You must choose a projectfile when starting PNP. The cancelbutton does not
   work.

FUTURE PLANS
************


    Plans:

    - Clipbooard-support
    - Start editor with the last edited text.
    - better documentation (and in AmigaGuide format, in work now but will
      take a while)
    - some modules (e.g. a mapeditor, a charactergenerator, some modules for
      prefs like AddEnemy)
    - a better enemy generator. It should be able to run treasurefiles and to
      roll the hit dice, etc.
