CAVING IN

The dungeon behind your group caves in!
You're just fast enough not to be hit
by some stones.
There's no way to pass through!
{
SURPRISE

The ground under the group opens!
You're falling into a room with a
closed iron door at the north side.
{
ENCOUNTER

Suddenly, just as your group turns round
a corner a man in dark robes appears.
He takes a short look and asks what
you're doing here.
{
ENCOUNTER

A woman clothed like a ranger stands up
from a table in the bar, and comes near.
