Introduction

Chapter 1: Deodand

Somewhere in the Atlantic...  A dark storm is raging.  The sky is in 
turmoil the greyed clouds moving swiftly overhead.  Waves sway wretchedly 
in agony as if to spew forth the sea's contents from the very bowels of the 
earth.  A sole shape sits in this great whirlwind of waves.  An 
off-shore oilrig that stands stubbornly against the deafing blow of the 
wind.  Suddenly from high above comes a fist of lighting followed by a 
thundering so intense that everything around seems to pause for a moment, 
eyes wide, wondering. The billowing wind and boiling sea slowly recover 
from the attack and continue their own assault on the rig.  What happens 
next is not quite clear, another flash, a sound, a haze, a whirling unseen 
force.  The sky calms, the clouds slow, and the waves roll more softly.  
Where once a solid structure stood there is nothing. Only a barren sea and 
slumping sky is left.  The wind cries.

The next day...

You have heard of the mysterious sinking of the oilrig and, always being 
the opportunist, decide that there could be valuable salvage left from the 
crash.  Valuable salvage that could be worth a lot!  You must find a way 
to explore the abandoned crash site.  Scuba gear won't due; the wreckage 
would be too deep beneath the waves.  There has to be a way!  You finally 
rent a mini-sub from a poor researcher that needs the money to continue
his work.  Always the opportunist.

Soon afterwards...

You are now standing on the dock leading to the vessel, ready to begin your
grand treasure hunt.  Unbeknownst to you a secret lies deep beneath the cold
waves of the sea.  A secret that will lead you on the journey of your life.
A journey into a world unknown to mankind.  A world filled with magic,
beauty, wonder, enigma, and a destructive force that rules over all it's
kingdoms.  Hardship, intrigue and great rewards await the
one brave enough to take the challenge.  Are you up to it?

It is now time for you to write the remaining chapters of this story, 
chapters that will be shaped by the events that follow in your path.
Go Forth!

Requirements

@node installation "Installation"
Installation

Preparation
--------------------------------------------------------

First double-click the ScreenMode program
located on the Aqua CD.

First it will ask for a screenmode for the main GameScreen.
Try to choose something as close as possible to 640x400 in size.
Example: "NTSC:High Res Laced"

Second it will ask for a screenmode for the CinemaScreen.
Try to choose a mode as close as possible to 320x200 in size.
Example: "NTSC:Low Res"


Note: The screenmode requestor will allow you to choose
      "unsuitable modes"  This was done to allow Aqua
      to work even on machines that do not have "regular"
      sized display modes available.  Also if the game
      is slow switching from the game to cinema screens
      on UAE or RTG displays you may want to set both 
      modes the same.  However this results in the cinemas 
      being quite small in size compared to on AGA.



Starting The Game
-------------------------------------------------------
Simply Double click the icon labeled "Aqua_AGA"
if you have an AGA Amiga.

If you have an Amiga with a Gfx card or are using
with Picasso96/CGFX double click on the icon labeled
"Aqua_RTG" to play.


To play from HardDrive
----------------------
Aqua can be played directly from a CD or installed
on a hard drive.

To install to hard drive do the following:
Just make a new drawer called "Aqua" and copy the entire 
contents of the CD to the drawer. You will need about 
200MB of free space.  Installing to hard drive is 
advised since the game will generally run faster 
from a hard drive.

Thats all!


Note: You must also have some "monitors" installed in
      "Devs:Monitors/" to be able to choose a screen mode.
      NTSC or RTG displays are advisable.
      Also a standard envarc: directory must be available
      for "game saves" and "screenmode prefs" to be saved.

7. Saving and Loading



1. Concept
---------------------------------------------------------

Aqua is a game where the player is faced with solving
various mysteries and exploring the terrain to proceed.
If you get stuck don't worry there is always a way to  
proceed in the game.  Just try to think about how to  
get past where you are and try everything possible.
You may need to have your sound turned up for some
parts of the game.  Good Luck!


2. Starting the game
--------------------------------------------------------

Aqua is controlled with the Mouse.

When the game begins you will have 3 options to choose from.
You can choose an option by simply left-clicking the selection
you want.  Here are your 3 choices:

"New Game" - Start a new game of Aqua from the beginning
"Continue" - Resume a previously saved game
"Quit"     - Quit the game


3. Where you begin
--------------------------------------------------------
When you start the game a cinema display will commence.
After watching the cinema you will appear on the dock.
This is the play screen. 


4. Using the pointer and pointer shapes 
--------------------------------------------------------
The pointer is what allows you to interact with the game world.
You can move your "hand pointer" with the mouse.  Depending what 
area of the screen your "pointer" is located in it can change into 
one of several shapes.

a. Pointer Shapes and meanings
---------------------------
Pointing forward: 
This is the standard cursor shape and you can use it to
move forward - pick up items - operate objects
select and use items from the inventory

Pointing Left:
This generally means that you can turn to the left of where
you are standing.

Pointing Right:
This means that you can turn to the right of where you are
standing.

Pointing Back:
This means that you can back up from where you are standing, this
is usually only available on close-up views.

Open hand:
This means you are currently trying to use an item
from your inventory.


5. Mouse Keys
--------------------------------------------------------
Here is a description of the function of the mouse keys

Left Key: 
(On game screen)
Clicking the left key on the game screen can 
move you forward - operate an object - turn left
turn right - pick up an item - use an item

(On the inventory screen)
choose an item to use
Save game - Load game


Right Key: 

(On game screen)
One click brings up inventory screen.
Clicking again hides the inventory.


6. Using the Inventory
--------------------------------------------------------
During the course of Aqua you can collect various items 
by clicking on them with the left mouse key.

These items appear in your inventory screen which can be 
opened and closed with the right mouse key.


a. Using items
--------------
To use an item simply open the inventory screen with the right
mouse key and then select the item you want to use with the
left mouse key.  You will return to the game screen and your
pointer will turn into an open hand.  Now you can select what 
you want to use the item on by left clicking on the game screen.  
If the hand stays open then the item can not be used there, simply
right click to return to normal gameplay.


7. Saving and Loading
--------------------------------------------------------
If you want to save your game so that you may quit and
come back to it later simply open the inventory with the
right mouse key.  Now select one of the numbered logbooks 
to the right of the word "Save".  If the save was 
sucessful you will automaticaly return to the game 
screen.  You can save in one of 3 different save slots.

You can load a previously saved game either by choosing
"Continue" from the title screen and then choosing a log 
or clicking on a numbered log book beside the word "Load" 
on the inventory screen.


Note: Aqua is a multitasking program so
      feel free to press "LeftAmiga + m" to swap
      back to workbench at any time.
