@node introduction "Introduction"
Introduction

Chapter 1: Deodand

Somewhere in the Atlantic...  A dark storm is raging.  The sky is in 
turmoil the greyed clouds moving swiftly overhead.  Waves sway wretchedly 
in agony as if to spew forth the sea's contents from the very bowels of the 
earth.  A sole shape sits in this great whirlwind of waves.  An 
off-shore oilrig that stands stubbornly against the deafing blow of the 
wind.  Suddenly from high above comes a fist of lighting followed by a 
thundering so intense that everything around seems to pause for a moment, 
eyes wide, wondering. The billowing wind and boiling sea slowly recover 
from the attack and continue their own assault on the rig.  What happens 
next is not quite clear, another flash, a sound, a haze, a whirling unseen 
force.  The sky calms, the clouds slow, and the waves roll more softly.  
Where once a solid structure stood there is nothing. Only a barren sea and 
slumping sky is left.  The wind cries.

The next day...

You have heard of the mysterious sinking of the oilrig and, always being 
the opportunist, decide that there could be valuable salvage left from the 
crash.  Valuable salvage that could be worth a lot!  You must find a way 
to explore the abandoned crash site.  Scuba gear won't due; the wreckage 
would be too deep beneath the waves.  There has to be a way!  You finally 
rent a mini-sub from a poor researcher that needs the money to continue
his work.  Always the opportunist.

Soon afterwards...

You are now standing on the dock leading to the vessel, ready to begin your
grand treasure hunt.  Unbeknownst to you a secret lies deep beneath the cold
waves of the sea.  A secret that will lead you on the journey of your life.
A journey into a world unknown to mankind.  A world filled with magic,
beauty, wonder, enigma, and a destructive force that rules over all it's
kingdoms.  Hardship, intrigue and great rewards await the
one brave enough to take the challenge.  Are you up to it?

It is now time for you to write the remaining chapters of this story, 
chapters that will be shaped by the events that follow in your path.
Go Forth!

Installation

Preparation
--------------------------------------------------------

Aqua can be installed anywhere on your hard drive.

To install to hard drive do the following:
Just copy the entire Aqua game contents to a
suitable place on your hard drive. You will need
about 200MB of free space.


Starting The Game
-------------------------------------------------------
Simply Double click the icon labeled "Aqua_MorphOS".


ScreenMode
-------------------------------------------------------
Aqua will automatically select the best screenmode
to use but for best results try to have a "640x400 8 bit"
screenmode available. A "320x200 8bit" screenmode is also
recommended for the cinema scenes. Depending on your monitor
you may have to use the next closest resolution available.
You can use "ModeEdit" in your "system settings" to create

1. Concept
---------------------------------------------------------

Aqua is a game where the player is faced with solving
various mysteries and exploring the terrain to proceed.
If you get stuck don't worry there is always a way to  
proceed in the game.  Just try to think about how to  
get past where you are and try everything possible.
You may need to have your sound turned up for some
parts of the game.  Good Luck!


2. Starting the game
--------------------------------------------------------

Aqua is controlled with the Mouse.

When the game begins you will have 3 options to choose from.
You can choose an option by simply left-clicking the selection
you want.  Here are your 3 choices:

"New Game" - Start a new game of Aqua from the beginning
"Continue" - Resume a previously saved game
"Quit"     - Quit the game


3. Where you begin
--------------------------------------------------------
When you start the game a cinema display will commence.
After watching the cinema you will appear on the dock.
This is the play screen. 


4. Using the pointer and pointer shapes 
--------------------------------------------------------
The pointer is what allows you to interact with the game world.
You can move your "hand pointer" with the mouse.  Depending what 
area of the screen your "pointer" is located in it can change into 
one of several shapes.

a. Pointer Shapes and meanings
---------------------------
Pointing forward: 
This is the standard cursor shape and you can use it to
move forward - pick up items - operate objects
select and use items from the inventory

Pointing Left:
This generally means that you can turn to the left of where
you are standing.

Pointing Right:
This means that you can turn to the right of where you are
standing.

Pointing Back:
This means that you can back up from where you are standing, this
is usually only available on close-up views.

Open hand:
This means you are currently trying to use an item
from your inventory.


5. Mouse Keys
--------------------------------------------------------
Here is a description of the function of the mouse keys

Left Key: 
(On game screen)
Clicking the left key on the game screen can 
move you forward - operate an object - turn left
turn right - pick up an item - use an item

(On the inventory screen)
choose an item to use
Save game - Load game


Right Key: 

(On game screen)
One click brings up inventory screen.
Clicking again hides the inventory.


6. Using the Inventory
--------------------------------------------------------
During the course of Aqua you can collect various items 
by clicking on them with the left mouse key.

These items appear in your inventory screen which can be 
opened and closed with the right mouse key.


a. Using items
--------------
To use an item simply open the inventory screen with the right
mouse key and then select the item you want to use with the
left mouse key.  You will return to the game screen and your
pointer will turn into an open hand.  Now you can select what 
you want to use the item on by left clicking on the game screen.  
If the hand stays open then the item can not be used there, simply
right click to return to normal gameplay.


7. Saving and Loading
--------------------------------------------------------
If you want to save your game so that you may quit and
come back to it later simply open the inventory with the
right mouse key.  Now select one of the numbered logbooks 
to the right of the word "Save".  If the save was 
sucessful you will automaticaly return to the game 
screen.  You can save in one of 3 different save slots.

You can load a previously saved game either by choosing
"Continue" from the title screen and then choosing a log 
or clicking on a numbered log book beside the word "Load" 
on the inventory screen.
