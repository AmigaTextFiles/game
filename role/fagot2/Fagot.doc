                              !!! WARNING !!!
           Use of this program WILL cause serious brain damage.

This  is  RELEASE  v0.2!  The name creation process was sped up at least 10
times,  and the program features a new innovation called CLOSE-GADGET!  The
user-interface still sucks, but what you gonna do.

===========================================================================
                               Requirements:

You'll  need  a  file  called  'FagotSyllables'  in  the  same  dir  as the
Fagot-runnable.

req.library and amos.library must be in libs:, unless you have patched your
system to use MFR or ReqTools file requester (or something similar).
===========================================================================

The 'FagotSyllables'-file must be in the following format:

something1_1
 .
 .
 .
something1_n
*
something2_1
 .
 .
 .
something2_n
*
something3_1
 .
 .
 .
something3_n

===========================================================================
The  Fagot  program  just  randomly  picks one of each syllable, joins then
together,  and  adds  to an array of names.  Then the array is checked, all
double-entries are removed and the resulting list is yours to play with.

If  you want the Fagot program to sometimes only make 2 syllable-names, add
one (or more) empty lines in the middle section of the FagotSyllables-file.

The number of '*':s in the file does not matter.  It can be '**********' or
'*End of section one'.
===========================================================================
