@node important "Important"

Work by the InfoTaskForce originally began on this interpreter over eight
years ago. Over this period, the required behaviour of an Infocom
interpreter has changed, largely due to the introduction of the Inform
compiler. Now it is no longer enough to interpret all the old Infocom games;
an interpreter must be able to cope with the new Inform games. For this to
happen it must comply with Graham Nelson's paper on the specification of the
Z-Machine. The amount of work that would be required to upgrade this
interpreter to the specification is not, on balance, worth the effort, so
this will be my final release of this interpreter.

While development of this interpreter has ceased, work has begun on an Amiga
version of a much newer interpreter, Frotz, which is both faster and more
accurate than this program. Already most of the major features of the Amiga
interface of this program are in place, and Amiga versions of Frotz are
available from

	Aminet, e.g. src.doc.ic.ac.uk, in /game/role
and
	ftp.gmd.de in  /if-archive/infocom/interpreters/frotz

@node intro "Introduction"

There have been several ports of Infocom interpreters to the Amiga, but none
of this program. The interpreter supports v1, v2, v3 (Zork1 to Stationfall),
v4 (Trinity, Bureaucracy, etc.), v5 (Sherlock, Beyond Zork, etc.), and
games produced by the compiler Inform, including the v8 format. With this
interpreter you can play ALL the games in the 3.5" disk LToI2 package for
the IBM PC, by copying the datafiles with CrossDOS or similar, then just
running this interpreter. This program requires AmigaDOS 2.04 or higher to
run.

As of 1.40, the interpreter supports all the features of Infocom data files
relevant to the Amiga, including the "Undo" command (in such games as choose
to implement it).

As of 2.00, the interpreter supports the use of proportional fonts for all
games.
@endnode
@node start "Starting Infocom"

Infocom can be started with a game file by clicking on the Infocom icon and
then shift double clicking on the game file icon. Alternatively, if the game
file's default tool has been set to where Infocom is, double clicking on the
game file icon will load Infocom and run the game.

The following can be added to the ToolTypes field of the Infocom icon (not
game file icons):

    ATTRIBUTES	- equivalent to the -a command line switch
    PRELOAD	- equivalent to the -l command line switch
    NOPAGING	- equivalent to the -p command line switch
    TRANSFER	- equivalent to the -t command line switch
    BZCOLOURS	- use "Beyond Zork" colour scheme with the graphics file.
		  The synonym "BZCOLORS" is also accepted. Equivalent to
		  the -z command line switch.

If the Infocom icon is double clicked (i.e. no game file selected), Infocom
scans the assignment INFOCOM: (and its sub-directories) for valid Infocom
game files. To speed up scanning, files are ignored unless their name
matches the AmigaDOS pattern (~(#?.#?)|#?.(dat#?|z?)). This means that only
files with no extension, or files ending with .data (Amiga story files) or
.dat (PC story files) or .z3,.z4,.z5 or .z8 (files produced by the Infocom
format compiler Inform) are scanned.

Using the @{"InfoPrefs" link infoprefs} editor, further directories to be searched can be
defined, and also directories to be ignored if the scan reaches them. If
Infocom cannot find one of the further directories specified, the directory
will not be searched and no "Please Insert Volume..." requester will appear.
Whether INFOCOM: is searched at all before these other directories or not,
and whether or not a "Please Insert Volume..." requester appears if INFOCOM:
cannot be found can be defined in InfoPrefs.

After searching is complete, a list of all the games found will appear. The
action taken by Infocom on finding multiple copies of the same game can be
altered in InfoPrefs. The default action is to display all games that have
been found. If more than one version of the game is found, the serial number
will be displayed in brackets after the game name. Other available actions
are to only display different versions or only to display the first found
version of each game.

Click on the game you want to play and it will load and run. If you click on
a game while holding down the shift key a requester will appear indicating
the name of the game, its release and serial numbers, and the full path to
the game file. At the bottom of this list is a "Select with File Requester"
gadget. Clicking on this gadget opens a file requester with which you can
select the game to play. This list can also be made to appear by starting
Infocom from the Shell with the -w switch. Note that this must be the only
argument, i.e.

    Infocom -w

is the only valid use of this switch. Game files can also be loaded by
dropping their icon from Workbench onto the window.
@endnode
@node use "Using Infocom"

If Infocom opens on its own screen, the screen clones the Workbench screen
to use its size, resolution and fonts (unless selections have been made for
these in @{"InfoPrefs" link infoprefs}). If possible, the Infocom screen is public, with the
name "Infocom".

Pressing the Help key gives the game currently playing, its author and
difficulty level (where available), and the screen type (public, private,
etc.).

All games can be played using a proportional font (specified in InfoPrefs).
If no font is specified, the fixed width window font will be used. If a
proportional font is used, the text may be right justified, if desired.

Left and right margins can be used (set in InfoPrefs) so that the text is
not flush with the screen border. This can be useful to make the text more
readable if you are using a program to give screens black borders. The
status line of most Infocom games will extend across the screen regardless
of the margin settings.

The current line can be edited using backspace, delete, and the left and
right cursor keys. The shifted cursor keys move the cursor to the beginning
and end of the current line, respectively.

Input lines have a history buffer. Use cursor up and down to scroll through
the buffer, and shift cursor up and down to go to the top and bottom of the
buffer, respectively.

Holding down the right mouse button accesses the menus:

    Project Menu

	Help		    Brings up this AmigaGuide help file.
	About		    Opens the help requester (the same as that
			    obtained by pressing the Help key).
	Quit		    Exits Infocom without going through the
			    usual "Are you sure?" prompts.

    Game Menu		    Provides a shortcut for typing in often used
			    file commands in the game, e.g. "Save".

    Command Menu	    Provides a shortcut for typing in often used
			    game commands, e.g. "Look".

    Options Menu

	Monitor Attributes  Determines whether the testing of attributes
			    in the game is shown. This can be turned on
			    initially with the -a flag at startup.
	Monitor Transfers   Determines whether the transfer of objects
			    in the game is shown. This can be turned on
			    initially with the -t flag at startup.
	Paging		    Determines whether text display is paused
			    every screenfull and a [MORE] prompt shown.
			    This can be turned off initially with the
			    -p flag at startup.
	Tandy Flag	    Some early Infocom games were licensed to
			    Tandy Corp. Turning on this flag causes
			    slight changes to the text in some early
			    games (most obviously, an extra line appears
			    in the version information).
@endnode
@node file "File operations"

If asl.library is available, Infocom uses the file requester to prompt for
any file names required. For Save and Restore operations, the default name
is the name of data file, minus any extensions and with ".Save" appended.
If Infocom is running on the Workbench screen, saved game files can also be
loaded by dropping their icon onto the window.

If the project icon Icon.Data is present in the same directory as Infocom,
saved game files have this icon when Infocom is started from Workbench.

The Script command causes a window to open. In the window the user can
choose the file to which the script should be sent by either typing it into
the string gadget, or click on the "Req" gadget, which causes a file
requester to open. This allows the script to be sent to a device that does
not appear in the file requester, e.g. PRT:. In addition, @{"InfoPrefs" link infoprefs} may be
used to define a button gadget which will appear to the right of the string
gadget. Clicking on this button sends the script to the device (e.g. PRT:)
or file defined by the button name.
@endnode
@node support "Support for specific games"

1) "The Lurking Horror"

   Sound files are supported, as distributed with the Amiga release. Copy
   all the sound files to the subdirectory "Sound" in the directory
   containing the "Lurking Horror" data file, e.g.

	DataFiles/LurkingHorror		<- data file
	DataFiles/Sound/s#?.dat		<- sound files

   Alternatively, the sound directory may be called "LurkingHorrorSound".
   This avoids conflicts with the Sherlock sound files (see (2)). Note that
   not all "Lurking Horror" data files contain the sound opcodes
   (especially those released for the PC), so to get the sound effects you
   need the correct data file as well as the sound files.

2) "Sherlock"

   Sound files from both the Amiga and Macintosh releases are supported.
   As with the "Lurking Horror" files, copy the sound files to a
   subdirectory called either "Sound" or "SherlockSound". As above, not
   all "Sherlock" data files contain sound opcodes.

3) "Border Zone"

   "Border Zone" implements an internal clock which is constantly running,
   regardless of whether you type in commands or not; thus events take
   place without the user doing anything.

4) "Beyond Zork"

   Infocom can use the graphics file "Graphics.data", which was part of the
   original Amiga release of "Beyond Zork", and was also included in the
   Amiga version of "The Lost Treasures of Infocom I". Copy the file to
   where the "Beyond Zork" data file is kept. The file may be renamed to
   "BeyondZork.gfx". Use of the graphics file in this manner requires that
   the window text is an 8×8 non-proportional font. If the font does not
   match these characteristics, then topaz/8 will be used instead.

   Alternatively, the graphics file (which is a standard Amiga font file)
   can be stored as a font in the "Beyond Zork" directory. To do this,
   open a Shell window and go to the directory containing the "Beyond Zork"
   data file and the "Graphics.data" file, then type the following:

	MakeDir fonts
	MakeDir fonts/BeyondZork
	Copy Graphics.data fonts/BeyondZork/8
	Assign FONTS: fonts
	SYS:System/FixFonts

   Then reboot your Amiga. Now if the window text is not 8×8, the graphics
   data file will be scaled by the system to the correct size. The font
   may also be put in the standard FONTS: directory. Note that Beyond Zork
   does not support proportional fonts.

   If the graphics file is present, the interpreter can use the "Beyond
   Zork" colour scheme. This feature is activated by the -z command line
   switch or the "BZCOLOUR" icon tooltype, or by @{"InfoPrefs" link infoprefs}. The colour
   scheme can then be changed in the game with the "color" command.

   The cursor arrow keys can be used to select items in the startup menus.
   Also, if a location description is too long for the window, hold down
   the Alt key and use cursor up and down to scroll the description.

   The function keys are preloaded with commands, which can be changed from
   within the game with the "define" command.

   The numeric keypad and the mouse can be used to select a direction. To
   use the mouse, click in the map to indicate the direction you wish to
   move in.
@endnode
@node special "Special commands"

The debugging commands present in some games are supported. These are
#record, #unrecord and #command (#reco, #unre and #comm in version 3 games).

#record prompts for a file name, to which all user input is sent until the
command #unrecord is issued. This recording of the user's actions can be
replayed with #command, which prompts for a file name to play back.

Also, the command "Undo" (present in some version 5 games), which takes back
the player's last move, is supported.
@endnode
@node games "Infocom.games file"

The list of games recognized by Infocom can be extended using the
"Infocom.games" file, which can be in the startup directory, S:, or PROGDIR:
(the directory where Infocom itself is stored). The format of this file is
best shown by an example:

[Zork I: The Great Underground Empire]	<- The game name enclosed in [].
Author=Marc Blank & Dave Lebling	<- The game's author, optional.
25 / 820515				<- A list of the release and
28 / 821013				   serial numbers for each version
30 / 830330				   of the game (Which can be found
75 / 830929				   for any game file using the -h
76 / 840509				   option.) as the release number,
88 / 840726				   followed by a / and then the
52 / 871125				   serial number.

[Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz]

... and so on.

Now any game included in this file will appear in the initial game list
(provided the game is present) and it's name and author will appear in the
Help key requester.
@endnode
@node stdio "Using standard i/o"

Infocom uses standard input/output if the -c switch is specified at the
Shell. This allows Infocom to e.g. take input from a file, or to be used
over a network. In the latter case, the output terminal must support ANSI
3.64 character sequences. Infocom will exit in this mode if it receives a
CTRL-C break.

The default size of the window and colour of the text can be changed by
specifying the with, height and pen number after "-c", each separated by a
forward slash, e.g.

    Infocom -c70/20/2 Zork1

starts "Zork I" in a character window of width 70 and height 20, with all
text using pen 2. Note that the values are the size of the window Infocom
expects - the actual output window of your terminal or Shell must be at
least as big as these values.

If one or more of the values are not specified, the appropriate default is
used, so e.g.

    Infocom -c70/20 Zork1	or
    Infocom -c//2 Zork1		is valid.

If you use a CON: window for input, then you will notice functions which use
an individual key press (e.g. scrolling up and down the list of hints in
"Sherlock") behave slightly differently. CON: windows only pass input to the
program after return is pressed, so if the program is expecting single key
presses, entering 'q' and pressing return causes the program to see a 'q'
character followed by a return character. If, say, you wish the program to
see two 'q' characters in a row, to e.g. quit out of a hint screen after
reading a hint, enter 'qq' followed by return.

For use over e.g. a network, Infocom can restrict the user's actions. This
is done by specifying a filename to be used for loading and saving games, in
conjunction with the -c option. The name of the file to use for loading and
saving should be given as the third argument, e.g.

    Infocom -c Zork1 Saved:Zork1.Save

This also disables any file writing functions other than the loading and
saving of games, and also stops CTRL-C exiting Infocom. If more than one
saved game is required, the -u switch can be used, e.g.

    Infocom -cu Zork1 Saved:SavedGame

In this case when saving or restoring the user will be prompted for a number
in the range 0 to 9, and the number will be appended onto the filename, i.e.
if in the above example the user entered 2, then the filename would be

    Saved:SavedGame2

All found saved games will be listed by number before the user is prompted.

To further restrict the user, the -m switch can be used to set a time limit
for any user playing a game. The format for -m is the time allowed in
minutes, optionally followed by one or two times at which the user should be
warned of the time remaining, e.g.

    Infocom -c/70/20m60/5/1 Zork1 Saved:Zork1.Save

allows the user to play Zork1 for sixty minutes, with warnings when there
are five minutes and one minute left. Both warnings are optional, so both

    Infocom -cm60 Zork1 Saved:Zork1.Save
    Infocom -cm60/5 Zork1 Saved:Zork1.Save

are valid.

If you wish CTRL-C to exit Infocom in all of the above circumstances, use
the -b switch. This does not affect anything else.
@endnode
@node infoprefs "InfoPrefs"

Many options in the interpreter can be defined using the external
configuration editor, InfoPrefs, which requires that either asl.library v38
or higher or reqtools.library v38 or higher is in LIBS:. By default,
reqtools.library is only used if asl.library v38+ is not available, but this
can be over-ridden with the icon tooltype REQTOOLS, or by the Shell option
of the same name (i.e. 1> InfoPrefs REQTOOLS). The configuration is stored
in the environment variable "Infocom.prefs", which is read in by Infocom at
startup. InfoPrefs allows you to change:

  Beyond Zork Colours	- If checked, "Beyond Zork" uses its custom colour
			  scheme.
  Preload Data Files	- If checked, the whole data file is loaded at the
			  start, rather than only needed sections being
			  loaded.
  Use Workbench Screen	- If checked, the interpreter opens a Workbench
			  window rather than its own screen.
  Custom Window Size	- If checked, and if "Use Workbench Screen" checked,
			  then the Workbench window size is taken from the
			  values entered below rather than chosen by the
			  program.
  Window Sizing Gadget	- If checked, then if Infocom is running in a
			  Workbench window, a sizing gadget appears to allow
			  changing of the with and height of the window
			  during play. Note that reducing the window size
			  may cause some games to become confused.
  Justify Prop. Text	- Enabled right justification of text displayed with
			  a proportional font.
  Left Edge, Top Edge,	- Determine the dimensions (in pixels) of the
  Width, Height		  Workbench window used by Infocom if both the above
			  gadgets are checked.
  L. Margin, R. Margin	- The size (in characters) of the left and right
			  margins to be used.
  StdIO Width, Height	- The default size (in characters) of the character
			  window to be used in StdIO mode (-c command line
			  option).
  Script Gadget		- If a string is entered here, it will appear as a
			  gadget in the script window (for more information,
			  see @{"file operations" link file}).
  Screen Font		- Opens a font requester from which to choose the
			  screen font to use.
  Screen Colours	- Opens a palette requester with which to choose the
			  screen colours. This option requires
			  reqtools.library to work.
  Screen Mode		- The mode and depth of the screen Infocom is to
			  open.
  Window Fonts		- There are two window fonts - one width may be
			  proportional, and the other which must be fixed.
			  The former is used for most text, while the latter
			  is used for e.g. diagrams. Note that these fonts
			  must have the same height.
  Games List		- This causes a new window to open, containing
			  parameters affecting the list of games displayed
			  at startup. The available options are:

  File to be displayed	- Choose whether Infocom displays all games found,
			  only different versions of a game, or only the
			  first version of each game.
  Ask for INFOCOM:	- If selected, and the INFOCOM: assignment cannot be
			  resolved, a "Please Insert Volume..." requester
			  will appear. If this is not selected, no such
			  requester will appear.
  Search INFOCOM:	- If selected (this is the default), the assignment
			  INFOCOM: is searched before any directories
			  specified below. If this is not selected, INFOCOM:
			  will not be searched, so that only games in
			  directories specified in the Search ListView will
			  appear in the startup list.
  Search directories	- Allows the selection of directories other than
			  INFOCOM: to be searched for game files. Select
			  "Add" to add a new entry, which can then be
			  edited in the string gadget. Current entries can
			  be edited by clicking on them in the list. The
			  "Del" gadget deletes the current entry, and the
			  "Req" gadget changes the current entry to the
			  directory selected in the file requester which
			  appears.
  Exclude directories	- As above, but allows the selection of directories
			  that are not to be searched. If, in searching
			  directories and sub-directories, Infocom finds
			  a directory named in this list, the directory is
			  not searched. For this reason, entries in this
			  list should not contain device names, i.e.

				Games:Zork1  and not e.g.  DF0:Zork1

There are also two menus available, "Project" and "Reset". The "Project"
menu has an "About" item, to show InfoPrefs' version number, and a "Quit"
item. The "Reset" menu is used to reset the screen and window parameters,
i.e. the chosen values are lost and Infocom will use the system defaults
when it is run.

	* Infocom windows on the Workbench screen are now sized with
	  respect to the visible size of the display.
	* The German version of "Zork 1" now displays text correctly.
	* Graphics in "Beyond Zork" can now be scaled, so that any fixed
	  width font can be used (as for any other version 5 game).

1.75	* Support for both the Amiga and Macintosh sound files supplied
	  with some releases of "Sherlock". Note that the structure of the
	  #?.mid files accompaying the sound data is not understood, so
	  in some circumstances a sound may not play exactly as it does
	  with the official Infocom interpreter. If anyone comes across
	  such an event, please let me know.
	* Scrolling of location descriptions that are longer than the
	  text window in "Beyond Zork" now works. Use Alt-Cursor Up and
	  Alt-Cursor Down to scroll.
	* AppIcon Support. Game files can be dropped on the startup window
	  and saved game files can be dropped on the game window.
	* Fixed some problems with two new Inform-compiled games:
	   * Time-outs can now occur for single key presses. Found in
	     "Freefall", a Tetris clone (honestly).
	   * The screen is now cleared on restarting a game. Found in
	     "Theatre".
	* Version 8 games (as produced by Inform) are now supported. This
	  format is essentially the same as version 5, except that the
	  maximum game size is increased to 512K.
	* Added "Reset" menu to InfoPrefs, to allow the screen and window
	  parameters to be reset to the default.
	* The script window can now have a user defined gadget to select an
	  output file or device.
	* For version 3 games the Infocom window can be resized
	  horizontally as well as vertically (if Infocom is running in a
	  Workbench window with window sizing enabled).
	* For version 3 games using a proportional font, the text can be
	  right justified.
	* Added new "Game", "Command" and "Options" menus.

2.00	* Changed the version number to 2.00 for a new feature:
	  Proportional font support for *all* games. If you use InfoPrefs
	  to set the fonts used in the game, then the proportional and
	  fixed fonts must have the same height. This now means that there
	  are no limitations when playing version 5 (and 8) games over
	  playing version 3 games.

	* Horizontal window sizing is now allowed for all game versions.
	* For the timed input opcodes (used in "Border Zone", "FreeFall"),
	  the clock is now only running when the window is active.
	* The command line history no longer saves repeats of the same
	  command.
	* The menu shortcuts for "Save" and "Restore" have been changed to
	  "S" and "O" respectively, the Amiga defaults for saving and
	  opening files.
	* Fixed problems when saving or restoring files when using stdio.
	* Hopefully fixed all problems with the "Sherlock" sound files.

2.01	* Accented characters (e.g. ä) work correctly in both input and
 	  output, and in vocabulary listings.
	* Single key press timeouts have been changed to be a multiple of
	  1/10th second, as used by Freefall (Release 2).
	* Switching from proportional to fixed width fonts in the middle
	  of a line (as used in the Inform game "MST3000") now works.
	* The 'Esc' key is handled correctly (it steps back through the
	  help menus in Inform games).
	* An optional routine in the game to be called after a sound effect
	  is played is now handled. This means that the fading in and out
	  (as used in "Sherlock" when a cab arrives) works correctly.
	* New Shell option -u, for use with the -c option and a defined
	  saved game file. This option allows for up to 10 numbered save
	  files to be used, rather than just one.
	* The 'Del' key no longer crashes the interpreter in stdio mode.

2.01a	* Added 'Important' section to this documentation.
