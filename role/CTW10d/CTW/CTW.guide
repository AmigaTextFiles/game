                            Introduction

Almost everyone in the known universe has played some sort of Role Playing
Game before.  It was either some text-based thing @{fg fill}(like Dungeons & Dragons)@{fg text}
or something with square-based graphics @{fg fill}(like Final Fantasy)@{fg text}.  Both of these
had their advantages...D&D has loads of cool dice, but FF has a nifty
2-button NES controller.

Well, those wacky guys at SquareSoft @{fg shine}(did I mention I don't own a single
word of this document?  That everyone else holds their own trademarks,
copyrights, patents, remote controls, etc., and if you have a complaint
about it, write me with a non-threatening letter and I'll change it to
something like "Well, those wacky guys oven in Japan who write Role Playing
Games for video game consoles that have to do with orbs, clocks, and
towers...")@{fg text} came out with a really great Role Playing Game known as Chrono
Trigger.  It blew my socks off!  Its my favorite SNES @{fg fill}(or, "Console-based
computer capable of...")@{fg text} game ever!

So, after finishing the game, I was sitting in front of my computer with the
same name as the Spanish word for "girl", thinking of something cool to
write. In Amos Professional @{fg fill}(Europress doesn't care)@{fg text}.  And I looked over at
my cart of Chrono Trigger.  And I said, "I can do that!  Well, not as good,
but better than anyone else has done on the Amiga!"  And I did.  And you
just downloaded it. Congratulations!

You now own a Game Creation System so flexible, you can do almost anything
with it!  With the following features at you fingertips:

@{fg shine}         * 64 Color EHB Graphics
         * Oversized Gaming Screens
         * Full Menuing System (even accesible by Scripts!)
         * Real-Time Fighting
         * 80+ Command Scripting Language, allowing control of
           even the smallest aspect of the game
         * 256 Global Variables, plus 64 Local Variables for each
           script
         * Number Of Simultaneous Scripts Limited By Computer
           Speed (8 is OK on my 68000, a couple zillion is OK for
           an '060)
         * 10 Frames Of Animation Possible For Each Character Pose@{fg text}

You will have no problems whatsoever with coming up with great games for
distribution.  Now, as for great storylines...

@node "Install" "Installation                "
@prev "Intro"
                        Installation

Installation is rather simple.  It involves two parts:  Putting all the
files where they belong, and telling the computer where they are.

Putting the files in the proper places is as easy as unlharcing the files
into a directory on your hard drive.  It'll create a drawer for everything,
and make a proper heirarchy for the game.  Because you're reading this, I'll
assume you've done this, and will proceed to step 2.

This one is slightly more complex, but only slightly.  You have to make an
assign to the directory you created.  The name of the directory you want is
the one that contains the CTW_Editor and CTW_Engine programs.  You'll have
to put this command in the file S:User-Startup.  Open a Shell and type the
following:

    @{fg shine}ed S:User-Startup@{fg text}

Now, go to the end of the file and type in the following:

    @{fg shine}assign RPG: <fill in the directory>@{fg text}

Now, Save the file and Quit.  You'll have to restart your computer to make
the changes stick.

@node "Req" "Requirements                "
                             Requirements

To run the CTW Programs, all you need is an Amiga with at least 1.5 Meg of
Ram. Preferably 1 Meg of Chip and a Meg or two of Fast is best.  Any
processor will do, but, as usual, the faster the better.  Any adventure will
run on any processor, but not every adventure will run on every memory
configuration.  Take this into mind during adventure creation.

A hard drive or something similar (Zip, Jaz, Bernoulli, whatever) is also
great. A floppy disk will have a hard time holding all the info, especially
the maps.

You'll also need the XPK User Libraries.  These you can get off Aminet or a
couple hundred other places off the Internet.
@endnode

@node "Sample" "Playing The Sample Adventure"
So, you want to try out the really lame sample adventure?  OK!  Just run the
CTW_Engine and you're on your way!

OK, some explination might be in order.  The controls use the joystick and
keyboard (and the mouse) to do everything.  Here they are:

@{fg fill}    Joy Left                           Walk Left
                                       Move Battle Selector Clockwise
                                       Move Rot-Menu Clockwise
     Joy Right                              Walk Right
                                       Move Battle Selector Counter-Clock
                                       Move Rot-Menu Counter-Clockwise
    Joy Up                             Walk Up
                                       Move Text Menu Pointer Up
    Joy Down                           Walk Down
                                       Move Text Menu Pointer Down
    Joy Fire                           Touch A Character
                                       Select
    Return Key                         Bring Up Player Menu
    'Q' Key                            Quit Game
    Mouse                              Load & Save Games@{fg text}

In the Player Menu are the following options:

@{fg fill}    Items/Equip    -    Equip     -    Weapon    -    (choose item)
                                       Armor     -    (choose item)
                                       Gloves    -    (choose item)
                                       Hat       -    (choose item)
                        Use       -    (choose item)

    Stats          -    HP/MHP
                        Atk/Def
                        Experience
                        Str/Dex/Int
                        Creds

    Load/Save      -    Load Game
                        Save Game@{fg text}

These is a Cancel Option in every sub-menu to move back to the previous
menu.

And, apart from all this, the usual RPG stuff comes into play:  Talk to
everyone, fight for Experience, carry plenty of Healing things, get load of
money, yadda yadda yadda.

@node "Edit" "Making Your Own Masterpiece "
                             The CTW Editor

OK.  Time to get to the tough part.  Making your adventures.  I wrote the
Editor for power, to cut down on the number of utilities needed to make an
adventure. Before, I needed my old Editor, a text editor, the Amos Sprite
Editor, and a couple of custom programs to complete an adventure.  Now, all
you need is the Editor.  OK, you need a paint program too.

Even though its powerful, I haven't made it super user-friendly.  I tried as
best as I could, but, in order to cram as many buttons onto a screen at
once, I had to eliminate some descriptions on some things.  So, without
further adieu, here is the manual for the Editor.

  Screen Layout

@{fg fill}  ##TITLE BAR############################################@{fg text}

@{fg shine}                   The Current Editor
              Tool Will Have Its Information
                     In This Window@{fg text}




         These Buttons Represent The Editor Tools
  @{fg shine}@{bg shadow}!!!!@@@@####$$$$%%^^^^&&&&****(((())))!!!!@@@@####$$$@{fg text}@{bg back}
  @{fg shine}@{bg shadow}!!!!@@@@####$$$$%%^^^^&&&&****(((())))!!!!@@@@####$$$@{fg text}@{bg back}
              Click On Them To Switch Tools

The program also has a menuing system a bit more powerful than Amos' regular
old crappy menus.  Right-click to bring it up.  Left-click to choose options
from the menu.  Right-clicking again moves back through the menu.

If you want to quit the editor, just hit F10.

Here are the individual tools:

                                    The Button Looks Like...
    @{"The Ten Text Editors         " link "TextEdit" 0}  A Text Editor
    @{"The Sprite Editor            " link "SpriteEdit" 0}  A Painting
    @{"The Level Editor             " link "LevEdit" 0}  A Tree With A Red Arrow Window
    @{"The Picture Compactor        " link "PicEdit" 0}  A Tree With Binary Code
    @{"The Zone Editor              " link "ZoneEdit" 0}  A City With A Pointer Dragging A Zone
    @{"The Item Editor              " link "ItemEdit" 0}  A Sword
    @{"The FrameSet Editor          " link "FrameSet" 0}  A Film

Well, first, I'd like to thank me for being so wonderful.  Yes, I know, I
deserve it.  8^)

Then, I'd like to thank Sean Deal for taking the time to get it running on
the copy of UAE I gave him.  The sound still sucks, though.

Then, there was that guy on the Amos Mailing List that tried it out and had
no problems with it.  If you're out there, tell me!

Then, there's Commodore.  Yeah, they screwed up.  But they invented the
Amiga in the first place, so they can't be all bad.

Now, I'd like to free myself from all legal ownership of anything I said in
here.  Everything in here is not © John Bintz.  Most likely someone else
owns it, and, if they do, that's great.  But, I'm the one with the power of
updates, so don't screw me over and put your name in here.  I have the
source code, BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

And, once I get some Beta-Testers for the Editor, they can be in here, too.
Gr¡cias!

How do you find the elusive John Bintz?  If he's not at Villa Julie College,
or on the Beltway, or at Wards working in the Menswear Department, he's at
home. And he'll be checking his mail for the account at:

@{fg shine}    uv334@freenet.victoria.bc.ca@{fg text}

And, this should work, too:

@{fg shine}    s-jobicu@mail.vjc.edu@{fg text}

And, even THIS one will work...kinda:

@{fg shine}    bintzer@pop.erols.com@{fg text}

And, if you want to go to my HORRIBLY OUTDATED WEB PAGES FULL OF BLOOD AND
GORE AND CARE BEARS AND CARTOONY DRAWINGS AND SOFTWARE:

@{fg shine}    http://www.dragonfire.net/~JohnBintz/home.html@{fg text}

And, if you want to get on my good side when I make this a product requiring

@{fg shine}    John Bintz
    1715 Bren-Will Drive
    Westminster MD  USA  21158-2710@{fg text}

And, if you make a game on CTW, I'd like to see it.  Just LhArc it onto some
floppies or stick it FTP.  Just don't EMail it to me, please?!?!?

@node "PicEdit" "The Picture Compactor     "
The Picture Compactor uses a combination of Amos Spack routines (a bit
better than standard IFF) and the XPK Nuke Library (shrinks it about another
10%) to cram as many onto a drive as possible.  The screen layout is very
simple; detailed directions are not necessary.

  Compress Picture - Take an IFF image and shrink it into an SPK/Nuke File
                     Use this image as the current Level Map
  Uncompress Picture - Take current SPK/Nuke File and save it as IFF

@node "ItemEdit" "The Item Editor           "
The Items Editor edits the Items.Data file in the RPG: drawer.  These are
all the items the player can get, have, sell, or buy.  The layout of the
editor, from top to bottom, is as follows...

@{fg shine}    Name Of Object (no spaces, please!)

    Weapon Power   (enter a number)    (used if Weapon)
    Armor Power    (ditto)             (used if Armor, Gloves, or Hat)
    HP Restored    (same here)         (used if HP Restorer)
    Item Cost      (# goes here)       (used for BUY & SELL commands)
    Item Type      Weapon/Armor/Gloves/Hat/HP Restorer/Custom
                   (move through list)

    (backward through items) (forward through items)@{fg text}

For example, if you're making a Sword of Infinite Doom with a power of 300,
but it'll cost 20000, you'd set the Name to "Sword_Of_Infinite_Doom" (or
something like that, without quotes), the Weapon Power to 300, and the Cost
to 20000. Then, you'd set the Type to Weapon.

Now, you want the Armor of Cheese.  It'll have a defensive power ot 4, and
cost 35.  Set the name to "Armor_Of_Cheese", Armor Power to 4, and Cost to
35.  But, the game'll think its a weapon, so set the type to Armor.

You can make things like access cards, money bags, watches, all sorts of
things. Its quite flexible.  Really.

@node "FrameSet" "The FrameSet Editor       "
The FrameSet Editor is the place where you set up the animations for the
characters.  You can have up to ten frames per animation, and these frames
fome from the Sprites you drew in the Sprite Editor.

When you set up a character, you have to specify a FrameSetBase.  This Base
uses certain offsets to control which animation is displayed during certain
actions. The offsets, and their actions, are as follows:

@{fg fill}         Base+0              Walking Toward You
         Base+1              Walking Away From You
         Base+2              Walking Left
         Base+3              Walking Right
@{fg text}         (if the character fights, you'll need these next four, too)
@{fg fill}         Base+4              Get Ready For Battle
         Base+5              Ready Stance
         Base+6              Leap Toward Enemy
         Base+7              Attack!

@{fg text}So, if you have an axe-weilding lady, you'd need to draw walking frames (a
cuople for each direction), an animation to whip out her axe, an animation
for standing there, an animation for her leaping at an enemy, and one of her
taking a swing at him, and then put them in the appropriate FrameSets.

The Editor is set up as follows:

    @{fg shine} _____________________________@{fg text}

The large box in the upper-left is the current animation.  The smaller boxes
below it are the ten frames of animation.  To place a picture in the frame,
left click it.  To remove it, right-click it.  In order for the animation to
wrok right, the animation@{fg shine} MUST START FROM THE LEFTMOST BOX AND CONTINUE
WITHOUT ANY GAPS!@{fg text}

Where it says Mainbank.sbobs is where the name of the Sprite File goes. When
you save the Sprite File, it goes in the RPG: directory.  Type in the name
you gave it here.

Below this is the Memory Location Selector.  This differs from FrameSets.
This lets you select what part of the memory allocated for FrameSet info
you're looking at.  An Example:

@{fg fill}  Area #0  Frames 1,2,3,4,5,6         FrameSet #1
  Area #1  Frames 7,8,9,10,11,12      FrameSet #2
  Area #2  Frames 13,14,15,16,17,18   FrameSet #3
  Area #3  Frames 19,20,21,22,23,24   FrameSet #4
  Area #4  Frames 57                  FrameSet #4090@{fg text}

Below this is the FrameSet Modifier.  It has four settings:  No Change,
which does nothing; ConstantAnim, which constantly animates a FrameSet, not
just when it moves; HorizFlip and VertFlip, which flip Sprites around to
reuse images and save memory.

Below THIS is the Sprite Picture Selector.  Use the arrows on the left &
right to choose a picture to put into the frames.

Right of this is the FrameSet selector.  This lets you set the FrameSet this
animation represents.

Above, I chose 4090 for a FrameSet, and with good reason.  FrameSet 4090
(the first picture, at least) represents the on-screen pointer.  This always
points right.  You'll definitely need one of these, or it'll be hard to
select stuff.

The menu Heirarchy is a simple one:

@{fg fill}    File      -    Save Frames.Data...      Save the FrameSet file
                                            CTW wants it called
                                            Frames.Data, in the RPG: drawer
                   Load Frames.Data...      Load a FrameSet file
                   Clear                    Clear All Memory Areas@{fg text}
