SSG generates random solar systems complete with info about suns, planets, 
and moons. The method of generating these systems is picked from GURPS(tm) 
SPACE, but the data generated could be used in any science fiction RPG.

Hint: There is no documentation, but if you type 'SSG ?' followed by 
      another '?', you will get some help.
