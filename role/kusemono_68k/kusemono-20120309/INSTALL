how to install kusemono

* system requirement

To compile kusemono, you need:

  + C compiler
  + standard C library (libc)
  + curses library (libncurses or equivalent)
  + make

* configuration macros

Define or undefine these C macros in the file config.h to change
how the program works.  All changes must be made before the program
is compiled.

  + HAVE_TERM_H
  Define it if the curses library has a _working_ <term.h> header file.
  (The user of PDCurses should _NOT_ define this macro because its
  implementation of interfaces to terminfo database is broken.)

  If the macro is not defined, the program skips checking the size
  and color support of the window.  The game itself doesn't use
  term.h directly; the macro can be safely undefined if you know that
  your window is good.  This does not mean the window can be smaller
  or can lack color support.

  + USE_HOME_TO_SAVE
  Define it if you save and load the game in the directory ".kusemono"
  in the home directory (the value of environment variable "HOME")
  instead of the current directory by default.  Note that you can use
  a different save directory at run time with the --save-dir command line
  option.

  + HAVE_IO_H
  Define it if your C library declares the mkdir() function in <io.h>
  instead of <sys/stat.h>.  (The user of mingw32 may want to define it.)

* installation command

To compile kusemono, type:

  make

You don't need to run "make install"; the program can be placed anywhere,
it doesn't need any setuid or setgid privilege and it doesn't read
any file except for a game save file.

The Makefile doesn't use any built-in rule or variable.  You can use
the -r and -R options of make.

* Makefile variable

  + CC
  The name of the C compiler.  The default is gcc.
  + CC_WARNINGS
  The options of the C compiler for warning.  The default value is very long.
  If you have difficulty in reading the build log, override this value;
  'CC_WARNINGS=-Wall' will be a good choice.
  + CFLAGS
  The options given to the C compiler whenever it is called.  The default
  value includes options for optimization.  The options used only when
  linking should be given in LDFLAGS or LIBS, not here.
  + CPPFLAGS
  The options of the C compiler for compiling.  If you place header files
  in a non-standard path, you need -I options here.
  + LDFLAGS
  The options of the C compiler for linking.  If you place libraries
  in a non-standard path, you need -L options here.  Do _NOT_ include
  the -l options here; use LIBS instead.
  + LIBS
  The options of the C compiler for specifying the names of the library
  to link with.  It must include an option something like -lncurses
  to link with the curses library.
