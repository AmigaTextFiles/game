[ North / South ; West ' East

Notes on commands:
   Attack: Select what to attack by cycling through the possible targets
      with [ and /, or with ; and '.  CHECK YOUR TARGETS BEFORE YOU FIRE!
      It would be very messy if you attacked a guard, for instance, when
      you meant to attack someone, or something, else.
   Fire: Used to fire cannons on ships, in any direction.
   Peer at gem: This is not an option in some towns, Castle Pergamum for
      instance.  If you try it in such towns, a gem will be used up, but
      you will get no map.  Try to remember not to repeat this mistake, so
      that you will not use up gems.
   Quit and save: You can only save in worlds and dungeons, not in towns.
      Whether or not you save, you have the option to quit.  Save often.
   Search: Used to search for objects, and, occasionally at the bottom of
      dungeons, hidden portals.
   Ztats: This command gives only a partial list of your attributes.  To get
      the rest of the story, press R for a list of weapons, W for a list of
      armour, and Y for a list of useable objects.

Note on walking:
   Do not walk into walls looking for hidden doors!

                               HOW TO REGISTER
============================================================================>

To register as a user of Antepenult, follow these steps:

   1. Boot up the game and copy down the version # and serial #, the one that
      looks like a Canadian ZIP code.
   2. Send them to me accompanied by a check for $10 (or $5 if you're cheap).
   3. I will send you back a code you can enter into Antepenult to get certain
      "perks."  These will help you, but not much, and I must emphasize that
      you do NOT need to register in order to complete the game successfully.

============================================================================>

   1. ANTEP is the game program itself.  To run it, CD to the directory
      containing all these files, and type ANTEP.  Or, from Workbench,
      click on the icon.
   2. ANTEP.INFO is the icon.
   3. ANTEPSTUFF is the data file that contains all the maps, text, and
      character data.
   4. ORIGANTEPSTUFF is the copy of ANTEPSTUFF that you should have made.
   5. READTHENEXEC makes said copy of ANTEPSTUFF.
   6. README is this file.

This program, as well as the many programs needed to compile AntepStuff,
were all written with MicroEMACS, compiled with Manx 3.6a, and debugged with
SDB.  Thanks to the author of DiskX who saved me from having to reformat my
hard disk a few days ago.  Thanks to the author, wherever he may be, of my
antiquated version of NGI.  Thanks to Lord Sylvan alias the TRAVEL(L)ER
himself for ideas and help (send him money for an Amiga).

Version 1.1 has slightly faster screen refreshes and a few bug fixes.
