@node installation "Installation"
Installation

Copy the drawer containing the program to your harddrive.
copy the files in libs/ and devs/ to libs/ and devs/ on your
harddrive. You may have to reboot before playing to get the
new libs and device loaded.

Thats all!

Note: If you do not copy the versions of translator.library
      and narrator.device contained in the archive the talking
      can sound weird.

@node usage "How to Play"
How to Play

Here are some rough instructions:

Use the mouse to play. Left clicking on objects usually
gives you a description or picks them up. Right clicking
brings up your inventory screen. If you select an item from
the inventory by left clicking, you can use it on the play
screen by left clicking.

A few things to watch for (hints):
you cannot use an item on an enemy while he is talking
enemies cannot defeat your character for good, they are just obstacles
check everything, it is a tricky game ;)
you must find something to beat the first boss with before proceeding left
(maybe you can help someone?)
