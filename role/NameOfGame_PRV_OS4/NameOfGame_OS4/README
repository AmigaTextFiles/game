NEW GAME
========

You begin as a man in a small town.
There are many houses in this town, a tavern, and an inn.
You can't do anything in the buildings yet.
There are several screens of your world, so you can go off the edge into
a new section of the world.

?               Help
                The help screen lists 41 different commands ... maybe about 
                5 work.
                However these can get you excited for what the game will 
                be like later.
