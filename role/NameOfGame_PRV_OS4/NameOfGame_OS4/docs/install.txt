         How to Install Name of Game          
               by Andrew Weber                
==============================================

To install on Linux stay in this directory and type:

$ make

To remove the program and the object files type:

$ make clean

The game currently runs in the folder it is in.
To install it in, for example, /usr/local/
you must edit src/Makefile
Change PREFIX to /usr/local/

Then type:

$ make install

The game binary will be installed in /usr/local/bin/
and the data files will be installed in
/usr/local/share/nameofgame/
