The story of Panic Society

Gaia, The environmentalist God of Nature.

	The New Age Bible.

	In the beginning Gaia created,
a land called America.
	A land of wilderness,
of pure air, clean water,
and unspoiled beauty.
	And in the West, Gaia created,
Great forest of Redwood,
pondrosa pines, blue spruce,
and hemlock of all sizes.
	And, the forest were endless.
	And in those forest Gaia placed,
the Spotted Horn Owl,
which reigned supreme.
	And Gaia created rivers and streams.
	And the rivers and streams ran clear,
from the mountains of glaciers, down to the sea,
filled with Salmon of all species and kind.
	And in this land Gaia created,
the Great Plains,
an endless sea of grass.
	And on that sea Gaia placed,
great herds of buffalo,
so great were those herds,
that the sun could be blotted out,
from the dust of their stampede.
	And through those plains Gaia placed,
a great river,
It was home to all manner of fish and fowls.
	And scattered through the plains Gaia placed,
thousands of ponds and wetlands.
	And those ponds and wetlands,
became homes to an endless variety of waterfowl,
as they migrated North in the Spring,
or South in the Fall.
	And on the edge of those Great plains,
Gaia created five Great Lakes,
each lake of fresh water as large as a sea.
	And those lakes were abundant,
with fish and waterfowl alike.
	Great white pine forests,
Gaia placed along the shores.
They covered vast expanses,
of sand dunes and rolling moraines.
	And to the East Gaia created,
rolling hills and mountains.
	And those rolling hills and mountains,
grew great forests of oaks and maples.
	Those forest supported,
an abundance of deer, bear, foxes, raccoon,
and a thousand other species, of animals of all kinds.
	And to the North Gaia created,
great forests of Cedar.
They were home to the Wolf,
the Moose, the Loon,
and many other species.
	And in the North Gaia created,
an abundance of lakes and streams.
Those lakes and streams were home,
to an abundance of Pike and Sturgeon.
	And to the far North Gaia created,
a great tundra that was home,
for Caribou and migratory birds.
	And to the South West Gaia created,
a great desert.
This desert had an abundance,
of wild flowers, cactus, and desert tortuses.
	And to the South Gaia created,
the great Rain Forest.
It held an abundance,
of rare plants and animals.
	This great Rain Forests protected the soil,
provided abundant food for the animals,
and purified the air.
	And to watch over this land,
and marvel at it, Gaia created,
the Native American in her own image.
	And in all the Americas,
The Native American lived in perfect harmony with Gaia.
	And it was paradise.

	But, then it happened.
	In the post year of Gaia, 1492,
the Evil White European, Christopher Columbus,
stumbled onto America.
	He found a land rich in resources,
unspoiled beauty,
clean air and water,
with Native Americans,
living in perfect harmony with Gaia.
	And he said to his crew,
"we must exploit this land,
take its gold,
and return home to tell others.
	And he exploited the land looking for its gold,
and not finding any, kidnapped Native Americans
and sailed home to tell others.
	Soon they came,
those Evil White Europeans,
to rape, to plunder, to seek gold, to pollute,
to murder, to overpopulate, and get filthy rich,
off the misery of others.
	Next came the Evil Cortez,
looking for gold.
	And when the Native Americans,
failed to give him gold,
he got very mad.
And declared war on Native American,
and looted and killed while searching for gold.
	What he didn't kill,
he murdered with disease.
	Pounce De Leon came next,
looking for the fountain of youth.
He didn't find it.
But, destroyed Florida in the process.
	And then came the Mayflower,
in the year 1620.
It landed in America,
in a place called Plymouth,
the land of great oak and maple forests.
	And the Evil White Europeans,
of the Mayflower,
formed their first settlement,
in the place called Plymonth.
	They cut down the forest,
to build a great stinking city called Boston,
which filled the air with choking smog,
poisoned the waters with sewage,
created huge mountains of rotting garbage,
and becoming rampid with crime.
	They cleared the virgin forest,
to plant wheat and field corn,
to feed the evil cattle they brought with them,
that belched greenhouse gases,
that they murdered to make corn beef,
to keep them overfed with unhealthy fat.
	They murdered the deer and Turkey.
Then, turned loose more evil cattle,
to eat up the forest meadows,
to belch more greenhouse gases,
to murder to make beef jerky,
to keep them overfed with unhealthy fat.
	They took all the fish,
from the lakes and the sea.
Then, they built whaleing ships,
to go murder the whales.
and let loose their rats,
which further ruined the wilderness.
	They came to America,
in ever increasing numbers. 
ever so fruitful,
multiplying like lemmings.
	Other colonies they formed,
to the deep South.
Here, those Evil White Europeans,
made slaves of the Africans,
stuffing them in the holds of ships,
murdering 200 million of them,
then, forcing them to cut down,
the forest and bayous,
and bury the land with cotton and tobacco.
	The Evil White European,
Soon made their move Westward.
	They found the Great lakes,
and began to exploit them.
	They netted most of the fish,
from the lakes and the rivers.
The Sea Lamprey that came with them,
soon killed all the rest.
	They logged the pine forest,
they said would last a thousand years,
but, in less then fifty,
only blackened stumps remained.
	They plowed up the land,
to plant wheat and field corn,
to fatten their evil cattle,
that belch greenhouse gases,
to murder to make sirloins,
so they could be overfed, 
with more unhealthy fat
	and drove the Native Americans,
ever further westward,
as they took the land away from them.
	They built more great stinking cities,
that filled the air with smog,
poisoned the waters with sewage,
made huge mountains of garbage,
and becoming rampid with crime.
	They moved ever Westward,
seaking more land to destroy.
	They found the Great Plains,
and began to exploit them.
	and murdered the buffalo,
until 50 were left.
	They plowed under the grass,
filling in the ponds and wetlands,
to plant their wheat and corn,
to fatten their evil cattle.
that belched greenhouse gases,
to murder for T-Bone,
to keep them overfed,
with unhealthy fat.
	They dammed the great river,
and built greater levies.
	and built more great stinking cities,
to fill the air with smog,
poison the waters with sewage,
make huge mountains of garbage,
and become rampid with crime.
	They drove the Native American,
even further Westward.
in the never ending quest,
to destroy more land.
	They soon reached the Pacific,
a land of great forest,
and dammed the great rivers,
killing off all the salmon.
	They logged off the forest,
so the spotted horn owl was now homeless.
	They blasted hillsides and mountains,
with high pressure water,
leaving great scars of erosion,
in their greedy quest for gold.
	And built more great stinking cities,
that filled the air with smog,
poisoned the waters with sewage,
made huge mountains of garbage,
and became rampid with crime.
	Northward they traveled,
to murder the caribou.
Southward they traveled,
to burn down the rain forest,
to make more pasture,
to feed their evil cattle,
that belched greenhouse gases,
that were soon murdered,
so they could get overfed,
with greasy McDonald hamburgers.
The Native Americans now homeless,
The Evil White European had taken it all.
	Still, they came by the millions,
the Evil White Europeans 
They were fruitful and multiplied,
and soon filled the land,
with their great stinking cities,
that now filled the air with smog,
poisoned the waters with sewage,
make huge mountains of garbage,
and becoming rampid with crime,
from exploited minorities.
	The East was a shambles,
its lakes all but dead,
from the attack of acid rain,
and mountains of filth.
	The Great lakes were dying,
their waters dirty and stinking.
from all of the sewage,
and other toxic waste dumped in them.
	The Great plains were barren,
the Buffalo now gone. 
the grasses replaced with endless fields of corn,
to feed those evil cattle,
that belched greenhouse gases,
that were murdered for T-Bone,
to keep Evil White Europeans overfed,
as they got fatter and fatter,
from that artery clogging fat.
	Gaping holes and gullies were common,
as a result of strip mining.
poisons leaching from those holes,
fouling the air and the waters.
	The cedar forests were gone,
lakes and rivers polluted,
the Caribou starving,
as their migration routes,
were blocked by giant pipelines,
used to fuel the refineries,
to fuel the evil autos,
that belched toxic smoke.
racing on the ribbons of concrete,
that covered the land,
and flattened any animal,
that dared to cross them.
	All the rivers were altered
confined by dams and levies,
their waters murky and dirty,
filled with silt and smelling of sewage.
	Gaia could take it no more.
	In the year 1920,
Gaia sent in the winds,
to blow away the topsoil,
of the barren Great plains.
	But, the Evil White Europeans,
refused to give in.
	In the year 1986,
a heat wave Gaia sent.
Great forest fires were started,
they blotted out the sun.
The corn crop a failure.
The evil cattle starving,
But, the Evil White Europeans,
refused to give in.
	In 1993 Gaia tried something different.
fifty days of downpours,
on the great river.
It overwelmed the dams,
and all the great levies,
and flooded the evil farms,
and the great stinking cities,
that filled the air with smog,
poisoned the waters with sewage,
making huge mountains of garbage,
and becoming rampid with crime.
But, the Evil White Europeans,
refused to give in.
as they continued,
to destroy the land.
	Volcanos erupted,
Earthquakes shook the land
	The oppressed minorities,
of those great stinking cities,
turned to rioting, burning, looting and killing.
But, the Evil White Europeans,
refused to give in.
	The Southwestern deserts,
were invaded by dune buggies.
The cactus, wildflowers,and desert tortuses destroyed.
	The Great Rain Forest,
were soon all burned off.
	And all over the land,
were the scars of strip mines,
the dumps, the landfills,
the chemical plants,
all poisoning the water,
and the rest of the land.
	Ribbons of concrete,
cut through the country,
filled with smoke belching traffic,
of evil automobile,
that flattened any animal,
that dared to crossed them.
	Endless wires,
of copper were hung everywhere,
and carried deadly electricity everywhere.
	Poison belched from chimneys,
toxin from drain pipes,
Pesticides sprayed on the land,
precious water pumped from the ground.
	All to grow the wheat and field corn,
to feed the evil cattle,
that belched greenhouse gases,
to be murdered for roast beef,
to overfeed the evil White Europeans,
with unhealthy fat.
living in their great stinking cities,
filling the air with smog,
poisoning the waters with sewage,
making huge mountains of garbage,
and becoming rampid with crime.
	The air full of poisons,
the ozone thinning,
the waters polluted,
the great glaciers melting,
the oceans rising,
global warming occurring,
Gaia was dying.

	And, Your Glorious Leaders,
the environmentalist, the animal rights activists,
the Hollywood Left, the socialist,
and the flower children of the 60's
looked around and were alarmed.
	They saw what had happened,
to all the great forest,
They were horrified at what,
happened to the Great lakes,
They saw the deformed eagles,
poisoned by the DDT.
They saw the scars on the land,
They saw the endless fields of corn,
they saw the abuse of animals,
the certain extinction of others.
They saw how the evil cattle,
were belching greenhouse gases,
and tearing up the meadows,
and eating up grain,
that could have been used,
to feed the starving millions,
of the Third World.
They saw the great stinking cities,
filling the air with smog,
poisoning the waters with sewage,
making huge mountains of garbage,
and becoming rampid with crime.
full of angry minorities,
being exploited by Evil White Europeans,
that became filthy rich,
and how this poisonous lifestyles,
was killing their Gaia.
	And they said,
"We must act now to save Gaia,
before its too late!"
	Their first step was to get,
A Liberal, Bill Clinton,
elected, President of the US.
	Then, your hero AlGore,
soon took control.
	Then, They passed all kinds of laws
to stop all the damage,
being done to Gaia,
by the Evil White Europeans,
That were getting filthy rich,
by distroying the land,
with their poisonous lifestyles.
	They put an end to logging,
so the Spotted Horn Owl could have a home.
The tore down the dams,
so the salmon could run free.
	They raised taxes real high,
and spent money galore.
They did this to punish,
the greedy evil White Europeans,
were were getting filthy rich,
from living high on the hog,
and destroying the land,
with their poisonous lifestyles.
	They passed gun control laws,
to stop the hunt.
They put breeding bans on domestic animals,
to stop their exploitation.
They put all forest off limits,
to the evil cattle,
that were stripping the meadows of food,
for the wild animals,
that were belching greenhouse gases,
to cause global warming.
	They passed all kinds of laws,
to give rights to plants and animals
and take away those rights,
from the Evil White Europeans.
	They passed immigration laws,
to stop the invasion,
of Evil White Europeans,
from filling the land.
	They did everything possible,
to encourage abortion,
to break up the families,
to stop people from being born.
	They passed laws and restrictions,
and everything that they could,
to take money away from the rich,
to make everyone poor.
	"But it wasn't enough",
said Earth First! co- founder Dave Foreman,
"We humans have become a disease,
Its called the Human pox."
	"There are too many people,
on this great Earth.
They are causing great damage,
in their environment.
If something isn't done now,
wild plants and animals will perish."
	Your Hero Dave Foreman,
he couldn't do much,
He was in prison,
Evil White Europeans called him a terrorist nut.
His followers soon developed,
a virus to do the job for him.
It was Species Specific,
It was the perfect solution.
	The great plague was the blessing,
that Gaia needed.
It wiped out most,
of the Evil White Europeans.
It also killed,
other that were overpopulating,
and brought down their numbers,
to about 100 million.
	Now, your new world leader,
Hillery Clinton,
along with her other, liberal followers,
could now enact their plan,
to save the planet.
	They took over control,
of all the evil nations.
They forced the survivors,
to clean up this planet.
	They smashed the great stinking cities,
so they no longer,
filled the air with smog,
poisoned the waters with sewage,
make huge mountains of garbage,
and become rampid with crime.
full of angry minorities,
being exploited,
by the Evil White Europeans.
	They ripped out the Ribbons of concrete,
that cut through the land,
filled with smoke belching traffic,
killing helpless animals everywhere.
They ripped out the copper,
and aluminum wires,
that were hung all over the land,
carrying deadly electricity everywhere.
	They took all the money,
away from Evil White Europeans,
and gave it all to the exploited Africans.
	They spayed and neutered,
all the exploited dogs and cats.
and then set them free,
away from their evil masters.
	They wiped out the farms,
the wheat and field corn.
They sterilized the evil cattle,
so they would breed no more.
	In place of the farm fields
new forests were planted,
the great sea of grass,
the animals set free.
	They then move the remaining people,
those Evil White Europeans,
the African, Asian,
and India Indians
back to the country,
of their origins.
	A great cry arose,
from those evil people.
"Why are you forcing us?
into super safe housing?"
	It's for the good of of Gaia,
that we do this.
Besides, it is for,
your own good and well being.
	And when the great Exodus was finally over,
When the evil people were moved out of America,
and the land returned to meadows and forest,
and the waters once again were clean,
and the wildlife could live undisturbed,
and the air was once again pure.
	The Native American was returned,
to live in this land In peace and harmony with Gaia,
as they did before the Evil White Europeans,
took it all away from them. 
	And the land once again became paradise.

	This poem dedicated to your Glorious Leaders,
the Flower Children of the 60s,
which are now the Blooming Idiots in Washington today.

Peace, Harmonic Convergence,
and all that psycho babbleing.
