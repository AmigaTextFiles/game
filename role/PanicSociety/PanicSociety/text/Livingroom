Your Super Safe Living Room

	All living rooms in the Panic Society are the same. Your 
living room is designed by Hillery Clinton to be simple, safe and 
functional. It is constructed by ACME inc. from soft, safe, 
nonflamable, non toxic, environmentally safe materials.

	Each living room comes with a flat screen super safe 
television, a information terminal, a super safe lounge chair, a 
surveillance camera, and tannoy propaganda public address system.

	The door leads into the service hallway and is for use by 
robo control. There are no dangerous door knobs.

	Lighting is by broad spectrum, low power, UV free, computer 
controlled ACME lighting system.

	The ceiling and walls are painted Eyerest green. The floor, 
is carpeted with earth green. This carpet is free of any lint or 
other chemicals that have been determined to cause illness and 
death among young children in the 20th century.

	There are no dangerous windows, electrical outlets, power 
cords, or other hazards in your super safe house.
