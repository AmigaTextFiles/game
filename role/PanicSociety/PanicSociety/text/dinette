The Super Safe Dinette

	This room has been especially designed by Your Glorious 
Leaders for your nutritious needs.

	It contains a self serving portion controlled food and drink 
dispenser, a super safe table and chair, and, the usual tannoy, 
security camera, flat screen TV, and computer terminal.

	The room is decorated with the same Eyerest Green walls and 
ceiling, and earth green, super safety, non toxic carpeting.

	Your portion controlled food has been especially formulated 
by Your Glorious Heros Jerimy Rifkins, John Robbins, Ingrid 
Newkirk and Linda MaCartney, to be free of any forms of rotting 
flesh, animal products, fats, salts, sugar, preservatives, 
additives, pesticides, herbacides, hormones, or anything else 
that Your Glorious Leaders have decided that could be harmful. 
This food is processed into an easily digested paste designed to 
prevent choking, or upsetting your delicate stomach.

	Your drink is carefully purified water that is free of any 
harmful mercury, lead, germs, viruses, or other chemical or 
biological agents. It is carefully dispensed so that you never 
ever run the risk of choking or drowning from your drink.

	The air that you breathe has been carefully filtered to 
remove any dust particles, toxic gases, or other biological 
agents. There is no danger from Radon gas. A special chemical 
agent is added to ensure that you behave in a calm, docile 
behavior so that you never become violent, play with yourself, or 
possibly injure yourself.

	Since robo control keeps your food and drink dispenser 
properly supplied, you never have to worry about going out to 
that dangerous outside to get anything.
