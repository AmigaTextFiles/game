The Super Safe Serviceway

	You are not suppose to be in the Super Safe Serviceway. Get 
back in your room.

	Since you are here, the serviceway is designed for use by 
robo units so that they can service the needs of people in the 
Panic Society.

	Each serviceway serves 12 Super Safe Living Units in the 
housing complex. The wall contains a food and drink serving unit, 
door controls for robocop, and necessary plumbing and controls 
for providing air conditioning, lighting, and sanitation for each 
living unit.

	Now, for your own personal safety and well being, get back 
in your room and wait for robo control to shut the door.
