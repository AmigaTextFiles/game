Information on the Gold room.



	This room has been specially created for African Americans  
by Your Glorious Hero Jessie Jackson.

	It contains all of the wealth gathered from descendent of 
those Evil White European slave leaders and has been equally 
distributed among you. It, along with the expensive car, is here 
for your personal enjoyment.

	Remember, you no longer need to do anything for a living, 
ever. Your glorious leaders have provided you with food, drink, 
clothings, and this super safe house to live in.

	The room is decorated in the usual colors and 
environmentally safe materials. It contains the usual Tannoy, 
security camera, Super Safe tv, and computer terminal. A ACME 
super safe chair is provided so you can sit comfortably and 
safely to enjoy your wealth. Or, you can sit in your dream car 
and enjoy your wealth.

	For your own personal safety and well being, the car, its 
boom box stereo, and other options, have been disabled. The 
dangerous windows and mirrors have also been removed. The door 
locks and handles are also removed. All dangerous lights have 
been replaced with super safe plastic.

	You are closely monitored while in your Super Safe Gold Room 
so that Your Glorious Leaders of the Panic Society can rest 
assured that you are behaving yourself morally.
