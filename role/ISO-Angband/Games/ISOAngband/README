This is quick recompile of ISO Angband for MorphOS,this is an realtime single player RPG
more info in help/ directory and on http://thangorodrim.angband.org.
This game requires SDL library so install it first.

BUGS:
There is one annoying,multipressed keys (ie. SHIFT + > ) are sometimes not processed so please
try again pressing them.I don't know is this is a bug in this release or maybe SDL itself or at least
my peg 1 g3 is too slow ;).
