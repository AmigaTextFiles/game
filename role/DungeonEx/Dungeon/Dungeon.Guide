@node "about" "About the Game"



      The Game was written in Blitz Basic by me, as well as the Editor.
   The graphics for the game and editor were done with D Paint III.
   Sounds were taken from PD sources, as I don't own an audio digitizer.

      The programs were created on an A1000 with 512k chip ram and
   2 meg fast ram and should work on any machine with 1 meg memory
   or more.  Some programs don't release all the memory when they are
   finished, so if the game acts strange (the sounds don't sound right,
   the Load Requestor won't open, etc) try re-booting your machine.
   If that doesn't help, let me know.

      If you only have 512k chip and are having problems, try re-booting
   then drag the game icon out of it's drawer, then close ALL open windows
   including the one you pulled the game from before clicking on the icon
   to start the program.

     They also have been tested and work on:

              A2000/512k chip/2.5M fast/wb 2.04
              A2000/1M chip/8m fast/wb 3.1
              A2500/1M chip/8m fast/wb 3.1
              A1200/2M chip/wb 3.0
              A1400T/2M chip/4M fast/wb 3.1

     If you have any problems, please let me know.  Also tell me what system
   you are using.

     The Game and Editor should run with no problems from your Hard Disk.
   Just drag the entire drawer to any partition. DO NOT put the game icon
   or the editor icon into different drawers.   They share many of the
   same files, and neither will run from a different drawer.

      Fell free to write or call with any suggestions, bug reports, or
   comments.  All letters with stamped return envelope will be answered.
   All Email will be answered if you indicate that you want a reply.

    If you would like the source code (in Blitz Basic) you will find
   it on Aminet in dev/basic.

@node "controls" "Game Controls"

   Your friend is locked up somewhere in a dungeon filled with creatures
   and your job is to find out where.

   On the title screen, use the mouse to select your player.  Just
   click on the picture to select.  The players differ only in their
   special ability (activated with "/") as follows:

       The male player can move faster

       The female player can "freeze" monsters

   Also, the player images and sounds are different.

   When the game loads, use the mouse to select:
        Play - Play the game
        Load - Load a different set of rooms
        Help - Shows brief instructions  (click the button to exit)
        Quit - Frees all memory and returns to workbench

   Controls:
        Joystick          Moves your player in any of 8 directions
        Joystick Button   Swings your sword in a full circle
        ,                 fires blowgun   (if you have it and ammo)
        .                 fires raygun    (if you have it and ammo)
        /                 special ability (if you have enough energy)
        Spacebar          drops a bomb    (if you have any)
        M or m            turns music on/off
        P or p            pause/resume the game
        Esc               ends the game and goes to options requestor
                             select Play to replay the same game
                             select Load to play a different game
        &                 test mode on - unlimited lives but no score

 >> TEST MODE WORKS ONLY IF THE FIRST WORD IN THE AUTHOR'S NAME IS "TEST"  <<


    NOTE: The Weapons are magical.  They DO NOT have to be aimed and they
           will penetrate walls, doors, water and fire!

   Press "/" to activate your special ability if there is a CREATURE in
   the room.  Be careful, doing this uses a lot of energy!  If your
   energy level is too low, you won't be able to use your ability.
   The minimum energy level needed to activate your ability is marked
   on your energy bar.  Your ability will last as long as you remain
   in the room unless you are killed.  You CAN NOT use your ability in
   the final room (the one with the jail cell) or in a room with no
   enemy in it. (You don't need to)

   Abilities:

     Male: Makes you able to move twice as fast as normal.  All other
           characteristics remain the same.

     Female: The creature will be immobilized.  It is still alive, so
             be careful!  It will still bite if you get too close. All
             other characteristics are the same.

@node "inventory" "Your Inventory"
  To pick up an item, just walk on it and it will be used or added to
   your inventory on the right side of the screen. If there isn't enough
   room in the inventory for the item, it will not be picked up.  If you
   don't need an item, it will not be picked up either.  For example, if
   you have the gold key, blue keys and green keys are ignored.
   Items left behind in rooms will still be there if you return, but they
   are not replenished when you leave - if you pick up a bomb, for example,
   and walk out of that room you will not get a new one by walking back in.
   (Yes, life is tough, isn't it!)


   You can carry:
        2 Blue Keys      (or the Gold key)
        2 Green Keys
        6 Bombs
        1 BlowGun
        1 RayGun
        30 shots each for the RayGun and the BlowGun
        1 Snorkel
        1 Extinguisher

   Items:
        Blowgun       fires a dart at the creature
        Darts         for blowgun  (Green ammo box)  5 per box
        Raygun        fires a ray at the creature
        Rays          for raygun   (Purple ammo box) 5 per box
        Energy        restores some energy if you are low
        Potion        one extra life (used automatically)
        Blue Key      unlocks one blue door
        Green Key     unlocks one green door
        Gold Key      unlocks all doors and the jail cell
        Compass       will show all the rooms in the game
        Shield        decreases the damage done by living creatures
        Snorkel       allows you to pass unharmed through water
        Extinguisher  allows you to pass unharmed through fire
        Transporter   takes you to another place

   Your score is shown in yellow at the top right of the screen.
   Just below, your remaining lives are shown in blue.
   Your energy level is shown as a blue bar at the lower left of the
   screen.  The yellow line is your current maximum energy level.
   Watch you energy, for if it gets to 0, you lose your life!  If
   you have any extra lives left, you and the creature will go back
   to your original positions in the room and play will continue.
   If you are on your last life, your energy bar will turn red.
   When you have used up all your lives, the game is over.

@node "editor" "Using the Room Editor"

   -------------- The Editor -------------------------------------------

   Uses the same basic screen as the game with control buttons on the right
   instead of the inventory.

   All rooms will be shown on the map section.

   Press left mouse button to set the block (the one shown in the yellow box)
   Press right button to erase the space the cursor is on
   Click on the option buttons on the right to use the option:
  >Arrows       Select next/previous shape (Current shape is in yellow box)
  >Yellow box   Click to bring up shape page - click on shape to select
  >Load         Loads a room file
  >Save         Saves the room file you are working on
  >Quit         Exits to workbench

   * You don't have to use all the rooms

   * Don't put anything in the title bar area in the first room. (The bottom
     3 rows).  Anything placed here will NOT be seen.

   * You may put more than one creature in a room, but only one will be used
     at a time.  Creatures are used starting from top left.  The first one
     will be used until it is defeated, then the next, and so on.

   * The final room (the one with the jail cell) will use a team of the top
     creatures, no matter what other creatures you put in that room.

   * Only doors or bombproof blocks can be used on the outside wall areas. 
     The editor will not allow anything else to be placed there.

   * The editor does NOT check for logical errors such as placing a block in
     front of a doorway.  Make sure you leave enough room for the player and
     creatures to get through the room!

   * The editor also does NOT check for playability errors!  It is up to you
     to be sure to provide enough keys and bombs for the player to finish
     the game.

   * Transporters and Landing Pads are automatically linked.  To save
     confusion, it is best to place them in sets.  The editor displays
     Transporters and Pads with the link numbers on them.  The Transporter
     (The one with the "T" on it) shows the destination room number and
     the Pad shows the room number where it's Transporter is located.
     If a Transporter or Pad is shown with a "?", it is unlinked and
     will be linked to the next Pad or Transporter that is placed. You
     can have only ONE Transporter and ONE pad per room.  You can have
     a Transporter and its Pad in the same room if you wish.  To move
     a Transporter or Pad in the same room DO NOT ERASE IT first.  Just
     click with the left button in the new location and the old item
     will be erased when the new one is placed.  If you erase the Pad
     or Transporter (or place another item in the same block) its
     coresponding unit will be unlinked.

   * Games may be saved to and played from any directory, but for ease of
     use it is suggested they be stored in the rooms subdirectory when
     you have them ready for play.

   * The program automatically adds  the ".rms" suffix to your saved
     room files.  You may change the room file name if you wish, but
     make sure you leave the ".rms" suffix, or the game and editor
     will refuse to load the file!

   * To enable the test mode in the game, the first word in the Author's
     name must be TEST (capital letters required).  Once the game has
     been tested and completed, remove the 'TEST' word to disable the
     test mode.

   Have fun and if you come up with a good set of rooms, send them to me and
   I will include them in the distribution with your name on them if you 
   wish.

@node "Music" "About the Music"
   
   The default module included with the game, "Med.East" is copyrighted
   by Steven Gane and MAY NOT be distributed separately!

   If you would like to use a different module, you may select it before
   you play, using the excellent Music Selector program, which was
   written by Alvaro Thompson.  The Music Selector program requires at
   least 2.0 workbench or better.  If you are still using 1.3 I have
   included the old version of the selector in the 1.3 drawer.

   The music selector program is very easy to use. Click on play to hear 
   the song, stop to stop, select to pick another song. Click the filter 
   button on or off, whatever sounds best on your system. And press
   save to save your selection.  It will then be played every time you
   start the game.
   
   The game needs to have a 4 channel Med module, but if you aren't sure,
   just try to load the song. If it won't work, the program will let you know
   and it will go back to the last song.  
   
   If you have a song that won't work and you have any version of
   OctaMed you can convert a Soundtracker/Noisetracker song to an OctaMed
   song just by loading and re-saving it.   

   If your song sounds funny when the sound effects are played, you may need
   to re-arrainge  the 4 channels to make sure the basic rythmn and melody
   tracks keep playing even when the sounds are played.  The program masks
   off two of the channels when sounds are being played, but this is pretty 
   much un-noticable as long as the rythmn and melody tracks keep playing.

   If your machine has only 512k chip ram, you won't be able to use a song 
   much longer than the one provided. If you have 1 meg chip ram or more, 
   of course you can substitute a longer song.  If in doubt, try it and see.
   If it doesn't work, you can always go back to the original song.
@endnode

@node "tips" "Playing tips"
   If there is a creature in the room, it's energy level is shown
   in green just to the right of yours.  When it gets to 0, that
   creature is dead, and will not be back if you re-enter the room.
   Be careful, however, as you might find another creature when you
   come back!  Creatures can not go through walls, doors, fire or
   water.  They also can't use transporters.

   When you swing your sword, there is a delay until you can swing it
   again.  The more experience you gain (by defeating creatures), the
   stronger your sword becomes, and the less the time you have to wait.
   Your sword strength is shown as a red bar at the top of the inventory.

   The more shields you collect, the less damage the creatures do to you.
   Shield strength is the purple bar just below the sword strength.
   Shields DO NOT protect you from the storm or the whirlwind.

   Darts and rays are unaffected by your sword strength.

   Certain creatures are resistant to some weapons.  Experiment to find
   which weapons are best for which enemies.

   The bomb will destroy anything except bombproof walls, Teleporter pads,
   fire, and water.   It will destroy any normal wall blocks as well as
   creatures, items, and YOU, so get out of the way when you drop one.

   When you find the locked cell, you must defeat all of the creatures
   before you can unlock the cell to win the game.  (I'm assuming you
   brought the gold key with you!)  Don't forget: Your special ability
   WILL NOT work in this room.  Also, the creatures in this room move
   faster, so be on your toes!

   Good luck and I hope you enjoy the game!
