                  ======================================

                   This program is FREELY distrubatable.


       I accept no responsability for anything that you do with this.
              Basically, if it goes wrong its not my fault :)

What does this program do?

Basically, its an aid for West End Games roleplaying game, Paranoia ©.  If
you havent heard of this, then you wont need this program :) If you have
heard of/played/bought Paranoia then you may find this program useful.

Due to the nature of Paranoia, you will often find yourself having to
create a new character.  Doesnt this get tiring?  If it does then this is
what the program attempts to solve.  You can generate as many clones as
you want, whenever you want, and then save them to disk, or print them out.
All aspects of the generation process have been included (I think) - you
can reroll stats, add and take points away from your skills etc...

You will need an Amiga (obviously) with Workbench 2 and higher to run this
program (sorry 1.3 owners - its just too much hard work on 1.3 machines!)

The program is not exactly large so I havent included an installation
script - just copy it where you want.

@node "Using the program" "AutoClone - Using the program"
Using the program couldnt be more simple.  To generate a character, select
"Generate PC" from the "Character" menu.  Now you will have your first
clone.  You want to change his/her stats?  Easy.  Just select the stat you
want to change (say strength), then press on the BIG re-roll button.  If
your lucky you will get a higher score, if not its just tough isnt it!  You
are allowed 3 re-rolls, as per the rules in the book.

Displayed next to the stats are other stats that depend on your main
attributes.  These can only be affected by your main stats.

When you roll a new character your Group, mutant power, and Secret society
will be chosen for you.  You cannot change these without rolling a new PC -
your stuck with what you get!  Note that some of the secret societies are
taken from Acute Paranoia, an extra rules/adventure supplement also from
West End Games.  If you dont have this and you roll a character with a
society from here then just roll again (but no cheating - the computer is
watching).

Also in the main window you can change whether the clone is a registered
mutant or not, and what security clearance the clone is (should only be
used by the GM, or players under GM supervision).

Finally, theres the clones name - you can enter anything in here.  Even a
non-standard clone name.

Changing the clones skilled is performed by selecting "Skills" from the
"Character" menu.  A new window will open displaying all the skill
categories, and the current values you have in them.  These base values are
dependent on your main attributes so make sure you have finished rerolling
your main stats).  Like before you can change any skill by selecting it,
but this time you press on the relevant "Add" or "Minus" button to increase
or decrease the skill by one point.  The minimum you can decrease skills to
will be the same as your skill base, and the maximum depends on your group.
Most skills will have a maximum of 12, while those that your group
specialises in will allow a maximum of 14.


When you've finished with your clone you can then save them out as a text
file (for you to load into whatever other program you want), or you can
print them out directly (the formatting is nothing special, but its
useable).

Hope you find this useful.

If you like this program and just *happen* to have a spare few SIMMS lying
around then dont hesitate to send them to me....  :)


Thanks go to:

  Micheal A.F Wiedmer for helping me with certain programming problems

  Jan Van Den Baard for his excellent GadToolsBox which certainly made
                    writing this program *much* easier!

  Stuart Gibbs for spotting a rather obvious bug that I somehow missed :}


Have fun.

If you are the GM and intend to let your players use this program to
generate their clones then I would suggest keeping a close eye on what they
do - it would be very easy for someone to keep rolling characters until
they found one they liked.  And we wouldnt want that now, would we?  :)
