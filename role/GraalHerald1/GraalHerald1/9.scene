TYPE 4,16,4,10,SHADOW2,About Those Pesky Colours

TYPE 2,30,4,30,NONE,Getting the colour palettes to work the way you
TYPE 2,30,4,40,NONE,want is not always easy. The main trick is to
TYPE 2,30,4,50,NONE,1) avoid using colour 0 in scene backdrops, but
TYPE 2,30,4,60,NONE,2) use it in the background of clipart pictures, 
TYPE 2,30,4,70,NONE,3) keep certain colours in the palette the same in
TYPE 2,30,4,80,NONE,   all scenes to make the colour for the characters, 
TYPE 2,30,4,90,NONE,   and perhaps the cursor colours, the same
TYPE 2,30,4,100,NONE,   throughout the game.
TYPE 2,30,4,115,NONE,The following screens from DPAINT IV shows what to
TYPE 2,30,4,125,NONE,watch out for, and a quick way of doing away with
TYPE 2,30,4,135,NONE,unwanted areas of colour 0 in the scene backdrops.

TYPE 4,24,4,10,SHADOW2,Making a Scene Backdrop Palette

TYPE 2,20,4,30,NONE,For basic palette manipulations, I use ImageFX.
TYPE 2,20,4,40,NONE,First, I render a 24-bit original in 32 colours, 
TYPE 2,20,4,50,NONE,which gives me the 32 most significant colours of
TYPE 2,20,4,60,NONE,the picture. Next, I manually replace some of those
TYPE 2,20,4,70,NONE,with my "standard colours", and then LOCK THE
TYPE 2,20,4,80,NONE,RENDERING PALETTE before rendering the 24-bit
TYPE 2,20,4,90,NONE,original a second time. This often gives quite
TYPE 2,20,4,100,NONE,good results, as you can see from the "Olaf"
TYPE 2,20,4,110,NONE,slideshow elsewhere in this magazine.
TYPE 2,20,4,125,NONE,Hope this was of some use. As they say - still
TYPE 2,20,4,135,NONE,confused, but on a higher level, eh? :)
