TYPE 4,26,4,10,SHADOW2,What About Olaf?

TYPE 2,20,4,30,NONE,Glad you asked! Despite all the work put into
TYPE 2,20,4,40,NONE,GRAAL 2, the work on my own mammoth adventure has
TYPE 2,20,4,50,NONE,not stopped entirely. To prove that there is a
TYPE 2,20,4,60,NONE,lot more "Olaf Longhair Goes East" coming (sooner
TYPE 2,20,4,70,NONE,or later), here's a very short slide show showing
TYPE 2,20,4,80,NONE,what he is up to these days.
TYPE 2,20,4,95,NONE,I'm still not entirely sure how the finished thing
TYPE 2,20,4,105,NONE,will be released, but licenceware is a definite
TYPE 2,20,4,115,NONE,possibility. There will most definitely be another
TYPE 2,20,4,125,NONE,demo on the 'net, but that one will be encrypted.
TYPE 2,20,4,140,NONE,Now right-click to see some stunning new locations!
