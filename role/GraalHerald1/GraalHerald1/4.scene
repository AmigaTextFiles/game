TYPE 4,1,4,10,SHADOW2,Latest News

TYPE 2,12,4,30,NONE,Well, the news seem to change faster than I am
TYPE 2,12,4,40,NONE,able to keep this text updated. First, I was only
TYPE 2,12,4,50,NONE,going to let you have an updated GRAAL_2 beta 2
TYPE 2,12,4,60,NONE,driver with this release of the Herald. However, I
TYPE 2,12,4,70,NONE,just put some truly useful new features into the
TYPE 2,12,4,80,NONE,editor, so I'll be nice - you get a beta 2 editor
TYPE 2,12,4,90,NONE,as well! Read the "editor.txt" file for more info.
TYPE 2,12,4,105,NONE,E-mail me if you find anything strange, and please
TYPE 2,12,4,115,NONE,include generous portions of the failing GRAAL
TYPE 2,12,4,125,NONE,scripts. I probably need the whole graal.main and
TYPE 2,12,4,135,NONE,currently active .section and .room scripts, too.

TYPE 4,1,4,10,SHADOW2,The Friendly Editor

TYPE 2,12,4,30,NONE,If you're anything like me, you have a heck of a
TYPE 2,12,4,40,NONE,time keeping track of all room and scene script
TYPE 2,12,4,50,NONE,numbers. Well, starting with the beta 2 editor, 
TYPE 2,12,4,60,NONE,you don't have to anymore! If you put a description
TYPE 2,12,4,70,NONE,in the first line of each script, these comments
TYPE 2,12,4,80,NONE,are shown in the new "load script" requesters!
TYPE 2,12,4,95,NONE,Also, when creating a new script the editor finds
TYPE 2,12,4,105,NONE,a suitable, unused number and recommends it to you.
TYPE 2,12,4,115,NONE,It all works equally well with WB 2 and WB 3, unlike
TYPE 2,12,4,125,NONE,the previously used file requester filters.
TYPE 2,12,4,140,NONE,Oh yes, and the "graal.main" file is now loaded
TYPE 2,12,4,150,NONE,without asking for its name a second time...
TYPE 2,12,4,160,NONE,Quite natural when you think about it, really!

TYPE 4,1,4,10,SHADOW2,Some Bug Fix Effects...

TYPE 2,12,4,30,NONE,SHOW and HIDE for some objects didn't work too well
TYPE 2,12,4,40,NONE,before - sometimes objects disappeared from rooms
TYPE 2,12,4,50,NONE,on re-visit, even if they should have been there!
TYPE 2,12,4,65,NONE,So, if you find objects appearing that you didn't
TYPE 2,12,4,75,NONE,see before, it's because now they behave more
TYPE 2,12,4,85,NONE,consistently - you have just forgot to HIDE them
TYPE 2,12,4,95,NONE,properly, and the old GRAAL kindly did it for you, 
TYPE 2,12,4,105,NONE,although it shouldn't have!

TYPE 4,1,4,10,SHADOW2,The Great Bug Safari

TYPE 2,12,4,30,NONE,Check out the file "GRAAL_2_bugs.txt" to read about
TYPE 2,12,4,40,NONE,the current status of the bug hunt, and exactly what
TYPE 2,12,4,50,NONE,has been done in the GRAAL_2 beta 2 driver, which
TYPE 2,12,4,60,NONE,you are currently running. It also contains bug and
TYPE 2,12,4,70,NONE,change info for the Editor.

TYPE 4,1,4,10,SHADOW2,Editor+Amigaguide=True

TYPE 2,12,4,30,NONE,If the Editor goes into an endless loop on startup, 
TYPE 2,12,4,40,NONE,sitting there eating eight bytes at a time of your
TYPE 2,12,4,50,NONE,memory but doing precious little else, it's because
TYPE 2,12,4,60,NONE,it feels lonely. No, really. It now must have
TYPE 2,12,4,70,NONE,amigaguide.library in your LIBS: drawer to feel
TYPE 2,12,4,80,NONE,happy.
TYPE 2,12,4,95,NONE,Fortunately, amigaguide is available off aminet
TYPE 2,12,4,105,NONE,(text/hyper/aguide34.lha), so that shouldn't
TYPE 2,12,4,115,NONE,be too much of a problem.

TYPE 4,1,4,10,SHADOW2,THE FUTURE

TYPE 2,12,4,30,NONE,Well, the bug hunt goes on... Because I also have
TYPE 2,12,4,40,NONE,to work (and quite a lot) for my living, I probably
TYPE 2,12,4,50,NONE,won't release GRAAL 2.0 before the beginning of next
TYPE 2,12,4,60,NONE,year. By then, both driver and editor should be
TYPE 2,12,4,70,NONE,fairly stable, and I also strive to make the command
TYPE 2,12,4,80,NONE,syntax in the reference match the one used in the
TYPE 2,12,4,90,NONE,editor. Sort of a nice gesture when the help is
TYPE 2,12,4,100,NONE,synchronized and all... :)
TYPE 2,12,4,115,NONE,So, hope the GRAAL_2 beta 2 driver ties you over
TYPE 2,12,4,125,NONE,until the complete 2.0 update comes along. Merry
TYPE 2,12,4,135,NONE,Christmas and so forth to you all!
TYPE 2,12,4,150,NONE,Best of luck with your GRAAL adventuring, 
TYPE 2,1,4,165,NONE,Per
