Here's a list showing the current state of the "Autumn of '96 Bug Safari".


The bugs noted as "fixed" here are fixed in the beta 2 versions.


GRAAL_2 BETA BUGS
=================

"**" means the bug has been fixed...


Driver
------

**Crash when REMOVEing last inventory object.

**Monitor can't handle room 0 flags.

**Mouse hit on object belonging to previous room, if the same BOB number
  is used for a STATIC: or ANIM: object, and there were no objects in the
  next room...

**Loading and resume does not remember CHAR ON / CHAR OFF properly.

* It seems to me some global objects are not where I last SHOWed or
  OMOVEd them when I later return to the room where they are. Easy to get
  around by setting them up again upon re-entry to the room. This is also
  good coding practice, because the placement is then visible in the
  .room script DACT: statements at a glance.

  Note: The problem does not exist for room objects, because changes to
  them must always be re-done with DACT: statements anyway.


Editor
------

**Editing OMOVE with an anim cut the anim at the , after A 0, ...
  (All commands with an animation string as last parameter had this problem.)

**Re-sized the inital area frame when editing new ...BOBS: statements.
  (Previously, it was initially very small and off the screen.)

**BOBON without all parameters set, and on its own line in a cutscene, 
  doesn't get all parameters when exiting the parameter window.

* If you don't reload graphics data when editing a floor area, the
  room objects don't show up on the backdrop.

**Invalid CLPART or BG_IFF: file name crashed the editor.

* ink etc. in TIME_LAYOUT: with ANALOGUE doesn't work too well...

**Trying to position a large image (PBOB, BOBON) often crashed the editor.

**A statement with optional last parameter(s) gave a syntax check error
  if the last (optional) parameter was missing (e.g. PATH: with only start
  and end coordinates).

**Colours 32-63 were not in the "palette" when editing colour numbers for
  EHB pictures.

**Lines 4 and 5 in scripts created with the "New" command behaved oddly
  until you had messed around with the file contents for a while. All
  sorted out now!



ENHANCEMENTS & CHANGES
======================

Driver
------

* MAX_DLG: statement in graal.main now sets the number of dialogues.
  DLG: statements just define speaking partners for RESP commands.
  Speaking partners can now also be room and section objects.
  (Default is 30 dialogues.)

* Moving the mouse cursor over the inventory makes the object name
  show up in the sentence box.

* New IFNOTSAVEDISK, IFEXISTS, SAVE, LOAD makes it possible to code
  save/load rooms in any style you like.

* New DISABLE_SAVE: statement to go with the above, forcing the player to
  use your new save/load screen.

* New "$" prefix in dialogue lines disables the automatic SAYing of the
  line when it is selected. Makes the dialogue use less character-dependent.

* PBOB and TYPE now works equally well on title screens and in the
  scene area. LOAD/RESUME now remembers PBOB and TYPE commands that have
  altered the appearance of the room.

* TYPE can now handle text variables and special formatting like
  the TEXT and SAY comands.

* New statement parameter: Use "SECTION: SAME" for "subroutine rooms"
  like load/save rooms. Prevents rooms belonging to "all" sections from
  messing with the section data...

* Playing from write-protected disk makes GRAAL automatically ask for
  diskette for saved games - mainly for use with CD-ROM distribution.

* TYPE, PBOB, CLPART and BOBS commands are now "remembered" in
  save/load/resume operations. Note: You still may have to use
  ACTION: -2 statements occasionally, because all GRAAL remembers
  are the commands that took place in the room that was MARKed/saved, 
  not anything that may have happened in previous rooms... But, in
  most cases, you shouldn't need ACTION: -2; statements.


Editor
------

Major user-friendliness overhaul:

* The Editor now handles editing of PATH: lines.

* Asking to load a specific script type now brings up a list requester
  showing all the existing scripts of that type, including short
  descriptions of each file (both WB 2 and WB 3). (The short descriptions
  are in fact the beginning of the first line, which should be a comment
  line!)

* Asking to create a new script of a specific type now automatically
  suggests a suitable, unused script number and lets you enter a
  description (which is inserted in the first script line).

* Using "Edit parameters" on an empty line now brings up a list requester
  showing all the available statements and lets you insert one.

* Using "Edit parameters" with the cursor on anything but a statement
  or command name in a statement line brings up a list requester showing
  all the available commands and conditions, and lets you insert one.
