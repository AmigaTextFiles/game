TYPE 4,1,4,10,SHADOW2,What's All This, Then?

TYPE 2,26,4,40,NONE,Well, no matter how much you try to explain in the
TYPE 2,26,4,50,NONE,documentation, more things always pop up that really
TYPE 2,26,4,60,NONE,doesn't fit in anywhere. I hope this format is a
TYPE 2,26,4,70,NONE,good way to give some additional GRAAL support.
TYPE 2,26,4,85,NONE,The design is very much an experiment, and this
TYPE 2,26,4,95,NONE,time around I haven't put a single extra "diskmag"
TYPE 2,26,4,105,NONE,feature in GRAAL to help out. (More text functions
TYPE 2,26,4,115,NONE,would have been nice!)
TYPE 2,26,4,130,NONE,As always, the best way to learn new stuff is to
TYPE 2,26,4,140,NONE,look at working examples, so these scripts are
TYPE 2,26,4,150,NONE,unencrypted and commented to help you out. Enjoy!
