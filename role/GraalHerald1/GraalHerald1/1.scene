SAY Hi there! My name is Olaf Longhair, and not very long ago, I was in a graphic adventure demo...

SAY Gosh, I feel a little insecure here... Not my usual surroundings...

SAY You can't even see the floor, although it is there! Spooky!
SAY Say, how about a little something to make me feel more at home?

SAY Oh, great.
SAY Was that the best you could do?

SAY Anyway, welcome to this rather unusual disk mag.
SAY See, the author of GRAAL thought it would be just as well to do it all in GRAAL, which really is an adventure thingy, and not meant to be used for this.
SAY There are a number of reasons for this unusual approach, or so he claims...
SAY a) He's a show-off...
SAY b) He would like to demonstrate some GRAAL techniques in real life...
SAY c) He gets some extra testing of extreme things done...
SAY and d), he's out of his mind.

SAY You will be pleased to know that the normal GRAAL methods of speeding things up are in operation:
SAY If you want to skip this intro next time, just press the "Escape" key.
SAY If you want to adjust the display speed, use the "D" and "I" keys.
SAY You will have to wait until I hand command over to you, though.
SAY If you want to end a pause, click the right mouse button or press the "." key.
W 50
SAY Shortly, I will go away and be replaced with the headlines.
SAY But before that, you may want to know something about how this works.
SAY Now, normally, GRAAL programs combine verbs with objects to get things done.
SAY However, in this program, there are only a few verbs in the command area, and they just help you navigate in the "newspaper".
SAY The headlines that will appear, and most other things, must be clicked with the RIGHT mouse button in order to activate their default commands.
SAY Therefore, don't use the WRONG mouse button. Which is the LEFT one. Contrary to normal circumstances, RIGHT is almost always RIGHT here.
SAY Now for a quick comprehension test:
SAY As soon as you move the mouse pointer over an object on screen and a command name is shown at the bottom of the screen...
SAY ...you should click WHICH mouse button?
