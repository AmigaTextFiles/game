TEXT -1,100,1,This is an example of how to set up your own load and save screens. Look at graal.main and 7.room to see how it's done.
TEXT -1,100,1,Note: This function uses some commands only available from "GRAAL 2 beta 2" and onwards.
TEXT -1,100,1,It works much the same as the standard requester, minus the saved game description.
TEXT -1,100,1,If you decide to code your own quit, save and load functions, the only "old" requesters the player will ever see are the "insert disk" requesters.
TEXT -1,100,1,Remember that there must *always* be a MARK command immediately before the GOTO leading to the special load/save room. (See ACTION: 6... in graal.main .)
TEXT -1,100,1,Study the commands involved (SAVE, LOAD, IFEXISTS) and try to figure out completely new solutions to do a screen like this!
TEXT -1,100,1,Just remember to  use IFNOTSAVEDISK and IFEXISTS like this example, to ensure that the SAVE and LOAD commands have access to the proper save disk!
TEXT -1,100,1,Now try saving and loading a\little - Cool or what? :)\ \
