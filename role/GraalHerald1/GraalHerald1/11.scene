SAY I hope you understand nobody in their right mind would lay out the floors and the path the way it's done here!
SAY It is purely educational.
SAY Like this message, which you would not be seeing if I hadn't been on floor 3 right now.
SAY By the way, this message may have stopped me a little short of the point I was going to.
SAY The last "leg" of character movement allows for player input, and in this case the "ACTION:" statements triggered by the timer were executed as soon as I entered floor 3.
SAY Because they contained "SAY" commands, I naturally had to stop right away to tell you all of this!
