TITLE Crumpled.iff,11

TYPE 4,22,4,10,SHADOW2,Q
TYPE 2,18,4,30,NONE,When I try to use the buttons in the "parameter
TYPE 2,18,4,40,NONE,editor", strange and unpleasant things happen.
TYPE 4,20,4,60,SHADOW2,A
TYPE 2,18,4,80,NONE,Check that CLPART:, ...BOBS: and BG_IFF: statements
TYPE 2,18,4,90,NONE,in the scripts involved are correct, that objects
TYPE 2,18,4,100,NONE,point to rooms that exist, and that all scripts are
TYPE 2,18,4,110,NONE,saved to disk. (Run the syntax checker!) If problems
TYPE 2,18,4,120,NONE,persist, give me an error report (see elsewhere in
TYPE 2,18,4,130,NONE,the Herald). I have also picked some bugs out of the
TYPE 2,18,4,140,NONE,editor, and the proper 2.0 version will often give
TYPE 2,18,4,150,NONE,better error reports in this respect.
