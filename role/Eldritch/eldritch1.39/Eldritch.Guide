@NODE Technical "Eldritch Technical Information"

Eldritch Technical Information:

   Eldritch uses a pair of Templates in which to store creature types, which
can be found in the Templates directory under Eldritch.  These files, with
the .Asc extension, are ASCII text files modifiable by any raw ASCII text
editor.

   @{"Creatures.Asc" LINK Creatures_Asc} describes the Creatures available in Eldritch dungeons.
      If new creatures are added to this then the TempGen program must be
run from the Eldritch directory and the name Creatures supplied.  This will
compile the definitions into the .Tmp file that Eldritch requires.  Changing
the creatures statistics and then running an old saved game will not cause
any change in stats until new creatures are encountered.  Any creatures
added to this file will also begin to appear in saved games and in
predefined as well as random dungeons.

   @{"Items.Asc" LINK Items_Asc} describes all Items available to characters within the game.
      Once again, TempGen must be run from the Eldritch directory and the
filename Items supplied, to convert it into usable .Tmp format.

   @{"<cityname>.Asc" LINK City_Asc} files are found in the Cities directory and may be
compiled into .Cty files, usable by Eldritch, by running the Dungeon program
found in Eldritch's Bin directory from the CLI, supplying the .Asc file's
full pathname as the only argument.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Items_Asc "Creating Custom Items"

There is currently no documentation on creating custom Items, since there
are a large number of options available for Items.
A reasonable idea of how they work can be gleaned from reading the Items.Asc
file in the Templates directory.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Creatures_Asc "Creating Custom Creatures"

Below is an example custom creature, with notes to explain the meanings of
the various fields available.

creature "Thug"
   speed=3
   aggression=192
   graphic=24
   inventory 2="MedPack"
   inventory 1="Sword"
   strength=20
   stamina=15
   max_vitality=30
   vitality=30
   skill weapon=25
   skill ballistic=5
   bravery=48
   mode=0
   experience=0
   alignment=30
end

>creature "Thug"

   The creature command signals the start of a new creature definition.  The
only parameter is its name, which need not be unique.  This has changed
since version 1.37, in which a unique ID also needed to be supplied.  This
is now done automatically, but means that changing the order of creatures in
the .Asc file may cause odd results in specially designed cities.


>   speed=3

   Speed sets the how fast the creature moves, relative to the player
character.  The player character starts the game with a speed rating of 5.


>   aggression=192

   Aggression sets the shortest distance that there can be, in pixels,
between the creature and it's target before it will attack the target.  The
larger this value, the more aggressive the creature appears to be.


>   graphic=24

   Graphic sets the number of the graphics to use from the Basic.Abk bank in
the Graphics directory, for the creature.  This value should always be a
multiple of four.  The first frame within the Basic.Abk bank is treated as
frame 0.  The Basic.Abk bank may be editted using the standard AMOS or AMOS
Pro Bob/Sprite/Object Editors.


>   inventory 2="MedPack"
>   inventory 1="Sword"
 
   This specifies that when encountered the creature carries a MedPack in
the second Item of it's inventory and a sword in it's first.  Six inventory
locations are available, numbered 1 to 6.  Location 1 is the only weapon
location and any ammunition for ballistic weapons should be placed in
location 2.  Only one item is allowed per location.


--- Statistics
   All player statistics start out at 20:

>   strength=20

   Strength determines how much damage is done in hand to hand, in addition
to that dealt by the weapon being used.  The strength of a hit varies
between Weapon_Strength+Creature_Strength and double this value, dependent
upon Weapon Skill.


>   stamina=15

   Stamina determines how many points of damage are absorbed from each
attack, rather than causing Wounds.  Effectively a measure of the
Character's toughness.


>   max_vitality=30
>   vitality=30

   The creature's maximum and current vitality.  A successful combat hit
will reduce the current vitality until it reaches zero and the creature
dies.  Having vitality>max_vitality may work but is silly.  Having it the
other way round is not very useful.  But hey, what the heck?


>   skill weapon=25
>   skill ballistic=5

   The creature's weapon skill determines how good they are at close combat.
The a random amount up to the weapon skill of the attacker is added to the
total strength of the weapon to generate the strength of the hit.
   The creature's ballistic skill works in the same way, but with projectile
weapons.  In addition, it affects the accuracy of range of grenade weapons.


>   bravery=48

   Bravery is a value in pixels showing how close an inquisitive creature
will get to it's target before trying to get further away.


>   mode=0

   Mode is the creature's initial starting movement mode, from those listed
below:

      0 = Do nothing
         The character will stay stock still until it's target comes within
a number of pixels equal to it's Aggression value.

      1 = Follow target
         Character will follow it's target, staying at least a distance, in
pixels, equal to it's Bravery from the target.

      2 = Attack target
         The Character will chase the target and attack it whenever
possible.

      3 = Flee target
         The Character will attempt to run away from the target Character,
moving in directly the opposite direction to the target.

      4 = Panic
         The Character will move and fire randomly, regardless of it's
target Character.

      5 = Get a weapon (RESERVED! - This Mode MUST NOT be used!)

Note that a Character's Mode will change during the course of the game,
dependent upon whether or not the Character is hit, injured, badly injured
etc.


>   experience=0

   Experience determines the number of experience points that the player
must have expended before this creature will ever appear as a random
monster.  Ludicrously high values mean creatures will never appear, while
values of <200 usually mean they appear in rooms from the start.


>   alignment=30

   Alignment gives an indication of how good or evil a creature is.  0=Evil,
100=Good.  The player character starts with alignment 50 but this value may
be modified according to the alignments of the creatures he/she kills.


>end

   All creature definitions must be ended with an "end" statement.

@NODE Background "Eldritch Background"

   Eldritch is a dungeon-adventure game in a similar style to one I saw on
Aminet called Knights.  I liked the look of Knights a lot and played it for
a number of days until the lack of difficulty and variety began to become
boring.  It is, nonetheless, a severely funky game and I hope the author
will make something more substantial out of it.
   I wanted to write a similar system but to make it more versatile and also
I wanted to make it dark, brooding and futuristic.  Thus the concept for
Eldritch was born.
   Since I first released it on Aminet, I've added a load of extra features and
fixes that people requested.  In addition to this, the City Editor is almost
completed and I hope to soon to put it on Aminet, along with a Creature and
Item editor, if I get that done in time.
   This beta version is solely for the purposes of play testing and
obtaining new ideas for the game!  The graphics are entirely my own work and
hence are pretty poor.
   The music for the game was created by a guy named Roger Angus and me.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Starting "Getting Started in Eldritch"

Playing the game:

   After first ensuring all @{"required files" LINK Files} are present:

   Insert game disk in any floppy drive (For systems pre-OS3.0 use internal
drive).  Game should boot up into the Intro sequence and then run the game
automatically.
   From hard drive, double click on Intro or Eldritch icon to run.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Main_Menu "Using the Main Menu"

Main Menu

   There are seven options on the main menu:

   @{"1.  New Character. " LINK New_Char}

   @{"2.  Load Character." LINK Load_Char}

   @{"3.  Random Dungeon." LINK Rnd_Dungeon}

   @{"4.  Controls       " LINK Controls}

   @{"5.  Save Options   " LINK SaveOptions}

   @{"6.  Reload Options " LINK LoadOptions}

   @{"7.  Quit Game.     " LINK QuitGame}

@ENDNODE

@NODE LoadOptions "Load Default Options:"

   The Reload Options button may be used from the main menu to re-load the
default Eldritch options file Eldritch.Opt from disk.  This is required
because each character may now have their own set of default options, which
are not normally reset when they stop playing, so it may be necessary to
reload the defaults after someone else has been playing.

@ENDNODE

@NODE SaveOptions "Save Default Options:"

   The Save Options button may be used from the main menu to save the
current game configuration into the Eldritch directory.
   Status values are saved for the following:

         * Fast/Smooth Windows.

         * Moodily/Fully Lit Rooms.

         * Frame Speed (1-3).

         * Control Method (Joypad,Mouse,Keypad).

   The file Eldritch.Opt must be writable for the options to be correctly
saved.

@ENDNODE

@NODE New_Char "Creating a new Character:"

New Character

      NEW: This option now brings up a requester with which the user can
select a pre-designed City file to start the character on.  
      This is intended mainly for playing scenarios designed specially,
rather than random computer-generated ones.  If the Dungeon generator
creates a particularly good Dungeon then this can be copied from the file
"T:Dungeon.Cty" to the "Cities:" directory and will then appear on the
cities menu each time a new player is started.
      Eldritch will request the difficulty level required and then the name
of the character, before switching to the Advancement window to allow 200
free experience points to be spent.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Load_Char "Loading a saved Character"

Load Character.

      Load a saved character from disk.  On Hard Drive systems create a
directory called "Characters" in the Eldritch game directory (The directory
from which the main executable is run), and Eldritch will save Characters in
this directory.  If the Characters directory is not
found then Eldritch will try to save to a disk called "Characters", so have
such a disk handy if you want to be able to save characters on Floppy based
systems.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Quit_Game "Quitting Eldritch"

Quit Game

   The lads here at S.C.R. are particularly proud of our Quit Game routine,
which patches your Amiga in to AmiSat, a Satellite in Geostationary orbit
above Swansea, and alerts our crack squad of expertly trained commando
geese to launch a dawn raid on your house/flat/cardboard-box.

   And it also quits the game, which was the really hard part to code.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Rnd_Dungeon "Play a Random Dungeon"

Random Dungeon

      Creates a random dungeon in the T: directory.  If a Dungeon is already
available in the T: directory then a requester will appear, asking whether
to use the existing Dungeon or create a new one.  Be warned that creating
new Dungeons on the standard A1200 can take a few minutes.
      Once the Dungeon is created and loaded, Eldritch will request the
required difficulty level for the game, before asking the new Character's
name and switching to the Advancement window.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Controls "Controls during the game"

Controls:

   As of version 1.27, Eldritch features three seperate control methods.
   The primary, default, method is the joystick or joypad, preferably with
two buttons.  Different control methods may, however, be chosen from the
Main Menu.
   The available control methods are:

   @{u}Joystick@{uu}
      Pull in any direction to move in that direction.
      Press first fire button to use the item in the Weapon location.
      Press second fire button to bring up the @{"Game Menu" LINK
Game_Menu}.

   @{u}Mouse@{uu}
      Move mouse in any direction away from player character.  Player
character will move towards the mouse pointer, if possible.
      Pressing left mouse button uses the item in the Weapon location.
      Pressing the right mouse button brings up the @{"Game Menu" LINK Game_Menu}.

   @{u}Keyboard@{uu}
      Up:      Q
      Down:    A
      Left:    [
      Right:   ]
      Pressing Spacebar uses item in Weapon location.
      Pressing the Return key brings up the @{"Game Menu" LINK Game_Menu}.

   NB: Keys used to bring up the Game Menu are interchangeable between
control methods - the Return key will bring up the Game Menu even in
Joystick or Mouse mode.

   In any control method, pressing keys F1 to F5 will use the item in the
corresponding one of the remaining locations (The Weapon location is NOT
duplicated in these keys)

   Any item may be placed in any location and used, with the exception that
ONLY equipment items can be used in any slot other than the weapon slot.
   Also, ammunition for guns should be placed in the Equipment location in
the inventory, so that it will automatically be loaded into your
gun when it runs out of shots.
   Keycards and Creditcards may be placed in any of the six main inventory
slots to be recognised.

   Any ideas about improving the control system are welcomed.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Game_Menu "The in-game Menu"

Game Menu

   Version 1.38 sees a new in-game menu system.
   In addition to the inventory tiles displayed down the left of the screen,
a set of extra buttons are added, depending upon which inventory tile was
selected.
   The topmost tile cancels the inventory menu and returns to the game.  On
its submenu are three buttons supplying the functions of the old Game Menu:

Game Menu

   The available options are:

   @{"1.  Disk Menu.                         " LINK Disk_Menu}

   @{"2.  Options Menu.                      " LINK Options}

   @{"3.  Character Information/Advancement. " LINK Characters}

   The next six tiles represent the inventory locations of the player.
Clicking on one of these will cause its contents to be selected and removed
from that location.  Clicking on another location will cause the contents to
be put in the new location, possibly being swapped with any existing items
in that location.  In addition to these, extra sub-menus will pop up next to
item tiles, allowing access to the Information screen for an object, or for
it to be used.  In the case of backpacks, an extra set of tiles is available
in which to store more items.

   Following the six user inventory tiles is a single tile showing the
contents of the floor space.  This behaves similarly to the user inventory.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Options "Eldritch options menu"

Options:

      This menu allows the screen update rate to be set, as well as
displaying the current average frame rate and free memory.  If the game
appears sluggish when a number of creatures are on screen at once, try
moving the frame rate from 1 (Smooth) to 3 (Faster).  The default is 2
and faster machines can probably cope fine with setting 1.
      Another option is Slow or Fast windows.  Slow windows means that the
display is faded neatly between rooms but this takes significantly longer
than Fast mode and can detract from gameplay.
      NEW in version 1.31 is the Moody/None lighting options.  By default,
Eldritch uses lighting defined in the City description, which is supposed to
give rooms a moodily lit feel.  This can be changed to give blanket total
lighting for rooms by clicking this gadget.
      NEW in version 1.32 is the Controls button, which gives access to the
@{"Controls Menu" LINK Controls}, allowing the control method to be changed
during a game.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Disk_Menu "Load/Save/Quit menu"

   Available from the Game Menu, this menu allows the following options:

   1.  Load a saved game.
      Operates in the same way as the Main Menu option.  You will be
prompted for the name of the character to load.

   2.  Save the game.
      Saves the game to the "Characters" disk (or directory, if available),
under the name of the Player character.

   3.  Quit Game.
      Nuff said.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Characters "Eldritch Characters:"

Character Information:

   This screen displays the various character statistics

Character Advancement:

   This screen appears instead of the Character Info screen once over 100
experience points have been accumulated.  Each characteristic is advanced by
a random amount by pressing its button.  Each advance costs 100 experience
points and advances become less and less significant as each statistic gets
higher.

   The advancement system is open to criticism, especially if anyone can
find a better way of achieving the same result.

---  Testing your own Creatures/Items

   If you have any good ideas for Creatures or Items, then look in the
Creatures.Asc and Items.Asc files in the Templates directory to get an idea
of the forms their definitions take.
   [Note that Creature experience is the experience level the Player must
have reached before these Creatures start to appear in Dungeons.]
   To try out your own creatures or items in the game, run TempGen from the
Eldritch directory and type "Items" or "Creatures" as appropriate when
prompted.  Bear in mind that it will be helpful to edit the graphics files
if you want to make it obvious where your Creature or Item is being used.

   For Creatures, edit the "Corpse.Abk" and "Basic.Abk" files in the
Graphics directory.  Remember to set the "graphic" parameter in your
Character definition to reflect the new graphics.

   For Items, edit the "Items.Abk" file and alter the "graphic" parameter in
the Items.Asc definition to reflect the change.

   Remember to use TempGen EVERY TIME the Items or Creatures definitions are
altered, or the changes won't be recognised by the game.
   If you design a good Creature or Item and want to send me its definition
then these can be sent as a standard Email, without encoding.  The graphics,
however, are a different matter.  They must be UUencoded to send them by
Email.

   Send any good stuff to the addresses given above.
   Any ideas for new equipment types and other stuff like that would also be
appreciated.  Just describe their function in a mail.

@ENDNODE

@NODE HardDrive "Hard Drive Installation:"

   To run Eldritch from Hard drive, simply copy all the files on the Game
disk into their own directory on the hard drive.  Simply click on the
Eldritch icon to run Eldritch, or on Intro to run the Intro first.
   Ensure that the contents of the Fonts, Libs and C directories in the
system partition contain the files specified for the game disk.

   Hard Drive installation is automated since Eldritch version 1.27, by
clicking on the "Install_to_HD" icon on the Eldritch Game disk.

   (Whether installing manually or using the script provided, a directory
called Characters must be created in the Eldritch game directory if Eldritch
Characters are to be saved to Hard Drive.)

**** IMPORTANT!
   The Install_to_HD script may fail to install the required libraries
(amos.library and medplayer.library) from the distribution disk.  Until I
can fix this bug, they must be copied by hand into the libs: folder.
****

   NB : Automated Installation is ONLY available on AmigaDOS systems 2.0+,
since it requires the presence of the CBM Installer program in the C:
directory.
        Under OS 1.x systems the files must be manually installed.
        Even under AmigaDOS 2.0x, the Installer program must still be
obtained from Amiga Technologies, since it is only a standard part of the
2.1+ OS.

@ENDNODE

@NODE FloppyDrive "Floppy Drive Installation:"

   To run Eldritch from Floppy drive requires several system files to be
copied to the main Eldritch Game disk.  These files are in square brackets
in the @{"required files" LINK Files} page of this .Guide file.
   Under OS 1.x they must be manually copied to the Eldritch distribution
disk in order that it becomes the Game disk.
   Under OS 2.0+ the Install_to_Floppy Installer script can be run, which
will install all the required system files onto the distribution disk
automatically.

   Under any Amiga OS, the destination Floppy must be made bootable with the
command "Install DF0:" from the CLI prompt, if it is required to self-boot.

   I suggest that you back up your distribution disk before running
Install_to_Floppy on it.

@ENDNODE

@NODE About "About Eldritch"

Eldritch Info

   Eldritch was written in AMOS Basic Pro V2.00

   The music is in MED format.

   Screens were designed using Dpaint V.

   Sampled Effects were mostly ripped from Barbarian.  I think that
Barbarian is an old enough game that no-one should mind me doing this, but
if they do then please just mail me to let me know and I'll find some other
samples.

   I was not sure whether or not some old CBM libs and fonts were under
copyright and so I have not included them in @{"this distribution" LINK Files}.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Files "Required files:"

   Files enclosed in square brackets are required by Eldritch, but are not
included because of possible copyright problems.  Please copy these files
from your original system disks into the locations indicated for them below,
on the Game disk.
   Files enclosed in curly brackets are used by Eldritch but are not
actually mandatory and may be removed if necessary.
   Hard drive users PROBABLY don't need to copy these files, assuming that
their system partitions contain all the standard AmigaDOS files.

   Please read the relevant Installation page for your system.

@NODE New_Features "Future Features:"

Features yet to be implemented:

  * Midi option for enhanced quality audio.  If you have a Midi system
connected to your Amiga, then you'll be able to get even better sound!

  * More Creatures, Items and graphics.

  * Specially designed Cities.

  * Credit cards, shops and spells/psionics.

  * Instructions in this .Guide on creating new Items.

  * The Eldritch Cyclopaedia - to replace this .Guide file there may be a

  * Improved graphics and sound effects.

  * Anti-Evil and Anti-Good weapons.

  * Proper linking between quests.

  * Networked multi-player mode, to make it more like a graphical MUD.

  * Complete re-write of the code... it's getting a bit woolly!

@ENDNODE

@NODE History "Versions history"

This is Eldritch V1.39b (BETA)

   It adds a few little tweaks and fixes some code.  It's also my first upload since
my most recent archives went belly-up, so it may not be missing some features...

   * The names of items are now displayed when using the inventory.

@NODE Eldritch1.38c
-- Eldritch V1.38c (BETA)
Completed : FIX

   It is an update to 1.38b, in which there were a number of bugs in the
load/save game routines, which had been almost completely rewritten and were
not properly tested..... 

Completed 17/6/95

New features/fixes:

   * Some visual bugs fixed when the desired font is not found.

   * Buttons on main menu rearranged and a new option added.

   * Player options are now saved in the Character save file.

   * The second button on the joypad now works!

   * NPCs now behave a little more sensibly if disarmed.

   * A bug in the Dungeon creator that made items dissappear from rooms for
     no apparent reason is fixed.
      [Unfortunately there is still a bug if you save the game while
       standing on an item - it doesn't get saved.... to be fixed!]

   * Character and City selectors are finally coded!

   * Inventory system is completely re-written and much improved.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Eldritch1.37
-- Eldritch 1.37
Completed 6.1.95

New features:

   * Added Morph and Teleport equipment types.

   * Added special sets of Dungeon and Techno display graphics.

   * Weapons may now have a Spell Effect.
     Currently Panic, Stun and Double and Triple Damage are available.
     They need a bit of tweaking ....

   * Fixed a bug in ammunition explosions, which made Eldritch bomb out
     if several things triggered each other off .....

   * A prototype of the City Editor is now available.
     The best way to make your own Dungeons is to use Dungeon generator and
      edit the resulting file.

   * .Asc City description files have been removed ... Dungeon Generator now
      saves much faster.

   * Equipment items can now have graphics and samples associated with them.

   * Key Cards and locked doors are now implemented.  The Dungeon Generator
      now creates Dungeons with a series of locked rooms and keys in them,
      so that the player must search for keys before they can complete the
      Dungeon.  Completing the Dungeon is achieved by reaching the steps in
      the room in the furthest bottom right corner.

   * Apparently the AMOS cursor did not appear if the Workbench screen was
      not already opened when Eldritch started up.  I couldn't recreate this
      problem on my A1200, so I assume it was a problem with OS 2.x.  All
      the same, the AmigaDOS window is now opened when booting from floppy.
      Deleting the first two lines of the s/startup-sequence file on the
      Eldritch disk will set this back to normal.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Eldritch1.35
---  Eldritch 1.35
Completed 20.11.95

  * Installed the new theme tune.

V1.34 Completed 8.11.95

  * Improved the Install_to_HD script.

  * Added some instructions on creating custom Creatures.

  * Fixed a few minor multitasking bugs.

  * Added a Save Options button to allow configuration to be saved.

  * Added a 30-second "Boids" screen saver.
    (Optimised for multitasking, not smoothness!)

  * Dungeon generator now places random items in Dungeons.

   Eldritch Version 1.34 was a bug-fix of version 1.33.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Eldritch1.32
---  Eldritch 1.32 (BETA)
Completed 16.10.95

  * Eldritch now runs at priority 0, meaning much better multitasking.
   (-1 priority was ditched because it caused hang ups if there weren't
    windows on the Workbench Screen)

  * Control options now available even during game.

  * Display of inventory on main screen.  (NOT YET COMPLETE)

@ENDNODE
@NODE Eldritch1.31
---  Eldritch 1.31 (BETA)
Completed 12.10.95

  * Added difficulty level requester.  Currently only affects random
creatures.

  * Made "moody" lighting optional.  Selecting "Lighting" from Options menu
toggles this.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Eldritch1.30
---  Eldritch 1.30 (BETA)
Completed 4.10.95

  * Fixed an annoying bug which stopped the Dungeon Generator from running.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Eldritch1.29
---  Eldritch 1.29 (BETA)
Completed: 3.10.95

  * It is now possible to USE an Item directly from the inventory screen.

  * There is a special button on the inventory screen for looting corpses.

  * Removed a buggy second-joypad-key-reader routine which read a pin that
most joysticks just short out.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Eldritch1.27
---  Eldritch 1.27 (BETA)
Completed:17.9.95

  * Multiple control options.  Full control throughout the game using either
Joystick, Mouse or Keyboard.

  * Dungeon Generator is now capable of making Super-Large rooms in
dungeons.

  * Rooms may now have any wall missing, allowing more flexibility in
Cities.

  * Added a Forest display template.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Eldritch1.24
---  Eldritch 1.24 (FIRST BETA RELEASE)
Completed: 9.9.95

This version features:

  * City and Dungeon generator programs are now integrated with each other,
      to save space on disc.

  * Load and Save games.  About eight games should fit on one floppy.
      (Hopefully)

  * Blood splats when you hit people in hand to hand, just so you make out
      what's going on more easily.

  * Some internal mapping of rooms is done to speed up operation of doors
      and other fixtures.  This is done on the fly the first time each room
      is entered by a character and takes on average about 150K ram.

  * Better control over roaming creatures, using experience point ratings.

  * New panic mode introduced for creatures, before they just choose to run
      away from you.  Surprisingly effective!

  * Main program now checks for presence of required directories in startup
      directory.  If they are not present then it assumes them to be on
      seperate disks.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Eldritch1.21
---  Eldritch V1.21
Completed: 5.9.95

This version features:

  * Exploding ammunition.

  * Improved character advancement system.

  * Item specific sounds.

  * Viewing of item statistics.

  * Off-Screen active characters.

  * Corpses appear when characters die, which can be looted for gear.

  * Nice death and getting hurt sounds.

  * Corpses decay once the character has been to about 10 more rooms.

  * Characters in rooms are arranged similarly.

  * Random dungeon generator is now included with the main kernel and
      is available stand-alone or from Eldritch itself.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Eldritch1.15
---  Eldritch V1.15
Started : 5.8.95
Completed : 27.8.95

Basic version of Eldrich, contains only the basic movement and exploration
system.

Discovered a few problems with AMOS Pro:
   Programs with lots of error handling (On Error Goto ... ) don't seem to
compile.  The only one that I got to compile gave a 3Mb executable.
   There is some weirdness about passing back Param values.  Not a reliable
means of data exchange.


This version features:

  * Space for 200 characters, 1000 rooms and 6000 objects per city.

  * Support for basic doors, which are open or closed and may also be locked.

  * Support for Hand-to-Hand, Ballistic and Grenade weapons.

  * Support for Credit Cards, Ammunition and Key Cards.

  * Rudimentary AI system for creatures, determined by their Mode.

  * Basic character advancement and experience system.

   Currently aiming only at 2Mb machines.

@NODE Problems "Problems running Eldritch"

If you experience any problems running Eldritch, first try disabling things
such as screen blankers, which can often interfere badly with Amos programs.

If this still does not work, ensure that as few commodities and other
background utilities are running as possible.

If you STILL find problems then try disabling the CPU caches.  On 040 and
possibly 060 machines the caches are a MAJOR source of problems with
Eldritch, due to a combination of poor coding (by Amos) and poor cacheing
implementation.  020 and 030 machines suffer less but may still cause
trouble on some accelerator boards.

Finally, if you still can't get the thing to work, give me a call.  Maybe I
can help.
