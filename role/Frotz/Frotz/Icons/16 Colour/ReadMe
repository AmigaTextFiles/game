Included here are Robert Fisher's 16 colour MagicWB icons. The palette
used is that proposed by Roman Patzner as a 16 colour extension to MagicWB.
If you don't already have this palette, an icon (SetColours) can be clicked
on. This uses SetPens by Joseph Luk, which requires at least Workbench 3.0.
The palette itself is stored in the text file Icon.palette.
