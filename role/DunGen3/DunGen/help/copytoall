   Copy To All takes the values for Level Width, Level Height, Nbr Of
Rooms, Room Minimum, and Room Maximum currently displayed, and copies them
to all levels. "All levels" refers to to the value contained in the Nbr Of
Levels field. If you have Nbr Of Levels set for 10 and you click Copy To
All, the current level's values will be copied to levels 1 through 10. If
you subsequently increase the value of Nbr Of Levels, everything over level
10 will contain the default values.
