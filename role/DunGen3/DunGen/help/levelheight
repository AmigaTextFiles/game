   Level Height sets the height for the current level. For info on
measurements, see Level Width. Important! If you set height for much more
than 34, the editor screen will be opened with AutoScroll. In order for it
to work properly, you have to be using at least a text overscan screen. If
you are using a standard screen such as 640 X 400, you will not be able to
scroll and edit all parts of the dungeon. More info available under Screen
Mode.

The minimum height is 5
The maximum height is 100 (better have just about all your chip mem free)
