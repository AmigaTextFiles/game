   Edit switches the display from the control panel to the editor. If you
have completed a successful build of one or more levels, you will see them
in the editor display. If you want to draw levels from scratch, you still
use the control panel to set number of levels, width, and height values
before editing. The keyboard shortcut is either the "E" key or the Esc key.
The Esc key toggles back and forth from between the editor and control
panel screens and is the only way to get back to the control panel from the
editor (except for generating an error by running out of chip mem :)
