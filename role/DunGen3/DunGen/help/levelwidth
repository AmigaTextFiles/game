   Level Width sets the width for the current level. The unit of
measurement is arbitrary. For AD&D® each unit would probably be considered
10 feet. So a level that is 33 X 33 is 330 ft X 330 ft. Different game
systems or personal preference can dictate each unit to be whatever you
wish. Important! If you set width for much more than 45, the editor screen
will be opened with AutoScroll. In order for it to work properly, you have
to be using at least a text overscan screen. If you are using a standard
screen such as 640 X 400, you will not be able to scroll and edit all parts
of the dungeon.

The minimum width is 5
The maximum width is 100 (better have just about all your chip mem free)
