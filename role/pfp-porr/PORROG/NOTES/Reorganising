I should reorganise the functions and stuff into more appropriate
choices of files:

Currently, maparray.c has a map generator and a map display function,
main.c has display initialisation and key stuff, etc, and
object.c has, er, item creation functions.

Should have:

mapgen.c with different map generator functions (including helper functions),
ui.c with the map display function, message display functions, curses
 initialisation, and user input functions. Basically everything that
 deals with curses in one file,
item.c should have stuff to do with items (only generic functions, no
 specific item types in it. Actual item data should be loaded from
 somewhere else instead),
monster.c should have stuff to do with monsters. We should have them
 reasonably soon hopefully!


The file maparray.h did have prototypes for the functions in maparray.c,
plus a lot of structure typedefs used there. Now, those typedefs are
in structures.h. As several of those are also about monsters or items,
maybe they should be split out further?
