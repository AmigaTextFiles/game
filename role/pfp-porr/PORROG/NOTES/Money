Porrog's currency:
==================

Lowest denomination is the iron groat. I'm not sure if this is going
to be worth exactly 1 unit, it might perhaps be 5 units... but it'll
probably be 1. If it *isn't* 1 unit, then all references to other
denominations being worth N groats should be considered to mean N units
instead.

Thruppeny bit is worth 3 groats (or 3 units, at least). I'm not sure
if it should be made of iron (like the groats), brass (like the farthings),
or bronze (making them individual, but complicating things a tiny bit).
Having different metals for each denomination allows one to refer to
coinage by their metal for certain questions...

A brass farthing, despite being originally the smallest denomination
(in *real life*...) at 1/4 of a penny, is worth 5 thruppeny bits, or
15 groats. Brass I felt to be somewhat more valuable than iron, and
probably a bit more valuable than a thruppeny bit, which I took to be
very cheap. It's value was therefore chosen to be an order of magnitude
higher than the groat, whilst still being a multiple of the thruppenny
bit. As an amusing (but entirely unplanned) effect of the way the next
denomination was chosen, a brass farthing works out to be exactly a
quarter of a tally.

The silver tally is the general unit for general commerce, and is worth
60 groats, which is 20 thruppenny bits- the name was chosen as a variation
on the word "score" (which also means 20). As aforementioned, a quarter of
a tally turns out to be a farthing, although this wasn't planned.

There is a higher denomination used for high value transactions, the
gold guinea, which is worth 375 groats (this is somewhat in flux. Other
values have included 192, 195, and 210...). That is, 6 tallies and one
farthing, OR 25 farthings, OR 125 thruppeny bits (it couldn't be simpler!).
Guineas are not normally used in day-to-day transactions however.

Short table:
   375: gold Guinea
    60: silver Tally
    15: brass Farthing
     3: Thruppenny bit
     1: iron Groat (OR Groat==5!!!)


Trade:
======

Due to the way the monetary system is organised, shopkeepers and other
traders will have to give you *change* if you give more than the exact
amount. However, they might sometimes accidentally short-change you.
It is important that shoppers check their change when it is given, as
mistakes cannot be rectified later. Conversely, falsely accusing a
shopkeeper of shortchanging you is liable to cause offence.

[gameplay effects: change will be given in random combinations of coinage;
between 1/4 and 1/2 of the time, shopkeepers will try to short-change you.
If you fail to correct a shopkeeper when (s)he does, the frequency and/or
scale of short-changing will increase somewhat. If you correct them
appropriately, these may (will?? I forget) decrease (reset?? again, I
forget...). If however, you falsely accuse them of short-changing you,
the shop prices will be increased (for you buying; the costs for you
selling will be correspondingly decreased...). It is not yet clear
whether this trend can be undone, probably not (as it is to do with
offence, not whether or not they can get away with ripping you off]

[shopkeepers might also be able to change currency in general, although
I imagine they'd be more amenable to doing so if you'd already traded
with them]

[Generally, expensive items such as magic books, etc would be priced
in Guineas, as would anything worth more than say, 8 guineas, or items
worth an EXACT number of guineas. Prices in guineas will probably not
ever include groats or thruppeny bits. They *might* include tallies
and/or farthings, but it is more than likely that they will simply
be integer numbers of guineas. Even so, obviously the guinea price could
be payed for with other denominations, although the shopkeeper might
give you a funny look if you hand over 3000+ groats...]
