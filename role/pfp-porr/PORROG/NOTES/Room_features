Room features
=============

I'd been wooly minded about how it was I needed to implement features
such as stairs and things.

DOH! Just use the tiletype. PTL_STAIRSUP and PTL_STAIRSDOWN, and
then things like PTL_PORTAL, and whatever other features I
think of. Can't think of any of them right now tho...

Oh yeah, altars. And traps.

  <  stairs up
  >  stairs down
  ^  trap (almost any type, determined by tile number)
  _  altar, plus some other features??
  #  some features. But not too many
  ¬  some sort of features?
  Hmm, how about the symbols like
  øØ°¿¡«»ÐÞ·÷¦ and so on...
  I ought to get a bit of use out of some of those.
  But I'd have to decide once I work out what other features to add.

Great. Now, what sort of functions do we use to place them?
For placing stairs and portals, etc, there is the issue that the
first time they are placed, you determine things like where the
destinations are. After that, you recreate the old settings.
Or something. ACtually, am I now talking out of my arse?
Hmm, no. When the other levels have been created, the exits must
be given pointers to those levels. When they haven't, the
pointers must be NULL.
Now, how do we store the details of all these features once we
leave the level? Maybe we limit the number of them and just have
one structure per level with coords of all the features, and their
details. That'd be pretty effective.

Dungeon forkage
===============
Should we allow the dungeon to fork? If so, I think we need to limit
the total number of stairs on a level, to say 4. Seems fair.

Now, more importantly, what topologies should we allow? Loops could
cause difficulties. Serious difficulties though? *shrug*
