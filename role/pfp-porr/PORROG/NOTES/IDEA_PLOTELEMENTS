Various bits to go in:
======================

-----
Dream I had:

I had just squirmed through a load of oddly contorted railings, to
find myself around the front of the small cinema-type-building. I was
trying to make up my mind whether to sit in Saddam Hussein's empty
cinema-seat (it even had his name taped onto the front of it): if
I sat in it, it would look as though I was trying to be him, but if
I avoided it, it would look as though I was being reverential to him.
In the end I sat half on it and half on the next (which was probably
an even worse thing to do, but bugger it, that's what I chose).
Having made up my mind, I got on with watching the program being shown.

Children's TV presenter Konnie Huq was explaining that cats are the only
creatures unharmed by blood pudding. She showed how a blood pudding was
made with a sandwich bag full of water with some drops of blood in it
and a small hole in the side. The bag was then put in some sort of
container (some ambiguity was present here. I myself tried a cup),
and more blood added to the bag such that blood stayed in the bag and
water came out the hole into the container. (Why? I don't know. Americans
and other foreign types take note: Real black pudding contains more than
just blood, and is made very differently...)

It was then explained that we were making this blood pudding for
Mike Yamway, who really liked blood pudding (it could even have been
that he *needed* it, I forget). Who is this Mike Yamway? I have
*no idea*. But I went looking for him, and soon found him, an 8 foot high
charcoal-grey space creature with one eye (about 2ft diameter, with
orange iris).  He seemed to appreciate the blood pudding.

What sort of character was Mike Yamway? I don't know, I woke up very
soon after meeting him- but he seemed friendly enough.

And what about this comment that cats were the only ones unharmed by
the blood pudding? Would Mike Yamway want something that would be
harmful to him? I suspect that perhaps Konnie meant that cats were
the only ones who would be unharmed by *making* the blood pudding-
perhaps they could give their blood easily for the purpose and
suffer no ill effects? Or perhaps they are immune to bad effects from
coming into contact with blood that was in the process of being made
into a blood pudding (with the final product being harmless to all).


What do we do with this whole idea? I haven't a flipping clue. But
Mike Yamway *shall* be in Porrog, dammit!

Spiders:

Ssh! Don't talk about the spiders!! They're secret.
Had an idea (to help keep source-divers and genuine developers alike from
stumbling across such things by accident) along the lines of having a
"secretsource" directory, with not so much *obfuscated* code as genuine
functions interspersed with red-herrings, with each function made
*reasonably* clear, but calling each of these functions could maybe
be done by function-pointers accessed through some sort of indirection
tables. We should maybe have 3 or 4 types of function pointer, and
a different public function to access each type.
Then, functions in the normal source could call
  if (do_secret_fn(V_SF_V_UNUSUAL_MOBS)) return;
  and know that that secret function would do a certain sort of thing
  (in this case placing any unusual monsters in situations that they
  could occur, etc), without knowing the details of which actual
  function does this, and so what exactly it does is unclear (eg-
  creating spiders wherever they are...But yes, shhh they're secret).

Objective:

There isn't one yet! There must be one. As I told Jonathan, I'd like
something more original and imaginative than Nethack's
"Retrieve the Amulet of Yendor for your god".
But I suspect that if we can't come up with something better, we may
have to default to my fallback plan of
"Retrieve the Amulet of Yob'led and flog it to the local pawnbrokers".
Be afraid! Be very afraid!!
