We make a markov model of the words (or at least one for different groups
of words) in the UK English dictionary file.

We then use that model to randomly generate imaginary words (or some
would maybe be the same as real words!) for use in Porrog, giving us
a very random model of reality!!

We can even have the meaning of the entities in our reality randomly
generated with the words for them: adjectives, objects, creatures, and
maybe areas and landmarks could have bitfields associated with them
to describe their relationships and behaviour.

Of course, some sort of consistency would be needed between realities,
EG it would be awkward to say the least, if you started a game in which
it was impossible to kill the mobs, or to gain experience! Further,
it is important for the entity associations to be described in some
way (possibly in the words of the imaginary language).

Proper Nouns in the dictionary should be one list (or should it be 2
lists, place names and people's names?)

common nouns in the dictionary should be another list, but should
they be divided into nouns for objects and noun forms of verbs, etc?

adjectives in the dictionary should be another list.

should verbs in the dictionary be another list??? Randomly generated
action concepts could be tough.
