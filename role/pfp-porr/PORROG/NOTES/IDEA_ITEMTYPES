Types:

COMESTIBLES
% is food as usual
" is condiments! Similar to potions or herbs.
! is potion

READABLES
? is scroll as usual.
+ is spellbook

WEARABLES
= is ring
] is armour
[ is er...
) is weapon (bladed only??)
} is ranged weapon?
These are likely wrong. Must compare Nethack, Adom, Omega, Zangband
to see what they use for each.
& is amulet?? Maybe not.

 Here's what the others use:
ROGUE: ]=armour, )=weapon/ranged/missile, = =ring,
   /=staff/wand. [,(, {} are not defined. No amulets?  %=stairs (down).
   #=passage

NH:    )=weapon, [=any armour:suit/shield/helmet/gloves/etc
   (=tool, [=suit/armour   (]=mimic), {}=scenery (water/fountain)
   "=amulet/web, &=demon. /=wand,  <=stairs up  >=stairs down (GOOD)
   #=passage

ADOM: #=wall, /=open door, &=forge/other feature, = =water
      [=any armour/shield?   \=wand,  (=weapon,
      }=missile weapon, /=missile, ]=tool. {=music instmnt.
      = =ring, "=book, ' =neckwear, ~=bracers (surely are armour?)
      ) doesn't represent anything? &= feature/forest/demon!
      <=stairs up, >=stairs down. (GOOD)

OMEGA: |=open door, -=closed door, #=wall, "=hedge, *=heap, 1-0=features
   )=weapon, (=missile weapon,    ]=suit of armour, [=shield,
   }=cloak,  {=pair of boots, = =ring. No helmets! No sign of missiles
   for the missile weapons? no amulets.  /=stick (as in wand?)

ZANG: |=blade, /=polearm/axe,  \=hafted (mace),
  (=armour/cloak, )=shield, ]=head,gloves,boots, [=hard armour.
  }=missile weapon, {=missile.  ,=food...
  = =ring,   "=amulet  &=chest! ~=other tool (incl junk)
  -=wand/rod _=staff   <=stairs up >=stairs down   #=wall
  %=mineral vein/tree *=buried treasure.
CRAWL (blurgh): #=wall, <=up, >=down(GOOD).
  )=weapon (sword,dagger,club,spear,mace, axe)...
  )=missiles (arrows,darts,needles,bolts,stones),
  )=missile weapons (blowgun)  do we see a pattern here? ;)
  [=armour(robe,leather armour),
  %=food/corpse
  "=amulet
(End of comparison of other roguelikes)

So, here's my opinion: ) is almost always a weapon (when it is used).
 Armour wants to be either [ or ], and in order to correspond to
 weapon, it ought to be ]. That agrees with omega and rogue, only
 vaguely with angband (] is other armour not main armour), but is
 at odds with Adom and Nethack. Unfortunately.
 = probably ought to be *any* jewelery or accessories. Perhaps.
 / ought to be wands, agreeing with near everything except angband
 (and opposite to Adom). whilst - ought to be missiles rather than
 walls???
 Should we have separate types of armour by different symbols?
 I think they would at most be divided into suits and "the rest".
 } ought to be missile weapons?
 Now, we have (, [, {.  One of these ought to be tools. Maybe one
 ought to be "non-suit armour", maybe one should be shields???
 Something should be containers: I don't think they should be
 lumped in with tools.
 "non-suit armour" other than shields ought to be represented by some
 sort of symbol that indicates a certain *smallness* as those items
 are pretty small...    ...But I can't find such a symbol :P
 & symbol wants to be used by something... Adom uses it for lots
 of stuff (forges, forests, demons!), NH uses it for demons, angband
 for chests, Omega for artifacts?! I feel inclined to maybe
 use it either for tools or small armour or features?
 Dont know what to do with \ (not wand!). | prolly should be rods (or staves).

 Alternative groupings:
   group all armour together.
   group suit+shield together, the rest(other) together.
   suit is exclusive, shield+other together. (suit is biggest).
   shield is exclusive, suit+other together. (shield is wielded, rest worn).
   suit exclusive, shield exclusive, the rest together.
   every type separate. (one is not really a substitute for another!)
  -I don't *really* want more than 2 groups for armour, there's not enough
   symbols.


 Here's another spin on this:
   (=shield           )=weapon   (both normally wielded)
   [=suit             ]=container      &=tool
   {=other armour     }=missile weapon -=missile
   armour             wieldables (apart from container..)
   left hand          right hand

  It has a certain something. But stops [] being associated with armour:(
  Still don't have a role for \ symbol, nor '

 _ wants to be altars. We SHALL have them. < stairs up, > stairs down,
 as with near any other SANE roguelike. Very few have them the other
 way round.

VALUABLES
$ is gold
* is rocks and gems?
[ is a box or chest????   under then new scheme, is ']'.

ZAPPABLES
  wand, staff, rod?

And what they do:

MAGICAL EFFECTS:
" (condiments) ! (potions) ? (scrolls) + (spellbooks?? or not..) *(gems)
= (rings) & (amulets)

Except... rings and amulets might be considered instead to alter your
status; Spellbooks might be considered to add things to your spelllist
(however we implement that)
Don't know what sort of magical effects gems might have.

STATUS VS EFFECTS:
potions, scrolls, gems? and condiments have immediate effects. Rings
and Amulets change your status whilst you wear them.
BUT: The immediate effects of the potions scrolls, etc could be to
alter your status (either permanently, for a short time, etc), and
the status given by the rings and amulets could have you periodically
undergo immediate effects (such as teleporting, etc)!

So, we should have a function that does "effect()", and a function
that does "set_status()". A function "check_status()" could maybe
do the periodical calling of effect() where the status warrants it.

Then, potions, scrolls, gems, condiments (incl foods with them) have
an (*Effect)(void) element, and Rings and Amulets have a Flag element
and a Modifier element.

I think rocks and gems can have many capabilities:
-They can have a status effect whilst carried,
-They can be invoked (eg by rubbing them or whatever),
-They can be lobbed at something or someone!

The throwing effect should be common to many magic items, and should
be an extension of the immediate effect. Maybe those functions given
in each magic item should have an argument "bool thrown" that is
set to 1 when it is thrown, if it's meaningful to do that (not
meaningful with scrolls, for instance), and an argument "eptr subject"
and "eptr target" that get given who activates/throws it and who
its targetted at.

Condiments:
Magical effects of condiments would probably work by imbueing food
with that effect, where the food that has the condiment on gets a
pointer to the condiment-type. When you eat the food, we check that
pointer to see what to do next. Food in general will probably have
some sort of effects anyway, but probably not the same as condiments.

Maybe we could have "rotten" food that could be made OK by certain
condiments (which would alter some flag).

Condiments such as salt and vinegar could pickle foods to stop them
decaying!

WEARABLES:
Armour affects your defensive ability.
Weapons affect your offensive ability.
But perhaps there are some weapons that affect your defensive ability
and armours that affect your offensive ability?
IIRC, Nethack, Adom, and Zangband have these. Prolly others do too.
EG, Gauntlets of Slaying in Zangband have plusses to skill/deadliness.

Perhaps other items should have these characteristics too? Maybe
Not just wearables?
Hmm. Wearables affect you whilst wearing them (as described above),
whereas the other things have some immediate effect. So anything else
that can alter defensive/offensive ability can be described within
those "magical effects" bits described above.
I think.
Hmm, as armour and weapons may have magical effects on status, perhaps
defensive/offensive ability should be a separate one from status
changes, and be on all wearables? But *only* wearables.

BOXES:
Yes, we want boxes and other such containers. Only carrying 15 or so
items is a PITA.
