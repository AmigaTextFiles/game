Soooo much that requires good design and planning is in the
area of game mechanics:

-The effect of armour was one of the first to be decided on, and
 took little head scratching.

-The effect of weapons, dexterity, agility, level, burden level, etc
 on ability to hit opponent, is difficult.
  --but I had a go. IIRC it doesn't yet take level or agility into account
  (agility affects evasion);
  I think that some weapons should have a dexterity level; if the wielder
  has that dexterity or above, there is no problem; if the wielder has
  less than half that dexterity, the weapon is unwieldable; in between,
  the tht is scaled linearly based on the interpolation between those
  points. EG, a whip could have a dexterity level of 200 or so, so you'd
  need a dexterity of over 100 for it to be reasonably likely you'd get
  a hit; above 200, you'd get the full benefit of the weapon (which could
  then give pretty high tht bonuses based on the weapon's higher range)

-The effect of agility, level, burden level, etc on ability to dodge an
 opponent's blows, is quite difficult.
  --but I think I got it well. Doesn't yet take burden into account; it
  ought to be primarily armour burden, partly affected by inventory burden.

-The effect of weapons, strength, level, burden level, etc on damage
 dealt in combat, is difficult.
  --I made something up and it was shit. I've not come up with anything
  any better.

-The effect of shield size, dexterity, agility, level, burden level, etc
 on ability to block an opponent's blow with the shield, is difficult.

-Worse still, should the shield block *and then* the player evade, or
 the player evade and then block with the shield, or should it be one
 or the other randomly, or should both add together for a larger
 evasion score? I think this one is complicated.

-The exact amount of experience given for killing a given monster, which
 currently looks wrong.

-Difference in experience levels for monsters or something like wot I said somewherers
Mmm.
