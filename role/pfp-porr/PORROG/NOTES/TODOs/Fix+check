Things that are either done but need checking,
or that need fixing outright.

-----------------------------------------------

-pick_room() and pick_room_from_area() have always seemed to work... but
 looking at the code again whilst adapting it for use in shuffle_potions(),
 it looks as though pick_room() doesn't necessarily work (might pick room
 0 whether or not it is real room??), and pick_room_from_area() may just
 be picking a room from room 0's area????? If that's the case, I'm sure
 it should have crashed long ago...

-Check for more cases of freeing structures in lists BEFORE getting their
 "next" element (which it seems will *often work, but not always).

-I've changed the map generator to work with "clev", and have that
 initially set to 0 so the monsters initially placed there are all L0
 (such as land plankton), and is set to 1 straight after the first level
 is generated so all the rest may be L1 too. Check this won't all break
 somehow when I set up multiple levels with depth variables.

-Check the display's scrolling/recentring functions (when the player
 moves), as their parameters are likely skewed now the display height's
 been changed.

-Finish off the plunk_paths functions (left them 95% done or so...)

-Though I've added colour, I didn't really know what I was doing. Fix
 it up. Also put colour in other parts, like item display.

-Check on the moving-to-intersections part of the AI (for moving around
 other monsters)

-Consider making show_messages() take some argument to stop it logging
 certain messages. Possibly such messages should be shown in another
 way, though.

-Are there any changes that should be added to the help system?

-Consider a different LOS/automap system.LOS could be true LOS, and
 automapping is done clunkily: perhaps instead of the "Remembered"
 field being an item, it could be able to record the status of doors,
 etc, which we currently are able to see change. OR, we could have
 some phony "closed door" and "open door" item types to plug in there!
 --NOW, doors are represented by phony items, so their remembered
  status works.

-Fix up the code for choosing items from lists. Work out the whole
 set of functions we have for such stuff, and all the times we need
 them (or functions like them).

-How could crash() be done better?

-Finish splitting headers into either typedefs or prototypes (and defines).
 Further split prototypes into functions used entirely by the matching
 .c file and those defined there but used outside it.

-Vastly improve the functions like describe_item(), item_basename(),
 describe_feature(), etc etc.

-Can files be rearranged better?

-Work out better arrangement for equipment functions (and keys!)
 also make sure they all work properly!!

-Work out more ways to improve thing-type initialisation code.

-Work out better way for describe_item() and item_basename() to work
 out stuff to do with flavoured items (currently need a big switch
 before you can find if it is recognised, and what its Dname is).

-What more can be done for the grid arrangement? Old TODO file said
 "mebbe using #defines for defining the grids and accessing them." but
 I think I've already done that..
