 Currently, every time the player presses a key, the game advances by the
same amount of time, in which each monster is able to do exactly the same
amount as each other and the player.

 Reasons this is bad:
-Certain actions the player does should take no time (eg, displaying
inventory, looking at items on the floor, pressing a key that does nothing)
-Monsters should be able to have different speeds to each other (although
 that's likely to play havoc with the AI's method for getting monsters
 to bypass each other in the tunnels).
-Eventually there ought to be ways the player's speed can be altered one
 way or another (eg potions).

 General way of doing this:
-Each action the player can do returns the amount of time it takes (likely
 to vary, especially depending on if it succeeds or fails).
-Each monster similarly takes varying amounts of time to do different things,
 which is also affected by monster's speed (when implemented).

-These time values will be such that generally, one step for an average
 speed player takes around 1000 time units.

-Each time player or monster acts, that given amount of time is added to
 a "counter" for them; further, the player's latest action's time is
 remembered.

-Each iteration through the game update loop, pick some value that will
 be about  min of (50,player_action's time). So if the player did
 something taking 0 time, that value will be 0. If the player did something
 taking 1000 (or could be much more, even), it'd be just 50. If the player
 hadn't done anything that iteration (because of the next rule), then I
 think the value would be the 50, but I'm not sure.

-Now, having got that value, you subtract that value from the player and
 each monster, whether they get to move or not. Then, if the player or
 monster has its counter at 0 or below, it is able to act again.


 PSEUDOCODE:
 ===========

 ctrl_loop()
 {
    player.Ticker=0;
    loop_forever {
      if(player.Ticker<=0) {
         get_keys();
         switch(key) {
            case moveabout:
              pdur=p_do_move(direction);
              break;
            case pickup:
              pdur=p_do_pickup();
              break;
            case drop:
              pdur=p_do_drop();
              break;
            case wait:
              pdur=500;
              break;
            default: /* bad key */
              pdur=0;
         }
         player.Ticker+=pdur;
      }
      gametick=min(50,pdur);
      for(each mob) {
         if(mob.Ticker<=0) {
            mob.Ticker+=m_do_ai_actions();
         }
         mob.Ticker-=gametick;
      }
      player.Ticker-=gametick;
    }
    /* End of game */
}

Note that under this scheme, monsters shouldn't be able to have actions that
take less than 50 units, or they could end up with very negative values (it's
OK for them to get values as low as -49 or so), such that they could later
do very slow actions in one turn...
