Notes on how to archive maps
============================

This is necessary for 2 different things:
The most obvious is for saving the game.
But it is also pretty important for changing level- A full array of
maploc_t structures, and pointers to tunnel structures, comes to
quite a bit of space: around half a meg per level, IIRC. Whereas
the actual area, region, room, tunnel and entrance data come to
more like 10K per level. So yeah, this means that if each time
the player leaves a level, the layout of that level is only
retained in *that* format, then we can store LOTS of fully
persistent levels.

Hmm, would it make sense for us to convert those data structures
to a bitstream for the purposes of retaining levels in memory?
It occurrs to me that it wouldn't be likely to save much memory,
and it would be simple enough to just have a "level_t" structure
that has an array of roomdata_t, and a pointer (or 2!) to some
area_t structures (which everything else could hang off of).

But the bitstream conversion would be necessary for saving and
loading the game.
Use something like sprintf("%c%c%c%c",whatever); into buffers,
and then dump to disk.
