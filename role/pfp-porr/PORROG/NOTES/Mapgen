At this point, the initial map generator has already
been laid out in the file "Tunnelling", has
been implemented, and works.

Now, the question is:
How do we deal with more than one map?

It eventually occurred to me that it made most sense
that as the map generator created a lot of structures
for tunnels, areas, rooms, etc, we could really use
these to regenerate the maps from.
And of course it was already obvious that we didn't want
to keep each map array that got created, so...

The arrays "map" and maybe "tmap" are simply GLOBALS,
that get initialised at the start of the game,
there are never more than one of them (each), and
they represent the map of *where you are*.

When you return to an old level, you use all that tunnel,
area, room data to carve out the contents of map and tmap
again (mkmap_p1() has to be used to change them back
to all rock before doing this). Hopefully those data
structures should take less memory (and disk space!!)
than the whole map arrays.

-Checked this with sizeof() in gdb: the space taken
 up by all the roomdata_t array PLUS all the possible
 (I think) tunnellist_t structures, is around 16K per
 level. It's very likely this would usually be more like
 10K or so.
 Whereas, the space taken up by map (an array of 140x140
 maploc_t elements) comes to just under half a megabyte...
 How's that for good compression? :)

Not only is this useful for playing across many persistent
levels, it also means you can have reasonably sized save-files :)
