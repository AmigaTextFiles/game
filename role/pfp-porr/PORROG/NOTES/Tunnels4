Map Generation: The higher-level POV
====================================

 Eventually, I intend to change the map generator such that make_dmap(),
etc can be controlled by a higher-level function such that the number
of individual areas (currently hard-coded to 1) can be controlled, and
the connections of stairs can be set, etc.

 But what would be the method for controlling the overall 3d structure
of the dungeon (multiple levels)?

 It's a binary tree!

 Max number of separate areas per level should be limited to 3 or
maybe 4 at the most. Should be able to match relative size of area to
number of nodes in tree plan for area. Each level should have a hard
limit for number of stairs, which is obviously constrained by the
number of features that can be built. The number of features should
likely be increased from 10 to around 16... at which point the
max number of stairs should be around 12. The probability of making
another stair up or down in an area should be lower for each one.

 This doesn't allow for loops, which I'd like to some extent.
Maybe allow lines to be replaced with loops.
