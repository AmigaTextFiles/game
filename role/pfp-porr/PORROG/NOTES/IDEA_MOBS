I do not want yet another game full of orcs and goblins and elves and
dwarves. Not none of them.

a- Awks (Auks?): Flightless bird, a bit like a penguin. Gotta kill em all!
   Might occasionally react as AWK?

g- Gerbils: Small rodents- many live in the Passages of Uranus!
   (see NOTES/IDEA_DEITIES)

s- Sprites: Magical creatures with cartoonish appearance. Examples: Puckman,
   Magic Minah, Morris Mole.

h- Hammoth: Tusked giant hamster, 200ft tall!

w- Witch: A free spirited woman in harmony with the cosmic cycles, with
   mystical powers derived from nature. She also has green warty skin,
   a pointy black hat and a broomstick.

c- Vampire crab: has the power to make you fall asleep and have nightmares.

 -I feel inclined to add snails. But where?

 -Also land-plankton! A type of cannon-fodder creature.

v- sentient Vegetables (eg: carrot monsters, which can see stealthy or even
   invisible characters, due to enhanced vision)

i- insect-like invertebrates? Includes land-plankton: the de-facto
   cannon-fodder creature, that is sort of like a cross between a
   lobster, a king prawn, a spider and the face-huggers from Alien, and is
   around 2 foot long and 1 foot wide. They're greyish.

 -Really want some monster types that can roam in gangs (or even small
  armies?!?), but not having orcs or goblins makes it unclear what sort
  of creatures could fill this role. Witches and sprites would be intelligent
  enough, but don't strike me as likely candidates :(
  I suppose mebbe gerbils could fill that role occasionally? As the
  Passages of Uranus (and the Temple of Uranus) are filled with them,
  it would work out as lots of army squadrons around there, with them
  only rarely being found in squadrons elsewhere (because gerbils in
  other parts of the game would only be common rather than prolific)
