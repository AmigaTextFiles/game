This directory is a load of PBM raw files used by Porrog for
screens. Note that these are only used in certain parts of the
game (such as when you start and when you die, etc), and the
size and format are *fixed*. You can't just stick in some picture
and hope for the best :)

Note also, that due to the format, the files are each less than a
quarter of a kilobyte!! And yes, if they were stored as the raw ASCII,
they'd take more than that and be harder to edit.

Finally, if you want to make images for Porrog, it's important to note
that the aspect ratio of the images is not quite that of the final
display. I suggest you draw them at say, 400X192, and then rescale
them to 80X24, to get the appropriate proportions.
