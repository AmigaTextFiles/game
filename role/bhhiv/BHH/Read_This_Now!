Ok, If you can not or will not  read the Doc's here is a quick install guide.

Find a hard drive.  

Unpack the Archive.  It will leave a drawer named BHH.

Make an Assign in your startup (or whatever) called BHH: that points to this
drawer.  

Copy the fonts in the extras drawer to your fonts dir.  

Be sure to have some type of cycle to menu utiltie running.

Start BHHIV.  

After that either read the unfinished docs or experiment.

See ya.
