INNER DEMONS

For those of you who would like to order the Registered version of
Inner Demons, simply read the ordering information below.

The Registered version contains HAM graphics for practically every
location in the game, including character screens and screens involving
the main character's hallucinations. Most of the graphics have
been digitized, giving them a realistic look.

The game takes up three diskettes, which includes full instructions
on disk. I will also send a copy of the game's solution, to those
who request it.

Due to the violent content in the game, it is recommended for mature
players only.


Inner Demons .... (3 Diskettes) $10.00

Requires: 1 MB Amiga, 2 drives recommended, but not required.

(Game solution available upon request).

Foreign Currencies accepted, so long as you are willing to send cash
through the mail. Foreign checks cost too much to convert.

(I accept cash, check or money order. Foreign Currencies accepted through
mail. Do not send foreign checks. If you decide to send foreign currency
please keep in mind the U.S. dollar conversion rates.)

Free Postage on all orders.

Also, I am looking for any artists or musicians who would like to
work on a future game (Amiga or IBM). Anyone who is interested can feel free
to write me or send samples of their work.

Please send orders or any correspondence to:

Michael Zerbo
16 Colony Drive
West Sayville, N.Y, 11796-1611

Hope you enjoy the game.
