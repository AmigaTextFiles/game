Instructions
------------

   To start the game, double-click on the icon.

   To install the game to a hard disk, copy the disk to a drawer, copy the 
   fonts to your fonts directory and add `assign gracdemo: whateverdrawer/`
   to your startup-sequence. Sorry, no script included due to lack of disk
   space.

Game Controls
-------------

   The screen is divided into two areas: the control panel and the graphics
   window. The control panel contains a message line, a text window and six
   verbs;

      Examine               Used for looking more closely at objects
      Use                   Items in the inventory (displayed in the text 
                            window) can be used on other objects.
      Operate               Use an object on its own.
      Take                  Pick up an object.
      Talk                  Talk to anyone worth talking to.
      Shoot                 Only if you have a gun.

   The left mouse button is used to select verbs in the control panel and 
   move the character if clicked in the graphics window. The right mouse 
   button is used for selection of objects.

   Example: To take the laser cutter, first click with the left button on
   the 'take' verb, then move the mouse pointer over the laser cutter (the
   name of the object will appear in the message line) and click the right 
   mouse button.
