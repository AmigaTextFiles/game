*****************************GEO'S QUEST*****************************

INTRODUCTION
------------

Are the new graphic adventure games getting to darn complex?
Do you long for the simpiler days of early vintage  Sierra graphic
adventures like Kings Quest 4 or Space Quest 4?
I know I do, thats why I created GEO'S QUEST!
Using Edmund Clays amazing GRAC2 here's a graphic adventure that doesn't
require a degree in Brain Surgery to complete. And, unlike the Sierra games
there's no dropping dead at any wrong decision. You should be able to solve
this one in 1 or 2 sittings.


INSTALLING GEO'S QUEST

----------------------
The game is rather large and will only run off a hard-drive. Sorry, I've not
mastered the install process yet, and I can't quit figure out that part of GRAC2
yet.
So, make a New Drawer in your sys: partition (the same partiion that your workbench
is loaded on) and label it GQ.
The game will only run from this drawer on  your sys: partition.
Un Archive the LHA archive into the GQ drawer. It is important that all
files are in the GQ drawer in the sys: partition. you will only see 2 icons,
the game icon GQ1 and this readme text, all other files ar only visable with
the show all files selection in WB 3.x.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

I developed the game on my 1200 tower with blizzard'060, Z-Bus with Spectum
graphics card and 48mb ram. It runs great on this system.
It should work on any amiga with harddrive and a minimum 2mb ram.
I tested it on a stock 1200 with no fast ram or acceleration, and it ran OK,
a bit sluggish at times, but not bad. It ran flawlesly on a 4000/040 with
16mb ram as well as a stock A3000/025 with 8mb ram.
So I suspect the stock 16bit amigas (500, 600, 2000) will probably run slow.
The screens are in either 32 colour hires,
or 32 colour lowres, so a standard amiga monitor, TV, or scan doubled svga should
be fine.
Please note, the GRAC2 game devolpment software is a PAL software item. I
sized the pics etc to fit on my NTSC system. Its not bad. When played in PAL
mode however, it appears a bit smaller.


GAME PLAY
----------

The game includes 30 graphically rich rooms with sounds and a point & click interface.
Solve the adventure puzzle and win the game.
You control or operate the game through  a control panel lcoated below the rooms
commands: EXAMINE (EYE) - look at things, rooms etc

To select any commad simply point to it and click the left mouse button
To do the command point at whatever on the screen and click the right mouse
button (eg. to look at the bush, point at the EYE (examine) button,
select it by clicking the left mouse button, then point at
the bush (its name will appear in the message window) then select the bush
but clicking the right button. REMEMBER: left button to select, right to do it.
Wlaking is simply pointing to a place in the room and clicking the left
button.
There is a message window where the command name appears when selected as
well as naming several objects or areas in the room when your pointer is over them.
A window is also in the control panel that identifies your items as well as
important messages as the game plays on.

CONCLUSION
----------

Have fun, I did creating it. Comments, bug reports etc, ar welcomed. But
please be kind, this is my 1st attempt at anything like this. I couldn't
have dome it without Edmund Clay's GRAC2 game development software.
Stay tuned for GEO'S QUEST 2 ***In Search of Queen Lorrayne***
