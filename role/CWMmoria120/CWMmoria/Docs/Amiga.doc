New News:
--- -----
Plenty of new stuff has been added since 1.1.0, mainly just stuff to keep up
with Umoria 5.5.2, but also a few things of my own.  For a complete list
see CWM_Changes.doc.

So What?:
-- ------
I have tried to maintain the same level of difficulty in this game as in
the original UMoria 5.5.  Wherever I wanted to make a change, I would always
ask myself if it would make the game easier, and if I answered yes, I would
just grit my teeth and deal with it.  Therefore, almost all of the changes I
made were minor things, but I think they add up to the best UMoria game out
there.
 
Installing:
-----------
Run it from CLI.  It's not that tough.

Make a directory and put all the files listed below in the right place.
Assign 'moria:' to this directory.
Copy iff.library to libs: (the version in this distribution is 22.1)
Run moria.
run 'moria -?' if you have any trouble.

These are all the files you need for Moria to run (* = optional):

In 'Moria:'
    Moria
    MoriaGFX.iff       MoriaGFXsmall.iff
   *MoriaTitle.iff    *MoriaTomb.iff
    
In 'Moria:files/'
    Hours               News
    origcmds.hlp        owizcmds.hlp
    roglcmds.hlp        rwizcmds.hlp
    scores
    version.hlp         welcome.hlp

In 'libs:'
    iff.library     (version 22.1 or higher)

Other:
------
This program should only be run with a screen size of 640x200x4.

I tried to organize the graphics so that they are easy to change.  If you do
make any changes, I would like to see them.  If I like it, I will include it
in subsequent releases of the game.

If you find a bug, please send me a bug report.  I might not fix it 
immediately, but please send it all the same.  I intend to stick by this
program for as long as possible.

If you have any suggestions or complaints, or even praise, please drop me
a note.  I would really appreciate any feedback you have to offer.
