Changes from CWM Moria 1.1.0 to CWM Moria 1.2.0:

 o  Up to date with Umoria 5.5.2, including small monsters, improved monster
    confusion and turn undead, and stone to mud on rubble is now the same as
    tunneling (1 in 10 chance of finding something).

 o  Completely reworked bitmaps, now better than ever before.

 o  GfxBase bug fixed (for you programmers out there).

 o  Weapon in hand now displayed in lower left corner, with helpful color
    coding.

 o  All high scores can be seen with the 'V' command or the -s switch.

 o  Screen to back gadget now available in upper right corner if you can
    find it. :-)

 o  Many other minor changes too minor to mention.

Changes from CWM Moria 1.0.1 to CWM Moria 1.1.0:

 o  Enhanced global mapping that shows the whole map at once, available by
    pressing the ' (apostrophe) key.  Now 33% larger than before.

 o  More color coded messages than ever before.
    Here is a guide to the colors:
    White       = Normal info.
    Light Green = Great       - gaining a level or stat increase.
    Blue        = Really good - killing a monster.
    Green       = Good        - hitting a monster.
    Yellow      = Bad         - missing a monster, becoming confused.
    Red         = Very Bad    - Being hit by a monster, becoming poisoned.
    Dark Red    = Awful       - stat decrease, death.
    Tan         = Other       - If it's not good, bad or normal, it's Other.

 o  The original '/' command is back, now you can look through your monster
    memory at any time.  Original monster letters are used.

 o  Genocide now works correctly, using the original monster letters.
 
 o  Stats displays (like strength and XP) are color coded. Stats that are 
    decreased are displayed in red.  HP and Mana are as follows:
    100%        White
    99% - 80%   Light Green
    79% - 60%   Green
    59% - 40%   Yellow
    39% - 20%   Red
    19% -  1%   Dark Red
     0%         Tan

 o  '0' equals 'open' command, '+' equals 'look' command.  For use with the
    numeric keypad.

 o  2 sets of graphical bitmaps, one with nice little pictures, and one with
    colorized ASCII chars, for the purists out there.

 o  I tried to get Moria to detach from CLI so you wouldn't have to worry
    about stack size, etc. but whatever I tried just made a big mess.
    So stack size is still recommended to be set to about 30k.

Changes from CWM Moria 1.0.0 to CWM Moria 1.0.1:

 o  The druid save has been reduced from 60 to 42.  With the old value,
    30th level Gnomes and 36th level Elves would never fail a save.

 o  When your character is able to see invisible, the detect monsters spell
    will detect invisible monsters also.

 o  the (l)ook command no longer detects a magma or quartz seam unless 
    there is a treasure or monster on it.
    
below is a list of deviations for CWMmoria 1.0.0 from UMoria 5.5:
(changes in game play only)

 o  Bashing into an empty space moves you into that space.

 o  All classes are available for all races.  Classes which are 'cheating'
    are listed in red.

 o  The Druid class by Michael Marcelais has been added.

 o  Dragon's breath ball sizes change with the amount of damage they do.
    Dragon bat's breaths will only be size 1 big, while Ancient Dragon's
    breaths will usually be size 3 or 4.

 o  Haggling is based on your level and the price of the item.  The higher
    your level and the lower the price, the greater the chance of not having
    to haggle for that item.

 o  When money or an item is stolen, you are informed of the amount or
    the item.

 o  When you (l)ook at a monster, you are given its status as well as its
    identity.  You are told whether or not it is asleep, and approximately
    how many hit points it has.  This does make the game easier, but I think
    it's fair, so I've left it in.  Status is as follows:
        
            > Max HP        - energized
            > 300 HP        - dangerous
        100% - 85% of Max   - healthy
         84% - 60%          - strong
         59% - 40%          - fit
         39% - 30%          - weak
         29% - 20%          - wounded
         19% - 10%          - badly wounded
          9% -  0%          - dying

    Max HP is the creatures maximum hit points.  If this number is greater
    than 300, then 300 is used.  (i.e. An Emperor Lich will be 'dangerous'
    until it has less than 300 hit points, then it will be 'healthy',
    'strong', etc. It will be 'energized' if it has more than 1520 hit 
    points.)

 o  Hallucination has been changed due to the extra graphics.  Now just item
    and monster graphics are randomized when hallucinating, instead of
    everything in the dungeon.
