      Character social class is arguably the least useful attribute in Moria.
  It determines starting money and can possibly have a fleeting effect on the
  ego of the player.  However, I have, through endless spacebar-pushing and
  number-recording in the character generation program, managed to piece 
  together the social class system in Moria.  It is in none of the spoilers
   and absent from the FAQ, so I thought it may be of some curiosity interest
   to this group.  So, without further ado, here goes.

   1. Humans, Half-Elves, Half-Orcs.
                              Base       Birth                Family
      Parents' occupation     Range    circumstances  Adj.   circumstances Adj.
          Serf               16-19      1st child     +5       Well-liked  +5
         Yeoman              31-34    1 of several     0   Credit to family 0
         Townsman            41-44    Illegitamate,         Black sheep    -35
         Guildsman           56-59     acknowleged   -10
         Landed Knight       71-74    Illegitamate,
         Titled Noble        81-84    unacknowleged  -20
         Royal Bloodline     91-94     Adopted       -20*

                                      *applies to half-orcs only;
                                       all half-orcs are adopted.

       Racial adjustments (half-elves only)

         Race of elvish parent   Adjustment
         Green Elf    (mother)      0
                      (father)     +5
         Grey Elf     (mother)     +5
                      (father)     +10
         High Elf     (mother)     +15
                      (father)     +20

        N.B.:  Regardless of adjustments, the lowest social class is 1, and
               the highest is 100.

        So, it is possible for the child of a landed knight (base 71-74)
        to end up in the titled noble base range if the child is the first
        and well-liked.  Indeed, I have seen it occur.  The only way, then,
        for a human chacter to get a social class of 100 is to be the first
        child of a royal bloodline and well-liked.  I've never seen it happen,
       though.

    2. Elves
