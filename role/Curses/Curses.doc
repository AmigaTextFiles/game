Curses
------

Curses is a modern text adventure, written by Graham Nelson. It is an
excellent example of the sort of games currently being written by a group
of people based around the ftp site ftp.gmd.de and the Usenet groups
rec.arts.int-fiction and rec.games.int-fiction.

The game was written using Inform, a specifically designed adventure game
compiler which generates a machine-independent format game. This game can
then be played using any suitable interpreter. The interpreter included
here (Frotz) was written by Stefan Jokisch and ported to the Amiga by me,
David Kinder. The full Frotz package can be found on Aminet in the game/role
directory.

To get started, try reading all the information available by typing in
"help". The parser is very powerful (indirect objects, disambiguation, etc.)
so you shouldn't have any "guess the verb" problems. If you like this, 
loads more games are available from the ftp site ftp.gmd.de in the directory

	/if-archive/games

This and other interpreters can be found in

	/if-archive/infocom/interpreters

and the Inform compiler (along with executables for the Amiga and many other
machines) in

	/if-archive/infocom/compilers/inform
