Introduction

    I wanted somewhere to put my things, such as a locker room, or a hotel,
but there wasnt anything.  This was partly a learning exercise, but can
still be useful.  Each player can leave stuff here, and collect it later.


Installation

    Log in a SysAdmin, source the file.  Go somewhere, and in
wizard mode, type

	use t_util.
	MakeLocker( <room> ).

If you supply a nil room, it will default to Here().  You can use
"HELP" to get a list of commands, "CHECK" to see what you have
stored here, "CHECKIN" to store an object, "CHECKOUT" to retireve
an object.


To do

    Place a limit on the number of items you can store.  Check to
see that quest items are not stored here.  Charge for storage.
