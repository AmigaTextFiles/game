Introduction

    I wanted a means of telling the time, so I created a clock in the
town, and a digital watch, which you can buy at the mall.  This is
"my first MUDCode", so its very spartan, and somewhat embarassing.
Please dont laugh.


Installation

    Log in as SysAdmin, and source ReadTime.m.  You should probably
change the cost from 1 blutos to something else.  Maybe you could
give them away with packets of cereal ;-)


To do

    Jazz up everything!  (Or throw it away!)  Seriously,  I want to
modify the clock and watch so it shows GAME TIME, rather than server time.
I also want to turn the clock into a proper clock tower, so people can
wander inside and take a look at the machinery (quest potential here),
add a backlight to the watch, an alarm and timer.


Final word
----------

I later discovered the "who" command, which reports the server time.
Oh well {shrug}, it wasnt worth keeping anyway.
