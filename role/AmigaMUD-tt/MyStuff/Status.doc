Introduction

    In the AmigaMUD 1.0 standard scenario, the status command is
defined exclusively by the combat section.  This file extends the
status command to allow you to plug in your own status reports.


To Use

    Log in as SysAdmin, and source mystuff/status.m.


Info for programmers

    The new status command runs a list of actions attached to the
character, via a p_pStatActions property.  When developing your
own "modules", you can add actions via the AddStatAction() procedure.


Final word

    Actually, I hate this piece of code.  It seemed a good idea at the
time, but I'd much rather have one procedure which displays everything,
and have characters initalised for combat and magic at character creation
time.  Anyway, its plug and play, so maybe its not so bad after all.
