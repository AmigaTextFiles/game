Introduction

    I wanted some way of "dropping" money.  You could give money to
people present, but not drop any.  Heres my "hack" to do so.


Installation

    Log in as SysAdmin, source money.m.  It creates a "money template"
object, which has a get checker, which adds the money's value to your
p_pMoney value.  It also adds a look action, so you can see how much
money is in a pile, and replaces the v_drop routine from verbs.m, to
allow you to "drop" some money.  Thats it really.  I guess you could
modify the monster and player kill routines so that money is dropped
where they die.  Otherwise, this might be handy for bank vaults and
so on....


To do

    Better descriptions would be nice.
