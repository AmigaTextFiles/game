Introduction

    In the AmigaMUD 1.0 standard scenario, the help is rather limited.
This file redefines the help system, so that "help" gives you the old
help, but you can also "help <word>" to get information on that word.


To Use

    Log in as SysAdmin, and source mystuff/help.m.  Take a look
at the source and add your own.

    > help help
    > help movement


To do

    Lots more help texts.  Would be nice to be able to load them from
a file, or have "groups" which automatically display related words.
