Introduction

    I decided to build a hotel ages ago.  It was mostly an, exercise, but
partly out of a need for privacy, and social interaction.  People can get
a room, to entertain, keep things, practice building, or just to get some
peace and quiet.  The "other facilities" (so far, an unbuilt restaurant),
were meant for people to meet and socialise in.  I was planning a swimming
pool, gym, casino, and cabaret.  I just havent got around to it yet.


To Use

    Log in as SysAdmin, and source hotel.m.  This will build a hotel
adjacent to the office tutorial, opposite the park.  You can register
at the reception desk.  All rooms are on the first floor (use the lift).
Magically, when you use the lift in the button, it takes you to your
room.  I made it this way so that people would neither have to carry a
key around with them (which could easlily be lost), nor have to
navigate through lots of boring corridors to get to their room.


To do

    Graphics.  Furnish the restaurant with tables, a menu, waiters.
Perhaps make a kitchen at the back (opportunity for a quest).  Build the
swimming pool, casino and so on.  Furnish the rooms a bit more.  Put
a charge on the rooms.  Limit the amount of stuff that can be stored
there, and place a checker to prevent people from taking quest items
into their rooms, preventing anyone else from completing them.
