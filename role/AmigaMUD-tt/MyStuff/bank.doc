Introduction

    This is a bank system, which allows you to have different bank
organisations, each with several local branches.  You can deposit or
withdraw from your account at any branch of that bank.  You can
also have a bank account with each bank.


Why???

    You might want to make players money more accessible, by having
multiple branches of that bank, but also have different "national"
banks in each different game zone.


To Use

    Log in as SysAdmin, and source mystuff/utility.m, then mystuff/bank.m.

e.g.
    > CreateBank("Runnymead").

    Loans, overdrafts, bank managers from hell, stocks and shares market,
