Introduction

    I wanted to create a trashcan which people can put rubish in,
rather like the garbage room, but as an object.  Yet again, this is
one of my earliest pieces of code, so dont give me grief over it! 
It is mostly built around the garbage room code.


Installation

    Log on as SysAdmin, source the file.  Create a child of the trashcan
object, and put it somewhere where people will use it.


To do

    Graphics, sounds, better description etc...


Other ramblings

    I guess you could offer a small "reward" for people being
tidy and throwing things away.  I noticed that CirclMUD has a "junk"
command which destroys unwanted objects, and gives you some money
in reward.  I might try to set up the trashcan as a recycling
thing, which rewards the players for clearing up.
