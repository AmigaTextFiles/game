@node gamma "How to use GammaChar"

   GammaChar is a small character creation program for the amiga, it allows
saving and loading of either variable files or text files. To start
it off, the main menu has three options. These three options are 
Create a New Gamma World Character, Load and Browse a Saved Character, and
lastly Abort and Exit.
   
   Create a New Gamma World Character allows you to create and save a
character by entering a few simple numbers and names. It is very easy to
use and all you have to do is enter what it asks.
   Load and Browse a Saved Character lets you load in a variable file and
browse it with the built-in brower. From here, you may also save the
character as a text file or save it again as a variable.
   Abort and Exit exits the program.

@node require "Requirements and Installation"

   GammaChar 0.9 requires the font topaz. Without it, the program will go
with the default text which may not work as good as topaz.

   To install GammaChar, just unlha the files where you want them. A 
directory will be created here with all the files in it.

@node files "The Two Types of Files"

   GammaChar 0.9 allows you to save the character as either a text file
or a variable file. The difference between the two is this: A variable
file can be loaded into GammaChar while a text file cannot. But, a
variable file is hard to read for it consists of a group of numbers,
letters and commas in a file. If you want to change this file so that
it can be loaded in, see below.

   -= How to edit variable files =-

   { } means you must provide whatever is inside these brackets
   A variable file consists of the following

"GAM"                                  * This line must be at the top
"{Player Name}","{Character Name}"     * The two names
{Race #}, , , , , , ,{Hit Points},{Physical Mutations},{Mental Mutations}

         ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
         | | | | | |

         1 2 3 4 5 6

  1 - {Mental Strength}
  2 - {Physical Strength}
  3 - {Intelligence}
  4 - {Dexterity}
  5 - {Charisma}
  6 - {Constitution}

The race number is:
       1 for pure strain human
       2 for humanoid
       3 for mutated animal

   An example file would be:

--------------------------------------------

"GAM"
"John Ardistiux","Scie"
2,14,12,16,17,15,10,53,3,2
