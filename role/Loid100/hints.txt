First of all I'd like to mention, I DELIBERATELY made this game VERY hard!
That is, you are NOT going to win and accomplish the quest in one session
of play. Therefore I've added the ability for you to save your character
(NOT THE SEMI-RANDOM LEVEL YOU ARE ON - that would take too much disk
space for BBS use) at any point of play without having to exit the game.
If you die, you can restore from your player with everything he had at the
last save.

Here are some tips to help you out: (YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ THIS!)

-  Find the great monk Abdul, he wanders the dungeon in search of items
   to buy and sell. He ALWAYS has lots of stuff to sell ya!!! Pay attention
   here, I did say 'GREAT MONK' you know what that means right? hmm, okay
   how 'bout if we just call him... grasshoper... hint hint...

-  Mixing potions can cause totally random effects that are good, bad
   indifferent, and sometimes any combinations thereof.

-  Get as good stats as you can when you start cause you can't ever
   get them again.

-  If you are going to play a character who uses magic prepare to die
   often for they are usually just 'geeks' for the first couple of
   levels compared to the more athletic fighter classes.

-  For those AD&D followers who just must know what their experiance
   points are, look at your score its as close to what AD&D calls
   experience for this game.

-  Beware of the wench at Yatamor castle! I Don't know what this means,
   I just felt like typin' it...

-  Some fountains can heal, some can hurt, but all contain some form of
   magical liquid... Hint hint!

-  Some people believe that if you teleport deep in the dungeon fast
   you will get more powerful quicker! I tend to believe you will only die
   quicker, but then what do I know right?

-  There truly is a quest to this game, it is NOT all just random.

-  You can control where you are going to teleport next if you have the
   right crown. When I say crown, I mean it quite singularly cause there is
   only one!

-  Speaking of one, Its been a few weeks since I added the ring of
   regeneration to this game, but if my memory serves me right there is
   only one of those two... and its guarded by a mean group of Trolls... did
   I say Trolls? I didn't mean trolls, that would be really mean, I meant
   something else, something totally different. Then again, if you're only
   playing the demo version, hmm, never mind...

-  Sleep spells have a strange effect on monsters, what I mean is when you
   are put to sleep by them you will wake up whenever they HIT you or
   depending on your stats. However, since monsters are NPCs when they are
   slept they will remain asleap until they are either awaken by your attack,
   or by another wandering monster - in which case they will usually flee.

-  Oh that reminds me, you can wear lots of stuff, however you can only wear
   ONE of each! Just cause you're a human don't imagine yourself as having
   10 fingers for rings, as far as I'm concerned you only got 1 finger left
   (can you guess which?... hehe) Actually, I guess it be more appropriate
   if I explain it this way - All similar types of magical artifacts have a
   tendancy to dangerously and with great devastation counteract one another,
   so, in order to prevent a thermo-nuclear meltdown disaster in a frienly
   place like the Milina dungeons of Irongate you can only wear ONE of any
   item at a time! 'nough said!

-  If you don't have an Identify spell or scroll, fear not, there are many
   Creatures in the dungeon who are smarter that you and they will probably
   be glad to identify your item for the right price... Then again there
   are probably some stupid creatures down there too who will also identify
   the item for you.

-  The riddle of the wench, as well as many other riddles in the quest, can
   be solved by remembering that just because it is, doesn't mean it has to
   be, it really could be, just because - and it many cases it really is.
   And I mean that too!

-  When you're finished playing around with an item, artifact, weapon,
   armor or whatever then DROP IT. Don't try to carry around a bunch of
   stuff you don't need - it will just get in the way! When things break
   they are really hard to fix, you're better off with a light load cause
   you can only carry as much as your strength allows.

-  If you're carrying around 13 or more items the program will automatically
   try to help you organize your stuff and prompt you for the ITEM TYPE
   whenever you do an inventory, or try to identify or drop something. This
   way you don't have to go through screens of items to find the 1 you need.

-  Each character class has a single weapon proficiency which gives the
   player a bonus on attacks. Just check the weapon which the player has
   "in use" immediately after the player creation (to find out what that
   character class type is typically proficient in).

-  Some monsters may be friendlier to you if you have a high charisma.
   In other words, bein' UGLY can be offensive and there is no excuse for
   it! It will provoke more attacks than the norm.

-  You're quest requires you be galant and honorable, after all you are
   demonstrating your courage just by attempting the quest. Therefore,
   the gods will punish you when you flee from a fight (reduce your score)
   if your opponent can understand your tongue then you're better off
   asking him to stop the fight than to flee (that is, in some cases).

-  Typically spell points are regained based on your intelligence or
   wisdom (depending on your class) and they do return much faster when
   all else is healed (your life level is restored). Be aware that spells
   can cause catch-22 situations, ie.. if you have a CURE POISON spell which
   needs 4 spell points but only have 3 and YOU HAVE BEEN poisoned you
   will never regain that extra spell point to cure that poison, and the
   more you rest the quicker you will die... better find someone else to
   heal your wounds or you can try to remember to save a few spell points
   next time you decide you want to get poisoned...

-  Enjoy, and may the forces of good be with you (that is, IF ya sent in
   your $20 bucks, else what do I care?)
