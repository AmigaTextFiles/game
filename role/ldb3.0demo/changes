------------------------------ VERSION 2.0 ----------------------------

- added common item help list ("help" key to activate)
- fixed bug which left prestige out of character summary
- fixed bug in printing of marketplace & guild colors
- added menus
- added proximity search (for characters only)
- removed item count restriction from item files
- restructured string handling and item file handling to allow
  multiple maps from different modules to coexist in one data directory
- added map reports, and report redirection to printer and file
- fixed bug in name search
- added sex, familiar, and special status to (B)urst character entry
- fixed oversight in marketplace items

------------------------------- VERSION 2.1 ----------------------------

- added quick name search for object identification
- fixed fatal bug in location reports, and several other minor bugs
- tightened up ownership, masking, and coat of arms algorithms
- changed coat of arms selection routine to allow pattern searches
- added option to purge characters, locations, guilds, and marketplaces
  from the database
- added global common item change
- fixed fatal bug in item file reader and help list which would bomb if
  the list was too short or had comment lines 
- extended common item ID number range to include "temporary" IDs for
  special statuses, training types, and races with unknown ID numbers
- fixed odd bug in optimizing save routine (algorithm required access
  to ALL objects, even deleted ones).

As a temporary fix, version 2.11 allows herd animal IDs as special
resources. This fix was both easy and necessary, and will be superseded
by a more complete tracking system in version 3.

Version 2.12 fixes a bug introduced in 2.11 - herds would not show up
on a resource search.

----------------------------- VERSION 3.0 ------------------------------

- added GRAPHICS in the form of cool terrain and force icons. Also
  significantly improved the look of the desktop.
- added left mouse button support.  It is a LOT easier to navigate 
  the program now.
- terrain entry has been simplified a great deal (your index finger might
  get tired, though)
- changed "locations" to generic forces
- added 10 other force types, such as fleets, underground castles, lairs,
  ruins, etc.  
- Added dynamic item entry (no more exiting the program to add new items!)
- Added herds to province information (they also have an icon, if there
  is nothing more interesting in the province)
- added 2 'comment lines' to each object (characters, forces, guilds, 
  marketplaces).  These can be anything you like.
- added combat statistics, marks, and titles to characters.
- added ancient arcana research level to magic guilds
- multiple forces are now allowed in any province.
  Only the most 'interesting' icon will show.  The icons are, in order
  of interest, along with a description of the icon:
  Castles (towns with large defenses),
  Cloud Castles,                 (a castle on a cloud :)
  Towns,                         (a couple of houses)
  Underground castles,           (a lump of rock with a door)
  Nomad Camps,                   (a group of tents)
  Lairs,                         (eyes peeking out of a cave)
  Ruins,                         (stonehenge-ish)
  Legions,                       (three helmets and a flag)
  Parties,                       (one plumed helmet)
  Fleets,                        (a boat)
  and the generic "Force"        (a shield with a question mark)
- PARTY - type forces are now allowed inside other non-party type forces.
  This was long overdue, but wasn't very easy to do properly.
- perhaps the biggest change besides the graphics is that the searches
  have been made actually USEFUL!!!! This was accomplished by switching
  to a multiparameter search algorithm - please send me suggestions if
  you think there are other useful parameters I should add to any of the
  searches.  It's not very hard for me to do.
