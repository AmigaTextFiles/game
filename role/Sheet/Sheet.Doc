                    Character Sheet V1.5 by Rembrandt de Witt


INTRODUCTION
------------

This is a character sheet for the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game.
It is adjusted for the following rule extensions:
    Player's Option: Skills & Powers
    Player's Option: Spells & Magic
    Player's Option: Combat & Tactics

The CharGen V1.16 character generator by Troels Poulsen gave me the basis of
this sheet.
