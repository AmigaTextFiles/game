This software is provided as "freeware."  This means that you can use
it without charge, but it is NOT public domain software.  You must
still comply with certain restrictions that the author places upon
its use.  You may use this software without any charge.  You may also
freely share this software with others, as long as you make no
changes to the software and include all the files you received when
giving a copy to someone else.


FREEWARE SOFTWARE LICENSE


    This software is provided under a license agreement and may be used
    only in accordance with the terms and conditions of the license and
    with inclusion of the copyright notice.  This software is the sole
    property of Michael J. Roberts.  No title to or ownership of this
    software is hereby transferred.

    The information contained in this software is subject to change without
    notice and should not be construed as a commitment by the author.

    You are hereby granted permission to use, reproduce, and distribute
    this software subject to all of the following conditions:

    1. You must include this license and the copyright notice with all copies.
    2. You may not require or collect a fee for copies of this software,
       or any part of this software, that you give to other people.
    3. You may not include this software with any other software for which
       a fee is collected.
    4. You may not modify this software in any way, and each copy you make
       and distribute must be a full and complete copy of the software you
       originally received.
    5. Anyone to whom you give a copy of this software receives all of the
       same permissions that you did under this License.

    An exception to the above terms is granted for the TADS Run-time
    executable (the application program, which is part of TADS, that
    allows TADS games to be played).  The TADS Run-time executable may
    be redistributed subject only to the following restrictions: it is
    distributed as part of a game developed with TADS; the game contains
    your own copyright notice; and the TADS run-time executable is not
    modified in any way, and in particular displays its copyright notice.

    In other words, we don't want others to make a profit from selling
    TADS itself, but we want TADS game developers to be able to share or
    sell their games (which necessarily must include the TADS run-time
    executable) in any way they please.

    In addition, you may modify and use the included library files, adv.t
    and std.t, in any way you want, provided that if you redistribute
    modified copies of these files in source form, the copies must
    include the original copyright notice, and must be clearly marked
    as modified from the original version.

    Anyone unable or unwilling to comply with any of the terms and conditions
    of this license must destroy or otherwise discard all copies of this
    software in his or her possession.


NO WARRANTY

    Because this software is distributed as freeware, you assume the entire
    responsibility for determining whether the software fits your needs and
    whether it functions properly.

    Michael J. Roberts and any distributors of this software specifically
    disclaim any and all warranties, expressed or implied, including but
    not limited to implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for
    a particular purpose, with regard to this software.  In no event will
    the author or any distributor of this software be liable to you for
    any damages, including lost profits, lost savings, or other incidental
    or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use
    this software, even if any of these parties has been advised of the
    possibility of such damages, or for any claim by any other party.


ABOUT HIGH ENERGY SOFTWARE
--------------------------

High Energy Software formerly distributed TADS as a shareware system,
but is no longer in business.  Mike Roberts, the developer of TADS,
is now maintaining and distributing the system as freeware.  We have
made an effort to remove references from these files to High Energy
Software and its former telephone and other contact information,
since all of those numbers and addresses are no longer in service.
If we inadvertantly left any such references intact, please disregard
them, since they're oversights.
