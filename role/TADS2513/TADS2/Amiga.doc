TADS 2.5.13 for the Amiga
-------------------------

This file contains Amiga-specific information about the TADS system, version
2.5.13, ported to the Amiga by David Kinder. For general information about
TADS, see the other documentation files included in this package. TADS
consists of 3 parts: the compiler, the debugger and the player. Most games
are distributed as compiled games (files ending in ".gam"), for which only
the player is required. The compiler is used to build compiled games from
their source (files ending in ".t"). You should only need to use the
compiler and debugger for writing your own games. Lots of TADS games can be
found on the Internet at the ftp site ftp.ifarchive.org in the directories

	/if-archive/games/tads
and	/if-archive/games/adventions

The full TADS package for many different machines can be found at the same
site, in

	/if-archive/programming/tads

Kickstart 2.04 or better is required for this version of TADS.

Playing TADS Games
------------------

The player for adventure games created with TADS is called "TADS2 Run-time"
on the Amiga (it is also commonly refered to as "tr" or "TADSr" in document-
ation for other systems). To run a TADS game, double click on the
"TADS2 Run-time" icon, then select the game file (usually ending in ".gam")
with the file requester. The icon can have the following tootypes:

DIR	     This indicates which directory TADS should open the file
	     requester in, e.g.

		 DIR=Cheez:TADSGames/

SWAPDIR      This is the directory to store temporary swap files. The
	     default is T:

SCREENMODE   This indicates the screen mode to be used. The mode
	     should be spelled exactly as it appears in the ScreenMode
	     Workbench preferences program, e.g.

		 SCREENMODE=PAL:High Res Laced

FONT	     This indicates the font name and size to be used, e.g.

		 FONT=Courier/13

WINDOW       If present, the player uses a window on the Workbench
	     screen rather than opening a custom screen.  

The player can also be used from the Shell by giving the game file path as
the first argument, e.g.

	"TADS2 Run-time" Cheez:TADSGames/UU1.gam

Calling the player without any arguments will give a list of all possible
arguments and their function. Note that the player requires more than the
standard stack to run successfully; the stack in the player's icon is set
to 50000, and if the player is run from the Shell then the Shell's stack
should be set to at least as much.

The player has command line editing (cursor left/right, delete and back-
space), a command line history (cursor up/down to go through the previously
entered commands) and a review mode (accessible by pressing F1) in which
text that has scrolled off the display can be recalled.

If the player is run with a "-plain" argument, it only uses standard input
and output, for use in a Shell window or over a network.

Using the TADS compiler and debugger
------------------------------------

The compiler for TADS games is called "tc" (on other systems it is sometimes
refered to as "TADS Compiler" or "TADSc"), and may only be run from the
Shell. The compiler requires more than the default stack: For small games
30000 is enough, but for serious work I would recommend a larger stack (say
100000). There is also a debugger available, called "tdb". For more
information on how to use these tools consult the full TADS manual, which is
available from ftp.ifarchive.org in the directory
