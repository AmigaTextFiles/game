Attention Version 1 Users!
--------------------------

TADS Version 2 is intended to be compatible with games written for v1.
However, there are a few differences.  If you experience any difficulty
compiling a game that was working with v1, try using the "V1 Compatibility
Mode" options.  You can enable full v1 compatibility mode by placing -1
before your game name:

    tc -1 mygame

Most v1 games that have problems with v2 need only rename the new "do"
keyword to run with v2; this can be done with these options:

    tc -1d _do_ mygame


Documentation
-------------

You should download the TADS Documentation archive, TADS2DOC.ZIP on PC's,
or TADS2DOC.SIT on Macintosh.  This file contains overview documentation
for TADS, as well as the source for "Ditch Day Drifter", a complete sample
game.


Getting Started
---------------

To get started on the system, install the executables in a directory on your
path, and install the source files (*.T) wherever you please.  Compile "Ditch
Day Drifter" by typing:

     tc ditch

Be sure that ADV.T is in your current directory.

Note that DITCH.T is part of the separate TADS Documentation archive;
you should be able to get this archive from the same place you got the
archive containing the TADS executables.

After you have compiled Ditch, run the game by typing:

     tr ditch

Please read DITCH.DOC for information on playing the game.  This file also
describes many features of the run-time system, including the parser.


ABOUT HIGH ENERGY SOFTWARE
--------------------------

High Energy Software formerly distributed TADS as a shareware system,
but is no longer in business.  Mike Roberts, the developer of TADS,
is now maintaining and distributing the system as freeware.  We have
made an effort to remove references from these files to High Energy
Software and its former telephone and other contact information,
since all of those numbers and addresses are no longer in service.
If we inadvertantly left any such references intact, please disregard
them, since they're oversights.
