   Following his return from Starbase 13 (TM), Commander Yeno Hou  is called
to Galactic Forces headquarters to recieve his next assignment...

required setup: An Amiga with at least 1Mb. Users with only 1Mb may miss
                out on some of the animation and music.

recommended:    Second drive or (preferably) hard drive, 2Mb ram, 020 
                processor or better.

Software used to create this game:

  Amos Professional V2.00
  Amos Professional Compiler
  Deluxe Paint 3 and 4
  Imagine 2
  Octamed V5

Game controls
-------------

   The screen is divided into two areas, the graphics window and the control
panel. There are seven verb buttons in the control panel:

   Examine
   Operate
   Use
   Take
   Talk
   Shoot
   Switch

   Most of these are self-explanatory. The difference between operate and
use is that operate requires only one item while use requires two, one from
the inventory (that's the list of items in the control panel window) plus
one other. Switch will transfer control from one character to the other when
this is possible.

   Left mouse - move character/operate buttons

   Right mouse - select object/perform action

   Shift+(F1-F10) - save game in one of the ten positions. If playing from 
                    floppy disk you will be prompted to insert a disk called
                    'saves' which you should format and rename in advance.

   F1-F10 - load a previously saved game.

   q - quit

Hints
-----

   * Examine everything. There are clues hidden around.

   * Cooperation between the two characters is often essential.

   * Some of the puzzles have different solutions depending on which
     character you are using.

   * You can't do anything to make the game impossible to complete. However,
     just to keep you on your toes, you can die in some places.

   * Look out for weird solutions. I can't help it, I'm like that.

   One of the puzzles relies on your ability to recognize red and green dots.
I realized after designing it that some people might not be able to see them
on the screen, so just in case, it looks like this:

   R  G  R
   G  R  R
   G  R  G
   G  R  G
