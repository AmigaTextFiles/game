@Node "Intro" "Introduction"

FRCalendra is a small program which keeps track of the date while you are
playing in the Forgotten Realms Campaign setting. 

To make it somwhat faster on slower Amigas I have choosen to use GUI.

You will need an Amiga with OS2.0x or better to run it.

@Node "GUI" "Description..."

All versions of FRCalendra look the same and has the same functions, even if
some of them will not work for the MeBBSNet version when the 'Script Off' is
choosen.

your campaign. At the moment you can choose all those from the 2nd ed campaign
