	* Removed the directory part of the log file name, meaning that
	log file is always written in the user directory.

	* LANGUAGE IMPROVEMENT: Added the more Alan-ish way to specify
        scripts, namely by name (old style, by numbers, are still
        supported, and mixing is allowed).

	* LANGUAGE IMPROVEMENT: Made the MESSAGE construct accept general
	statements.  Unfortunately this also required the removal of the
	positive response checking in confirmation messages.  Note that
	*any* input is now considered a negative response (YES, I will
	look into changing this...)

	* SYSTEM CHANGE: Changed the QUIT statement to ask for RESTART,
        RESTORE or QUIT (like old time InfoCom games). The message QUIT
        can be used to change the contents of the question, but note that
        the RESTART, RESTORE and QUIT words are hardwired into the
        interpreter. The new QUIT function may cause some problems with
        earlier games (and gamers) because the player will probably answer
        the wrong thing when doing a quit (but let's hope if-players can
        read ;-)

	* LANGUAGE IMPROVEMENT: Added a new statement RESTART to restart
 	the current game. It causes a prompt for confirmation (the new
 	REALLY message, which can be changed using the MESSAGE construct,
 	like all the standard messages).

	* DOCUMENTATION: Changed format of the grammar description, now
	using the more clear (?) <xyz> format for non-terminals. Also
	removed all grammar from the reference chapter.

	* SIGNIFICANT LANGUAGE IMPROVEMENT: Reference to objects/actors
	not at the current location allowed! Another special indicator for
	parameters in the syntax construct has been added. In the same way
	as it has been possible to indicate that a parameter can be
	multiple, it is now possible to indicate that the parameter need
	*not* be present to be considered.  Disambiguation between
	multiple objects that matches the words given by the player is
	performed as before (with presence taking precedence). This allows
	much simpler handling of e.g. ASK JOE ABOUT BILL, because we need
	no longer use tricks to make BILL present.

Fri Jul 26 13:48:24 1996  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@rabbit>

	* SIGNIFICANT LANGUAGE IMPROVEMENT: Added general default
	attribute available for all Actors, Objects and Locations: DEFAULT
	ATTRIBUTES. Allows for example verbs like 'examine' to act on both
	actors and objects in a much better way.

Thu May 23 23:42:05 1996  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@rabbit>

	* LANGUAGE IMPROVEMENT: Allowed arbitrary order between
        declaration of initial location and names on actors and objects

	* SIGNIFICANT LANGUAGE IMPROVEMENT: Allowed multiple player names
        on actors and objects.

Tue May 21 13:39:39 1996  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@rabbit>

	* LANGUAGE IMPROVEMENT: Allowed the previously completely reserved
 	words ARTICLE, MESSAGE, QUIT, SAVE and RESTORE to be used as
 	identifiers

	* BUGFIX: Finally allowed "no" prefix for boolean options, as in
        "No Debug", note that the 2.6 version of the manual is wrong

	* BUGFIX: Fixed the unexisting FPU and article problems in the DOS
        port

Wed Apr  3 00:54:24 1996  Thomas Nilsson  <thoni@heffa>

	* INTERPRETER IMPROVEMENT: Added the ',' as an alternate
        conjunction (alternative to 'and') in player input.
