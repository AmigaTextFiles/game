J	COPYING CONDITIONS

The Alan Adventure Development System is now REGISTER-WARE. This means
that for use of the system you are only required to register. This is
done preferably through a simple email, but postal mail will also do,
and is free.

Copies of the documentation and executables can also be received from
the ThoNi&GorFo Adventure Factories, henceforth called The Factories,
through email for free on request. Requesting delivery through email
will automatically register the receiver.

A copy of these conditions must accompany any copy of the Alan System.

J.1	Distribution

The Alan System is mainly distributed through electronic mail. This
distribution is free. Uploads to FTP sites and BBS are allowed,
provided that the distribution package is uploaded in its original
form, and download from there is of course also free.

Physical media, such as disk or tape, may be supported depending on
platform. A requirement is that the requester supplies appropriate
media. The cost for physical media distribution may vary.

J.2	Documentation

The documentation is copyrighted by The Factories. Copying is allowed
provided it is distributed as a whole, or quoted accompanied with
appropriate references.

J.3	Executables

The Alan system contains two executable programs, the compiler Alan
and the interpreter Arun.

Distribution of the interpreter alone or together with game data
produced by the compiler is allowed without restrictions or royalty
claims provided appropriate references and acknowledgment accompanies
the game in documentation or program output. In addition a description
of the game, its plot and major features, and/or the game itself
(preferably in source) should be donated to The Factories. The
Factories agree to any copying or copyright restrictions placed on
such a game.

The compiler may not be used, other than for evaluation or trial
purposes, without registering with The Factories.

Registered users will receive free notification of updates, new
platforms supported, information on commercially or otherwise
released games and other information supplied by other users or The
Factories.


J.4	Registration

Registration is free and preferably made through a simple email
message. Requesting a distribution through email will automatically
register the requestor.

Registration can be done with an email:

To: alan-request@softlab.se
Subject: Alan registration
From: your email adress goes here

REGISTER


J.5	Source

No source will ever be placed in the public domain or otherwise disclosed to 
third parties except for porting to new platforms.


J.6	Examples

The Factories would appreciate any example adventures or solutions to
problems to improve the documentation and user support. However Alan
source marked as an example will be considered not copyrighted and may
or may not be used, as a whole or in part, in the Alan documentation
or distributed in other forms by decision of The Factories.

This will also add to the suite of test data and therefore improve
the quality of future releases as well as allow us to find and
document any incompatibilities. If you also enclose a solution we can
automate the testing even further.  The Factories will not
redistribute your game without your written permission.

J.7	Versions, compatibility and support

The Alan System is versioned using a three level number coding scheme,
indicating version number, release and correction respectively. Major
differences in the language or the introduction of many new features
will be indicated by an increment of the version number. Minor changes
to the language and introduction of features are indicated by an
increment of the release number. Bug fixes will increase the
correction number.

Any adventure files and interpreters having the same version and
release numbers will be compatible. Adventure files are also
compatible across all supported platforms. This includes character
sets, the intent being to correctly present any multinational
character on any system. Thus complete coverage of the supported
platforms from a single developement machine can be achieved.

As the Alan System is a non-profit project user support may vary. To
maximise probability of handling, error reports should be sent to The
Factories (preferably by email) and include source, version of
compiler and interpreter as well as a detailed description of how to
reproduce the error and its symptoms.

Releases and corrections will be issued on irregular intervals.

J.8	Executive Summary

So, in short, the interpreter Arun and any game produced using the
Alan System is yours. You may sell or copy it as you like, and as you
need the interpreter to run the game it may be copied freely too. The
Arun interpreter may also be uploaded on BBS'es or FTP-sites to allow
players to download an interpreter for his platform and use that to
run your game.

The documentation and examples are free to copy or place on any BBS'es
or FTP-sites if their contents are not changed.

To use the Alan compiler you must register.

Distribution on disks or tape may cost depending on the media. A
floppy disc distribution is free, provided you supply the disk (we'll
pay the return postage).

If you create a game using the Alan System we'd like to see it. Send
us a copy (preferably in source) and any documentation or a
description of the game and its novel features.

Short games or samples of Alan source are most welcome as examples
that we might use and distribute to other users. Sending an example
means you waive all rights to it. Examples add to the suite of test
data and thus helps further improve the quality of the system.
