@node "What is it?" "What is it?"
This utility allows the creation of introduction sequences for games written
with the GRAC game-creation system.  It was written in AMOS Pro, and an early
version of the system was used to create the introduction for F1 Software's
"The Experiment".

Why not use GRAC, you ask?  Why plug your own game, you cry?  In answer to the
first question, it makes GRAC programs less unwieldy, and can be edited
separately without fear of destroying your game.  It also is much easier to
use, can be bypassed by the users if they've seen it more than they want to,
and the separate files can be moved to different disks making compiling a
finished version on floppies easier.

In answer to the second question...  F1 Software don't seem to be doing much
advertising at the moment.  No, that's not quite right.  They aren't doing ANY
advertising at the moment, and never have since they evolved from F1
Licenceware.  So, I need to do my own advertising.

@toc "How to use"
The actual executable file is simply a script interpreter.  To create the
introduction, a script is hand-written in a suitable text editor, for example
"ed", supplied with Workbench.  When executed, the IntroCreate program
processes the script, and performs the actions it requires.

The program requires a special version of the GRAC Player program, modified by
Edmund Clay (GRAC's author).  This is included on the disk.

This is a little complicated.  To run the script you need to:

 1.  Copy the script and the IntroCreate program into the same directory.

 2.  Make an icon for the script using your favourite icon editor, ensuring
     you set the icon's type to "Project".

 3.  Set the icon's Default Tool to "IntroCreate" (minus speechmarks).

 4.  Now, simply double-click the script's icon.

@node "Text" "Text"
@toc "Commands"
 - @{b}@{fg shine}txt X Y TEXT T@{ub}@{fg text}

This prints text on the screen.  Only the bottom third of the screen can be
used to display text using this command, as it is designed to add text beneath
a main picture.  To use the full screen, use the fxt command.

X is the x-coordinate, and Y is the y-coordinate of the text.

TEXT is the text to be printed (not in "" marks).

T is the time it will appear on screen (050=1 second). X, Y and T MUST have 3
digits.  If less are needed, use a zero before the number,
   eg. 001
       010
       100

TEXT can be any length, upper or lower case.

Example:
   txt 015 030 The centre falls apart 110



 - @{b}@{fg shine}fxt X Y TEXT T@{ub}@{fg text}

This works in exactly the same way as the txt command, but allows the text to
spread over the whole screen.
@endnode

@node "Fonts" "Fonts"
@toc "Commands"
 - @{b}@{fg shine}fontdir PATH@{ub}@{fg text}

Assigns the Fonts: directory directory to PATH (no "" marks).

Example:
   fontdir SYS:Fonts



 - @{b}@{fg shine}fontname NAME SIZE@{ub}@{fg text}

This sets a font to be used to print text.  NAME is the name of the font, and
SIZE is the size of the font.  SIZE has to have 2 digits.

Example:
   fontname Diamond.font 20
@endnode

@node "Pictures" "Pictures"
@toc "Commands"
 - @{b}@{fg shine}picin PATH@{ub}@{fg text}

This loads a picture.  If no picture is to be loaded, but you wish to remove
remove the cursor and pointer (a blank screen so text alone can be visible),
use the command:

   picin nil

PATH is the complete name and path of the picture (no "" marks).

Example:
   picin Work:Pics/IFF/Dexter.pic



 - @{b}@{fg shine}picout@{ub}@{fg text}

This fades out a picture (text remains untouched).  No arguments are needed.



 - @{b}@{fg shine}fade STATE@{ub}@{fg text}

Turns fading in and out of pictures and text on or off.  If turned off, picin
and picout cause the picture to appear or disappear instantly.

Example:
   fade on
@endnode

@node "Limitations" "Limitations"
The limitations of this package are self-imposed.  The executable is already
big enough without adding hundreds of commands which no-one in their right
mind could want.  Some features which could, but won't, be included, are:

 - Allowing GRAC characters to walk around in the intro.

 - OctaMED modules.

 - Different screen resolutions/sizes.

 - Different colour text.

 - Multi-line text.

There are plenty of others, too.
@endnode

@node "Future" "Future"
Now, you may have read this guide, and looked at the features offered, and if
you are a simpleton you may think that this whole shebang is a bit of a
bargain, coming free and all.  The truth is, the package is rather @{"limited" link "Limitations" 0}.
However, its easy to use and offers a quick solution to adding an introduction
of a technical standard which is in-keeping with the capabilities of GRAC.

Despite these limitations, I have no desire to update the package or release
any other versions; this is your lot.  Based on the number of games that I
have seen reviewed in the various Amiga magazines, very few people have
actually got to grips with GRAC, or bothered doing anything with it.

There is probably little demand for an all-singing, all-dancing GRAC utility.
@endnode

@node "Past" "Past"
This isn't a history of revisions, describing how I removed a bug that stopped
the "Q" key working, or something meaningless like that.  Instead, this is a
short history of why the program was made, and why it's taken at least two
years to get released.  That'll be equally as meaningless, then. Oh, well.

This program originally started life as the introduction to DAS Software's
first GRAC game, "The Experiment".  We were planning on a whole series, until
the Amiga scene was put on life support and F1 Licenceware was taken over.
Steve Bye (then manager of F1) asked us to write a second user disk for GRAC,
because he alleged that the manual was too difficult to understand.  I thought
that I could help both DAS Software and many other GRAC users by adding a few
more features to the intro, and turning it into a stand-alone script language,
compatible with GRAC.

After much messing about with AMOS, I got the thing to do what I asked of it,
not what it felt I should ask, and stuck it on a disk.  And there it stayed.

In the meantime, we had put another user disk together, and sent it to F1, who
denounced it as thoroughly useless.  Morale destroyed, we decided not to
bother again.

Much later, we received a letter from another GRAC user who wanted to write a
sequel to The Experiment.  Quite why he wanted to, I don't know, but I sent
him some of the source files and various utilities, including this Intro
creator.  He wrote back full of praise (though he may just have been after
more source files), and wondered why I hadn't released it.  Basically, I
couldn't be bothered.

Now, though, I'm giving it to every other Amiga user.  All five of you.

@node "Miscellaneous" "Miscellaneous"
@toc "Commands"
 - @{b}@{fg shine}wait TIME@{ub}@{fg text}

Waits for TIME.  TIME is in 50ths of a second.

Example (wait for 3 seconds):
   wait 150



 - @{b}@{fg shine}noquit@{ub}@{fg text}

Stops the user quitting with Ctrl-C.  This should be placed near the top of
the script.



 - @{b}@{fg shine}closewb@{ub}@{fg text}

Closes Workbench.  This should be placed near the top of the script.



 - @{b}@{fg shine}gracplayer NAME@{ub}@{fg text}

This decides the name of the gracplayer revision.  This is optional, so the
program can be used with all versions of the gracplayer.  NAME is the complete
name of the gracplayer.  This has to be placed at the top of the script.

Example (for version 2 of GRAC):
   gracplayer GRACPlayer2



 - @{b}@{fg shine}game NAME@{ub}@{fg text}

This tells the program what your game is called.  Replace NAME with the name
of your GRAC program.  This has to be placed after the gracplayer command.

Example:
   game Experiment.grac2



 - @{b}@{fg shine}checkmouse STATE@{ub}@{fg text}

If STATE is replaced with on, the program checks to see if the user is
pressing a mouse button.  This enables them to skip the introduction
sequence.



 - @{b}@{fg shine}rem REMARK@{ub}@{fg text}

This enables you to annotate your script with remarks.  Any text which has
semi-colon (;) or apostrophy (') in front of it is also ignored by the
program.

Examples:
   rem This text cannot be read by the program.
   ;Nor can this.
   'Or indeed this.



 - @{b}@{fg shine}fin@{ub}@{fg text}
   This ends the program.  It has to be used at the end of a script.
@endnode

@node "Music" "Music"
@toc "Commands"
 - @{b}@{fg shine}st PATH@{ub}@{fg text}

Loads a Sound Tracker module.  PATH is the complete name and path of the
module (no "" marks).

Example:
   st Work:Stracker/Mods/px.bladeswede_remix



 - @{b}@{fg shine}playst BLOCK@{ub}@{fg text}

Plays a Sound Tracker module loaded previously.  BLOCK is the block number to
start from, where 00 is the first block.  BLOCK MUST have 2 digits. Songs can
have a maximum of 34 blocks.

To stop a module, use:
   playst -1

Example:
   playst 02



 - @{b}@{fg shine}filter STATE@{ub}@{fg text}

Turns the Amiga's internal sound filter off or on.  Replace STATE with either
off or on, in lower case.

Example:
   filter off

@node "Adding graphics" "Adding graphics"
@toc "How to use"
Like GRAC, the only graphics format supported is the AMOS Pro compressed IFF
format.  To convert from standard IFF ILBM pictures to this format, a separate
program called "Compress" is included.

When run, this program requests an input file which is loaded and displayed,
then an output filename is requested.  If you choose the same name, the
original picture WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.  There are NO WARNINGS.  Except that
one.  The program then quits.  Sorry, but you'll have to do one picture at a
time, or buy AMOS and write your own compressor.  Or, convert the pictures
with GRAC.  You should be able to figure out a way to do it.

Pictures should be:

 - Lowres.
 - 320*256 or less
 - 32 colours or less.
 - Use the OCS colour palette, not the AGA one; AMOS, GRAC and the
   IntroCreate program only use the A500 palette.  AGA colours will be
   shown only as approximations taken from the A500 palette.
@endnode

@node "Adding music" "Adding music"
@toc "How to use"
The only music format supported is the Sound Tracker standard.  AMOS' OctaMED
support is extremely unstable and limited, and the only OctaMED format
supported by AMOS, MMD0 (OctaMED Pro versions 1-4) is itself unstable.  Some
modules crash any program which attempts to play them other than OctaMED
itself; even the official OctaMED Player suffers from this.

The only other format that could have been supported was the AMOS Pro-specific
format.  Never heard of it?  Exactly.

@{b}@{u}Note@{ub}@{uu}

Due to a bug in AMOS, the original command to play Sound Tracker modules was
bugged and would not allow the starting position to be specified.  Both this
program and GRAC use a extension package which include an altenative Sound
Tracker command set.  Unfortunately, this too is bugged.  Modules can only be
34 blocks long; any extra blocks are not played.

One advantage of using this program is that the intro music does not need to
be part of the "Grac.song" file, therefore increasing the amount of music that
can be played in the game.

@node "Examples" "Examples"
@toc "How to use"
There are a number of example scripts included in the "Examples" drawer (oddly
enough).  To use them, move the example you want to see into the directory

They illustrate how a script should be put together.

All of the examples will return an "Illegal function call" message, because I
have not specified a GRACPlayer, nor a GRAC game.
