@{i}@{fg shine}Introduction to RPGEditor and RPGEngine@{ui}@{fg text}

You have got in your grubby little hands a copy of what I beleive to be the
best Role Playing Game creator for the Amiga (don't quote me on that).  It
has lots and lots of features and creates adventures small enough to hold
several on one floppy disk.  Here is a list of what it can do:

@{fg shine}  Both the Editor and Engine@{fg text}

    @{bg fill}* Have 32 colors available to all the graphics@{bg back}
    @{bg fill}* Use fast memory compression techniques to reduce file sizes@{bg back}
    @{bg fill}  (Pack and RLE)@{bg back}
    @{bg fill}* Have 256 Map Icons, and Maps up to 500x500 squares@{bg back}
    @{bg fill}* Have 256 Objects, with individual pictures and properties@{bg back}
    @{bg fill}* Have Customizable Object Messages with scripting!@{bg back}

@{fg shine}  The Editor@{fg text}

    @{bg fill}* Uses Click Tabs to organize the individual editors in a logical@{bg back}
      @{bg fill}(I sincerely hope!) fashion@{bg back}
    @{bg fill}* Has a neat Starfield Simulator screen saver@{bg back}

@{fg shine}  The Engine@{fg text}

    @{bg fill}* Has title, description, and exiting picture support@{bg back}
    @{bg fill}* Plays a Tracker MOD throughout the adventure@{bg back}
    @{bg fill}* Is very very speedy (always a good thing)@{bg back}
    @{bg fill}* Allows you, within object messages, to:@{bg back}

@{fg fill}      @{bg shine}# Play a CheeseAnim@{bg back}
      @{bg shine}# Show an IFF or SPACK image@{bg back}

@{fg shine}Registering RPGEditor/RPGEngine@{fg text}

@{i}So, you want to give me money for my product?  I have no problem with
that...please do!@{ui}

If you do, I'll give you a real kickbutt Engine:

@{fg shine}  RPGEngine_Fast     (its faster)
    RPGEngine_Fast   (no annoying register message)
      RPGEngine_Fast (it locks up your Amiga when you quit)
    RPGEngine_Fast   (it has a neater Inventory selector)
  RPGEngine_Fast     (its five US bucks)@{fg text}

@{fg fill}You also get CheeseAnim (WOOHOO!)@{fg text}

@{i}And (amazingly) the Fast Engine is smaller than the original memory-wise,
letting you play massively larger adventures!@{ui}

As said above, both are five US dollars (probably pocket change in your
country if not in the US) and you can make that payable to:

Well, you now have in front of you (along with an AmigaGuide window) two
icons--RPGEditor and RPGEngine.  There should also be an icon for the sample
adventure, "TPoSS" (you'll understand).  When you open up RPGEditor, a
window like this comes up (best when view in a monospaced font):

  +-----------------------------------------------------------+
  | ##  Passable /0                                        ## |

  +-------+---------+---------+----------+----------+---------+

The top section is where you select your current Map Icon, Object Image, or
Animation Frame.  Left-Click on it and drag left or right to move through
the objects.  Right-Clicking on it brings you to zero, unless you're at
zero--then, it brings you halfway through the maximum number of images for
the current editor (127 for all but ChrAnim, which is 2).

Along the left are the click tabs for the different editors.  Click on the
editor you wish to use, and the back of the screen will change to the color
of the tab.  It also remember the last mini-editor you were in.  Handy for
using the Clipboard (explained later).

The big area to the right is where the mini-editors display their
information.  These are explained in the appropriate section.

On the bottom are the click tabs for the mini-sections.  Simply click on it
to choose your mini-editor.

@node "MapEdit" "Map Editor     "
@{fg shine}The Map Editor@{fg text}

This is where you edit the map the world is played on.  Currently, your
starting position is (0,0), the top lefthand corner of the map, but this
will soon be rectified.

@{i}  Blocks number 0-127 are passable...the player can walk over them.
  Blocks number 128-255 are impassable...the player cannot walk over them.
  There is no support for invisible impassables yet, but I plan to add
them.
  For an example of these, play Chrono Trigger and walk behind a building.@{ui}

@{fg shine}Map--@{fg text}

This is where you can physically put blocks down and change the size of the
map.  Changing its size erases the current map, but not the icons. The
scroll bars move you around the map.

@{fg shine}BigMap--@{fg text}

For those who can't stand using Map to make their maps, BigMap allows a
larger editing area, at the expense of Width and Height gadgets, or
coordinate displays.

@{fg shine}Icons--@{fg text}

A zoomed picture of the current block.  Click on a color to select it ad
click on the big square to the left of the colors to draw.  Check out the
@{"Clipboard features" alink "Clipboard" 0} here.

@{fg shine}Palette--@{fg text}

The Map file (.CMAP) stores the palette definitions for the entire
adventure. Click on a color to select it, and use the scrollbars (Red,
Green, Blue in order) to adjust the colors.  No spreads, exchanges, or
copies (yet).

@{fg shine}Disk--@{fg text}

Save and load your .CMAP files.  Also give memory information.

  @{"Back to Main" link "Main" 0}
@endnode

@node "ObjEdit" "Object Editor  "
@{fg shine}The Object Editor@{fg text}

This is where you create your objects in your game, both drawing and
defining object properties.

@{fg shine}ZoomDraw--@{fg text}

Same as @{"MapEdit/Icons" link "MapEdit" 0}...a zoomed up picture of the current object.  The
@{"Clipboard" alink "Clipboard" 0} is here, too.

@{fg shine}Properties--@{fg text}

This is the place to customize your objects completely.  It may take a bit
of logic to understand how it works, but its pretty powerful.

Down the window are two lists of object names.  Below that is an object
naming gadget.  After that, you can enter the object's type.  After that, a
place to choose a message type for your object's logic.  Then, two gadgets
for customizing opening and closing messages.

@{i}Now that that's been explained:@{ui}

  When you create your object, you should name it first.
  Then, right-click on those two lists.  The object names will change to
  the current object name.
  Now, here's the hard part.  Once you create a bunch of objects, you need
  to link them together in a (hopefully) logical pattern with these two
  lists.

@{i}    The list on the left are objects that this object wants.
    The list on the right are objects that it will give.@{ui}

  There are several ways these can be set, either being itself or another
  object:

@{fg fill}    OBJECT    SELF@{fg text}

      OBJECT will be added to the Want list, increasing the number of
      objects this object wants--it also flushes the Want list.

@{fg fill}    SELF    OBJECT@{fg text}

      OBJECT will be added to the Give list, and the Want list will be
      flushed.

@{fg fill}    OBJECT  OBJECT@{fg text}

      The first OBJECT is put in the Want list; the second in Give.
      Then, both lists are Flushed.

@{fg fill}    SELF      SELF@{fg text}

      The Give list is flushed.

    Probably a better way to explain this is with an example:

    You have an object named Bill.  He has the following logic:@{fg shine}

    Bill             Flute
    Bill             Sword74
    Bill             Bill
    RayGun23         Bill
    Glass of Beer    Bill
    Video Game       Cellular Phone
    AC Adapter       Scythe36W
    Bill             Bill
    Bill             Bill
    Amiga Mouse      Amiga Hard Drive@{fg text}

    Here is what will happen when you talk with Bill:

@{i}      He will give you the Flute and Sword74, if you don't already have
      them.  This will happen no matter what you have.

      If you have RayGun23, a Glass of Beer, and a Video Game, he will give
      you a Cellular Phone in exchange for those objects.

      Then, if you have an AC Adapter, he will exchange that for a
      Scythe36W.

      A few places are skipped, as Bill is a disappearing character, and
      when a character is a disappearing character and his last bit of
      logic is fulfilled...in this case, when you posses an Amiga
      Mouse and he gives you an Amiga Hard Drive...he will disappear.@{ui}

    Probably the best way to figure this stuff out is to look at an
    existing file and go from there.

@{fg shine}Disk Ops--@{fg text}

  Save and load your .COBJ files

  @{"Back to Main" link "Main" 0}
  @{"The Engine..." link "Engine" 0}
@endnode

@node "ObjLct" "Object Locator "
@{fg shine}The Object Locator@{fg text}

This is where you put down characters and objects on the map.  A bit of
warning:  The Engine will slow down considerably with a lot of objects on
the map.  Keep the number you plop down to about 30 or 40--100 is the max.

@{fg shine}Map--@{fg text}

Choose an object from the top @{"(the Top Section, remember?)" link "Start" 0}.  Then, click on
the map where you want to place it.  If you want to remove all the objects
like the one at the top, right-click on the map.

@{fg shine}Save/Load--@{fg text}

Save (and load!) your .OLCT files.

  @{"Back to Main" link "Main" 0}
@endnode

@node "ChrAnim" "Character Anim "
@{fg shine}The Character Animator@{fg text}

This is probably the final step in creating your adventure...animating the
main character.  This is the only object with animation (right now!), so get
it right!

@{fg shine}Fore, Back, Left, and Right--@{fg text}

These choose the view of the character you wish to edit.  The @{"Top Screen" link "Start" 0} bar
chooses which frame you wish to animate.

I've discovered, after staring at several of the Chrono Trigger characters,
that the animation looks more realistic if there is no "middle-frame". Leave
me to explain this concept  @{b}(WARNING!  Cheesy Ascii Grafx!)@{ub}--

    O    O   O    @{i}If you can't decipher this, there is a frame in the@{ui}
   /#-   #  \#-   @{i}middle where the character's legs and arms...at least@{ui}
   / \   |  / \   @{i}the back ones..are hidden.  This not look good!@{ui}

If you get your hands on a copy of Chrono Trigger, watch how they walk. This
should help explain it a lot better than @{b}cheese Ascii graphic@{ub}s! Especially
look at Marle.  @{fg shine}[drooling]@{fg text}  8^)

@{fg shine}Disk--@{fg text}

Saving and loading your .CANM file

@node "Script" "Script         "
@{fg shine}The Script Editor@{fg text}

At Last!!  You can now put together all the elements of your adventure and
take it for a test drive!  The Engine requires a completely full script in
order to work properly, so @{u}you MUST have all the following filled in@{uu}:

@{i}  Opening IFF Image
  Description Backround IFF Image
  Description @{b}@{ui}ASCII@{i}@{ub} Text File (up to 24 lines long)
  .CMAP File
  .COBJ File
  .OLCT File
  .CANM File
  Sound/Noise/ProTracker Module (played with those wonderful
                                 Amos Track Commands!!)
  Closing IFF Image@{ui}

One missing file, and KAPUT!  There goes the Engine!

@{fg shine}Disk--@{fg text}

Save your Script File (its in @{b}Ascii@{ub}...open it up and figure our how its put
together!)

@node "Engine" "The Engine     "
@{fg shine}The RPGEditor Engine  Version 1.00.Chives@{fg text}

This is your guide to a very powerful engine.  @{b}More powerful than Doom@{ub}. @{i}More
powerful than a John Deere@{ui}.  @{b}@{i}More powerful than even LightWave 4.0.@{ub}@{ui} Why?
@{u}Because it has chive power.@{uu}  @{fg shine}(Just Kidding!)@{fg text}

No, the Engine is a sad attempt at mimicing at least part of the Final
Fantasy I engine, and I hope I did a good job.  We all know the specs.  So
lets get down to the dirty work.

You can start it up at the command line, like so:@{i}

  RPGEngine@{ui}

You can start it up with the name of a script file @{u}(WARNING!  The Engine
searches the CURRENT directory for all the Script files!)@{uu}:

@{i}  RPGEngine World.Script@{ui}

You can start it from Workbench, and even MultiSelect a Script file to use!
But, the best place to start it is a startup disk, as it gobbles memory. @{i}The
Engine uses a cache to store Map Blocks already pasted for faster access.
The more memory, the larger the cache.@{ui}

When you start it up, it'll show you the Intro pic.  Then, it'll overlay the
text in the Description file over the Description picture, picking the
lightest and darkest colors for the overlay.  Then, it'll load the game
files.  Then, the Tracker MOD.  Finally, it'll ask you for your name, and
draw the game map.

@{i}You really should use the joystick for this program,@{ui} but mouse and keyboard
work minimally.  Move in the direction you want to go and run into things
and people to talk to or pick them up.  Push the fire/left mouse/space bar
to get to the inventory.  Scroll through your objects and push fire to use
the current one.  Pull back to exit the inventory.

While in the inventory, push F1 to load a game, F2 to save a game, and F3 to
quit your game.  When you quit, or beat the game, the Closing pic will be
shown, and you're done!

If you want more info on the Engine and how to make it work for you, read
on.  Otherwise, @{"go back home" link "Main" 0}.

@{fg shine}Message Inserts--@{fg text}

You can insert commands into messages!  Just type them into the Opening or
Closing messages.

@{i}  \TXT:Filename\    will print out the @{b}@{ui}ASCII@{i}@{ub} file Filename, just like a
                    regular message (even with inserts!)
  \PAUSE:Seconds\   will pause output for a number of seconds
  \ANIM:Filename\   will play a @{"CheeseAnim" alink "Reg" 0} during the conversation
  \IFF:Filename\    will show an IFF picture during the conversation
  \SPACK:Filename\  will show a SPACK file during the conversation@{ui}

@{fg shine}Beating the Game--@{fg text}

@{"Remember how you make an object disappear?" link "ObjEdit" 0}  Well, to beat the game, object
255 must disappear.  Make it so object 255 disappears somehow and you're a
winner!

@node "Clipboard" "The RPGEditor Clipboard"
@{fg shine}The Clipboard@{fg text}

Who out there has used @{b}Windows@{ub}?  That invention by Bill Gates to lock up IBM
computers left and right?  Well, one good thing came out of it...@{i}the
Clipboard@{ui}.  The Amiga tried to emulate one, but I haven't seen much of it.

RPGEditor has one.  Its the Copy and Paste icons on all the Zoomed Draw
Editors.  Click Copy, and the current image is copied to the Clipboard.  You
can view the Clipboard in the upper-right hand corner.  Click Paste, and the
current image is replaced with the Clipboard image.
