So, you want to become a software
pirate, do you?  Well, what if you
got PAID FOR DOING IT?!?!?

Yes, the first "un-Piratable" game
ever, "The Stopwatch Starter", a huge
RPG of 5 disks and a CD-ROM for the
Senora computer, has the SPA
suspicious.

They want a sharp, witty, experienced
software pirate like yourself to
pirate this game and prove the
company wrong.

As a bit of incentive, they'll pay
you $5000 in gold bars when you do
so!

So, explore the reaches of Tinytown,
get the disks and CD-ROM, and blow
this joint with $5000 in your pocket!
