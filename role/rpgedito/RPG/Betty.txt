Hello %1.  I'm Betty Miller, and I love you.  [Big Hug]

\PAUSE:2\I want to tell you about what's going on in Tinytown since you've
been gone...

The SPA is looking for someone to prove that they can pirate the first
"un-piratable" game ever--"The Stopwatch Starter".  You can call them up at
the phone by the fountain.

\PAUSE:2\You might want to get over to your house.  There's some stuff there
you'll need.  And, remember, your bank account is pretty much unlimited, so
take out as much money as you need to.

\PAUSE:2\The library just got some awesome Internet connections.  You might
be able to find some software on the Net.

\PAUSE:1\Senoraland just opened up.  They're just a hop, skip, and a jump
from your house.  Sandwich Joe's also has a new sandwich out.  You should
check it out.

\PAUSE:1\There are some other features of this village, like Pedro, our
exchange student from Latin America.  He's in the library boning up on his
English.  There's also Jennie, the Game Guru.  She's hangs out in the arcade
most of the time.

\PAUSE:2\I hope I'll see you later, %1. I've got a hug waiting for you!
