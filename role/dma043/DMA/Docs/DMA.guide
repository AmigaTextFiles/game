# REQUIREMENTS

@node requirements "Requirements"
DMA requires :

  - Kick 2.04 at least
      (that's beacause 1.3 is obsolete :) 

  - Patience
      (that's because it's less-than-one version :)

  - Amiga 4000/40 50MHz with Cyberstorm (68060) accelerator, 32M memory
      (not really, just a silly joke *sigh*)

Also  one  is  advised to posess Advanced Dungeons & Dragons ® Roleplaying
System.  (Version at least 1.0 (prefered 2.0))

How-To-Install :

  - Oh, just put DMA icon (or file, if you still prefer Shell than WB :)
    wherever you want and launch it !  Put docs in your docs directory or
    wherever.

  - DMA archive should contains:

    . DMA  (Main proggy)
    . DMA.info  (I would be pleased if you'll send me REAL icon for DMA
                (preferably in MugicWB style, but other may do) :)
    . DMA/Mods/PotionGen  (Potion Generator Module <- should always be here!)
    . DMA/Mods/CharGen    (Char Generator Module <- should always be here!)
    . DMA/Mods/Prefs      (Preferences Edit Module <- should always be here!)
    . DMA/Docs/DMA.guide  (DMA  docs  in  AmigaGuide®  format (you're reading
                                                               this))
    . DMA/Docs/DMA.guide.info (*grin*)
    . DMA/Docs.info
    . DMA/libs/reqtools.library (The best  shared  library  ever  created  by
                             human being ;-[ <-- womphyric grin)

Tested on :

  - A500 68000 Kick 2.04 WB 2.1 .5M Chip 2.5M Slow 85HD
      (created on that junk :)
  - I'm in desperate need of Beta-Testors

# COPYRIGHT

@node copyright "Copyright"
  What's copyright, anyway ? :)

This proggy is GiftWare.

  (If  you  like  it,  send me Amiga 4000/40, HD 1G, 28k Modem, Cyberstorm
68060,  postcard from your city, sack of chips, letter full of stpd jokes,
or  whatever  you  like, @{"blah,blah,blah" link blah} at this @{"addy" link author}.
I especially like letters with ideas and thanx :) of course full of money
(at least 0.40 $ ;-]).

  If stuff you sended me is expensive enuff,  you'll  get  DMA  source.  I
really dunno what for, but seen sth like that in other share proggy ;]
  You'll also receive Registered Version with YoUr NaMe HARDCODED within.
Your name will be also noticed in Docs. First 100 of Registors will get 

                           ---+< SpeCiaL >+---

                     ..... gifts - surprizes ..... :-]

  Also feel free to use  any  ideas/data  from  this sophisticated product
of human mind - but better inform  me  about it first. NEVER EVER erase my
name from credits *growl*

/*
 * If you'll destroy any soft- or hardware using this proggy, you're tuff.
 * And I don't take any responsibility for this, @{"blah,blah,blah" link blah}.

# INFO

@node info "Info"
  Well, Dungeon Master Aid is a program considered to be a help in several
situations  which  may  happen during your play session.  It may help when
your   dices  are  hopelessly  lost  under  the  cupboard,  or  when  your
Greatest-Medieval-Scottish-Songs CD is actually lended, or when you're too
tired  to  think  about  weather.   (The  last one is only when you're not
english man.) It can also do other useless things - see @{" Main Help " link help}.
@endnode

# HELP

@node help "Help"
And here we are !

 MENUS

I didn't know where to put that weird stuff.

 GADGETS

  > List View

  That  one  is not supported yet - I've problems with allocating new nodes
when proggy is running. But, will be fixed soon.

  > Dice module

  Looks fine, right ?  So pick desired combination of dices and roll'em !
If there's sth in 'Custom' gadget, it'll be used instead of MX settings.
Custom dice format is ?d?? , where ? is number of dices to roll, and ?? is
type of dice (from 1 to ???).
  If you'll enter ?d , then you'll get ?d<value from right MX>, and if
  d? , you'll get <value from left MX>d?. Wise, isn't it ? (Thx Eric :)
  Btw, enterig ??? will cause DMA to roll 1d???.
Don't be silly, and don't try to enter junk such as '3v2q45b253BW' *grin*
Clr gadget clears Custom gadget, so tou don't have to do it from keyboard.

  > Clock module

  Works  properly.  Maybe 'About' mode is not fully random, but I'm working
on that. 'About' dithering is currently set to 10%, but as  soon  as  Prefs
will be completed, you'll can set it to whatever you want.

  > Sound Machine
'Sound' plays standard IFF sample. Feel free  to  send  me  your  own  cool
samples :] 'Sound' uses DSound © 1991-1992 by Dave Schreiber. When Prefs'll
be done, you'll can use any of sound players you got.
'Play'  plays  standard ???Tracker module.  Dunno exactly what versions are
supported.   There's a @{"bug" link bugs} - when you choose file other than
module  Amiga  will  die.   I'll  try  to  fix  it  as soon as it's humanly
possible. Also working on depacking powerpacked modules.
(I'm not sure if it would be better to use external  module  player  -  the
one I got isn't really good *sigh* - send me useful player, maybe ? :)
