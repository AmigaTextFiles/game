	Quick Installation (If you don't have an Ixemul environment 
	installed in your system) :

* Notice that due to RAM's diskname containing a space character, 
  decompressing and testing Tintin++ in RAM: can fail. To avoid this,
  put this line into S:STARTUP-SEQUENCE :

                       relabel "Ram Disk:" RamDisk

  This is useful for other apps that don't work correctly when
  there are spaces in pathnames.

	- Put the contents of SYS into the appropiate directories
	- Execute 'gg-startup'
        - Run 'tt'
	
   Hope this is enough. Please download latest ixemul libraries
   before using this program.
