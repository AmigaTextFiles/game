HOW DO I SET THIS LOT UP?-  Make a drawer on your Hard drive anywhere and copy the
                             whole lot over.Include the Fonts drawer and Savegame
                             draw. Done. It will run from CD but you will need a floppy
                             with some space on it and a Drawer called 'Savegame'.

NOTE                        When you play your first game, go into your Cell ( the

                             to Benny then go and see Mr. Big in Cell 1 (opposite).
                             After that go where ever you like.
