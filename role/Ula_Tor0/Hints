                                WARNING!
                                ========

  Reading this file may give away more about the game that you care to know,
so do not read any further until you have either completed the game or given
up altogether (or if you just don't care)!














   Well, you chose to ignore the warning!  Just to show you I'm serious, let
us start with the complete solution for the game.

- Move north twice and climb the tree (If you don't want to type CLIMB TREE,
  U for UP also works).
- Try to take the nest.  Climb down. Feel free to ignore the lapwing, but if
  it annoys you just try to take it (Not necessary to solve the game).
- Pick up the feathers.  The key and  the quirin stone belong to a sidetrack
  and are not necessary to complete your quest.
- Go south and pick up the rocks.  (The reason  I didn't tell you to do that
  the first time you passed them is  that it saves a few  keystrokes to just
  press Return to repeat the first movement order.)
- Go west to  the castle.  Ignore the mynah (Its only purpose is to warn you
  about a couple of things  when you're carrying it, and if you follow these
  instructions you won't need the warnings) and continue  west (press Return
  to repeat the movement).
- Go south to the stairwell.  The next two things you must do can be done in
  any order you want.
- First (or second), go down and take the chains.
- Second (or first), go up and take the rug.
- Back on the ground floor, go west, chain the hobbit and take the map.
- Leave the castle and keep going east until you are lost in the forest.
- Read the map.
- Go south and take the lamp.
- Go north twice, throw the rocks and light the lamp.
- Enter the window and go up.
- Tickle the dragon and enter the temple.
- Take the dauphin and fly (with the rug).
- Go down from the tower and keep going north until you meet the queen.
- Caress yon Rodent for bonus points and decide if you want to play again.
- That's all, folks!

   Other things you can do on the way include the following, which are divi-
ded into three sections: Things you can do on the way that have no effect on
your chance  to win  things that make it impossible to win,  and things that
kill you! (Well, your character at least!)

1) Things to do on the way to victory.
--------------------------------------
I'll start with a few orders that don't do anything, but give responses that
may be amusing:

- TAKE OFF.
- TAKE ON ME.
- LIGHT UP.
- SAY SHAZAM.
- SAY anything else.
- GO JUMP IN THE LAKE.
- GO HANG YOURSELF.
- (CENSORED) someone.
- ATTACK, KILL,  DRINK or EAT  someone/thing. (NOTE: KILL  can be fatal. See
  part 3 for victims to avoid.)
- FIND something.
- And, of course, press F10.

An order that does work all the time  (except in the dark tunnel, where LOOK
or  EXAMINE don't work either) is INVENTORY,  but try to do it several times
with empty  hands (You can do  this by pressing F4 or 1 several times at the
start).

- Enter the throne room and the stable as follows:
  - With the mynah & without the quirin stone.
  - With the quirin stone, never mind the mynah.
  - With neither of the two.
  (In the stable, pay attention to the room description!)
- While  you've got  the mynah anyway, try to bring it to the tunnel, to the
  room the hobbit is in and to the dauphin (For the last hint you must leave
  the mynah  outside the  tunnel while breaking  the window and lighting the
  lamp. Of course you can also put it in the bag of holding...).
- And  while we're  talking about the hobbit, bring him along after chaining
  him (Put him in the bag if you don't want to rechain him every ten moves),
  and when you get to  the  mountain top wait  for him to free himself, take
  the chains and try to put them on the dragon.
- Did I mention  a bag of holding?  It's in  the stable,  and you put things
  into it  by entering  the bag  (either OPEN  or ENTER/GO it)  and dropping
  things before leaving the  bag again  (Remember to chain the hobbit before
  you bag him!).
- There are  two objects which aren't listed when you enter the room they're
  in,  but you  can still  examine them  and try  to take them. They are the
  ghost horse in the stable and the table (that the crystal ball is standing
  on) in  the  court magican's study. And if you get fed up with the lapwing
  following you around everywhere outdoors, just  try to take  it! [Didn't I
  just say that? Well, it bears repeating! :-)]
- The court  magician's  study?  It's entered  through a  secret door in the
  throne  room. You need  the quirin stone to see it and the key to open it.
  Important: You can only go there once.
- While in the study, try to examine  the crystal ball and say the name of a
  place.
- Another place you can only go once is the nursery - as soon as you've been
  through the  tesseract  room once,  all the  doors are changed and you can
  never  go to  the nursery  again. This means that if you're playing to win
  you  must not  enter the  tesseract room  (north of the throne room) until
  you've got the dauphin.
- Climb a tree out in the forest, and anywhere else except under the oak.
- Listen for sounds in the library.
- Listen  to the  dragon before and after you tickle him, and to the dauphin
  after time has exceeded 200 and 400 units.
  [Actually there's  a lot of things to listen to, this file was written be-
  fore a lot of other things...]
- While we're on the subject of  time, try  to finish the quest in less than
  240 (Following the instructions above will do this), less  than 250,  less
  than 500 and more than 500.
- Go to sleep near the hobbit (after chaining him!).
- Keep  asking for  help even  when you don't need it; it doesn't take extra
  time and some of the responses can be amusing.
- Send me $100 (just kidding!).
- Tickle the hobbit.

2) Things to do that spoil your chances to win.
-----------------------------------------------
   These experiments are not fatal in themselves, but the locations involved
can only  be entered through  the tesseract room, which changes the doors so
the nursery becomes inaccessible. [This wasn't  really planned,  the nursery
entrance just happened to be exit 1.]

- Read  the book  in  the bag  and do what it suggests in the  "room full of
  bugs".
- Listen for sounds in the nursery, or go to sleep there.
- Listen for sounds in the bug room.

3) Things to do which kill you or end the game some other way.
--------------------------------------------------------------

- Throw the dauphin.
- Kill SELF, ME, MYSELF or ADVENTURER.
- Sleep in the tree, in the study or in the dark tunnel.
- Sleep  near the hobbit  BEFORE chaining him  (or after he  frees himself),
  near the lamp after it's lit or near the dragon before you tickle it.

That's all, folks!
