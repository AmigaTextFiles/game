   The two frames above contain the text you get to read when you ask for
instructions in "Ula Tor". The following contains some more details.

   First of all,  why the cryptic title "Nedsuw 2:Ula Tor"?  The first part
is supposed to be the name of the game system that I first used in a proto-
type adventure  (which is why this is number 2, see?)  and plan  to use for
other games in the future.  You may  have noticed  that whenever you are in
a place that can be  left in  all possible directions  (lost in the forest,
for instance)  the directions  you can  go are  listed in the  order North-
East-Down-South-Up-West, the initials of which form the cryptic acronym.
   Of course I  didn't just shuffle  the directions  to produce  a (barely)
pronouncable acronym.  The idea  I got  a couple of  years back,  was this:
The  computer really  stores everything  as numbers  anyway. Why not try to
write an  algorithm that  takes the  ASCII value of the first letter in the
command and CALCULATES the direction  the player  wants to move rather than
go through the usual boring loop of "if the command is N then set direction
to 1 etc."? Well, I  came up with  a formula that worked, but it was rather
clumsy, so I later replaced it with one slightly more  elegant (?) which is
used in this program. They both had one thing in common, though:  They both
return  1 for N,  2 for E,  3 for D  and so on.  For the curious who aren't
quite  curious enough to list the program to see the formula  (or only have
the executable), it looks like this:

COMMAND=Abs(COMMAND-10)-3:If COMMAND>3 Then COMMAND=COMMAND/2+1

Previous  to this, the  variable COMMAND had been set to the ASCII code for
the first  letter in  the entered  command minus  64,  which gives 1 for A,
2  for B  and so on  (This variable is used for coarse sorting the commands
in a different part of  the program so that if Command is 10, for instance,
only the  verbs that  start with  H are checked.  If you have ever played a
slow  adventure game  with a hundred  different verbs that checks the whole
list from  the beginning every time you enter a command,  you should appre-
ciate the time saved.  This idea,  by the way,  was taken from a program by
David Lubar of Creative Computing).

   But  enough about  programming - I  was planning  to put  all that  in a
separate  file for  the specially interested  anyway. This file is supposed
to contain some hints and ideas that should be of use to the average player.

   All  (?)  the usual  adventure game  commands  are available - moving in
different  directions,  taking,  dropping and  examining things,  and  some
things  can even  be opened,  entered and read as well. Then there are some
other commands you may find useful, and a few others that work in a special
way because of the screen layout.

BACK: This  takes  you back  in the direction  you came from, and is mostly
      useful  in those  diabolical adventures  that  are  full  of  bending
      corridors  and things  like that.  Ula Tor,  occasionally, is not one
      of  them, but  I have  included  the command  anyway  just to  make a
      point...

[Actually the  command becomes rather useful  whenever  you  stray into the
forest and  get lost!  It isn't really supposed to work this way,  but it's
such a nice bug I decided to leave it in!]

LOOK: In  "ordinary"  adventures  this  repeats  the  whole  description of
      a  place,  which may  come in  handy if the  description you got when
      you  arrived has  scrolled off  the screen.  The special  Nedsuw lay-
      out  (Inspired  by Scott Adams'  windowing)  keeps  the  place  desc-
      ription  on the  screen until  you actually  move,  so  this  command
      will just relist the objects found at your current position.

LISTEN: This  command  puts  the  Nedsuw  system  one  step  ahead of other
        adventure  systems:  The  computer  becomes  not only your eyes and
        hands,  as  some  programmers  like  to  explain  it, but your ears
        as well!  Listening  to  things  may be useful in other adventures;
        here  it  is just used  for amusement (Tolkien fans may find liste-
        ning to the hobbit particularly rewarding!).

HELP: This command  (which can be  entered simply by pressing the Help key)
      is  supposed to  be useful  when  you  get  stuck.  The goblin should
      be  able to  help you  in most  cases, but  if he  doesn't make sense
      feel free to write me. My address is both in the program (source) and
      at the end of this text file.

   To leave the  keyboard alone for a while,  when the program tells you to
"caress yon Rodent",  it's just  a fancy way  of telling  you  to press the
mouse button, and this is only done at the  start of the  program; the rest
of the time all input is done through the keyboard.

   There's  a couple  of commands  that aren't  found in this program. They
are  (in other programs)  called TIME  and SCORE.  The reason  they  aren't
found  in the  Nedsuw system  is that  the time  used and points scored are
continously displayed on the center bar.

   Two  other very useful  commands that  are included  but don't  work yet
are  SAVE and LOAD.  On the Apple  I used a really neat routine that BSAVEs
the actual memory  ranges that contain the variables, which has the advant-
age of  not having to enter all the changeable variables twice.  I have not
found a way to do this on the Amiga, so until someone tells me, you'll have
to complete the game in one session (actually it isn't that hard...).

   On  the Apple  there is  also a secret command which triggers a "Deus ex
Machina" routine  which, after  a ten-second  countdown, fires  up the disk
drive and flips the  screen through different graphic modes (giving the im-
pression that the whole system is crashing) before it stops the drive again
and flips  a coin to  determine whether you  win or lose.  I'm not advanced
enough to do that on the Amiga yet,  so if you trigger this routine somehow
it will just  tell you that  the Deus isn't  in the Machina  yet (Just as a
matter of record, the command is NOT "Deus ex Machina"!).

   There are some commands which are used quite a lot in this kind of game.
To  save you some typing,  I have installed these  commands on the function
keys (using a special input routine) as follows:

F1 - TAKE <object>
F2 - DROP <object>
F3 - INVENTORY
F4 - EXAMINE <object>
F5 - LOOK
F6 - GO <somewhere>
F7 - OPEN <object>
F8 - LISTEN
F9 - SAY <something>

   With  the commands  that don't  take an  object,  the input routine will
also  automatically press  Return for  you. And yes,  I've only listed nine
function keys. I'm not going to tell you about the last one here...

   Another  set of  commands which  are used quite  a lot  are the ones for
moving around, so I have put them on the numeric keypad. (Sorry, 600 users,
but it's time you upgraded anyway!) The even numbers move  in the four com-
pass directions, and "PgUp" and "PgDn" move vertically.  That left a couple
of keys  unused,  so I put  Inventory on 1  and Look on 7 for good measure.
[The rationale  behind this  is something  to the  effect that 1 and 7 look
like I and L upside down!]

   By the way, you can also save some keystrokes by just entering the first
three letters  of each word,  e.g. EXA ROC to examine the rocks. And if you
want to  enter the  same command  more than  once,  e.g.  when moving  in a
straight line, you can repeat the last order just by pressing Return.

   From one  thing to  another, if you  try  something  that  would require
inhuman  strength,  the program will ask "Who do you think you are? Supper-
man?".  Just for  the record, that spelling is intentional - it's a kind of
pun,  you see,  so don't "correct" it.  Actually I don't want you to change
anything at  all, at  least not distribute altered versions of the program.
You are  hereby granted  permission to  circulate UNALTERED copies  of this
program and the  accompanying text files,  on the condition that everything
is included. [Sound a bit stupid to say that in a text file  accompanying a
compiled executable, but someone may be desparate enough to disassemble the
code or perhaps alter it in simpler ways I'm not going to suggest here...]

   There  should be one or two more text  files included here. One contains
hints for things  you may want to try after completing the game,  the other
(which for obvious  reasons will only be  distributed with the source code)
has some hints for creative programmers who want to write  their own Nedsuw
adventures. WARNING: Both of these files give away quite a lot of the plot,
so don't read them until you have finished the game on your own!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   To this date, the Nedsuw "series" consists of the following adventures:

NEDSUW 1
--------
   This  was an early "prototype" written on the Apple. It was never really
finished, still contains bugs and will not be converted for the Amiga  (Not
as long  as I've got  anything to say  about it!). For your information, it
didn't  even have  a theme  or a way  to win, it  was just a hodge-podge of
disjointed  ideas ranging  from "101 Dalmatians" to "The Wall"  (One of the
locations  was  "outside the  mad bugger's wall",  and you had to bang your
head  against the wall to get through...). I may use some of the ideas from
it in a later adventure.

ULA TOR (NEDSUW 2)
------------------
   The  first  "New Nedsuw"  adventure, in which your task is to rescue the
young  dauphin  from  the  vile  dragon of  Ula Tor (which is the name of a
mountain).  Occasionally,  the name  of the mountain came into being when I
started  thinking  about this  kind of program as "reality emulators". It's
a bit  tricky to  explain how I  got rid of the "em" and realised that what
was  left could  be a  name... This is the first (and probably only) adven-
ture that is (and will be) available both for Apple ][ and Amiga.

12 DAYS OF CHRISTMAS (NEDSUW 3)
-------------------------------
   On the twelfth day of Christmas my true love sent to me: Twelve drummers
drumming,  eleven pipers piping,  ten lords a-leaping, nine ladies dancing,
eight maids  a-milking,  seven swans a-swimming,  six geese a-laying,  five
gold rings,  four calling birds,  three French hens, two turtle doves and a
partridge  in a pear tree.  (Whew!) And in this game,  YOUR true  love  has
challenged you to bring her  all these gifts  within twelve days, or she'll
never want to see you again.  This program is not yet finished, even though
I've got everything planned. I started writing it on the Apple, but it soon
grew too big for 48K. Even though I've invented a way to insert subroutines
into a running program and  discarding them again  (effect similar to CHAIN
MERGE in  Amiga Basic)  I don't think I'll finish it,  as the ][ is getting
rather outdated  and there  isn't even  very much  demand for public domain
games  for it  any longer.  But if  you're patient,  the Amiga  version may
appear in a year or two.
[This was originally written in 1990,  and I haven't even finished the Amos
version of #2, so don't hold your breath!]

CHRISTMAS RUSH (NEDSUW 4?)
--------------------------
  Might as well include this too. This is a game I got the idea for a while
back  (partly inspired  by a friend's suggestions) and seem to have planned
the entire plot  for, but  haven't yet  started programming on either of my
computers,  so you'll  have to  wait even longer for this one. This game is
supposed to cast you as a newly divorced parent (it starts with asking what
sex you are) getting ready for his/her first Christmas alone with the kids.
Everything is ready, with one significant exception: You haven't bought any
presents yet.  And it soon turns out that everything can't be bought either
- your oldest son, for instance,  is a computernik who only wants one thing
for Christmas: A copy of the brand new game Christmas Rush!

NEDSUW 5, 6, 7 etc.
-------------------
   These could be YOUR games. What are you waiting for?  Read the file with
info and hints for programmers, and get on the ball!
