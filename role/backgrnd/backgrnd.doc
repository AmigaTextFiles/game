The random background generator for fantasy roleplaying games
by Aron Postma.

Introduction

Ever had to make a character for a RPG campaign, but couldn't think
of one? This program is all that you need to generate a background
for the character, all you have to do is convert the information to
the desired game-system.

Requirements

A computer. Needed to use the program.
A RPG-system (recommended). Needed to use the character.
Imagination (recommended). Needed to fill the gaps and convert the
character.
Common Sense (recommended). Needed to determine what parts of the
background are usefull in the campaign, and what parts are not.

Usage

Simply type `backgrnd' in the CLI to generate a new character.

The program generates a lot of information about the character like
race, gender, age, height, weight and more.

With the help of the GM, convert this information to a suitable
character for the game system and the campaign set by the GM.

If too many parts of the background contradict with the campaign,
generate a new character. For example, if it generates an orc, and
there are no orcs in the campaign, generate a new character.
Likewise, if the character is female, and all characters should be
male, generate a new character.

To keep things fair, the GM may allow each player to generate several
characters, and choose which one he/she wants to play. It is no fun
if three people get to play elven rangers and the fourth a goblin
prostitute.

The output

Here is a typical background as generated by the program:

These lines introduce the program and show the date and version of
the program.

>You were born to be a female elf, in a world of darkness, where
>everyone feared for there life.

This line shows your gender, race and the background of the place
you were born.

Don't change any part of this line, because too many things depend
on them.

are at it.

born in a world of peace and quiet than one torn by war.

History.

2.87 - 04/06/2000

First released version.

Unfortunately, I don't have information about the earlier version
because of harddisk crashes, and lack of interest in writing up
the changes instead of working on the new version. I'll try to do
so in the future though.

Known bugs.

Sometimes, the program shows that something has happened to a number
of your brothers, but not to how many.
After examining the code, I still can't figure out why it does this.
Theoratically, when it reaches the part where it prints "when you were
AGE, XXX of your brothers" etcetera, it must print the number as well,
but it doesn't.

The words are cut off at the end of lines, but continue on the next
line. This happens when the program tells the computer to display
text, and it does not fit on the end of the line. Instead, it puts
the remaining text on the next line.
I can't be bothered to even find out how to prevent this, since this
would mean locking the program to a certain resolution/font size, and
because some words are made up of two or three parts anyway.

The program sometimes generates a line twice.
