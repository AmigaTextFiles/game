"THRALLBOUND"   © 1992 Pantheon Softworks. Freeware.
















"Thrallbound" is an interactive short-story, written by Torgeir 
Dingsøyr, Tor-Martin Tveit and Christian Fiott for Pantheon Softworks. 

The game may be freely copied as long as you don`t make any profit by
selling it. It was designed for fun, not for commercial reasons! If you
enjoy playing our game, we would very much like to hear from you. We
would also like to hear from anyone, who might have comments, suggestions,
bug-reports etc. 

All input in Thrallbound should be in lowercase. This game is easy !
If you are a novice adventurer, you will probably not spend more than a
couple of hours to complete it. If you are a skilled adventurer, you should
be able to complete it within half an hour. Since this game is so easy, you
can not save the game postition to continue later.

Unfortunately (or fortunately?) for those of you with only 512kB RAM, 
you will not have enough memory to play the game with graphics (which 
takes more than 450kB). You will, however, get all the other 
functions. All the graphics are loaded in before you start the game, 
to avoid loading during the game (which would have slowed the game 
down considerably). If you get a 'Not enought memory for graphics' 
request when you have 1mB, try to close all other tasks and free all 
the memory you can, if you still can not get any graphics, reboot the 
game. (Thrallbound requires 4 big 100kB chunks of memory, and if you 
have executed a lot of programs before running Thrallbound, it may be 
that there are not enough big chunks).


About the parser.

The parser for this game is extremely simple. The parser will, none 
the less, understand quite a lot of synonyms. You can for instance 
type 'WALK NORTH', 'GO NORTH', 'MIGRATE TO THE NORTH' or simply 'N'. 
The parser will not understand complex sentences like 'TAKE THE HAT 
AND THE SHOE' (If you type in that sentence, you would only get the 
hat). You can only take one step at a time. Nor can you type several 
sentences separated by 'THEN' or a period. When the program 
understands the first part of a sentence, the rest is ignored. For 
example, you can type 'GET THE HAT, THEN SHOVE IT UP THE TREE', and 
you would only take the hat.


The menu.

The game is really not fit for using menus, but we added the menu to 
satisfy the hardcore intuition mouse-addicted players. You can use 
shortcuts for most of the functions available in the menu.


Some useful words from the game's vocabulary:

north (or n)
south (or s)
west (or w)
east (or e)
up (or u)
take
drop
go
give
eat
drink
swim
look
examine (or l)
sacrifice
praise
kill
open
close
unlock
lock
listen
colour - changes the background and text colours.
exits - displays the possible exits from the current location.
inventory - shows you the things you are carrying.
shortcuts - gives you a list of the shortcuts available.
vocabulary - displays some useful words from the game's vocabulary.

Like in all other adventure games, it might be wise to make a map of 
the locations. You will have a time limit to complete the game within. 


Some hard facts:

In this game, there are over 30 locations, 30 pictures, which are 
sized 304*100 pixels in 16 colours. The parser understands at least 
370 verbs. The game is written in assembly code, using DevPac 2 & 3, and 
the pure code for this game takes more than 60kB.

Although it is not in our intention to cause any damage whatsoever, Pantheon
Softworks will not be held responsible for any damages which might be caused
by the malfunctioning of this program.

We would be very happy to hear what you think of this game. (So that we
know what to do the next time we make one.) If you send us some comments
on the sheet below, you will also be on our mailing list, and receive
news, if we decide to launch some other products.
