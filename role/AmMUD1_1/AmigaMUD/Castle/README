To run this castle demo, you need file "tiles.iff" in your AmigaMUD:
Images directory (it should be there unless you moved or deleted it).
Then, run MUDServ in this "Castle" directory, instead of in the normal
"Game" directory. Then, run MUD for a local connection, and explore
the castle.

P.S. I actually built this castle with Lego bricks, so it makes sense
physically. I'm still trying to figure out how to merge it with the
standard scenario.
