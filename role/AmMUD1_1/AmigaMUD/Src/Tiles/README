To try out this little tiles example, create an empty AmigaMUD database
using MUDCre, and start MUDServ on it. Then, run the full "MUD" client
program, in low-res custom-screen mode. Log in as "SysAdmin" with the
default "SysAdminPassword" password and enter:

    source amigamud:src/tiles/tiles.m

and, when it is done, to display the simple tile view, enter:

    drawTiles()$

When you are done marvelling at the glory of the image, enter:

    ShutDown(true)$

to make the server ready to exit, then:

    bye

to shutdown MUD, and hence the server (you were the only client).

The difference between this tiny example and the larger "castle"
example, is that here we actually use the tile facility of the system,
so that the definition of the tiles is sent to the client from the
server and cached in the client. The "castle" example does not
actually use the tiles facility; instead it uses the builtin
"GShowImagePixels" to display rectangular tiles from the "tiles.iff"
file which must be available on the client machine.
