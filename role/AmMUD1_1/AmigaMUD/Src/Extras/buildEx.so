This is a small ice-cream parlour in the park. It serves several flavours of
ice-cream, along with hot dogs and candy bars. The service counter is along
the west wall, and includes the ice-cream freezers and covered racks for the
candy bars. There are a half-dozen red metal tables in the front part of the
parlour. Each table has four matching chairs. The door out is to the east.

The chairs are as simple as the tables. They have a solid metal seat and a
mesh metal back, all held in place by curved tubes, which also form the legs.
