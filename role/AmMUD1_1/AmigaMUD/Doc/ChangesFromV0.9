MUD:

    - the 'Show Caches' menu entry now also shows the cached tiles

    - made the 'can't find tile' message print the correct tile number

    - added support for "MUDEDITOR" environment variable

    - added '-s' CLI flag and "EDITORSTACK" icon tooltype

    - bring screens to front if receive ^F signal

    - change icon code to use graphics.library blitter calls instead
	of reading/writing the bitmaps directly. This will likely slow
	down icon operations on basic 68000 machines, but should also
	make MUD more compatible with graphics boards.

    - added some verbose messages on startup, so that first-time MUD
	users have some positive feedback.

    - added Log Mode menu item and corresponding functionality

    - made the "GetString" code not set 'ok' to false if the user
	enters an empty string. That way scenario code can allow the
	explicit deletion of strings that way.

    - changed colour #26 from 0xf1f (magenta) to 0xf99 (flesh)

    - fixed a bug in the file cache code

    - fixed a minor bug in the sound playing code - it was opening
	"audio.device" repeatedly

    - increased the serial transmit/receive timeouts for data transfers -
	they were too short at 300 bps for the 'streets' effects. (As
	if anyone still uses 300 baud!)


SMUD:

    - added support for "MUDEDITOR" environment variable

    - added '-s' CLI flag


MUDServ, mud.library:

    - added the '~' (bitwise negation) operator (I don't know why I left
	it out in the first place - I needed it for the castle/tile
	code)

    - made MUDServ refuse to run if it detects an improperly flushed
	database

    - made 'ThingCharacter' work for inactive characters as well as
	active ones

    - fixed pretty-printing to indent properly when a continued line
	starts with a string constant

    - sped up the AmigaMUD programming language in the cases of passing
	a string constant or local variable to a builtin function

    - switched to ^E to abort execution, instead of ^F

    - added '-E' CLI flag and "IGNORECTRLE" tooltype

    - added '-M' CLI flag

    - the 'DestroyCharacter' builtin now does very little - it only
	removes the character from the 'Characters' table. Doing any
	more than that leaves dangling "owner" pointers in the database.
	Note that this change makes the database format of V1.0
	incompatible with V0.9 - DO NOT TRY TO USE A V0.9 DATABASE WITH
	THE NEW V1.0 MUDSERV.

    - giving MUDServ a small memory limit didn't work when it was
	compiling the scenario - it would use nearly 2 Meg regardless
	of the limit given. This memory limiting now works as it should,
	but it will slow down MUDServ considerably.

    - turned off some internal consistency checks in both MUDServ and
	mud.library. This gives a noticeable speed increase.

    - fixed a wierd problem that very occasionally cancelled a character
	'After' action when it shouldn't have.

    - fixed a tiny memory leak - the contents of a 'note' statement were
	not freed when an in-memory copy of a proc was freed.

    - fixed a rare problem that occurred only when MUDServ was forced to
	run with a very small cache and very little memory.

    - fixed small internal memory leaks in CreateTable and CreateGrammar

    - fixed an internal memory leak when adding string properties
	to things

    - fixed a small internal memory leak in Say and Pose

    - added 'SetParent' builtin

    - added the MUDServ message window, and the -Q/QUIET options to
	suppress it

    - append a '/' to the database path if it doesn't end in ':' or '/'

    - small changes to parsing, so that having both Verb0 and Verb1 with
	the same verb and separator word now works better.


MUDAgent:

    - added the '-l' flag to log a bit of information

    - switched to ^E to abort run, instead of ^F

    - added the '-E' flag and "IGNORECTRLE" tooltype to ignore ^E signals

    - made MUDAgent allow the full international character set when in
	text mode.

    - fixed a small memory stomping bug

    - increased the data timeouts, as in MUD


Scenario:

    - *lots* of cleanup

    - split util.m into util1.m and util2.m

    - used the 'replace' command to allow forward referencing of MUD
	functions, rather than storing a pointer to them in a thing

    - added the 'backup' command for the administrator to use to do
	one-shot or time scheduled safe backups of the database

    - got rid of the nested idle handlers - replaced them with a list
	of them, which is executed when a character goes idle

    - added the concept of a "reset handler". These can be registered
	with the TimeKeeper machine, so that they are executed when the
	MUD is restarted. The main use of these is to reset areas and
	characters left in an undesireable state in a backup taken when
	the system is running. These reset handlers do things like
	removing any character from SysAdmin's Office.

    - used the list of "active handlers", triggered when the character
	logs in, to do similar cleanup of the character required because
	the system is running from a backup made when the character was
	in the middle of doing something. Some of these handlers inform
	the character of what has happened (in others it is just an
	internal state-change that the user won't notice).

    - allow many verbs to operate better when the object is not directly
	present, but is for sale in a store

    - allow "look in" for things other than normal containers

    - add verbs "lock" and "empty"

    - improve handling of positions (stand in, sit on, etc.)

    - change the way monster names are output in many circumstances

    - add birds to the park

    - fixed check on PlayPen to not let any machines in

    - changed the way the "random" build-action conditional works

    - fixed a bug which caused the doors room to crash sometimes

    - use the new functionality of GetString to allow the user to
	delete lots of strings in the button-build code

    - add the use of images for directions, on characters, and on objects

    - allow the setting of images via the button-build code

    - renamed colour "magenta" to colour "flesh"

    - added routine "CancelAllDoAfters" and used it when dropping something
	in the Garbage Room. Don't want torches, lamps, etc. doing things
	after they have been destroyed.

    - added "colours" command to point to the colour-related commands


MUDShut, MUDFlush

    - complain if cannot find MUDServ message port
