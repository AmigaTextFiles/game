		    The 'MUD' Client Program

The MUD client program (the file called "MUD") is used to connect to
an AmigaMUD server, either locally on the same machine as the server,
or remotely through a direct serial port or modem connection or via a
TCP/IP internet connection. The operation of the program is the same
in all cases, although some details of starting it up vary. This
client program must be used in order to get graphics and audio output
and to use mouse and keypad input. This is the recommended interface
for use with AmigaMUD, although a remote user can operate in a simple
text-only mode using just a terminal program or a telnet program in
the case of an internet connection.

The display that MUD produces depends on how it is configured. The
default display uses two Amiga screens. The upper screen is for
graphics, and is 320 pixels across by 100 pixels high by 32 colours.
The lower screen is used for text, and is roughly 640 pixels across by
100 pixels high by 4 colours. The text window has a scrollbar for
viewing output history, and supports input history and line editing.
Hires mode doubles both sizes of the graphics window and the vertical
size of the text window. Onescreen mode puts both areas as windows on
a single screen. Onewindow mode puts both areas as regions within a
single window on the Workbench. Twowindow mode uses two Workbench
windows, one for text and one for graphics. In Workbench modes, the
text area is sizeable. See the "Display" section for more details.

The bottom line of the text window is the input area. Output text
lines appear on the line above this one, thus any partial input lines
are not disturbed by output from other events taking place in the MUD.
Input line editing and history retrieval is done in this line and will
be described later. When RETURN is pressed, the current input line is
sent to the server, and is echoed (along with the current prompt) in
the output area. Note that the position of the command in the output
area does not necessarily correspond to the point at which the server
will process it, since the server may not get around to it for a
while, and because the server may already have generated other output
that hasn't arrived yet.

MUD can be started either from the Workbench or from a CLI. All of the
tool type values that can be put in the Workbench icon can also be
given on a CLI command line. Additional, shorter, forms for many of
the flags can also be used from a CLI. By default, MUD will attempt to
make a connection to a server running on the local machine.

NOTE: in order to run MUD, either locally or remotely, there must be a
copy of "mud.library" in your LIBS: directory.

NOTE: MUD requires a stack of at least 10000 bytes. It will exit right
away if the stack is not at least that large. If you are running MUD
from a shell, use the 'Stack' command (perhaps in your shell-startup)
to set a sufficient stack size. If you are running MUD from the
Workbench, use the "Icons"/"Information" Workbench menu item to set
the stack size on the MUD icon to at least 10000.

MUD is able to call up an external editor to edit strings (such as
character and room descriptions) and procs (AmigaMUD procedures). What
program to run as the editor can be controlled by setting the
"MUDEditor" environment variable to the full path to the editor to
use. If the variable is not set, variable "EDITOR" (also used by other
software) is checked, and if that is not set, "Ed" is used. The editor
used must accept the name of the text file to edit on the CLI command
line, and must be a able to edit and write a simple text file. MUD
does not understand text processor or word processor documents. The
editor must not "auto detach", since that causes the edit process to
terminate prematurely from MUD's point of view. Many users will prefer
to just use the simple editor built-in to the MUD program.

If an external editor is used, the AmigaDOS process created for it
will by default have a stack size of 9996 bytes. If you wish to use
more or less bytes, you can use the '-s' CLI flag, or the
"EDITORSTACK" icon tooltype, to specify a different size. MUD will
enforce a minimum size of 4096 bytes.

The MUD client program can display background pictures and brush
images loaded from the machine it is running on. It can also play
sound samples, and, in the future, will be able to play SMUS (and
perhaps CMUS) music. A single assign or volume name of "AmigaMUD:"
must be present when MUD is started. It does not need to contain
anything, but if it does, it should be arranged into the following
subdirectories:

    BackGrounds: background images (fill the graphics area)
    Images: images of various sizes (often fill half the graphics)
    Brushes: smaller brush images with a mask plane or with a
	transparent colour specified
    Sounds: IFF 8SVX sound samples
    Music: IFF SMUS music scores
    Instruments: IFF 8SVX instruments

The text window in MUD has a close box. Clicking on this box will
start an exit sequence, which will normally result in MUD exiting.
This can also be done with a menu selection. If MUD is started from a
shell, using the 'Break' command on its process will also cause it to
exit. If MUD refuses to exit for some reason (such as the server
having been aborted, or the serial connection being lost), then MUD
can be exited with the Abort menu item. Note that you should not abort
unless absolutely necessary, since this can confuse the server if it
is still active. In particular, manual intervention on the server will
be required before you can log in again.

Following sections of this document will cover the CLI command line
and icon tool type flags in more detail. Others will cover the use of
the menus in MUD and the use of the internal editor. After that will
be a discussion of the the various types of caching done by the
program.


Using MUD to Connect to an AmigaMUD Server

When connecting to a server running on the same machine as MUD, the
connection is direct and immediate. The prompt to enter a character
name will appear right away, and the text window will be used only for
MUD input and output.

When connecting via a TCP/IP stack, the stack should be active before
you start the MUD program. The name of the machine running the server
(or its IP address) must be given, either on a CLI command line or via
an icon tooltype. The TCP port number can also be given if it is
different from the default 6667. Nothing else need be done with this
kind of connection - status messages will be displayed in the text
window as needed. Note: this MUD client program is *not* a suitable
client for use with any MUD servers other than the AmigaMUD server.
The connection to the server goes through an agent program, MUDBinary,
on the server machine, but the client is not affected by this.

When connecting via a serial port (with or without a modem), the text
window will initially play the role of a very simple terminal program.
This mode has no emulations, does not support any escape sequences,
etc. You can, however, use the logging facility to do the equivalent
of "ASCII capture". The "Serial" menu can also be used to change the
CD (Carrier Detect) status, change the connection speed, and generate
BREAK conditions. When in this "terminal mode", characters typed are
not locally echoed (full duplex), and no special processing or
translation is done on sent or received carriage return or linefeed
characters. This mode will attempt to ignore any ANSI escape sequences
that it sees, however.

When serially connected, the MUD program on the remote machine uses a
reliable bidirectional binary protocol to talk to a copy of the
"MUDAgent" program running on the server machine. This means that
information (messages) can be sent in both directions at the same
time, and that messages are not limited to printable characters. Also,
the programs will automatically retry messages that are not
acknowledged by the other end, or are corrupted during transmission.

This protocol operates quite differently from the simple "terminal
mode", so the programs must recognize and agree on when they switch to
the protocol. Normally, the MUDAgent on the server will attempt to
enter the protocol as soon as it is started up (e.g. as a result of a
menu option entered on a BBS). When the local MUD program recognizes
the special sequence sent out, it will display "REMOTE END DETECTED"
and switch into the protocol mode. If this message is not seen when
expected, then something is wrong in the connection. You may see the
data lights on a modem blink at one-second intervals - this is the
remote end resending its startup characters. If, however, the remote
end is setup to allow either a full binary or a text-only connection,
then it will not try to start the protocol until it sees a request.
In that case, you must use the 'Serial/Connect' menu item to start the
protocol from your end. If you don't know how the other end is set up,
just wait a few seconds to see if MUD connects automatically. If it
doesn't, then force the connection.

Because of the binary protocol, a serial connection for MUD must be an
8-bit no-parity connection. Other modes will not work, and will most
likely result in either a failure to connect, or a hung connection. In
that case, you must disconnect by exiting MUD, and try again with a
proper connection.

In the serial case, that of using MUD to connect via modem to an
AmigaMUD server running elsewhere, the sequence of operations goes
something like this:

    - start MUD, possibly specifying options to change the baud rate,
	use a different serial port, etc.

    - using MUD as a terminal program, dial the remote Amiga and log
	on to it as normal.

    - do any further operations with the remote system as needed, such
	as using BBS menus to get to an AmigaMUD selection.

    - instruct the remote system to run MUDAgent (e.g. select the
	appropriate BBS menu item).

    - you should see some modem activity, followed by the "REMOTE END
	DETECTED" message, then some more modem activity, and the
	prompt to enter a character name.

    - enter your character name and start playing AmigaMUD

The MUDAgent program is able to monitor a serial port and make
connections itself. If the host machine is operating this way, then
when the initial modem connection is made, MUDAgent will immediately
connect with your MUD client. MUDAgent can also be started by the
"Getty" program, in which case you will see a "login:" prompt when you
connect. At that point, enter the "userid" that is used on that system
to get to AmigaMUD. You may have to enter a password other than your
character password to get into AmigaMUD.

AmigaMUD also supports simple text-only connections. If you connect to
one of these by, e.g. using the wrong BBS menu selection, then your
MUD client and the MUDAgent program will not enter into the reliable
protocol. You will not see the "REMOTE END DETECTED" message and will
not get graphics/sound output and will not be able to use the normal
features of the MUD program; instead, you will only have the "terminal
mode" capabilities. Unless you will only be on the MUD for a short
period, it is best if you disconnect and reconnect properly.

The MUD program supports Christopher Wichura's OwnDevUnit library for
sharing of serial ports. This should be all automatic. If you are
running something like 'Getty' or 'MUDAgent' to answer incoming calls,
then MUD will request the port from that other program, and will fail
to start up if that program does not release the port. If your system
does not run OwnDevUnit.library, then this paragraph does not apply
and can be ignored.

The MUD client program does not actually exit when you leave the
scenario if you are connecting serially. Instead, it goes back into
its "terminal mode", allowing you to do more connections in the one
session. Note that it does NOT flush its cache of effects, so if you
next connect to a different AmigaMUD, you should select the
"Options/Effects/Zap Effects" menu item to empty the effects cache,
since a given effect identifier is unlikely to mean the same thing on
another AmigaMUD. If both AmigaMUD's are running the bare standard
scenario, you are probably safe, however.


Display

The display types supported by MUD are influenced by the version of
the OS that you are running, and the Amiga hardware you are running
on. For example, systems running pre-2.0 versions of the OS will only
get an "oldstyle" display. Non-AGA systems (i.e. not A1200 or A4000)
can only get the lo-res "basic" display or the "Workbench" display.
Note that the Amiga OS will happily attempt to open screens of
unsupported types, and nothing serious goes wrong - you just won't see
all of the colours you expect. For example, on my V1.3 A1000, trying
to open a hi-res basic display simply produces a graphics screen on
which only colour 0 is ever displayed. On my A3000, the same request
gets a screen in which only half of the colours are displayed. It can
also be dangerous to run with the maximum number of colours that your
Amiga will display when in a Workbench type - this can affect the
Amiga's ability to handle the built-in serial port, causing
communication problems. Alternative serial drivers may help.

As mentioned above, the on-Workbench display modes are only available
on 2.0 and above systems. MUD's menus are designed to look most like
standard 3.1 menus, but that appearance requires a 3.1 menu flag. So,
on 2.0 and earlier systems, the menus will look like an intermediate
between 2.0 style and 3.1 style (mostly 3.1 style with 2.0 colours).
Other than that, MUD does not use any 3.1 features. In particular, it
does not do any pen-locking, so on-Workbench colour handling is the
same under 3.1 as it is under 2.0.

There are ten distinct display types supported by the MUD program,
although some are only minor variations. If not told otherwise, it will
open up the "basic" display. In this type, a graphics screen that is
320 pixels wide, 100 pixels high, and 5 bits deep (32 colours) is
opened at the top of the display. It will be horizontally centered
within your overscan range. The remainder of the display will be
filled with a hi-res text screen, that is roughly as wide as your
horizontal overscan, and roughly fills your vertical overscan. Note
that this means that PAL systems will have more text lines than NTSC
systems. The text display has a scroll-bar on the right hand side. All
Amigas can use this display type with their built-in hardware.

Unless you are running a pre-2.0 system, the text colours of the
"basic" display will be taken from your Workbench colours, so the text
window should look much like a shell window with a scrollbar. The
input prompt will be in a different colour, however. With this type,
the menu-bar is attached to the text window in the text screen, so the
menus will be half-way down the display, which is a bit unusual. Since
the text window is using your Workbench colours, the effects function
which changes the pens of the text window, and the scenario commands
which use it (e.g. 'normalgrey' and 'brightgold'), are all disabled.

To the basic display type can be added the "oldstyle" modifier. This
modifier makes MUD operate the way it used to, before the V1.1
changes. With this display type, AmigaOS V2 and V3 features are not
used, and the Workbench colours are ignored. Instead, the old gold
colour scheme is used. When an oldstyle display is active, the
function and commands for changing the text window colours are again
active, and the 'dim' and 'bright' startup options are available.

A second modifier is the "hires" modifier. With this modifier active,
the basic display will have a graphics area that is 640 pixels across,
200 pixels high, and 5 bits deep. The text screen will also be twice
as many pixels high, giving twice as many lines of text. The "hires"
modifier can be mixed with the "oldstyle" modifier to produce a total
of four styles of "basic" display. Note that the hires displays use
more memory and are a bit slower than the non-hires displays. As
mentioned above, the hires displays require an AGA system, or a
graphics card.

The second major display type is the "onescreen" display type. In this
type of display, MUD opens only one screen, and uses Intuition windows
on that screen for the graphics and text areas. In order that the
standard 32 colours be available for graphics, in addition to the four
(or more) colours needed for your standard Workbench windows, this
display type opens a 64 colour (6 bit) display. The upper 32 colours
are used for the graphics window, and the lower 32 are used (if at
all) only by the text display, window borders, etc. The "onescreen"
display type works on AGA systems, but is very slow. It is intended
for those with graphics cards which cannot open multi-resolution or
multi-depth displays. The "hires" modifier can be used with
"onescreen" displays, with the expected effect. The combined type is,
in my opinion, unusably slow on my all-CBM A4000T/040. In "onescreen"
displays, the menus are attached to the graphics window, and so are
at the top of the display.

The third major display type is the "twowindow" type. In this display,
MUD opens up two windows on the Workbench screen (actually, on the
default public screen). In the lores variant, the text window will
open at the top of the screen, and will have room for 23 lines of text
(the space needed for the builtin editor's HELP display) of 80 columns
each. This will be reduced if it will not fit. The graphics window
will have interior room for 320x100 pixels, and will be opened just
inside the top-right-hand corner of the text window. In the hires
variant of the "twowindow" type, the graphics window is double-size
and opens at the top of the screen. The text window opens below it, if
possible. If the text window doesn't fit there, it will be moved
upwards, overlapping the graphics window, until it does fit. The text
window can be resized from fullscreen to very small. The graphics
window cannot be resized, since the MUD client does not maintain
enough information to be able to redraw its contents at a different
size. Scaling of non-bitmap graphics is actually done by scenario code
running in the server.

The final major display type is the "onewindow" type. In this display,
MUD opens up only a single window on the Workbench screen. There will
be a fake separator between the graphics up top and the text down
below. The text scroll-bar will only be beside the text portion of the
window, and some user interface hacks can mess that up a bit. The
combined window can be sized, but not narrower than the full width
needed for the graphics, or shorter than the full height of the
graphics plus a few lines of text. The graphics are always in the top-
left corner of the window, to allow for the most resizing. In the
hires variant, the graphics is twice as large, thus occupying twice as
much space in the window.

Note that in both Workbench display types, MUD is constrained to only
using the colours available on your Workbench screen. This can
seriously affect the viewability of the graphics. MUD attempts to
remap colours as best it can, but the results can be pretty bad,
depending on the available colours. It is best to have a least one of
each of the major colours: white, black, grey, red, blue, yellow,
brown, etc. Four colour displays can be useable, and 8-colour ones can
work not bad.

The various sizes and depths of available graphics displays have
required some additional features in MUD, and some changes to the
basic AmigaMUD programming language and builtin functions. When
loading bitmap images (backgrounds, images or brushes), MUD will scale
them to the required size. On pre-V2.0 systems, the scaling routine
(in the Amiga's "graphics.library") does not exist, however, so those
systems will get a mess.

With a Workbench display, MUD probably does not have its chosen set of
32 colours available, and it is not allowed to alter the palette.
Instead, MUD will map the 32 standard colours to the available
colours. So, it will report a colour count of 32, regardless of the
actual colour count. It will also report that it can change the
palette, even though it never will. It can, however, change its colour
mapping in response to palette change requests from the server.

Remapping of IFF ILBM images is a slow process, and sometimes it
doesn't work very well. The standard scenario is usable on my four-
colour Workbench, but only just. Some images just do not come out at
all. With an eight-colour display, things are much better, especially
if the eight colours are chosen so as to give a good choice to MUD. A
32 colour Workbench can be just as good as letting MUD create its own
screens (but slower, on my A4000T). One way of getting a good set of
colours into your Workbench palette (since the Preferences tool only
lets you set the lower 8 colours), is to set the included file
"palette" as your background image, and then save your palette using
the Preferences tool. Once you have your palette preferences set up,
you can go back to your normal background pattern. If you normally use
a background image, then the colours from the palette for that file
will be the ones that MUD will have to use in "workbench" mode.

[The following is a technical note that is mostly relevant to
designers of AmigaMUD scenarios.] When colour remapping is in effect,
changing the colour of a pen doesn't work quite the same. Instead of
changing a real pen, MUD simply takes the new colour, finds the best
match for it in the real Workbench palette, and enters that value in
the slot in its colour mapping table for the colour being changed.
This will affect future drawing using that pen. In types other than
"Workbench", all existing pixels in that pen will also be affected.
So, it is best if a scenario does all colour palette changes before it
does any drawing. This also holds true for tiles cached by MUD - they
are mapped when they are cached, not each time they are used, so
palette changes should be done before any tiles have to be sent to the
clients.

When a Workbench display type is selected, you can also tell MUD to
not do the above-mentioned colour remapping. When remapping is turned
off, MUD works directly in the Workbench colour palette. The standard
scenario drawn images (as opposed to the bitmap files, which will
still be remapped as normal) will be drawn directly with the pen-
numbers that the scenario gives. This will make a mess for the
standard scenario, since it assumes the default 32 colours. However,
if you are making a new scenario, this mode may be desireable, as it
lets you access the full 256 colours of a 256-colour AGA Workbench.
This will be reported via the GColours builtin returning 256. Note,
however, that anyone playing such a scenario must have the same
Workbench palette, for *all* colours that you use, in order for the
graphics to come out right.

Setting the MUD display type can be done with command-line flags, icon
tooltypes or shell environment variables. See the relevant sections
of this document for details.


MUD Icon Tool Types

Some tool types accept a boolean (true/false) argument. MUD interprets
any of YES/yes/ON/on/TRUE/true or an empty argument as true, and any
other value as false. Note that on early versions of the AmigaOS,
empty values are not valid. They ARE valid under V2.0. Other tool
types require numeric arguments. These must be given in decimal.
String arguments can have any value not containing spaces.

    IPHOST (string) - this tooltype specifies the name (or IP address)
	of the internet machine to connect to, and also forces MUD to
	use only an internet connection through a TCP/IP stack. Use
	this tooltype only on icons which you will use only when your
	TCP/IP stack is active.

    IPPORT (numeric) - this tooltype specifies a different IP port to
	use when connecting over the internet. The default value is
	6667. Like IPHOST, this tooltype forces an internet
	connection.

    MODE = { ONESCREEN | TWOSCREEN | ONEWINDOW | TWOWINDOW } - this
	tooltype selects which display type the MUD program is to use.
	See the above section on "Display" for details on the various
	display types.

    HIRES (boolean) - this tooltype controls whether or not MUD will
	use higher resolution for its screens and windows. This
	provides twice the vertical and horizontal graphics
	resolution. In non-Workbench display types, this will also
	provide twice the number of text lines. This option does not
	work correctly on non-AGA systems, since the Amiga chips do
	not support the needed graphics capability.

    OLDSTYLE (boolean) - this tooltype controls whether or not MUD
	will use the old-style gold text colours, and allow text
	colour palette modification. The default is to not allow this
	under V2.0 and above of the AmigaOS. This flag is only useful
	with a "ONESCREEN" display.

    MAPCOLOURS (boolean) - this tooltype is only relevant in a
	Workbench display mode, and is normally enabled. Turning
	this option off forces MUD to work directly in the Workbench
	colours, and not attempt to remap colours.

    FULLREDRAW (boolean) - this tooltype should not be needed. MUD
	makes some undocumented assumptions about what happens when
	a window is resized. This allows it to do faster operations
	when showing or hiding the graphics window. If your display is
	messed up when doing those operations, try setting this flag,
	and let me know about it.

    EFFECTSQUIET (boolean) - this tooltype controls whether or not MUD
	prints a warning message in the text window whenever the
	scenario references an effects file (background, image, brush
	or sound) that is not available on this system. Seeing the
	warnings is useful in order to know what files the active
	scenario can use, but the warnings can be annoying.

    SERIAL (boolean) - this tool type tells MUD to connect to a remote
	server over a serial port. Using any of the serial-specific
	tool types will also imply the setting of this tool type.

    LOCAL (boolean) - this tool type tells MUD to connect to a server
	running on the local machine, rather than trying to connect to
	a remote server via a serial port or via a TCP/IP stack. This
	is the default action.

    CLOSEWORKBENCH (boolean) - this tool type tells MUD to try to
	close the Workbench screen after it has started up. This will
	normally only work from a Workbench startup, and only if there
	are no other programs active that were started from the
	Workbench. Using this option can recover system memory for use
	in caching effects, images, sounds, etc. The Workbench can
	also be closed (and opened) using menu items.

    BRIGHT (boolean) - this tool type tells MUD to start up using a
	brighter than normal set of colours for the text window. This
	is useful on bright sunny days. Only relevant for an
	"oldstyle" display.

    DIM (boolean) - this tool type tells MUD to start up using a
	dimmer than normal set of colours for the text window. This is
	useful for nighttime MUDding. Only relevant for an "oldstyle"
	display.

    EDITOR = { INTERNAL | SELECTED | EXTERNAL } - this tool type sets
	the default setting for the similar menu item. If INTERNAL is
	set, then all editing will use the built-in editor. If
	SELECTED is set, then MUD will use the built-in editor for
	editing strings, and an external editor for editing procs. If
	EXTERNAL is set, then MUD will use an external editor for
	everything.

    OHISTORY (numeric) - this tool type sets the size of the output
	history buffer that MUD maintains. This is the text that can
	be reviewed using the scroll bar in the text output window.
	The minimum size is 1920 characters. Note that giving too
	large a value can result in significant slowdown, as new text
	is inserted at the end of a large buffer. The default value is
	5000 characters.

    IHISTORY (numeric) - this tool type sets the size of the input
	history buffer that MUD maintains. This is the command lines
	that can be retrieved using the up-arrow key, in the same
	method that is used in a shell window. As described later, the
	shell's input editing functions can also be used. The default
	size of the input history buffer is 1024 characters, and the
	minimum size is 160 characters.

    PORTNAME (string) - this tool type allows the user to change the
	name of the Amiga OS port that MUD will try to connect to for
	a local connection. By default, this name is "MUD port". Using
	a different name allows the simultaneous use of multiple
	AmigaMUDs on a given system. This tool type lets MUD select
	which one to connect to. Note that this is *not* an internet
	IP port number or service name.

    TEST - this tool type is a short way of picking "MUD test port" as
	the name of the Amiga OS port to connect to.

    BAUD (numeric) - this tool type allows the setting of the baud
	rate (more properly called bps) to use for a connection on a
	serial port. The default value is 19200. Note that the Amiga's
	internal serial port can accept a wide range of values, but
	standard values of 300, 1200, 2400, 9600, 19200 or 38400
	should be used for compatibility. If a value that does not
	appear on MUD's serial menu is used, then none of the speeds
	in the menu will be checked.

    IGNORECD (boolean) - this tool type tells MUD to ignore the state
	of the CD (Carrier Detect) serial port control signal.
	Normally, MUD will exit when the CD signal is lost, since this
	means that the modem connection has been lost. Setting this
	flag is needed with modems that cannot (or have been
	instructed to not) properly generate the signal, or with
	serial cables that do not pass the signal. Also, when
	connecting two Amigas directly via their serial ports (and a
	"null modem"), this option is usually needed.

    7WIRE (boolean) - this tool type tells MUD to instruct the serial
	driver to pay attention to the hardware flow control signals
	on the serial port. This is recommended for use with direct
	connections or high-speed modems. It should not be used if the
	modem is not generating and paying attention to the signals,
	or if the connecting cable is not carrying the signals.

    SHARED (boolean) - this tool type tells MUD to open the serial
	port in "shared" mode. This means that other programs can have
	the port open at the same time. MUD (and the MUDAgent program
	at the other end) will become confused if any other program
	actually reads from or writes to the port while MUD is
	connected, so this flag should be used with care.

    RETRIES (numeric) - this tool type specifies the number of times
	that MUD should attempt to send or receive any given message
	via the serial port connection. The default value is 10.
	Larger values may be needed for reliable operation over noisy
	telephone lines. Too large a value should not be given,
	however, since then MUD won't give up soon enough on a true
	lost connection.

    DIAL (string) - this tool type allows the specification of a
	string to be sent over the serial port (usually to a modem) on
	startup. With most modems, a dial string of the form
	ATD1234567 will cause the modem to start dialing a telephone
	number. This is handy to set up an icon for MUD to connect to
	a specific remote AmigaMUD, or in a shell alias.

    NAME (string) - specify the name of the character to log in as.
	Note that this is an AmigaMUD login, not a BBS or other one.

    PASSWORD (string) - specify the password for your character. It is
	not recommended that you use this flag if your system is open
	to use by others, since they can find your password easily. If
	the password given this way is incorrect, it counts as the
	first of your three attempts at getting it right.

    DEVICE (string) - this tool type allows the specification of the
	name of an alternative serial device to use for a connection.
	The default name is "serial.device", which refers to the
	standard built-in serial port.

    UNIT (numeric) - this tool type allows the specification of a
	particular serial port unit on a device with several ports.
	The default value is 0.

    FLAGS (numeric) - this tool type is used to specify some special
	flag values which MUD passes on to "mud.library". The flag
	values only effect the operation of some caching mechanisms
	which are of value to wizards. The value is the sum of the
	following:

	    1 - cache procs. This remote client will cache the
		definitions (but not the bodies) of builtin and user
		procs in the AmigaMUD language. This saves refetching
		them when parsing procs (such as after editing one).

	    2 - cache symbols. This remote client will cache the
		values of symbols that it has fetched from the server.
		Again, this cuts down on communications when parsing
		AmigaMUD procs.

	Note that both of these flags increase the amount of memory
	consumed by MUD. This memory is not freed until MUD exits.
	The default value of 'FLAGS' is 0, i.e. both caches off.

    EDITORSTACK (numeric) - this is the size of stack to use for an
	external editor process. The default is 9996 bytes, and the
	minimum is 4096 bytes.

    Examples:

	IPHOST=mud.myrias.com
	MODE=onescreen
	IHISTORY=10000

	This requests a connection over the internet to a machine
	named "mud.myrias.com", using the default IP port. The display
	is to be on a single custom screen (useful mostly with
	graphics cards), and a large 10000 byte input history is used.

	MODE=twowindow
	HIRES=true
	LOCAL=true
	PORTNAME=MUD2
	OHISTORY=10000

	This requests a connection on the local machine to a server
	running with Amiga OS port name "MUD2". An output history
	buffer of 10000 characters will be allocated and used. The
	display will use a high resolution graphics window and a
	separate text window on the Workbench screen.

	MODE=twoscreen
	OLDSTYLE=true
	BAUD=9600
	7WIRE
	DEVICE=siosbx.device
	UNIT=1

	This requests a 9600 bps connection, using hardware flow
	control, on the second port of an ASDG dual-port board. The
	display will be the oldstyle gold text display in a pair of
	custom screens.


MUD CLI Command Line Flags

All of the above icon tool types can be given on a CLI command line,
as in:

    MUD HIRES BAUD=19200 7WIRE IHISTORY=2000 DIAL=atd1234567

In addition, there are short forms for many of the flags and some
additional flags that are only meaningful from a CLI command line.
In these flags, any needed value must directly follow the flag
letter, i.e. there must not be any spaces between them. More detailed
descriptions of these settings can be found in the previous section
on icon tool types.

When started from a CLI, the name and optional port number of an
internet host to connect to can be given, without being preceeded by a
minus sign. E.g.    "mud supersys.com"	  will attempt a TCP/IP
connection to a remote machine named "supersys.com", using the default
IP port of 6667, and using all other default values (as modified by
any environment variables set).

The flags supported are:

    -w - open in one or two Workbench windows

    -1 - open in one window or screen, not two

    -h - hires display

    -O - oldstyle display

    -m - open on workbench, do not remap colours

    -f - fullredraw

    -q - effects quiet

    -w - try to close the Workbench on startup

    -L - make a local connection

    -T - make a local connection using port "MUD test port"

    -B - use the bright text window colours (oldstyle only)

    -D - use the dim text window colours (oldstyle only)

    -F <flags> - set the mud.library flags - see FLAGS tool type

    -P <portname> - use the given name as the local port to connect to

    -S - do a serial connection with the port opened in shared mode

    -d <device> - use the named device instead of "serial.device"

    -u <unit> - use the given device unit instead of unit 0

    -b <speed> - use the given serial speed instead of 19200

    -i - ignore the Carrier Detect serial signal

    -7 - use 7-wire hardware serial handshaking

    -N <name> - use <name> as the name of the character for the
	playing sessions, rather than prompting for a name

    -W <word> - use <word> as the password for the playing sessions.
	If it is incorrect, it counts as the first attempt, and only
	two attempts remain. This is normally used in conjunction with
	-N, but can be used without it.

    -r <count> - retry each failing message the given number of times

    -E - this flag was useful to me when I was testing the sample
	online building sessions - it starts up MUD with its editing
	capability disabled, so that text must be entered in the line-
	by-line mode. The disabling is known to the MUD server, and
	hence to the scenario.

    -s <size> - this flags specifies the size of stack to use for an
	external editor process. The default size is 9996 bytes, and
	the minimum size is 4096 bytes.

An interesting combination is to combine a DIAL= with -N and -W. If
the system you are calling is directly running MUDAgent for a binary
connection, then the call will happen and you will end up being
connected to your character, without having to do anything else.

The following flags are included for compatibility with the "Getty"
program. There is currently no real use for this support, but I
believe that it may become desireable to have a terminal program which
can call out to the MUD client program, much as Getty or BBS's call
out to the MUDAgent program. This is because the terminal support in
MUD is minimal, and the user may want to do other activities during a
BBS connection which require more functionality. A terminal program
which supports callouts in this manner could then be used to provide
both levels of functionality in a given connection. Most people can
ignore these flags, at least for now. See Getty documentation for
details. The flags are:

    -Getty - supresses any port initialization, and opens shared
    -DEVICE <name> - name of device to use
    -UNIT <number> - unit number on device
    -HLINK - ignore carrier detect
    -BAUD <speed> - set connection speed
    -USER <name> - parameter ignored


Environment Variables

MUD checks for a number of environment variables (as set with the
shell 'setenv' command). These values can override some default
settings in MUD, and can be in turn overriden by icon tooltypes or
command-line flags. All environment variables are of boolean type.
The following variables are recognized:

    MUDLocal - if true, forces a local connection (no longer really
	needed, now that the default is a local connection)

    MUDMode - can contain the name of the display type to be used

    MUDHiRes - if true, forces hires display

    MUDMapColours - if false, turns of colour remapping

    MUDFullRedraw - if true, forces full redraw mode

    MUDEffectsQuiet - if true, supresses effects warnings

    MUDEditor - path to the text editor to use an external editor

    EDITOR - editor path to use if MUDEditor is not specified

See the previous sections for discussion of the detailed meanings of
these options.


Menus in MUD

Some of the menu items in MUD have function key shortcuts. Others have
right-amiga command key shortcuts. Both types of shortcuts will work
regardless of which of the windows (graphics or text) is currently the
active one. Most of the "Serial" menus will only work while in
"terminal mode", and some others will not work in terminal mode.
Inactive menus are shown ghosted. Key shortcuts for menu items are
shown here inside square brackets.

    Project - the Project menu contains general utility operations.

	Log [F7] - this item will enable or disable logging of text
	    input and output. If no logfile name has been selected
	    when logging is turned on, one will be requested.

	Log File - allows selection of a file to log to. Logging will
	    be turned on after the selection of a name.

	Log Mode - the two modes, Both and Input, control what will be
	    logged to a log file. If 'Both' is checked, then both the
	    user's input and the game's output is logged. If 'Input'
	    is checked, then only the user's input is logged, with any
	    passwords omitted.

	Source - a file name is requested, and the contents of the
	    file is read and inserted as input from the user. This
	    operation works in either "wizard" mode (the user is
	    operating directly with the AmigaMUD interpreter) or in
	    normal mode, where input is being parsed as commands for
	    the scenario. Do not attempt to change modes inside a
	    sourced file, however, since the changing of modes is
	    not a synchronous event, and a few commands will end up
	    being given to the wrong mode.

	SnapShot

	    Text - a file name is requested, and the entire contents
		of the output history buffer is written to the file.

	    Graphics - a file name is requested, and the current
		contents of the graphics window is written to the file
		as an IFF ILBM image. The current graphics palette is
		included in the IFF file.

	Quit [R-A Q] - MUD disconnects from the server and either
	    exits, or goes back to the "terminal mode", depending on
	    whether you are running the client locally or remotely.
	    Using the close box on the text window has the same
	    effect, unless you are currently editing something, in
	    which case only the edit is aborted, as with typing a ^C.

	Abort - MUD exits immediately. This is useful if the server
	    has hung, or something has gone wrong with the connection
	    to it. Using this instead of 'Quit' may prevent you from
	    reconnecting to your character until the server times out
	    and shuts the connection down at its end. In some cases,
	    manual intervention on the server may be required before
	    you can connect to your character again.

    Modes - the Modes menu controls various parts of MUD that can be
	enabled and disabled, or which give a choice of behaviours.

	History - this item allows you to control which of your input
	    lines is entered into the input history buffer. In 'Full'
	    mode, all input lines are entered, regardless of how they
	    were generated. In 'New' mode, input lines are entered
	    only if they were not taken unchanged from the input
	    history. In 'Minimal' mode, input lines are entered into
	    the history only if they did not originate from that
	    history, i.e. only if they were typed in completely. I
	    recommend 'New' mode.

	Scroll On - this item allows you to control when the output
	    window is scrolled. If 'Input' is chosen, then the output
	    window scrolls only when a new input line is entered, or
	    when it must be scrolled because it is full and an output
	    line must be added. If 'Output' is chosen, then the output
	    window is scrolled whenever a new line of output is added
	    to the bottom. If 'Either' is chosen, then both input and
	    output lines will cause the scrolling. If 'Neither' is
	    chosen, then the output window does not scroll unless the
	    user scrolls it or it is full. This last mode is useful
	    when typing input lines based on output history that has
	    already scrolled out of the text window.

	Editor - this item allows you to choose when to use the
	    internal editor and when to use an external editor. If
	    'Internal' is chosen, then the internal editor is used for
	    editing strings (such as descriptions) and when editing
	    AmigaMUD functions when in wizard mode. If 'Selected' is
	    chosen, then strings are edited with the internal editor
	    and functions with an external one. If 'External' is
	    chosen, then an external editor is used for everything. If
	    you are not familiar with running a text editor such as
	    'Ed' on the Amiga, I recommend using 'Internal'. When
	    editing AmigaMUD functions, the internal editor can move
	    the cursor to the position of errors when the function is
	    submitted for parsing. Some external editors support this
	    kind of operation using ARexx commands, but MUD does not
	    currently support this.

	Picture [F1] - this item controls whether or not the graphics
	    window is visible. A full screen text window can be useful
	    when wizarding or when chatting with a number of other
	    players. Note that the picture cannot be hidden when MUD
	    is running in a Workbench window.

	Graphics [F2] - this items allows the user to disable all
	    graphics operations in the MUD client. This setting is
	    sent to the server, so it will not even send graphics
	    output messages. Note that turning graphics off and then
	    on again at a later time can result in an out-of-date or
	    inconsistent graphics view.

	Sound [F3] - this item allows the user to disable all playing
	    of sound samples. The setting is sent to the server so
	    that it doesn't even send sound requests to the client.

	Music [F4] - this item allows the user to disable all playing
	    of music scores. The setting is sent to the server so that
	    it doesn't even send music requests to the client.

	Voice [F5] - this item allows the user to disable all speech
	    output. The setting is sent to the server so that it
	    doesn't even send speech requests to the client.

	Edit Win [F6] - this menu item is the only way to switch
	    between the full-screen internal editor window and the
	    normal split-screen playing view. The item is not enabled
	    when nothing is being edited. By switching to the normal
	    view when editing, you can continue to operate in the MUD,
	    but this shouldn't be done long, since you might suddenly
	    need to edit something else.

    Options - these menu items select some supplementary functions.

	ScreenToBack [R-A B] - this item sends the MUD client screens
	    (the graphics and text windows) to the back of the stack
	    of screens on your Amiga. Unless you are running other
	    programs, this will just result in the normal Workbench
	    screen coming to the front. It is useful during testing,
	    however, since then there might be several MUD clients
	    running on the same system as a server. Sending a ^F
	    signal to MUD will cause it to move its screens to the
	    front of the display. This function is not active when MUD
	    is running in a Workbench window.

	Workbench - this item allows you to try to turn the Amiga's
	    Workbench on and off. Turning the Workbench off is useful
	    to conserve memory. The Workbench will not turn off if
	    other applications are open on the Workbench screen, or if
	    MUD itself is running in a Workbench window.

	Effects - this item allows you to examine and manipulate the
	    local caches of graphics and sound effects that the MUD
	    client maintains.

	    Free File - a single cached IFF file will be freed. This
		can be a background, brush or image, a sound sample,
		or a music score. The next time the selected file is
		needed, it will have to be reloaded from disk. The
		system will chose the least recently used file.

	    Free Effect - free the single least recently used
		unreferenced effect. See a later section on 'Caches'
		for more details.

	    Zap Effects [R-A Z] - free all effects

	    Show Status - show the status of all cached files and
		effects. This status is affected by requests coming
		from the server and by the above three menu items. See
		the 'Caches' section for more information.

	    Quiet - when active (checked), this flag tells MUD to not
		print warning messages about not being able to find
		effects files. These messages let you know what files
		the scenario is trying to use, but can be annoying.

	Memory - the amount of available chip and total memory is
	    shown. This can be useful in understanding why effects
	    aren't happening (lack of memory), and to get a feel for
	    the amount of memory that the MUD client can consume.

    Serial - these items are mostly of use only during an initial
	"terminal mode" with a serial connection.

	IgnoreCD - controls whether or not MUD will expect a valid CD
	    (Carrier Detect) signal. This hardware signal should be
	    generated by a modem when it detects a carrier signal on
	    the telephone line. If your modem does not do this, or if
	    you have told it not to, or if your serial cable does not
	    transmit the signal, you should instruct MUD to ignore the
	    signal, else it will not think a connection has been made.

	Speed - provides a few manually-selectable speeds for use when
	    in terminal mode. Other values can be entered from an icon
	    tool type or a CLI command line.

	Break [R-A .] - requests that a break condition be sent over
	    the serial line. This condition is a lengthy pause in the
	    raw transmit data stream that is detectable at the other
	    end of the line. You can see it as an "on" pulse in your
	    modem's TX light.

	Connect [R-A C] - this item forces MUD to attempt to initiate
	    a binary connection with the other end. If the other end
	    is set up to only handle a binary connection, this will
	    not be necessary, since the other end will start things
	    up. If, however the other end is waiting to distinguish
	    either a binary or a text-only connection, then this menu
	    item is used to start up a binary connection.

	Stats [R-A S] - this item shows some statistics maintained by
	    the serial protocol code:

		Packets TX: - total number of packets (messages) sent
		    out from this end.

		ACKs TX: number of positive acknowledgements of
		    correctly received packets that this end has sent.

		NAKs TX: number of negative acknowledgements of
		    incorrectly received packets that this end has
		    sent. Incorrectly received packets must be resent
		    by the sender.

		Packets RX: total number of packets that this end has
		    received.

		ACKs RX: number of positive acknowledgements received.

		NAKs RX: number of negative acknowledgements received.

		Waits timed out: MUD puts a time limit on any of its
		    waits for receiving something over the serial
		    port. This number indicated how many times that
		    time limit went off. Normally, this means that a
		    packet sent from this end was completely lost, so
		    the other end didn't either ACK or NAK it.

		Read no bytes: indicates the number of times a serial
		    port read request returned, but indicated that no
		    bytes were received. This can happen if a BREAK
		    condition is received.

		Writes failed: indicates the number of times that a
		    serial port write request did not complete due to
		    some error, such as a loss of carrier signal.


History Manipulation and Input Line Editing

MUD maintains two forms of history. One is a history of commands
entered by the user, and the other is a history of both input lines
and output text from the server.

The output history is straightforward - it can be accessed by using
the scroll bar on the right hand side of the text window. Also,
pressing an ALT key and an up or down arrow key at the same time will
scroll the output window a line at a time. Additionally pressing a
shift key (along with the ALT key and the arrow key) will scroll by a
full window at a time.

Input history and input line editing is very similar to that done in
the standard Amiga shell, with some minor additions. The available
operations are as follows:

    up-arrow - scroll backward in the input history

    down-arrow - scroll forward in the input history

    shift-up-arrow - search backward in the input history for a line
	which matches the input text to the left of the cursor. If any
	is found, insert it into the input region in place of what was
	previously there.

    shift-down-arrow - move the current history search point to the
	end of the input history and clear the input region

    HELP, and numeric keypad keys - these are sent as is to the
	AmigaMUD server, where they can be used as desired by the
	currently running scenario

    right-arrow - move the cursor right one column

    left-arrow - move the cursor left one column

    shift-right-arrow - move the cursor to the end of the current
	input

    shift-left-arrow - move the cursor to the beginning of the input
	region

    cntl-A - move the cursor to the beginning of the input region

    cntl-B - move the cursor left one column

    cntl-E - move the cursor to the end of the current input

    cntl-F - move the cursor right one column

    cntl-H (backspace) - delete the character before the cursor

    cntl-I (tab) - move the cursor forward to the next 8 column
	boundary

    cntl-K - delete all characters from the one under the cursor to
	the end of the current input. The deleted characters are saved
	in the "undo buffer".

    cntl-M (carriage return) - send the current input to the server
	and clear the input region ready for another line. The line
	may be added to the input history, depending on the setting of
	the history choice, and on whether any editing of the line had
	been done.

    cntl-N - go forward one line in the input history

    cntl-P - go backward one line in the input history

    cntl-R - search backward through the input history. Same as
	shift-up-arrow.

    cntl-U - delete all input characters to the left of the current
	cursor position.

    cntl-W - delete the "word" to the left of the cursor

    cntl-X - clear the input region

    cntl-Y - insert from the undo buffer at the current cursor
	position, and move the cursor to the end of the input data.

    DEL - delete the character under the cursor


Using the Internal Editor

The internal editor in the MUD client program can be started to edit a
simple text string, such as a character description, a room
description, etc. or to edit an AmigaMUD function while in wizard
mode. The initial startup varies slightly between the two situations,
mostly relating to the quoting and escaping of things, but the main
operation of the editor is the same in both cases.

The edit session is actually started by messages from the server, but
the server is normally just responding to user requests. When editing
is to be done, the text to be edited must first be sent from the
server to the MUD client program. This can take a few seconds for a
large function or description operating over a slow link. When all of
the data has arrived, MUD will switch to a single full-screen text
window (if it wasn't already) containing the first windowfull of the
text. A menu item, or function key F6, can be used to temporarily
switch back to the normal mode of operation. The switch-back should be
short, however, since MUD will not allow multiple things to be edited
at once by any given client.

While editing, the normal function keys and menus still operate, but
their effect may not be immediately visible. Normal input and output
history do not work, however, as they are replaced by an expanded set
of editing operations. In edit mode, pressing the HELP key will
display a short summary of the editing operations available.

The internal editor is always in "insert mode"; that is, characters
typed will always be inserted before any characters at or after the
cursor on the current line, shifting those other characters to the
right. The editor limits lines being edited to 160 characters (two
displayed lines). Lines coming from the server will never be longer
than can be displayed in the window, so longer lines can only be
created by editing. There is no need to use long lines in AmigaMUD -
lines of descriptions are all joined when the description is sent
back to the server, and the spacing of functions is thrown away when
the function is parsed. When editing things like letters and
bulletins, the user's lines are preserved, but long ones will be
wrapped when sent to any clients reading them.

When editing an AmigaMUD function in wizard mode, the editor can work
with the parser to identify the location of errors. When the user
types the cntl-Q key combination, the text in the editor is parsed (on
the local machine, by code in mud.library) into an internal data
structure. If any errors are encountered, the parser gives an error
message and a position to the editor. The editor displays the message
in reverse video at the bottom of the window, and moves the cursor to
the reported position, redrawing the window if necessary. The user can
then immediately do editing to correct the error. If a further cntl-Q
is entered, the parsing will be restarted from the beginning of the
function. If, however, a cntl-G is entered, the parsing will continue
from the first error, perhaps showing further errors in the function.
A cntl-R combination can be entered to abort the parsing, but not
start another parse. At any point in editing, a cntl-C can be entered
to abort the entire edit session. Similarly, clicking on the edit
window close box will abort the edit session, but will not cause MUD
to exit.

The text window's scroll bar is active while editing, and can be used
to scroll around in a long function or description. Also, the same
alt-up-arrow, alt-down-arrow, shift-alt-up-arrow and shift-alt-down-
arrow key combinations that work in normal mode also operate while
editing. When scrolling this way, the text cursor may have to move to
remain visible in the window.

The available editing operations are:

    Control operations:

	HELP - display a short summary of operations

	cntl-C - abort the edit. If editing a description, the
	    scenario code is informed that the edit was aborted. If
	    editing an AmigaMUD function, the function will be
	    unchanged from before the edit. The edit can also be
	    aborted by clicking on the close box of the edit window.
	    This will not cause MUD to exit.

	cntl-Q - if editing a description, then the description as it
	    is in the editor is sent to the server as the result of
	    editing, and the MUD client program switches back to
	    normal operation. If editing a function, then MUD starts
	    parsing the function. If no errors are encountered, the
	    function is sent to the server where the new definition
	    immediately replaces the old one. If an error is
	    encountered, its message is displayed at the bottom of the
	    window, and the cursor is moved to the location of the
	    error.

	cntl-G - this combination does nothing unless a function is
	    being editing, and an error has been encountered. In that
	    situation, the parsing continues and the next error is
	    reported. If there are no more errors, that is indicated.

	cntl-R - this combination does nothing unless a function is
	    being edited, and an error has been encountered. In that
	    case, all further errors from this parse of the function
	    are discarded.

    Cursor motion operations:

	left-arrow - move cursor left one column

	right-arrow - move cursor right one column

	shift-left-arrow - move cursor to the beginning of the line

	shift-right-arrow - move cursor to just past the end of the
	    line

	down-arrow - move cursor down one line, scrolling the window
	    if necessary

	up-arrow - move cursor up one line, scrolling the window if
	    necessary

	shift-down-arrow - move cursor to the bottom of the window

	shift-up-arrow - move cursor to the top of the window

	cntl-A - move cursor to the beginning of the line

	cntl-B - move cursor back one column

	cntl-E - move cursor to the end of the current line

	cntl-F - move cursor forward one column

	cntl-I (tab) - move cursor forward to the next 8-column
	    tabstop

	cntl-L - move cursor to the beginning of the next line

	cntl-N - move cursor to the next line

	cntl-P - move cursor to the previous line

	cntl-T - move cursor to the line at the top of the window

	cntl-Z - move cursor to the line at the bottom of the window

    Editing operations:

	cntl-D - delete the current line

	cntl-H (backspace) - delete the character before the cursor

	cntl-J - join this line with the next line. The text of the
	    next line is appended to the end of the current line.

	cntl-K - characters from the current one under the cursor to
	    the end of the line are deleted (killed)

	cntl-M (carriage return) - a new line is inserted after the
	    current one and the cursor moves to the beginning of that
	    empty line

	cntl-S - split the current line. Characters from the one under
	    the cursor to the end of the line are moved into a new
	    line inserted after the current one.

	cntl-U - characters from the beginning of the current line
	    upto the one just before the cursor are deleted

	cntl-W - the previous "word" is deleted. A word is a sequence
	    of non-spaces delimited by spaces or the beginning or end
	    of the line.

	cntl-X - the current line is cleared, or emptied

	cntl-Y - the line is put back to the same state it had before
	    any changes were made to it. This backup copy of the line
	    is discarded if the cursor is moved out of the line, i.e.
	    only changes made to the line while the cursor is in the
	    line can be undone.


Caches in the MUD Client Program

In computer usage, a cache is a set of local copies of things that are
expensive to get. An instruction cache in a CPU is a small memory
which contains some of the instructions executed most recently. This
cache memory can be accessed much faster than the main RAM memory
external to the CPU chip. This same technique is used in AmigaMUD to
speed up operation. This section will discuss the caches used in the
MUD client program. The symbol cache and the function header cache are
of benefit only to wizards, and were discussed earlier.

AmigaMUD uses the term "effect" to refer to any of the non-text output
items that are possible: graphics, sound, voice and music. Scenes in a
scenario can be drawn in a variety of ways. The simplest way is to
simply load an IFF ILBM image produced using a paint program. This
image must be present on the remote client machines, however, since
sending such an image over the serial connection every time it is
needed would be too slow. Many players of an AmigaMUD scenario will
not have the pictures, however, so an alternate method of drawing a
scene is needed.

As directed by code in AmigaMUD functions, the server can send
messages to remote clients directing them to draw various simple
graphical elements in the graphics window. These include lines,
rectangles, circles, etc. A simple form of a scene can be drawn using
these elements, and can be sent from the server to the client in less
time than sending a full bitmap of a similar scene. It is useful,
however, if a given scene needs to be sent over only once per session.
Then, the scene can be called up by a short command from the server,
thus greatly speeding up the play of the game.

This storing of graphics elements (and commands to play sounds, etc.
as well) by the remote clients is the "effects cache". Each effect is
uniquely identified, and can be called up much like a subroutine or
function can be called in a programming language. In fact, they ARE
effects subroutines, and can in turn call on other, lower-level
effects subroutines.

Many Amiga systems have a megabyte or more of RAM, but have only a
single floppy disk drive for permanent storage. Having to load up an
IFF image or sound sample every time they are needed could make for
slow and unpleasant playing of a graphics MUD. To alleviate this, the
MUD client program will cache such items in RAM. This is termed the
"file cache".

The menu item "Effects"/"Show Status" displays the status of the
caches in the client program. Here is a sample of its output:

Files:
  Sounds/clang >0<
  Images/Town/mall >0<
Effects: 4/18>2< 5/18>2< 3/18>10< 2/18>8< 13/240(7) 8/12 20/416(15) 6/112 1/48
Tiles:

Here there are currently two files loaded in the file cache. One is an
image (IFF ILBM) called 'Town/Mall'. The other is a sound sample (IFF
8SVX) called 'clang'. The printed name shows the directory within the
"AmigaMUD:" assign that the file came from. The '>0<' indicates that
there are currently no references to the files, and thus they can be
flushed from the cache as desired. Files can be flushed from the file
cache using the "Effects"/"Free File" menu item, and can also be
flushed by the program itself if it runs out of memory (e.g. to load
in another file). When a file is flushed, the Least Recently Used one
(the one such that all others have been used more recently) is chosen
for flushing. A file cannot be flushed if its reference count is
greater than zero. This will be true while a sound sample is playing,
while a music score is playing, or while an instrument is referenced
by a score in the file cache.

There are nine effects subroutines currently stored in the effects
cache. For each one, the first number displayed (before the '/') is
the unique identifier for the effect. For a given compilation of the
scenario, these numbers will not change. The number after the '/' is
the size in bytes of the effect. The four length-18 effects in the
above display are for the four styles of doors used in the standard
scenario. A following number as in '>2<' shows the number of
references to the effect subroutine from other effects subroutines.
The various doors are used by both the 'streets' and the 'mall'
effects subroutines. A following number as in '(15)' shows the number
of references to other effects subroutines that this effect makes.
The list of effects subroutines is shown in order of the most recently
used one to the least recently used one. Thus, in this case, using the
"Effects"/"Free Effect" item would free the effect with key 1 and size
48. Again, affects with non-zero reference counts cannot be freed.

Freeing an effect is not instantaneous. The server keeps track of
which effects each client has in its cache, so that it knows when it
has to send a copy of an effect to a client. So, when the client wants
to free an effect, it sends a request to the server, which will always
reply in the affirmative. This allows the server to try to keep its
records accurate. It is, however, still possible for the two to get
out of agreement. If the server sends an effect that the client
already has in its cache, the client just ignores the new copy. This
can happen even in proper operation, because of timing issues. If an
effect manages to call an effect that is not in the cache (this should
not happen), the call is ignored.

The "Tiles:" line in the output will currently always show nothing,
since no current scenario uses the tiling facility of the system. When
in use, each entry is simply the numeric identifier of the cached
tile.

The "Effects"/"Zap Effects" menu item sends a request to the server
saying that all of the effects subroutines cached by this client are
to be freed. When the reply gets back to the client, it in turn will
free all of the effects subroutines it has cached. This can be useful
if for some reason, the server and the client seem to get out of
agreement and the proper displays are not appearing. More likely,
however, is a bug in the scenario which is not displaying the scenes
correctly.

There is one circumstance where all of your cached images and brushes
will be removed. This is when you are running MUD with one or two
custom screens (as opposed to in WorkBench windows), and a new
background is loaded which has a different colour palette than the
currently in-use palette. In this situation, the remapping of the
colours of the images and brushes to the active palette becomes
invalid, and needs to be rebuilt. This is currently side-stepped, by
simply removing all of them from the cache, which will cause them to
be reloaded if needed, and remapped at that time. This is arguably the
best solution, since the images as mapped to the current palette may
have lost information from their in-file forms, which can perhaps be
fully utilized if they are remapped against the new palette.
