This file lists the names of the various possible image files, stored
in "AmigaMUD:images/" that the standard scenario will try to access.
Nothing will go wrong if you don't have any or some of these images.
But, those who like pictures in addition to text and the rough drawings
that the scenario produces, might prefer having these images.

Unfortunately, I'm not an artist, so I haven't done many of them. Feel
free to replace the ones I've done, and to do new ones of your own and
send them to me, so that they can be included in future releases. Most
of the images in the V1.1 release were done by Michiel van den Donker.

With the V1.1 release, the system supports a higher resolution display,
and can convert colours from those in the image file to those available
in the display. New images should likely be in a 320 x 200 x 5 size to
be the most useful. MUD only handles IFF ILBM images.

People with non-AGA machines can only use the lower-res 160 x 100 x 5
format, however. Things work best in general if you use the standard
colour palette that the MUD client uses, so that colour conversion
isn't necessary (its slow!), and so that other stuff in the graphics
window doesn't get its colors changed. That palette is:

    0x000,	/* 00 - black */
    0x777,	/* 01 - dark grey */
    0x999,	/* 02 - medium grey */
    0xccc,	/* 03 - light grey */
    0xfff,	/* 04 - white */
    0xd00,	/* 05 - brick red */
    0xf00,	/* 06 - red */
    0xf80,	/* 07 - red-orange */
    0xf90,	/* 08 - orange */
    0xfc0,	/* 09 - gold */
    0xfd0,	/* 10 - cadmium yellow */
    0xff0,	/* 11 - lemon yellow */
    0xbf0,	/* 12 - lime green */
    0x0f0,	/* 13 - green */
    0x8e0,	/* 14 - light green */
    0x2c0,	/* 15 - dark green */
    0x0b1,	/* 16 - forest green */
    0x0bb,	/* 17 - blue green */
    0x0db,	/* 18 - aqua */
    0x1fb,	/* 19 - light aqua */
    0x6fe,	/* 20 - sky blue */
    0x6ce,	/* 21 - light blue */
    0x00f,	/* 22 - blue */
    0x69f,	/* 23 - dark blue */
    0xc1f,	/* 24 - violet */
    0xc0e,	/* 25 - purple */
    0xf99,	/* 26 - flesh */
    0xfad,	/* 27 - pink */
    0xdb9,	/* 28 - tan */
    0xc80,	/* 29 - brown */
    0xa70,	/* 30 - medium brown */
    0xa87	/* 31 - dark brown */

The pens currently used by default in the client are:

    0 - shows up in the borders, due to the Amiga hardware
    1 - initial pen, button letter background, button highlighted letters
    2 - button outer border
    3 - button middle border
    4 - default icon pen, button inner border
    6 - default cursor pen
    9 - button letter colour, button highlighted background colour
    17, 18, 19 - normally used by the pointer (hardware sprite 0)

The pens used by the buttons can be changed, as can those for the cursor
and the icons. (commands 'icon[s]' and 'cursor').

The scenario knows the names of the above set of colours. This is used
for the above commands and in some of the building commands.


Beware that reading this list can give you hints that you might rather
not see!

If you make good images of any of these, just uuencode them and email
them to me. If I include your picture in the next release, you will
get credit for it. Note that the newsroom and the telegram office are
not present in the version of the database included in the release.

I could also use some different icons, especially for the monsters in
the Proving Grounds. All of them are 15 x 15 (leaving space between
them) one-bit-per-pixel images. I need icons for:

    rat, snake, dog, gremlin, wolf, troll, black bear, deer, moose,
    goblin, spider + larger varieties of many

Better version of the icons I already have would be good, too.
