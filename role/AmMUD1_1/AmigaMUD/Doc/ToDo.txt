		    Things That Need to Be Done

Add much more to the scenario. I've got lots of ideas, but I wouldn't
    want to give away any clues!

Add SMUS music output to MUD. (Is there any point in this now? Most
    people use MODs of various formats, rather than IFF SMUS or CMUS.)

Enhancements to parser. E.g. distinguish between 'a'/'an' and 'the' so
    that the player can more easily refer to ambiguous objects.

Would be nice to have online building commands that allow adding
    monsters.

Could have more complex actions on monsters, by having a small textual
    "program" that they follow. Don't want to get too carried away!

Expand the 'castle' tiles example into a full game, or part of the
    standard scenario.
