   You will need to set some of the printing parameters within Workbench
Preferences. These are density, horizontal or vertical aspect, and perhaps
some others if you wish. If you are printing multiple levels that vary
quite a bit in size, the recommended setting on the print requester is
Inches and check the Scale box. More info coming up...
