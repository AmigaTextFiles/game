   This is a tool for gamemasters to take some of the work out of preparing
for their game. It is faster than drawing maps with a ruler by hand. Much
faster if you are content to use some of the randomly generated maps.
   I've included the ability to save your work in IFF format in case you
need to use a paint program to add additional components; or if you have
a color printer and want to add something other than B&W elements.
   Experiment with generating just one level at first. Adjust the width,
height and room parameters until you get a feel for how they affect the
look of the floorplans.
   The Esc key is a way to exit just about any screen and also toggles back
and forth between the control panel and editor.
   The character sheet takes some of the work out of starting up a PC or
NPC. The best thing from my point of view is if a character goes up a
level, you can edit a few items, change the level and print out a new one.
Same goes for a character sheet that wears out. Don't have to copy most of
the stuff over to a new one by hand.
