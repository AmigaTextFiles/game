   Scale has 3 settings. Scale Dungeon, Scale Off, and Scale All. These
control where the scale dots are drawn. Scale dots are there so you can
measure distances while guiding a group of players through a dungeon. Scale
All will fill the entire level with dots. Scale Off will turn dots off
completely (in case you want to print to graph paper). Scale Dungeon will
put dots only where a dungeon graphic is drawn (default). When you are in
the editor screen, use the following keys to set the type of scaling.

F2 - Scale Dungeon

F3 - Scale All

F4 - Scale Off
