   Ranges can be useful if you are working on a dungeon with many levels.
There are 10 ranges available which is probably overkill, but what the
heck. The Range Start and Range End fields are used to set the levels
included in the current range. If these fields cannot be changed, it's
because Nbr Of Levels is set to 1 or the following. The starting level
cannot be greater than the ending level in a range. So you can have a range
of 3 to 7 but not one from 6 to 2. Say you have Nbr Of Levels set for 20
and Current Level set for 1. You set up the first level to be 20 X 20, 10
rooms, and the room minimum and maximum where you want it. If you want the
first 4 levels to be the same, enter 4 in the Range End field. Then click
the Copy To Range button. This saves you the time of setting all the fields
for each individual level. Enter a 2 in the Current Range field and you
could set that for example from levels 5 to 10. By having multiple ranges,
you can make quick changes later if the build process does not go the way
you want and adjustments are needed.
   Just remember to set the Range End field first, then tab or click back
to Range Start and enter the value.

Synopsis:

Range Start and Range End cannot be greater than Nbr Of Levels
Range Start must be less than or equal to Range End
Range End must be greater than or equal to Range Start

Trying to set Range Start before Range End will often result in an error
window popping up since the value entered may be greater than that
currently contained in the Range End field.
