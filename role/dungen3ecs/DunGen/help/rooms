   Nbr Of Rooms determines how many rooms will be drawn in a randomly
generated level. It's pretty good at packing them in. I managed to get 81
2 X 2 rooms in a 45 X 33 dungeon, though it took awhile. If you have a
stock A1200 it could take a long time. Experiment with the default dungeon
size of 33 X 33. Change the number of rooms to say, 23. Build. Repeat this
for several different values. Changing this field can have significant
effect and the overall look and feel of a map. Also see Room Minimum and
Room Maximum.

Minimum number of rooms: 2
Maximum number of rooms: 100
