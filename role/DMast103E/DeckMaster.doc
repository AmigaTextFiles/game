Welcome to DeckMaster!

DeckMaster is a tool for Virtual Realities 2.01D a ShadowRun 2.01D source
book! It aids you designing cyberdecks and makes somehow easier. The program
is easy to understand so i don't explain it here. There is a german version
aswell. The only difference between the german and the english archive is
the missing german guidefile and the translated mainfile! I was to lazy to
translate the guide, but if i get enough feedback i translate it in the next
weeks.

To install copy the font drawer with the mechhq font to FONTS: and the main
program itself to any location you like.
You neew ReqTools.library to run the programm ...

This program is shareware, but it isn't crippled in any form! I don't believe
in keyfiles and i never will. But if i don't get some shareware fee's i stop
supporting this project and i won't start new ones.

The fee is small cause the program is small too:
10DM (about 7 US$)

I think this is ok.
