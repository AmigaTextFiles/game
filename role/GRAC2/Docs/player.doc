                        --------------------------

   Compared to the editor, the player is simple to use. Just put it in the
same directory as the main game file (ending in .grac) and it will run 
automatically when you double click on the game icon.

   The controls are:

   Left mouse                      move the character around,
                                   or select buttons etc.

   Right mouse                     select objects on the main screen, as
                                   left mouse in the control panel.

   Ctrl-c                          quit

   c                               available chip memory

   m                               total memory

   v                               version (should match editor)

   F1 to F10                       load games 1-10

   shift + F1 to F10               save games 1-10

   Note that the save/load system is different to GRAC 1, to allow more
saved games.

   If the gracplayer seems to crash during a game, do not assume that it is
a bug in the program, it is more likely to be a mistake in a script. There 
is, at this time, no checking of scripts at all by the editor or player, so
a wrong value might cause an Amos error and end the program. In this case, 
the only thing to do is note where the error occurred and go back to check
the script in the editor. Missing files could also cause trouble. The best 
way to find missing files is to use Snoopdos, which I have put in the c 
directory of this disk in case you don't have a copy. Just run it from CLI
before starting the game.

Install
-------

   The GRAC install program must be run from the CLI. The usage is

   GRACinstall name_of_GRAC_game

   The name of the GRAC game must include the full path (eg. df0:game). The
game will then be installed to the current directory.
   The best way to use the installer is to write a script, give it an icon
and use iconx. Then the icon can be dragged to the place where the game is
to be installed and double-clicked. I have set up an icon like this to 
install Lethal Formula.

Making a bootable disk
----------------------

   The easiest way to do this is to use the supplied demo and delete all of
the files that you don't need from the disk. Then save your game onto the
disk, having copied all necessary files (the ones starting with GRAC) and
set the paths to the appropriate places. You will have to modify the install
script to suit your own game. It is hard to give exact instructions because
every game will be different but it will help if you have some understanding
of how Workbench operates.

Running a GRAC game from AMOS
-----------------------------

You should use the program gracplayer.a, renamed to gracplayer

In the program, enter:

command line$="name of your game"
run "gracplayer"
