GRAC 2.0 - New features
-----------------------

Here is a brief list of the new features in GRAC 2.0. More complete
descriptions are given in the main documentation files.

* Complete incompatibility with GRAC 1.0 and 1.1. This was unavoidable.
  However, it is possible to convert between them, with a suitable program.
  See the 'readme' file for details of obtaining this program.

* Support for IFF animations.

* Close-ups (also used for map screens).

* Fast character scaling for realistic perspective.

* Player can control any character, and switch between them. The program now
  'remembers' the location of all the characters, so that they will still
   be in a room if the player leaves and reenters.

* New verb type : QUICK - has immediate effect when the verb button is
  pressed, not requiring an object to be selected.

* Animate characters from within text strings.

* New script commands:

   play anim          - plays animation
   limbo              - clears everything from memory to make room for large
                        animations
   flash              - flash colours       
   fade picture       - fade out a picture
   toggle flag        - switch flag from 1 to 0 or vice-versa
   scroll on          - allow automatic scrolling
   scroll off         - disable scrolling
   scroll             - scroll the screen
   switch             - switch between characters
   control palette    - change the palette used by the control panel
   fade control       - fade the control palette
   close up           - go to close-up
   exit close up      - leave close-up
   clear flags        - set all flags within a range to zero
   cycle              - colour cycling
   cycle off          - stop colour cycling
   save off           - disable save game facility
   save on            - allow save game
   verb off           - disable a verb
   verb on            - allow verb to be used
   walk off           - stop the character from moving
   walk on            - allow the character to move
   compare            - new compare instruction, replaces all other compares
   pause              - new form of timer
   pause off          - cancel pause
   anim               - alternative to amal
   set mark           - place a mark for use with 'goto mark'
   goto mark          - goto the stated mark
   perspective        - activate character scaling
   scale              - set the size of all characters in a room.
   static             - speed up the display in rooms with a lot of objects
   position voice     - allows speech in close-ups and pictures

* Improved script editor.

   Scripts can now be any length, and are edited as in any text editor,
   i.e. press return to insert a new line, backspace to delete, arrow keys
   or mouse to move the cursor.
   Commands are entered in one of the following formats:

      command  first parameter,second parameter
      command  parameter
      command

   A flag can be entered as a parameter using the # symbol, e.g.

      compare  #16,1

   would replace the old instruction

      compare value   16            1

   There are several preset variables to make it easier to enter parameters.
   These are:

      room            - indicates the current room 
      item            - the selected inventory item
      pc              - the players character
      entrance        - the last entrance
      gtime           - global time; time elapsed since the start of the
                        game
      rtime           - room time; time elapsed since the room was loaded
      current         - background/foreground/inventory item/character
                        associated with the script
      string          - string associated with selected object
      height          - height of the selected object

   A comment can be inserted in a script using the * character, like this:

      * Put the comment here.

   The function keys now have different uses. F2 to move to the next script,
   F1 to move to the previous script. HELP functions as before. DEL deletes
   the current line. Shift-up moves up one page, shift-down moves down one
   page.

* 32 background objects allowed per room (rather than 16)

* When selecting verbs for actions, the script numbers are printed in the
  requester so you can see at glance which verbs have associated scripts.

* The GRACplayer now prints text in two lines instead of one. I think this
  looks better but some text in old games may need to be rearranged a bit.

* A button to change the text colour.

* Finally, a new mouse pointer (the AMOS one was getting on my nerves).

   All this takes memory of course; the GRACeditor is now about 40K larger,
and the GRACplayer is 30K larger. When crunched on disk the increases are
much less. The extra memory requirement is offset by the fact that text
strings can now be stored in the room files and loaded only when needed.
Therefore, you won't have to cut down a project if it is pushing the 
memory limits, just relocate the text.
