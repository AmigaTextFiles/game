                         [Version 1.0]

this game is a simulation of a life a computerfreak in the year 2103 and
later. his only contents in life is the computer. he has a CommLink-Jack,
which he need to be connected to a computer and to melt with it to
enter one computersystem in the computernet, it's like an own world.
it's important to get money. you can do programming jobs for firms
or steal and sell information of the computernet. second method has higher
risks, but it's the faster way to get money. think of, if you died
in the computersystem, you can't get back, you are a unit of energy in
the computernet. Life is't easy.

@endnode

@node Spiel "what's my job ?"

first you have to do is getting agood computerdeck. you have to buy the
components, so you should first get some money by doing programming jobs.
if he think he has a good computerdeck, he should enter the  computernet.
he walks through nodes, search in datastores for information, load them
and sell it to the dealer. different components are important, here is
a list and a description of the elements.

@node Installation "Installation"

playing from harddisk:
  dopple click the icon of the installationprogram and follow
  the instructions. then dopple click the program icon.

playing from disk:
  you need one diskvolume, which every `normal' Aniga has. but it would
  be better, if you have more of it. 
  dopple click the icon of the installationprogram and follow the
  instructions. you need 4 diskettes to play. the main disk must be
  writeable.

@endnode

@node Steuerung "control"

you controlling he game with your mouse. you can control the
requester also by the number 1..9, j/n and RETURN, depends on the
type of requester. if you entered the computersystem, you control
the walking with the numberblock. the 5 is a special key.
when you killed all SE in a node, you can push the 5 to get a special
requester.

@{"  " Link Ablauf} action order in the computersystem

@endnode

@node Ablauf "action order in the computersystem"

action order in the computersystem :

 1. you enter the computersystem in a login-node.
 2. you enter a node, the analysing program will be startet, if its loaded
    to the memory.
 3. if SE are in the node, a fight will start. now you can use most of the
    programs.
 4. if all SE are killed, you can push the 5 to get a special menu.
    if the ndoe is a datastore, you can search for information and
    evaluate them, if it isn't done while you are fighting. you are
    able to load the information.
 5. with keys on numberblock you can go in this direction.

@endnode

@node VorComputersystem "before entering a computersystem"

before entering a computersystem, you have to load the programs to the
harddisk and some important to the memory. only programs loaded to the
memory are useable. in the computersystem you can only load programs
from the harddisk to the memory.

programs, you have loaded, will be again on your harddisk/memory, when
you entering again a computersystem.

you have to load the programs before entering the computersystem.
its important to have them loaded to the memory, because when you
entering the computersystem, it's possible, that SE are attacking.
the minimum to play is a attack- or a slow-program and a browse-program
to searrch for information.

@endnode

@node Haendler "the dealer"

This person is the most important person. he sells to you the hardware
and buys from you the information out of the computernet. every day, you
didn't sell the information, the value of it will decrease.
programs, you can buy, depends on your computerdeck, because you can't run a
attack-15 on a computerdeck, which has a persona of 3, cause you can't
have enough memory in this computerdeck. you can reach the dealer
only once a day.
the dealer is a nice person, but a dealer. if you buy very often
hardware or software, it will get cheaper for you. if you visit him and
buys nothing, the prices will rise next time, but the price can only
be doubled or halved.

@endnode

@node Computerdeck "the computerdeck"

the computerdeck is a computer, which was especially designed to enter
the computernet. a person needs a CommLink-jack in the head and you
gets the level of the computerdeck. the computerdeck consists of
some components with different function.

1. persona : the most important part of the computerdeck. the double of
             its level is the maximal reaction you can install. you
             can raise it only stepwise, from level 3 to level 4.
             the level multiplied with 100 is the maximal memory, you
             can install. programs, the dealer sells, is between
             persona/2 and persona*2. it should be high, but not
             to high.
2. strength : its a characteristic to defend against damage. the higher
              the strength, the simpler you can defeat damage, but a high
              level didn't defend dullness. it can raised by program ARMOR.
3. reaction : it is a value for your number of fighting attacks.
              the higher the reaction, the higher he number of attacks.
              it is limited by he persona.
4. memory : you can only use the programs loaded to the memory. some
            programs give you the bonus automatically. you can only load
            programs from the gharddisk to the memory. the maximum is
            limited by the persona.
5. harddisk : Medium for all programs. you can load programs to you harddisk
              and from there to you memory. also information, you find in the
              net, are stored on the harddisk. it must be as high as possible.
6. body : it is a threshold for SE to hit you. the higher the body, the harder
          to be hit.
7. masking : it is needed to walk around in the net and not to be found
             by SE. if you attack something in te net, you will be
             automatically seen.
8. dodge : it is needed for fighting against a damage.
9. language : this tool will give you a bonus when programming. the
              level is the bonus you get. at the beginning only the
              internal language exists.

@node Geld "How to earn money ?"

here will the most important question answered. How to earn money ?
there are three ways to earn money.

1. you look for commissions of firms, program it and get the money.
   if you need to much time to program, the firm will cancel the
   commission and you will get no money. for programming you need
   the skill software. bonus from programming langauge.
2. enter the computernet and stealth information in datastores.
   you won't get the whole value, if you sell it to the dealer.
3. for registert users: you send a letter with to me with 10.-DM,
   your datas, the originaldisk als the money you will get.
   (< 1.000.000.-). you will get thisdisk and with a new version and
   the same registration number.

@endnode

@node Programme "programs in the computerdeck"

think of the situation, that you can only use programs, that are loaded
to he memory. programs on the harddisk can be loaded to memory.
some programs give the bonus automatically sign with (*).
you have to get much harddisk and memory as possible.

 1. Analyse     - it is used for analysing all thing in the computernet
 2. Attack      - attackutility, you can attack all SE-types
 3. Descramble  - attackutility against the ScramleSE
 4. Medic       - utility to the reduce the damage. damage influences
                  reaction and attacks, but not damageresistence
 5. Slow        - it reduces the level of Fight-SE or Access-SE
 6. Evaluate    - it analyse the value of information
 7. Armor (*)   - increase the strength
 8. Repair      - repairing program utility
 9. Schild (*)  - reduces damage
10. Sleaze      - to deactivate Access-SE
11. Browse      - to look for information in datastores
12. Mirror (*)  - increase masking
13. Deception   - to deactivate Fight-SE
14. Confusion   - to confuse Killer-/Fight-SE

@endnode

@node Computersystem "the computernet"

the compternet consists many computersystems, each comptersystem
belongs to different firms. most firms saves their important data
in the computersystem, you can get them and sell it. a computersystem
have different nodes. Each computersystem has these nodes:

loginnode, where you login
centralnode, it controlls the whole system

and other nodes are:

datastores  : you can find information
subunitnode : no special function
controlnode : control processes out of the computersystem in the real world

if you enter a node in the computersystem, the analyse-program will start
automatically, if you have loaded teh program into the memory. if it has
success, it will display the information of the node.
a node consists of a color and a number, the color is the typ and the
number the level.
colors are:
green  - public node
yellow - simple node
orange - standard node
red    - security node
brown  - super security node
the value of information in a datastore is computed by the color
and the level. the higher the bigger the value.

it is clear, that there are different defensetools. they are called
securitysystems (SE). the different forms are Protect-,Fight- and
Killer-SE. Protect-SE are Access, Barrier-, Check- oder Report-SE.
they didn't attack you, they activates other SE and try to start alert.
the times alert means, that all people are dropped of the computersystem

to protect information in a datastore Scramble-SE are used. three times
are known. Conceal-, Hide- and Scramble-SE. you can'þ attack them,
but you can kill them with a Descrambleprogram.

the Fight-SE are splitted to Hunter-, Soldier-, Defense-, Attack- and
Killer-SE. some of them can better fight, some better defeat.
they are mostly activated by Protect-SE.
types of the Killer-SE are Hitman-, Blaster-, Murderer- and Burn-SE
with different functions. Murderer-SE attacks programs in the memory,
Burn-SE attacks programs in the harddisk.

the number of SE are limited. in a datastore you can find only one
Scramble-SE, in a node only two Protect-SE and three Fight-SE. In every
computersystem are maximal 10 Killer-SE.

in a fight you should kill first the Killer-SE, cause they make
critical damage.

if in a node are some SE, you can't load information to ypur harddisk
of you computerdeck from a datastore.

@endnode

@node Fertigkeiten "soft- und hardware"

the skills you need is software and hardware. software is needed for
programming. it can be increased by language. hardware is used for
installing components. if the installation fails, the component is
killed, if the strength of you computerdeck didn't helps.

@endnode

@node Speicherung "saving the game"

for all people, who likes to save after every turn, which was ok,
i have inclueded a random-save-routine. you can try to change
the save-file, but first i have to say. there exists three different
saveroutines, which are randomly chosen.

@endnode

@node Registrierung "SHAREWARE - registration"

the program is fully funktional, it mean, that you can play with the
sharewareversion two "game"-years, than you can get a registered
version and continue your play.

how to register ?

fill the registerform and send it to me.

1. send a letter with 20.-DM, if you live in germany.
2. if you didn't live in germany, send 25 DM or 20 USDollar.

               save.dat (after you saved a game)

2. are all files exists, check, if not an other programs are responsible
   for the crash.

3. if it doesn'þ work more than one time, send a description of it to me and
   i will help you.

4. did you changed some files, than install it again.

5. the program didn't start, after you have played a while. get a registert
