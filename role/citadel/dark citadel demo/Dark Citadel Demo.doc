About Dark Citadel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dark  Citadel  is  a speech adventure for anyone who likes their adventures
with  lots  of puzzles and a little humour.  It is not like all those other
adventure  games  where  your  character  gets killed every time you make a
simple  mistake.   In  this game, if you try to do something really stupid,
the  very worst you'll get is a witty remark from our little hero.  So what
are you waiting for ?  Your quest awaits you !


The Story So Far...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The lovely Ysadora has fallen under an evil spell.  She has been found by a
brave  young  knight  named  Marlon, and returned to her father, the wizard
Gnaxar.   Alas,  his  powers  can  do nothing to reverse the effects of the
spell  affecting  his  daughter,  but  he  tells  Marlon  the location of a
powerful  elixir,  which will surely save her.  So, taking with him only an
amulet,  given  to  him by Gnaxar, which will enable him to use any magical
items he might find, the knight sets off on his quest for the elixir, which
lies hidden within the magical Dark Citadel.


Installing onto a Hard Drive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If  you  have  enough  memory  available you can run Dark Citadel from hard
drive.

To  install  Dark  Citadel,  just  double  click on the HD Install icon and
follow the on screen prompts.  When asked to enter the path where you would
like the game to be installed, simply type in the location of the directory
where you usually keep your games.  (eg.  Work:Games)

The  installer will then create a new drawer in your selected directory and
install the game into it.


Loading Dark Citadel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dark  Citadel  will  run  on  any  Amiga  with at least 1 Mb of chip memory
(graphics memory) and a PAL display.

To load the game, simply double click on the Dark Citadel icon.

Once the program has loaded, there will be an intro before the title screen
appears.   You  can speed through this intro by pressing the fire button on
the joystick, or you can skip it entirely by pressing the Esc key.

If  you  have an extra disk drive, this can be used to load the level disks
while the game disk remains in your internal drive.  This will allow you to
save your games onto the game disk without further disk swapping.

Upto  10  saved  games  can  be  stored  on your game disk.  If this is not
enough,  you  can  use  another disk to save 10 more games.  To do so, just
format a disk and create a directory on it called SavedGames (nb.  no space
between  words).   Then,  before selecting save game, simply insert the new
disk in place of the game disk.


Title Screen Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The title screen has the following options, all of which can be accessed by
moving  the  pointer  up  and  down  with the joystick and pressing fire to
select.

START QUEST - Starts the game from the very beginning.

LOAD SAVED GAME - Loads a previously saved game and continues play from the
                  point at which it was saved.

CREDITS - Displays credits and program details.

QUIT - Exits the game.


Playing Dark Citadel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before  each  level  a  page will appear telling you about this part of the
adventure.   When you have read the text, and are ready to start exploring,
just press the fire button.

The game screen is split into 3 sections:-

The  top  section  of the screen displays the inventory (whatever Marlon is
currently carrying with him).  A maximum of 8 objects can be carried.

The  large  area  in the centre of the screen is your view of Marlon in the
Citadel.  Here you can control his movements with the joystick.

The bottom part of the screen shows the action icons.

Pressing  the  joystick  button allows you to access the action icons.  The
joystick  can  then  be  used to move the yellow box along the windows, and
between  the  action  icons and inventory.  A further press on the joystick
button will select the action, or object, currently indicated.

When  an  item in the inventory is selected it will be indicated by a green
box,  and the yellow box will return to the action icons, so that an action
can also be selected.


Action Icons
~~~~~~~~~~~~
From left to right, the action icons do the following:-

LOOK/EXAMINE - Look at whatever is directly in front of Marlon. If an object
               from the inventory has been selected, then Marlon will examine
               that instead.

GET/DROP - Pick up whatever is in front of Marlon, or drop an object if one
           has been selected from the inventory.

OPERATE/USE - Operate whatever is ahead of Marlon, or use the currently
              selected object on whatever is ahead or on its own.

EAT/DRINK - Eat/drink whatever our hero is facing, or eat/drink an item
            selected from the inventory. Objects usually need to be carried
            and selected to be eaten or drunk.

RETURN TO JOYSTICK CONTROL - Return to joystick control of Marlon.

GAME OPTIONS - Enter game options screen.


Game Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~
When  you  select  the disc icon on the main game screen you will presented
with another screen which has 3 game options:-

SAVE - This will bring up a list of the 10 slots where games in progress can
       be saved. Those slots which are currently empty will be shown in grey,
       whilst any that have already been used will be shown in black. Of
       course, you may choose to overwrite a slot that has previously been
       used. The letter 'C' at the end of the list of slots stands for
       'Cancel' and selecting this will abort the save.

QUIT - Quits the game and returns to the title screen. Beware - Once this
       has been selected there is no way to return to the game that you were
       playing, unless you have saved the game first.

CANCEL - Returns to the game in progress.


Hints and Tips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Don't be afraid to try things out.  Remember that Marlon is the star of the
game, and like all really good heroes, he won't get killed.

Nothing  that you can do will leave you unable to finish the game, so don't
give  up  and  start  again, just have another look at the objects that are
available, and hopefully, something will give you a clue.

Try  looking at and operating everything.  Maybe something will be revealed
that was previously hidden.

Remember that simply looking at an object, is not the same as picking it up
and  examining it.  eg.  Looking at a book lying ahead of Marlon will cause
him  to  simply describe it as a book.  Whereas, when carried and examined,
Marlon  might  actually be able to read it.  In other instances, Marlon may
notice  something  about the object examined, which will give you a clue as
to its possible use.
