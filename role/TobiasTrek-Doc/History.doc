     A Brief History

  On the date of 9,8,1966 the very first episode of STAR TREK was shown
on American Network Television. This of course was the fore runner of
the now world famous TV series. The costs in preparation of this series
were considered at that time to be the most expensive.
  The TV series' ratings weren't exactly as what was expected during
the years of '66 -'68 and the Networks began considering "shelving" the
series. But through many thousands of letters, from many viewers, the
series was saved and placed into the night-time viewing period. After
one year in this "evening" time frame, it proved to quite successful
for an outside company's effort in showing this series to the public
nationally on TV. Today, there are very few countries that haven't seen
"STAR TREK".
  After many years of talk and discussions, an agreement came into
being between PARAMONT and others into making a series of movies based
on the original TV series.  This first movie "STAR TREK: The Movie",
was the most expensive, costing 40 million to produce and was released
in 1979.
  Over the next ten years four other movies have been produced, they
are:
STAR TREK II  The Wrath of Khan   
STAR TREK III  The Search For Spock   
STAR TREK IV  The Voyage Home   and finally 
STAR TREK V  The Final Frontier.

In all five films, Paramont has been successful in keeping all of the
now world famous STAR TREK characters intack and as a complete group.
In effect, you were able to not loose contact with the original
character from the TV series. The main characters of the series were:
Captain Kirk - William Shatner, Science Officer Spock - Leonard Nimoy,
Dr McCoy (bones) - Deforest Kelly, Helmsman Chekov - Walter Koenic,
Navigator Sulu - George Takei, Chief Engineer Scott - James Doohan,
Communications Officer Uhura - Nichelle Nichols.
  Just recently in the last few years there has been a new series on
American National Television.  STAR TREK  The Next Generation, this
series has all new characters, a brand new Enterprise, but retains the
flavour of the old TV series. In the fall of 1990, this new series
possibly will be viewed by European "Trekkies". Again as in the
original series, the main writer is Gene Roddenberry. He's very
involved with the new series just as he was with the movies and the
original TV series. The success of the original TV series brought forth
a large following of "Trekkies". I hope this new series doesn't turn
any of them away, but instead brings out more.
  The love for this TV series was emphasized quite strongly by the
people of United States. Thousands of letters were sent to the
President Of The United States (at that time period) suggesting that
the name ENTERPRISE be put on the first space shuttle that NASA was to
successfully launch.
 
     Monolog

  It took me two years to write this game. Halfway through though, I
seriously thought about quiting as I was loosing interest. I couldn't
see any end to this game as it will continue endlessly. But now it's
finally finished and I'm happy with what I've done. The actual game
code is about 160 K long. My source code for the game is 512 K long.
  There are two versions on this diskette. A 512 K version, and a 1 Meg
version. The 512 K version has many of the non-esential sounds removed
so that 512 K owners can play the game. The 1 Meg version is just as I
originally wrote, unchanged. The 1 Meg version will check your
computers memory and if there's room will ask if it can copy the "data
disk" into ram. This makes the game much faster and much more
enjoyable.
  This game was written with the program AZTEC 3.06 in "C" and some
assembly language as well.
  At this point I would like to thank the following people.  Special
thanks goes to Thomas Kruja whose abilities helped make this game what
it is. My thanks to Silvia, Tanja, and Guido. THey all gave me good
input as to the content of this game. STAR TREK: The Game is played
100% with the mouse, but also a joystick is needed in port #2 for
manouvering the Enterprise.
