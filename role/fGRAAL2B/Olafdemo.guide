@{i}Ce que le jeu necessite@{ui}

Le jeu necessite 2MB de RAM.

Les tests ont marchés sur ECS (A600) et AGA (A1200) avec le
Workbench 2.05 et 3.0, avec et sans accelerateur et fast RAM.  Je
ne garantie pas qu'il fonctionnera bien avec des vieilles versions
du Workbench. 

Recommandé: Un A1200 ou mieux - Sur de vieilles machines, c'est plus lent
Bien sur c'est nettement mieux d'avoir un disque dur :-)


@{i}Utilisateurs de disquettes:@{ui}

 1. Lancez (=bootez) le Workbench. 

 2. Ayez une disquette, vierge formaté prete pour sauvegarder

 3. Inserez la disquette A. Double-clickez sur l'icone disque, puis sur
    l'icone GRAAL_2 pour charger le jeu.


@{i}Utilisateurs de Disque Dur:@{ui}

 1. Copiez tous les fichiers dans le même tiroir du disque dur. Verifiez
    que le tiroir FONTS: sur le disk A soit copié proprement. Ne vous
    inquietez pas si des fichiers sont en double, c'est pour eviter le
    changement frequent de disks

 2. Ouvrez le tiroir du disque dur et cliquez sur GRAAL_2 pour lancer le
    jeu.

 3. Les sauvegardes seront dans le meme tiroir.


@{i}NOTE! Bug connu !!!@{ui}

Bien, ve n'est pas un gros bug - plutot qqc d'enervant, en fait. Sur
certaine machines vous ne pouvez utiliser un son de warning dans les Prefs
du WB. En general, les programmes compilés en AMOS Pro, n'arretent pas de
le jouer.

La solution est simple - Coupez le son dans les Prefs.

@{i}Trouble-shooting@{ui}

Olaf a été testé avec differents peripheriques sans problemes.

Si jamais unprobleme persistait essayez de

* Re-bootez! Olaf est plus heureux sur une machine 'propre'

* Enlevez les commoditées qui pourrait être genantes: Screen blankers, mouse
  blankers, horloges, application launchers...

* Eteignez les extensions hardware: carte acceleratrices, PCMCIA, etc.

@{u}WELCOME TO 950 A.D.!@{uu}

The Vikings were a truly adventurous breed. So what could be more
natural than casting a Viking as the big hero of a computer adventure?
Nothing. And so we did!

Our hero is Olaf Longhair - a rather short and rather fat Viking from
just outside the town of Birka in the Baltic Sea. Like many fellow
countrymen, he has steered his longship eastwards on the Russian rivers
to find fame and fortune in the Middle East.

However, as our story opens, Olaf finds himself alone in the town of
Constantinople (Miklagård to the Vikings). The ultimate goal of the
completed  adventure is to find your way back to Sweden. The aim of the
game in the demo  is simply to find out  where to go from Constantinople
and then find some way  to do so!

If you have played any of the now classic adventures, such as the Indy
games or Monkey Island, you should soon come to grips with how the game
works.

@{u}PLAYING THE GAME@{uu}


@{i}The Basics@{ui}

The screen is normally divided into two main parts: The upper part is
the scene area, and the lower part is the command area. (During some
scenes, the command area is not shown, and you just click in the  scene
area to make things happen.)

You guide Olaf through the game world by giving him commands. Commands
are constructed by combining one of the nine available verbs, shown in
the command area, with one or two objects. Objects are found in the
inventory (to the right of the command verbs in the scene area) and in
the scene area - whenever you move the mouse cursor over an object in
the scene area, its name appears above the cursor.

By clicking a verb or an object with the left mouse button, you
"transfer" it to the sentence box at the very top of the command area.
You may click the verbs and objects in any order. If a certain verb and
object combination requires that you select a second object on which to
operate, a preposition (connecting word) is shown in the command area,
and the game does not try to act on the sentence until a second object
has been clicked. For example, if you click the verb "USE" and then the
object "SMALL KNIFE" (which is in the inventory from the very start of
the game), the sentence box read "USE SMALL KNIFE ON" and waits for you
to click on the object on which to use the small knife.

When a sentence is complete, it is highlighted, and the mouse cursor
temporarily disappears while the system acts on the command. When it is
time for you to take control again, the sentence is erased, and the
cursor re-appears.

Note 1: When there are more objects in the inventory than can be
displayed at the same time, arrows appear next to the inventory list. It
can be scrolled up or down by clicking on the arrows with the left mouse
button.

Note 2: The verb buttons are also mapped to the numeric keypad (1-9),
and the diskette icon is mapped to key 0 on the keypad.


@{i}Walking about@{ui}

If you wish to move Olaf to another place in the room, point to the
desired spot with the cursor and click the right mouse button. Olaf
walks to the closest possible point.

Some locations are so big you can't see all of them at the same time. If
you make Olaf walk close to the edge of the screen, the "camera" will
automatically follow him, revealing more of the background scenery (if
there is any).


@{i}Making an Exit@{ui}

Apart from the objects in the scene area, there are also one or more
exits from each location ("room") in the game. When you move the cursor
over an exit, a text appears above the cursor specifying where it leads.
(The colour of the exit names are not the same as for the object names,
so it is easy to tell them apart.)

Just click with the left mouse button on an exit to make Olaf use it.


@{i}Talking with people@{ui}

You will spend lots of time talking with other people you encounter in
the game. Usually, a conversation is started by using the command "TALK
TO object" (where the object would normally be a person:-) . Sometimes,
another command or walking into a particular spot also makes you engage
in a conversation.

Talking with people is easy: The ordinary command area disappears and is
replaced with a dialogue area, where all lines available to Olaf are
shown.

Click the left mouse button on a line, watch Olaf speak it, and await
the response. Usually, each time you get a response, the set of
available lines changes. If there are more than four alternatives
available, arrows appear next to the list of lines. The list can then be
scrolled by clicking the arrows with the left mouse button.


@{i}Cutscenes@{ui}

At some stages, the game goes into a fully automatic mode requiring no
input from you. You will be treated to short animated scenes telling
part of the story and setting the scene for things to come. Such scenes
are called cutscenes. During most of them, a movie camera icon is shown
instead of the nine command verbs in the command area. Sometimes, the
command area disappears completely, making the display more
"movie-like".

When you have played a certain part of the game a couple of times, you
may wish to skip these cutscenes, since they are always the same. In
most cases, you can do this by pressing the [Esc] key. Some cutscenes
actually consist of a number of consecutive cutscenes, som you may have
to press [Esc] several times to skip to the part you wish to go to.

@next "Keys"
@prev "Playing"


@{u}SAVING, LOADING AND QUITTING@{uu}

If you are running from diskettes, make sure you have a blank, formatted
diskette ready to use for saved games.

When in normal command mode, click the Diskette icon in the command
area.  After a short while, the save/load/quit/score screen appears. If
you are in the middle of a dialogue, or the command area is hidden,
press the keypad [0] key to call up the screen instead. (Note that this
may take a while, and the only indication that you have called it in
this case is that the mouse cursor has gone away!)

There are six numbered "slots" where games can be saved. These are shown
on the right hand side of the picture. Any slots currently occupied by
saved games are shown with embossed numbers. If you click on an occupied
slot, both the load and the save button lights up. If you click a vacant
slot, only the save button lights up.

Use the "Back" button to go back to the previous location. 

Use the "Quit" button to quit the game. A requester appears, asking you
to confirm the action. You must enter "y" and press Enter for the quit
command to take effect.

@{u}HINTS AND TIPS@{uu}


 * To skip the introductory scene, you must press the Esc key three
   times: 

   - When the Performance logo screen appears.

   - When the scene inside Olaf's house appears.
  
   - When the bar in Constantinople appears.
 
 * Pick up everything you can get your hand on. Sooner or later,
   chances are you will need it.

 * You must often talk to the same  character several times to get all
   the information available. Things you observe or other conversations

   may give you new dialogue alternatives when talking to others.

 * When you get stuck, try to think about all the objects you have and
   have seen, and think about new ways to combine them. Search through 
   all accessible locations again to see if you have missed any
   objects.

 * Look at everything closely. Close examination often reveal
   astonishing things, and may also give you additional material for 
   dialogues with other characters.

 * It is very hard to get Olaf killed. Don't be afraid to experiment!
