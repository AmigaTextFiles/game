"There's a strange sound"
"The name of the book is -Treasure Island-.
There's a word engraved in the flyleaf -yoho-
and a message -Long John Silver left 2 treasures on Treasure Island!-"
"Nothing happens."
"There's something there alright. Maybe I should"
"That's not very safe."
"You may need magic here"
"Everything spins around and suddenly you are elsewhere..."
"Torch is lit"
"I was wrong. I guess its not a mongoose cause the snakes bit it."
"I'm snake bit"
"Parrot attacks snakes and drives them off"
"Pirate won't let me"
"Its locked"
"Its open"
"There are a set of plans in it"
"Not while I'm carrying it"
"Crocs stop me"
"Sorry I can't."
"Wrong game you silly goose!"
"I don't have it"
"Pirate grabs rum and scuttles off chortling"
"...I think its me. Hee Hee."
"Its nailed to the floor!"
"-magic word- Ho and a ...   (Work on it. You'll get it)"
"No. Something is missing!"
"It was a tight squeeze!"
"Something won't fit"
"Since nothing is happening"
"I slipped and fell..."
"Something falls out"
"They're plans to build jolly roger (a pirate ship!)
You'll need hammer, nails, lumber, anchor, sails and keel."
"I've no container"
"It soaks into the ground"
"Too dry. Fish vanish."
"Pirate awakens. Says -Aye matey we be casting off soon-
He then vanishes"
"What a waste..."
"I've no crew"
"Pirate says -Aye matey we be needing a map first-"
"After a month at sea we set anchor off of a sandy beach.
All ashore who's going ashore..."
"Try -WEIGH ANCHOR-"
"There's a map in it"
"It's a map to Treasure Island. At the bottom it says
        -30 paces and then dig!-"
" * Welcome to -PIRATES ADVENTURE- by Scott & Alexis Adams *"
"Its empty"
"I've no plans!"
"open it?"
"go there?"
"I found something!"
"I didn't find anything"
"I don't see it here"
"Ok I walked off 30 paces."
"Congratulations !!!
 But your adventure is not over yet..."
"Reading expands the mind"
"The parrot crys"
"-Check the bag matey-"
"-Check the chest matey-"
"from the other side!"
"Open the book!"
"There's multiple exits here!"
"Crocs eat fish and leave"
"I'm underwater. I can't swim. Blub blub..."
"-Pieces of eight-"
"Its stuck in the sand"
"Use 1 word"
"Pirate says -Aye matey we be waiting for the tide to come in-"
"The tide is out"
"The tide is coming in."
"About 20 pounds. Try -SET SAIL-"
"-Tides a changing matey-"
"Note here -I be liking parrots. They be smart matey-"
"Pirate follows you ashore as if he is waiting for something."
