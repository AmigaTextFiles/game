		Using and Installing Amiga NetHack 3.1
      (or Everything You Never Wanted to Know Before NetHacking)

	     Last Revision: 28 January 1993 for NetHack 3.1


I. Introduction

I.A. Overview
    Welcome to Amiga NetHack!  If this is your first visit to our fair
    city, you are in for an amazing and dangerous journey; if you have
    visited us before, beware! the city has changed in many strange and
    subtle ways; it has also grown quite a bit.  This missive brings to
    light those mundane tasks which must be dealt with before beginning
    your journey; for those of you who are faced with the task of
    installing the pre-fabricated version of our town, section III
    (Installing Amiga NetHack 3.1) will guide you through the task at
    hand.  If you are ready to visit, the local visitors guide is in
    section II (Using Amiga NetHack 3.1); please also see the general
    guide packaged separately (the file GuideBook).

    To all our visitors, a hearty Welcome! - and please be careful.

I.B. Getting Help
    If you have questions about strategy, weapons, or monsters, the best
    place to go for help is the Usenet newsgroup rec.games.hack.  If you
    have problems with installation or think you have found a bug in
    the game, please report it by electronic mail to the development
    group at nethack-bugs@linc.cis.upenn.edu, where it will be routed
    to the appropriate person.  Include your configuration, the version of
    NetHack you are playing, and as much specific information as possible.
    As NetHack runs on many different machines, be sure to mention that
    you are playing the Amiga version.  Finally, if you are having trouble
    compiling NetHack, you may use the same address, or, for compiler
    specific problems, send mail to:
    	Greg Olson (golson@sundown.sun.com)  for Manx
    	Ken Lorber (keni@oasys.dt.navy.mil) for SAS/C, or
    	Richard Addison (addison@pollux.usc.edu) for either.
    We do not currently have a contact for the DICE port.

I.C. Credits
    Olaf Seibert first ported NetHack 2.3 and 3.0 to the Amiga.  Richard
    Addison, Jochen Erwied, Mark Gooderum, Ken Lorber, Greg Olson, Mike
    Passaretti, and Gregg Wonderly polished and extended the 3.0 and 3.1
    ports.


II. Using Amiga NetHack 3.1

II.A. Sources of Information
    Where to go depends on what you want to find out.  If you want to find
    out about distributing NetHack, read the license (in NetHack:license or
    type ?i during the game).  For an introduction to NetHack, read the
    GuideBook file.  Finally, for information during the game on all kinds
    of things, type ? and select from the menu.

II.B. The Amiga NetHack WorkBench Front End
    The Amiga NetHack Front End looks more or less like a WorkBench
    Drawer - and acts the same way.  Games start with double clicks and
    menus provide more detailed control of games and defaults.  On-line
    help is available - just press the help key.

    Just as with WorkBench itself, options for games are set using the Info
    menu item to modify Tooltypes.  Most common options can be set more 
    easily using buttons available via Info also.

    You can adjust the following using the ToolTypes from the Info command:

	* OPTIONS=<options> - Options as available in the NetHack.cnf file.

	* HACKDIR=<directory> - Set NetHack working directory to be this
	  directory.

	* LEVELS=<levels> - Intermediate level saving device/directory.

	* PATH=<path> - To search for files such as rumors, help, etc.

	* CMDLINE=<args> - Arguments as passed on the CLI command line.
	  Note:  only the following flags are valid: n, X, D, and r.

	* SCORE <options> - Display the record of scores.  Options as
	  available on the CLI command line after a -s flag.

    Note that the NetHack.cnf file is read first, then the ToolTypes.  This
    means that the options specified in the NetHack.cnf act as defaults
    which can be overridden by an individual's personal icon's ToolTypes.
    Thus the system oriented entries (HACKDIR, LEVELS, and PATH) should
    generally be set only in NetHack.cnf.  NetHack.cnf should have default
    values for OPTIONS, which will generally be overridden by ToolTypes
    entries.

    Also, there is one additional option that may be specified in the
    NetHack.cnf file or on an OPTIONS line: flush.  When enabled, flush
    discards all characters in the queue except the first, which limits
    typeahead accidents.  The default setting is noflush.

    Usually, most of the confusing options will be set in the NetHack.cnf
    file once when the game is installed and can be ignored after that.

II.C. The Amiga NetHack CLI Front End
    The CLI Front End provides the standard Unix-like command line interface
    to NetHack.  Unlike the Unix front end however, the CLI front end will
    ask if you want to play again before exiting.  See the ManPage file for
    the standard Unix flags for NetHack.  In addition to those flags, Amiga
    NetHack accepts flags -l to force non-interlaced mode and -L to force
    interlaced mode.


III. Installing Amiga NetHack 3.1

III.A. General Installation
    Installation should be easy - basically it consists of putting files
    where they belong and adding assigns to your startup.  If you are
    installing from the official binary distribution, simply unpacking
    each archive in the appropriate directory will put the files in the
    places they belong (note that the archives may have been split
    for distribution).  If you are installing from source, most of this
    work will be done by the time the build is finished.

    IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A PREVIOUS VERSION INSTALLED YOU MUST DELETE THE
    OLD SAVE AND BONES FILES - THEY WILL NOT WORK!

Will NetHack fit on your machine?
    NetHack 3.1 is large.  NetHack 3.1 is very large.  You will need:
    > Amiga 500, 1000, 2000, 2500, or 3000.  The A600, A1200, and A4000
      should work, but have not been tested.
    > WorkBench 1.3 or 2.04.  WorkBench 1.2 will NOT work; we will NOT
      be fixing that.  WorkBench 2.1 and 3.0 should work but have not been
      tested.
    > At least 2 meg of RAM.  NetHack will NOT run in 1 meg.
    > Mass storage: NetHack will run on one floppy - but it won't be nice.
      Two floppies are almost enough.  A hard drive with over 3 meg of
      free space is recommended.

Find space for the files
    Floppy installation:
	Format four disks named:
	    NetHack
	    HackExe
	    NHsave
	    NHlevels
    Hard Disk installation:
    	cd to wherever you want to install NetHack
	make the main NetHack directory:
	  makedir NetHack
	and the subdirectories:
	  makedir NetHack/save
	  makedir NetHack/levels
	In s:User-Sequence (under 2.0 or later) or s:Startup (under 1.3),
	assign NetHack: to the NetHack directory you created above.
	assign HackExe: to the same directory.
Install the files
    Unpack the archives in the directories or onto the disks (you can
    tell what to unpack where by the file names) by cd'ing to HackExe:
    and unpacking archive 1 and then to NetHack: and unpacking archive 2.
    Use the table in the next section to see where things should end up.
    Be sure that the file 8 ends up in NetHack:hack/8.

Configuration
    Using your favorite text editor, edit NetHack:NetHack.cnf to match
    your system.  Check HackExe:NetHack.dir and be sure that the paths
    are correct.  The HackWB program uses several standard Amiga programs
    that must be installed in their standard places: c:copy, c:rename.
