ScummVM Amiga 68k port v0.38
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Amiga specific functions are in sdl.cpp, grabscreen.cpp, prefs.cpp and timer.cpp.

I didn't use the makefile as the Amiga make executable seems to be a lot sensitive
with the Tabs/Spaces.

=> type "execute makeosound" to compile and then "execute makesound" to link.
