                              by David W. Meny

   This is an adventure game in the vein of the Ultima game series by Lord
British.  It was originally featured in the September, 1991, issue of the
Jumpdisk Amiga disk magazine.
   In this game, you play the role of a humble shepherd who is summon to
a perilous task when your country's king is bewitched.  You must set out
in a dangerous land to find the clues that will enable you to revive your
king and save your land.
   Colorful graphics, hordes of monsters to combat, helpful citizens to
converse with, and puzzles to solve are what lie ahead of you in "Legend of
Lothian."
