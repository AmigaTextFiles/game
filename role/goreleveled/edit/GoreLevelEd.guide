@NODE "What" "WhatTheHellIsThatShitFor?"
@{U}What The Hell Is That ?@{UU}

This is dungeon level editor for a game that is developed by @{"me" link "me" 0}
This 'editor' have some bugs for sure, i wrote it in three days, coz i need
it to testing. So forgive me...
Also...
There is almost-working game but I didnt upload it because of lack of gfx.
Right now i working on monsters and statistics, and it looks like i have more
work that i thought. And im alone with this work :(


This game @{U}should be@{UU}:

- Rogue-like, tured-based rpg

should have:

- tenths of spells, hundredths of monsters, caves, quests
- 640x256 or 640x480 gfx in 256 colours or more on gfx cards.
- multiplayer (net) ????

Anyway this game will be close as its only possible to the paper-like rpg.
Im not sure it will be familiar to the any of the existing rpg system, or it
will be brand new rpg world. Dont know. It @{"depends on you" link "you" 0} too.

Oh, yes.

This game as for now needs Amiga 040(030+fpu)+8mb free ram.
Editor needs ~6mb fast ram and 040 (030)

not much heh...
