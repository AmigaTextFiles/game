              -         RACES AND CLASSES         -
               -----------------------------------

Abbreviations used:

STR = Strength
DEX = Dexterity
INT = Intelligence
LP  = LifePoints
MP  = MagicPoints
XP  = Experience Points

Note: Just because the descriptions here describe a class or race
as being good at one thing is no reason for you not to have them
go into something completely different. For example, there is no
reason that a hobbit shouldn't be a barbarian or a knight, or
that a shepherd couldn't eventually develop into a powerful
spell-caster. You are free to train your characters as you see
fit.


****************************************************************
     RACES
****************************************************************

     Here STR, DEX, INT, LP, and MP represent bonuses which are
added to each of these attributes when the character is created,
and every time a new level is passed. If a number is shown here
for XP, this is a "penalty" -- this amount of experience points
must be gained in addition to the standard amount to pass each
experience level. Thus, the larger this number is, the slower the
character will advance in levels.

     Note: It is possible for characters to exist as other types
of life forms not listed here -- but only through the power of
magic ....

****************************************************************


Human

     An all-purpose, well-balanced race. Not particularly good at
any one thing, but not bad at any either. A good choice for
beginners. Easiest to advance in experience levels.

  NO BONUSES/PENALTIES



Elf

     Elves are a magical, graceful race of humanoids with faintly
greenish skin and pointy ears. They are usually slightly taller
than humans on average, and often more agile. Elves also have a
much longer lifespan, and wise old elves of over 400 years in age
have been known to exist.

  DEX+1  INT+1  MP+2     XP+40



Dwarf

     The dwarves are a short, stalky race often associated with
mines and mining -- many of them have developed their excellent
sense of sight to a stage where they can even see in the darkness
of the catacombs. In spite of their stature, dwarves are
extremely rugged and tough, making them valuable as allies and
dangerous as enemies.

  STR+1  DEX+1           XP+30



Hobbit

     Hobbits are even shorter than dwarves are, which makes them
excellent for hiding, sneaking ... and stealing. They are not as
strong as the dwarves, however. A curious and often playful race,
hobbits can add fun to any group of adventurers.

  DEX+2                  XP+15



Half-Orc

     A half-orc is a relatively new breed, part human and part
orc. Usually very strong -- but because orcs are inherently evil,
this part of the half-orc's blood sometimes causes these
characters to act recklessly. They also have the reputation of
being quite crude and vulgar; often they find work as soldiers or
guards. Though not usually thought of as being very bright, half-
orc's occasionally make successful magic-users.

  STR+2  LP+1            XP+35



Lizard-Man

     Contrary to the name they have been given, the members of
this race are not men at all, but a form of large, intelligent,
human-like reptile. They usually remain with their own kind in
large desert settlements, but many have turned to more human ways
of living and have moved into man's cities, rapidly adopting the
english language as their own. Lizard-men are slightly larger
than humans, averaging about a foot taller in height. They are
also outstanding runners, capable of sprinting at speeds
exceeding 40mph.

  STR+1  DEX+1           XP+25


****************************************************************
     CLASSES
****************************************************************

Strength, Dexterity, and Intelligence are described as one of:
VERY HIGH, HIGH, AVERAGE, LOW, or VERY LOW. Each is an equal step
up from the one below it.

LifePoints and MagicPoints values are the number of points
awarded upon completion of each experience level.

The value for Experience Points is the number of XP that must be
gained to reach level two. The amount needed goes up from there
for each successive level.

For some classes, one or more of these attributes often have an
upper limit slightly lower than others. This means that, for
example, a barbarian's strength will eventually get very high,
but a sorcerer's strength, while still able to grow to an
impressive amount, will never be able to equal the barbarian's.
But then the barbarian's intelligence will never approach that of
the sorcerer. It balances out.

****************************************************************


Alchemist

     An alchemist is a person well-learned in the ways of
chemistry. Their goal has always been to turn base metals --
lead, for example -- into gold.

  STR: Very Low          LP: 4
  DEX: Low               MP: 9
  INT: Very High         XP: 360

 Special Skill: Disable

 Restrictions: Light weapons only, no heavy armor.



Bandit

     These are the scum that rob innocent passers-by along dark
forest paths at night. However, when their skills are put to
better uses, bandits can make good companions.

  STR: High              LP: 8
  DEX: High              MP: Nil
  INT: Very Low          XP: 330

 Special Skills: Pick Lock, Rob

 Restrictions: May not use certain heavy weapons/armors.



Barbarian

     A brutal, muscle-headed killing machine -- that's all a
barbarian is, and that's all he/she wants to be. Talents include
drinking large amounts of ale, and "bashing stuff real good".

  STR: Very High         LP: 10
  DEX: Very Low          MP: Nil
  INT: Very Low          XP: 300

 Restrictions: No missile weapons allowed.



Bard

     Poetic and musically gifted, the bards are the travelling
music-makers of Azalta. They live on the road, and so know how to
protect themselves in times of need. Although bards are not
usually educated academically, they often develop many talents on
their own, and may even dabble in magic.

  STR: Average      LP: 7
  DEX: High         MP: 1
  INT: Low          XP: 330

 Restrictions: Cannot use some heavy weapons/armors.



Burglar

     These characters are highly skilled at what they do --
burgling. A burglar will never rob a person directly, but will
instead "visit" their places of residence when they are absent.
Expert at breaking in and getting around undetected.

  STR: Low               LP: 6
  DEX: Very High         MP: Nil
  INT: Low               XP: 375

 Special Skills: Pick lock, Find, Disable, Conceal

 Restrictions: Cannot use/wear loud or awkward weapons/armors
               that might hamper burgling abilities.



Cleric

     A cleric is one whose single purpose in life is to strive to
be pure and righteous in his/her religion, and obey all its
rules. Adept in the healing arts as well as in fighting, a cleric
is usually a welcome member of any party.

  STR: Average           LP: 7
  DEX: Average           MP: 7
  INT: High              XP: 465

 Restrictions: All sharp or pointed weapons are not allowed, for
               religious reasons.



Druid

     A druid is a follower of the Ancient Order, an obscure and
mysterious religion from the Early Days when the world was still
new. Very little is known about the druids by outsiders. Their
rituals seem either bizarre or grotesque to most who witness them
-- the "Death Rite", for example, in which the druid
ceremoniously kills his enemy with precise stabs of a single
blade.

  STR: Low               LP: 5
  DEX: Very Low          MP: 10
  INT: Very High         XP: 390

 Restrictions: Only weapons allowed are single blades meant for
               stabbing.



Enchanter

     Some people are not trained in the ways of magic, yet they
possess strong magical powers of their own from birth. These
people are called "enchanters" by the general public. Though they
are powerful, they often have not learned to use these powers as
well as they could with proper training. Many enchanters use
their magic simply to entertain family and friends, but there is
usually much potential for their unused powers.

  STR: Very Low          LP: 6
  DEX: High              MP: 10
  INT: High              XP: 435

 Restrictions: No heavy weapons/armors allowed.



Fighter

     A fighter's job is simple; they fight. Always training, they
work constantly to familiarize themselves with every conceivable
weapon, armor, and every possible battle situation. A well-
disciplined fighter is difficult to beat.

  STR: High              LP: 10
  DEX: Average           MP: Nil
  INT: Very Low          XP: 330

 Restrictions: None.



Illusionist

     An illusionist is a powerful magic-user who primarily uses
his/her powers for trickery and show. Often these people make a
living by doing fantastic stage shows, in which they seemingly
conjure up terrifying dragons and other creatures to delight
captivated audiences. These powers can be useful on adventures.

  STR: Very Low          LP: 4
  DEX: Average           MP: 9
  INT: Very High         XP: 420

 Restrictions: Only light weapons/armors allowed.



Jester

     Fun-loving jesters are expert entertainers. But juggling,
dancing, singing, and tumbling are not their only skills; because
of their amazing dexterity they can sneak up on foes extremely
well and also use missile weapons to full effect.

  STR: Very Low          LP: 5
  DEX: Very High         MP: Nil
  INT: Very Low          XP: 260

 Special Skills: Rob, Conceal

 Restrictions: No heavy weapons/armors.



Knight

     Distinguished and noble, a knight always tries to do the
honorable thing. Rescuing damsels in distress is a favorite
pastime. Knights are well-trained by the Crown in the methods of
fair combat. A good character to have for protection.

  STR: Very High         LP: 9
  DEX: High              MP: Nil
  INT: Low               XP: 390

 Restrictions: Not allowed to use any evil or blackmarket items.



Magician

     The magician "knows every trick in the book" as they say.
Loves putting on a show of his/her magical abilities. Magicians
are extraordinarily quick with their hands, which can make them
useful for more than just magic.

  STR: Low               LP: 5
  DEX: Very High         MP: 8
  INT: High              XP: 450

 Restrictions: Light weapons/armors only.



Medium

     A medium is one who communicates with the spirits of those
long-dead. Although often shunned by the public, these people
have strong magical abilities which can prove very useful.

  STR: Average           LP: 5
  DEX: Average           MP: 7
  INT: Very High         XP: 405

 Restrictions: Heavy weapons/armors not allowed.



Mercenary

     Brutal, fierce, and unmerciful, mercenaries are ruthless
killers, usually hired to "get rid of" someone who is unwanted.
They will do anything to anyone if the price is right.

  STR: Very High         LP: 10
  DEX: Low               MP: Nil
  INT: Very Low          XP: 315

 Special Skills: Rob

 Restrictions: None.



Monk

     Diligent in their beliefs, monks spend much of their time
practicing the daily religious exercises and ceremonies of their
strict discipline. They are highly intelligent and possess a
mastery of magical forces, and can also protect themselves in a
battle if needed.

  STR: Average           LP: 5
  DEX: Low               MP: 9
  INT: Very High         XP: 435

 Restrictions: Must not use any item made of dead animal parts,
               such as skin or bone.



Ninja

     Dark and mysterious is the way of the ninja. These
characters come from a far off and undiscovered land, some say to
the East. They are highly skilled, but secretive, so they are
often greatly underestimated by their enemies. The ninja is
master of rare and exotic weapons of all sorts, and also
possesses unknown magical powers.

  STR: High              LP: 7
  DEX: Very High         MP: 2
  INT: Average           XP: 495

 Special Skills: Pick Lock, Rob, Find, Disable, Conceal

 Restrictions: Cannot use any weapons/armors that are loud or
               awkward or that will hamper abilities in any way.



Paladin

     The paladin is a powerful soldier who follows the path of
righteousness much like a knight does. A paladin, however, is
also a trained healer, and when wounded, can often heal
him/herself and get back into the battle.

  STR: High              LP: 8
  DEX: Average           MP: 1
  INT: High              XP: 375

 Restrictions: No evil or blackmarket items allowed.



Priest

     Priests are dedicated and completely loyal to their chosen
divinity; their sole purpose in life is to please this divine
one. They are intelligent, and often serve as teachers. Healing
is also a useful talent a priest may practice.

  STR: Very Low          LP: 4
  DEX: Average           MP: 8
  INT: Very High         XP: 405

 Restrictions: For religious reasons, cannot use objects made of
               wood.



Ranger

     A ranger is an expert in outdoor survival techniques. The
ways of the forest are his/her ways. The ranger is master of the
bow and arrow, and can use it to hunt animals with great skill.

  STR: Average           LP: 7
  DEX: High              MP: 1
  INT: Low               XP: 405

 Special Skills: Find, Disable, Conceal

 Restrictions: Some heavy weapons/armors may not be used.



Robber

     In the world of thievery, the robber is the happy medium.
Not as technically skilled as the burglar, but less of a brutish
oaf than the bandit; he/she can deftly pick someone's pocket, but
just in case he/she should get caught, the robber is still tough
enough to handle a fight.

  STR: Average           LP: 7
  DEX: High              MP: Nil
  INT: Very Low          XP: 345

 Special Skills: Pick Lock, Rob, Conceal

 Restrictions: Certain heavy weapons/armors not allowed.



Sage

     Brilliant magical abilities, but that's about it. Vastly
intelligent and wise, the sage's entire life is spent on nothing
but improving his/her magic skills and learning new spells.
Should stay clear of swordfights, if at all possible.

  STR: Very Low          LP: 3
  DEX: Very Low          MP: 10
  INT: Very High         XP: 300

 Restrictions: Only light weapons/armors allowed.



Shaman

     A shaman is a mystic who has the ability to channel spirits
and to occasionally see through time. More primitive cultures
call these people "medicine men"; they are also well-learned in
many ancient curing and healing techniques. A powerful spell-
caster.

  STR: Average           LP: 6
  DEX: Average           MP: 10
  INT: Very High         XP: 495

 Restrictions: Cannot use any objects made of metal.



Shepherd

     A shepherds life is a peaceful one. He/she watches over the
flock, and has a lot of time to think and develop other skills
such as playing musical instruments or using magic. Has a keen
eye and is adroit at finding lost sheep. Shepherds also must
occasionally rescue a lamb from a prowling wolf or a lion; their
fighting skills are above average.

  STR: Average           LP: 6
  DEX: Average           MP: 1
  INT: Average           XP: 360

 Special Skills: Find

 Restrictions: Some heavy weapons/armors may not be used.



Sorcerer

     Surpassed in spell-casting abilities only by the wizard and
the sage, the sorcerer is a very powerful magic-user. Often
specializing in spells of a destructive nature, they can be a
great help in difficult battles.

  STR: Very Low          LP: 5
  DEX: Very Low          MP: 9
  INT: Very High         XP: 375

 Restrictions: Can only use light weapons/armors.



Swordsman

     Highly skilled in the use of the sword, a swordsman is a
deadly opponent to be up against in a duel. These people usually
began with fencing lessons at an early age, under the training of
another Master swordsman. In addition to their knowledge of
blade-fighting techniques, swordsmen frequently explore the uses
of various other weaponry and armors as well.

  STR: High              LP: 8
  DEX: High              MP: Nil
  INT: Very Low          XP: 330

 Restrictions: Cannot use missile weapons.



Thief

     Though scorned by many, the thief is an exceptionally
skilled character, valuable to any adventuring party. A Master
thief is able to weasel his/her way out of nearly any conceivable
danger situation. Good for him/her, but not always so good for
the other companions who are often left behind.

  STR: Average           LP: 6
  DEX: Very High         MP: Nil
  INT: Low               XP: 390

 Special Skills: Pick Lock, Rob, Find, Disable, Conceal

 Restrictions: No loud or awkward weapons/armors allowed.



Tracker

     There is no better character for hunting something, or
someone, than the tracker. Able to stalk his/her prey silently, a
tracker can be a frightening enemy to have on your trail.
Trackers are experts when it comes to identifying signs left by
animals or people and then following these signs to their source;
they can successfully hunt down most anything.

  STR: High              LP: 7
  DEX: High              MP: Nil
  INT: Low               XP: 360

 Special Skills: Find, Conceal

 Restrictions: Certain heavy weapons/armors not allowed.



Warrior

     The warrior is a person experienced in the art of warfare. A
well-trained warrior has a vast range of weaponry mastered from
which to choose from, and armors are expertly used to their
fullest effect.

  STR: Very High         LP: 10
  DEX: Average           MP: Nil
  INT: Very Low          XP: 390

 Restrictions: None.



Wizard

     One of the most powerful spell-casters, a high-level wizard
can crush his enemies with sheer willpower. Wizards can cast
spells of all sorts when they reach higher experience levels;
however, as with most magic-users, gaining this experience when
first starting out can often be a difficult process.

  STR: Very Low          LP: 4
  DEX: Very Low          MP: 10
  INT: Very High         XP: 375

 Restrictions: Only light weapons/armors allowed.
