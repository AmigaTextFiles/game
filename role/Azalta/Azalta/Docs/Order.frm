Credit card orders are preferred (see below), and will allow us to deliver
the product to you much faster. Otherwise, postal money orders are the
next best form of payment. Checks for an equal amount of money in
Canadian funds drawn on a Canadian bank are fine -- but if you must
send a check drawn on another bank, be warned that these will take
extra processing time.
 
All prices listed are in U.S. dollars. Make money orders and checks payable
to "PsychoSoft Ent.". Allow up to 6-8 weeks for processing and delivery.

Thank you for ordering from PsychoSoft. We appreciate your business.
