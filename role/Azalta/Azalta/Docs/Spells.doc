****************************************************************

1    Awaken

     This most basic of spells is used simply to wake up a
sleeping person or creature. An "antidote" for the Sleep spell.
The power required depends on how deep the sleep is.

INT: 4         POW: 1+        Target: Any


2    Magic Missile

     A handy attack spell for low-level magic-users, while still
deadly when cast by more powerful ones. This spell creates an
"arrow" of pure energy and lets the caster fire it at whom he/she
pleases.

INT: 8         POW: 3+        Target: Missile


3    Thaw

     This spell is used to free a person or creature who has been
frozen, usually from a Freeze or Blizzard spell cast by another.
The power required depends on the extent of the freezing.

INT: 10        POW: 6+        Target: Any


4    Magic Footprints

     When this spell is cast, the caster's feet will leave a
trail of glowing footprints behind wherever he/she walks. Can be
useful when lost in a dungeon. The lasting power of this effect
is determined by the level of the magic-user.

INT: 12        POW: 8


5    Sleep

     This spell is useful in many a battle situation. It may be
used to help the caster escape by putting an attacker to sleep
and then running away, or the caster may be a bit more vicious
and decide to attack his defenseless sleeping enemy. The amount
of power put into the spell determines how long the victim will
sleep.

INT: 15        POW: 10+       Target: Any


6    Unlock

     With this spell the magic-user can magically unlock a locked
door without the use of a key.

INT: 20        POW: 12        Target: Touch


7    Remove Poison

     This useful spell has saved many an adventurer's life. It
negates any poisons that may be in a person's or creature's
bloodstream. The power required for success depends on the
strength of the poison involved -- a bee sting is much easier to
cure than a deadly snake bite.

INT: 22        POW: 16+       Target: Touch


8    Confuse

     With this spell the caster can scramble the thoughts of an
enemy. The victim will hardly be able to walk in a straight line,
let alone attack with any accuracy -- he may even begin attacking
his own side. It can be very advantageous to disorientate one's
attackers.

INT: 25        POW: 20        Target: Missile


9    Illusion

     This spell lets the caster create a realistic magical image
of anything he/she wishes; a snake, a wall, or even a dragon. The
image created is almost 100% imperceptible by those who do not
know it is only an illusion (although an extremely intelligent
individual can figure it out). This can be a useful spell for
warding off more gullible creatures. It is also a fun spell for
magic shows. The image is selected by the amount of power spent
on the spell.

INT: 26        POW: 26+       Target: Any


10   Poison

     With a Poison spell a spell-caster can magically "inject" a
venom into an enemy which will slowly cause its death, or at
least do some continued harm over a period of time. The victim
will lose a certain amount of LifePoints every turn that the
poison remains in his body. The poison's lasting power is
determined by power spent; the strength of the poison depends on
the level of the caster.

INT: 28        POW: 23+       Target: Missile


11   Fear

     This spell is used to terrify an attacker so that it will be
too scared to attack, if it doesn't just retreat completely. Some
creatures are more easily frightened than others, but this can be
an effective way to chase enemies off without hurting them.

INT: 32        POW: 30        Target: Any


12   Heal

     Every adventuring party should have at least one character
in the group who knows this spell. When a character is wounded, a
Heal spell will restore some, or even all, of his lost life. The
amount of LifePoints healed is dependant on power spent.

INT: 34        POW: 5+        Target: Touch


13   Poison Cloud

     This spell creates a cloud of poisonous gas which will choke
anyone who breathes it, doing damage to their lungs. Prolonged
exposure is fatal. The amount of power spent on this spell will
determine the size of the gas cloud; you may only want a small
cloud, or you may want to fill an entire room -- but be careful
not to smother your own companions or yourself in the process.

INT: 36        POW: 36+       Target: Any


14   Freeze

     With this spell the caster can select any individual and
freeze him in place, rendering him harmless and immovable (for
the time being). Longer lasting than a Sleep spell. The amount of
time the victim will remain frozen depends on the amount of power
spent on the spell.

INT: 37        POW: 32+       Target: Any


15   Bird's Eye

     When outdoors, this spell allows the magic-user to transfer
his mind temporarily to a passing bird, which allows him/her to
see a "bird's eye view" of the surrounding land for miles around.
Very helpful when travelling long distances. Can save your life
if you are lost. The more power spent on the spell, the larger
the area you will be able to see. Note: The colors of things
as seen through the eyes of a bird can be confusing.

INT: 40        POW: 40


16   Protection

     This spell effectively helps the caster avoid harm in battle
by surrounding him/her with a magical "shield" which absorbs part
of the damage done by attacker's blows. The time this spell lasts
for depends on the experience level of the caster, and the actual
effectiveness of the shield depends on the caster's intelligence.

INT: 43        POW: 10


17   Stupidity

     With this spell a magic-user can turn an intelligent being
into the intellectual equivalent of a carrot. The victim will act
as if almost completely mindless, and will not notice he is
walking through flames, or into a deep hole, etc, and will also
lose the ability to cast spells properly.

INT: 45        POW: 42        Target: Any


18   Repel Undead

     This spell/ritual is meant to drive off the evil denizens of
the undead world: skeletons, zombies, vampires, etc. When
successful, some or all of the undead creatures will be horrified
by your presence and flee the area. The number of undead actually
repelled depends on the caster's intelligence and experience
level -- the type of creature also makes a big difference in
difficulty; skeletons are far easier to repel than mummies or
vampires.

INT: 35        POW: 46


19   Slow

     This spell is very valuable when battling fast-moving
creatures; when it is cast upon them, they will slow down to half
of their normal speed.

INT: 45        POW: 48        Target: Any


20   Corrode Armor

     This spell will rapidly corrode a character's armor, making
it less effective for their protection. Multiple castings of this
spell (or a single powerful one) can render a piece of armor
completely useless. The amount of damage done is dependant upon
the amount of power spent on the spell.

INT: 47        POW: 30+       Target: Any


21   Web

     This spell lets the caster fire a stream of sticky,
spiderweb-like netting from his hands to form a "web-wall" in
which enemies can become entrapped. Can be fired directly at a
creature, or be used to create a web-wall in preparation for its
advance. The length of the web depends on the power spent.

INT: 50        POW: 52+       Target: Missile


22   Fireball

     This powerful attack spell creates a ball of fire and lets
the caster launch it at any target he/she chooses. Can do much
more damage to an enemy than a Magic Missile. The size and power
of the fireball depends on power spent.

INT: 54        POW: 20+       Target: Missile


23   Dispel Force Field

     If a force field blocks your way, this spell will let you
dissipate its energy and cause it to disappear.

INT: 55        POW: 60        Target: Touch


24   X-Ray Vision

     When inside a building or dungeon, using this spell will
allow the caster to peer through a solid wall and see a vision of
the room on the other side (if one exists). Can also be used to
see a room above or below. This spell will not, however, show the
presence of most types of creatures that may be lurking in the
room.

INT: 58        POW: 68


25   Create Force Field

     Lets the magic-user form a permanent impassable wall of pure
energy in front of him/her. Useful for protection.

INT: 60        POW: 75


26   Drain Magic

     With this spell the caster can directly rob another magic-
user of his/her MagicPoints. The amount of power drained is equal
to the amount of power spent on this spell.

INT: 30        POW: 30+       Target: Any


27   Speed

     With this spell the caster doubles his/her speed of
movement, effectively giving him/her two turns for every one that
other characters get. Extremely useful in combat.

INT: 68        POW: 100


28   Create Gold

     This spell lets the magic-user create pure gold coins from
nothing but raw magical power. The amount of gold depends on the
power spent.

INT: 70        POW: 110+


29   Curse Armor

     With this spell the caster places a magical curse upon the
victim's armor.

INT: 71        POW: 114       Target: Any


30   Curse Weapon

     With this spell the caster places a magic curse upon the
victim's weapon in use.

INT: 71        POW: 115       Target: Any


31   Create Food

     This spell can save starving characters' lives. It lets the
caster create an edible, calorie-rich substance from nothing but
magical energy. Some say it tastes like chicken. The amount of
food created depends on power spent.

INT: 73        POW: 112+


32   Harm

     A deadly spell. It lets the caster do bodily harm to anyone
he/she chooses by simply willing it. The amount of damage done
depends on the amount of power spent; it is not nearly as power-
efficient as such spells as Fireball though -- more power must be
spent with Harm to do any equal amount of damage.

INT: 75        POW: 50+       Target: Any


33   Cure Disease

     With this powerful healing spell the magic-user can rid an
individual of a debilitating disease. The amount of magic power
needed is dependant on the type of disease to be cured.

INT: 80        POW: 120+      Target: Touch


34   Teleport Object

     This spell allows the caster to change the location of a
chosen object (under a certain size) by using his/her mental
powers. Useful for bringing a treasure chest nearer when traps
are suspected, etc.

INT: 78        POW: 130       Target: Any


35   Control

     With this spell, the magic-user can take control of the mind
of any individual. The victim will then begin to fight for the
controlling spell-caster, rather than against. In a battle
situation where you are outnumbered, it can be very advantageous
to take control of one or more of the opposition and increase
your chances.

INT: 82        POW: 150       Target: Any


36   Detect Invisible

     This spell will find any invisible individuals in the
immediate area and make them clearly visible to everyone. Effects
everyone but the caster -- even any of his/her companions who may
be invisible.

INT: 88        POW: 160


37   Touch of Agony

     This is one of the most harmful assault spells in existence.
The caster's bare hand, upon touching the victim, does severe
damage to the individual's body. The damage done is equal to
double the MagicPoints spent on the touch.

INT: 90        POW: 80+       Target: Touch


38   Teleport Self

     This spell lets the spell-caster move freely and instantly
through space, even through walls. You may not teleport to any
space already occupied.

INT: 95        POW: 140       Target: Any


39   Remove Curse

     If a character or creature has been cursed, this spell will
lift it from them. This spell works on curses placed on
individuals, not those placed on items (for curses such as those,
professional help must be sought).

INT: 100       POW: 145       Target: Touch


40   Blaze

     This destructive spell creates a blazing cone of fire
emanating from the caster's hands which will damage and ignite
anyone or anything in its range. Useful because it can be used on
several enemies at once, if they are positioned right. The length
of the fire cone depends on the amount of power spent.

INT: 104       POW: 90+


41   Teleport Others

     Just like Teleport Self, but can be used on other characters
or creatures. Can be used to send someone further away from you
if they are causing you trouble.

INT: 115       POW: 160       Target: Any


42   Create Weapon

     With this spell it is possible for an unarmed magic-user to
arm him/herself in an emergency. A magical energy sword (usable
by anyone) will be created, which will slowly deteriorate with
each swing. The sword's initial strength depends on the amount of
power spent. The caster's hands must be empty to cast this spell.

INT: 119       POW: 180+


43   Create Armor

     Just like Create Weapon above, but creates a magical suit of
energy armor instead, which deteriorates every time it is struck.

INT: 120       POW: 180+


44   Burn Spirit

     This spell lets the magic-user fight those pesky ghosts,
banshees, phantoms, and other inhabitants of the spirit world
which are normally unharmed by other spells and weapons. Will
also do damage to physical beings (which are also part spirit),
but is less effective than when used on spirits. Damage done
depends on power spent.

INT: 134       POW: 100+      Target: Missile


45   Curse

     This spell will place a foul curse on anyone the caster
chooses. If successful, the victim will from then on always be
hit by any attacks made on him. Very helpful for the magic-user's
fighting companions when battling a tough monster.

INT: 146       POW: 185       Target: Any


46   Teleport to Crystal

     No matter where your party is, when this spell is cast, the
magic-user and all of his/her companions will be transported
instantly outdoors to the earth directly above the Great
Underground Crystal. Handy when lost at the bottom of a deep
dungeon.

INT: 150       POW: 200


47   Explosion

     This dangerous attack spell lets the spell-caster cause a
large explosion wherever he/she would like one. It can be
directly on an enemy, or simply near him; the most damage will be
done in the center of the blast, but a considerable amount will
still be done to anyone else in its reach. This makes it useful
when cast into the center of a group of monsters, but care must
be used if you are not to blow up your own companions. Power
spent on the spell determines the overall damage done.

INT: 160       POW: 110+      Target: Any


48   Blizzard

     This spell works somewhat the same way that Blaze does, but
instead of a cone of flames, a conical snowstorm blasts from the
caster's hands, freezing anyone unfortunate enough to be caught
in its path. Convenient for refrigerating large groups. The
length of the storm-cone depends on power spent.

INT: 170       POW: 120+


49   Create Door

     With this spell the magic-user can create a door in just
about any impassable section of wall, or even in thin air if
desired.

INT: 180       POW: 210       Target: Touch


50   Lightning

     Causes a lightning bolt of variable power (dependant on
power used for spell) to flash down from the sky and strike
anyone the caster desires. Works much like Harm, but is well over
twice as powerful.

INT: 185       POW: 130+      Target: Any


51   Blink

     Used outdoors only, this spell lets the magic-user "jump"
his entire party miles through space in a fraction of a second,
even through solid matter such as mountains. The amount of power
spent on the spell determines how many miles will be travelled.
Caution must be used; it is possible to end up in the middle of
the ocean, or surrounded by mountains.

INT: 190       POW: 220+


52   Transform Armor

     This spell allows the caster to transform any character's
armor (being worn) to a lesser armor, causing his foe to be less
protected. For example, it may change an enemy's plate armor into
mere leather armor or even normal clothing.

INT: 195       POW: 225       Target: Any


53   Transform Weapon

     Just like Transform Armor above, but works on a character's
weapon in use instead, transforming, for example, a battle-axe
into a slingshot.

INT: 196       POW: 226       Target: Any


54   Quake

     This extremely powerful attack spell causes a minor
earthquake in the immediate area which will damage all enemies in
contact with the ground (airborne creatures will not be harmed).
The amount of damage done to each creature depends on the amount
of power used.

INT: 200       POW: 160+


55   Invisibility

     When this spell is cast, the caster becomes completely
invisible. Most enemies will have no idea of where he/she is,
unless they feel the magic-user's touch, in which case they will
attack in that direction. The period this spell lasts for is
determined by the caster's experience level.

INT: 208       POW: 230


56   Summon Creature

     With this spell, a magic-user can conjure up a monster of
any type to fight a battle for him/her. The monster summoned will
be totally loyal and fight until all enemies in the area are
destroyed. It will not follow you afterward. Power spent
determines species of monster summoned.

INT: 213       POW: 200+      Target: Any


57   Mayhem

     This spell will send all enemies in the area who are less
intelligent than the spell-caster into a state of confusion. Most
useful when fighting a large group of creatures; they will often
begin attacking each other in their disorientation.

INT: 201       POW: 240


58   Part Water

     With this spell a magic-user can clear a walkable path
through a pond, river, or other body of water. The amount of
water parted will depend on the power spent.

INT: 231       POW: 250+


59   Mass Panic

     When this spell is cast, all creatures less intelligent than
the caster will go into a state of panic and attempt to flee from
his/her presence.

INT: 205       POW: 260


60   Summon Undead

     This is usually considered an evil spell, and is generally
only used by high-level users of Black Magic, but is included
here for use in emergencies. When cast, a number of undead
creatures will rise from the earth and fight for the caster until
either they or your enemies are utterly destroyed. The type of
undead summoned depends on your experience level; the number
appearing depends on the amount of power spent.

INT: 220       POW: 235+


61   Transmogrify

     A very nasty and irreversible spell, Transmogrify will
change any living creature into a (usually) lower form of life.
It is possible to turn a ogre into a frog, or a human into a
snake, for example. The amount of "steps down" the victim
degenerates depends on the power of the spell.

INT: 225       POW: 275+      Target: Any


62   Touch of Death

     When a high-level magic-user casts this spell and touches a
living thing, it dies. Drains all of the caster's power (except
for very high-level users). This spell is considered evil; no XP
is awarded for deaths caused by its use.

INT: 230       POW: 325       Target: Touch


63   Resurrect

     This spell gives the magic-user the ability to bring dead
companions back to life. The resurrected character will be very
weak and should quickly be healed and fed, or death could easily
come again. The spell will drain all of the caster's power.

INT: 244       POW: 300


64   Disintegrate

     This, the most destructive and evil of all spells, is used
to totally vaporize anything the magic-user wishes. When used on
living beings, all the caster's magic power is drained. No XP is
awarded for killing with this spell.

INT: 250       POW: 350       Target: Touch
