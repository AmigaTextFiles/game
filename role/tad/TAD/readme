You need Scala Player (or Scala) to play this game. Scala Player is 
NOT freely redistributable and therefor NOT included. 

Description
This game is based on Police Quest 1, a game created and published by 
Sierra On-Line in 1987. But here the roles are switched and you play as 
Jessie Bains, the antagonist, a drug dealer and a card shark with the 
intention to take control of the drug trafficing in the city of Lytton. 

The game is created with Scala MM400 and it's a point'n click game, similar
to the game Myst. This is my entry to AmiGameJam 2024. I ended up using Scala 
because Scala is awesome.

No in-game music yet, so my suggestion is to play 'Police Quest 1 theme' on 
repeat when you play the game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPEotYFEMuE

How to play
You just point and click. :) Solve the puzzles and find a way to take 
control over the city.

System Requirements
The game is written using Scala MM400 and it requires a copy 
of Scala or Scala Player to run (not included). It has been tested on 
Scala MM300/MM400. In order to run Scala you need an Amiga (real or emulated)
with AmigaOS 2.x or newer, 1 MB chip RAM and 2 MB fast RAM.
