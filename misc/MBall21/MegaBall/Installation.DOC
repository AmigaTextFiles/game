How to set up MegaBall:

You should copy the file

iff.library         to your LIBS:          directory
fonts/MegaBall.font to your FONTS:         directory
fonts/MegaBall/8    to your FONTS:MegaBall directory
                                    (you should MakeDir this last one).

You should also be sure that diskfont.library is in your LIBS:
directory.  Diskfont.library is on the original Workbench disk.

Iff.library is Public Domain.

The file MegaBall.Music contains five songs.  This should be in the
same directory as MegaBall itself.  Please DO NOT separate this file
from MegaBall if you distribute the game.

If MegaBall can't find the font or diskfont.library, it will
use TOPAZ8 (in ROM).
If MegaBall can't find iff.library, it will not be able to run.

For instructions on playing MegaBall, read MegaBall2.1.DOC.
