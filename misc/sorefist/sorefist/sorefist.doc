Sorefist the plot:
"Great, I travel through time and now that I've actually got rid of my
enemies I find myself stuck here.....", said R.

Famous last words from our hero?

But no, it may have took him a long time to find a way out, but he has.

"Whats this?", he asked.
"No dear, you don't want to touch that one!", said the woman, "It's been
damaged!"
"What, there was two time capshels. And you kept this from me for years.
Don't you see that this is our chance, a way to get back to our time"
"But you don't know what time it'll take you to"
"Humm, Jump deep or taste not the plasma pool, wasn't that what someone
said?"
"But dear, it may take you back to the start!"
"No, that won't happen, and if it did, I am stronger now. They'd be no
match for me."
"But the space time thingy, you could be stuck in a paraduk, thingy."
"But don't you see, it's all for nothing if you don't have your
freedom!"
"okay"

And with a flash they were gone, away from the future they did not ask for.

"See we made it, okay....Wait this place look slighty familar, but,
different???"
"ARGH...."
"Woman, where are you?"

An old man walked over, "The girl is theirs now, you can't do anything
about it. Get yourself a new one...hey were are you going?"
"I'm going to pick a fight.........."

Trouble shooting.....
If you have only 1mb ram, then I advise you not to run it through workbench
but let it boot itself.
Also, if you still experience problems, it is because you have an external
disk drive attached, those things take up something like 17k each, so
remove them. It was written on a standard A500 with only 1mb ram, and a
external disk drive, and I rarely had any trouble running it. But having
said that, any trouble I had was due to the external.
