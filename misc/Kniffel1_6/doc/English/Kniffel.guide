@NODE Description "Description"

Description
===========

Kniffel  ist a well known game of dice.  There are many different
versions for the Amiga, but no one had all the features I wished.

My  parents  like to play this game, so I decided in 1993 to give
them a selfmade Kniffel program as a present for Christmas.

After we tested the program now I want to make my program public.
The  main  aspect  while  programming  was  to  respect the "User
Interface  Style  Guide".   Maybe  the  next  version  will  have
computer-controlled players and other things.

The program was completely developed with "Amiga Oberon".

Using
=====

The program can be started from CLI and from Workbench.  4K stack
should be enough.

Normally  you  will  work with the mouse, but you also can switch
the 5 dice gadgets with the keys F1 to F5.

The active player is marked with a coloured border.

If  you  leave  the  game  the names and the cumulate results are
stored, so you can continue your game later.
