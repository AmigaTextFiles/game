2001-09-02  Clément Bourdarias  <phneutre@mangoquest.org>

	properly refreshed in some rare cases

2001-09-01  Clément Bourdarias  <phneutre@mangoquest.org>

	* src/labyr.cpp: fixed a critical bug that occured when an empty
	rectangular area was created (it said "not in a sector" in 
	mangoquest and crashed when teleporting into it)

2001-08-31  Clément Bourdarias  <phneutre@mangoquest.org>

	* src/volet_autres.cpp, src/clique.cpp: added winning post on the
	"others" panel (new feature)

	begins the map in the "others" panel (new feature)

2001-08-30  Clément Bourdarias  <phneutre@mangoquest.org>

2001-08-14  Clément Bourdarias  <phneutre@mangoquest.org>

	* ---- RELEASED 0.6.2 -----
	* src/volet_bonus.cpp: updated bonus description
	* src/carte.cpp: print a message while saving map ("saving map")
	* src/volet_bonus.cpp: don't draw parameter if bonus don't have a
	parameter (life, armaggedon and losebonus).
	* src/config_file.cpp, src/editeur.cpp: added configuration file
	where we put default values for bonus parameters.

2001-08-12  Clément Bourdarias  <phneutre@mangoquest.org>

	* src/labyr.cpp: don't use floor texture when there is a teleport
	(needed for mangoquest if we want to see special texture where
	there is a teleport)
	* src/map.cpp: separate compatibility_number into read and write
	compatility numbers, so that we can still load old maps and
	convert them to new format by saving them
	* src/share.h: changed the compatibility numbers because of the
	changes on teleport textures. To convert old maps, just load them,
	then save them, and they're ready.

2001-08-06  Clément Bourdarias  <phneutre@mangoquest.org>

	* src/main.cpp: added key repetition with low delay
	(very useful when changing bonus parameters...)

2001-08-03  Clément Bourdarias  <phneutre@mangoquest.org>

	* ---- RELEASED 0.6.1 -----
	* src/SDL_Stretch.cpp: added an include of stlib.h to avoid
	compilation errors on gcc 2.96.
	Thanks to Nerijus Baliunas for the patch.
	* src/file_utils: we print more informations about file path

2001-08-02  Clément Bourdarias  <phneutre@mangoquest.org>

	* src/carte.cpp: only create the black and white minimap (*_.bmp)
	instead of creating both textured (*.bmp) and B&W minimaps
	* src/file_utils.cpp: fixed a critical bug: filename was set to NULL
	when creating a new map (you couldn't save)
	* src/clique.cpp: placing a bonus on top of a special item no longer 
	erases that special item
	* src/labyr.cpp: fixed a bug when no portal was found 
	(posed a problem later when loading map in game)
	* src/carte.cpp: added zlib compression for maps
	(new map size is about 1/10 of old size, but we now need zlib)
	* configure.in: added support for zlib
	* editor_data/*: fixed badly encoded png files 
	(fixed "Too many IDAT's found" message)	
	* doc/*: wrote full MangoPeeler user's manual with Guillaume Burlet

2001-07-31  Clément Bourdarias  <phneutre@mangoquest.org>
