       </big><big><big><b><br>
1. Introduction</b></big></big><br>
       <br>
         The Blue Mango Quest is a kind of Pacman clone. Thus, the goal is
 to  eat   all the gums that are on the floor. These gums are called DituBoxes 
  (in fact,  they are not gums : you probably noticed that they have the shape
  of tuna's  box (hmmm...)). Once you've eaten all <b>DituBoxes</b> , you
have   won !<br>
         The problem is that you are in a labyrinth with nasty Shmolluxs. 
A  Shmollux    is a monster that wants to eat you. If they manage to eat you,
 you loose   a life.<br>
         But you can eat them, too : you just need to eat a very special
bonus    called  <b>"ShmixGum"</b><b>.</b><br>
    <br>
   <big><b><big> 2. Winning conditions</big></b></big><br>
    <br>
   To finish a map, you have to eat all Dituboxes (the small blue boxes on
 the floor) and, if needed, go to the winning post.<br>

of bonus and malus.<br>
      <br>
     <big><b>&nbsp;4.1. Stockable bonus</b></big><br>
    <br>
    You can use a stocked bonus in two different ways :<br>
    <b>- Keyboard:</b> press the F1, F2, F3 or F4 key for slot 1 (Armaggedon), 
  2 (Shockwave), 3 (HighSpeed) or 4 (StopTime) ;<br>
    <b>- Mouse:</b> change selected bonus slot with right-click (e.g. click 
 two times to select Shockwave) and left-click to use this bonus. Once you've
  used the bonus, no slot is selected (e.g. you'll have to click 3 times
&nbsp;to   select High-speed).<br>
     <br>
   <big>  &nbsp;</big><big><b>4.2 Bonus priorities</b></big><br>
     <br>
     There are some rules to know concerning priorities between bonus and 
malus.<br>
     <br>
         
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" border="1" width="700">
       <tbody>

     <br>
       The ShmixGum and Life are independent from the other items.<br>
     <br>
     You cannot activate High-Speed and StopTime stocked bonus while a malus 
 is active, but you can do it with ShockWave and Armaggedon.<br>
     <br>
   <big><b><big> 5. Shmolluxes : eat or be eaten</big></b></big><br>
   <br>
   Shmolluxes are very angry, thus they want to eat you. They can do it if
 they are on the same square than you, except in the following conditions
:<br>
   <br>
   - you have eaten a ShmixGum and it's still active;<br>
   - you have eaten a Shield bonus and it's still active;<br>
   - you have eaten a Frozen bonus and it's still active;<br>
   - there is a bug.<br>
   <br>
   If the ShmixGum or Frozen bonus are active, the Shmolluxes are afraid. 
You  can eat them and you'll receive 200 points by Shmollux.<br>
   <br>

     <big><b><big>6. Special infrastructures</big></b></big><br>
     <big><br>
   </big><big>  &nbsp;</big><big><b>6.1. Huts of Shmolluxes</b></big><br>
     <br>
     Shmolluxes live in huts. When a shmollux dies, he re-birth in his hut. 
 There  can be several huts in the map, each of them can contain several shmolluxes.<br>
     A hut is represented by an <b>opened </b>manhole. Some manholes are
closed   : they are not huts.<br>
     A hut can be destroyed if you use your stocked Armaggedon (F2) on its
 square<br>
     <br>
     <b>&nbsp;<big>6.2. </big></b><big><b>Teleports</b></big><br>
     <br>
         A teleport is a combo of two gates.<br>
     In The Blue Mango Quest,  teleports work in the 2 ways : each gate is
 either  an entrance, or an exit.<br>
     <i>N.B.: Shmolluxes can't use teleports.</i><br>
     <br>
     A teleport is represented by a whirlpool.<br>
   <br>
   <b>&nbsp;<big>6.3. Winning post</big></b><br>
   <br>
   The winning post, if specified, is the square you must go on after you've 
 eaten all dituboxes, in order to win.<br>
   A winning post is represented by the "Here !" message written onto the 
ground.<br>
