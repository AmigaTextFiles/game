   <br>
   - Thanks for your interest in The Blue Mango Quest. This is our very first 
  game, and we are working on it since May, 2000 (we didn't know a lot of 
things  about game programming / game arts when we started this project, that's
why  it took so long). It took us a lot of time and we learned a lot. We
said we'll finish it, and i think we'll do :-)<br>
    NB: The Blue Mango Quest was called "ShmixMan 3D" until July, 2001.<br>
     <br>
     - The version numbering system of MangoQuest and MangoPeeler is defined
  as  follow : version 1.0.0 will be the game as we thought about it when
we  decided  to make this game and freeze gameplay / features.<br>
      Version 1.0.0 will contain a scenario mode and a skirmish mode. Currently, 
  only skirmish mode is here.<br>
      The goal is to be able to play on a single map (chosen on command
line   or using the launcher for win32 users).<br>
     <br>
     - This is version 0.6.0 which means <b>we have done 60% of the work</b>
   . This version  contains all the mechanisms of gameplay (all bonus, "monsters", 
 and so on).<br>
     At this time, <b>there is no sound, no music</b>. It is planned for
next  version,  or maybe 0.8.0.<br>
    This rule is not true for the level editor. Its version is 0.6.0 but
it  is fully functional (only a config file and some code cleanups / bugfixes 
 will be added).<br>
   <b>Design of monsters is not completed, it is even not created at this 
time.</b>   We use textured spheres in this version.<br>
  <br>
  - Mango Quest uses a home-made portal-based engine. Currently, the geometry
 (walls...) is very simple (not very beautiful) but the game aims to be fast.
 Maybe it will change.<br>
  The more your map contains walls, the more FPS you should have.<br>
    <br>
    - We provide two separeted programs : the game (mangoquest) and its editor 
 (mangopeeler) are separate executables. However, <b>mangopeeler depends on
 mangoquest for textures.</b><br>
     <br>
     - Requirements : OpenGL-capable graphic card, a working operating system 
  with working drivers for your graphic card.&nbsp;<b> SDL, SDL_ttf and SDL_image 
libraries  are required (included in win32 binary package for windows users).</b><br>
     See <a href="http://www.libsdl.org"><u>www.libsdl.org</u></a>
 for downloading if you don't have them.<br>
      <br>
     - Don't hesitate to submit patches :) and please, give us feedback.<br>
     <br>
     - <i>We hope you'll have some fun playing our game !</i><br>

      </ul>
     - In order to reduce packages size, and since this is a test version,
 only  the first world textures set is available. Don't try to create maps
 for the  3 other worlds, otherwise it will won't work and produce errors.<br>
     <br>
     - type : 'mangoquest -h' and 'mangopeeler -h' for quick help on command
  line<br>
     <br>

     <br>
     - Map search path for BMQ :<br>
     * linux users : when you load a map in BMQ, the game search in this
order   :<br>
     &nbsp;- if you specify a complete and correct path and filename, it
uses   it<br>
     &nbsp;- if you only specify a filename or an invalide complete path
:<br>
     &nbsp; &nbsp;- it looks in the current working directory<br>
     &nbsp; &nbsp;- it looks in the general map (built-in maps) directory 
($(prefix)/share/...)<br>
     &nbsp; &nbsp;- it looks in your personal BMQ folder (~/.mangoquest/maps/)<br>
     <br>
     &nbsp;* windows users :<br>
     &nbsp; - if you use the loader, it use the selected file<br>
     &nbsp; - else : <br>
     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- it looks in the current directory<br>
     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- it looks in the built-in maps direvtory (data_jeu/maps)<br>
     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- it looks in your personal maps directory (customs/maps)<br>
  <br>
  MP : when you create a map, it will be saved in ~/.mangoquest/maps/ for 
linux users or customs/maps for windows users.<br>
    <br>
    - Read INSTALL (linux) file for installation instructions.<br>
   Basically, you'll have to type: "./configure &amp;&amp; make" (as users) 
 and then "make install" (as root)<br>
   &nbsp;(without the quotes).<br>
     &nbsp; <br>
         
      <ul>
                   
        <li><b><big>Known bugs</big></b></li>
         
      </ul>
     - Collision detection between player and walls will be rewritten for 
version   0.7.0. The current collision detection is buggy : on some special 
cases,  you can enter in wall, which is detected, exits the game and writes 
the error on the command line. This bug appears more on slow computers.<br>
  <br>
  - You must place walls all around the map when you create a map and at
least  one wall square inside the map. This will be fixed soon. This is a
consequence  of the portal-based engine : if you don't place walls inside
the room, no  portal needs to be created, so no sector is created, so there
is a problem.  It is easy to fix, thus it will be done in next minor version
(0.6.1).<br>
 <br>
 - In-game timer : if you pause and unpause (with P) or respawn (once you're 
dead), the remaining time might increase.... well, i fact, it WILL increase.<br>
   
      <ul>
       
        <li><b><big>Some warnings about source code</big></b></li>
         
      </ul>
     - 1 week before this release, the code of the game was totally rewritten 
  from scratch (the old code was not as I wanted). As a result, there might 
  be some stupid bugs (mainly typos) remaining.<br>
     Moreover, there are very few comments. This will be fixed very soon.<br>
     - The code of Mango Peeler has not yet been rewritten, but it will be
 one  day (before 0.7.0 I hope). Currently, it is very badly coded (variable
 names  are in french and so on).<br>
     - <b>Never forget it is our first game :-)</b><br>
