YACHT (v1.1)
the immortal dice game
by Richard Gallagher

  This version of the famous five-of-a-kind dice game features the familiar
scorepad on screen and an easy mouse-controlled interface.  The rules are so
well known they will only briefly be discussed here.

  A game consists of thirteen turns rolling five dice.  During each turn,
the dice may be rolled a maximum of three times.  After the first roll, a
player may save any number of dice and roll the remaining dice only.  Each
turn ends when the player fills a scorepad space.
  In the top half of the scorepad, the player scores by adding only the dice
that match the number for that row.  If the player's top half total is 63 or
better (average of three per number), a bonus of 35 points is added to the
top half sub-total.
  In the bottom half of the scorepad the score is equal to the total of all
five dice, unless otherwise indicated.  "Full House" is three-of-a-kind plus
two-of-a-kind.  "Small Straight" is four consecutive dice and "Large Straight"
is a sequence of all five dice.  "Five-of-a-kind" is 50 points the first time
and 100 bonus points each sucessive time.  "All Dice" is always available as
the total of all five dice.

  When the program is run, enter the number of players (1-4) and their names.
A short instruction screen follows.  This information can be referred to
during the game by selecting the "Help" menu item.  Click the left mouse
button to begin the game.  The dice roll is controlled by the two box gadgets
in the upper right-hand corner.  Player #1 clicks on the "ROLL #1" gadget to
start the dice roll.  The red dice keep rolling until Player #1 clicks on
the "STOP ROLL" gadget.  After each roll, the possible scores are displayed
on the scorepad in red.  Any time a player wishes to fill a scorepad space
and end his turn, simply click on the appropriate scorepad space.  To save
a die, simply click on the die.  The die is moved to the right side of the
screen and its color is changed to white.  Only red dice will be rolled
when the ROLL box is clicked.  Click on a white (saved) die to restore all
dice to active (red).  After the third roll, a red numbered space on the
scorepad must be filled.  The program automatically fills in the "Five of a
kind" space and the last scores of the game.
  After the game, a six-game score sheet is displayed with bonus points
listed separately.  If you wish to keep playing with the same names, click
on the "SAME NAMES" box.  If you wish to erase the scores and names and
begin as if you were first running the program, select the "START OVER" box.
To exit the game, select "Quit" from the "Exit" menu or press Right-Amiga-Q.
