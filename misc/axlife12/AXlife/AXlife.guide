@node life "About Life"

  The Game of Life was invented by the mathematician John Horton Conway,
  and has gone on to become the most famous example of a cellular automata.
  The idea is to demonstrate that complex behaviour can result from the
  application of very simple rules, which are:

  The game is played on an infinite two-dimensional plane, composed of
  squares (cells). At any time a cell can only be either alive or dead.
  Time progresses in discrete steps, with the pattern of live and dead
  cells at a given time being refered to as a generation. Each new
  generation depends only on the previous generation. Given a generation,
  the next generation is calculated by looking at each cell in turn. A
  live cell will stay alive if surrounded by two or three neighbours,
  otherwise it will die. A dead cell will be reborn only if surrounded by
  exactly three neighbours.

  To see this in effect, run AXlife and select "Open" from the @{"Project" link project}
  menu. Files to try include "acorn.life" and "rpentomino.life", both of
  which start with only a few cells but rapidly produce a large pattern,
  or "puffertrain.life" and "breeder.life", both of which produce an ever
  growing pattern. Select "Generate" from the @{"Cells" link cells} menu to start the
  generation process. Some of the files contain quite detailed comments
  about the design and purpose of the pattern, which help to teach how to
  make new patterns.

  Life can be used to generate objects of fantastic complexity. Logic
  gates and even (in theory) a Turing machine (i.e. a completely general
  computer) can be created. For example, in the included patterns (taken
  from the Xlife distribution and Al Hensel's IBM PC program "Life") are
  a prime number sieve, a pseudo-random number generator and several
  systems for implementing memory registers.

  For more information, see:

    William Poundstone's "The Recursive Universe" (Oxford University Press)
    Martin Gardner's "Mathematical Games" column in Scientific American,
      Octocber 1970 and February 1971.

@node xlife "Xlife and AXlife"

  AXlife is based on Xlife, the definitive life program, which runs under
  Unix X-Windows. AXlife incorporates an Amiga-specific interface, but the
  generation code remains the same as in Xlife 2.0. AXlife can also read
  files produced by Al Hensel's IBM PC program "Life", which has a very
  similar format.

  The most important feature of Xlife (and AXlife) is that, unlike
  most life programs, it does not limit the pattern to the size of the
  screen. Xlife does not think in terms of a rectangular grid, but instead
  considers the pattern to be composed of 8x8 boxes containing active life
  elements. This allows Xlife to cope with arbitrarily large patterns (up
  to a maximum size of 2^32 by 2^32 (2^32 = 4,294,967,296)). The best
  demonstration of this is the "breeder.life" patterns, which all grow at
  an ever increasing rate. On a fast computer, these patterns rapidly
  become *very* large.

  From the Xlife distribution:

@node run "Running AXlife"

  The most important thing you need to run AXlife is memory, and plenty of
  it. AXlife will not load unless you have around one megabyte of free
  memory, and as a pattern grows more memory is consumed. This is due to
  the method used to calculate the next generation, which involves a huge
  lookup table. For large patterns, this is by far the most efficient
  approach. AXlife requires either @{"asl.library" link asl} or @{"reqtools.library" link reqtools} and,
  to be able to access the online help, @{"amigaguide.library" link amigaguide}. AXlife will
  also try to use @{"textfield.gadget" link textfield} to allow editing of comments. If this
  file cannot be found, comments can only be viewed.

  AXlife can take several arguments from the Shell or as ToolTypes in its
  icon. In either case, the format is identical. The arguments are:

    PUBSCREEN=<pubscreen name>

      Specifies that AXlife is to open on the named public screen, e.g.
      PUBSCREEN=PowerPacker. If the screen is not available AXlife falls
      back onto the default public screen. Note that the name of a public
      screen is case sensitive.

    FILREQ=<left/top/width/height>

      Specifies the position and size of the file requester used for
      loading and saving life patterns., e.g. FILEREQ=0/0/320/200. Out
      of range values are ignored. If a value is negative, then the
      default value will be used, e.g. FILEREQ=-1/0/-1/200 causes the
      requester to be 200 pixels high and start at the top of the screen,
      but with the default width and left position.

    HIDE

      Enables the "Hide Cells" item of the @{"Options" link options} menu.

    STATUS

      Enables the "Show Status" item of the @{"Options" link options} menu.

    CELLS

      Enables the "Cell Count" item of the @{"Options" link options} menu.

    CLROPEN

      Enables the "Clear on Open" item of the @{"Options" link options} menu.

    MAG

      Specifies the magnification to use, i.e. MAG=n, where n is one of
      1, 2, 4, 8, 16, -2, -4 or -8. Positive magnification values indicate
      zooming in, negative ones zooming out. When AXlife is running, the
      magnification is controlled by the "Magnification" sub-menu of the
      @{"Options" link options} menu. On the menu, 1/2 corresponds to MAG=-2, 1/4 to
      MAG=-4, and so on.

    BORDER=<RIGHT|BOTTOM>

      Controls which border the window sizing gadget appears in. The
      default is the right border.

    REQTOOLS

      Causes reqtools.library to be used for all requesters. This can be
      useful as, unlike the Asl file requester, ReqTools buffers the
      current directory.

    COORDS

      Enables the "Show Coords" item of the @{"Options" link options} menu.
@endnode
@node keys "Mouse and Keys"

  The centre of the displayed area can be chosen by clicking on the
  desired new centre square with the left mouse button. The following keys
  can be used in AXlife. The first group of keys can also be used in edit
  mode.

  <Return>, <Enter> or 'o'	Perform a single generation.
  Keypad 1			Move centre of display down and left.
  Keypad 2			Move centre of display down.
  Keypad 3			Move centre of display down and right.

@endnode
@node project "Project Menu"

  Open		 A file requester opens to allow selection of a life
		 pattern to be loaded. If the @{"file format" link format} is relative,
		 then the file will be loaded relative to the origin (see
		 the "Set Origin" item in the @{"Options" link options} menu). If the "Clear
		 on Open" item of the Options menu has been selected, then
		 the life pattern currently in memory will be lost,
		 otherwise the new pattern will be overlayed on the current
		 one.

  Save As	 A file requester opens to allow the selection of a name to
		 save the current pattern under. Any information in the
		 "Comments" requester will also be saved. If the file
		 already exists, a requester will appear to confirm the
		 overwriting of the file.

  Comments	 A window opens which contains information about the
		 current pattern, namely a descriptive name for the pattern
		 (which is unrelated to the name the file is saved as), the
		 owner of the pattern, and any comments. All these can be
		 edited by clicking on the appropriate gadgets (for more
		 information on the keys available while editing comments,
		 see @{"textfield.gadget" link textfield}).

  Help		 If @{"amigaguide.library" link amigaguide} is available, displays this help
		 file.

  About		 Some information about AXlife.

  Quit		 Quits AXlife. Any unsaved patterns will be lost.
@endnode
@node cells "Cells Menu"

  Clear		 Clears the current life pattern from memory, leaving an
		 empty life plane.

  Randomize	 Fills the area of the life plane on display with a random
		 pattern of live cells. Due to the way AXlife works, such
		 random patterns are very inefficient and will take a long
		 time to generate.

  Centre	 Centres the displayed area on the weighted centre of the
		 complete pattern. The "5" key on the numeric keypad has
		 the same function.

  Generate	 If this is checked, generations are calculated
		 continuously. If not, no calculating is done.

  One Generation If the "Generate" option is not checked, this will cause
		 a single generation to be calculated and displayed,
		 giving a single-step method to observe the evolution of
		 a pattern. This can also be acheived by pressing either
		 of the <Return> or <Enter> keys.

  New Rules	 The default rules for life are 23/3, which means that a
		 cell stays alive if surrounded by 2 or 3 neighbours, and
		 that a cell is reborn if surrounded by 3 other cells. If
		 you wish to try different rules, enter the new rules in
		 the string gadget and press <Return>, or click on
		 "Accept". The format must always be numbers representing
		 the possible numbers of neighbours when a cell stays
		 alive, a forward slash (/), and then numbers representing
		 when a cell will be reborn.

  Benchmark	 This gives an indication of the raw speed of the life
		 generation engine. Enter the number of generations to time
		 over in the gadget and press <Return>, or click on "Time".
		 The generations will be calculated, but not displayed, as
		 displaying the pattern can use up a lot of cpu time (see
		 "Hide Cells" in the @{"Options" link options} menu). When this is complete,
		 a requester will appear giving the total time taken and
		 the average generation rate.
@endnode
@node options "Options Menu"

  Edit Mode	 If this options is selected, the current pattern can be
		 edited. When the mouse pointer is over a specific cell,
		 clicking the left mouse button puts a live cell at that
		 point, while clicking the right mouse button clears the
		 cell (i.e. puts a dead cell). Note that in this mode the
		 menus are disabled (so that the right mouse button can be
		 used for cell editing), but @{"keys" link keys} are still functional.
		 Edit mode can be exited by pressing the <Esc> key, or by
		 pressing both mouse buttons.

  Hide Cells	 The computer can spend almost all its time updating the
		 display rather than calculating the next generation. If
		 it is required that the generation engine runs as fast as
		 possible, select this option to avoid redrawing the
		 display. When this option is deselected, the pattern will
		 reappear. On a fast machine with this switch on, AXlife
		 runs *extrememly* quickly.

  Show Status	 If selected, AXlife to print the number of generations
		 and of boxes (the generation engine treats the entire
		 pattern as composed of 8x8 boxes) in the window title bar.

  Cell Count	 If this and the above "Show Status" options are selected,
		 then in addition to printing the number of generations and
		 boxes, AXlife will print the total number of live cells
		 for each generation. Note that this requires further
		 calculation and will cause a noticeable drop in generation
		 speed.

  Clear on Open	 If this option is selected, then the current pattern is
		 erased before a new pattern is loaded (via the "Open" item
		 in the @{"Project" link project} menu).

  Set Origin	 Initially, relative files are loaded relative to the
		 centre of the display. If this item is selected, clicking
		 the left mouse button sets the origin to a new position,
		 and pressing <Esc> leaves this mode without setting the
		 origin. If the display is cleared or centred then the
		 origin is reset to the centre of the display.

  Show Coords	 When this option is selected, the current co-ordinates
		 of the mouse pointer on the life plane are shown in the
		 window title bar. The co-ordinate origin is that defined
		 above by the "Set Origin" option. Co-ordinates are always
		 displayed when in edit mode.

  Magnification	 This submenu determines the size of each cell on screen.
		 If 1 is selected, then each cell is represented by a
		 single pixel; if 2 is selected, then each cell is
		 represented by a 2x2 square; if 4 then by a 4x4 square,
		 and so on. For fractional magnifications (e.g. 1/2), each
		 pixel represents more than one (in this example, 4) cells.
		 If any of the cells are active, the pixel appears filled.

@node format "Life File Format"

  Life patterns are stored as ASCII files. A line beginning with a hash (#)
  has a special meaning, depending on the next character:

    #N	  The rest of the line is the descriptive name of the file, which
	  is not related to the actual file name the file is stored as.

    #O	  The rest of the line gives the owner of the file.

    #C	  The rest of the line is a comment (see the "Comment" item in the
 or #D	  @{"Project" link project} menu).

    #A	  This specifies that the data is in absolute xy coordinate pairs,
	  each pair specifying an active cell in the pattern. The data is
	  absolute in the sense that the loaded pattern appears in the
	  same place relative to the display as when it was saved.

    #R	  This specifies that the data is in relative xy coordinate pairs,
	  each pair specifying an active cell in the pattern. The data is
	  loaded relative to the origin (see the "Set Origin" item in the
	  @{"Options" link options} menu). The data can be offset by a coordinate pair
	  which optionally follows the #R, e.g. #R 10 11.

    #P	  This specifies that the data is stored in picture format, with
	  an asterisk (*) representing a live cell and any other character
	  an empty cell. The data is loaded relative to the origin, as
	  above. The data can be offset by a coordinate pair which
	  optionally follows the #P. A file can contain more than one
	  picture element, each with its own #P.

    #I	  The rest of the line specifies a file to be included, so that
	  Life patterns can be nested. Beware of including patterns not
	  in the same path as the parent pattern, as path conventions
	  differ between the Amiga and UNIX (This does not occur in any
	  of the supplied patterns). The data can be offset by a
	  coordinate pair which optionally follows the #I.

  It is not necessary for a file to contain all (or indeed any) of the
  above. If non of #A, #R or #P are specified, #A is assumed.
@endnode
@node history "History"

  1.0	* First release.

  1.1   * New "Help" menu item to call up this file.
	* Pressing the "Help" key now also brings up this file. If a
	  menu is selected when the "Help" key is presses, help on
	  that menu is displayed.
	* Better SysIHack compatibility.
	* If available, @{"textfield.gadget" link textfield} is used to provide a multi-
	  line string gadget for the "Comments" window.
	* If the user attempts to save to a file which already exists,
	  a requester appears to confirm the save.

  1.2	* Fractional magnifications (1/2, 1/4, 1/8, ...) now available.
	* Completely SysIHack compatible.
	* The diagonal movement keypad keys are now truly diagonal, i.e.
