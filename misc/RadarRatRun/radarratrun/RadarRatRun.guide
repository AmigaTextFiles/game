			Introduction
			------------
	 Welcome to my very first attempt at writing
	a game, so why go to all this trouble well
	back in the early days I had a computer
	called VIC20 made by Commodore which had a
	massive 20Kram! Yes 20 kilobyte.
	 Well my favourite game on this computer was
	Radar Rat Race, and I have been looking
	everywhere for an Amiga version, After having
	no luck I decided to have a go myself.
	 This game is programmed in AMOSPro basic and
	compiled with AMOSCompiler.

			The game
			--------
	 You control the blue mouse Mortimer with
	the joystick, you must guide him through the
	maze to find cheese for him to eat, taking
	care to avoid the red rats.
	 The rats are trying to catch Mortimer before
	he eats all the cheese, Fortunately for
	Mortimer the rats are very short sighted and
	have to use there noses to smell where
	Mortimer is, So when mortimer eats the cheese
	it gives him a bad stomach, so when you press
	the fire button Mortimer lets out the wind
	(This is the polite way of putting it) so
	putting the rats of his sent for a short time.
