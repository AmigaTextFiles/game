 REGULAR GAME TYPE

   This game type is like the one player mode. But now you are two
   snakes that have to battle for the numbers.
   Remember, the more numbers you pick up, the more points you get.

 SURROUND GAME TYPE

   In the surround game type the aim of the game is to trap the other
   player with your body. The fun part is that your tail just gets longer
   and longer all the time. And it never stops until one player is dead.

 OPTIONS

   Here you setup the game as you like it.
   You change the settings by moving the cursor to the option that you
   wish to change and then press fire.

   LIVES: 1-5
      Number of lives each player has when he starts.

   SPEED: Slow, Medium or Fast
      This is how fast the snakes in the game moves.

   ADD: 3, 5 or 10
      This is how many bodyparts that are added to the end of the snake
      every time you pick up a number.

   Wrap: On/Off
      If wrapping is ON, then you can move through the grey walls at the
      top, bottom and sides of the screen.

   Music: On/Off
      This turns ON or switches OFF ingame music.

   Save Options
      This lets you keep the options that you have edited until the next
      time you start Snakes. If you only want to use the options you have
      edited in this Snakes session then you do not need to save.

   Back...
      This takes you back to the main menu.

@TOC "MAIN"

 LEVELEDITOR INSTRUCTIONS

   You control the cursor with a joystick in port 2.
   Depending on the current drawmode you can either draw or delete
   a block by pressing fire.

   Press SPACE to change the drawmode. (Draw/Delete)

   Press RETURN to change the current block to draw. (Rotates)

   Press 1 or 2 to place the starting position of either player.
      The cursor animation will stop until you have selected the
      starting direction by pressing a cursor key.

   Press DEL to clear the drawing area and start with the level.

   You can select which level to load or save by using the following keys:
      F1 = Level -1
      F2 = Level +1
      F3 = Level -10
      F4 = Level +10
      F5 = Level -100
      F6 = Level +100

   Press S to save the current level. But be careful so you don't
      overwrite an already saved level. Make sure that the position
      that you save to is empty.

   Press L to load the current level. This will erase the current edited
      level and display the loaded level instead.

   Finally ... Press ESC to quit to the Workbench.

   WARNING! Make sure that it is possible to get into and out of all
            empty spaces, or Snakes might put numbers where the players
            can't reach them.
