                Galaxy Ship Designer V1.02  ©1997 A.C. Murie
                ============================================


Introduction :
--------------

    This is a small utility designed to assist with designing ships for the
PBEM game "Galaxy" by Russell Wallace.


Requirements :
--------------
    Workbench 2.04 or greater is required.


Distribution :
--------------
    This program is freeware. It may be distributed freely, provided it is
not modified in any way. You may charge at most a minimal copying fee.


Usage :
-------
    Double click on the icon, or run it from the CLI.


Instructions :
--------------
    The main window has a set of sliders, 4 buttons and a group of text
display gadgets. The five sliders can be set to give the values for drive,
attacks, weapons, shields and cargo for the ship design.

    The program will automatically calculate the ship mass and required
production points for 1 ship, its cargo capacity and the shield and speed
ratings. The latter are displayed for an empty ship and a fully loaded
ship.

    Clicking on the "Technology" button opens a window with 4 sliders to
set the technology levels for the ship.

    "About" shows a simple 'about' requester.

    "Save Prefs" saves the window positions to disk. In any case, the
program will remember the window positions between sessions.

    "Reset all" will reset all 9 sliders to 0, but will ask for
confirmation first.


Guarantee :
-----------
    As this program is freeware, no guarantee of any kind is available. The
author will under no circumstances be responsible for any damage that
occurs as a result of running this program.

    It has been tested in a real game using the GalaxyNG server, and
appears to give reliable results. However, in the result of any
inaccuracies the user, and not the author, is responsible for any poorly
designed ships  :)


Bug reports and comments :
