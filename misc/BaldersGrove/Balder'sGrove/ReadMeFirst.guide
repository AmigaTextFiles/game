@NODE Introduction "Introduction"
 This  is yet another Boulderdash clone but this time it is inspired by the
 Nordic  mythology.   Your  task  is  to  guide Balder - the god of light -
 through  groves  filled  with  berserks  and snakes.  Collect  rings, push
 runestones and try to find the small passage to the next level.

 This  time you don't have to play alone.  Get a helping hand from a friend
 and I assure you the game will be easier as well as funnier.

 The  game  comes  with  40  levels  and a level editor.  Unfortunately the
 levels are almost identical with those included in previous releases.  The
 only  exception  is  that you can use them all in two player mode.  If you
 have made some own levels with the old level editor you can still use them
 with  this  new  game  package in one player mode.  To be able to use them
 with  two  players you will have to load them into the level editor, place
 entrances and exits for player two, and save them.

 I hope you will have a good time!

@NODE Requirements "Requirements"
 These programs need Workbench 2.04 or higher.  They have been tested on an
 A500  with 1M CHIP and 2M FAST, and an A3000 with 2M CHIP and 4M FAST, but
 will  hopefully run on other configurations too, provided that you have at
 least 1M CHIP.

 You  may try running the game and the level editor simultaneously, this is
 very handy when editing and testing new levels, but be careful so that you
 don't run out of chip mem.

@NODE Installation "Installation"
 Copy  the  contents  of  the  'Fonts' directory to FONTS:  by clicking the

 Finished!!!
