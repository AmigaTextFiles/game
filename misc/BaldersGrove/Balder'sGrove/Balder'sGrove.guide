@NODE Introduction "Introduction"
 This  is  a  freely  distributable  game  based  on the Boulderdash idea,
 dedicated  to  all  Boulderdash  fans.  I have tried to stick as close as
 possible  to  the  old  Commodore version, because I think it is the best
 one!

 There are only 40 levels included in this package, but by using the level
 editor  you are able to create 60 more (or replace the 40 original levels
 with new, better ones).  Read 'BGLevEd.guide' for more information.


@ENDNODE

@NODE Starting_up "Starting up"
 You  can  start  the game from either Workbench or Shell, version 2.04 or
 higher.   If you are using Shell, make sure that the 'Level' directory is
 in  the current directory.  If the game won't start it will tell you why,
 using an alert.  When succeeded it shows you @{" the title screen " Link The_title_screen}.


@ENDNODE

@NODE The_title_screen "The title screen"
 Use  the  joystick to select from the menu whether you want to practice or
 play  a real  game, single  or @{" two player mode " Link Two_player_mode}, and  choose a @{" level " Link Levels} to
 start  at.   If  you  decide to play you can start only from levels ending
 with  a  '0'  or  a  '5'.   When practicing you are able to start from any
 level,  but  you  will only get one life and you won't proceed to the next
 stage when you have finished your selected level.

 If  your  selected  level doesn't exist, you will automatically start from
 level 00.  The same thing happens when you have finished one level and the
 next is not to be found.


@ENDNODE

@NODE Levels "Levels"
 There  are  two types of levels.  The first one is the ordinary level, or
 simply  'level'.   It is 40×30 squares, and covers four 'normal' screens.
 The screen will scroll when you approach the edges.

 The  second  type is the intermission.  This is one fourth of an ordinary
 level  (20×15  squares) and covers only one screen.  If you have an NTSC-
 amiga  it  covers  a  bit  more  than  one  screen and there will be some
 scrolling here too.  While playing you will note another difference.  You
 won't  lose  any  life  if  you die, instead you will move on to the next
 level.  If you find the exit, you get a bonus life.  Bonus lives are also
 given for every 10000 points you reach.

 When  you  have  completed  a  level you get 7 points for every remaining
 timeunit.


@ENDNODE

@NODE Two_player_mode "Two player mode"
 Now  you  don't  have to play alone.  If you get some help from a friend,
 the  game will be both easier and funnier.  Just select 'Two player game'
 or  'Two  player  practice'  from  the  menu, start the game and, whoops,
 there's  another  Balder!   He  is  controlled by a joystick in the mouse
 port.   You  can't use the mouse (unless you are very good at imitating a
 joystick :-).

 A  life  is lost only when both players get killed or the time is up.  It
 is  not  necessary  that  both players find the exits (yes, there are two
 exits but they  are  identical)  in order to move on to the next @{" level " Link Levels}.
 Therefore it is possible to sacrifice one man if the way is blocked (this
 is also a good test for friendship, who want's to be blown up...:-).  See
 @{" Keys " Link Keys} for more information on how to do this.

 However, you won't get the bonus points for remaining seconds unless both
 players  exits.   To get a bonus life in an intermission it is sufficient
 that one player finds the exit.

@NODE The_game "The game"
 All  objects and characters correspond to an object or a character in the
 original  Boulderdash game.  They don't look quite the same so I guess an
 introduction is appropriate.

 BALDER		This is you!  A young Nordic god who thinks everything is
		good.   Use  your joystick to make him move.  If you keep
		the  button  pressed  he  will  only  touch  the adjacent
		square.

 BUSH		Has nothing to do with an American expresident. Just walk
		on  it and  it disappears.  It  keeps berserks  and snakes
		away and stops falling rings and stones.

 RING		Collect these, and you will see the exit open.

 RUNESTONE	Stones normally follow the law of gravity and so do these,
		just  like  the  rings.   Remove  the  object they rest on
		and  they  will  fall  down.  Push them if there are empty
		squares behind.  Use them to kill berserks and snakes.

 FENCE		Looks  like  four  plaited  boards.  You  can't remove it
		simply  by  walking  on  it,  but it will disappear by an
		explosion caused by a berserk or a snake.

 EXPANDING FENCE Looks  like a fence but it  will expand to the  right and
		 the  left if it finds  an empty square.  Be carefull with
		 this  one!   It  blocks your way very easy, especially if
		 you  are  two players.  Try to stick as close as possible
		 to each other.

 MAGIC FENCE	This one transforms runestones into rings and vice versa.
		You  start  it  by  dropping a stone or a ring on it.  It
		will  stay active  only for a settled time, and you won't
		be  able  to  activate  it  again when this time is over.
		Make sure there is enough space below the magic fence for
		the  transformed  rings  and  stones or else they will be
		forever lost!

 STOCKS		Two  stocks  together.  All @{" levels " Link Levels}  are  surrounded  by
		stocks.  They are the only things that are indestructible.

 EXIT		Looks  exactly  like  stocks until it opens.  It is often
		placed  in  the  border among stocks.  Unlike stocks, the
		exit  is  NOT  indestructible.  An explosion will blow it
		out.

 THORSHAMMER	This  is  the  hammer  that  Thor,  the  god  of thunder,
		carries.   Now  it  helps Balder by destroying everything
		that is evil.  Both berserks and snakes will explode when
		they touch a Thorshammer.

 BERSERK	A viking running around the screen, following the edge of
		empty squares. If you touch him or drop a stone or a ring
		at  him, he will explode leaving upto nine empty squares.
		If you are too close you lose a life.

 SNAKE		Much  the same as the berserk, except it will leave rings
		instead of empty squares when it explode.

 The  last row of the game screen shows you some interesting and important
 information.  It could look something like this:

	S: 001346  R: 023  T: 129  L:27  M: 2

 You  have  probably  already  guessed what the letters denote, but I will
 give a short explanation anyway.

	S - Score
	R - Rings left to take before the exit will open
	T - Time left
	L - Level
	M - Men left including the one you are using right now


@ENDNODE

@NODE Keys "Keys"
 Beside the joystick there are a few keys that effect the game.

	SPACE		Pause the game
	ESC		Suicide  key  for player  one (if  you get  stuck
			somewhere)
	DEL		Suicide key for player two
	ALT ESC		Collective suicide, you lose all you men


@ENDNODE

@NODE Files "Files"
 The  tune  is a Med module located in the home directory in a file called
 'Title.mod'.   If  you  don't like it (music wasn't my best subject), you
 can replace it with any 4-channel Med song (OctaMED V2.00 or earlier) you
 like.

 The highscore list is saved in the current directory as 'BGHighScores'.


@ENDNODE

@NODE History "History"
 V1.20  @{" Two  player  mode " Link Two_player_mode}  implemented.  A tune is played when the title
	screen  is displayed.  Minor changes in graphics and sounds.  Some
	bug fixes.

 V1.11	The game now works with NTSC-machines too!  I had to change the
	title screen a bit.
	Unfortunately you won't get the same good survey of the game
	screen with NTSC-machines as with PAL-machines. Sorry.

 V1.0	First release.
