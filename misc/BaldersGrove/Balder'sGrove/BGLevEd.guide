@NODE Introduction "Introduction"
 This  is  a freely distributable level editor for the Balder's Grove game.
 It  hasn't  got any advanced functions, but on the other hand it is pretty
 simple to use, and I think it fulfills its purpose.

 You  can  make new levels or edit old ones.  You can't, however, test your
 levels  from the editor.  To do this, save the level, start the game, turn
 on practice mode and select the level you just saved.

@NODE How_to_edit "How to edit"
 This  editor  has some similarities to a painting program.  The levels are
 painted  on  the  edit  screen using the mouse.  In front of and below the
 edit  screen  is  a  small  screen  located.  The left part of this screen
 contains  the  palette  consisting  of  13 squares.  They are from left to
 right:

 Ring,  runestone, bush, empty square, fence, expanding fence, magic fence,
 stocks, thorshammer, snake, berserk, entrance, exit.

 For more information about these, see Balder'sGrove.guide.

 Select a square by clicking the mouse.  If you have selected the ring, the
 runestone,  the  snake  or  the  berserk  and you select it again, it will
 rotate 90 degrees.

 After  selecting  a  square,  move the mousepointer to the edit screen and
 place  the  square  at  the desired place by clicking.  You can choose any
 place  you  want  excluding  the  border.   At the border only stocks, the
 entrances and the exits can be placed.

 Starting  with  V1.20  you can and must place entrances and exits for both
 players.  You select the entrance for player two by clicking at the gadget
 with  the  entrance twice.  The number two (2) will appear at the entrance
 and  you  can  now  place it (almost) wherever you like.  The only rule is
 that  the  two  entrances  must  not  be separated by more then 18 squares
 horizontally  and  10  squares vertically.  All this applies for the exits
 too, except that there is no limit in distance between two exits.

 When  you  play  a  game  in one player mode the entrance and the exit for
 player  two  will  be replaced by stocks.  Remember this so that you don't
 make levels that are solvable only in two player mode.

 There  can't be more than one entrance and one exit for each player on the
 screen  at  the same time.  To delete an entrance or an exit, simply cover
 it with another square.  Use stocks if it is placed at the border.

 All gadgets to the right of the palette, except for the RND-gadget, pop up
 requesters.   The  NEW-, LOAD- and QUIT-gadgets also give you a warning if
 you haven't saved the level you are editing.

 RND	Places  20  pieces of  the current selected square randomly on the
	screen.  Will not work when the entrance or the exit is selected.

 SET	Allows  you to set some important parameters for this level:
	the  maximal time for completing the level, the number of rings to
	collect  before the exit will open, the value of each ring and the
	duration of the magic fence.

 NEW	Guess  what this  one does?  Right, it gives you a new fresh level
	or an intermission filled with the current selected square, except
	when  you  have  picked  the  entrance  or the exit.  Then it uses
	bushes.

 LOAD	Loads  a level or an intermission from the Level directory in  the
	current directory.

 SAVE	Saves  a  level or an  intermission to the Level directory.  To be
	able  to  save  a  level you must have placed the entrance and the
	exit for both players.

 QUIT	Exits the level editor.


 I  don't  think there is more to say.  Use your imagination and your logic
 sense when designing levels.  Remember that anything produced by the level
 editor is public domain, so you are welcome to modify the levels that come
 with  this  package.  You can also send your levels to me if you like, all
 contributions are welcome.
