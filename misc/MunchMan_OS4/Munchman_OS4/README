Requirements:
 * libSDL - see http://www.libsdl.org
   (SDL has other requirements, like pthreads and X,
    which you should have already)

How to play:

 Press Enter to start the game.  Use the arrow keys to guide MunchMan.
 The goal is to eat all of the pellets.  You know Pacman, right?
 The Escape key quits the game.  Have fun when you get to Level 4. =P

Command line options:

   --small              Uses 320x200 resolution instead of 640x480.
                        Flag this option if the normal resolution makes
                        the game too slow.

   --fullscreen         Run fullscreen.  Whether or not it will work
                        is dependent on your system setup.

   --notimer            Turns off the framerate stablizer.  This can be
                        good when running fullscreen, as the game will
                        sync to the refresh rate of the video display
                        instead of using the clock.  This can mean
                        smoother gameplay.  You probably want to use
                        this when playing from the Linux framebuffer.

Notes:
 The game must be started from the directory containing the file mm.dat
