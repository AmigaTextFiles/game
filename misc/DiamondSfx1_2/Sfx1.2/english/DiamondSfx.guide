@NODE Intro "Introduction to V1.2"

 @{b}Welcome to DiamondSfx V1.2@{ub}

 Using this program you are able to create your own sfx-file for Diamond
 Caves.

 Please read @{"The main window" Link MainWindow} on how to work with DiamondSfx.

 This program is based on MUI, see @{"About MUI" Link Mui}.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Req "Requirements"

 @{b}Requirements@{ub}

 @{u}DiamondSfx@{uu} V1.2 requires:

 - Kick 2.0
 - MUI 2.3 (3.x recommended)
 - a registered version of Diamond Caves V2.0
 - Commodore's Installer (can be found on your Workbench-Install-Disk)

 This program has beend tested with Enforcer and Mungwall.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Install "Installation"

 @{b}Installation@{ub}

 @{u}DiamondSfx@{uu} comes with a ready-to-run installer-script for the Commodore
 Installer. Just click on the icon and follow the text in the window.

 Basically, the script will copy all necessary files in the Directory "DC:"
 according to the present version.

@ENDNODE

@NODE MainWindow "The main window"

 At the top of the window there is a cycle-gadget where you can select the
 sample you want to edit. The following part is the same for every sample.

  @{b}Filename@{ub} contains name and path of your sample. Important: The final
  sfx-file only contains these filenames and not the samples itself!

  @{b}Samplingrate@{ub} is the frequency you want to play the sample with (in 10Hz).

  @{b}Volume@{ub} should be ovious: The Volume ! 0 is silence.

  @{b}Play Sample@{ub} loads the sample with the given name and plays it once


 @{b}Save@{ub} will store your settings into the file @{u}DC:sfx/sfx.data@{uu} where they
 will be found by the Diamond Caves Game. Remember: This file only contains
 the path and filename of every sample and not the sample itself!

 @{b}Default@{ub} resets every value to the default settings. If you want to us
 this, please make sure that the default samples (The files @{u}DC:sfx/y#?@{uu}) are
 present.

 @{b}Exit@{ub} will leave the program.


 If you want to use your own samples, please read @{"Using own samples" Link UseSamples}.

@ENDNODE

@NODE UseSamples "Using own samples"

 Using own samples within Diamond Caves is not very difficult, just follow
 these guidelines:

 - don't use @{u}long@{uu} samples. With normal gamespeed, every sample has about
 8/50 seconds (0.16 sec) to play. Only the Exposion needs about twice the
 time.

 - check out the cycle-gadget: This is the exact @{u}order@{uu} in which the samples
 are played, beginning with the timeout (= highes priority)

 - Adjust the @{u}volume@{uu} of each sample so that they all "fit together".

 - make sure, the samples are @{u}always present@{uu} on your harddisk because the
 sfx-file only contains the filename but not the sample itself.
