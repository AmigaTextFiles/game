@node "Introduction"
 The Wormalyzer is a small utility written in Blitz Basic 2.1 for the
 express purpose of analyzing custom levels for the Team 17 game Worms.
 
 The program will give useful statistics about the pixel distribution, and
 the space available for the worms to stand on.  It also displays the file
 comment that the level displays when used, and has a small scaled down
 graphic of the level being analyzed.
 
 It's not the most exciting piece of software ever written, but hey, it IS
 free :)
@endnode
@node Requirements
 The Wormalyzer uses Gadtools for its interface, and the asl file requester.
 
 I guess you'll need the asl.library and gadtools.library, which means OS2.x
 and above only I'm afraid.
 
 Apart from that, it should work fine on anything, send bug reports to @{"me" LINK "author"}
@endnode
@node Installation
 Just copy the Wormalyzer directory to where you want it, and run it from
 there.  The program will create a small config file in it's directory when
 it is ran.
 
 In addition make sure the required librarys are in libs: 
 see @{"requirements" LINK "Requirements"} for details.

@node Usage
 Once you've started it all up, you'll be presented with a window. 
 
 The big 'load' button will prompt you for the level to load, so click on
 that and select a worms level.
 
 The program gets on and analzyes the level, building up a small image of
 the level as it goes.  In addition, the file name, comment and the values
 of the levels gravity and friction will appear in the boxes at the top.
 
 The other text box contains the current status of the program.
 
 Once complete, the numeric gadgets on the right hand side will show some
 values.
 
 Each number refers to an aspect of the level:

 Total : The total number of non-background pixels in the level

 Top,Bottom,Left,Right : These refer to the number of pixels in each
                           of the sections, thusly;

                ______________________________________
               |                  |                   |
               |                  |                   |   Top
               |                  |                   |
               |__________________|___________________|
               |                  |                   |
               |                  |                   |
               |                  |                   |   Bottom
               |__________________|___________________|

                    Left                 Right

 This gives an indication as to the weighting of the level.

 Surface : The number of pixels available to stand in at the start of the
             game (ie, before bits have been blown off :)

 The cycle gadgets let you switch from pixels to a percentage.
 The total can be displayed as number of pixels, or as a percentage of
 the total number possible (which is 336000 pixels)
 The other stats can be displayed as number of pixels, or as a percentage
 of the total (whatever that may be).
 The surface is always shown as the number of pixels.

 And that's that!  Click Load to do another... :)

@node History
16/6/96 V2.0

   Major Update, added viewing of file comment, gravity and friction, as
   well as the all new superbly funky progress meter.  Thanks to everyone
   who mailed me with ideas.
   
3/6/96 V1.1 (Not Released)

   I tried the program on the Unix Amiga Emulator, and spotted some code
   that was mildy ineffecient, so I fixed it.  Didn't get released due to
   exams.
   
26/5/96 V1.0

   Due to this programs immense popularity :) I've decided to upload it to
   Aminet.  No major changes, but the code is more stable, and a few of the
   gadgets have been tweaked to make it all a bit more intuitive.  Slightly
   better error checking too...

13/5/96 V0.22

   Turned out the bug wasn't fixed after all, should be now though.
   It was a problem with the way blitz opens windows, A font with a point
   size different to 8 in the drag bar screwed up the opening of the window
   and positioning of the gadgets, bizzare.

9/5/96 V0.21

   Attempted to fix bug that made window open incorrectly, should be ok now

8/5/96 V0.2

   Fixed bug in surface calculation, should get it right now.
   Added progress meter, and option to view as percentages.
   Added storage of path in a data file.
   Added level name display.

4/5/96 V0.1 beta

   First public release.  Only available from My Web Site.

 The Wormalyzer was written by Glen Watts as a way to pass the time between
 exams.
 
 At present, the best way to contact me is via email at:

 If you prefer live chat, I'm on the efnet irc channel #amiga a fair bit
 under the handle Flabio.
 
 I also do other wormy things, such as draw levels.  My levels and some
 other stuff can be found at my worms web site:

 Which now includes some stuff about the upcoming worms AGA...
 
 Greetings go out to the following irc people...
