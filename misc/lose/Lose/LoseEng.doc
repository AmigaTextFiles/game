*** For what ??? ***

Lose V1.0 prints tickets for your raffle. You can print also lists
for the prizes, that are numbers add empty fields, where you manually
can fill in the correspording prize.

*** What do I need ??? ***

 - an AMIGA :-)

 - a printer :-)

 - with OS 2.0 I had problems with the text on the screen, but the
   program worked correctly :-(

 - nothing else

*** Installation ***

Only copy the program in to a directory of your choice. That's all.

*** Getting started ***

Start the program with a double click at its icon, or start it from the
CLI with no arguments.

*** Started - and then ??? ***

When you've started the program a window with some gadgets appears
on the screen:

 +-+-------------------------------------------+--+
 |o|Lose                                       |oO|
 +-+-------------------------------------------+--+
 |                   +----+                       |
 |  You begin at No. |1   |                       |
 |  +----+           +----+                       |
 |  |100 | tickets will be printed                |
 |  +----+----------------+                       |
 |  |  winning tickets    |  will be printed.     |
 |  +---------------------+                       |
 |                             +-------+  +----+  |
 |                             | Print |  |Quit|  |
 |                             +-------+  +----+  |

In the first "gadget" you can write the ticket number at wich you want 
to start.

 |                                     |
 |       Printing page 1 of 4          |
