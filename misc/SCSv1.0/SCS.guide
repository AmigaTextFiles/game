Introduction
************

   SCS is shareware, the registration fee is a measly $5

   If you use this program more than 10 times you should feel at least
   slightly obligated to send in the shareware fee. :)
 
   Many thanks to David Benn for writing ACE Basic Compiler which was used
   to create SCS.

Installation
============
   
   No real installation needed, just copy SCS to where you want it.
   You must be using WB2.x or higher.
   You must have the 'mathtrans' library in Libs:
   One minor bug... :)  Your 'default screen font' must be an 8 pt font.

Usage
=====

     You can run SCS from the CLI or via Workbench (although I haven't
     provided an icon).

     From the CLI the usage is as follows:

     SCS [number of players] [game type]

     where 'number of players' is a value of 1 to 4
           'game type' is either 's' for Straight or 'c' for CutThroat

     commandline options are optional and may be specified in any order

     If you do not specify either of the options you will prompted by a
     window asking you this information.

Choosing Number of Players
==========================

  If you didn't enter the number of players via the command line options
  then you will be prompted by a window to choose the number of players
  you want for the game.... simply click on the gadget indicating the
  proper number of players.

Entering Player Names
=====================

  This is where you enter the names of the people who will be playing.
  A series of input boxes will prompt you to enter the names.  Simply type
  in their name (maximum of 11 characters), then click on the 'OK' gadget.
  If you click on the 'CANCEL' gadget a blank name will be used!

  Due to a quirk in ACE Basic you MUST click on the 'OK' gadget to enter
  the name, just hitting return will not work.  I know it's annoying and
  I'm working on fixing it. :)

How to Play the Game
====================

  On screen you will see the player names displayed across the top.
  The name of the player up to shoot is both displayed in the middle AND
  highlighted. To enter darts just click on the gadget corresponding to
  what they hit on the dart board.  For example; 'D 15' if the hit a
  Double 15, or 'T 20' if they hit a Triple 20. Click on 'MISS' if their
  dart either missed the dart board all together or if it hit a number
  such as a '12' (which is not used in scoring Cricket).

  ************************************************************************
  * MAKE SURE you enter the proper darts because as of now there is no   *
  * confirmation of dart and there is no way to get back from a mistake! *
  ************************************************************************
  
  I didn't put in confirmation because I thought confirming each dart with
  an 'OK   Cancel' requester was annoying.... if enough people complain
  I'll put it in as an option.  Being able to take back mistakenly entered
  darts could turn into a major programming hassle but could probably be
  done.  Remember, registering gives your requests MUCH more clout!

  As you enter the dart the appropriate little /'s X's & O's will be drawn
  under that players column and the proper score of each player will be
  displayed at the bottom of each player column.

  Use the 'ABOUT' gadget to get info on ME! :)
  Use the 'QUIT' gadget to stop playing with SCS.
  Use 'ReStart' to start a new game of Cricket.
