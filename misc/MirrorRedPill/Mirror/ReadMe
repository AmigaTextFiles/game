Estrayk / Capsule wants so say something
----------------------------------------
I had not composed anything in the Amiga for a long time. I hope you like the music 
and the FX that I have made for this game.

The music of the presentation screen really is a theme that I started on Atari ST with 
two channels. Bass and percussion in one channel and the other for the melody, but as 
in the end, the game of Atari ST did not come out, I ended up in 3 channels plus one 
of echo for this Amiga game from my friend Zener.

The main game music has been specially composed for this game, thinking that it always 
had a catchy melody and that the player will not get tired while thinking about the 
action and the puzzles. three channels of c64 style. I hope you like it.

I am one of those few musicians that still remain of the old school alive but I would 
like to see fresh blood doing things for this fantastic platform. Maybe it's the last 
music of mine that you see for Amiga? I do not know.

Anyway meanwhile, let's keep the AMIGA alive!

---------------------
I hope you like the game, it is a bit short but also challenging, you can lose a lot
of lives before reaching the end. A pity RedPill only supports ten levels at the 
moment. 

The game itself did not take a long time to made, improving the graphics and sound 
was the big challenge here. Big thanks to Sandman and Estrayk for helping me, their
work really improves the game.

I wish this is just one of many new Amiga games to come!
