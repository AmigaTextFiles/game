WolfClone enemy records:
Four longwords in memory, in an AMOSPro array.

First longword:
0       Word    X Position
2       Word    Y Position

Second longword:
4       0-5     6 bits for Image number - 64 animation frames in all.
        6-9     4 bits for anim frame.
        10-11   2 bits for anim remainder
        12      Wide flag - set for explosions
        13-16   4 bits for enemy's hit count.
        17-20   4 bits for bullet count.   (15 will be treated as infinite)
        21      Explosion (static)
        22-24   3 bits anim cycle count per shot (probably now redundant)
        25-27   3 bits counter for above (redundant?)
        28      Set if enemy is visible to player.
        20-31   Damage done by enemy's shots.

Third longword:
8       Byte    X Coordinate of cell to move to
        Byte    Y Coordinate of cell to move to
        Byte    X Coordinate of cell to change on arrival
        Byte    Y Coordinate of cell to change on arrival

Fourth longword:
12      0-8     9 bits for new cell contents
        9       Explode if target cell is occupied
        10      Vanish if wall is hit
        11      1 for Enemy image bank, 0 for object image bank
        12      Vanish on arrival
        13      Treat X & Y target entries as vectors
        14      Kill player if visible, go to target cell if not (priority)
        15      Enemy is from serial linkup
        16-20   5 bits for enemy - bullet links
