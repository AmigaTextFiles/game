 == INTRODUCTION ==
 ==================

Hello everybody !

You surely want to know the purpose of this piece of code ?

Some months ago I bought the Action-Replay for my SONY-PlayStation and
wasn't satisfied with the preset codes and the few other found on the net. I
always wanted to search new codes like in former times with the
Action-Replay for my old A500. :-)

So I bought the PC-Comms Link package and tried my first steps with it. I
could easily add new codes by including them to the codelist. It was a fine
idea but this could only be done on a Wintel based machine. Anyway, why
should I work on a (P)rehistoric (C)omputer if I own the best homecomputer
ever created ?? ;-)

This is the first step to a new era of codelist-management. This version
allows you to easily manage your codelist with every text-editor available
(eg. CygnusED, GoldED, MEMACS) The convertion to the official
GameBuster/ActionReplay list is done by this program. One of the upcoming
versios will also convert the list to the .bin format for direct uploading
to your GB/AR.

@node "Requirements" "Requirements"
 ==================
 == REQUIREMENTS ==
 ==================

 You @{u}MUST@{uu} have some special hard- and software in order to
 start this program!

 - Amiga 500+ with AmigaOS v2.0+
 - A few bytes of memory

 Things you should have to obtain the full power of this masterpiece:

 - SONY PlayStation
 - Action-Replay / Game-Buster
 - PC-Comms Link package -> + PC w/ installed Software :(

 Things you really @{i}DON'T@{ui} need:

 - Homework
 - A PeeCee for G-Buster
      (YES, You DON'T need to install 1 MB of code and
       VisualBasic-Runtime)
 - Something else containing Intel/AMD or other processors ;)
   (except PowerPC-processors of course !)
@endnode

@node "Installation" "Installation"
 ==================
 == INSTALLATION ==
 ==================

Follow these rules:

 1. Copy GBuster to your desired directory.

 2. Create a codelist or change your codelist to this format.
    You can also use the included lists.

There are some example-lists included containing some easy and more
complex codes.
To use them you can link them together and use GBuster over the
linked file. Or you use GBuster with a single file.
 Note: GBuster will OVERWRITE the destination file without warning !!!

@node "Usage" "Usage"
 ===========
 == USAGE ==
 ===========

The usage of the converter is far easier than the previous version ;)

 GBUSTER <source> <destination>

Some examples:

 GBUSTER SYS:Codes/Japan-Codes.gb RAM:codes.txt

 GBUSTER SYS:AReplay/USA-Codes.lst RAM:uscodes.txt

   This will create a new file in your RAM-Disk containing
   the converted list ready to be used by CompPSX on the PC.

          ----==========================----

The format of the codelist is more complex ;)


COMMAND | MEANING
========+================================================================
   #    | Every line starting with '#' will be interpreted as a comment
        | and will not be converted !
--------+----------------------------------------------------------------
 Name:  | The name of the game to be trained/cheated
--------+----------------------------------------------------------------
 Code:  | A simple code (eg. 8009a854 03e7)
--------+----------------------------------------------------------------
 OCode: | OFF-Codes. Codes that are turned-off when selected
--------+----------------------------------------------------------------
 REM:   | Remember the old BASIC-days ? :) This is a Remark. That means
        | that the line will be shown in your AR/GB but it's shown like a
        | Off-Code.
--------+----------------------------------------------------------------
 .end   | Marks the end of the code. Used for separation.
========+================================================================

An example:

 #-------------------
 # ToShinDen-Example
 #-------------------

 # Name of the game

 Name:   TOSHINDEN

 # These codes will be turned on as soon as you
 # select the game on the AR/GB screen

 Code:   I: Health P1
         801b82d0 00fe
 Code:   I: Time
         801CA81C AB09

 # Some remarks on the AR/GB screen.
 # These are turned off codes that
 # SHOULDN'T be turned on !

 REM:
 REM:    use only one of the below

 # These codes are turned-off when the game will
 # be selected by you. You have the choice to turn
 # it on if you want to.

 OCode:  Remove Arms
        801BC250 000A
 OCode:  Remove Arms and Legs
        801BC250 0005
 OCode:  Have Head only
        801BC250 0001
 OCode:  Play as Gaia
        801BC24E 0008
 OCode:  Play as Sho
        801BC24E 0009
 .end

 #-------------------

The output looks like this:

 #----------------------------
 #   TOSHINDEN
 #----------------------------

 "TOSHINDEN"

 "I: HEALTH P1"
 801b82d0 00fe

 "I: TIME"
 801ca81c ab09

 " " .off
 "USE ONLY ONE OF THE BELOW" .off

 "REMOVE ARMS" .off
 801bc250 000a

 "REMOVE ARMS AND LEGS" .off
 801bc250 0005

 "HAVE HEAD ONLY" .off
 801bc250 0001

 "PLAY AS GAIA" .off
 801bc24e 0008

 "PLAY AS SHO" .off
 801bc24e 0009

 =============

v1.0   : First AmiNET release !

v1.1   : Enhanced the fileparser. You can use a destination filename ;)

         Enhanced the speed !
           It loads the whole file into memory instead of parsing it
           line by line from HD. You need more memory (some KB!) but
           you'll appreciate this speed increasement ;))

         Removed some bugs.

         Removed some grammmattikal missteacs in the manual ;))

         Second AmiNET release !

 == TO DO ==
 ===========

Things I want to implement for the next version ...:

 - Ability to convert the list to the '.bin' binary format.
     I finally got the specs to the binary format.
     I only need some time and motivation for this ;)

 - New commands like Count-Codes.
   This allows you to create codes like:
         801b82d0 00fe
         801b82d1 00fe
         801b82d2 00fe
         801b82d3 00fe
                |
                `- only changing digit !
   with one simple command (eg. "CCode: 801b82d? 00fe 1-3"

 - Convertion between AR/GB v1.99 and 2/3+ codes.
   Maybe also some XPloder-codes ?

Some nice 'hellos' are flying to :

 - DATEL
   For creating the hardware.
   Please don't underestimate the power of the Amiga
   and try to create an AMIGA-COMMS LINK :-)

 - BLAZE
   Do you need the software for the X-Ploder ?
   Pleeeeaaaaase give me some informations of the specs !!!
   The world doesn't consist of Micro$oft itself ! There are other
   systems on this planet, too. ;)

 - K-COMM
   Doumo arigatou gozaimashita !
   I really appreciate the help about the '.bin' format
   on your homepage. Nice and useful specs. Unfortunately the
   options-screen of Caetla v0.32 doesn't work on my AR-GB but
   the previous version did :(

 - STEFAN REDEL
   Your GameBuster-Paradise (http://www.gbparadise.de) is a MUST-HAVE
   for everybody ;))

 - SHRIMPS DESIGN
   Thanx alot for the incredible PSX-Raper !!!
   The largest AmigaGuide for Cheats and Tips ;-))

 - AMIGA INC.
   For the BEST homecomputer on this planet !!!
   I hope the AmigaNG (AmigaMCC) will hit the market in some months !!
   If it features everything what you wrote in the specs, then I'll
   be the first consumer for this incredible machine !!! ^_^
