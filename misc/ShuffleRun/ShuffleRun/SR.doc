If the cursor is a '<->' you can move the joystick left or right to
decrease or increase the number. If it's '<-' press the button to activate
the function.

Single game :
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
When you start a single game, the level is loaded and displayed. Player one
has a yellow smily, player two a pink one. Move the smile using your
joystick. You can interrupt the game by pressing the SPACE-key.

The screen is consists of many fields with different meanings :

    Floor........: no problem... simply walk on it.
    Grey wall....: if you run towards a grey wall, you can shift it, if
		   there is
		     a) no pink wall in the row (shift to the right or
			left) or column (shift up or down). You shuffle the
			whole row/column. Fields which move out of the
			screen, are inserted at the other side.
		     b) a striped wall somewhere in the direction you want
			to shift. You can shift the grey wall towards this
			striped wall as long as there is floor between
			them.
    Pink wall....: pink walls are fastened, you can't move them.
    Striped wall.: striped walls are fastened, too. See 'Grey walls' for
		   the difference.
    Door.........: doors can be open or close (really ?!).
    Key..........: with keys you can open doors. You can open one door
		   with each key.
    Hole.........: the player, who falls into a hole, loses.
    Grey bonus...: this bonus scores 50 points for both players.
    Yellow bonus.: scores 100 points for player one, 50 points for player
		   two.
    Pink bonus...: scores 100 points for player two, 50 points for player
		   one.

The game is completed, when there is no bonus left on the screen. The
player with more points wins.


Competition :
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
In competition mode the selected number of players play against each other.
Up to ten players can take part. Each player gets a predefined name, these
names are :

	 1 - Pink	 2 - Romulus
	 3 - Larry P.	 4 - Donald D.
	 5 - J.R.	 6 - Jan P.
	 7 - Cruise	 8 - Heinz
	 9 - Herbert	10 - Hugo

The first two players are selected randomly.


			Shuffle Run Competition

			     Next Level : 1

			 Larry P. vs. Romulus
			 0% = 0/0     0/0 = 0%

			  Continue <-
			  Cancel


The numbers below the names are :
    2/8 = 25%
    ^ ^    ^
    | |    |
    | |    +-- percentage of won games
    | +------- number of games played
    +--------- number of games won

Select continue to start this level. Here Larry P. is player one (yellow)
and Romulus player two (pink). See 'Single game' for the discription of the
game. The winner of the games stays and the player with the least points
replaces the loser.

Select cancel to end the competition. Now the high score is displayed. Only
the percentage of won games is important.


Edit level :
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
You can edit level 301-399. All other levels are locked.

Move the cursor (a white rectangle) with the joystick, press the button to
place the actual field under the cursor.

The two lowest rows of the screen are to controll the editor. The six
columns on the right are to select the field, you want to place under
the cursor. The actual field is displayed on the right. The three
columns in the middle are to fill the hole screen, be careful !!
You've got to hold the button for about two seconds to activate this
function. Select 'X' to mirror the left half to the right, 'Y' to
mirror the top half to the bottom. Select 'Q' to exit the editor and
leave the level unchanged, 'S' to exit and save the changes.

There should be at least one bonus on the screen, otherwise the level will
be finished immediately, when you play it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

				INSTALL FONTS
				¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

SR needs the font AM.18 to run. Fonts are usally stored in the FONTS:
directory of your WorkBench. The small script InstallFonts will copy the
font to this directory. Be sure that there is enough space left on you
WorkBench, about 18 blocks. Use the CLI-command Info to check this.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

				INSTALL DISK
				¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

You can install SR to a bootable disk, so that there's no need to run your
WorkBench. You need a blank disk, which will be formated by the script. You
also need a second disk drive (DF1:) to run the script. All files are
copied to the disk, plus some files from your WorkBench.
