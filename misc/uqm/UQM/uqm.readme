Author:       See AUTHORS file
Type:         game/misc

This is a port of the latest 0.7.0 version. Thanks to Juha Niemimäki for the
original ur-quan masters port (I'm using a modified version of his uqm 0.4.0
build system for this port).

Netplay (new 0.6.x feature) has not been compiled into this version due to
various issues with the getting the network code to compile.

Installation:

1. Unpack to harddrive

2. Download .uqm content files from here:

http://sc2.sourceforge.net/downloads.php

Install uqm-0.7.0-content.uqm into content/packages and the other two files in
content/addons (NOTE: install the .uqm files as is, DO NOT UNPACK THEM!).

3. Double-click the icon to run the game

AmigaOS port changes:

0.7.0r3 (22.10.2020)
- Fixed transposed memset parameters in AIFF decoder.
- Changed back to using static libraries instead of shared objects.
- Reenabled openal support.
- Recompiled with gcc 8.4.0 and updated support libraries (SDL, mikmod,
  openal, etc.).

0.7.0r2 (13.3.2013)
- Disabled openal support because it was causing crashes here.
- Now built using shared objects.

--- From the original readme file:

You're looking at the readme for 'The Ur-Quan Masters', a volunteer
project that intends to bring the classic game 'Star Control II' to
modern systems.

The program code that comprises 'The Ur-Quan Masters' was derived from code
written by Toys for Bob, Inc. for the 3DO version of 'Star Control II', with
their permission and encouragement.

If you've got this file from the source tree, you can find everything
you need to get started in INSTALL (INSTALL.mingw for Mingw) and
doc/users/unixinstall.

The home page of the project is located at http://sc2.sourceforge.net/
You can find links to downloads, our bug database, and our forum there.

Have fun!
