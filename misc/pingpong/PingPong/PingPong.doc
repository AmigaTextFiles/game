@NODE allgemeines "About"

Ping Pong is an old classic among the computergames. Who doesn't know the
old consoles with their paddels and the games Ping Pong, Squash and Tennis.
I've searched for this games but didn't find any good version, so I tried
to do one myself. Unfortunately the first version was full of really nasty
bugs. I hope they're gone with this version.

Ok, now some features:

    The sprites can be seen with Kickstart 3.0
    It's a bit more font sensitive.
    I've included a 2 player mode
    The speed is slightly variable now.
    Pingpong won't work with Kickstart 1.3 and less. ;c)
    You can move the window.
    You can win against the Computer.
    It will work in Interlaced Mode.
    I have included some samples.
    etc ...

Todo:

    I'd like to make it work on networks.
    Perhaps I'm going to include a Monica Seles Sample soon ;c)
    etc ...

@NODE physik "Physics"
I guess every player with a bit of physical education will notice that the
movement of the ball doesn't fit with phyical reality. This has a simple
reason. In the very beginning of this version the game was written very
tight to real physics. But I've recognized that this makes the game very
boring because it was too easy.

you like this game.

this program as long as they don't charge more then 5 US-$ or 6 DM for a

Mailboxes, etc:

I'm going to spread this game via Aminet. But other Mailboxen may use it
too.

Magazines:

You may put it on your coverdisks. But it would be kind if you'd send me a

@NODE steuerung "Steering"

    Player 1 uses the left Shift and Alt key. Player 2 uses the right
    Shift and Alt key. (Only in 2 Player mode)

Gadgets:

    About:      Opens the About Window

    Setup:      Opens the Setup Window

    Pause:      :c)

    Quit:       Quit...

Tips & tricks:

- Set the speed of the ball and the rackets to the same value, this will
  give you best results (IMHO)

- The difficulty gadget sets the strength of your oponent.
