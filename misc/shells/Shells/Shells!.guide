@node "Intro" "How a story begun"

  Once upon the time...

 Well, once I visited the Computer Room of our student hostels to find ANY
interesting in PeeCees.  Nothing, of course...  :) Except, that everybody
played with three games: C&C (really great game, that's true),
                         a silly game with spiders
                         and an even sillier gambling game!

 "@{i}Wow!@{ui}"- I said -"@{i}I have to write one of those games!@{ui}"- so I looked those
three carefully. C&C is more over my genie, that should be a later plan! :)
The another "spiderized" game is still nice, but I had no time to know out
that one. (May be later!)
 And what about that gambling game? Ray traced animation, and nothing else.
"@{i}That's it!!@{ui}"- I shouted.
 "@{i}Traced!  Boring!  Easy-2-write!  Big-&-nothing-special!  Exact PeeCee
game!!!!@{ui}" ;)

 Then I discovered E! One of the greatest languages on Amiga. I learned it
completely under a week, an other week and it is ready!

 @{i}@{fg shine}Shells!@{ui}@{fg text} aproaches to the World! (On @{b}Aminet@{ub}...)

 About the animation:

 It consists of 65 frames, each frame needed @{i}50 min@{ui} to trace on my stock
A1200. :-P
 And after the convertation! I used @{b}Image Studio v1.1.0@{ub}, it @{i}does not have
Arexx interface@{ui}, I had to convert all frame by @{i}myself@{ui}... :-P again!

 Sorry about no sounds at all. I did not want to run out of 2 Megs.

@endnode

@node "Requirements" "Well, you will need at least a CyberStorm! :)"

 @{i}So, what do you really need?@{ui}

 Nothing special, but a stock@{i} @{fg shine}A1200 with HDD@{ui}@{fg text}. Or if you prefer:
@{fg shine}AGA chpiset@{fg text}, @{fg shine}KickStart 3.0@{fg text} and @{fg shine}2 Megs of any memory@{fg text}, but @{i}@{fg shine}no 68020 needed@{ui}@{fg text},
because the player not optimized on this way. It should run on every machine
with this features.

 First I thoght, I write routines to handle floppy disks, but finally I see
no reason, why anybody wanted to run this from floppy. It is not as good as
it worth to waste two disks.

 Buy HDD!

 I almost forgot: You may need a @{i}@{fg shine}PAL@{ui}@{fg text} machine. (I can't believe, anybody from
the USA is interested in this! :) )

@endnode

@node "Installation" "Why this shit does not want to work???"

 All you have to do to install is:

         @{fg shine}copy all files to the same directory!@{fg text}

 Easy, isn't it?

 Could be a problem, that this program needs at least @{fg shine}1.6 Megs of any memory@{fg text}.
Keep this in mind!

@endnode

@node "Using" "Easy-to-use is always suspicious!"

 It is really easy. When you start the program, -I hope I should not tell
you, how to start it, we are not PeeCee users, - it opens a window with three
gadgets on it. 
 @{fg shine}Level@{fg text} is the level of hardness, (three levels: @{i}Novice@{ui}, @{i}Advanced@{ui} and @{i}Expert@{ui}),
 @{fg shine}Start@{fg text} gadget starts the game,
 @{fg shine}Quit@{fg text} gadget quits from the program.

 You can select from menu the showing of top list, and about box.

 Now, if you start the game, then @{i}three traced shells@{ui} appear on the screen.
One of them will lift up, and show you a @{i}red ball@{ui} under. Then the program
begins to @{i}shuffle@{ui} those tree shells, and after "some" changing, you have
to guess, which shell @{i}contains@{ui} the ball.
 It is an easy game, everybody knows it. If you fail, then the game is over.
If you get enough score, you can type your name into a reqester, and you can
check on the list of @{i}Big Shellers@{ui}. (Separated for each level of course!)

 Ok. @{i}@{fg shine}Now stop dogging around, lets play!@{fg text}@{ui}

@node "Upcoming" "The future is Bright!"

 What do I plan for the future?

 @{fg shine}*@{fg text} At first Bi0Hazard will release a REALLY great demo called:

                                 @{i}@{fg shine} KNOCKOUT!@{ui}@{fg text}
   Try to get soon!

 @{fg shine}*@{fg text} I was very disappointed, when I checked out @{i}A4@{ui}, a Commodore Plus/4
   emulator, this is the second on my todo-list: a perfect emulation of 
   Plus/4. (I was one of the final coders on Plus/4, and I need it so.)

 @{fg shine}*@{fg text} Keep on editing my hungarian diskmag, called @{fg shine}F0NT!@{fg text}
   I need help of course, if you are encouraged enough, try to 
   @{"contact me" link "Author" 0}. Internet is the preferred way...
   You may find the first issue on Aminet: docs/mags/F0NT01.lha

 @{fg shine}*@{fg text} Some silly action game is coming up soon, when I and a gfx master
   have some free time.

 @{i}That's all, Folks!@{ui}

@node "Dist" "So you want to copy..."

 If you want to copy, then you may, but no longer, if you need only a part of
it. Keep it together please!

 Anyway this program is absolutely @{fg shine}FREEWARE@{fg text}, but if you
like it, please send me an e-mail or a postcard to warm my soul, and tell, it
was not competely unnecessary to develop...

                               Thanks to you!

 Don't forget: @{fg shine}I take no responsibility of ANY harm, caused use or misuse of
this program!@{fg text} (If your friend won all your money e.g. :) )

 @{fg shine}This program has multitasking feaure, but not tested for illegal
memory access, be warned!@{fg text} @endnode

 @{fg shine}*@{fg text}@{i}Edd Dumbill@{ui} for Heddley v1.1, this guide was made with this nice program.
