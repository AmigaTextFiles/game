InitPool v1.00 - Wargames Initiative Manager
============================================

InitPool was written to simplify handling initiative for a
simple WWII game cooked up by me and some friends.  But may also
be usefull for other games systems.

A database of units is created in a text file called InitPool.txt
this contains entries for all units.  When InitPool is run hitting
the Next button will select a unit randomly and display it's ID.
Once it has moved it is tagged as such and will not be reselected
until all other units have moved.  This allows a simple method of
moving all units on both sides in a random intermixed order.

There is also an option (Status button) which allows a list of the
units to be displayed and the current state to be changed.  This
includes marking a unit as dead in which case it will never be
reselected.  This allows destroyed units to be removed from the
initiative pool.

As for our WWII rules there may well be some web pages for
MAD (Micro Armour Devastation) setup before to long with a
full copy of the rules on them.

Any coments can be e-mailed to jg@actuality.demon.co.uk

InitPool was written in "e" and uses the text EasyPLUGIN by
Ali Graham.  It requires the CGTrimuvirate font which is
supplied with all versions of AmigaOS since 2.04 (i think).
