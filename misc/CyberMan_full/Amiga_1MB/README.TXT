Note:
This is the trackloaded version you have to use if your Amiga has only 1MB
of RAM. If you've more RAM, you better use the executable version, that can
be installed on hard disk (but requires at least 2MB of RAM).

Because of non-elastic Aminet rules, DMS is completely banned. Even if you
provide an executable of a game, and the DMS version for those Amigas (1MB)
that can't run that executable. No, the DMS is banned anyway.. i.e. Urban
Mueller thinks that if you got an Amiga500 1MB then you can f*ck off, (Aminet
rules rule :^) ), period (he didn't even reply to my email where I stated
that I was also providing an executable anyway, for those Amigas with enough
RAM.. so why ban the DMS for who CANNOT run the executable version? zzZz).
I'm not providing a DMS file, but you can get the same result using the ADF
file in the UAE directory, and the utility (adf2disk) you find in the dir
where you found this same readme file.

Put an OFS formatted disk in DF0, then open a shell and type:

adf2disk /UAE/CyberMan.ADF

And in your DF0 drive you'll get the trackloaded version of CyberMan, for
all Amigas with only 1MB of RAM. Unless it gets banned again and again for
some silly reason (had to re-upload 4 archives 13 times.. I was starting
to suspect Microsoft has bought and is organizing Aminet).
