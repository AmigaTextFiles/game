The Game
--------

  Shoot pontoon is simply a more money orientated version of everyone's
fave card game pontoon, blackjack or 21.  You start off with 1 card each
and you must bet on this card, the banker will now deal you another card.
From here you can now stick (if you have >16), twist (costs you nothing 
but the banker will see your card), or buy (Add to the pot to buy another
card but you cannot go above your first bet).  If you have 14 with 2 cards
you can also burn (get 2 new cards).  If you win against the banker you will take your bets back from the pot as well as the same amount from the 
banker.  If the banker has no money left you win, if you have no money left
the banker has won.


Playing the game
----------------

  Each button down the left hand side does what is explained above.  The first money box holds how much money you have. The second holds how much money you wish to buy a card for, This is surrounded by arrows and a scroll bar.  The third money box holds how much in total you have bet and this is called the pot. The fourth box holds how much the banker has.  To buy a card use the small up and down arrows to select how much you wish to buy
a card for, or use the scroll bar underneath the box.  Now press buy and you will be given a card.  Once a hand has ended press deal to play the next hand or at any time press quit to end the program.
