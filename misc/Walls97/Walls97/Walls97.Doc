                        |  Welcome to Walls '97 ! |
                        |_________________________|


This program is giftware and we spent a lot of time to finish it, so if you
like it please send us a small gift which you think will deal as payment.

Walls features :            - 11 extras
                            - 32/64 colour graphics + some AGA-pictures
                            - 7 different music tracks + some jingles
                            - 50 different levels
                            - passwords for each level

Walls is based on the old Breakout-games. The purpose in each level is to
destroy all bricks with a small ball which can be controlled with a pad.




******************************************************************************
****                           Loading the Game                           ****
******************************************************************************

After unpacking the archive simply double-click the Walls'97-icon.
The game should then load automatically.
If something seems to go wrong, check wether the powerpacker.library is present
in the libs folder. If you get some message like "Out of Memory" this may be a
hint that you don't have enough free chip mem (the game will need something
between 600k and 700k).
Walls doesn't save any files to different places, so deleting the Walls-folder
will discard the game completely.




******************************************************************************
****                               Titlepage                              ****
******************************************************************************

The Titlepage offers you the following possibilities :
                            - Start
                            - Credits
                            - Highscoretable
                            - Options
                            - Exit to Dos

Each item can be selected with the mouse-pointer. (A600:Sometimes you can't
see the mouse-pointer but it is there. Don't ask me why ???????)

1. Start 

Starts the game.

2. Credits

Shows you the credits page. (Have a look at it !)

3. Highscoretable

Shows you the highscoretable and explains the extras.

4. Options

Takes you to the options menu.

5. Exit to Dos

******************************************************************************
****                                Options                               ****
******************************************************************************

The options menu pops up after clicking "options" at the titlepage and let's
you select one of these:

1. Right mousebutton

By clicking this item you can choose, wether the right mousebutton shall
pause the game or push the table when playing.

2. Enter Password

Gives you the ability to enter a password. The password for the following
level will be given to you at the end of each level.
(There's also a cheat password !!!)

3. Level-Editor

If you select this one, you will be warped to the level-editor, which gives
you the possibility to create your own levels. A help-screen will pop up if
you press the "h"-key. (Sorry, no mouse-control yet...)

4. Musicmenu

The musicmenu will let you choose every track and jingle for immediate
listening (except the extro-track).

5. Back to main menu

Takes you back to the main menu.

****                               Playing Walls                           ****
*******************************************************************************

Walls can be played with a mouse in port 1. The pad can be moved to the left
and to the right by moving the mouse in the appropriate direction.
By clicking the left mouse button the ball will enter the game.
Clicking the right mouse button will perform the action you have selected in
the options menu.

You have to destroy all bricks to enter the next level. There are two different
types of bricks :  - indestroyable bricks (grey)
                   - destroyable bricks (every other colour)

Sometimes an extra will be released from a cracked stone. Try to catch it
with your pad, but beware! Not every extra is a good one... ;-)

Once you completed the level you will be awarded for this level with a score,
a password for the next level and if you were good enough with an extra ball.
