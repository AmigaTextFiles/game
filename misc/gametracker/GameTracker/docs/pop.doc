POP - A little popup message program using ClassAct
---------------------------------------------------

Pop is a cli command that displays a little message
box with message and image for a user specified time
period.

It can be used to display a message while a large
program loads.

Usage:

pop <image filename> <message> <delay value>

image filename selects the filename of the pic to view,
it should be a fairly small image and one that can
be loaded by datatypes.

message is a string message, place it in quotes if it
has any spaces in it, note: it can only be a single
line message and C style '\n' won't work.

delay value, 20 is a fair amount, it uses Intuiticks
so the speed of your CPU shouldn't affect it.
Just experiment with the values.

ALL of these parameters are required, if you make
a mistake and forget any of these you can CTRL C
the program or use 'break'.


An Example of Usage.

pop c:pic.iff "Loading Blah...." 20
-----------------------------------------------------

This program is just a quick exercise and has not
been tested extensively. There could be bugs and
sideaffects, if there are then don't use it.
Also please don't ask me to do a non-ClassAct or MUI
version.
