@{u}IMPORTANT NOTES@{uu}

» This archive contains Amiga ALS/ALS+/WB-ALS/InstallerALS, Acorn ALS/ALS+, FlexALS, MSX-ALS, Casio ALS and Databank ALS.  It does NOT contain the Spectrum, RM380Z, Amstrad or ALS Professional versions.
It DOES contain the necessary Amiga support files - ie. Spectrum.font, hisoftbasic.library and als.library

Apologies to pre-AmigaGuide 39 users - this text probably won't wordwrap for you... (oops)

1. @{b}MAKE SURE THAT @{I}SPECTRUM.FONT@{UI} (AND @{I}SPECTRUM/8@{UI}) IS IN THE CURRENT FONTS: DIRECTORY WHEN STARTING ALS.@{ub}
IF IT IS NOT, THE GAME WILL NOT RUN AND A BUG IN AMOS (ON THE A1200, ANYWAY), CAUSES A SCREEN TO BE LEFT OPEN AND SERIOUSLY SLOWS DOWN THE COMPUTER.
» This can be taken care of with the ALS-Install script - Double-click on the icon, make sure "Expert" is highlighted, then (after a few screens) click off ALS, ALS+ and ALS.guide.

2. @{B}MAKE SURE THAT HISOFTBASIC.LIBARY IS IN LIBS: WHEN STARTING WB-ALS.@{UB}  Fix as above.

3. Ctrl-C quits, and ALS can be pushed to the back (so you can get to any other programs running) with Left-Amiga-A. (WB-ALS can be pushed to the back using the normal method).

4. INSTALLATION:
  a) @{i}The easy way@{ui}
     Use the supplied Installer script - it will ask which versions you want to install, and where to put them.
     You need Installer, obviously, for this to work. I recommend getting the latest version from Aminet, as several recent scripts require it.
     
  b) @{i}The hard way@{ui}
     Just dump everything in one big directory.  Oh, except for Acorn !ALS, which needs to be on a PC formatted floppy, and the emulator versions (Flex etc), which ought to be in the same drawer as the emulators they're for.  The fonts need to be in fonts:, and the libraries need to be in libs:

5. The disclaimer bit:
THESE GAMES ARE PROVIDED "AS-IS".  AFTER EXTENSIVE TESTING WE HAVE DECIDED THAT THEY ARE FIT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION AND WILL NOT CAUSE SKIN CANCER.  ALL USE IS, HOWEVER, AT YOUR OWN RISK - EG. IF YOUR COMPUTER BLOWS UP, YOUR CALCULATOR CAN'T DO 2+2 (the answer is 5, by the way) YOUR HARD DRIVE GETS REFORMATTED, OR YOU LOSE AN ESSAY YOU'VE BEEN WRITING FOR THE LAST FEW HOURS, WE WILL ACCEPT NO RESPONSIBILTY.
If the messages at the end of the game offend you in any way (they shouldn't, unless you don't like being called a 'stupid little git'), it is also not our fault - this is a CONVERSION, remember? - we did not write the texts.  We do not have any connection with edited prefs files (well, not usually).

6. ALS versions included in this archive MUST be accompanied with this AmigaGuide file.  This AmigaGuide file must not be altered and should not be distributed without the executables.  The only exception to this is the Casio calculator version may be removed and distributed separately IF you include some acknowledgement that this is Unsatisfactory Software's code.  Casio are, of course, welcome to include this as an example listing in their calculator manuals!

7. @{"Click here for some last-minute WB-ALS notes..." link WB-ALS.readme}

8. The emulator versions obviously require a suitable emulator (see the individual notes for details), but if you have the required programs/knowledge then you should be able to transfer the files over to 'the real thing'.  The MSX version, in particular, should be reasonably easy to transfer.

9. @{u}Bugs@{uu}
The original ALS had several (two, no, three) bugs in it:
@{i}Bug 10@{ui}   - Sometimes a message would not appear at the end of the game.
@{i}Bug 'M'@{ui}  - Caps lock had to be OFF when mowing
@{i}Spelling@{ui} - Not sure about this, but I think 'relevant' was spelt wrong! (OK, not exactly important...)

These are gone from @{b}some@{ub} conversions, others have one, two or maybe all of them still intact.  Unfortunately, I can't remember versions...

10. A big thank you to Amiga Format for including loads of emulators on the Cover CD every month - if it hadn't been for you, several versions of ALS wouldn't exist. (I bet you're wishing you hadn't started that emulation feature now, aren't you?)

11. To anyone who wants to include Unsatisfactory's versions of ALS on magazine coverdisks, CDs etc:
Feel free! I would appreciate being notified, though - but this is not a requirement.

12. @{B}ALL CD compilers, please note:@{ub}
ALS+ needs to write to it's drawer, UNLESS the file 'Owner' is found.
If you want/need it to run direct from CD, please LOAD ALS+ FIRST, and make sure that there is some kind of licence information - set it to the name of the CD, or something.

13. Do NOT include ALS in commercial compilations - ALS is freeware, and considering that I am not making any money out of it, I don't see why other people should.
@{i}THE AMINET CDs ARE THE ONLY EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE@{ui}

@node Intro "Introduction to ALS - What is it? Who did it? and Why?"
@{u}Advanced Lawnmower Simulator - An Introduction@{uu}

Advanced Lawnmower Simulator (or ALS) was quite simply the best game to appear on the Spectrum.  It was written by (at the time) well-known @{i}Your Sinclair@{ui} writer Duncan MacDonald.  In April 1990, it was reviewed in YS and was promptly awarded a YS 'Megagame'.  The following month, it was 'featured' on the Covertape.  Yes, you've guessed it - the whole thing was an April Fool's joke.

A number of months later, YS started a 'Crap Games Corner' for reader's games.  Not surprisingly, these included ALS rip-offs "Advanced Lawnmower Simulator: The Trilogy" and "Football Janitor".  They were good (actually, they were ALS with the colour and graphics commands changed a bit), but they weren't ALS.  However, it shows the popularity of the game in question.
Also, there was a cheat someone discovered for ALS: Press 'Break', and type:
130 REM 1439
RUN
This will speed the game up. (quite considerably, in fact)

So, 6 years later, me and Phillip rediscovered the delights of Your Sinclair, and set about producing an Acorn version of the game.  This was an instant hit, with comments ranging from "is that it? don't you get any rabbits to run over?" to "hey, can I have a copy?"

@node AmigaGuideALS "ALS for AmigaGuide - Instructions"
@{i}By Chris Young 1997@{ui}

Come on, this is getting ridiculous.  The original ALS - fine.  Enhanced ALS - yeah, just a better version of the original.  ALS Professional - would be good if it ever got completed.  WB-ALS - A logical step to make ALS multitask.  Emulator Versions - A demonstration of what can be achieved on different platforms.  ALS.library - lets other people implement ALS into their programs.  But a version for INSTALLER????  ALS running on a program designed to INSTALL SOFTWARE? It isn't even very good (ALS, not Installer).  Then there's this... ALS for AmigaGuide.  AMIGAGUIDE - A Hypertext document displayer, with absolutely no graphics facilities, and links ALWAYS go to the same place - so no random messages.  It can't be done, and people are getting fed up with so many different similar versions of ALS anyway, so why bother?  I don't know.  I just created it to make yet another obscure Amiga version of ALS.

Requires Spectrum.font!

This is a version of ALS for AmigaGuide.  Just click on 'START' below...

@node AGALS3 "HA HA TRICKED YOU"
Before you start to even enjoy this, perhaps I should tell you, that it was a joke!  Yes, AmigaGuideALS does not exist.  Although, in theory, it would be possible - ARexx scripts (if I knew the AmigaGuide ARexx commands, assuming it has some, of course) to decide on the messages, dying, and even the sound effects (which has given me an idea for InstallerALS...)

@node ALS "Advanced Lawnmower Simulator"
@{u}Advanced Lawnmower Simulator@{uu} @{b}YS MEGAGAME!@{ub} (converted Speccy game)

Casio Calculator/Databank and Acorn Versions: Chris Young and Phillip Lake
BBC Model B Version: Ish

A mobile phone version is also "in the pipeline" (no, really)
Commodore 64, ZX81, Dragon 32 "IT Retro" computer versions MAY be done (except the C64 has no disk drive leads, so I can't save it, and the ZX81 is nowhere to be found).
Oric, Atari ST, (Apple IIe), (VIC 20), (Mac), (C16/Plus 4) and QL versions MAY be done, if I "raid" a PD library and buy loads of emulators.  Or log on to Aminet, of course.  Which will be at the same time as uploading this.
UNIX version, anyone?
Oh, and @{"ALS Professional" link ALSPro} may be completed for Acorn and Amiga eventually.  Maybe even PC!@{ui}

This is a powerful and accurate lawn mowing simulation.  You have a choice of six (perfectly simulated) mowers, and the perilous task of mowing the lawn.

Warning - a stray blade of grass may get entangled in the mower.

GOOD LUCK!

@{u}Controls@{uu} (Individual versions may vary)

Controls: Select mower with numeric keys 1-6
          M - pressing engages/releasing disengages motor

To quit... @{b}Acorn@{ub}: Esc
           @{b}Amiga@{ub}: Ctrl-C, Close Gadget or Abort Install
           @{b}Casio@{ub}: AC (or MENU if you want to try out the multitasking!)
        @{b}Databank@{ub}: Come out of "secret" mode or turn it off
         @{b}Amstrad@{ub}: Hit Escape.  REALLY hard, in case the button doesn't work.
         @{b}RM 380Z@{ub}: Um, turn it off?  There appears to be no "break" command.
         (you could try picking the keyboard up and moving it around)
         Ctrl-C reboots, if that's any help (but not while ALS is running, 
         unfortunately - so it probably won't help).
            @{b}Flex@{ub}: Ctrl-C or Cursor-Right, which sends a Ctrl-C for some
         reason...
             @{b}MSX@{ub}: You can't

@{B}MUSIC SUGGESTION@{UB} - We recommend listening to:
@{i}David "Whistlin' Rick" Wilson - Hold My Hand Very Tightly (Very Tightly)@{ui}
whilst playing this game.

Especially when playing the Acorn version, since there is no sound.  We apologise for this and have made the sun bright yellow as compensation.

@{u}Version Notes@{uu}

@{"Enhanced Advanced Lawnmower Simulator" link ALS+} for Acorn and Amiga (PC as well?) has a few more extra features.
@{"WB-ALS" link WBALS} is a version of ALS that runs in a window.
@{"InstallerALS" link InstALS} for Commodore/Escom Amiga Application Installer
@{"ALS.library" link ALSlib} is a standard Amiga shared library
@{"ALSGuide" link AmigaGuideALS} for AmigaGuide????! (and you thought the Installer version was bad enough...)

The @{"RM 380Z" link RM380Z} version is a bit different (but not much).
The @{"Flex" link FlexALS} version is even worse...

@node ALSlib-screenprefs "ENV:ALS/Screen"
*** Only works with als.library 6.0 ***

Using the command:

SetEnv ENV:ALS/Screen 1

You can set als.library to use a custom screen as default.

Note that this can be overidden (programmer-wise) by using Alsopenscreen() or Alssetprefs(10,xxxx)
@endnode

@node ALSlib-extralibprefs "libextra.prefs"
@{fg shine}ENVARC:ALS/libextra.prefs@{fg text}

This is a file you can create in a text editor;

<NAME> - Your (Licenced To) name goes here
<GREEN> - The colour assignment for green (see below)

This is normally created when you install als.library.

<GREEN> is the position in your usual WB palette of the colour green.  The included ARexx program "Colpal" will list the available numbers and show you the colours.  Don't edit them, that defeats the object.  (It requires ARexx, reqtools.library and rexxreqtools.library)
@endnode

@node ALSlib-libALS "LibraryALS - ALS using ALS.library"
This is a complete version of ALS, using the Als() routine in als.library

Now you can specify a prefs file to use if you start it from the command line. (als.library 4.1 and newer only)

TEMPLATE: LibraryALS [config file|SCREEN]

If no config file is specified, the default ENV:ALS/Library.prefs will be used instead.

@{b}Warning@{ub}: Neither als.library nor LibraryALS check whether files exist or are valid config files.  Strange things may/will happen if you specify non-config or non-existant files.

If SCREEN is specified (als.library 6 required), then LibraryALS will open a screen and run ALS on that instead.
Please Note: If SCREEN is specified, then you cannot also specify a seperate config file

*** als.library 6.0 ***

Instead of using 'SCREEN', you can create an environment variable;

SetEnv ENV:ALS/Screen 1

This has exactly the same effect as typing SCREEN on the command line. (except you @{i}can@{ui} now specify a config file to use)

Note that setting the environmental variable "SCREEN" will affect ALL usage of als.library, not just LibraryALS.

*** als.library 6.1/ALSPrefs 1.4 ***

There is a toggle switch in ALSPrefs that performs the above function.
@endnode

@node ALSlib-ALSPrefs "als.library preferences"
@{u}ALSPrefs@{uu}

This is a preferences editor for als.library.  I've tried to keep it as close as possible to the ones included with OS 2.04 and above.

@{b}WARNING: This is @{u}VERY@{uu} unstable.  Make sure you have nothing in memory you want to keep before running this program!@{ub}

The gadgets:

@{i}Screen Font Size@{ui}  * Only on ALSPrefs pre-1.4 *
@{b}You can ignore this if using als.library 5.2 or newer@{ub}

Type in your current/usual screen font size (it will be 8 if you haven't changed it, otherwise you should load up and check your font preferences)

@{i}Use Screen@{ui}  * Only on ALSPrefs 1.4 or newer *
@{b}Only use ALSPrefs 1.4 with als.library 6.1 or higher!@{ub}

Click on the button to decide whether you want als.library to default to using its own screen (note: colours aren't quite right at the moment).
This can be overridden by programmers.

@{i}Lawnmower Names@{ui}

These contain the names of the six lawnmowers you get to choose from at the start of the game. (and the secret hidden mower)

@{i}Working?@{ui}

The slider shows the status of each mower - slide it to the left if that mower is broken, and to the right if it is working well.

@{i}Hidden Mower@{ui}

This toggles between Off (No hidden mower) No (Not working) Yes (Working)

@{i}End Of Game Messages@{ui}

These are the messages you get to see if you are successful in your task of mowing the lawn.
(limited to 150 chars)

als.library 6.12 - I suggest if you have just upgraded to this version, then you load ALSPrefs and re-save your preferences.

@{i}Background@{ui}

This slider can be set to change the background graphics.  The settings are Original (Default) Night (Night) Random (als.library decides)

@{i}Scrolly@{ui}

This sets the speed of the scrolly messages, from 0 (ridiculously fast) through 4 (default) to 9 (slow)

@{i}Window@{ui}

These gadgets set the window position and dimensions.  The define button does not currently work.

@{i}User/Owner@{ui} (Not Yet Available - See @{"libextra.prefs" link ALSlib-extralib)

Your Name

@{i}Green@{ui} (Not Yet Available - See @{"libextra.prefs" link ALSlib-extralib})

Sets the colour palette number corresponding to green.
If anyone knows how to do nearest-colour matching, then I'll do it that way and put it in the library.

@{i}Save, Use, Cancel@{ui}

These perform the normal functions - namely, save the prefs to ENVARC: and ENV:, save to ENV: only and do not save at all.

The Menus: (buggy items are now ghosted, so shouldn't cause problems - I hope!)

@node ALSlib-new "ALS.library features"
It's a library
Each section of the game is in a separate routine, so can be easily (?) customised
The whole original game can be implemented into any program with one command (excluding opening the library and other stuff, of course)
...and, obviously, can be upgraded by the user when a new library version comes along (to include better graphics, configurable mowers etc.).  Without another ounce of programming.
Very small size
It's free! (let's face it - who would pay?)
seperate prefs program, to change messages, mowers etc.
can (optionally) use different prefs settings, depending on the program calling als.library, of course.

       Als() and use a different settings file.

Alsopenwin()

PARAMETERS: None

RETURNS: None

DESCRIPTION: Opens the ALS window

NOTES: You should not need to call this routine, as it is used automatically
       when a window is required.
       If you call a routine, and no window opens - tell me, and use
       Alsopenwin() before the problem routine.
       This also reads the prefs file ENV:ALS/Library.prefs, which is used
       by Als() - this bit may be moved into a separate routine or just
       put directly into the Als() routine, since it is only needed for this
       currently.

*3.0*   Prefs file has changed
        Use Alsreadprefs() if you want to use the default prefs file - this
        will ensure that if the default filename changes or the file moves,
        the file will still be read.
*4.1*   Using Als(1) stops Als() automatically reading default prefs, so
        you can use this function safe in the knowledge that you will get
        the correct prefs
*4.0*   DO NOT USE 'b' - this is currently unimplemented, but in the future
        will specify that the prefs file is in Phillip's PC ALS format.
        Possibly, this will be tested automatically and then 'b' will be
        used for something else, and maybe have bad effects if you did not
        pay heed to this warning...
*4.0*   What about creating a custom prefs file within your program, and
        temporarily saving it somewhere (suggest ENV:ALS/), then reading it
        with Alsreadprefsfrom() before calling Als(1).  You could then have
        a custom version of ALS linked into your program.
        (prefs format currently undocumented, due to my laziness, so if you
        save your prefs, and examine the ASCII file in a text editor you
        could quite easily re-create it)

DESCRIPTION: Opens a screen for ALS
             If prefs have been read/set, will check that the window size
             will fit within the screen dimensions

NOTES:
*V6.0*  Can be used as default by setting variable ENV:ALS/Screen

*V6.1*  Can be used as default by setting Use Screen? to Yes in ALSPrefs

        Default can be overridden with:
        	Alssetprefs(10,xxxx)  or
        	Alsopenscreen(xxxx)

        This screen will always be closed with Alsclosewin()
        	You do NOT need to call that routine to close it, simply closing
        	the ALS window will do that...
        	
        I suggest calling Alsreadprefs or Alssetprefs before this routine
        if you want the window dimensions to be automatically adjusted.
        
        Remeber you can also force ALS to open on your screen by calling
        Alssetprefs()
*V6.1*  This works even if Alsreadprefs is called after setting als.library
        up to use your application's screen
Note that auto-font size detection does NOT work on screens other than WB,
*6.12*  the size defaults to 8 (can be changed with alssetprefs)

Yes, ALS for Installer.  Unfortunately, it only works properly when using topaz/8 as the screen font - is it possible to change fonts from within Installer?

This requires Installer (tested only on V43.3), and my random program @{"ALSrnd" link instALSrnd}.

@node MSX "The MSX (emulator) version"
This requires an MSX emulator (maybe MSX2), which is capable of handling MSX single-sided 'Virtual Disks' - fMSX 1.4 is the one I used to write this, and will now explain how to run ALS on it...
Load fMSX as usual, and select System... from the Settings pull-down menu.
The 'Drives' cycle gadget should be set to at least 1
Click on 'Load' to the right of the Drive A box, and select MSX-ALS.DSK from the requestor that appears.
Set ROM Type to MSX2 (I'm not sure if MSX1 will run ALS properly, as I haven't tried it - yet)
Close this window, then click on 'Reset'.  The MSX will boot into BASIC, and then (should) automatically load and run ALS.

· MSX Virtual Disk - contains file 'AUTOEXEC.BAS', which can be transferred on to a MS-DOS (with MSX bootblock) disk, through a suitable emulator if you want to use it on a real MSX.

Limitations:

· Makeshift 'graphics' again, as I don't know how to change the MSX character set - I suppose I could add an external font. (if I knew how)

· Colours - There appears to be no way of changing individual character's colours

· I can't figure out the graphics commands - I either get Syntax Error or Illegal Operation.  So no house.

· The MSX doesn't appear to have keyboard auto-repeat, so you have to press 'M' (lower-case only!) rapidly, rather than just holding the key down.

· There is no 'Quit' option... but you won't want to anyway!

WARNING · WARNING · WARNING
There is a bug in fMSX 1.4 which causes the settings to be saved on exit, even if you haven't set 'Save Preferences'.  Basically, this means next time you start fMSX, ALS will also start unless you manually remove it from the Drive A box.  The only way around this is to format a MS-DOS disk (and write a MSX bootblock to it), and copy AUTOEXEC.BAS from the virtual disk on to it.  You can then play ALS (assuming Drive A is now set to something like 'PC0:') by inserting the disk prior to starting the emulation.

@{"Full instructions for Casio Digital Diary SF-4600C" link Casio4600}

@{"Full credits and ALS instructions" link ALS}

This requires a small screen databank, which can show each name/telephone number on a separate screen

The screen will probably look something like this:

NAME-NAME-NAME-
NUMBER-NUMBER-N

You preferably need a databank with 'secret' function.

Now, go into the mode (secret/not secret) where you don't normally store your telephone numbers, and type the following "names" into separate locations:

MMMMMMMMMMMMM,;
MMMMMMMMMMMM,;.
MMMMMMMMMMM,;..
MMMMMMMMMM,;...
MMMMMMMMM,;....
MMMMMMMM,;.....
MMMMMMM,;......
MMMMMM,;.......
MMMMM,;........
MMMM,;.........
MMM,;..........
MM,;...........
M,;............
,;.............
WELL MOWN!

It is possible to do a scrolling message as well.  You need something like this:

01WELL DONE. YO
02ELL DONE. YOU
03LL DONE. YOU'
04L DONE. YOU'V
05 DONE. YOU'VE
06DONE. YOU'VE 
07ONE. YOU'VE E
etc.
Whether this will scroll the correct way or not is debatable.  You may have to change the order of the numbers.  And probably delete any phone numbers in order to store 100 frames-worth of scrolling... (or open it up, and hot-wire a ZX81 RAM Pack to it???)

To play, simply press the button which normally scrolls through your names/numbers.  If you find yourself "unmowing", then you are scrolling through the wrong way.
To quit, turn the databank off or go into secret mode.

If you have a larger screen databank, then the game can be edited to look more like the original:

MMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
MMMMMMMMMMMMM,;

MMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMM

@node FlexALS "The Flex (emulator) Version..."
The file FlexALS is a Flex virtual disk for use with Ben Williams' FLEX Emulation System.  It should be placed in the same directory as FLEX.

To get it running, you need to issue the following commands:

@{b}LOGIN FlexALS 1@{ub} - This will put the virtual disk into virtual drive 1
                     The previous disk will be logged out automatically, and
                     any changes will be saved to the virtual disk file.
@{b}BASIC FlexALS@{ub}   - Loads and runs ALS

@{u}Notes on this version@{uu}

Flex BASIC is a bit rubbish (it is very similar to C64 BASIC), and lacks a few commands which are needed for ALS.  Therefore, there are no graphics (not even stars), and you have to press Return after 'M' to mow.  It is also about fifty thousand times slower than it should be (run FLEX on an '060!).
Another problem is memory: Somehow, an Amiga ASCII file of 3K manages to use up all 30K-ish of FLEX BASIC.  I had to split the game into two sections and use 'virtual arrays'.  These seem to have a small character limit, and the result is that the messages at the end of the game only include about two words.  The scroll routine doesn't work properly either, but there's no point in fixing it because of the character limit problem.
Please note that after the end message, it is Q that scrolls and any other key to go back to the menu - not the other way round, as stated.

@node AcornALS "The Acorn Archimedes/RISC PC Version..."
To play the Acorn version, copy the drawer !ALS on a PC formatted floppy and take it to your nearest @{i}RISC OS 3@{ui} Acorn Archimedes (A3010 or above) or RISC PC.
If it refuses to load, hold down Shift (on the Acorn) and double-click on !ALS - this takes you inside the app.  Click the middle mouse button over each of the files, follow across from the filename and down to Filetype.
Type the following into the box:
@{u}
Filename       Filetype@{uu}

!BOOT          Obey
!RUN           Obey
!HELP          Text
!ALS           BASIC     - Shift-double-click, to edit the licenced name
!ALSOLD        BASIC     - Double-click on this for the original ALS
ALSFONT        BBC Font
DEFFONT        BBC Font

I mention this because copying Acorn files on other computers tends to remove the file type settings.

Normally, double-clicking on !ALS opens the enhanced version (ALS+).  If you want to play the standard version, go inside the app and double-click on !ALSOLD.
The @{"enhanced version" link ALS+} of ALS has a "Licenced to:" feature.  You will notice that it is either blank, or contains something stupid like "Nobody".  To change it, hold down Shift and double-click on !ALS.  Move down the file to the part where the menu options are, and you will see the part to change.

BBC owners: try putting the inside of the application !ALS onto a BBC formatted disk (you need !Boot, !Run, !ALS, ALSFont, DefFont), Shift-Break-ing and *!Run -ing - it should (might) work.

We apologise for the lack of sound in this version, and the "widescreen" effect if you use it on a non-auto-stretch-to-fill-the-display monitor.

@node RM380Z "ALS: Research Machines 380Z - version notes"
@{u}Special notes about the RM380Z version of ALS@{uu} (NOT INCLUDED ON THIS DISK)

Load the program ALS into RML Extended BASIC

1. @{i}There are no graphics whatsoever@{ui}
I could have used a version of "RML Extended BASIC" which had "High Resolution Graphics Level 2".  If the level 1 graphics were anything to go by, you could fit about 40×28 pixels on the screen (each pixel was the same size as each text character), and end up with three lines at the bottom for the actual game.  Actually, I've just figured out what No HRG Adaptor means - No High-res graphics.  That means I was talking about low-res.  I've also figured out the graphics commands, and positioning the cursor, so the game will be a @{b}lot@{ub} better now.  And there may even be graphics (but I doubt it)

2. @{i}There is no colour whatsoever@{ui}
No, it's nothing to do with Hi-res graphics Level 2.  It's because the RM380Z didn't have colour (come on, it was early-1980s - and you didn't get much for £1,000 - £2,000 those days).

3. @{i}There was a point 3 here, but I deleted it.@{ui}

4. @{i}There are less messages, and they don't scroll@{ui}
The RM380Z had 56K of memory (actually, I reckon it had 64K, 8K being used for CP/M and COS, because 56K is a weird amount) - not a problem, you might think.  And you'd be right.  The only reason I didn't put any more in was because, a) The updating was sooo slooow, that I didn't think anyone would have the patience to get to the end of the game [now speeded up], b) I didn't think anyone would bother to play it anyway, even if they could find it on the 5¼" disk I put it on (just emphasizing how rubbish it was - the computer, not the game), and c) I couldn't be bothered to type in any more, since I doubted anyone would play it more than once.
Now it's better, there is more messages.  But they still don't scroll.

5. @{i}The "mowing" key is different@{ui}
I accidently took out the code to check for a keypress, put it back in and forgot the bit which checked which key you pressed.  Anyway, it's more fun with it accepting any key, because you can pick the keyboard up and move it around, even pretend it's a lawnmower if you like.  That is, of course, if your RM380Z has a dodgy keyboard which sends random characters when you wiggle it around (like the one I was using).
However, to mow like the original you must use the "@{i}REPT@{ui}" key.

6. @{i}It has one of the features of @{"ALS+" link ALS+}!@{ui}
The feature in question is the "night-time" level.  Instead of trying to use the graphics commands to (hopefully) construct a house and sun, I decided to just print stars on the background.

Anyway, the point of creating a special RM380Z version was:

     a) There was no decent stuff to use on it (only a crap maze game and "a world of graphics on the 380Z" ... great)
     b) To prove that @{i}ANY @{ui}computer can have great games written for it.

Some of the lucky ones (that is, of course, people who haven't used a RM380Z) might be interested in trying my program "RM380Z".  It is the most accurate emulation of one you'll ever see (if only because no-one else has bothered to write one).  It's part of my Wierd/Pointless Programs Collection which may, sometime, be uploaded to Aminet.

(another) NOTE TO RM380Z USERS: If you want to obtain the RM380Z version of ALS then, I'm afraid, you're out of luck.  I saved the game onto the nearest available 5¼" disk which happened to not be mine (I don't own any, you see).  Anyway, the disk went in with all the other floppies and I don't actually know where they are.  Even if I did, I wouldn't be able to copy it onto another disk for you, because that means getting the RM380Z out.  Which happens to be in a cupboard.  And I'm not getting that heap of %@#! out just to copy a game over which you'll only play once.  It'll take me all day as well, since it's bound to lock up on me.  Anyway, if you're reading this file then you obviously own an Amiga (or know someone who does), so why not play the Amiga version?

You might have to hunt around for a few things.
eg. => is in FUNC-PRGM-JUMP (or it is on my calc, anyway) and -> is the memory-type button, <> should be the "does not equal" symbol and / is actually the little "shift-prog" (on mine) triangle. If you're not sure what the button is, it looks like a little filled-in triangle, which is used to pause programs.  NOT A DIVISION SIGN.
Exclamation marks are kindly provided by the x! function - thanks!

NB: DON'T add spaces between commands.  Only put spaces in if they are enclosed in speech marks.  Each line should be ended with EXE (except the ones ending in /)

If you're really clever, and can fit all three of these in memory, you could add a random bit to the main program like this:

Int(Ran#×3) -> V

and instead of Prog 1, put these lines:

V=0 => Prog 1
V=1 => Prog 2
V=2 => Prog 3

»This is not due for release yet, so some things may be changed...«
(or it may not get released)

This is basically ALS2, but has a maze-type theme.

@{i}Current program status...@{ui}

The Acorn version has, I think, been put permanently on hold.  The PC version hasn't been (and probably won't ever be) started, and the Amiga version (which has got the furthest in terms of programming) has been put on hold until I decide to do some more.

@{i}End of Current program status...@{ui}

And now we have a special guest appearance from the (slightly edited) ACORN HELP FILE! (Applause and cheering, etc.)

Only joking (but you can if you want)

Game Concept
------------

Buy a lawnmower, and mow a lawn.  Certain obstacles and nice things will get in the way and damage your mower, make you pay/give you loads of money and other things etc. (It's a bit like Pacman, actually...)

The Gameplay
------------

What gameplay???

Menu Screen
-----------

1. Lawnmower Sales, inc.

The lawnmower shop - buy your 'mower here...

2. Lawnmower Repairs plc

The lawnmower repair shop, repair your 'mower here.

3. Lawnmower Upgrades Ltd.

The place to upgrade your 'mower
Warning: You can waste money by buying upgrades that do not work with your 'mower.

4. The Shed

Your home, and the place for configuring, saving/loading games examining amount of petrol, etc.

5. Go and Mow! (Bus Stop)

The only option currently available, but it doesn't do much because you can't buy a lawnmower yet!

6. Quit

Doesn't exist, because you'll never want to stop playing... actually, perhaps I will add it! (try @{b}Ctrl-C@{ub} or @{b}Esc@{ub})

The Lawnmowers
--------------

Flymo Hovermower 5000 .................... £300     (the best, electric)

The levels decrease in time allowed, and increase in obstacles
Some of the later levels REQUIRE better lawnmowers

A number will be displayed before each level.  If you type this in you WON'T get the same level - but no-one will notice anyway.

--------

Cursor keys - If I can get them to work
Redefinable keys - If I can be bothered
Q - Up    }
A - Down  } Standard

@node WBALS "Advanced Lawnmower Simulator for Workbench"
@{u}WB-ALS (for Workbench)@{uu}

These are the same as the standard or enhanced versions of ALS, but run in a Workbench window.

WB-ALS requires hisoftbasic.library (unfortunately.  I tried to get it to work in ACE BASIC, but all the text formatting went wrong), and has the following extra features (in pull-down menus):

1. Window...

This allows you to configure the window size.  Due to HiSoft BASIC V1 being ancient (1989), you are limited to a maximum window size of 640×512.  This means there is no point in increasing the workbench screen size or resolution beyond this (eg. Super-Hires Laced) specially to play a massive game of ALS.

If you press 'c' on this window, you can configure the shape of the sun.  Ideally, this should be circular.  (I actually only put this in for my use, but you may as well know about it)

2. Use Screen

This opens a custom Low-res screen for ALS.

3. Sound

This is a toggle item which allows you to turn the sound on or off.

4. Spectrum

This is another toggle item, which should be set to whether or not you have the Spectrum.font installed in fonts:.  In fact, the default is on and if it doesn't find the font it doesn't crash or go wrong or anything, you'll just get wierd characters for the graphics. (NOTE: The font must be in MEMORY.  You can initialise it by using the included application "InitSpeccyFont".  Put it in user-startup, or something.  Or double-click on it when you want to run WB-ALS.)  If you turn it off, ALS will default to using topaz/8 and some make-shift "graphics" like the ones found in the @{"RM380Z" link RM380Z} version.
(This really ought to be on auto-detection, but I've lost the source code...)
5. Load Config

Loads previously saved preferences.  This is done automatically when you start WB-ALS.  If it refuses to load, then the window size in the config file is set too large.  Change the screen mode or delete WB-ALS.config (in the program's directory).

6. Save Config

Saves your current preferences (window size, sun shape, sound, screen, font, colour assignments).

7. About...

Shows some information about WB-ALS

8. Quit

Does the same as the close gadget in the top left of the window border.

9. ALS+ included features (not a menu item)

These include the turbo mode and secret hidden mower.

10. Colours menu

     a) ALS Palette
     
     This changes some the colours in positions 9-11 of the Workbench palette, so the colours ALS uses look right.  It is better, however, to use/save some colour assignments which are correct for your WB palette (see below).  This is because changing the palette has to be done manually every time you start ALS (may be annoying) and also it may, possibly, affect Magic WB icons if you are using Workbench 3 with an 16-colour palette.  It might also affect WB2 or 3 8-colour screens, but I doubt it.
     
     Now for a quick moan about MagicWB icons: Why do some people like to force the first eight colours on a WB3 machine, just so those MWB icons @{i}all @{ui}look pretty?  WHAT IS THE POINT?  I mean, you can quite easily switch to 8-colour mode (so IconEdit works properly), load all the "faulty" icons into it, select edit -> copy from the pull-downs, select edit -> paste and then do the same with the second image (if it has one), and save them out again.  IS IT @{I}REALLY @{UI}@{U}THAT@{UU} HARD?  Now, if only we went back to WB3-style MagicWB icons, using colours n-4 etc...

     b) Assign...
     
     This brings up a little window with some colours and words on it.  If you click on a block, the colour which is used to depict the colour it's supposed to be depicting can be changed (eh?).  For example, because you probably didn't understand that, if you click on:
     
     @{bg highlight}WHITE @{bg background}
     
     This will change to
     
     @{bg fill}WHITE @{BG BACKGROUND}
     
     and next time ALS requests white, it will get blue instead.
     
     @{b}Use Default@{ub} will change all the assignments back to the defaults.
     
     @{b}Use MagicWB@{ub} will change the assignments to use the MagicWB colours only (ie. ALS will become mostly greyscale).  This uses colours n-4, n-3 etc. NOT colours 4-8.  So you have no excuse to keep forcing MWB Colours into those positions (rant, rave).

@node Author "Authors of Unsatisfactory Software's ALS"
Phillip Lake     - Supplied the original Speccy version:
                   without this, there wouldn't be any conversions...
                   Jointly did the Acorn/Casio conversion, and thought up
                   ideas for the 'bastardised' version (ALS+), and also
                   ALS Professional. Also had the idea of Databank/
                   Electronic Organiser/Mobile Phone versions.
                   Reportedly working on a Windows/DOS configurable ALS+
               
Chris Young      - Did all the Amiga conversions, plus ones for RM380Z, MSX
                   and FLEX.  Jointly did the Acorn and Casio versions.

Louise Allum     - Attempted to convert the code for the Amstrad CPC.
                   Mission Failed.
               
Simon Kingsbury  - Fixed the 'sort of flashing cursor bug' in the Acorn ver

Stuart Flint     - Erm, 'play-testing'. Most versions.

Andrew Tempany   - The usually completely sane Andrew actually enjoyed ALS
                   (the RM380Z version, as well)

Andrew Henderson - The usually not-that-sane-actually Andrew also enjoyed
                   it (the Acorn/Casio versions, that is)

E-mail addresses have been removed from this page on purpose, as none of us particulary want thousands of e-mails slagging us off and saying how crap/good etc ALS is...

OK, you win - send e-mail to me (Chris) at unsatisfactory@bigfoot.com
I don't often get chance to read my e-mails, so only send messages if you absolutely have to, and keep them short.  Including 'ALS' in the subject line will help me as well.  Thanks.

@node WB-ALS.readme
IMPORTANT LAST-MINUTE WB-ALS NOTES
==================================

1. When using a screen font larger than 8 pt, WB-ALS doesn't work quite as well.  (ie. the stuff in the window scrolls on the bottom line of grass)

2. The Spectrum font isn't always being used when it should be.
» It must be in @{b}MEMORY@{ub}.  To achieve this, you must run one of the standard ALS's first, and quit with Ctrl-C, or run @{"InitSpeccyFont" link InitFont}.  Then run WB-ALS and it'll work.

3. I've lost the source code (I think I used the disk for something else), and although I'm pretty sure I've got a back-up, I have yet to find it.  Basically, that means I can't fix these bugs.
@endnode

@node InitFont "InitSpeccyFont"
@{u}InitSpeccyFont@{uu}

This little utility loads the Spectrum.font font into memory, so it can be used by @{"WB-ALS" link WBALS}.
Just double-click it before starting WB-ALS, or put it in your user-startup/WBStartUp.
