Advanced Lawnmower Simulator
----------------------------
"A powerful and accurate lawnmower simulator"

The original Your Sinclair "April Fool's Megagame"
by Duncan MacDonald

Conversion by: 
   Chris Young and Phillip Lake
of Unsatisfactory Software 1996
Sort of flashing cursor bug fixed by Simon Kingsbury

Select your lawnmower and press "M" to mow.. 
                      It really is as easy as that!

Notes
-----

1. The blue strip at the bottom of the screen is a river

2. To change the "Licenced to:" bit, you have to go into the code and change
it manually... Sorry!

3. If after copying it onto a PC disk and taking it to your nearest Acorn,
it refuses to load, then check the filetypes are set as follows:

!ALS     - BASIC
!ALSOLD  - BASIC (Running this gives you the original version of ALS)
!BOOT    - Obey
!HELP    - Text
!RUN     - Obey
!SPRITES - Sprite
ALSFONT  - BBC Font
DEFFONT  - BBC Font

Copying Acorn files on other computers tends to remove the filetype settings.
