@NODE Intro "Introduction"

 @{b}Welcome to Diamond Caves V2.2!@{ub}

 Here is a quick overview about what to do and what to read to start
 immediately:

 - If you have a vague knowledge of what the game is about, you may start
 right now, playing the 25 @{"Tutorial" Link Hints}-Levels. They will introduce you into
 all of the important things and extras of Diamond Caves.
 There are 10 Easy-Levels and 25 Game-Levels. The Game-Levels are for
 expert players.

 @{b}Newusers@{ub} should read @{"What's it all about?" Link Game}.

 If you constantly fail to solve a Level, try watching the record-file by
 clicking on "Replay-game" or read the chapter @{"Level hints" Link Hints}.
 The main menu and all of its gadgets are discussed in @{"Title Screen" Link Title}.

 - If you want to reconfigure Diamond Caves please use the Diamond Caves
 Preferences program @{"DiamondPrefs" Link DC:DiamondPrefs.guide/Game 0}. Since V2.0 of Diamond Caves you can
 use the preferences program without a keyfile.

 - If you like the game, want to have more Levels or even like to create some
 of them yourself, read the part @{"How to register" Link Register} because you won't get the
 Editor or new Levels without paying the shareware (it's worth it!).

 - If you have comments, ideas or found some kind of bug, feel free to tell @{" me " Link Hawk}.
 But before asking stupid questions :-) read the chapter @{"Frequently asked questions" Link FAQ}!

 - New version may be released in the future. Read about the planned features in
 @{"Plans for the future" Link Future} and be sure to know @{"How to get updates" Link Updates}.

 - Do you think Diamond Caves is a bit slow on your Amiga? Then read
 @{"How can I improve game speed?" Link q4} in the chapter @{"Frequently asked questions" Link FAQ}.

 - And finally: If you are some kind of PD-distributer and want to sell Diamond
 Caves on Disk/CD-ROM or whatever, read the chapter @{"Copyright & Distribution" Link Copy}.

 That's about it, enjoy the game.

@ENDNODE

@NODE require "Requirements"

 This game is written in an OS-friendly way, so it may not be as fast as a
 common hardwarehack would be. The game requires:

 - Kick 2.0
 - 1 MB chipmem / 1 MB fastmem
 - 68000
 - Harddisk
 - Commodore's Installer (can be found on your Workbench-Install-Disk)

 recommended for ultimate joy:

 - Kick 3.x
 - a 68020 (or higher)
 - 2 MB chipmem (if you want to use large Levels or more colors)

 If you wonder why I decided to base the game on OS-routines and why the
 game is not as fast as it could be, read the @{"Frequently asked Questions" Link q2}.

 This program has beed tested with Enforcer, Mungwall and CodeWatcher.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Install "Installation"

 Diamond Caves comes with a ready-to-run installer-script for the Commodore
 Installer. Just click on the icon and follow the text in the window.

 Basically, the script will copy all files in a Directory, assign the name
 "DC:" to it and install some tooltypes.

 If you select update, the Installer only copys the files in the
 directory(s) lower or equal to your current version of Diamond Caves.
 No Icons, Levels, Highscores or Names will be changed.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Game "Whats it all about?"

 @{b}A short introduction to Diamond Caves@{ub}:

 This game is based on the idea of Boulder Dash back on the good old C64. I
 added some new ideas (and some gfx/sfx) of Emerald Mine by Kingsoft and a
 bunch of my own ideas (and ideas of my friends, other user, ...) as well.

 The main goal is to collect enough @{"Emeralds" Link Collect 1}  and reach the Exit in time.

 This task may be mastered alone or in teamwork.

 You can control the player by moving your Joystick in the appropriate
 direction. Pressing the button and moving the Stick causes the Player to
 stand still and collect the item in the given direction.

 P will Pause the game
 (Note:To turn off the pause mode, you have to activate the game window
 (simply click with your mouse into it) and then press "P" again)

 ESC quits the game

 the F-keys change the view-area:
 F1: Focus on Player 1
 F2: Focus on Player 2
 F3: Focus on both Players (note that you can't walk out of the visible
 area in this mode).

 If you are playing on a Public Screen you can resize the Window in Pause
 mode.

 If one of the Players is controlled by Keyboard, he may be moved using the
 cursor-keys, Space or R-Shift is the firebutton-equivalent.

 How many Emeralds you have to collect and how many seconds are left is
 visible in the status-line on top or bottom of the screen.

 You can increase your score in four different ways:
 - destroying opponents with a boulder (not with an explosion)
 - collecting things (Emeralds, Diamonds, Dynamite or Keys)
 - cracking a Nut
 - achieving a bonus by having time left when reaching the exit.

 All of the extras described below are shown one by one in the
 25 @{"Tutorial-Levels" Link Hints}.


 @{" solid objects " Link Solid}

 @{" Things to collect " Link Collect}

 @{" Enemys " Link Enemys}

@ENDNODE

@NODE Solid "solid objects"

 There are many things in the game just "lying around", some are described
 seperately in @{"Things to collect" Collect}.

 - @{b}Empty Space@{ub} (black)
 Not much to say :-)

 - @{b}Sand@{ub}
 You can walk through it

 - @{b}Boulder@{ub}
 Well, a rock is a rock. Be sure not to rest below one of them, they might
 smash you!

 - @{b}Bombs@{ub}
 Highly explosive!

 - @{b}Nuts@{ub}
 They reveale an Emerald if cracked open by a boulder.

 Rocks, Bombs and Nuts can be moved by the player!

 - @{b}Walls@{ub}
 Six types of walls:
   - steel Walls - can't be destroyed
   - brick Walls - can be crushed using some kind of explosion (Bomb)
   - special brick Walls - will expand to the sides!
   - brick Walls containing Emeralds/Diamonds - use a Bomb or Dynamite to
     get the Jewels
   - magic Wall (blue) - once a Rock/Emerald/Diamond falls onto the magic
     wall, the wall starts spinning for a few seconds, changing everything
     that falls through
   - invisible Wall - looks like empty space but is very solid! Can be
     bombed away.

 - @{b}Doors@{ub}
 There are two types of doors in the game:
   - Doors you need a @{"key" Link Collect 16} for (red, green, blue and yellow doors)
     Some doors are grey, so you don't know which kind of key you will need
   - Doors you can open/close using the blue switch

 - @{b}conveyor belt@{ub}
 Can be turned on/off using the green switch. Things lying on the belt will
 move!

 - @{b}Quicksand@{ub}
 Boulders may sink into and out of the quicksand.

 - @{b}Exit@{ub}
 a blue gate which starts flashing if you have enough Emeralds to enter.

 - @{b}Wheel@{ub}
 if you spin the Wheel, the @{"Robot" Link Enemys 13} will run towards the Wheel and not towards
 you. The Wheel only lasts for a few seconds.

 - @{b}Acidpool@{ub}
 everything that falls into the Acid is gone forever!

 - @{b}Switches@{ub}
   - the green Switch changes the direction of the conveyor belt
   - the blue switch open-/closes the switch-door

 - @{b}letters@{ub}
 you may read, ignor or bomb them away:-)

 @{" Enemys " Link Enemys}

@ENDNODE

@NODE Collect "Things to collect"

 Of course just collecting Emeralds would be very easy (and very boring) so
 there are lots of other goodies to collect in the game:

 - two kinds of @{b}Emeralds@{ub} called Emeralds (green) and Diamonds (blue).
 Diamonds count as three Emeralds.

 - @{b}Dynamite@{ub} to blow away walls and monsters. Ignit the Dynamite by
 holding down your firebutton for a few seconds. Then run away!

 - A @{b}Forcefield@{ub} (yellow coin) to protect you. Your player-sprite will fade
 to grey while in protected mode. You will hear a special sound to indicate the
 forcefield going down because it only lasts for a few seconds

 - @{b}Extratime@{ub} (green coin) that will be added to your time
 (bottom of screen).

 - @{b}Keys@{ub}. There are four different types of keys (red, green, blue and
 yellow) which are necessary for the four different doors.


 @{" solid objects " Link Solid}

 @{" Enemys " Link Enemys}

@ENDNODE

@NODE Enemys "Enemys"

 You are not alone in the Diamond Caves!
 Here are the enemys you might encounter:

 - @{b}Bug@{ub}
 crawling on the right wall, the Bug can be changed into 9 Emeralds and
 1 Diamond if crushed by a boulder

 - @{b}Spaceship@{ub}
 always moves on the left wall

 Touching the Bug or the Spaceship is very dangerous!

 - @{b}Robot@{ub}
 This one follows you until he can kill you!
 Try spinning the @{"Wheel" Link Solid 51} to divert the Robot.

 - @{b}Eater@{ub}
 This brother of Pacman will eat Diamonds and can be changed into various
 things (be surprised!) by shmashing him with a boulder

 - @{b}the amoeba@{ub}
 expands through normal sand and quicksand. Beware of the drops!
 Spaceships and Bugs won't survive contact with the amoeba.

@NODE Title "Title Screen"

 There are several buttons in the title screen which can be accessed using
 the mouse in Port 1 or (if you already plugged in a Joystick) using either
 the cursor-keys and Space or the Joystick in Port 2.

 @{b}Quit@{ub}: Guess what this one does.

 @{b}Get Levels@{ub}: Select a Leveldirectory. Each Dir may contain up to 99 Levels
   (25 in the unregistered version).

 @{b}One Player/Two Player@{ub}: Change the number of Players.
   For even more players read @{"Plans for the future" Link Future}.

 @{b}Name@{ub}: Select a name or enter a new one. The Number is your Handicap (your
   highest possible Level). It gets updated every time you solve a Level
   and will be saved automatically.

 @{b}Level/Max@{ub}: The current Level and your Handicap.

 @{b}Score@{ub}: Your score so far (only for this Leveldirectory)

 @{b}Games played@{ub}: Number of games you played in this Leveldirectory

 @{b}Highscores@{ub}: Display the Highscorelist for the selected Level.

 @{b}Play game@{ub}: Play the game. If you enter the Highscorelist, the list will be
   saved automatically.

 @{b}Record game@{ub}: You can play the Level and every move will be recorded into a
   file (this is not possible in the unregistered version).

 @{b}Replay game@{ub}: If a record-file exists, you can watch it.

 @{b}The big DC-Logo@{ub}: Shows the About window containing some information.

   - maybe even a competition-mode,
     either one-on-one or two-on-two
 - new extras:
   - a canon (gun) to shoot the enemys
   - maybe teleporters
   - new (and improved :) enemys
 - new goals:
   - kill all enemys (or all other players)
     instead of collecting emeralds

@ENDNODE

@NODE q1 "Where is the AGA-Version of Diamond Caves? "

 Q:@{b}Where is the AGA-Version of Diamond Caves?@{ub}

 A:There will be no "real" AGA-Version because Diamond Caves already supports
  AGA-screenmodes and gfx with up to 256 colors. All you (or somebody else)
  need to do is to draw a 256 color version of the Diamond Caves gfx. This can
  be done using the program @{"DiamondGfx" Link "DC:DiamondGfx.guide/Main" 0}. DiamondGfx already
  includes a 32-color version of the orginial gfx as well as all the
  IFF-pictures you need.

@ENDNODE

@NODE q2 "Why do you use OS-routines? They are so slow!"

 Q:@{b}Why do you use OS-routines? They are so slow!@{ub}

 A:The reason for this is that about 1987 I bought the original Emerald
  Mine by Kingsoft (which inspired me to do Diamond Caves 7 years later).
  The problem with EM is, that it refuses to work under Kick2.0 and that it
  has some problems with 32bit-fast mem and fast processors. I didn't want
  to write a game that in a few years no one would be able to play because
  of crappy coding.

  OS-routines are not that slow, part of the lack of speed results in the
  fact that I tried to make everything as configurable as possible. Where
  most EM-clones use fixed values for screen- and playfield-size, my
  program adjusts to the Amiga it runs on and supports Level from 10x10 up
  to 100x100.

  Be sure to read @{"How can I improve game speed?" Link q4}.

@ENDNODE

@NODE q3 "Why can't I play new Levels?"

 Q:@{b}My friend has the Diamond Caves Leveleditor but my unregistered copy of
  Diamond Caves refuses to load the new levels. What am I doing wrong?@{ub}

 A:The unregistered version of Diamond Caves is not capable of loading
  other levels than the ones that came with the distribution.

  If you really want to play new Levels, please pay the shareware fee.

@ENDNODE

@NODE q4 "How can I improve game speed?"

 Q:@{b}How can I improve the speed of the game?@{ub}

 A:There are several things to make the game work faster:

  - use Kickstart 3.0 or 3.1 instead of Kick2.0. Some gfx-routines are up
  to 10 times faster in Kick3.x and under 3.x interleaved Bitmaps will be
  used, this improves gfx-speed.

  - don't use the gameport.device unless you have to, it's slower than
  directly accessing the hardware.

  - playing in Interlace is great if you have a 17" monitor but because I
  have to update 4 times the screensize than in non-Interlaced modes the
  game will be slower.

 - running a lot of programs in the background might consume important

@NODE q5 "Why are some things different from the original Boulder Dash?"

 Q:@{b}I'm a big fan of the C64-game Boulder Dash, but in Diamond Caves some
  things are different. The amoeba won't change into Emeralds when
  surrounded by solid objects and Bugs (Butterflys in Boulder Dash) can't
  be killed by Emeralds.@{ub}

 A:Actually, Diamond Caves is a(nother) clone of the first Amiga-clone
  "Emerald Mine" by Kingsoft from 1987 and not a direct version of Boulder
  Dash. I don't want to change the handling of things in the game in future
  version because this might confuse current users.

@ENDNODE

@NODE q6 "Where is the blue key in Game-Level 1?"

 Q:@{b}I'm new to Diamond Caves and I can't find that stupid :) blue key I
  need to enter the exit in Game-Level 1.@{ub}

 A:Have you played Tutorial-Level 14 (The Return of Pacman)? In this level,
  you're supposed to learn that the Eater holds many different things
  "inside". To get them, you have to smash him with a boulder. If you've
  looked at the preview picture of the Diamond Caves Editor you may even
  have that the Level displayed is Game-Level 1 and in the Eater-window you
  can see that the blue key is "in" the last (the 4th) Pacman.

@ENDNODE

@NODE q7 "Is it possible to use old Emerald Mine Levels with Diamond Caves?"

 Q:@{b}I've got another Boulder Dash clone (insert your favorite one here) and
  I want to use previously created Levels in Diamond Caves. Is this
  possible?@{ub}

 A:Yes, this is possible. Sinec V1.1, the Diamond Caves Editor has an
  option to import Levels from these Boulder Dash clones:

  Balder's Grove
  Emerald Mine I
  Emerald Mine II
  Emerald Mine III
  Emerald Mines CD

  If you havn't got the Diamond Caves Editor, read the chapter @{"How to register" Link Register}.

 And if your favorite Boulder Dash clone isn't supported yet, feel free to
 contact me.

@ENDNODE

@NODE q8 "The Joystick-Emulation in the Titlescreen does not work right."

 Q:@{b}The Joystick-Emulation in the Titlescreen does not work right.@{ub}

 A:I'm using the gameport.device as shown in the RKM Devices. The only reason,
  this can go wrong is if another program is using the gameport.device, too.
  Some Screenblankers (like BlitzBlank) check the Joystick-port as well to
  determine wether to blank or to stop blanking. For some (yet unknown) reason,
  this interfears with my Joystick-routine. For now, please turn off switches
  like "Check Joystick" in Blitzblank.

@ENDNODE

@NODE q9 "Why is the scrolling not as smooth as in previous version of DC?"

 Q:@{b}Why is the scrolling not as smooth as in previous version of DC?@{ub}

 A:There are (at least :-) two reasons for the scrolling beeing not very
  smooth:

  1. If the program needs more than one frame to update the screen, there will
  be a very short delay in the srolling (flicker).

  Suggestion: Free some CPU-time (close other applications) or get a faster
  processor :-)

  2. If you are not running in PAL-mode (50Hz), the scrolling will flicker
  because I'm updating the screen every 1/50 second wether or not the
  VBI-frequency is 50Hz. This is because the game should run at the same speed
  under every screenmode.

  Suggestion: Use PAL-modes or turn on the "VBI-timing" in @{"DiamondPrefs" Link "DC:DiamondPrefs.guide/Game" 52}.

@ENDNODE

@NODE q10 "I've got serious problems with Diamond Caves scrolling the screen!"

 Q:@{b}I've got serious problems with Diamond Caves scrolling the screen,
  sometimes the left/right borders get clipped!

 A:This is a bug in graphics.library v39.x and lower. It is fixed in
  Kickstart3.1.

  If you don't have Kick3.1, you should not use maximum overscan values.


  To prove that this is actually a bug in graphics.library and not in
  Diamond Caves:

    Open the preferences program Prefs:Colors in a way, that it uses it's
    own screen. Now drag it to the left/right. Using Kick3.0 the edges seem
    to disappear sometimes, depending on your overscan values.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Register "How to register"

 I spent a lot of work and one year of programming in Diamond Caves so I
 think it's only fair to demand a little reward if you, the user, want to
 use my program on a regular basis.

 @{" What do I get? " Link Get}

 @{" What and how do I have to pay? " Link Pay}

 The following things are @{b}not@{ub} possible in the unregistered version:

 - play other Levels than the 60 Levels included in the unreg.version
 - save or test Levels using the Diamond Caves Editor
 - use the 32color-version of Diamond Caves (included in DiamondGfx)
 - draw your own gfx for Diamond Caves
 - use your own samples withing Diamond Caves
 - record Levels to watch them later

@ENDNODE

@NODE Get "What do I get?"

 After paying the fee you will receive a keyfile and the latest version of
 Diamond Caves. Furthermore the registered version includes:

 - you will now be able to use @{b}up to 99 Levels per Leveldirectory@{ub}

 - you will be able to @{b}record your Levels@{ub} and watch them later or show them
 to your friends.

 - @{b}DiamondEdit@{ub}:
 Take a look at the Preview-picture!
 The Diamond Caves Editor is capable of loading old Emerald Mine Levels.
 The Diamond Caves Leveleditor is based on MUI but you do *not* have to be
 a registered user of MUI to use the Editor. The Dimamond Caves Editor
 works 100% even with the unregistered version of MUI. MUI is (C) Stefan
 Stuntz and it's available on AmiNet and on several PD-Collections.

 - @{b}DiamondGfx@{ub}:
 Now you are able to include your own graphics into Diamond caves. Comes
 with the original gfx as IFF-pictures.
 This also includes an improved ready-to-use 32-color-version!

 - @{b}DiamondSfx@{ub}:
 Include your own samples into DiamondCaves!

 You will also get a bunch of @{b}new Levels@{ub}, for example 25 Beginner-Levels
 and the Easy-Levels 11-60. Have you mastered the first 10 Easy-Levels yet?

@ENDNODE

  envelope in a way it can't be seen from the outside. There havn't been
  any problems yet.
