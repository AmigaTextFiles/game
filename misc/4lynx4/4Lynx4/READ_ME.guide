System Requirements

This game requires approximately 1.5 MB to run and does not need AGA. It was
written using an A1200 and has been tested on an unexpanded A500 Plus (1MB of
RAM) and did not work!

Hard drive installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you have received this game on disk just copy the disk to your games 
directory.

If you have downloaded this game from a BBS or other such place then you
should have received it in an LHA archived form. If you unpack it to your
games directory a new directory will be created. The game will be inside this.

If you do not have the AMOS.Library in your LIBS directory
then you should run the LIB_INSTALLER program. This will copy it for you.

To run the game double-click on the 4LYNX4 icon.
