System Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This game requires approximately 1.5 MB to run and does not need AGA. It was
written using an A1200 and has been tested on an unexpanded A500 Plus (1MB of
RAM) and did not work! It has also been test on my bro's A600 (2MB) and it
worked.

--------------------------------------


Hard drive installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you have received this game on disk just copy the disk to your games
directory.

If you have downloaded this game from a BBS or other such place then you
should have received it in an LHA archived form. If you unpack it to your
games directory a new directory will be created. The game will be inside this.

If you do not have the AMOS.Library in your LIBS directory
then you should run the LIB_INSTALLER program. This will copy it for you.

To run the game double-click on the 4LYNX4 icon.


Floppy drive instillation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you have the game in LHA form and wish to install it to a disk here's
what ya do...

1. Unpack the 4LYNX4.LHA file to you RAM disk. The command would be something
   like this:

    Lha e 4LYNX4.LHA RAM:

2. Format a disk and name it "4LYNX4". 

3. Install a bootable bootblock using this command from the SHELL:

    Install DF0:  

4. Go into the 4LYNX4 directory on your RAM disk. Copy ALL the files to the
   4LYNX4: disk.  

   The game should now boot from disk.
