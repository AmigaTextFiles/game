   Here´s the Story:

   God sends you a Beast to help Adam and Eva with their Decision about

   "eating Apples". Ride the Snake trough the Desert, err, Paradise and

   try to catch all apples, and know, the Time is short! (Until the Apples

   rott.) Keep away from any thing you see, because the snake is very

   hungry, and tries to bite everythang. In some cases she´ll bite on

   Granit.! Be ware, use your Joystick left/rite to move her carefully

   around, to the apples.

   While getting the Snake delivered, God says that there are, err,

   In Main Menu there are switches between hungry/cool Snake and

   slow/fast game speed.

   If you select "snake: hungry" she will be able to turn around fastly,

   this can be dangerous, especially at "fast" game speed.

   Selecting "cool", and she´ll be cool moving around.

   "fast", there is nothing to tell about, but choosing "slow" will

   slow the heavenly mission, aehm, game down until you press the

   Fire Button, as long as you want it fast.

   Your Snake has after Start ten lives, a crash and she loose life!

   If there´s no more live in her, Adam and Eva will "eat", and then,

   while taking your last breath you see them going down, down down.....

   To return to the WB or whatever, press the LMB while snakin´.



   What you need for this Job:

   its an Amiga Computer (It was written on a A1200), a Joystick in Port 2,

   and 300KB free Mem.

   Hope you enjoy this 32 Color game.
