                               =============

Description:
------------
 This is my second attempt to do a 'Comanche'-like voxelspace.
 It now uses chunky2planar-conversion instead of a copperscreen,  which
 has the advantage of higher resolution and finer color gradations.

Usage:
------
 Use the mouse and the right mouse button to fly over the landscape.
 Press left mouse button to quit the engine.

Known bugs:
-----------
 Maybe the sky is not drawn correctly on 040+ cpu's. Currently I don't
 know why this occurs.

Future improvements:
--------------------
 - Bigger and more realistic landscape
 - Depth cueing
 - X/Z-Axis rotation
 - Color interpolation
 - Variable resolution
 - Graphic card support
