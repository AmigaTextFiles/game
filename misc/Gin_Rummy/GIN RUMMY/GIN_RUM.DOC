                 GIN RUMMY -  THE CARD GAME

                     A PD GAME BY DEANO

Gin Rummy is basically the computer version of the popular card  game 
of the same name. The object of the game is to get four of a kind and 
three of a kind. For example, three kings and four aces.

You  start off with seven cards which is a different deal every  time 
you  play.  When  the message SELECT AN OPTION appears then  you  can 
select only two options......TAKE which allows you to pick you a card 
and SORT which allows you to put your cards in order.  These are  two 
of the six options on the menu bar on the bottom of the screen.

When  the  Select an Option message appears,  click on TAKE  and  the 
computer will ask you to choose a card. You'll see two cards together 
where  one is face now.  Click on the first card to pick up from  the 
pack  or the second one to pick up the card put  down.  The  computer 
will then ask you if you want to take or throw this  card....choosing 
TAKE  with  the  mouse on the menu bar will result  in  the  computer 
asking  you  to  choose a card from your hand  to  replace  with  the 
chosen one. Just click on a card from your hand and the cards will be 
replaced and your old one will appear on the put down pile.
 
If  you  select THROW then your card you choose will be  thrown  down 
onto the put down pile.

Once you have taken a card or thrown it down you can then either  use 
the  SORT option or click on the FINISH option to tell  the  computer 
you have finished so it can have its go.

The  QUIT option can only be used when the message Select  an  option 
appears on screen. This returns you to Workbench or Desktop depending 
on which computer you are using.
 
Finally  the down pointing arrow option allows you to put  down  your 
hand if you have a winning one.  The computer will look for four of a 
kind and three of a kind,  if this is not found then you will be told 
you don't have a full set and the game will continue.

You  can  also get four and three of a kind in  order  of  suit,  for 
example you can have Ace,  Two,  Three and Four of clubs or any other 
suit.  As long as the cards are one after the other. You can also mix 
so an hand of say...Ten,  Jack, Queen, King of hearts and three six's 
is an acceptable hand to win the game.   However   you   can't   have 
something like Jack,  Queen,  King, and Ace of a suit. This is due to 
the  fact  that  when  I tried it it kept  cocking  up  the  checking 
routine. Still nobodies perfect. There are no floating cards either.

IMPORTANT: Before you put your hand down you must first put it in 
order using the SORT option otherwise the computer won't like it.

MUSIC- ST VERSION

When the Select an Option message appears, pressing the function keys 
F1 to F10 allow you to select one of ten tunes to listen to. The music 
loads from disk so make sure the disk is always in the drive. You may 
change the music if you wish.  Just put it on the disk and rename  it 
to  MUSIC(no).MUS  where 'no' is a number between one  and  ten.  The 
program understands most chip music with the .MUS extension.

MUSIC- AMIGA VERSION

When the Select an Option message appears pressing number keys 1 to 10 
allows you to play one of four different mods.  You can add your  own 
mods  by giving it a name like MUSIC2.MOD and putting it on the  disk 
as the game loads its music from disk.

FINAL WORD:

code to either version then send a stamp and disk to.....
