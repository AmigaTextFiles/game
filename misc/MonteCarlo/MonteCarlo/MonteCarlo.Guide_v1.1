@NODE 1. "Roulette"
 Roulette
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The game of Roulette consists of a spinning cylinder and a numbered
 playing field.  Both are numbered from 0 to 36.  The playing field is
 numbered in ascending order while the cylinder is numbered randomly around
 the edge.  Using chips, the players bet on numbers, number combinations, or
 single chances like red or black.  The croupier controls the game under the
 supervision of a table chief.  The croupier assists the players in placing
 bets, spins the roulette wheel and drops the ball, announces the winning
 number and number combinations, and counts out the winnings.  The croupier
 in this case is your Amiga computer!

 Note
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Losing chips are immediately removed from the table.
 After the winnings have been paid, the winning chips may be removed from
 the table.

@NODE 2. "Monte Carlo - the game"
 Monte Carlo - The Game
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 This game should run on any Amiga (NTSC or PAL) with 1 megabyte of RAM and
 Workbench 1.3 or above.  If this is not the case, or if any bugs are found,
 please let me know.  This game was designed on a DblPal screen.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The playing field is located in the large window to the left.

 At the top of this window, your money is displayed.  How much you have in
 your pocket is called "Pocket".  How much is currently on the table is
 called "Table".  "Total" is the sum of pocket and table cash.

 The small grey area in the upper-left corner displays the last twenty
 winning numbers.  The most recent winning number is displayed at the bottom
 of the grey area.

@NODE 2.1. "Buttons"
 Buttons
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The "Bet Types" window is filled with buttons labelled with each type of
 bet.  To see legal placement of your betting chips, just click on a button.
 I recommend that you click on each button at least once before playing for
 the first time.

 You can select the size of chip to add or subtract from the playing field
 by clicking on a button in the "Jeton" window.

 The "Sub" button in the "Mode" window allows you to subtract an amount from
 any bet currently on the playing field.  If the Jeton size is larger than
 the bet then the entire bet is removed.
 +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 | Example: To remove 10 units from a 50 unit bet on the table...          |
 |                                                                         |
 |  1. Set the Jeton size to "10".                                         |
 |  2. Click on the "Sub" button (if you haven't already done that).       |
 |  3. Click on the 50 unit bet on the table.  If you hold down the mouse  |
 |     button, a small window will open with a message "10 subtracted.  40 |
 |     here."                                                              |
 |                                                                         |
 | Note: A status window will open each time a bet is placed, removed, or  |
 | added.                                                                  |
 +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 The "Zero" button removes a bet of any size from the table and places it
 back in your pocket.  The "Add" button adds to an existing bet or places a
 new bet.  The "Info" button allows you to check on a bet without altering
 it.

 After placing all bets, click on the "Spin" button to generate a winning
 number.  Winnings will be calculated and placed in you pocket (Single
 chance winnings are placed on the table to make it easier to play 'Paroli'
 type betting systems).  Original bets will be left on the table and may be
 moved or removed, if desired.

 Losing bets are removed from the table immediately.

@ENDNODE

@NODE 2.2. "Menus"
 Menus
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The "Set Cash..." menu item allows you to change the amount of cash you
 have at any time.

 If the "Debug" menu item is checked, you will be prompted to enter your own
 number each time you click on "Spin".  This allows you to check that the
 program is working correctly.  You may also use this function to use a
 "real" series of numbers that you have obtained from a casino.

@ENDNODE

@NODE 2.3. "Zero and en prison"
 Zero and "en prison"
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 If Zero appears:
 ----------------
 The stakes on single chances are either blocked (en prison) or divided (the
 player loses half his stake), at the player's discretion.  If zero appears
 twice in succession, the stakes already blocked (en prison) become
 double-blocked.  If zero appears three times in succession, the
 double-blocked stakes are collected by the bank.  If, after zero has
 appeared once, another number appears on which single chance stakes are
 blocked, these stakes are freed.  Double-blocked stakes become
 single-blocked stakes (en prison).

 If you are not sure how this works, then use the "Debug" menu item to make
 a series of winning zeroes and see how this affects the bet.

 Note: Bets that are "en prison" are shown in the "Table" and "Total" amounts
 but cannot be affected by the "Add", "Sub", or "Zero" buttons.  You cannot
 check them with the "Info" button, either.

@ENDNODE

@NODE 2.4. "Last, But Not Least"
 Last, But Not Least
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 This program simulates a french single-zero table.  A player at a
 double-zero table is doubling the casino's chances of winning.  Always play
 at a single-zero table if one is available.

@ENDNODE

@NODE 3. "Legal Stuff"
 Legal Stuff
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 This program is FREEWARE and should not be distributed for a profit.  A
 reasonable fee may be charged for replication and media.  Fred Fish and the
 Aminet fall within this category.  The exception is @{"APC&TCP" Link 3.1.}.

 Use this program at your own risk.

@{" APC&TCP " Link 3.1.}
@ENDNODE

@NODE 3.1. "APC&TCP"
 APC&TCP
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 APC&TCP have permission to distribute MonteCarlo on "Amiga Games" and the
 "APC&TCP-CD-ROM" CD's

@ENDNODE

@NODE 4. "ACE"
 ACE
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 David Benn is the creator of ACE - Amiga BASIC Compiler with Extras

 This great BASIC development package is up to version 2.4 and its
 FREEWARE.

 I really wanted to include some of his "readme" files but I don't want to
 with out his permission.  I really can't do this great software justice.
 It creates executable for all Amigas from 1.3 to 3.x!

 If you program at all then do yourself a favour and get a copy.  It is
 available from the Aminet (live or CD-ROM set).  And I believe it is on
 almost every second CD-ROM I own.

 No excuse for not having it.

 Thanks again, Mr. Benn.

@ENDNODE

@NODE 5. "Text2Guide"
 Text2Guide
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The Amigaguide document version of this file was created by a wonderful,
 easy-to-use program called Text2Guide by Stephan Sürken.  This was the only
 Amigaguide creator that did what it was supposed to do on the Aminet CDs
 that I own!  Thanks, Stephan!

@ENDNODE

@NODE 6. "The Author"
 The Author
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 I am a thirty(something)-year-old American living and working in Germany.
 I read and speak German (all of my Amiga documentation is in German!), have
 a great sense of humour, and enjoy spending hours at my A4000/030.  After I
 bought a CD-ROM drive in 1994, my computer took on a life of its own.

 I am also keenly interested in Roulette and no matter where you live here
 in Europe, there is a casino nearby.  I have read several books on the
 subject and play in several nearby casinos (Bad Homburg and Wiesbaden).  In
 my search for a system to "beat the bank", I have lost hundreds of German
 Marks.

 A computer roulette simulation was what I needed to keep from going broke!
 After searching through all of my CD-ROMs for a roulette game (and not
 finding one), I decided to write my own.

 Of course, without ACE by David Benn, this program would never have been
 written.  Thank you, Mr. Benn for giving the "average Amiga user" the power
 of your programming environment.

@NODE 8. "New Features"
 New Features
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   v1.1 - 20 Oct 96
   ----------------
   o Added error checking to user input!
   o Also fixed the 3D-look.
   o Even chance winnings are now left on the table to make playing 'Paroli'
     systems more convenient.  This is also more consistent with actual
     casino play.
   o Also fixed a problem that caused the text to be out of place if an
     eight-point system font was not being used.

   v1.1 - 10 May 97
   ----------------
   o Fixed money display
