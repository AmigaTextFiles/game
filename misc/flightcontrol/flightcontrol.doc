About
-----

Flight-Control is an air-traffic simulation much like 'Kennedy Approach' 
from Microprose. Do not expect any jawdropping graphics or animation. 
If you are looking for fast action then this is *definitely* not a game 
for you :)

This is the 1.0 version. It lacks certain things that were present in the
original Kennedy Approach, most notably sound and a salary/career scheme.
In fact, you can't 'win', just the 'inner game' is present. Otherwise
it's completely functional.


Copyright and disclaimer
------------------------

Flightcontrol is copyright (c) 1997 by Paul van der Valk. This program comes 
without warranty. Use it on you own risk.


Installation
------------

Unpack the archive somewhere with LHA. No special libraries or assigns are
needed. Just run the executable (flightcontrol).


Gameplay
--------

After running the program you have the option of starting a new game, 
configuring the options or quitting. 

The option screen is described elsewere in this doc.

After selecting (N)ew game you are presented with the playfield. For
those that have never played Kennedy Approach before the game-objective 
is shortly explained here.

Given is a list of periodically updated flights. Your task is to complete them. 
Flights can be from/to airfields and/or entrances/exits. The following 
conditions apply.

   - Incoming flights enter at 5000 feet.
   - Outgoing flights must leave at 4000 feet.

That's it :) Well almost. Flights may not conflict with each other. Two
(or more) flights are in conflict if:

    The difference in height is less than 1000 feet
           AND
    Their horizontal distance is less than a radius of 4 'dots'.

A yellow circle indicates that two (or more) flights are in conflict.
A grey circle indicates a potential conflict, it is provided as a warning.

Furthermore you should avoid flight-delay. Flight-delay occurs when an 
airplane is ready for take-off, but waiting on an airfield too long.
Such delay is presented as a red bar.

The top of the screen contains the flight-schedule that looks like this:

       I I I I   -- flight ID
       S S S S   -- source
       D D D D   -- destination
       H H H H   -- height
       ^ ^ ^ ^   -- speed marker
       # # # #   -- attended sign

The meaning of these fields is:

  flight ID
    Identifies the flightnumber (1-9 / A-Z).

  source
    Origin of the flight.

  destination
    Destination of the flight.

  height
    Height in thousands of feet.

  speed marker
        - green  : slow plane
        - red    : fast plane
        - purple : turbo plane

  attended sign
    This sign will be up until the flight receives a command. Provides
    a quick overview of unattended flights.

  bars
    The vertical bars are time indicators with the following functions:
        - brown  : time before a flight is available.
        - green  : time a flight is ready.
        - red    : time a flight is overtime (delayed).

Ok, lets play. Suppose we want to control flight 3. Simply press 3 on 
the alphanumeric keyboard (not on the numeric keypad, this is used for
scrolling). The relevant plane and job (topscreen) change color. The desired 
height and direction can be selected with the cursor keys. Use Enter to accept, 
or space to cancel. It's as simple as that. Theoretically :)


Overview of in-game keys
------------------------

        - 1..9 / a..z   select flight
        - spacebar      cancel operation
        - 0             pause
        - numpad 1-9    view corner/side/center of map (for large maps)
        - Esc           exit game



Option screen
-------------

A quick overview of the option screen:

  Map                        : select one of eight maps
  Flight frequency           : define seconds between new flights
  Route skill                : higher values produce less obvious routes
  Initial flights            : define number of flights at start of new game
  Plane speed distribution   : define mixture of plane types


Todo
----

Possible future enhancements:

    - A job/career scheme.
    - Sound.
    - Mouse control.
    - Replay mode.
    - Disasters.
    - Multiple views (splitscreen)?
    - More airplane types? Enemy planes?
    - Scenery?



Enjoy!
