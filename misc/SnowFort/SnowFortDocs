            ******* INTRODUCTION *******

                (What is STRATOPLEX?)

   I have succeeded in my mission of creating The Ultimate
Games In The History Of The Universe.  This is the most diverse
fleet of games ever created by a single person!  Now you can
play Snowfort, the first game designed using the aesthetic
design principles of "Feng Shuey".

   You can now get my games for new lower prices, as defined
in the middle of this document.  You can get 1 disk from my
armada for $3, 2 disks for $5, 3 disks for $8, 4 disks for $10,
etc...  All quoted prices are USA Dollar Quotes.  Current
exchange rates cannot be printed, as they change daily.  To save
postage, avoid sending metal coinage, and round to the nearest
full currency unit.  Also, you cannot print your own currency,
even if you intend to become your very own country.

   Skip to the end of this document if you want to read my
short story.  It is another extra, inherent in this newest game.

*** *** *** *** WHAT IS SNOWFORT? *** *** *** ***

          (Remember, STRATOPLEX is coming soon!)

   SNOWFORT lets you build snowforts and throw snowballs to
your heart's content.  You can be any of the characters in
Snowfort: a Player, a snowman, or Death.  Each has it's own
special characteristics to master.  Battle between 6 players to
gain territory by rolling up large snowballs to either build
impassible walls, or throw them at your friends.  Players can
move and fire in all 8 joystick directions.  Snowfort defines the
highest levels of playability ever in any game.

   Destroy fortifications with snowballs or stand by the fire-
drum to gain energy.  This melts snowballs as well as Snowmen
so watch out for it.  Death goes around draining people's
energy, and are really just reincarnated CONUNDRUM tiles :)
You can choose to control Players, Snowmen, or Death, whatever
you prefer.

   As always, this game is hard drive installable by simply
dragging the files over.

     ******* PLAY SEQUENCE INSTRUCTIONS *******

         (STRATOPLEX, STRATOPLEX, STRATOPLEX)

   All characters can make snowballs.  In order to do this, you
must hold down the fire button on the joystick and run around
where there is some snow.  This lets your character build up a
massive snowball.  What the snowball is used for (and it's
effects) are determined by the size of the snowball.  In the
Control Panel, the six snowball sizes can be programmed to do
what you want.

   If you are standing still, and you hold down the fire button,
you can fire a continuous barrage of the smallest snowballs. 
It is this "Snowball Barrage" that enables you to guard access
corridors in the snow.

   You will notice that you leave a trail when gathering snow.
 You will also notice that the trail is getting slowly filled in
with falling snow.  It's Snowing!  The rate of snow fall is based
on spare processor time, so faster Amigas have awesome
blizzards!

   The teleporters in the corners of the screen will take you
from one end of the playing field to another.  This is a useful
tactic if you are cornered, or want to invade another fort.
You can place snowballs over the teleporters to block them,
which is also useful at times.  Each player has the ability to
teleport if they are stuck, by using the F1-F6 keys. There are
a limited number of these, so they should not be wasted.

   The Player character is the basic character type, and can
slowly replenish energy at the fire-drum.

   The Snowman character has the ability to walk around and
gather snow for it's energy bar.  This is done only if the fire
button is NOT pressed, since Snowmen can also make snowballs.
Of course, the fire-drum will hurt a Snowman if it is too close.

   The Death character has the ability to drain energy from
other players.  Death cannot drain energy from other Death
players, nor can it gain energy from the fire-drum.  Death is
by far the most powerful of the players.

   There are three basic types of game: Elimination, Capture
the Flag, and Tag.

   The Elimination objective just lets you attack each other
normally, by building forts, hiding behind them, and throwing
snowballs.  The other types of game allow these actions as well,
but with some modifications.

   Capture the Flag allows you to grab an enemy's flag, then
run over to your home base and touch your starting point.  This
kills the player whose flag it is, and relocates the flag.  Flags
cannot be teleported, so you have to move through the thick of
battle to get the flag home.  Most importantly, your snowballs
will teleport players to their starting position, making it
possible to guard your flag effectively.

   The Game of Tag has a pointer that drains energy from the
player with it.  Touching another player allows you to pass the
pointer to another player.  The pointer is randomly relocated if
the player with it runs out of energy.

     ******* CONTROL PANEL INSTRUCTIONS *******

     (The Pete W Storonskij game of STRATOPLEX)

   The control panel lets you drastically modify the game's
parameters, and to set conditions that will determine the
difficulty level, as well as the very nature of the game.

GAME OPTIONS:

   Toggle between Elimination, Capture the flag, and Tag.

   Fort Setup:  This lets you design the playing field for the
game.  You can put in or remove the Fire-Drum or the
Teleporters, or any of the starting fortifications.

   Practice will let a player explore with no enemies to contend
with, mostly to teach the player how to play.  Use the ESC
key or space bar to exit from this section.

   Play starts the game, have fun...

   The Save option lets you save the current control panel
state, so when you load the game, you have customized settings.

   Quit will exit the game, darn.

SNOWBALL OPTIONS:

   There are six snowball sizes to set.  You have the options
to individually set them to a Fort-Building snowball, or one of
three types of thrown snowball.  Thrown snowballs either stop
at fortifications, damage fortifications, or go directly over
fortifications.  You can actually ruin the game if you set them
in certain ways, but try it anyway, since you can always change
it back.

PLAYER OPTIONS:

   There are three types of players, as mentioned before: a
human Player, a Snowman, and Death, with death being the most
powerful.  Individual players can either be turned off, set to
joystick control, or set to one of four computer intelligence
levels.  The player's speed can be set to fast, medium and slow.
The team option lets you decide who is on who's side, so you
don't have to kill off players on your side.  Finally, you can set
your number of lives from one to six.  This determines (partly)
the length of the game, and the difficulty level.

   In the demo version, most of the options set in the Control
Panel will be negated when you start to play.  The game will
notify you of this.  The computer players are also notorious
for cheating, since they get infinite lives, and you don't :)

version, which has been sufficiently disabled to let you know
which features you can get by registering for the full game.

   SnowfortDemo and all of it's support files, icons, song, and
short story, are to be distributed intact, unaltered and
present, and in the manner in which I have designed them.

  I am hereby lifting the CD distribution ban for all of my

was declared.  It is another testiment to my generosity!

         ******* TESTING, TESTING, 1,2,3 *******

            (THIS SPACE FOR RENT, maybe not...)

After several months of exhaustive testing on all Amiga models
from an armada of testers, I have determined that all of my
games will work on all Amigas with sufficient memory.  If any
of them don't work, then go into the cli, and type either
"SET CPU" or "RESET VBR" or both, this will fix all previous
loading difficulties.  Thanks to the people who told me that
too :) :D  (Actually, my A3000 uses the 030 chip, and some of
my games were developed with it, so they definately work with
it :).  Also, my stock A1200 runs all of my games perfectly :)

            ******* MISDECLARATIONS... *******

           (XELPOTARTS, XELPOTARTS, XELPOTARTS)

   I would like to fix a few misdeclarations floating around: 

   First of all, SplatterPaint wasn't used for my artwork,
DPaint and Brilliance were my tools for creating them (although
they certainly could have been made with Splatterpaint, but it
would have taken lots longer for me to create them :).

   All of my games work with WB 1.3 (Including Mangled
Fenders, referring to a misprint in one of the adverts in an
England magazine), the culprit there is noted above, that SET
CPU and RESET VBR fix.

   Also, I seem to have a new cellar, as well (a perfectly
harmless, and amusing (in a good way) saying :) :D.

I have also heard that my snow sculptures have melted, well,
that is true :).  My new fleet of snow sculptures goes into
production this winter.  I have done some sand sculptures,
as well as more traditional mediums, like oil paintings :)

     ******* REVOLUTIONARY PRICING STRATEGY *******

    (STRATOPLEX, worth more, same low price, coming soon)

   Here it is!  You can get any 2 disks of my armada of games
for $5 for just 1 disk for $3.  These prices effectively negate
previous declarations (since it might be possible to combine them
with this one and wind up with the entire fleet of games for
something less than I can afford :).  This lets you get 4 disks
for $10, instead of the previous 3 as offered earlier.

   These are the FULL VERSIONS, which are only available
directly from me :).

   Let's see:
1 disk costs $3
2 disks cost $5
3 disks cost $8
4 disks cost $10
etc...

Disk #1) Incinerator and New CheckersConquest
Disk #2) Castle Incinerator and New Conundrum
Disk #3) Mangled Fenders (V1.1)
Disk #4) SplatterPaint Version 1.67 (with some of my artwork)
Disk #5) SNOWFORT
Disk #6) Mangled Fenders: Armored Combat Edition
Disk #7) New CheckersConquest and New Conundrum

   I recommend disks 1, 2, 5, and 6 as a set, since you get
SIX FULL GAMES for $10, instead of the standard $20 for a
single game of the same calibur.  Remember, My games are of
the same, or higher quality than all other games!

   Let's see: 
6/10, or 12/20, Value Quotient for my games.
compared to 1/20, Value Quotient for a fictional other game.

A simple calculator yields that you get twelve times the value
out of my fleet than you can possibly get with this example.

   What if you only like half of them?  Well, you still get a
six times value from me, and even more if you decided
beforehand only to get the ones you like!

Splatterpaint is freely distributible in it's full form, so
spread Splatterpaint around :)

   Let's see:
1/0, Value Quotient for Splatterpaint, this is the highest rating
anyone can ever get!  The Rating is so high, it is undefined by
conventional mathematics.  Remember, only my paint program,
and my checkers game, defy the laws of the Universe!

(Version numbers may increase, which is a good thing)

Mangled Fenders V1.1 has memory conservation code, and will
try to fit the game in available memory by substituting car
graphics (This is also a good thing).

         ******* BLIZZARD or "Lacooni" *******

  Make sure your background is white, if not, change it to
white for viewing of this "lacooni".




































   Now that you have experienced a blizzard, it's time to
continue with the document:)

       ******* AWESOME GAMES BY ME *******

     (STRATOPLEX: Wear a Titanium Helmet for safety)

In 1994, I have developed and released an entire fleet of 5
awesome games.  These games have set new standards in the
games industry.  My games are simply the greatest ever to
exist.  They have the highest quality graphics, gameplay, and
ingenuity that exist only in my games!

   In the last part of this document, I declared cheaper prices
for my games, so I have removed references to cash for full
versions from the descriptions below.  Remember, the only
source for my armada of full versions is directly from me :)

   CONUNDRUM is my abstract hexagon based puzzle board game,
where the object is to negate all of the colored tiles by placing
them next to each other.  This game was inspired by all of
those hexagonal floor tiles you commonly find on bathroom
floors.  Despite the high level of abstraction, Conundrum is
very simple to play, and Conundrum is highly addictive for any
puzzle gamer.

   My awesome original has a new swath of power in the new
version of CONUNDRUM.  It has 20 new bonus round puzzles, as
well as several new "Super Tiles".  Super Tiles enclude a Wipe
Tile to destroy the grey matter, and Super Negator Tiles that
drain color from all of the tiles on the board.  The greatest
enhancement yet is the addition of a second "ready" position, so
you can choose between two different tiles to place on the
board.  The 10 second Death Limit remains as ominous as ever. 
You can also play just the bonus rounds, if you like.  There is
even a cheat mode in this spectacular new game!

   MANGLED FENDERS is my top view, 6 player demo derby game,
where the objective is to destroy all of the other vehicles, by
crashing into them.  There are cash awards to all the players,
depending on the order in which they are destroyed.  There are
different types of vehicles, so you can pick the one that suits
you.  You can even pick multiple cars to one input device, as a
novelty feature.  Both joysticks are supported in Full Version,
as well as continued play.

   The ARMORED COMBAT EDITION of MANGLED FENDERS lets you
stock up on essential ammo and blast your way to victory with
your choice of 6 battle tanks from various countries.  The fire
button releases barrages of powerful munitions against enemy
targets that lie in your path.  This Is True Mangled Fenders
Style!

   INCINERATOR is THE Decisive 3D missile attack/defend game,
where you defend your city from the enemy's missiles and
helicopters, with your laser cannons, forcefields, and super
bombs.  Every other round, you get to pulverize the enemy city,
with missiles of your own.  It supports NTSC/PAL, is hard drive
installable, has high scores, and a secret cheat mode.

   CASTLE INCINERATOR is a graphics rewrite of Incinerator,
with castles instead of cities, and horses instead of missiles.
The graphics are the only real change, but WOW, they are so
awesome.  Well, I have had the chance to improve it a bit more
than that, as I have improved the sounds and gameplay too.
I have made what used to be the helicopter more powerful, as
it can now drain the shields with a special beam.  Actually, the
helicopter is now a giant bird, with flapping wings instead of
rotor blades.  It was fun rewriting the docs for it.  

   It looked silly in text, having to defend a castle from
flatulent horses, with laser wielding mages.  It will be available
from me only, since I am greedy (well, not really :), so it is
another incentive to register with me.

   CHECKERS CONQUEST is a checkers game with lots of
features, and has intelligent computer opponents.  There are
lots of options, including changing the board layout, and showing
possible threatened positions.  There is no demo version of
Checkers Conquest, as the freely distributible version of it is 
available almost anywhere,  another testiment to my generosity.

   The New Version of Checkers Conquest has another level of
computer intelligence, a standard numbered game board, and new
options like Fast play and a new rule option. 

   Gee, let's see, thats one... two... three... four... FIVE games,
all released in 1994, that was a lot of stuff, I should be
exhausted by now, but no!  As you are experiencing first hand,
I have another game, a paint program, and a few of my awesome
originals redesigned and already released!  This brings my fleet
of games up to an awesome armada!

   It is my policy to give at least something to everyone, this
is why Splatterpaint and Checkers Conquest are freely
distributible.  It is also why some games only have minimal
disablement.  I have also given bonus games to my registerers,
since they are the fuel that keep the Incinerplex running.  This
conjures up images of people being sacraficed to volcanoes, oops.

          ******* FUTURE GAMES *******

   (STRATOPLEX: DON'T STARE DIRECTLY INTO THE MONITOR)

   I have played around with several possible new games, even a
standard shoot-em-up, and this is what I have come up with:

STRATOPLEX:  This game, when finished, will be without a doubt
The Greatest Game Ever Conceived In The History Of The
Universe.  The release date for this game is yet to be
announced.  This awesome game uses my exclusive "Embrace The
Adrenaline" Play Sequence and Algorithm, as well as the aesthetic
design principles of "Feng Shuey".

   "Embrace The Adrenaline" refers to my new Play Sequence,
which is also an Algorithm and a Set of Protocols.  When used
in conjunction with the reverse polarity version of the Ambiance
Inhibitor, yielding an Ambiance Spectaculomoplex Matrix that
causes a synaptic overload that creates hours of unadulterated
pure adrenaline pumping through your vital organs.  Also, if 
you stare directly into the monitor, a Psionic Wave Cascade will
sweep through your brain and cause your head to explode, oops.

   Unfortunately, withdrawal from this sensory overload
phenomenon could cause motion sickness, halucinations, or total
neural disruption, resulting in a spontaneous bursting of the
human head, and a possible chain reaction of human head
explosions from the insuing Psionic Wave Cascade.

   Of course, to avert this catastrophe, you should delve
directly into oragami, and stick your tongue slightly out of 
one side of your mouth.  The resulting drooling will ground your
psionic reserves, avoiding the side effects.

   You should also keep your cats or other animals away from
the monitor, causing similiar effects.

   YOU SHOULD NEVER, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, split the
output to two monitors, and face them at each other.  This will
cause a rift in the continuum, and the insuing flux will draw
the entire Universe in on itself.  This may cause a chain
reaction and completely incinerate the entire Omniverse, where
our Universe resides as a seemingly insignifant bubble.  Actually,
it is this reaction that powers the Stratoplex in the first
place.  OOPS, this seems to define a paradox, a conundrum that
will destroy the entire Stratoverse, oh darn.

          ***** SHORT STORY *****

     (Still don't know what STRATOPLEX IS?, darn :)

   Here is a short story I wrote back in 1990, so the plot
might be a bit rusty, and any acronyms of modern events is
purely coincidental (ITO, oops :).

          ** ** ** ** ** ** ** **

   Several Years after the Thrantoxian planetary cloaking device
became operational, and with the completed construction of a
new and much larger fleet of Planet Cruisers, the Thrantoxians
felt they were safe to explore the galaxy.  The entire fleet of
10,000 Planet Cruisers was ready to leave the planet by the
time the Ambiance Inhibitor was fully powered down.  The energy
plasma generators at the planet's poles slowly ceased pumping
energy into the electromagnetic field and the image of the
planet slowly emerged.  The planet of Thrantox 4 was surrounded
by a vast network of hexagonal space station sections, loosely
interconnected by shafts of blue light.  It was this design that
enabled the Ambiance Inhibitors to cloak the planet.

   Immediately, the Planet Cruisers began streaming through the
spaces between the stations.  Once all of the ships were clear
of the planet, the Ambiance Inhibitors started to rebuild the
field that would disguise the planet once again.  The fleet of
Planet Cruisers set their course to the location of the last
battle.  All of the ships powered up their main engines and left
orbit of their planet in three thick waves and exited the star
system.

   After several days of flight, when the constellations
deformed out of recognition, the Thantoxians knew they were
getting close so they started to power down their engines.
 When they arrived at the battle area after a relatively short
journey, they found that all of the ships destroyed in the last
battle had formed sort of a globular asteroid field in the
region that the battle was in.  The Thrantoxians analyzed the
debris and discovered that everything constructed by the enemy
empire had been reduced to globs of radioactive dust.  The
Thrantoxians figured that the enemy empire had sent ships to
the battle area and vaporized anything that could give away the
enemy's technology.  The debris from their own ships was still
largely intact, so they decided to collect spare parts and install
any undamaged weapons they found within the field.

   After the Planet Cruisers were refitted, they powered up
their engines and proceeded to go to the enemy's home planet,
it's location still marked by a thin trail of radioactive dust.
 The planet was still covered with Super Planet Cruisers, but
there was nothing orbiting the planet, and there was very little
activity detected on the planet.  The Thrantoxian fleet sent
several messages to the enemy planet, and none of them
received a reply.  Half of the Planet Cruisers activated their
Ambiance Inhibitors and broke off to explore the neighboring
planets for ambush fleets that could unexpectedly ruin their
efforts to destroy the enemy planet.  The ships analyzed the
other planets and found no signs of activity.  

   The Thrantoxian fleet grew tired of waiting, so they
targeted the enemy ships on the planet, but their laser guidance
systems were compromised by the thick atmosphere. The
Thrantoxians knew they couldn't use their laser weapons, so they
started to bombard the enemy fleet with their arrays of
missiles.  The missiles appeared to be hitting their targets, but
there was no damage.  The Thrantoxians were about to give up
when one of their missiles had detonated in the center of a
region of ships and had destroyed all of the ships in that
region.  Analysis of that region showed that there were large
amounts of radioactive dust in the atmosphere around the
destroyed enemy ships.  The Thrantoxians were confused by this,
so they started a simulation to comprehend this phenomenon.

   The enemy ships didn't respond.  There didn't seem to be
anyone on the entire planet.  There were no defence systems,
and the enemy ships were being destroyed too easily.  They
decided to wait until the simulation was solved.  When it was,
they discovered that there were large deposits of radioactive
metals in the ground located under the centers of the regions
of ships.  This coupled with the atmospheric phenomenon would
produce the effect of magnifying and multiplying the images of
anything sitting on the deposits from an orbital viewpoint.

   The Thrantoxians decided to continue their target practice,
concentrating their efforts on the centers of the regions of
ships.  Soon the planet was blanketed with a thick cloud of
radioactive dust, rendering it uninhabitable.  The fleet that was
sent off to explore had discovered that there was a second,
faint trail of radioactive dust that continued out of the
system in another direction.  They had once again powered up
their engines and decided to follow the trail to whatever lies
ahead.

   After travelling about twice as far as they had come, they
had followed the trail to a system of synthetically constructed
planets.  They immediately cloaked half or their ships for
protection.   There was an asteroid belt here, similar to the
debris field at the battle scene so the Thrantoxians figured
that the enemy fleet was vaporized.  Further analysis of the
asteroid belt showed something very strange.  There was very
large lettering written in the radioactive dust that said
"WELCOME TO THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE INTERGALACTIC TREATY
ORGANIZATION".  The fleet had recieved a message directing them
to land on one of the planets in the system and meet in the
conference room in the largest planet.  After docking their
ships in convienent parking garages burrowed deep into the
synthetic planets, the Thrantoxians took transport ships to the
conference room where they met the leaders of the enemy
empire.  

   The enemy leaders continued to explain how there was a
really large battle between all of the intergalactic empires at
this location, and that the loss of ships was so great that
they could no longer defend their empires.  They continued to
explain how they all got together to build a system of synthetic
planets that would be the Headquarters for the Intergalactic
Treaty Organization.  they also said that they had mistakenly
built their fleet of Super Planet Cruisers out of radioactive
metals that decayed in a few years.

   After a discussion concerning he future of the universe, the
leaders of the enemy empire said that they would send
transport ships to Thrantox 4 to fill them in on the details
and show them around the synthetic star system.  The
Thrantoxians wanted to use their own ships, and this is when
the leader of the enemy empire said that this was all a trick
to destroy the planet of Thrantox and all of it's inhabitants.
They also said that the Thrantoxian Planet Cruisers were
already being destroyed by their own forces.  The conference
room had become a war zone.  The Thrantoxians headed off to
the transport ships and signaled their fleet of the fiasco.

   This is when half of the Thrantoxian fleet emerged from the
asteroid belt where they were waiting to make sure this wasn't
a trap or anything like that.  5,000 Thrantoxian Planet Cruisers
armed to the teeth with lasers and missiles came down on the
planets in gigantic sheet-like formations and blasted away at
the surfaces of the planets.  They destroyed several hundered
enemy Super Planet Cruisers that were streaming out of the
planets, and damaged the surfaces of the planets.  Panels broke
away from the planets revealing natural planets plated with
extensive armor that was designed to make them look
artificially constructed.  

   About a thousand Thrantoxian ships and a few hundered
hijacked transport ships escaped from the parking garages that
looked suspiciously like incinerators.  20,000 enemy Super Planet
Cruisers emerged from the planets firing all of their weapons
at the attacking Planet Cruisers.  The Thrantoxian fleet flew
their ships close to the planet surfaces in their sheet-like
formations that wrapped around the planets. They bombarded the
planets as they fired thick laser volleys at the enemy Super
Planet Cruisers.  The Thrantoxian ships broke out of their
orbits simultaneously and flew in their formations like gigantic
intergalactic knives, splitting up the main mass of the enemy
fleet.  

   The enemy Super Planet Cruisers were picking off the
Thrantoxian ships much faster than the Thrantoxians were
destroying them, so the largest Thrantoxian sheet formation
proceeded to the smallest planet in the system and wrapped
themselves evenly around the planet.  Thin shafts of blue light
slowly started to interconnect the ships.  This is when they
extended their Field Ambiance Inhibitors around the planet making
it disappear.  The rest of the Thrantoxian fleet led the Super
Planet Cruisers on a collision course with the cloaked planet.
The Thrantoxians diverged into a donut formation, with the
planet passing through it's center.  The plan had worked, as
the enemy ships crashed into the planet, thinking that the
Thrantoxians were trying to retreat.

   After the battle, all of the enemy ships were destroyed and
only one quarter of the Thrantoxian ships had survived.  The
Thrantoxians sent their ships home, as they were once again
victorious over a really large enemy empire.
