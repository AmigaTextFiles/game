BabeAnoid v2.0 - Final Release (2003-03-29), full game (Amiga Classic)

So here it is after eight years of work:
The biggest, badest Arkanoid/BreakOut clone known to man!
Take it or leave it, hate it or love it...

If I were to write a full doc or guide covering all features
of BabeAnoid it would take me a whole month! And No-one reads 'em
anyways...well, most people don't.


Most things you need to know is explained in the game, or is ment to
be a learning experience. Here is a point though:

 * Changing the direction of the ball: BabeAnoid does NOT use the classic
   way for this, but rather real physics - Hit the ball with a moving bat
   and you will change its direction accordingly - and increase its speed.
