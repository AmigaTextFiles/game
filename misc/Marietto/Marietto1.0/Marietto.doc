   Introduction
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Simple but original arcade game.


   System requirements
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Any amiga.


   Installation
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Copy all the files from the Marietto directory to any directory of your
   choice (if you delete the Marietto-TopScores file, the top scores table
   will be cleared).


   How to play
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Open a CLI/Shell window, enter the Marietto directory, type in 'Marietto'
   and press the Enter key.
   During the title press the fire button to play, the space bar for
   information or the Esc key to quit the game.

   While playing move the joystick right and left to guide Marietto, move
   the joystick up to fling the bricks (one at a time) and press the fire
   button to kick the enemies. You can also press P to pause the game or Esc
   to stop playing.
   You gain a life every 10,000 pts.

   COINS AND POWER-PILLS: pick up all the coins (500 pts) appearing from
   time to time. Every third coin taken, a power-pill will appear. Swallow
   it (50 pts) and you will become invulnerable for a brief period.

   BOMB: do never hit the bomb with the bricks otherwise you will be killed
   even while you are invulnerable. However, if this should happen, every
   alien on the screen will die and you will gain 50 pts for every one of
   them.

   DAGGERS: the only way to avoid the daggers is to kick them (100 pts),
   except while you are invulnerable, in that case you gain 100 pts by
   simply knocking against them.

   ROCKS: you gain 150 pts if you bump into the rocks while you are
   invelnerable, otherwise you will be killed. You also gain 300 pts if you
   pass below them after they have bounced. You cannot kick them.

   FLYING ALIENS: fling the bricks against the flying aliens to kill them
   (50 pts) save while they are rushing towards the ground, in that case you
   can try to kick them (150 pts) or to knock against them while you are
   invulnerable (150 pts). At a certain stage, they begin to shot. Avoid
   their bullets when you are not invulnerable.

   BOUNCING ALIENS: kick the bouncing aliens or bump into them while you are
   invulnerable to gain 200 pts.

   DRILLS: you can override the drills only while you are invulnerable. You
   cannot kick them.
