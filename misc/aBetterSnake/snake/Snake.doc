                       --INTRODUCTION--

This game is an ESnake-Clone a little but good game I found on
the Aminet.
But in my opinion, ESnake has two disadvantages:

  - the control of the snake let you die when you hit the key
    for the direction towards the actual one.
  - the interface is ugly although it uses GadTools...


To change this, I wrote ABetterSnake which doesn't support the
Iconify-function (senseless?) but the locale library.
In this archive I include catalogs for German and French users.
As you remark, I can't speak English - but that's not too bad...

Good luck, Axel Dörfler!


                        --SOME STUFF--

The snake is controlled by the cursor-keys. The aim of this game
is to have the longest snake.
You reach this by taking the inverted numbers on the field where
your snake is moving around. When you touch one of these numbers
your snake's length grows! (snake-length+10*number)
If you need to much time to get a number, it will hide.
The return key restarts the game (like 'n' in the English
version).
You don't have to know more, actually, you even don't have to
know anything about this game - just play it!

Other keys aren't fix; they are depending on the language you
use!
The record file 'snake.records' is saved in the directory from
which you start the main program. It is saved only when you make
a new record and only at the end of the program!
The actual record is a snake length of 5006.
