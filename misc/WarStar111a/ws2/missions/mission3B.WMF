YOU HAVE BEEN CLEARED BY THE NAVAL ACADEMY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE WAR GAMES
TAKING PLACE IN AND AROUND THE STROMBIN NEBULA.  YOUR OPPONENT IN THESE GAMES
IS A COALITIION HEAVY DESTROYER.  WHEN IT HAS BEEN DESTROYED YOU WILL HAVE WON.
.
IN ADDITION TO THE HEAVY DESTROYER WHICH IS HUNTING YOU THERE ARE ALSO SIX OTHER
SHIPS IN THE AREA.  THREE DESTROYERS (WHICH ARE UNDER ORDERS TO BE HOSTILE IF
YOU APPROACH TOO NEAR) AND THREE CRUISERS.  THEY WILL BE CONCERNED WITH 
TRYING TO HUNT DOWN EACH OTHER SO YOU SHOULD CONCENTRATE PRIMARILY ON THE
HEAVY DESTROYER.
.
PERHAPS MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE OTHER WARSHIPS IS THE ACTUAL NEBULA ITSELF.  MOST
OF THE INTERIOR IS A "BLIND ZONE" WHICH WILL RENDER YOUR SCANNERS AND LONG
RANGE SENSORS INEFFECTIVE FOR COMBAT.  IN ADDITION TO THIS VISUAL IMPARMENT THERE
ARE SEVERAL AREAS AROUND THE NEBULA WERE ASTEROID FIELDS HAVE FORMED AS WELL AS
AT LEAST TWO HIGH RADIATION NEBULAR CLOOUDS.  AVOID TRAVELLING TO NEAR THESE
OBJECTS UNLESS YOU THINK YOU CAN USE IT TO YOUR TACTICAL ADVANTAGE.
.
