THE KHULANI MINISTRY HAS REQUESTED TO SEND A SCIENCE TEAM TO INVESTIGATE THE 
STELLER FILAMENTS LOCATED WITHIN COALITION SPACE NEAR THE XYNTAAN BORDER.
THEY HAVE AGREED TO SEND THE SHIP WITHOUT ESCORT AND WE MUST THEREFORE MAKE SURE
THAT IT IS PROTECTED.  YOU HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH ESCORTING THE SHIP TO ITS
DESTINATION.  USE EXTREME FORCE TO DEFEND THIS SHIP AS IT WOULD BE TAKEN VERY
SERIOUSLY BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF BOTH THE KHULANI AND THE COALITION IF ANYTHING
SHOULD HAPPEN TO IT.

THE KHULANI VESSEL IS A CONVERTED DESTROYER WITH MINIMAL ARMAMENTS.  IT ENTERED
COALLITION SPACE ONLY A FEW MINUTES AGO AND IS CURRENTLY AT COORDINATES
(-19000/-23000).  THE PHENOMINON IT IS TO INVESTIGATE IS AT COORDINATES (18000/
-14000).
.
THERE ARE SEVERAL HIGHLY ENERGETIC NEBULAS IN THE AREA AND THEY MAY INTERFERE
WITH YOUR SENSOR FUNCTIONS AND PROVIDE POSSIBLE COVER FOR HOSTILE SHIPS.
.
.
END TRANSMISSION.
