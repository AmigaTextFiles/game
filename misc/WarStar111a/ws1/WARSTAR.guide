@{b}ABOUT@{ub}

WARSTAR is a cross between an arcade style shoot-em-up and a simulator.
While the brunt of the game involves shooting at the opponent, in order to
win you have to master the various functions of your ship, from routing
power to the various onboard systems to assigning repair crews to deal with
battle damage. As well, Warstar incorporates a degree of stategy to the
battle. Fast reflexes won't get you as far as a well thought out plan of
attack and a thorough knowledge of your ship.

@{b}REGISTRATION@{ub}

This version of warstar can only load the missions which have been included
with the original archive. The Registered version is capable of loading
other missions, which will be released at the rate of about a dozen a month.
As well, registered users may receive the MISSION EDITOR (when I make it a
little more easier to use) by giving me their Internet address, or sending
me a disk and return postage (remember this is coming from Canada).

To register send a cheque or money order worth $15 Canadian Dollars to:

@{fg shine}Tyson Zwicker, 117 Archerhill Court, Fort Mc Murray, Alberta, T9J-1C8,
CANADA@{fg text}

If you include your internet address you will receive it the day I receive
the letter. It will arrive in UU encoded format so you'll need a UU decoder
to  "descramble" the code. If this doesn't sound like your cup of tea, stick
to the snail-mail. DON'T FORGET THE RETURN ADDRESS!!

@{b}HD INSTALLATION@{ub}

Installing Warstar on your hard drive is should be a snap

1.  Create a drawer called WS1 2.  Create a drawer called WS2 3.  Create a
drawer called WS3 4.  Copy DISK ONE (named WS1) to the WS1 drawer on the HD.
5.  Copy DISK TWO (named WS2) to the WS2 drawer on the HD. 6.  Copy DISK
THREE (named WS3) to the WS3 drawer on the HD. 7.  Append the following two
lines to your Startup-sequence (1.3 users) or
    your User-Startup (for 2.0 and above).

    ASSIGN WS1: XXX
    ASSIGN WS2: YYY
    ASSIGN WS3: ZZZ Where XXX is the path name to the drawer WS1 on your
hard drive.  Example:

                ASSIGN WS1: DH0:GAMES/WS1

and where YYY is the path name to the drawer WS2 on your hard drive.
Example:

                ASSIGN WS2: DH0:GAMES/WS2

and finally ZZZ is the path name to the drawer WS3 on you HD.  Example:

                ASSIGN WS3: DH0:GAMES/WS3

User with a good understanding on CLI may wish to create a script that
accomplishes the same task without altering the Startup-Sequence.

When the 5 steps are finished, your ready to play!

WARNING:  If your FONTS: directory contains more than 5000 different font/
size combinations WARSTAR may not find the fonts it needs.  In order to make
WARSTAR run on such as system you must open a CLI or SHELL window and type
the following:

                ASSIGN FONTS:  WS1:FONTS

This will cause the computer to look at the font directory included with
your  WARSTAR disks rather than your normal font directory.  When your
finished type

                ASSIGN FONTS:  SYS:FONTS

to use your normal font directory again.

Note this step only needs to done if you have a really big FONTS: directory.
If the font problem does occur, it will cause the screen to stay blank for
anywere upto two minutes (depending on the speed of you  processor and
HD/Floppy).  It will then notify you that it cannot find one of the fonts it
wants.

@{b}HOW TO RUN WARSTAR@{ub}

@{b}FLOPPY USERS:@{ub}

If you have 2 drives, insert both disks.  If you have a single drive system
then insert the DISK ONE (WS1:).   Double click to open the disk, then
double click on the WARSTAR icon.  The game should then load and run.

If you wish to run it from CLI, simply type WS1:WARSTAR, and the game will
load.

@{b}HARD DRIVE USERS:@{ub}

Assuming you've followed the Hard Drive Installation procedures outlined in
this manual, all you need to do is go to the WS1 drawer and double click the
WARSTAR icon.  The game should then load and be running withing a few
seconds.
@endnode

@node "How_To_Play" "How To Play"
@{b}HOW TO PLAY WARSTAR@{ub}

When Warstar has loaded it will display its title screen.  To proceed past
this screen press either mouse button.  This will bring you to the mission
selection screen.  There should be a list of thirty missions (or more if you
or someone else has used the included Mission Edittor to create new
missions).

To play a mission, move the mouse overtop of the one you want and click the
left mouse button.  The mission will then load and a breif mission overview
will appear on your screen, usually with instructions on how to finish the
mission.  When you have read these click anywhere on the screen with either
mouse button and you will be deposited directly into the game.

For more specific instructions on how to control the ship refer to the
various HOW TO sections.
@endnode

@node "How_To_See" "How To See"
@{b}HOW TO SEE:  THE SENSOR/SCANNER SYSTEMS@{ub}

The most common method of surveying surrounding space is by using the main
view screen (below the control panel).  The range of this viewer can be
altered allowing you to "zoom" in and out, though the centre of the screen
will always be your ship.

To change the range of the main view screen, use the IN and OUT buttons,
located around the center of the control panel.  The numbers located at the
ends of the cross hairs on the view screen will change, showning you how far
you are seeing.  The view screen can be "zoomed out" a magnitude of 15
times, providing sufficient long range viewing for most situations.

The two red numbers at the top of the view screen display your coordinates,
in the usual X,Y format.  Moving in the direction of the top of your screen
will cause the Y coordinate to decrease, while moving towards the bottom of
the screen will cause the Y coordinate to increase.  Likewise, moving toward
the left of the screen will cause the X coordinate to decrease while moving
toward the right side of the screen will increase the X coordinate.

Below the OUT button is a button labelled SCAN.  This button activates the
scanner, which can be used to find out information about other objects. To
use the Scanner, press the SCAN button (which temporarlily freezes the game)
then click on any object on the main viewer.  A small screen will  pop up at
the the bottom of the viewer.  It will continue to monitor the object and
give you information on it until you cancel the SCAN function by pressing
the SCAN button again.

The Scanner can provide three distinct types of information.  The first is
Navigation Data, dealing with the objects velocity, heading, range and
bearing.  The second is Tactical Offensive Data, which deals with the
weapons systems of the object (if it has any) and their state of readiness.
The third scan type is a Tactical Defensive Data which details the state of
the objects shields (if any) and hull (if any).

@{b}THE SCANNER CONTROL SCREEN@{ub}

The controls for the scanner and various other sensor functions can be
accessed by pressing the SET button (below the IN button).  This will bring
you to the SENSOR CONTROL screen.  The top row of buttons on the right side
of the screen allow you to select between the three scan types detailed
above.  The second row allows you to change the function of the IN and OUT
buttons:

        Slow Linear-Causes the IN and OUT buttons to change the viewers
range by an magnitude of 1.

        Fast Linear-Causes the IN and OUT buttons to change the viewers
range by a magnitude of 2.

        Exponential-Causes the IN and OUT buttons to alter the magntiude
exponentially, that is doubling it or halving it (as                     in
a change from a magnitude of 1,2,4,8, and then                     16)

Below that are three buttons which can be used in conjunction with the
extended range sensors.  The extended range sensors (activated by the row of
large buttons at the bottom right of the screen) must be active for these
functions to work:

        FULL SCAN - Lists all available data on an the current object.

        COURSE PROJECTION - Overlays the projected course of the current
object on the extended range sensor screen.

        INTERFERENCE SCAN - Highlights regions of space which cannot be
penetrated by the scanners and sensors due                             some
steller phenominon.

The next row of buttons, NEXT and PREVIOUS, allow you to cycle through all
the objects.  As with the above buttons, the extended range sensors must be
active.  Note that the current object will have a box around it.  These
buttons are used in conjunction with the last row to get details about  the
correct object.

Lastly, the extended range sensor buttons are the large buttons on the
bottom row.  They allow you to see for a much greater distance than the
viewer can accomidate.  Unfortunately they lack the level of information
conveyed by the main view screen, and are therefore only used to locate
objects far away.

While you are on this screen the game is paused.

To return to the main control panel press the HELM button.
@endnode

@node "How_To_Maneuver" "How To Maneuver"
@{b}HOW TO MANUEVER:  THE HELM CONTROLS@{ub}

The main screen will always be centered on your ship.  This means that even
at top speed, your ship will appear not to move.  The stars in the
background, however, will be moving in the direction opposite your heading.
The faster you go, the faster the stars appear to be moving.

Likewise with other objects.  If you see a clump of asteroids creeping
slowly across the screen, chances are its you that's moving, not the
asteroids.  The asteroids only appeared to be moving because you are moving
relative to them. If all this sounds a bit confusing, don't worry, you'll
get the hang of it  once you start playing.

Your ship always heads in the direction it is pointing.  To turn your ship,
locate the NAVIGATION buttons on the left hand side of the control panel.
Turning is accomplished by useing the:                  Hard Port Button -
Spins your ship left many degrees.  At lower speeds
the turn produced by using a HARD turn is the same
as that produced with a normal turn (see PORT and
STARBOARD buttons below).  At high speeds the HARD
turns produce significantly tighter turns.  Because
the engines have to be overloaded to produce these
turns, HARD turns sometimes cause engine damage as
well as a steady amount of hull stress which can
become a danger at higher speeds.

        Port Button - Turns the ship 10 degrees to the left.  No damage
occurs from the use of this button.

        Starboard Button - Turns the ship 10 degrees to the right.  As with
the port button, no damage is incurred.

        Hard Starboard Button - Spins the ship right many degrees.  As with
the Hard Port Spin, this can cause damage                                 to
the ships hull and impulse engine.

At higher speeds you will notice these buttons becoming less responsive.
This is due to the higher turning radius required at high speeds.  Using the
HARD turns, the usual tight turns are possible, but using the normal PORT
and  STARBOARD buttons at high speeds will produce the slower, wide turn.

Directly below these buttons are the Drive control buttons.  There are two
forms of propulsion used on your ship.  The first, the Impulse Drive, is the
more commonly used.  It is controlled by either increasing or decreasing its
thrust.  The Velocity being attained by your ship is displayed by the bar at
the far left of the control panel.  It is important to remember that your
impulse drive is capable of burning itself out.  During normal operations
you should not exceed a speed of 8 units.  Anything above this limit will
cause the engine to slowly begin overheating.  The faster you go, the faster
the engine will overheat.  The heat can be monitored in the ENGINEERING
section.  As well, when the engine has reached 90% heat tolerance, a warning
will begin to flash beside impulse drive's control buttons.

The Impulse Engine can also be used to generate power, which is handy when
you've sustained damage to the reactors and auxillary reactors, or when you
just need a lot of power.  Tapping the impulse engine is done from
ENGINEERING and more detailed instructions for this procedure are included
in the ENGINEERING instructions. 

The second for of propulsion is the JUMP drive.  It causes the ship to Jump
into Hyperspace, where it attains speeds that would give Einstein a major
case of indigestion.  The JUMP drive requires a tremendous amount of energy
to operate.  Before it can be used the ships Batteries (see ENGINEERING)
must be charged to full power.  When activated there is a bright flash, and
the next thing you know you've travelled a distance that would have taken
hours using the impulse drive.  This method of travel is not really pratical
in battle situations as you are required to shut down all high energy
systems (such as  Shields and Weapons systems) before the JUMP drive will
engage.  Note:  Very long distance journeys may require several jumps.

        JUMP - This button activates the JUMP drive, which sends your ship
a very long distance in which ever direction the ship is
pointing when you pressed the button.  

        INC - This button increases the amount of thrust being emitted by
the impulse engine.  It may be limited by damage or by a               power
tap (see ENGINEERING) placed on the engine.  You can hold               this
button down if you wish for increases of more than 1 unit.

        DEC - This button decreases the amount of thrust being emitted by
the impulse engine.  As with the INC button, this button can be
held down for large reductions in speed.

        Full Stop - This button will cause the ship to come to a complete
stop much more quickly than using the DEC button.  Its
affect is more noticable at high speeds.

@node "How_To_Fight" "How To Fight"
@{b}HOW TO FIGHT:  THE TACTICAL SYSTEM@{ub}

@{b}TACTICAL SYSTEMS OVERVIEW@{ub}

Your ship is equipped with several systems which allow it to carry out its
role as an enforcer of the Coallition's wishes.  Four independant variable
rate high-capacity shields generators provide protection for your ship (to
an extent) while a variable-capacity meson emitter and four high yield
torpedoe tubes allow your ship to inflict damage on anything that threatens
its well-being.

The first order of business in any fight, no matter what, is SHIELDS.
Without them, the only thing standing between you and cold airless space are
the thin and relatively weak walls of your ships hull.  Shields can absorb
tremendous punishment, far more than you ship ever could.

There are four shields around your ship.  One for the front (SHIELD #1), one
for the right hand side (SHIELD #2), one gaurding the aft (SHIELD #3) and
one for the left side (SHIELD #4).  They work independantly of each other.
This means that if your foreward shield has taken a beating and looks about
ready to fail all together, you can turn your ship and expose the undamaged
right or left side shields to the enemies weapons, giving your foreward
shield time to regenerate.

All shields regerenate at the same rate, but not all the shields are equally
as strong.  Your forward shield is roughly twice as powerful as your rear
shield, while the two side shields are about 2/3 the strength of the forward
shield. A shields rate of regeneration may drop if the shield generator
sustains damage (see DAMAGE CONTROL).

The shield emitters have two modes: Nominal and High Output.  Nominal mode
is the standard shield setting.  It provides a high degree of protection and
only consumes 2 Megawatts of energy.  The High Output mode causes the
shields to regenerate twice as fast, but the energy requirement trade off is
very bad: twice the regereration of three times the energy cost, which can
often be to much for even a lightly damaged ship to handle.

The meson emitter allows you to channel a highly focused, extremely high
amplitude wave of electomagnetic energy at your opponent.  The exact
strength of this beam will depend on two things.  First, your distance from
the target has a large affect on the amount of damage the beam will do.  The
closer the target, the more the damage.  The second factor is directly
controlled by you. It is the weapon's yield setting, which can be set from 0
(turning off the meson cannon) to 16 (Maximum power) and anywhere in
betweeen.

The meson cannon draws its power from a high capacity battery bank.  When
the level of power in the meson bank matches the weapons yield setting, the
cannon is able to fire.  If if the bank does not contain enough power, the
cannon will not fire.  This allows you to make frequent, low power shots at
smaller targets, or save up all the energy for less frequent, more powerful
bursts. The Meson cannon can fire in any of 360 degrees, making it an
excellent weapon for close-in fighting.

After the meson and shield systems is the torpedoe system.  There are four
tubes on your ship.  Each can fire a single antimatter/matter torpedoe which
detonates upon reaching its target coordinates releasing a great deal damage
(much more than even a full power meson cannon shot).  This damage is spread
over a wide area, allowing more than one target to be damaged by the same
detonation.  It also means that firing torpedoes at targets near the ship is
a bad idea, as it can also cause damage to your own ship.

Unlike the Meson cannon, which operates off the ships power grid and can be
used many times, there is a limit to the number of torpedoes your ship can
carry.  In most cases, that limit will be 16, so don't go crazy with them,
save them for when you really need them.

@{b}SHIELD OPERATION@{ub}

The shields can be activated by pressing SHIELDS button on the right side of
the control panel.  As long as enough power is supplied to them, they should
all begin to regenerate.  The level of each sheild is shown in the bars
surrounding the SHIELDS button.  When they are first activated they will be
in nominal mode.  To bring them into high-capacity mode, you must click on
the display bar of the shield you wish to alter.  In high-capacity mode, a
blinking box will appear around the display bar of that shield.  To change
it back to  nominal mode press on the bar again, and the blinking box should
be replaced by a solid yellow one. To deactivate the shields simply press
the SHIELD button again.

@{b}THE TORPEDOE SYSTEM CONTROLS@{ub}

he meson cannon controls are located just to the left of the Shield systems
controls along the bottom of the panel.  They can be activated by pressing
the button which, when undamaged, should read "TORPEDOE SYSTEMS READY".

When this button is pressed the four indicators the right of the button
should turn from blue (OFF) to red (ARMING).  It takes about a minute for
the torpedoes to load.  Once they are loaded the indicators should change to
green (READY). To fire a torpedoe, place the mouse over the location you
want to the torpedoe to detonate at (on the main view screen) and press the
left mouse button. As the torpedoe is launched it's indicator will become
amber (IN FLIGHT).

Note that each of the torpedoe tubes acts independantly of the other.  You
may launch them singly or in a volley.

Unlike the meson cannon, the torpedoes cannot be fired in any direction. The
target coordinates must lay within a 30 degree arc of the ships current
heading in order for the the launch to occur, though once the torpedoe is in
flight you may alter your course in any way you like.

@{b}MESON CANNON SYSTEM OPERATIONS@{ub}

Directly above the torpedoe control systems are the meson cannon controls.
They consist of two bars.  The top bar show the amount of energy stored in
the cannons bank, while the bottom bar is weapon yield control.  To activate
the cannon you just set the yield to one or higher, by clicking inside the
yield bar.  The further right along the bar you click, the higher the yield.
The cannon is ready to fire when the energy displayed in the top bar is
equal to or greater than the yield shown on the bottom bar.

To fire the cannon, place the mouse over the target (on the main view
screen) and press the right mouse button.  Note that after firing the energy
level of the bank drops by same amount as the yield setting.

@{b}FLIGHT MODE AUTOMATION@{ub}

Of course, if you are suddenly confronted by an emergency situation where
you need all of your tactical systems activated immediately, the quickest
way to do that is by changeing your flight mode.  There are two flight
modes:  the  first, CRUISE, is the standard mode of operation.  The second,
RED ALERT, automatically places all defensive and offensive systems on-line.
As well, going to red alert brings the ships auxillary reactors on-line,
providing extra power to supply the sudden energy demands caused by all
three systems going on at once (see ENGINEERING).

Flight mode can be toggled between CRUISE and RED ALERT by pressing the
FLIGHT MODE button located between the SCAN and SET buttons in the sensor
control area of the control panel.
@endnode

@node "How_To_Fix" "How To Fix"
@{b}HOW_TO_FIX@{ub}

Your ship has eight repair crews.  These crews can fix almost anything that
should go wrong in any of the 28 systems, as well as repair hull damage. The
repair crews can be assigned to repair damage by entered the DAMAGE CONTROL
screen.  This screen is accessed by pressing the button of the same name in
the upper right side of HELM/TACTICAL (Main) control panel.

The DAMAGE CONTROL screen is arranged with all the ships systems listed at
the left of the screen, and the repair crews listed on the right.  By
clicking on the repair crews, you can cycle through the systems until you
reach the one you want fixed.  Notice that the repair crew appears to move
up and down on the left hand side of the screen, as well as display its
current system on the right.

Using the left mouse moves the repair crew up the list.  The right mouse
button moves the repair crew down the list.  Assigning more than one repair
crew to a single system _will_ speed up repairs (good to remember when life
support systems take a direct hit).

The status of the systems can be determined by the colour of the system as
it appears in the left hand list.  Green means the system is on-line.  Amber
shows light damage to the system, while red shows heavier damage.  If the
system is  shown blinking, there is a POWER FAILURE in that system.   Power
Failures are  discussed at length in the ENGINEERING section.
@endnode

@node "Troubleshooting" "Troubleshooting"
@{b}WHAT WRONG WITH...:  RECOGNIZING SYSTEM FAILURES AND POWER SHORTAGES@{ub}

In most cases failure of a system is accompanied by both an error sound and
a failure of that system to perform its funtion.  As well, some systems
indicate damage by changing their activation buttons appearance.  In all
cases, the  problems can be diagnosed directly from the DAMAGE CONTROL
screen.  This can be accessed by pressing the button in the upper right of
the control panel by the same label.

However, because it is tedious to always check in damage control first, and
because it isn't listed anywhere else, here is a list of all the ships 28
systems, including what they do and how to recognize if they aren't
working.

NOTE:  "DAMAGE" refers to physical damage caused to a system.  It has the
        same affect as a "POWER FAILURE", but the two are different in both
cause and treatment.  If a system shows no damage but is offline, it
is probably experiencing a power failure.  Power failures are explained
in detail in ENGINEERING. 

Your ship has 28 different "Systems" all responsible for various vital oper-
ations.  They are (with symptoms):

        1..View Screen: Damage to this system causes the main viewer to
display either a blank screen or flickering bars
showing the actual view only in infrequent flashes.

        2..Viewer Range Changing:  This system controls the sensor
calibration
                        software and hardware responsible for changing the
range of the sensors.  Damage causes a failure to
respond in both the IN and OUT buttons on the main
control panel.                  3..Extended Mode Sensors:  This systems is
is responsible for all                          extended range scanning
functions. Damage to this                         system will cause the
Short and Long range scanners                         to fail.

        4..Scanners:  This system is responsible for all scanning
functions,
                        including Maser Cannnon targetting and active scan
window.  Damage is signalled by a change in the SCAN
buttons appearence, as well as failure of the SCAN
function.  It may cause Meson cannon misses as well.

        5..Scanner Range:  The energy regulator responisble for feeding the
                        scanning system was so frequently the cause of
scanner                         failure in earlier ships that it has become
a system                         in its own right.  Failure of this system
causes the                         scanning systems to work within a
diminished radius of                         the ship.

        6..Meson Cannon:  This incorporates both the battery Bank and the
actual emitter.  Failure of this system will cause the
yield and bank to fall to zero.  It will not be
possible to raise the yield above 0 until the damage
is repaired.

        7..Torpedoes:  The torpedoe system can be damaged in numerous ways
and
                        is one of the slower systems to repair.  Failure in
this system causes the indicators of the individual
tubes and the activation button to go to "off-line"
Torpedoes inflight may explode or simply dissappear.

        8..Impulse Engine:  This system can be damaged to varying degrees.
It
                        is one of the more slowly repaired systems, as it
accumilates damage more extensively due to its
relatively fragile fusion components.

        9..Jump Drive:  A good hit to this system will cause irreparable
damage
                        The nature of the JUMP engine prevents ship board
manufacturing to replace its components.  If this system
goes off-line the button to activate it will go to
"off-line" status.

        10..Shield Generator 1..Responsible for running the forward shield
array,
                        damage to this system causes sporatic shield
failure,                         resulting in a momentary lack of
regeneration in the                         forward shield.  Two successive
hits to the shield could                         easily penetrate to the
hull and do series internal                         damage.  It can only be
diagnosed by observation (the
                        shield's status bar will stop climbing toward
maximum)                         or by going to the DAMAGE CONTROL SCREEN.

        11..Shield Generator 2:  As above, but for the starboard (right)
shield.

        12..Shield Generator 3:  As above, for the aft (rear) shield.

        13..Shield Generator 4:  As above, for the port (left) shield.

        14..Reactor 1:  The reactor is the ships primary power source.
Failure
                        of these systems is the most frequent cause of any
system power failure.  They can be damaged completely,
or in part.  A good hit to a reactor will shut it down
for good.  Clues that a reactor has been hit are
non-damage related system failures, or the reactor
output meters in ENGINEERING.

        15..Reactor 2                   16..Reactor 3

        17..Reactor 4                  18..Reactor 5
19..Reactor 6

        20..Auxillary Power Reactor 1:  These systems can be used to
supplement
                        the main power supply during crisis situations,
although both APR1 and APR2 together generate only 2/3
of a main reactors output.  Failure may be surmised by
directly observing the damage in ENGINEERING, or by
                        noticing system failure not due to damage.

        21..Auxillary Power Reactor 2:

        22..Auxillary Impulse Engine:  This system can only be accessed
through
                        engineering.  It is capable of producing 4 units of
thrust.  Damage can be read from the output meter in
ENGINEERING.

        23..Batteries:  This systems stores the tremendous power needed to
run
                        the JUMP drive.  If the JUMP drive goes offline or
the indicator in ENGINEERING shows no "rate" and a
dropping charge level, chances are its damaged or
expereincing a powr failure.

        24..LIFE SUPPORT:  The most important system on the entire ship,.
Though
                        some Captains have been known to shut them off for
short periods to divert the power to shields or weapons
systems.  Failure in this systems causes death to crew
memebers in less than 2 minutes.  It is indicated by
                        the large red flashing "LIFE SUPPORT FAILURE"
warning                         which appears on the main viewer.  It will
appear even                         if the main viewer is not functioning
properly.

        25..SIF (Structural Integrity Field):  The SIF is a systems of
active
                        re-enforcements which compensate for the incredible
stresses incurred by the ships manuevering.  Any Hard
Turns or Full Stops while this system is out will
cause extensive hull damage.  Normal manuevers may incur
                        slight damage as well.  SIF failure can be seen only
by using the DAMAGE CONTROL panel. 

        26..Helm Control (CONN):  This system controls the ships manuevers
(turns).
                        Failure in this system is indicated when the buttons
turn unreadable on the screen.

        27..Drive Control Functions (IPD CONN):  This system controls the
thrust
                        produced by the Impulse Propulsion Drive.  Failure
causes                         they INC, DEC and FULLSTOP buttons not
respond.  Damage                         can also be displayed at the right
of the buttons where                         it usually says "HELM ONLINE".

Your ship's systems need energy to function.  All energy production
facilities fall under the ENGINEERING heading, as does power distribution.

There are 6 Main Reactors which, under normal CRUISE mode, supply 100% of
the power to the ships systems.  They produce 6 Megawatts of power per 1/5
second (6 MW per 1/5s) each for a total of 36 Megawatts per 1/5 second (36MW
per1/5s).

During crisis situations when defence systems have been brought on-line, it
is standard procedure to activate the 2 APR's (AUXILLARY POWER REACTORS).
These smaller back-up reactors supply 2 MW per 1/5s each, for a total of 4
MW per 1/5s.  Though it is a small amount in comparison to the main
reactors, there are many situations where power demands made by shield
fluctuations can cause total system load to exceed 36 MW per 1/5s.

All reactors are shown in Engineering along the left hand bar in the center
of the screen.  To the left of the reactor displays are a series of large
and small bars.  The small bar to the left of a reactors display icon show
the CHARGE of the reactor.  CHARGE is bad.  When the CHARGE reaches maximum
the computer will override the system and shut it down.  The CHARGE of a
reactor can be reduced by leaving as many reactors as possible off-line
during CRUISE mode flight, and allowing the reactors to "take turns"
powering the ships systems.

Reactors can be brought on and off-line by pressing on their individual
icons located on the left-most of the two bars at the center of the screen.
If the icon changes to amber, that means that the reactor is off-line due to
charge.

The larger bar (under the CHARGE bar) shows the power output of the reactor.
If undamaged and on-line, the power output should be 100% (the bar should
appear solid green).  If damaged, a portion of the bar will blink.  When
off- line the bar will appear solid red.

NOTE:  APR's have a much shorter CHARGE time then the main reactors and
therefore cannot be left active for too long.

In addition to the reactors, there is one other energy production facility
onboard the ship.  The IMPULSE PROPULSION DRIVE (IPD) is actually nothing
more than a series of fusion breeders linked to a magnetic expulsion coil.
It is therefore possible to tap power from the IPD to feed other systems.
The IPD system is located beneath the APR's on the left side of the screen.
By pressing the TAP button, you can bleed energy away from the IPD's Fusion
units and into the ships other systems.

The Bars to the left of the TAP button show the status of the IPD.  The
smaller bar shows the heat level of the IPD.  If the heat level reaches the
maximum  position shown on the bar the FUSION units sustain damage, which
can cause  drastic reductions your IPD system's power output.  It is
important to note that ANY power usage of the IPD over 8 units, either by
going faster than 8 units, or by tapping more than 8 units, or a combination
of both, causes heat accumilation.  The harder the IPD is worked, the hotter
it gets.  Heat can be reduced by bringing power consumption from the system
below 8 units.

The larger bar shows the power usage of the system.  Blue denotes unused
power. Green shows the amount of power been vented by the IPD to produce
thrust to move the ship.  Amber denotes power being bled off by the TAP.
Blinking red shows damage to the IPD system (see DAMAGE CONTROL).

Below the tap is the Auxillary Impulse Drive.  This is a smaller version of
the main IPD.  It cannot be used to TAP energy, but it can produce a small
amount of thrust, which can be used together with the main IPD to increase
speed. The smaller bar to the left of the Auxillary Impulse Drive icon shows
the heat level.  The AID heats up much faster than the IPD.  Pressing the
icon will  increase the thrust to the maximum of 4 units.  Pressing it
beyond this will  bring it back to zero units again.


On the right side of the screen there are two displays.  The upper one shows
the power production over view.  UNUSED shows power which could be tapped
but isn't (reactors off-line and unused IPD tap power).  REACTOR shows the
amount of power being generated the 6 main reactors.  APR shows the power
from the Auxillary Power Reactors and IPD TAP shows the power being drawn
from the  IPD.

Below this display is the power distrubution display.  All systems which
draw power from the ships power network are shown here, by PRIORITY.  The
left most (its "tag" appears lowest down on the screen) system has the
highest priority while the right most has the least.  The amount of space
taken by that system on the bar shows how much power it is consuming when
compared with the total power demand of all systems.  The color of the
system shows its power status. Green shows that the system is receiving
enough power, while amber shows a  power failure in that system.  When this
occurs you must either produce more power (by activating APR's or TAPPING
the IPD) or you must lower the power demands being made on the system. There
are times in battle when neither is an option, thats were PRIORITY comes
in.

The PRIORITY can be changed by clicking on the systems BAR (not its
labelling TAG) and then doing the same for another system.  The two systems
you selected will then change positions of the PRIORITY list.  By doing this
you can allow certain systems to experience power failures while giving
other more important systems the power they need to function.

It also allows you to squeeze a little more power out of the ship, but doing
so can be dangerous.  For Example:  Several captains have reported placing
there ships life support system at the bottom of the priority list just so
they could gain that one extra unit of power they needed to arm a torpedoe
or re-enforce a shield.  If timed correctly, power can be re-diverted back
to the life support system just before a failure occurs, if timed
incorrectly, the entire crew will suffocate!

At the bottom of the left hand side is the FUEL bar.  All energy production
uses fuel, wether it be energy in the power net or thrust from an engine.
Reactors are the most fuel efficient units, producing 1 unit of energy for
every unit of fuel.  The impulse engine is twice as inefficient, burning 2
units of fuel for every 1 unit of velocity (or power if tapped).  the
Auxillary impulse engine is the most fuel inefficient energy producer on the
ship. It burns 4 units of fuel per unit of velocity produced.  Because of
this, for  long trips, it is most fuel efficient to make use of the JUMP
drive (because it can use the cheap energy produced by the reactors).

@{b}Xyntaan Ships@{ub}

We know little about the Xytaan, save what we have learned from the Khulani
and from examining a few captured Xyntaan ships.  Biologically the Xytaan
resemble large spiders, but with endoskeletons instead of exoskeletons.
There  technology is very curious.  Some of the systems used in Xyntaan
ships are centuries more advanced than our own, but all of there advanced
systems are wired together in a make-shift fashion.

This has lead to speculation that the Xyntaan have aquired their technology
not through scientific pursuits, but by forcefully taking it from those who
had already figured it out.  In many cases it appears as though they didn't
get instructions along with the technology, for the devices they employ are
usually only used to a fraction of their potential.  Others argue that the
construction of the ships is based on a philosophy much different than our
own, and that the ships were designed like that on purpose.

Xyntaan ships are usually slightly slower than Human ships, but they possess
weapons and defensive systems that fairly match our own.

There are several different classes of Xyntaan warship ranging from the
large Battle Ships to the small Scout ships, with several types in between.
There have been reports of an even larger Xyntaan ship, which has been given
the  tentative designation "Dreadnought".  Little is known about these
vessels as all encounters with them have resulted in total and very quick
destruction of the observing ships.

@{b}KHULANI VESSELS@{ub}

While a treaty does exist allowing a certain number of Khulani warships to
enter Human Territory (to shorten travel time to systems which lay on the
other side of Human Space.  They are infrequently seen.  They can be
expected to ignore your ship completely, but do occasionally respond to
distress calls from human ships.

Most Khulani ships are much slower than their human counterparts.  They also
carry much advanced shield generators, which makes up for the lack of speed
in their ships.  While Khulani vessels are usually armed about as heavily as
their human counterparts, there advanced shields make them, in general, a
lot tougher in a fight.  Fortunately we have been at peace with the Khulani
since the first contact over fifty years ago.

This is the first version of Warstar.  There is no doubt in my mind that it
has bugs I never noticed during its somewhat brief playtesting period.  If
you are REGISTERED, and you find a bug please report it to:

   @{fg shine}viking@freenet.edmonton.ab.ca@{fg text}

And we will send you a "fixed" version the minute the bug is tracked down
and squashed (the version you receive will also have fixes for bugs that
others  noticed).  All files sent over the internet will be UU encoded, so
you'll need to track down a UU decoder (not difficult).

If you don't have internet access, write to:

@{b}NEW FEATURES IN WARSTAR 1.1@{ub}

-Key Input:  The arrow keys can now be used to control some of the helm
functions:

        UP ARROW:  INCREASE VELOCITY (SAME AS INC BUTTON)         DOWN
ARROW:  DECREASE VELOCITY (SAME AS DEC BUTTON)         LEFT ARROW:  TURN
COUNTER CLOCKWISE 10 DEGRESS         RIGHT ARROW:  TURN CLOCKWISE 10
DEGREES

-Tracking Beacon:  This is option is available from the sensor control
screen.  Use the NEXT and PREVIOUS buttons to select the object you wish to
track, then press the TRACK OBJECT button beside the HELM button.  The
object selected will have a red square around it (you must be in one of the
extended sensor modes to do this).

Once activated the beacon will flash on the main view screen in the
direction you must travel to reach the object being tracked.  When far away
(over 2000 units) the beacon is blue/green.  When within 2000 units (but not
too close) it is green/yellow. When the distance is very close (under 300
units) the beacon will be yellow/red.

The beacon can be deactivated by clicking on the TRACK OBJECT button a
second time. It can be reassigned by first shutting it off, then using the
NEXT and PREVIOUS  buttons to select a new object.  Pressing the TRACK
OBJECT button again will select the new object.

-Emittions scans:  This sensor option will now overlay not only "blind
zones" were sensors are ineffective, but also any areas of space affected by
a Steller Object. The range of effect is indicated by a red circle around
the object.  As before, the extended range sensors must be active for this
option to work.

-Steller Objects:  These now have affects ranging from the mildly annoying
(like  sensor interference) to the outright dangerous (strong gravity or
radiation).  A FULL SCAN should be performed on any steller object before
approaching it.

-Starbases:  Hanging around a starbase will now result in a communication
from the starbase asking you if you want to dock.  If you do press the
acknowledge button on the communications screen.  If you do not want to
dock, press the ignore button.
