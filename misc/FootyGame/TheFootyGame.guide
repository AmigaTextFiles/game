@NODE int "Introduction"

Hello
-----
Welcome to the Footy Game, by Matthew Briggs, ENGiNE NiNE DESiGN 1998. Basically, its a `football spectator' program which allows you to type in two team names and six striker names (three on each team), and then after clicking `play' watch, your teams play a game of footy. This is not the best of programs, but it does entertain for a few minutes.

@NODE game "How to play the game"

The Main Menu
-------------
In the main menu, you must type or select two teams, if you do not, the `play' gadget will not work. Clicking on `Team A' or `Team B' will automatically give you a team from the premier league. Please note that the some of the default teams may be out-dated or inaccurate.

The Game
--------
The game lasts for 90 seconds, split into two halves, plus pauses for the text commentary. If a player gets sent off, or injured then that team has less chance of scoring a goal. No skill is involved whilst playing, as the game is totally random.

About the Author
-----------------
I have never really liked football much, but the idea of writing a football game like this was so irresistible. I do, however, like Manchester United a lot, and if I win the lottery, I will buy the entire football club, so all I have to do now is wait for the three lucky numbers to come up!

Look out for more programs/games coming out soon from Megatastic Software/ENGiNE NiNE DESiGN
