HANG UP YOUR WORRIES
STOP BITING ALL YOUR NAILS
I'VE GOT A POCKET FULL OF TROUBLES 
BUT THERE'S ROOM ENOUGH FOR ALL OF YOURS

YOU'VE GOT A SWEET TOOTH
IT GOES WITH MY CLEAN SHAVEN LOOKS
THE TWO OF US JUST CAN'T FAIL
PLUS WE'VE GOT AN ANGEL
WHO'S SENT FROM ABOVE
IT'S THE BURGER EATING KING OF ROCK `N' ROLL

IT'S JUST A LITTLE OLD YOU AND ME
WITH *** A LIDDLE BIDDY HELP FROM ELVIS ***
IT'S JUST A LITTLE OLD YOU AND ME
