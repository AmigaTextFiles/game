Introduction
@{UB}
Not another bloody tetris game! I hear you cry. Well, sorry, I'm afraid so. I just had to do it as it's a type game I have never tried to code before on the Amiga. Blocks is more of a Sega columns clone, rather than that extremely Boring Russian game found on the Nintendo Gameboy. The aim of the game is to get a line of 3 or more blocks which share the same colour. The line can be in either a horizontal, vertical or diagonal direction. 

More points can be gained depending on how long the line is or how many `Chain reactions' you get.

Blocks will be taken away from the bottom to help you on certain levels or when you reach 10,000 points, 20,000 points and every other 20,000 points after.

Intro track information
@{UB}
I would like to thank Tim Searle of Timski Media for his excellent Ambient module which we have used for the introduction track of this game. The module was originally in an 8 channel OctaMED/MED format, however we have converted it in to a 4 channel Protacker format and removed a breakbeat instrument, therefore resulting in quality loss. If you would like to hear the original track plus many other great modules from Tim Searle check out his work in CUCD 18.

                Ambiance    -       by Tim Searle.

                      © Timski Media 1997.


        This song was started on 3rd May 1997 by me. It can be copied
and distributed as much as required, the only thing I ask is that the
annotation remains unchanged.

        The song has a subtle ambient vibe to it with some smooth
backdrop chords, (I love chords). There isn't much more to say about
this one except, "I hope you enjoy it".
