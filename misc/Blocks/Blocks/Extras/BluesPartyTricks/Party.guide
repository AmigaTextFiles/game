Introduction

So, I finally decided to release this little demo. Its been sitting on my hard drive now for ages, and I felt that it was about time that it was 
released into the Amiga community.

Blues Party Tricks is about my Uncles dog named `Blue', who is a bit
mischievous and disobedient, I must credit Alan for his idea.

This is a demo which should not be taken seriously, infact it is crap, and
should not be viewed whilst operating heavy machinery. View at your own risk.

It is also important to note that the dog `Blue' is not standing in his
own excretion; It is infact mud. Boom^ of Dalnet channel #57_ was
the one who pointed out to me that this may cause confusion.
