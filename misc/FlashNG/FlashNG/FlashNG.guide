@{b}** Configuration **@{ub}


  FlashNG requires:
  -----------------

    .AmigaOS 3.x
    .320x200 256 colors Screenmode (AGA or RTG)
    .Lucyplay.library (Freeware, included)
    .GTLayout.library (Freeware, available on Aminet)

  Note: If you get trashed graphics under AGA, install NewWAP8

Introduction:
-------------

 
  FlashNG was first developed under MS/DOS in TurboPascal as a
  school project. I then managed to port it to the Amiga using
  FreePascal. And finally, I totally rewrote it in ANSI C.

  FlashNG is not just another Arkanoid Clone, here are some features:

   .Works on AGA, CGX & P96 (automatic ScreenMode detection)
   .Multitask (Automatically switch to Pause mode when FlashNG's screen
    is not selected)
   .No Enforcer hits
   .You can write your own Gfx & levels (See IFF2RAW dir)
   .Distributed as GPL: full C sources included
   .Should compile with SAS/C, VBCC and GCC
   .Nice Gameplay

  => I really can't bear people still releasing SHAREWARE (!) AMOS programs
     that do not multitask and only run with PAL/NTSC displays:

     The A500 was released 15 years ago !!

How to use it ?
--------------------

 
 Just launch "FlashNG" and this will bring up the GTLayout GUI.

 .If FlashNG is started for the first time, a config file will
  automatically be created with the default settings.

 .Then just change your settings and click on "save" and "play"

 .FlashNG is played with the mouse: click on the mouse to launch
  the ball and here we go !

 .Setting your own ModeID:

  From version 1.11, by changing the tooltype "SCREENMODE" you can
  make flashNG run on your prefered screenmode.

  e.g.  To run FlashNG on DBLNTSC Low resolution, set the tooltype like
        this: SCREENMODE=0x91000

  NOTE: you must enter the ModeID in hexadecimal form and must NOT forget
        the "0x" before the ModeID.

 Distribution
 ------------

 FlashNG is released as GPL: Feel Free to copy it, modify it etc...

 For more information about the GPL licence, see the file "licence.txt"


 When I say that I'm fed up with people still writing AMOS programs,
 this is not their fault: when I began to work on porting Flash
 to the Amiga, I found NO good examples covering Graphics.library/BltBitmap()...

 There is a big lack of FREE C Game sources for the AmigaOS.

 => I hope FlashNG will help other people.

Near future:
~~~~~~~~~~~~


 AmigaOS version:
  -------------

   .Score saved correctly
   .Sound support (via AHI) as soon as the author of Lucyplay.library
    has fixed the Hits of his Lib.


 Windows:
  -----

   .FlashNG will soon be ported to Win32



Possible future:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .Linux/SVGALib port of FlashNG:

        *Even if Linux is the slowest OS I have ever seen,
        *Even if XFree doesn't like my GfxCard,
        *Even if there are no drivers for my sound card,
        ...

   A lot of people seem to use it (I really don't know WHY) so... why not ?
