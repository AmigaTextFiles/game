v1.15

- ADDED: IFF2RAW (exe and sources) Small tool to convert IFF files to RAW chunky
         Everybody can now create their own graphic sets and use it in FlashNG
- ADDED: Starfield at the Gameover Screen (although a bit slow compared to the MS/DOS version)
- ADDED: GCC Makefile (thanks to Mathias Parnaudeau)
- FIXED: FlashNG exited without reporting any error when the gtlayout.library
         could not be opened
- ADDED: LoadScore() SaveScore() functions => Created dat/Score.dat (Scores are not saved yet)
- ADDED: ScoreTable (As Required by AActive ;))

v1.12  (Changes by Giles Burdet)

- FIXED: formatting of the code
- ADDED: version.h (had to guess its contents !!)
- FIXED source code:

>ENTER=0x44;
warning 125 in line 49 of "Data:Code/c/FlashNG/flash.c": no declaration-specifier, used int
>ESC=0x45;
warning 125 in line 50 of "Data:Code/c/FlashNG/flash.c": no declaration-specifier, used int
>PAUSE=0x19;
warning 125 in line 51 of "Data:Code/c/FlashNG/flash.c": no declaration-specifier, used int
>RIGHT=0x4E;
warning 125 in line 52 of "Data:Code/c/FlashNG/flash.c": no declaration-specifier, used int
>LEFT=0x4F;
warning 125 in line 53 of "Data:Code/c/FlashNG/flash.c": no declaration-specifier, used int
- changed to #define's

>void main(void) {
warning 121 in line 384 of "Data:Code/c/FlashNG/flash.c": return type of main is not int
- changed return type to int
- added line "return 0;" at end of main()
  
- commented out <pragmas/gtlayout_pragmas.h>
  created a gtlayout.lib link library and added that to the makefile

"__regargs" used in icon.c function protos
- removed

undefined reference to GTLayoutBase in gui.c
- added external reference to GTLayoutBase in gui.c
- added "struct Library *GTLayoutBase=NULL;" to flash.c

Use of ReportMouse1() in flash.c seems to be nonstandard (the "broken" argument ordering?)
- changed to ReportMouse()

GTLayoutBase used in call to OpenLibrary(), without matching call to CloseLibrary() in gui.c
- added:
    CloseLibrary(GTLayoutBase);
    GTLayoutBase=NULL;

#including <math.h> in flash.c and timer.c, when it's not needed
- removed!

- Added #ifdef DEBUG #endif code to flash.c and gui.c

struct Library *GTLayoutBase was defined in gui.c->GUI()!!!!!!! Aaaaargh!!!!!! Crash! Burn!
- removed! external reference to GTLayoutBase at top of gui.c now works as expected

lots of "assignment of different pointer" warnings in flash.c and "formal parameter conflicts"
in gui.c
- changed ordering of structs and function protos in FlashProtos/FlashGame.h (structs BEFORE
  protos now!)

- external reference to IconBase added in icon.c, with declaration in flash.c

- cleaned up icon.c

- changed default name of executable to "FlashNG" instead of "FlashNG.exe", because *.exe
  makes it look like one of those scummy PC programs! ;-)

- cleaned up timer.c

- improved load.c
   removed CloseALLfiles() from load.c and FlashLoad.h
   removed call to CloseAllfiles() from exitflash() in flash.c
   more robust LoadGfx() function
   smaller generated code

FlashNG would fail to load without an icon
- fixed in icon.c

Pressing Esc takes a life off (erm, why would somebody want to give themselves one less life?!)
- Pressing Esc now quits the game, no matter how many lives you have!

Header files don't have the same name as corresponding .c files
- renamed headers and deleted the FlashProtos directory
- modified makefile accordingly

- flash.c now has a $VER string so that you can type "version FlashNG" at a shell prompt
  and get the version

- gui.c now uses the contents of version.h when building the GUI. Now you just have to change
  version.h, and all the GUI's windows have new version information, automatically!

- removed the function exitflash(), removed the call to exitflash() from LoadGfx(),
  replaced exitflash() with improved InitIntuition() and AllocFlash() routines, as well
  as an improved main() that handles all allocation/deallocation and error messages, and
  calls the function flashngmain() to play the game

- attempted to translate as many of the French variable and function names into English
  as possible (still not sure how best to translate the odd one or two...)

- went through flash.c's global variables, and found that not so many of them were global
  put them in their proper place
  even found some that were unused (but might be in commented out code, so left them in)
  removed some that were completely unnecessary!


v1.11

- Initial Aminet release
