---------------------------------------------------------- ACe -----------

INSTALLATION:
-------------
Simply drag the drawer BCS in the place where you wish to have it.
That's all! BCS will automatically recognize the right path to access the
necessary files.

SYSTEM REQUIRED:  An AMIGA (surprised?) with a minimum of 1 Mb RAM.
----------------

GOAL OF THE GAME:
-----------------

Creating a "Bonhomme" as shown in the left part of the screen, in the right
part with the help of six buttons.

When you achieve it, a champion cup will appear!
To continue, just click on the button <CREATION>.
There is some help available with the pull down menus and some options that
I let you discover...

This game was primarily intended for kids aged 3-4 but I added a little
module to measure the memory of everyone that wish to compete! It is called
<BILAN> and last on 7 "bonhommes" before giving a result. For the moment
everything is written in french. Sorry... If I see enough interrest, I will
be happy to make an English version of BCS or every other language that is
asked for (with a good dictionnary and a little help!)


FUNCTIONS :
-----------
BCS is surely enough simple that it is not worth describing it! Just try...

Some points must be specified:

1/ When starting, BCS will load as much "Bonhommes" as possible depending
   on the available free memory at that moment. To do so, click anywhere
   on the presentation screen...
2/ Running BCS should not alterate the multitasking.
3/ When you quit BCS, choose the right option depending on what you wish to
   do: "Quitter + Vider RAM" will quit and free the RAM used by the
   "Bonhommes" otherwise, the directory will remains. This choice is
   historical: It was used during the debugging phase and I found it
   convenient for adding in live, some new "Bonhommes"...
4/ The <CREATION> button remains disabled as long as the right "Bonhomme"
   hasn't been found.
5/ The 6 finding buttons become disable when the result is correct.
6/ If you wish to access this documentation from BCS, rename it BCS.doc

Known bugs:
-----------

1/ When entering in the game after loading, you need to click two times
   on the <CREATION> button to run BCS. The window is not well initilized.
2/ When viewing all the existing "bonhommes" from the menu, be patient and
   don't request the same menu again and again... I forgot to put some
   locking mechanism and I am too lazy to implement it now...
3/ ??? Do you found other things? Please, tell me!


EXTENSIONS:
-----------

The maximum number of "Bonhommes" is limited only by the available RAM when
loading BCS... And your imagination!
Yes, you can easily add, replace or modify some "bonhommes" as you wish it.
To do it, simply use a drawing tool (like DPaint for example) and take an
existing "bonhomme" as reference.
To succeed, you will have to create 3 brushes with respect of the original
sizes and respect my naming rules:

tetX.br    <- For the head        X design the Xth "bonhomme"
corX.br    <- For the body        If there is already 7 "bonhommes", the
basX.br    <- For the legs        new one will have X equal to 8.

Be sure to save your work in "Reference_unit:BCS/BCS_BR" otherwise BCS will
not take them in count when loading.
You can also copy it in RAM:BCS/BCS_BR to directly test it when using BCS.
I hope that you have enough RAM in this case!  :-)

For information, 5 "bonhommes" request aproximately 160K of RAM and every
new one needs around 17K RAM more. With a little luck, BCS should run on
a 512K RAM Amiga...

There are some sounds included in BCS_SON. You can put your own IFF sounds
instead of mine (or remove it) to suit your needs. To use them, you must
preserve the names that I used...


CONCLUSION:
-----------
I developped this little program for my daughter when she was 3 years old
because I wasn't able to find software reaching the following needs:
- Familiarize a 3 years old kid with a computer
- Use a mouse in a simple logic environment
- Little fun to keep the children interrest
- Way to avoid boring the children with surprises (New "bonhommes")

When I achieved it, I found that it was also a good memory exercice
combined with a logic approach.

Looking how both my children react to BCS, I feel it is a success. I hope
that many other children will also enjoy it! If it is the case, please,
make me a favour: Send me a postcard to tell me. Fair deal, isn't it?
