@NODE INTRO "Shoot Out 2000 - Introduction"

                               @{U}INTRODUCTION@{UU}

   Welcome to @{B}Shoot Out 2000@{UB}! You may remember the first two versions
   of @{B}Shoot Out@{UB} from the Reader Games section of Amiga Format
   (issues 103 and 107 to be precise). Well, @{B}Shoot Out@{UB} is back, and
   this time it is bigger and better than ever!

   But why am I following the trend of so many other programmers,
   Electronic Arts being the main culprit, and calling the latest
   version of the game '2000'? I could just have easily have called
   this @{B}Shoot Out 3@{UB}! Well, the reason is that, on New Year's Eve, I
   was busy programming. That might sound sad and lonely, but I was
   feverishly working away on another project of mine, Aliens:
   Homeworld. Unfortunately, I got terribly stuck at about
   8pm on New Year's Eve. I spent the next few hours drinking to try
   and get some ideas flowing.

   The idea that came to me was, "Why don't you re-vamp @{B}Shoot Out 2@{UB}!
   It's been a while since you played that!" so I decided to
   temporarily postpone Aliens: Homeworld and start work on a new
   improved version of @{B}Shoot Out 2@{UB}. That idea came into my head a few
   minutes after midnight, hence me calling it '@{B}Shoot Out 2000@{UB}'!
   It really is quite simple when you think about it! :o)

   Note: @{B}Shoot Out 2000@{UB} is SHAREWARE. This is the full
   version of the game for Amiga Format Reader Games. If you want to 
   send donations of cash, my address is at the very end of this 
   document!

   Oh gawd, time for some legal stuff. Stuff that I bet no-one EVER 
   reads. Well, except lawyers and all of that, obviously!

   This software is provided 'AS IS', and the author of the software
   refuses to take any responsibility for any damage to you or your
   machine whilst using this software. You use this software at your
   own risk! It has been tested and has proven very stable in
   testing. There may be (read, will be) bugs in the software, but
   none of those bugs should cause damage to either you or your
   machine.
   Attempting to use this software on any machine other than an Amiga
   may result in damage to the machine in question. It has been
   written for use on Amiga computers only, and whilst it may work
   under an emulator, this has not been tested.
   Graphics card compatibility is not known. It should theoretically
   be entirely compatible with graphics card based machines, but as
   no-one at Joker Developments has a graphics card based machine,
   testing it on one is a bit difficult!
   This software is copyright, and the copyright is held by the
   author, Gareth Griffiths. You may distribute this software
   anywhere you wish, provided that no files from the distribution
   are modified or tampered with in ANY way.
   This software is SHAREWARE. Whilst you have the full version, a
   lot of work has gone into this software, and a donation would be
   appreciated! If you wish to send a donation, the address is at the
   very end of this document.

   Phew!

@NODE PLAY "Shoot Out 2000 - Playing The Game!"

                             @{U}PLAYING THE GAME!@{UU}

   Playing @{B}Shoot Out 2000@{UB} is really simple. It is a game
   designed for two human players, but I have finally included a
   one player option in this version.
   Like previous versions, the battle takes place in a playing area.
   Unlike previous versions, there are four different @{B}sectors@{UB}
   in this game. You can move between the different sectors in order
   to escape from enemy fire, or to get a better angle on a power-up.
   There are three different weapons in the game, as opposed to the
   previous version, which had just the one. The weapons get
   progressively more powerful, but also slower in the process.

   As always, the objective is to completely destroy the other craft.
   You do this using your weapons. Note that all three weapons only
   fire in a straight line, so to get a good shot, you must be in
   the sector exactly opposite your opponent, which also means they
   can get a good shot at you!

   If you are in the left or right hand sectors, you push @{B}UP@{UB}
   or @{B}DOWN@{UB} on the Joystick to move in that direction. If you
   are in the top or bottom sectors, you use @{B}LEFT@{UB} and
   @{B}RIGHT@{UB} in order to move about. Firing your weapon is done
   using the @{B}FIRE BUTTON@{UB}, regardless of what sector you are
   in.

   To move between sectors, you must travel to the extreme edge of
   your current sector, and whilst holding down the direction you
   wish to travel, press the @{B}FIRE BUTTON@{UB}. You will be
   teleported to the relevant sector. For example, if you are in
   the left hand sector, and you want to move to the top sector, you
   would push @{B}UP@{UB} until you reached the top of the sector.
   Then, whilst still pushing @{B}UP@{UB}, you would press the @{B}FIRE
   BUTTON@{UB} and then be teleported into the top sector.

   Power-Ups appear all the time, in the centre of the arena (i.e.
   not in any sectors). To collect one of these, simply shoot it
   with your weapon. The various power-ups available are detailed
   in the @{"Power-Ups" LINK POWER} section of this file.

   Your current @{B}ARMOUR@{UB} and @{B}LIVES@{UB} are shown in the top
   bar on the playing screen. The number of yellow bars in these
   indicators show the amount of each you have left, with a maximum
   of @{B}FOUR@{UB}. Armour and Lives can be replenished by collecting
   the relevant power-ups.

   The Menu System is very self-explanatory so I will not document
   it here, other than to say, press numbers to select options!! You
   do not use a Joystick on the menu system!!
