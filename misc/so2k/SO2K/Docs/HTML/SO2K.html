			Welcome to <B>Shoot Out 2000</B>! You may remember the first two versions
			of <B>Shoot Out</B> from the Reader Games section of Amiga Format
			(issues 103 and 107 to be precise). Well, <B>Shoot Out</B> is back, and
			this time it is bigger and better than ever!
		</P>
		<P ALIGN=LEFT>
			But why am I following the trend of so many other programmers,
			Electronic Arts being the main culprit, and calling the latest
			version of the game '2000'? I could just have easily have called
			this <B>Shoot Out 3</B>! Well, the reason is that, on New Year's Eve, I
			was busy programming. That might sound sad and lonely, but I was
			feverishly working away on another project of mine, Aliens:
			Homeworld. Unfortunately, I got terribly stuck at about
			8pm on New Year's Eve. I spent the next few hours drinking to try
			and get some ideas flowing.
		</P>
		<P ALIGN=LEFT>
			The idea that came to me was, "Why don't you re-vamp <B>Shoot Out 2</B>!
			It's been a while since you played that!" so I decided to
			temporarily postpone Aliens: Homeworld and start work on a new
			improved version of <B>Shoot Out 2</B>. That idea came into my head a few
			minutes after midnight, hence me calling it '<B>Shoot Out 2000</B>'!
			It really is quite simple when you think about it! <TT>:o)</TT>
		</P>
		<P ALIGN=LEFT>
			<I>Note: <B>Shoot Out 2000</B> is <U>SHAREWARE</U>. This is the full
			version of the game for Amiga Format Reader Games. If you want to 
			send donations of cash, my address is at the very end of this

		</P>
		<P ALIGN=LEFT>
			To be able to play <B>Shoot Out 2000</B>, you will need the
			following system setup (or better):
		</P>
		<P ALIGN=LEFT>
			<UL>
			<LI>An <B>Amiga</B> computer with Workbench 1.3 or above.
			<LI>Approximately 1Mb (one megabyte) of free RAM.
			<LI>A Joystick plugged into port 2 (the usual Joystick port)
			</UL>
		</P>
		<P ALIGN=LEFT>
			<UL>
			<LI>A hard drive is not required, but recommended for loading speed.
			<LI>A Joystick plugged into port 1 (the mouse port) for 2-player games.
			</UL>

			Playing <B>Shoot Out 2000</B> is really simple. It is a game
			designed for two human players, but I have finally included a
			one player option in this version.<BR>
			Like previous versions, the battle takes place in a playing area.
			Unlike previous versions, there are four different <B>sectors</B>
			in this game. You can move between the different sectors in order
			to escape from enemy fire, or to get a better angle on a power-up.
			There are three different weapons in the game, as opposed to the
			previous version, which had just the one. The weapons get
			progressively more powerful, but also slower in the process.
		</P>
		<P ALIGN=LEFT>
			As always, the objective is to completely destroy the other craft.
			You do this using your weapons. Note that all three weapons only
			fire in a straight line, so to get a good shot, you must be in
			the sector exactly opposite your opponent, which also means they
			can get a good shot at you!
		</P>
		<P ALIGN=LEFT>
			If you are in the left or right hand sectors, you push <B>UP</B>
			or <B>DOWN</B> on the Joystick to move in that direction. If you
			are in the top or bottom sectors, you use <B>LEFT</B> and
			<B>RIGHT</B> in order to move about. Firing your weapon is done
			using the <B>FIRE BUTTON</B>, regardless of what sector you are
			in.
		</P>
		<P ALIGN=LEFT>
			To move between sectors, you must travel to the extreme edge of
			your current sector, and whilst holding down the direction you
			wish to travel, press the <B>FIRE BUTTON</B>. You will be
			teleported to the relevant sector. For example, if you are in
			the left hand sector, and you want to move to the top sector, you
			would push <B>UP</B> until you reached the top of the sector.
			Then, whilst still pushing <B>UP</B>, you would press the <B>FIRE
			BUTTON</B> and then be teleported into the top sector.
		</P>
		<P ALIGN=LEFT>
			<A HREF="#power-ups">Power-Ups</A> appear all the time, in the centre of the arena (i.e.
			not in any sectors). To collect one of these, simply shoot it
			with your weapon. The various <A HREF="#power-ups">power-ups</A> available are detailed
			in the <A HREF="#power-ups">Power-Ups</A> section of this file.
		</P>
		<P ALIGN=LEFT>
			Your current <B>ARMOUR</B> and <B>LIVES</B> are shown in the top
			bar on the playing screen. The number of yellow bars in these
			indicators show the amount of each you have left, with a maximum
			of <B>FOUR</B>. Armour and Lives can be replenished by collecting
			the relevant <A HREF="#power-ups">power-ups</A>.
		</P>
		<P ALIGN=LEFT>
			The Menu System is very self-explanatory so I will not document
			it here, other than to say, press numbers to select options!! You
			do not use a Joystick on the menu system!!

			There are various power-ups available in the game. Below is as

			</TABLE>
		</P>
		<P ALIGN=LEFT>
			Simply shoot the power-up to collect it. Note that it is possible
			to collect an inferior weapon to the one you already have! You don't
			think I'd make it THAT easy do you? <TT>:o)</TT>
