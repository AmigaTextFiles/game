Amiga Boulder Dash V1.1909
(c) 1993 Jeff Bevis
-------
V1.1909, 23-APR-93

This is a fixed release;  Version 1.1908 was release without the bd.ed
file.  Also, some minor changes were made to the abd.guide documentation. 
(hard disk installation section, file names changed)

-------
V1.1908, 22-APR-93
The documentation for the program is in AmigaGuide format;  You'll need
to have that to read the docs without severe brainstrain.  (AmigaGuide
is available from Commodore, and recently became freely redistributable.)

The program has been tested to work on all machines with FAST memory; 
if you don't have FAST, forget it.

KickStart 2.0 or higher IS REQUIRED.

Please read the full documentation for more info, and PLEASE have FUN!
