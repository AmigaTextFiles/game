@Node requirements "System requirements"

@{u}SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS@{uu}

I have attempted to make this version of the program accessible to as many
Amiga users as possible.  The previous version failed to run on faster
machines do to some idiotic oversights on my part.  However, now it should
make no difference which processor you have.


@{u}Things you need:@{uu}

	· Kickstart 2.0 or higher.
	  I will no longer support version 1.3 of the OS in any of my
	  present or future projects.  It's antiquated, and should no longer
	  be in use.  If you're still using 1.3, I @{b}strongly@{ub}(!) encourage you
	  to upgrade to the latest OS release.  Without 2.0, I would @{b}still@{ub}
	  be writing the cave editor today...

	· At least 512K of FAST memory.  The program runs too slowly 
	  on machines with only CHIP memory.  The result is usually a
	  flickering gameplay display.  A1200 users are particularly
	  vulnerable to this problem since that machine is shipped with
	  2Mb of CHIP memory @{u}only@{uu}. 

	· The program must load into FAST memory (I can't empasize that
	  enough).  If you've tied up your FAST memory with other
	  applications, you could end up running the program in CHIP
	  (and it won't work well).

	· At least 1Mb RAM total, with at least 1Mb CHIP recommended.
	  (Precautions have been taken to hopefully get the program to 
	  work in less, but there are no lesser systems nearby to test :-)

	· @{b}Lots of free time@{ub}.


@{u}Things you don't need:@{uu}

	· A 68020, 030, or 040 is not needed, but recommended.  The game 
	  runs better if you give it the power!  The graphics animation
	  is about 50% slower with a 68000 processor.

	· Hard disk.  (although it helps a lot)

	· A Joystick (you can use the keyboard now)

@Node intro "Introduction to Amiga Boulder Dash"

@{u}INTRODUCTION@{uu}

This is all Laurence Vanhelsuwé's fault.  If his Rocky Clone V1.0 hadn't
fallen into my hands, I would have continued to lead a perfectly happy
life.  Instead, my desire to play Boulderdash was rekindled (rather 
violently, I might add), and thusly this incarnation of the game was 
born.

Laurence's program does a great job of accurately reproducing the
cell automata of the C64 version of Boulderdash, and I was duly impressed.
However, I wanted it to look and sound like the C64 version (well, we
should hope it would be a little better :-)  This program represents a
totally new implementation of the game, and none of the source code from
Rocky Clone V1.0 has been used in this program.  Several of the Rocky 
game caves are reproduced here, though -- primarily because 1) I haven't
had time to make a lot of new caves, and 2) I think Rocky players
(especially Laurence) would get a kick out of seeing the caves with
new, better graphics and sound.

For this release, the program has undergone many changes.  Lots of new
features have been added, most notably the @{"cave editor" link editor}.  Creating your
own new cave files has never been simpler!  For a full description of the
new features and/or changes from version 0.9, see the @{"Changes" link changes} section of
this file.

This version of the program has been tested successfully on several
machine configurations:

	· A2000
	· A3000-25
	· A3000 with PPS '040
	· A4000

On each of these machines the program seemed to run fine.  The program
did not run well on the A1200 machines it was tested on, however they 
were not equipped with FAST memory (see @{"system requirements" link requirements}).

@Node changes "Changes since version 0.9"

@{u}CHANGES SINCE VERSION 0.9@{uu}

The game has been extensively rewritten since the initial release.  Many
(and I mean MANY) new features and functions have been added.  The most
glaring change from version 0.9 is the addition of a full game level
editor.  I sincerely hope THIS addition to the game will motivate others
to produce and share their own caves.

Other changes/features you should be aware of are:

	· 68010,020,030,040 compatability has been achieved.

	· The program no longer does a "hostile takeover" of the machine.
	  In fact, it is now OS-friendly.  (ie, task switching is not 
	  disabled.)  It does, however, OwnBlitter() during the entirety
	  of gameplay, which will cause 80% of other tasks (which have 
	  graphical output) to still be blocked.

	· The program no longer messes around with the CIAs, except for
	  Teijo's music software (which appropriately allocates this
	  system resource).

	· The full program has been tested with latest available Enforcer.
	  No Enforcer problems are known to exist at this time.

	· Game 'levels' are now more appropriately called 'caves'.

	· Butterflies and Fireflies may follow edges differently than
	  before.  Previously, butterflies 'rotated' in the 'counter-
	  clockwise' direction.  That is, if following an interior edge,
	  they would move counterclockwise.  Fireflies rotated clockwise.
	  The rotation for each is now selectable in the editor.  I suggest
	  that these 'rotation' parameters be kept the same in your own
	  levels for the sake of consistency for the player.

	· Certain walls are now 'unstable' for rocks and diamonds.  If 
	  a rock or diamond is sitting on a corner of this type of wall,
	  it will fall off the edge.  This can cause compatibility problems
	  with older caves which assume this isn't going to happen.  

	· Permanent wall now has its own selectable color, and its imagery
	  has been changed.

	· Boulders can now be colored.  Three tinting options are available
	  from the editor, and the tinting colors can be selected by the
	  user.

	· Regular wall now has its own selectable color.

	· The color of semi-permeable walls has changed.  It's orange now.
	  It was blue in version 0.9.

	· Diamonds now fall through semi-permeable walls the same way as
	  do rocks.

	· Boulders fall a little differently.  Version 0.9 permitted them
	  to fall 'diagonally'.  However, in this version they move left
	  or right and then drop directly downward.  This change was made
	  to comply better with the C64 version's behavior.  In general,
	  this doesn't cause serious compatibility problems since the
	  conditions for falling are pretty much the same.
	  
	· There is now a vertically-growing wall object similar in
	  function to the horizontally-growing wall.
	  
	· Another new object, "Homocide Box," has been added.  This object
	  must be protected as if it were the player.  If destroyed, it
	  will cause the player to be killed immediately.  It is prone
	  to the same dangers as is the player (ie, falling rocks,
	  explosions, butterflies, etc.)

	· Keyboard input can now substitute for joystick movement.  The 
	  Cursor keys emulate joystick directions, and the shift key 
	  represents the fire button.  Either may be used interchangeably
	  during gameplay.
	  
	· @{"File passwords" link filepass} can be used to keep others from viewing your
	  cave files.

	· @{"Cave codes" link levcode} have been added.  The password is shown at the 
	  bottom of the screen when the cave title is shown.  Typing this
	  password into the 'Code' box in the game window (before play
	  begins) will select that level to be the first encountered during
	  play.

	· Oh yeah -- there's a @{"cave editor" link editor} now, too.  Users no longer need
	  to edit the cave file in a textual format.  All editing and 
	  parameter manipulation is done through the editor functions.
	  Naturally, the editor was contructed with the help of OS2.0's
	  splendid gadtools.library.

@Node install "Installation Procedure"

@{u}INSTALLATION@{uu}

No ASSIGNs, fonts, or special libraries are needed to run this program.
All that is required is that the program files exist in the same directory,
and that the program be invoked only from that directory (or by its 
Workbench icon).

These are the files you need to have:

	· abd
	· abd.info
	· abd.guide
	· abd.guide.info
	· abd.snd
	· abd.txt
	· abd.16
	· abd.ed
	· abd.ts
	· abd.mod

Additionally, there must exist a subdirectory 'caves' in the same directory
as the game files.  This subdirectory must (or will) contain all the cave
files you wish to have accessible.  Cave files always end in '.caves'.  There
are three cave files provided with this release:

	· Original.caves   (these are enhanced caves from version 0.9)
	· BDash_I.caves
	· CKit.caves

@Remark ******************************************************************
@Node overview "Overview"

@{u}OVERVIEW@{uu}

When you run the program, a window appears on the Workbench.  This window
is often referred to as the "startup window" in this document.  The main
purpose of the window is to allow you to @{"select a cave file" link selectcavefile} to play (each
file may contain many unique caves).  You may only select one cave file
at at time.  Note that selecting the cave file (by clicking on its name
in the listview gadget) will cause the program to attempt to load the 
cave file into memory.  Any other currently loaded cave file (including
work left in the editor) will immediately be unloaded.

There are several button gadgets in the startup window:

	· Play
		This gadget, when not ghosted, begins play of the chosen
		cave file.

	· Editor
		Use this gadget (again, only when not ghosted) to edit
		the selected cave file.  This invokes the @{"cave editor" link editor}.

	· New
		This gadget will create a new cave file and automatically
		open the @{"cave editor" link editor} screen.

	· Quit
		This button, or the startup-window close gadget, will
		quit the program.

In addition to these gadgets, there are two text-entry gadgets.

	· Password
		@{"File passwords" link filepass} must be entered here.  Cave files which
		require a password are not editable unless the correct
		password has been entered.

	· Code
		Enter a @{"cave code" link levcode} (appears during gameplay with the
		name of the level) to start play on any level you
		like. 


After you click 'Play', you get the game title screen.  Press any key or
the joystick trigger button to continue.  The next screen appears with the
title of the first cave.  Again, press a key or the joystick trigger.
You'll then begin play on the first cave.

At the bottom is shown:

	CAVE xxx	the current cave level number
	NEED xxx	the number of diamonds still needed to finish the level

	TIME xxx	the time (seconds) you have to complete the level
	xxxxxxxx	your score	

During gameplay, the following keyboard commands exist:

	SPACE		pauses the game
	ESCAPE		leave the game;  returns to the Workbench window
	RETURN		commit suicide -- restarts the level
	cursor keys	enulates joystick movement
	SHIFT keys	emulates joystick firebutton

The idea is to get the number of diamonds indicated before time runs out.
To do so, you move around with the joystick, avoiding obstacles and threats
while maneuvering to collect diamonds.  When you have enough diamonds to
leave the cave (you will hear a 'snap' sound and the screen will flash),
you must find the exit symbol and move into it.

At the end of a level, your time bonus is calculated and added to your score.
You then proceed to the next cave.  Simple, right!?!

At any time during gameplay, you can press the escape key to back out to
the title screen.  Pressing escape at the title screen returns you to the
Workbench window.

@Node filepass "File password protection"

@{u}FILE PASSWORD PROTECTION@{uu}

It is possible to prevent others from editing your cave files by adding
a file password.  To add such protection, simply type in a non-empty
password name in the password box in the @{"cave selector" link cavesel} window and save
the cave.  Others will not be able to edit your file unless they have the
correct password.

Keep in mind that it's not very useful to have a file password unless you
also select encryption to be used, too.  The cave file format is readable
text unless it is encrypted.  Be careful, though!  If you save your file
in encrypted form, and then forget your password, you will have no way 
to recover your file!!  Because of this potential for disaster, I suggest
you always keep one copy of your cave file in non-encrypted form, and
save with a different filename when generating the encrypted copy.  To do
this, just change the file name in the @{"cave selector" link cavesel} window (the old 
file will not be deleted unless you tell the program to do so).

Note please that the file password is an entirely different thing than 
the @{"cave codes" link levcode}.

@Node editor "The cave editor"

@{u}THE CAVE EDITOR@{uu}

In the previous version, the only way to create a cave was to type it into
the cave file by hand.  No more!  The cave editor supplied with this release
makes creating your own levels almost as easy as playing them!

The editor features allow you to do the following things in a friendly,
reliable environment:

	· Remove caves from a file
	· Change the play order of caves in a file
	· Create new caves in any editable file
	· Add @{"password protection" link filepass} to the file
	· Draw cave maps in a "paint" fashion
	· Adjust a plethora of parameters on a per-cave basis:
		· Time limits
		· Graphics
		· Colors
		· ... and more
	· View @{"cave passwords" link levcode}

The Amiga Boulder Dash cave editor is a part of the game program itself.
You may choose to edit existing cave files, or create your own from
scratch (by selecting "New" from the startup window).

There are several windows associated with the cave editor; none of these 
windows appear on the Workbench (like the startup window).  Instead, 
a separate screen is used.  The height of this screen is usually a little 
over 210 lines, which makes it a little taller than a normal NTSC screen.
Normally this will not cause any problems.  The windows which comprise
the editor are:

	· @{"Cave selector" link cavesel}
	· @{"Visual editor" link visedit}
	· @{"Color palette" link palette}
	· @{"  Cave info  " link caveinfo}

Saving of the edited caves (probably the most important feature!) is
accomplished in the cave selector.  See the Cave Selector section for
more information on how this is done.

There are several design rules to keep in mind when using the cave
editor to make your own caves.  Please see the @{"designing caves" link designing} section
for more information.

For examples with the cave editor, the BDash_I cave file has been left
unencrypted and without a file password.

@Node designing "Designing caves"

@{u}DESIGNING CAVES@{uu}

Cave designers should heed the following design criteria:

	· ALWAYS BOUND MOVABLE OR MOVING OBJECTS WITH PERMANENT WALLS
	  This is the single most important characteristic of all
	  good caves.  No objects such as the player, butterflies or 
	  fireflies, growing walls, diamonds or rocks, or anything
	  else which moves, should ever be allowed to get to the edge of
	  a cave.  Explosions must never center on the very edge of caves,
	  and this design rule keeps that from happening.  It is OK to 
	  have non-moving objects on the borders, however, like limbo
	  or non-permanent walls.  Non-permanent walls are NOT a good
	  bounding device, though, since they can be destroyed by any
	  explosion which then leaves the cave borders accessible to 
	  moving objects.
	  
	  One final warning here:  If you don't follow this rule, and 
	  something moves to the border of the cave, the object may be
	  able to move OUT OF THE CAVE.  If this happens, expect weird
	  results and POTENTIAL CRASHES.  You were warned!!

	· Allow a little extra time on each level.  Some machines run
	  a little slower than others, and not everyone plays as well
	  as you do, so you should add at least 10% extra time than
	  is actually necessary to complete each level.
	  
	  One 68000 machines, game play is currently about 1/8 slower
	  than on '020 an above processors.

@Node selectcavefile "Selecting a cave file"

@{u}SELECTING A CAVE FILE@{uu}

Select a cave file from the Workbench game window (the first one which opens
when you run the game).  To do this, you simply click on one of the names
in the list at the left side of the window.  If this list is empty, you may
not have a caves subdirectory in the main game directory, or you may not
have any caves in that directory.

If there is any problem loading your selected file, it will be displayed in
the text box at the top of the window.  Otherwise, you may then play or 
edit the caves in that file.  (to edit, you may need to enter a file
password first, if it is required)

Information about the cave file is shown at the bottom of the window.

	· Author
		The name of the author of the currently loaded cave file.

	· Date
		The last date of modification of the cave file.

	· Version
		The version number of the cave file.  Higher numbers
		indicate later versions.  Numbering begins with 1 (one).

@Node cavesel "Cave selector"

@{u}CAVE SELECTOR@{uu}

The Cave Selector is the first of the editor windows.  It presents a list
of the caves contained in the current file (listed in play order from top
to bottom).  You may rearrange the play order with the move up/down gadgets,
add a new cave, or edit an existing cave.  To edit, select the cave you
want and click "edit".  The @{"visual editor" link visedit} will then open
its window.

The "done" gadget leaves the cave selector and returns you to the startup
window on the Workbench.  It will first prompt you about saving the file.
Cave files are saved by acknowledging the requester accordingly.

The name of the cave file can be changed in this window.  Additionally,
the @{"file password" link filepass} can be changed here (an empty password string will
deactivate password protection of the file).

There is last gadget of importance here:  The encryption checkbox.  If 
selected, the cave file will be saved in an unreadable form to prevent
others from reading or modifying it.  Additionally, encrypted files
are password-secure;  The password can not be learned by reading the
file with a text-editor.

@Remark ******************************************************************

@Node visedit "Visual editor"

@{u}VISUAL EDITOR@{uu}

The visual editor is the primary work window for the editor package.  It
provides a graphical (scrolling window) display of the currently selected
cave (which was selected in the cave selector).  In this part of the
editor you may redraw the cave by adding or removing any game objects you
desire.

Most of the gadgetry should be self explanatory.

Special keycode operations in the visual editor:

	· cursor
		Cave window scrolling, same effect as using the sliders
		at the sides of the window.

	· SHIFT+cursor
		Jump to an edge of the cave.  For instance, the 
		SHIFT+cursor_up combination would show the topmost
		visible portion of the cave.
		
	· ALT+cursor
		Shift the entire cave by one position in the specified 
		direction.  This is useful in centering or adding space
		to a cave early on in its development.  Note that the
		portion which is shifted off of the other side of the
		cave 'rotates' around to the other side.  This makes
		the shifting operation lossless in that no cave
		information will be lost during shifting.

Mouse functions:

	· Left mouse button
		Pressing this mouse button inside of the cave window will
		'paint' the currently selected object at the pointer's
		position.  You may draw single positions, or you can drag
		the mouse over an area, drawing the object throughout.

	· Right mouse button
		This button provides a limited undo.  The previous drawing
		operation may be removed with this feature.  Only drawing
		performed with the mouse may be undone.  (shift operations
		or sizing operations can't be undone.)

TESTING CAVES

The cave can be easily tested during development.  The "Test" gadget
begins gameplay with the current cave.  Pressing escape during testing
returns to the editor.  Note that when (and if) the player enters the
exit box (completing the level) during test play, you still have to
press escape to return to the editor.  This is done to permit viewing
the results (score, etc) if needed or useful.

One color is selected as the "current" color at any given time.  This color
will have its red, green, and blue values shown in the color sliders.
Adjusting the sliders will adjust the currently selected color with
immediate visual feedback.  To select a different "current" color, simply
click inside the gadget for the desired color.  The currently selected 
color will always be marked by an "X" in its gadget.

Most of the color gadgets in the window represent single colors.  The
diamond and butterfly gadgets, however, represent sixteen colors each.
Both of these gadgets actually represent color-cycle sequences.  When
selecting colors in these gadgets, the "X" marker will appear on top of
one of the sixteen colors in the gadget (this is the selected color).

Colors may be copied with the "copy" gadget.  The currently selected color
will be copied to another location if the user clicks "copy" then the 
destination color gadget.  The exchange operation is similar in operation,
except the destination color replaces the source.

The Spread operation applies only to the sixteen-color diamond and
butterfly color gadgets.  It produces smoothly-graded color transitions
between any two arbitrary colors in a single gadget.  To use do this,
first select a color at one end of the range to be affected.  Then, click
"spread" and subsequently the color at the other end of the range.


@{u}BOULDER TYPE@{uu}

This gadget selects one of three types of boulders to use with the cave.
The three possible selections are:

	· Monochromatic
		Gray boulder which looks like the version 0.9 boulder.

	· Boulder color tinted
		Tinted boulder;  The tinting color comes from the color
		gadget at the top of the palette window.  Shading on
		the boulder is automatically generated.

	· Tinted + Wall Highlight
		The boulder is again tinted, however, it also has a
		second color highlight in its brightest area.  The 
		color used is the same as for regular walls.

@{u}DIAMOND TYPE@{uu}

This gadget selects the shape of the diamond for the cave.  There are 
several possibilities.  Most of the shapes use only the diamond color
cycle, however, there are "two-color" diamonds which use both the
regular diamond color sequence AND the butterfly color sequence.

@{u}CAVE CODES@{uu}

Cave codes permit the user to start gameplay with any cave in
a cave file.  The cave codes are different for each cave file, and
must be acquired in one of two ways.

	· Either by playing the cave file, and recording the passwords
	  for each cave you encounter, or:
	  
	· The @{"cave editor info window" link caveinfo} provides the cave author with
	  the cave code.

The level is entered in the startup window "Code" text gadget.

NOTE that cave codes are a different thing than @{"file passwords" link filepass}.  The file
password controls editing access to the cave file.  Cave codes are for 
the player to use when playing the cave file.
