   It's my first program in Amos basic, it's a little game. Just for fun.

   You are a garage-man who should get back some gouts.  

   I'm sure you 'll enjoy it.

   The keys: Left Alt,Shift,Amiga to go to left.
             Right Alt,Shift,Amiga to go to right.
             (like pinball games!)

             Space to restart.
             Ctrl-C to quit.
             Amiga-A to multitasking.

   Note : If you are using sys 1.3, assign command used in
          the file "RunPanic" doesn't work. Copy the content
          of the "Fonts" directory in your own "Fonts" system
          directory. Assign "Panic:" to the directory you've
          installed the game, and launch "Panic" to run it.
                    
   Thanks to Nour and Igor for the help in AmosPro.
   Others thanks to J-Files and Yocine.

   I made this game so as to learning to program.
   I hope that my game would incite young programmers
     to realize cool games or others things.

   Excuse my poor english, I'm french. (thanks to J-Files;)
