A mysterious ghostly image materializes in front of you.
It speaks: 'Greetings, fellow abider in Law. I am called
The LawBringer. If you wish to advance our cause, obtain
the mystic Star Gem and return it to me on Star Peak.
Beware the power of the evil Circle of Sorcerors and the
forces of Chaos which guard the gem.'
The strange form fades slowly.
