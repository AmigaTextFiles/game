SAVING AND RESTORING
==================== 
Since  omega's  dungeon is quite large, only the current dungeon level
and  the  city  level will be saved; others will be regenerated as you
re-enter them.  You might simply consider that the "actual" levels are
far  larger  than is apparent, and you are just traversing a different
part  on  each  restore....  If you know the spell of Return, however,
(learnable  at  the  Explorers' Club) you will be able to warp to your
deepest  excursion in the most recently entered dungeon without having
to  retraverse  the old levels in between.  Some other shortcuts exist
for "warping" from one locale or level to another.

A change from the original version (0.75) is that the game-file is NOT
deleted,  this is done since restore/save - time/space (typical 150K!)
still is relatively large and players usually make a backup anyway.

To save type 'S'

To load type '!'

There  is  currently no commands you can give through the commandline.
To  load  from  or  save  to  a  given  file.  Type in the name in the
file-selection window when it pops up.
