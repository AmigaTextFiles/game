A chime sounds from far away.... The sound grows stronger...
Suddenly the great shadowy form of the LawBringer appears over the city. 
He points his finger at you...
Cursed art thou, minion of chaos!
May thy strength fail thee in thy hour of need! 
You feel an unearthly shiver 
as the LawBringer waves his palm across the city skies....
You hear a bell tolling, and eerie moans all around you....
Suddenly, the image of the LawBringer is gone.

You hear a guardsman's whistle in the distance!
