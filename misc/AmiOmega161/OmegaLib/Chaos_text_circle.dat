You hear the voice of the Prime Sorceror:
'Congratulations on your attainment of the Circle's Demesne.'
For the honor of the Circle, you may take the Star Gem
and destroy it on the acme of Star Peak.
Beware the foul LawBringer who resides there...
By the way, some of the members of the Circle seem to
have become a bit jealous of your success --
I'd watch out for them if I were you.
