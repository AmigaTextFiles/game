You discover in a dusty tome some interesting information....
The Star Gem holds a vast amount of mana, usable
for either Law or Chaos. It is magically linked to Star Peak
and can either be activated or destroyed there. If destroyed,
its power will be used for Chaos, if activated, for Law.

It is said the LawBringer has waited for an eternity
at the Star Peak for someone to bring him the gem.
It is also rumored that while anyone might destroy the gem,
releasing chaotic energy, only the LawBringer can release
the lawful potential of the gem.
