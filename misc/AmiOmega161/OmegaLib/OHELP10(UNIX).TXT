SAVING AND RESTORING
==================== 
Since  omega's  dungeon is quite large, only the current dungeon level
and  the  city  level will be saved; others will be regenerated as you
re-enter them.  You might simply consider that the "actual" levels are
far  larger  than is apparent, and you are just traversing a different
part  on  each  restore....  If you know the spell of Return, however,
(learnable  at  the  Explorers' Club) you will be able to warp to your
deepest  excursion in the most recently entered dungeon without having
to  retraverse  the old levels in between.  Some other shortcuts exist
for "warping" from one locale or level to another.

UNIX:
Games  can  be  restored  by  giving  the  save file as a command line
argument as in:

% omega quasar.sav

AMIGA:
For  Amiga  users,  You don't need to type the name of the file on the
command  line  in CLI.  When the game is loaded however, you must type
the name of the player in the file-selection window.

UNIX:
To  at  least  simulate the continuity of character in the game, saved
files  will  be  unlinked  on  restoration.  Of course, you *can* copy
them.   This  is  also  different  for  Amiga  users.  The game is NOT
deleted  during  restoration,  due  to  compensate for slowness of the
disk-operation.

Save    files   are   automatically   compressed   unless   the   flag
COMPRESS_SAVE_FILES  is undefined in odefs.h.  This doubles the amount
of  time taken to save, but reduces the typical save file from 150K to
15K.

AMIGA:
Again  there  is  a  difference for Amiga users.  The save file is not
compressed...Besides  it  is  possible  to load and restart inside the
game with the '!' command.
