Okay, after much head scratching, I've finally partly figured
how level data is stored in bombjack.

First, prepare a file containing the entire CPU1 address space :

  $ cat 09_j01b.bin 10_l01b.bin 11_m01b.bin 12_n01b.bin >mem
  $ dd bs=1024 count=16 </dev/zero >>mem 
  $ cat 13.1r >>mem

Now run bjldump on that :

  $ make bjldump
  $ ./bjldump mem >bjldump.out

Next step is to find where enemies are defined.
