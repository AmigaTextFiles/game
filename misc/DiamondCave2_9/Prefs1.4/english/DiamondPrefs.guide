@NODE Intro "Introduction"

 @{b}Welcome to DiamondPrefs V1.4@{ub}

 This program provides an easy and comfortable way to configure Diamond
 Caves Game and the Diamond Caves Editor.

 @{" The main window " Link Window}

 This program is based on @{"MUI" Link Mui}.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Require "Requirements"

 @{b}Requirements@{ub}

 @{u}DiamondPrefs@{uu} V1.4 requires:

 - Kick 2.0
 - MUI 2.3 (3.1 or higher recommended)
 - @{"Diamond Caves V2.0" Link DC:DiamondCaves.guide/Main}
 - Commodore's Installer (can be found on your Workbench-Install-Disk)

 This program has beend tested with Enforcer, Mungwall and CodeWatcher.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Install "Installation"

 @{b}Installation@{ub}

 @{u}DiamondPrefs@{uu} comes with a ready-to-run installer-script for the Commodore
 Installer. Just click on the icon and follow the text in the window.

 Basically, the script will copy all necessary files in the Directory "DC:"
 according to the present version.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Window "The main window"

 The main window of DiamondPrefs is seperated into two parts:

 @{" configuring the Game " Link Game}

 @{" configuring the Editor " Link Editor}

 At the bottom are two buttons:

 @{b}Save@{ub} will save your settings to disk

 @{b}Exit@{ub} will close the window and leave the preferencesfile unchanged

@ENDNODE

@NODE Game "configuring the Game"

 @{b}Configuring the @{"Game" Link DC:DiamondCaves.guide/Main}@{ub}

 Note: If there is a preferencesfile in your DC: drawer, it will
 automatically be loaded and all tooltype settings will be overridden!

 @{b}@{u}ScreenMode@{ub}@{uu}

   @{b}own Screen@{ub}

     If you want to run Diamond Caves on its own screen, you may choose two
     different screenmodes, one for the titlescreen and one for the game.

     Note that both the title and the game were designed to be used on a
     screen with a 1:1 pixel-ratio like LoRes or HiRes-Interlace.

     Since V2.3 of Diamond Caves, you can even select a CyberGfx screenmode.

     Note: Due to limitations in the CyberGfx-Emulation, scrolling is not
     very smooth. You should use a screenmode big enough to cover the
     whole playfield to avoid flicker scrolling.

   @{b}Public Screen@{ub}

    Since V2.0, Diamond Caves can be run on a standard Intuition Screen or
    on any Public Screen. Due to pen-Sharing, running the Game on a Public
    Screen is only possible with Kick3.x, a gfx-board is recommended.

    The program will always open with the maximum size because the actual
    game-play is quite fast while the scrolling is slow.

 @{b}@{u}Control@{ub}@{uu}

  Here you can specify the controlmethod of both players. You have the
  choice betweeen Joystick in port 1, Joystick in port 2 and Keyboard.

  Two player using keyboard will be possible in future versions.

 @{b}@{u}PreSets@{ub}@{uu}

   @{b}Leveldirectory@{ub} lets you select a default-directory that will be present
     at startup-time.

   @{b}Number of players@{ub} should be obvious

   @{b}Name@{ub} is the default-name you want to use.


 @{b}@{u}Misc@{ub}@{uu}

   @{b}gameport.device@{ub} : Choose if you want to use the gameport.device or bang
    the Joystick hardware directly.

   The next item alows you to place the @{b}status line@{ub} in the game (where your
   score gets displayed) above or below the game screen. When playing on a
   CyberGfx screenmode, the status-line will always be below the screen.

 @{b}Gfxfile@{ub} : Specify the graphics you want to use in the game. Use
   DiamondGfx to create your own gfx-file or use the default graphics in
   @{u}Diamond.16col@{uu} (normal 16 color version) or @{u}Diamond.32col@{uu} (extended 32
   color version - see @{"DiamondGfx" Link DC:DiamondGfx.guide/Main}).


   * @{b}Note: Use the following two buttons only if you know what you are @{ub} *
   * @{b}doing, the program automatically adusts to your Amiga and most of @{ub} *
   * @{b}the time, these settings are the best.                            @{ub} *

   @{b}Timing@{ub} : Toggles between using the timer.device or the vertical blanking
     interrupt (VBI) for timing. Use VBI only if you are playing in PAL-mode
     (will be set autoatically, if you specify a PAL-mode)

   @{b}Speed@{ub} : This slider controls the time (in 1/2500 seconds) the game has
     got to do its calculations. The normal value is 50 which leaves
     1/50 sec for every frame. 1 is very fast (although most of the time, the
     calculations will take longer than 0.0004 seconds), 200 is about 4 times
     slower than normal. This value is not affected by the screenmode you're
     using.

   Note: @{u}Speed@{uu} can only be changed while playing with timer.device.

   The button to the right will reset the Speed to the @{b}default@{ub} value of 50.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Editor "configuring the Editor"

 @{b}Configuring the @{"Editor" Link DC:DiamondEditor.guide/Main}@{ub}

 Select if you want to open the Diamond Caves Editor on its own Screen or
 on any Public Screen. Due to pen-Sharing, running the Editor on a Public
 Screen is only possible with Kick3.x.

 If you want to use a new Screen, you can select the screenmode of the
 PublicScreen, every screenmode capable of displaying at least 16 colors is
 supported.

 Note that the minimum size of the screen is 640x400.

 @{b}@{u}Presets@{ub}@{uu}

   @{b}Leveldirectory@{ub} lets you select a default-directory that will be present
     at startup-time.
   @{b}Nr.@{ub} is the initial levelnumber

   You can also select that you want to @{b}load the level@{ub} (specified by number
   and directory) at the beginning.
