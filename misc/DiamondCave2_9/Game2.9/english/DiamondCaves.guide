@NODE Intro "Introduction"

 @{b}Welcome to Diamond Caves V2.9!@{ub}

 Since 01/18/99 Diamond Caves I is freeware. It is still (C) Peter Elzner
 but you can use it free of charge. If you like the program, please send
 a postcard of your home town or country to @{" my address " Link Hawk}

 Here is a quick overview about what to do and what to read to start
 immediately:

 - If you have a vague knowledge of what the game is about, you may start
 right now, playing the 25 @{"Tutorial" Link Hints}-Levels. They will introduce you into
 all of the important things and extras of Diamond Caves.
 Additionally, there are 10 Easy-Levels and 25 Game-Levels.
 The Game-Levels are for advanced players.

 @{u}Newusers@{uu} should read @{"What's it all about?" Link Game}.

 If you constantly fail to solve a Level, try watching the record-file by
 clicking on @{u}Replay-game@{uu} or read the chapter @{"Level hints" Link Hints}.
 The main menu and all of its gadgets are discussed in @{"Title Screen" Link Title}.

 - If you want to reconfigure Diamond Caves please use the Diamond Caves
 Preferences program @{"DiamondPrefs" Link DC:DiamondPrefs.guide/Game 0}.

 - If you have comments, ideas or found some kind of bug, feel free to tell @{" me " Link Hawk}.
 But before asking stupid questions :-) read the chapter @{"Frequently asked questions" Link FAQ}!

 - Do you think Diamond Caves is a bit slow on your Amiga? Then read
 @{"How can I improve game speed?" Link q4} in the chapter @{"Frequently asked questions" Link FAQ}.

 That's about it, enjoy the game.

@ENDNODE

@NODE require "Requirements"

 @{b}Requirements@{ub}

 This game is written in an OS-friendly way, so it may not be as fast as a
 common hardwarehack would be. The game requires:

 - Kick 2.0
 - 1 MB chipmem / 1 MB fastmem
 - 68000
 - Harddisk
 - Commodore's Installer V1.24 (can be found on your Workbench-Install-Disk)

 recommended for ultimate joy:

 - Kick 3.x
 - a 68020 (or higher)
 - 2 MB chipmem (if you want to use large Levels or more colors)

 If you wonder why I decided to base the game on OS-routines and why the
 game is not as fast as it could be, read the @{"Frequently asked Questions" Link q2}.

 This program has beed tested with Enforcer, Mungwall and CodeWatcher.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Install "Installation"

 @{b}Installation@{ub}

 @{u}Diamond Caves@{uu} comes with a ready-to-run installer-script for the Commodore
 Installer. Just click on the icon and follow the text in the window.

 Basically, the script will copy all files in a Directory, assign the name
 "DC:" to it and install some tooltypes.

 If you select @{u}update@{uu}, the Installer only copys the files in the
 directory(s) with a higher version than your currently installed version of
 Diamond Caves. No old Icons, Levels, Highscores or Names will be changed.

 To reconfigure Diamond Caves, use the program @{"Diamond Prefs" Link DC:DiamondPrefs.guide/main}.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Game "What's it all about?"

 @{b}A short introduction to Diamond Caves@{ub}:

 This game is based on the idea of Boulder Dash back on the good old C64. I
 added some new ideas (and some gfx/sfx) of Emerald Mine by Kingsoft and a
 bunch of my own ideas (and ideas of my friends, other user, ...) as well.

 The main goal is to collect enough @{"Emeralds" Link Collect 1}  and reach the Exit in time.

 This task may be mastered alone or in teamwork.

 You can control the player by moving your Joystick in the appropriate
 direction. Pressing the button and moving the Stick causes the Player to
 stand still and collect the item in the given direction.

 @{b}P@{ub} will Pause the game
 (Note:To turn off the pause mode, you have to activate the game window
 (simply click with your mouse into it) and then press @{b}P@{ub} again)

 @{b}ESC@{ub} quits the game

 the F-keys change the view-area:
 @{b}F1@{ub}: Focus on Player 1
 @{b}F2@{ub}: Focus on Player 2
 @{b}F3@{ub}: Focus on both Players (note that you can't walk out of the visible
 area in this mode).

 If you are playing on a Public Screen you can resize the Window in Pause
 mode.

 If one of the Players is controlled by Keyboard, he may be moved using the
 @{b}cursor-keys@{ub}, @{b}Space@{ub} or @{b}R-Shift@{ub} is the firebutton-equivalent.

 How many Emeralds you have to collect and how many seconds are left
 is visible in the status-line on top or bottom of the screen.

 You can increase your score in four different ways:
 - destroying opponents with a boulder (not with an explosion)
 - collecting things (Emeralds, Diamonds, Dynamite or Keys)
 - cracking a Nut
 - achieving a bonus by having time left when reaching the exit.

 All of the extras described below are shown one by one in the
 25 @{"Tutorial-Levels" Link Hints}.

 A special feature of Diamond Caves is the @{u}replay-mode@{uu}.
 You are able to record your
 movements and watch yourself later playing the Level. All Levels
 in the unregistered Version are already shipped with a replay-file
 showing you how to solve the Level.
 When in replay-mode, you can use the following keys:
 @{b}F9@{ub}  or @{b}+@{ub}: Increase speed
 @{b}F10@{ub} or @{b}-@{ub}: Decrease speed (slow motion)

@ENDNODE

@NODE Solid "solid objects"

 There are many things in the game just "lying around", some are described
 seperately in @{"Things to collect" Collect}.

 - @{b}Empty Space@{ub} (black)
 Not much to say :-)

 - @{b}Sand@{ub}
 You can walk through it, Monsters can't

 - @{b}Boulder@{ub}
 Well, a rock is a rock. Be sure not to rest below one of them, they might
 smash you!

 - @{b}Bombs@{ub}
 Highly explosive!

 - @{b}Nuts@{ub}
 They reveale an Emerald if cracked open by a boulder.

 Rocks, Bombs and Nuts can be moved by the player!

 - @{b}Walls@{ub}
 Six types of walls:
   - steel Walls - can't be destroyed
   - brick Walls - can be crushed using some kind of explosion (Bomb)
   - special brick Walls - will expand to the sides!
   - brick Walls containing Emeralds/Diamonds - use a Bomb or Dynamite to
     get the Jewels
   - magic Wall (blue) - once a Rock/Emerald/Diamond falls onto the magic
     wall, the wall starts spinning for a few seconds, changing everything
     that falls through
   - invisible Wall - looks like empty space but is very solid! Can be
     bombed away.

 - @{b}Doors@{ub}
 There are two types of doors in the game:
   - Doors you need a @{"key" Link Collect 16} for (red, green, blue and yellow doors)
     Some doors are grey, so you don't know which kind of key you will need
   - Doors you can open/close using the blue switch

 - @{b}conveyor belt@{ub}
 Can be turned on/off using the green switch. Things lying on the belt will
 move!

 - @{b}Quicksand@{ub}
 Boulders may sink into and out of the quicksand.

 - @{b}Exit@{ub}
 a blue gate which starts flashing if you have enough Emeralds to enter.

 - @{b}Wheel@{ub}
 if you spin the Wheel, the @{"Robot" Link Enemies 13} will run towards the Wheel and not towards
 you. The Wheel only lasts for a few seconds.

 - @{b}Acidpool@{ub}
 everything that falls into the Acid is gone forever!

 - @{b}Switches@{ub}
   - the green Switch changes the direction of the conveyor belt
   - the blue switch open-/closes the switch-door

 - @{b}letters@{ub}
 you may read, ignor or bomb them away:-)

@ENDNODE

@NODE Collect "Things to collect"

 Of course just collecting Emeralds would be very easy (and very boring) so
 there are lots of other goodies to collect in the game:

 - two kinds of @{b}Emeralds@{ub} called Emeralds (green) and Diamonds (blue).
 Diamonds count as three Emeralds.

 - @{b}Dynamite@{ub} to blow away walls and monsters. Ignite the Dynamite by
 holding down your firebutton for a few seconds. Then run away!

 - A @{b}Forcefield@{ub} (yellow coin) to protect you. Your player-sprite will fade
 to grey while in protected mode. You will hear a special sound to indicate the
 forcefield going down because it only lasts for a few seconds

 - @{b}Extratime@{ub} (green coin) that will be added to your time

 - @{b}Keys@{ub}. There are four different types of keys (red, green, blue and
 yellow) which are necessary for the four different doors.


 @{" solid objects " Link Solid}

@ENDNODE

@NODE Enemies "Enemies"

 You are not alone in the Diamond Caves!
 Here are the enemies you might encounter:

 - @{b}Bug@{ub}
 crawling on the right wall, the Bug can be changed into 9 Emeralds and
 1 Diamond if crushed by a boulder

 - @{b}Spaceship@{ub}
 always moves on the left wall

 Touching the Bug or the Spaceship is very dangerous!

 - @{b}Robot@{ub}
 This one follows you until he can kill you!
 Try spinning the @{"Wheel" Link Solid 51} to divert the Robot.

 - @{b}Eater@{ub}
 This brother of Pacman will eat Diamonds and can be changed into various
 things (be surprised!) by shmashing him with a boulder

 - @{b}the amoeba@{ub}
 expands through normal sand and quicksand. Beware of the drops!
 Spaceships and Bugs won't survive contact with the amoeba.

  AGA-screenmodes and gfx with up to 256 colors. All you (or somebody else)
  need to do is to draw a 256 color version of the Diamond Caves gfx. This can
  be done using the program @{"DiamondGfx" Link "DC:DiamondGfx.guide/Main" 0}. DiamondGfx already
  includes a 32-color version of the orginial gfx as well as all the
  IFF-pictures you need.

@ENDNODE

@NODE q2 "Why do you use OS-routines? They are so slow!"

 Q:@{b}Why do you use OS-routines? They are so slow!@{ub}

 A:The reason for this is that about 1987 I bought the original Emerald
  Mine by Kingsoft (which inspired me to do Diamond Caves 7 years later).
  The problem with EM is, that it refuses to work under Kick2.0 and that it
  has some problems with 32bit-fast mem and fast processors. I didn't want
  to write a game that in a few years no one would be able to play because
  of crappy coding.

  OS-routines are not that slow, part of the lack of speed results in the
  fact that I tried to make everything as configurable as possible. Where
  most EM-clones use fixed values for screen- and playfield-size, my
  program adjusts to the Amiga it runs on and supports Level from 10x10 up
  to 100x100.

  Be sure to read @{"How can I improve game speed?" Link q4}.

@ENDNODE

@NODE q3 "Why can't I play new Levels?"

 Q:@{b}My friend has the Diamond Caves Leveleditor but my unregistered copy of
  Diamond Caves refuses to load the new levels. What am I doing wrong?@{ub}

 A:The unregistered version of Diamond Caves is not capable of loading
  other levels than the ones that came with the distribution.

 Since 1999, Diamond Caves I is freeware, just install v2.9 to get rid of
 these problems.

@ENDNODE

@NODE q4 "How can I improve game speed?"

 Q:@{b}How can I improve the speed of the game?@{ub}

 A:There are several things to make the game work faster:

  - use Kickstart 3.0 or 3.1 instead of Kick2.0. Some gfx-routines are up
  to 10 times faster in Kick3.x and under 3.x interleaved Bitmaps will be
  used, this improves gfx-speed.

  - don't use the gameport.device unless you have to, it's slower than
  directly accessing the hardware.

  - playing in Interlace is great if you have a 17" monitor but because I
  have to update 4 times the screensize than in non-Interlaced modes the
  game will be slower.

 - running a lot of programs in the background might consume important
 CPU-time.

 - the better the chipset, the higher the speed
 (ECS is not very fast, especially in interlace-modes,
  AGA is a bit faster than ECS,
  a gfx-board will give you full speed)

 - the better the processor, the higher the speed
 (you can run Diamond Caves on a 68000 but I recommend a 68020 as a minimum.
  I'm playing (and developing) Diamond Caves on a 68030 with 28MHz)

@ENDNODE

@NODE q5 "Why are some things different from the original Boulder Dash?"

 Q:@{b}I'm a big fan of the C64-game Boulder Dash, but in Diamond Caves some
  things are different. The amoeba won't change into Emeralds when
  surrounded by solid objects and Bugs (Butterflys in Boulder Dash) can't
  be killed by Emeralds.@{ub}

 A:Actually, Diamond Caves is a(nother) clone of the first Amiga-clone
  "Emerald Mine" by Kingsoft from 1987 and not a direct version of Boulder
  Dash. I don't want to change the handling of things in the game in future
  version because this might confuse current users.

  Because Diamond Caves is a 100% Emerald Mine clone, you have easy access to
  all the hundreds of old Emerald Mine Levels.

@ENDNODE

@NODE q6 "Where is the blue key in Game-Level 1?"

 Q:@{b}I'm new to Diamond Caves and I can't find that stupid :) blue key I
  need to enter the exit in Game-Level 1.@{ub}

 A:Have you played Tutorial-Level 14 (The Return of Pacman)? In this level,
  you're supposed to learn that the Eater holds many different things
  "inside". To get them, you have to smash him with a boulder. If you've
  looked at the preview picture of the Diamond Caves Editor you may even
  have seen that the Level displayed is Game-Level 1 and in the Eater-window
  you can see that the blue key is "in" the last (the 4th) Pacman.

  Short: You have to kill all four Eaters with a Boulder, not with a Bomb.

@ENDNODE

@NODE q7 "Is it possible to use old Emerald Mine Levels with Diamond Caves?"

 Q:@{b}I've got another Boulder Dash clone (insert your favorite one here) and
  I want to use previously created Levels in Diamond Caves. Is this
  possible?@{ub}

 A:Yes, this is possible. Since V1.1, the Diamond Caves Editor has an
  option to import Levels from these Boulder Dash clones:

  Balder's Grove
  Emerald Mine I
  Emerald Mine II
  Emerald Mine III
  Emerald Mines CD

@ENDNODE

@NODE q8 "The Joystick-Emulation in the Titlescreen does not work right."

 Q:@{b}The Joystick-Emulation in the Titlescreen does not work right.@{ub}

 A:I'm using the gameport.device as shown in the RKM Devices. The only reason,
  this can go wrong is if another program is using the gameport.device, too.
  Some Screenblankers (like BlitzBlank) check the Joystick-port as well to
  determine wether to blank or to stop blanking. For some reason, this
  interfears with my Joystick-routine. For now, please turn off switches like
  "Check Joystick" in Blitzblank.

@ENDNODE

@NODE q9 "I've got serious problems with Diamond Caves scrolling the screen!"

 Q:@{b}I've got serious problems with Diamond Caves scrolling the screen,
  sometimes the left/right borders get clipped!@{ub}

 A:This is a bug in graphics.library v39.x (Kick 3.0) and lower.
  For ECS-modes it is fixed in Kickstart3.1. For AGA-modes, there is no
  cure because it's a limitation of the AGA-chipset.

  Suggestion: Make the screen smaller or get a gfx-board.

 Q:@{b}Why is the scrolling not as smooth as in previous version of DC?@{ub}

  1. If the program needs more than one frame to update the screen, there will
  be a very short delay in the srolling (flicker).

  Suggestion: Free some CPU-time (close other applications) or get a faster
  processor :-)

  2. If you are not running in PAL-mode (50Hz), the scrolling will flicker
  because I'm updating the screen every 1/50 second wether or not the
  VBI-frequency is 50Hz. This is because the game should run at the same speed
  under every screenmode.

  Suggestion: Use PAL-modes or turn on the "VBI-timing" in @{"DiamondPrefs" Link "DC:DiamondPrefs.guide/Game" 52}.

 Q:@{b}Why is the scrolling so chunky when running under CyberGfx?@{ub}

 A:If you are running on a CyberGfx-screenmode, the horizontal scrolling
  will be a bit sticky because the current version of CyberGfx does not
  support smooth horizontal scrolling. CyberGfx only scolls every 4 pixels.
  Don't blame it on me, it's the fault of CyberGfx :-)

  Suggestion: Use a screenmode that's big enough to display the whole level at
  once or wait for a better scrolling-implementation in CyberGfx and use
  ECS/AGA-Screens in the meantime.
