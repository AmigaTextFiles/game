                           Module 'stringfunctions.m'

Well, i`m comming from Arexx and there are some functions wich i`m missing
in E. I just convert some functions to E and life is much easier now :-)

The functions:

-  words(string)

   Returns the number of words in the string

    bla:=words(string)
    WriteF('There are \d words in the string\n',bla)

- word(string,start)

  Returns a single word out of a string

   bla:=word(string,2)
   WriteF('The second word in the string is \s\n',bla)


- subword(string,start,length)

  Returns x words from the string, starting at pos start.

   bla:=subword(string,2,3)
   WriteF('The second word and the next 2 words in the string are \s\n',bla)

   or if length is 0

   bla:=subword(string,3,0)
   WriteF('The third word and the rest of the string is \s\n',bla)


- substr(string,start,length)

  Returns 'length' chars from the string starting from 'start'

   bla:=substr(string,5,3)
   WriteF('Char 5-7 in the string are \s\n',bla)

   or if length is 0

   bla:=substr(string,5,0)
   WriteF('Chars from 5 to the end of the string are \s\n',bla)

- delstr(string,start,length)

  Returns all but 'start to length' from the string

   bla:=delstr(string,5,3)
   WriteF('Char 1-4 and 8-end in the string are \s\n',bla)

   or if length is 0

   bla:=delstr(string,5,0)
   WriteF('Char 1-4 in the string are \s\n',bla)


Hope you like it.
Maybe i`m gonna translate some more functions and E becomes Arexx :-)
If you think there is a BUG feel free to mail me at ingo@night.de
