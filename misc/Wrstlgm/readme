TO RUN OFF FLOPPIES YOU NEED TO INSTALL SOME FILES FROM
YOUR WB DISK ONTO THE BOOT FLOPPY, TO RUN OFF THE HARD
DISK YOU NEED TO COPY IFF.LIBRARY FROM THIS ARCHIVE INTO
LIBS: AND MOOSE.FONT AND ITS SUBDIRECTORY INTO FONTS:!!!

THIS IS NOT THE SAME GAME AS THE Wrstldemo.lha archive also
distributed by Roger Uzun.  This is a complete game of
an older vintage, the Wrstldemo.lha is a newer program,
and is a playable demo only.

This is a freeware wrestling game for Amiga computers, it is VERY
old but works well on all amigas with 1M or more of FREE RAM.
It can be run from floppies or off a hard disk.
To run from floppies unlha the Wrstl1.lha archive onto a bootable
floppy, and the Wrstl2.lha archive onto another, and note
the startup-sequence provided.

Label the first disk as Wrestlinga
Label the 2nd disk as WCHARSB 
Label the disk during format or using the AmigaDOS Relabel 
command.
Floppy game requires diskfont.library and icon.library from
your Workbench disk to be in df0:libs as well. And for 1.3 systems 
it requires RAM-Handler from your WB L: Directory to be in the 
df0:l directory as well.

The game requires 1M of FREE RAM, if you have only 1M and use
a hard disk, you will not likely have enough free ram
to play the game.

The program requires the iff.library (provided) to be in 
your libs: directory, and requires all of the fonts provided
in the Wrstl1.lha archive to be in your fonts: directory.

You must copy all of the contents of the fonts directory
in this archive to your own fonts: directory, using the
copy ALL command option.  If you unlha'ed it into work: you
would do the following:

copy work:fonts fonts: all

to install all needed fonts.

You must copy iff.library to libs: as well.

Please see the 2 IFF files provided for some sort of documentation
on the game.  The icons provided to view them look for multiview,
if you do not have multiview then edit the default tool in the
icon to point to some IFF viewer you do have.

It is an old game, but runs well and is fun, has many moves.
It is enforcer/mungwall/memory leak clean, and DOES
multitask well.


Game can be played in 1 player 2 player or demo mode.
In DEMO mode the computer will compete as one of the
wrestlers, against other computer opponents, use
this mode to look for strategies.

There are 2 CLI args and tooltypes available for startup options,
NOSOUND means no sound when started, NOSOUNDEVER means no sound
ever possible.  Ctrl-S to toggle sound on/off during play
Ctrl-R to go back to main menu during play, <ESC> to pause
play, CTRL-Q to quit at any time.

The figure 4 leglock can force you or your opponent to submit,
ending the match.
