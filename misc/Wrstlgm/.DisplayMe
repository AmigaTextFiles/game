   >>>READ the README file, and look at Wrdox.iff and Wrdox2.iff<<<
To run from hard disk you >>>MUST<<< copy the iff.library from this archive
into your libs: directory and the moose.font from this archive to your fonts: 
directory, do not forget about the subdirectory for the moose font, as well 
as the moose.font file itself.  For example, if you unlha the contents of
Wrstl1.lha and Wrstl2.lha into work:wrstl, you will need to do the following 
to prepare your system for running the program:

Copy Work:Wrstl/fonts fonts: all
copy work:wrstl/libs/iff.library libs:

From floppies you will need to know enough to create a bootable disk and 
get some files from your workbench disk.  For Floppy systems you will need 
to label a blank disk as Wrestlinga using the relabel command, and unlha 
all of Wrstl1.lha onto this disk, (use install to make it bootable).  Then 
copy diskfont.library and icon.library from a WB disk onto wrestlinga:libs.
For 1.3 KS you also will need to copy Ram-Handler into Wrestlinga:l
(it can be found on your WB disk).  You will also need a 2nd floppy,
label it (using relabel) WcharsB. Then unlha the contents of 
Wrstl2.lha onto this 2nd floppy.
