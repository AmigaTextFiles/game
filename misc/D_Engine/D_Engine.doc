REQUIREMENTS: 	Amiga capable to display 256-color-screens and OS 3.0
		MC68020+
		(Does even run on unexpanded A1200 (not all levels)
		 and probably on ECS/OCS Amigas with GFX-Board(not tested))
		
USAGE:
	Start D_Engine.exe with DOOM[2].WAD in the current directory!
	The engine will generate 2 tables (sintab and arctantab) in
	the current directory (this can take a while if you have a
	slow cpu without fpu) for the first time.

	Use addbuffers for the current partition to speed up loading!

ARGUMENTS:
	DOOM2MODE/S,PATCHWADS/M

	DOOM2MODE switches to DOOM2 level-naming (MAPxy) (requires DOOM2.WAD)
		  the engine searchs for DOOM.WAD first and if it is not
		  found switchs to DOOM2MODE automatically

	PATCHWADS Patch-WADs to be added (e.g. D_Engine.exe pwads/forest.wad)
		  You should only use DOOM1 patches for DOOM.WAD and
		  DOOM2 patches for DOOM2.WAD


KEYS:	CURSOR KEYS: movement

	+/-(Numeric Keypad): change screen size
			64x40 - 320x200 (default:192x120)

	ENTER(Numeric Keypad):change C2P-algorithm
			*WritePixelArray8 is default, because the other 
			 c2p-routines will probably crash on GFX-Boards.
			 Although I have not tested this engine
			 on GFX-Boards (I think it should run)
			
			*The Blitter-C2P is for 68040- ;-}
			
			*AFAIK only 68060 benefit from the CPU-C2P
				(coded by Ulf Sénéchal)

	0-9 (NOT Numeric Keypad): select level to load
			 e.g. type 3 2 to load E3M2 (Episode 3 Mission 2)
			 or MAP32 for DOOM2.WAD
			 (starts with E1M1 or MAP01)

	ESC:Quit


The wadview utility was only created to help me in the development of
the engine.
For usage or bugs have a look at the source or move it to NIL: ;-}
