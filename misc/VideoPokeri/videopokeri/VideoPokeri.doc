o What is this game?

    This is my version of normally coin-playable video poker game.

    This product is a giftware.  If you like it and use it please
    send me a gift (foreign paper money is preferred because I collect
    them... no matter of amount.)  My address is at the end of this doc.


o Why this game is better than the other similars?

    - fully multitasking
    - works on (almost) any Amiga
    - very user friendly (only mouse necessary)
    - user definable sounds (IFF-8SVX)
    - sounds can be set ON or OFF
    - possible to quit
    - nice graphics
    - English and Finnish supported


o System requirements

    - AmigaDOS 1.3 +
    - at least 200 kB of memory (depends on amount of sounds)
    - PAL screen (256 lines high)
    - diskfont.library at LIBS:
    - topaz.font size 11 at FONTS:


o Tested on

    - A500 ½ MB Chip, KS 1.3
    - A500 1 MB Chip + 2 MB, KS 2.1
    - A500 1 MB Chip, KS 3.1
    - A3000 2 MB Chip + 2 MB, KS 2.0
    - A3000 2 MB Chip + 4 MB, KS 3.0


o Usage

    Workbench

    - double-click the icon
    - tool types are not supported, sorry
        -> sounds are always loaded
        -> startup language is always English

    CLI

    - [run] VideoPokeri [s] [1|2] , where 
                                    s = silencio = sounds are not loaded
                                    1 = startup language is Finnish
                                    2 = startup language is English (default)

    - 's' option is worth of trying if the memory is low
    - if sounds are loaded you can disable/enable them by pressing 's'
      within the game
    - language can be changed within the game by pressing '1' or '2'


o How to play?

    General

    - The goal is to get much money
    - Just use the pointer (with mouse) to play this game
    - Rules are defined according to standard poker game (if you
      don't know how to play poker, see e.g. enclyclopedia or 'book
      of games' or something else)
    - You can press the buttons below when they are illuminated
      (the color is lighter)
    - If you have won more than 50 credits, the screen will flash
      purple every time you win more
    - Sounds can be disabled/enabled at any time by pressing 's'
      letter (not with the mouse :)
    - The language can be changed before first set of the cards is
      dealt by pressing '1' for Finnish and '2' for English
    - Possible highscores can be saved to the disk when you decided
      to quit the game
    - You can quit the game by pressing 'q' letter.  NOTE: save your
      credits before quitting!!  See instructions below.


    The play

    - When the game starts you have 50 credits to play
    - You can change the bet by pressing blue 'BET' button or the 'coin'
    - Press 'DEAL' button to deal the first set of cards (or you can press
      the right mouse button to deal no matter where the pointer is)
    - Put cards you want to leave to 'HOLD' by pressing the card
      (you can unhold the card by pressing it again)
    - Deal second set of cards and hope that you win
    - If you win, you can get the prize or try to double it, select
      either 'DOUBLE' or 'WINS'
    - If you decided to risk, you have two possibilities to guess:
      press 'SMALL' if you think that the card is small, 1 - 6,
      or press 'BIG' if you think the card is big, 8 - 13
    - If the double-card id 7, you lose always
    - When you are out of credits, screen will turn to green.  You
      can start the next game by pressing the box in the upper left
      corner 'CREDITS 0'.  That gives you another 50 credits.
    - You can save your credits to the disk (highscore) by pressing
      the box in upper right corner 'WINS XXX' or box at the bottom
      'WINS'.  If you have enough credits the requester will open.  
      NOTE: Your wins will be reset to zero at the moment you enter
      the highscore requester.


o How to define your own sounds?

    This is easy: take you favourite IFF-samples and copy them over
    the existing ones in the 'sounds' directory.

    The names of the soundfiles must remain as they were.

    Explanation of meaning of soundfiles:

    - Filename          --  Event when the sound is played

    - HoldON.8svx       --  The card is pressed to 'HOLD' it
    - HoldOFF.8svx      --  The card is pressed to unhold it
    - Bet.8svx          --  The bet is changed
    - Counting.8svx     --  Sound of coin tinkle
    - DoubleOK.8svx     --  Double the win was successful
    - DoubleFail.8svx   --  The quess was not right
    - CardOFF.8svx      --  The card is removed from the deck
    - Deal.8svx         --  The cards are dealt
    - GameOver.8svx     --  The game is over
    - DoubleStart.8svx  --  You are going to win The Big Prize
    - BigWin.8svx       --  You just won The Big Prize
