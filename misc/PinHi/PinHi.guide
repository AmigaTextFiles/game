So you've got Pinball Illusions installed on your harddisk (I hope for
you that you've got it legally...). You've set dozens of new highscores,
you've beaten all those default highscores and so on. Imagine now that a
friend calls up and asks you about your highscore on Law 'n Justice. You
have a huge animation rendered by your Amiga thus not be able to run PI
and have a short glance at the highscores. What now? You could run your
hex-viewer and look up the highscores. Highly Uncomfortable :) You could
run PinHi and swoosh, look up all highscores at once. What is the better
alternative?

You need only run PinHi from Shell/CLI to have a look at the highscores.
Another possibility is to redirect PinHi's output to your printer or
into a file - thus you could show your great great highscores off to
everybody ;-)

PinHi was written using Amiga E, the amazing language by Wouter van
Oortmerssen. The source is included in the archive and can be compiled with
Amiga E 2.1b or higher (I hope).

For the ones who still don't know: Pinball Illusions is the third (and
very likely the last) part of the Pinball-trilogy by DI. It does NOT in
any other way than the publisher (21st century) relate to the game
Pinball Mania, which is given away with the new A1200s by Amiga
Technologies. Pinball Mania sucks big time and is NOT recommended. It is
a HUGE disappointment.

PI is great fun and can only be recommended to everyone. The ones who
want to maintain a glimmer of hope for a fourth part should buy PI
instead of pirating it. That's what Digital Illusions' Frederik
Liliegren said on this topic...

"We usally start out with a vague idea of what we want to do, then we make a
small preview showing the basics of the game, this demo is then showed to the
most interesting publishers.  If any of them gets interested we will sign a
contract, get some money, miss all deadlines with 6-10 months and then end up
seeing our game pirated to death within 2 days of release.

And that piracy is another reason for dropping the AMIGA, if we sold as many
units of our games as there are people out there enjoying our efforts we would
only be working on the AMIGA!!!"

But it will not only be your fault as a pirate...

"Sad to say with the current status of Commodore I do not see our selves
committing to another Amiga project after completing Benefactor and Pinball
Illusions.  The reason is very very simple, It takes us 1 year to develop a
game and in a years time the Amiga market is not going to be able to support
us finacially i.e. we would loose money doing an Amiga game.  

Another reason is that within a years time there is going to be 2-3
machines available on the market that technically is 100-200 times as
powerful for games as the A1200 and CD32. And due to the fact that we
are visionaries and want to do the best possible job, the current Amiga
hardware can not compete."

Although this was written while Commodore was still in the liquidation
process it *is* sad.
