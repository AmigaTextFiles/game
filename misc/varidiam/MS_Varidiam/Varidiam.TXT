QUICK NOTE
==========

If you already visited my WWW you will find some similar texts. Skip paragraphs
and check only the instructions and other things. Sorry for the mistake.
I will fix this in the AmigaGuide version.

GAME DECRIPTION
===============

I began the project 10 months ago (March 1996), some days after the ending of
FRONTLINE VII Amiga Party (a copyparty which we organize in Peru).

The game is based on the videogame "Gundam F-91" (SNES) and "Macross" (Turbo Grafx)
and features manga style graphics.

MOBILE SUIT VARIDIAM ED-109 (the successor of the prototype Biosmech XFF-32D that
get destroyed five months ago while fly testing), is a STOP-MOTION game.
This means that while playing you must take on-the-fly decisions in order to see
a result, a mix of probabilities and game conditions that will be presented to the
player as quick animations in the Cinema Display area.

There are two game areas: the Strategy Map and the Combat Section.

STRATEGY MAP
------------

Is like playing chess. You must pick and move your Mobile Suit into another sector
each turn. Pay attention to enemy waves as they will try to reach and destroy
SYNCHROCITY (your only Spaceship). You must also take care of your partners
(CPU controlled): they will help you in the battle but if they performance is very
low they can be destroyed by the enemies.

Note #1 : "SYNCHROCITY" is still under R&D.
Note #2 : Mobile Suit for CPU partners are fully working but are not included
          in this release for two reasons:
          A) the pilots are still being trained... 
          B) I'm still waiting the approval for the Electromagnetic
             Noise Emission Limits (ENEL) tests as defined in the
             radio interference regulations of the Novatron Department
             of Comunications (You must consider that every Mobile Suit
             is generating about 2000-3000 Kw.)

COMBAT SECTION
--------------

Moving points in the radar (right side) represent each enemy of the wave.
Your position is always at the center of the radar. You must locate as quick
as possible at least - one enemy - in the LOCK ZONE (the red dotted area)
if you wish to attack.

The two blue circles (three areas) in the radar represent the THREE RANGE ATTACK:
SHORT, MED and LONG distance. This is one of the most important factors when selecting
a weapon. As an example, a simple MachineGun isn't effective at long distances while
a Beam Saber is only effective for short range attack.

You must also consider that there are more probabilities to hit an enemy mech when flying
at short distance than med or long distance, if you use the right weapon.

But pay attention! While flying in the sector trying to lock enemy mechs they will also
attack you!

WEAPON SELECTION / ATTACK

After locking some enemy in the lock-zone, you must press fire to stop the action and
select the weapon you wish to use. The Cinema Display will show the enemy flying, and
in the right section of the pannel will appear some information of the enemy, like its
speed, damage, weight, generator. The colour of the enemy mech reflects its performance
(if it's red this means that it's about to be destroyed).

--> Don't forget that weapons are NOT effectives in all attack ranges! 

--> Some weapons use the special WPG (Weapon Power Generator) that your Mobile Suit
    is equipped whit, while others will use bullet rounds. This information is shown in
    the GEN/WEP label.

SPECIAL CINEMAMA SCENES:

Some Cinema Scenes after an Enemy's attack may be "influenced" by the player simply making
the RIGHT movement of the joystick in the RIGHT time! (like Dragon's Lair)
But Remember! Only a FEW scenes can be played, others are only animation results.

In the present demo there are only two  Cinema Player Evasive Scenes, and only ONE can be
"played". I won't tell you which scene is.

KEYS:

In the Combat Section if you press SPACE BAR while selecting a weapon you will brake the
attack. Pressing it while flying in the sector will return you to the Strategy Map and
complete your turn.
In the Strategy Section by pressing ESC will exit the game.

ABOUT THIS DEMO

I'm getting bored of working without receiving moral support, so I decided to upload this demo
to receve some suggestions, comments and criticism. After all, it's my first videogame for
Amiga and I wish to know how many people likes my game...

A list of all features to be implemented can be found in the Varidiam Homesite.

Next releases will include of course MORE WEAPONS and MORE CINEMA DISPLAYS....
