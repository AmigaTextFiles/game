                             Brief Instructions

Most of the game is easy to get into. I've tried to make it really user
friendly so you should be able to play without too much help.

1. To use an object, LEFT click on its name in your inventory.
   eg. Click on a gun to weild it ready for combat.
       Click on a grenade to throw it.
       Click on a key while facing a door to open/close it.

2. To fire...
   a) Click on the name of the gun in your hand (just above the inventory).
   b) Pick a snap or an aimed shot.
   c) You are now in fire mode (the pointer is a cross). The cross will only
   appear in places where you can fire (you may shoot through windows).
   d) LEFT click to fire.
   e) RIGHT click to abort (return to move mode).

3. To move, move the pointer to a square. A box should appear around it (if
   you have a line of movement). Just LEFT click to move there.
   To move around corners, you might have to move in stages becuase you may
   only move in straight lines.

4. To face a direction, point somewhere (no box neccesary) and RIGHT click
   while in move mode.

5. To get information on an object, RIGHT click on its name in your
   inventory.

6. Fire and Flame.
   Fire has 7 different intensities. When you step onto a firey sqaure, you
   will lose intensity*2 energy points (ie 2-14 points). You also lose this
   if you end a turn on a firey square. Fire does spread but also dies out
   after a few turns.

7. LOOK at the enemy to see what they are carrying and how they look by
   clicking on them when in move mode. You must be able to see them !!!

8. Vison options...
   Settable on title screen (straight forward)

9. Doors and terminals.
   Stand next to a door and click on it to open it (or you could USE a key).
   Stand next to a broken terminal and click on it to attempt a repair.
   Stand next to a fixed terminal and click to access it.

10. The icons.
    Quit - Quit game
    Pickup
    Drop
    Recharge currently weilded weapon (you can use your energy to recharge
    your gun, but it might explode....)
    View enemy - show the last enemy seen/discovered.
  * And the most important ones ....
  * Next man - go to the next player.
  * Centre man.
  * End turn - end your turn after moving all of your team.

11. Anything else ?
    a) SHOT IS DEFLECTED means you've hit an unlucky spot and done NO damage
    b) You NEVER miss when standing next to an enemy (like real life).
    c) You can plant REMEX only on your current square. USE the detonator to
       explode it.
    d) Note that you cannot throw grenades directly at walls, only onto
       floors or enemies. Normal explosives (rockets/shells) can be fired at
       walls of course.
    e) You may shoot dropped grenades to detonate them. Shooting Ammo has
       an interesting result.
    f) LEFT Clicking while scrolling the screen will jump the scroll to its
       extreme which is useful on slower machines.
