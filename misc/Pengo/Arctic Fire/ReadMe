	If you remember the fun from playing those classic games like Pac Man,
you will love this new and improved version of "Pengo". The object of the
game is easy: kill the fires that invaded the arctic to save the Poles :) from
melting down. You are one of those cutsy little penguins who tries to
accomplish this difficult task. Are you up to the challenge?
