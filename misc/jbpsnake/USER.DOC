Welcome to the JBPSnakeGame!  This game is based on an old time favorite

that I have played on machines ranging from UNIX or VM mainframes down to

my still running RadioShack model I.  I hope you will enjoy this port as 

much as I do!  John Preston of Amiga DEPOT BBS (319)385-7412

         ------------============= RULES: =============------------

There are four basic rules to the game:

1) Don't run into the wall

2) Don't run the snake across it's own tail.

3) Don't run the snake backwards (try to make it swallow itself :).

4) Score as many points by hitting the numbers before they dissapear.


      ------------============= DIRECTIONS: =============------------
                                                                          
The Directions are simple.

1) When you first start the game you are brought to the main menu where
   you have three selections to choose from.

   [A] is Alltime High Scores.  This shows you the 15 best scores.
   [P] is to start the game.
   [Q] is to quit the program.

2) To move the snake press the numbers 4,8,6 or 2.  These correspond to
   the directions Left, Up, Right and Down.  If you have a NUMERIC KEYPAD
   on your computer make sure it is in numeric mode (for you MSDOS types)
   and use the KEYPAD because it is easy to control the snake if you do.

                          UP
                       7  8  9
                  LEFT 4  5  6 RIGHT 
                       1  2  3
                         DOWN
                                                                          

3) You only need to press a direction key once to start snake moving.  The
   snake will continue to move at a rate of about 3 characters per second
   at 14400 baud.  If you wish the snake to move faster simply press and 
   hold the number corresponding to the direction you wish to move.  But
   look out!  At slower baud rates and large modem buffer sizes, you can
   cause the modem to buffer many keypresses and thus get the snake moving
   so fast that you cannot get it to change directions in time!!

4) If you wish to quit the game at any time press CTRL-C and you will be
   taken back to the main menu where you can press Q to exit.

5) If while you are playing the game you should get some lines noise or the
   modem or terminal program drops characters, you may press R to REDRAW
   the screen.  This is a BIG problem with MSDOS machines running at 9600
   and above when using the program QMODEM or TELEMATE if the machine is
   16mhz or less.
