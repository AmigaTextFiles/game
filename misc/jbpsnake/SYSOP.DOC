Hello SYSOP!  Thank you for installing the JBPSnakeGame on your BBS.

Installation is easy.  I will give you the rundown for installing it

for the DLG BBS/OS but XENOLINK should be just as simple.

1)  Create a directory for these files to go and copy JBPSnakeGame, USER.DOC
    and SYSOP.DOC into the directory.

2)  Edit your S:User-Startup or whatever script you use to start the BBS
    (I edited S:Dialog.Start), and add the line

    ASSIGN JBP_SNAKEGAME: <the dir where you placed the game>

3)  Login to the BBS and go into the SYSOP menu and Config the menu where
    you keep your games and create a new menu item called JBP Snake Game.
    Choose Executable and then enter the following for the path...

    JBP_SnakeGame:JBPSnakeGame %UNAME

(NOTE: NON-DLG sysops replace %UNAME with whatever token is used for the 
       user name.  If you have problems with this contact me at my BBS).

    Be sure to choose CLI and all the rest of the stuff for a CLI based 
    door and your set.

4)  In a future version of JBPSnakeGame, the user will be allowed to read
    the user.doc from within the program, however if you also wish to
    copy the user.doc to the DLGCONFIG:Menu/MENUNAME/HELPKEY directory
    then they can read the supplied docs online by selecting MENU HELP.

If you or your users feel this game is worth $10 and would like to see more
programs from me or timely fixes or changes to this program *PLEASE* send
your contributions to
