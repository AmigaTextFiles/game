	Welcome to Super Battle Zone (SBZ) a 3D shoot-em-up but let's cut 
the talk short and get down to business.
	
	When you first load up SBZ you should be presented with a menu. 
All you have to do now is click required option.

START - This will start the game but you will not be able to get back to 
	  this menu after you've done that, unless you reset your computer 
        of course.

OBJECTS - This should let you see all the 3D objects used in this game. 
	    You can advance to another one by clicking on next or see  
	    previous object by simply clicking on previous. If you get 
	    bored of this you can exit by clicking on icon under the same 
	    name.

CREDITS - This is the second most important part of this game and if you 
	    haven't seen it yet you should do it right now.

QUIT - Clicking on it will simply exit the game and return you the 
	 environment that this game that this game has been started in.

	The main objective of this game is to kill as many objects as 
possible while avoiding their bullets. In the right hand corner you will 
see what we call radar and the small dot on it represents the enemy that 
you suppose to destroy. One way of doing it is to turn so he's in the 
middle of the screen (or right in front of you on the radar) and shoot 
by pressing fire. If you fail to kill the sucker for some reason (as it 
is possible as he moves, turns around and your bullets have limited 
range) you should repeat the above procedure. If you still can't get it 
then there's something wrong with you. If you destroy enough baddies 
you'll qualify for the next level which will look different and have 
different objects each with its unique speed, intelligence and the 
firing range and time. And now some explanations on what is going on on 
the screen. In the right hand corner is a score counter showing how many 
points you've got. Blow in the bottom right corner there is a speed 
display showing you how fast and in which direction you are going. If 
the indicator is positive then your moving forward and if it's negative 
then you're going backwards. On the other side in the left bottom 
corner, 
there's a damage indicator. When this baby hits 100 then you're history 
and you have to start the whole game from the beginning. This is done by 
pressing the fire button when the computer tells you to. Well that's 
about all you need to know to play this game but you probably figured 
all that out by yourself.


	If you want to contact us for some strange reason like donating 
some money you are more then welcome. If you send $10-20 (the more the  
better) you'll be guaranteed another release on which we are currently 
working. I won't tell you what it is but is has a lot to do with 
choppers and it too is in full 3D. Unfortunately I cannot give you the 
exact date it will be out in PD as I am doing Year 12 and others are in 
Uni but I can guarantee that we're working full time and hopefully it 
should be out this year. If you don't want to send any money you still 
are welcome to contact us for any strange reason that you may have. (for 
example swapping ideas, suggestions about our stuff, etc.). You'll also 
receive greeting in our next release. So if you want to contact us write 
to:

	Maciek Sawicki
	14 Oberon Street
	Dandenong North 3175 Vic
	Melbourne, Australia

	You can also call me on (03) 795 9679 if you must but please do it 
reasonable hours like between 5pm and 11pm as this is the most likely 
time I'll be available.
