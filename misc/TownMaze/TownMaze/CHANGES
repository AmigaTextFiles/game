CHANGES -- change record for townmaze

v 1.2 23 April 1991

CHANGES

  Updated this file.

patchlevel.h

  Set to patchlevel 2.

closegates.c

  Fixed two bugs in gatewalking code that was stepping outside the cmaze[]
  limits, thanks to a bug report and patch supplied by Stefan M. Linnemann
  <crissl@rulcvx.LeidenUniv.nl>.  Added comments to a few associated lines.

makeunused.c

  The 59 condition check in the do{}while loop's condition was overflowing
  parse buffers on some smaller compilers, so it has now become a separate
  routine, wimpy_cc() <Heh!> internal to makeunused.c.  Thanks for reports
  from dwade@jarthur.Claremont.edu and rmk@rmkhome.uucp (Rick Kelly) of the
  problem.

townmaze.test

  Clarified the descriptions for two tests; I'd muddled the effect a
  courtyard or its lack could produce in a small maze.

townpgmr.doc

  Updated to reflect the changes in makeunused.c.

v 1.1 20 April 1991

CHANGES

  Added this file.

patchlevel.h 

  Added, set at patchlevel 1.

townmaze.test

  Added a script file that tests all the error returns from getargs().

makespace.c 

  Fixed a horrid bug that should have dumped core in testing, and did show
  problems for Glenn E. Host.  When creating space for cmaze[][], I was
  allocating "mazeheight" char * pointer slots, but then using "mazewidth"
  of them to hold the pointers, by using a bad loop limit,  Sigh.  Worked
  perfectly fine on my two brain damaged machines.  Thanks, Glenn.

getarg.c 

  Added errctr and quit_reasons[] code to give exit reasons when a bad
  parameter is read, inspired by and mostly using unfinished code forwarded
  by Glenn E. Host.  Thanks, Glenn!

  Thus inspired, improved interface for reporting other bad parameter
  conditions,

  Reordered switch checks to correspond with usage.c parameter order.

  Added missing guard against negative -u (unused cell) parameter.

  Fixed incomplete test for sscanf() return values to test against 0 as
  well as EOF.

  Fixed bad math in unused cell fit test and gate fit test.  Sigh.

makestreet.c

  Added check to assure that a LIVE cell is never created as neighbor to
  an UNUSED cell. Since no STREET cell can ever be a neighbor of an UNUSED
  cell, the cell should not be LIVE and thus eligible for use in phase one
  of connectstreets().  Now they get changed from ISOLATED and remain DEAD.

townpgmr.doc

  Updated to reflect changes in .c files

townuser.doc

  Updated to reflect improved interface.

README

  Updated to describe townmaze.test.

v 1.0 18 April 1991 Original Release
