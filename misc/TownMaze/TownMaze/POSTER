Sorry to be so slow at this, but enough folks asked for it I thought
I'd better go ahead and clean up the hacked up mess it began as.  It
now compiles, with only make file changes, on an ANSI C and an old
C compiler on two different architectures/OSs, so perhaps most of the
portability problems will be small ones.  No longer a slave to #defines,
it now has 8 optional command line parameters, malloc()s its work space,
frees it on exit(), and otherwise behaves itself.  It's also grown huge,
from 30K when it first worked as one monolithic file to around 170K now,
aided and abetted by over 50K of documentation, and lots of overhead
from make files and splitting the files out and putting in prototypes
and such stuff.  Enough whining; give this kid a job!  An excerpt from
the README file follows, and then part one of the shar.  This is a
vanilla cshar makekit production (thanks as always to Rich Salz) in four
parts.

Townmaze -- A Program to Design "Bard's Tale I"-Style City Mazes

Copyright 1991 by Kent Paul Dolan, Mountain View, CA, USA 94039-0755

This program was written in response to a request in USENet newsgroup
rec.games.programmer for "code that designs a town-shaped maze like the
town Bard's Tale I uses"; you be the judge how well it does; I'm quite
proud of the result. The goal is not a great "pencil and paper" maze,
but instead a fun town for a 3D dungeon crawl game to incorporate.
Here's a tiny (7/64 the size of the BT-I town) example output, big ones
look better:

There are now _lots_ of command line parameters; (continued in README file).
