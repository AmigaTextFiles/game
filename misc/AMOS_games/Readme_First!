         MAZE MANIA and FANTASY TRADE
              General Information
              -------------------


  These two games have been created using AMOS 1.3 and compiled with AMOS
Compiler (what else?) They can be accessed both from WorkBench and CLI,
though while accessing from CLI you should first CD to the games disk.

  The games differ tremendously in size - not in actual size, but relative
size - programming Maze Mania took 8 months and 27 days, while Fantasy Trade
was finished in 16 days! Their actual sizes differ very little: 112 kB & 137
kB.

  While playing them, do take advantage of their two special features:
saveable highscores and speech! The highscores are saved in files called
"MMscores" and "FantasyScores". If the programs don't find them, they create
them. To turn on/off the speech, press ctrl-s.

  Now, let us discuss the credits a little. The games have been created by
me and are ShareWare. If you like them and decide to keep them, fine. If you
don't like them, why not? If you like them AND wish to obtain new stuff,

If you are one of them, you will recognise yourself. If you aren't, you
probably won't recognise any of them.


  Tee hee! That's the serious part over - here's a bit where we can have
some fun! I will now tell you a joke. Be warned, it won't suit just
everybody! If you don't like dirty jokes, skip it over. Here goes...

  - A man came home early from work and found his wife naked in the bedroom.
He asked her:
  "Why don't you have any clothes on?"
  "I have nothing to wear", said the wife.
  "Yes you have", said the man, looking into the wardrobe, "here you have a
red dress, a yellow one - hello Harry - a green dress and..."
