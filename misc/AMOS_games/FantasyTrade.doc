                      Playing instructions


- 1: Background -
  The year is 3093. Parallel worlds have been found and visited by someone
called Z. Columbus exactly 1600 years after America's discovery. The idea of
getting to know the natives still remains the same: give them gifts and
trade with them. You have been chosen for this task. Equipped with 30 000
currency units (cu) and 50 units of Earth Goods you enter a parallel
dimension and are to stay there for 30 years.

- 2: The Playground -
  There are 8 "kingdoms" on the play area, ranging from Faerytale via Boring
and Medieval to Scary. Each of them has its own trading article, which
differs in price. You can sell them items, or buy their items.
  On the brown control panel you will find four control buttons: Buy, Sell,
Stats and Quit.
  The Quit should be obvious, it just quits the game. But notice, if you quit
before the time limit is up, your money will be reduced. Pressing the other
buttons takes you to secondary screens.
  Clicking on a kingdom picture selects that kingdom for trading companion.
Clicking on an article button selects that article for trading. Please
ignore the great big "YOU!", for that is there only to remind you you're
there as well.

- 3: The Stats Screen -
  The second most basic screen after the main screen is the Stats screen.
Here, various variables can be viewed. On the top of the screen, you will be
shown the current game month. It is changed every 2.5 seconds, so the full
30 years will be 15 minutes.
  Underneath the month display is the money status display. It simply tells
you the money situations of the 8 kingdoms and you, in the form of a bar
chart. Underneath the bars is a slider, this is called the "scale" slider.
Sliding it will change the bar chart's scale.
  Moving downwards, we find the supplies display. This shows your supplies
of all 9 items. Clicking on them will display their current price. Finally,
there are the "event message" option button and the "exit" button. The
"event message" button toggles the messages for the random events.

- 4: Trading -
  Clicking on either "Buy" or "Sell" will greet you with a secondary screen.
On the top of the screen you will find the name of the article to trade.
  The main feature of this screen is the bar chart. This shows you both the
kingdom's and your supplies of the item, and a slider controlling the amount
to buy/sell. If you buy/sell too much, the king will tell you about it, and
will take care of it immediately.
  Click on either "Buy" / "Sell" or "Cancel" to return. Obviously, if you
cancelled the screen, no trading will be performed.

- 5: Random Events -
  The parallel world depends greatly on its sun and its moon. The sun
controls the "light" side, and the moon controls the "dark" side. Sometimes,
a conjuction or an eclipse might happen.
  The conjuctions and the eclipses only affect the prices of the items. An
eclipse will halve prices, and a conjuction will double them. Only one event
of a kind may be active at a time, and they last for 6 months. (Each of the
4 kinds of event may be active at once, but only one of a kind.)
  Also note that each month, a tax is collected and every kingdom (including
you) will lose 0.2 % of its wealth.

- 6: The Magnificent Seven -
  If (or when) you quit, or the time limit is up, you will be shown the
"Magnificent Seven" screen. This is basically a highscore table, which
displays the seven wealthiest players. It will be saved to disk every time
you want it to.
  Underneath the table is a space for you to type your name (should you be
skilful enough to achieve a highscore), and two buttons: "New Game" and
"Quit Out". It should be quite obvious what these do.

- 7: Other Features -
  Occasionally, a kingdom will only offer half the money for a neighbouring
kingdom's item, or double the money for a faraway item.
  Try only to sell valuable items to wealthy kingdoms. For example, it would
be pointless to try to sell fairy dust to the Faerytale kingdom.
  The game includes speech. To toggle it on/off, press Ctrl-s.
  During a secondary screen, the game is paused. This of course prolongs the
15 minutes needed for the game.
  Try not to have heaps of colours and fairy dust, for because of their
stable price, you are unable to make a large profit from them.
  You will need lots of money and articles at the start, so sell your goods
to a wealthy kingdom and purchase a little articles. You should buy lots of
cheap items, e.g. snow, and very little of expensive ones, e.g. monsters.
  Enjoy this game! If you like it and wish to obtain new games, write to me.
