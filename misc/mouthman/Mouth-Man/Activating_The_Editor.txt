                   Mouth-Man - Activating the Maze Editor

When at the main menu screen, move the highlight to the 'Maze Editor' option.
Hold down the right mouse button,  then the left mouse button,  then the fire
button and finally move the joystick left.  Hold everything in this state for
a few seconds, and you should see the 'Maze Editor' menu screen appear!
