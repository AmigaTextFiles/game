*** Disclaimer. *************************************************************

Use this program at your own risk. I take NO responsibility for any loss off
data, corrupted drives, exploding monitors, electrical shocks, overheated
joysticks, sleepless nights, bad school results, crying girlfriends etc.



*** What is it? *************************************************************

SnakeMan is one of the most addictive games I've ever played! It is based
around a game called Oil's Well on the C64. It didn't exist on the Amiga, so
I decided to make it myself.

The game looks a little bit like Pacman (you have to eat all the points in the
playing field, before time runs out), but you've got a fulnerable tail.



*** Installation. ***********************************************************

This is easy: just copy all the files to a directory on a (hard-)disk.
This directory must then be assigned SnakeMan: and should contain the following
files:

  SnakeMan          - the program
  SnakeMan.info     - the .info file for the program
  SnakeMan.Doc      - this doc file
  SnakeMan.Doc.info - the .info file for the doc file
  SnakeMan.Intro    - data for the intro
  SnakeMan.Game     - data for the game
  HighScores        - this one is NOT neccesary (the game will create one)
  < Levels >        - this is a directory, containing all the level information
                      (there are 10 levels at the moment)

You start the game by double-clicking on its icon.

The program was tested on the following machines:
  A500  - 0.5 Mb Chip Ram; 1.5 Mb Fast Ram; WB 2.0
  A1200 - 2.0 Mb Chip Ram; 4.0 Mb Fast Ram; 28 MHz 68EC020 (Blizzard 1220/4)
  A3000 - 2.0 Mb Chip Ram; 8.0 Mb Fast Ram; 25 MHz 68030 + FPU (thanks Jeroen!)

Actually, the game doesn't run smooth on a 68000 machine. ( One more reason to
upgrade to a beter system ;-)  ).

I want to thank Jeroen Oudejans for Beta-testing this product and for some
hints and ideas!



*** The gameplay. ***********************************************************

Controlling the snake:
 - push the joystick in any direction and you will go that way, but you can't
   walk through the walls or your tail.
 - press fire to go back.

There are also some 'devils' in the game who kills you if they hit your tail.
You can kill them by eating them! This will also increase your score with 5
points (one point is the field increases the score with just one point).
Beware that these nasty guys can walk through the walls.

Sometimes, some bonus items appears on the screen (which disappear after 12
seconds). This bonus can be: a coin      = 100 extra points
                             a sandglass = 30 seconds extra time 
                             a heart     = a new life!

In all levels, there are some flashing points (bigger than the usual ones).
If you eat these points, the bad guys will run at half speed for 10 seconds.
You can see this because their heads will be blue. After 10 seconds, you hear
an alarm and the devils will run at full speed again. I strongly advise you to
eat these pills and go to the most difficult part of the field.

In the game keys:
  <P> - Pauses the game
<Esc> - Return to the menu
<...> - Oeps.... I almost told a game secret... ;^)

Snakeman also has a highscore list. You enter this highscore table when you're
in the Top 10 of the best players. The data for the Top 10 will be saved to a
file called "HighScores" so make sure that the disk isn't write protected. If
you want to start with a new highscore table, just delete the file "HighScores"
from the SnakeMan: directory.



*** I like it, what now? ****************************************************

I did spend a lot of time in creating this game and I don't want to give it
away and hear nothing about it anymore. So this game is NOT Public Domain,
but it is Postcard-ware. If you like this game, please send me a postcard and
write some sentences (like the system you're using, the version of SnakeMan and
what you think of it). If I receive enough postcards I will make another
version of SnakeMan (something like Deluxe SnakeMan?!) with more levels, better
graphics, better sound AND what YOU wrote to me. By the way, the address below
is a good and 'stable' address for a long time because it's actually my parents
house.

I'm also looking for a programmer, a graphics artist and/or a musician who want
to work with a programmer for making some games. Please write too if you are
interested. I will always write back (if you include your address).

The reason that I'm asking for a postcard and not an E-mail is because I haven't
got a modem. So if you really think that this game is worth much more than a
postcard............. :^)

Anyway, have fun in playing the game!
