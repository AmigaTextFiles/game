Introduction
----------------

PengSwim is a game of swimming and eating, a penguin's two favorite activities.  The object of PengSwim is to eat as many fish as possible within the time limit.  Once you've eaten all the fish on the level, you move to a new level with more fish to eat.  What could be simpler?

Requirements
------------------

I've only tested the game on Linux, but it may be possible to install in on other systems, provided you fix the Makefile accordingly.  I use SDL, SDL_mixer, and SDL_ttf, all of which have been ported to a variety of systems.  You'll also need a TrueType font, preferrably Helvetica (see Installation).  Other than that, it should compile without a problem.  Let me know of any success stories on non-Linux platforms.

Installation
---------------

There is a make file included with the tarball, but it leaves much to be desired.  The default binary directory is /usr/games and the default data directory is /usr/share/pengswim.  If you need to use different directories, particularly if you want to compile PengSwim to run in your home directory, you'll need to edit these values.  Also, you'll need to change the path and file of the font if your Helvtica font is not installed in the stated directory or if you want to use a different font.  In the future, I intend to use autoconf and automake to make this all much more sane.  Until then, bear with me.

Play
------

Controls:
UP - Accelerate
DOWN - Brake
LEFT - Turn counter-clockwise
RIGHT - Turn clockwise
SPACE - Charge
Q or ESC - Quit

The controls may take a second to get used to, but it's basically like the old Asteroids game with a lot more viscosity.  Note that when you jump out of the water, you have no control.

You have 30 seconds per level to eat all the fish on the screen.  Once you eat all the fish, you have the option of going to a new level with two additional fish.  This goes on for a maximum of 20 fish ( I may raise that eventually).  My current high score is 106 fish.  N.B. The last fish is always the toughest.

What's New
---------------
0.2.0
-----
* added ice walls and level maps
* improved fish graphics and motion--they now turn rotate like the penguin
* added really basic AI to the fish.  It's the loosest definition of "intelligence"
* changed the physics to accomodate the new obstacles and prey
* fixed the install process using autoconf and automake
* reduced the total particles to ease the processor a bit

0.1.0
-----
* Improved the background graphics by adding a mountain (used xmountains to make it)
* Improved the physics of the penguin, especially while jumping out of the water
* Added a barrier to all sides of the game display, causing the penguin to about face.
* Added particle splashes and several minor particle improvements
* Added a splash noise and a burping sound at the end of each level
* Fixed the display text by making text boxes centered and a better shade of blue/green
* Added an icon

0.0.1
-----
Everything, actually.
