FastLife requires Amiga Software Release 2.04 or later.

FastLife also requires reqtools.library 38+. To install ReqTools,
open its drawer and double-click on the `Install' icon.

You may delete the ReqTools drawer after you've installed the ReqTools
library.

WARNING: The Amiga can produce screen modes that will physically damage
certain monitors.  See your Amiga documentation.

To see an impressive Life pattern, Start FastLife with a SuperHiRes-
Interlaced 1280 by 350 screen (SEE THE PARAGRAPH ABOVE!). Open
Patterns/New/RLE/BreederRLE.life and place it on the screen at about 
x=4, y=4.  Select Control-Run and watch for a while.  To see more detail,
open a LowRes 1280 by 350 screen and OpenAgain.  Push the mouse pointer
against the edge of the visible screen and it will scroll around.
