   The 'include13' directory holds clones of 'utility/tagitem.[hi]' and
'utility/hooks.[hi]' for people who haven't got the 2.0 include files.  The
original files are not included because they are copyrighted by Commodore.

   Check out the README files and documents in the Glue directory for
copyrights of all the glue code.

   RexxReqTools is Copyright (c) Rafael D'Halleweyn and is included with his
kind permission.

   All of the files copyrighted by the author must remain unmodified.  None
of these files may be distributed on its own, the entire package must be
distributed as one whole.  'demo.c' is full public domain and can be used in
any way you like.

   There is one exception to the above.  If you plan to release a freely
distributable program (either public domain, freeware or shareware), you may
include 'libs13/reqtools.library', 'libs20/reqtools.library', the
installation scripts (with icon) and the preference editor (with documentation
and icons) with your distribution.  It is left to the programmer to decide
whether he wishes to register as a ReqTools developer.  Registration is not
required, but would certainly be appreciated.  If you include ReqTools with a
crippled shareware program I'd like to ask you to send me a full working
version.

   Whether your program is freely distributable or commercial, you must state
in your documentation that your program uses reqtools.library and that
ReqTools is Copyright (c) Nico François.
