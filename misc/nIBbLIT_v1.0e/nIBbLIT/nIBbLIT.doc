"nIBbLIT" ?!? ... is it something edible?
-----------------------------------------


nIBbLIT is a small nibbler clone; if you don't know nibbler, play nIBbLIT
and discover a milestone of the gold-video-games-age.




How to play it (ACT I, Scene I)
-------------------------------

ME:  In order to complete a level, the snake called "nIBbLIT" must eat
     all the diamonds (morsels ?).

YOU: What an easy task!

ME:  But when you eat a diamond your tail grow longer ...

YOU: Perhaps the snake's digestion is not so good ...

ME:  No, the snake is as sound as a bell, but if it beats its head against
     its tail it will die.

YOU: But, in the real world, when a snake beats its head against its tail
     it doesn't die!

ME:  Of course! But that is not a SNAKE SIMULATOR.

YOU: How can I guide that strange snake?

ME:  You can use a joystick.

YOU: And if I get tired while playing it?

ME:  UHM ... it is most unlikely ... however you can press left mouse
     button and nIBbLIT will quit.

YOU: OK! Can you give me some hints?

ME:  Never forget where the snake's tail is ... and remember that when
     time reaches 0 the snake will move faster ... much faster.
     Now double click on nIBbLIT icon and HAVE FUN!!!

nIBbLIT should run on every Amiga (500,600,1200,4000) with 1M of ram.

Does the unregistered nIBbLIT lack something?
---------------------------------------------

Yes, of course ...
With the unregistered nIBbLIT you can only play the first SIX LEVELS,
they are quite easy so you'll start with only TWO SNAKES.
Besides, the HIGHSCORE-TABLE IS NOT ACTIVATED.

Play those funny levels, and if you enjoy them

                 REGISTER YOURSELF AS SOON AS AS POSSIBLE

and you'll immediately receive the patch-password which will allow you
to play the COMPLETE nIBbLIT with 22 levels, 3 lives and the highscore-table
enabled.




HOW TO INSTALL THE COMPLETE VERSION
-----------------------------------

If you are not a registered user you cannot patch the unregistered nIBbLIT,
so I encourage you to REGISTER as soon as possible.

If you are a registered user then I've sent to you the patch-password to
be used with ratcher patch-program in Patch.lha archive (PatchDir directory).
Follow these steps to build the complete version:

From CLI:
--------

    - move to PatchDir directory	: CLI> cd PatchDir 

    - extract Patch.lha archive		: CLI> lha x Patch.lha 

    - execute ratcher program		: CLI> ratcher 

    - type the patch-password

    - choose a name for the complete nIBbLIT version (default is
      "nIBbLIT")
      For example, type: "RAM:mynibblit" (without double quotes).


From Workbench:
--------------

    - extract the Patch.lha archive (open a CLI window and follow the first
      two steps above).

    - double-click on ratcher icon

    - type the patch-password

    - choose a name for the complete nIBbLIT version (default is
      "nIBbLIT")
      For example, type: "RAM:mynibblit" (without double quotes).


  IMPORTANT: if you choose another name for complete nIBbLIT, you must
  rename (or copy) the nIBbLIT icon in PatchDir directory.
  For example, if you chose "RAM:mynibblit" type:

	CLI> copy nIBbLIT.info RAM:mynibblit.info


  IMPORTANT2: the patch-data file (nIBbLIT.ptch) and the ratcher program
  MUST BE in the same drawer!!!




Future development
------------------

Actually nIBbLIT is a good game, but it could be better.

I've got a lot of ideas and if I receive some ENCOURAGEMENT FROM YOU
(I.E. THE SHAREWARE FEE) I'LL CERTAINLY KEEP ON WITH ITS DEVELOPMENT!!!

Every new release will certainly include 4-5 new levels and if you
become a registered user then you'll enjoy them at once.

The FINAL VERSION will include:

- MORE LEVELS:	building a level is not so hard: prepare yourself to play
                tons of levels.		

- IN-GAME BONUS STUFF (EXTRA LIVES, EXTRA TIME, EXTRA DIAMONDS ...)

- IN-GAME NOT-SO-BONUS STUFF (LONGER TAIL, LESS TIME, ...)

- MORE IN-GAME SOUND EFFECTS

- A DIFFERENT SOUNDTRACK (if you don't like the current one ;-)

- AN IN-GAME SOUNDTRACK

- IMPROVED GRAPHICS

- A PAUSE KEY

- GAME OPTIONS that influence snake control, game difficulty, sfx and music.

- ETC. ETC.
