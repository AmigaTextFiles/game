Release 1.00 Christmas 1995

			A Simple Simon
			==============

Introduction:
=============

I had a spare A500 and a daughter who was 14 months old, and it seemed
like a Simon type game would be the thing for her. However, the two
Simon type games I found on AmiNet were not suitable for her: one was
key driven and the other one was too complicated. So I decided to
make one myself. The actual game was wrapped up in about an hour,
and then extra features and interface polishing during testing
for a few hours more. 

So here it is - enjoy or ignore.

Usage:
======

Starting from CLI/Shell:

	Simon [-h] [-s n] [-q qual]

	-h 		List a short help.

	-s n		Set playback speed to n. The default is
			3 which is suitable for grownups. A value
			of 20 is suitable for children.

	-q qual		Set Quit qualifier to qual. By default you
			only need to click the right moust button to
			quit, but here you can specify for instance
			8 to require the CTRL key to be pressed at
			the same time. Unless you know exactly what
			you are doing, stick to 8 or you may not be
			able to quit... 

If you start from Workbench you are currently stuck with the default.

Sending a CTRL-C or a break to the process should make it quit after 
a while.

Playing:
========

Simon will show four big nice buttons in not-so-bright friendly
colors. When a button is pressed it becomes brighter and a note
is played. He will then play a tune for you to copy. He will start 
with a single note. When you have copied his tune he will start again,
appending another note. If you make a mistake he will tell you which
was the correct button and then he will start over with a new tune.

Some helpful messages are shown at the bottom and the best score is
also shown.


Hints:
======

If you realise that you are making a mistake, let the mouse button
slide off the button before you release it. This will make Simon ignore
that entry.

If you just want to play around without Simon interfering, just press
CAPS LOCK so that the little light stays on. In this state Simon will
ignore your entries, just like in the above case.


NOTE:
=====

It has been ages since I used a real Simon myself. As far as I can remember,
this is how it worked, but feel free to let me know if I have made a
mistake.


Tested on:
==========

The program has been developed on my trusty old A1000 under 1.3 and tested
on an A1200 running 3.0 so it SHOULD run on just about any Amiga 
configuration, but only time will tell. As far as I can tell it doesn't
leak any memory and it seems to free all resources properly as well.

Future enhancements:
====================

Maybe a proper highscore saved to disk?
Perhaps support for options from Workbench.


Distribution
============

  Simple Simon is not public domain. A friend of mine advised me to call it
"Freely Distributable Copyrighted" instead. That's close enough.  
If you wish to include it with a commercial program feel free provided 
that you send me a registered copy. And don't forget to mention me
in the manual.

  As always, Fred Fish is free to include it in his library, and so
is AmiNet.

I prefer to be contacted via E-mail:
    zap@indic.se		        /* At work  - Quickest */
    zaphod@magrathea.indic.se           /* The Amiga at home */

Snail-mail is OK, but I'm awful with pen and paper:

Feel free to send comments, bug reports (huh?), money, coke, beer...

Just a "Hi, I liked your program" is as good as a few bucks - I wrote this
for Catrin, not to make money out of it...
