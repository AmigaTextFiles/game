Rick Giles July 1998- Archer. A quest game for the amiga.

[1m IMPORTANT- You don't need to read this, however it's likely to
help if you read the entry about speed...
 For that matter, you may like to learn how to get out of the game
too...[0m

*What Is It

   This is a one player game called Archer. Created using Amospro,
  Dpaint and Iconian.
   Now and again I find programs and wonder what they are, the Docs
  hardly and mostly never tell anyone! Not this time.


*To Run

   From Wb, just click on 'Archer'
   From Cli, just enter 'execute archer'

To end the game, either win or press CTL-C
To flick between Wb and amos- CTL-A

*To Play

   Using a joystick in port two, or use the keyboard curser keys and
  the space bar to fire.
   
   If you die then just fire, you'll start again. This is the
feature of the game, and the annoying part. The game must be
won strait through, you die you start again.
   There is a way around it, but that would be cheeting.


*Speed

  If too fast then press the left mouse button.
   Enter a number and that will be the 50th of a second value
  it waits per cycle.

   Before I got my 030 accelerator the speed for my 2meg A1200
  was just right- now I find entering a value of two the right
  speed.

   ie Run game, hit left mouse button, enter the number that works
  for you.

  I wanted to make it work that out for itself, but I've lost
  the code. 


*Story

    Archer's home castle has been magicaly turned to straw by an
  enemy, The Socerer. This socerer has different morality values, Archer 
  considers him evil.
    As all medievil citizens know, all spells cast by evil socerers
  automaticaly end upon the death of said spell caster. Archer 
  intends to restore his castle to stone before a strong wind
  blows it away. With this in mind, Archer enters the forest toward
  the lands of the Socerer.
    For a side-mission, Archers friend the Wizzard has been captured
  by The Socerer. If Archer can free the Wiz then he will, and
  the Wiz is bound to be able to give Archer a hand too.

*Slight Flaw

    At the enemy outpost there is a bolder just sitting above
the bad guys. If an arrow were to hit it then it would fall
upon them. Since it's a magic bolder though, it dosn't roll
over them in a way normal people can percieve. 
    Still does the job though.

*Cheeting

    Pessing right mouse button kills you, that'll save you some
playing time because you'd have died anyway probably.
    Pressing both buttons at one time will automaticaly skip
Archer to the enemy castle.



Blast loosing that code! Guess it means I don't have to look
at it again though.
