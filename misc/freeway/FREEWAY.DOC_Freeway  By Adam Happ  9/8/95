FREEWAY By Adam Happ
version 1.0 9/8/95 - Written in Easy Amos (one of my first creations!)

Thank you for downloading Freeway!
This is a game much like Frogger, except you are attempting to make it across 
the freeway, back too your taxi cab alive! There are two characters to
chose from. One is slow , but tiny and has more lives. The other is large
and fast has less lives.

The object is to move your guy into one of the taxi cabs at the top of the
screen, once you hit them all you complete the level...Cars in the next level
go faster so watch out! 
During the game press 's' at anytime for music...'p' pauses the game and
stops the music.

That's it! Good luck and have fun! Feel free to send me email if you run 
into problems: crunch@kiosk.mra.net. I also spend a lot of time on the IRC
#amiga channel...Just start talking 'bout AMOS...:)

INSTALLATION!

All you have to do is assign FREEWAY: to where ever you unarchive the
