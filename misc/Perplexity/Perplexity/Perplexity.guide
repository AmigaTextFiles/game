Introduction
@{UB}
I can remember a small plastic puzzle toy I used to have when I was very young. The puzzle, had 15 numbered tiles which could be moved around by sliding them into a gap in the puzzle, and the idea of this primitive toy was to get all the 15 tiles in numeric order. The game I found was very challenging, and could take anything up to ten minutes to complete, and this is where the idea of Perplexity came from, however the difference is that instead of boring numbers being on the tiles, I have used various graphics.

Grow your own
@{UB}
I have included a puzzle template for use with Perplexity, so if you wish to make your own levels you can do so. Load the IFF template into an art package such as Personal Paint or Deluxe Paint and use the white area for the puzzle. Please feel free to create your own puzzles and release them into PD.

If you like this game please let me know. If I get enough support I may create a few data disks etc.

Can the author do it?
@{UB}
before you start playing - remember that it @{B}IS@{UB} possible to complete the puzzles. On my first attempt at one of the puzzle (after coding the game), I completed puzzle number 8 (GAZ & MICK) in 3 mins and 32 secs. It took me 363 moves. My second attempt at one of the puzzles was less of a success, as it took me exactly nine minutes to complete puzzle number 13 (Amiga 1200), and took me well over 999 moves :(

System Requirements
@{UB}
To play Perplexity you will require an Amiga with the following:

OS 1.3 or higher
1 meg of ram
@{B}
Add those buffers!
@{UB}
It is recommended that if running Perplexity from disk, you should use the standard Amiga OS command `AddBuffers'. i.e. AddBuffers DF0: 15 . This will speed up puzzle preview/loading up considerably.
