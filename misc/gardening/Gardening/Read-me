				Gardening.


The game:

The aim of the game is not very difficult:

You are a gardener very devoted (oh yes you are! ;), and your first occupation
is to protect your plants against very glutton insects.

This game is, as you can guess, the adaptation of an old electronic game 
released in 1983. I worked as hard as I could in order to stay the most 
faithful to the original game. Although, if you know it and if you see some
differencies with my version, please email me.

Control: Directionnal arrows to move
         Ctrl, Alt, Shift to spray
         Spacebar to start again when you lost
         Esc to quit

You can also use a joystick.

Many thanks to Igor for his useful help in the coding.
Thanks also to nOOr for his translations in english and spanish.
At last, thanks to J-Files, Yocine, Kyvu, Tito (if he still exists), MattZ, 
Pascal, Fred, Dirk and Ronny for their support.

To contact me: mike.vernier@lemel.fr

I'd be very grateful if you write me to tell me what you think about my game,
to encourage me or simply to prove me that my work has been useful.

I'll answer every messages.

See you soon.
