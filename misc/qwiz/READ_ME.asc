3.0 INTRODUCTION
================
Q:Whiz! Creator is a very simple (I hope!) quiz making 
utility which enables stand-alone quizzes to be produced 
with the minimum of hassle.  

************************************************************

4.0 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
=========================
Q:Whiz! Creator should work on any Amiga which uses 
Workbench 2.0 or higher and has at least 1 Meg of RAM.

If you only have 1 Meg of RAM, you may have to disable  
additional drives, if you have a number attached, as the 
Creator will need virtually every scrap of memory it can get 
it's grubby hands on.  If you forget to disable additional 
drives, a message will be shown during the program's 
initialization telling you to turn them off and then to 
reboot your machine , if it is necessary.  You will also 
have to ensure that this is the only program you have 
running because of the amount of memory is consumes.

************************************************************

5.0 CREATOR INSTRUCTIONS
========================
Once the program has loaded you will be presented with the 
MAIN MENU.  This consists of the following:

MAKE QUESTIONS
TEST QUIZ
CHECK QUIZ
OPTIONS
ABOUT

You select what you want by moving the mouse pointer over 
the button in question and pressing the left mouse button.

To quit the Creator, place the mouse pointer in the 
top-right of the screen and press the left mouse button.

The MAIN MENU headings will now explained in more detail.

------------------------------------------------------------

5.1 MAKE QUESTIONS
==================
This is where the questions, making up your quiz, are 
inputted.  

Each quiz can consist of up to 100 questions.

Each entry needs a question, 4 choices and a correct choice 
indicator.  The way the question is copied and removed from 
the screen can also be selected from a number of pre-defined 
effects.

There are five text boxes, corresponding to the question and 
4 choices.  To enter a text box either place the pointer 
inside the one you want and press the left mouse button or 
alternatively press <Enter> which will cycle through the 
boxes.  The active box will contain the cursor.

The correct choice is indicated by selecting one of the 
small boxes which come before the choice text boxes.  A 
marker will be shown to indicate which box has been chosen.  
To change the correct choice, just place the pointer inside 
the box you want and press the left mouse button. The 
correct choice marker will then be moved accordingly.

The bottom panel contains various functions which will now 
explained:

"CLEAR QUES"
Will clear the data from the current question.

"RESET QUES"
Will restore the current question to the data which was 
stored prior to the last operation.  Here, "last operation" 
refers to either: "CLEAR QUES", any of the text 
justification commands, "PASTE", line up, line down.

"INSERT QUES"
Will create a space for one question between the current 
question and the one before it.

"DELETE QUES"
Will delete the current question.  All questions after this 
entry will be moved down by one.

"FX-IN"
Allows you to specify how the current question will be 
copied to the screen.

"FX-OUT"
Allows you to specify how the current question will be 
removed from the screen.

Justify: "<"
The text line where the cursor is will be moved across so 
that it is flush with the left edge of the text box.

Justify: "><"
The text line where the cursor is will be centered.

Justify: ">"
The text line where the cursor is will be moved across so 
that it is flush with the right edge of the text box.

"INSERT"
Changes the text mode to insert.  As you type, all 
characters to the right of the cursor are moved across by 
one in order to accommodate the new text being inputted. 

"OVERWRITE"
Changes the text mode to overwrite.  As you type, any 
current text is replaced by the new characters being 
inputted.

"COPY"
Will copy the line where the cursor is to a text buffer.

Please note, "COPY" does NOT copy the whole question, only 
the current line.  

"PASTE"
Will copy the text stored in the text buffer, from the last 
"COPY", to the line where the cursor is.

Line: "\/"
Will move the line where the cursor is to the line below.
  
This function is only available in the question text box.

Line: "/\"
Will move the line where the cursor is to the line above.

If this value will be less than the first question, you will 
be taken to the first question.

Question: "<"
Will move back one question.  

Question: ">"
Will move forward one question.

If this value will be greater than the current last question 
number, the value will be increased.  Careful as you could 
add unwanted blank questions if you press this button too 
often.

">>"
Will move forward 10 questions.

If this value will be greater than the current last question 
number, the value will be increased.  Careful as you could 
add unwanted blank questions if you press this button too 
often.

"TEST"
The current question is removed and returned to the screen 
using the FX-in / FX-out currently selected.

"EXIT"
Returns you to the MAIN MENU.

"LOAD" - NOT AVAILABLE IN DEMO

Proportional Bar / Slider:
Between the text boxes and the functions panel is a black 
strip which contains an orange square.  Select the orange 
square and move the pointer left / right to quickly get to a 
specific question.  You can only go as far as the current 
last question number so don't worry about adding blank 
entries to the end of your quiz.

Attached quiz screen:
Each quiz can have an attached IFF picture.  This will be 
loaded in and shown before the quiz is played, enabling the 
author and subject of the quiz to be given.  

Please note that the picture is only optional and you don't 
need to create them for things to work properly.

------------------------------------------------------------

5.2 TEST QUIZ

question will be copied and removed from the screen using

"EXIT"
Returns you to the MAIN MENU.

------------------------------------------------------------

5.3 CHECK QUIZ
==============
This checks that each entry is complete by making sure each 
text box contains some text and that there is a correct 
choice marker.  If something is missing, it will report an 
error.  Please note that it doesn't check to see if the 
actual question / choice statements are complete, or make 
sense, or if the correct choice marker indicates the correct 
answer - it's not that good!

The checker is started by selecting the "BEGIN" button.

If there is an error in the entry, the checker stops and 
reports what's missing.  This is done by lighting up the 
appropriate part on the status panel.  The entry can now be 
COMPLETED, DELETED or the checker can be abandoned.

"SHOW QUESTION"
If this button is pressed, each question will be shown as it 
is being checked.  If not pressed, the questions are not 
shown and the checker runs faster.

"BEGIN"
Starts the checker.

"COMPLETE"
Returns you to the MAKE QUESTIONS section of the Creator to 
complete the current entry.

"DELETE"
The current question is deleted and the checker starts off 
again.

giving various pieces of "useful" information regarding the 
quiz.  Select "OK" to return to the MAIN MENU.
