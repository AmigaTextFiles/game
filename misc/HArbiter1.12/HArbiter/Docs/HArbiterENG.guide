                               Introduction

                Core Wars are frequently called "games for progammers".
They rely on writing programs in special language Red Code.
The programs fight in virtual, separated in computer's memory array called
"The Core" and the flow of the fight is supervised by MARS - Memory Array
Redcode Simulator.

                Hegemon's Arbiter includes integrated Red Code environment
designed for Amiga. It consists of: Red Code compiler and MARS, which allow
you to make duels and tournaments. The program allows you to observe the fight
in two forms: First is the array window, where you can see in realtime what
do the fighting programs do, the second way are the windows displaying
decompiled piece of the core, where you can see the fighters.

                              Fight


                This gadget starts a duel between two Red Code programs,
which you select from the appearing requester. The fighters are compiled
"at the moment". By now there is no need for pre-compilation, because even
A500 compiles warriors very fast. After compiling, the programs are placed
on the core. The following windows should appear:
Control, and eventually @{"Core window" link "okno-Rdzeï"} and @{"Disasembled window" link "okno-Deasemblacja"},
if you've selected so in @{"the preferences" link "preferencje"}.

In the control window you'd see the following gadgets:

@{"Start" link "start"},@{"Stop" link "stop"} and @{"Step" link "krok"}. The slider placed
beneath sets @{"Running Delay" link "tempo"}.

The game flows under conditions set up in @{"the preferences" link "preferencje"}.

The fight can end after victory of one of the programs, or after a draw.
The result of the fight is displayed in the requester

                            Tournament


                This gadget allows you to play a tournament between many
Red Code programs. In the tournament have to start at least two programs.
Tournament is a series of fights in the system "everyone with everyone",
and every two programs repeat their fights as many times as set in
@{"the preferences" link "preferencje"}.

Scoring:
Win  - 10 points
Draw -  5 points
Lose -  0 points

During the tournament two windows are displayed:
Control Window and Statistics Window. In the Control Window are placed
the following gadgets: @{"Start" link "Start"}, @{"Stop" link "Stop"} and @{"Restart" link "Restart"}.
The Statistics Window contains information about currently fighting programs
and their places in the chart. The number of names displaed here depends on
the window's size.

After the tournament completes a requester is shown.
The result of tournament can be saved in a text file.@{b}(Not in unregistered version!)@{ub}

                In the preferences window you can set all Arbiter's
parameters and save them to disc.
@{b}In the uregeistered version you cannot cave the preferences!@{ub}

Paremetes:
        Instruction limit. Compiled programs cannot have more instructions
as stated here.

        Size of arena. All fights are played on the cpecified core lenght.

        Cucle limit. This tells you how many steps the programs can do
before the fight is  a draw.

        Delay. This slider sets the @{"Running Dely" link "tempo"}. Far left means no delay.

        Arena window width. This parameter sets the duel window width (in pixels).
The height of this window is calculated by the program and depends on size
of the core.

@{B}WARNING! The window won't show up if it's width is greater than current
screen width. A 640x256 screens fills an arena of 9163 cells.
A 640x512 can hold about 19000.@{UB}

        Split limit. This deifnes the maximum number of child processes
to which the fighter may split during the fight.

        Fights in tournament. Every two programs fights defined number of duels.

        Show disassembled. Switches the Disassembled Window (default off).

        Show arena window. Switches the Arena Window (default on).

        Files. This is the path where you keep your warriors.

@node "Rdzeï" "The Core"

        The Core is a virtual, separated incomputer's memmory array on which
the programs ar fighting. It is treaten as a ring, so all address calls are
relative. One cell contains informations about the command, its parameters,
and their types:

        INSTUCTION fieldA filedB

                       @{b}Hegemon's Arbiter@{ub}
                --------------------------------

                        Argument types

        # - Immediate, e.g. #12 (the number twelve)

        $ - Independent - address you are pointing at

        @ - Dependent - address of the cell, which in it fieldB
                contains the address you are pointing at

        < - Depndent with predecrementation - as above with exception,
                that the adress of the cell you are pointing at is
                decreased by one avery time this argument is executed

        In the Dependent arguments (@, <) the address of the cell you are
        pointing at is counted from the cell pointed in the command with
        Dependent argument. I know it's writtnen very strange, so here
        is an example:

        DAT     $0      $2
start:  JMP     @-1
        MOV     0       1

        The JMP command will take the biledB of the cell placed -1 of it's
        position (DAT) and jump 2 fields ahead, but counted from the DAT,
        so it's only one field ahead from the JMP.

        The default is Independent ($), so you can skip it during programming.

                       @{b}Hegemon's Arbiter@{ub}
                --------------------------------

                       Red Code Commands

        Red Code consists of 11 commands (ICWS 91).
        Most requires two parameters except DAT, JMP. SPL, in which
        you can skip the argument placed in square brackets.
        If you do so compiler will place there value $0

        DAT [A] B - Probably the most important Red Code command.
        It destroys process which tries to execute it.
        Formally DAT is treaten as a variable.

        MOV A B - Moves A to B. If A is # it's value will be written
        in filed B of cell you are pointing at.
        In other cases whole cell is written including the command.
        E.g. MOV $0 $1  - this copies itself to next cell.

        ADD A B - Adds A- to B. If A is # it's value will be added
        to B field of cell you are pointing at.
        In other cases both values of A and B fields of the cell pointed
        with arg. A are added to appropiate fileds of the cell pointed
        ith arg. B.
        E.g.    ADD $1  $2
                JMP $-1 $0
                DAT $1  $1 - after executing ADD command
                             this cell becomes DAT $0 $1

        SUB A B - Same as ADD, but substracts.

        JMP a [B] - Jump to address pointed with A argument.	

        JMZ A B - Jump to address pointed with A.
                  This is a dependent jump, executed only when value
                  of field B of the cell pointed with B (in JMZ)
                  is zero. Else ignored.

        JMN A B - The same as JMZ, but when not equal zero. Else ignored.

        DJN A B - Also a dependent jump, but more complex.
                  First the value of field B of the cell pointed with B
                  is decreased by one and if the result is not equal zero
                  it jumps to address pointed with A. Else ignored.

        CMP A B - This command compares addresses A and B. If they are
                  equal next command is skipped.
                  If A is a # type this value is compared with field B
                  of the cell pointed with B.

        SPL A [B] - It produces anindependent task starting from address
                    pointed with A. Fighter can split until he reaches
                    the number of child tasks set in the preferences
                    (after this the SPL command does no effect).
                    If one of child tasks becomes killed the SPL works again.
                        Splitted figters run slower, because the make moves
                        in shifts:
                        1. Father-task executes SPL
                        2. Enemy-task
                        3. Child-task
                        4. Enemy-task
                        5. Father-task
                        6. Enemy-task and so on.

        SLT A B - Same as CMP. except that it checks if A is smaller
                  than B. If yes, it skips next command. It compares
                  only arguments, not the command.

@node "Standardy" "Standards"

        Hegemon's Arbiter supports standard ICWS'91 (Improved Corewars
        Standard of 1991) which expands the standard CWS'88.
        The main change is that every type of parameter is accepted.
                E.g. JMP #3 $0 - this wouldn't be accepted in CWS'88
                                 now is translated to JMP $0 $0
        Programs written under CWS'88 runs under ICWS'91 but not reverese.

@node "Kompilator" "Compiler"

        Arbiter's compile allow you to use:
                - labels (the don't have to be ended with colon [:])
                - constants (eg. one = 1; two equ 1+1)
                - arithmetic expressions on decimal numbers
        This compiler ignores letter cases.

        A Red Code program should be ended with a pseudo-command END
        (but it's not a "must"), which is treaten as end-of-file.
        With END you can specify the label from which your fighter
        will start.
                E.g. init:  MOV $0 $1 
                            END init - program will start from the label
                                        named 'init'.

        If there is no label name after END the program will start
        from label named 'start'. If even this one couldn't be found
        the program will start from first command.
