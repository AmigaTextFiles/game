Why are the docs for version 2.36?

I haven't updated the docs for version 2.38 because there have only been
two small changes: 1) An extra bit of information in the -r output and
2) A bug fixed which caused the best/worst teams to crash the computer
if there were no £1m drivers in the race.

What's all this garbage in my icons?

I use a system called NewIcons to provide fixed size, 16 colour
icons instead of Commodore's boring 4 colour ones or Magic Workbench's
hideous 8 colour ones. To make the icons backwardly compatible, the
icon data is stored as tooltypes within the original icon. This is
what you can see. NewIcons is available on Aminet.
