@node "Intro" "FGP Introduction"
What is FGP?

FGP is a program written primarily for people participating in Autosport's
Fantasy Grand Prix competition. It allows the user to keep track of up to 
100 individual teams. This is useful as Autosport only ever prints the top 
(and bottom <shudder>) 100 teams and most people aren't in there :-(

Is that all it does?

Pretty much. It will however handle an entire season of results, rather 
than the less-than-half season used in the Autosport competition.

What will it run on?

FGP was primarily developed on the Amiga, but, by only using portable C 
code, it can also be compiled and run on other platforms. It has 
successfully been compiled on several Unix systems and I have been 
informed that it has compiled on OS/2. Version 2.26 and above should now
work under MS-DOS and Windows if the instructions in MS-DOS.TXT are
followed.

I've used an earlier version of FGP, what does version 2.39 offer me?

Version 2.39 is, despite the large version increase from 2.10 (the last
major release), mainly minor updates and bugfixes. However, the major
changes areas follows.

The ability to read the old style datafiles has been dropped. It was only
kept before because 2.10 appeared halfway through the season and I didn't
want to have to force people to rewrite their datafiles;

An absolutely hideous bug that caused problems if you didn't have a
@{u}teams.fgp2@{uu} file has been squashed;

It is no longer required to place a - or a + in the flags to indicate the
`Driver of the Day'. Just placing a + flag after the driver's flags is
sufficient;

Two new tables can be produced. Using the -c command line option, tables
listing the scores for the chassis and the engines can be produced;

A couple of problems from 2.10 (two drivers being given the same finishing
position & problems caused by blank lines at the end of some files) have now
been fixed;

The legality of all teams is now checked before each race.

Between zero and six drivers can score from the warmup. This allows
preliminary results to be produced before the warmup results are known;

A new driver's flag has been added: t - did not start. This allows a driver
who has achieved a grid position, but does not actually race to keep his
qualifying/warmup points.

The list of teams in the -r option now has the teams position.

New ouput, -s, comma seperated data for spreadsheets.

Some new error checking and improved error messages.

The best and worst scores possible are calculated and displayed in the race
output.

An ordered list of the scores achieved in the race is included in the -r
option. This was suggested by Martin Colbert.

A season of more than 16 races can be run. Currently the limit is set at 20.

@node "Dist" "FGP Distribution"
How distributable is FGP?

FGP is freely distributable, although the ©Copyright remains with the
Author on the program, the source code and this documentation (whether
in plain or formatted ascii, AmigaGuide® or HTML format).

Any and all data files included in a distribution archive are placed in the
public domain for anyone to use.

The @{"rules" link "Rules" 0} for the Autosport Fantasy Grand Prix (the file Rules.doc) are
©Copyright 1994 Haymarket Specialist Motoring Publications Ltd.

Any and all data files created for or during the use of FGP are the property
of the user.

What should be in the archive?

The Amiga distribution consists of the files in an LhA archive. The archive
will be named fgp???.lha, where ??? indicates the version number. The
archive will contain the following files:

    FGP.c     - the source
    FGP       - the actual program
    FGP.doc   - this document in ascii format
    FGP.guide - this document in AmigaGuide® format

plus any associated icons. The archive may, depending of the time of
distribution, contain one or more data files for use with FGP.

The Amiga archive will be placed on Aminet
(ftp://src.doc.ic.ac.uk/pub/aminet/ game/misc/) and on my home page
(http://webzone1.demon.co.uk/www/taranis/ currently only running 1800-2400
BST).

The MS-DOS distribution consists of the files in PKZip archive. The archive
will be named fgp???.zip, where ??? indicates the version number. The
archive will contain the following files:

    FGP.c     - the source
    FGP.exe   - the actual program
    FGP.doc   - the documentation in ascii format

The archive may, depending of the time of distribution, contain one or
more data files for use with FGP.

The MS-DOS archive will, for the moment, only be placed on my home page.

There will also be a source only distribution in the form of a tarred and
compressed archive. In addition to going on my home page it is hoped to
upload this to the SunSITE Unix archive.

@node "Inst" "FGP Instructions"
Instructions for using FGP:

@{"The command line" link "CLI" 0}

@{"The input file" link "Input" 0}

@{"The data files" link "Data" 0}

@{"The output" link "Output" 0}

@{"The error messages" link "errors" 0}

Generally the process of producing the output for a particular race is as
follows:

1) Create the race data file(s) in any text editor (ed, edit, vim, memacs);

2) Run fgp with this data file (@{u}fgp data.file@{uu});

3) Fix any problems (see @{"error messages" link "errors" 0} for more details);

4) Re-run fgp to update the scores file (@{u}fgp data.file@{uu});

5) Run fgp to produce the outputs (@{u}fgp -r -t -d -c -s@{uu}).

@{b}@{i}NB:@{ub} When producing -r output there may be a long pause before the results
are output. This is due to a very long calculation to find the best and
worst scores for the race. On a 50MHz 68030 based Amiga or a 66MHz 80486 PC
it can last a couple of minutes.@{ui}

Of course the options in 5 can be combined with the data file in 2 or 4 if
you want (@{u}fgp -r -t -d -c -s data.file@{uu}).
@endnode

@node "CLI" "FGP Command Line"
@toc "Inst"
FGP uses a simple command line:

    FGP <[-r[n]] [-t[n]] [-d[n]] [-c[n]] [filename]>

Any or all of these options may be given on the command line, in any order
and case (NB under Unix, the filename cannot be in any case. See below).

    @{"-r[n]" link "Race" 0}

Produce the standard single race output, plus a breakdown of each team's
score.

    @{"-t[n]" link "Team" 0}

Produce a table showing the scores for each team for each race.

    @{"-d[n]" link "Drive" 0}

Produce a table showing the scores for each driver for each race.

    @{"-c[n]" link "Cars" 0}

Produce a table showing the scores for each chassis/engine for each race.

    @{"-s[n]" link "Spread" 0}

Produce comma seperated data which can be loaded in most spreadsheets and
used to produce graphs.

In all five cases, a number after the option indicates the number of
races to produce the results for. If no number is given, it is assumed
that results for all races are required.

    @{"filename" link "Input" 0}

This is the full filename for the @{"race data" link "Input" 0} file. The case sensitivity of
this option is system-dependant so take care with this.
@endnode

@node "Input" "FGP Input Files"
@toc "Inst"
The data file consists of a single ascii text file which lists all the
drivers involved in a particular race, their finishing positions, whether
they finished, retired, were disqualified or failed to qualify, where
they came in the warmup and if they were nominated for the Driver of the
Race award.

The format of the file is as follows:

  ## This is a comment, all comments start with ## at the 
  ## start of the line. Comments are optional, you don't have to 
  ## have any, or you can have as many as you want.
  Race name
  ## The Race name uniquely identifies the Race, only the first six
  ## characters are used so don't call two different races Sponge12 and
  ## Sponge13 because they won't be identified as different.
  Surname of driver at grid position 1
  ## This is case insensitive, Schumacher is the same as schumacher.
  Flags for driver 1
  Surname of driver at grid position 2
  Flags for driver 2
  |
  |
  Surname of driver at last grid position
  Flags for last driver
  Surname of driver who did not qualify
  Flags for non qualifier
  Surname of second driver who DNQ
  Flags

The `Flags' line comprises four items detailing the driver's result.
They are:

Status Position Warmup Nomination

Status is one of FfRrDdNnTt where F or f means finished, R/r means retired,
D/d means disqualified, N/n means did not qualify and T/t means did not
start.

Position is the position the driver finished in. This should be included
for retirees and disqualifications as well as those who finished. Drivers
who DNQ or DNS should be given a finishing position of 0.

Warmup is the position the driver achieved in the Sunday warmup. DNQs
generally don't take part in this so they will usually be 0 again. Only the
first six legal drivers can score points (6 points for first, 5 for second,
etc) so if one of these drivers is disqualified the seventh fastest driver
must be listed (and the eigth if two are disqualified) for all warmup points
to be awarded. Drivers whose positions don't matter can be given either
their position or 0.

The nomination flag is only required for the `Driver of the Day' as given in
Autosport. Simply put a space and a + at the end of the flags for the
appropriate driver. Only one nominated driver is allowed and there will
be an error message if this is the case.

    @{"drivers.fgp2" link "drivers" 0}

    @{"chassis.fgp2" link "chassis" 0}

@endnode

@node "teams" "FGP teams.fgp2 File"
@toc "Data"
@{u}teams.fgp2@{uu} details the fantasy teams taking part in the
competition. Each team consists of three drivers, a chassis and an
engine. Details of how to make a team are in the @{"Rules" link "Rules" 0}. Each team will be
checked by the program to ensure that it complies with the rules (ie it
costs, in total, less than £30m and the test driver costs only £1m).

The @{u}teams.fgp2@{uu} file is constructed as follows:

 ## Comments.

 ## Number of teams in the competition.
 ## Team 1 details
 Owner
 Name
 Driver 1 Surname
 Driver 2 Surname
 Test Driver Surname
 Chassis

 ## Team 8 details
@endnode

@node "drivers" "FGP drivers.fgp2 file"
@toc "Data"
@{u}drivers.fgp2@{uu} is the largest data file used by FGP. It contains the full
name, team and cost of each driver in the real Formula One competition.
Currently @{u}drivers.fgp2@{uu} can contain a maximum of 100 drivers and this
seems to be sufficient at the moment.

The file is constructed as follows:

 ## Comments can be used, but aren't required.
 Surname
 First name
 Chassis
 Engine
 Cost

repeated for each driver. If drivers enter the competition who weren't
originally listed, they can be added to the end of the file as required. Do
not add drivers to any other part of the file. If a driver moves from one
team to another during a season (e.g. Philipe Alliot or Andrea de Cesaris)
this should be reflected by changing the chassis and engine names. 

The surname and first name should be cased as they will appear in the
final ouput (e.g. de Cesaris, Schumacher), the case of the chassis and
engine is irrelevant.

The cost is the amount, in millions of pounds sterling, to purchase that
driver.

As an example, Damon Hill costs £20,000,000 and drives for Williams Renault,
so his entry would be:

 Hill
 Damon
 williams
 renault
 20

NB: If you change an entry and then re-score an earlier race the change
in chassis/engine will be noted with a non-fatal error message. If you
did not intend for that driver/car combination to be used for that race
then you'll have to change the file to the correct combination and score
the race again. This method of warning about changes was implemented in
order to allow mistakes to be corrected in prior races in an inobtrusive
manner as possible.

@node "chassis" "FGP chassis.fgp2 File"
@toc "Data"
@{u}chassis.fgp2@{uu} is a simple list of all the available chassis names and their

@node "scores" "FGP scores.fgp2 File"

@{u}scores.fgp2@{uu} contains the points scored by the drivers in all the
races so far recorded.

This file is not meant to be altered by the user. @{b}@{fg shine}Warning@{ub}@{fg text}: altering
this file may result in incorrect results. Note also that this is the only
data file in which comments cannot be used.
@endnode

@node "Output" "FGP Output"
@toc "Inst"
FGP can produce five forms of output. The output required is
indicated by the @{"command line" link "CLI" 0}.

    @{"Race scores" link "Race" 0}

    @{"Teams table" link "Team" 0}

    @{"Driver table" link "Drive" 0}

    @{"Cars table" link "Cars" 0}

    @{"Spreadsheet data" link "Spread" 0}

Normally, FGP sends its output to the standard output. On the Amiga
this will result in the output appearing in the console from which
FGP was started. Under Unix the output will appear in the shell you
started FGP from. This method allows the output to be redirected as
required. The output may be directed into a file or piped through
another program (on the Amiga, piping requires either a second console
or a Unix-style pipe command installed).

    FGP -r >results.txt
    FGP >results.txt -r 

These two commands will produce the standard race scores and save
them in a file called results.txt.

    FGP -r | more

Under Unix (or AmigaDOS with an appropriate setup) this will send
the results to the console/shell but stop every screen to allow you
to read the output.

To pipe the output on an Amiga without a Unix-style pipe you'll have
to open a second console. In the first type

    FGP -r >PIPE:fgp.out

In the second console type

    more <PIPE:fgp.out

It's much easier to install a proper pipe though. The appropriate
programs can be found on the Aminet. Just search for finkeltools.lha.
I think it's in util/shell.
@endnode

@node "errors" "FGP Error messages"
When reading in a data file, FGP will produce a message if it finds an error
in the file(s). There are two sorts of error message; fatal and non-fatal.
Fatal error messages will stop the program immediately, but non-fatal ones
won't. If a line number is listed it means the line number in the file.


@{i}Fatal errors are:@{ui}

    Usage: FGP <[-r[n]] [-t[n]] [-d[n]] [-c[n]] [filename]>

This means you didn't give FGP the correct commands.

    Unable to open "filename".

FGP couldn't find one of the files it requires to run.

    Error in file "filename" on line n. Unknown driver "name".

FGP encountered, in the named file, a driver's name which it doesn't know.
This either means a name has been wrongly spelt or a new driver has driven.
In the first case you should correct the spelling, in the second the new
driver should be added to the bottom of the @{u}drivers.fgp2@{uu} file.

    Error in file "filename" on line n. Unknown chassis "name".
    Error in file "filename" on line n. Unknown engine "name".

Same as the driver error above but for a chassis or engine.

    Error in file "filename" on line n. Flag not one of FRDN.

The status flag was incorrect.

    Error in file "filename" on line n. Illegal finishing position.

The driver's finishing position was not within the range 0 to 26.

    Error in file "filename" on line n. Final position already allocated.

A second driver has been given a finishing position that is already occupied
by an earlier driver.

    Error in file "filename" on line n. Too many nominated drivers.

Two drivers have a + as their nominated flag.

    Error in file "filename". Unallocated position.

One or more of the classified drivers has been missed out.

    Team owned by Owner costs more than £30m.

The named team cost more than £30m.

    Team owned by Owner has an illegal test driver.

The named team has a test driver who costs more than £1m.

@{i}Non-fatal errors are:@{ui}

    Driver's car has changed from Chassis1 to Chassis2.

    Driver's engine has changed from Engine1 to Engine2.

These errors will occur if you re-score a race and FGP detects that when the
race was first scored the driver had a different car/engine to this time. If
the new combination is correct you don't need to do anything, but if the old
combination was correct you'll have to adjust @{u}drivers.fgp2@{uu} and re-score the
race again.
@endnode

@node "Bugs" "FGP Bugs and Problems"
There may still be some bugs left in FGP. There have been quite a few
changes since the last version and, whilst I've tried to fix everything,
some things may have slipped through the net.

If you think you've found a bug, please don't hesitate to @{"contact" link "Contact" 0} me.

@{b}The `impossible Unix bug' section:@{ub}

There have been a couple of bug reports where a driver's points appeared in
the breakdown but not actually in the driver's score. This bug only occurs
under Unix and should in fact be impossible. If you do find something like
this please contact me a soon as possible and send me the data files you
were using.

@{b}The `but that's not what Autosport gave them' problem:@{ub}

There have been instances where the results given by Autosport have been
different to those produced by FGP. In most cases these have been due to
printing errors in Autosport, but a couple have been down to incorrect
interpretations of the rules. If you do find a situation where the results
differ the chances are I'll already be working on it, but feel free to
@{"contact" link "Contact" 0} me if you wish.
@endnode

@node "Registration" "FGP Registration"
Although FGP is completely free, if you use it, I'd like to know. In return,
if you have an e-mail address, I'll send you new versions as and when they
appear. If you don't have an e-mail address I can only send out updates on
receipt of a disk and return postage.

To register, @{"e-mail me" link "Contact" 0} with a message saying who you are, what version of
FGP you're using and what system you're using it on and I'll put you on the
list.

Otherwise, send me a note to my @{"snail-mail address" link "Contact" 0} saying the same. If you
send a disk and return postage I'll send you the latest version (or the next
one if you already have that one).

The latest version of FGP can also be picked up from my home page; point

@node "History" "FGP History"
@{b}Release History:@{ub}

History prior to 2.24 has been removed.

2.24 - Removed: Old datafile reading & associated errors. Added:
chassis/engines table. Change: `Driver of the Day' flag made optional.
Fixed: two drivers given same position & blank lines at end of data files.
Added: All teams now checked that they cost less than £30m.

2.25 - Forgot to allow for two drivers being given position zero! This is
allowed, and is now fixed.

2.26 - Theoretically (ie I haven't tested it) 2.26 should compile and run
under MS-DOS. See the file MS-DOS.TXT for more information.

2.27 - Between zero and six drivers can score in the warmup now. Added 't'
flag to allow driver's who did not start to keep their qualification
points.

2.28 - The -c option was not listing the last chassis/engine. Now fixed. The
`Missing position' error was added.

2.29 - Two enhancements to the -r output: The teams' positions are now
listed (including equal positions if these arise) and the highest possible
scoring team for the race is calculated.

2.30 - New output, -s, produces tables capable of being read by a
spreadsheet.

2.31 - Improved error checking and messages. Minor bug fixed which gave the
wrong position when two teams had the same score in the -r output.

2.32 - Fixed a bug in the position calculations in the -r output.

2.33 - Tidied up the code and and added the best/worst possible scores.

2.34 - Fixed a bug which caused extraneous output to be produced if FGP was
compiled with optimisation.

2.35 - Output was tidied slightly.

2.36 - Couldn't use all 6 command line options at the same time. Fixed.

2.37 - Added ordered list of team scores for the current race. Suggested by
Martin Colbert.

2.38 - If no £1m drivers had raced, the best/worst scores didn't work.
Fixed.

2.39 - Equalised MS-DOS and other versions. Allowed more than 16 races.
@endnode

@node "Future" "FGP - The Future  "
What does the future hold for FGP?

Version 2.36 should, not counting bug fixes, be the last 2.xx version of
FGP. Version 3.00 is currently in the planning stage and will hopefully
include:

User definable rules. I've been looking at the rules to Top Gear's Fantasy
Formula One to see if I could write a program which could cope with those
rules as well. The most likely solution to this would be to have a seperate
file containing the rules;

Trading. In the real F1, drivers seem to drop in and out of teams with
alarming speed. Being stuck with a driver who started the season well but
has been replaced by a mediocre driver with a few million to splash around
can be annoying. Trading would allow an owner, at the cost of some of his
points, to swap one driver for another.

Version 3.00 will remain highly portable, working, hopefully, on Amigas,
Unix boxes and PCs.

 ***** Fantasy Grand Prix *****
 ******************************@{ub}@{fg text}

 @{b}******** How It Works ********@{ub}

You are a Grand Prix team manager with a budget of £30 million. To build
your fantasy team you must buy five elements; three drivers, one chassis and
one engine. From the @{"shopping list" link "shop" 0} must select any three drivers, but one of
them has to be from the £1 million price bracket. All of your drivers can be
currently racing in Grands Prix, but if you wish you can gamble on a test
driver getting a call-up to a top team, bearing in mind that the driver
line-ups changed dramatically during 1994.

Once you have chosen your team, you cannot change it, but you may enter as
many teams as you like.

Points are awarded for the real-life performances of each element of your
team in the races, so the skill is in picking a combination most likely to
score you points.

First a few ground rules:

o you must not exceed your budget of £30m;

o you must not select a driver twice or choose a test driver who costs more
than £1m.  

 @{b}******** How To Score ********@{ub}

Points are awarded according to the results of the year's grands prix.

Your team will score in the following way.  If a driver finishes in the top
six he scores 10  points, plus the points awarded in real-life - 10, 6, 4,
3, 2 and 1 for the first six drivers across the line. The table shows the
Fantasy value of each of the top six positions.

     @{fg shine}+--------------+
     |Result  Points|
     |  1       20  |
     |  2       16  |
     |  3       14  |
     |  4       13  |
     |  5       12  |
     |  6       11  |

All your drivers are eligible to score, and can also gain extra points for
the following:

o Autosport will name a `Driver of the Day' after each Grand Prix for a
particularly outstanding performance. This is worth five bonus points.

o Drivers score one point for each place they've made over their qualifying
position. Points are not deducted for those who lose places relative to
their grid position, but you lose five points if your driver posts the
race's first retirement, four if it's the second and so on down to a
one-point loss for the fifth retirement. The retirement order will be taken
from the FIA's Official Results, issued after each Grad Prix. Should more
than one car retire at the same time, the positions will be taken on the
order of car number.

o The fastest driver on race day warm-up will collect six points, with five
points for the second quickest driver and so on down to a point for the
sixth quickest. Non-qualification for a Grand Prix means a deduction of five
points. If a driver is on the FIA's published starting grid, but fails to
take the start, no points will be deducted. Drivers who are disqualified or
removed from the results for any reason will lose all points gained that
weekend. Any driver not competing in a Grand Prix weekend scores no points.

o Chassis score in the same way as the drivers for a `top six' finish (ie
10pts for finishing in the top six, plus the actual points; 10, 6, 4, 3, 2
and 1). Only the first chassis home can score per team. So, if there are two
cars from the same team in the top six, the `seventh' placed car will pick
up a point for coming `sixth'. Points are deducted for the first five cars
to retire on the same basis as for the drivers. Again, if two chassis are
out early enough to both lose points, the deduction is only for the first
example.

o The engines follow the same rules as chassis the chassis (ie 10pts for
finishing in the top six, plus the actual points; 10, 6, 4, 3, 2 and 1) but
with no retirement penalties.
