Before compiling FGP under MS-DOS the file FGP.h should be edited
so that there is a line reading

#define MSDOS

Compilation under MS-DOS requires a huge memory model. Note also
that the main() and raceoutput() functions are currently too big
to be optimised should you attempt this (at least under Visual C).

To use FGP follow the instructions in the documentation but note
that any files which end in ``.fgp2'' should end in ``.fgp'' under
MS-DOS.
