THIS GAME IS FREEWARE, PLEASE SPREAD IT...

Requirements: A std. issue Amiga with min 512k Chip- and 200k Fast-mem
              CAN NOT USE A GFX-BOARD!!!

Description: An A***NOID thing with gravity and HAM mode GFX.
The source in blitz can only be used IF you name your game something
else!!

Bugs: The ball does not behave 100% correct, since i need at least
3 points rather than 2, to calculate the rebounce from a brick on sharp
angles. But considering speed versus accuracy i opted for speed. (It could
be improved by replacing some routines with assembly)

Future: It depends on you! If there is some interrest, and thus EMAIL, well
then further improvements WILL come, otherwise not. So if you have an opinion,
drop me a line or so...



Knowledge is power, thus I am powerless...
