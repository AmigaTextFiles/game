WHAT IS KISS? WHAT IS "KISEKAE"?

  Kisekae is Japanese for "changing clothes". It's a popular play for
little girls. They are given "kisekae ningyou (dolls for changing
clothes)" and play changing clothes of the dolls. And, girls' manga
magazines sometimes provide paper dolls and clothes for kisekae.

  Kiss (KISekae Set system) simulates kisekae with paper dolls on your
computer. The Kiss system consists of a Kiss program and Kiss data. A
Kiss data is a set of pictures. The Kiss program displays the
character with several clothes (dress, shirt, socks, shoes, hat etc)
and allows you to changing the clothes by manipulating them.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT FILES DO I NEED? HOW CAN I GET KISS DATA?

  To play with Kiss you need a Kiss program and Kiss data. Kiss
programs are so far available for the following platforms:

file name	platform		conformance(*)
---------	--------		--------------
KISS237 .LZH	NEC PC-9801		KISS/GS3?
KISS68D .LZH	Sharp X68000		KISS/GS1?
KSTW237 .LZH	Fujitsu FM-TOWNS	KISS/GS3?
KIS237_5.LZH	PC/AT PC-DOS, DOS/V	KISS/GS3
WKISS056.LZH	Microsoft Windows 3.1	KISS/GS4?
KissMac4.LZH	Macintosh		KISS/GS3?
xkis200c.tar.gz	X11R4 or later		KISS/GS4
AmiKiss11.lha	AmigaDOS		KISS/GS1?

(*)Description about KISS/GS is not done yet.

  Choose an appropriate one for your computer.
  The older version of Kiss for DOS/V did not work on plain PC-DOS
(MS-DOS) and you needed a TSR named "japanit" unless you have DOS/V
(the Japanese version of DOS). The latest version, however, should
work well not only on DOS/V but on plain DOS. (N.B. It needs 256(or
more)-color video card and VESA SVGA BIOS.)

  Any other files except above are probably Kiss data files. They
often contain such a string like "KISS" or "KS" in their file name.
  Kiss programs, data and related documents can be obtained from the
following places:

	ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/mu/mughi/Kiss
	ftp://ftp.tcp.com/pub/anime-manga/software/KISS
	ftp://ftp.sunet.se/pub/tv+movies/anime-manga/software/KISS
	Chaos BBS (Australia, +613 427 0254, 14400bps, 24 hours)

(ftp.tcp.com is also known as venice.tcp.com for historical reasons :-)

WARNING: Because management of ftp.tcp.com seems to be suspended for a
while, the Kiss programs there, especially the PC-DOS and Windows
versions, are now somewhat obsolete. It is discouraged to download
Kiss programs from ftp.tcp.com.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT KINDS OF KISS DATA ARE AVAILABLE?

  Most Kiss data are taken from female characters in anime/manga. If I
give you any examples you may be familiar with, there are Sailor
senshi, Hime-chan, Ranma-chan, Skuld and so on.
  There are many Kiss data whose picture is taken from shoujo manga
(comics for girls), which may be unfamiliar to you.
  In addition some weird Kiss data appear these days. For example,
Mobile Suits, battleships etc.
  The file "kissdata.lst.ver.x.x" lists currently available Kiss data.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW CAN I DEAL WITH THOSE .LZH FILES?

  .LZH files are archived with LHA, the most popular archiver in
Japan. Now the LHA archiver is available for many platforms such as 
MS-DOS, UNIX, Macintosh and Amiga. Get the LHA archiver for your 
computer and extract the .LZH files.
  Note that some of .LZH files may contain files whose name is in
Japanese (kana and/or kanji), which would seem to be a sequence of
strange characters on systems incapable of Japanese.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW CAN I PLAY?

(now compiling)
  When you run the Kiss program, it usually displays the main screen
(where the character and clothes are), two rows of buttons numbered
from 1 to 10, a Save button and a Quit button. The first row chooses a
pattern of clothes out of ten. The second row chooses a palette group.
  You can change the clothes by dragging them with the mouse.
  The Save button saves the current arrangement of clothes in the
configuration file. The Quit button finishes the program.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

WHY DO I HAVE TROUBLE TO PLAY WITH SOME DATA?

Problem 1:

  Since Kiss is originally developped for PC-9801, Kiss for PC-9801 is 
a reference of other Kiss programs and all Kiss data. Kiss for PC-9801 
ver.2.18 and 2.24c have the following limitations respectively:

	item			KISS ver 2.24c		KISS ver 2.18
				(KISS/GS1)
	------------		--------------		-------------
	Kisekae area		640x400			448x320
	Max# of objects		128			48
	Max# of cels		128			48

  As you realize the table above, Kiss data designed for ver.2.24c may 
exceed the limitations of ver.2.18. Such data do not work correctly 
on ver.2.18.

  As to Kiss programs for other platforms, most of them conforms to
the specification of Kiss for PC-9801 ver.2.24c. However, the older
version of Kiss for Windows (KISW020F.LZH) conforms only to ver.2.18.
You should throw away it and get the latest version mentioned above.

Problem 2:

  Some of large Kiss data require much memory. On MS-DOS they may
consume not only conventional memory but expanded (EMS) memory. You
have to provide sufficient expanded memory to play with such data.

Problem 3:

  Upper/lower cases of file names in the configuration file could be
problematic if you use case-sensitive platforms such as UNIX and
Macintosh. If cases in the config file do not agree with those of
the actual file names, edit the config file or rename the files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS THE FORMAT OF KISS DATA FILES LIKE?
HOW CAN I MODIFY EXISTING DATA OR MAKE MY OWN DATA?

  The document about data file format is included in the archive file
of Kiss for PC-9801. The English translation of the document is
available in the rec.arts.anime[.info] newsgroup. See the document for
details about the file format.

  You may need assistance tools to facilitate making Kiss data. There
are some released for Japanese PCs such as PC-9801 and FM-TOWNS, but
few for PC-DOS, Macintosh or X window system. There are PCX <=> CEL
converters for PC-DOS.

  As described in the document the file format is so simple that I
hope anyone would make such tools for these platforms.

  Now the new format named KISS/GS is announced. Translation of the
document is in progress.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

CAN I DISTRIBUTE KISS PROGRAM/DATA?

  Distribution conditions are usually stated in the document of the
program/data. In general, Kiss programs have no conditions/restrictions
about distribution, but Kiss data may have some conditions. Unless you
can read the document and follow the conditions,

	YOU MUST NOT DISTRIBUTE ANY KISS DATA

on BBSs or anywhere. When you distribute any Kiss data you should
not modify the contents of the archive file, except the archive format
(e.g. re-archive the files with PKZIP instead of LHA, etc).

  The file "kissdata.lst.ver.x.x" shortly describes distribution
condition of each Kiss data.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

IS THERE ANY USERS' GROUP ABOUT KISS?
