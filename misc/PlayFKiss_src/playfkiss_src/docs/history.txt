Version 2.07 - 10.1.1999:
    - ADDED: New commands: changecol(), changeset(), notify(), debug(),
      iffixed(), ifnotfixed(), ifmapped(), ifnotmapped(), nop()
    - ADDED: New events added: col(), set(), version()
    - ADDED: Internal locale support (but no catalogs availble).
    - ADDED: Current set name appears on a window or screen title bar.
    - FIXED: Kiss path is always set correctly, even if set was taken
      from archive.
    - Kiss: assign is not needed anymore. Instead program's directory is
      used.
    - Minor code optimisations, program should work a bit faster.
    - GUI improved a little.
    - Improved exceptions handling. Now much more informations about
      exception is presented.

Version 2.08 - 22.3.1999:
    - ADDED: Direct Picasso96 support. Enhanced drawing procedures
      especially in windowed mode.
    - FIXED: randomtimer() command was totaly screwed. I didn't have
      enough time to fix that so I removed this command from this
      release.
    - FIXED: ifnotmapped() command works fine. It was cut'n'paste error.
    - FIXED: A stupid mistake caused that objects were invisible when
      moved using update cel regions or update simple square.
    - FIXED: Multiple CNF files selection inside a archive works like
      it should.
    - FIXED: Program allows to overwrite existing CNF file.
