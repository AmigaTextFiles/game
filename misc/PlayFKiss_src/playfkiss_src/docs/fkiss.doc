FKISS v0.20 General Specifications

General format
   All lines containing FKISS statements must begin with ;@ but more than one
   statement can appear on a line.  For example:

                 ;@map(#1) unmap("hat.cel")
                 ...and...
                 ;@map(#1)
                 ;@unmap("hat.cel")
                 ...would have the same effect

   After the ;@ any amount of spaces or tabs may appear before statements:

                 ;@map(#1)
                 ...and...
                 ;@            map(#1)
                 ...are equivalent


Header

   ;@EventHandler
      This is the first line of the FKISS animation/sound code.  It alerts
      FKISS that following lines should be read as FKISS commands.





Actions
   An Action is a command which is immediately executed. The sequence of
   actions in a given event is not defined.  In an ideal implementation, all
   actions defined for a given event would have parallel execution.  Usual
   implementation executes action in listed order.


   ;@map(cel)
      This command takes one argument as a filename defining a single cel.
      Filenames should be surrounded by quotes.
      This causes the given cel or cels to become visible on all pages.

      Examples:
                 ;@map("shirt.cel") ; Causes the cel "shirt.cel" to become
                 visible.  This assumes that shirt.cel is used in some item in
                 the KISS set.  If "shirt.cel" is used in more than one item,
                 only the first (most precedent) usage of "shirt.cel" will be
                 affected.



   ;@unmap(item or cel)
      This command takes one argument as a filename defining a single cel.
      This causes the given cel to become invisible on all pages.  Note
      that all cels belonging to items defined on a given page will begin as
      being visible on those pages.




   ;@altmap(item or cel)
      This command takes one argument as an item number defining a group of
      cels or a filename defining a single cel.
      This causes the given cel or cels to become visible if currently
      invisible or invisible if currently visible.
      If an item number is given and some cels of the item are visible while
      other invisible, each cel is handled seperately so that the cels visible
      become invisible and the invisible cels become visible.




   ;@move(item, x offset, y offset)
      This command takes three arguments.
      The first argument should be an item number defining a group of cels.
      Item numbers should be preceded by a #.
      The second and third arguments should be x and y offsets and can be any
      integer value.
      This causes the item to move by the amount defined by the offsets.  If a
      cel name is given, the whole item that the cel belongs to is moved.
     Example:
                 ;@move(#5, 3, -10) ; Move item #5 by 3 pixels right and 10
                 pixels up





   ;@sound(sound file)
      This command takes one argument as a filename for a sound file and
      immediately plays the given sound.  Filenames should be surrounded by
      quotes.
      Sound file formats generally supported are SUN .AU audio file and
      Microsoft AIFF-WAVE .PCM file.
      Example:
                 ;@sound("boing.au") ; Immediately plays the sound file
                 "boing.au"



   ;@timer(alarm number, delay time)
      This command takes two arguments.
      The first argument should be the number of an alarm defined by FKISS
      code and should be from 0 to 63.
      The second argument should be a time delay in thousandths of a second and
      must be an integer value from 0 to 32767.
      This causes the given alarm command to be run after the given time delay
      passes starting from the execution of this command.  Note that only one
      timer can be active for a given alarm at any time so that, if a timer
      call is still counting down for a given alarm and then another timer call
      gives a new time for that alarm, the new time takes precedence.  Once a
      timer finishes counting down or is over-ridden by another timer, it is
      dismissed.
      If the delay time given is 0, timer is disabled.
      Example:
                 ;@timer(12, 6000) ; Causes alarm 12 to be executed after 6
                                     seconds
                 ;@timer(15, 0)    ; Causes current timer for alarm 15 to be
                                     deactivated and forgotten about





Action Groups
   An Action Group is an Action Group command followed by a series of Actions
   which are executed when the given Action Group is called.  All Actions
   listed after an Action Group command are considered part of the Action Group
   until another Action Group commands is encountered.



   ;@initialize()
      This command signifies that the following actions should be executed
      immediately when the data set is loaded.  This is useful for unmapping
      cels or items that should be invisible at start up or for starting timers
      which begin from start up.
      Initialization takes place before the data set becomes visible.
      Example:
                 ;@initialize()
                 ;@  unmap(#5)
                 ;@  sound("welcome.wav")



   ;@begin()
      This command signifies that the following actions should be executed
      immediately after the data set first becomes visible.
      Example:
                 ;@begin()
                 ;@  timer(15,3000)



   ;@end()
      This command signifies that the following actions should be executed
      immediately when the data set is being unloaded at the end of use.
      Example:
                 ;@end()
                 ;@  sound("byebye.wav")
      This would cause the sound file "byebye.wav" to be played when the
      user stops using the data set by loading a new set or quitting KISS.        




   ;@alarm(number)
      This command takes one argument identifying it as a given alarm number.
      Alarm number need not be listed in numerical order and there may be gaps
      between alarm numbers.  (In other words, if the only alarms defined are
      6, 3, 17, and 284, that's okay.)
      This command should be followed by a series of actions to be executed
      when the alarm is called.  Alarms can only be called by timer() commands.
      Example:
                 ;@alarm(15) map(#5) unmap(#6) timer(16, 6000)
                 ;@alarm(16)
                 ;@  map(#6) unmap(#5)
                 ;@  timer(15, 6000)
      In our begin() example, alarm 15 was called at start up to begin
      after three seconds.  Here we define alarm 15 as making item 5 visible
      again, making item 6 invisible, and starting a timer for alarm 16 after 6
      second.
      Alarm 16 we defined as putting item 6 back on-screen, clearing item 5
      again, and starting a timer for alarm 15.  In this way, you can create
      endlessly looping cycles for things like eyes that blink every 10 seconds
      or a neon sign that flickers on the backdrop.




   ;@press(item or cel)
      This command takes one argument as an item number defining a group of
      cels or a filename defining a single cel.
      It causes any following actions to be executed when the user clicks on
      the given item or cel.
      This applies whether the item is moveable or not.




   ;@catch(item or cel)
      This command takes one argument as an item number defining a group of
      cels or a filename defining a single cel.
      It causes any following actions to be executed when the user clicks on
      the given item or cel.
      This applies only to moveable items.




   ;@fixcatch(item or cel)
      This command takes one argument as an item number defining a group of
      cels or a filename defining a single cel.
      It causes any following actions to be executed when the user clicks on
      the given item or cel.
      This applies only to non-moveable items but not maximum non-moveable
      items.





   ;@release(item or cel)
      This command takes one argument as an item number defining a group of
      cels or a filename defining a single cel.
      It causes any following actions to be executed when the user has clicked
      on the given item or cel and now releases it.
      You can use this in tandem with the catch() command to have an item of
      clothing change shape as if being opened to put over the doll and then go
      back to normal when the user releases it, presumably on the doll.
      This applies whether the item is moveable or not.




   ;@drop(item or cel)
      This command takes one argument as an item number defining a group of
      cels or a filename defining a single cel.
      It causes any following actions to be executed when the user has clicked
      on the given item or cel and now releases it.
      You can use this in tandem with the catch() command to have an item of
      clothing change shape as if being opened to put over the doll and then go
      back to normal when the user releases it, presumably on the doll.
      This can only be used on moveable items.





   ;@fixdrop(item or cel)
      This command takes one argument as an item number defining a group of
      cels or a filename defining a single cel.
      It causes any following actions to be executed when the user has clicked
      on the given item or cel and it now snaps back to starting position.
      You can use this in tandem with the fixcatch() command to have an item of
      clothing change shape as if being opened to put over the doll and then go
      back to normal when the user releases it, presumably on the doll.
      This applies only to non-moveable items but not maximum non-moveable
      items.




   ;@unfix(item or cel)
      This command takes one argument as an item number defining a group of
      cels or a filename defining a single cel.
      It causes any following actions to be executed when the user has clicked
      on the item or cel enough times that the item's fixedness has counted
      down.  This can only be used once from start up.
      Example:
                 #12.20 hat.cel  ; Defining an object with fixedness of 20
                 [...intervening stuff omitted...]
                 ;@unfix(#12) sound("hatsoff.wav")
                 In this example, when the user has clicked on the hat 20 times
                 so that it now becomes moveable, the sound "hatsoff.wav" will
                 be played.




   ;@set(page number)
      This command takes one argument as a page number defined in the data set.
      It causes any following commands to be executed when the user switches to
      that page.
