This is an unfinished effort. It is freely redistributable.

It is released for the review of other AMOS programmers or whoever. I am
hoping to get some feedback.

BlackCoastRaider features a rather huge map of a world which borrows heavily
from worlds created by Robert E. Howard, Phillip Jose' Farmer, John Norman
and others.

Let me know if you like _BlackCoastRaider_
