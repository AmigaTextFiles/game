Hi,

CD to the directory with all and run the amos program "BlackCoastRaider"
to get an idea on how this all fits together. It runs a lot smoother
compiled so compile it if you like.

I think this should run on any 1 meg chip RAM or better machine.

The file BC_Tool.amos is a semi-smart program which will attempt to gather
all the iff land maps into a single .abk file which the program uses. It
takes a long while and probably depends that all the land maps share the
same palette, currently an 8 colour palette.

The 8 directional ship icons are used as sprites by the program. If you
want to do more than 4 colours in improving these (great!) I will have to
change the program to make these bobs. There is a single iff with all the
ship icons on it called "sailboat.pic"  which should be easiest to work
with.

Similarly, you are welcome to use all the colours you need right up to
HAM on the maps but the palettes must be matched somehow. One thing: the
land maps fit precisely together so _stay within the outlines_ if you
want them to stay that way. If you inadvertently go out, I can make a
simple program to fix it though.

The other iffs are self explanatory; feel free to improve or replace them.
Their palettes are independent.

I hope it works. Good luck and thanks!
