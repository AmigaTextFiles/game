The game is in german only, but that should be no problem.
When you start the game there are four buttons :

 1. Schwierigkeitsgrad (Level)
	einfach : easy
	mittel	: medium
	schwer	: hard (but not too hard)
 2. Info :
      Some info about the game.
 3. Highscore : Highscore for the selected level.
 4. Start : start playing
            When you start playing you first have to set your own ships on
            the left grid. You do this by clicking on the start and the end
            field. The ships must lay vertically or horizontally and there
            must be one place left around them.
            Then you can start shooting on your opponents ships in the right
            grid by clicking on certain fields.
  5. Ende : stop playing / quit the game


  The game is freeware, so enjoy it. If you have any comments please send
