Notes on re-assembling files.
-----------------------------

Nearly all my source files include the file "std" which contains loads
of handy macros and equates. This file is in the root directory.

All assembler source files on this disk have been assembled using
Hisoft's latest "Devpac 3.01" 68030 assembler.
As such the source files do not contain any assembler option directives
since these are set thru a much friendlier Intuition-based control panel.

The options which I set for my source files are:

"Assembler Control"
-------------------
all defaults except Include set to "INCLUDE:"

"Assembler Options"
-------------------
all defaults except Processor set to "68030"

"Assembler Optimisations"
-------------------------
Options which are ON   mean the conversion takes place without warning.
Options which are WARN mean the conversion takes place with    warning.

MOVE.L to QUICK		ON
MOVEA.L	to SHORT	WARN
ADD/SUB to QUICK	ON
ADDA/SUBA to LEA	ON
LEA to ADDQ/SUBQ	ON
Absolute addressing	ON
Indirect displacements	ON
Base Displacements	WARN
Outer Displacements	WARN
Forward Branches	WARN
Backward Branches	ON
Null Branches to NOP	WARN


This information should enable anyone to produce EXACT copies of the binaries
on this disk (using Devpac 3).
