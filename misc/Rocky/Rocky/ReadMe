			Program Title : Rocky Clone
			---------------------------
			Author : Laurence Vanhelsuwé
			----------------------------

1. How to "install":
   -----------------

	The executable is called "ROCKY" and its only run-time file
	is called "chars".
	Make sure "chars" is in the current directory when ROCKY is run.

2. How to play it:
   ---------------

	This is a multi-level Boulderdash clone written in
	assembler (from START: to END).

	Use a joystick in PORT #2 to move your character about or use
	the following keys:
		ESCAPE	to quit game
		ENTER	to commit suicide
		SPACE	to pause game

		p	to move right
		o	to move left
		w	to move up
		s	to move	down
	(there's no keyboard equivalent for the FIRE button on a joystick).

	The goal is to clear each level by collecting enough
	gems to enable the exit to the next level.
	There are 40 problem-packed (solvable) levels in all.
	
	Each level contains an evil mixture of nasties, obstacles
	and puzzles to solve.

	The game is addictive enough to dispense with all the blurb about
	what all the game features are....
	Play it and discover !
	
	The universal rules though are:
	Use common sense when dealing with gravity and...
	always be on your guard with moving things!

	If you ever get stuck under an avalanche of rocks, press ENTER to
	commit suicide!

3. Notes for hackers/programmers:
   ------------------------------

	The program is fundamentally a version of LIFE !
	In LIFE a cell can only be in 2 states : dead (empty) or
	alive (full).
	In this game each cell can be in any of over 100 states !
	And like in LIFE, during each scan of the two dimensional
	array, cells look at their immediate neighbors to determine
	their next state.
	The simplest cells in Rocky are the "air" and "grass" cells.
	Their state handlers do nothing at all. 
	A "rock" on the other hand would look at the cell immediately
	below it to see if it could "occupy" that position and leave
	"air" behind ...
	"Gems" behave very similarly to rocks.
	When playing the game you'll notice that rocks behave a
	bit more realistically than described above.
	
	The only "cells" that deviate significantly from this
	cellular automaton mechanism are Rocky itself and cells
	that are part of a snake.
	Rocky isn't controlled by an algorithm but by.... you.
	Since the snakes defied any kind of clean implementation
	using the normal mechanisms, they are actually implemented
	by superimposing a standard "snake game" on top of the
	classic Boulderdash mechanism!

	It makes you wonder how the cells in a multi-cell organism
        stick together!!

	
	For the hackers: the graphics for the game are stored as
	a 3 plane 320*200 screen (file "chars").
	To simplify upgrades/changes there's also the IFF file
	from which the straight bitplane data was created (using
	IFFCon). Note that the screen colors are hardcoded in the
	program (find LoadRGB4 and you're there..).
	
	I've written the program relatively Amiga-friendly.
	The major exception is for the joystick....
		move.w	joy0dat(a0),d0		; OK ?




	If anybody out there would like to redraw the graphics or
	use better colors...
	
	Any comments,ideas or bug reports?
