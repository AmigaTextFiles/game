@NODE Intro "Introduction to V1.1"

 @{b}Welcome to DiamondGfx V1.1@{ub}

 Using this program you are able to create your own gfx-file for Diamond
 Caves.

 Please read @{"The main window" Link MainWindow} on how to work with DiamondGfx.

 This program is based on MUI, see @{"About MUI" Link Mui}.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Req "Requirements"

 @{b}Requirements@{ub}

 @{u}DiamondGfx@{uu} V1.1 requires:

 - Kick 2.0
 - MUI 2.3 (3.x recommended)
 - a registered version of Diamond Caves
 - Commodore's Installer (can be found on your Workbench-Install-Disk)

 This program has beed tested with Enforcer, Mungwall and CodeWatcher.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Install "Installation"

 @{b}Installation@{ub}

 @{u}DiamondGfx@{uu} comes with a ready-to-run installer-script for the Commodore
 Installer. Just click on the icon and follow the text in the window.

 Basically, the script will copy all necessary files in the Directory "DC:"
 according to the present version.

@ENDNODE

@NODE MainWindow "The main window"

 In the @{u}main window@{uu} you are able to select the directory where you've
 stored the IFF-files (containing all the gfx) and the destination file you
 want the final gfx-files saved into.

 @{b}Start@{ub} will initiate the creation-process. A progress display shows what's
 going on at the moment.

 @{b}Exit@{ub} will leave the program.

 If you want to draw your own graphics, please read @{"Creating own graphics" Link OwnGfx}.

 To use your graphics-file in Diamond Caves, you have to select it in @{"Diamond Prefs" Link DC:DiamondPrefs.guide/Game 72}.

@ENDNODE

@NODE OwnGfx "Creating own graphics"

 Creating own graphics for Diamond Caves is not very difficult, all you
 need is a paint program and these guidelines:

 - every picture must be @{u}320x256@{uu} pixels in dimensions

 - the file @{u}Score.br@{uu} must be @{u}320x14@{uu} pixels in dimensions

 - every picture must be of the @{u}same depth@{uu}.
 Diamond Caves supports depth from 1 (2 colors) up to 8 (256 colors - AGA).

 - the @{u}depth and colors@{uu} used in the game are taken from the file
 @{u}Earth.br@{uu}, so make sure at least this file has the right colors

 - the brush @{u}Score.br@{uu} uses the @{u}same colors@{uu} as every other picture

 - the numbers (0,1,2,...) in the file @{u}Earth.br@{uu} must be @{u}14 pixels high@{uu}
 with one blank line above and below them. This is because they are used
 in the @{u}Score.br@{uu} picture to display Score, Time and Emeralds.

 - don't save the pictures with some kind of @{u}mask@{uu} (stencil).

 - remember that some items (Boulders, Emeralds, ...) are present in @{u}many files@{uu}
 and not only in their own.
