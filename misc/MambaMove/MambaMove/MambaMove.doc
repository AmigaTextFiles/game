    Well, there is not much to say about Mamba Move here, except that you
    do not need the fire button on your joystick for the game, it has no
    function at all (this is a peacefull game)! . A short description of
    the game is provided inside it. If you decide to copy the package do not
    forget to copy the raiders.sound with it, it is a lot of fun!
    Use a topaz 8 sized font in your Workbench (an 80 column display), or
    the screen will get a bit messed up.
    The source codes have been included to show you how it runs. If you want
    to recreate the file, the Aztec 3.6a is needed and a utility, that trans-
    forms the brush into C-source. Use the +L -S options when compiling, and
    the +cd for linking. As said in the legal department: if you recreate the
    file or use parts of it to create a program that is similiar in purpose
    to Mamba Move you are not able to errect a copyright on it or make it
    shareware!


    Anyway, HAVE FUN!!!!!
