                             by Fredrik Lidberg 1994
                           ---------------------------

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
     - Enough memory to be run, ca 730 Kb (which of at least 380 Kb
       should be CHIPMEM).
     - PAL-mode. The program can switch between PAL and NTSC when pressing TAB
       so if your system is NTSC and you have ECS/AGA and a monitor that can
       handle NTSC-PAL switching you can run it too.
     - A Joystick.
     - Any Amiga Computer.

you should send me a postcard, that way you can also tell me about bugs
you find, things you want changed, added or whatever.

Every response I get will encourage me to code a new game and/or improve
'Pengo 2' in the ways you want.

I take no responsability for any damages this program will make to
you, your family, your work, your computer or whatever.


DESCRIPTION:
------------
'Pengo 2' is programmed in Assembler (of course) and everything is
nicely done (as nice as possible). It has been developed on an Amiga500+
(kick2.0) with 1MByte Chip and 2MByte Fast. It has been tested
on a 1.3 Machine, and also an A1200, and worked without any problems.

There should be no problem running it on any Amiga-computer ranging
from A500 to A4000, on any 680x0-processor. If you however should have
some problems, please let me know.

The program will take over the System completely when it is run, but
it will give it back when you quit the game (no need to reboot).

Hiscores will be saved in the same directory, from which you start
the program in the file 'Pengo2.Highscore'.

When the program is started it will also try to load a file called
'Pengo2.Extralevels'. This file is not included in the original package
but if I get time and enough postcards :-) I might do and release
some extralevels. Perhaps even a 'MakeYourOwnLevels'-program (got to be
many postcards then :-). This file, 'Pengo2.Extralevels', (if released)
should be located in the same directory as the 'Pengo2'-program.


INSTALLING:
-----------
'Pengo 2' doesn't need any special kind of installation. Just place
it wherever you want.

No highscore-file is included in this package. It will be created in the
the directory you start the game from, the first time you play.

To reset the highscores just delete the highscore-file 'Pengo2.Highscore'. 


BUGS:
-----
There are no known bugs.

THANKS:
-------
Thanks, in advance, for all those lovely postcards all of you :)
are gonna send me.


THANKS ALSO:
------------
Thanks to those who did support my previous game, The Last Tetris. There's
an intro-screen with your names in the game. (Hope I didn't forget anyone.)


P.S. Let's beat that number of Postcards I got for The Last Tetris, with
     this game, please. I sure of hell has put down a lot more work in
     'Pengo 2', than in 'The Last Tetris'.



STARTING Pengo 2 :
--------------------------
It can be started from CLI or Workbench (using it's icon)
without any problems.

First you will see a screen with some info about this game
being CardWare and so on, my address is included there too.
Press fire when you have finished reading that screen. This will lead
you into the real game.

First there are some Intro-screens, with highscore tables and much more.
(Pressing SPACE will let you move fast between these screens)

Pressing fire, will take you to the Main-Intro-screen, where a
'Requester' will pop up, from which you can choose to start the game
(at the CURRENT mission), or to enter a Mission-password.

Choosing Start, will of course start the game.

Choosing Password, will let you change the CURRENT mission by entering
a new password.

(Whenever you complete a mission, the CURRENT mission-password will be
updated with the new mission-password.)


KEYS:
-----
Always:

          TAB       = NTSC/PAL-switch (make sure your monitor can handle
                      this)

During Intro-Screens:
               
          Esc       = Quit the program and return to Workbench or CLI.
                      Highscores will be saved upon quitting the program.

          SPACE     = Will let you move fast between the Intro-screens.

During game:

          Esc       = Quit game, and return to Intro-screens.

          Q         = Kill Pengo, restart level with the loss of 1 life.

          P         = Pause game, until pressed again.



THE GOAL OF Pengo 2 :
---------------------
In some silly way Pengo, has got himself up to the North Pole. Your
goal is to get him back home to the Antarctic. To do so, you have
to 'battle' your way through 10 different locations (missions) around
the world, each consisting of 5 levels. Each mission has some sort
of sub-story, always concerning getting diamonds together, and a
picture of the place which will be shown when starting the mission.

If you complete all 50 levels, you will get to see an end-of-game-sequence.
(I hope you will see it.)
 
To complete a level you have to make a specified number of LINES in a
certain amount of time.

The levels in each mission get increasingly more difficult. That is
level 1 is the easist and level 5 the hardest. The next mission's
level 1 will however not be harder than the previous mission's level 5.
It will be just slighty harder than the previous mission's level 1.
And so on ...

You start with 5 lives, and you will get an extralife for every
completed Mission.


LINES:
------
To make a LINE you have to push together at least 3 diamonds in a row (horiz.
or vert.). If you get 4 diamonds in a row this will also count as 1 LINE,
BUT if you get 5 diamonds in a row, it will count as 2 LINES. In some levels
you will have to make these 5-diamonds-in-a-row. Notice that, whenever
3 or more diamonds are in a row they will magically disappear, so you will
have to use a special tactic to get 5 diamonds in a row.

Example (X=diamond)
-----------------------------------------------
First get the diamonds like this        XX XX

                                          X
-----------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------
and then do this                        XXXXX


-----------------------------------------------

Some examples of LINE-counting:

XXX            1 line

X              1 line
X
X

XXX            2 lines
 X
 X

XXX            2 lines
X
X

XXXXX          2 lines

XXXXX          3 lines
  X
  X


I think you get it.



BLOCKS:
-------
'Pengo 2' has more blocks than the original Pengo (if you're familiar with
that game). The blocks which are special are:

Ice                 Can be pushed or melted.
Diamonds            Can be pushed and be made into lines.
False Diamonds      Can be pushed but can't be made into lines.
Gravel              Can be walked upon by Pengo and monsters but
                    stops 'moving' blocks.
Stones              Can be pushed, and make a path of Gravel behind them.
Water               Is deadly for Pengo, but can be made to disappear
                    by pushing a block into it.
Snow                Stops 'moving' blocks. Vanishes when walked upon.

Any other blocks only function as walls.

I don't think you will have any problems with which block is which, accept
maybe for the false diamonds. The false diamonds have a small 'crack' in
one side (it can be on any side (upper,lower,right or left)).


STEERING:
---------
You move Pengo with a joystick. Pushing the joystick either way will make
Pengo walk in that direction if nothing is in the way. To push a block
you have to move against the block for a short period of time before it
gets hurled away in the direction you pushed it. (ie keep the stick in that
direction until the block moves). To melt iceblocks, do the same while
keeping the firebutton pressed. Keep it pressed until the iceblock melts.

Notice that you can't melt anything else but the iceblocks, and for example
a diamond can't be pushed if you hold your button pressed. And don't keep
pressing and releasing the firebutton when you're in the melting process.
Releasing the firebutton will stop the melting process, so that you would
have to restart the process.


MONSTERS:
---------
Of course, there are monsters to avoid and kill. A lot of them, 8 different
species, with different "AIs", some very stupid and others very clever.

The one and only way to kill monsters is to push blocks on them.
They won't stay dead for ever though, after something like 10 secs they
will appear (flashing) again at same spot they were killed. They will flash
for around 3 secs before they start moving. The monsters aren't deadly when
they flash and they can't be killed either. 

The more difficult monsters will appear first in later missions.

Monsters include:

Joe Driller and his Drillabouts:
--------------------------------
Joe Driller, secretly hating penguins, steers his machines through remote-
control, drilling holes through ice and snow, whenever he feels like it.
Well, you will probably notice that he doesn't like your kind....

Meaning:  1 They can drill ice, snow.
          2 They try to get you, most of the time.

The Piranha brotherhood:
------------------------
They have no trouble sniffing Pengo out, but only go wild when
they smell blood....

Meaning:  1 They try to get you all the time.

SecuriCorp Spikes:
------------------
If you hate needles don't get under one of these rolling spikedrums.
Although, if you know what you're doing they should be no problem,
since they are the most stupid security devices ever seen.

Meaning:  1 They move back and forth.

The Snowies:
------------
These newly discovered creatures, seem only to have three things on there
mind, Rolling,Rolling and Rolling. Scientists have discovered that some
favour the clockwise-roll and others the anticlockwise-roll.

Meaning:  1 They roll, turning when they have to, or when it's possible.
          2 They roll either clock- or anticlockwise (watch the eyes).

The evil Frogmen:
-----------------
Fast moving bastards they sure are, turning without warning, always trying
to slip the dagger in Pengo.

Meaning:  1 They move fast.
          2 They stop when they feel like it or when they have to.
          3 When they stop they turn in the direction Pengo is. 

Firedevils:
-----------
Wandering around aimlessly, these little buggers don't do much harm.

Meaning:  1 They just move around randomly.
          2 They often stay in a certain area.

Snaky Hammerhead and his kids:
------------------------------
Pushing things is one thing they like, another is frightening penguins.

Meaning:  1 They can push blocks.
          2 They try to get you most of the time.

Bovini and his collection of rude crabs:
----------------------------------------
These can a real pain in the arse, both literary speaking and in real life,
since they always try to sneak up behind you and pinch you in your butt.
And they sure move fast when they see that butt.

Meaning:  1 They move fast and home in on you when you're not 'looking'
            in their direction.
          2 They move slow, and try to get away from you when you 'look'
            in their direction.




SCORING:
--------

Melting an iceblock                  10 points
Making a line of 3 diamonds         500 points
Making a line of 4 diamonds         650 points
Making a line of 5 diamonds        1000 points

MONSTERKILL-SCORING:
--------------------
The more times you kill a specific monster the more score
you will get. Score can range from 50-250 increasing with 50
everytime you kill that monster.

If you have the killer-instinct and can kill 4 or more monsters
so that they are dead at the same time, goldcoins will appear
at random in the 'maze'. The goldcoins will stay for 8 secs, so get
'em fast because they will get you 1000 points.

BONUS-SCORING
-------------
TIME left when level completed       10 points per sec. left
FORMATION (diamonds left)          5000 points per diamond
WARP if you start on level 1-9    20000 points per startinglevel

Other silly bonuses concerning different statistics might appear if
you do something special.



HINTS:
------

 - A monster that has nowhere to go will commit suicide.
 - Try to learn each monster's movement-pattern.
 - Use Pause when you decide where to put your diamonds.
 - Be logical.
 - More or less all levels can be solved in many different ways.
