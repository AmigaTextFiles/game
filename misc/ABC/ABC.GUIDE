@node "ABC_About" "About..."

        I am a single father of two lovely daughters, I also program.
        So, to get their interest in computers I have let them "play"
        with my AMIGA 500. One thing that I have noticed is that they
        have trouble moving the mouse and selecting gadgets. So I decided
        to write an educational program that would let them use the mouse
        to select gadgets.
        They are young and are still learning their ABC's so what else
        was I to write ...
        
        The program will load and welcome you to the program ( my sister
        is the digitized voice and she was a little nervous, so forgive
        her)  the screen is layed out somthing like this:
         _________________________________________________
        |                                               |
        |       _________                       ____    |
        |       |       |                       |  |<2> |
        |       |       |                       |__|    |
        |       |  <1>  |                               |
        |       |       |                               |
        |       |       |                               |
        |       |_______|                               |
        |                                         _____ |
        | [A][B][C][D][E][F][G][H][I][J][K][L][M]| <4>| |
        | <3>                                    |QUIT| |
        | [N][O][P][Q][R][S][T][U][V][W][X][Y][Z]|____| |
        |_______________________________________________|

        And then the voice will ask "Can you find the letter"
        and then the program will pick a letter at random and then
        the voice will say that letter ( there is no delay between
        the two).
        
        All the child has to do is press the correct letter and he/she
        will be rewarded with a nice @{"ringing" system "sys:utilities/multiview correct"} sound. 
        If the child does not choose the corect letter after three (3)
        tries another letter will be asked to be found. There is no wrong
        sound as this does not follow good teaching methods ( I have been 
        reading about education as I plan to write more educational 
        programs for children).
        
        The score box will show the number of correct answers over the
        number of letters asked to be found.
        
                example :    23     
                             26 
        
        In this example the child selected 23 correct letters out
        of 26.
        @{b}@{fg shine}@{bg shadow} SCREEN DISCRIPTION:@{ub}@{fg text}@{bg back}
        
    <1> The big box in the upper left of the screen is the place where
        the letter being questioned is displayed.
        
    <2> The box on the upper right of the screen is a score display it
        means nothing to the child but it is useful for the adult as 
        you can see how well the child is doing.
        
    <3> The gadgets A-Z are for the child to click on after a letter is 
        asked to be found. They may also use the keyboard for input.
        
    <4> Quit: Just hit the quit gadget.

        You may change the following sound files to your liking:
        
                WELCOME: may be changed !
                CORRECT: may be changed !
                
        but the name of the sounds must match the name of the sound
        it will replace.

     I first bought an AMIGA 1000 in April of 1988 and in January of 1989
     I bought a AMIGA 500 ... After writting several games and apps in 
     AmigaBasic I bought HiSoftBasic and continued pushing the limits 
     of the language (YahtzeeV1.2). I decided to learn/teach myself `C'.
     So in 1991 I bought a `C' book and in 1992 I bought SAS/C v6.0 and
     a AMIGA 1200 ...... 
        
     Since then I have released @{"KnightsQuest" link "KQ" 0} and @{"Hawk" link "HAWK" 0}. You can find both
     on Aminet.
     I also write a column in @{"Amiga LinK" link "AL" 0} called @{"Coders Clinic" link "AL" 0}.

     I would like to hear what you think...   ADDRESS: David H. Loeser Jr

@node "AL" "AMIGA LINK - CODERS CLINIC"

        AMIGA LINK is a monthly online magazine that covers the
        Amiga computer. The editor is Josh Galun. It can be FTP'ed
        from several sites on the internet and also from WWW sites
        such as mine < http://www.iglou.com/members/dloeser.html >.
        
        CODERS CLINIC is a column that I contribute to AL. The basis
        of me writing this column is that I have self taught (on the 
        Amiga) myself how to code in `C' and if I can help someone 
        else who desires to code, then GREAT!
