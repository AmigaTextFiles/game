The game of knowledge
by
Lukas Konias

IMPORTANT:All files must be contained in a device called DDAmos:(e.g. a disc named DDAmos:).Otherwise the game will not run.

This is vresion 0.99b ,so be extra careful.I would not advice you to install this game on a hard disc.The ability to save your scores has not been tested but I think it works ok.To do so use a new formated disc.
If you use the Questions editor to add questions load one of the files ending with ".que".After the changes save it with its original name.The old file will be still available but with a name like backup 1.que,backup 2.que and so on.
The rules are simple so I will not explain them.To exit to DOS press CTRL+C.
Right now there are only a few questions included with this version.In case you want more or a Questions editor sent a disc to me including enough money for the expenses.I'm also interested in any help in form of suggestions,bug reports,pictures,samples,modules,more questions etc,etc.My address is:

Enjoy the game!!!

P.S. Don't expect an immediate answer to your letter because I will be probably in Germany.
