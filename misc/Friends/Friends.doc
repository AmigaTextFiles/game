Preface
~~~~~~~
Yep, it's Dynablaster ... again.

You see, to be a registred developer Amiga Technologies insist that you have
released at least ONE commercial game or ONE PD-game. And since I plan to be
a registred developer, I have to release this ... sorry. So, please, no
flames, I *have* to release it.

This game is (as far as I can remember) about two years old. It's not
particulary good, but at least it's made in assembler. There are a few(!)
bugs, which you'll just have to live with (see below).

I planned to make Friends a big game with lots of different things. Then
Masterblaster was released ... and BlitzBomber. Now I really cannot see the
point. On the other hand I must say I'm not quite pleased with either of the
above mentioned game. Although both are great, they feel a little slow.
Masterblaster is by far the best, although the graphics could be more
colourfull. Anyway, if you really (really!) want to make another Dynablaster
clone, just contact me (especially if you can draw). Adress at the end.

Although bug-ridden and rather ugly, I seem to recall Friends can be rather
fun for a while. Give it a try. But PLEASE don't send me any bugreports. I
know, okay?

Let me hasten to tell you that my code is a lot(!) better these days... So
are the games I try to make :)

The same rules apply, as with any other Dynablaster clone. Squash the other
players with the bombs. To be more specific:

Controls
~~~~~~~~
 Although it is rather slobby of me the control method are nondefineable.
The controls goes like this:
 Player One (top left corner) uses joystick in port two.
 Player Two (top right corner) uses joystick in port one.
 Player Three (bottom left corner) uses arrow keypad, and return to drop a
 bomb.

 It's a sad fact that I haven't got 2 joysticks. I mean, come on, I'm
making a multiplayergane and I only have one joystick. It's feeble.
Never the less I feel confident that the controllers work. I haven't
checked player two as well as I might (since it required unplugging my
mouse), so if a bug shows up there contact me.

Bonus Icons
~~~~~~~~~~~
Extra bomb      : Well, it pretty obvious what this one does.
Extra explosion : Extends explosion-radius with one.
Freeze		: Freezes the other players for 5 seconds.
Speedy		: Speeds the player up for 10 seconds
Phoenix		: The baddies return from the grave.
Smiley		: Reset ALL the bonuses the other players have collected

Friends work on
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
My A1200HD, and I would imagine little else :)
Seriously, any A1200 should do, although an accellerator might freak it a bit
out (I made it before I got an accellerator myself). As always no GFX-boards
allowed :(

Known Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~
 By far the worst bug is when you exit ;) To exit the game you just press the
left shift key. DON'T DO IT! Since my code back then was quite terrible, I
must have forgotten to free all the memory. In any case I corrupt the memory
map. You'll have to reboot.

 The enemies are *not* intelligent. This means that there is the
possibility that they will run into some sort of loop. You see, they are
controlled by a lookuptable which determines which way they should go. And
if the chosen direction is blocked by boulder it will pick the next
direction on the list. Theoretically the list can tell the enemy to go into
a 'loop', and it will just run between to point on the screen. I have made
the table rather large, so I don't expect this to happen. It is a
possibility, though.

 If the game should be fair, the bonus-icons would appear randomly. They
don't ...

 When two bombs are activated at the EXACT same time, the bombs will
sometimes be a little messed up. Hopefully this bug is out now, but if you
see it, let me know.

 When you have picked up the speed icon, you can sometimes walk through
bombs. It *is* a bug, but I can't be bothered to correct it.

 Now being a friendly sort of person, I have tried to make Friends as
userfriendly as possible. For example, when you walk around in the
labyrinth it would have been difficult to walk between the block unless you
stood on a precise coordinate. So what I have done is to try to guess your
intent, and steer the player in the right direction. This has resulted in a
glitch. When you pick up the speed icon, the player will make some sort of
break dance when he encounters a barrier. It's just cosmetics and it works,
but it looks fairly stupid. Sorry.

Warranty
~~~~~~~~
None what-so-ever.

Some other stuff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This game is Public Domain or Freeware or whatever ... In any case, you can
do with it what you like, except to alter it in any way. Then again, why
would you want to?

Yep, this is my official I-NEED-TO-BE-A-REGISTRED-DELVEOPER-game.

If you can draw or have any ideas about a game (no texture or vector stuff,
please, I don't have a clue how to do it), please contact me at:

ajensen@diku.dk (preferably) (untill june)

P.S. Isn't it weird, that you have to make a game before Amiga Technologies
will give you the information for you to make one?

P.P.S. I guess the is the first DOC file you have read, where the biggest
part was the bugs-section ;)
