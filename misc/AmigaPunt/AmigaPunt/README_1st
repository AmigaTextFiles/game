            THE AMIGA PUNTER

Can your computer help you in picking winners at Randwick, Flemington, 
wherever?

Well, yes! Perhaps. Maybe........ but then again, who knows?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

From the outset let me say that you should not take this program 
seriously. Consequently, be aware that I make no claims about the
validity of the theories, equations and general guesswork used by the
AMIGAPUNT program to rate race-horses.

I DO NOT ACCEPT ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOSSES, DAMAGES, INABILITY TO 
TO PAY THE RENT, MARITAL BREAK UP, OR  ANY OTHER CATASTROPHES THAT 
MAY RESULT, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY  FROM THE USE OF 'AMIGAPUNT'.

                     D I S T R I B U T I O N.

AMIGAPUNT IS PUBLIC DOMAIN AND MAY BE DISTRIBUTED FREELY PROVIDED NO
PROFIT IS GAINED FROM SUCH ACTIVITIES!




----------------------------------------------------------------------

              INSTALLATION!

Minimal! If you want online help then you should copy the APUNT.HELP
file into your 'T:' directory which is where AMIGAPUNT will look for
it. If it can't find it then you're given the option to select the
APUNT.HELP file via a file requester.

Alternatively you may care to dump APUNT.HELP to your printer. 

I have provided two batch files to install and/ or print 'APUNT.HELP'.
Note that you will need 'ICONX'(WB 1.3)  in your C: directory for the
batch files to work properly.


I also suggest you create a directory to which you can save rated races
for future reference.

            THEORY & GUESSWORK.

The idea for 'AMIGAPUNT' came from an article published in a popular
punting magazine some years ago. The notion is that the factors
affecting a horse's performance and, ultimately, the result of the
race, can be given a value. The article argued that four factors were
at work:

    FACTOR                      VALUE
    -----------------------------------------------------
    
    FITNESS.    
    The general condition of the horse.         30%

    CONSISTENCY
    The 'strike rate' of wins of the
    horse.                      		30%

    WEIGHT
    If the horse carries less than the others
    than that's a bonus            		 20%

    QUALITY
    Breeding and the types of races won
    will determine the quality         		 10%


    CHAOS FACTOR
    Uncertainty                 		10%

       ------------------------------------------------------

AMIGAPUNT takes these ideas considerably further. ELEVEN factors are
identified and are given a default value. The user may change these to
suit his evaluations.

       ------------------------------------------------------   
    
            USING AMIGAPUNT

Ideally you should use a good form guide such as the 'SPORTSMAN'.
Failing that any form giving you last starts details will do. THE
AUSTRALIAN & the SYDNEY MORNING HERALD'S GOLDEN GUIDE will do nicely.

Evaluating race horses is a subjective business so I am not going to
bore you with my pet theories. However, rating systems such as
'AMIGAPUNT' will (probably, as likely as not, perhaps) show best
results if you follow a few rules:

    1)  SELECT QUALITY RACES WHICH HAVE BIG PRIZE MONEY.

    2)  AVOID RACES WHERE MORE THAN 30% OF THE STARTERS
        HAVE NO RECENT FORM.

    3)  SELECT RACES WITH SMALL FIELDS. AVOID RACES WITH
        MORE THAN 14 OR 15 STARTERS.

    4)  BE CONSISTENT IN YOUR APPROACH.


    

ENJOY!
