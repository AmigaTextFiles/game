--Penguin Software--

   If you've seen the title screen, you may have noticed that this game is from
Penguin Software.  Before I describe the game itself, I'd like to tell you a
little about Penguin Software.
   Penguin Software is a shareware only developer.  A couple of guys from Jugger-
naut Software (Nick Bishop) and Impact Productions (Michael Hay) get together and
slap together a game in about a week.  We take a classic PD genre (in this, the
first in what will hopefully be a long series, we use the Pong genre) and do it
better than anyone else.  We think you'll agree that this is far better than
other Pong games out there.  Peguin's next game will be a Tetrisy game.
Except it will be better than all the other crap Tetris games that are currently
out there.
   Incidentally, look out for Impact's newest big game, HYPERACE (available
soon at your favorite shareware source.)  Almost a year in development!
   Juggernaut will be releasing an excellent shareware fighting game in November
or December, as yet untitled.

--Important Note--

   The first time you run the game, you will be asked what processor you
have.  This information is saved in a file called "RefPrefs" in the "S"
directory of your flopy disk or hard drive.  If you want to change the
processor speed, just delete this file.  In case you don't know how, type
the following from a CLI or Shell window:

"cd <the appropriate 'S' directory>"
"delete RefPrefs"

--The Game--

   At the title screen, press your joystick left or right to select one or two
players.  Press fire when your choice is selected.
   If a two player game is selected, Player Two controls the right paddle,
otherwise this paddle is computer controlled.  Player One always controls the left
paddle.
   During the game, press up on the joystick to move your paddle up, and down to
move it down.  If you hold down the fire button while pressing in either of these
directions, your paddle will move faster.
   As play begins, the ball is shot off at a random angle.  The idea is to bounce
the ball off of your paddle and get it past your opponent's while not allowing him
to bounce the ball past you.  The first one to 10 points wins.  If you bounce the
ball near the middle of your paddle, the shot will be slower.  The closer to the
edge of the paddle you hit it, the faster it goes (of course, there's also a greater
chance you'll miss!).  Also, the angle of the ball is more likely to change the
closer to the edge of the paddle it is hit.
   You can press the "p" key to pause the game.  Press any other key to resume play.
During play, press <Esc> to quit to the title screen.  Press <Esc> on the title
screen to quit playing.

--Floppy Disk Install--

   Copy all files and drawers in the Reflection drawer of the archive into
the root directory of a formatted disk. Insert the disk in df0:.  From a
shell or CLI window, type "install df0:"  And that's about it, really.
Reboot, and it loads automatically.

--HD Install--

   To install Reflection to your hard drive, simply copy all the files in the root
directory of the archive to the drawer of your choice on your hard drive.  Copy the
fonts in the Fonts directory of the archive into your FONTS: drawer.  Copy the
libraries in the Libs directory of the archive into LIBS:.  That's it!  The program
runs with no assigns whatsoever.

--Register!--

   This game is shareware.  If you keep it, please send the shareware fee of $5 US
(£3.50) or equivalent in your own currency to the following address:

(Don't worry, Michael will get half!)

   And hey, if a lot of people register, maybe Penguin will spend more than a week on
future games and produce top-quality shareware for the same great low shareware fee!

--Problems?--

This game has only been tested on an '020 A1200. 
If it is unplayably fast (it's supposed to be fast, though) or
incredibly slow on your machine, you can also contact us by e-mail.  Tell us
what processor you have, and what the problem is.  We'll try and correct any
problems in future versions.

bishopn@lahs.losalamos.k12.nm.us
haym@lahs.losalamos.k12.nm.us

If you have an '020 A1200 don't complain about the speed because it is
supposed to be that speed.  Also, if you have a 68000 machine, that's as
fast as it goes.  Tough.
