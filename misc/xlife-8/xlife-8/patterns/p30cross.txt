#C p30 glider crossing demo
#C This demonstrates a device which allows 2 p30 data streams to cross
#C each other.  It uses 3 copies of a remarkably simple p30 signal
#C duplicator found by Dieter Leithner.
#C
#C The crossing works as follows:  Let the input signals be A and B,
#C with A on the left.  Both inputs are copied and inverted; we now
#C have  -A, -A, -B, -B.  The middle signals cross in a vanish reaction
#C (and one output is discarded), giving  -A, A&-B, -B.  The left two
#C signals can now cross each other since they're never both 1.  Next,
#C -A is copied and inverted, giving  A&-B, A, A, -B.  Another vanish
#C reaction gives  -A&-B  on the right, which can safely cross A,
#C yielding  A&-B, -A&-B, A.  The signal on the left is inverted and
#C crosses the middle signal in a vanish reaction, producing
#C -(A&-B) & -(-A&-B) = B.

#C In this demo, the inputs come from a p150 (2-on, 3-off) gun aimed
#C southeast p180 (3-on,3-off) gun aimed southwest.
