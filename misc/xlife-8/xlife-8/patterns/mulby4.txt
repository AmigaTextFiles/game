This is a period quadrupler reaction, with a glider gun to demonstrate it.
It accepts input gliders arriving at any multiple of 30 generations which
is 60 or larger, and emits one glider for every four input gliders.
Multiple copies can be stacked together to form a glider gun with an
arbitrarily large period.
