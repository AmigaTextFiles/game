Smallest known period 120 lightweight spaceship gun.  Deleting the p8
oscillator ("blocker", discovered by Robert T. Wainwright) produces the
smallest known period 60 LWSS gun.  Deleting the blocker and the p4
oscillator ("middleweight emulator", discoverer unknown) produces the
smallest known p30 LWSS gun, using a LWSS synthesis found by David
Buckingham.
