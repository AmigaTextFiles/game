#C p460 glider gun based on a reaction found by Buckingham which converts
#C 2 gliders to 3 gliders with the help of 3 blocks, a snake, a ship, and
#C an eater.  One glider escapes; the others are reflected by p46 shuttles
#C to repeat the reaction.  Given a period P oscillator which can reflect
#C a glider 90 degrees, we can build a gun whose period is any multiple
#C of P that's >= 452.
