#C "Star Gate", a p60 device which allows lightweight spaceships to
#C jump in Life space at the superluminous speed of 15/14 = 1.071 c.
#C Specifically, LWSSs entering from the left jump by 30 cells along
#C their path in 28 generations. The Star Gate implements two copies
#C of a reaction in which crashing gliders create a Fast Forward
#C Force Field which allows LWSSs to travel by way of a tunnel effect.
