This pattern was designed to test speed of 8 bit version of XLife program at the 126x108 grid with the maximum slowness factor.  This gives the worst speed possible for XLife for such size of the grid.  The pattern should be placed at the coordinates (1,1) to get the same results.  The next table shows speed in the generations per second for the different screen modes (pc means pseudocolor mode).

The Commodore +4 has the 6502 CPU running at 0.89-1.7 MHz without wait states.  The average frequency of this CPU with the standard screen mode is about 1.11 MHz (PAL) or 1.01 MHz (NTSC).
The Amstrad CPC 6128 has the z80 CPU running at 4 MHz.  Wait states make the actual frequency close to 3.19 MHz.
The Elektronika BK0011 has the K1801VM1 (the PDP-11 architecture) 16-bit CPU running at 4 MHz.  RAM access wait states eat about 40% of the CPU power.  So the actual frequency is close to 2.4 MHz.
These results demonstrate that the +4's CPU in the standard screen mode at 1.11 MHz is slower than the CPC's at 3.19 MHz but +4's video is faster.  The BK0011 demonstrates the fast 16-bit video but its CPU is slow to work with 8-bit data.  BK0011 may show the best results at 160x192 mode with the very big patterns.
The final 6502:z80 speed ratio with equal frequencies and no wait states is close to 2.4 to 1.
The results for the K1801VM1:z80 speed ratio is close to 1 to 1.
The first IBM PC used the 8088 CPU at 4.77 MHz.  The results show that it is not too fast.  It is only about 50% faster than z80 and about 2 times slower than 6502 at the same frequency.
The Commodore Amiga 500 uses the 68000 CPU at 7.09 MHz (PAL) or 7.16 MHz (NTSC).  The results show that the 68000 is approximately 1.2 faster than the 8088 at the same frequency.  The 80286:68020 speed ratio is shown equal approximately to 2.9 - it is surprising that the 68020 was so slow.  The 68020 is so slow because the stock A1200 doesn't have fast RAM.  If the A1200 uses fast RAM it becomes about 95% faster making the 80286:68020 speed ratio close to 1.5 - it is not much surprising.
All results have been gotten from emulators (plus4emu, ep128emu, BK2010, pce, pcem, fs-uae).
