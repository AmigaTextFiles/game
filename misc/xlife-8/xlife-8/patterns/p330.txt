Period 330 glider gun.
This demonstrates a reaction which allows the easy construction of a glider
gun of any period 90 + 120N.  A glider travels back and forth between a
queen bee and a pair of queen bees.  Each time it reaches the single queen
bee, it deletes a glider from a stream of gliders which is being turned
by the queen bee.  The output stream is inverted by an in-line inverter.
Moving the pair of queen bees to the upper left by 15 cells increases
the period by 120.
