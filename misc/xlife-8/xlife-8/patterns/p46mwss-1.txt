"shipgun" (cells 241 length 72 width 98 generation 0)
This is a middle-weight spaceship factory.  It is constructed by placing
three newguns (period 46) together such that the three gliders collide to
produce a middleweight spaceship every 46 turns.  The cursor is positioned
near the gliders which are about to collide, and a previously built spaceship
is to the right.  The smaller period 30 glider guns cannot be used in place
of the period 46 guns since there is not enough space for the spaceship to
escape before the next gliders appear.
