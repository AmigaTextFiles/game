Period 15 c/3 spaceship with its engine at one side.
This spaceship allows maximum access to the engine's output by a glider
coming from one side.  In particular, a backwards travelling glider can
be perturbed by the exhaust so as to become a boat.  Besides deletion of
the glider, this is the only reaction known for backwards gliders using
c/3 spaceships.
