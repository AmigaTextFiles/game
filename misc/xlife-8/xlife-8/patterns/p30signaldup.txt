A small period 30 glider duplicating device.
This is based on a signal duplicating reaction involving two gliders
and a block that was found by Dieter Leithner.  Here the reaction is
combined with a glider gun and an in-line inverter.  The glider coming
in from the upper left is duplicated, and copies emerge from the lower
left and the lower right.
