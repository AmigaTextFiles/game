#C p30 In-line Heisenburp Device
#C The device detects gliders in a p30 stream without affecting their
#C path or timing. The input stream comes from the NW and enters into
#C the device at the upper left. For each input glider passing through
#C the device an additional glider is injected into the glider stream
#C 16 generations behind the input glider. The output stream emerges
#C in SEward direction at lower right.
