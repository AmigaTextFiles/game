This is a "pure" Heisenburp reaction, in which a glider can be duplicated
without affecting the glider's path or timing.  Unlike previous Heisenburp
reactions, the glider is not even temporarily perturbed.  It always has at
least one row of OFF cells around it.

This reaction can only be repeated at period 90 or larger.
