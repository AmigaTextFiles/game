Period 376 four-barrelled MWSS gun.
This uses a reaction discovered by David Buckingham in which an R-pentomino
descendent is hit by a glider to create another R-pentomino descendent turned
90 degrees from the original one, a glider, and a MWSS.  Incoming gliders
which keep the reaction going in a loop are provided by four period 376
glider guns based on pseudo-period 94 glider guns.
