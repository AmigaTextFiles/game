Block pusher 5
Population is bounded, but some cells never become periodic.
A 3 glider salvo pushes a block 10 units southeast and sends back
2 gliders, which cause another salvo to be fired.  The round trip
time increases by an average of 80 generations each time.  More
specifically, for n>=0, a salvo hits the block in generation
40 n^2 + 760 n + a[n mod 3],  where a[0]=426, and a[1]=a[2]=626.
