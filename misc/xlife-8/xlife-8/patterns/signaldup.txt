This demonstrates a remarkably simple signal duplicator reaction.
Its basic principle is two gliders and a block which react.
If the glider carrying the signal isn't present, the other glider
continues unchanged.  If the signal glider is present, it deletes
the second glider, and also creates a new glider traveling in the
same direction as the signal glider.  So the signal has been duplicated.
Here the reaction is shown with a glider gun whose output is affected.
