This program was developed under Linux using VASM assembler.

The script `makell' makes all files required for Xlife-8-Amiga package.  It
uses VASM and several utilities (awk, gcc, rm).

The main program directory, named `Xlife-8', must be located in the root
directory of any drive or the XLF device!  A directory with patterns must be a
subdirectory of the main program directory!  It is allowed to have several
directories with patterns on different drives.  The main program can only use
devices DF0 - DF3, DH0 - DH3, RAM, RAD, and XLF.

Xlife-8 programs (`xlife' and `manpage') may be run from CLI or Workbench.
