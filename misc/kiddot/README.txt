 KidDOT is the traditional children's game of dots.  Rules are  contained
 in the program and options are obvious.  It is designed for two players,
 both using the mouse, or one mouse and one joystick, and particularly
 for parents to play with young children.  Your gaming behavior, attitude
 and responses can only be conveyed to your kids by example - the one
 thing that is missing in any interactive game in which the opponent is
 only the computer.  Have fun!  Join The Ready Robot Club TODAY...
