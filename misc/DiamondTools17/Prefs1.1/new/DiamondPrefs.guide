@NODE 5. "The main window"

 The main window of DiamondPrefs is seperated into two parts:

 @{" configuring the Game " Link 5.1.}

 @{" configuring the Editor " Link 5.2.}

 At the bottom are two buttons

 Save will save your settings to disk
 ~~~~
 Exit will close the window and leave the preferencesfile unchanged
 ~~~~

@ENDNODE

@NODE 5.1. "configuring the Game"

 Note: If there is a preferencesfile in your DC: drawer, it will
 automatically be loaded and all tooltype settings will be overridden!

 ScreenMode

  You may choose two different screenmodes, one for the titlescreen and one
  for the game. All screenmodes are supported that are capable of
  displaying at least 16 colors (depth 4).

  Note that both the title and the game were designed to be used on a
  screen with a 1:1 pixel-ratio like LoRes or HiRes-Interlace.

  The Interlace-button is normally set according to the gae screenmode you
  select. If you have any problems, for example with DBL-screenmodes, try
  disabling this button.

 Controlmethod

  Here you specify the controlmethod of both players. You have the coice
  betweeen Joystick in port 1, Joystick in port 2 and Keyboard.

  Note that there should be only one player using the keyboard.
  Two player using keyboard will be possible in future versions.

 Presets

  Leveldirectory lets you select a default-directory that will be present
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ at startup-time.
  Number of players should be obvious
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Name is the default-name you want to use.
  ~~~~

  gameport.device : Choose if you want to use the gameport.device or bang
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ the Joystick hardware directly.

  The next item alows you to place the status line in the game (where your
  score gets displayed) above or below the game screen.

  Note that if you use an interlaced screenmode in the game, you should
  place the statusline above the gamescreen.

  Speed : This slider controls the time (in 1/2500 seconds) the game has
  ~~~~~ got to do its calculations. The normal value is 50 which leaves
  1/50 sec for every frame. 1 is very fast (although most of the time, the
  calculations will take longer than 0.0004 seconds), 200 is about 4 times
  slower than normal. This value is not affected by the screenmode you're
  using.

  The button to the right will reset the Speed to the default value of 50.

  Gfxfile : Specify the graphics you want to use in the game. Use
  ~~~~~~~ DiamondGfx to create your own gfx-file or use the default
  graphics in "Diamond.16col" (normal 16 color version) or "Diamond.32col"
  (extended 32 color version).

@ENDNODE

@NODE 5.2. "configuring the Editor"

 Here you can select the screenmode of the PublicScreen, every screenmode
 capable of displaying at least 16 colors is supported.

 Note that the minimum size of the screen is 640x400.

 Presets

  Leveldirectory lets you select a default-directory that will be present
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ at startup-time.
  Nr. is the initial levelnumber
  ~~~
  You can also select that you want to load the level (specified by number
  and directory) at the beginning.
