 If you want to draw your own graphics, please read @{"Creating own graphics" Link 5.1.}.

@ENDNODE

@NODE 5.1. "Creating own graphics"

 Creating own graphics for Diamond Caves is not very difficult, all you
 need is a paint program and these guidelines:

 - every picture must be 320x256 pixels in dimensions

 - the file "Score.br" must be 320x14 pixels in dimensions

 - every picture must be of the same depth.
 Diamond Caves supports depth from 1 (2 colors) up to 8 (256 colors - AGA).

 - the depth and colors used in the game are taken from the file
 "Earth.br", so make sure at least this file has the right colors

 - the brush "Score.br" uses the same colors as every other picture

 - the numbers (0,1,2,...) in the file "Earth.br" must be 14 pixels high
 with one blank line above and below them. This is because they are used
 in the "Score.br" picture to display Score, Time and Emeralds.

 - don't save the pictures with some kind of mask (stencil).

 - remember that some items (Boulders, Emeralds, ...) are present in many
 files and not only in their own.
