 developer of the software can NOT be held responsible.

@ENDNODE

@NODE 4.4. "SHAREWARE"

 program.

 If you are still working with an unregistered version of Diamond Caves,
 read the chapter "How to register" in the Diamond Caves docfile.

@ENDNODE

@NODE 5. "The main window"

 At the top of the window there is a cycle-gadget where you can select the
 sample you want to edit. The following part is the same for every sample.

  Filename contains name and path of your sample. Important: The final
  ~~~~~~~~ sfx-file only contains these filenames and not the samples
  itself!

  Samplingrate is the frequency you want to play the sample with (in 10Hz).
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Volume should be ovious: The Volume :-) 0 is silence.
  ~~~~~~
  Play Sample loads the sample with the given name and plays it once
  ~~~~~~~~~~~

 Save will store your settings into the file "DC:sfx/sfx.data" where they
 ~~~~ will be found by the Diamond Caves Game. Remember: This file only
 contains the path and filename of every sample and not the sample itself!

 Default resets every value to the default settings. If you want to us
 ~~~~~~~ this, please make sure that the default samples (The files
 "DC:sfx/y#?") are present.

 Exit will leave the program.
 ~~~~

 If you want to use your own samples, please read @{"Using own samples" Link 5.1.}.

@ENDNODE

@NODE 5.1. "Using own samples"

 Using own samples within Diamond Caves is not very difficult, just follow
 these guidelines:

 - don't use "long" samples. With normal gamespeed, every sample has about
 8/50 seconds (0.16 sec) to play. Only the Exposion needs about twice the
 time.

 - check out the cycle-gadget: This is the exact order in which the samples
 are played, beginning with the timeout (= highes priority)

 - Adjust the volume of each sample so that they all "fit together".

 - make sure, the samples are always present on your harddisk because the
 sfx-file only contains the filename but not the sample itself.
