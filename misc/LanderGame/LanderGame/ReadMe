   Welcome to Lander 3DX, the X-Specs 3D Lunar Lander Game.  You must attach
the X-Specs 3D glasses to joystick connector #2 to play the game (naturally).

   Note that this disk also contains two additional 3D fractal scenery
files for use with Lander3DX.  These files are named "LanderSceneTwo"
and "LanderSceneThree" and are contained in the "Scenery" drawer.  If you
would like to try a different lunar scene from the one that comes with the
game, just return to the "Information" screen within the game and type "S".
Then type the desired file name as requested ("Scenery/LanderSceneTwo or
"Scenery/LanderSceneThree").


   Comments, questions, suggestions welcome.
