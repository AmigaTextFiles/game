			 [C] 1994 by Peter J Binkley

NOTE:  AMOS.library (included) is needed to run this program.  It must be in 
the system libs directory.  


HOW TO PLAY:  Press any key to get past the title screen, then use the mouse
to pick your paddle.  Enter your name, and you will be presented with the
Opponent Selection screen.  At the top is your current score.  Select an
opponent by using the joystick (in port #2) to move up and down the list, and 
press the button to play that opponent.  (The opponents get tougher the farther 
down the list you go.  For example, Archimedes and Copernicus are fairly easy, 
but Augustine and Newton are nearly impossible to beat.)

Once you've picked your opponent, you'll go directly to the Game screen.  
Anyone who has ever played the original "Pong" or any of its subsequent
incarnations will know what to do from here.  If you hit the ball while you
are moving, the ball angle will change slightly.  The moving bumper is just
to add some variety to the game.  (Note:  If your paddle is moving too
quickly, hold down the joystick button -- this will slow it down a bit.)

The game goes to 10, then you go back to the Opponent Selection screen.  Your
score is determined as follows:  The easier opponent you play, the fewer points
you get for winning and the more points you lose for losing.  Conversely, the
tougher opponents will yield more points for a win and fewer points lost for
a loss.  The number of goals you score are also taken into account in a 
similar manner.  The computer keeps track of how many points you score and
what your record is against each opponent.  During the game, 'P' pauses the
action and on the Opponent Selection screen, 'Q' will quit the program.  

NOTES ON THE PRE-RELEASE:  This program is a pre-release of a more ambitious
project I'm working on.  Right now I don't have time to finish the final
version, so I'm releasing what I have to see what kind of response I get.
If you enjoy this program, I urge you to send me e-mail (if you have 
internet access) and tell me so I will know if anyone wants me to finish the 
final game.  

PLANS FOR THE FINAL RELEASE:  The final game will live up to the name of
"Pong Tourney."  It will consist of a campaign of Pong tournaments, with
ranked players -- similar to professional tennis.  Each player on the circuit
will have individual attributes like names, paddle speeds, ages, colors, etc.
I also hope to clean up the interface some and make the whole thing a bit
prettier.  Again, this version will be produced much earlier if I have some
encouragement.  If you have internet access, send me mail at:

			shakes@mentor.cc.purdue.edu

LEGAL STUFF:  This pre-release is Freeware.  I don't expect any money for
the use of this program, and it may be distributed anywhere and everywhere
as long as this documentation is kept with the archive.  
This program was written using AMOS Professional.  AMOS is the property of
EuroPress Software Ltd.
