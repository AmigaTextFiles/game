This is a WarpOS port of the latest 0.8.0 version of Ur-Quan Masters which
itself is an open source port of StarControl II. It is really intended for
the faster G3/G4 accelerators for classic Amiga but it might work for the
603/604 accelerators.

This game needs an assign called SC2: to its working directory. The script
provided should do this correctly.

Tested on an Amiga 3000 with Voodoo3 and a PCI card with a 450MHz G4 card.
There is a lot of loading of small files going on, so a fast HD(-interface)
is highly recommended. Also seems to work on MorphOS.

For sources and the various content/addon packages, go to sc2.sourceforge.net.

Netplay has not been compiled in, in this WOS version.
