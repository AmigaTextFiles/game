________________________________________________________________________

About This Guide

This Pilot's Guide will cover the operation of the Air  Warrior  software
and features  of  the  game.    It  is  generally  a copy of various text
sections of the printed Air Warrior  User's Manual ver 2.3 available  for
order in the  KESMAI  order page (m130).  Other printed support materials
such as detailed terrain maps are available for order as well.

All flight controls and features of the  Host game  and  technical  setup
issues are covered in detail for each specific version of Air Warrior.

An individualized copy of this Guidebook is included in every starter kit
along with  the software files.      Reviewing    these  instructions  is
quite an important orientation.

The  details  of  flight  technique  and  Air  Combat   tactics cannot be
properly covered in a text guide alone.  To support the training  of  new
players  to Air Warrior, we have developed an additional printed Training
Guidebook,  demonstration films and a live training Academy organization.

- About Air Warrior -

Air  Warrior   is   a  multi-player   air    combat   simulation.   Using
sophisticated  software  techniques,  Air  Warrior  combines  the  visual
realism and detailed graphics of a video game with the  live  action  and
dramatic content of  an online multi-player game.

Players in Air Warrior fly WW  II  vintage  fighters  in  live  dogfights
against members  of  any  of  three  nationalities.   In addition, ground
vehicles such as tanks and jeeps can be commanded. Heavy bomber  aircraft
can be commanded and  staffed  by    up    to   seven  live  crew members.
Paratroop aircraft and dive bombers are also simulated.

There are both European style terrains and Pacific terrains with Aircraft
Carriers,   rivers,  and  bridges.  A  north  Africa  terrain is planned.
Airfields have automated ack-ack guns, radar towers  ,  fuel  farms,  and
repair hangers  as  targets.    Strategic  targets  such  as  refineries,
aircraft factories and supplies factories  are  located  outside  capitol
cities.   Automated  resupply  convoys  of  trucks and C-47's roll when a
target is bombed.    Interception  of  these convoys can  cause temporary
deprivations of fuel, aircraft and repairs to opposing countries.
 
Various aircraft are closely  modeled   to    match    the  theater    of
operation  in   use.  There  are  American,  British,  German, Soviet  and
Japanese aircraft modeled individually in Air Warrior.

Air Warrior has a  WW I  theater  as  well  as  Korean  War  vintage  Jet
aircraft and the ME-262 jet.

There  are  live conference rooms as  well as ready  rooms in Air Warrior.
There are  both  radio  channels  and    private  intercom  channels  for
communications.

Players  can  fly  as   members  of   organized   squadrons   or   alone.
Periodically, special  weekend  campaigns   are   organized  to  recreate
historic events.

There is a  dueling  mode  as  well  as  a  special  practice  area  with
organized training sessions.

There is a gun camera feature  which  allows  complete  recreation  of  a
flight  including  radio traffic. There is a chase plane perspective with
view angles and magnification user selectable.  Films can be played  back
on any machine. A film editor has just been released.

Players take an active role in influencing the course of  game  evolution
and features.

Air Warrior is the only flight simulation of  it's  kind  in  the  public
marketplace.

- The Software -

Air Warrior  ,  for  each player,  can    be  considered    a    PAIR  of
programs  that  work together.    The   'HOST'   program runs remotely on
a GEnie   service    computer.  The  HOST  program   handles    all   the
multi-player interactions as   well  as dogfight scoring and game  record
keeping.

You run a local  Air  Warrior  program  on  your  home  computer.    That
'front-end' program  handles   all  the    flight    simulation math, the
screen   animation, sound effects,  and pilot  control  inputs.

The two programs  work  together  when you  sign  onto  GEnie.   Use  the
terminal portion  of  Air  Warrior  and  enter  the  game through the Air
Warrior menu.

-The Starter Kit-

The starter kit is a complete set of Air  Warrior  software  and  support
files in compressed  format.  The kit, for new players,  is available for
direct download  from  the  [*] FREE Instructions  menu  (m871).      The
KIT  will  contain  all  software needed to run Air Warrior plus demo art
files, sound where applicable, and  a  flight   FILM    demonstration.  A
copy  of  the Pilot's Guide text for each computer will be present in the
KIT. Each type  of supported home computer is represented individually.


- The Air Warrior menus-

The  GEnie menus used  in Air Warrior will be listed completely later  in
this manual.   They  may  be  reached by via previous menu selections  or
through  direct  move  commands   which  will  also  be  listed for handy
reference.

-The Air Warrior Libraries-

The  libraries  contain  all  software  from  the  starter  kits   stored
individually for manual download. Copies of the compression utilities are
installed there.  In addition, there are many extras  for  each  type  of
home system.  These include art    files    for    many   aircraft, sound
files,  player designed  maps,  films   of    mission    adventures,  and
documents and instructions for  more  advanced  activities  like  running
special events.  The libraries will be discussed later in this Guide.

-The Air Warrior Bulletin Board-

Great debates rage in the Air Warrior topics  of  the  MP-Games  bulletin
board.   This  area  is  GEnie*Basic  and  provides the vibrant forum for
interactions between all Air Warrior players.    Your  questions  can  be
answered  here  and  special  events are announced and organized in these
topic areas.  Frequently players lobby KESMAI  for  feature  changes  and
report bugs / problems they may encounter.
 
Individual  squadrons have private posting  categories reserved for their
members.
 
Several Kesmai representatives read the full set of postings daily.  See
further details in the MP_Games round table area m1045.

Flight Commands
The microprocessor program starts up in practice mode.  In this mode  the
Control, Planes and Options menus are enabled.  You can practice flying a
plane by selecting the one you want from the  Planes  menu.    Everything
works  in  practice  mode  except  the  guns and bombs, however, they are
unnecessary since there is nothing to shoot at.    You  can  select  your
starting airfield  from the Options menu.  The practice mode is primarily
designed for you to learn to fly the plane well and hopefully to land  it
safely.   Once  you have the hang of flying, its time to get on GEnie and
test your mettle against other pilots.

Practice is the most important thing you can do to learn to fly and fight
well.  Use the Practice Mode of the program to master landing, as getting
a landing or ditch is vastly superior to bailing out at the  end  of  the
mission.   Aerobatic  skills can also come in handy in eluding a plane on
your tail, or making a fancy maneuver to get on someone else's.  Learn to
fly using the "expert mode" rather than relying on the autopilot.

_________________________________________________________________________

The Display
The graphical display on the computer screen contains all the information
you need  to fly your plane.  The largest part of the display is taken up
by the graphical picture, which shows what you can see from  your  plane.
You  will  see  runways,  roads,  buildings,  mountains, other planes and
sometimes guns or vehicles on the ground.  Part of the  picture  will  be
obscured  by your own plane, which may be represented by a silhouette, or
may be drawn in detail depending on the plane and the version  you  have.
If  you  do see another plane or ground target which is within 5000 yards
(less for some small targets), the program will textually display the  id
number  or plane type of the target, the range to the target in yards and
a small unique icon used to identify the target.  This  small  icon  will
also appear below the picture, directly below the corresponding target.

The different icons can be used to  distinguish  small  images  of  other
planes  on  the  screen,  compensating for the small size of the computer
screen.  The country of the indicated  aircraft  is  represented  by  the
shape  of  the  icon on the Macintosh and by the color of the icon on the
IBM PC, the Amiga and the Atari ST.

Below the picture on the screen is a  representation  of  the  aircraft's
instrument panel.    The  major  instruments  are  the  altimeter,  rate-
of-climb gauge, accelerometer, compass, fuel, oil  and  ammo  indicators,
and the   airspeed   indicator.      The  altimeter  has  three  needles,
representing tens, hundreds and thousands of feet and a small  knob  that
travels  around  the  inside  rim of the gauge to show tens of thousands.
The following description applies to the  standard  Macintosh  instrument
panel arrangement.    IBM  PC,  Amiga  and Atari ST control panels differ
slightly and it is possible to customize the arrangement for each  plane,
in some cases radically altering the appearance.

The digital compass reads in degrees, with zero as north and  ninety  due
east.  Fuel,  oil  and  ammo  indicate in percentages.  The accelerometer
measures how much force the airframe is being subjected to by the current
maneuver.   In  straight  and  level flight the accelerometer will read 1
"g", meaning the wings are exactly supporting the weight  of  the  plane.
If  the  plane  executes a level or climbing turn, the wings will have to
provide more lift and the accelerometer is used to monitor how much  more
is being produced.

The velocity gauge displays airspeed, usually in knots or nautical  miles
per hour.1   By  default,  the  gauge  indicates true airspeed (TAS).  By
selecting  the  appropriate  option  from  the  Options  menu,  Indicated
Airspeed (IAS)  can be displayed instead.  Indicated airspeed is what the
pilot of a real aircraft generally sees; it is measured by  sampling  the
air pressure  outside  the  plane with a Pitot tube.  IAS will go down as
the the plane climbs to higher altitude, due to decreasing  air  density.
A plane that does 300 knots at sea level (where IAS and TAS are the same)
may only do 250 knots IAS at 20,000 feet, whereas it's TAS  may  have  in
fact increased   substantially   with  altitude.    IAS  is  an  accurate
indication of how close the plane is to stalling and how close it  is  to
exceeding one of its maximum safe speeds, because IAS is a direct measure
of the force being exerted on the plane by the air.

Other indicators on the control panel are  aircraft  control  indicators.
The  large  box  in  the  center of the panel is the "stick box" or stick
position indicator.  Below it  is  the  rudder  position  indicator  (The
rudder on an IBM PC, Amiga or Atari ST is located inside the stick box at
its top.)  The throttle indicator shows  the  current  throttle  setting.
Small  icons indicate whether the landing gear are up, down, or in motion
and the position of the flaps.   A  stall  indicator  shows  whether  the
airflow over  the wings is stalled or not.  If this light comes on during
flight, a audible stall horn will sound also.

_________________________________________________________________________

Mouse Controls
The basic controls of the plane are on the  mouse.    Pushing  the  mouse
forward and  backward  lowers  and raises the nose, respectively.  Moving
the mouse from side to side will bank  the  plane,  turning  it  in  that
direction.  The  IBM  PC  version supports an standard analog stick.  The
Amiga version also supports an analog joystick and the Macintosh  version
has  an  option  to configure the program for use with a joystick such as
the CH Flight Stick.

There are two basic modes of mouse control, expert   mode  and  autopilot
mode.  Expert    mode is designed to give realistic responses to mouse or
joystick motions, whereas autopilot mode is designed to provide a  simple
and stable  control  system  at  the  cost of some realism.  In autopilot
mode, the mouse controls the actual position of the plane rather than the
positions of  its  control surfaces.  Moving the mouse to the right banks
the plane to the right, the farther to the right it goes the steeper  the
bank.   When it reaches the desired course, move the mouse back to center
to straighten the plane out.  Unlike the expert mode, the  mouse  motions
here  bear  little  resemblance  to  the actual motions of the stick in a
plane, but they are easy to understand and easy to fly with.  The variety
of  maneuvers  the plane can perform in this mode is basically limited to
level flight, climbs, dives and  turns.    Autopilot  mode  can  only  be
engaged when  the  plane is in basically stable flight.  Loops, rolls and
more complex maneuvers require the  use  of  expert  mode.    We  do  not
recommend using  the  autopilot    mode  in  combat,  due  to the serious
limitations it imposes on aircraft tactics and maneuver.

In expert  mode, a mouse motion to the right causes the plane to bank  to
the  right, the more the mouse is moved the faster the plane rolls to the
right.  If you move the mouse to the right and keep it there,  the  plane
will execute a full roll and keep rolling till you move the mouse back to
center.  Likewise pulling the mouse back and keeping it  there  will  put
the plane  through a full vertical loop.  To execute a controlled turn to
the right, you would move the mouse to the right  causing  the  plane  to
roll to  the right.  Once it reaches an acceptable angle of bank, such as
45deg. or so, move the mouse back to center to stop the roll.    A  plane
can make a slow shallow turn merely by being banked in this manner.

If it attempts to make a steep bank, it will side slip, that is  slip  in
towards the  center  of  the  turn and lose altitude.  In order to make a
fast turn, a large force is needed to bend the flight path of  the  plane
into a  curve.    This force is provided by increasing the angle at which
the airflow is striking the wings (known as the angle of attack), causing
them to  generate  additional  lift.    Thus,  to make a fast turn in Air
Warrior without losing altitude, you pull back on the stick (mouse)  just
the  amount needed to balance the force of gravity pulling the plane down
with the lift of the wings pulling the plane up along the angle at  which
the plane is banked.

A  glance  at  the accelerometer and rate-of-climb gauges can help you to
judge the force required.  Air Warrior always performs what is known as a
coordinated  turn,  meaning  that  the program automatically provides the
rudder force necessary to compensate for the stick deflection  you  make,
so that  the  plane  remains  properly aligned with the flight path.  The
rudder control in Air Warrior is used only for deflecting the plane  away
from this condition, such as to deliberately sideslip on landing.

On the IBM PC, Atari ST and Amiga (with appropriate option selected)  the
left  mouse  button activates a feature called roll lock, where the stick
is constrained to move only forward and backward  along  its  centerline,
making  it  easy  to  push  the  stick  forward  or  pull it back without
introducing an inadvertent roll.  This feature can be  quite  handy  when
executing a  hard  turn  or  a  loop.    Roll  lock is activated from the
keyboard on the Macintosh.

On the Macintosh, IBM PC and Amiga  (if  the  roll  lock  option  is  not
activated),  with the mouse button held down, moving the mouse forward or
backward will adjust the throttle up and down (note the throttle gauge on
the screen that tracks the motion of the mouse.)

The  throttle  on  the Atari ST (and the Macintosh and IBM PC in joystick
mode) is controlled by the keyboard.  You'll want to  use  full  throttle
for take off and steep climbs, with maybe 70% throttle for level cruising
and will usually shut the engine down to 40% or less for  a  descent  for
landing.

On The IBM PC and the Amiga, Air Warrior  supports  simultaneous  use  of
both the  analog  joystick  and  the  mouse.   In this mode, side to side
motion of the mouse control the rudder and forward and  backward  motions
control  the  throttle.  Double-clicking the mouse button will center the
stick.  This is extremely useful for trimming the plane to  fly  straight
in expert mode or leveling the plane out in autopilot  mode.

On  the IBM PC, Amiga and Atari ST, the right mouse button can be used to
fire the guns.

Keyboard Commands
There are a number of keyboard commands and key-mapped  controls.    They
fall  into  three  categories: those that are pressed once to initiate an
action (immediate controls), those that  are  in  flight  line-  oriented
commands  (command-line commands) and those that you hold down to perform
an action (hold-down  controls).  The following  keys  of  the  immediate
type are the ones used by the Macintosh version.  The Amiga  and Atari ST
versions uses some different keys on the keypad to achieve a more logical
arrangement  (since  these machines have a standard keypad), although the
Amiga version supports many of the Macintosh keys as well.   In  addition
the Macintosh version allows re-mapping of the immediate style keys.  See
Summary Charts below.

_________________________________________________________________________

Looking Around
The keyboard commands that control the direction of view are  hold-  down
style  commands  on the Macintosh and Amiga and immediate- style commands
on the Atari ST and IBM PC.  The Macintosh  allows  the  user  to  select
immediate-style view keys as an option (the Sticky Keys option).  The IBM
PC version also allows the user to select whether or not  to  use  sticky
views;  machines  with very early BIOS versions may work properly only in
immediate-style mode. On the Macintosh and Amiga, holding down the h  key
will cause  you  to look out over the left wing of the plane.  As long as
the key is held down, you'll look to the left.  The l key does  the  same
thing, to the right.  The m key is used to look directly behind you.  The
k key looks straight up and the j key looks straight down.The  g  key  is
used as a forward key, although you do not need to hold that key down, as
forward is the normal default view.  Holding down the h and m or l and  m
keys in combination will give you an over the shoulder and leaning to the
side view, which can be useful in a plane with a high fuselage behind the
pilot.

There are a number of combination views, accessed by  holding  more  than
one key  down at once.  On the Amiga, a series of keys on the keypad will
perform the same actions.  On the Atari ST,  pressing  the  desired  view
direction  key will change the display until another view key is pressed.
To use the combination views the keys are pressed in sequence instead  of
simultaneously.   All  the default view key definitions are summarized in
the table below.

on the Amiga.  PC's with non-"Hold Down" mode use the keypad + 
instead of 5.

_________________________________________________________________________

The Radar Screen
Air Warrior has what may loosely be called a "RADAR" mode built into each
plane.   This  is  not  radar  in  the usual sense and is not intended to
represent a realistic radar display.  It is instead intended  to  provide
the  pilot with a quick overview of the area around his plane, so that he
may most economically locate targets to attack or friends  to  aid.    It
compensates  to some extent for the small size of the computer screen and
the lack of depth perception and detail, which make it difficult to  know
whether the little dot on the horizon is worth chasing or not.

During World War II, very few fighters  were  equipped  with  radar,  but
fighters  were  often  guided  to  targets  by a steady stream of radioed
instructions.  This is what the Air Warrior radar mode simulates.   Radar
may not be available at all times or in all areas and usually if radar is
available it will be  centered  on  some  building  located  in  friendly
territory.

The Macintosh Radar Screen
Holding down the = key is used to request radar mode, to tell you whether
any enemy planes  are  nearby.    The map display, like the  illustration
below, shows several things.
 
Your plane is represented by a small +  in the  center  of  the  picture.
North is always to the top of the screen.  Gray lines represent map grids
(see the discussion of the Map).  Short horizontal or vertical lines show
the positions of the various runways.  Small x's represent nearby fighter
planes and small boxes bombers, within about 8 miles.

Any plane you can see out the window, either with or without a range  and
tracking  icon,  will  be  displayed  on  the  map,  with a tracking icon
enabling you to  identify  it.    In  addition  to  these  true  position
indicators,  each  map  sector within a radius of two sectors will have a
set of small icons along its sides telling  you  how  many  friendly  and
enemy planes  are within the sector.  Up the left side, small black boxes
represent enemy planes.  Up the right side of the sector, small  diamonds
represent friendly  planes.    Note  that these counters are only updated
every 45 seconds or so, whereas the true position indicators are  updated
continuously.

The Amiga Radar Screen
Holding down the Enter key on the keypad on the Amiga is used to  request
radar mode.   The Amiga radar mode is similar to the Macintosh.  The same
information is presented but the format  is  slightly  different.    Your
plane  is  indicated  by  a  white  dash  which is always centered on the
display.  Nearby aircraft are indicated by either  dashes  (fighters)  or
t-shapes (bombers).    The dashes and t- shapes are appropriately colored
for the allegiance of the aircraft they represent.  Grid lines, airfields
and  tracking  icons  are  essentially  equivalent  in  nature  to  those
available on the Macintosh.

The information which is indicated by the black boxes and diamonds on the
Macintosh  is  represented  on the Amiga with colored boxes occupying the
upper portion of the grid box.  Enemy aircraft are represented with light
green boxes, friendly aircraft with dark green.

The IBM PC Radar Screen
Pressing the F1 key  on the IBM PC is used to request radar  mode.    The
IBM  PC  radar  mode is similar to the Macintosh; the same information is
presented but the format is slightly different.  Your plane is  indicated
by a white dash which is always centered on the display.  Nearby aircraft
are indicated by either dashes (fighters) or  t-shapes  (bombers).    The
dashes  and  t-shapes are appropriately colored for the allegiance of the
aircraft they represent.  Grid lines, airfields and  tracking  icons  are
essentially  equivalent  in  nature  to those available on the Macintosh.
The information on the Macintosh which is indicated by  the  black  boxes
and  diamonds  on the Macintosh is represented on the IBM PC with colored
boxes occupying the upper portion of the grid box.   Enemy  aircraft  are
represented  with  light  green boxes, friendly aircraft with dark green.
In CGA mode the colors all will be different, but the format is the same.

The Atari Radar Screen
Pressing the F2 key on the Atari  ST  is  used  to  request    the  radar
display. .The  display  format  is similar to the Macintosh.  Small plane
shapes depict fighters and larger ones represent bombers.   The  relative
position of  your plane is indicated with an X.  Small black boxes at the
top of each sector represent the number of enemy planes  (all  types)  in
that sector  diamond  shapes  are friends.  Press the F1 key to return to
normal viewing.

_________________________________________________________________________

In Flight Command Line
The line oriented keyboard commands are used primarily  for  things  that
require communicating  to  GEnie,  such  as talking to another plane.  To
enter one of these commands, hit the  <esc>  key  (or  the  `  key  on  a
Macintosh that  does  not  have an <esc> key.)  A > prompt will appear on
your screen and anything you type will be echoed back next to the prompt.
All  of  the line oriented commands should be entered just by their first
character.  These commands are terminated with  a  <Return>  and  can  be
canceled by entering a <Control> X ( -X on the Macintosh).

_________________________________________________________________________

In Memory View Cache
All versions of Air Warrior support the use of customized art  files  for
each plane.    Using  these  files,  the  image of your own plane will be
rendered in detail rather than as a gray or black  polygon.    These  art
views  can  take quite a bit of time to load from disk and image, slowing
down the process of looking around for enemy planes.   For  this  reason,
all  the  versions  support  the  ability to keep a number of pictures in
memory.  If you select a cache size of 5, for instance, the last 5  views
you have  used  will  be retained in memory.  If you use them again, they
will be redrawn rapidly.
 
If you only  have  the   minimum  memory  required  to  run  Air  Warrior
(generally 512K),  you will only be able to use 1 or 2 cache entries.  In
a megabyte there will be plenty of room for more views.   On  the  Amiga,
the higher the screen resolution, the more memory the cache will take per
view.  This means you  will  be  able  to  afford  fewer  cache  entries.
Likewise,  on  a  Macintosh  II,  larger  views or more colors use memory
rapidly.

_________________________________________________________________________

The Flight Recorder
Air Warrior has a flight recorder built in enabling you  to  record  your
flights  both  online and offline and play back both your own flights and
those of other players that have been uploaded  to  GEnie.    The  camera
operates in a similar fashion on all the different microcomputers and the
film files  produced  are  compatible  between  the  different  machines,
regardless of which computer made the film.

The Camera menu is used to set up and control the operation of the flight
recorder.  There are several options that can be selected from this menu,
that you should check on before you start your flight.  The Set Film Size
option tells Air Warrior how much disk space (or memory) can  be  devoted
to the film being recorded.  The film will generally need between 500 and
1000 bytes per minute.  On the Macintosh, a menu  option  allows  you  to
select recording to either disk or memory.  Recording to disk is slightly
less efficient than recording to memory, but usually more disk  space  is
readily available.

On the IBM PC, Amiga and Atari ST, there is  an  option  to  specify  the
location  of  the  temporary  film file, that is always recorded to disk.
Setting this entry to a file on a RAM disk is an excellent way to improve
performance.

Playback  of  a  film  on  disk  (or  the  current  film in memory on the
Macintosh) is initiated with the Play menu option.  The  Save  option  is
used to  save  a film just recorded to a permanent disk file.  Be sure to
save any film you want to keep before starting your  next  one!  When  in
flight,  recording  is  initiated by pressing the 9 key on the Macintosh,
Amiga, IBM PC or the F9 function key on the Atari ST.  Recording  can  be
suspended and resumed by hitting the key again as many times as you want.

During playback all the usual view keys  are  active,  so  you  can  look
around  you  and  perhaps  see  things  you missed in the heat of battle.
During camera playback only, an additional set  of  views  is  available,
from outside  the  cockpit  looking  back at your plane.  To access these
views, press the n key and then hold  whichever  view  key  you  want  as
normal.   The  view  will shift to looking at your plane from that angle.
The zoom in and out keys ([ and ]) can be used  to  adjust  the  distance
between the view point and your plane.  The n key can be touched again to
move the viewpoint back into the cockpit.

Multi-Player Operation (Online)
The following sections discuss getting online  and  the  conference  room
capabilities of the game.

Logging Into GEnie
To put the program in Terminal Mode, select Choose Terminal  Mode  option
under the  Control  menu.  The Setup menu now becomes enabled, so you can
set your baud rate and other communications parameters correctly.  If you
need  to select your communications port, you should do this first before
choosing Terminal Mode.  You can either use another program to dial  into
GEnie first, or use the Dial command in Air Warrior.  Before you dial you
should enter the correct dial  command  for  your  modem  with  Set  Dial
Command option.

The communications parameters and dial string will be  saved  in  a  file
called config or config.air.  It is safe to delete the config file before
running the program; if the file is not present, the program will default
all the  communications settings to reasonable values.  If you are having
trouble getting Air Warrior to dial, a good first step is to  remove  the
config file  and  reset all the settings again.  This often clears up the
problem.

It's important to be in the Air Warrior program in Terminal Mode,  before
selecting the  GEnie  menu  option  to  Enter Air Warrior.  The actions a
normal terminal can perform in Air  Warrior  are  limited.    GEnie  will
figure  it  out  eventually if you switch to the Air Warrior front end in
mid-run, but the process may be confusing both to  you  and  the  system.
(Note:  if  you  are  using an Apple modem on a Macintosh, you may not be
able to change programs in mid-stream, as the  modem  will  hang  up  the
phone when you exit the first program to go back to the desk top.  You'll
need to dial GEnie with Air Warrior in this case.)  Once  online  running
the  Air  Warrior program, type AIR or m870 to go to the Air Warrior menu
area.

The second entry on the main menu, Enter Air Warrior, moves you into  the
Air Warrior  conference  area.  When you enter the Air Warrior program on
GEnie, the Planes and Commands menus will be enabled.  The Commands  menu
provides  a convenient way to perform common operations without having to
remember commands.  The Planes menu is used to select a  plane  once  you
reach your airfield.

The fourth and sixth menu entries  will  move  you  to  the  Air  Warrior
Training area  and  Air  Warrior  Scenarios  Arena,  respectively.    The
Scenarios arena is where  special  events  are  staged;  generally  every
weekend  a  special  battle  is  run, recreating an interesting moment in
history (or someone's imagination!).  The Scenarios are organized and run
by  players  who  volunteer  for  the  honor of staging their own battle.
Check the  Schedule entry on the Scenarios page for what's  going  on  in
the near future.

In the Training arena, no score counts towards the main game, so you  can
kill or  be killed with no risk.  When you are shot down, your plane will
not actually crash or explode, but both  you  and  your  killer  will  be
informed of  the "kill".  You may change countries freely in the Training
area and your permanent alliance in the main game will not be affected.

Lastly, there are several drones flying around in the training area under
host control.   Feel free to use them for target practice, but they might
shoot back!
_________________________________________________________________________

The Conference Rooms
Conference rooms are the staging areas for Air Warrior.  When  online  on
GEnie,  players  use the conference rooms and briefing rooms to enter and
exit the game, form up teams, select a  plane  and  load  up  passengers.
Anything not done while in flight is done in a conference room somewhere.

When you enter Air Warrior on GEnie, you'll be in general conference room
one.  Here you can talk with other players, look to see who is flying, or
move to  a different conference room to private conversations.  There are
a total of nine general conference rooms, open to anyone no matter  which
nationality (they're   located  in  a  neutral  country).    The  general
conference rooms are open to users with normal terminals as well, so  you
can  come  in  and  talk  even if you don't have the Air Warrior software
running.  If you want to discuss something with people of other countries
you can do it there in the general conference rooms.

Each country has a conference room located at  its  headquarters.    This
conference room is open only to players who belong to that country, so it
can be used for planning missions or other sensitive  discussions.    The
headquarters  conference  room is also open to users of normal terminals,
so that they can participate in these discussions if need be.

Each major airfield also has a briefing room, where pilots  readying  for
take off  or  returning from missions may talk.  These briefing rooms are
open only for users of the Air Warrior terminal software  and  of  course
only to members of that country.  From the briefing room at the airfield,
you can go into flight by selecting the plane you want  from  the  Planes
menu and then selecting the menu command to start flying, or entering the
proper keyboard commands.

The conference rooms provide a convenient way to talk  to  other  pilots,
all sitting  around  the same table, so to speak.  If you want to talk to
pilots at other airfields or in flight, you have to use the radio.  To go
into  a  radio  room  and put on a pair of headphones, you just enter the
tune command to select a radio frequency.  With headphones on, you  can't
hear the conversation going on back in the briefing room, but you'll hear
anything said by others on your frequency.

In flight, you can tune to any channel from 1 to  999,  just  as  in  the
radio rooms.    You  should  be  sparing  with  chatter  while in flight,
everyone (including you) will be busy flying their planes.

_________________________________________________________________________

Ground Vehicles
Air Warrior supports  several  types  of  surface  vehicles,  which  have
additional commands  to  support  their  special  capabilities.  Both the
Flakpanzer IV and the Jeep have guns for firing at  planes  overhead  and
the  T-34  medium  tank  carries  a  cannon  for  long range destruction.
Gunners and other passengers can sign on exactly as with the gunners of a
bomber.   One major difference from the bombers is that the driver of the
tank can change positions and operate a gun if the vehicle is stationary.

To enter a tank or FlakPanzer you select the Vehicles menu and type /Fly.
See the  Appendix  command  summary  for  Gearshift  controls.   You must
downshift for steep hills and bridges.

To occupy the gun position, first stop the tank, then type <esc>jg    for
gun position.  (This command will only function online.  No guns or bombs
function in practice mode.).  You can aim the turret  via  mouse  motions
plus keyboard turret commands listed in Appendix A.

The  tank gun position is unlike any other, because the gunner operates a
76.2 mm cannon, with an effective range of several miles.    The  display
will  look much like that from a bomber's bombsight, except that there is
a mouse-controlled pipper for adjusting the elevation of the  gun.    The
turret can  be  rotated  using  the usual turret rotation keys.  The zoom
keys are used to magnify the view through the sight, for finer adjustment
of aim  and  to examine targets at a great distance.  The rotational rate
of the turret is reduced at higher  magnification  modes  to  allow  fine
adjustment of turret position.

You fire just like in an aircraft (F key or Mouse Button).  Shells travel
a long distance and will take a while to reach the target.  Use the  ]  [
  keys to alter  magnification  up  to the  8x  limit.  It is best to aim
at lower  sight magnifications.   (3x  for  instance).    Changing  sight
magnification  actually  alters  the  range  (aim)  of  the  fired shell.
Generally, if you can see a target it is in range.  After firing you  can
zoom in for a closer look at the  hit.

Two players can ride in a tank at the same time.  Tanks cannot aim on the
fly.  Use the  /join   <pilot ####> g command.  /accept  or  /deny is the
standard response from the pilot.  Tanks also have a hull mounted .50 Cal
machine gun.  See the full position list in the Appendix A section.

Flackpanzers are operated similarly  to  tanks.    They  are  useful  for
knocking out  ACK  ACK  and  paratroopers!   You can wreck havoc at enemy
airstrips  blasting departing planes with a Flack.    600  yards  is  the
effective range.

_________________________________________________________________________

World Geography
The current Air Warrior world is made  up  of  three  major  theaters  of
operation, called  Europe,  the  Pacific  and World War I.  Each area has
different terrain and different  aircraft  to  choose  from.    Different
theaters  may  be  active at different times and all three will generally
not always be available simultaneously.  All players of Air  Warrior  are
members  of one of three countries and all three countries have territory
in each area.  The entire Air Warrior world is divided up  into  a  grid,
with  each  grid  sector  being  about twelve and a half miles on a side.
These grid sectors are used to give the general location of  runways  and
other planes.

Geographical Features
Within each major area, the Air Warrior world  is  divided  into  several
zones of operation in order to spread the action out a bit and to provide
additional variety in the choice of aircraft and the terrain being  flown
over.   In order to take off from an airfield, you may have to select the
appropriate theater of operations and reserve a position for yourself  in
that theater.    If you do not reserve a theater position before takeoff,
one will be automatically selected for you if one is  available.    If  a
theater is full, you will have to chose a different one and ,therefore, a
different set of airfields.   You  do  not  need  to  reserve  a  theater
position in order to fly as a gunner or passenger on a bomber, or to chat
with someone in a briefing room or at headquarters.

The World War I area is  all  contained  within  ZONE  5  and  lies  many
hundreds  of miles away from the main European area. The European area is
composed of three large lakes connected by rivers.  The rivers  form  the
natural boundaries  separating  the  three  countries.    Various  hills,
mountains, bridges and industries dot the landscape.   Forward  airfields
are capturable.    Rear area capital fields are located adjacent to major
industries.

The Pacific area is composed of three groups of home islands with a large
central atoll in between.  Action is fast and furious over the atoll with
occasional deep penetration raids to the home airfields.    The  area  is
divided up into three zones.

ZONE 6 is the naval zone with several aircraft carriers for each country.
Only a few carrier- qualified aircraft can operate from the carriers.

ZONE 7 is the main land-based airfields in  each  country.    Zone  8  is
comprised of several vehicle garages located within the central atoll.

_________________________________________________________________________

Capturing and Destroying Airfields
Most of the airfields in Air Warrior can be destroyed by bombing and some
can be  captured  and  used  by  different  countries.    Attacking enemy
airfields and defending your own is one of the  major  ongoing  strategic
activities in Air Warrior.

To destroy an airfield, you have to drop eight bombs on the field.   Each
bomb  crater  is repaired in five minutes, so to knock the field out, all
eight bombs must hit within five minutes of each other.    All  airfields
can be destroyed except the primary airfield in each theater of operation
(airfield 1 in the European  theater  and  airfield  14  in  the  Pacific
theater, in  each  country.)    During the special weekend Scenarios, the
number of bombs and the timings may be changed to suit the scenario.

Some of the airfields located between the countries  are  capturable,  so
that one country can use them to advance its base airfields closer to the
enemy's home country.  The three border airfields in Europe and the  four
airfields and garages on the atoll in the Pacific are capturable.

To capture an airfield, several actions must  be  accomplished  within  a
short period  of  time,  generally  five  minutes.  The control tower and
anti-aircraft defenses must first be knocked out and a C-47 Skytrain must
drop paratroops  to  capture  the  field.    Eight paratroopers must land
within a half-mile of the airfield  within  the  five  minute  period  to
capture the  field.    Note  that  the  garages  in  the  Pacific have no
anti-aircraft defenses or control tower so capturing them  involves  only
landing the paratroops.

To drop  paratroops,  take  off with a C-47 from a nearby airfield.  When
flying  over  the  field  with  an  altitude  of  least  500  feet   (the
paratroopers aren't idiots!), you tell the paratroopers to jump by giving
a special command over the intercom.  Hit the intercom key  '  then  type
the following:

'*go

This will cause one paratrooper to leap and you'll get a message when  he
does.  Repeat  the  sequence for each trooper in turn.  Paratroopers fall
fairly slowly, so be sure not to release them too high up.  They are very
vulnerable  to  fire  from  the  ground, so suppress any anti-aircraft or
Flakpanzer fire before dropping them!

_________________________________________________________________________

Strategic Targets
For those pilots who  want  to  damage  the  abilities  of  the  opposing
countries,  making  them more vulnerable to invasion, they can attack the
infrastructure of the enemy country directly.  Each  target  affects  the
capabilities of  a  country differently.  Damage to these targets can rob
them of planes, deteriorate their fuel or even make an airfield virtually
inoperable.

Types
The following sections describe the various strategic targets.    Targets
can  be  associated  with  airfields,  be  supply  producing or be supply
delivering.

Airfield Targets
There are a total of three types of strategic targets  available  at  the
airfields.   Each  of  these  targets  provides a service to the airfield
without which the operation of the field is degraded.  The following is a
description of each of the strategic targets.

Hangers are  used  to  store  and  repair  aircraft.    If a hangar at an
airfield is  destroyed,  the  maintenance  capability  of  the  field  is
impaired.  This will have the effect of aircraft possibly being issued to
pilots with maintenance problems or battle damage not properly repaired.

Fuel Storage facilities are used to store fuel.  If the  fuel  tanks  are
destroyed,  the airfield will be forced to use lower quality (i.e., lower
octane) fuel, which will result in reduced  engine  performance  for  the
aircraft.   Since  the  Me-109 and Me-262 were designed to operate on low
octane fuel, they are not affected by fuel degradation.

Ammunition Storage facilities are used to  store  ammunition  of  various
types.   If the ammo dumps are destroyed, the airfield may not be able to
stock aircraft with all the different types of ammo. An additional target
can be found in the form of an aircraft carrier.  Aircraft carriers carry
their basic services around with them and are  not  dependent  on  nearby
facilities.  Aircraft carriers are available only in the Pacific Theater.

Strategic Factories
There are three basic kinds of factories that support the  facilities  at
the airfields:    Ammunition  Factories,  Industrial  Factories  and  Oil
Refineries.   When  the  buildings  at  an  airfield  are  destroyed,  in
addition to  repairing those  buildings, the supplies they contained need
to be replaced before the airfield returns to full capacity.

There are three ways that  can  be done:
1)  A  drone  C-47  can fly supplies in, 
2)  A drone truck convoy can delivery supplies, 
3)  A player-flown C-47 or truck  can  deliver  the supplies.  

Each country will dispatch C-47's and  trucks  as  needed.    It  may  be
necessary to  protect  them  from enemy attack.  The /convoy command will
list the currently active host-run convoys for  your country.

Supply Convoys
Supplies can be loaded into a C-47 or truck.  To load a plane, go to  the
airfield that  is  fed  by the factory.  The /available command will show
whether supplies are available.  Use the /cargo command to  select    the
needed  goods.    Then  fly  to  the  destination  and land on the field.
Trucks are operated with the /truck command in  the  same  manner.    The
supplies  are  delivered  when you stop the truck on the airfield and end
the mission.

Convoys cannot be dispatched if the factory has been destroyed.  Thus any
airfields  needing resupply of a given type will not be able to obtain it
if the corresponding  factory  is  also  destroyed.  Destruction  of  the
factory will not  affect any airfield whose  facilities are intact.  Like
airfield facilities, the factory regains  function  before  the  building
returns  to  visibility,  so  it  is  not  possible  to  keep the factory
destroyed 100% of the time. Aircraft Factories

There are also  a  few  aircraft  factories.    If  these  factories  are
destroyed, any  airfield  that   does not have intact hangars will not be
able to operate that type plane.  A player  landing  that  plane  at  the
airfield  will  be  able  to take off again so long as he does not change
types of planes or leave the  airfield  before  takeoff.  The  /strategic
command will  display  the  status  of  the  factories  (assets) in  your
country and also a summary of the activity of each country  so  far  that
night.

Repair and Replacement
When a target is destroyed, the building vanishes for the  normal  period
of  time.  However, the service provided by the building actually returns
in half that time.  This means that it won't be  possible  to  knock  out
the  service  for  100%  of  the  time,  giving the defenders a chance to
recover.  The  command summary has descriptions for target related status
commands.

_________________________________________________________________________

Friendlies and Enemies
One of the most important concepts one has to master in Air Warrior after
playing  another  computer  flight  simulator  is that one will encounter
friendly  planes.  Shooting them is very much frowned upon!   Before  you
do  anything  else  while  sitting  on  the runway the first time online,
figure out who your friends and enemies  are.    A  very  common  mistake
occurs  when  a  new  pilot  opens fire on the first targets he sees, the
planes taking off ahead of him on the runway!  The enemy airfield is many
miles  away,  so  if  you  see  a plane on the ground ahead of you, it is
almost certainly a friend. On the Macintosh and Atari  ST  once  you  are
sitting  on  the  runway,  the  n command (<esc> n <Return>) will print a
short display of what icon shapes and colors  are  associated  with  what
country.   On  the  Amiga  and  IBM PC, a small display in the lower left
corner of the control panel gives the same information.

If you do kill a friendly plane, you will get a message from the software
informing you  of your mistake.  You are allowed one such accident per 24
hour period.  If you kill a second friendly,  you  will  become  what  is
known as  persona non grata, or PNG in the parlance of the players.  Your
own country will no longer trust you with live ammunition,  so  you  must
either wait till the next day or change to a different country.

_________________________________________________________________________

The Scoring System
Air  Warrior  keeps  track  of  points  earned  by  various   activities,
generating  a  cumulative score useful in assessing how much a player has
accomplished.  There are individual scores, squadron scores  and  country
scores.

Individual Scores
You can earn points in basically only one way, by inflicting damage on an
enemy country.   You can shoot down enemy planes or strafe and bomb enemy
ground targets.  You will earn some  score  for  damaging  a  target  and
additional score  if  you succeed in destroying it.  Once you have earned
points for your actions in the air, you will need to return your plane to
base to get credit for your victories.  Partial or full credit is awarded
under four scoring categories depending on how your mission ends.

The four scoring categories are:  Completed Mission, Ditched, Bailed  Out
and Crashed/Shot Down.

Completed Missions are missions in which you successfully land the  plane
at  a  friendly airfield, bring the plane to a complete stop, and use the
end command to return to the briefing room.  This will record all  points
earned in  the  mission, and gain you full credit for the mission.  It is
all right for the plane to be on fire when you  do  this;  the  important
thing is to bring it back!

Ditched  missions are missions that end with a successful soft landing in
friendly territory, but not on a runway.  You have to be more careful  to
touch down  slowly  than  if you land on a runway.  A mission ending in a
ditching, followed by an end command, will only be  worth  half  credit;.
Due  to  aircraft conditions it is often not possible getting back to the
runway.  Ditching in enemy territory is very bad  (delivering  an  intact
plane  to  the enemy is about the worst thing one can do) and counts as a
crash rather than  as a successful landing.

You can bail out of your plane at almost any  time.    If  you  are  over
friendly  territory,  you'll receive one-third credit for the mission (if
you make it safely to the ground).  Bailing out over enemy  territory  is
tantamount to being shot down, because the pilot, if he survives, will be
a prisoner of war.  Thus, a bail out over enemy territory is treated  the
same as  a  crash.    When  you bail out, the kill will be awarded to the
person who shot you.

Bailing out itself has risks that should be considered.  With any 
given bailing attempt, there are the following risks:

1)  There is a five percent chance that the chute will fail.

2)  There is a 50 percent chance of capture  or  death,  if  the  bailing
occurs  over neutral territory.

3)   Death  or  capture  is  assured  if  bailing is attempted over enemy
territory.

4)  It is possible to be shot down during a bailing  attempt.    If  this
happens, death will result.

Although it is possible to shoot down a pilot who has bailed, it  is  not
encouraged, if the pilot has bailed after a fair duel.

The  last category is one in which your mission results in your crashing,
your bailing out or ditching in enemy territory, or your being shot down.
In this category, the score recorded will be worth one-fourth credit.

There  is  an  additional  category,  which is currently not shown on the
score board.   This  is  the  system  error  category  for  all  missions
terminated  by  a  system  shutdown  or  a  crash of the Air Warrior host
software (as unlikely as that is).  Full credit will be awarded  for  any
missions in progress if one of these unfortunate events occurs.

Bonus points are awarded for hitting special targets, such  as  buildings
within towns, valuable airfields or buildings with special purposes, such
as radar towers.

In additions to points, the number of kills scored from enemy  planes  is
displayed for each category, separated into kills as a pilot and kills as
a gunner on a bomber.  The criterion for being awarded a kill on an enemy
plane  consists  of  inflicting serious damage on the enemy and having the
plane crash or the pilot bail out within ten minutes.  If more  than  one
person hit the plane, the kill will be awarded to the plane that fits the
above criterion, did the most damage and is still in the air.  Points are
always awarded for inflicting damage, but Air Warrior will not divide the
points for the kill itself among several pilots.   Fractional  kills  are
not given.

There is a survival bonus calculated on raw point  accumulations prior to
the 'outcome'  adjustment.    This  multiplier  relates to the successful
completion of multiple sorties.  There is significant  benefit to  safely
landing  several flights   in  succession.  The longevity point  benefits
will flatten after the first  several  consecutive  sorties.    Recouping
after  a  death  occurs  quickly.  In  a given flight, multiple kills are
scored at increasing values.

There is a bonus calculated for kills over hostile territory.   Strategic
ground targets    have  a varying point value and an indirect competitive
value in the conduct of the competition.  Certain strategic targets (like
a  V-1  intercept) will have added point value. The precise values of the
individual strategic targets is discussed in more detail in the Strategic
Targets section of this document. Bomber scores are separate from fighter
scores.  The bomber score includes all points accumulated while you  flew
or were a crew member on a bomber.  You  get  full  credit for the totals
accrued by everyone during the mission.  Ground vehicle scores  sum  into
the BMB column at 1/10 raw score.

Bomber Points are also awarded to C-47 pilots for troop drops.   You  get
50  points  for  each  paratrooper  who  makes it to an airfield and 1000
points to capture the  field.    A  fully  crewed  bomber  will  generate
multiples of  the basic points scored during the flight.  These duplicate
benefits will go equally to  each  crew  member,    squadron  totals  and
country totals.   Deaths due to bomber or gunner missions will not effect
the fighter score rates.

Squadron Scores
The squadron scores is the total of the scores for all the members of the
squad that  they  have  accumulated  while  they were on the squad.  If a
squad member leaves the squad in mid-campaign, his score no longer counts
towards the squad's score.

Country Scores
The country score is determined by the  achievements  of  the  individual
pilots.   The  score  is  updated  at 5 am ET when the scoreboard for the
individual pilots is updated.  It is, quite simply, the sum  of  all  the
scores of the individual pilots from a given country.

Displaying Scores
The Print Scores menu is used to display a list of the scores of  all  of
the players.

The complete score listing is updated  daily  at  5  A.M.  Eastern  time.
Scores  displayed  in  the  conference  rooms  within the game are always
current, so may differ slightly from  the  scores  on  the  board.    The
Squadrons  entry will list the team scores; the team score is computed as
the sum of the cumulative scores of each of the current members.

All the scores will be periodically cleared, generally every three weeks,
so that newcomers have a chance to compete on an even footing.  The final
scores from each campaign will be posted  in  the  Air  Warrior  Software
Library -1-.

The /who command prints a short summary of score detail.   The  following
is an example of the display:

Troubleshooting
This section provides helpful hints about common problems that  occur  in
Air Warrior.  Each problem is defined and a list of possible solutions is
provided after it.

QUESTION:
I can fly fine in Practice Mode, but when I try to fly  on  GEnie  I  get
dropped out of  flight  or  disconnected.   There are several things that
can cause this; they are:

A.  You are using 300 baud.  Air Warrior does not work  properly  at  300
baud and  must  have  at  least 1200 baud.  Running at 2400 baud does not
give a significant advantage.

B.  Your modem is echoing characters back to the  microcomputer.    GEnie
normally  runs  in  Half Duplex and it is common to instruct the modem to
locally echo characters back so that you can see  what  you  are  typing.
Air Warrior cannot run with a modem doing this.  You should set the modem
up for Full Duplex, i.e. NOT echoing and use the Local Echo option within
Air Warrior instead.  Air Warrior will then echo what you are typing when
it is appropriate.

C.  You are getting a lot of line noise.    You  can  usually  tell  this
elsewhere on GEnie as well, if a lot of your commands fail.

D.  The host software on GEnie crashed.  This does happen  sometimes  and
occasionally the  hardware  itself will fail, dropping all the users.  If
this happens, try getting back in.  If it happens again, especially if it
is happening only to you and its not one of the four things above, let us
know via Feedback.  If its happening to other people too,  its  not  your
problem, its ours!

________

QUESTION:
I get a box on the screen saying I bailed out, when I didn't. 

A]  This  is  a failure of  the  network to pass the data back and  forth
fast enough.    It  shouldn't  happen and its been getting better as time
goes by, but if this happens to you often let us know!

_________________________________________________________________________

Flight Testing for Consistency
Each version of Air Warrior undergoes very stringent testing  across  the
different computers  (Macintosh,  Atari ST, Amiga, and IBM PC).  The goal
is to ensure that the flight performance of each plane  modeled  in  Air
Warrior is consistent across the board.

The  testing  was  performed  by internally instrumenting the program, to
eliminate the errors that would occur  by  manually  controlling  flight,
reading  the  instruments  or  following  a stop watch. Not only were the
observable  variables  instrumented,  but   also   internal   aerodynamic
quantities  such  as  thrust,  engine  horsepower,  drag,  lift, angle of
attack, lift coefficient, air density, and so on. The resolution  of  the
differences  being  sought  was smaller than could readily be seen on the
instruments, since split second timing was often required to  make  valid
comparisons.

Initial conditions for the various tests were established exactly by  the
automated facility, so that no human error or influence would be present.
The tests were performed on a number of different aircraft,  representing
the various extremes of both performance and certain critical properties.

The tests  were  performed  both  in  practice  mode  and  online.   They
consisted of the following:

1.  An instrumented take off roll, followed by  an  11  minute  climb,  a
minute  of  level  acceleration,  then a 60 degree dive, usually into the
ground, or 3 minutes, whichever came first.  Acceptance was based on  the
point  at  which  the plane reached full throttle, the point at which the
plane left the ground, the altitude, speed, angle of  climb,  and  engine
horsepower  at the peak of the climb, the speed reached by the end of the
acceleration, the time and speed at which buffeting began during the dive
(if  it  did),  the  peak Mach number in the dive (for the F-86), and the
time and speed of impact.

2.  A 2/3 aileron deflection roll in expert mode.  Acceptance  was  based
on  rate  of roll, and loss of altitude and change of attitude during one
complete roll. A roll time varied from 1.5 seconds for the Sabre to 40 or
so  for  the  B-17  (the  B-17  did not complete the roll before the test
ended.)

3.  A test of full rudder deflection at  an  exact  speed  and  altitude.
Acceptance  was based on the amount of course change, amount of roll, and
amount of altitude lost during a one minute deflection.

4.  A full elevator deflection  loop  starting  at  an  exact  speed  and
altitude.   Acceptance  was  based on the g's pulled at various points in
the loop, the altitude gained during the loop, the final altitude at  the
end  of  the  loop,  the  time  at  which various points in the loop were
reached, and the velocities at various points in the loop.

5.  A test of the top speed of  the  plane,  at  two  or  more  different
altitudes representing  different  performance  regimes.    The plane was
placed at the correct speed, and acceptance was based  on  comparison  of
internal values during a one minute run at that speed.

6.   A  test  of stall performance. The plane was placed in a known climb
attitude at a known speed, then throttle  was  reduced  by  the  program.
Acceptance  was  based  on  the  speed of the stall, altitude of stall (a
check on the climb), various internal  values  at  the  stall,  the  time
required  for  the nose to drop through horizontal, the time required for
recovery from the stall, and the altitude changes associated  with  those
points.

In addition,  tests  were  run  at  several  different  settings  on  the
Macintosh II, to quantify the effect of monochrome vs color, that is, the
frame rate, on aerodynamic performance (the Macintosh II was the  easiest
machine  to perform this test on, it was also done on the IBM PC with its
variable clock speed.) Several equations were changed  to  retain  better
numerical  accuracy  in  accounting for very fast update times and better
accuracy in handling unusual clock frequencies.

Lastly, a drag race was run with a  jeep  and  a  tank,  to  measure  the
acceleration,  turning radius, and roll performance (grin) of the vehicle
under an automatically controlled test. A bug in the roll over  point  in
the jeep was found and corrected.

In conclusion, we are confident that the machine to  machine  performance
is  identical,  to a far greater degree than the accuracy at which a user
can read the instrument panel and control  an  airplane  manually.    One
thing that became apparent early on was how sensitive the planes are, and
how even a very small difference in control setting or initial conditions
can produce  results different enough to mislead the observer.  Automated
testing was essential.
