Hello, everybody!

This is Disk 1 of FarWest Demo Version V2.91, working now on A1200.

To play this game from Disk, unpack the subdirectories FarWest-1 to FarWest-3
to three Disks named FarWest-1:, FarWest-2: and (guess what) FarWest-3:
FarWest needs the following files from your Workbench-Disk:

	run, stack, copy, assign 	-> FarWest-1:
	disk-validator, ram-Handler	-> FarWest-1:l
	mathtrans.library		-> FarWest-1:libs


If you prefer to play FarWest from hd, unpack it to a directory you like and
create a file named "FarWest.assigns" in this directory, containing:

	assign FarWest-1: [yourpath]/FarWest-1
	assign FarWest-2: [yourpath]/FarWest-2
	assign FarWest-3: [yourpath]/FarWest-3

now start FarWest.hd...

Eh, yes, and it would be good if you got some knowledge of the german tongue,
cause there's only a German version available.... NO!!! PLEASE DON'T HIT ME!!!

Have fun!
