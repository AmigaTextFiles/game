 @{b}@{u}Requirements@{uu}@{ub}

 This game is written in an OS-friendly way, so it may not be as fast as a
 common hardwarehack would be but it runs on 68060 processors and on
 gfx-boards.

 Diamond Caves II requires:

 - Kickstart 2.0
 - 1MB chipmem and 2MB fastmem
 - Harddisk

 - asl.library v38 (if you want to use the screenmode requester,
   asl.lib v38 can be found on the Workbench Disk V2.1 or 3.x)
 - @{" MUI " Link Mui} 3.x (if you want to use the Editor,
   MUI can be found on AmiNet)

 recommended for ultimate joy:

 - Kickstart 3.x
 - at least a 68020
 - 2MB chipmem

 This program has beed successfully tested with Enforcer, Mungwall and
 CodeWatcher.

 Diamond Caves II runs fine on ECS, AGA and CyberGfx.


 @{b}@{u}Installation@{uu}@{ub}

 @{u}Diamond Caves II@{uu} can be run directly out of its directory. To
 install Diamond Caves II to (hard)disk, just copy the whole directoy
 (including all the subdirectorys) to the destination volume. If you are
 using the Workbench, drag the DC2 drawer where you want it.

 You might want to change some of the options in the game, for example the
 screenmode. This can be done in the @{" Title Menu " Link Game} of the game.

@NODE Game "The Game"

 @{b}@{u}Welcome to Diamond Caves II@{ub}@{uu}

 Like Diamond Caves I, this game is based on the idea of Boulder Dash back
 on the good old C64 and the great Amiga game Emerald Mine by Kingsoft. I
 added some new ideas and updated the Diamond Caves I gfx and sfx.

 The main goal is to collect enough Emeralds or Diamonds and reach the Exit
 in time.

 This task may be mastered alone or in teamwork.

 If you are an experienced Diamond Caves I or Emerald Mine player, you might
 start the game right now, everything is self-explaining or at least very
 DC and EM like.

 And if you continuously fail to solve a level, try watching the replay-file,
 it may give you a clue.


 @{b}@{u}The Titlemenu@{uu}@{ub}

 You can select the options using a Josytick in port 2 or the Keybaord.

 The titlemenu of Diamond Caves II contains the following items:
 * Player
   this is your name in the game. Using this name, you can record your
   progress throughout the whole game and every Level. You may select a
   present name, delete one or enter a new name.
   You have to select a name if you want to play a Level.
   * Player (single)
   * Player (teammode)
   In addition to the Players name, you can always see wether you are
   playing in single player mode or in teammode. To change between
   these modes, move your Joystick to the left or right while on this
   item.
 * Levelgroup
   Each Levelgroup has a name and may contain up to 99 Levels. Some contain
   less but you always have to solve a Level to get access to the next one.
   You have to select a Levelgroup if you want to play a a Level. If you
   have not played this Levelgroup before, you can only select the first
   Level.
 * Level
   This is the currently selected Level. If you select play, you will start
   with this levelnumber out of the selected levelgroup.
 * Handicap
   This is your maximum level available. You can not play levels higher that
   your current handicap in this levelgroup but if you solve the highest
   level, you will get access to the next one. The number in brackets is the
   maximum number of levels available in this levelgroup.
 * Highscores
   Click here to read the top-30 highscore list for the selected level.
   A highscoreentry looks like this:

       Score Time Player
    ...
    8 S 1805  161 Hawk
    9 T 1670  148 the two guys
   10 S 1482  152 somebody
      |   |    |   |
      |   |    |   +- the players name
      |   |    +----- the time (in sec) that was left when he entered the exit
      |   +---------- the score
      +-------------- "S" = single player mode and "T" = teammode

 * start game
   the most important option in this menu: start the game
 * record game
   this will start the game like "start game" does but everything you do will
   be recorded for you to watch it later or show it to your friends!
 * replay game
   Click here to watch a previously recorded game.
   Every Level in the unregistered version comes with pre-recorded
   replay-files for both single player and teammode.
 * game options
   to configure the game, see below
 * exit
   I hope you won't need this too often...


 The bottom of the title menu provides you with these additional information:
 * Score
   The overall and complete Score of the selected Player. Every game he has
   every played goes into this.
 * Games won:
   The number of games he has won (and in brackets the complete number of
   games played).


 @{b}@{u}Game Options@{uu}@{ub}

 This menu offers some configuration options:

 * Number of Players
   Single player mode or team mode (two players at the same time).
 * Player1
 * Player2
   Select how you want to control each player. Currently possible are
   Joystick in port 1 (mouse port), Joystick in port 2 and Keyboard.
   Keyboard means cursor keys and space or shift as the firebutton.
 * screenmode
   Diamond Caves II will run on (hopefully) every screenmode that is
   capable of displaying at least 320x240 in 32 colors. You need
   asl.library v38 to use this menu item because of the asl screenmode
   requester. asl.lib v38 is part of the Amiga OS since Kickstart2.1
   Diamond Caves II runs even on CyberGfx screens but you should be
   aware of the fact that the game can get realy slow if the playfield
   is bigger than the CyberGfx screen.
   Note: In Diamond Caves II, the same screenmode is used for both the
   title menu and the actual game. The title menu will adapt it's font
   if the screen is at least 640x400.
 * Audio
   Turn audio on or off. If you turn it off, the program will not even
   open the audio.device so that you can play any kind of music (mod-file)
   in the background.
 * Animation
   I have introduced this item to speed up the game on slow Amigas. You can
   select the number of animation sequences between every move. The more
   animations, the smoother the gfx and the more CPU-power is needed. Less
   animations will reduce the number of frames per second (fps) and speed
   up the game:

  @{u} anim fps @{uu}
   full  48 (standard)
    med  24 (quite playable)
    low  12
    off   6 (Boulder Dash like)

 * DBL Fix
   This is something I have added to fix a bug (or a limitation) of the AGA
   chipset. The AGA chipset can not scroll large overscan-screens propperly,
   there is a flickering part of the screen at the left border. If you have
   seen this once, you know what I mean.
   This Fix will turn this part of the screen black so you won't get confused
   by the flickering.
 * fast CyberGfx
   While playing on a CyberGfx screenmode you may notice that the game can get
   really slow if the playfield is bigger than the visible area of the screen.
   Turning the fast CyberGfx mode on will speed up the game in a way that it
   only gets slow while scrolling the playfield. This mode is still under
   developement and might get improved in future versions.
 * NoScreenBlank
   Set this option to 'on' if you want to deactivate your screenblanker during
   gameplay because most screenblankers don't react on Joystick movement.
 * Use
   Click here or press ESC to save the changes to disk and return to the main
   menu.


 @{b}@{u}In the Game@{uu}@{ub}

 In the game you will notice a status bar above the actual playfield. This
 status bar provides you with all the necessarry information about what you
 have collected so far (keys, dynamite, etc...) and of course how much time
 is left and how much Emeralds you have to collect.

 In the game you may use the following keys:

 [P] to pause/unpause the game
 [ESC] to quit the game

 In teammode, the screen will by default focus on both players which means
 that you can not move very far apart from each other depending on the size
 of your screenmode. Or use one of these keys:

 [F1] to focus the screen on Player 1
 [F2] to focus the screen on Player 2
 [F3] to focus the screen on both Players (default)


 You know how to configure and start the game,
 now read all about @{" the Objects in the game " Link Objects}.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Objects "The Objects in the game"

 These are the objects you may encounter during gameplay:

 * @{b}Empty Space@{ub} (black)
   not much to say :-)

 * @{b}Sand@{ub}
   you can walk through it, Monsters can't

 * @{b}Emerald@{ub}
   the key object in the game. Collect as many of these green gems as you can.

 * @{b}Diamond@{ub}
   some kind of advanced Emerald, the Diamond is worth three Emeralds.
   can be smashed by a Boulder

 * @{b}Pearl@{ub}
   even more fragile than the Diamond, the Pearl is worth five Emeralds

 * @{b}Crystal@{ub}
   the most valuable gem in the Caves, the Crystal is worth eight Emeralds
   and can't be destroyed

 * @{b}Boulder@{ub}
   well, a rock is a rock. Be sure not to rest below one of them,
   they mightsmash you!

 * @{b}Bombs@{ub}
   highly explosive!

 * @{b}Nuts@{ub}
   they reveal an Emerald if cracked open by a boulder.

 Boulders, Nuts and Bombs can be moved by the Player!

 * @{b}Walls@{ub}
   * steel Walls - can't be destroyed, some have signs on them
   * brick Walls - can be crushed using some kind of explosion (Bomb)
   * brick Walls containing Emeralds, Diamonds or other gems
     use a Bomb or Dynamite to get the jewel
   * magic Wall (blue) - once a Boulder or a jewel falls onto the magic
     wall, the wall starts spinning for a few seconds, changing everything
     that falls through

 Rumors say that there are walls that expand to their sides
 and some have even seen (?) invisible walls...

 * @{b}Doors@{ub}
   * there are Doors you need a key for (red, green, blue and yellow doors)
     Some doors are grey, so you don't know which kind of key you will need
   * White doors - you will need one white key every time you cross the door!
   * Doors you can open/close using a blue switch
   * Doors that open when you spin a green wheel and close if the wheel stops
     spinning

 * @{b}Conveyor belts@{ub}
   Can be turned on/off using a switch. Things lying on the belt will move!
   Has been seen in three different colors.

 * @{b}Quicksand@{ub}
   Looks almost like ordinary earth but you can't walk through it.
   Boulders may sink into and out of the quicksand. The darker the quicksand,
   the slower the Boulders.

 * @{b}Mine@{ub}
   The mine looks like a piece of earth where someone burried something. Don't
   step on this field because you might explode! You can disarm a mine by
   touching it.

 * @{b}Exit@{ub}
   a special gate which starts flashing if you have enough Emeralds to enter.
   Has been seen as a blue gate and as a grey steel gate.

 * @{b}Acidpool@{ub}
   everything that falls into the Acid is gone forever, including you!

 * @{b}Dynamite@{ub}
   get it and blow away walls and monsters. Ignite the Dynamite by holding
   down your firebutton for a few seconds. Then run away!

 * @{b}Shield coin@{ub}
   A Forcefield to protects you. Your player-sprite will fade to grey while
   in protected mode. You will hear a special sound to indicate the forcefield
   going down because it only lasts for a few seconds. The number of moves the
   forcefield will last is also shown in the status bar on top of the screen.

 * @{b}Extratime@{ub}
   (green coin) will be added to your time

 * @{b}Note@{ub}
   The note contains something the author of the Level wants to tell you.

 * @{b}Bug@{ub}
   crawling on the right wall, the Bug can be changed into nine Emeralds
   and one Diamond if crushed by a boulder

 * @{b}Spaceship@{ub}
   always moves on the left wall

 Touching the Bug or the Spaceship is very dangerous!

 * @{b}Robot@{ub}
   This one follows you until he can kill you!
   Try spinning the Wheel to divert the Robot.

 * @{b}Wheel@{ub}
   if you spin the Wheel, the Robot will run towards the Wheel and not towards
   you. The Wheel only lasts for a few seconds.

 * @{b}Eater@{ub}
   This brother of Pacman will eat Diamonds and can be changed into
   various things (be surprised!) by smashing him with a boulder

 * @{b}the amoeba@{ub}
   expands through normal sand and quicksand. Beware of the drops!
   Spaceships and Bugs won't survive contact with the amoeba.

 * @{b}the mole@{ub}
   Not a real enemy, the mole does not harm the player. It leaves earth
   behind and can eat the amoeba.

@NODE Editor "The Editor"

 @{b}@{u}Welcome to the Diamond Caves II Leveditor@{ub}@{uu}

 @{b}IMPORTANT: To speed up the release of Diamond Caves II, I decided to
 release this 99% version of the Editor. Some additional support functions
 described in this manual are not yet finished but they will be in the next
 version.@{ub}

 This programm is based on @{" MUI " Link Mui} which is © Stefan Stuntz.
 You do @{b}not@{ub} have to be a registerd user of MUI. MUI can be found on
 Aminet/util/libs or on nearly every Amiga-PD CD-ROM. If you can't get
 hold of MUI, send @{" me " Link Hawk} an empty disk and I will give you
 the latest version of MUI.

 @{" Running the Editor on its own screen " Link Editscreen}

 Note: The Editor supports online-help. This means that you can hold the
 mouse-pointer over any button, wait a second and a help bubble will apear
 displaying a short help-text.


 @{b}@{u}The main window@{uu}@{ub}

 If you are familiar with the Diamond Caves I Leveleditor, you will notice
 that a lot has changed. You're now dealing with one big window only, most
 of the text-gadgets have been replaced by icons and loading and saving
 levels is now a lot easier.

 Let's begin with the icons (speed-buttons) directly below the title bar of
 the window.

 * New game (blank page)
   This will create a new, blank playfield and reset all values to their
   defaults.
 * Load a Level (open drawer)
   Will pop up the Load/Save window where you can select a levelgroup and
   load a Level. It's also possible to load old Diamond Caves I or even
   Emerald Mine Levels.
   @{" Click for more information about this dialog " Link LoadSave}
 * Save Level (disk)
   Will save the Level.
   @{" Click for more information about this dialog " Link LoadSave}
 * Export Levelgroup (Drawer -> disk)
   using this option you can save a whole Levelgroup into one single file,
   ready to give it away.
   @{" Click for more information about this dialog " Link ImExport}
 * Import Levelgroup (disk -> Drawer)
   use this option to include a Levelgroup into your program someone else
   has saved to disk.
   @{" Click for more information about this dialog " Link ImExport}
 * Single Player Test (Joystick)
   Using this button you can test the current Level directly from the Editor
 * Teammode test (Joystick 2)
   Test in 2 player mode
 * Statistic Window (Emerald with a Questionmark)
   Open/Close the statistic window.

 * Snapshot (camera)
   save every window position to disk
 * About/Preferences (Questionmark)
   Open the About and Preferences dialog.

 @{u}Important@{ub}: Save, Test and Import/Export are disabled in the
 unregistered version!.


 The rest of the window is devided into several sections, the @{u}Edit@{uu} section
 and the @{u}Values@{uu} section. The Edito section is once more devided into a
 @{u}Playfield@{uu} and an @{u}Eater@{uu} part.


 @{b}@{u}The Edit part@{uu}@{ub}

 The left side of the Edit part holds a collection of lists containing all of
 the items you may place into the playfield. The lists are sorted the
 following way:
 * misc things like Emeralds, Dynamite, the Players, etc...
 * Steel walls
 * Brick walls
 * Doors and Keys
 * Conveyor belts
 * Enemys
 * Letters (devided into blue, blue steel, green and green steel)


 @{b}@{u}The Edit part: Playfield@{uu}@{ub}

 This is the main part where you can edit the actual playfield. To do this I
 have added several options you might know from your paint program. The top
 line holds all the necessarry tools:

 * Free hand (mouse pointer)
 * Lines
 * Rectangles
 * filled Rectangles
 * Fill

 * Text (letter A)
   place text into the playfield instead of picking every letter by hand
 * random (dice)
   place the selected object randomly in the playfield. To alter the amount
   of items, use the "random" slider.
 * Clear (trashcan)
   Fill the whole playfield with the selected entry.

 * Check Level (Page with Questionmark)
   This will check your level for several things like "not enough exits",
   "incomplete acid pools" etc... This check is automatically performed
   if you want to save the Level
 * Move/SizeChange (Button with Arrows on it)
   Here you can move the playfield in itself or change its size.

 Please note that you can only place steel items in the border of the
 playfield unless you have turned on the expert mode. To activate the
 expert mode, click on the square above the item list. But be careful with
 this mode because unexpected behaviour of the game (like enemies running
 out of the playfield) can even cause your computer to crash. Use at your
 own risk!


 @{b}@{u}The Edit part: Eater@{uu}@{ub}

 New in Diamond Caves II: You can now change the number of Eater explosions.
 From one up to eight different explosions are possible.


 @{b}@{u}The Value part@{uu}@{ub}

 Here you can set all the non-visible attributes of a Level:

 * Title
   The title that is displayed when someone starts the Level
 * Author
   Enter your name here

 * Note: Headline
   If you have placed a note in the playfield, you can enter the headline
   of the message here.
 * Note: Body
   This is the main text of the note

 * Password
   This password can be used to prevent other users from loading and/or
   editing this Level in the Leveleditor. It has nothing to do with the
   game itself! Everyone can still @{u}play@{uu} the Level but only the one who
   knows the password can @{u}edit@{uu} it!

 * Score
   You can set a specific amount of Score the Player gets when performing
   certain things:
   * Emerald, Diamond, Pearl, Crystal, Key, Dynamite: Collecting this item
   * Nut: cracking the Nut with a Boulder
   * Robot, Eater, Bug, Spaceship : Killing this foe with a Boulder
   * Exit: Score you will get for every 10 seconds left
     (example: Score set to 990 means you will get Score 99
     for every single second)

 * Time
   This is a bit complicated because some values are given in seconds and some
   are given in moves (the time the player needs to move from one square to
   another). One move is exaclty 1/6 second so if you want to transfer seconds
   to moves: multiplay by 6, moves to seconds: devide by 6.

   (in Seconds)
   * Game
     Time (in seconds) the player has to complete the Level
   * Extratime
     Time (inn Seconds) that gets added to the game time if the player
     collects a green time coin.

   (in moves)
   * magic wall
     Time (in moves) the magic wall spins after the first item hit it
   * wheel
     Time (in moves) the wheel spins after the player started it
   * light
     Time (in moves) the light makes invisible things visible
   * time gate
     Time (in moves) the time gate is open after the player started the wheel
   * forcefield
     Time (in moves) the player is invulnerable after collecting a (yellow)
     shield coin

 * Amoeba
   Well, this is no real time, it's just some kind of specification on how
   fast the amoeba will grow. The higher, the faster - zero means no growing.

 * Collect
   The number of Emeralds the Player has to collect before the Exit will open.


 @{b}@{u}The Statistic Window@{uu}@{ub}

 The statistic Window can be opened using the button below the title bar of
 the window. It displays number of these items:
 * Emeralds, Diamonds, Pearls and Crystal - including those stuck in brick
   walls.
 * Nuts
 * The number of all gems and Nuts computed together, to get the total number
   of Emeralds the Player has to collect.
 * Bugs, Spaceships, Robots, Moles and Eater
 * Keys, Coins and Dynamite
 * Boulders
 * standard and steel Exits (devided into open and closed)

@ENDNODE

@NODE LoadSave "The Load/Save dialog"

 @{b}Note: Please do not edit any files in the data/ directory by hand! This may
 result in loss of data!! Please use this dialog instead.@{ub}


 @{b}@{u}The Load/Save dialog@{uu}@{ub}

 Using this dialog you can do more than just load and save Levels, you can
 manage complete levelgroups and even load old DC and EM Levels.

 The Window is organized the following way:

 * Levelgroups (left side)
   This is a complete list of all Levelgroups available.
   * Create
     Create a new Levelgroup.
   * Rename
     Rename the selected Levelgroup. Dublicate names are allowed.
   * Delete
     Delete the current Levelgroup and all the Levels in it
 * Levels (right side)
   If you have selected a Levelgroup, this is a list of all the Levels in this
   group. Missing Levels are shown as [empty] slots.
   * Exchange
     Exchange two levels (even across Levelgroups). Click on the first Level
     then on Exchange (the button stays depressed) and the click on the second
     Level. This procedure will automatically swap the Levels and their
     Highscorelists and replay-files.
   * Rename
     Rename the selected Level. Dublicate Levels are allowed
   * Delete
     Delete the selected Level, his Highscore and his replay-files.
 * Load old EM or DC Level
   This will pop up another window where you can select the specific file and
   file-type to load. If you have any problems converting old Levels, please
   tell me and I will try to fix this.

@ENDNODE

@NODE ImExport "The Import and Export dialog"

 @{b}Note: Please do not edit any files in the data/ directory by hand! This may

 @{b}@{u}The Export dialog@{uu}@{ub}

  Using this dialog you can transfer a whole Levelgroup into a single file
  (including Highscorelists and replay-files) ready to give it away.
  Simply click on the specific Levelgroup and don't forget to enter a
  filename.

  Please do not copy any files by hand to/from the data/ directory of
  Diamond Caves II. This may result in loss of data.


 @{b}@{u}The Import dialog@{uu}@{ub}

  Using this dialog you can include previously saved Levelgroups into your

@NODE Editscreen "Running the Editor on its own screen"

 @{b}@{u}running the Diamond Caves II Leveleditor on its own screen@{uu}@{ub}

 By default, the Editor opens its windows on the Workbench. This is ok
 if your Workbench has enough colors but looks not very nice if you run
 your WB with less than 32 colors. In this case, you should open a second
 screen for the Diamond Caves II Editor, here's how to do it:

 1) start the @{u}Editor@{uu}, the main window apears on the Workbench

 2) click on the @{u}Questionmark@{uu} button, then on @{u}Preferences@{uu} and then on
    @{u}MUI-Preferences@{uu}. The MUI preferences window pops up

 3) In the list to the left, click on the item @{u}System@{uu}

 4) Click on @{u}Call Inspector@{uu} in the @{u}Public Screen@{uu} group,
    the PSI (Public Screen Inspector) apears

 5) Click on @{u}New@{uu} to define a new screen, an (unnamed) screen
    apears

 6) Activate this (unnamed) screen in the list, then select @{u}Edit@{uu},
    the "Edit Screen" window pops up

 7) Enter a @{u}name@{uu} for the Public Screen, for example "DC2EDIT"
    Enter a @{u}title@{uu} for the Screen, for example
    "Diamond Caves II Editor" or something like that.

 8) Activate the @{u}Display@{uu} group, a screenmode requester apears in
    this group

 9) Select the apropriate @{u}screenmode@{uu},
    for example DBL-PAL:High Res Laced Flickerfree      (if you have AGA)
             or CVision: 8bit 800 x 600       (if you have a CyberVision)
    Recommended: a screen with a size of at least 640x400

 10) Select the @{u}depth@{uu}.
     Recommended: at least a depth of 6 (64 colors)

 11) Leave the Edit Screen window by clicking on @{u}Ok@{uu}.

 12) Leave the PSI (Public Screen Inspector) by clicking on @{u}Save@{uu}

 13) Back to the MUI Preferences program:
     Select the created screen by clicking on the @{u}pop-up button@{uu} above the
     call inspector button

@NODE Register "How to register"

 I spent a lot of work in Diamond Caves II so I think it's only fair to demand
 a little reward if want to use my program on a regular basis.

 After paying the shareware fee you will receive an access code via E-Mail or
 snail mail.

 @{b}If you are a registered user of Diamond Caves I...@{ub}
 ...you will get Diamond Caves II for half the price. Just read on and devide
 all the prices by two. That's what you have to pay.

 To turn your unregistered version of Diamond Caves II into a registered
 version, start the Leveleditor and click on the questionmark (top/right
 corner). You can enter your access code below the 'Register' button. It will
 be saved to disk after you press 'Ok' and it turns both the Game and the
 Editor into a registered version.

 @{b}please do @{u}not@{uu} redistribute your access code@{ub}

 The registered version features:

 - you will get access to hundreds of @{b}new Levels@{ub}, the unregistered version
   is not capable of playing more than the 50 Levels included

 - you will now be able to use the @{b}Leveleditor@{ub} to create your own
   Levels. Save and Test are disabled in the unregistered version.


 @{b}@{u}How to register@{uu}@{ub}

 If you want to register, you can simply use the @{u}Register@{uu} button
 in the @{" Leveleditor " Link Editor}. Here you can print a registration
 form, ready to put it in the envelope or to send it via E-Mail.

 Or you can send me a short note including your full name, address (street,
 city, country) and your E-Mail address if you want to get the keyfile via
 E-Mail. I also would like to know where you got Diamond Caves II from
 (AmiNet, Coverdisk, ...) and what you like/dislike. Feel free to mail me
 any comments or send new levels if you already are a registered user.

  any problems yet.
