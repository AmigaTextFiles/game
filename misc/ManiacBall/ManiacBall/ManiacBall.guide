@NODE Game "The Game"

 @{b}@{u}Welcome to ManiacBall@{ub}@{uu}

 This game is based on the idea of Breakout, a classic arcade game of the
 80s. The main goal is to remove every brick from the playfield by hitting
 them with a ball. This ball bounces off every wall and to control it, you
 have one or more paddles to modify the way, the ball moves.


 @{b}@{u}The Titlemenu@{uu}@{ub}

 You can select the options using the mouse or the keybaord.

 The titlemenu of ManiacBall contains the following items:
 * start game
   warp to the first level of the current levelgroup
 * enter playername
   clicking here you can enter a new name. This name will be used for the
   Highscorelists (see below). To save this name, use @{u}save options@{uu} from
   the options menu
 * select new Levels
   displays a list of all the available levelgroups
   To get the same levelgroup at the next startup, use @{u}save options@{uu} from
   the options menu.
   Each levelgroup contains 25 levels.
   This Option is disabled in the unregistered version
 * enter password
   you can type in a password and enter the game at any level you like.
   Note that the password consists of two digits representing the
   levelnumber and the actual password. Example:
   You have a level, saved as nr.5 with the password "test".
   To start at this level you have to type "05test"
   @{b}Random mode@{ub}: If you enter "00random" here, you can enter the random mode
   which lets you play the levels of the group in a random order.
 * view highscores
   Press the left mouse button to get the next list, right button for the
   previous list.
   There is one Highscore list for each Level which only contains the five
   best times. And there is a big Highscore list for each Levelgroup which
   contains the ten best scores in this group.
   Note: Solving an entire Levelgroup (finishing Level 25) will give you
   11111 extra points for every life you have left.
   A typical Highscore entry looks like this:
     04 S Hawk       00021560
     |  |  |           |
     |  |  |      this is the score
     |  | this is the name
     | S=single mode, T=team mode
    the Level, the player lost his last life
    ** means that the player was playing in random mode
   Highscores are saved automatically.
 * options
   This is the preferences menu:
   * audio titlemenu
     you can turn the music in the titlemenu on and off
     if you want a different music, simply replace the file "mod.vogue" in
     the sfx directory. Or turn off the music and use your favorite
     mod-player to play a music in the background.
   * audio game
     you can select the music (same as in the titemenu), the sound-fx or
     turn off sounds completly.
   * resolution
     LoRes is the standard 320x222 resolution with 32 colors.
     HiRes is an improved 640x444 version of the game (32 colors).
   * screenmode
     select a new screenmode for the game.ManiacBall supports
     ECS, for example PAL-LoRes and NTSC-LoRes (LoRes only)
     AGA, for example PAL-LoRes, DBL-PAL-LoRes, NTSC, NTSC-LoRes (LoRes)
      and PAL-HiRes-Interlaced, DBL-PAL-HiRes-Interlaced... (HiRes)
     CyberGfx, use the standard 320x240 (LoRes) or 640x480 (HiRes)
      screenmode. If you want the game to use the whole screen, you have to
      define your own screenmodes with 320x222 (LoRes) and 640x444 (HiRes).
     @{b}Important@{ub}: You need asl.library v38 or higher (part of Workbench 2.1)
     to successfully open the screenmode requester!
   * play mode
     single player controls all paddles,
     in team mode player 1 controls the horizontal paddles, player 2 the
     vertical ones (see below)
   * control device player1 and player2
     possible options are mouse1 (standard mouse), mouse2 (mouse in port2)
     joy1 (joystick in mouse port), joy2 and keyboard (cursor keys and
     space).
   * ballspeed
     set the default speed of the ball.
   * save options will save all settings to disk, including name and
     levegroup you selected in the main menu
   * exit
     will use the settings without saving them to disk
   @{b}Note@{ub}: If you have accidently saved the configs with a screenmode
   you can't display, which means that you can't start the game any more,
   simply delete the file ManiacBall.prefs in the ManiacBall directory.
 * exit
   leave the game and exit to workbench


 @{b}@{u}One- and two-player mode@{uu}@{ub}

 In @{u}one-player mode@{uu} you control up to four paddles (each at one side of the
 playfield) by moving the mouse in the appropriate direction. If you don't
 want to use the standard mouse, you can select other control devices in
 the options menu.

 In @{u}two-player mode@{uu}, the first player controls the horizontal
 paddles (the ones that move from left to right), the second player
 controls the vertical paddles. Please note that both players share one
 score board and do not have seperate lives. This is a teammode, not a
 dog-fight mode :-)

 If you are not using the mouse to control the paddles, use the firebutton
 or the spacebar to double the speed of the paddle.


 @{b}@{u}Bricks@{uu}@{ub}

 As said above, the main goal of the game is to remove all bricks from the
 playfield. Well, not really every brick because there are four kinds of
 bricks:

 * standard bricks - they appear in the colors green, red, blue, yellow and
   purple. Some of them are higher than others, you have to hit them two or
   three times to remove them completely. Others will turn into extras (see
   below) after getting hit by the ball.

 * steel bricks - there are three types of steel bricks. The big and the
   very big one can't be destroyed. But the special steel brick can (only!)
   be destroyed by an explosion

 * TNT - explodes in a 3x3 explosion when hit by a ball
   One explosions can cause other TNTs to explode (chain reaction!)

 * extras - some standard bricks turn into extras of various kinds. Before
   we get to the different kinds of extras, let me explain this: Some
   extras only effect one paddle at a time, this one is called the @{u}active@{uu}
   @{u}paddle@{uu}. The active paddle is the one that touched the ball the last time
   it bounced off a paddle. The active paddle is blue whereas the inactive
   ones are grey. Here are the 20 different extras:
   * score extras with 50, 100, 200 and 400 points
   * forcefield (green border)
     This creates a forcefield for the active paddle which lasts 10 seconds
   * small and big paddle
     decrease and increase the size of the active paddle
   * laser
     turns the active paddle into a powerfull lasercanon. Hitting a brick
     with the laser is like hitting it with a ball without the bricks
     turning into extras. Steel bricks are not affected by the laser.
   * slower and faster
     decrease and increase the speed of the ball
   * steel ball
     the ball that hits this extra changes his color to yellow and from now
     on, it will walk through every standard brick without bouncing back.
     Note that this ball destroys bricks, they won't turn into extras.
   * extra ball
     The ball that hits this extras splits into two balls.
   * extra life
   * level warp
     immediately warps you to the next stage
   * super extra (S-sign)
     this is a very special extra because randomly one of this will happen:
     * increase size of all boards
     * laser for all boards
     * forcefield for all boards
     * extra life
   * extras with a letter
     There are extras with a B, O, N, U or S on them. Collect them all to
     get the mega bonus of 3000 points.


 @{b}@{u}Keyboard control@{uu}@{ub}

 Apart from the cursor-keys and the space-bar which can be used to control
 the paddles via keybaord, these keys are active while the game is in
 progress:

 @{b}P@{ub} will Pause the game
 (Note:To turn off the pause mode, you have to activate the game window
 (simply click with your mouse into it) and then press @{b}P@{ub} again)

 @{b}ECS@{ub} you will lose all life (game over)
 @{b}Shift-ESC@{ub} you will lose one life

 At the left side is a list with all available bricks. There's the empty
 field and the three steel blocks. The standard bricks all exist in six
 variations: standard, double, tripple, standard-dark, standard-light and
 standard-border. The last item is the TNT brick.

 A complete description of all extras can be found in the chapter @{" game " Link Game}.

@NODE Editscreen "Running the Editor on its own screen"

 @{b}@{u}running the ManiacBall Leveleditor on its own screen@{uu}@{ub}

 By default, the Editor opens its windows on the Workbench. This is ok
 if your Workbench has enough colors but looks not very nice if you run
 your WB with less than 32 colors. In this case, you should open a second
 screen for ManiacBall, here's how to do it:

 1) start the @{u}Editor@{uu}, the main window apears on the Workbench

 2) click on the @{u}Prefs@{uu} button, the MUI preferences window pops up

    apears

 6) Activate this (unnamed) screen in the list, then select @{u}Edit@{uu},
    the "Edit Screen" window pops up

 7) Enter a @{u}name@{uu} for the Public Screen, for example "MBEDIT"
    Enter a @{u}title@{uu} for the Screen, for example "ManiacBall Editor"

 8) Activate the @{u}Display@{uu} group, a screenmode requester apears in
    this group

 9) Select the apropriate @{u}screenmode@{uu},
    for example DBL-PAL:High Res Laced Flickerfree      (if you have AGA)
             or CVision: 8bit 800 x 600       (if you have a CyberVision)
    Recommended: a screen with a size of at least 640x400

 10) Select the @{u}depth@{uu}.
     Recommended: at least a depth of 6 (64 colors)

 11) Leave the Edit Screen window by clicking on @{u}Ok@{uu}.

 12) Leave the PSI (Public Screen Inspector) by clicking on @{u}Save@{uu}

 13) Back to the MUI Preferences program:

@NODE Register "How to register"

 I spent a lot of work in ManiacBall so I think it's only fair to demand a
 little reward if want to use my program on a regular basis.

 After paying the shareware fee you will receive a keyfile and the latest
 version of ManiacBall. Furthermore the registered version includes:

 - you will now be able to use the @{b}Leveleditor@{ub} to create your own
   levels.

 - you will get a bunch of new @{b}levels@{ub}!


 @{b}@{u}How to register@{uu}@{ub}

 If you want to register, you can simply use the @{u}Register@{uu} button
 in the @{" Leveleditor " Link Editor}. Here you can print a registration
 form, ready to put it in the envelope or to send it via E-Mail.

 Or you can send me a short note including you full name, address (street,
 city, country) and your E-Mail address if you want to get the keyfile via
 E-Mail. I also would like to know where you got ManiacBall from (AmiNet,
 Coverdisk, ...) and what you like/dislike. Feel free to mail me any
 comments or send new levels if you are already a redistered user.

 There are four ways to pay the money:

 @{b}* Cash@{ub}:

  If you want to pay in cash, the Shareware fee is

      25 DM (DEM German-Marks) or
      20 $  (USD US-Dollars)

  other currencies can not be accepted.

  I don't think there will be any problems if you place the money in the
  envelope in a way it can't be seen from the outside. There havn't been
  any problems yet.

 @{b}* Eurocheques or money orders@{ub}:

  Send me a cheque for 25 DM, other currencies can no be accepted. Ask at
  your local bank if you don't know how to pay in foreign currencies.

  (Postal-) Money orders in @{u}DEM@{uu} (German-Marks) are also welcome.

 @{b}* Foreign cheques@{ub}

  If you live outside of Europe and can't pay in DM, send a foreign cheque
  for 25 US$ (twentyfive us-dollars) or the equivalent amount in any your
  currency. Unfortunately there's an extra fee at the bank for foreign
  cheques.

 @{b}* Bank transfer@{ub}:

  You can transfer 25 DM to my bank-account:

      Peter Elzner
      Commerzbank Letmathe
      account: 5000 104
