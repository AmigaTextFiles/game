  This version of Scorched Tanks only represents a time where I drew the
  line and decided to release something so that I could get some feedback.


INTRODUCTION:

Scorched Tanks is a tank warfare game where 2 to 4 players take turns buying
weapons and shooting them at each other.  The more damage a player causes
another, the more money they get.  The more money a player receives, the 
larger the weapons they can buy.  This is a very simple concept, but
 extreemly addictive!

Scorched Tanks is very much related to a very popular game called 
Scorched Earth on MS-Dos machines.  I've only played Scorched Earth maybe
five times ever.  But it impressed me so much that I decided that the
Amiga need a version too.  Scorched Tanks is very similar yet VERY different
to the MS-Dos game.  

'Tanks innovates where 'Earth and other look-a-likes leave off.
The gameplay and interface are so easy to use, an 8 year old can pick
it up in no time.  I tested it with a group of little kids.  They spent
two hours screaming and jumping around while they blew-up each others
computer tanks.  Basically it's simple to learn and the interface's 
layout doesn't take away from the game.

GAMEPLAY:

 Buying weapons-
 
  WeaponsLink is how each player buys and sells weapons, shields, and
  other items of use.  Choose the desired item and select buy or
  sell.

  Select DONE to go to the next player.


 Playfield-

  Each player must fire at the other tanks until there is only one
  tank left.  Destroying a tank earns a player $5000.  the winner
  of the round receives $5000.  Second $2500.  Third $1250.  Forth $625.

  
  Before Fireing weapons, remember to set angle, power, and desired 
  weapon before clicking FIRE.

  Other options available during a players turn are:

  Scanner- Click in scanner window to adjust view screen or to checkout
           currently off screen areas of the playfield.

  Stats-   Click on a players name to read individual stats of the player.
           SH-Shields(0 to 99)  DA-Damage(0 to 50)
           when hit, player first loses shields, then receives damage.
           If damage drops to zero, player is removed so to say.


 End of round-

  At the end of round, Bonuses are awarded and ranking for the game is
  given.  At the end of the last round the winner of the game will be
  announced and the game will end.


Good-Luck and have fun beating on your friends!
