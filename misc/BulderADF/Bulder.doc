Instructions

    Bulder is a BoulderDash (a C64 Game) clone, so your task is to collect
diamonds and reach the end-of-level door. The screen is divided into two
sections; in the middle is the playing area and in the right side of the
screen is the status area. Your points are shown in title bar, and your
remaining time is shown under the 'Time' -text. Currently collected
diamonds are shown below the diamond and the number of diamonds to
complete a level is shown under the '--->' -text. The number of your lives
is shown under the standing man, below that there is your 'special' item
(which might be ie. a bullet) and how many 'special' items do you have left.
Lastly there is a 'S:' and a ON or OF text which indicates whether you have
sound on or off.
    You can move your man (in the middle of the screen) with joystick or
arrow-keys. Pushing joy-button (or shift/alt keys) you can shoot to
or collect diamond/dig sand from selected direction.
    If you have special items left and there is space in your selected
direction then it will use the special item to that direction (ie. shoot a
bullet). If you don't have any special items left or there is no space in
your selected direction it will collect diamond or sand from that direction
(if there are any).

Here are some objects explained:

Stones
    Stones can be pushed by running on it, but it has to have
    space behind it.

Diamonds
    Diamonds are the items you should collect to open the end-level door.

Bugs
    Bugs can kill you if they touch you. You can kill them by dropping a
    stone or diamond over it, by shooting them, or you can lead them to
    slime. Some bugs leaves behind diamonds when they explodes.

Slime
    Slime expands to everywhere it can for a specific time and if it
    hasn't being stopped it will turn to stones, if it's stopped it
    will turn to diamonds. It expands over sand and empty space.

There are a lot more objects in the game...
