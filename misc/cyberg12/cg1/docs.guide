V1.0  End of March 1995
-----------------------

We released Cybergames on Aminet and on our Ftp site,
and started to spread it on different BBS's.
We also sent copies to major computer magazines and
PD distributors in England.



V1.01, May 1995
---------------

Of course there had to be problems (Aren't there always?!)
In the hurry to get v1.0 spread, we forgot to include a
text in the Aminet version of how to install the game.
This version included that text. Everything was slowed
down considerably by the fact that we didn't have any
access to Aminet ourselves.



V1.2, October 29th 1995  
-----------------------

-New joystick routine!
-New two player mode!
-Complete version of the game with all the 35 levels on
 three disks. Game Over/You Win included etc etc etc
 (Also included: some things to make you register ;)
-You can see ALL the things in the shop instead of only
 the ones that you can afford!
-Restore-energy object to fall down from the sky!
-More difficult to beat the opponents. Many complained
 that we had made it far to easy.
-"Please insert savedisk" has been changed to
 "Insert savedisk or press ESC"!
-Some minor bugs (Which I'm too embarased to mention)
 has been removed.
-Instructions written for AmigaGuide or Multiview.
-Foolproof (?) Installer scripts written for Amiga
 installer program.



We would like to know what YOU think about this game!
It's better that we get some negative feedback instad of
no feedback at all.
We also would like you to register so that we feel it
was worth while making this game.

New versions of the game will be uploaded to Aminet
and can be found there, on their CD's or on:

Some fun things to know about the game:

The nextopponent characters were digitized using a DCTV
(Pal) from Digital Creations. The people are all modified
versions of Bjorn, Johan and Bjorn's father Kaj.

In the introscroll it says "Moral support by Natacha"
Natacha was a girl that Johan knew back in 1992-93
when we wrote the scrollroutine.

Bjorn now has a red belt in WTF TaeKwonDo.
Think about that before you comment on the game ;)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 What is Cyberpunk Developments?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CPD is a Swedish team. It consists of Bjorn Fogelberg (26)
and Johan Lundin (26). CPD was formed in 1991 when we were
unemployed and had lots of time for making things on
our computers. Before that we were original members
of XAKK, a well known demogroup on the Commodore 64 in
1986-1990. Bjorn was called Knatter and Johan was called
Black Adder.

We started working on Cybergames in December 1991 and
had a preview finished about 6 months later. We both
loved the old game Barbarian and wanted to make something
better with the idea. We managed to find a distributing
company from England which would do all the marketing
and selling of the game. Before the contracts was signed,
they backed as we didn't accept a lousy agreement.
Then the work on the game was down for a long time as
we had lost faith in the whole thing.
One day we were contacted by a new company which we recived
a very good contract from. However things didn't work out
well for the (Swedish) company and they went bankrupt
a couple of months after the Amiga crash in 1994.

After a lot of dispair, quitting and then continuing on
the work of Cybergames, we finally released it as
shareware in March 1995. We figured it was better that
YOU would get a chance to play what we had been working
on for so long, than just putting it aside to forget.

It went pretty well. Some guys loved the game, (like Amiga
Format :) ,and some guys just hated it (like Amiga Power :(
Anyway I don't regret that we released it. It would probably
haunt me forever if we hadn't.

                         ......

CPD also does a lot of professional Midi music. We have a
lot of synths, samplers and guitars on which we create
our tunes. Currently we are into Techno, ambient, trance
and hardcore rave-techno but we can do all kinds of music.
We will (hopefully) release our first CD in a matter of
months. It has been recorded in a professional digital
studio and will contain four pieces of music.
We also do a lot of animations with Imagine and Real 3D
which we use together with our music on gigs and for
videos that we create.

CPD uses the following equipment:

Amiga 500+ with VXL-30 (68030/50Mhz/MMU,68882/25Mhz,2meg 32bit fast)
2 meg chip, 4 meg 16bit fast (= A total of 8 meg)
Supradrive 500XP with 365 meg Quantum HD
DCTV with RGB converter
Goliath powersupply (14 A)
UsRobotics Courier HST 14400
Homemade 8 bit sampler

Two Roland D110
Roland U220
Two Yamaha DX100
Casio CZ-101
Casio FZ-1
Roland system-100 (model-101,102,104)
Alesis 16 channel mixer
12 channel mixer for live performances
VestaFire MR-10 portastudio

Boss guitar effects
Various effects and reverbs
Electric guitar
Two acoustic guitars

# What do I need to be able to run CYBERGAMES

        What do I need to run this great game?
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/



Cybergames was designed to run on ALL Amigas.
It has been tested with various hardware
and SHOULD work on ALL Amigas from WB 1.2 and
upwards including AGA, ECS and whathaveyou...
However, since I have a crappy job and can't afford
to buy better hardware and actually don't
have any friends left with Amigas to test the
game on, I really don't know...

Cybergames needs 1 meg of memory to run. You can
run it if you have 512 k chip and 512 k fast.

Even as it was designed for PAL computers, it will
work fine on NTSC as well, since there is a built
in feature which handles that.

If it DOESN'T work on your system, please let me
know by sending me a postcard or E-mail. Please try
to be specific to what exactly happened and what
kind of computer you have.

#INSTALLATION

''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
             Installation of Cybergames
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/



There are two different installation scripts for
Cybergames. The scripts were written to be used with
the Commodore installer program.


ANYONE should be able to install Cybergames even if
he doesn't know much about his computer.
I went through the tiresome process of learning the
LISP lookalike code to write those scripts and
writing something that actually would work.
It's not perfect, but it's working and it's very easy
to use...


Cybergames can be installed on either three diskettes
or on hard-disk. The game needs to be installed before
it can be run since it uses some Commodore files and
must be properly assigned if on hard-disk.

If you are using a computer with Workbench 1.2 or 1.3
(I think), Cybergames will need

ram-handler
ramdrive.device

The disk-installed Cybergames on WB 1.2 and 1.3 will
need

run
runback
endcli.

If you are using WB 2.04 or higher, you won't need
any of the above, except runback if you are going
to install the game on disk when you don't have
much memory.

Actually runback is used so that I can close the
cli/shell window from which Cybergames is loaded
and started. This way some amount of memory is spared
for you poor dudes who still is sitting with 1 meg
machines. Cybergames will of course work without
beeing started with runback if you have enough memory,
that is. If you don't have runback you can always
change it to 'run' in the Cybergames1:s/startup-sequence
with any simple texteditor.



Here's a complete explanation of what the installement
scripts will do:

For disk
--------

-Formats four empty disks and names them:
 Cybergames1 Cybergames2 Cybergames3 and
 Cybergames_savedisk

-Makes an install on Cybergames1 so that you can
 boot from that diskette.

-Copies all files and dirs from cg1 to the disk named
 Cybergames1

-Copies all files from cg2 to the disk named Cybergames2

-Copies all files from cg3 to the disk named Cybergames3

(On machines with WB 1.2 and WB 1.3)

-Looks for run, runback and endcli in your sys:c
 directory and copies them to the c directory on the
 disk named Cybergames1

-Looks for ramdrive.device in your sys:devs directory
 and copies it to the devs directory on the disk
 named Cybergames1

-Looks for ram-handler in your sys:l directory and
 copies it to the l directory on the disk named
 Cybergames1


(On machines with WB 2.04 or higher)

-Looks for runback in your sys:c directory and copies
 if to the c directory on the disk named Cybergames1




For Hard-disk
-------------

-Copies all files from cg1 cg2 and cg2 to one directory
 on your hard-disk.

-Configurates your startup-sequence with four assigns
 to the new location on the hard-disk.

We have put a lot of time and effort in the making
of this game and we hope that you will enjoy playing it.

The object of Cybergames is to get pleasure out of
bashing in the head of your opponent. :)
If you don't like headbashing... well, DON'T PLAY

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/



FIRST OF ALL: INSTALL THE GAME!
Then read on:


Before you run the game,
make sure that you have turned off any program you might
have running in the background.


Start the game.

Now the game will load and you will soon see and hear the
first intro which presents the programmers and some fancy
graphics. When the intro is finished, the main intro will
be loaded.

Before the main intro starts, there will be a requester
which asks you if you want to load your own highscores or
use the default. To use your own hiscores, insert the
disk named Cybergames_savedisk (in any drive, of course)
if you are running from disk.
Otherwise Cybergames_savedisk is assigned to your Cybergames
library.
If there are any hiscores, they will be loaded and used in
the game.
If you want to use the default highscores, just press the
ESC button on the keyboard to continue.


SECOND INTRO

When you are in the second intro, press fire to leave the
credits scroll. Now use the joystick to choose one or two
players, difficulty level, game over on/off and which
background to play if two players have been chosen. Move
to BATTLE and press fire to load the game.

           Cybergames main instructions
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/


You control your man with your joystick. There is a
scaffolding in every arena. This is to be used for climbing.
You jump up on it by standing right- or leftmost of the
screen (On the white plates) and pulling the joystick upwards.
If you hang still for a while, you will get tired and will
be falling down again. If you climb over you opponent and
land on the other side of him, the players will automatically
turn around so that they face each other again. Then your
joystick movements will be reversed.

The energy level for each player is shown in the top of the
screen. Player one to the left and player two to the right.
The less energy you have, the more will be shown of the word
DEAD. When it is filled, you are... Right...DEAD!!! Also in
this areais the three things that you can throw at each other.


One Player

Here you will face different opponents ranging in skills from
mediocre to very tough to beat. There are 35 opponents and six
locations. Since this is a fighting game, the object obviously
is to smash the other guy. You can either beat him with your
weapon until he has lost all of his energy, or you can make it
short by separating his head from the body (A Swedish shaving).
You will get credits for every successful hit, and those credits
can be used later for upgrading your body armour and weapons.
The more difficult a hit, the more credits you will get for it.
You won't get much credits by decapitating your opponent at once
(But you WILL get a time-bonus).

You can carry three weapons that you can throw on your opponent.
Those are for example a knife, laser, pot of acid, a blob, etc.
Press SPACE to choose which one you wish to throw. When you have
no more left to throw, you will SPIT at the opponent instead.
(Must try this out, it's great fun!!!)

When you have won one match, you will see how many credits you
have collected. Then you can choose to either spend some of it on
improvements by entering the cybershop, or build a pile for later
and kick some a** instead. The upper limit for credits is 99999.

You will get an extralife every 50000 points if in thelamer-mode,
every 75000 in normal-mode and every 100000 in the cyber-mode.


The cybershop

This is where you can buy new weapons, things to throw and
improve your armour. As mentioned before, you can save your
credits a couple of rounds, to be able to buy something expensive
later on. Use the joystick to move around the cursor. The big
squares contains the weapons and armour that you can buy. The
small squares contains the things that you can throw. If you
press fire one time, some info will be shown about the item.
If you press fire one more time then you will buy that item.
(If you can afford it). You can only buy one weapon at a time
and hold a maximum of 3 things to throw. If you are holding one
thing when entering, you may only buy two things and so on.
A good thing to buy is more ENERGY, because your energy level
will NOT recharge after a fight.


Two players

Use two joysticks and you can play against each other. A fight
lasts until one player is dead. You can play as many times as
you want and the wins will be displayed in the middle of the top
display. Player two uses either Return or Enter to choose which
item he wishes to throw. Two player mode now works like one
player mode. After a fight, each player can enter the shop to
buy new things.



Ingame keys

P            Will pause the game. Great for review snapshots.
             Press P to unpause.
Esc          End game and go back to the intro
F1-F4        Speed of the game. If you are playing on a faster
             computer than the basic Old 68000 Amiga, you can
             speed it up a bit. F1 is slow, F4 is faaaaast!!
Space        Player one choose which item to throw.

       Wow, I have a NTSC Amiga and can actually

Cybergames was written for the European market,
that means for PAL computers.
(EUROPE! EUROPE! EUROPE!) ;)))


Where PAL has 255 lines,
NTSC only has 200, making the last 55 pixels of the game
not visible for our American friends (And anyone else who
runs on NTSC). However, we have thrown in some quick
things to make it possible to enjoy "Cybergames" in the
States. The game automatically checks if it's running
on a NTSC computer. If that is the case, it will move
up the screens a bit so that you can see the players and
other things which would have been hidden otherwise.
If you don't like my presets, you can change it yourself
by doing like this:

When the game is starting and the players are walking in,
press "P" to pause it. Now scroll the screen up- or
downwards with the up and downkeys on your keyboard. When
you're finished, press "P" again to leave the pause mode.
You can also do the same in the cybershop to move around
the computerdisplay. The next opponent screen will adjust
itself to the main playing screen, so that you hopefully
will see what you need to see...
