                          Version 1.4

	Tetron is a sort-of clone of the classic game T*tr*s. I first
played this game on the Mac (whoops, didn't mean to swear). It was
absolutely fabulous. Hours of potential study time went out the window. The
DA version that came with it was great too. When I bought myself an Amiga,
T*tr*s was one of the first games I looked for. But it was no good! The
gameplay was all shot, and it was a tedious conversion. When I upgraded to
Kickstart 2.xx and got a VXL-30 board, it wouldn't work!! It was a frantic
search then for something in the PD/Shareware area. Arghhhh again! Nothing
was good enough. All were either too slow, couldn't slide pieces, rotated
on the wrong axis, or were unstable. The list went on. But there were a few
pieces of software that shone through, included the great Tetrix with its
two-player option. Twintris was good as well.
	But something still lacked. Mainly compatibility and gameplay. So I
wrote Tetron. The basic game was finished in a few days, but then options
started appearing. More and more appeared. Soon I was innundated with
things to include. Add an option here, and option there. I hope you like
this game, as I have tried to keep the nice feel of a fast moving game.
	If you play this game, please register. It is the only way the
extra options will be released. A $10 registration is all I ask.

@node one_player "One Player"
Standard T*tr*s clone. The aim is to get rows of blocks and to keep going
as long as you can. The falling blocks can be rotated as they fall,
allowing you to place them as you wish. If you get a complete row, it will
disappear and all that is above it will fall down.
@endnode

@node one_player_lc "One Player Level Challenge"
Here you are given levels which have already got blocks in them. Your aim
is to clear out the level of these blocks. The levels do get hard, and can
take ages! There are 10 levels to get through.
@endnode

@node two_player "Two Player"
Play against an opponent on the same screen. Who will get the highest score?
Check the control docs to see what keys you have to use.
@endnode

@node custom_one_player "Custom One Player Level Challenge"
Play levels that have been designed with the Tetron level editor.
@endnode

              @{" Fast Drop       " link fast_drop}
@endnode

@node next_piece "Show Next Piece"
Get a sneak preview of what the next piece will be. Can be very handy when
planning a level.
@endnode

@node score "Show Score"
Too embarrassed to show your score to anyone watching? Try turning this
option off then.
@endnode

@node blocked_blocks "Blocked Blocks"
Have the pieces look like they are made up of individual squares. Some
people actually prefer this 8^)
@endnode

@node psychodelia "Psychodelia"
Had a hard night drinking? Try this to relieve your brain. I take no
responsibility for damage to keyboard by vomit. This option cycles the
colours.
@endnode

@node background "Background"
Took this out for the moment. Register and I might put it back in.
@endnode

@node stats "Statistics"
For one player mode. Brings up a window while playing to tell you how many
pieces of what kind have fallen, and the total fallen.
@endnode

@node two_joys "Two Joysticks"
When playing in two-player mode, selecting this will make the joysticks
control piece movement. Keyboard will not work.
@endnode

@node sound "Sound"
Does the sound annoy you? Want to play mods in the background? Turn this
option off then. NOTE: If you do play something in the background, the sound
in the program will not come on again (strange AMOS).
@endnode

@node less_cpu "Less CPU"
This will make the program multi-tasking friendly during play. But BEWARE, 
this can severely affect game play on later levels. Only POWER USERS should
select this. 68000 users should probably not use this.
@endnode

@node fast_drop "Fast Drop"
This makes the piece fall straight down to the bottom instead of moving it
down one square.
@endnode

@node level_editor "Level Editor..."
Now you can design your own challenge levels! The gadgets down the left
side of the screen are for the ten levels. Click on the gadget of the level
which you wish to change. In the middle of the screen is the drawing area.
Just click on a spot to place a piece there, and click again to remove it.
On the right hand side of the screen you have the option of saving the
challenge levels (all ten). But you must have a filename in the text gadget
at the bottom of the screen, otherwise the levels will not be saved. You
are also able to clear the current levels of blocks, or clear all the 10
levels of blocks. Exit will return you to the options screen.
To use your levels, you must select 'Custom 1P Level Challenge'.
To load a custom challenge into Tetron, you must do it through the options
screen. To do this enter the name of the file into the text gadget 'Custom
Challenge' and click the gadget 'Custom 1P Level Challenge' even if it is
already selected.
@endnode

@node gadgets "Gadgets"
Near the bottom of the options screen you will see the following gadgets.
                 @{" Save Configuration " link save_config}
                 @{" Edit Keys          " link edit_keys}

                 @{" OK                 " link ok}
@endnode

@node save_config "Save Configuration"
Saves the current setup. Next time Tetron loads it will look for this file
and use it if found. The file will be saved as 'Tetron.config'. You can 
delete this file to get rid of you changes, or click 'Default' gadget to
get back original settings.
Your key settings will be saveds with this.
@endnode

@node edit_keys "Edit Keys"
Can change the keyboard movement keys for one player games. You cannot use
the 'esc' or 'p' keys as they are reserved for quit and pausing a game. To
save these keys with your Tetron copy, press the Save Configuration gadget.
To get back original settings, press Default gadget.
@endnode

@node clear_scores "Clear High Scores"
Allows you to set the keyboard delay. If the pieces are moving too fast,
put a higher number into the gadgets. The number is the number of vertical
blanks before you can move the piece again. The maximum is 40. Default
gadget will bring the original values back. Note that these key rates are
not saved with you configuration.
@endnode

@node advanced_options "Advanced Options"
Removes all the high scores. Now you can get a high score!
@endnode

@node default "Default"
Returns all the options to the in-built defaults. Can be useful if you want
to get back to the standard settings.
@endnode

@node ok "OK"
Exits options. Extremely useful if you want to play the game.

@endnode

@node about_program "About Program"
The program has taken quite a bit of my time to write so far. I expect it
will take even longer when I put the other options in. So far the AMOS
program is about 6500 lines of code. I should fix a lot of it up, and I
eventually will. Pity AMOS Professional doesn't seem to have AGA chip
support. Strange, wouldn't you say? How will it go on A4000s and A1200s?
@endnode

@node future "Future versions..."
These features (when completed) will only be released if people actually
register their copy (apart from those who beta tested it - they get all the
updates). So please register if you want the new versions up and about as
soon as they are released.

-Piece editor
-Serial games

NOTE: These options WILL be written! (eventually as Manuel says) It just
requires a few people to register for them to be released into Shareware.
