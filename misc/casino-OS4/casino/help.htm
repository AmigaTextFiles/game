<h2>Rules</h2>
  The goal of the game is to obtain more points.<p>
  The game goes as follows:<p>

Each player gets 3-3 cards, and on the desk there are 4 cards.<p>
Each card has a given value: Ace = 1 , 2..10 = 2..10, J = 11, Q = 12 and K = 13.<p>
The player, in it's turn, can drop a card, or get some cards from the desk.
<p>
With a card, or a group of cards with a total value less then or equal to 13,
he can get a card, or a collection of cards, with the total value
equal to the value of his card. If there are more cards, or groups on the desk
with that value, he can get all the cards.
<p>
Ex.:
Desk:<br>
<img src="cards/default/16.gif" width=72 height=96 border=0>
<img src="cards/default/2.gif" width=72 height=96 border=0>
<img src="cards/default/19.gif" width=72 height=96 border=0>
<img src="cards/default/11.gif" width=72 height=96 border=0>
<p>
Hand:<br>
<img src="cards/default/15.gif" width=72 height=96 border=0>
<img src="cards/default/23.gif" width=72 height=96 border=0>
<img src="cards/default/46.gif" width=72 height=96 border=0>
<p>
With the J, he can get the J, or the A and 10, or all of them.<br>
With the 9 and 3 he can get the Q.
<p>
There is only one exception: if this "transaction" can be done in more steps,
he has to do it in more steps.
<p>
When there are no more cards in the players hand, they get again 3-3 cards.
When the deck is finished, the "last active" player (ie. the player who got cards from
the desk last time) gets all the remaining cards from the desk.
<p>
When a player gets all the cards from the desk, he gets an extra point.
The player also gets:
<ul>
<li>1 point for each Ace
<li>1 point for the spades 2
<li>2 points for the diamond 10
<li>2 points if he gets more then half of the cards (>=27)
<li>1 point if he gets more then half of the spades (>=7)
</ul>
<p>
<h2>The program</h2>
To use the program is very simple:<p>
In the upper part of the window there are four buttons:
<ul>
<li>New game - resets the scores and starts a new game
<li>Hint - the computer gives you a hint
<li>Help - the documentation (what you are reading now)
<li>Exit - quits the game (the boss is comming)
</ul>
Mine cards in the upper part of the window, yours in the bottom part, and
the desk is in the middle.<p>
In the right side are the scores, and the buttons: "Get" and "Drop".
To drop or get cards, just select them, and click the corresponding buttons.<p>
At the bottom of the window is the status line, which shows you:
<ul>
<li>How many special cards I've got,
<li>How much cards are left in the deck,
<li>How many special cards you've got.
</ul>
