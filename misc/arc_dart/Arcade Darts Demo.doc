About Arcade Darts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Arcade  Darts  is  for  anyone who occasionally fancies a game of darts but
can't  find  either a dartboard or someone to play with !  With a selection
of  different  games  to  play,  a  range of computer opponents and sampled
speech  too,  it  could  turn  you  into a darts master without the need to
develop a beer belly!


Installing onto a Hard Disk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If  you  have  enough  memory  available you can run Arcade Darts from hard
disk.

Firstly, create a drawer on your hard disk called Arcade Darts.

Then copy all of the files from the disk, into the new drawer, with the
exception of...

c (dir)
Fonts (dir) - However, you must copy the ADScore.font and ADOptions.font
              and ADScore and ADOptions directories into the fonts directory
              on your hard disk
libs (dir)
s (dir)
Disk.info
system-configuration

Finally, if you wish to read the doc file from the hard disk, you will need
to edit the path name in the doc .info file. Simply amend it so that it
corresponds to wherever your text reader (eg. More) is located on your hard
disk.


Loading Arcade Darts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Arcade Darts will run on any Amiga with at least 1 Mb of chip memory
(graphics memory) and a PAL display. However, the sampled speech option
requires at least 1.5 Mb.

If you only have 1 Mb of chip memory you will need to disable any hard disk
and external drives, to free enough memory for the game to run properly.

To load the game, simply double click on the Arcade Darts icon. Once loaded,
there will be a short delay while the program de-crunches.

If you have enough chip memory available, the speech samples will be loaded
automatically and the speech option will be selected on the options screen.

Playing Arcade Darts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After selecting Start Game from the options screen, a list of players
taking part in the game is displayed. Pressing the mouse button will take
you onto the game screen.

On the right hand side of the game screen is the scoreboard where the
players names and scores are displayed. The player whose turn it is
currently, is highlighted in white.

Below the scoreboard is a small window which indicates where the last
dart landed and below this is the Power/Throw indicator.

The main display is on the left and it shows the board and player's hand
and dart.

The player's hand is controlled with the mouse, although the player only
has a certain amount of influence over its movement. The hand will drift
around the board and it will take some practice to gain any real measure
of control.

The dart is thrown by pressing and holding down the left mouse button.
The length of time the button is held down will determine the strength
with which the dart is thrown. This Power is displayed on the indicator
below the scoreboard. Once released the Throw bar on the indicator will
start to move and a further press on the mouse will determine the
release point, and thus the flight of the dart. Too soon and the dart
will veer off to the left, too late and it will swerve to the right.
Stopping the Throw bar level with the light blue line will give a straight
throw.

With practice you will be able to compensate for any small lack of accuracy
of aiming, by using more or less power, and adjusting the release of the
dart, to cause the dart to fly to the left or right.

Remember, the sequence for each throw is...
                  Aim - Press and hold - Release - Press

The score for each dart is displayed below the scoreboard. Any dart landing
off the board, or bouncing out after hitting a wire or another dart will be
shown as ****.

At any time during play the current game may be quit by pressing Esc.

When the game is finished a press of the mouse button will return you
to the options screen, unless a challenge game is being played, in which
case your current score will be shown before your game continues.

If, at the end of a challenge game, a high score/best time has been
achieved the player will be asked to input their name and the new table
will displayed. The computer will then attempt to save the updated
high-scores onto your disk.

If your disk is write-protected a requester will appear, allowing you to
write-enable the disk and retry, or cancel the save. You are recommended to
leave your disk write-enabled to allow this data to be continually updated.

During play the board will become marked by the darts just like a real
dartboard does. But of course, each time you load the game, you will start
with a completely new board again.


Game Rules
~~~~~~~~~~

301/501
~~~~~~~
This is the standard game played on dartboards everywhere.

Each player starts with 301 or 501, depending upon the version being
played. They each have a turn at the board and their score is reduced
by the total of their three darts.

The game is won by the player who finally reduces their score to zero
by hitting a double of any number or the bullseye.

If the score is reduced to less than zero by the dart or darts a player
has thrown then their score reverts to what it was before the current
turn, and any darts remaining for this turn are forfeited. When this
happens the player is said to have 'Bust'.

A variation is that each player must start by hitting a double in
addition to finishing on one. None of a player's darts will count until
a double is achieved.

Mickey Mouse
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This game is also called 'Tactics', and for good reason.

For this game only the numbers 10-20 are used along with the bull.

Players throw at these numbers. Each hit earns a cross against that
number. Doubles count as two hits and trebles as three. The inner bull
counts as two hits on the bull with the outer bull counting as only one
hit.

When three hits have been achieved on a number the player is able to
score on it. Any further hits on it resulting in the normal value of
the dart counting towards the player's score.

However, once both players have acquired three hits on the same number
it is wiped off the board and takes no further part in the game.

The player with the highest score at the end of the game is the winner.
The game ending when the player with the lower total has no numbers left
on which to score.

Shove Ha'penny
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As the name suggests this game is based upon the old English game of
'Shove Ha'penny'.

Each player endeavours to score three hits on each of the numbers 1-9,
in any order. Doubles count as two hits and trebles as three.

The first player to complete their side of the board by scoring three
hits on all of the numbers wins.

However, should a player score more than three hits on any number, the
extra hits are scored to their opponent. Though they cannot be used to
complete the opponents side of the board to win the game.

Round the Board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is another well known dart game which is played far and wide and
often used by darts players as a method of practice.

Each player starts at 1 and has to hit each number in ascending order,
ending with an outer and inner bull.

The first player to go 'Round the Board' and hit the outer and inner bull
is the winner.

Variations have the players needing to score doubles, or trebles of the
numbers instead of singles.

Killer
~~~~~~
This is a game played by a group of players and as the name suggests the
aim is to 'kill' or eliminate all of the other players in the game.

Each player starts by throwing with their 'wrong' hand until everyone
has hit their own individual number. (In Arcade Darts these numbers are
automatically chosen at random). Each player's number is then marked next
to their name on the scoreboard.

The game proper now commences with players in turn trying to hit the
double of their own number. When they do so they become a 'killer' and
this is represented by a 'K' next to their name on the scoreboard.

Once a player is a 'killer' they may go for any of the other players'
doubles. Whenever one of these is hit that player loses a life.

If a 'killer' hits their own double then they lose one of their own lives.

When a player loses all of their lives they are out of the game. The last
player left in the game being the winner.

A variation is that 'killers' can only 'kill' 'non-killers' until all
players have become 'killers'. This makes for an even more vicious game.

Shanghai
~~~~~~~~
This game for a group of players is unusual in that it includes a special
shot which is named after the game itself.

The game starts with each player throwing for the number 1, scoring
normal value for their three darts.

They repeat the process for each of the numbers 2,3,4,5,6 & 7.

The player with the highest total at the end wins.

There is, however, the special shot known as 'Shanghai' which will win
the game automatically. It occurs when a player hits a single, double and
treble of the current number. When this happens the remaining players
still have their throws at the number and if any of them can score a
'Shanghai' too then the game continues as normal.

A variation has players automatically being eliminated from the game if
they fail to score when throwing at the numbers 3,5 & 7.

~~~~~~~~~~
There are three game types available in Arcade Darts:-

Single Game - One off game for 1 or more human players

            16 computer opponents and set a new high-score.

8 lower ranking computer players.


Hints and Tips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Try to control the hand using small movements of the mouse.

As soon as you press the mouse button to make a throw, concentrate on the
Power/Throw indicator, and ignore the hand and dart altogether.

In challenge games there are bonus points awarded for the margin of
victory and the number of darts used. These bonuses can boost your score
significantly.

Think about the tactics necessary for the game you're playing. For example
when playing 301/501 try to leave yourself a good double to finish on.
Double 16 is one of the best as hitting a single will leave you double 8,
then double 4 and so on.
