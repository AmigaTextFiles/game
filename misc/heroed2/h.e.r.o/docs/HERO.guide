Hello H.E.R.O. Helpers!! (H.H.H. for short!!)

Something is going to happen. A big interactive event is going to take place.
This guide will tell you all about it. We are about to release a game
which we had to miss for a long time now (too long if you ask me!) Coming soon
is an Amiga version of the old Activision game @{"H.E.R.O." LINK "HERO stuff?"} And that's not all.
You can be a part of its release. "How! How!" you ask. Here's how:

In the archive you will find a level-editor and an enemy-editor to make levels
for our game. You can make levels with the map editor and add the enemies later
on. If you choose to do so, you will be given the change to actually play these
levels in an actual H.E.R.O. game.

Now here's the deal:
If you choose to make levels, and they're fun to play, you can pass them on to
us, and we'll implement them in the game! Or we'll keep them to use them in a
future H.E.R.O.-deluxe release (or something like that)...

The finished H.E.R.O. game can be registered and you will recieve a complete
version. Hopefully an AGA version will be an option featuring fully
rendered graphics and enhanced sounds and stuff....

For full details on how to contact us, read the section @{"How to send levels" LINK "Send levels"}.

@NODE "HERO stuff?" "'Sorry man, I was born after 1984!!'  :)"
@TOC "MAIN"

                   -- What's all this H.E.R.O. stuff ?? --

It's all about a game made by Activision way back in 1983. It first appeared
on the Atari 2600 VCS. Yuk! Monochrome and with beeps. But this changed in
1984. H.E.R.O. was released on the C64 (yes. yer olde C64!) And it was an instant
classic! We loved it. It got a re-release in 1988 and still it was excellent.

It's all about this guy (a H.E.R.O. actually) who has to resque these miners from
a series of caves linked together. He only has a few bombs and a little laser
in his helmet to kill the bugs and spiders living in the mines. With the bombs
he can blow away any obstacles in his path. After resqueing the miner our H.E.R.O.
moves on to the next, more difficult level. Well difficult. Just a bit. In
fact, the game was a bit to easy. And that's what's great about this new Amiga
version. You can all contribute to the game. Make cool levels and your level
will be used. Read the section @{"Introduction" LINK "Introduction"} to get some info.

Anyway, for this version I've used the C64 grafix for that good-old-time-feeling.
EVO took special care programming the joystick-routine to make sure you'll feel
right at home. Some extra music has been added by Soft Ice to make it a bit nice
to listen to. (Wheh! We needed that!) And what a fun tune it is!!!

Well, we hope you'll enjoy the preview provided in this @{"archive" LINK "The archive"}. You can't
actually kill stuff and blow things up, but that's all been taken care of as
you read this. This version only has to show you how things will look when
everything's finished...

@NODE "The archive" "This is what you should have..."
@TOC "MAIN"

                         -- What's in the archive? --

In this archive you will find these programs: A @{"Map-editor" LINK "Map editor"}, @{"Enemy-editor" LINK "Enemy editor"},
Level-tester, some sample levels, some data-files, and a preview of the game!

You design the level with the Map-editor and connect the screens and put in
enemies with the Enemy-editor.

The Level-tester is provided so you can see how your level handles while
playing H.E.R.O. You can make some alterations and fine-tune your level after
you've seen and played it.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "Rules" "And you stick with them..."
@TOC "MAIN"

       -- The Rules -- (Can't live with them, can't live without them)

Make some cool levels and your level WILL be used. There are some rules though.

1> Don't make the level too long. It's boring, and it's not nessesary to
make long levels. Just make what you have amusing and fun to play. Some simple
obstacles can make a level real fun. Just check out the demo levels provided
to see what I mean.

2> Make sure all screens interact. Which means that exits and entrances MUST
be properly placed!! Fail to do so and we'll not use the level...

That's it really. Can't think of anything else. Just use your imagination and
everything will be ok.... 
@ENDNODE

@NODE "Send levels" "How to contact us"
@TOC "MAIN"

                           -- How to send levels --

There are 3 ways to get the levels to us:

1> You can actually give the levels to us on the major computer-event of the
year: SiH '95. There we will test them in real-time (yes!) and make the
decision if we'll use it or not. Read @{"the rules" LINK "Rules"} section to make sure we'll
not have any arguements while we're trying to have a good time. You can reach
us on the first 2 days of the event (8/9-7-'95)

2> Can't make it to SiH?? No problemo. You can upload levels to me by using the
Netmail area's on NLA, AMY or FIDO. Just LhA the level and UUencode it. Then
send it to me using the adress below.

My NetMail adresses: :)

      `' `--+-'

3> Upload the level on @{"TnT" LINK "Adv Tnt"} +31(0)515-430201/420758) where we'll DL it for
inspection. Make REAL sure @{"the rules" LINK "Rules"} are followed. There's a special area
where you can upload your levels....

                    What more could you possibly want. :)

@NODE "Map editor" "Get a layout!"
@TOC "MAIN"

                        -- Keys used in Map-editor --

SHIFT M: load a map. (made in Map-editor)
SHIFT S: save a map.
SPACE  : switch between map screen and block screen. Select your blocks on the
         block screen.
+/-    : next/previous screen.
b      : copy current screen into buffer
SHIFT B: copy buffer into current screen
CTRL c : quit Map-editor.

That's it really. Ain't nothing to it. Make sure the entrances and exits are
placed properly and ALWAYS make it possible for our H.E.R.O. to clear the
screen.

Please note that walls, lights and rafts are also enemies which you can edit in
@{"Enemy-editor" LINK "Enemy editor"}.

Map-editor wil ALWAYS save screen 0-99. Don't worry if your level has less
screens, it will be taken care of in the @{"Enemy-editor" LINK "Enemy editor"}.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "Enemy editor" "Get them baddies going"
@TOC "MAIN"

                       -- Keys used in Enemy-editor --

SHIFT M: load a map. (made in @{"Map-editor" LINK "Map editor"})
SHIFT L: load a level. (saved from Enemy-editor)
SHIFT S: save a level. Make sure your current screen is the LAST screen in
         your level. Enemy-editor wil save screen 0 - current screen.
+/-    : next/previous screen.
CTRL c : quit Enemy-editor.
</>    : next/previous enemy. Enemies are limited to 4 per screen. Don't
         worry, this is sufficient for H.E.R.O.. 
c      : clear current enemy from the screen.
1-0,q,e: select enemy
w      : water on/off (for bottom screens)
t      : test the animation. Press t several times for different enemy-speeds.
         Press any other key to stop.

How to define paths for the raft and the octopus:
First, select the raft or octopus. Then click on the left-most postition and
the select the right-most position. That's it!!! Press 't' to check the path.

Now comes the tricky bit. Connecting screens. All screens are made
in a specific order by you. To make sure they connect check exits and
entrances and connect them using the CRSR-keys.	Levels are placed behind each
other and here's how to connect them.

Say you had an entrance at the north side and your exit is at the west side.
OK? Check out the compass at the bottom of the screen and use the CRSR-keys to
make N -1 and W 1. Why? Well, if you moved North again (Up) you would go back
1 screen in the chain of screens. If you move West you'll move forward 1
screen in our chain. In the next screen East should be -1 and the exit's value
should be 1.

Geddit??? No? Then read it again. It's real simple. Or load up the example
level provided... Ofcourse the first screen doesn't have an entrance and the
last screen doesn't have an exit!! Just make sure the trapped miner is in the
final screen (It would be very annoying for our H.E.R.O. not to have anyone to
resque!!!) :)
