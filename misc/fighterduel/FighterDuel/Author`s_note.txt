 This program is shareware.You should copy and spread this package, until it 
contains the original stuff and including this shareware note, and no charge
except the postal, and packaging costs collected.
 If you like this program then you should send us any support, because I`m
a poor university student and I am short on supplies.
 New Spacehawks products will be released soon.Most of these are strategic
games in progress.

 The fighterduel is a simple shoot him up game.You need only two joys to use
it correctly.It was developed under Amos1.4. It`s only tested on my simple
A1200,but I hope it will run on other machines too.
