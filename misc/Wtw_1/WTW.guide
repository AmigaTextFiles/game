@TOC "MAIN"



          Wålly the Wörrm is a new version of the old classic Worm-game.
"It's so easy to play that even YOU should be able to pick it up in no time."

By the way, Wålly the Wörrm is the swedish way of spelling Wally the Worm.
   

              BEHOLD!     WÅLLY THE WÖRRM IS FREEWARE!!!

  
    IMPORTENT NOTE:
   
    Electronic Minds takes no responsibility if your monitor or your head
  explodes or if any other minor problem occur while using Wålly the wörrm.

   Choose a level in the main-menu using the joystick or the arrow-keys.
   Goto "Exit" and press Fire or Return to play the selected level.

Use your joystick to move the white line (that's Wålly) around the screen.
 OR... Use the keys, the ones to the right with the numbers on.


 Normal mode or PC-mode?
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 If you are a Lamer use PC-mode. If you are normal use "normal mode"
 If you are something else, don't play!   ;-)


 More...

 Pick up as many flashing "items" as possible to get points (400p each)

 While you wind around the screen you'll notice that Wålly gets taller.
 He gets one pixel taller every 2:nd second.
 When you take one of the "items" he'll get 10 pixels taller.

 If you play VERY good Wålly will reach the maximum length of 2200 pixels.
 At that time he will begin to flash yellow/white.
 and the point-counter will freak out (lots and lots of points 8-)

 We recomend you to explore the levels the first time you play.
 Try to find out where you can and can not go with Wålly.

       Voodoo.
       ~~~~~~~
       Well... It's a level...you know..in the jungle...or something.

       Note: This is the "Happy level" (You know it's green and nice.)
       Some people also think this is the hardest level.

          
       Techno.
       ~~~~~~~
       It doesn't actually have very much to do with the music style
       we just thought that it was ehh.. a nice name..

       Note: This is probably the easiest level.

          
       Chains.
       ~~~~~~~
       Oooh.. this is a scary one.
          
       Note: This should be the hardest level as it forces you to go
       in the diagonal directions. There's not too much space either.
