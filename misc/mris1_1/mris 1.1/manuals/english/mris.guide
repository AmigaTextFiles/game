   This  manual is  derived from  the original Xmris  manpage.  However,
   everything that only  applies to the AmigaOS port  is written by  me.
   Now, the bad message:  I'm not a writer. This is, basically, my first
   attempt at making a "real" manual... you have been warned.

@NODE Game "mris: The game"

                                 @{b}The game@{ub}

   You control a gnome,  who  can  walk around  a  garden,  along  paths
   already marked, or create new paths wherever you wish.  You also have
   a ball, which can be  thrown in  the direction you're facing, towards
   the gnome's  feet.  Points are scored for collecting cherries (if you
   collect eight cherries  without stopping or pushing an apple, you get
   a bonus),  killing  monsters (by squashing them, or throwing the ball
   at  them), and collecting the prize left  when all the  monsters have
   come out of their den.

   Extra lives are obtained by  killing all the 'EXTRA' monsters at  the
   top of  the garden, so that the letters change from stippled to solid
   (or grey to black or white, for color). One of these comes out on its
   own  every  5000 points.  When  you  collect  the  prize,  the normal
   monsters  freeze,  and an extra  monster emerges,  along  with  three
   drones.  Killing  the  letter monster will kill the drones too.  When
   the three drones  are dead, the normal monsters wake up and things go
   faster.

   When  all  the  normal  monsters  are  killed,  or all  the  cherries
   collected, or you have got  the final  extra monster,  you advance to
   the next garden.

   You  can kill the  monsters by throwing the ball at them, or dropping
   the apples  on them. You get more points for squashing them,  and the
   more  you  squash in  one go, the  more  points you  get.   The extra
   monster, and its drones,  can eat  the apples, provided  that they're
   walking towards  the  apple.  You  die  by colliding with  a  monster
   (unless its eating an apple, in which case no harm  is  done),  or by
   being squashed  by  a falling  apple.  Sometimes a falling apple will
   break open to reveal a diamond.   The points scores are scaled by the
   game speed, @{" see below " LINK Speed}.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Highscores "mris: Highscores"

                                @{b}Highscores@{ub}

   Your score may be immortalized in the all time best scores and/or the
   best of the day scores, and/or your own personal best scores. If your
   score was added to the  best of the day after 21:00, it is kept until
   noon the next day, otherwise it will be removed at midnight. There is
   only one entry per  user in the all time best and the best of the day
   tables.

   Contrary  to Xmris, mris  uses  separate score files for every garden
   file.

   Mris uses the score management of gamesupport.library; therefore  the
   score tables are not compatible with Xmris. As of gamesupport.library
   version  1.0,  scores   are  stored   in   "GAMESTUFF:",  "mris:"  or
   "PROGDIR:",  depending on which  of these directories actually exist,
   and where the score tables are actually found.

   Mris will not  complain  if it can't create the highscore  tables ---
   you just won't  get any.  This is important if  mris is  stored on  a
   read-only  volume,   such  as  a  CDROM.   If   neither  "mris:"  nor
   "GAMESTUFF:"  are  assigned,  you  won't  get  any  highscore tables.
   Therefore, if "PROGDIR:" is not  writeable, you should assign "mris:"
   or "GAMESTUFF:" to point to some writeable location.

   Concerning possible future games, "GAMESTUFF:"  is a  directory  that
   all games will use, while "mris:" will only be used by mris.  This is
   pretty obvious, but mentioning it here doesn't cost any money.

@NODE Speed "mris: Speed"

                                   @{b}Speed@{ub}

   There are two load lines at the bottom edge of the window.  One shows
   the frame time ratio and grows from  left to right.   The other shows
   the frame loading and grows from right to  left.  Note that these two
   lines can  overlap, and are  drawn  with xor plotting.  You can  tell
   which is which,  because the frame loading line  alters on a frame by
   frame basis, whereas  the  frame time ratio only alters occasionally.
   The frame load  line grows by  one pixel  for  every frame which took
   longer to animate than  there was allotted time, and is shrunk by one
   pixel  for each frame which is animated in time. The frame time ratio
   shows the actual frame time, relative  to  the  the ideal frame time.
   For a  frame time ratio of r, the line is 1 - 1 / r  the width of the
   window. Ie, for frame time ratio of 3 (one third speed) it covers two
   thirds of the window width.  The  frame  time ratio  is a  long  time
   average of  the real frame  times.  It  is  used  to scale the points
   scored in the game. The higher the ratio,  the lower the  score, thus
   making  heterogeneous  comparisons  possible.  The  score  scaling is
   biased  towards lower frame  ratios, so you can't get  a higher score
   just  by making the  game slower.   If  your  system  becomes heavily
   loaded, you can pause the game, to prevent the frame time ratio being
   updated.  When the  frame  load  line diminishes, you  can resume the
   game.

   The  game  works best  with  all  other processes asleep.  If another
   process gets too much processor  time,  the animation will  be jerky,
   and the load line will start to grow.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Controls "mris: Controls"

                                 @{b}Controls@{ub}

   The game  is  controlled  from  the keyboard or a joystick in port 1.
   All the key bindings can be changed during  game startup, or from the
   @{"key configuration" LINK MenusSettings 24} window.

   There are four direction keys, known as up, down,  left and right and
   the  ball  can be thrown with the throw key. The joystick maps to the
   four direction keys, the joystick fire button is acts as throw key.

   Because the paths are aligned to a matrix, it is  only possible to go
   in  any  direction at  intersections.  Elsewhere you  can  either  go
   horizontally or go  vertically.  Pressing more than one direction key
   will turn  the gnome appropriately  at the next intersection, so  you
   can  go  round corners  by  pressing  the  new direction  key  before
   releasing  the old one. If you press a single  direction key to go in
   an  impossible direction (ie  not at an intersection), the gnome will
   either continue  in  the  direction  it  was  already  going,  or, if
   stationary, move towards the nearest  intersection.  As  an  example,
   suppose you're going left and want to go up at the next intersection,
   the sequence would be,

          left pressed, because that's the way you're going
          up pressed, before the intersection
          left released, when you've gone round the corner

   The game can be paused by iconizing it with the iconize key or gadget
   (when your  boss  walks  in),  or by losing the keyboard focus, or by
   pressing the pause key. If your joystick has  a right button, it maps
   to the pause key.

   When de-iconized, either  by using the app-icon, sending  it a CTRL-F
   signal or using  the Commodities Exchange program, the  game  remains
   paused.  To continue, press the throw key. When paused, you can abort
   the current game by pressing the quit key.  If the game is displaying
   the demonstration screens, the quit key will quit the game, and pause
   key will cycle onto the next demonstration screen.  During  the score
   table  display,  the direction  keys  can  be used  to  change  to  a
   different score  table. Up or  right cycle forwards and down or  left
   cycle backwards.  During the garden demonstration, the direction keys
   can be used to select a  different garden. If you start the game from
   that new  garden,  you will  start  at  that  level,  but  not  score
   anything. During  the game there are several information screens  and
   pauses, these can be skipped by pressing the throw key.

   Pressing the  HELP key  will  bring up a menual, if possible. It will
   only  work  if  a  manual  in one  of  your  preferred  languages  is
   available. Also note that the help key is not configurable.

   @{b}Change user...@{ub}

   Change user  name.  The  name  of the user  is very important for the
   highscore tables.  You can change the username at  any time, even  in
   the middle of the game.

   The game tries to find a @{" default username " LINK Defaults 17} during startup.


   @{b}Errors...@{ub}

   This menu  item opens  the error window. This window actually pops up
   automatically  in case of  an error  (unless something prevents that,
   such as an out-of-memory condition).


   @{b}About mris...@{ub}

   Display some information about the game.


   @{b}Quit@{ub}

   Many  years  of careful research have not produced any useful  result
   yet. Millions  of dollars  have been spent, but  we still don't  know
   what this item does.

@ENDNODE

@NODE MenusGardens "mris: Menus (Gardens)"

                              @{b}Menus: Gardens@{ub}

   During startup, mris scans the  directory "PROGDIR:mris gardens"  for
   garden files. The available files are listed in this menu.

   Contrary  to Xmris, mris keeps seperate sets of highscore tables  for
   every garden file.

   Note that the garden  files  used by mris are NOT compatible with the
   loadable gardens  used by Xmris.  However, I have  added a conversion
   program called @{" ASCIItoGarden " LINK ASCIItoGarden} to convert Xmris garden files to  mris
   garden files.

@ENDNODE

@NODE MenusDemos "mris: Menus (Demo screen)"

                            @{b}Menus: Demo screen@{ub}

   This menu lets you go directly to any of the game demo screens.

   Note  that  you will be able to go  to the highscore screen,  but  if
   there are no highscore  tables available to display  you'll  actually
   end up at the game name screen.

   Also, the  "Sprites"  demo screen  is different from the  other  demo
   screens. It does not  time  out, and the throw key will not start the
   game. The  "Sprites" screen is only available thru menu selection; it
   will not be displayed during normal demo cycling.

@ENDNODE

@NODE MenusSettings "mris: Menus (Settings)"

                              @{b}Menus: Settings@{ub}

   The Settings menu lets you change various aspects of the game.

   @{b}Random apples@{ub}

   (X)mris has  two methods  for placing the apples. They will either be
   placed according to one  of four sets of explicit apple positions, or
   placed randomly on any permitted location (though trying not to place
   them adjacently).
   If this option is turned "on", apples will be placed randomly.


   @{b}Control@{ub}

   @{b}Control/Joystick (port 1)@{ub}

   If this option is turned "on", the game will use a joystick connected
   to gameport 1.
   If this option is "off", the joystick will be left alone.


   @{b}Control/Key bindings...@{ub}

   Selecting  this item opens  a  window that  lets  you change  the key
   bindings.   The window contains a string gadget for every key; if the
   string gadget  is  empty,  the  default key will be  used.  Keys  are
   specified as standard commodity descriptions of class "rawkey".


   @{b}Display@{ub}

   @{b}Display/female (msit)@{ub}

   (X)mris  can  also  be  run  as msit.  The  two sexes have  different
   sprites.  Mris selects the classic sprites, while msit selects a more
   modern set.   The @{" initial gender " LINK Startup 4} of  the game  is  taken from  the
   program name (mris or msit);


   @{b}Display/Dynamic colors@{ub}

   This option enables the use of two dynamic colors, which alter during
   the game. Note that if this option is "on",  dynamic colors will only
   be used if two colors are available for exclusive use.
   If you don't understand this, don't worry. Leave it "on".


   @{b}Display/Screen...@{ub}

   Select the screen to  use  for mris.   This  item  opens a screenmode
   requester which  lets  you  select an existing  public  screen,  or a
   screenmode and size for a new screen.
   Note  that the width,  height  and depth  gadgets have no meaning for
   existing public screens.
   Also, the requester  will  only  offer public  screens that are large
   enough for the mris window.
   If you specify a new screen, the minimum size of the width and height
   gadgets is a "few pixel" too small  --- this is  because mris doesn't
   know the size of the window borders in  advance.  The minimum size is
   actually the size of the window contents, so you must make the actual
   screen a little larger.
   You can't specify a screen font, for the time being.


   @{b}Display/Font...@{ub}

   This item opens a fontrequester to let you select another font to use
   for the game. Note that we only support fonts up to 32 pixels high.
   Also, for the time  being, slanted or italic fonts are not completely
   supported  ---  the last letter in a string  might be cut off at  the
   right edge.


   @{b}Save as...@{ub}

   This item  will  open  a  filerequester to select  a file to save the
   current settings to. Settings are  always  saved  into icons;  if the
   selected filename does not  already have an  ".info"  suffix, ".info"
   will be appended.

   If the icon is actually the  program icon, the settings are  saved as
   default, as described @{" below " LINK MenusSettings 92}.

   Otherwise the selected icon  is created or  modified.  The  resulting
   icon will  be a project  icon  with the  default tool set to the game
   executable, and  @{" tooltypes " LINK WorkbenchStartup} set according to the  current settings.
   All unknown tooltypes are preserved.


   @{b}Save as default@{ub}

   This is  very similar  to  the @{" previous " LINK MenusSettings 76} menu  item, except that  it
   always writes to the program  icon. Consequently, the resulting  icon
   will be a tool icon.

   Sorry.  Xmris 4.02 doesn't have sound or background tunes, and  among
   the things I cannot  possibly do is writing  music and creating sound
   effects.  Therefore, Xmris 4.02 is silent, and so is mris 1.1.

   This  is the first release, which means no changes. However,  besides
   the obvious stuff I have fixed what I think is a bug in the  original
   Xmris 4.02.  When  the  apples  are placed  randomly  (+random),  the
   original  Xmris apparently places all  the apples at the  top of  the
   board. When I  examined that behavior I found  something that  looked
   like a typo,  and  fixed  it. There  is a  slight chance that  I have
   missed  something ---  that  some  part of  the  source  that  I have
   disabled somehow causes the apples to be placed randomly, but I don't
   really think that's the case.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Defaults "mris: Defaults"

                             @{b}Default settings@{ub}

   The  default gender is derived from the program name:  if it contains
   the string "msit" (ignoring case), the default gender will be  female
   (msit), otherwise it will be male (mris).
   The gender can be  changed with the  @{" Settings/Display/Female (msit) " LINK MenusSettings 34}
   menu  item, the  @{" MRIS/MSIT " LINK ShellStartup 10} command line arguments, or  the  @{" MSIT " LINK WorkbenchStartup 13}
   tooltype.

   The game is known as mris, because the arcade game was masculine.

   Note that  the game  only  checks the name of the executable; it does
   not consider the name of  selected project icons when determining the
   default gender.

   The game also tries to find a reasonable default  username. It checks
   the environment variables REALNAME, USERNAME and USER, in that order.
   If it finds one with at least 5 characters, that string will be  used
   as username. Otherwise no username will be set.
   The username can be changed with the @{" Game/Change User... " LINK MenusGame 4} menu item,
   the @{" USER " LINK WorkbenchStartup 23} tooltype or the @{" USER " LINK ShellStartup 20} command line argument.

   The default keys are language dependent; the english defaults are:
     up      -> up
     down    -> down
     left    -> left
     right   -> right
     throw   -> space
     pause   -> p
     quit    -> q
     iconize -> i
   The     key     bindings     can     be     changed     with      the
   @{" Settings/Control/Key binding... " LINK MenusSettings 24} menu item,  the @{" key tooltypes " LINK WorkbenchStartup 28} or
   the @{" key command line " LINK ShellStartup 25} arguments.

   The  default  screen will be  the  default public  screen,  which  is
   usually the Workbench  screen. You can specify a screen with the
   @{" SCREEN " LINK WorkbenchStartup 40} tooltype or the @{" SCREEN " LINK ShellStartup 77} command line argument.

   The  default  font  is  "Times 18", which  is  part  of  the  AmigaOS
   distribution.  If it is not available, the screenfont will be used if
   it  fits the  requirements  (i.e. has a height of  no  more  than  32
   pixels). If it doesn't, "Topaz 9" will be used.
   The font  can be changed  with the  @{" Settings/Display/Font... " LINK MenusSettings 67}  menu
   item, the @{" FONT " LINK WorkbenchStartup 45} tooltype or the @{" FONT " LINK 42} command line argument.

   Concerning the joystick, the  default is to use a joystick in port 1.
   This can  be  changed with  the @{" Settings/Control/Joystick (port 1) " LINK MenusSettings 17}
   menu item,  the @{" JOYSTICK " LINK WorkbenchStartup 50} tooltype,  or the  @{" JOYSTICK/NOJOYSTICK " LINK 47}
   command line arguments.

   The game will default  to  using dynamic colors. This can be  changed
   with the  @{" Settings/Display/Dynamic colors " LINK MenusSettings 42} menu item, the @{" DYNAMIC " LINK WorkbenchStartup 61}
   tooltype or the @{" DYNAMIC/NODYNAMIC " LINK 57} command line arguments.

   The  default  for  the  "Random  apples" option is  OFF; this can  be
   changed with  the @{" Settings/Random apples " LINK MenusSettings 6}  menu item, the  @{" RANDOM " LINK WorkbenchStartup 72}
   tooltype, or the @{" RANDOM/NORANDOM " LINK 67} command line arguments.

   If it  exists, the  garden  file "Digits" will used on startup. If it
   does not exist, no garden file will be loaded. The active garden file
   can be changed with the @{" Gardens " LINK MenusGardens} menu.

@NODE Bugs "mris: Known bugs"

                                @{b}Known bugs@{ub}

   Besides the  things implied  by  the @{" ToDo " LINK ToDo} list,  there is only  one
   known bug: currently all filerequesters "forget" their selection when
   they are closed.  This means if close a  filerequester and reopen  it
   later, it will start at its default setup again.

   Also,   not   all   combinations   of   mid-game   gender   changing,
   iconification/deiconification  and  dynamic/nodynamic  color  changes
   have been  checked. In  fact,  mid-game iconification/deiconification
   was hacked into the game, since the original Xmris doesn't need to do
   it the way it has to be done  on  the Amiga; this is probably one  of
   the major problem areas of the AmigaOS port.

   When you display a manual, some resources will not be freed until the
   game window closes (iconification, gender changing, quitting etc.).
   This  is a design or implementation bug of amigaguide.library ---  it
   doesn't seem to send any message when the window is closed, therefore
   I can't  free  the  stuff  until I  really  want  to quit.  Also, the
   AmigaGuide documentation is among the worst that  Commodore  has ever
   produced.

   Mris does not  warn  you  if a  key  is  assigned  to more  than  one
   function.

   The score tables might look really ugly if you use wide fonts, 'cause
   the game will reduce inter-column  spacing to 0. Maybe I should force
   some space between columns.

   On  screens with just a few colors, the  game might decide to run  in
   color even though it would look better in monochrome. There is really
   no easy way to fix this --- how do you measure "looks good"?
   The same problems applies to monochrome displays. If you are using an
   8-bit greyscale display, the game might come up in color. There is no
   way  to  get around  this,  since  AmigaOS  doesn't care whether  the
   display is color or greyscale --- it assumes color.
   A  future  mris  release  might  allow you  to  force  the  game into
   monochrome (Xmris has this feature).

   The screenmode requester, and the system displayinfo database, lack a
   couple of features, so the screen configuration is not as comfortable
   as it  should.  Of  course,  part of the  problem  could be solved by
   making my own screen requester,  but  most  of the technical problems
   require additional AmigaOS features.

   The  error  handling  during  startup  is  somewhat unfriendly.  This
   affects all errors that cause an abort, instead of  just  leaving  an
   iconified game.

   Not  all out of  memory conditions are actually reported in the error
   window,  although none of  them will  be fatal.   Most  out of memory
   conditions just  cause  some  things  to not work at all, or not work
   properly. This means  windows might not open, oversized text  strings
   that  would normally be  clipped  suddenly start trashing  the window
   borders  and similar  things.

   There  is  absolutely  no  (system  approved) way  to  close  an  ASL
   requester under program control. This  means any of these  requesters
   will stay open until they are closed  by the user. It also means they
   won't move to another screen.

   The area where the den is placed seems to be slightly gfx trashed.  I
   have no idea whether this is a problem that Xmris has as well. -:(

   If  you  have  created  your  own screen (instead  of  opening on  an
   existing screen), and  there are visitor windows on this screen,  and
   you change the screen for mris, mris  will  block  until all  visitor
   windows are  closed. It will block and block and block... there is no
   way (yet) to change your decision and reopen on the old screen.

   Not all "special" cases  that  the game should be able to handle have
   been tested, and some them have only had some quick testing.

                         (in no particular order)

   - use TextExtent() instead of TextLength() (this will fix problems

   - write german manual
   - add userlist
   - add topaz/8 fallback for configuration windows
   - improve screen configuration
   - add some missing error messages
   - fold successive ERROR_NO_FREE_STORE messages into just one
   - fix the loadline -- apparently it's pretty messed up
   - add better screen management
   - save LEFT and TOP values for screens


                             @{b}Things I won't do@{ub}

   Originally I had  special  support  for  autoscrolling screens:  mris
   would scroll  the  screen  to make sure  the player  (and most of its
   surroudings)  is  always visible. However, when I thought about it, I
   realized  that it doesn't make sense: mris is extremely  hard to play
   if you don't see all of the window. So I dropped the scrolling 'cause
   people don't want to use it anyway.

   I have absolutely no idea how to make the game  mouse-controlable, so
   I didn't implement it.

   I  only know  two "human  languages": german and  english.  Therefore
   you'll not see any other catalogs or manuals from me.

@NODE Requirements "mris: Requirements"

                       @{b}Requirements for running mris@{ub}

   Mris requires AmigaOS 3.0 (V39) or newer to run. You will also need a
   "reasonably" fast system to actually enjoy the game. I have developed
   mris on a standard  A3000  running AmigaOS 3.1 (V40.68). On a 4 color
   screen it runs  fine, but on a 8 color screen it is  often too  slow,
   but still playable. Mris actually  looks  quite  okay with  8 colors,
   while msit gets a weird palette.

   Due to the extremely  slow  Amiga  gfx  hardware,  I  assume  that  a
   standard A3000 equipped with a gfx board can run mris in full color.

   If locale.library  is  not  available, mris will  fall back  to using
   german  (since  the  german  strings  are  built into  the  program).
   However, it will first look for an english manual before  trying  the
   german manual. Other manuals are ignored.

   Before complaining about  the obvious fact that  Mr.  Do clones exist
   that run on a standard A500 in 32 colors, consider that mris is fully
   system  compliant,  hardware independent,  and runs in  an  intuition
   window. If this is not what you want, use one these hardware-banging,
   system-killing, "crash on anything but 68000" games.

@NODE ScreenDescription "Screen description strings"

                        @{b}Screen description strings@{ub}

   Screen  description  strings are used  to describe a screen. They are
   constructed from the following template:

   PUBSCREEN/K: the name  of an existing  public screen to  open  on. If
                this argument  is given, none of the remaining arguments
                must be specified.

   LEFT/K/N:
   TOP/K/N:
   WIDTH/K/N:
   HEIGHT/K/N:  size and position of the screen

   DEPTH/K/N:   depth of screen

   TITLE/K:     title of screen

   OVERSCAN/S:  use "graphics" overscan instead of "text" overscan

   FONT/K:      a @{" font description " LINK FontDescription} string.

   MODEID/K/N:  Currently the only way to specify a mode is by supplying
                the mode-ID.  If no mode  is specified,  the mode of the
                "Workbench" screen will be used.

                The  easiest  way to  obtain  the required mode ID is by
                opening the @{" screen configuration " LINK MenusSettings 50} requester,  selecting
                the  mode you want, save  it and  examine  the  @{" SCREEN " LINK WorkbenchStartup 83}
                tooltype.


   Example:
   DEPTH=3 MODEID=167940 TITLE="mris screen"
   A  fullsize (text-overscan) PAL interlace screen with 8 colors (I use
   this  on  my  system,  since  NTSC  screens  are  too  small).

   DEPTH=2 MODEID=102404 HEIGHT=570 FONT="helvetica 18"
   A text-overscanned, standard width NTSC hires interlace screen with 4
   colors, a height of 570 pixels and "helvetica 18" as screen font.


   Note that the  screen descriptions  might look strange when specified
   as command line arguments. The  last example specified via  tooltypes
   is written as:

   SCREEN=DEPTH=2 MODEID=102404 HEIGHT=570 FONT="helvetica 18"

   However, for a command line argument you have to write:
   SCREEN="DEPTH=2 MODEID=102404 HEIGHT=570 FONT=*"helvetica 18*""

@ENDNODE

@NODE FontDescription "Font description strings"

                         @{b}Font description strings@{ub}

   Font description strings are used  to specify a bitmap font. They are
   constructed from the following template:

   NAME/A:      the name of the font
   SIZE/N/A:    the pixel height of the font

   UNDERLINE/S:
   BOLD/S:
   SLANTED/S:   font styles. Mris currently ignores these.

@NODE ASCIItoGarden

   This is a simple converter program to convert  Xmris garden files  to
   mris garden files. It can only be used from a shell:

   ASCIItoGarden ASCIIFILE/A,GARDENFILE/A

   ASCIIFILE/A:  the xmris garden file (source file)
   GARDENFILE/A: the mris garden file (destination file)

   ASCIItoGarden  is  not very  powerful;  it will probably work for all
   files created by  xmred. It  definitely works for  the xmris  gardens
   digits.gdn, alphabet.gdn and puzzle.gdn (the gardens that are part of
   the xmris-4.02 distribution).
