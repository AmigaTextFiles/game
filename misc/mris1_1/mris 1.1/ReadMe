Mris will run from this directory without problems; you don't need to
run the installation script. The installation script is provided so
you can easily unpack the distribution into some temp directory, run
the installation, and delete the distribution directory afterwards.

Note that the installation script will NOT provide an msit executable.
Usually you'll use a link msit -> mris, but both hardlinks and
softlinks have various problems in many releases of AmigaOS. Softlinks
(the rest of the computing world calls them symbolic links) actually
work in all versions (the bug in pre-V40 DOS doesn't show up here),
although they can trash your harddisk and can confuse the novice users
when they try to delete a softlink which is pointing to nowhere.
Hardlinks are extremely dangerous in pre-V40 versions of the ROM
filing system, which means novice users could trash their harddisk
when trying to delete mris.  So, I decided to stay on the safe side,
which means no msit executable.
