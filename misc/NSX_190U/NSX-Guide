@REMARK =========================================================================

@NODE 1 "What Is NSX?"

        NSX means Nibbler Super eXtra. You'll read why we named it as 'Super
Extra'...

        This one is our 4th Nibbler clone. The first one was on ZX Spctrum
and never ever released to public. Next two ones are "Nibbler" and "Nibbler+"
which are avaliable on Aminet... When we decided to do a new one, wanted it
to be good and different than any other Nibbler clone. Because of there are
zillions of nibblers, we first start with 16x16 maze blocks, shadows and a
few extras (more points, bonus points, reverse, exit), than called it as
'Nibbler Extra'... but more we (M.Ali and Tunc) were on the phone the more
we added to game; the we reached "Nibbler Super Extra"...

        After releasing the preview version, @{"nsx-pre" LINK PRE}, some of
the routines and data structure completely changed, some bugs fixed and some
more bugs added....

        Simply, the game is another (the best ?) clone of very well known
Nibbler, but with different type of @{"levels" LINK 2} and @{"extras" LINK 4}. 

        You do not need to read the document to play the game, but read
extras to understand what is happening and why...

        Nibbler Super eXtra is the first title of @{"BACKYARD BROTHERS" LINK 11}.
@ENDNODE
@REMARK =========================================================================
@NODE 2 "Levels"

        NSX' levels are a bit different. The main difference is the graphics.
NSX uses 6 bitplanes EHB screen. 6th plane used for shadow datas to improve
the look of the mazes. A 20 frames of background animation or a cool cycle
animation is avaliable on every screen.

        Mazes are just a full screen colorful block set (no scrolling
yet???!! maybe.....). But there may be non-wall tiles on the edges and this
means nibby can pass. When nibby runs out ouf screen it will appear on the
opposite side. Quite good....

        Some mazes have tricks. There may some walls invisible, some walls
are fake.. If you find yourself in stuck, look for tricks....

        After 4 levels of normal gameplay, you will find yourself in a bonus
level. On bonus levels there are no extras. If you complete the level you
will be awarded with an extra life, if you can't you won't lose a life.. The
main trick of the bonus levels are fake walls.....

        Background graphics and animations changes after every 4 levels 
(which we call them as, world). Every world starts with a warp screen (a 
graphic with 3 lines of text). Each world has its own password to make you 
happy.. You will be informed about passwords after every world.

        There are 11 worlds (44 normal + 11 bonus levels) in the unregistered
version.
        There are 25 worlds (100 normal + 25 bonus levels) in the registered
version currently. We are adding more to this number.

        If you like to see what will the next 15 worlds will look like then
check the IFF files in "NSX-IFF" directory.

        The NSX-Editor is nearly complete, registered users will have it too,
when it is finished.

@ENDNODE
@REMARK =========================================================================
@NODE 3 "Options"

        After watching the title screen, you will reach to an options screen.

START GAME:     Guess what? It starts game..... really!!!
                From the first level if you didn't enter a password.

PLAY EXTRA WORLDS:      This will take you to extra worlds. Extra worlds are
                the same as game worlds, but no bonus levels. When you
                register, the editor you'll get, is to create extra worlds.
                We will release some extra worlds for unregistered users too.

ENTER PASSWORD: Takes you to a password screen. If password accepted, you
                will warp to that world, if not the first world. Once you
                enter the right password, no need to enter it again, just
                use 'start game'.

SPEED:          This is new for this version. Try different speed options
                slower/slow/normal/fast/faster.... Try slow modes if you
                have an accelerator.... normal mode is good for a standard
                A1200...

LIVES:          How many lives? From 3 to 9. Try 9 if you're a beginner, 3
                for a tuff game.

NIBBY vs LEMMY ANIM:    NSX has two 25 frames animations for nib-lemm fight.
                Animations will be loaded from disk when needed, and this
                takes time (especcially if you're playing from floopy). Or it
                may interrupt your play, simply turn them off.

GAME OVER SEQUENCE:     Read the upper paragraph again. All same for this
                sequence..

AUDIO:          Sound FX or Music. Clear? When you turn the audio to sfx,
                even the tune on title screen will be disabled.

EXIT:           Exits NSX then goes back to where you are.

@REMARK =========================================================================

@NODE PRE "Nibbler Super Extra preview version on the net"

Nibbler Super eXtra preview version was released on the summer of 1995. I
don't think that a huge amounts of download it caused but some downloaded it.
It also appeared on Aminet CDs 8,9, Aminet Set 2.

You can (?) find the preview version on Aminet, just look at;

"game/misc/nsx-pre.lha"

@endnode
@REMARK =========================================================================
@NODE 11 "Brothers on the yard"

Backyard Brothers are a little team of ex-sceners (or sceners). There are two
coders (M.Ali and Berke), two graphicians (M.Ali and Tunc) and a musician
(Onat) in the team.

I think we are the only team from Turkey producing games for ourselves to 
play and some utils for all to use.

This is the first title, and it took very much time to finish it, 2 years!!!
But the time we spent on the game is just 4 months, because of lots of
problems these 4 months are spreaded to two years. But we finally fixed much
of those problems and finished it (finally). Hope there won't be more
problems in the future.

Next title will be "GEENIE", you will see some samples from its graphics on
world 13. It's a cute jump game with toonish style of graphics. Based on the
story of four green friends, Geenie, Teenie, Meenie and Vinnie. Wait for it!!
Preview version will be out SOON!!!

@ENDNODE
@REMARK =========================================================================
@NODE 12 "Other Stuff"
These things were forgotten and added here, hope there's not more:

CONTROLS:
         - Use your stick (port 2)
         - Cursor keys to move + space for fire
         - Keypad 2-4-6-8 to move + Keypad 5 for fire

HIGH SCORE TABLE:
        Nibbler also has a high score list and the list will be written to 
        disk after every high score. Do not reset your machine when disk 
        is active. Use 'QUIT GAME' to quit the game then reset)..

TIME LIMIT:
        There's also a time limit against you. It's in 3 steps; in first step
        you'll be alarmed and Nibbler will turn to yellow, in second step,
        you'll be alarmed and Nibbler will turn to red, in the last step,
        you'll be alarmed and Nibbler will ....... be dead.
        You have to press fire when the time images appear.

17020:
        Beverly Hills 17020? Not.... 17020 bytes are the data lenght for
        extra and normal worlds. You can not rename and play normal levels in
        a different order (if you're not very very very lucky) or you cannot
        replace after editing them. NSX checks file and exits with an error
        message if occured. But you can edit worlds and play them as extra
        worlds if you have NSX-Editor.

GIVE UP A LIFE:
        When you feel yourself in stuck, press "ESC" to sacrifice a life.
        You will need it in some levels, but don't forget you won't loose a
        life when you press in bonus levels.

@ENDNODE
@REMARK =========================================================================
@NODE 13 "Extra Worlds"

        Extra worlds option is a great fun for us and for every registered
user. You can design your own worlds (4 normal levels for a world, no bonus
one). This means:
        - You can pixel graphics (warp, maze grafix and background anims)
        - You can design levels (with a designer of course)
        - You can upload them to Aminet and give us fun.

        In the unregistered version there is only one extra world. In
registered one there will be 5 and some explanations and gfx datas for you.
NSX is able to use 15 extra worlds at once.

NSX-Editor is easy to use, fun to use. We used it for worlds after 14. You
are just pixelling your graphics (or use template ones), editing what you
like to be written, then start editing 4 mazes, then save them as a final
data.

        We as Backyard Brothers will release extra world packages for
everyone (registered or unregistered) to play.

        Spartanim: A very useful frame animator for you to use in your paint
                   program. We used it for NSX animations.
        Leveledit: A very useful level editor.
  They will be released soon.... Sooon!

- Please do not crack the game and not release trainers. The game itself has
  some cheat options. Try to find them instead.

@NODE 15 "HISTORY"

pre     Uploaded to Aminet and released in some of Aminet CDs. as a @{"preview" link PRE}
        version.

1.89    Released after a looooooooooooong delay with lots of features and
        extras and levels.

1.90    This version.. Added the speed option... One more extra world
        released.





----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wonder why we start from 1.89????

We gave the version number 1.00 to the preview, everytime we add a new thing
to the game we add 0.01 to the number... You might guess we did a lot since
preview.....

@ENDNODE
@REMARK =========================================================================
@NODE 16 "WHAT'S NEW?"

What's new for this version?

The main difference is the SPEED option.... I (M.Ali) didn't want to slow
down the game because I thought it will be too easy but added a cheat option
for Burak 'GART' Kucukler to play his all-times-fave game. But after
releasing the v1.89, we received some mails about its non-playability because
of speed.....

The second difference is an extra 'Extra World'.. Now you can play two extra
worlds (8 levels more)....



See you on next version, if there will be next version.....
