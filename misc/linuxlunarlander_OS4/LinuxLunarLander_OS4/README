Linux Lunar Lander README 

In this game you have to land the Lunar Module "The Penguin" on the moon.
You should try to land inside the landing zone, 
this area is indicated with a green arrow and the letters "LZ".
You can safely land outside the landing zone, but then you'll receive less points.
When you hit the lunar surface you should make sure that your velocity doesn't exceed the maximum and you spaceship is in a vertical position.

You can rotate your spaceship and ignite the engine using the arrow keys:
	LEFT: rotate 10 DEG left
	RIGHT: rotate 10 DEG right
	UP: ignite engine

Caution: the rotation of you spaceship modifies the direction of your acceleration.

After each landing you will get a score based on the softness of the landing, the amount of fuel left in your tanks, distance from the indicated landing zone, etc...

To compile the game you type "make && make install".
You also need the SDL libraries to compile the game.

This game is licensed under the GPL (check source-files for more information).
I've used SFont code and an SFont font-file in this program, SFont is also GPL.
