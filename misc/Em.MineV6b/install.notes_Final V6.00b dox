Emerald Mine V6.00b Demo

This is an upgrade of version V6.00.
The only change is that it now also works on NTSC.
And we added some documentation.
So it's no use for PAL users to upload this version.



In this archive should be the following files:
C/AGAcheck
C/Intro
C/Selector
C/SetPatch
S/startup-sequence
AGA
ECS
install.notes
game.dox



How to play?

DISKETTE
--------
1) Format a diskette and make it bootable
2) Extract the archive to that diskette.
3) Boot from that diskette.



HARDDISK
--------
1) Extract the archive to (a subdirectory on) your harddisk.
2) Go to that subdirectory.
3) Type AGA or ECS to start the program



The program AGAcheck checks if you have an AGA machine. If you
have it will start the SetPatch program. Harddisk users already
did that so it's only usefull if you boot from diskette AND you
have an AGA machine.
