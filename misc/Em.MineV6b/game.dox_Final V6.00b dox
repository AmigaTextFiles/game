Here is some documentation to help you play Emerald Mine V6.00b demo.

After you've started the game a menu will appear.
It will look something like this:

--------------------------------------------------

SINGLE PLAYER/TEAMWORK:
-----------------------
There will be a roller-box turning around 'SINGLE PLAYER'.
If you press FIRE here then 'SINGLE PLAYER' will change to
'NO TEAMWORK IN DEMO'. Normally it will say 'TEAMWORK' but
this is disabled in the demo.
If you press FIRE again then it will say 'QUIT PLAYER V6.00'.
If at this point you push your joystick UP then you can leave
the game.
Pressing FIRE again will return you to 'SINGLE PLAYER'.
You can now pull your joystick DOWN to come to NAME.

NAME:
-----
Press FIRE to enter the name page and pick out a name of the
list of 10 names.
You can also push joystick DOWN and go to 'CHOOSE A PLAYER'.
When you are on that line press FIRE and 'ENTER NEW NAME'
will appear.
Now push joystick UP and go to on 1 of the 10 name entries.
Now press FIRE. The roller-box will dissappear and at the
bottom of the screen will appear 'ARE YOU SURE? Y N'.
Now press 'Y' or 'N'. Entering 'N' will do nothing while entering
'Y' will give you the possibility to enter your name. Maximum
is 10 characters. Use backspace to correct typing errors.
After pressing ENTER the program returns to the main menu on
the line START. Look there for further instructions.

HIGHSCORES:
-----------
Pressing fire on this line will show you the highscores of the
current level.
When you are on the highscore page you can push joystick UP and
DOWN to scroll through the 30 highscores. Pressing FIRE will
return to the main menu.

LEVEL:
------
On this line the roller-box goes clockwise. After pressing FIRE the
roller-box goes anti-clockwise. You can now push your joystick
LEFT and RIGHT to select level 0 till 3.
In a normal game you can select 0 till the level you have completed.
In a normal game are 81 levels. (0 till 80).

START:
------
Press FIRE to start the current level or push joystick UP to go to
one of the other menu items.




IN GAME FUNCTIONS:
------------------
Basicly it's all joystick action. UP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT and FIRE should
do the trick. Try not to die is our advice.
When you've collected all 'POINTS NEEDED' go the (heart-shaped) exit.
