Voodoo Girl:  Queen of the Darned  ---  (c) 2001-2002 Andrew Baker
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This game is based on Sierra On-Line's AGI game engine.  To run it, you'll need a Windows, Linux, or Mac OSx or pre-System 7 computer.  In Windows, just double-click the VG.com icon to start.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-I'm running Windows and it won't work!
    You may be using a version of Windows that is incompatible with the old DOS executable.  I would suggest you download Sarien (http://sourceforge.net/projects/sarien) for Win32 or NAGI (www.agidev.com/nagi.html) for Win32.  Both are excellent interpreters.  My experience is with NAGI, and I find it to be superior to the DOS executable for a number of reasons.

-I'm running Linux!
    Get Sarien for Linux (As well as MANY other UNIX variants, the Dreamcast, and handheld devices) or NAGI for Linux.

-I'm running Mac and it won't work!
   Unfortunately the original Mac AGI interpreters don't seem to work after System 7.  I'm upset about this, so I'm tinkering with Sarien for Mac OS 8.x, but I've not yet finished.  The Sarien project is working on this, as well.  Mac OSX is currently supported in Sarien.  If you have a pre-system 7 Mac, then I'd advise you to obtain a copy of a Sierra On-Line game for Mac, edit the Voodoo Girl resources to make them compatible with the executable, and put the executable in the same folder with the VG resources.  I'm afraid I haven't been able to test this myself, though.

-AAAUGH!  The music is horrible!
   I never liked the original music rendering in AGI, so that's why I prefer NAGI, which uses a different type of output, resulting in more natural and less annoying game music.

-The Intro won't work...  it just zips right through!
   In what may be a questionable decision on my part, I set the intro to be timed by the intro music.  So if you are running a music or sound application, chances are, the intro music is being skipped over.  Try turning off any music applications before running Voodoo Girl.

- I'm stuck!  HELP!
   If you simply cannot figure out the puzzles, never fear.  I'm waiting a while after release to give out a walk-through, to give everyone time to figure VG out for themselves.  
   If you have encountered a fatal bug, that being a bug that causes the game to freeze or VG to get stuck, I encourage you to report it to me immediately.  My contact information is provided on my website.
   It's a good idea to check my site (http://voodoogirl.cjb.net  or     www.angelfire.com/games4/failrate) regularly for updates.
