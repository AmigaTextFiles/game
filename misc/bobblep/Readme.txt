This little clone of Puzzle bobble was done one year ago for my girlfriend who
was playing on a pc clone. I rip the gfx (thanx to him), and added some features 
like sound, music and explosions. I did it the fastest as possible; a week has 
been necessary to have an enjoyable game nearly identical to the original. Now,
my girlfriend spent her time on irc channels (microsoft ones: argh!); i like it
too, so you could join me on #amiga or #amigachat at undernet/montreal or other.

See u,
