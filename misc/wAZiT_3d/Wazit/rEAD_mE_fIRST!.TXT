You may feel free to spread this VERY early piece of beta-game out.
I am NOT responsable for any damage this game may cause your system
(not that it has ever destroyed anything here, but still...).

rEQUIRES...

This  game should work fine on ANY amiga! There was no speed diffe-
rence between 020/030, but I'm not sure about 00. You don't need
any memory ;)

iNFO...

When  I  tested  the  game  YAGG I was impressed, very impressed; I
really liked those zooms. Then I read in the manual (I always  read
the  manual  AFTER testing a game ;) that it was coded in 60% Blitz
Basic. As I happen to be a Blitz-coder, I got pissed  off!  I don't
allow ANYONE to code something better than ME in Blitz!
   I  started  BB2, and half an hour later I had this BETA. Written
100% by me in 100% Blitz (No ASM or extra libraries  used).  OK,  I
DID  use  some  old  3D-routines that I coded about a year ago, but
they only made up 12 lines or so (of 200).

gAME...

You can't do much, only move a ship around and shoot.  It's  not  a
game  really,  as  there  is  absolutely  nothing  to do. But it IS
nothing but the very first BETA :)
   Joy - Left/Right   :   Rotate Left/Right
   Joy - Fire         :   Shoot
   <Esc>              :   Exit
   Left Mousebutton   :   Zoom in
   Right Mousebutton  :   Zoom out
   
The game will also zoom in/out depending on your distance from  the
arena-centre.

oK...

Now. This game is WAY faster than YAGG. Don't know'bout that other
game...  ehm... BratWurst. Is it fast?   Anyway! If You want me to
continue developing this game, I DEMAND you to send me an  e-mail!
   What would you care to see in the game? - Please tell me!
