Edit_CEL   **(Requires doloaddt.library, and classes/gaugeimage.class)**

      A visual cel converter.  Takes more effort than cli/script
  based converters...but you can see what you are doing. :)
      This program will all remap and dither pictures to match
  the current palette.  Kinda useful for some situations, I guess.

IFF2CEL  **(Requires datatypes.library v40)**

      Converts either a datatype picture to a .cel file, or
  a datatype animation to a series of .cel files.  Will backup
  existing cel files.
      This is very useful to create multi-layered objects.
  Create each layer on a different frame of an animation.  Pickup
  the cels as an animbrush and save.  This method ensures that
  all the cels share a common top-left corner!
      Due to my inability to determine the exact number of pad frames
  at the end of animations, some extra cels may be created. :(

  Use it as such:

    IFF2CEL file1
    IFF2CEL file1 file_#? file2


CELTOPPM
PPMTOCEL
KCFTOMAP
MAPTOKCF

      A bunch of old conversion programs I wrote.  Be careful,
  as some of these don't support KISSGS formats.  Always backup
  your data!


OPTCEL

      Optimizes cels into KISSGS format, using the offset values.
  This helps to save memory and rendering time.  This program
  has been tested, but it may trash the rightmost vertical
  line on some odd-numbered width cels?  I think I may have
  fixed it.  (God, I wish the kiss format had been set into
  stone to say odd-numbered widths were illegal...)
  Use it as such:

    OPTCEL file1.cel
    OPTCEL file1.cel abc*.cel file2.cel
  

CONVERTCEL

      Simply converts oldformat cels to KISSGS format.  It's
  better to use optcel from now on.
