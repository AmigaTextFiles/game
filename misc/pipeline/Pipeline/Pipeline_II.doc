                                 Pipeline II
                                -------------

CHANGES:
---------

The following changes to the first version have been made:

          - better GFX
          - easier game
          - 3 levels of difficulty
          - no problems with write-proteced disks
          - no mouse-pointer between fades
          - pause and continue now with left mouse-button
          - cheat-mode (hint: try a file-monitor)
          - intro
          - new docs (English/German)

I made the game easier because several guys moaned that it was too difficult
(We in CLUSTER can't understand that !).

THE GAME
---------

The idea of the game is to let the oil flow for some time which will increase
per level.If the oil can still flow if the clock has stopped you will reach
the next level, if the oil can not flow but there is still time left you lose
the game.

PLAYING THE GAME:

Pass the intro with the left mouse-button.
On the title-screen, press either the fire-button to start the game or the
left mouse-button to quit.
On the 'Get Ready'-screen use your joystick left/right to select the level
of difficulty.

                  Novice : You can replace a piece two times (see below).
                           The oil will start flowing late and will flow
                           slow.
                  Normal : You can replace a piece one time (see below).
                           The oil will start flowing at the normal time and
                           will flow at an average speed.
                  Champ! : You can not replace any set pieces (see below).
                           The oil will start flowing early and faster than
                           on any other levels.

Your playfield is on the right - a raster of 16*10 squares (I think).You can
controll a white cursor with your joystick.On the lower left corner the clock
will count the time - when the 'Pipeline' is fully released and the oil can
still flow you have finished the level.On the top five pieces are displayed.
If you press the fire-button you will set the piece on the bottom of the five
on the cursor-position on the playfield.The 4 pieces above will fall down and
a random piece will appear on the top.
After some time has passed, the oil starts flowing.You must build with the
random pieces a pipeline where the oil can flow through without interruption.
Never lead the oil into a wall - the game would be lost.But you can lead the
oil over some special symbols on the screen.

                  B           : 500 Bonus points.
                  Hourglasses : The oil will delay its flowing for some time.
                  \           : The clock will stop for some seconds.
                  ?           : Something will happen randomly.

Try to build crosses because this will give you an extra bonus.
In the first two levels of difficulty (Novice and Normal) you are able to de-
lete a piece from the playfield.Just hold the fire-button some seconds on the
piece, and the next piece will replace the old one.This gives you a penalty
of 250 points.You can use it once per level on the normal mode, on the novice
level you may use it twice.

Press left mouse-button to pause game and again to continue playing.
Press ESC to switch on fast-mode.

THE SCORE:

Score is the most important thing in Pipeline II.The main goal is to beat the
high-score, so real Pipeline II-players use the '/'-symbol to get time to
build longer pipelines.The score-table:

Every piece the oil flows through adds 15 to your score.
Every cross flown through gives you a bonus of 100 points.
Every time you use the 'replace'-possibility will drain 250 points from your
score.
Every special symbol used will give you at the end of the level a level*50
bonus.

END OF THE GAME:

If you have made a high-score you will enter the Pipeline II hall of fame.
The ten best players of all time are saved to disk - I did not released the
version with my high-score because it was too high to believe - play-testing
while programming gives experience ! So write-enable your disk when you want
your scores to be saved.If the disk is write-proteced they are not recorded.
(By the way, if you send me a letter please include your high-score - if it
will be higher than mine I will restart playing this game !)

Martin Mohr             Coding       (X-tension !)
Martin Rosenkranz       Graphics     (Flex !)
Philipp Witkop          Sound        (Madison !)
