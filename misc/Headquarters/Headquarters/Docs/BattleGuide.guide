   MechForce is a utility system which allows people to test "mechs" in
a "game arena" for the purpose of seeing how they would do against
other mechs.  Previous version of BattleFort and BattleForce are no

What is MechForce?
******************

   It is a game that simulates combat between two or more giant,
robot-like machines. Simple words can't begin to give you the feel of
piloting a 30 - 40 foot tall, fire breathing, earth shaking colossus
that obeys your every whim. To enjoy the game you must put yourself in
the cockpit of a Combat Mech. Live the experience!

   You are the elite of the elite - a Mech Warrior. Your Combat Mech
thunders under you as you pace across the land, searching for a reported
enemy mech. You view the land around you, searching for the enemy. To
your left the plain climbs gradually from low hills up to high
mountains. To your right is a lake, the calm waters shading from light
to cobalt blue as the water deepens in the center, with patches of
treacherous swamp at the edges.  Ahead of you the hills meet a mixture
of light and heavy woods. You are debating whether to climb the hills
or fight your way through the trees when the enemy mech steps over the
crest of the hill.

   Your heart leaps as you recognize a heavy Archer, just as he fires
one of his massive 20 racks of Long Range Missiles. Your Marauder is
staggered by the multiple impacts as you frantically pit your piloting
skill against 75 tons of overbalanced mech. You swivel your torso and
call up your weapons display. The reassuring green lights indicate that
all weapons are ready to fire. You select your Auto Cannon 5 and one of
your Particle Projection Cannons. A moment later your combat display
shows you your field of fire and weapon range. The targeting pipper is
blinking on the Archer as you fire your weapons up the mountain.

   The crash of your cannon tears chunks of armor from the Archer, but
the scintillating beam of the Plasma Cannon slashes to the left of the
Archer.  "Too quick" you curse under your breath. The temperature in
your cockpit jumps as the heat from firing the Plasma Cannon soaks into
your mech. No problem so far, the heat sinks can handle it. You drive
your mech into a pounding run. You've got to get close, his LRMs have a
minimum effective range, if you can just get inside it...

   The Archer is shrouded in smoke as another salvo of missiles blast
their way toward you. Missiles clang off your armor, tearing chunks
away. Your cockpit rings as one hits the head of your mech. You fight
for consciousness and keep going, his racks are empty now, he has to
reload.

   Motion, behind you. Another Combat Mech breaks from the forest and
races across the plains toward you. You quickly identify it as a light
weight Stinger, ordinarily no threat to a Marauder, but it AND an
Archer?  What to do? Run? Fight? Fight which one?

   There's no real choice, if you turn your back on the Archer he'll
nail you. Ignore the Stinger. You quickly check your status. Your heat
is dropping as the heat sinks suck away the excess heat. Your armor
indicators are still all green although those missiles have chewed away
about half of you left leg armor. Your Auto Cannon is still recycling,
but your Plasma Cannons are ready. Time to Rock an' Roll.

   Weapons select. You arm both of your Plasma Cannons. The targeting
computer comes up and you select the Archer again. Your mech is rocked
by a laser blast in its vulnerable back, but you ignore it, triggering
your Plasma Cannons. The warbling shreik of your Plasma Cannons echos
across the plains.  Blazing energy lances from each arm of your mech to
impale your enemy. The first strikes the Archer dead center where his
armor is the strongest, but the second beam scores a lucky hit on his
vulnerable head. The Archer is staggered as armor vaporizes from his
chest and head. You watch the Mech fight for balance and fail, tumbling
backward off the mountain.

   One down. Another laser digs into your back, as red lights flash on
your status display. Your back armor is breached, the laser got through
to your Auto Cannon and its out of the action. You begin to turn your
ponderous steed. As you turn to face the charging Stinger it suddenly
jumps into the air on jets of flame.

   "Damn!!!" you yell as you frantically bring up your weapons. The Auto
Cannon in your Left Torso is disabled, your Plasma Cannons are still
recycling. You're still hot, but there's no choice as you arm the two
medium lasers in your chest. You try to target the fast moving Stinger,
but before you can fire 20 tons of armor and fire power land on top of
you.

   Your mech shutters under the impact. You scramble to control it, but
you're falling. "The next time I'm in the Factory I'm putting jump jets
in this thing" you vow. The ground shakes as 75 tons of Mech falls flat
on its back. Lights are flashing all over. You bring up your status
display. The Stinger landed on your right shoulder, its out along with
all the weapons in your right arm. The fall did more damage to your
weak left leg. You'll survive, now where is that little Stinger. You
look around. The Stinger is racing for the forest.

   "Oh no you don't" you mutter as you wait for your remaining Plasma
Cannon to recycle. You target the Plasma Cannon at the racing Stinger's
back. The warbling blast echoes across the plain as your man-made
lightning bolt hits the Stinger dead center.

   The Stinger stumbles, starts to fall... a blinding flash lights the
sky as its fusion reactor explodes. Metal peppers your mech as the
concussion threatens to knock you unconscious. Your temperature gauges
peg as the mech shuts down from too much heat. With time your mech will
recover. Lets just hope the Archer has had enough.

   This is MechForce. It can be played with one person against the
computer or up to 32 people fighting in teams. You can train in the
simulator, fight in the arena, or try to complete combat missions.

MechForce Configuration
***********************

   The MechForce program use a config file located in the current
directory.  The config file named "MechForce.cfg" will preset several
variables for the game and all of the paths for the many files that the
program use.  If the config file can not be found the program will
default to directories in the current directory, it will also default
to save turned off.

   You can change the included config file with the included "ConfigEd"
program. Make sure the paths are valid paths and correct. THIS IS VERY
IMPORTANT. If the program can not find the files it need they will not
work.

   The MechForce program will look for images files in a subdirectory
called "Images" in the current directory. It will look for sound files
in "Sound", map files in "Maps", saved games in "Games", unit files in
"Units", warrior and technician files in "Warriors" and mech files in
the "Mechs" directory. In addition, it expects mechs to be subdivided
into four classes of mechs, "Light" 20-35 tons, "Medium" 40-55 tons,
"Heavy" 60-75 tons, and "Assault" 80-100 tons. If you create new mechs
and put them in the wrong subdirectory some parts of the programs will
have trouble finding your new mechs.

A word or two about memory
**************************

   MechForce is a huge program. If your system has only 512K of memory
you will be limited in the number of mechs you can load. Computer mechs
take a lot more memory than player mechs. You will probably be able to
load 24 to 32 player mechs, but if you are playing against the computer
8 player and 8 computer will probably be the limit. If your load too
many mechs there will not be enough memory left to load the sound files.

MechForce Documentation
***********************

   The first thing you will see when the game starts is a requester
asking you to select the Type of Game. The first option allows you to
Continue a Saved Game. The second option is a Simulation mode and is
used for training.  This mode allows all combinations of teams and mech
types, but damage and experience are not saved at the end of the game.
At the start of the game you will be shown a list of available orders
and you can pick the set of orders to follow. If you hit CANCEL you
will be training for the Roving Patrol mode. Arena Challenge is a One
on One combat playing against another person or the computer. If the
computer is the opponent it will pick its own mech. Arena mode will
also let you Bet on the outcome of the combat. One of Major Houses may
offer to Sponsor you in the Arena. This may offer a little protection
from other friendly houses, but it will make you a target of enemy
houses. Not having a sponsor won't keep some houses from picking on you.
This takes the form of Sabotage to your mech. The computer will check
and see if your pilot can detect any sabotage. If he does he will be
given the option to try to repair the sabotage. Sabotage may make a
critical part fail during combat. Trying to repair the sabotage may
destroy it completely. The chance of sabotage gets higher as you win
more Arena Combats. Roving Patrol is a general purpose combat option.
There is no goal other than to kill the enemy and survive. It is real
combat and you do earn a few Combat Points.  Combat Orders is like the
Simulation mode, all combinations of teams and mech types are allowed,
the difference is that damage and experience are saved at the end of
the game. The main difference is that the computer will pick the orders
randomly for your team to follow.

   Once you have selected the type of game you want to play you will
get a Team Selector. The Team Selector window contains four rows of
selector boxes. The center box contains the Team number. If you are
playing Arena or Patrol mode, only the first two rows will be active.
The Left and Right boxes in each row represent the two sides of a
combat. To put a Team on a side just click in the box. The word "Team"
and the team number will appear in the box. To change sides, click on
the other side. To remove a team, click on the same side a second time.
Once a team is placed on a side the central box becomes the selector
for the teams control device. An "M" will appear indicating that the
default control device is the Mouse. By clicking on the center box you
can also select "J" for Joystick, "K" for Keyboard and "C" for Computer
controlled. If computer control is selected, ALL teams on that side
will be computer controlled.

   The next thing you need for combat is a place to fight. If you are in
any of the combat modes the computer will randomly select one of seven
special maps. In Training or Orders mode the map will be generated
based on the type of map called for in the orders. If "Create" is
called for in the orders you will get the Random Map Control Panel See
@{"The Random Map Control Panel" Link "The Random Map Control Panel"}.

   The next thing you need are mechs to fight. Two windows will open.
The first one shows the Team you will be working with in the central
box on the bottom. The second window is a file requester for loading
mechs. There are three flavors of mechs. Generic "Mechs" are the type
you create in the HeadQuarters program with "Create a Spare Mech". The
pilot for these mechs will be randomly created by the computer.
"Warrior" files are created in the HeadQuarters program and should
contain a mech and a pilot. "Unit" files are collections of warriors,
mechs and technicians all in one common file.

   Only Simulation mode will allow a player to fight with a plain mech,
all other modes require you to use a Warrior file or a warrior from a
Unit file. All members of a team MUST be of the same mech type.
Warriors are marked when they are loaded and can not be loaded twice.
If you save a game in progress those warriors can not be used in
another game until the first game is completed.

   To load a file, click on the file you want and then click on "Load".
If the file is a plain mech you will get a requester asking you to name
the pilot. To load warriors from a Unit, Load the Unit and then select
the warrior from the list of warriors in the unit. The mechs and pilots
you selected will appear in the Team window.  When your team is
complete, click on the "Done" gadget in the file requester window and
it will disappear. At this point you can use the small selector boxes
to the right of each name to customize the control device for each
player.

   At any time your can click on a mech name with the RIGHT mouse
button and get a quick preview/status display of that mech. This can
help you avoid loading a damaged mech. You can not change the device
for a computer mech. To change teams, click the "Team" gadget. The
"Load Mechs" gadget will bring the file requester back. When you are
done with all teams, click the "Done" gadget in the team window. You
will also notice a small gadget in the upper right corner with an "R"
in it. If you make a mistake loading mechs you can click on the Reset
gadget and it will clear ALL mechs.  Then you can start over in your
selection.

   All of the windows leading up to and including the Team window have
an ESCAPE option. If you hit the ESCAPE key you will be asked if you
want to quit the game. If you say YES it will exit back to WorkBench.

   From this point on everything is controlled from a control menu at
the bottom of the screen. These menus consist of a prompt and two or
more options. The selected option will be highlighted. Control depends
on the device you are using. The Keyboard uses the Left and Right
arrows to change and the Space Bar to select. The Joystick uses Left
and Right stick command to change and the Fire Button to select. The
Mouse changes by moving the mouse over the desired option and selects
with the Left Button. The mouse will only work when it is positioned in
the menu line.

   The menus are pretty much self explanitory. There are two main menus
associated with two timers. One for Movement and one for Weapons.
Everything is based on TIME. Since there are TWO timers you can move and
fire weapons at the same time. The Wait options are especially powerful
if used properly because you can wait in weapons and still move.

Movement Menu
*************

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Walk: @{ui} Walk forward or backward one hex. Takes base time + heat
     penalty + damage penalty. The base movement time and penalty times
     can be found in the status display. Walking generates 1 pt of
     heat/second.  You can Crawl (Walk) while you are down at double
     the normal time.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Run: @{ui} Run forward. Takes 2/3 the time of Walk and generates 2
     pts of heat/second.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Jump: @{ui} Use jump jets to jump in any direction. When you select
     Jump you will be asked for the direction. "E" is to the right and
     "W" is to the left. Once you have started jumping you can only
     continue jumping in the same direction or one hex face to either
     side. If you are already jumping you will get a different menu
     that allows you to pick the next direction, turn, stop or check
     options. You can jump approximately the same number of hexes you
     can walk in 100 seconds.  This is a jump time of about 67 seconds.
     This may be less if you have fewer jump ports than the maximum
     allowed.

     Every time you damage a jump port you loose one hex of range.
     Remember that you jump slower if you are hot so you may not get
     your max range. If you are still jumping when you run out of jump
     time you will CRASH!!! Once you land you can not jump again for
     100 seconds from the time you STARTED jumping. The main menu will
     say "Jump (OK)" if you are ready to jump. It will say "Jump (No)"
     if your mech can not jump. It will say "Jump (xx)" with the number
     of seconds until your jump jets are ready again, if you are
     recycling.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Turn: @{ui} Change direction 60 degrees (one hex side). Time is
     based on whether you are standing, walking or running. Turning
     while jumping is handled in the jump menu and takes no time. You
     can turn while you are down at double the normal time.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Stand: @{ui} Stand up after your mech has fallen down. Standing
     takes the same time as moving one normal hex.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Wait: @{ui} Wait is used to control the timing of events in the
     Move timer. You can wait On Time, wait until you Call Move, wait
     until all of your weapons are recycled or the next weapon is
     recycled or your arms&legs are recycled, wait until your heat
     drops to a certain point (color), wait on your weapon selection,
     or wait on your enemies move. If no enemies are visible you will
     be given the option to wait on the next mech to become visible.
     You can chose to wait on the next Visible mech with the 'Visible'
     option. Beware, if all mechs are visible this acts the same as a
     Wait On Call.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Call Attack: @{ui} This option will call the attack menu if it is
     waiting. You can also 'Call Attack' from the Options menu and
     interrupt any attack WAIT command. 'Call Attack' sets a flag, but
     leaves you in the move menu.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Options: @{ui} This option brings up another menu of special
     options.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Status: @{ui} Status will bring up your status display window.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Identify: @{ui} The Identify option will allow you to click
     individual mech images to identify their type and weight. You have
     to option for a full Status Display.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Break Attack: @{ui} Break Attack will interrupt an attack in
     progress.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Break Move: @{ui} The Break Move option will interrupt a move in
     progress.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Special: @{ui} The Special option calls another menu with five more
     options.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Drop Ammo: @{ui} The Drop Ammo option will ask you if you want to
     drop each ammo rack in your mech.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Eject: @{ui} Is used to leave a badly damaged mech. There is a skill
     roll for Ejecting from a mech. If you fail your pilot takes
     damage. You eject into the hex in front of your mech. DON'T eject
     into a forest fire. You will also have to make a Survival roll to
     keep from being captured.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Surrender: @{ui} This means that you stay with your mech, but you
     have quit fighting. If your side loses captured mechs and pilots
     belong to the winning side.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Self-Destruct: @{ui} The Self-Destruct option makes the
     thermonuclear engine of your mech explode. This option can only be
     used by Player characters that have advanced beyond the "Green"
     rank. You can not Surrender or Eject of you are Unconscious or
     your mech is Shutdown due to heat.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Orders: @{ui} The Orders option will give you you a brief review of
     your Orders.  Options do not take any time.

Weapon Menu
***********

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Weapon: @{ui} Brings up the weapon select display. This display
     shows all weapons, including arms and legs, where they are located
     ( LT=Left Torso, etc), and their condition. If the status
     indicator is green they are ready to use. Red indicates damaged or
     out of ammo. Yellow means they are recycling and is a bar graph of
     how long until ready to use again.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Wait: @{ui} Use this to control the timing of events in the Weapons
     timer. You can wait On Time, wait On Call, wait on your current
     move, wait until all your weapons are recycled or your first
     weapon to recycle or your arms&legs are recycled, wait until your
     heat drops to a certain color, or wait On Enemy move.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Call Move: @{ui} This option will call the movement menu if it is
     waiting. You can also 'Call Move' from the Options menu and
     interrupt any movement WAIT command.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Options: @{ui} This is the same as the Move Options except the time
     comes off the weapons timer.

   The movement and weapons timers are separate so you can move and fire
weapons simultaneously. The wait conditions allow rapid movement without
bothersome weapons messages, or standing still and firing, without
bothersome move messages. For even more accurate timing you can use the
Break feature and then Break Move or Break Attack from Options menu
item. The Options items are also available as pulldown menus at the top
of the screen. There is a small experience penalty for using the Break
Attack and Break Move options from the pulldown menus. You can still
shoot at Surrendered, Ejected and Dead mech. You can not shoot at
Escaped or Destroyed mechs.

     save the game map only to a file that can be used in another game.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Sound: @{ui} Toggles the sound on and off. If you didn't have enough
     memory to load the sound files this will start as "Silent".

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Setup: @{ui} Brings up a window that lets you change the speed of
     missiles and the delay for messages. It will also display the name
     of the first player and his Input Device. By Clicking on the Name
     you can flip through each player. By Clicking on the Device you
     can flip through the devices. This allows you to change player
     Input Devices during the game.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Color: @{ui} Changes the color of Mechs from Red to White. This if
     for some people that have trouble telling the difference between
     red and green.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Quit: @{ui} Allows you to quit a game in progress. For most real
     combats this option is disabled.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Team Menus: @{ui} Each player team has a pulldown menu with all of
     the members of that team as items. If the team is computer
     controlled you must use the "Identify" option to find out about
     enemy mechs. If the computer mech is not visible on the screen you
     will not be able to identify its status display. There is a small

Skill Rolls
***********

   While moving or in combat you will occassionally be asked to make a
skill roll. This means that something has made your mech off balance
(slipping in water, heavy weapons hit) and you as a pilot must roll to
see if your skill is sufficient to keep from falling down. Falling in
heavy mech is not trivial. The mech will take damage equal to its
weight divided by 10.  If you roll down a mountain this is multiplied
by the number of levels you fall. Landing in water cuts your damage in
half. All damage is applied in groups of 5 points all over your body.
Landing on your head can ruin your day. Crashing is the same as falling
only from three levels up (triple damage). When you are asked to make a
skill roll there will be an option to "Modify" your skill roll. If you
select this option you can trade experience points for an improved
skill roll. This is expensive, but in critical situations it could save
your life. If you use it too much you will not have any experience to
improve your character. The computer can also modify its rolls and you
may see a "modified+2" occasionally.

   Firing weapons requires a skill roll vs your Gunnery skill to hit
your target. You can modify this roll also. If you miss a shot there is
a chance that you might hit someone else in an adjacent hex. There are
also skill rolls for being knocked unconscious, shutting down due to
heat and ammo explosions due to heat.

The Random Map Control Panel
****************************

   The Random Map Control Panel is a little complicated. It contains six
slider gadgets. The top three control the percentage of Forest,
Mountains and Water in your map. The bottom gadget controls the density
of the top three. A cluster is one group of woods or mountains or
water. It can be one hex or many hexes. The more clusters you have the
more details you will have in your map. The Sand and Snow requesters
control the amount of sand and snow in you map. Sand and snow are added
by replacing whatever plain hexes are left after the forest, mountains
and water hexes are added. The gadget controls the percentage of plain
hexes that will be replaced. Sand replaces hexes in the bottom half of
the map and snow replaces hexes in the top half.  Once you have
everything set the way you want it, click the "Create" gadget and your
world will be drawn. A small window will then appear asking you to
comfirm your world, "OK", or try again, "ReDo".

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Light Forest: @{ui} It takes twice as long to move through light
     forest as across plains, and makes you one point harder to hit.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Heavy Forest: @{ui} It takes three times as long to move through
     heavy forest and you are two points harder to hit.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Jungle: @{ui} You can not move thru this hex. It is possible to jump
     over it, but if you land in a Jungle hex the only way out is to
     jump. Jungle hexes can be burned.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Swamp: @{ui} It takes twice as long to move, you are one point
     easier to hit, and there is a good chance of slipping and falling.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Shallow Water: @{ui} This type hex takes twice as long to move
     through and makes it easier for you to be hit and harder for you
     to hit others, but helps you to cool down. The water will remove 3
     points of heat per second in addition to your heat sinks. There is
     a chance you will slip and fall.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Medium Water: @{ui} This type water is up to the mechs waist.
     Weapons below the waist can not be fired. You get 6 points of
     cooling per second, but you are easier to hit and it is harder for
     you to aim. You can't kick in medium water. Move at 1/3 normal
     rate.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Deep Water: @{ui} This type water provides 9 points of
     cooling/second.  Weapons below the neck can not be fired and you
     are very hard to hit. You can't kick or punch in deep water. Move
     at 1/4 normal rate.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Bottomless Water: @{ui} This type water is beyond your mechs
     capability.  It will crush your mech, destroying it and killing
     you. The only way past this type of hex is to jump over.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Low Hills: @{ui} Hills provide cover. You can't shoot over them.
     Low hills make it one point easier to hit mechs below you. Move at
     1/3 normal rate uphill or half normal rate on the same level.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Medium Hills: @{ui} You get two extra points to hit mechs below you
     due to height. Move at 2 + 1/level going uphill.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}High Hills: @{ui} You get three extra points to hit mechs below you
     due to height. Hills have a tactical advantage, but beware of
     skill rolls.  If you fall you can roll all the down, doing
     multiple damage.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Barrier Peak: @{ui} This hex type is impassible. You can not jump
     over it. It is used for obstacles. All Arena maps have a border of
     Barrier Peaks.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Fire: @{ui} Energy and Missile weapons can start forest fires.
     Moving or stopping in a forest fire adds a 6 points of heat per
     second to your mech, and the smoke adds three points on all hit
     rolls. Move at half normal rate.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Cleared: @{ui} Cannons and Missiles can clear trees from forest
     hexes.  This is rough terrain, move at half normal rate. Cannons
     and Missiles can also be used to 'blow out' forest fires.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Burned: @{ui} Once a forest fire has burned out the hex becomes
     rough terrain. Move at half normal rate.

   Terrain plays an important part in combat strategy. A good position
can mean the difference between winning and loosing. Use the terrain to
your advantage. If you try to leave the map area you will be asked if
your wish to ESCAPE from the combat. If you say Yes, your mech will be
removed at the end of the move and you are out of the game. Forests are
much harder to see through at ground level. If you are at ground level
and the mech you are trying to see is also at ground level you can only
see through three light woods or one light and one heavy woods.

Combat HEAT Affects
*******************

   Almost everything you do in a Combat Mech creates heat. It is your
worse enemy. Heat can slow down your mech, throw off your targeting
computers, cause your mech to shutdown unexpectedly (that right, you're
a sitting duck), and even cause ammo to explode. Watch your heat. The
Status display gives the amount of heat generated by each weapon in
hundreds. Ten heat means it generates 1000 points of heat. The actual
temperature is in the Status display. In addition, there is a small
status light in the upper right corner of the weapons selection window.
Green=OK, Blue=reduced movement/aim, Yellow=danger of shutdown,
Red=danger of ammo exploding. Your Combat Mech will automatically
shutdown if your heat goes over 3000. In addition, a damaged engine
generates 5 points of heat per second for each hit. The only thing that
protects a pilot from the heat is the life support system. If that is
destroyed you are in big trouble.

Combat
******

   There are two forms of combat, weapons combat and melee combat. Melee
combat is hand to hand, punching, kicking and charging. Melee combat
doesn't generate any heat, but you may do damage to yourself and you
have to be in the same hex or in the adjacent hex. When used to fight,
your arms and legs have recycle times just like your other weapons.
Legs take 25 seconds and arms take 10 seconds. Both legs must be ready
in order to kick so you can only kick with one leg, however a kick does
twice as much damage as a punch.  If you miss a kick you have to make a
Piloting Skill roll to keep from falling. On the other hand if you
connect with a kick the kickee has to make a Piloting Skill roll. If
you are jumping when you kick you will have to make a skill roll. If
you fail your skill roll you will crash.

   Damage is based on the weight of the attacking mech. A 50 ton mech
can do 10 points of damage kicking and 5 points punching. To punch or
kick simply select the arm or leg you want from the weapons selection
window. The arm or leg must be ready and in working condition. If the
status light to the right is RED it means that that limb is too damaged
to be used in melee.  The numbers after arm/leg status in the status
display give an indication of that limbs condition. The first number is
the modifier on 'to hit' for weapons in the limb. The second number is
a damage indicator. If it is over 6 the limb can't be used. You can
select multiple weapons so you could punch with both arms and kick with
one leg in the same attack. You can not kick and fire any weapons in
the same attack. You can not punch and fire any weapon located in that
arm in the same attack.

   When one mech attempts to move into the hex occupied by another mech,
that is a charge. You must have both arms and both legs recycled and in
good condition to walk or run charge. You must have both legs in good
condition to jump charge. If your limbs aren't ready or damaged you
won't be allowed to move into the other hex for the charge.

   Charging can do massive damage. The damage is based on speed for
walking and running charges. Your speed is the TIME it takes to walk or
run one normal hex, divided into 100. This is modified by terrain and
can be a fraction. The time is modified by heat and the damage to your
legs. The damage is spread out in groups of 5 points. The charging mech
takes damage equal to the weight of the mech charged divided by 10. A
charge that hits requires both mechs to make a Skill roll at +2 or
fall. You can NOT walk or run charge a mech that is down.

   A jumping charge is called "Death from Above". Damage is the
attacking mechs weight divided by 10, times three. An 80 ton mech
jumping on you can do 24 points of damage. Damage is divided in half
and each half applied to a random point in the upper torso, as though
he kicked twice. The charging mech takes damage equal to his weight
divided by 10, equally applied to his two legs.

   To do a jumping charge, jump into the opponents hex and stop. All
charges that hit require both mechs to make a Piloting Skill roll, the
attacker at +2 and the defender at +2. Only the attacker makes a skill
roll if the charge misses, but it is at +6. You CAN jump on a mech that
is down.

   If both mechs are jumping in the same hex there is a chance of a
collision. This is not an attack and the computer rolls for whether a
collision took place based on both pilots skill. If the mechs collide,
both mechs must make a skill roll or fall and crash.

   Melee is also dependant on the terrain. If you are too high above or
too low below a mech you can't melee. If you are one level above you can
only kick him. If you are one level below you can only punch him.

   Weapon combat is fairly selfexplanitory. Pick the weapons you want
from the weapons selection window. That arms the weapons. You can select
multiple weapons. When you select a weapon a pink number will appear
beside the status indicator. This number is the order in which the
weapons will be fired. Two seconds later the targeting computer will
display a firing fan for that weapon. The firing fan will show your
field of fire for chest mounted weapons and the weapons maximum range,
and for some weapons the minimum range. Weapons mounted in the left arm
can fire one hex side further to the left and weapons mounted in the
right arm can fire one hex side further to the right. This means that
arm mounted weapons can fire directly behind you if you swivel. THIS
CAN BE VERY HANDY. You can fire inside the minimum range, but at a
penalty to hit. The menu bar will list the last mech you fired at and
several options. The left and right arrow scrolls through ALL enemy
mechs. The "OK" option picks the current mechs as the target. The
"Side" option allows you to select a mech on your side as the target.
"Cancel" cancels the attack. "Hex" allows you to shoot at hexes.

   The mech name might be colored. This is a status indicator for the
mech. "Red" indicates that the mech is dead. "Blue" is destroyed.
"Pink" is shutdown or the pilot is unconscious. "Yellow" is surrendered
and "Green" means the mech has escaped off the screen. Select your
target to activate the firing sequence. Two seconds later the weapons
will fire. As each weapon comes up you will have the option to "Fire"
the weapon, "Pass" on that one weapon, or "Modify" your gunnery skill
roll. Hit locations will be flashed in the menu bar. If you miss a shot
there is a chance that you could hit a mech next to your target by
mistake.

   Various objects are part of some scenarios. If your goal is to
destroy the object you must be in the same hex with the object. You can
then fire at it with weapons or kick and punch it. If your goal is to
recover an object you will notice that all mechs with hands have an "H"
in the status display next to the arm status. When you bring up the
weapons menu those arms with hands will be listed as "Punch/Grab". If
you select an arm with a hand the targeting menu will list the name of
the object as an option. If you select the object your attack will give
you a roll to pick up the object. If you are carrying an object your
weapons menu will say "Punch/Drop". You can use the same procedure to
drop an object with one or both hands. While carrying an object any
stagger roll will also require a roll for dropping the object.
Dropping an object will cause damage to the object.

   Terrain is important in weapon combat. You can't shoot through
mountains so being on top of a mountain is a strategic advantage.
Forests provide cover, but they can be set on fire or cleared of trees
by concentrated fire. Water provide a good barrier from a charging
mech. You can sometimes start fires by aiming at a forest hex. You can
also blow out fires by shooting a fire hex with missiles or cannons. To
shoot at a hex select HEX as the target of any weapon attack. You will
then be asked to select the hex with the mouse. Click in the menu line
to cancel the attack.

   The main objective of combat is to eliminate the opponents armor so
that your weapons can damage delicate internal components, like the
pilot. Once the armor in a particular location is destroyed any further
damage in that area hits something inside. The computer rolls a 2d6. If
it is less than 8 the damage is applied to the Internal Structure of
the mech. If it is 8 or higher one of the internal locations is hit.
The internal locations contain such things as weapons, ammo, arm and
leg joints, heat sinks, engines, gyros, PILOTS, etc. One or more hits
will destroy an internal component.

   The internal structure has points like the armor. These points are
shown in the Status Display right after the area name and before the
list of internal components. If the internal structure is reduced to
zero that area is Destroyed and ALL components in it cease to function.
If it is the head or limbs, the area is ripped off. If it is the center
torso there is a 50/50 chance the engine will explode. Whether the
engine explodes or not it stops working and the game is over for that
mech. If a mechs engine explodes or its head is shot off the pilot will
get a chance for an emergency eject.  Don't expect to survive, but you
will have a chance.

A word about Orders
*******************

   There are nine basic types of goals. These can be used in various
combinations to create orders. At the end of the game your experience
money and Combat Points will be determined on how well you completed
the goal for your side. The criteria for each goal are:

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Kill Everything: @{ui} You get 100% if all mechs are dead or
     disabled. You get 0% if any mechs survive or escaped.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Scout/Patrol: @{ui} At least one mech must survive/escape to answer
     ALL questions for the report at the end. If your side escapes
     leaving enemy mechs in control of the field your success is the
     ratio of the number of surviving mech divided into the number that
     went at LEAST half across the screen (to the dividing line).

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Recover, Find/Recover or Convoy Object: @{ui} You fail if the
     object is destroyed or captured by the other side. If you get the
     object you a percentage based on how badly the object is damaged.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Destroy or Find/Destroy Object: @{ui} You get 100% if the object is
     destroyed.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Convoy Across: @{ui} Your success is measured by the number of
     mechs that successfully reach the opposite side.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Hold Position: @{ui} If at least half you all operational mechs
     have stayed in position (inside the circle) for the required time
     you are 100% successful (even if everyone dies after that).

Internal Components
*******************

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Weapons (W): @{ui} Destroyed with any hit.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Ammo (A): @{ui} Destroyed with any hit. The ammo will blow up doing
     internal damage to the mech.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Arm and Leg Actuators (x): @{ui} Destroyed with any hit. Leg hits
     will require a Pilot Skill roll to keep from falling. The status
     of your arms and legs is given in the status display. The first
     number is the modifier to hit for weapons in the limb. The second
     number is a weighted actuator damage. If it is over 6 the limb is
     unusable.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Engine (E): @{ui} Each hit causes the engine to generate 5 points
     per second of extra heat. There is a chance on ANY hit that the
     fusion engine will blow up. The odds are very good by three hits
     and 100% by four hits.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Gyro (G): @{ui} A gyro hit adds 3 points to all Pilot Skill rolls.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Jump Jets Ports (P): @{ui} Destroyed with any hit. Each hit
     destroys that port and reduces your jump range one hex.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Life Support (L): @{ui} Any hit destroys the life support system
     for the mechs cockpit. The mech pilot will take one point of
     damage every 50 seconds that the heat is over 1500. If the heat is
     over 2500 he will take two points of damage.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Sensors (S): @{ui} The first hit on sensors add 2 points to all
     Gunnery Skill rolls to hit targets. A second hit destroys your
     sensors and you can not hit anything with your weapons. It is
     still possible to melee.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Cockpit (C): @{ui} Any hit in the cockpit kills the pilot. End of
     Game.

Hidden Commands
***************

   Hidden Commands

   There are several hidden commands in the "Setup" window. With the
"Setup" window active the following keys act as toggles:

   "a" - Toggles Aimed Shots On/Off for ALL mechs.

   "r" - Toggles ALL Recycle Times to ZERO.

   "q" - Will Quit the game without saving mechs. This will leave you
pilots "Out on Patrol". They can be brought back with the  HeadQuarters
program, but it will cost you some money and will be  counted as a loss
on your combat record.
