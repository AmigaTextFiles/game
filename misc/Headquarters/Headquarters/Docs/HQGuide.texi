This software is similar to BATTLETECH ® A Game of Armored Combat.

"Strap yourself into the ultimate suit of armor -- the BattleMech:
thirty feet tall and weighing up to a hundred tons. This humanoid
engine of destruction you control is a walking arsenal with enough
firepower to level a city. The BattleTech game system takes you into
the world of the 31st century, where war has become a way of life,
and great empires and tiny factions struggle among themselves for
control of humankind."

A Brief History of the BattleTech Universe.

In the years immediately following the second World War, the Virtual
Geographic League (TM) gradually began to re-emerge as an active scientific
institution. Many of the leading atomic scientists and engineers of the day
recoiled in horror at the weapons of mass destruction that they helped to
create. The VGL offered a much-needed home to those seeking peaceful
applications for these powerful new technologies.

One of these men was George Markov, J. Robert Oppenheimer's chief
lieutenant on the Manhattan Project and the man principally responsible
for the engineering breakthrough which turned Einstein's theories into
reality. Due to his impassioned pacifist speeches to the House Un-American
Activities Committee, Markov was essentially unemployable when Einstein
invited him to lecture at Princeton in 1949. Within six months, he was
running VGL Labs and sending unmanned camera ships on split-second
reconnaissance missions.

At the same time on the other side of the world, a young jet-jockey
named Sid Mandlebaum was making a name for himself in the skies over Korea.
There was more to this pilot than an unusual name -- he was the first Jewish
graduate of West Point, a military man by trade, and he shot down six MIGs
in a single 1952 mission. He was also the youngest colonel in the armed
services when Lindbergh recruited him into the VGL in 1959. Mandlebaum
gave the name "BattleTech" to the futuristic technology he saw in the
Unv.-137 camera pod photos. During this time Einstein and Markov were able
to discover a consistent link to dozens of human colonies in space some two
thousand years into the future, emboldening the League to chance new manned
missions. On his third mission Mandlebaum became the first VGL pilot to
exit his vehicle while in a virtual world. On his fourteenth mission, he
disappeared.

When a VGL reconnaissance team finally found Mandlebaum a decade later
he had gone completely native, having embarked on a new life as an elite
Master MechWarrior. While he refused to return to our world, he did provide
numerous technical documents he had been collecting along with a book he
authored: Inside the BattleTech Universe.
These technical manuals have enabled the VGL and its pilots to achieve safe
and consistent translocations into any one of the dozens of
Inner Sphere BattleMechs (TM). Our gratitude to him is immeasurable and
his deeds will live long in the storied history of the VGL. Sid's only
request to the Board of Directors was that we look after his family here
on Earth - a duty we do proudly.

@node The Unit Window
@chapter The Unit Window
@cindex The Unit Window

The main window you see is the Unit window. Units come in different flavors. 
There are Player Units which can only have Player characters in them, 
and NPC Units which can have both Player and NPC characters. 
Units have a fixed number of Warriors, either 4, 8, 12, 24 or 36. 
Player Units can have up to 50 Warrior, Technician and Mech files. 
NPC Units don't change. The best way to play the game is to 
start in a good NPC Unit until you gain a little experience. 
Then you can branch out and form your own player Unit.

In addition to player vs NPC Unit, there are also Mercenary vs House
Units. A Mercenary Unit sells it services to a House, under a contract.
It must fulfill its contract before it changes employer or lose reputation.
A Mercenary Unit that does not have a contract has no way to get more money
from repairs other than through combat. The contract will specify how much
the Unit will be paid per combat point, how many combat points the Unit must
earn to complete it contract, what percentage of the combat damage the House
will pay and what percentage of the Salvage the Unit may keep. Mercenary
Units must find their own replacements for lost mechs. A House Unit is given
everything, all repairs, replacement mechs, etc. In exchange a House Unit
can never change employer, warriors are paid a straight salary, and they do
not collect salvage.

To form a Unit, use the pulldown menu and select "New...".
In the upcomming window you must at least enter a name for the new Unit.
If you do not specify a Warrior as the leader for a Unit,
the Unit will have no C-Bills at all.
Once the Unit is formed new characters must 'Join' the Unit, and a roll 
is required for acceptance. Make sure to setup the contracts for the Unit 
and its individual warriors before you start adding members. Make sure you 
name the Unit before you try to get a contract. Player Units and NPC Units 
will be allowed to set the starting size of the Unit and its reputation.

Whenever you load a Unit all Destroyed mechs will be removed.

In a listview selector you will see a list of all warriors, mechs and 
technicians. Sometimes you will see a '*' behind characters and Mechs names.
This will show you that a character and its Mech are out on patrol and are
currently not available. A '#' behind characters and Mechs names will
indicate that a character has been injured or a Mech has been damaged.
If one of the characters has died then a '+' will apear behind the
name of that character.

You can change the Unit Name by clicking in the name gadget.

"Add Character" allows you to add members to the Unit to replace lost 
characters. "Remove Character" allows you to remove a member of the Unit.
The person removed will be saved to disk as an individual character and 
can be used somewhere else or deleted.
Characters that are using a Mech will be removed with the Mech they are
assigned to. 

"Buy new Mech" allows you to buy new Mechs for the Unit. Characters can
change to that Mech. Another way to get Mechs is to salvage them after a
won combat.

"Unit Stores" allows you to buy replacement parts for your mechs. 
The purpose is to provide a system for campaignes. You can buy Units 
stores for a campaign and then worry about running out of the parts 
you need to keep your mechs in working condition.

@section Unit Affiliation/Fee
@cindex Unit Affiliation/Fee

You can change the Unit Affiliation or Contract, but if the Unit is a 
House Unit or have not completed the original contract you will lower 
the Unit reputation and lose some C-Bills. The Unit reputation affects 
the kind of contract you can get. It is based on you win/loss 
ratio and the rank of the characters and is checked every time you load 
the Unit into Headquarters.

You will get better contracts the better the Unit reputation is.

@node The Warrior Window
@chapter The Warrior Window
@cindex The Warrior Window

The Warrior allows you to make Warriors, Technicians, etc. characters.
Warriors are a combination of a character and a mech. There are two 
types of characters. Player character and Non-Player character (NPC).
And several character classes. 
The Mech Warrior is the standard character used for piloting a Mech.
Technicians can not pilot a Mech and gain experience points only by repairing 
Mechs and slavaging Mech parts.
Doctors are used for healing characters.

@node Player Characters
@section Player Characters
@cindex Player Characters

Player characters, Warriors, Technicians, etc. roll for their starting
character points and start off as zero level, or green characters.
The number of character points a character gets at the beginning will vary
randomly. You can try as often as you want, but if you are playing in a
group you should establish ground rules. Around here we allow a person 
two chances at a character.

Once you have a character created you can use the initial character points
to upgrade character attributes and skills.
You can 'buy' abilities and skills for your character.
Later, you will be able to exchange experience for more character points to
further improve your character.

"Body" is the amount of damage the character can take. Your character
hit points is ten times your Body. Body affects your physical skills such as
Brawling and Survival. "Dexterity" is how well you move, yours sense of
balance and your eye hand coordination. It affects your weapons abilities
and piloting abilities. "Learn" is how easily you can pick up technical
skills, such as piloting, leadership and mech repair. Learn also determines
how many skills your character can 'learn'. You are allowed one skill for
each point of Learn and you allowed four skill levels for each point of
Learn. "Charisma" is how other people see you, physically and personality.
This attribute affects your ability to deal with other people, such as
leadership. For a pilot Dexterity and Learn are the most important since
they determine you piloting skill and gunnery skill. For a technician Learn
is the most important since in determines your ability to repair mechs.

@node NPC Characters
@section NPC Characters
@cindex NPC Characters

NPC characters are just like Player characters except you can make them
any level you want. On the other hand they are FIXED characters. They do not
go up in level and can never be changed after they are created. 

@node Healing Characters
@section Healing Characters
@cindex Healing Characters

A injured character can be healed. The higher the Rank of the character 
the higher the amount of C-Bills you need for healing.

If your character is Dead, held Hostage or out in a
combat somewhere a requester will inform you. If your character is out you
will be asked if you want to bring him home. It cost 5000 C-Bills to bring a
character back and will be counted as a lose combat.
You should be careful doing it. If your character is in a
Saved Game somewhere and you bring him back, later, when you finish the game,
your old character will overwrite anything you do to the one that you brought
back. The idea is not to have two copies of your character running around.

@node Training Characters
@section Training Characters
@cindex Training Characters

Characters can be trained if they have enough
character points. To earn character points you must convert available
experience points earned in combat. Every character can be trained in
all skills. The maximal skill level for all skills depends on 
@dfn{Learn Ability}.

@node Advance to next level
@section Advance to next level
@cindex Advance to next level

If a character has enough experience points he can advance to the next 
Rank. This will give him additional character points that can 
be used for buying skills. There are 4 Ranks and several Elite levels.

Ranking and experience points needed:

@itemize @bullet
@item @dfn{Green}   -        0-2500 experience points;
@item @dfn{Regular} -    2500-15000 experience points;
@item @dfn{Veteran} -  15000-100000 experience points;
@item @dfn{Elite}   - 100000-300000 experience points;
@item @dfn{Elite 1} - 300000-400000 experience points;
@item Next Elite Rank     +100000 experience points;
@end itemize

The only Update available for NPC characters is to change
Units or, if he has lost a mech, to get a new mech.

@node Upgrade Character Attributes
@section Upgrade Character Attributes
@cindex Upgrade Character Attributes

There are 4 character Attributes: 
Body, Dexterity, Learn Ability and Charisma.
They describe the personality of a character. Every attribute
will give a character special abilities. There are 12 levels in
each Attribute. Body is needed to survive and affects the hit
points of a character. Dexterity will give a character the ability to
act better as a Technician. Learn Ability affects the maximum
skill level allowed for all character skills. Charisma allows
a character to act better as a Mech Warrior. These attributes
will be randomized when you create new characters and will give them
their special personality.

@node Upgrade Character Skills
@section Upgrade Character Skills
@cindex Upgrade Character Skills

There are 24 skills in that a character can be trained. 
Each skill has 12 levels. To upgrade a skill the character 
needs character points.

A Mech Warrior will buy all Gunnery, Mech and Piloting skills first.
A Technician will need also everything that has to do with repairing 
Mechs and tuning engines and weapons. 
Leaders of a Unit must be trained in combat Tactics and Leadership too.
Consider well which skills your character will need first and save
charcter points for these skills. 

@node Convert Experience Points
@section Convert Experience Points
@cindex Convert Experience Points

The available experience points are the experience points
you have earned in combat. These experience points are also used
in combat for modifying weapons and skill rolls.
You can convert this experience points to character points
which you need to buy skills.
It is adviced to have some experience points left for modifying
weapons and skill rolls when they are needed.

@node Change Mech
@section Change Mech
@cindex Change Mech

All characters can be assigned to a Mech. If a Unit owns more Mechs
then currently assigned, a character can change to one of these Mechs.

@node Buy Xtended Mech
@section Buy Xtended Mech
@cindex Buy Xtended Mech

Characters with lots of C-Bills can buy one
of 9 special designed Mechs contained in Headquarters. This
Mechs are exclusively contained in Headquarters. Some of
this Mechs are also contained on disk but are not as powerful
these. A lot of them can't be modified further more.
Every Mech has its own special power.

@node The Factory Window
@chapter The Factory Window
@cindex The Factory Window

In the Factory window the design of your combat Mech is entirely up to you.
Its design should be a compromise between weight, speed, armor and weapons.
In addition, the Factory can be used to repair damaged mechs and to Salvage 
badly damaged mechs. It is adviced to use Technicians in the Factory,
they can earn some experience points here.

The main Factory window will display the current mech in three areas.
The top left area lists all the armor for the mech, the point value of its 
internal structure and where all the internal components are located. 
Each dot or letter represents one internal location. This is where your 
W)eapons, A)mmo and H)eat Sinks will be
installed. It also shows your where your E)ngine and G)yro are located in
the center torso. J)ump J)ets and F)uel are located in the side torsos. The
head contains the C)ockpit for the pilot, L)ife support systems and weapon
S)ensors. An "x" indicates an arm or leg actuator and a "." indicates an
empty location. 

@itemize @bullet
@item @dfn{W} - Weapon;
@item @dfn{A} - Ammo;
@item @dfn{H} - Heat Sink;
@item @dfn{P} - Power Jump;
@item @dfn{F} - Full Jump;
@item @dfn{E} - Engine;
@item @dfn{G} - Gyro;
@item @dfn{L} - Life Support;
@item @dfn{C} - Cockpit;
@item @dfn{S} - Sensor;
@end itemize

The bottom area lists all weapons selected for your mech
along with statistics for the weapons. The first two letters indicate where
the weapon is mounted (if its mounted). So HD would be head, CT, center
torso, etc. If there is an "*" in front of the name that indicates the the
weapon is mounted to fire backwards.
After that you will see the weapon name, the amount of
ammo available for that weapon, damage produced when it hits a
target, heat produced when firing this weapon and the maximum
and minimum range, if any, for a weapon. If a weapon needs
no ammo, as Lasers do, you will not see the ammo available for
that weapon.

If something has been damaged you will see a '-' in the Mech
structure and a '--' in the weapon list.

Sometimes you will notice that some mech-parts
have changed its colors. The color stands for:

@itemize @bullet
@item @dfn{Black}  - Good condition
@item @dfn{Yellow} - Warning on condition
@item @dfn{Red}    - Danger on condition
@end itemize

Any damaged areas will appear in Red.

In the lower right corner of the window you will see the combat 
classification information about your mech. You can use it as a
relative measure of the strength of a mech.
The size of a Mech is a indicator for the weight in
tons of a Mech and it special class. The engine size describes
the power the fusion engine has. Weapon Capability is the
maximum damage produced on an opponent when firing all the
weapons this Mech has at once. Melee Capability describes the
capability this Mech has in hand to hand combat. Defense Capability
tells you how many armour this Mech has and how long a Warrior
can defend himself when he is under attack. Finally cost describes
the amount of C-Bills needed when buying such a Mech.

@node Repair Mech
@section Repair Mech
@cindex Repair Mech

Normally a Technician is used to repair Mechs, but also other characters
are able to repair a Mech if they have been trained in technician skills.
A repair roll is performed everytime one of your characters is trying to
repair a Mech. The computer will check with your
technician to see if the item is repairable. If it is not repairable you
will have take a replacement part out of Unit Stores or, if you are using a
Warrior, buy a new part. Replacement is guaranteed to work, but cost 10
times as much as repair. Repair is a lot cheaper than replacement, but it
may not work the first time. You can try to repair as often as you want as
long as you don't damage the part beyond repair. Depending on how good your
technician is, there is a small chance that a repaired item may fail during
combat. The Technician gets experience for each successful repair. For
Units the cost to repair and re-arm your mech may be paid in part or in full
by your employer, depending on you Unit contract.

@node Re-arm Weapon
@section Re-arm Weapon
@cindex Re-arm Weapon

"Reload" checks the current mech and replaces all ammo used in combat.
It is an all or nothing item. You can't partially reload ammo. For Unit,
the correct ammo must be available in Unit Stores.

@node Mount Weapon
@section Mount Weapon
@cindex Mount Weapon

"Mount" allows you to arm your combat Mech. You will see a list of all 
weapons available along with their weight, damage, heat generated and 
ammo rounds/ton. Add a weapon by clicking on the weapon. Select the mount
area for the weapona and the mount area for the ammo, if any.

To mount a weapon in the back direction,
hold down the right mouse button and select the mount area in the
appropriate menu by clicking with the left mouse button.

The mounted location is shown in the listview before the
name. An asterick '*' indicates that the weapon is pointed backward.

@node Remove Weapon
@section Remove Weapon
@cindex Remove Weapon

"Remove" will remove a weapon from your weapons list and
unmount it if necessary. 

@node Modify Weapon
@section Modify Weapon
@cindex Modify Weapon

With "Modify" you can change the ammo, the damage and
the heat produced if a weapon is fired, the minimal and maximal
range and the critical hit for a weapon. You must select a weapon
in the listview for doing this.

@node New Mech Creation
@section New Mech Creation
@cindex New Mech Creation

Select "New..." from the menuand a 20 Ton Mech will be created.
This Mech will have neither weapons nor body armour.
Creating new Mechs is almost free, if you are a Mercenary or House Unit.
Otherwise you have to supply all the internal components in the Unit
Stores.

You can modify this mech to your hearts content. 
You can not modify Armor, Heat Sinks or Jump Jets that are damaged. 
As a general rule everything should be repaired before you modify. 
If you modify a damaged mech your total weight
may be too heavy when you finally repair the damage.

In fact if your actual weight goes more than five tons over your frame weight, your frame
weight will be automatically increased by five tons. You can have a mech
with a little extra weight. These tend to be a little unstable in combat
with better piloting skill needed to control them on occasion.

The "Image" of the Mech should be changed. 
You can select the image your mech will use during the game by clicking on
the image you want. The image you selected will appear in the main window.

Once you have your weight the next thing you should get is the "Engine".
There are only certain engines available. The engine power determines the
speed of your mech. The speed of a mech is the time, in seconds, that a mech
will take to move one plain hex. The other pair of numbers tells you how
many plain hexes you can walk or run in 100 seconds.

"Jump Jets" allow your mech to jump into the air. This is a BIG
advantage in combat at close range. How far you can jump is determined by
how far you can walk. You can jump the same number of hexes that you walk in
100 seconds. The number for jump is the number of hexes under perfect
conditions. It gets less for heat and damage.

"Heat Sinks" get rid of the heat your mech generates. Heat is your
worse enemy. All mechs have 12 heat sinks as part of the engine and you can
add more. You can "Change" and "Install" the number of heat sinks you
want, but only the amount of free spares "." is allowed. This is done
automatically for you.
To remove a heat sink just move the slider in the other direction.

"Armor" is critical to your mech. It protects your delicate weapons and
other internal components from damage. The armor menu item has
11 slider gadgets, one for each armor location.
There is a maximum amount of armor allowed for the head. 
One ton of armor gives 16 pts of protection.

"Hands" is an optional item. You can remove the hand and wrist actuators.
This will give you two extra spaces in the arms for weapons, but you will 
not be able to pick up anything with that arm.

Make sure you give your combat Mech a name
and make sure you Save it before you Quit. It will be saved with the mechs
name plus its weight. There are currently 8 Mech classes contained in the 
Light, Medium, Heavy, Assault and Xtended directories.
You will be given a warning if you have forgotten to
mount any of your weapons.

@node Light Mechs
@section Light Mechs
@cindex Light Mechs

Heres where I differ from a lot of people in tactics. When I create a light
mech, it is usually for the Kamikaze/suicide missions. Strap as much high
explosive ammo as you can on the thing, make it REALY fast (walk of 8 or
so) and go for it!

I know people use them for other things. But tell me this -- how much
armour and weapons can you shove onto a 20 ton mech? Not much. You might as
well use it as an "ammo" mech. Set it up as I said before, and get it to
run like hell at its target. Then overheat or something to blow the crap
out of it, destroying it -- but blowing up everything in the nearby
vicinity as well.

@node Medium Mechs
@section Medium Mechs
@cindex Medium Mechs

Creating Medium mechs can be a difficult job, since you need to decide
between many factors like speed, armour and weapons. Choosing one as
important can make other factors suffer badly. I have created many medium
mechs bedly, since I put faith in the wrong areas for the battle I was up
against.

Make the mech quick, but do not spend more than about 10 tons on the
engine. This will vary according to the size of the mech, but I feel that
this is a good starting point. Next, consider some of the upgraded armour
and structures provided in the 3rd edition rules if you follow them. They
can save a couple of tons here and there, and this can mean that you are
better armed ao armoured. One good idea is usually the upgraded internal
structure (if available).

Also, you might want to consider jump jets for this mech. The Death
fromabove tactic can work quite well if you do (I have used it to good
effect a number of times).

After that, you can start adding weapons, Medium lasers are my favorite,
but you may have different choices. Just make it medium range weapons,
light and little heat. The less heat your weapons generate, the longer you
will be able to charge your opponent.

As for ammo, make sure you put in CASE if you are an Inner Sphere mech
(clan mechs get this as standard -- and you say you prefer the IS stuff)
since you will have less armour than an assault mech, and an ammo explosion
can easily accur.

@node Heavy Mechs
@section Heavy Mechs
@cindex Heavy Mechs

I have found that the best thing for a heavy mech is an AC/10 or 2. An
AC/20 takes up far too much space, and I usually find LRM's to be too
unpredictable and unreliable for any real damage to be done with them. I
still make use of SRM's (particularly Infernos) since they are a much
better weapon for the amount of heat they cost to run.

The next thing that you need to consider is armour. I find that about 9-10
tons is usually sufficient. Other things that I find useful are Medium
lasers. Put a couple in where ever you can spare them. Don't waste your
time with smal lasers! They are far too short a range weapon. If you are
going to use them, you had better be good close quaters combat. You are
much better off by getting a couple of Medium lasers. They do more damage,
have better range, and don't give off much heat for the damage they do.

Other weaponary to consider is a PPC (Plasma cannon). Just the one of them,
particulary if you are in the Clans, will aide your cause quite well.
Unforetunately, They do generate a lot of heat, but do a lot of
CONCENTRATED damage. They also have a very good range.

As for Ammunition, you will need to decide how important the weapons that
require ammo are. Usually, when you get to assigning ammo, you will not
have the much space left, and so not get as much ammo on board as you would
like. If that is the case, then you will need to look at which weapons can
give you the best advantage particularly in the early stages of the battle.
This is usually long range weapons like an AC/10 or LRM's.

@node Assault Mechs
@section Assault Mechs
@cindex Assault Mechs

To create an assault mech you must work out what strengths you want it to
have. Should it be covered in armour? Or should it be covered in big guns?
Or something in between?

I find that a speed of 3 or 4 is a necissity for a assault mech, so an XL
engine (if you use those rules) is essential. The only problem with this is
if you are creating an Inner Sphere Mech is that you cannot have an AC/20
or variant on the mech if you use an XL engine. Oh well, I never liked
Inner Sphere anyways. I find them to be akward to use, since the weapons
and armour are almost always heavier per unit than for the clan mechs.

Anyway, I find that at least one or two ERPPC's are not just useful, but
essential. I also find that apart from Heat seekers and Infernos --
missiles are almost no use. If you have the Tactical Handbook, then you
will find a whole heap of new weapons to use. These weapons are mainly
available to the Inner Sphere, but some of the weapons can be used by the
Clans.

As for armour, it really depends on what you want. Make sure you allow at
least 10 tons for armour, since assault mechs tend to take quite a beating
battle.

@node Damaging Mechs
@section Damaging Mechs
@cindex Damaging Mechs

Why would you want to deliberately damage a mech? There are two
reasons. First of all, you might want to create a scenario in which a Unit
has received combat damage and has not had time for repair or only partial
repair. Secondly, you might have been sabataged. This would leave your mech
in faulty condition, but not failed. You can't repair sabatage until it
fails. You CAN deliberately damage the weak part and then repair it.

Make sure you save your Warrior or Unit file after you have made your
repairs.

@node Mech Salvage
@section Mech Salvage
@cindex Mech Salvage

"Salvage Mech" strips a Mech down to its component parts and gives the
Unit or Warrior C-Bills in return, see your contract for salvage rights.
It is designed to get rid of mechs that
have been too badly damaged in combat to be worth repairing. This is the
main way to get rid of a mech so that the warrior can try for a new mech. It
is also the main way to get rid of extra mechs captured in combat.

@node Modify Engine Size
@section Modify Engine Size
@cindex Modify Engine Size

Engines will give Mechs its power to run and walk
quickly in the terrain. Heavy Mechs with small engines will be
slightly slow. Light Mechs with big engines will be rather fast.
When modifying engines the weight will change with the power of the
engine. Engines with power greater than 390 will weight over 50 tons.
Due to the fact, the size of a Mech will change with the engine size.
If you notice that the size of the fusion engine will not be enough to
speed up your Mech than you need to modify the engine speed.

@node Modify Engine Speed
@section Modify Engine Speed
@cindex Modify Engine Speed

If a Mech is to slow when running and walking
in the terrain than here you can enhance the engine to be more
efficient. The maximum speed you can achieve in this way will
differ from the size of the engine and the size of a Mech.
Light Mechs will get less modify advantage then heavy and
very slow Mechs.

@node Modify Jump Jets
@section Modify Jump Jets
@cindex Modify Jump Jets

Jump Jets are the most powerful add ones for
every Mech. They will allow a Mech to jump in the air and jump
over hills, forests and deep water. Jump Jets will be used to
scout for enemy Mechs and objects hidden in the terrain. If
the enemy has been hidden behind a mountain or in deep forests
you can use your Jump Jets to scout and destroy them. But the
use of Jump Jets will make you a easy target for the enemy.
Jump Jets needs free room to be mounted to a Mech. If your Mech
has no free spares available in its Mech structure no Jump
Jets can be mounted.

@node Modify Heat Sinks
@section Modify Heat Sinks
@cindex Modify Heat Sinks

Everything in a Mech produces heat. Heat will
be produced by the weapons you are carrying, when running or
walking or form a damaged engine. Fire in the forests and
explosions in the surroundings of a Mech will also produce heat.
For all this reasons your Mech needs extra Heat Sinks. As the
Jump Jets Heat Sinks will need spare room in your Mech structure
when adding one.

@node Modify Body Armour
@section Modify Body Armour
@cindex Modify Body Armour

Body armour will protect a Mech from enemy
attack. A Mech with no body armour will be soon destroyed.
Most important part of a Mech that needs to be protected
is the head of a Mech. The head of a Mech is the place where
the Mech Warrior will sit in his cockpit and control every
part of a Mech. Add here all you can get of armour. There are
weapons which will blast your head (and the warrior in it)
away with only one shot so watch out.
Internal structures are another type of armour. They are not
as effective as body armour since the weapons, ammo, Heat Sinks,
Power Jumps, engine and gyros are unprotected, but they will
simply hold the Mech parts together. Internal structures will
change with the size of a Mech. Heavy Mechs have more internal
structures than light Mechs.

@node Preferences
@chapter Preferences
@cindex Preferences

The Headquarters and MechForce Programms share a config file called 
"MechForce.cfg". They will look for it in the "$PROGDIR" directory. It works
like the old config file except it has new options and can't be easily edited
with a text editor. The Preferences window has several string gadgets for
all the necessary file paths. In addition to the file paths you can specify
the recycle time for ALL weapons. A negative number "-1" will give you the
current (preferred) defaults. You can toggle on and off "Aimed Shots". This
will reduce the number of head shots during the game. You can specify the
delay time for messages and the speed of missiles. You can specify the color
for each side. That means ANY color, but only RED and BLACK work well
(but try it for yourself). You can disable the save at the end of the 
game. This turns ALL combat modes into training/simulation.

If you turn saborage on Headquarters will sabotage
every Mech that you load or modify in Headquarters.
Sabotage may now occur during combat missions and patrol. The basic
sabotage that is always done is sabotaging internal structures.
It may occur if a character is asked to perform a skill roll depending on
the condition occured in combat, like kicking and punching.
If succesfull no dammage will occur. Other sabotage is on weapon.
Here the character must perform a skill roll everytime the sabotaged
weapon is fired. If successfull no damage will occur.

If you select the 'Save Unit' option, Headquarters will save the 
current Unit to disk if you exit from the programm. 

@node Battle Bible
@chapter Battle Bible
@cindex Battle Bible

By now you should be familiar with basic Mech operation. You should be able
to start one up and move around and shoot at targets. So now it is the time
for you to begin training in tactics and techniques. This document will
attempt to point out several of these and help you prepare for your Trail
of Position, as well as actual combat. Note that while I have tried to be
as generic as possible, the whole reason behind most of this is based on
the situations you will encounter in the Trail. But, you will face many
different situations as a mechwarrior. And so it is my hope that you will
use this as an example of how to prepare for any situation. Read this,
memorize this, worship this, and never leave home without it.

@node Training
@section Training
@cindex Training

There are some basic things to focus on while you are training. While there
are many more in addition to this, here are some that may not be obvious to
you if you have not played BattleTech before.

@itemize @bullet
@item Watch the bearings and headings closely. Know where your enemy is in
relation to you, and where they are going. This will help you either avoid
them or intercept them, as the case may be. A useful thing to do for those
of you who are not so faliliar with using degrees is to keep a diagram of
the cardinal compass headings and their degree equivalents. 
[Note: North: 0, NorthEast: 60, East: 90, SouthEast: 120, South: 180, 
SouthWest: 240, West: 270, NorthWest:300]
Set this bseide you while you are simming and refer to it as needed.

@item Know where you are at all times. How far from the edge of the map are
you? Are you headed into a lake? Watch your tactical. If you hit the edge,
you asking for trouble.

@item If you have the ability, set your keypad to be the heading macros So
if you hit 7, it will set your heading to 300, 2 would set it to 180, etc.
Note that in hex, moving directly northwest is 300, not 315. When in doubt,
use the BEARING command.

@item Practice, Practice, Practice. Nothing is better. The more you sim,
the easier it is to keep track of all the things you need to keep track of.
@end itemize

@node Preparation
@section Preparation
@cindex Preparation

@itemize @bullet
@item Map:

Before entering any hostile situation a good strategist will try to learn
as much as possible about it beforehand. Get intelligence reports of the
map onto which you will be moving. Study it, and find strategic locations
that will be useful in combat. Water, hills, trees, and buildings are all
useful. Also know where the open spaces and clear runnings lanes are, so
you can pic a direction to move in without having to worry too much about
running into something.

@item Your Mech:

Any good Mech piolot knows the full potential and specs of his or her Mech.

@itemize @bullet
@item Know your top speed and walking speed.

@item Know your weapon numbers so you can SIGHT them and fire them
individually -- do not overheat by firing them all at once. Use TICs when
you are in a critical situation, (i.e. they are right on top of you) or
when you know your heat is not a problem.

@item Know your weapon specs. What is the maximum range you can fire? What
range is medium range for your weapons? Remember that you have a better
chance to hit if you are in a short range bracket. Is your Mech mainly a
long or short range Mech?

@item Know where your weapons are located on your Mech. How effective will
you be if you happen to loose your left arm? Do you have any rear-firing
weapons?

@itemize @bullet
@item Look where your ammo is stored, and how much of it you have. Ration
your ammo according to how much you have and how many foes you are facing.
If you have 80 SRMs it is not a bad thing to fire them with an 11 or 12 to
hit, as you will probably take too much damage and have them explode inside
of you before you can fire them all. Be prepared to dump ammo that is in a
section that has been severely damaged. If you don't need it, it's better
not to take the risk of it exploding.

@item It is probably in your best intrest to dump your Machine Gun
ammunition, as if you are close enough to use it, you have probably already
been hurt enough to put it in severe danger of being hit and exploding.

@item Feel free to fire your energy weapons (weapons that don't use
ammunition) even with a high ToHit early on. Wether you get lucky and hit
with them  could very well be the deciding factor of the outcome of the
battle. 

@end itemize

@item Know how much armor you have. Can you afford to take risks? If you
are in a Dasher, you might want to be very cautious, while a Daishi should
be more willing to take some hits. Pay close attention to how much rear
armor you have.

@item Know your jump capacity. Can you jump? How far? Utilize your jump
jets; they are a very advantagous tool for getting around terrain or
getting away from/closer to enemies.

@end itemize

@item Enemy Mech(s):

If you know what you will be going up against, by all means study the enemy
Mechs and know all of the above things. If not, (and you usually wont),
scan the enemy Mechs as soon as you possibly can make a mental note of all
the above thngs that you can see. Plan your strategy around how effective
they are at a long and short range.

@end itemize

@node Terrain
@section Terrain
@cindex Terrain

Using terrain effectively is one of the most important things you can do.
By moving in and out of your enemy's Line of Sight (LOS), you can keep them
gussing as to what you are doing. The method of using terrain depends on
your mission and situation.

@itemize @bullet
@item If you outnumber your enemy, it may be best to take a defensive
position in trees or in water. Force them to move to you in the open where
you can get good free shots on them.

@item If you are outnumbered, you may not want to sit somewhere or you will
be surrounded and overhelmed. Thus , you will want to move around hills and
tree lines. You should know what types of terrain block a LOS or provide
partial cover (trees, hills, buildings) and how to use them to do so.

@itemize @bullet
@item Be wary of enemies with jump jets, as they will be able to spot you
even if you are behind a large Building.

@item If they do not have jump jets, or not using them often, you can
really keep them guessing by moving out of their LOS and then abruptly
changing your direction. They will often be moving to intercept your
orginal heading while you are off moving the other direction. This is good
if you are trying to keep your distance, or if you want to surprise them
and come at them from the back/side.

@item Always know where you are going and what the terrain is in front of
you. Using LRS is a good way to plan where you will move next. Use TACTICAL
to steer more finely.

@end itemize

@item Know the effects of walking through terrain.

@itemize @bullet
@item If speed is your main priority, you should avoid walking through
terrain. You will slow down considerably.

@item Trees are probably okay, because they provide partial cover while you
are in them and block LOS when you are on the other side of them. If you
use this property of trees to your advantage, it can be useful.

@item Water in not so good. They may provide cover, but the dangers are
much worse. Water slows you down a lot. You also have the possibility of
falling over and taking damege. You do not want to give these free hits to your
enemy. When you get hit while in the water, you will be hit in the top part
of your Mech. This can be very dangerous. Water can be beneficial in that
if you are fallen (DROP) in water, the enemy cannot see you, so you can
recharge your weapons without worrying about getting hit. However, once you
STAND to fire, they will all peg you. [Note: Commonly known as 'Pop And
Drop' (PAD/P&D), this is indeed a useful tactic, especially for ambushes
where you have one or more mechs spotting range and targets for you.
However, it considered extremly dishonourable by the Clans, and generally
cowardly by everyone else.] In the mean time they will be moving
continually closer. The only time water is good is when you have a few
buddies with you, or if the enemy does not know you are there. It is
possible to hide in water while the enemy passes by and then jump up and
hit them in the back. You must have teammates telling you where they are
for this to work, though.

@item Hills are questionable. If they happen to be on the other side of the
peak from you, you will get partial cover, but your slower speed tets them
get closer. Wether you want this or not depends on your strategy. They can
be useful to walk on/over, but it will take you longer to move away if you
need to.

@end itemize

@end itemize

There are scores of different situations and each one will use the terrain
in a different way. There are many strategies to using it, and the only way
to learn all is through experience. These are just a couple examples.

@node Speed
@section Speed
@cindex Speed

The speed of your and your enemy's Mechs will play a large part in
determining your strategy.

@itemize @bullet
@item If you are slower than your opponent, you will have to plot your
heading to be ahead of his current direction. Move to intercept his course
to close the distance. One trick that you might find useful is to split the
difference between their bearing and heading. Thus, if they are bearing 0
from you and moving heading 120, you would go heading 60 to intercept them.

@item If you are faster then your opponent, you want to use this ability to
your advantage.

@itemize @bullet
@item Assuming you are a mobile lance (i.e. not sitting in a forest or
lake), you should be at top speed almost all the time. This makes it very
difficult for them to hit you.

@item Slow to wlaking speed to fire. You should know your walking speed
from the Preparation phase. One can use the speed command (options status) to
determine walking speed. Slowing will give you a better chance to hit. It
is a good idea to SIGHT your weapons so you know when you have reached your
walking speed. As soonas you see the ToHit go down a notch, fire what you
want to fire and immediately speed back up to top speed.

@item Slow to turn sharply. Be careful with this, as they can hit you more
easily when you are moving slower. The best time to do this is when you are
out of their LOS.

@item Walking backwards while facing your enemy can be a useful tool,
especially when you are faster than they. This keeps them in your forward
weapons arc while keeping your distance. They are a few points to keep in
mind, though.

@itemize @bullet
@item Know your maximum backward speed in relation to their maximum forward
speed. Do not let them close in too quickly.

@item Always have a destination in mind, even when walking backwards. It is
a good idea to change your heading so that you are walking back behind a
hill. In this way, once you are out of sight, you can turn and run away to
maintain the distance you want.

@item Be very careful about changing from backwards to forwards. If you are
in their sight, they will fire when your speed gets to zero in the
transition stage. They have a much easier time hitting you once you have
slowed. You cannot always avoid this, though. Just be careful.

@end itemize

@item Keeping your distance with your speed is a good thing, but if you
find yourself just outside of a lower range bracket, you should be prepared
to close in and fire just after they have fired their weapons. Do this
especially if they have just missed you.

@end itemize

@end itemize

@node Torso Twists
@section Torso Twists
@cindex Torso Twists

Using torso twists is a technique all on its own.

@itemize @bullet
@item For the most part, you should always turn to keep them in your
forward weapons arc. This lets you run diagonally away from them and still
be able to fire all your weapons.

@item If you are moving directly away, you can turn to the right and have
them in your right weapon arc and fire your weapons located on the right
sied. You should know these weapons from the Preperation stege. Thenyou can
turn to the left and do the same with your left weapons.

@item Turning your torso allows you to control which side of your mech is
facing your enemy. By using this along with adjusting your heading, you can
leave your wounded sections away from them, and let them hit your good side
for a while. Evening out your armor hits is a great technique. All it takes
is a few hits in the same section to render a Mech helpless.

@item Along the same line, you may wish to face directly away from the
enemy. Doing this will let you fire your weapons, if any. However, this is
why you should have paid close attention to how much armor you have in your
rear. Your rear is the most vulnerable spot. You should be extremly
cautious when turning your back on an enemy. It is not necessarily bad to
take a few hits in the back under certain circumstances. It helps to even
out things even more. Just understand that you have to watch it very
carefully.

@node Frequently Asked Questions
@chapter Frequently Asked Questions
@cindex Frequently Asked Questions

The answers to the Frequently Asked Questions are
based on the most current BattleTech rules as found in the BattleTech 
Compendium: The Rules of Warfare, Third Printing (softcover). 
Each question appears under the name of the chapter containing the 
information most closely related to the answer.

PLAYING THE GAME

Initiative

Q: Can a player end up moving more than one unit after his opponent has
finished moving all his units?

A: Yes. When one side outnumbers the other, the player with more units will
end up moving MORE than one unit last if he wins Initiative.

MOVEMENT

Falling

Q: Do I have to add in all the standard modifiers when making a Piloting
Skill Roll to avoid damage to my pilot when falling?

A: Yes. It is a Piloting Skill Roll, and so all normal modifiers apply.

Skidding

Q: Can a unit, after having skidded, continue its normal movement if
it has MP remaining?

A: No. A skid ends the unit's movement for the phase, even if it has MP
remaining.

Q: If my 'Mech has fallen and is skidding and it runs into a building or
mountain before it stops, do I take some type of charging damage?

A: No. The building or mountain would stop your skid, regardless of the
height of either obstacle or the construction factor of the building. 
However, a building would receive damage from the skidding 'Mech per 
the normal Charging rules.

COMBAT

Critical Damage

Q: Does an Inner Sphere 'Mech with an XL engine have its engine destroyed
if it loses all the internal structure of either its right or left torso?
What about if it has an ammo explosion in one of those locations and it
has CASE?

A: Yes. Regardless of where an engine receives its 3 hits-in the right,
center or left torso-if an engine receives 3 critical hits it is destroyed.

Firing Weapons

Q: If one of my 'Mech's arms is destroyed, can I prop up my prone 'Mech
with the other arm and fire my torso-mounted weapons?

A: No. A 'Mech must have both of its arms intact in order to fire while
prone. While prone, it can fire into its normal arcs, but cannot torso twist.

Heat

Q: What happens when my 'Mech shuts down?

A: When a 'Mech shuts down, it cannot move or torso twist. In addition,
all of its systems, including weapons and all electronics-C3 Slave or 
Master, ECM, etc.-are inoperative until the 'Mech restarts.

Line of Sight

Q: If my unit is firing on another unit that has partial cover but I
am an elevation level higher than him, does he still have partial cover?

A: No. No unit can have partial cover from an attacking unit that is at
a higher elevation level.

Q: If a 'Mech on Level 0 terrain is prone and adjacent to a Level 1 hill,
is the 'Mech in a dead zone?

A: Yes. Only a STANDING 'Mech adds 1 to its elevation for LOS; prone 'Mechs
do not.

PHYSICAL ATTACKS

Q: Can more than one unit make a Charge or Death From Above attack against
the same enemy unit in the same turn?

A: No. Once a unit has declared a Charge or Death From Above attack on another
unit, no other unit may declare an additional Charge or Death From Above
attack on that unit.

Q: Does a Club or Hatchet attack hit on the BattleMech Punch Location Table?

A: No. Use the BattleMech Hit Location Table to determine the hit location
of a Club or Hatchet attack. However, Club and Hatchet attacks are subject
to the Different Elevation rules, as usual.

Q: If I charge or push a BattleMech that, when displaced, would move into
an adjacent hex that is more than 3 elevation levels higher, would it still
move there?

A: No. A unit subject to a Push, Charge or Death From Above attack will
always be displaced unless the rules prevent that displacement, for example,
a BattleMech unit changing more than 3 elevation levels up. In such situations,
neither unit would move. If the attack is a Charge or Death From Above,
only the normal damage for that type of attack would be assigned. No additional
damage would occur. Note that a unit CAN be pushed DOWN more elevations
than the rules allow for legal movement-which would result in an accidental
fall.

Q: If I announce a Charging or Death From Above attack against a prone target,
do I receive the -2 to-hit modifier for being adjacent to a prone target?

A: Yes. Although you start your attack in the Movement Phase, at the beginning
of the Physical Attack Phase when you actually make the to-hit roll, you
are adjacent to the target.

Q: My BattleMech was designed with no hand or lower arm actuators (for example,
the OBK-M10 O-Bakemono). Do I still receive the negative modifiers for the
to-hit roll and when doing damage in a Punching attack?

A: Yes. However, the 'Mech suffers no penalty to Weapon attacks from those
arms.

VEHICLES

Q: What happens when a "critical" result is rolled on a Vehicle
Hit Location Table?

A: Like the critical result on the BattleMech Hit Location Table, this provides
a chance for one or more critical hits. Roll on the Determining Critical
Hits Table. If any critical hits are scored, determine their effects on
the appropriate Vehicle Critical Hit Table.

INFANTRY

Q: Can battle armor units enter water of Depth 1 or deeper?

A: No. Battle armor units must follow the same rules as other infantry regarding
movement and terrain restrictions, except as specifically noted in the rules.

Q: When infantry-standard or power armor-dismounts at the end of the Movement
Phase, will they receive the movement modifier for the number of hexes that
the carrying unit moved when resolving fire?

A: No.

Q: Do battle armor units take damage from flamers and fire?

A: Yes. Although some of the BattleTech fiction indicates that battle armor
units are immune to fire, the actual game rules do not protect them.

Q: My Point of elementals enters a mined hex and it explodes. Does each
elemental take the damage or does the unit as a whole take the damage?

A: The elementals as a unit (Point) take the damage.

CONSTRUCTION

Q: Can I mount two engines in a BattleMech or vehicle?

A: No.

Q: Can I design a BattleMech with a heavier chassis (Internal Structure)
than is required? For example, I am designing a 55-ton 'Mech and wish to
add a 6-ton chassis.

A: No.

Q: When constructing a 'Mech, can I allocate Triple Strength Myomer anywhere
on the 'Mech and split the criticals up between different locations?

A: Yes.

Q: When constructing a 'Mech, can I allocate MASC anywhere on the 'Mech
and split the criticals up between different locations?

A: MASC can be allocated anywhere on the 'Mech, but the criticals cannot
be split up between locations.

EQUIPMENT

Q: Can an anti-missile system be used against an Arrow IV homing missile?

A: No. Despite its name, the Arrow IV is an artillery weapon, not a missile
weapon. An anti-missile system is only effective against missile weapons.
The missile category is listed on the Weapons and Equipment Table, and includes
LRMs, SRMs, Streak SRMs, and Narc Missile Beacons.

Q: When constructing a Clan 'Mech with a targeting computer, do all eligible
direct-fire weapons have to be tied to the targeting computer?

A: Yes. Note that Machine Guns are not eligible weapons; only Lasers, PPCs,
Gauss rifles and Autocannons.

Q: What happens when a MASC critical location on a 'Mech is hit?

A: Per the normal rules for equipment, regardless of the number of critical
spaces MASC occupies, the first critical hit destroys the MASC.

Q: If I have an AMS and my opponent fires multiple missile packs at my 'Mech,
can I choose which one to try and shoot down? What if I have multiple AMS?

A: No. Whichever missile pack your opponent declares first-even if you have
multiple AMS-all your AMS will fire upon it.

Q: If my 'Mech has a Gauss rifle that explodes in a location containing
CASE, would the CASE protect the 'Mech from further damage just like in
an ammo explosion?

A: Yes. Note the pilot also takes 2 points of damage, just like in an ammo
explosion.

Q: I have two 'Mechs linked by a C3 computer system. One of my 'Mechs is
far away, while my other 'Mech is close to my opponent's 'Mech (which has
a ECM suite). If I am trying to hit my opponent's 'Mech using the C3 computer
system, will the ECM suite block it?

A: It all depends on whether or not one of the two attacking 'Mechs actually
enters the ECM suite "bubble". In other words, if the closer unit
is within the 6-hex range of the ECM suite, its "connection" to
the other 'Mech has been broken. However, if the unit is 7 hexes or more
away from the ECM-equipped unit, the "connection" is intact and
the first 'Mech may use the C3 computer system to target its opponent.

SPECIAL CASE RULES

Q: Can I reverse my 'Mech's arms when it is prone?

A: No.
