BLOBZ v1.3

© Alternate Realities 2003-04

This game is freely distributable, however all files in this archive
(including this one) must remain unchanged and intact.

Blobz is freeware.

CHANGES
-------

- Highscore table - that works!
- Ten new levels
- In-game music (that can be turned off :-) and highscore music
- You can slide diagonally on the ice
- Save game system changed - it checks if a file exists before loading it in
- Restart button added
- Cheat mode :-)

SO THEN, WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT?
-----------------------------

Blobz is my first game, written entirely in Blitz Basic 2.1. It's not exactly
the best game ever made, but I've enjoyed writing it and it's certainly
playable (in my opinion :-).

Anyway, Blobz is an overhead view, collect-all-the-gems-and-get-to-the-exit-
before-the-time-runs-out sort of game, spread over 6 different worlds,
with 10 levels in each. For the numerically-challenged, that makes 60 levels.

However, there is more to it than that, as I'll explain later.

INSTALLATION
------------

Installation is simple, as you've probably already found out. Simply extract
the 'Blobz1.3.lha' archive into the directory of your choice, but don't move or
rename any of the drawers or files contained in the 'Blobz' drawer. Also, the
game needs the '2001.font' to be placed into your FONTS: drawer, if you've
somehow managed to avoid it during the last decade or so.

It is also possible to run the game from floppy, if you really want to, but
it's very slow to load, so only do it if you really need to. Just copy all
the drawers from the 'Blobz' drawer onto a floppy disk, make c, s, and libs
drawers also on your disk. Copy Assign into c, diskfont.library into libs,
and write the following as your startup-sequence:

Assign ENV: RAM: >NIL:
Blobz

That should work fine. If not, contact me (see later).

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------

Blobz was developed on an A1200 with a 68030 and 6MB RAM. Although the game
does not need this setup to run, it will run very slowly on an A500 with a
68000. (Thanks to the kind person who tested this on WinUAE - but I've
forgotten your name. Sorry!) The game also needs at least 2MB to run, to the
best of my knowledge. The game runs very nicely on my setup so a 68030 will
allow it to run at a good speed.

NOW, FINALLY, THE GAME...
-------------------------

Yep - after all that you'll probably want to know how to play the game. As
soon as you've seen the opening couple of screens (which you can skip by
pressing the fire button or the space bar, but they only last a few seconds)
you'll end up on the title screen. Here you have three options:

START GAME - start from the very beginning.
LOAD GAME  - load one of up to nine save games (you need to have saved a game
             first, obviously)
QUIT       - guess!

If you do nothing the highscore table will appear, followed by a brief info 
screen. These can also be skipped by pressing fire (the space bar is referred
to with the fire button from now on).

Anyway, move the joystick up or down, or the arrow keys and press fire to
select your option. If you choose 'start game' you'll be presented with
'GAME NUMBER 1 to 9'. Press that key and the game will save to that file if
you choose to save during the game. If you select 'load game' then you'll
again be asked to choose a game number. If it exists, it will be loaded in
otherwise the game will flag an error and you'll be returned to the title
screen (you may have to wait a few seconds).

HOW TO PLAY
-----------

Assuming you've started the game then, you should see a panel at the top of
the screen. From left to right, this shows you the number of gems left to
collect, keys you currently have, lives left, health left, level, score, the
current high score and the time remaining.

The aim of the game is, as a little blue blob, to collect all the gems on 
every level. Sounds simple. But that's not all. Trying to stop you are 
enemies, moving left and right, up and down, which if you collide with, you 
lose one health. Lose all your health points and you lose a life, sending you
back to your starting point (marked 'GO'). The enemies come in four flavours:

Red - go at the same speed as you.
Green - go double your speed.
Orange - go four times your speed.  
Light Blue - go EIGHT TIMES your speed.

Early on, you will only encounter the red enemies. The further you progress
into the game, the quicker the enemies get, and the harder it becomes to
complete the level. It can get very tricky in places!

You can also die instantly by moving into the black stuff.

So enemies make life difficult for you. Let's have a look at all the goodies
to collect:

Gem - 5 points - you need to collect ALL of these.
Key - 2 points - you need these to open doors.
100 - 100 points.
Heart - gives you extra health.
1UP - gives you an extra life.

Most of the time it is necessary to open every door on a level, as they often
contain gems and things. On some levels you have to open doors in a certain
order, or there are more doors than keys, so you have to watch what door you
open.

When you have collected your last gem, you will hear a different sound to
what you usually hear when you collect a gem (providing the music's turned
off). This tells you that you have collected every gem, and you should head 
for the exit which is cunningly labelled EXIT.

Now let's look at all the different tiles to be found:

GO - your starting point. You return here when you die.
Normal - usually with a pattern on. Fairly obvious.
Walls - obviously block your path.
Doors - open with keys, otherwise they act like walls.
Black - kills you instantly if you touch it.
Ice - sends you in the direction you are currently facing. You can move around
      on ice.
Arrows - sends you in the direction that the arrow is pointing. You CANNOT
         move the opposite way to the arrow e.g. if an arrow points left, you
         cannot move right, but you can move up or down.
Exit - finishes the level when you have collected all the gems.

As mentioned earlier, there is a time limit on each level. They are always
short as every level in Blobz is small and as a result can be finished 
quickly, if you are good enough! Should you run out of time, you lose a life,
and then you have one minute as your new time limit.

CONTROLS
--------

Joystick:

Up, Down, Left, Right, and diagonals do exactly what you would expect them to
do.

Keyboard:

Use the arrow keys to move. Space acts as fire.

In-game keys:

P - Pause/Unpause.
Esc - quits current game, and takes you to the title screen.
M - Turns in-game music on or off. You will only hear sound effects if the
music is off.
R - restart a level. Useful if you get completely stuck on certain levels.
However this will cost you a life. You cannot do this if you are on your
last life. Be warned!

FINISHING A LEVEL
-----------------

When you have completed a level, you are awarded certain bounses:

GEM BONUS - a point for every gem collected.
LEVEL BONUS - 50 points straight away for completing a level.
TIME BONUS - a point for every second left on the clock. If you lost a life
             through running out of time, you don't get this bonus.
NO HARM DONE BONUS - 125 points if you complete a level without losing a
                     single point of health.
WORLD BONUS - 200 points for when a world is completed (every 10 levels).

The next level will start automatically when it is loaded.

SAVING A GAME
-------------

Every five levels you have a chance to save your progress. Obviously, if you
want to save press Y, otherwise press N.

Your game will now be saved (or not). It can be loaded through the 'load game'
option on the title screen. You are allowed to over-write files. The saved 
games are stored in the 'Data' drawer.

GAME OVER
---------

If you lose all your lives, it's game over.

If your score is good enough you will get a place in the highscore table.
Enter your name and then the table is saved to disk.

COMPLETING THE GAME
-------------------

When you do, you can play again with a difference...
(Also this is how you find out the cheat mode :-)

OTHER STUFF
-----------

In some levels, there are seemingly impossible to reach sections. Well, they
are not that impossible to reach, as it is possible to find an invisible path
through to what is usually an area stuffed with lives and points. This is
obvious early on (indeed, one level is based on these invisible paths!) Also
there are ocassionally paths offering a somewhat easier path to the exit,
although these are very rare. Why not try to find them all?

Also please note that the difference between the worlds is purely graphical.
You may have noticed that there is also no storyline (not a bad thing).

AND NOW A DESPERATE PLEA FOR HELP...
------------------------------------

I need someone to help draw the graphics for my platform game which I am
currently developing (which has the slightly naff working title of 'Diamond
Kingdoms'). Features include:

- 10 levels spread over 5 worlds
- Big levels (flip-screen platformer)
- 32 colour graphics
- And a lot more

If you've seen the graphics for Blobz, you'll know that I'm not the greatest
artist in the world. So if you would like to help, please e-mail me for more
details, provide a sample of your work if possible, although it's not vital.
Thanks.

AND FINALLY...
--------------

Have fun!
