Changes from 0.98 B to 0.99 B:

- Added loading of highscores.

- Further preparations for loading of gfx/sound sets.

- Fixed a bug in the bounce priority.
- Fixed a bug in the `brickthrough' code.
- Fixed a bug when exiting the options screen.
- Fixed a bug where the laser copy screen would be visible for
        an instant when the player dies.
- Fixed a bug where the score counter was not updated properly
        when firing laser beams.

        correctly.

- Did *NOT* fix the bounce-ball bug, due to some problems with
            the assembly language parts. It's now planned for
            version 1.0 B.
