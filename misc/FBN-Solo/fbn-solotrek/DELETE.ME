Ok, read it then; see if I care.

Scum.






























Special secret hidden cheat mode!

"i want me some funky points"


Originally, this was in there so I could test systems without getting the shit knocked out of me by the damned Borg.  Instead of taking it out, I added a couple more items, random of course, and now it can do one of several things.  It still will give you 1000 reserve energy - maybe.  It might activate the auto destruct sequence.  It could take all your energy and transfer it to reserve.  It might destroy everything in a sector.  It might do any one of those things.  So, yes, Virginia, there IS a cheat mode, but you might regret it.  Well?  Do you feel lucky, Punk?



I really want feedback about this game.  Would you like more features?  If so, what?  Did you enjoy the game?  Are you female, about 25, and horny?  Why are you telling me?  Would you like to see a version with loadable missions?  Would you like to watch a bean-eating movie with George Wendt?


Enough already.



























Cheater.
