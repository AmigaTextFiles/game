                     Configuration Editor Documentation


    The new BattleForce uses a new config file called "BattleForce.cfg".  All
programs will look for it in the "S:" directory of your boot disk.  It works
like the old config file except it has new options and can't be easily edited
with a text editor.  There is a new program called "ConfigEd" that will make
your config file and allow you to edit it easily.  ConfigEd will load the
current config file automatically when it runs.
    ConfigEd has eight string gadgets for each of the necessary file paths.
You MUST have a valid path for each one.  If the programs can not find the
files they need they will not run.
    In addition to the file paths you can specify seven defaults for the
BattleForce combat program.  You can specify the recycle time for ALL
weapons.  A negative number will give you the current (preferred) defaults.
You can toggle on and off "Aimed Shots".  This will reduce the number of head
shots during the game.  You can specify the delay time for messages and the
speed of missiles.  You can specify the color for each side.  That means
ANY color, but only RED and BLACK work well (but try it for yourself).  You
can disable the save at the end of the game.  This turns ALL combat modes
into training/simulation.
