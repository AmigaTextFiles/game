ToolTypes (program icon):

 - PUBSCREEN (def=default pubscreen, name of public screen to use for "window" mode)
 - FULLSCREEN (def=windowed, can be toggled ingame with alt-return)
 - DEPTH (16/32, def=32, only applies to fullscreen)
 - CHANNELS (def=4, amount of audio "channels" to use)
 - REFRESH (def=as set in Prefs/GUI, SIMPLE/SMART)

Playing:

1. Doubleclick the icon to run the game.

2. Select "New Game" and then try to save your city by destroying the incoming missile waves.
   Also try not to let your cannons get destroyed as they are your only defensive capability
   against the missiles. All buildings still intact at the end of a "wave" add to your score
   (no buildings left => game over).

The hiscores are saved in a file called "hiscores.bin". If this file does not exist yet it is
created by the game. To clear out the hiscores just delete the file.

Note: The game requires a P96 hicolour (16-bit) or truecolor (24/32-bit) screenmode. The display
code won't work for a palettemapped or non-P96 screen. The "FULLSCREEN" option above can be used
to force the game to open it's own screen, which should be OK.

Changes:

0.9:
 - fixed bug that would cause antimissiles with no x-velocity to continue forever,
   without exploding
 - doubled the amount of possible incoming missile angles (was 4 previously, now 8)
 - doubled the reload time of cannons from 1s to 2s
 - added more realistic looking building gfx (if anyone thinks he can do better please contact me
   (fredrik@a500.org), the game can use either colormapped or 32-bit (i.e. with 8-bit alpha),
   image format doesn't matter as long as it's supported by datatypes, .png or .ilbm preferred
   though)
 - tweaked sky gradient a little
 - removed ugly looking fog
0.8:
 - scoring system now implemented
 - missiles now target buildings (launches are not completely random as before)
 - missiles get progressively harder now (faster, more accurate, less delay between launches, etc.) 
 - support for more than one channel in audio routines
 - player now has only a limited amount of "cannons" with a fixed reload time (2s) with which to
   combat the incoming missiles
0.7:
 - some more gradients in menu
 - proper shading on buttons, etc.
 - hiscore display (not functional)
 - new icon
0.6:
 - added some nice gradients (sky, menu buttons)
 - some other improvements
0.5:
 - backdrop image
 - some small gfx/speed optimisations
 - nicer looking menus
0.4:
 - optimised pre-clearing of the drawbuffer (reduced ingame cpu usage by about 40%)
 - added some primitive sound code (uses AHI hi-level interface)
0.3:
 - too many to mention
 - added proper "main menu", and removed the gadtools ones
 - ESC while playing now goes back to the main menu.
 - "Pause" button (keyboard) pauses the game
0.2:
 - added possibility to destory the enemy missiles
 - fixed quite a few DSIs (didn't show up until now)
