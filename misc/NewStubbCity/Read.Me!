Greetings From Stubb!

A wise man once said, "If you cut off my arm, there will be me and my arm.
                       If you cut off my leg, there will be me and my leg.
                       But if you cut off my head, will there be me and my
                       Head?... or me and my Body?
                       One thing is certain, There will always be a STUBB!

THE GAME:

New Stubb City was created using DOMARK's Virtual Reality Studio on an Amiga
A500 equipped with a GVP harddrive and 5 megs of ram.  Some functions, such
as screen messages, are processor dependant and may be difficult to grasp on
accelarated machines.  Other than that it should run fine.  If you have
trouble let me know.

Run the game via icon from workbench provide you have ICONX in the SYS:C/
path.  Or you may run the game from CLI by simply entering the one word
command:  "NSC"  Unfortunately New Stubb City will take over your OS forcing
you to reboot when your done.  There is no "QUIT" option.

You are cast as Beorge Gush Drug Enforcement Agent.  Your mission:  to rid
New Stubb City of the pestulant Crack Babies which are sucking up the flow
of Social dollars and raising havoc for our inner city hospitals.  In their
pupal stage, crack babies appear as whitish packets of crystalized hell.
They come in various sizes and temperaments.  Be careful.  Search for them
everywhere, high and low, and around corners.  If you see one, don't ask
questions, blast the critter!  If you get them all, you will be promoted
to air patrol... but that's reserved for registered users only.

To move around in Virtual Reality, you use the mouse and the on screen
control panal.  The left mouse button is normal mode.  The right mouse
button will double the rate at which you travel and turn.  You may find
it less frustrating to use the right mouse button exclusively while turning.
This way you'll turn in even 30 degree increments.

To shoot, simply press the left mouse button while the crosshairs are
on the playing screen.

To activate, pick up, or touch somthing use the right mouse button.

You may walk or crawl.  Look up or down.  If you get disoriented, use the
straight ahead key to right your vision.  Your eye level is represented
by a visible sight.  It will let you know if you can pass under an object.
The sight may be turned off if you like.

Save games often.  Games are saved to the same path the game was launched
from unless specified.  If you get stuck you can bail out or simply wander
around forever until you shoot the right thing, or enter the right
series of doors in the correct order.  Be observant.  Don't do drugs.


For Now,



Stubb.
