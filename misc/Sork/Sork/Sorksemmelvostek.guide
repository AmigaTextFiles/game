@node REQUIREMENTS "Requirements"

You need AGA, 500Kb chip and 1Mb fastmem.

A joystick is preferrable, since keyboard controls aren't very good yet.

'030 at 50Mhz or better is reccomended. However, the speed of your memory is
also very important. If you have a fast processor, and Sork runs slowly, it
may be because of slow fastmem.
On a Blizzard 1230/50 it should be about 14fps when you're moving around on
the surface.

@endnode

@node INSTALLATION "Why are you reading this?!"

I already told you, just put it anywhere.

Oh, if you have lowlevel.library in Libs: you can delete it from the Sork
directory, and save 7k.

Anyway, this is what the directory structure should look like:

Sork <DIR>
	Sorksemmelvostek
	Start
	Start.info
	Sorksemmelvostek.guide
	Sorksemmelvostek.guide.info
	lowlevel.library
	Data <DIR>
		Map
		Sky

@endnode

@node QUICKSTART "What you really need to know"

Start Sorksemmelvostek, select low-res, use your joystick to steer around.

Then you will want to try out the keyboard controls and settings. Sork runs on
a normal Amiga screen and multitasks, so just keep this guide open and refer
to the page @{"Controls" link CONTROLS} for a full list of available controls.

@endnode

@node Legal "Legal stuff"

This program is Copyright ©1997 by Merko.

It may not be given away freely, and must only be sold for huge sums of money.

Use this program at your own risk - it's dangerous.

lowlevel.library is copyright © Amiga International.
I don't think it's freely distributable really but I doubt they'll sue me.

@node INTRODUCTION "Introduction"

This is a voxelengine. It shows a landscape in a 3d-ish view, and allows you
to move around on the surface as well as in the air.

Features:

	· Fast.

	· Much longer view than other voxels I've seen.

	· Supports different screenmodes. Screen width is always 320 though.
	  Try out hires interlaced for a nice looking quarterscreen view.

	· Rotation along all three axis, although roll and up/down
          rotations are a fake. They look good when rotation is
	  around -30 to 30 degrees though, which is what is needed normally.

	· Supports mapsizes of almost any size. (Well, the engine does, this
	  version is fixed for a 512x512 @{"voxelmap" link VOXELMAP}.

	· Fully multitasking.

@endnode

@node VOXELMAP "About the map"

The voxelmap in this version is generated in VistaLite, given away by CUAmiga.
Unfortunately, VistaLite doesn't produce very good results, so I'm sure it
would be possible to make a landscape that looks much better than this.

If you have any ideas about how to do it - @{"contact me" link CONTACT}!

The sky is drawn by me using several different graphics programs.

@endnode

@node CHANGES "What have I done now?"

These are the changes since v0.501ß:

	· Should now work with joypads. (Not tested though!)
	· Keyboard controls added, a joystick is no longer required.
	· Considerably faster on fast processors. (060 and probably 040)
	· 'Flying mode', now Sork is a flight simulator too.. well almost.
	· Variable screen height added. (NTSC users will like this)
	· Now aborts on ctrl-c.
	· Sork never busywaits any longer, in last version it sometimes did
	  this on very fast processors.
	· Some small things, like removing the mouse pointer on Sork's screen.
	
@endnode

@node CONTROLS "Full controls"
      Joystick or arrow keys:
	Normal mode
        Up		- Accelerate
        Down		- Decelerate
        Left		- Turn left
        Right		- Solve world poverty
        Fire (Shift)	- Rise

	Flying mode
        Up		- Go down
        Down		- Go up
        Left		- Turn left
        Right		- Build bisquits
        Fire (Shift)	- Thrust

      Keyboard:

	HELP		- Pause. Was supposed to display all sorts of fancy
			  info, but that has to wait until next version.

	Alphanumerical keys
	1-8		- Select rendering quality. 1 is best, 8 looks awful.
			  Default is 3.

	9		- Short(er) view, rendering quality 3
	0		- Even shorter view, rendering quality 3
			  (These are just to show that it doesn't make
			   much difference)

	Numerical keyboard
	Up (8)		- Decrease screen height
	Down (2)	- Increase screen height

	F1		- Normal steering

	F2		- Flying mode

	F10		- Turn on some timings for @{"statistics" link STATS}. When you
			  press F10, nothing will happen, but when you quit
			  Sork a requester with some stats will appear.
			  This is not done in an OS-legal way, and will cause
			  some enforcerhits.

	Esc		- Quit

@endnode


@node STATS "The highly unfinished statistics"

			  Hmm.. well the last figure displayed is the
			  framerate multiplied by 100. The first ones tell how
			  many parts per mille a certain task takes of the
			  total time Sork has been active. 'C2P' is a bit
			  misleading, perhaps 'copying to chipmem' would be
			  better, since that's what takes so much time.
			  The BlitterC2P time is the time the processor has to
			  wait for the blitter to be finished, if this shows a
			  high value there are two possibilities:
			   1. Your processor is extremely fast.
			   2. Some other program is using the blitter.
			  In the latter case Sork is likely to hickup for a
			  brief moment every now and then. Just remove the
			  other program and the result will be much better.
			  (It needn't use the blitter much, I had a problem
			   with a toolbar clock which updated a few digits
			   once per second!)

@endnode

@node BUGS "Known bugs"

Bug #1:		If you go way too fast, all sorts of weird things can happen.

Solution:	Don't go way too fast.


Bug #2:		Occationally the screen update flickers horribly.

Solution:	Tell me to fix it.


Bug #3:		Sork is extremely sensitive to other programs that use the
		blitter.

Solution:	Quit all such programs, and Sork will run much smoother.


Bug #4:		Some bugs are missing in this list.

Solution:	Report them to me.

@endnode

@node FUTURE "Future"

Maybe I will do another version..

I would like to

	· Fix all known bugs

	· Put in a speed limit (Yeah, that's so hard that I couldn't do it in
	  this version ;)

	· Add some different chunky-2-planar routines for differently specced
	  Amigas

	· Add 1x1/2x1/1x2/2x2 modes instead of fixed 2x1 like in this version

	· Add CGfx-support (I'm looking at rtgmaster.library at the moment)

	· Make rendering faster with high views

	· Use the MMU on 060 and 040 processors to improve cache performance

Game?!?

Many persons have asked me if I will do a game out of this. The answer is, I
don't know. I think it could become a good game, but there's a lot of work
involved. I don't want to start doing a game if I'm not sure I will be
motivated enough to finish it.

If you want Sork to become a game, then write to me and tell how you'd like
the game to be.

@endnode

@node CONTACT "Contact me"

Ok, I have a new E-mail address:

90281522482E7@bibl.skelleftea.se

Phew! That's not a very convenient address! More so as I'll have to book time
at the local library to check my mail, so it is likely that I'll get a better
address soon. However, mails to that address will reach me at least until
August 1 1997, and probably a bit longer.

So if you have any bug reports, suggestions, unconstructive critisisms, job
offers, tips on how to get cheap Gfx-cards for A1200, or if you want
information about colours, just write!

@node NAME "Who am I?"

My real name is Johan Rönnblom, I'm 18 years old and live in Skellefteå,
Sweden. It was about a year ago when I first started to learn assembler,
although before that I had been playing around with Amos quite a lot.
However, all my Amos projects became impossible to realise because sooner or
later some bugs in Amos appeared that were only possible to avoid by
workarounds or by doing totally senseless things like putting in extra
commands that did nothing useful.

Right now I'm thinking about learning C, but since I can't afford StormC it
has to be Gnu. The problem with Gnu is that it is command line based and
completely beginner-unfriendly. So the first problem I have to solve is how to
integrate it with some good texteditor to make it useable, then I can start to
think about learning C.

Of course, that's not too much work, but then I am extremely lazy when it
comes to such things.

@endnode

@node HISTORY "What has happened?"

Ok, here is a quick summary of history so far:

(You have to understand that I cannot include the whole history; it would take
 up almost as much space as this entire guidefile!)

1814 - History is invented by R. J. Rogers, from Mowahemba, Switzerland.

1815 - Only one year later, the first historical event takes place:
       The building of the worlds largest elk-shaped cathedral in Zagreb.

1818 - For two years, nothing happens, but then suddenly Rembrandt paints his
       most widely known painting; The Drunk Archer, by mistake.

1826 - Many ducks and kettlefish start to behave strangely. This has never
       been satisfactorily explained.

1833 - Europe is discovered by Trevor Dagnemann from Antwerpen.

1833 - Trevor Dagnemann is killed in a fight with his neighbour and friend 
       Saladin The Great in a dispute about who was first to discover Europe.

1841 - Emilio Martinez (popularly called 'Fish') is the first man to be born
       in the 19th century. His mother is said to have been very happy.

1869 - The entire history between 1828 and 1864 is lost in a fire.

1874 - Argentina agrees with Lenin to build the Atlantic Ocean.

1874 - The first shovel of gravel is taken for the Atlantic Ocean project.

1888 - The first year with three eights in a row is celebrated in Korea,
       Indonesia, Australia, Togo, Spain and the city of Kreçnet, Slovakia.
       Emilio 'Fish' Martinez is not invited and declares war to Indonesia.

1888 - Emilio wins his first and only victory at Keratao.

1888 - Emilio gets captured by the enemy but is released later the same day.

1888 - Emilio dies of pneumonia after having been captured and released by
       Indonesian soldiers the very same day.

1893 - The Atlantic Ocean is ready after six years of hard work, and a long
       argument between Lenin and his mother about the need of another vile
       friend.

1901 - Finally, someone manages to distill liquor out of the poisonous
       daka-tree in Malawi. The discoverers name is now long since forgotten.

1905 - Henning Beerkwöegen, Denmark, holds his breath for twenty-four minutes,
       an event which sets the start for another popular spectator sport.

1911 - Australian engineers come up with the idea to fill the entire 
       Atlantic Ocean with water.

1921 - History is banned in most of the civilized world, after the unlucky
       event with the wrestlers and the electric fence in Kyoto.

1963 - The Japanese revolution spreads all over the world and fills people
       with new hope.

1965 - Guyana is proclaimed the capital of Albania; great confusion erupts.

1969 - A court in Diskusbrocken, Pompoland, decides that it is enough of
       foolery and that everything must return to normal again.

1972 - The body of Emilio 'Fish' Martinez is found in a box of chocolates from
       a well known chocolate manufacturer. The explanation of this odd event
       is not found until three months later, by Emilios mother Olga Martinez.

1976 - The olympic games take place in Münich.

1977 - Zuljia Hrevets invents music, and is awarded the Nobel Prize.

1983 - A barman in Düsseldorf gets shot from 836.22 meters, which was a new
       world record.

1986 - R. J. Rogers dies in his home in Mowahemba, after writing History for
       nearly 126 years.

That caught your attention, right?
Well, the next page is much more interesting.

@node UKULELES "The inferior instrument."

Ukuleles are of no use. Balalaikas are much better.

There was a poor bear from Berlin,
who felt empty and pointless within.
So he asked himself 'Why,
dont I go and die?'
Then he killed himself with a balalaika.

There once was a Pole with some knives,
who constantly took peoples lives.
Then one day he thought,
that if he'd get caught,
he'd kill himself with a balalaika.

One day a man in Limerick
tried hard to come up with some trick.
He found up a rhyme,
which still in our time
makes people kill themselves with balalaikas.

An evil disease from Kambodja
Infected a dentist named Roger
His feet went so numb,
and his eye! And his thumb!
And his liver went muddier and muddier.

(Later, he killed himself with a balalaika)

@node LLUMERE "The problem with llumere."

I feel I have to share this with you, it's a part of a small math project
about ellipses that I did with a couple of friends:

(Translated from swedish)

The problem with llumere.
In the name of the guests, llumere has often been considered as a hearty
phenomenon, but all is not for the good.
Llumere is for example known to cause severe embryonic damages, but that
doesn't really matter that much. It's so fucking funny!
The big problem is rather weakenings, both internal and external. Does one
really have to pay the fine to carry on?
Talkas writes in a report from 1995 about the subject:
"It is not often one gets to see such sweet red coverings".
Others that have written about the problem are Sven and Eivor, in their
annual report from 1973.
