@ENDNODE

@NODE Edit "The Editor"

 The @{u}Diamond Caves Editor@{uu} is based on MUI and each window (except the
 main window) may be opened or closed at any time. These windows are
 described in the following chapters:

 @{" Main window " Link EditMain}

 @{" Edit window " Link EditEdit}

 @{" Selection window " Link EditSelect}

 @{" Statistics window " Link EditStat}

 @{" Eater window " Link EditEater}

 @{" Value window " Link EditValue}

 @{" Highscore window " Link EditHigh}

@ENDNODE

@NODE EditMain "Main window"

 The @{u}main window@{uu} of Diamond Caves is always present and can not be closed.
 It contains some basic functions and the ability to quit the Diamond Caves
 Editor.

 @{b}@{u}Level-Group@{uu}@{ub}:

 @{b}Nr.@{ub} represents the number of the Level you are editing. Note that this
 number is used for the filename of the Level, not the comment.

 @{b}Comment@{ub} is just the small text that will be displayed immediately before
 entering the Level. The Comment may be up to 20 chars long.

 You may use the following characters:
 "a-z" "A-Z" "0-9" "?!.©:"
 "<>"  : arrow to the left/right
 "*@"  : Emerald & Diamond
 "§$%" : Boulder, Bomb, Nut
 "&"   : Earth
 "[]"  : Player 1 & 2

 The PopUp-button next to the string gadget will open a help-window showing
 you all the above shortcuts.

 @{b}Directory@{ub} is the Directory where you load your Levels from and save them
 to. The small button to the right pops up a filerequester where you can choose
 a new Directory.

 @{b}Create Directory@{ub} lets you create a new Directory (surprise !). The
 Directory will be placed in the "DC:" drawer and the name you enter will get
 the suffix ".lvl" attached to it.

 @{b}Import@{ub} makes it possible to read Levels from different Boulder Dash clones
 and use them within Diamond Caves. See @{" Import Levels " Link Import}

 @{b}Load@{ub} will try to load the level with the current number out of the current
 directory

 @{b}Save@{ub} will save the present level to disk using the given number and dir.
 Before saving, the Editor checks your Level carefully to avoid unplayable Levels.

 @{b}Test@{ub} lets you test the current level without saving it. You may choose
 betweeen testing with one or two players.

 @{b}@{u}Window-Group@{uu}@{ub}:

 With these Gadgets you are able to open and close the other windows. They
 may also be closed by clicking on their close-gadget.

 @{" Edit window " Link EditEdit}

 @{" Selection window " Link EditSelect}

 @{" Statistics window " Link EditStat}

 @{" Eater window " Link EditEater}

 @{" Value window " Link EditValue}

 @{" Highscore window " Link EditHigh}


 @{b}About@{ub} displayes the About window

 @{b}Quit Editor@{ub}: Guess what this one does :-)
@ENDNODE

@NODE EditEdit "Edit window"

 This window contains the playfield of the Level. If the window is smaller
 than the size of the Level, you can scroll the visible display.

 @{b}UnDo@{ub} takes back the last action

 @{b}Text@{ub} lets you type in a text and place it in the playfield. You have the
 choice between horizontal and vertical alignment.

 @{b}Clear@{ub} clears the whole region with the @{"active entry" Link EditSelect}.

 @{b}Random@{ub} places the active entry randomly in the playfield. The frequency
 may be controled using the slider below.

 @{" Selection window " Link EditSelect}

@ENDNODE

@NODE EditSelect "Selection window"

 This window just contains a huge list of all possible items. The term
 @{u}active entry@{uu} refers to the selected (highlighted) entry of the list.
 This is important for functions like @{"Random" Link EditEdit} or @{"Clear" Link EditEdit}.

 There are two special entrys which you can (must) only place once into
 the playfield: The startplaces of Player one and two. It's also impossible
 to use @{u}Clear@{uu} or @{u}Random@{uu} with this entrys.

 @{" Statistics window " Link EditStat}

@ENDNODE

@NODE EditStat "Statistics window"

 This window displayes the amount of some items in the playfield:

 @{b}Emeralds@{ub}: Number of normal Emeralds and Emeralds stuck in a brick wall

 @{b}Diamonds@{ub}: Number of normal Diamonds and Diamonds stuck in a brick wall

 @{b}Nut@{ub}: Number of Nuts in the playfield

 @{b}Dynamite@{ub}: Number of Dynamite in the playfield

 @{b}Exits@{ub}: Number of closed and already open exits

 @{b}Keys@{ub}: Just the keys

 @{b}Enemys@{ub}: Number of each enemy in the playfield


 @{" Eater window " Link EditEater}

@ENDNODE

@NODE EditEater "Eater window"

 As you should know, you can get many different items after crushing an
 Eater. There are actually four possibilitys which are not attached to a
 special Eater but appear in the given order. The contents of Eater window
 number one always appears after the @{u}first@{uu} Eater was crushed no matter
 where or when, the second window is used after the @{u}second@{uu} Eater is
 crushed, again: no matter where or when.

 You may use every item out of the secetion window appart from the
 startplaces of the two players.

 @{" Value window " Link EditValue}

@ENDNODE

@NODE EditValue "Value window"

 This window is seperated into two parts:

 @{b}@{u}Score-Group@{uu}@{ub}:

   Here you can select the scores the player gets after performing certain
   actions:

   @{b}Emerald@{ub}, @{b}Diamond@{ub}, @{b}Dynamite@{ub}, @{b}Keys@{ub}: Score for collecting this item

   @{b}Nut@{ub}: Score for "popping" a Nut (throwing a boulder on top of it)

   @{b}Robot@{ub}, @{b}Spaceship@{ub}, @{b}Bug@{ub}, @{b}Eater@{ub}: Score for destroying the monster

   @{b}Exit-Time@{ub}: Score for every 10 seconds left after reaching the exit.

   Values range from 0 to 99.

 @{b}@{u}Miscellanous-Group@{uu}@{ub}:

   @{b}Playfieldsize@{ub}:

   Here is the possibility to adjust the playfieldsize. The minimum size
   is 10, the maximum size is 100. Note that these valus only specify the
   @{b}inner@{ub} space, there's always a steel-border around every level.

   @{b}Time@{ub}:

   @{b}in Game@{ub} is the maximum time the player has got to solve the level
   (in seconds). Note: Zero means unlimited time.

   @{b}magic Wall@{ub} is the time, the magic wall spins after getting hit by a
   Boulder/ Emerald/ Diamond. (in 1/10 seconds)

   @{b}Wheel@{ub} is the time the Wheel spins. (in moves!)

   @{b}Amoeba@{ub}: This is not a real time but a kind of speed-display. It's the
   speed the amoeba grows, the higher the faster - just try out some values.

   @{b}Forcefield@{ub} is the time the forcefield is up after collecting a
   frocefield coin (in seconds!)

   @{b}Extratime@{ub} is the time that will be added to your real time after
   collecting an Extratime coin. (seconds of course)

 @{b}Emeralds to Collect@{ub}: The amounts of Emeralds (and Diamonds) to collect

 @{" Highscore window " Link EditHigh}

@ENDNODE

@NODE EditHigh "Highscore window"

 No, it's not possible to fake Highscores :-) You just got the possibility
 to clear the Highscorelist.

 @{" Edit window " Link EditEdit}

@ENDNODE

@NODE Import "Import Levels"

 Since V1.1 the Diamond Caves Editor is able to load and convert Levels
 from other Boulder Dash clones.

 You have to select the type of Level you want to load:

 @{b}Balder's Grove@{ub}: These Levels are loaded including the extra steel border
 around the playfield because Balder's Grove supports Exits in the border.
 Note: The @{u}Snake@{uu} in Balder's Grove leaves 9 Emeralds behind, the @{u}Bug@{uu} in
 Diamond Caves 8 Emeralds and 1 Diamonds. You may have to increase the number
 of Emeralds to collect to match the new value.

 @{b}Emerald Mine@{ub}: This type includes Levels from Emerald Mine I, II and III.

 @{b}Emerald Mine CD@{ub}: I'm not sure if I've got the Leveldescription 100% right,
 so if you encounter any problems (e.g. questionsmarks in the playfield),
 please contact @{"me" Link DC:DiamondCaves.guide/Hawk}.

 If you want another Boulder Dash clone to be supported by the Diamond
 Caves Editor, feel free to contact @{"me" Link DC:DiamondCaves.guide/Hawk}.

 @{b}Load Level@{ub}: Will load and convert the level.

 @{b}Load&Save Level@{ub}: Will load the Level and save it to the currnt
 Leveldirectory either using the current number or the number taken from the
 filename, increased by one (see below).

 @{b}Exit@{ub}: Leave the Import window.

 @{b}Take Levelnumber from Filename@{ub}: This is important if you want to convert a
 whole set of Levels. If set to @{u}on@{uu}, the number the Level will be saved
 to will be taken from the filename, increased by one. This is necessary
 because EM-Levels begin with Level 0.

@ENDNODE

@NODE q1 "Why is the scrolling in the Edit window so slow and sticky?"

 Q:@{b}Why is the scrolling in the Edit window so slow and sticky? Especially
  with large Levels there is a delay between pressing the slider and
  getting an actuall response.@{ub}

 A:This is a problem of MUI. When you are pressing and moving the slider
  MUI sends a "Redraw"-message to my program, telling me to redraw the
  whole display! This can take a few seconds if you have a big playfield.
  Try clicking into the prop-container instead, it's quicker.

@ENDNODE

@NODE q2 "Why can't I share my Levels?"

 Q:@{b}I've got the Diamond Caves Leveleditor but my friends' unregistered
  copy of Diamond Caves refuses to load the new levels. What am I doing
  wrong?@{ub}

 A:The unregistered version of Diamond Caves is not capable of loading other
  levels than the ones that came with the distribution.

  If your friend really wants to play new Levels I think he is using (or
  wants to use) the game on a regular basis, so please convince him to pay
  the shareware fee.

@ENDNODE

@NODE q3 "Where are the images in the Selection-window? (1)"

 Q:@{b}Refering to the picture "Editor.preview" which was in the Diamond Caves
  Game archive, there were little images next to the itemtext, which is the
  only thing I got in the list.@{ub}

 A:These images are loaded using datatypes. Datatypes are only available
  under Kickstart 3.x.

@ENDNODE

@NODE q4 "Where are the images in the Selection-window? (2)"

 Q:@{b}I'm using the Diamond Caves Editor under Kickstart 3.x and most of the
  time the Images are loaded correctly. But sometimes there's just an empty
  space where the picture should be. Why?@{ub}

 A:This is an internal bug of MUI. Stefan Stuntz said that it will be fixed
  in MUI3.0.

@ENDNODE

@NODE q5 "How can I snapshot the windows?"

 Q:@{b}At startup time, all the window appear at the same place every time. Is
  there a way to snapshot the windowposition to make them remember their
  current position?@{ub}

 A:Yes, this is possible. The Diamond Caves Editor is a MUI application, so
  if you want to save the current window positions you should simply start
  the MUI preferences program and save the preferences to disk. You need a
  registered Version of MUI to do this, for more information read the MUI
  documentation.
