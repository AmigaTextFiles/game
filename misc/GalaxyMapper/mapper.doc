This is a small program I wrote because I had some difficulties in locating
planets using the standard map in Galaxy turn results.  So I wrote this 
program which reads the resultsfile and displays a map of the galaxy.  The
game I'm playing is V2.7, but I think this program can handle other versions
of Galaxy too.  But you never know...

Before you run the program, you should assign PLANETS: to a directory.  The
program will store there information about planet owners and sizes.  If you
don't assign PLANETS: to any directory, current directory will be used. The
program is quite small, but it allocates a lot of arrays and a 4 bitplane
screen, so it needs at least 65KB of CHIP-mem plus 140KB any kind of RAM.

You should start this program by typing 'mapper <filename>'. After that you
could go and make yourself a cup of coffee, because reading the file takes
quite a long time.  After the program has read the file, you'll be shown a map.

You can select any planet by pressing the right mousebutton while the pointer
is over the planet.  When the planet is selected, you'll see the name, owner,
coordinates and size of the planet.  You can measure distances from the selected
planet by pressign the left mousebutton anywhere on the map.

You can also select a planet by entering it's name or coordinates, there
are a couple of gadgets for that.  Pressing 'Quit' should end the program.
There two things you should remember: search for a planet's name is case-
sensitive and the coordinates are truncated to integers.

If you have any comments, bug reports or suggestions, I'd really appreciate 
if you could send them to me.  Here are my addresses:

Remember!  I wrote this program during a few nights, so don't be too demanding.
I haven't found any bugs, but they allways seem to appear only when they
can inflict the maximum amount of damage, so I can't be held responsible
for any damage this program may cause to other programs or to your equipment.    

I'm currently planning a better version of this program, please send me
any suggestions you might have.  Btw. this program was written in AmigaE,
many thanks to it's author Wouter van Oortmerssen!
