   · Installation is complete.
@endnode

@node "startgame" "Starting the Game"

      The game may be started from either Workbench or the CLI/Shell. 
   The game expects the moose.font to be in FONTS:  The game will work
   without the moose.font but the display will be slightly corrupted.

      After loading the game, you will see the "About" requester.
   Click OK to continue.  Now select 2 through 6 players or click "Load"
   to load a previously saved game.  

      There are a total of 44 territories on the map.  Each is
   color-coded to represent a zone as listed below:

         ----------------------------
            Color       Zone
         ----------------------------
            YELLOW      Austrian
            BLUE        British
            PURPLE      French
            RED         German
            LIGHT BLUE  Ottoman
            PINK        Russian
            GREEN       Independent
         ----------------------------

      The total number of armies you start with is determined by the
   number of players entering the game.  See the chart below:

         ----------------------------
          Players        Armies
         ----------------------------
             2             40
             3             35
             4             30
             5             25
             6             20
         ----------------------------

      Forty-eight BONUS CARDS give special temporary fighting abilities
   during the game.  As each card is used, it is recycled into the pile
   allowing another player to use it later.  The cards and their functions are
   listed below:

      ------------------------------------------------------------------
       #  Card       Description
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
       8  Admirals   ADMIRALs allow attack by sea during a turn.
                     After the turn has ended, the admiral's power is
                     lost.
       9  Agents     Each AGENT destroys FOUR armies on a fortress of
                     your choice.
       9  Fort Bonus Each FORT BONUS adds FIVE armies to your fortress.
                     For any armies above 99, you will be allowed to
                     deploy them on any territory as usual.
       8  Generals   A GENERAL gives added offense during an attack.
                     His power is lost after a single attack.
      14  Troops     Each TROOPS card gives you THREE additional armies
                     which you may place anywhere on the map.  Note
                     that all TROOPS cards are played at once!
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode

@node "setup"     "Setup"

      Throughout the game, prompts and other information is displayed in
   the text area at the top of the window.  When a new game is started and
   the number of players is chosen, each player must select a 'FORTRESS
   TERRITORY'.  This territory *MUST* be defended at all costs -- if it is
   defeated, the player is out of the game.  There are a few rules
   (and hints) for fortress placement listed below:

      · A fortress may NOT be placed in an Independent territory.
      · There may be only ONE fortress per zone.
      · A fortress on the sea provides good offensive capabilities.
      · A land-locked fortress may provide limited protection.

      After all players have chosen their fortress territory, each
   player, in turn, selects an unoccupied territory until all are claimed. 
   One army is subtracted from the player's armed forces and placed on the
   territory.

      Now, starting again with Player 1, territories are reinforced with
   remaining armies in clumps of five.  To place ONE army, click on the
   territory.  Additional armies may be placed by clicking several times
   or by using the 'ARMS BOX' to make each click count for 5 or 10 armies.
   The ARMS BOX is a cycle gadget located near the top left corner of the
   window.  The 'ALL' setting will place ALL remaining armies on the
   territory you click on.

      ** Note that if you try to place armies five at a time but have **
      ** less than five remaining, a requester will pop up indicating **
      ** a DEPLOY ERROR.  Simply reset the ARMSVALUE lower and resume **
      ** placing your armies until none are left.                     **

      Always be sure you know where you want your armies BEFORE you place
   them since there is no 'UNDO' function and armies MAY NOT BE MOVED at any
   time throughout the game.

      When every player has placed his/her forces, each player is asked
   for a password.  Use a different password every time you play but make sure
   it's something you can remember.  You will not be allowed to play your turn
   unless you correctly enter your password.

      After choosing a password, you will be prompted to select a 'HIDDEN
   ARMY TERRITORY'.  One territory may be chosen anywhere on the board to hold
   your hidden armies.  At any time during the game (even during another
   player's turn), you may bring out these armies and attack (if it's your
   turn) or defend.  The number of armies in your hidden force is equal to the
   number of bonus armies gathered from the last TROOPS card.  A few
   restrictions apply to hidden army placement:

      · Hidden armies may NOT be placed on a fortress territory.
      · Hidden armies MAY be placed on ANY OTHER territory even if you do
        not currently own it; however, you may only use the armies if you
        own the territory.
      · You may choose another player's territory to hold your armies. 
        As battle progresses, when you capture that territory, you may
        then bring out your hidden forces.
      · Place your hidden armies next to an enemy fortress so they may be
        used to destroy him.

      Player 1 starts normal play.
@endnode

@node "taketurn"  "Taking Your Turn"

      Each player's turn is divided into three phases:

      · COLLECT AND PLAY CARDS (optional)

         Each player is given a minimum of three cards to begin his
      turn.  One additional card is then given to the player.  Any
      FORTBONUS cards are automatically subtracted from your deck and
      added to your fortress.  The status bar shows that you were
      awarded additional fortress armies.

         You are given bonus cards at the start of each turn.  To use
      these cards, access them through the "Play Cards..." button at
      the bottom left of the window.  Next, a requester appears showing
      the number of AGENT, ADMIRAL and TROOPS cards available.  To play
      a card, click on it.  For the Agent, eligible target fortress
      buttons will be enabled for you to select.  A fortress is not
      eligible if it has been destroyed, if it is your own fortress or
      if the number of armies on the fortress is less than three.

         To use the ADMIRAL or GENERAL cards, click the checkbox at the
      top of the window.  Each admiral or general is good for one attack
      only!  Use them well!

         Selecting TROOPS will allow you to reinforce your
      positions.  Note that ALL TROOPS cards are played at once unlike
      the other cards which are played one at a time.


      · ATTACK (optional)

         To attack another player, first make sure the attacking and
      defending territories are adjacent or that there is an 'ATTACK
      LINE' drawn between them (Norway and Denmark may attack each other,
      for example).  Next, click on the attacking territory then click on
      the defending territory.

         All armies on the attacking territory are used to wage war
      against all armies on the defending territory.  The attack will
      continue until the defender is destroyed or the attacker has no
      armies left to continue the attack.  (One army must be left on the
      territory.)


      · DISTRIBUTE REINFORCEMENTS (End Turn)

         To stop attacking, select the 'End Turn' button in the lower
      eight corner of the window.  Reinforcement troops will be computed
      based on the number of zones you occupy, the number of players you
      have defeated and whether or not you own all of the Independent
      zone.  The equation is as follows:

      8 * (#players conquered+1) + 4 * (#zones) + 6 * (own Independents?)

      For example, a player who has conquered two other players, own 3
      zones and all the Independent territories receives

         8 * (2+1) + 4 * 3 + 6 = 42

      armies.  You may place the armies anywhere on the map.

      ** Note: If you attempt to place over 99 armies on a single  **
      ** territory, a requester will notify you of a DEPLOY ERROR. **
      ** Select CANCEL to place the armies elsewhere; select OK to **
      ** cancel deployment of all remaining troops.                **


      At any time, a player may bring out HIDDEN ARMIES by selecting the
   'Hidden Armies...' button on the bottom center of the window.  The
   current number of armies is displayed at the top of the requester.
   Click the checkbox for each player who wishes to bring out his hidden
   armies.  Click OK to bring them out.  Note that any player may bring
   out his hidden armies at any time -- EVEN IF IT IS NOT THAT PLAYER'S
   TURN!

      ** Note that if the total number of armies exceeds 99 on the **
      ** territory, any remaining armies will be destroyed.        **

@node "conquer"   "Conquering a Fortress"

      When you conquer a player's fortress, his resources become your
   own.  Specifically,

      · You receive additional reinforcements at the end of every turn.
      · The defeated player's armies remain in their positions but are
        realigned to serve you.
      · Any cards the defeated player owned are now yours.
      · The defeated player's hidden armies are destroyed.
      · The GENERAL and ADMIRAL checkboxes are updated to reflect your
        newly acquired power.
      · The 'Play Cards...' button is re-enabled until your next attack.
        Don't forget to use any new Agents or Troops before continuing!
@endnode

@node "winning"   "Winning the Game"

      When only one player remains, he is acknowledged the winner.
@endnode

@node "strategy"  "Strategy and Hints"

      Here are a few proven techniques to enhance the game:

      · ALWAYS be sure to strengthen your fortress.
      · Put your fortress on the open sea so that you can place most of
        your troops on the fortress for defense but can also strike at
        other players with an ADMIRAL card.
      · Try to occupy an entire zone to gain more reinforcements.
      · When you attack from your fortress, make sure you have enough
        backup coming at the end of your turn to replenish your forces!
      · Place your hidden armies next to enemy forts to use during an
        offensive.
      · Go after the weakest fortress quickly.
      · Take weak stabs at unfortified territories to prevent other
        players from claiming ownership of an entire zone.
      · REMEMBER: You capture the defeated player's cards AND armies!!!
      · Plot your attack path so you can defeat more than one player in a
        single turn.
      · Capturing enemy fortresses is the single best way to lock in
        increased troop distributions at the end of every turn.  You
        do not have to hold the entire zone to claim the additional
        troops.
      · If it's obvious you're losing, fortify your fortress.  Don't
        bother defending any zones remaining.  By concentrating your
        remaining forces on a single territory, you MAY be able to defeat
        opponents by attacking from your fortress via sea.

@node "limits"    "Limitations"

   - Pen sharing.  This is something for future expansion.  Since this
     game requires AmigaDOS 3.0 anyway, I need to learn about the pen
     handling stuff of graphics.library and use it.  Right now, MUI will
     map the 16-color battle map onto a display of fewer colors which
     can result in a hard-to-read display.  Also, if you're using
     MagicWB, the colors for each player may be very close together
     making it difficult to see which territories belong to which
     player.  In the near future, I will implement this feature.

   - Shoddy graphics.  I need new victory.iff and steelfortress.iff
     pictures.  The only restrictions are victory.iff must be 352 X 240
     since it is hard-coded into the program.  And steelfortress.iff
     must have it's hit-boxes in the same location since the program
     uses coordinate comparisons rather than individual gadgets to
     detect which territories the user clicks on.

   - Some sound effects are missing.  I don't have a digitizer and
     was unable to find even reasonably good sound effects for some
     actions.  SteelFortress uses DataTypes to load and play these
     sounds and the code is built in to this version of the program
     for the following sounds:

         ack.8svx          Acknowledged.  Positive confirmation.
         nak.8svx          Negative Acknowledge.  Error condition.
         plyr1.8svx        Introduces Player 1.  (Its Player 1's turn.)
         plyr2.8svx        Introduces Player 2.
         plyr3.8svx        Introduces Player 3.
         plyr4.8svx        Introduces Player 4.
         plyr5.8svx        Introduces Player 5.
         plyr6.8svx        Introduces Player 6.
         fighting.8svx     Played during battle.
         atkwins.8svx      Attacker wins battle.
         dfnwins.8svx      Defender wins battle.
         agent.8svx        Agent is used against enemy.
         admiral.8svx      Admiral is selected for attack.
         general.8svx      General is selected for attack.
         troops.8svx       Additional Troops are deployed.
         fortbonus.8svx    Fortress receives a BONUS troop deployment.
         fortdestroy.8svx  Fortress is destroyed.
         winner.8svx       Winner is declared.  Game over.

     To activate these sounds, just drop the sound files into the
     SteelFortress drawer.  The sounds will load when the game starts.
     Note: you will have to exit the game if it is running to get the
           new sounds.  Simply restarting the game will not re-load
           the sound effects.


   If anyone wants to contribute new graphics (especially AGA graphics)
   or additional or better sound effects, e-mail me at:

@node "releases" "Release History"

   Release 1.0    -  July 18, 1991
      Initial release.  Had numerous hard-to-track bugs which actually
      made the game more enjoyable so I left them in!  I had just started
      programming in "C" and, well, the program was a bit quirky but
      still fun!  (And it required ARP!)

   Release 2.0    -  circa 1994
      I tried to fix just the bugs and the load/save routines which were
      unpredictable under Release 1.0.  This effort required too much
      time as more and more bugs were found.  Release 2.0 was obliterated
      shortly thereafter.

   Release 3.0    -  July 25, 1996
      This version.  No bugs, I promise!
