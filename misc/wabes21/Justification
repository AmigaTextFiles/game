JUSTIFICATION

But why?  Why, do you ask, does the world need yet another Pac
Man clone?  Um ... wait, let me explain ...  I've got reasons.
Honest.

1.  I like Pac Man.

2.  I've played the versions of Pac Man for the Amiga and I haven't
found any that capture the feeling of the version I had on the
good old C64.

3.  I like cooperative games and I've always wanted to play Pac Man
with another player on the same screen (well, it's not a life long
dream or anything but I thought it would be fun).  It's easy to do:
you've already got a routine to handle one guy on the screen.  Just
call it twice.  I don't see why the original didn't have this option
since two player games on it were so ... well, boring, since one
person always had to be standing around.

4.  It was a good project to help me learn the fabulous AMOS
programming language, particularly the AMAL routines which handle
all the ghost and Wabes movement.


Anyway, I hope you enjoy Wabes.
