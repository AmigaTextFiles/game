INSTALLATION
------------
There is a short script provided to make a bootable gamedisk.
Just run it.
If anything goes wrong, format a new disk, make it bootable,
rename it to ForgottenMine1 and extract the disk.lha file to
it.

If you want to play the game from HD, just extract the file
disk.lha to a directory (ForgottenMine1 or something)
somewhere on the HD. CD to the directory and start
the according game (AGAgame or ECSgame). If the graphics
are corrupted, start the game without the startup-sequnece
(the game player doesn't like strange commodities and
non-PAL/NTSC WB-screens).
