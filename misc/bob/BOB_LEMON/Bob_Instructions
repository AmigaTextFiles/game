NOTE :

STARTUP-SEQUENCE must contain the line ASSIGN BOB_LEMON: XXX:YYY/BOB_LEMON
where XXX:YYY/ is the directory where BOB_LEMON is

e.g.

If BOB_LEMON is in DH0:GAMES/ then the line should read :
ASSIGN BOB_LEMON: DH0:GAMES/BOB_LEMON

The plot :-
~~~~~~~~~~~

Bob, having found himself in a maze with no obvious entrance or exits, must
travel through infinitely repeating levels and pick up little white things
for no apparent reason. Unfortunately, several ghosts seem to want to kill
him (again for no apparent reason).


The game :-
~~~~~~~~~~~

Select your levels (you can play any number between 1 and 9), by using left
or right. This will cycle through any levels in the LEVELS directory.
Pressing fire will add the level to the level list.

You must guide Bob through these levels for as far as you can or until you
get bored. Luckly there are various items for you to pick up which will make
the game easier and slightly less boring.

Bob starts off with a shield on so the ghosts can't hurt him. When his
shield is on Bob is green. When it wears off Bob turns yellow.

These items are :-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Red things - Makes Bob run faster (until he gets knackered).

Blue things - These are cunning disguises so the ghosts can`t recognise Bob.

Yellow things - These complete the level (very handy!!).

Green things - These remove all the walls and change them into white things
               (not so handy!!).

Purple things - These give you 1000 points (An extra life is awarded every
                5000 points)


The Block Types :-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Blank - An empty space.

Dot - All the white dots must be collected to activate the teleport.

Ice - As soon as Bob steps onto an ice block he carries on moving until he
      hits a wall.

Appearing Wall - This looks like a dot and must also be collected. When the
                 dot has been picked up the block changes into a wall.

Water - Very nasty wet stuff which kills Bob instantly 'cos he can't swim.

Wall - Cannot be moved through.

Disappearing wall - Disappears after a certain time.

Teleport - After all white dots have been collected this will change colour
           from red to green. When it is green steping on it will take Bob
           to the next level


Level editor :-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you wish to design your own levels then you must load BOBLD. Full
instructions are included with the level editor program.
