INTRODUCTION
    Welcome to this, the FULL VERSION of ABH. ABH is a one or two
player beat-em-up for higher spec Amigas. A fast processor (68020 ish)
is required, as is 2Mb+ of CHIP RAM. FAST RAM is also desirable, and
some extra memory above 2Mb is needed for reliable running. (See later
for news on 'littleABH' for those of us not quite possessing this sort
of power) 

REGISTRATION
    Registration of ABH is a mere 5UKP. Five pounds sterling. £5.
Got that? This should be sent to the snail mail address at the end.
Cash is sent at your own risk, and I would prefer cheques (UK), or
International Money Orders (Overseas). Sending more money will make
me very happy, and sending lots of money and nice letters/offers of
employment will probably persuade me to let you have the AMOS source
code. #8D
Send an email address if possible- this will make distribution much
easier...

REGISTRATION BENEFITS
    So what do you get?

 * The official ABH Character Editor. This MAJOR innovation allows you
to create and edit characters for ABH. At present, some version of AMOS
is required for bank creation, but I'm working on it.

 * Two extra characters for the game, both as additions to it, and
as examples of the editor in action.

 * Updates/Bugfixes of both the game itself, and the editors. If you
send me an internet address, these will probably be sent via that. If
not, you will get the occasional letter telling you what is available,
and asking you to send me a blank disc.... :)

 * .ACE (ABH Character Editor) files of all the characters in the game.

 * A set of IFF samples, including all those used in the game, for
use in your own characters.

 * HOPEFULLY, occasional extra characters. (I would like it if
registered users sent me any characters they create for distribution.)

If any annoyed SFII fans want to get busy with an Action Replay
cartridge or similar, and send me the graphics for SFII as
iff files, GIFs, or AMOS .abk files, then I will happily make them into
ABH characters . Any registered users who own a version of SFII will be
able to have these characters from me. (copyright reasons mean you 
must own that game for it to be legal, I believe)

LITTLEABH- the 1MB chip version

For anyone out there with a stock A1200, or some other system with 1MB or
more of chip RAM, there is a special version of ABH. This version, called
littleABH, uses cut-down graphics, and runs on systems with less memory.
It also has a new feature in platforms which literally take the game to
new heights #;) This version should be available, at least as a demo,
very shortly....

SETUP & RUNNING
    The archive ABHpart1.lha should contain this file, and a directory
called ABH. The files from the other archives belong in the
'Characters' directory of this directory. Floppy disc users should
read the file 'Floppy.readme' NOW. 

HARDISC INSTALL
A couple of points of note. Firstly, there are some .Cpic files which
are duplicated for the convenience of floppy disk users. You will
probably get some requesters pop up as you copy across asking if it
is ok to replace them- it is. Also, in the last archive there is
a directory called FloppyLocations. You don't need this- it is for
floppy users only. (I would suggest you keep it if possible, in case
a friend wants a copy :)  )

The only thing you really need to do is set up an
assign to ABH:, along the lines of:

Assign ABH: HardDisc:Games/ABH

Also, you will need to copy the two fonts in the Fonts directory to
your Fonts, and the Amos.library from Libs to your Libs.
(NB. If the two fonts should be named even slightly incorrectly,
all you will get when you run the game will be a blank screen. DONT
fiddle with them....)
Machines with little or no FastRam should boot with no startup to run
ABHDemo. If you do not set up a RamDisc, it may complain a little, but
keep clicking CANCEL and all should be well.

THE GAME
     Ok, assuming you get it working, ABH will firstly tell you
it was written in AMOS (hit fire to go on) (BTW, it is a good idea
to unplug your mouse now, because it can be annoying...)
     Once this has happened, you should see a menu:
                           ________________
                           |              |  
                           | 1P TOURNAMENT| 
                           | 1P CHALLENGE |
                           | 2P CHALLENGE |
                           |  DEMO MATCH  |
                           |     QUIT     |
                           |______________|

The Tournament option gets you into ABH proper- one player
against all the computer opponents in succession.  The other 
options are all pretty simple: 1P Challenge allows you to fight the
computer, 2p another player, and Demo is CPU vs CPU. Quit causes the
machine to tap-dance out of the door, singing 'my way'. (One of
these statements is still a lie, just a different one from the one
on the demo's readme)

     Once you have chosen what to do, you will be asked to choose
a character. The white square will tell you which character you are
currently selecting, and the name will be read out at the bottom of
the screen. If the computer is fighting, you will then be asked for
the skill level. AMOEBA is lowest, MASTER is highest. (not in a
tournament, however)

FIGHT! (the game itself)
-------------------------------
|       STATUS PANEL          |  <- You should now see the game screen.
-------------------------------     In the status panel, you can see:
|        MAIN SCREEN          |     Energy bars (red)
:                             :     Character picture
                                    Score (top for P1, bottom for P2)
On the energy bar is a white marker, which starts off in the middle.
This is the STRENGTH gauge- more on it later.

   Hit them a lot, don't let them hit you.

           Duck                            Punch/Uppercut*

* You will only get an uppercut if you are already ducking when you
press the fire button- ie down+ down & fire, rather than just
down & fire.

NOTE To turn around (when sensible) briefly centre the joystick.
     
The fire button has several uses:
1) Tap it to punch. (Don't do it- it's more responsive to use up/down & fire)
2) Press it in mid air to jump kick.
3) Hold down to: 
              *  Power up    (distant from opponent)
              *  Grab        (Arms length)
              *  Pin         (Standing over stunned opponent)

POWERING UP
   When you hold down fire, your character will begin to power up. The
little white STRENGTH marker will head for the middle of the screen. See
'STRENGTH' for full info.

GRABBING
   A Grab happens at close range if you hold fire. As soon as the 
characters grab each other, wiggle the joystick like crazy. If you
wiggle better, your character will throw the opponent (no fire held)
or keep hold of them and hit them up to five times (fire held). If you
hold & hit, keep wiggling- they can wiggle to try and break free....

PINNING
   This is just like a Grab & hit, but you automatically win the first
'wiggle' and start hitting 'em on the floor. Wiggle to keep hitting them,
again up to five times.

NB When grabbing, the raw physical strength of your character will affect
the outcome. For example, Sari is quite a lot stronger than Darkstorm,
and will almost always win a grab. As for QTX-031, he's a robot. Do you
think YOU could out-wrestle him?
 
STRENGTH
   The little white STRENGTH marker has two effects:
1) The nearer the center of the screen it is, the more damage you do.
2) If it reaches the end of your energy bar (as near to the centre 
as it can get) your POWERUP SPECIAL will be released when you let go of
fire.
STRENGTH will halve if you get hit, and go down a little each time you
attack. It goes up if you stand still (until it reaches halfway), and
up quickly if you POWER UP. Releasing your POWERUP SPECIAL will also
halve your STRENGTH.

SPECIAL MOVES
   These are accessed (usually) by a combination of joystick movements.
Your POWERUP SPECIAL is released as described above, and is usually your
most devastating move.
Tip: When doing a special, see that the character reacts to each movement
before doing the next. EG: down, down+away, away, away+fire would result
in Duck, DuckBlock, Retreat, and then the special move if done correctly.
With practice, this can be done pretty fast.

STUNS
   If a character gets hit four times in a row, they will be stunned
(down on floor with stars spinning around their head) Take this
opportunity to pin them, or to power up.

BLOCKING
    To block, back away from your opponent as they attack. Your character
will stick a relevant limb in the way of the attack. You will remain in
this pose until you stop holding the joystick in this direction. Since
there are 3 blocks, a good opponent can force you to keep tapping away,
by using different attacks. Also, some attacks (usually those hitting
below the knee) require a Duck Block instead (Down+away). Duck blocks
can also block attacks aimed at the stomach, but not ones which
would knock you over (eg. Hah Long's Dragon Talon)

BLOCK TYPES
    There are 3 types of block: 90%, 100% and WEAPON:
90%   : Takes 10% of the damage from a blocked attack.
100%  : Takes no damage
WEAPON: Takes no damage, AND can block shurikens, knives, fireballs etc..
A character will have one of these types of block, and it is important
to remember which you have....

ADVANCED STUFF
   'Turn Around Kicks'- or TAKs, are a special type of jump kick. When
you jump kick, you usually jump at your opponent, then press the fire
button. However, in Mortal Kombat II, and now ABH, you can jump over
your opponent, THEN kick, and your character will kick in the right
direction. This can basically be done any time you are facing the wrong
way in mid air...
   'Hop Kicks'- require good timing- basically, press fire for the jump
kick on the way UP, instead of down, a very quick surprise attack.
    Holding a special- you can delay the execution of all the special
moves in one way or another. For example, if you had to do:
Dowm, Down & towards, towards, towards & fire
to throw a fireball, you could walk forwards any distance before hitting
fire. Again, a useful surprise! With POWERUP specials, you can do
something else (eg jump, walk) after you release fire, before the
move happens. This means you can 'charge' the move, walk right up to
your opponent, and release it! (there is a knack to this...)
Blocking, and then instantly releasing a POWERUP can be deadly.....

THE ABH CHARACTERS:

Alexi Vroschev

   Alexi Vroschev is the token big strong Russian. He possesses awesome
strength, and tops off the effect with brass knuckledusters and
steel-toecapped, hobnailed boots. He believes that men are by far
the superior sex, and that Russian men are particularly tough.
BLOCK: 90%
SPECIAL MOVES:
Overhead Smash: A powerful double-fisted strike, which can also
shake an opponent off their feet, although this does little
damage.
Press fire, then move up & away (as if you wanted to jump back)

Shoulder Smash: A quick hop forwards, leading with the shoulder
Down, down & towards, down & towards + fire.

POWERUP: Power Punch
A horrendously powerful charging punch. Alexi has been known to
use this attack to fell Oak trees.

STRENGTHS: Fair reach, VERY powerful, second strongest character.
WEAKNESSES: Not all that fast, easily countered powerup move, bad
blocker.

Darkstorm

   Darkstorm is a mysterious character who seems to be an authentic
Japanese Ninja, although he will talk to no-one. He dresses entirely
in dark grey (unlike those poncy technicolour ninjas on.....) and
possesses blinding speed.
BLOCK: Weapons (ironsleeves)
SPECIAL MOVES:
Shuriken: The deadly Ninja throwing star.
Press fire, then move up & away (as if you wanted to jump back)

Teleport Punch: Darkstorm disappears into a cloud of black smoke, 
reforming on the other side of the screen to punch the opponent 
(also good for quick escapes)
Down, Down & away, away, away & fire

SmokeBomb: Darkstorm throws a smokebomb at his feet, and vanishes.
He will only reappear when he is hit, or hits someone.
Tap Down, Tap Down again, centre stick, away, away & fire

POWERUP: Ninjitsu Drain
  The ancient ninja had a mystical hand movement, which the suspicious
people of the time claimed drained the victim's very life force. 
Darkstorm's certainly does....
(Tap fire to stop Darkstorm once he has started draining)

STRENGTHS: Fast, good reach, good specials
WEAKNESSES: Not very tough or strong, some specials are hard to do.

Genma Kawajiri
   Genma is a martial artist from Japan. He started off as a student
of Hah Long, but grew tired of the master's spiritual approach, and
left to study Karate. He is a technical expert, and has a strong
Chi, even though he does not believe in it.
BLOCK: 100%
SPECIAL MOVES:
Crouch Punch: The classic crouching punch to the 'critical hit zone'.
Down, down & towards.

Whirling Kick: Genma spins forwards with a leg outstretched.
Down, down & away, away, away + fire

Short Jumping Kick: Genma leaps a short distance, bringing up his
leg very hard- a fast and painful attack.
Press fire, then move up & away.

Tornado Kick: A jumping kick, followed by a whirlwind kick to the
ground- a good air counter, or escape.
Tap down, then down & fire.

POWERUP: Earthquake stomp
The manifestation of Genma's strong Chi, this ceremonial stomp which
is traditionally used during training has a dramatic and earth-shaking
effect when Genma performs it. He is now banned from the local gym....

STRENGTHS: Quite fast, OK damage, good jumper and some handy specials.
WEAKNESSES: Not especially strong or tough, poor range on some attacks.

Hah Long
   Hah Long is Cantonese for 'Black Dragon', and is the name this
mysterious Kung Fu master has adopted. He uses Animal Kung Fu,
specialising in Dragon style, but using others when needed. A follower
of the mystical Gods of Light, the Dragon has trained many students,
including Genma, who left soon after initiation. Hah Long's strong
Chi and rapport with the Gods gives him control over the element of
Fire. He has been led to this tournament by a vision of a great
evil- but what could it be?
BLOCK: 100%
SPECIAL MOVES:
The Dragon Talon: Hah Long thrusts his fingers into the enemy's ribs,
closes his hands, and pulls. This hurts.
Press fire, then move up & away

Fireball: A fast, long fireball, but not especially powerful.
Away, centre stick, towards, towards + fire

POWERUP: Flame teleport
Hah Long is immolated into a pillar of fire, which gutters and races
across the screen to a new location, where he reforms.

STRENGTHS: Fast, good damage, above average physical strength, good
powerup (especially when combined with a block...)
WEAKNESSES: Limited range with most attacks, not that many special
moves.
(As a note, Hah Long is based on a 'Shadowrun' character I once 
played. The name is missing some accents, and is pronounced 'Ha Lung',
but is otherwise correct.)

Helena Ianenov
   Another Russian, Helena is a contortionist, a Snake-woman as they
are known in her native country. She became fed up with being considered
a circus freak, and took up Kung-Fu, using the Snake style which she
considered suited her well. Her special skills allowed her to master
this difficult style with ease. She comes to the tournament seeking her
fortune.
BLOCK: 90%
SPECIAL MOVES:
Adder Strike: Four quick hand strikes to the head- very nasty.
Tap down, then down+fire

Python Roll: A fast, dangerous roll across the floor, which 
literally bowls opponents over.
Down, down & away, away, away + fire

POWERUP: Spitting Cobra
How she does it is a mystery, but Helena can spit venom like that
of the infamous Spitting Cobra for a short distance. It is highly
corrosive, and hard to dodge.

STRENGTHS: Excellent range, good speed, some very good specials.
WEAKNESSES: Poor close up strength, low toughness, not the best
at blocking.

Marie Brasse
   A somewhat egotistical French gymnast, Marie originally took up
kickboxing to help keep fit. However, she soon realised that there
was good money to be had on the prizefighting circuit. Not a believer
in fair fights, she uses a special form of Fan Fighting to give her
an edge. Her ambtion is to break into movies. ("After all, I'm MUCH
better looking than that Rothrock woman....")
BLOCK: 100%
SPECIAL MOVES:
Backflip: Someone as aggravating as Marie often needs to escape...
Press fire, then up & away

Forward Flip: A quick way to attack, or get out of trouble.
Press fire, then down & forwards

Leg Throw: The spectacular 'Frank N Steiner' as some call it- Marie
grabs the opponent's head with her legs, and backflips...
Tap down, then down + fire

POWERUP: Dart Volley
To give her even more of an edge, Marie's fan is loaded with 
lethal poison darts. When she flicks it correctly, they are swiftly
unleashed...
 
STRENGTHS: Good range/speed, easy specials, good powerup.
WEAKNESSES: Not strong or tough, no really good offensive specials.

QTX-031
   In 1989, the Quintessential Termination eXperiment began. Sponsored
by the US Government, the aim was to produce the ultimate war-robot.
   In 1990, the first of the QTX series of robots was built. 
QTX-001 was a remote control unit, with poor performance.
   In July of 1992, QTX-027 was the first unit to be fitted with a
neural network. Combat performance was dramatically improved.
   By December of 1993, QTX-030 was undergoing final field trials.
QTX-031 was built, and 'sparred' with 030 to program its brain.
   On Christmas day, 1993, QTX-031 exhibited signs of sentience. No-one
noticed. 
   In January of 1994, QTX-031 destroyed QTX-030 using advanced 'morphing'
weapons technology- technology it was not built with. The unit then 
vanished, and is now considered rogue.
BLOCK: Weapons (force-field projector)
SPECIAL MOVES:
Firebreathing: QTX-031 has a throat-mounted mucilated napalm projector.
The resulting flame reaches temperatures above 1000 degrees celsius.
Down, down & towards, towards, towards + fire.

Drunken Monkey: A martial arts technique programmed into the QTX 
series. The robot flips back, then forwards, bringing the arm through
180 degrees in a mighty hammer-blow.
Press fire, then move up & away.

POWERUP: Morphing Gatling Cannon.
Observed once during the destruction of QTX-030, the robot 'morphs its
hands into two short-range gatling guns. The weapons are believed to
fire heavy calibre, high velocity shells at upwards of 300rpm.

STRENGTHS: Very strong up close, extremely tough. Excellent defensive
capabilities. Due to his/its weight, QTX-031 cannot be thrown.
WEAKNESSES: Poor jumper, slow. Does less damage than you would expect,
due to poor technique.

Red Wolf
   Red Wolf is a total mystery. He appears to be an authentic
North American Indian, yet his tribe was wiped out over a century
ago. He is also a blindfighter, who refuses to fight without a blindfold.
Legend says that his tribe, forseeing their doom, transferred their
lifeforces to one brave, who was to seek revenge. His gaze is said
to carry such age that none may look into his eyes and stay sane.
BLOCK: 90%
SPECIAL MOVES:
Spirit tomahawk: Red Wolf plucks a tomahawk from thin air, and
hurls it.
Down, down & towards, towards, towards + fire

Spirit aura: A pulsing blue sphere of energy from Red Wolf's chest
knocks down all who approach.
Down, down & away, away, away + fire

POWERUP: Soul Blindness
Red Wolf appears to vanish in a blaze of white fire. His enemy is
blinded by the power of the Indian's soul. Unlike Darkstorm's vanish,
Red Wolf will only appear if he is hit or forced to block- if he
hits you, he will not appear.

STRENGTHS: Strong & tough, excellent range, fair speed.
WEAKNESSES: Special is hard to use without practice, poor blocker,
not very fast.

Sarah Gyger
   Lead singer in a successful rock band, Sarah lives for adventure.
She likes nothing better than a good loud concert, with a bit of
DIY bouncing thrown in for added excitement. Somehow, Sarah has
mastered her latent psychic powers, which appear to manifest
themselves in the form of electricity, lending a blue aura to her
attacks, and giving her supernatural strength. She entered the
tournament simply for the hell of it....
BLOCK: 90%
SPECIAL MOVES: 
Psi-ball: Sarah siezes a ball of blue energy from the air, and
throws it at her opponent.
Down, down & towards, towards, towards + fire.

Teleport: Sarah disappears in a flash of lighting, to appear a
short distance away.
Tap down twice.

Lightning Kick: Three kicks and a roundhouse, delivered with 
stunning speed- very dangerous.
Move away, centre stick, towards, towards + fire.

POWERUP: Stormcall
Extending her electrical powers to the utmost, Sarah calls down
a storm of lightning around her, blasting all nearby. At the
same time, she levitates slightly.

STRENGTHS: Fairly strong, OK range and speed, nice specials.
WEAKNESSES: Bit of a glass jaw, poor blocker.

Sari Chen
   A street girl from Thailand, Sari is a lot tougher and stronger
than many people expect. She is an expert in kick boxing, and has an
eyewatering ability to hit people in new and interesting places...
BLOCK: 90%
SPECIAL MOVES:
Crouch punch: Sari kneels, and punches the victim in the....(ouch)
Down, down & towards

Double Jump kick: A firm boot with one leg, then the other.
Press fire, then up & away (as if you wanted to jump away)

Sliding uppercut kick: Sari slides forwards on her back, and kicks
straight up into.... (OOOooohhh.....)
Tap down, down, down & fire.

POWERUP: Shoulder Charge
Sari zooms across the screen, flattening anyone foolish enough to
stand in the way.

STRENGTHS: Good all-rounder, fairy tough, strong etc. Good repertoire
at close quarters, with easy special moves.
WEAKNESSES: A little slow, poor blocker.

Vicki McAllister
   Vicki was a student at Edinburgh University, who wrote a biology
thesis concerning the existance of werewolves. When her tutors scoffed
at her conclusions, she went to Loch Cumallen, where her research
suggested one of the legendary beasts might live. Unfortunately for
her, she found one, and now is afflicted with lycanthrope. She entered
the tournament to help satisfy the blood-lust that she must struggle
to control.
BLOCK: 90%
SPECIAL MOVES:
Flying Maul: Vicki lets herself go- for the throat, that is.
Press fire, then move up & away.

Spinning claw: Vicki spins on the spot, claws outstretched.
Tap down, then down + fire. You can steer Vicki during this
by keeping fire held down, and moving left or right.

POWERUP: Howl
Vicki unleashes a chilling howl, which destroys the resolve of her
enemies. Whilst she howls, few will be able to fight with any real
effect. (Press fire to stop Vicki howling. Anyone who has a nice
wolf howling sound effect, please let me know :)  )

STRENGTHS: Fast, powerful, quite strong & tough. A bit of a mincing
machine up close, and basic moves which help her get close.
WEAKNESSES: Little reach with most attacks. Has problems with

HISTORY, INSPIRATION AND RAMBLINGS
   Ok. Firstly if you've read all this, you deserve a medal. I hope
you enjoy ABH at least as much as you enjoyed this readme #8)...
ABH is a rather major project, which has taken over two years to
complete. In that time, it has changed a lot, new ideas have come
in, new characters have appeared, etc. I first decided to write the
game during a period of SFII addiction. My resolve was strengthened
by two games: SFII (amiga version) and BodyBlows. Why? Because they
were both so bloody bad, and I really got annoyed when I saw all 
those arcade-perfect console beat-em-ups, and none on the big A. 
Since the start of the project, other games have come along. If you,
like me, bought Elfmania, you'll probably understand why I was so
determined to put gameplay first. One of these days, someone with
an ounce of game designing skill will team up with the coders of
Elfmania, and we'll get a truly good BEU. I hope.
   I hope you appreciate getting ABH for nothing, and I truly hope
you register and have some fun with creating your own characters. 
Incidentally, I have Paul Felton to thank for telling me straight 
that if the code was any good, you'd be able to simply load in new
characters- it was this that got me started on the editor idea...
   I have a dream for ABH- we get people producing ABH versions of
comic book characters, film characters etc. We have others getting
the graphics out of crap games and console games, and turning them
into ABH characters. Imagine- Cammy VS. Kai Ti? M Bison VS. Matiki?
Sonic VS. Mairo ? =D - the possibilities are quite literally
endless, and through gradual improvements I hope to allow the
conversion of more and more characters, with stuff like Sub-Zero's
freeze bolt and Scorpion's harpoon being available. To close, then,
a quick 'Character wish list'- if you can supply any, please do!

                         speeds/sound were just all wrong.....

we couldn't go selling it off, but since none of it would be
advertised, simply distributed to registered users, I would HOPE no-one
would mind....
