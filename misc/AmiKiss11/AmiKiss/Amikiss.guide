@node Introduction "Introduction to AmiKiss"
Introduction

Kiss is based on a popular Japanese game called 'Kisekae' that translates
to "changing clothes".  The game involves manipulating and
overlaying items of clothing over the bodies of popular Japanese anime
characters. This game is not restricted to just changing clothes on
people either. Kiss data is available for battleships and mecha too.
The data is available at ftp sites, specifically venice.tcp.com in
/pub/anime-manga/software/KISS/kissdata.

I decided to write an Amiga version of Kiss after playing briefly with
a PC version. It struck me that this would be a nice project for me to
learn how to program Bobs and GUIs on my Amiga. It also gave my little
cousins something to play with besides violent arcade games.

This program is ShareWare. If you enjoy using AmiKiss, please send  
$10 US to my @{"address" link Author}. Any feedback or criticism is welcome
and encouraged. You can reach @{"me" link Author} by e-mail at victorng@dgp.toronto.edu.


Feature List

AmiKiss has several features which distinguishes it from other versions on
other platforms. As of September 1994, this is the only Amiga version of
Kiss that I know of.

- Dynamic loading of cell data for each set. This saves CHIP ram by only
  loading in the Cell data of items in the current set.

- Two preset work areas (640x400 and 448x320) to handle KISS data sets
  made for versions 2.18 and 2.24 (see the @{"Frequently Asked Questions" link FAQ}).

- Option provided to disable fixed cell images previously defined in
  the Kiss configuration file. This allows moving of characters' bodies,
  titles and undergarments that would normally be immovable.

- Scrollable window areas for Kiss play areas that are larger than the
  window dimensions.

- Handles a maximum of 128 different items on the screen (limited by 
  CHIP ram).

- Intelligent layering of clothes.

- Multiple palettes of 16 colours and multiple clothing sets supported.

- On-line help.

Background:

	I am currently a graduate student at the University of Toronto.
I'm working in Computer Animation and Computer Graphics. My research 
interests include biomechanical models for computer animation and motion
control for physically-based animation. I also am interested in geometrical
models for skin and articulated objects.

	Naturally, I am also like watching Anime films once in a while and
AmiKiss seemed like a nice project to work on as I learn to program my
Amiga 2000. It really is like a non-competitive game and I hope you enjoy
it.  I think it is about time an Amiga version was written.

@node Acknowledge "Acknowledgments"
Acknowledgments


I would like to thank several people for helping me create Amikiss and
this document.  Ito Takayuki gave me permission to include his Kiss 
Frequently-Asked-Question compilation, translation of the Kiss file format
and list of available Kiss data in this hypertext document. The routines 
for parsing Kiss files were derived from code written by 
ueno@acl.mech.tohoku.ac.jp (sorry I only know the e-mail address) in the
code for xkiss, an X-windows version of Kiss. 

My gratitude goes to Keith Vaglienti, Tommy Hwang, Roger Straub, 
Brenten and Tedd Hill for beta-testing and offering suggestions for 
AmiKiss. Thanks to Jeff and Ann, who helped to playtest AmiKiss
and offered me advice on how to improve the enjoyment of playing it.

Routines for creation and deallocation of BOBS and GELS were created 
through slight modification of the animtools.c example provided by 
Commodore in the Rom Kernal Reference manuals for Libraries, third edition.

I would also like to thank the programmers out there that have created 
software to help make the Amiga such an excellent platform and fun 
computer.  They really help to flesh out and give substance to our Amiga.
Please support them.

@node q1
WHAT IS KISS? WHAT IS "KISEKAE"?

  Kisekae is Japanese for "changing clothes". It's a popular play for
little girls. They are given "kisekae ningyou (dolls for changing
clothes)" and play changing clothes of the dolls. And, girls' manga
magazines sometimes provide paper dolls and clothes for kisekae.

  Kiss (KISekae Set system) simulates kisekae with paper dolls on your
computer. The Kiss system consists of a Kiss program and Kiss data. A
Kiss data is the set of pictures. The Kiss program displays the
character with several clothes (dress, shirt, socks, shoes, hat etc)
and allows you to changing the clothes by manipulating them.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode

@node q2
WHAT FILES DO I NEED? HOW CAN I GET KISS DATA?

  To play with Kiss you need a Kiss program and Kiss data. Kiss
programs are so far available for the following platforms:

file name	platform		conformance(*)
---------	--------		--------------
KISS236E.LZH	NEC PC-9801		KISS/GS2?
KISS68D .LZH	Sharp X68000		KISS/GS1?
KSTW236F.LZH	Fujitsu FM-TOWNS	KISS/GS3
KIS236B4.LZH	PC/AT PC-DOS, DOS/V	KISS/GS3
WKISS052.LZH	Microsoft Windows 3.1	KISS/GS4?
KissMac03.lzh	Macintosh		KISS/GS1?
xkis200c.tar.gz	X11R4 or later		KISS/GS4

(*)Description about KISS/GS is not done yet.

  Choose an appropriate one for your computer.
  The older version of Kiss for DOS/V did not work on plain PC-DOS
(MS-DOS) and you needed a TSR named "japanit" unless you have DOS/V. 
The latest version, however, should work well not only on DOS/V but on
plain DOS. (N.B. It needs over-256-color video card and VESA SVGA
BIOS.)

  Any other files except above are probably Kiss data files. They
often contain such a string like "KISS" or "KS" in their file name.
  Kiss programs and data can be obtained from the following place:

	venice.tcp.com (128.95.44.29):
	/pub/anime-manga/software/KISS

---------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode

@node q3
WHAT KINDS OF KISS DATA ARE AVAILABLE?

  Most @{"Kiss data" link list} are taken from female characters in anime/manga. If I
give you any examples you may be familiar with, there are Sailor
senshi, Hime-chan, Ranma-chan, Skuld and so on.
  There are many Kiss data whose picture is taken from shoujo manga
(comics for girls), which may be unfamiliar to you.
  In addition some weird Kiss data appear these days. For example,
Mobile Suits, battleships etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode

@node q4
HOW CAN I DEAL WITH THOSE .LZH FILES?

  .LZH files are archived with LHA, the most popular archiver in
Japan.  Now the LHA archiver is available for many platforms such as 
MS-DOS, UNIX, Macintosh and Amiga. Get the LHA archiver for your 
computer and extract the .LZH files.
  Note that some of .LZH files may contain files whose file name is in
Japanese (kana and/or kanji), which would seem to be a sequence of
strange characters on systems incapable of Japanese.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode

@node q5
HOW CAN I PLAY?

(now compiling)
  When you run the Kiss program, it usually displays the main screen
(where the character and clothes are), two rows of buttons numbered
from 1 to 10, a Save button and a Quit button. The first row chooses a
pattern of clothes out of ten. The second row chooses a palette group.
  You can change the clothes by dragging them with the mouse.
  The Save button saves the current arrangement of clothes in the
configuration file. The Quit button finishes the program.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode

@node q6
WHY DO I HAVE TROUBLE TO PLAY WITH SOME DATA?

Problem 1:

  Since Kiss is originally developped for PC-9801, Kiss for PC-9801 is 
a reference of other Kiss programs and all Kiss data. Kiss for PC-9801 
ver.2.18 and 2.24c have the following limitations respectively:

	item			KISS ver 2.24c		KISS ver 2.18
				(KISS/GS1)
	------------		--------------		-------------
	Kisekae area		640x400			448x320
	Max# of objects		128			48
	Max# of cels		128			48

  As you realize the table above, Kiss data designed for ver.2.24c may 
exceed the limitations of ver.2.18. Such data do not work correctly 
on ver.2.18.

  As to Kiss programs for other platforms, most of them conforms to
the specification of Kiss for PC-9801 ver.2.24c. However, the older
version of Kiss for Windows (KISW020F.LZH) conforms only to ver.2.18.
You should throw away it and get the latest version mentioned above.

Problem 2:

  Some of large Kiss data require much memory. On MS-DOS they may
consume not only conventional memory but expanded (EMS) memory. You
have to provide sufficient expanded memory to play with such data.

Problem 3:

  Upper/lower cases of file names in the configuration file could be
problematic if you use case-sensitive platforms such as UNIX and
Macintosh. If cases in the config file do not agree with those of
the actual file names, edit the config file or rename the files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode

@node q7
WHAT IS THE FORMAT OF KISS DATA FILES LIKE?
HOW CAN I MODIFY EXISTING DATA OR MAKE MY OWN DATA?

  The document about data file format is included in the archive file
of Kiss for PC-9801. The @{"English translation of the document" link file} is
available in the rec.arts.anime[.info] newsgroup. See the document for
details about the file format.

  You may need assistance tools to facilitate making Kiss data. There
are some released for Japanese PCs such as PC-9801 and FM-TOWNS, but
few for PC-DOS, Macintosh or X window system. There are PCX <=> CEL
converters for PC-DOS.

  As described in the document the file format is so simple that I
hope anyone would make such tools for these platforms.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode

@node q8
CAN I DISTRIBUTE KISS PROGRAM/DATA?

  Distributive conditions are usually stated in the document of the
program/data. In general, Kiss programs have no conditions/restrictions
about distribution, but Kiss data may have some conditions. Unless you
can read the document and follow the conditions,

	YOU MUST NOT DISTRIBUTE ANY KISS DATA

on BBSs or anywhere. When you distribute any Kiss data you should
not modify the contents of the archive file, except the archive format
(e.g. re-archive the files with PKZIP instead of LHA, etc).

  The file @{"kissdata.lst.ver.x.x" link list} on venice shortly describes
distributive condition of each Kiss data.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	PC-9801
	Kisekae program KISS.EXE ver 2.24c

	Data Creation Manual

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



1. FUNCTION AND LIMITATIONS OF KISS

	KISS is an image display program with transparency processing. 
	It comforms to the hardware of NEC PC-9801 series and therefore
	has the limitations:

	* Pictures are limited to 16 colors out of a palette of 4096 colors.

	The KISS program

	* Can overlap up to 128 pictures.

	And it has object manipulation functions with mouse manipulation
	so that it can be used as kisekae.

	* You can move the clothes and other objects with the mouse.

	In addition you can

	* Save the allocation of objects you have made.



2.	DATA FILES

	KISS has the following types of data files:

	* Cel files

		These specify the individual elements of picture data.
		There are 16 available colors, and color #0 is transparent.

	* Palette file

		This specifies the palette of 16 colors.
		You can at one time use 16 out of 4096 colors.
		A set of 16 colors forms a palette group.
		You can select one of 10 palette groups.

	* Configuration file

		This specifies how to overlap or locate cel data.
		Since it is a text file it can be made with a text editor.

		WARNING:
		A part of it may be overwritten by the KISS program when 
		the Save function is invoked.

		N.B.
		Most KISS data are created in the MS-DOS environment,
		thus the end-of-line codes in the configuration file are 
		usually CR/LF. You may as well convert them into appropriate 
		ones for your system before you play. e.g. CR for Macintosh,
		LF for UNIX (X window system).



3.	TERMINOLOGY

	Cel		A minimum picture unit KISS deals with.

	Object		A picture that consists of one or more cels.
			It is a basic unit moved with a mouse.

	Palette group	Palette information of 16 colors out of 4096.

	Set		A pattern of picture that consists of 
			a palette group and allocated objects.



4.	CONFIGURATION FILE (.CNF) FORMAT

	The leftmost character of each line determines the function of 
	the line.


	'='	Memory Size

		synopsis: =<memory>K

		Specifies the amount of memory KISS needs as the data area
		when starting up. This directive exists for compatibility 
		with ver.1 and is ignored in ver.2. It is recommended not 
		to specify it.

		e.g.

		=260K

	'('	Screen Size

		synopsis: (width,height)

		Specifies the size of the kisekae screen. Default is 
		(448,320), which is compatible with ver.2.18.
		The maximum is (640,400).

		e.g.

		(640,400)

	'%'	Palette File

		synopsis: %<palette file name>

		Specifies the palette file.

		e.g.

		%COL.KCF

	'['	Border Color

		synopsis: [<border color code>

		Specifies the border color. The range is within 0 - 15.

		e.g.

		[12

	'#'	Cel Files (multiple instances permitted)

		synopsys: #<mark>[.<fixed value>] <cel file name> [:<set#> ...]

		<mark>		The object ID. The cels of the same <mark>
				value will be treated as one object.
				The range is within 0 - 127.

		<fixed value>	Specifies that the object cannot be moved 
				in normal operation.
				The range is within 0 - 32767.
				The default is 0 (movable).

		<cel file name>	Extensions cannot be omitted.

		<set#>		You should specify this if you want the cel 
				data to be available only in particular sets.
				The range is within 0 - 9.
				If omitted, the cel is available in all sets.

		If multiple cel files are specified (you cannot play kisekae
		with only one cel, so you usually specify multiple cels), 
		the order of specifications represents the priority of cels.
		Up to 128 cels can be specified.

		e.g.

		#2	data1.cel			; upper cel
		#3	data2.cel	:2 3 4		; 
		#4.255	data3.cel			; fixed

@node install "How to Install AmiKiss"
How to Install AmiKiss


Installing AmiKiss is relatively simple. Make sure you have all the
@{"system requirements" link system} on your Amiga.

Step 1: Uncompress the amikiss.lha, preferably onto a hard drive as this
        will speed up loading of cell data. Cell data makes up the graphics
        for items of clothing, etc.

        lha x amikiss.lha <target pathname>

Step 2: Make a directory assign for KISSDATA:
       
        Assign KISSDATA: <target pathname>/amikiss

        This path will be used to located the on-line amigaguide help file,
        amikiss.guide. It also is the default directory for opening Kiss
        data sets. Any Kiss data archives should be uncompressed into
	its own subdirectory in KISSDATA:.

Step 3: Copy amigaguide.library into your Libs: directory.

Step 4: If running AmiKiss from the CLI, make sure your stack size is set
        to about 30000.

        stack 30000

        If running from Workbench, make sure the AmiKiss icon's 
        information requester has the stack set to 30000.

Step 5: To run, type 'AmiKiss' at the cli prompt or click on the 
        AmiKiss icon. Press the Help key for on-line help.

Step 6: Play and enjoy AmiKiss (see @{"How to Use AmiKiss" link use}).

@node session "The Session Menu"
The Session Menu

There are several options in the Session Menu:

About
	Displays information about the version and author of AmiKiss.


Open

	Kiss data sets should be uncompressed into their own directories
	that reside in the KISSDATA: directory. When you choose the
        'Open' option, you will get a file requester asking for the
        configuration filename. Simply go to the desired kiss data
        directory and select a configuration file (*.cfg).  AmiKiss 
        will load the Kiss configuration file for that particular data set.

        This file tells AmiKiss what cell data to use, where to 
        initially place them, and other details such as screen size. 
        This option basically opens a session to play with the chosen
        Kiss data set. Set A will be loaded in as default and the 
        title bar of the window shows the progress of cells being 
	loaded from the disk into AmiKiss.

        If there was no enough CHIP ram to load in all the cell data,
        you will be prompted with a message warning about this. AmiKiss
        will try to load in as much cell data as it can. In some
        cases, there may be so little CHIP ram left that the menus
        may not be rendered. You can still make menu choices by moving the
        mouse pointer to the approximate locations of the menu items even
        though they are invisible.

        AmiKiss will use the existing palette if no palette file is found.
	Any cell data whose corresponding files are not found will be
	ignored.


Quit
	Choose this option or click on the close gadget of the window
	to exit AmiKiss. You will be asked to confirm this choice.
@endnode

@node palette "The Palette Menu"
The Palette Menu

After loading a Kiss configuration, this menu will activate all available
palettes in the Kiss data set. Any unused palettes will be ghosted out.
Simply select on of these items to change the palette. The current palette
will have a checkmark beside it in the menu.
@endnode

@node sets "The Sets Menu"
The Sets Menu

This menu allows you to switch between different sets of clothing, 
clothing layouts and palettes within a Kiss data set. Each set may
feature different items of clothing or colour changes.

Simply select the set you want to load in. If the cell data is not
already loaded in memory, it will be loaded in from the disk at this
time. The title bar of the menu shows cell data being loaded in. A
checkmark will appear beside the current active set in the data.
@endnode

@node area "The Area Menu"
The Area Menu

This menu toggles between different window sizes. There are two choices,
(640 x 400 and 448 x 320), that correspond to version 2.24c and 2.18 of
the Kiss file format respectively. If a Kiss data set was designed for
one of these particular window sizes, one can just select the proper
window size menu item. A checkmark appears beside the currently selected
window size mode.
@endnode

@node flags "The Flags Menu"
The Flags Menu

This menu contains flags that adjust modes of use.

Fixed Cells

When this mode is activated with a checkmark beside the menu
item, cell data that is fixed in the configuration file will
not be moved. Removing the checkmark by selecting the item, will
free up any fixed cell restrictions and allow you to manipulate
all cells in the screen area. 

This option can be used to move the bodies of characters around,
titles, or backgrounds that would otherwise be fixed. In addition,
some KISS designers edit the configuration files so that various
undergarments are fixed. If you do not want these restrictions,
this option can override this.
@endnode

@node play "How to Play AmiKiss"
How to Play AmiKiss

Once you've loaded in a Kiss data set using the "Open" option
in the @{"Session" link session} menu, you can begin to play Kiss.


Moving Clothing or Items Around

	Not all items can be moved. Sometimes the person's body cannot
	be moved. You will know if something is movable if you click and
        hold on	the left mouse button and see the mouse pointer change 
        to a hand.

	If the pointer changes to a hand, you can continue holding down
        the left mouse button and move the item around on the screen. 
        As soon as you release the button at a point on the screen, the
        item will be placed in that last location.

	If an item of clothing is obscured by another piece of clothing,
	you must click on the unobscured part. If it is totally obscured,
	move the items in front out of the way by clicking and dragging
        them to other areas of the screen.

	Some items of clothing may have many little holes in it, like
	lace or panty hose. It is important that you click on the solid
	parts of these clothes and not the holes themselves. 

        If there is not enough CHIP ram available to build a movable
	cell for feedback during click and drag operations, AmiKiss will
	attempt to build as much of the cell as possible for feedback.
	In some cases, the feedback may only consist of the hand pointer
	if CHIP ram is very low.


Scrolling the Work Area

	If you are working with a screen size that is smaller than the
	work area, some items of clothing may be out of the bounds of
	the screen. You can scroll around within the work area by using
	the cursor keys underneath the Del and Help keys.


Getting On-Line Help

	Just press the Help key for Amigaguide help. When you are finished 
        with help, click on the close gadget at the top left hand corner of
        the Amigaguide screen.	

@endnode

@node bugs "Known Bugs/Problems"
Known Bugs/Problems

There are a few known problems:

	- If the Kiss configuration has many cells of clothing in one set
          and AmiKiss does not have enough chip ram to store the image 
	  data, AmiKiss will attempt to load in as much cell data as it
	  can. In come cases, there may be not enough CHIP ram left to
	  properly render the intuition menues. One can still
          choose items even though they are invisible.

        - If there is not enough CHIP ram left, on-line help may not be
	  able to open an Amigaguide window.

	- If many cells are missing, there may be an initial delay after
	  all the available cells are loaded in. After a small time-out,
	  the user can begin interaction again.

@endnode

@node history "Change History"
Change History

	Version 1.0: August 20, 1994
	   - finished first version of amikiss
	   - dynamic loading of cells when choosing new sets
           - double buffering to prevent flicker when all bobs redrawn

	Version 1.1: Sept. 6, 1994
	   - added on-line help
	   - increased feedback of moving items during click and drag
	     operations by creating a second GEL list for the front
	     window's rastport. This second GEL list only includes the
	     bobs to be moved to speed up drawing.
@endnode

@node future "The Future of AmiKiss"
The Future of AmiKiss

There are several improvements I'd like to perform on AmiKiss.

	- The ability to mark out a section of the AmiKiss work area and
	  save it as an iff file.

	- Add sound effects so that the characters can give sly comments
	  as you dress/undress them.

	- Decrease the reliance on chip ram. Since the characters and their
	  clothing are implemented as BOBs, this requires quite a lot of
	  chip ram if there are many items. Perhaps dynamically building
	  the items and deallocating them will free up more chip ram at
	  the expense of response time.

	- Increase dragging feedback by rendering only the item to be moved
	  at the expense of loss of priority information which causes the
	  clothes to overlap intelligently.

        - Write an iff brush to Kiss cel converter.

	- You think of some and e-mail me at victorng@dgp.toronto.edu.
