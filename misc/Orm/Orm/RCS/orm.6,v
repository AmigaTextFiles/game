.TH ORM 6 "Amiga Games" "October 21, 1993"
.nj
.SH NAME
orm - a simple snake game
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
From the shell: orm
From Workbench: double-click on the icon
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Orm is played on a 40*40 matrix which fills a window on the default
public screen (usually the Workbench).  You are the grey dot (assuming
the default colours) in the centre - to increase in length (the object
of the game) you must eat frogs (the white dots) while avoiding bricks
(the blue dots).  Frogs come and go randomly, but there are always
four of them at any moment.  One in ten disappearing frogs is replaced
by a brick.  If you hit yourself, a side wall or a brick you die; once
your length is greater than one you cannot reverse your direction.
.sp 1
Movement is with the cursor keys; once a game has started you cannot
stop moving.
Press a cursor key to start each game.
Other keys are SPACEBAR to pause (any key to unpause) and ESC to quit.
.sp 1
The game adjusts itself to give a decent aspect ratio on screens of
different resolutions.
.SH REQUIREMENTS
Orm requires AmigaDOS 2.04 or higher.
.SH FILES
(PROGDIR:|LOCALE:)catalogs/#?/orm.catalog
.SH TRIVIA
The word Orm means worm or snake in Danish.
.SH AUTHORS
The original game, called Snake, was written and put in the public
domain by Michael Warner, who also the original version of this manual
page.
.sp 1
This improved version was written by Torsten Poulin, who, as you may
have guessed already, is a Dane, which explains why the grammar of
this docomentation may be slightly odd.
.sp 1
To honour Michael's decision, this version is also in the public
domain; let's keep it that way!
.SH BUGS
Adjustment to the screen mode should be better.
The window is a bit too tall on NTSC screens, and looks really awful
on VGA-ExtraLoRes screens.
.sp 1
The situation where the user has specified a system default
font, that makes the dragbar so tall that the window won't fit the
screen, isn't handled gracefully.
