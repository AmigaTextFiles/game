$VER: Adventure MiniDash docs 2.00

These f*cking docs are in english, so why not to go and learn it?

Hm. All programs around seems to have some kind of user's manual with them.
Why should my MiniDash be an exception? So, here we go: Some document about




		Archy's Adventure MiniDash version 2.00





published by 'The Only and LAME.... Archy!' in 'co-operation' with Morque!

;--------------

I can hear folks going 'Where the h*ll was version 1.00?'. Well, I never
published that... it was too sh*tty. Bugs, bugs, bugs and lots of bugs. Instead
I re-coded it from the ground up. Months of bug-fixing and developing and
finally....

AdventureMiniDash (or AdvMiniDash or MiniDash or AdvMD) is SOFTWARE. So, if you
use it, USE IT!!!!!

I'd want it to be Pirateware. So, if anyone wants you to copy a commercial
game to him/her, copy him/her this game instead.

Jyffe wanted it to be Pityware. So, if you pity it, send me the stuff
mentioned later.

Actually it's Freeware. Copy it to anyone who wants it, as long as you
don't take any money for it.

;---

PD DISTRIBUTORS:
This program MAY NOT be sold for higher price than reasonable disk and copying
expenses, say... 10FIM or 2US$. If anyone gets rich selling this program, it
should be me. Fred Fish, however, is granted to include this game into his
Fish software library, even if a Fish disk's price containing AdvMD was higher.

;---

And: NO WARRANTY. If this program destroyes something, I won't take any
responsibility about that.

Zorkki vaan.

Hardware requirements:

-Amiga
-Joystick

and of course a picture tube/eqv. (RGB recommended), mouse, one disk drive,
power supply, connection cables etc. and one sick-minded Boulder Dash maniac
(that should be you :^).

Memory consumption: Starting executable takes roughly 190kB of Fast and 125kB
of Chip mem. Official Gamefile loaded: 250/125. Sounds on: 250/272. 512kB
users are shaking. In Editor: 250/292. In Extras editor 250/388. 512kB
users are dead. In Intro, with sounds=music on: 254/514! ½MB chip is
insufficient, sorry.
Without music, In Extras editor 250/240. In Intro 250/265. So, without
music 512kB chip and 512kB (slow)fast is enough for playing AdvMD.
For music, tune in Radio Mega/eqv.

;---

FILE PLACEMENTS AND THAT KIND OF STUFF:

AdvMD main program may be placed anywhere.
Samples may be may be placed anywhere.
Gamefiles may be placed anywhere.
Just start AdvMD, go to file requester and type in paths to those string
gadgets and click 'S prefs'. Then, when started again, AdvMD will know where
to search from. Prefs will be saved as

prefsfilename:	dc.b	"s:AdvMD.prefs",0

Got it? He-he, go and learn some Assembler.

Ok, that should do it. Then something not so heavy text:

;-----------------------------------------------

		SECTION	History,DATA

I got the idea of this game as early as five years ago. I had a C-128
and 120 disks. I found a game called 'Boulder Dash 1-16' and liked
it rightaway, and so did my roomate (and best friend), too. We played
it hours after hours. About the same time I learned C-64 machine code
programming with only an 8kB sized machine code monitor. One night I
suddenly invented the 'core' of Boulder Dash. There's a table in memory,
wherein one byte is one stone, fly or Rockford on the screen. Then I
just have to scan thru the table byte by byte and see, what is next to
the byte, that is, next to e.g. Rockford in the screen. Sooo simple!
But: Without an assembler I never could have coded the game in C-64.
After two years I bought an A500 and sold the C-128. I learned how to
use Amiga. Then, guess what. I started playing Amiga's Boulder Dash!!
I tested everything about materials in Amiga's BD and finally created
80 caves and 21 2-player caves together as a complete BD game disk.
That disk should be in distribution. I've never heard about it from
the globe. Maybe it didn't spread at all. Nah, who cares (but ME!)?
After having an Amiga for six months I learned how to use Seka assembler
and basics about Amiga assembly language.
Two years ago I coded my first working Boulder Dash routine. It was
black and white, one bitplane version but still Rockford followed the
joystick, dug ground and pushed stones. I showed it to Fix, who drew
some 8-color graphics for it. I continued developing my MiniDash,
miniature version of Boulder Dash. I created all 'normal' materials
of BD into it. In addition, I invented some new materials, icecube
and Sampo. After being released from military service I lived in a place
without anything to do but coding. Then I got a wonderful idea:
There's one cave on the screen, but if there were doors in the walls...
Rockford could go to next cave and come back again!!! I coded a few days
and succeeded to get it work! Then I got tired and very depressed. I
was like a prisoner at home. There was nothing to do, no place to go to,
no friends, nothing. After eight months of that LIVING HELL I moved to a
city. I started living again, I got my friends back. One day I showed
the Adventure MiniDash to Fix. First, he thaught it was the same game
as earlier. Some new materials, nothing else. But, when I showed the
doors around walls and told him to go thru them, he was amazed! New
idea for a game, nothing less was born. The game was, however, full
of bugs. So I buried it for a few months. One day last summer ('93) I was
visiting Fix and we started talking about AdventureMD.
Somehow, we decided it to be done in hires-lace 8 color mode. Fix said:
"I'll draw the graphics, if you do all the rest." I responsed something like
"Let's see next autumn, when it's dark, cold and wet outside. Maybe I begin
coding it then". However, soon after that I coded a program that opens a
screen and draws one MD character on the screen. Next day I coded routines
for a stone. Then I visited Fix, and showed it to him. He drew something, but
didn't copy it to me. So I drew my own graphics and went on coding Adventure
MiniDash, 16-bit version. 16-bit stands for characters being 16*16 pixels.
;--
Now it's about two weeks I typed that text above. Fix drew graphics and I
inserted them into the game. Now Rockford looks like a living, little caveman.
All I have to do is to debug the game and...


;---------------------------------

BUG REPORT! BUG REPORT! BUG REPORT! BUG REPORT! BUG REPORT! BUG REPORT!

Known bugs of the program:

Strange bug when saving gamefile! Causes a Guru and DESTROYES THE GAMEFILE when
overwriting an existing gamefile. BE CAREFUL! The bug doesn't
appear too often, but when it does, gamefile will be gone. It did it once
to me and once to Hot/Morque. Sorry about that.

Arrow doesn't kill a fly/eqv. when hit from its left. Another strange bug,
that I couldn't fix. Somehow, it just doesn't work. Sorry about that, too.

All timing (speed of the game) including Intro music is locked to 50Hz Vertical
Blanking interrupt. Using 72Hz/eqv. vertical frequency (I don't know if that is
possible to) in AdvMD screen, game speeds up and Intro music won't be played
correctly. I'm too tired to fix that. Well, usually games are too slow, not
too Fast.

AND: Muchos, muchos bugs caused by different errors. I didn't test all possible
error situations, so, after an AdvMD requester might happen a crash/eqv.
After that, try to avoid the situation that caused the error.

;---------------------------------

		SECTION	Usage,DATA

When you start the program, only a room filled with ground and Rockford in the
middle of it appears. You can either load a gamefile or start editing one.

Loading gamefile: click 'File' gadget in the bottom of AdvMD screen. Edit path
and gamefile names as needed and click 'load'. If nothing goes wrong, first
room of loaded gamefile appears on the screen. If not, check path and filename.
Sorry for no fancy file-requesters, I wanted this game to work without any
external libraries. 512k Amigas might have problems enough already.... :^)

Starting game: press firebutton OR click 'Start' gadget!

Stopping game: Click 'Stop' gadget or 'Quit'.

Editing game: Click 'Editor' gadget. NOTE: If you loaded a gamefile, you'd have
to enter password of the loaded gamefile to use the editor. If you don't know
the password... tuff luck. In that case, to use the editor select 'CLR ALL'
from file requester. Then again 'Editor'... and so on.

Sounds: Click on 'Sounds' gadget. Audio channels will be allocated and samples
will be loaded. When you click again, channels and chip memory needed for
samples will be freed.

One more gadget in the main window: About. Just click it!

Keys active during game: 'F' toggles filter on/off, '<space>' or 'P' pauses
the game, 'M' activates/inactivates mine if Rockford has one, 'S' speeds
game up *4. Useful, when waiting for a cheese to grow or something like that.

Rockford controls: Move stick to move Rockford. Hold button and move stick
to collect a diamond/collectable thing or push stone/bomb/icecube etc. or
when there's enough space, shoot an arrow. Hold button and push stick upleft
or upright to make Rockford to throw a stone/bomb etc. that he's holding up.
Hold button for two seconds or press 'm' to (in)activate a mine.
To use a collected thing (bible/ring/cross etc.) grab mouse and click on
the thing to be used.

you get the required key simply hitting the keyboard.


Well, that's briefly what this game appears to be. Now it's time to go
deeper and examine some basic materials used in this game.

;---------------------------

		SECTION	Materials,DATA

Hmmm.... Maybe you've played some kind of Boulder Dash earlier. So, I'll
explain only differences and additions between BD and AdvMD, in random order.
In editor, select any material to see the name and a brief explanation about
it.

Yellow cheese:	Like slime in 64BD. When max. size is -1, doesn't die at all.
		When trapped, stays active and spreads again, if released.
Green cheese:	Spreading speed is exponential. When there's one cube of this
		cheese in a room, it doesn't spread at all. When there's two
		cubes, spreads as fast as yellow cheese at speed 1. When grows,
		speed increases.... In addition: pushes icecubes, may eat
		Rockford....
Magic wall:	As in 64BD or AmigaBD, but may produce anything....
Teleport:	Teleports Rockford into another room. Usage: Stand under it and
		press fire.
Space Invader:	Another bright idea of mine. Have you ever played any kind of
		Space Invaders????????
Spider:		Just a spider. There's always spiders in every castle.
Kryptonite:	Tchernobyl rules :^). Idea from my damaged brains...
Nurse:		Some Hack athmosphere.
Bat:		What, a game without bats? No way!
Pacman:		Like yam-yams in AmigaBD, but 6 different explosions in AdvMD.
Sampo:		From a book of fairy-tales called 'Kalevala'.

Lift:		The simpliest active material on Earth, © me.
Black hole:	FuXXX Sucking kind of material. Stay outside!
Doors:		As in AmigaBD, here used also for going from a room to another.
Quiver:		Shooting in Boulder Dash? Yes, please! Inholds 20 arrows.
Mine:		As in AmigaBD, in AdvMD they can also fall like stones. Collect
		them, they're Rockford's secondary weapon.
Cross:		Nurses seems to avoid this.
Query:		You can never know, what happens...! When Rockford collects
		this, some material turns into another in the whole room, e.g.
		space might turn into flies or brickwalls into diamonds. Just
		test, if you dare! Might be lethal!!
Magic:		As above, but this is invisible (looks like space) and Rockford
		has only to walk thru this to activate it.
Magic ground:	As above, but looks like ground.
Glasses:	When eyes are not enough. See invisible walls and doors,
		growing walls, GndBricks and magics.
Growing walls:	From C64 BD. Whenever there's space, grows. Nasty material when
		placed into a narrow corridor.

InvDoor:	Invisible door, looks like steel. No key needed to pass.
GndBrick:	Rockford can walk thru it, regardless of it looks like brick.

	Last two materials inspired by Marjo and Marko Kelhä. Thanks!

		SECTION	Yawn,DATA

As mentioned earlier, I'm sick of coding this game. There's loads of
software ideas scrolling around in my skull, in a place called 'brains'. I have
to get them out. So, there are bugs in this game, not lots of, but there are
bugs. Anyway, I'll spread this. If I didn't, it would slowly die in my disk
case.

LAST MINUTE... eh... LAST MONTH NOTE:

It's really June 1994. I started coding AdvMD 2.0 last June. I'd better kick my
own butt to get this game finished and published. Over a year is just too
much work to be used in only one game. Well, I've done some other things
during the year, too. I've been forced to reduce the time of sitting in front
of my A500 quite a lot. Work takes a little of my time, and I should also sleep
sometimes.
Anyway, I've upgraded my Quantum to be 105LPS instead of 52LPS. A few days ago
I bought a modem and today a friend of mine gave me a 68HC000P12 with clock
pin cut off (The M.: Thanks!). Maybe I'll try to upgrade my A500 to 14MHz.
Computing still goes on. I like to listen to great ProTracker modules and
watch Blitter-Spinning, Copper-Cracking, MIPS-faking demos.

But: NOW it's time to cut the cr*p. This game takes off to seek its fortune,
so do I. Have a nice, peaceful life.
