  Mission:
  ~~~~~~~~

      Your mission is to fly the ship and land succesfully.

      The following things can prevent you from succeding the mission :
      - Obstacles ( If you bump against them -> No Landing Here !)
      - Screen borders ( If you bump against them -> Out Of Space !)
      - Gravity (Newton rulez !)
      - Friction ( There is no ;-)
      - Countdown ( You have limited time -> Out Of Time !)
      - Landing speed (High speed -> Kamikazee Speed !)
      - LIVES ( Game Over )

      @{b}If landing speed < 5 : Bonus Life @{ub}

   Control:
   ~~~~~~~~
    Keyboard mode : (see @{" Configuration " link config} )
        (Cursor keys)
        Up arrow    = force up
        Left arrow  = force right  :-)
        Right arrow = force left   :-)
        Space       = start game, next level
        Esc         = exit (You can only quit on the first screen !)

    Joystick mode : (see @{" Configuration " link config} )
        Down         = force up
        Left         = force right  :-)
        Right        = force left   :-)
        Fire         = start game, next level
        Esc (key)    = exit (You can only quit on the first screen !)
