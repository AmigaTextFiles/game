NOTES ON RELEASE 1.31

This is release 1.31. It corrects the problem which was screwing up the graphics on
pre-WB 3.0 systems. Also added another option, to either save and quit or just quit.
Here's the list of enhancements over 1.21:

	-	Double Buffering! It took some work, but it's here and it's smooth
		as silk. Note that in order to accomplish this and remain 2.04
		compatible, the gadgets at the bottom of the screen had to be
		removed.

	-	Texture mapped graphics! This is the way I always wanted the
		graphics to be - no wimpy polygons. I finally figured out how to
		do it quick enough. I think it's a very nice effect.

	- 	Nice haze effect on map screens.

	-	Rewards from the crown for your exploration efforts.

	-	Note that logfiles are now turned on, not off.

	-	The usual tinkering with the economy factors.

I think that this is a very good release. Please prove me right by 
registering for the game. Remember, registered users get a MAP EDITOR!
Fun, fun, fun. Enjoy the new release, and happy exploring.
