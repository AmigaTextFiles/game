               ------------------------------------------

Hollywood Trivia is being released as Shareware, please feel free to upload
it to any BBS.  However, your archive must contain all of the original
files, including this one.  Hollywood Trivia is copyrighted and may not be
sold for a profit (except the normal disk copying fee).


If you play Hollywood Trivia and like it (I hope, I hope), please send a
$5.00 shareware donation to

	Kirkland, Wa.  98034

I have set the shareware fee very low considering the time and effort that
went into writing this program.  If users show an interest in this game
updates will be released.  This could include new pictures, new subjects
and questions, and an editor allowing you to write your own questions.

               ------------------------------------------


                         ** SET-UP INSTRUCTIONS **

This is easy.  Once you have decompressed the archive you should have two
directories (Pictures and Text) and three files (HollywoodTrivia, 
HollywoodTrivia.info and ReadMe).  Copy these files and directories onto
a freshly formated disk and you're ready to go.

NOTE: If you have a disk optimizer such as BAD or FlashDisk! I suggest
      you use it to perform the above copy operations.  These utilities
      do a great job of speeding up disk access and reducing drive noise.

               ------------------------------------------


                          ** PLAY INSTRUCTIONS **

HollywoodTrivia is a very easy game to play, simply double click on the
icon and follow the prompts.  After the opening screen is displayed click
the left mouse button to continue.  Once the game screen has scrolled open,
go to the subject menu and choose a topic.  Each topic contains fifty
questions and a related picture.  After a few seconds of disk access the
first question will appear, along with four possible answers.  Now just
click on the gadget next to the answer you want.  Every time you answer a
question right you will be shown a small portion of the picture in the
blue graphics box.  Once you have answered all fifty questions the entire
picture will be displayed and you will be asked to choose another subject.
There are eight subjects containing a total of 400 questions.

  Hint - If you come to a question that you find very difficult,
         pick this option and you will be given a hint.  One of

                    pick this option and you will be shown the correct

                    during each subject. The number (x) indicates how
                    many free answers you have left.

               be pushed to the rear, giving you access to Workbench.

ALL of these files and directories must be present for the game to function.

Do not delete or rename any of these files.

If you ever get an error message from the game it is most likely due to a
corrupt or missing file. Check the list above and make sure all of the files
and directories are on your game disk.

You can play Hollywood Trivia from a hard disk or from RAM.  Please note
that the directories -Pictures- and -Text- MUST be in the same directory
as the game program.

for improvements, please let me hear from you.
