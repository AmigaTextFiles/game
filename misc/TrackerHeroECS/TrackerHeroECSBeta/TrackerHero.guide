##
## 2.2 From the Workbench
##
@node Lancement_WB "Launching from the Workbench"

    From the Workbench, just double-click on the icon TrackerHeroAGA
    to start the game.  The @{b}"tooltypes"@{ub} available are:

    - USE_GUITAR : Changes the default control to Guitar control instead 
                   of the keyboard control. You can play in this mode 
                   without a guitar if you press up or down in the 
                   keyboard/joystick. Works with Paul Willingham adapter.

    - USE_DANCEMAT: Changes the default controller to Dance mat. You can
                   also play with a joystick using the four directions.

    - USE_KEYBOARD_PSX64 : Changes the default control to Keyboard control.
                           You need the PSX64 PS2 to C64/Amiga Adapter
                           and a PS2 Guitar

    - USE_GUITAR_PSX64 : Changes the default control to Guitar control.
                         You need the PSX64 PS2 to C64/Amiga Adapter
                         and a PS2 Guitar

    - DIFFICULTY : allows you to change the default game difficulty. This
                   will change the number of buttons you can press ingame.
                   Allowed values are 1,2 and 3. 1 means normal (4 buttons)
                   , 2 means easy (3 buttons) and 3 means 2 buttons (very
                   easy).
               
    - PREVIEW_SONGS  : Activates the song preview by default.

                
    - CUBE       : Activates the rotating cube rendering. If you have an 
                   unexpanded Amiga you want to disable it.
                
    - PARTICLES : Activates the particle rendering. Disable it to get some
                  more speed.

    - NTSC : Forces the game to start into NTSC mode.

    - CLOSE_WORKBENCH : Closes workbench screen at startup and restores it
                        after exiting the game. Use it if you need more
                        Chip Ram to run the game.

    - BUTTON_RAWKEY_1: Use the keycode value in Hex to change the ingame
    - BUTTON_RAWKEY_2: keyboard controls: The four buttons and the fire 
    - BUTTON_RAWKEY_3: button. The keycode values for each key  can be
    - BUTTON_RAWKEY_4: found in the picture KeyCodes.iff which is in the
    - BUTTON_RAWKEY_FIRE: game folder.

## 3 Play Modes
##
@node Play_Modes "Play Modes"

    You can choose to play the game using the "keyboard mode",
    "guitar mode" or "dance mat mode". The "guitar mode" is similar to the Guitar Hero games,
    where you press the note key but it has no effect until you press the 
    action key. "keyboard mode" is similar to Dance Revolution games where
    the game reacts when you press the note key. The "guitar mode" is 
    excellent when played with an adapter to the PS2 guitar, like the one
    from Paul Willingham.

    You can connect a dance mat the adapter as well and play using the
    "dance mat mode".

    If you use PSX64 adapter with the guitar you should select
    a PSX64 mode. If you want to use the strum select "Guitar PSX64".
    If you are using the adapter without the guitar you can use the
    "dance mat mode" to play.

    As at this time few people have one of these adapters the default
    mode is the "keyboard mode".

    You can change the default mode using the Tooltypes.

## 5 adding songs
##
@node Adding_Songs "Adding New Songs"

    To add a new song you will need two files. The MOD files and the DAT 
    file. The name for them should be the same, including extensions, but 
    the DAT file should end with ".dat".

    The dat files must be copied to the datas folder while the mod files
    must be copied to a folder inside the songs folder. You can create 
    extra folders for your songs with names like "custom", "games", "chip"
    , etc.
   
    There are some extra dat files included in the folder, if the mod with
    the same name is copied to a song folder then it will become playable. 

    To create the dat file you can use the Dat creator tool included with
    the game.

    Old mods work very well in the game and are easy to add. I hope 
    somebody (other than me) starts creating dat files and uploads them
    to Aminet. Of course, some new mods are welcomed :)

TrackerHero Beta 1(v0.7)
========================

Welcome to the first beta of Tracker Hero. The aim of this beta is to show 
the progress of the development and let the musicians test their songs. Sorry 
if we haven't included a lot of mods in the build but it takes too much time 
to test them. This version is fully playable but it's probable that if you 
play it for a long time the machine will eventually crash and you'll need to 
reset it.

The game requires an Amiga with AGA chipset.
It has been tested on an Amiga 1230, Amiga 1260 and WinUAE. Having some fast 
memmory is highly recommended. Last time I tried it with a plain 1200 it 
worked but the framerate wasn't very good.

The mods of the game are in the song folder, each folder is a song set. 
Additional song folder can be included and mod files can be moved between 
folders.

The mod's in the custom song set won't be included in the final version, 
because some of them are from games or versions of commercial songs. For 
example, I don't think Aminet would allow it. But I have to look into it, 
because it could be fine to include some of the mods. Anyway the idea is to 
leave the data files so if the user has the mod and copies it to the custom 
folder he can play it in the game.
