@node "Introduction" "Introduction - What is AMIgotchy ?"
@{fg shine}@{bg fill} Introduction@{fg text}@{bg back}
  This is the @{fg shine}first virtual pet for the AMIGA@{fg text}® computer.
  The pet must be fed, you must play with it, you must
  switch off the light when it wants to sleep, you have
  to give it some medicine, when it`s ill and so on..
  This is exactly that what was called »@{fg shine}Tamagotchi@{fg text}« at
  first (this name is a registered trademark of Bandai,
  so don`t use it!). Now there are tons of clones and
  some programs on other platforms. Even a Java(TM)-Applet
  exists. But as far as I know, there`s no real clone or
  even anything near to it on the AMIGA®, so I had to
  write one :-) .. here it is!

   @{fg shine}@{bg shadow}Enjoy it!@{fg text}@{bg back}

@node "Usage" "Usage - how to use AMIgotchy"
@{fg shine}@{bg fill} Usage@{fg text}@{bg back}
  Well, I don`t think you can use an animal, but how else should
  I call it ? :-) Ok, no kidding! Let`s begin with this part:
  It describes the buttons, the displays and how things work together.

  When you start AMIgotchy, a window opens with a display on the left
  and some buttons on the right. @{"Watch this screenshot" link "Docupix/Screenshot.ilbm/main" 0}

  Let`s go through the functions of the buttons:
  @{"Feed" link "/Gfx/Feed.bsh/main" 0}
   When your AMIgotchy opens and closes the beak or the "Hungry"-Display
   blinks, you must feed your AMIgotchy. If you don`t feed it, it will
   get smaller and smaller until it`ll die.. the health will also go down..

  @{"Light" link "/Gfx/Light.bsh/main" 0}
   When you can see a "ZzZ", it is tired and sleeps.. Switch off the light
   and it`ll be happy, when it wakes up and its health will be better!
   When it flies around DON`T switch off the light (try to fly in the dark :)

  @{"Play" link "/Gfx/Play.bsh/main" 0}
   Every little child wants some entertainment. So your AMIgotchy also
   wants to have. If the "Happy"-display is down, you should click on
   the button. When it doesn`t sleep or fly, you can play with it by
   clicking in the left or right half of the display(the arrows will
   show you, which direction you are clicking). If AMIgotchy looks in
   this direction, it`s a bit happier and jumps around. The happier
   your AMIgotchy is, the more actions it will do, so if this worth
   is very low, you won`t see much of the moves, AMIgotchy can do.

  @{"Give medicine/Fight viruses" link "/Gfx/Antivirus.bsh/main" 0}
   If you see the @{"skull" link "/Gfx/Dead.bsh/main" 0} in the top,
   left corner, your AMIgotchy is ill, so you have to give it some
   medicine until it disappears and (if audio is unused) it cries
   "Whohoo!". When you hear "Oh, it just get`s worse and worse!"
   this is a warn-signal to you.. your AMIgotchy is about to die
   soon, when you don`t help quickly!

  @{"Clean the bottom" link "/Gfx/Clean.bsh/main" 0}
   Your AMIgotchy is a simulation of a living bird, so as a bird
   lets fall a small "present" from time to time, AMIgotchy also does.
   If there are more than 5 "presents" on the bottom, your AMIgotchy
   will automatically get ill due to hygienic problems. If you press
   this button, all those little presents will be taken away and it
   will be clean again.

  @{"Discipline" link "/Gfx/Forbid!.bsh/main" 0}
   Sometimes your AMIgotchy tells you, that it is hungry, although
   it isn`t. It`ll get fat, when you feed it then. So discipline it
   and it won`t ask you for food, if it doesn`t need some (that`s
   when the Hungry-gauge is below 33 percent). Of course it`ll get
   a bit more unhappy, but it doesn`t query you for feed any longer,
   when it doesn`t need some!)

  · more anims, more sound, more multimedia!
  · several kinds of AMIgotchys
  · a 3D-version called CyberGLotchy :-))
  · individual AMIgotchy-P.I.S. (Pet Imaginary System)
    for every born AMIgotchy with preferences and so on..
  · network-AMIgotchy, so that you can build up a family ??
  · AMIgotchy tells its name and learns it better and better
    every day :-)
  · I`m open for your comments, wishes, ..
  · colored AMIgotchy (you will be able to turn this off in prefs then)

  @{fg shine}Sleep from h(12 h long)@{fg text}
    Your AMIgotchy needs some recreation, so it sleeps 12h long. You can
    set here, from which hour of the day it should sleep (e.g. if you set
    21 h, it sleeps from 21 h to 9 h). This is useful for sysops :-)

    You can give your AMIgotchy a name. This name can be entered here.
    
  @{fg shine}Speed@{fg text}
    Set your prefered AMIgotchy-life-speed here :-)
    
  @{fg shine}Maximum Age (+-8 y)@{fg text}
    This mysterious oracle tells you, how old your AMIgotchy MIGHT get.. maybe
    it gets older or doesn`t even get 2 AMIgotchy-years .. DON`T kill it, if
    you have a low worth.. maybe you set a new record ?
    
  @{fg shine}Task-Priority@{fg text}
    If your machine gets slower when running AMIgotchy, set a lower worth and try
    again..

  @{fg shine}Volume@{fg text}
    The volume of all sounds can be set here.
    
  @{fg shine}Password@{fg text}
    Do you want to protect your AMIgotchy from "unauthorized" access ? Enter
    a password here, and you will be asked to enter it, when starting AMIgotchy.
  
  @{fg shine}Reset current AMIgotchy@{fg text}
    Resets your AMIgotchy, so you can begin from the start.
