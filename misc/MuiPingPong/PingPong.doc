@NODE allgemeines "About"

Ping Pong is an old classic among the computergames. Who doesn't know the
old consoles with their paddels and the games Ping Pong, Squash and Tennis.
I've searched for this games but didn't find any good version, so I tried
to do one myself. Unfortunately the first version was full of really nasty
bugs. I hope they're gone with this version.

Meanwhile I got a new friend, MUI. Ok, that's a reason to write a game with
this package. But attention, this is only a betaversion. ;c)

Ok, now some features:

    The sprites can be seen with Kickstart 3.0
    It's a bit more font sensitive.
    I've included a 2 player mode
    The speed is slightly variable now.
    Pingpong won't work with Kickstart 1.3 and less. ;c)
    You can move and resize the window.
    You can win against the Computer.
    It will work in Interlaced Mode.
    I have included some samples.
    etc ...

Todo:

    I'd like to make it work on networks.
    Perhaps I'm going to include a Monica Seles Sample soon ;c)
    etc ...

@NODE physik "Physics"
I guess every player with a bit of physical education will notice that the
movement of the ball doesn't fit with phyical reality. This has a simple
reason. In the very beginning of this version the game was written very
tight to real physics. But I've recognized that this makes the game very
boring because it was too easy.

@NODE kopieren "Distribution"

Ping  Pong is Mailware. You may copy it to all of your friends, but it
would be kind if you'd send me a postcard or a letter or even a EMail if
you like this game.

Public Domain series:

Permission is granted for Fred Fish and SaarAg. All other series may use
this program as long as they don't charge more then 5 US-$ or 6 DM for a
single disk. It would be nice too if they'd send me a short note.

Mailboxes, etc:

I'm going to spread this game via Aminet. But other Mailboxen may use it
too.

Magazines:

You may put it on your coverdisks. But it would be kind if you'd send me a
note and if you'd send me the magazine for my collection :c)

Rights:

The copyright of this program is mine. But I can't take any responsibility
for possible damages made by this game. This archive may only be distributed
in unchanged state.

Important:

Persons who support violence against foreigners aren't allowed to use this
game.

@NODE steuerung "Steering"

    Player 1 uses the left Shift and Alt key. Player 2 uses the right
    Shift and Alt key. (Only in 2 Player mode)

Gadgets:

    About:      Opens the About Window

    Setup:      Opens the Setup Window

    Pause:      :c)

    Quit:       Quit...

Tips & tricks:

- Set the speed of the ball and the rackets to the same value, this will
  give you best results (IMHO)

- The difficulty gadget sets the strength of your oponent.

@NODE system "Hardware"

    Simply take an Amiga with at least Kickstart 2.0 :c)
    Further on you'll need @{"MUI" link mui} 2.0

    Hint:
    =====

    If you're no registered MUI User by now, simply pay your fee to @{"Stefan" link mui}
    and you'll receive your own Keyfile pretty soon and you'll support the
    development of such packages.
