@Node Introduction "WolfPac: Introduction"

WolfPac is a 3D Pacman clone, so all you have to do is to eat all pills you
find in the labyrinth, without being caught by the ghosts. If you have eaten
all pills (the pillcounter on the informationpanel in the game shows how
much of them are left) you will advance to the next level.

@{b}Orange pills@{ub} are the "normal" ones.
@{b}Blue pills@{ub} will make you invulnerable for a short period (the ghosts are
half as big during this time).

@endnode



@Node Installation "WolfPac: Requirements and Installation"

WolfPac should run on any Amiga with @{b}OS 3.0@{ub} or above, a @{b}68020@{ub} or above
(PPC supported), @{b}2 MB free RAM@{ub} (approximately 500 KB free Chipmemory) and a
graphicmode with at least 320*200 pixels in @{b}256 colors@{ub}. However a faster cpu
(>=68040 25 Mhz or PPC) and a fast graphic card are recommended.

To use the PPC Version (WolfPacPPC) you need a PowerUP board from Phase5 (or
any other 100% compatible board) and at least V45.16 (V45.20 or higher is
strongly recommended) of @{b}ppc.library@{ub} installed (note: some boards have the
ppc.library in their ROM). You do not need any extra program to start the
PPC version nor any patch - just doubleclick its Icon.

The @{b}installation@{ub} is quite easy: copy the program to wherever you
want, but keep the directory structure as it is.

@Node Usage "WolfPac: Usage"

@{b}The screenmoderequester:@{ub}

Select one of the offered screenmodes - the bigger the screen the faster has
to be your computer (or the slower is the game :) - most current Amigas are
not fast enough for a higher resolution than 320 x 256, with a PPC you 
can probably use 400 x 300 or more (strongly depends on your graphic card).
It makes no sense to select a 15, 16 or 24 bit deep screen. In general
screens on a graphic card are much faster than AGA screens (and PAL or NTSC
is faster than Euro 72 or Multiscan). If you do not use a graphic card
expect WolfPac to be much slower than with one and you´ll have to use a small
screenmode and "Shrink View" (in the main menu) to achieve an acceptable
framerate.
WolfPac is designed for screens with an aspect ratio of 4:3, that
means it will look better on 320 x 240 or 400 x 300 than on 320 x 200 or
320 x 400.


@{b}The titlescreen:@{ub}

The program calculates some tables to speed up mathematical operations
- depending on your machines cpu this can take a while, after that you can
press any key to continue.


@{b}The options menu:@{ub}

Use the @{b}cursor@{ub} keys or @{b}8@{ub} and @{b}5@{ub} on the numeric keypad to move the cursor and
@{b}Space@{ub}, @{b}Enter@{ub} or @{b}Return@{ub} to activate the selected menu entry.

Select a viewsize for the "3D window" (using "Grow View" and "Shrink View")
- the bigger the view, the faster has to be the machine (and the graphic card).

After selecting "Start Game" the first time with the current viewsize the
program has to calculate another (viewsize dependent) table - this again can
take some time (but if you play another round with the same viewsize you
don´t have to wait again).


@{b}The map:@{ub}

Press any key to continue.


@{b}The Game:@{ub}

Use the @{b}cursor@{ub} keys or @{b}8, 4, 5, 6@{ub} on the numeric keypad to move
and turn. By pressing one of the @{b}alt@{ub} keys together with one of the
"turn keys" or by pressing @{b}7@{ub} or @{b}9@{ub} on the numeric keypad you can move
sideways.

Use @{b}f@{ub} to switch between three floor rendering modes: hi-resolution,
half-resolution and no floor (this can help to adjust the game to your
machines speed).

@{b}s@{ub} toggles between "number of frames rendered per second" shown or not.

Pressing @{b}Esc@{ub} ends the current game.

At the end of a level press any key to continue.

@Node Bugs "WolfPac: Known bugs and limitations"


WolfPacPPC tends to crash with a ppc.library < V45.20 when exiting the
program. So you should really use V45.20 or higher.

Sometimes a wall very near to the player isn´t rendered.

If you are very near to a wall a wrong column of pixels appears.

Walls beside the player are stretched - thats a problem of the current
rendering engine.

Bad behaviour in low memory situations.

If a window on another screen becomes active while pressing a key, WolfPac
forgets about releasing the key. You have to make the WolfPac screen active
and to press the same key again to bring WolfPac back in the "normal" state.

The statuspanel is not sized to fit the screen - maybe in a future release.

Added two levels.
Added new sounds.
Removed the noise from the old sounds.
Updated the documentation.

New 3D to 2D projection.
Enhanced player movement.
Enhanced keyboard control (removed shift key, added 7 and 9).

Should be more stable in low memory situations.


@{b}1.01  16.04.97 minor update:@{ub}

Some small changes to the documentation.


@{b}1.00  24.03.97 First official release:@{ub}

Some small changes.


@{b}0.95  15.03.97 Competition Prerelease:@{ub}

New levels, new graphics, new sounds.


@{b}0.86  28.02.97 Second Prerelease:@{ub}

New levels, much more graphics, first sounds (a bit experimental).
Removed the "sometimes some walls disappear in some way" bug.


@{b}0.80  07.02.97 First Prerelease:@{ub}

The engine adapts now to the computers speed.
Added "Shrink View" and "Grow View" (had to rewrite a lot of code for that :(
The engine can now work with "any" screensize.
Added a screenmoderequester.
Added a "real" floor (instead of a faked one).
Added some new graphics.
Increased the speed, but lost it (and more .( with the floor again.
Dropped the version for native retina screens.


@{b}?.??  03.12.96 Decided to continue the project WolfPac:@{ub}

Just wanted to make a "releaseable" version quickly, but then it became more
and more ... (it was much more effort to make a game out of the "demo" as I
had imagined)


@{b}?.??  21.08.95 Made a version for Intuition screens.@{ub}


@{b}?.??  06.07.94 Ported the PC version to the Amiga@{ub}

It was systemfriendly but with retina output only.


@{b}?.??  03.06.94 "Finished" the PC version @{ub}

It was some kind of a demo for the 3D engine and not really a game.


@{b}?.??  ??.03.94 Startet development of the PC version @{ub}

We had the possibility to make our "little Doom" as a practical training for
the university. So Clemens Zauner, Gerald Schrettl and I wrote the basic 3D
engine of todays WolfPac - it was the fastest of all "doomlike" programs of
this course.

@Node ToDo "WolfPac: To do"


There are many things, which make WolfPac "not professional" - this will
never change (or the form of distribution will change too :), but there are
some things I want to see in future releases (without any guarantee that it
will ever happen and without order). Some of this points will be part of the
upcoming @{b}WolfPac 2@{ub}, which will be more like a complete new game than just
another version of "this" WolfPac.

* more levels, graphics and sounds

* Joystick support

* AHI support

* a "real" ceiling for some levels

* scores and highscores

* a leveleditor

* extras (others than the superpill)

* different kinds of Ghosts etc.

* speedup of everything :)

@Node DISCLAIMER "Disclaimer, Copyright, Usage and Distribution conditions"

@{b}Distribution@{ub}

@{b}WolfPac@{ub} is @{b}SHAREWARE@{ub} but the current version is not limited in any
way (this may change in the future). If you send me 15 Dollar, 30 Mark or
200 Schilling (or anything else representing this value) I will send you a
keyfile which will "open" you all features of upcoming versions of WolfPac.
If you think WolfPac isn´t worth any money (or just not as much as it costs),
feel free to use it anyhow, but it would be nice to receive at least an email
(even if it´s full with bad critics).

@{b}Wolfpac@{ub} (without keyfile) can be distributed in any way, as archive, as
long as its original archive is unchanged, or unpacked, as long as it is
runable, complete and without additions or changes to the directory and its
files.
