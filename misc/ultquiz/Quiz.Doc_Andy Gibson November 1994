      2. Information:
      ~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~

      This   game  was  rated  at  a  massive  95%  in  Amiga  User
      International  Issue  June 1995 and a demo version also appeared on
      the  August  1995 coverdisk of AUI.    So you know it's another top
      rated production from AGAS (Andy Gibson's Amiga Software)   Just as
      a  quick  note, both my quiz games are amongst the highest rated F1
      Licenceware  Titles to date !    ;-) The ratings have encouraged me
      to  keep  producing DATA Disks for this volume of the game and more
      details can be found at the bottom of this text file.


      This  is  a  PD  Demo Version of the Complete 2-Disk F1 LICENCEWARE
      Title.

      This means that a lot of the features have been cut-out of the code
      for obvious reasons ! 

      This PD Version has been released with only 50 Pop Music Questions!

      As  you  read  through this document you will realise just what you
      are  missing  out on if you don't purchase the full version of this
      game.

      ie. : ALL OPTIONS ENABLED
          : BONUS ROUND
          : DATA DISK FILLED WITH QUESTIONS/MUSIC/PICTURE
          : SOUND FX & MUSIC
          : QUESTION CREATOR UTILITY
          : QUESTION PLAYER UTILITY
          : HUNDREDS MORE QUESTIONS TO PLAY
          : ABILITY TO USE OTHER DATA DISKS COVERING MANY SUBJECTS

      You  even  have the chance to make yourself some cash by buying the
      complete  version  !!!    (Although I can't guarantee or claim this
      to be true).

      With  the  supplied  utilities,  you  can create your very own DATA
      Disks  for  use  by  yourself,  or  you  could  release them via F1
      LICENCEWARE and get paid a royalty for every copy sold. 
      No  coding  experience is necessary  as  all  you  do  is  type  in 
      a text editor and use the supplied utils to convert your text files 
      - easy way to make money!

      Don't just take my word for it.  Purchase the full 2-disk version &
      see  for yourself how much better the game is and how easy it is to
      create your own personalised DATA Disks.

      -------------------------------------------------------------------




      5. Playing Instructions:
      ~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Well what can I say ?  Just plug in your Joystick and away you go !


      When  the  game  loads you will be presented first with the options
      screen.  From here you can select/toggle these options:

      START GAME    -   Simply Starts the Game.
      TIMER         -   Toggle Timer On/Off    * DISABLED on PD Version *
      CREDITS       -   Toggle No. of Credits  * DISABLED on PD Version *
      SAVE SCORES   -   Toggle Score Saving    * DISABLED on PD Version *
      QUICK HELP    -   Instructions and Information.

      Simply  move  your  Joystick  Up/Down  and  press Fire to select an
      option.



      (STARTING A GAME)
      -----------------
      You  will  notice  that  the  START button is flashing and the Hand
      pointer is limited to that button only.

      To  display  the  questions  - Press the Fire Button when the START
      Button  is  flashing.     (if  you don't, you will eventually see a
      cheeky message !)

      A question & three answer options will now appear on the screen.
      Along with the sexy Sue sprite animating her mouth !   OoooErrr!
      (This is to make it look at though Sue is saying each questions)

      The START button will stop flashing and the A, B and C buttons will
      light  up  with  their  own  colours  now.    The Hand pointer will
      automatically be positioned (and limited) to the A, B and C buttons

      You  will  notice that the three answer options are colour coded to
      match the A,B and C Buttons at the bottom of the screen.

      You  can  now  select  your  answer by moving the joystick left and
      right  until  the  Hand  pointer  is  over  your  choice of answer.
      Simply press the Fire button to select it.



      (THE TIMER)
      -----------
      The  Timer  Bar  will  start  to scroll away AFTER the question and
      three answers have been printed on screen.

      This gives you time to read the question before countdown begins.


      The  Timer will stop when you have either run out of time or if you
      select A, B or C by pressing the Fire Button.

      You   will  then  be  told  on-screen  whether  you  have  answered
      correctly, wrongly or if you ran out of time.



      (SCORING)
      ---------
      Credits  are  displayed  as  £'s  on  the  game screen.    
      eg. 3 Credits = 30 pence

      The less Credits you have - the harder the game will be !


      You start each game with:

      £ 0.00 Score
      £ 0.30 Credits (You cannot alter this in the PD Version)


      If  you  answer  a  question correctly, you will gain 10 pence onto
      your  score.     You  will  also  light  up  one of the BONUS ROUND
      letters in the top right of the screen (randomly).    You will also
      get a nice smile from sexy Sue !   :)

      If  you  manage  to answer 10 questions in-a-row correctly then you
      will enter the BONUS ROUND (Disabled in PD Version !).


      If  you  answer a question wrongly, you will lose 1 credit !    (10
      pence)  You will also lose any BONUS ROUND letters that you managed
      to  light up!    (You need 10 correct answers in-a-row to reach the
      bonus)  A  frown  from  Sue  shows  that  she  is unhappy with your
      performance !    :(


      If  the  Timer  runs  out, you also lose 1 precious credit !    You
      will also lose any BONUS ROUND letters that you managed to light up
      (You  need  10 correct answers in-a-row to reach the bonus) Another
      frown from Sue !    :(


      If you run out of Credits, then it's GAME OVER I'm afraid !

      Yet another frown from sexy Sue in the corner !   :(



      (BONUS ROUND)
      -------------
      If  you managed to answer 10 questions correctly in-a-row, you will
      have  lit up all the BONUS ROUND letters on the top right hand side
      of the screen.

      The Hand pointer will now be positioned over the BONUS button which
      will now be lit up also.

      You  will  see a message on-screen telling you that the Bonus Round
      has  been  DISABLED  for  this PD release !    Simply press Fire to
      continue.



      (HiSCORE)
      ---------
      If  you  either  run out of Credits or answer ALL 50 questions, you
      will be presented with the Game Over screen.

      If  you  have  reached  a new HiScore you will be prompted to enter
      your name via the Joystick !

      Just  move  the  Joystick Left/Right/Up/Down to position the square
      over the letter of your choice and press Fire to select it.

      Up to 15 characters can be selected for your name and if you make a
      mistake you simply select the DEL character with the Fire button.

      When  you  have  finished entering your name, simply select the END
      character by pressing the Fire button.


      Now  sit  back and watch the Top Ten HiScores wrap around in a neat
      scrolly kind of fashion !!!


      That's it then !    If you want another game, simply press Fire and
      the game will begin again.

      If  not, either Reset your Amiga or press Ctrl & C to return to the
      CLI or WBench.



      (QUESTIONS)
      The  questions  are  displayed  randomly  each time you begin a new
      game.     So  chances  are  that  you  will  get  to play them in a
      different  order  with  each  new  game.     Can  you answer all 50
      supplied in this PD Release ?



      (THE END)
      That's basically it !

      Click on START when its flashing to play the next question.
      Click on A,B or C to answer it.
      Watch out for the Timer.
      Watch out for your Credits.
      Try and reach a new HiScore.

      Good luck !  (but) Most of all .... have loads of fun !
      (Oh  and don't forget to get a grown up to help you with the tricky
      bits !)


      NB  *  Please  note  that  the  full  game  has many enhancemets in
             graphics/sound/code etc.   A more polished affair at a great
             price to boot - rated at 95% in AUI June 1995 and as seen on
             the coverdisk of the August edition.

      10. Double Data Disk Packs Now Available:
      ~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      If you get bored playing the 500 Pop Music Questions that come with
      the  full game, then you may like to learn that I have now released
      another four Data Disks covering other subjects:

      I have released them as double packs to save you money. (normally a
      Data Disk would cost you £3.99)


      Quiz II Data Disk Pack 1: Pot Luck Volume 1 / Movies
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      £4.99 for two disks saving you £3.00 (Order No. F1075)


      Quiz II Data Disk Pack 2: Pot Luck Volume 2 / Sport
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      As usual, each disk comes with 500 (random) questions, 1500 answers
      and two new music modules and its very own intro picture.

      Look  out  for  more  Data  Disks from myself later in 1995 from F1
      Licenceware and maybe you should consider releasing your own. After
      all, no coding knowledge is required and you get the chance to earn
      yourself some money. But most of all, you will ensure that users of
      this game can benefit from playing your questions.   Let's keep the
      Amiga Alive And Kicking ................... ;-)   See Ya Soon   (-;
