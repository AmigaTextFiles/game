has many new features, to allow loading of any route with
more details.


  New Features:

  * Up to 100% faster frame rate
  * Trains visible on other track
  * Full steam loco controls
  * Electric token block signalling (RETB)
  * Up to 4 locos on a train!

  New data files for:

  * Horizon buildings
  * Overhead wires/telegraph poles
  * Buildings now any position
  * Square and multiple tunnels supported
  * Girder bridges

  * Many other improvements and features

  @{" Full changes since TD2 " LINK "Changes"}

    Requirements:

    @{b}Any Amiga with at least 2 mb (including 1 mb chip mem) and WB2.04+@{ub}

    Recommended:

    Hard Drive
    A1200 or better




There are three ways of using Train Driver 3

 * Generate a random route by adjusting the sliders on the @{" Loading Screen " LINK "Load_Screen"}
   The random routes generated by TD3 will be different from those generated by TD2 with the same code

 * Load data from a real railway route

 * Create a real or fictional route using @{" Data files " LINK "Data"} or
    @{" Train Driver Route Editor " LINK "TDRE"}



On Line Help is always available by pressing the Help key.
You need Amigaguide in your Workbench C: drawer for this to work

        Braking firm at any pressure

Wet:    Fair rail conditions
        Wheelslip likely in yellow or red zones
        Braking may cause wheel slide below about 50 psi

Fog:    Visibility about 100 yards
        Poor rail adhesion
        Wheelslip at top of green zone
        Brakes may cause wheel slide below 55 psi

Icy:    Very poor rail adhesion
        Wheelslip in upper half of green zone
        Brakes may cause wheel slide below 60 psi

Leaf:   Leaf-fall season. Very treacherous!
        Wheelslip possible whenever taking power
        Braking may cause wheelslide at any time

The rail adhesion is also affected by the difficulty level chosen.
The chosen setting may also change during your journey depending
on the difficulty level chosen.

The windscreen will now show the effects of these weather conditions and you will
need to switch on the wipers using "w". Watch out for the "W" indicator

and between them are the driver's indicator @{" Lights " LINK "Lights"}
and the milepost symbol.

You may also notice a small horizontal red line which indicates when
the horizon is level. Watching the horizon (not the red line!) gives warning of changing gradients.

For a view of these features see the @{"Help pic" SYSTEM "SYS:Utilities/multiview TD3A:Help SCREEN"}

If you start at a stand the @{" AWS " LINK "AWS"} @{" horn " LINK TD3a:fx/aws.snd/main}

you may depart.(If you get bored of waiting, press "6" to speed up time.)
The bottom row of @{" keys " LINK "keys"} control the brakes and power.
So press "z" to release the brakes and then "." or ">" to notch up the power.
Watch the gradient and speed to make sure you don't roll back.

@{b}Steam locos@{ub} require much more work!


@{B}Starting@{UB}


To start off, first ensure that the cylinder cocks are open (e) and C is displayed.
Then press F to select the direction you will be turning the cut-off reversing wheel
Cut-off (k) will need to be maximum to start and then reduced (shift K) as speed increases.
Open the regulator (>) to supply steam to the cylinders and the cut-off to increase the
amount of time the steam is kept in the cylinder, and hence the force applied and steam used.
Release the vacuum brakes (z), and you will start to move. You may then switch off the blower (y)
Give a toot on the whistle (h) and apply sand (u) if required.


@{B}Cylinder Cock@{UB}


Key e

C displayed when open


The cylinder cock must be open when the loco is first started (when F is pressed)
to allow steam which condenses into water to escape when the cylinder is cold
The cylinder cock should then remain shut.


@{b}Steam pressure@{ub}


First ensure you have more than 200 on the steam pressure gauge or you will have insufficient
pressure to releasec the brakes. To raise pressure you will need to get a hot fire and sufficient water in
the boiler using the injectors. Also the more steam you use the pressure will fall.
The cut-off valves, blower, whistle and regulator all use valuable steam reducing the
pressure so use them all sparingly.


Pressure:

Below 200  No Power and brakes will be applied as vacuum is lost
200 - 250  Reduced Power
250 - 300  Full working pressure
Above 300  Safety valves will operate wasting steam


@{b}Water@{ub}


Introduce water into the boiler from the water tank using injectors

i        increase injector pressure
shift I  reduce injector pressure.

For greatest efficiency keep the water level near the centre mark.
Too much water may force water into the cylinders, too little may melt
the fusible lead plugs in the base of the boiler extinguishing the fire,
or even cause a boiler explosion!
Remember gradients will also effect the water level gauge.


@{b}Fire@{ub}


Open the fire doors (left arrow key) and fill the fire with coal (up arrow key)
until the fire grows dimmer.
If the fire turns black you have smothered it and you will have to wait for the temperature to
rise again (see thermometer gauge). For optimum efficiency keep the fire near the centre marking
and glowing red.

@{b}Air@{ub}


Air is fed to the firebox through dampers and through the doors.

d        increase damping
shift D  reduce damping

More damping is required to get cold or over-filled fires going
Normally use level 4/5 for dampers and have the fire door almost closed for optimum performance
once the fire is going.


@{b}Cut-Off Valves@{ub}


These keep the steam in the cylinders for a variable time.
Full cut-off is required when starting, and it should then be reduced
as speed increases to save steam.

k        increase cut-off
shift K  reduce  cut-off

Optimum speeds for cut-off levels

0 - 12  Full (5)  75%
12- 28  4         60%
28- 44  3         45%
44- 56  2         30%
56- 72  1         15%
72+     0        <15%

Cut-off should also be at 0 when selecting direction with keys O,F and R



@{b}Blower@{ub}


Key y

B displayed when on


The blower is used to force steam through the chimney when the regulator is
off, or when the train is in a tunnel. Failure to have the blower on could result
in blow-back which could blow the contents of the fire-box into the cab!
However the blower should be switched off when not required to save steam.


@{b}Regulator@{ub}


This controls the amount of steam delivered to the cylinders and works
similarly to the normal power controller and uses the same keys.
Remember you will have no power unless you have sufficient steam pressure.

@TOC "MAIN"


@{"Signals picture " SYSTEM "SYS:Utilities/multiview TD3A:Signals.iff SCREEN"}


There are many types of signal as shown on the picture linked above.
The normal sequences are also indicated.

@{B}Colour lights@{UB} may have two, three or four aspects.
Colour lights normal sequence is double yellow (where available), single yellow and then the red signal.

@{B}Semaphore signals@{UB} are spaced according to signalbox locations.
On the approach to the signalbox is the home stop signal which is red and horizontal (or red light at night)
or raised at 45 degrees (green) if the line is clear.
The next signal is also a usually a stop signal protecting the section to the next signal box ahead.
Generally about half a mile or more from each box you will see the distant signal
This is yellow and indicates the position of the following stop signals. If it is raised (green)
all the stop signals for the following box are clear. If horizontal (yellow) then be prepared to stop at
the next stop signal.
There are variations such as section and distant signals for the next box on the same post
and fixed distant signals which are always horizontal usually approaching a line speed reduction or other hazards,
or the end of the line.

The distance from the next signal is shown on the display in yards.

If any signal shows red, you must stop within 35 yards of it to get the
message from the signalman.

He may ask you to pass the signal at danger.
If so you should give a long blast on the horn and proceed cautiously
until passing the next signal. Remember the next signal may be red.

Your speed passing a signal with two yellows (where available) should generally be below 90mph
and at one yellow try to reduce your speed to 60mph.
If you can see a red signal and you're over 60mph you will struggle to stop.
However, beware of signals closer together than usual, and reduce your speed
accordingly.

A hint to assist stopping is to keep your speed well below
one tenth of the number of yards from the stopping point.

Flashing yellows countdown to a high speed junction, generally 30 to 70mph.

A junction signal either has a letter above, eg S for Slow Line or
F for Fast Line, or has five white lights diagonally displayed,
indicating the direction of the crossover.

Other signals may have a number displayed indicating the platform that
you will enter, or the line you are crossing to.

Junctions without flashing yellow signals are protected by red signals which
will change as the train passes over the @{" AWS " LINK "AWS"} magnet if the
route is set and the line is clear.

These junction speeds vary between 10 and 40 mph.

A warning board will be shown approaching the junction signal
indicating the junction speed, and the speed limit board will
also be seen indicating the position of the junction.

If you are detained at a red signal for a couple of minutes the guard will
announce the reason for the delay to the passengers and it will be displayed on the
Message Display and in the log.



@{b}RETB Remote Electric Token Block@{ub}


This system is used on long rural routes mainly in Scotland and Wales, and
enables one signalman to control many miles of track from a remote location.

Generally the sequence of signals is as follows

Fixed Distant

A horizontal fixed yellow semaphore arm, usually on a reflectorised board.
This warns the driver that one of the other signals below is approaching
and that he may need to stop shortly

Points Set indicator

This signals shows a yellow light when the points are safely set for the train to proceed
Note that this signal will be unlit and difficult to see at night if the points are not set,
and the train must be stopped if this is the case.

Stop for Token board

This is a reflectorised large white board with a red circle displayed
The train must always be brought to a stand at this board and the driver must wait
for the Token Issued message from the signalman before proceeding

@ENDNODE
@NODE "Stations" "Stations"
@TOC "MAIN"


The distance from the next station you are stopping at is shown on
the display in miles, and then in yards when you approach.

Again you must stop within 35 yards of the Stop board displaying the
number of coaches to enable you to get the "R" indication when your
guard is ready to leave. If you pass this board, select "O" to shut
the motors down, then "R" to select Reverse and notch up power with
"." in the usual way until you are back behind the board. Be careful
not to overshoot again backwards !

Arrival times at intermediate stations are 1 minute before the shown
departure time.

The time you arrive and depart stations, and certain other points
will be recorded on the log, plus the average speed since the previous
point.

The "R" indicator will not appear before the booked time to depart,
or at a red signal.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "Braking" "Braking"
@TOC "MAIN"


Braking will vary depending on the loco details, the number of coaches,
and weather conditions.

Keys:
    z       Release
    x       Reduce
    c       Increase
    v       Increase (continuous)
    b       Emergency


Brake gauge
  

  72   Brake released        (Steam locos 21" vacuum)

  65   Initial application   (15")

  50   Full service          (10")

   0   Emergency



To apply brakes hold c until the guage reads 50 psi (pounds per square inch)
and release with z when approaching the desired speed level.

Alternatively use v to brake, "catching" the brake with x as the needle comes
down to 50 psi.

Normal Full Service application is 50 psi (vertical needle on dial).
Normally the driver would not use a greater braking force than this,
particularly in the wet.

Allow time for the brakes to release down the length of the train
particularly after heavy braking, before taking power.

When braking try not to brake too hard as you come to a stand
or you will spill the tea(!), and you will have to wait for the
air brake pipe to charge up again.

Having said that, don't pass a red signal ever, and don't speed excessively
or the guard will put the brake on or you may even derail the train.

In the wet don't be too heavy on the brakes or the wheels may lock up
and slide greatly increasing braking distance.

Your speed passing a signal with two yellows should generally be below 90 mph
and at one yellow try to reduce your speed to 60 mph.
If you can see a red signal and you're over 60 mph you will struggle to stop.
However, beware of signals closer together than usual, and reduce your speed
accordingly.

If necessary kill the power with "n". This is bad but better than
passing red signals !

A hint to assist stopping is to keep your speed well below
one tenth of the number of yards from the stopping point,
until the speed is down to 10 mph, then release brakes
completely until about 50 yards, then rub brakes lightly
for smooth stop (no audible screech).

Suggested maximum speeds at 50 psi.
(dependant on rail condition, difficulty level, gradient, weather, loco etc)


880 yards 60 mph
200 yards 30 mph
100 yards 20 mph
50  yards 10 mph

When taking power watch that you don't let the Ammeter go near
the red area or you may overload the motors and lose power.(Not steam loco)

On diesels a blue fault light may appear

Reset with "i", you may need more than one attempt.

Note if you overload excessively the loco may fail and your drive is over!

In poor weather you should also stay below the yellow
region to avoid wheelslip.

When reducing power you should use "m" and wait for the notch indicator
to run down, rather than use "n", as sudden shutting off of power
could cause arcing on electric locos and damage to the motors.

The speed limit is indicated by a white circular sign, with a red border.

Reductions in speed limit are indicated by a white triangle
with a yellow border, with the new limit in black.
Generally about 1.5 miles warning is given, unless two or
more reductions follow closely.
In cases of severe speed reduction, an @{" AWS " LINK "AWS"} horn may sound.

When passing from a lower speed to a higher speed section remember
not to accelerate until the whole train has passed the higher speed
limit board. A guide to this is the fact that the gantries are about
eight coaches apart.

At any point along the route there could be one or more speed traps set up by traction
inspectors. You will be advised as soon as your speed has been recorded.
If you are speeding there is a possibility you will be releived of your
driving duties immediately.

Neutral sections allow electric trains to pass from one electricity supply station

If you see the Neutral Section Warning Board you must run down the
power to zero before the Neutral Section Board, or there may
be a loss of power (reset with "i").

The warning board is one mile before the neutral section.

As a guide it takes 36 seconds to run down power from full power
which is a mile at 100 mph.

If you shut off power in time, power will be returned at the end of the
short dead section, otherwise you will have to try and reset the motors using
key i after exitting the neutral section.

Note if you overload excessively the loco may fail and your drive is over!

Do NOT use the brakes in a neutral section as it is a rheostatic brake
fed from the motors, so you may lose braking temporarily.

Warning board is white on black, board at neutral section is black on white.

The letters O F or R appear below the brake guage to indicate

In reality there is a three position switch:

F O R
\ | /

so you must stop, go to O (off) then into Reverse.

With steam locos the cut-off is the also the reversing wheel
and needs to be at 0 before O, F or R are selected.

Putting the switch into Off while moving will cause a brake
application. Pressing f or r whilst the motors are running and audible
will have no effect.

Also power notches must be run down to zero before changing direction.

Example:

When starting, hold F until you hear the motors start up, and F appears
then hold O until you hear them shut down, see O, then press R until you hear
the motors restart and R appears. You are now in reverse.

Train Start Time


Select Hours and Minutes of start time

Default is 06:20

This selects the start time to be used for calculating timings for the
chosen route and loco.

The timings will be calculated allowing for line speeds, station stops
loco hp and loco max speed, and gradients.
These timings may seem easy to maintain. If so increase the difficulty level
or train length and try again.
Don't worry if you are running a couple of minutes late as recovery time
is allowed for at the end of the journey.

Diesel and Electric Locos


There are a number of differences between diesel and electric locos

Diesel locos run up power quicker and no harm is done by shutting
off power to 0 (key n). They also do not need to shut off power
through neutral sections. They weigh more adding more brake force
and giving better traction in slippery conditions.

Drivers would not normally switch a loco to Off at intermediate stations and
signals.

Instead of a Line light a Power light is available which glows red
in case of overload shut-down indicating the loco has shut down.
Instead of a Breaker light a Fault light is available which glows
blue if a fault develops on the loco.

Both these lights can usually be reset by key I.
If not your loco has failed and your drive is over!

WARNING - Creation of Data-files is a long process and is only
recommended for enthusiasts!

See @{" Train Driver Route Editor " LINK "TDRE"} for an easier way!

You will need to be competent with a Text Editor and able to copy files etc.

If you want to create your own fictional line or try to simulate a real
line familiar to you, you will need to create the necessary data files
in any text editor (eg ED in Workbench:c/)

First you must create a drawer in the TD3A:routes/ drawer
(Makedir TD3A:Routes/MyLine)
Choose a name for your route, without spaces in the name, LESS THAN 12 CHARACTERS.


Then in this drawer you may create the following files.
The only files must be present are Data and Stations.

If the program can't find any of the other files it will attempt to generate data
based on the position of the sliders.

New data files are now available for TD3. See links at bottom of list.
Developers of routes should note that both the old data file and the new
.3 data file should be created to allow compatibility with TD2 and enhancement
for TD3, where applicable.

The following files are linked and both or neither should be present

signals1 and speeds1 (and signals2 and speeds2 if double track)
gradients and scenery


Note: Comments are now permitted in your files, after numerical entries up to 50 characters
      No blank lines
      Last line must be End
      First value must be on top line

1000    After signal line crosses to line 1
2000    After signal line crosses to line 2
9000    Current line ends - all trains must cross to other line at previous signal

@{"Signals picture " SYSTEM "SYS:Utilities/multiview TD3A:Signals.iff SCREEN"}

Signals with codes other than zero,1 or 9 should be at least three signals apart
as the signal sequence usually takes three signals.
Also when testing start at least 4 signals before signals to test
their effect.

To create first make up your signals1 file for the main line
and then make a copy as signals2 and edit the codes for the second line.
Do not edit the mileages, particularly of junction signals.
The number of signals on both lines should be equal.
Use code 9000 to show that signals on line 2 do not apply until the next crossover from line 1.

Also note that after a signal code 1 (or 101 etc) there should be an entry to
show which digit is to be displayed in the theatre box indicator
sbove the signal. This is in fact the name of the file in the Matrix drawer, so
you may create your own digits.

The format is a 5x5 grid:

22122
21122
22122
22122
22122    = 1

where 1 is a white light and 2 is a grey light, ie off.
Any colour 0-9 may be substituted.

After a signal code 2 (or 202,1202 etc) there should be an entry for each line,
the first entry for line 1, the second for line 2. See the above example.

@NODE "tim" "Timings"
@TOC "MAIN"

This option allows you to load in timings if the computer generated timings are
not to your liking or if you want to load in a real train's timetable.

Format:

0002  time due to start
0145  time due next stop
0308  time due next stop
0456  time due next stop
0722  time due next stop
1123  time due next stop
1301  time due last stop

There is no need for a counter or "End" line in this file.

If Routes/xx/timings is present these timings will be used.
If not you may either let the program calculate the timings
or Load Timings from the second GUI.

The program expects in this case the pattern #?.timings in the
Routes/xx/ drawer. So you could have slow.timings and express.timings
for a slow or express train
