Dynamic Youth Software present for your execution:
NUMBER CRUNCHER

Release version : 1.0 (compiled 30th August 1999, 3:05am)
Coded with : Blitz Basic II and the EFMUILib extension
Requirements : An MUI-capable Amiga

Playing the game:
----------------- 
Number Cruncher is an educational game designed to teach addition skills,
starting basic and getting huge. You are presented with a grid of 25 squares
and a target score. Each of the 25 squares contained a randomly selected
number. Your task is to select the number which you must add to your score
to attain the target.

For example, if your target is 10, and your score is currently 7, you would
need to add 3 to it to reach the target. So you select 3. Upon completion
of a grid (all 25 squares being cleared) you will move up to the next level
and therefore higher numbers.

Try to get as high a score as you can. Unfortunately the highscore function
isn't working yet, neither are the preferences, but they will appear in 
future versions (if you want them to that is, I'd like comments on this
version).

Who to blame?
-------------
Send gifts (preferably Yamaha DJX keyboards) to Michael Price, who had the
whole idea in the first place, and went on to create this.

The program IS freeware, but hey, who would refuse gifts? ;)

If you don't have 'Net access, pop down to a cybercafe, or at least send
me that Yamaha keyboard.
