1/4/04 - Version 0.1.1
	Worked on CPU usage.  When the game is sitting at a screen or is paused,
	CPU usage is greatly reduced.  Also created a very simple man page.  There
	were some complaints that Fred moved to fast, so he now moves slightly
	slower.  This makes the game much easier and slightly more playable.
11/30/02 - Version 0.1.0
	I used SDL_ttf to allow Fred to work with fonts.  The startup screen and
	endgame screen have been reworked.  I also added a help screen and a
	credits screen.  The scoring system now works like a normal arcade scoring
	system and shows up on screen during gameplay.  I also switched from using
	regular Makefiles to using autoconf and automake for installations.
11/24/02 - Version 0.0.5
	I've gone through the code and tried to wrap error checking around many
	SDL_ calls.  I've also added some status statements that just print stuff
	to let me know where we are in the code.  This was added since some people
	have experienced problems and it is mostly impossible to troubleshoot them
	without this.  The only other thing added to this version is a very
	simplistic scoring scheme.
11/18/02 - Version 0.0.4
	Multiple Freds now implemented.  Game is now impossible to win.  If you
	successfully save all the Freds, your reward is to play again with one more
	Fred added.
11/17/02 - Version 0.0.3
	Started cleaning up some of the code, the window class now handles all
	drawing.  Made changes to movement code.  Fred's forward speed slows after
	exiting airplane and his vertical speed increases until he hits terminal
	velocity.  He also slows down after opening his parachute.  Created an
	images class that can load all sprites for game.  Adopted GNU General
	Public License.
11/15/2002 - Version 0.0.2
	Fred now jumps from the airplane at random times.  I was tired of the dark
	blue color of the sky, so I made the sky a lighter shade of blue.  Created
	a startup screen with the option to play.  You can begin the game by
	pressing 'p' or by clicking the play button.  Also created an end game
	screen that allows restarting instead of having to rerun the game every
	time.
11/11/2002 - Version 0.0.1
	Very rough version of game.  Plane shows up, Fred jumps, you click on Fred
	and chute opens.  So basics are here, but not much else.  The only extra is
	the game can be paused and unpaused.
