Linux Shuttle Lander v1.0 
Copyright (C) 2003 Thomas Raes (thomas.raes@pandora.be)

GENERAL
-------

You fly a space shuttle during it's last fase of approach and landing.
The difficulty is that you don't have any fuel left in your tanks, so you have to fly the shuttle as a glider.
This means that you only have one landing attempt, if you fail, you'll be barbecued.
If you are too low and don't have enough velocity, you'll never reach the runway.
On the other hand, you have to hit the runway before the critical point (marked with a red light at each side of the runway), 
otherwise you'll overshoot.

You can control the descent of the shuttle by changing it's angle of inclination.
This modifies the aerodynamical situation and allows you to break down or control the descent.
Make sure that you're inclination is between 0 and 10 degrees when you hit the runway!
The landing gear is already lowered and your copilot (i.e. the computer) takes care of the breaking-parachute and landing flaps.

The shuttle is controlled using the arrow keys on your keyboard:
	ARROW LEFT: nose up 10 degrees
	ARROW RIGHT: nose down 10 degrees

Your altitude (ALT), angle of inclination (INC) and horizontal distance from the beginning of the runway (RW DIST) are displayed at the upper right corner of the screen.
A positive angle of inclination means that your nose is pointed upwards, a negative angle of inclination means that you're diving.

After each landing you'll get a rating based on your velocity, angle of inclination, touch-down point, etc...

You can exit the game by pressing "q".

Good luck!
