	Last minute (or should I say 4 days ago =) bug report!

	- 192x160 version could crash or WILL crash sometimes because of
	some now known bugs :( . U will have to run it once again and it
	will work (for some time).

	- Wont work with kickstart 3.1 due to some bugs also :(

	- Dont run with DoublePal or DoubleNTSC screenmodes with mode
	promotion on, because this will slow down the screen update twice!!
