We have seen many "DOOM" engines in Amiga, but almost all of them are
crap. This one uses 256x200 and 192x160 size windows with 256 colors and needs
68020+ and AGA. This engine is not ready yet, but we have to finish our
demo and wanted to release this now before anyone else does so.


Some features of our engine:
----------------------------
- Speedy
- Working doors
- Objects
- Lightsourcing by distance
- Transparent walls
- Animated walls and objects
- Floor and ceiling


Some disadvantages:
-------------------
- Orthogonal walls (90 degrees)
- No moveable objects		*
- No sizeable window		*
- Walls are of same height	*


Known bugs:
-----------
- Raycasting has bugs		*
- Collision controlling 	*
- Walls have inaccuracies	*


* Under work, but no time to fix it (yet)


Because I (Janne) go to army 22.08.94, our development may slow down
a bit. We are also going to support graphic cards but we need
some info about them so if you want to see this engine in your graphic
card, send it or info to us. Our goal is to make a real game that works
with AGA or any graphics card.


Some info about this engine...
------------------------------

This preview uses at this moment plain raycasting system used in Wolfenstein
(ID Software) so it is quite simple and we are going to do a more complex
version but it takes time and has low priority at this moment. We use two
chunky to planar converters (One optimized for 020 and one for 040) which
are PD but not our work.
