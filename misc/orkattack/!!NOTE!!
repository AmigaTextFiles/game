This file originally came on a disk that had WB libs on it. I thought it would
not run from the Hard Drive without having ASSIGNS to the dir etc, but the game
worked fine.

SO...

Here is the game!!! ( RECOMMENDED: for users with Hard Drives only !!!! )

BUT....

if you don't have a HD and can be bothered then this is what the original disk
looked like:  ( name it - OrkAttack )

     l (dir)
       Disk-Validator                   Port-Handler
       Ram-Handler                      
     libs (dir)
       diskfont.library                 icon.library
       mathieeedoubbas.library          mathieeedoubtrans.library
       mathtrans.library                translator.library
     s (dir)
       Startup-Sequence=:

Run >Nil: OrkAttack
EndCli >Nil:
                 
     c (dir)
       Assign                           endcli
       Run                              SetMap
     devs (dir)
          keymaps (dir)
            gb                               
          printers (dir)
            EpsonQ                           
       narrator.device                  parallel.device
       printer.device                   ramdrive.device
       serial.device                    system-configuration
     fonts (dir)
          garnet (dir)
            9                                
       garnet.font
                      
  OrkAttack
