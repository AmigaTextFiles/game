                           FROM AMIGADOS
                           -------------

The default word file is called "WORDS".
The default save game file is called "Save-Maze".

These are the all the legal commands :

CROSSMAZE

CROSSMAZE MAZE Save-Maze

CROSSMAZE Words

CROSSMAZE Words MAZE Save-Maze
CROSSMAZE Words      Save-Maze

                       FROM AMIGA WORKBENCH
                       --------------------

The CrossMaze icon specifies which file of words will be loaded using the
tool type "WORDS=..." where ... is the name of the file of words.
(Tool Types are entered from WorkBench through the Info command.)

The CrossMaze icon is initially set to specify the default words file. So
to run CrossMaze from the WorkBench simply double click on the CrossMaze
icon.

You may load a saved game by using extended selection without having to
change the tool types in the CrossMaze icon.  Simply press the shift key and
click on the files you want to load into CrossMaze.  Then double click on
CrossMaze while still holding down the shift key.

NOTE : CrossMaze will recognize a game file only if it is with its icon
which specifies the tool type "FILETYPE=MAZE".

NOTE : CrossMaze will recognize the word file only if it is with its icon
which specifies the tool type "FILETYPE=WORDFILE".


                           FROM WINDOWS
                           ------------

Unlike the Amiga version, the Windows version does not have any parameters.
The word file must always be called WORDS and a saved maze can be loaded
from the menu.

                        DESCRIPTION
                        -----------

This program creates a maze of 10, 20, or 30 words between 8 and 10 letters
in length.  These words are presented to you in a list along with the maze.
Your goal is to put all the words in the maze so that they all fit.  The
words do not HAVE to be placed back in the same way that CrossMaze built the
maze (there may be more than one solution).

This program makes heavy use of INTUITION.  The possible menu options are :

  FILE      START NEW GAME  HELP              SETTINGS         TIMERS
  ----      --------------  ----              --------         ------
  QUIT      BEGIN NEW GAME  FORFEIT TURN      10 WORDS         NO TIMER
  ABOUT ... LOAD GAME       BACKUP A MOVE     20 WORDS         UP TIMER
            SAVE GAME       START ME OFF      30 WORDS         30 SECONDS
            PRINT GAME      START OVER        SINGLE PLAYER    1 MINUTE
                            SHOW SOLVED MAZE  TWO PLAYERS      2 MINUTES
                            INSTRUCTIONS      EXTRA WORD       3 MINUTES
                                                               5 MINUTES

To start a new game simply select the menu option.  First you might want
to set some options though.  Under the SETTINGS menu you can set the
size of the game and the number of players.  The menu item EXTRA WORD
will cause an extra word to be fixed during the two player game.

On the Amiga version, after selecting BEGIN NEW GAME, two gadgets will
appear : ABORT and RESTART.  If the generation of the game bogs down push
restart and if you change your mind about a playing a game you can always
push abort.  I have never seen it fail to make a maze within a few
seconds on an Amiga 3000.

On the Windows version, after selecting BEGIN NEW GAME, the program simply
builds the game without presenting any option to abort.  Wait for the
maze to appear.

During the game, your available moves are performed using the mouse and
the menu commands in the HELP menu column.  Because these commands work
differently or are unavailable between single and two player mode,
they will be explained separately.

SINGLE PLAYER
-------------

Once the maze appears, four menu items are of interest.  START ME OFF
will fill in the first word in the maze should you need help.  START OVER
will clear your maze should you decide you've screwed up.  SHOW SOLVED
MAZE will quell your curiosity if you decide to give up. BACKUP A MOVE
will remove words in reverse order which you have inserted in the maze.
(FORFEIT TURN is disabled in SINGLE PLAYER MODE)

To place a word in the maze, first point at a word in one of the two word
lists located on either side of the maze.  Single click the left mouse
button to select the word.  You will notice in the box in the upper left
corner that the length of the word is listed under SELECTED WORD.  Next
point at a slot in the maze and single click to select the slot.  It will
become highlighted.  SELECTED SLOT will indicate the length of the slot
in the upper left corner of the screen.  Now you can double click on either
the selected slot or the selected word.  The word from the word list will
appear in the maze if it will fit.

Actually an extra step was added above to explain the game clearly.  Once
you have selected the word with a single click, you may double click on
a slot in the maze.  Thus you will be selecting and inserting the word
in the same step.  Furthermore, you can single click on the slot first
and then double click on a word from the word list.

So the simple rule here is to make sure you have selected both a slot and
a word before double clicking.

To remove a word from the maze just double click on the slot.  The game
determines that there is a word already in the slot and reasons that you
want to remove it rather than insert another on top of it!  The word
does not have to be selected in the word list first.

In Single Player Mode, only two timer options are available : NO TIMER,
and UP TIMER.  NO TIMER will cause play without a timer.  UP TIMER will
cause a timer to be displayed that will present the elapsed time during
this game.

TWO PLAYER
----------

In two player mode only FORFEIT TURN and SHOW SOLVED MAZE are available.
BACKUP A MOVE, START ME OFF, AND START OVER are disabled.

Words are inserted and removed from the maze as described above.  However,
these actions are more complex because of the effects they have on your
score!

When the game starts, each player has an assigned color: BLUE or RED.
Each player is assigned 5 words which are marked in his color in the
word list.  The remaining words in the word list are PURPLE indicating
that they are not available to either player yet.

Each player may only insert his own words in the maze.  When a player
inserts a word, he is assigned another word from the remaining PURPLE
words.  When there are no more PURPLE words, then the player receives
no new word.

When a player inserts one of his words in the maze, it is drawn in the
maze using his color.  If his word crosses one of his opponent's words
then that word is changed to his color.  A player will receive one point
for each letter.  He will also receive one point for each letter in
words captured from his opponent.

A player may remove one of his own words.  If there are no more PURPLE
words and the player has fewer than five words then the word is added
back to the word list using his color.  However, if the player already
has five words but his opponent does not then his opponent will receive
the word.  If both players already have five words then the word is
added back as PURPLE.  This action will cost 20 points.

A player may choose to remove a word owned by his opponent.  If that word
is in the correct position in the solution it remains in the maze as his
opponent's word and the opponent will receive 10 points.  If the word is
not in the correct position in the solution it is removed from the maze
and added to the word list and the challenger will receive 10 points.  If
there are no more PURPLE words and the challenger has fewer than five
words then the word is added back to the word list using his color.
However, if the challenger already has five words but his opponent does
not then his opponent will receive the word.  If both players already
have five words then the word is added back as PURPLE.

NOTE : In single player mode, there may be more than one solution... As
       long as you can fit all the words in, you win.  However, in the
       two player mode, the computer determines the winner of a
       challenge by the one solution that it built to start the game.

Each player is only allowed two forfeits during each game.  Once they are
used up, a player without an available place to put one of his words will
have to remove one of his own words or challenge one of his opponent's.

Once a player has placed all of his words in the maze, it will no longer
be his turn again.  His opponent will continue placing words in the maze
until he also runs out.  However, the last player may challenge one of
his opponent's words and if the last player already has five words then
the challenged word goes to his opponent.  In this way, his opponent is
back in the game.

In two player mode, CrossMaze uses specific colors to indicate the
availability of words and slots :

                  MAZE COLORS                    LIST COLORS
               CONDITION    COLOR             CONDITION      COLOR
             -------------  -----        ------------------  -----
             BACKGROUND     BLACK        BACKGROUND           BLACK
             NOT IN MAZE    GREEN        IN MAZE              GREEN
             PLAYER 1 IN    RED          PLAYER 1 AVAILABLE   RED
             PLAYER 2 IN    BLUE         PLAYER 2 AVAILABLE   BLUE
             SELECTED WORD  YELLOW       SELECTED WORD        YELLOW
             CROSSED IN     PURPLE

NOTE : definition of CROSSED IN - In maze, if a blue word and a red word
       cross each other then letter is marked as PURPLE indicating that
       both players may remove that letter.

In Two Player Mode, all timer options are available except UP TIMER.
NO TIMER will cause play without a timer.  The remaining menu options
indicate the amount of time allowed for each move in the game.  If the
time elapses then it becomes the other player's turn and he gains 10
points.

COMMON COMMANDS
---------------

You can save or load an old game.  You may also print the maze and
solution to the printer or to file.

NOTE : the PRINT GAME menu option under Windows does not work in quite the
       standard way.  A dialog box appears requesting a filename.  CrossMaze
       will generate a file that looks something like this (except bigger) :

      [FORMFEED]
      [COMPRESSED MODE]
      [1/8th LINE SPACING]
                           +-+
                           | |
                           +-+ +-+
                           | | | |
                         +-+-+-+-+
                         | | | | |
                         +-+-+-+-+
                               | |
                               +-+

      [NORMAL MODE]
      [1/6th LINE SPACING]
           ANT                         ODD
           STUD

      [FORMFEED]
                            A
                            N O
                           STUD
                              D

      [NORMAL MODE]
      [1/6th LINE SPACING]
           ANT                         ODD
           STUD

       Where [...] is a printer command.  They are hardcoded to the following
       Epson compatible commands :

       COMMAND               ASCII HEX CODE
       -------               --------------
       [FORMFEED]            FORMFEED
       [COMPRESSED MODE]     0FH
       [NORMAL MODE]         12H
       [1/8th LINE SPACING]  ESCAPE '0'
       [1/6th LINE SPACING]  ESCAPE '2'

       For this file to work your printer must be Epson compatible.  To
       print the maze after generating the file simply go to DOS and type
       COPY <filename> LPT1: where <filename> is the name of the file.

That's about it!!  The other commands are obvious.  And there is the menu
option "Instructions", of course.  Have fun.
