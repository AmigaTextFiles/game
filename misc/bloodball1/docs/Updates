Bloodball Updates                                 v1.0     September 1992

This is what the order of business is...

If you send me $10 to help me pay for my hard drive, memory, and other
expensive hardware that I've bought JUST to write this game, this is what
will happen:
 
 You will quickly be sent 4 races: Dwarves, Goblins, Halflings, and Satyrs
& at least six more teams. 
 Soon afterward, you'll be given a simple team creator, and any other races
I have added in the meantime. (working on Werewolves, Skeletons, Drows,
Humans, etc...)

 The next version will tie the the team creator and the program together,
where it will save teams after playing, and allow leagues and other fun
stuff. 

The actual game play will remain the same for a while. 

Any large changes will require rewriting much code, and that's just not 
what I'm all that excited about doing right away.

I WILL fix simple bugs and small problems. 
- So, please send me the details of any bugs you find, as I'm sure there
  are still some that got by my watchful eye.

You may also send me ideas on improvements. But I can think of many, so 
I'll bet they won't be too new to me. If they are simple, I can make the
adjustments. But as I've said in my other files, I'm very restricted at the
moment. Any large adjustments will be put on hold for a while. 
 Besides, I wanna do good in school this semester.  :)
