       ******* MANGLED FENDERS DEMO*******

You can wreck a golf course, drive on the moon, even park in a handicapped stall, but don't think you're going to get away with it.

   Mangled Fenders Demo is my latest game to be released this year.  My other games are Incinerator, Castle Incinerator and Checkers Conquest.  All of these games are 1994 releases.  I will go into a bit more detail about these other games further on in this document.  See the Shareware Alert section for restrictions on the distribution of this game.

   Mangled Fenders Demo is the top view, 6 player demo-derby game, where the objective is to destroy all of the other vehicles, by crashing into them.  There are cash awards to all the players, the amounts depending on the order in which they are destroyed.  There are different types of vehicles, so you can pick the one that suits you.

        ******* FREE STUFF ALERT *******

FREE?!?...  What could he possibly give away now???

   I have decided to give all registering users of Mangled Fenders and Incinerator, a free copy of Castle Incinerator.  Castle Incinerator will only be available from me directly, and there will be no demo version, as it is close to the original Incinerator anyway, even though the graphics are greatly improved.  Gee... This is nice, don't you think so???

*** SHAREWARE RESTRICTED DISTRIBUTION ALERT ***

This is the Mangled Fenders Demo.  It is shareware, but it CANNOT be distributed on CD.  The ONLY exception will be in the Aminet CD. This demo version MUST be referred to as the "Mangled Fenders Demo" in all advertisements of it.   I really like seeing my name appear in the Amiga magazines (hint, hint), and my reputation for great games might just sell people on getting this demo.  The main game file must retain the name "MangledFendersDemo".  The full version of Mangled Fenders is not to be distributed under any circumstances whatsoever.  All files must remain present, and unaltered in it's distribution.

  Remember, you get an extra bonus game, Castle Incinerator (which is ONLY available directly from myself, as I am the only one authorized to distribute it), with your registered version of Mangled Fenders.  Castle Incinerator is also given free to all registerers of the original Incinerator.

   Any Amiga magazine wanting to put this demo on any coverdisks MUST give me a copy of the magazine so I can show people :)

   ***** REGISTRATION INFO *****

   This demo version is shareware and cash from several different countries will be accepted in the following amounts:

   USA: $10     England: (UK) #7     Finland: FIM 50 
   Denmark? DM 15   
   (Singapore: 1 (live) Singapurra cat, just kidding)

All other registrations must be equal to USA $10.  Currency amounts equal to USA $10 that carry a denomination of more than 100 monitary units cannot be accepted, due to possible instability of the cash.  It must also be legal to posses such monitary units of the currencies outside of their native countries.  I do greatly prefer American cash, but sometimes people just don't have access to it.  I will NOT accept newspapers, toilet paper, origami, leaves, wooden disks, sea shells, snails, shrimp, any crustaceans or lifeforms (except possibly cats), mollusks, tubers, roots, vines, twigs, dirt, sand, rocks, boulders, cement, bricks, lumber, or other assorted supplies.  Well, I think you get the idea, anyway, send recognised World Currency.

This World Currency policy is to make it simple to register for my game.  I just hope I don't go broke with $1000's in foreign cash in my hands : ) :D.  I can at any time revoke this policy if I start to go bankrupt.

 The full game is NOT distributible.   I strive to support as many Amiga configurations as possible, as my games support both PAL and NTSC modes, as well as harddrives.  The multinational pricing is designed to encourage registration for the full game.  I am also extending multinational pricing for my other game, Incinerator for half the above rates (not from the list of things I don't accept though).  I do prefer American cash, as it is highly useful where I live :)  

       ******* STARTUP OF THE GAME *******

   To start the game, simply click on the game icon (I thought it would take about 100 pages to fill this section, but I made the game simple to start up).  Oh yeah, it is not compatible with Enforcer, whatever that is...  The programming language doesn't create code to work on A4000's, since it is rather old anyway.  If it crashes on any other configuration, then boot with a stripped start-up sequence.

       ******* FEATURES OF THE GAME *******

   The escape key is used to end the current play, and go back to the main menu.  For the one person on the internet who broke his escape key, the "tilda" key does the same thing, (you don't find this level of support from just anyone).  The space bar will pause and un-pause the game.  The cars take less damage when backing up, so it is a good idea to stay in reverse unless you need to get out of the way quickly.  The cheat mode can be entered in just about any section of the game.

   The main control panel is operated by the second joystick port, or the arrow keys, with the delete key as fire.

* 6 Different vehicles, all of which can be played simultaneously.
* 6 Background screens: 
   The Moon        Parking Lot     Dirt Track
   Golf Course    Soccer Field     Intersection

   The game will randomly cycle through the screens, selecting a different one each round.  There are more graphics in the PAL area, so it is a good idea to at least once, boot your machine in PAL mode, to look at the rest of each picture.  It also gives you a slightly larger play area, which might be useful.  The game fully functions in NTSC mode, as that is my native mode.

* 7 PowerUps:
   Indestructibility    Super PowerUp   Cash Award
   Full Repair        Half Repair      Super Performance
   Inflict Double Damage

   The power-ups will appear every once in a while, and when they do, any computer players will start directly for it.  There is a screen in the game that shows the icons for the power-ups, and also explains what they do.

* 6 Different Multilevel Upgrades:
   Temporary Repair:   Tools on the floor
   Top Speed:          Engine
   Acceleration:        Tires
   Damage Absorbtion:   Dump Truck
   Damage Infliction:    Tank
   Permanent Repair:    Lift

   These things are gained (or sold off) in the screen to spend your cash on various upgrades designed to keep your car alive, for at least a little while.

* Skid marks are left on the ground, when crashing.
* Cars have 3 stages of graphical portrayal of damage level.
   Missing hood, Smoke, and Fire (then the explosion)
* Cars skid and slide realistically, and explode when destroyed.
* Intelligent computer opponents that seek you out.
   (but the computer players still act stupid sometimes)
* Both joystick ports supported, with 2 keyboard players.
   Keyboard players are for just in case people don't have any  joysticks for the game.
* NTSC & PAL modes supported and uses 64 colors.
* Hard Drive installable.
* Professional style fades between screens.

   All the above points are to make the cars nice to look at, and actually act like cars, instead of homing missiles :)  Also, they are good points for gloating about (my game does this and that).

* Secret Cheat Mode (HE HE HE HE HA HA HA).

   The Cheat Mode is very well designed.  It gives the player you want any power you want them to have.  It also lets you destroy unwanted cars with a single keystroke :) :D  If you are successful in discovering the cheat mode, then the screen that tells about the different power-ups will also instruct you how to cheat.  The only problem is figuring out what it is.  Luckily, I have leaked this information to limited places, so it will eventually become known.

        ******* MY SOFTWARE COLLECTION *******

   What do you mean, this bloke wrote something else too?!?

   I have created other games, such as Incinerator. The demo of which is on Aminet in the game/shoot drawer as "Incinerator.lha", and Checkers Conquest, which is represented as "Checkers.lha" in the game/think drawer.  I have released these games early in 1994, so they are just as current as this game is.  I am always planning more games, so you never know when another one will appear.

   Incinerator is a 3D missile attack/defend game, where you defend your city from the enemy's missiles and helicopters, with your laser cannons, forcefields, and super bombs.  Every other round, you get to pulverize the enemy city, with missiles of your own.  It supports NTSC/PAL, is hard drive installable, has high scores, and a secret cheat mode.  It is shareware for $5, and I throw in Checkers Conquest, since it fits on the disk.  I also put a printed label on the disk, for a little touch of professionalism.  I am also throwing in Castle Incinerator for good measure.

   Castle Incinerator is a graphics rewrite of Incinerator, with castles instead of cities, and horses instead of missiles.  The graphics are the only real change, but WOW, they are so awesome.  Well, I have had the chance to improve it a bit more than that, as I have improved the sounds and gameplay too.  I have made what used to be the helicopter more powerful, as it can now drain the shields with a special beam.  Actually, the helicopter is now a giant bird, with flapping wings instead of rotor blades.  It was fun rewriting the docs for it.  It looked silly in text, having to defend a castle from flatulent horses, with laser wielding wizards.  It will be available from me only, when registering for my other stuff, as a bonus, so it is another incentive to register with me.  Castle Incinerator is not distributible, and is only available directly from me.

   Checkers Conquest is a checkers game with lots of features, and has intelligent computer opponents.  There are lots of options, including changing the board layout, and showing possible threatened positions.  There is no demo version of Checkers Conquest, as the  freely distributible version of it is available almost anywhere,  another testiment to my generosity.  It is "shareware" however, for a token amount of $3, as it took a lot of my resources to develop the game, and the graphics look really neat too.

   Gee, let's see, thats one... two... three... four games, all released in 1994, that was a lot of stuff, I should be exhausted by now. :) most shareware artists only write one or two games in many years, let alone several in many months.  I have single handedly done something that takes about 20 regular Amigans to do in twice the time (or something like that).  I have started on another project, but I can't leak any info on it until I am reasonably done with it (no sence spreading more vaporware, even though it is interesting).  Don't wait for my next release though, and jump on my new band-wagon early, well, only figuratively.

             ******* LEGAL STUFF *******

   Oh no!!!... it's the coppers... run away...

  This is the demo version of my game, see the Shareware Distribution section for distribution restrictions.  Copies of the full game can be obtained from myself, for $10 each (why you would want more than one, I don't know), see above for other world currency pricing.

The address is:

   Incinerplex Games
   Pete W Storonskij
   200 A street
   Lincoln, NE 68502
   USA

   Please specify which games you want, as I have written many games, all of them released in 1994.  I came from no where with a veritable fleet of great Amiga games.  If no one registers, that is exactly where I go back.

   Special thanks to Kenton P Zinn (I think, but his name has mysteriously changed to E. H. Walker, go configure), for reminding me of doing this fine game.  Michael Bromery for testing support, and players of F1GP for pointing out all those nasty PAL display bugs.  Also, thanks to Pasi Valkennen, for being the very first person to register Incinerator with me, or anything else for that matter.  Also, THANKS to Donald Feldbruegge, for registering Checkers Conquest with more than 3 times what I had asked.  Lastly, THANKS to everyone who supports the AMIGA, which is the most awesome computer in the universe, and it has lots of expansion slots :).

   My other registered users are: Jason Maskell, Robert Lindsay, Rayne Radulovich, luther Harris, and the president of NorthWest PD, John McNab (who saw fit to support me a bit, since he may be making a bit off spreading the demo of Incinerator).   Gee... only 7 people have registered with me, for a total of $40, obviously, I can't continue at this pace.  Any help is badly needed, it can add up to a whole lot.  I am fully dediated to supporting the Amiga, so support the Amiga by supporting me.  I support both the Amiga and all registerers of my games with the fullest extent of my generosity.

   Lastly, can I consider myself a published writer, as Amiga Format in issue 61, printed my silly convert-the-universe-into-an-Amiga letter in the letters pages??? :) :D  Also, we haven't had any outdoor movie theaters in America for about 10 years now, so they are probably all torn down by now, so I will have to think of another way to convert the universe into an Amiga.  I have also heard that I have a review of Incinerator in one of the many English magazines, I would appreciate any info on where I can find reviews of my games, so I can get them and show people my "vast" amounts of fame.  My ultimate goal is to get an interview of me in one of the millions of Amiga Magazines.
