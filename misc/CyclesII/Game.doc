I think the program in this archive is easy to grasp so I won't
bother writing a .doc file for it.

If anyone wishes to write a .doc file, they are permitted to.
(You never know, a journalist might even read it and bring you 
fame and fortune!!)

If you do write a file, I would be very grateful if you send me a copy 
so I know what is being associated with my programming attempts.

Bug reports, docfiles etc. can be e-mailed to me at:
