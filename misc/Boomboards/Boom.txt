 
  This is what happens when you get bored one day. :)

  Some new BOOM boards for your ponging pleasure.  I just had to leave a
couple of the old favorites in there, most have been tweaked a bit.  Three or
four of them are something new.  I call them "Rest" screens.  You get the
ball into the playing area, then remove your hand from the mouse and let it
rest. :)  If the ball comes back out, it'll be going about a million miles an
hour and you won't have a chance.

  They also raise an interesting point you may have thought about.  We'll
take screen #50 as an example.  Load up the screen, move the mouse all the
way to the right.  Hold down the Right Amiga key, hit the left arrow key
twenty times.  Don't even touch the mouse to fire the ball, just hit the
Left Amiga & Left Alternate keys.  The ball enters the playing field and the
scenario begins.  The ball goes this way and that.  Now try it again, twenty
times to the left.  Should follow the same pattern, shouldn't it?

  So how come you can do it ten times and never get a repeat?  Actually, I
did it about ten times and I think I did get one exact repeat, although it's
hard to tell.  But it's quite obvious that the same pattern isn't repeated
over and over and over again, even though you're firing it from exactly the
same place every time.  Why!?!  I presume this is nothing more than very
clever programming, tip o' the hat to Ed.

  Enjoy!
