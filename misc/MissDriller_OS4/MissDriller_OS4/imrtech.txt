Update version 2 of the Miss driller dc port.

Dpad controls are now implemented and also there is in game music implementedas of this version *analog controls* are "now only used for the menu and high scoretable". So now vmu saving is about all thats left to do controls are now very good using the dpad. Keyboard and analog still work as well same as before.

So use the dpad for ingame controls  use analog for the menus and highscore table.

Fscanf routine has to be rewritting for saving to work correctly. more complex in game music system will be next. 

Thats all for this version should be what you were looking for controls fully fixed for dpad please not dpad controls only work in game.
