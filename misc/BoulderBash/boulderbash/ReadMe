The working version has many additional levels and includes an 
interactive editor.  The editor provides a means for creating new levels.  
Furthermore, objects' attributes can be customized.  The editor can create 
objects that behave in a distinct manner from any of the objects included 
in these levels.

I am currently working on a commercial version of this program.  Your
donations will help me to be able to finish this product.  Also, I would 
greatly appreciate any comments, suggestions, bug reports, etc.  I have a
number of improvements that I'm working on for the commercial version, and
I would like to incorporate any ideas you might have.  If you have access
to the internet, please e-mail your responses and include "BoulderBash" 
somewhere on the subject line.

Thanks for your interest in this product!
