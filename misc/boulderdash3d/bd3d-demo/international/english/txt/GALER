Gems        - this is your goal !
The goal of the game is to
find as many gems as it is 
given next to the טי.
The number of already found
gems is in the left upper 
corner.
~
You have to find all the
gems before your time 
exceeds the limit given next
to the flag גד.
~

#
Prickles    - unpleasant when touched
Prickles are one of the 
things standing in your way.
~
Coming into contact with
them means a bounce in an
indefinite direction and 
1 gem loss. 
~
~
Prickles can be destroyed
with a falling stone or
a bomb.
~
~
#
Stone       - hard and heavy
Stones can be both - useful 
and dangerous in this game.
Dangerous are only those
falling stones. When you're
hit by such a stone you lose
a gem and are made off your
course. 
Some of the stones are 
hanged at the ceiling. These
are traps activated with
a press upon the field 
under a stone.
~
A stone laying on the floor
is available for pushing,
throwing down, elevating,
falling floors activating;
it may be also used as 
a cannon shield.

#
Hidden gem  - split it
It has all the stone 
features, but hides a gem
inside. To get the gem out
you have to hit it with 
a falling stone, plasma ball
or throw it down onto 
the floor.

seconds making the limit

#
Tornado      - a local whirl
When you're caught by 
a tornado you're spining
with no possibility to move.
There's no way to liquidate
it.
The only thing you can do is
to keep away from it.
~
~
#
Bomb        - your weapon
Collect bombs and use'em in
any moment.
The bomb explodes after 2 
seconds and destroyes 
neighborhood (prickles,
plasma cannons). The blast
can also move stones.
~
The bomb is a good weapon
'gainst other players.
A distant explosion deprives
of a gem and a close one
kills !
Be careful not to commit
a suicide - run away from
a bomb you drop !

#
Rockets      - flying kit
Powerful rocket engines lets
you fly.
Take care of the fuel limit.

A modern player doesn't use
his feet to move
You own a jet hovercraft !
It has self-recovering 
shields.
If the shields get destroyed
you can continue mission
on another vehicle (if you
still have one).
The gems you had stay at 
the crash site.
Sometimes you may find
additional life (represented
by your image).

Crab         - gem robber
A crab moves on flat 
surfaces and tries to rob
you of your gems.
If it finds you it takes
one gem and runs away.

jump onto the crab.
A squeezed crab is 
unconscious for a few 
seconds after which it gets 
back to work.

Honey         - attracts bees

take bees away from gems.

Bee         - malicious thief
A bee wants your gems just
like a crab.
But it's so shy that catches
a gem just when you lose it 
after a contact with 
prickles, a stone etc.
The bee flies up to the 
ceiling with the gem then.
~
You can get the gem back
hitting the bee or showing
honey to it.
