@{ui}
This is the demo version of a new 3D game. The rules of the game are like in
old good Boulder Dash 10 years ago: collect diamonds and find the exit. You
will have to face brand new obstacles in the 3D version and the game gives
new features: view from the player's position, flying, bombs. The program
contains review of the characters appearing in the game and  a recorded
example of a contest. You can try your skills just on one level in this
version. More levels and other attractions will be available in the full,

 @{fg highlight}1.Hardware requirements, how to start@{fg text}

   - processor >=68020, AGA chipset, about 1.5 MB RAM, KickStart 3.0,
  which in the human language means A1200 or 4000.
  Program uses powerpacker.library (c) copyright Nico Francois.

  You are able to change the screen size with @{b}F1, F2, F3@{ub} keys to adjust to
  your computer's speed.
  ATTENTION ! Menu is _always_ in the biggest size !

  Amiga 1200 without additional memory is unfortunately too slow, though
  those patient may try it with the small screen. 

  The program is available in 2 language versions: Polish and English.
@{fg highlight}  YOU HAVE TO SELECT ONE OF THESE LANGUAGES BEFORE THE FIRST START !@{fg text}
  Click your language icon in the drawer @{i}"International"@{ui} to choose
  the language.  You can delete this drawer after that, it won't be
  necessary unless you intend to pick out the other language.
  Choose the English version @{fg highlight}now@{fg text} by clicking @{"this button" system "execute english.script"}.

  How to start:

    1. with the icon - i bet you know how

    2. from Shell - 'BoulderDash' file must be in the current directory
                  - NOSOUND option turns music and sound fx off and saves
                    some memory

@{fg highlight} 2.Main menu@{fg text}


You must wait a moment after starting the game - the faster is your computer
the less you wait. When the animated city picture appears you can choose one
of 3 options: Gallery, Game or Cinema.

Exit: press Esc when the menu is on the screen


@{fg highlight}2.A.Characters Gallery@{fg text}

As you already know your goal is to collect gems and find the exit. The
gallery contains description of most of other game elements. You can acquaint
with all obstacles (prickles, stones, insolent crabs, bee thieves, plasma
cannons, storming tornados) and learn how to fight them. Of course, there are
also useful objects: bombs, rockets, elevators, springs. There's no doubt you
have to see the gallery before you play ! Absolutely !

Use the arrow keys to surf through the gallery. Exit: @{b}Esc@{ub}.


@{fg highlight}2.B.Cinema@{fg text}

You can watch the record of a 2 players' game here. That's how you'll be able
to play in the full version (just 1 player in this demo). It might be very
useful for you to see 2 profis overcoming the 1st level difficulties.
Cast:
       Michal 'Kat' Kosiedowski as the yellow player
       Szymon Ulatowski as the red one.

Besides playing the cameras and windows (described later) you can also use
the following keys in the cinema:
 @{b}P@{ub} - pause
 space - fast forward 
 @{b}Del@{ub} - rewind and play the film again
 @{b}Esc@{ub} - end, back to menu
 @{b}F1,F2,F3@{ub} - screen size: big, medium, small


@{fg highlight}2.C.Game@{fg text}

This is the place where you can try yourself on the only demo version level.
You start with 3 lives. If you succeed (or in other words collect 10 gems and
find the exit) you'll see your time. A time below 100 seconds means that you
already learnt something. If you lose a life you can continue mission by
pressing FIRE (right alt) after the shields recover. If you lose all your
lives, FIRE will start the game from the beginning.

Vehicle controls: (just keyboard in demo version)
   @{b}arrow keys@{ub} - moving, turning
   @{b}right alt@{ub} - stooping and jumping
      This is the most important key. If you learn to control it the 
      success is guaranteed. The mastery hides in the right releasing 
      (and not pressing) that key - this lets you jump.
   @{b}right shift@{ub} - can be used for bomb dropping (if you have one) or starting
      additional rocket engines (if you own them)
   @{b}[ ]@{ub} - looking up and down. A deep stoop (alt) makes the camera viewing 
      straight.    

Other useful keys @{"(see also paragraph 3)" link "klawisze" 0}:

 @{b}P@{ub}   - pause
@{b} Del@{ub} - play again
 @{b}Esc@{ub} - exit to menu
 @{b}F1,F2,F3@{ub} - screen size: big, medium, small

Indicators and numbers on the screen @{"(see the picture)" link "pic.1.32" 0}

In the left upper corner - camera type. It may be:
   a) green digit 1-8 - player 1-8's view
   b) black digit @{fg back}@{bg text}1@{fg text}@{bg back}-@{fg back}@{bg text}8@{fg text}@{bg back} - player 1-8's outside view
   c) x - outside camera
   d) ? - turned off camera

In the player's window additional info is displayed:

-  second number shows the number of gems a player found

-  vertical dotted line informs 'bout the shields condition

-  on the right side - the symbol of the object the player's using
   (in demo version these are: bombs, super shield and rockets)
   and its condition.

@toc "Instrukcja"


@{fg highlight}3.Windows and cameras for advanced users@{fg text}

So far the view from just one camera was shown (and just one window appeared
on the screen). Boulder Dash 3D lets you watch the game's world with a few
cameras at the same time @{"(see the picture)" link "pic.1.32/main" 0}.  Four windows can be shown on the
screen at the same time in this version, each containing the view from one of
4 cameras. You're free to choose any window for any of the cameras.  In Game
and Gallery - camera #1 is the player's view, #2 is the player's outside view
and the #3 and #4 cameras are turned off. In Cinema cameras #1 and #2 are the
players' views and #4 is the outside camera.

You must know which key should be pressed to use that: 

@{b}F4@{ub} - chooses the number of windows
   each press changes the number of windows in the following way:
   1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 -> .....
   If there's more than 1 window, they are lessened to 1/4 screen size.
   Changing of the number of windows causes the standard cameras disposal,
   that is: 1st window - 1st camera, 2nd window - 2nd camera, etc...

@{b}TAB@{ub} - chooses the active window
   the active window is marked with a star * next to the camera symbol.
   If there's just one window - it's always active.

Next functions relate to the active window

@{b}F5@{ub} - chooses the camera for the active window
   pressing F5 lets you choose the camera (1..4) in the similar way to
   the way of choosing the number of windows.

@{b}F6,F7,F8,F9@{ub} - moving the active window
   you can't move the window outside of the screen, so when there's just
   one window and fills the screen those functions don't work. 

@{b}F10@{ub} - puts the active window to the front

<@{b}Num *@{ub}> (PrtSc) - saves the screen in the file @{i}"picture.XX"@{ui}

<@{b}Num /@{ub}> - outside camera defining
   - if the active window contains a player's camera view - defines the
     outside camera position placed where he is (of course, if the player
     moves the camera stays on its place)
   - if the active window contains the outside camera view or a turned off
     camera view it moves the camera to player 1's position.
     (The best way to check out this function is to turn all 4 windows on)

@{fg highlight} 4.What's planned for the full version@{fg text}

Here's the list of functions, which weren't included in the demo version, but
will be found in the full version:

@{b}-*-@{ub} multi player game possibility (meaning a few players playing at the
     same time) on one or two computers (serial port link). (2 computers
     with 4 players mean 8 players at the same time !). You'll be able to
     play according to 1 of 3 rules:
   - competition - everybody collects the gems for himself and tries to
     take them from the other players. Bombs and other weapons are the
     favorite objects in this mode !  
   - cooperation - players collect the gems to the same account
   - team match 

@{b}-*-@{ub} 3D-Stereo mode - separate pictures generation for left and right eyes
   gives a real 3D view 100 times cheaper than the virtual reality helmet
   (watching with the red-green glasses).

@{b}-*-@{ub} saving and replaying a game with different cameras

@{b}-O-@{ub} halls of fame

@{b}-O-@{ub} different difficulty levels, special levels for the fights between 
    players

@{b}-?-@{ub} higher resolution mode for faster computers

@{b}-?-@{ub} level editor 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

      @{b}-*-@{ub} ready, partly tested
      @{b}-O-@{ub} under production
      @{b}-?-@{ub} might be available
