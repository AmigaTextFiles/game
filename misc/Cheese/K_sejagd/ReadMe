First of all:

Sorry, but all program texts and the manual is in german, but 
nevertheless, you won't have any problems with understanding
the game.

A brief english description follows.


"Die große Käsejagd" is Freeware. You use the program at your own risk.
All files have to be distributed together and may not be modified in
any way. The files are:

    gdf  hb        Käsejagd.info  LiesMich.info  m2  ReadMe       tb
    gdm  Käsejagd  LiesMich       m1             mb  ReadMe.info




The game has been programmed by me for a competition in 1991 (without
success). I have found it recently on my harddisk and decided to
publish it now as freeware.

It has been developed under Kickstart 1.2, but has no problems
when running under Kick 3.0, because it has been programmed
according to the official rules (RKMs)...

--------------------------------------------------------------------

You absolutely need a joystick connected to port 1.


The aim of the game is to control the mice so they get as much cheese 
as possible and bring it home.

They climb every ladder and slide down every chute.
When a mouse meets the "bad mouse", it is scared, falls down and runs
away... However, there are some extra mice.
When the cheese is flashing, it is mouldy and the mice don't like that
either...

There are some bonus items:

- numbers 50 or 500:  extra score
- mouse:              additional extra mouse
- scythe:             the "bad mouse" jumps to another location
- yellow cheese:      a normal cheese which is taken by the mouse
- crossed out cheese: the mouse looses its cheese (if it carries one)
- violet cheese:      magic cheese, no mouse can be harmed for a
                      certain time


The game can be canceled by pressing the "Esc" key.

If you have entered a new level and quit the program, this will be
saved. When you restart it, you can choose this level as the start
level.



Have fun !
