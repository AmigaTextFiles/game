<b>Update</b> -- (8/14/2001) Vault Assault was introduced for the first time at the Classic Gaming Expo in Las Vegas on August 11 and 12.
From all accounts, it seemed to be a success.
I traded or sold all of the games that I took with me, but of course I kept a few in reserve for future trades.

Back in the early 1980s, my brother and I were the only two people in Erie, Pennsylvania to like the arcade game Space Zap.
I have always wished that they did a translation to that game for the Atari 2600, but when only two people out of a population of 100,000 would buy a game,
that's not exactly a good business decision.  (Let's just forget about E.T. for a moment, shall we?)

So I did my own.  Here is a screenshot.
And before you ask, no, there is no little ship that comes out and runs around in between waves of attackers.
Maybe I can work that into Vault Assault 2 at CGE 2002.  :D

<h3>
Download Vault Assault source code and binary
</h3>

<p>
Here you can download Vault Assault in both binary and source code form.
The binary can be used in just about any emulator, and in addition, should work just fine with an unmodified Supercharger.
</p>

<p>
The source code is meant to be compiled with DASM by using the following line at the command prompt:
</p>

<p><b>
dasm sz_redux.asm -f3 -osz_redux.bin
