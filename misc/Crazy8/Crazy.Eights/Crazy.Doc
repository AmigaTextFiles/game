     Crazy Eight's by Curt Esser        Version 2.2                 3/97

   Both programs are the same except the 512k chip version doesn't play or
load music modules.   You can use the included Music Selector to choose a
different med module if you wish.   It must be a 4 channel med module or
it won't work with the game.  Also, be aware of how much chip ram you have
available before you try too big of a module!

   This program is EmailWare - send me an email and tell me what you think.
(Even if you don't like it - tell me why!)  Most of the enhancements are
due to user feedback - thanks to all who wrote!

   Use it at your own risk  (I assume no responsibility for any damages
blah, blah, blah). --- Hey, it's Free!

   The game is copyrighted to me, so son't distribute altered versions
without my permission!

   You may distribute it as you wish, but this file must be included, and
also make sure you get all the files in the Data subdirectory, or it
will surely crash!  Do not alter this text file, and if you make any
changes to the program, please send me a copy before distributing it!

   This is a two player version, you against the computer, and is fully
Mouse-driven.  There are no keyboard commands included (Every AMIGA ever
made came with a Mouse, didn't it?), although if somebody REALLY wants
them, write me for the source code and put them in yourself -- I had
enough trouble getting this to work right with the mouse!

: Play

   This is my AMIGA version of the old card game of Crazy Eight's, and
instructions are included with the game itself (just click on HELP), but
I will go over them again here.

   The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards.  Each player is
dealt 5 cards and the next card is turned up to start the discard pile.

>  Although your cards are face up, the computer does not know what
   is in your hand!  (That was for my son, who thinks the computer is
   cheating if it wins.)
 
   The object is to get rid of all your cards, while sticking your
opponent with as many points as you can. 

   In order to play a card, it must be either the same Suit as the card
on top of the discard pile, or the same Rank.

   Eight's are "wild" and can be played on any card.  Also, when an
Eight is played, you can select the Suit which must be played on it.

   For example, let's say the Nine of clubs is the top card.  You can 
play any club on it, or any other Nine (thus changing the Suit), or
any Eight (in this case you may select ANY suit).  

   If you don't have a card in your hand that can be played, you must
pick up cards from the deck until you can play.  However, you are not
REQUIRED to play any card in your hand, and you may pick up as many
cards as you wish before playing (unless the entire deck is used!)

   Your turn is not over until you play a card on the discard pile.
If the entire deck gets used, the discard pile will be shuffled and
used again (except the top card)

   When one player gets rid of all their cards, the hand is over, and
cards remaining in the other player's hand are scored.  The cards are
scored at their face value (6 points for a 6, etc.), picture cards are
scored at 10 points each, Aces are 20, and eights are 50 points.  Try
not to get stuck with an Eight in your hand!  When either player goes
over 200 points, the game is over.

   Please note that the game is scored in reverse - points are ADDED to
your score for the cards you have left when the other player goes out,
so the idea, like in golf, is to get the LOWEST score possible!

 >  To play a card, simply click it with the Mouse. 
 >  To draw a card, click on the deck.
 >  Your hand is automatically sorted for you at the end of your turn.
 >  Click on Sort if you wish to sort it before your turn ends.
      (It won't be sorted If it doesn't need it.)
 >  Click EXIT to quit the game at any time.
 >  Press "M" to turn the music off/on (only works when it's your turn)
 >  Click HIDE to push the screen to the back - this also turns the music
    off till you come back.  You can also grab the very top of the screen
    and pull it down if you wish (does NOT turn music off)
 >  That's it!  Have fun!

   This is my first programming attempt on the AMIGA, as well as my first
BLITZ Basic program, so I would appreciate any comments, questions, bug
reports, complaints, etc.

on it, please enclose $5.00 with your letter or send me a disk of your
stuff + Return postage -  NO PIRATED STUFF PLEASE! Only send things which
are marked as freely distributable! (It will say in the docs.)  The source
can also be sent by email - no charge, just ask me nice. 

-- Please let me know what machine you are using and what workbench! -

   Although I usually pick up my email every day or two, at times I'm
traveling so be patient - I DO answer all Email. 


: Tech

For those interested, the original program was written on an A1000 with 
512k chip and 2 megs of fast ram using Workbench 1.3.

Ver 2.0 was done on an A2000 with 1meg chip and 4meg fast using
Workbench 3.1

Ver 2.1 and 2.2 were done on an A2500 (A2000 w factory installed 68020)
1meg chip   8meg fast ram     Workbench 3.1

It has been reported to run fine on the following:

A500   2.04 workbench
A3000
A4000
A1200  3.0 workbench

Also included is a version without music which should run on machines which
have only 512k of chip ram - or if you would rather not have music.

It should work with any version of Workbench.  The full version will not
work with less than 1meg of memory.
 
The game releases all the memory it uses, and will multi-task if you
have enough memory.

The med Module is one I found on a PD disk and unfortunately I don't know
who wrote it.  If anybody does, please let me know. 

: History


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Program History:

> It was different before, and now it's like this.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes:

> It was different before, and now it's like this.

 Seriously, those who have played the previous versions will notice:

 Version 2.0
 > Music has been added
 > More sounds have been added
 > The game screen will center itself on overscan screens
 > I re-wrote this doc so (hopefully) it's easier to read
 > I re-did the in-game help page so (hopefully) it's easier to read
 
 Version 2.1
 > I took out a forgotten "meltdown" routine test (if you pushed the
   right mouse button the screen would melt and end the game)
 > 512k version included for low chip mem systems

 Version 2.2
 > Music Selector program added
 > Hide button & dragable screen added for easier multi-tasking

-------------------------------------------------------------------------


: Philosophy

I believe that a game, computer or otherwise, should be FUN and I don't
think a game should take itself too seriously so I have tried to put in
a lot of sound effects and also tried to give the computer opponent a
bit of personality.  I hope you enjoy my efforts, but if not please
see "Trashcan Installation" elsewhere in this doc.

Thanks to all the people who have written me already (so far everybody 
liked it - or maybe the people who didn't didn't bother to write!)  I
DO read and respond to my Email, and constructive criticism is always
welcomed, even if I can't spell it!
