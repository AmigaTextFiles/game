Please note:


   This program is PUBLIC DOMAIN  (in other words, Free!)

   Use it at your own risk  (I assume no responsibility for any damages
blah, blah, blah). --- Hey, it's Free!

   You may distribute it as you wish, but this file must be included.

To use it simply shift/click the icon and the icon of the text file you
want to read, or use it as the default tool for a project icon.

If the file was written for Easy.Guide, you will see a series of buttons
at the bottom, allowing you to jump to the specified topics in the file.

If it's a standard text file you won't see any buttons, but you can still
read the document using the gadgets on the right side and as you will see
it is quite simple to add the buttons to an existing text file.

To quit click the EXIT button at the lower right.

To install, just drag the icon to wherever you like.



: It Has
So why do I need ANOTHER text viewer anyway?

Well, this one has a few features that the other ones don't have, and
it doesn't have some I thought were unnecessary (or didn't know how to
do!):

  > It has Buttons for selecting topics.

    Yes, AmigaGuide has buttons too, but not everybody has AmigaGuide.
And did you ever try reading an AmigaGuide document without AmigaGuide?
I have, and I can assure you it's not a pleasent task!  How about
writing one!  I suppose there are editors available for this, but I
haven't seen one yet, and I tried writing one with a normal text editor
(ONCE!) and quickly gave up.  It would have taken longer than writing
the program (and I am NOT a fast programmer).  This program is not
meant as a replacement for AmigaGuide, but it does provide an easy way
to write and read documents while still providing a simple way for the
user to locate various topics within the text.

  > Your text will still be legible if it is read with a different text
viewer.  The button texts are in the program at the top of each topic
(preceded by ": ") and will simply look like headers if another viewer
is used.

  > It centers the document on the screen. (The whole document, not the
individual lines)  Maybe this doesn't bother anyone else, but I don't
like it when the text is all crammed up against the left edge of the
screen with a huge blank area on the right side!

  > It's easy to write a text file to be used with it (or modify an
existing file).  Wherever you want a button to appear, start your line
with ": ". Then follow that with the text that should appear on the
button. For example, to make a button that says "Intro" and goes to the
top of the document when clicked, enter ": Intro" as the first line of
your document. Be sure not to have any extra spaces after the word, or
they will appear on the button too. When the file is displayed, this
line will not appear, but when the user clicks the "Intro" button, the
file will jump to the next line in your text.
   
  > When writing a file there are two things to be aware of:
 
  - limit your text lines to 78 characters or less. Otherwise they may be
    cut off when viewed on a standard 640 pixel wide screen.  The viewer
    DOES NOT WORD-WRAP.    
 
  - Be careful about the number of buttons used, and the length of the
    text on them. If you have too many or too much "button text" you
    could get to the point where you will overwrite the EXIT button
    and make it impossible to exit the program.

: It Won't
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  > What it does NOT do:

  - It doesn't read AmigaGuide texts
    It will, but you will still get all the @NODE {} etc. stuff

  - It doesn't have any keyboard commands
    Just point and click

  - There is no "Help" page
    I don't really think it needs one

  - It doesn't print
    (Unless you use a utility that allows you to print the screen)

  - It doesn't have a search facility
    The point of the buttons is to make this unnecessary

  - It doesn't tell you what line you are on, how many lines there are,
    what %, etc.  Do you really want to know?  If you do, the position
    of the "slider" gadget on the right should give a pretty fair in-
    dication of how far along you are and the size of the gadget will
    show about how long the document is. 

  - It doesn't support tabs, color change commands, centering, etc.
    I thought about putting these in, but again you are left with a
    funny-looking text when used with some other viewers.  

  - It won't read a text file with a space in it's name! For example,
    if a file is named "Help Doc" you will get a blank screen. If it
    is named "Help.Doc" or "Help_Doc" it will be O.K.  I'm not sure
    why this is, if anybody knows I'd like to hear.  For now, just
    be sure there are no spaces in the name of your document.

: Tech

This program was modified from one of the example programs included
with my copy of Blitz Basic II.

This update was done on an A2500 with 1meg chip and 8meg fast using
Workbench 3.1  (A2500 = A2000 + 68020 card)

The program was written using Blitz Basic II ver.1.7

It should work on any Amiga system with any version of Workbench.


: History


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Program History:

 Ver 1.0            first release
 
 Ver 1.1    Should now work with any system - unfortunately to do this, I
            have had to make it use the Topaz 8 font.  Does anyone know
            how to tell from BlitzBasic what the name & size of the
            system fonts are?  If you do, please Email or write me!


 Class dismissed.

: Philosophy

This program is intended to provide an easy to use text viewer for use
with game programs or small utilities, to provide an easy way for you
to write docs but still allow the reader to access the desired topics
quickly.  It is not intended as a general-purpose text reader (although
you could use it that way) nor as a replacement for AmigaGuide which I
think is great for complicated applications or documents, but overkill
for short documents like my game docs.  I hope you can find some use
for it!
