@node "What is it?" "What is it?"
GormanFishtank is a Tamagotchi-like program...  Or is it a virtual pet? Hmm.
Depends on what the definition of a "virtual pet" is, or if there is actually
any difference.

Anyway, said program involves a fish which merrily swims about its bowl, needs
feeding, entertaining and general care and attention.

Just copy the Gorman Fishtank drawer to your hard drive.
@endnode

@node "Requirements" "Requirements"
This program requires:

 - An Amiga (natch)
 - A mouse (ditto)
 - 1 meg memory

However, it runs better with:

 - AGA
 - More memory
 - An accelerator

@node "Notes" " - Notes -"
 - The SOUND @{"tooltype" link "ToolTypes" 0} does not work yet.
 - This release has some "dodgy" samples removed, and I didn't put much effort
into the replacements.  Therefore, the replacements need replacing.
@endnode

@node "Past" "Past"
This is the fourth release of this program. Here's a quick resume of how the
program came about.

 - Originally intended to write a virtual pet program in response to Amiga
   Format's plea for a decent one, and the promise of £50.

 - Started graphics for a program called "Tam" (for Tamogotchi); animation
   frames for a cartoon rabbit.

 - Programming begun; rabbit runs after mouse pointer.

 - Amiga Format complain about flood of Tamogotchi programs, and refuse to
   review any more.

 - Damn.

 - Start animation frames for Gorman Fish (the history of The Fish is far
   too complex and long-winded to explain; suffice to say, it will only be
   revealed upon explicit request).

 - Without any warning, I suddenly find I have developed a fully-working
   virtual pet, albeit with very few features.

 - Messed about with code every now and again, in case any ideas arose.

 - No ideas arose.

 - Began FishEditor, in lieu of anything better to do with it.

 - WindowFish suggested, and the GormanFishtank program was torn to pieces
   and re-assembled to run in a window.

 - Released on my @{"website" link "The author" 0} sometime in late 1999.

 - Submitted to Amiga Format in February 2000.

 - Included on the last cover CD, and won £50 for the best reader
   contribution.

 Started development:    6/98
 Finished development:   I have no idea.
 Total development time: 4 years and counting.
@endnode

@node "Future" "Future"
As it stands, Gorman Fishtank is nowhere near finished.  I still need to:

 - finish the buttons
 - add more pointer actions
 - add more features
 - add loads more secrets
 - change a few samples
 - load/save fish

I'm also developing a few related projects:

 - WindowFish - Fishtank in a window; slightly behind this in development
 - FishEditor - Design your own fish.

Gorman Fishtank will only ever run on a PAL low-res screen.  It is written in
Blitz Basic, and Blitz really doesn't co-operate with advanced hardware like
graphics cards, sound cards or fast accelerators.  It often refuses to work
with such advanced technologies as electricity.

@node "ToolTypes" "Tool Types"
@toc "Instructions"
Various options can be changed by altering the Tool Types in the Icon
Information window:

 - TITLE=ON/OFF            Turns the title picture either on or off.

 - FISH=<name of fish>     Allows different fish to be loaded (see
                           FishEditor documentation).

 - SOUND=ON/OFF            Allows sounds to be turned on or off; sound off
                           reduces the atmosphere of the fish, the memory
                           it consumes and the time it takes to load.

 - STATUS=ON/OFF           If on, the Fishtank loads as normal.  If off,
                           the Fishtank loads, then switches to Workbench
                           and runs in the background (see @{"Keys" link "Keys" 0}).
@endnode

@node "Keys" "Keys"
@toc "Instructions"
The following keys affect the program:

 - Esc         Quits to Workbench.

 - F1          Switches to Workbench, opening a small window.  Closing this
               window switches back to the Fishtank.  While Workbench is
               visible,
               @{fg shine}FISHTANK IS PAUSED@{fg text}.

 - F2          The same as F1, except
               @{fg shine}FISHTANK IS NOT PAUSED@{fg text}.

@toc "Buttons"
Naturally, this button feeds the fish.  If the fish runs out of food, both its
emotional state and health will be affected.
@endnode

@node "Nurse" "Nurse"
@toc "Buttons"
This button brings the fish back to full health, but it only works if the fish
is actually ill.
@endnode

@node "Play" "Play"
@toc "Buttons"
Considering a fish only has fins, not fingers, and lives in a distinctly damp
environment, you might not consider the electric guitar a viable hobby for it.
However, this fish has overcome all of these problems and likes nothing more
than a quick blast of guitar.

Guaranteed to restore the fish to full happiness.
@endnode

@node "Emotions" "Emotions"
@toc "Instructions"
The Gorman fish has fluctuating happiness levels.  When happy, it is less
likely to become ill; its chance of becoming ill increases as it gets
progressively despondent.  A happy fish is a healthy fish.

If the fish's emotional state reaches rock bottom, there is a chance that the
fish will become @{"depressed" link "Depression" 0}.
@endnode

@node "Depression" "Depression"
@toc "Instructions"
Once the fish becomes depressed, there is nothing that can be done for it. It
stops moving, becomes ill and eventually dies.  The @{"nurse" link "Nurse" 0} button has no
effect.
@endnode

@node "Hit the fish" "Hit the fish"
@toc "Instructions"
Should the fish start to annoy you, you can always beat the living *&£% out of
it.  Press the left mouse button, then smack the fish with the mouse pointer.

Unfortunately, beating your pixelised pet results in it losing health, and
reducing its emotional state to its lowest level.
@endnode

@node "Tickle the fish" "Tickle the fish"
@toc "Instructions"
If, after beating your fish senseless, you feel a touch of remorse, or just
want to entertain the fishy fellow, click the right mouse button whilst the
pointer is positioned over the fish.  The pointer tickles the fish, and its
health and happiness levels increase.
@endnode

@node "Illness" "Illness"
@toc "Instructions"
Once your fish has run out of health, illness sets in.  This is signified by
an audible increase in its heart activity, and a rather unfortunate change of
skin colour.  To cure the fish, press the @{"nurse" link "Nurse" 0} button.
@endnode

@node "Death" "Death"
@toc "Instructions"
If the fish is left to fester in its illness for too long, death's icy fingers
begin to work their way up the fish's sickly yellow spine.  The fish turns
into a skeleton, its heart rate accelerating, and only a few seconds remain
before oblivion.  Then, without so much as a forlorn "glub", the fish blows
its last bubble.

Still, never mind, eh?

There are a few CLI arguments, which perform various rather unnecessary
actions.  Use the ? argument to see a list and brief description.
