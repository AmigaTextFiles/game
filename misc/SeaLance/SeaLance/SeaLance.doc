    INTRODUCTION: 
         SeaLance is a modern day advanced version of a modified Trident 
    submarine, currently serving in the United States Navy. 

/**************************************************************************/
    
    HOW TO PLAY (FAST UNDERSTANDING SETUP) 
    
    Screens  
         There are 4 main screens that the Captain uses while commanding 
    SeaLance are: 
     
         1) Bridge Screen 
         2) Damage Screen 
         3) Convential Weapon Screen 
         4) Trident Missile Screen 
     
    Each of these screens will be taken a look at in the following 
    paragraphs.  First, I would like to discuss the Controls of the 
    submarine that are contained in all of the Screens.  This is called the 
    Control Module Center and will hence be refered to as the CMC. 
     
    CONTROL MODULE CENTER (CMC) 
     
    Location:  The Far Lower Left Hand side of the Screen there is a box 
    that has 2 pictures in it. They are:
 
    1) Top View of SeaLance 
     
    -This Tells the Captain how many trident missiles he has left (White is 
    Full Trident Missile Tube) and (Black is an Empty Trident Missile Tube). 
     
    2) The Front View of SeaLance 
     
    -This Tells the Captain if any torpedo tubes have a weapon in them and 
    if they are armed or set for a specfic target. 
    -(Grey is Empty Torpedo Tube) 
    -(Red is a Full Torpedo Tube with either a Tomahawk, SubRoc, or Torpedo 
    armed and ready to be fired at a Target. 
     
    -This also has displayed in it the Dive Planes of the sub when SeaLance 
    is diving the dive planes are facing down and when SeaLance is 
    surfacing the are facing up, running at level depth they are parallel 
    with the hull. 
     
    3) The only other thing located in this section is the Stealth or  
    how quiet SeaLance is being.  The higher the number the greater chance 
    SeaLance has of staying undected.  The quietest SeaLance can be is 99%. 
    There will be more on the Stealth aspact in later parts. 
     
    The Next part of the CMC is right next to the above section and this is 
    where the Captain controls most of the functions of SeaLance along with 
    monitoring some very important systems. 
     
    A Description of Each of these: 
     
    DEP:  is the depth of SeaLance under the water, this is in yds so to 
    get feet multiply it by 3. 
     
    SPD:  is the speed that SeaLance is traveling in MPH or miles per hour. 
    Knots where not used because more people understand MPH than knots, 
    however, to get knots multiply number by 1.1. 
     
    HED:  is the bearing that SeaLance is traveling based upon the World 
    map. 
                        000 = North 
                        090 = East 
                        180 = South 
                        270 = West 
     
    Gadgets Used in Controlling Depth, Speed, and Heading of SeaLance  
    are below the above readouts on the CMC. 
     
    -The Steering wheel is used to change the heading, using the mouse 
    click on the left once or twice to go to the left. For example, 
    clicking on the left side once will change your heading from 000 to 
    359.  To go Right Follow the above steps.  Also, to stop SeaLance from 
    turning either right or left.  This is called "Rudder Amidship!" 
     
    -The Up and Down arrows beside the wheel are used to control the dive 
    planes of SeaLance.  Clicking on the Up arrow will either stop SeaLance 
    from diving or make it begin to Surface.  The opposite is true for the 
    down arrow.  (HINT:  The Hull can start leaking after a depth of 
    500yds. Max Depth Possible Hull can withstand is 750yds before SeaLance 
    Blows apart. 
     
    -The Speed of SeaLance is controled by the throttle device located next 
    to the dive arrows.  To Increase Speed Click above but inside the 
    Throttle gadget, and the same is true to decrease speed but click on 
    the bottom half of throttle gadget. 
     
    Besides these control is 8 Special buttons that control certain 
    functions of Sealance. 
     
    Types of Buttons: 
     
    1) Outlined in Red can only be used once during entire mission. 
     
    2) With Black Arrows on right side of Letters tells Captian if device 
    is up or down. (HINT:  Must be <= DEP: 30yds for device to   
    work.  Also, reduces SeaLance's stealth should not be kept up for very 
    long unless on surface.) 
     
    3) Blue ones when depressed inwards they are ON, and when the are  
    pressed out towards the Captain they are OFF. 
     
    Data on 8 Buttons on CMC: 
     
    BAL:  (BLOW BALLAST TANKS)  if SeaLance is sinking then you can  
    blow your ballast tanks to try to reach the surface. 
     
    DEB:  (LAUNCH FAKE DEBRIS) is used if you are detected and taking  
    heavy embardment of enemy fire, you can use this to try to make them 
    think that SeaLance SUNK.  (Hint:  Better have a high stealth and be 
    deep, or else they will pick you back up on there sonar screens. 
     
    MST:  (ELECTRONIC MAST UP/DOWN) is used to receive information from the 
    satellite.  This must be up and depth <= 30yds to receive a satellite 
    view of the world. 
     
    RAD:  (RADAR UP/DOWN)  is used to receive information about the where 
    abouts of enemy helicopters in the sky.  This must be up and depth also 
    <= 30yds to get data.  
     
    N:    (NUCLEAR REACTOR ON/OFF)  is used to turn on or off the SeaLances 
    power supply.  (Hint:  The only time this should be turned off is when 
    the reactor is damaged and the RC Meter is nearing the Top.) 
     
    P:    (EMERGENCY POWER ON/OFF)  can only be used when nuclear reactor 
    is damaged, this allows Sealance to maintain speed, however, it will be 
    reduced. 
     
    PRS:  (EMERGENCY PRESSURE ON/OFF)  is used if SeaLance is leaking  from 
    either battle damage or exceed safe depth of hull.  What it does is 
    pumps air into leaking segments of the submarine to keep it from 
    sinking any deeper.  (Hint: When using watch the PS meter because you 
    can only keep this up for 90 minutes. To get another supply of Pressure 
    SeaLance must SURFACE.) 
     
    AB:    (ABANDONE SHIP)  well I hope that you will never have to use 
    this, however, I think that you will.  This allows you to save your 
    crew from a sub that can no longer stay afloat and or can no longer 
    fight!  A word of caution SeaLance depth must be <= 99yds inorder for 
    this command to take place.) 
     
    Next to These Buttons is located a recessed little window that is full 
    of 4 meters and some digital information important to the Captain at 
    all times.  They are listed below: 
     
    Meters Include: 
     
    ST: (STATUS OF SEALANCE)  This meter should be at the top for a 
    completely healthy sub.  If it isn't than you have sustained battle 
    damage and should goto the DAMAGE SCREEN. 
     
    LS: (LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM)  By far one of the most important things on 
    SeaLance for without this system all the crew and you will not be able 
    to sustain life aboard SeaLance.  Should be to the top of the Gauge, 
    when it reaches the bottom, Its TOO LATE.  To resupply LSS you must 
    surface SeaLance and also fix the Life Support System. 
     
    PS: (PRESSURE METER)  Tells the Captain how much air he has left to be 
    used for pressure when the meter is at the top there is 90 minutes of 
    air pressure.  To Turn on the pressure use the PRS button described 
    earlier.  To Get more pressure SeaLance must Surface. 
     
    RC: (RADIATION LEVEL)  This meter should be at the very bottom of the 
    gauge.  The closer it gets to the top the more radiation is release 
    from the nuclear reactor and if it reached the top. All the crew of 
    Sealance die of Radiation poisoning and SeaLance Sinks to the bottom of 
    the Sea.  In order to get the level back down the Nuclear Reactor must 
    be fixed.  In order to stop the level from rising any higher turn the 
    Reactor off. 
     
    Digital Readouts: 
     
    LEK:  (LEAKAGE OF SEALANCE)  This means SeaLance is taking on water and 
    this tells the captain how many gallons are rushing in. See the damage 
    Section to see how to stop this. 
     
    CRW:  (CREW MEMBERS OF SEALANCE)  You start off the mission with 150 
    crew members and when the number decreases they are either dead or 
    wounded.  The more men that are killed the more time it takes to repair 
    battle damage.  After a certain number of men are killed damage can be 
    no longer fixed. 
     
    (Hint:  At the beginning of the 16th Mission Day if your on the 
    surface SeaLance will be resuppled with new weapons of your choice and 
    new replacements for dead or wounded crew members) 
     
    TOMS:  Number of TomaHawk Cruise Missiles SeaLance Has Stored or that 
    are not armed with a target. 
     
    TORS:  Number of Torpedos SeaLance has Stored or that are not armed at 
    a target. 
     
    SBRS:  Number of Subrocs II that SeaLance has Stored or that are not 
    armed at a target. 
     
    [NOTE:  More on these weapons later on in Part II of manuel.] 
     
    Next to this data window are two checkered rectangles that have the 
    heading CON and TRI above them, these fire the selected missiles. 
     
    CON:  This lauches the Convential weapons that are programmed in the 
    CON Screen.  It is a double click gadget, the first opens the  
    outer doors and arms the weapon warhead, and the next click lauches the 
    missiles. 
     
    TRI:  This lauches the Trident D-5 missiles that have been selected as 
    weapons to destroy targets that are in range.  This works the same as 
    the CON one.  [NOTE:  That SeaLance must be submerged and >= 30 yds to 
    fire these weapons.] 
     
    Another part of the CMC is the Clock located in the lower right hand 
    corner that has a RED Color number over the analog clock.  This allows 
    the user to speed up the amount of time it takes minutes to go by.  The 
    RED number is how many hours actually go by in a real hour of play. 
     
    For Example, 
                   1 = 1 hour of game is 1 hour of playing 
                   16 = 16 hours of game is 1 hour playing time 
     
    The Parts below this allow the Captain to switch to other screens  
    and there are 4 major screens those being Bridge, Convention Weapons, 
    Damage, and Trident Screen.  Each of These Screens will be discussed in 
    the following Sections. 
     
    All Screens have a Dark Grey Header Above them this contains various 
    useful information.  This part is also the same on all 4 screens.  The 
    Data is explained below: 
     
    DAYS:  The amount of days that you have been at sea the Maxium days you 
    have to complete your mission is 32 full days, so watch this closely to 
    plan the course of SeaLance to obtain range with all of your Trident 
    Missiles. 
     
    TIME:  This is in Miltary Time this tells you the time of day it is and 
    also can give you an idea of when patrols come in and out of sonar 
    range.  Remember they sort of no where your sub is and what your 
    mission is so there out to SHUT YOU DOWN! 
     
    DET (Range of Nearest Enemy Ship):  This is not up at all times it only 
    comes up when SeaLance has been and is detected.  It also  
    gives you the range of the nearest enemy ship. (Hint:  Watch this 
    because this tells you what kind of weapons they can use!) 
     
    (NAME)  Tells you what screen you are currently on. 
     
    EWP:  Very Important warning message tells you that enemy weapons  

    CITIES FREE:  How many cities that are freed from aliens by your
    trident missiles.  (NOTE:  Inorder to win SeaLance you must free
    the correct citiest and there is 20 of them.)

    SCORE:  The score that you have earned so far while playing SeaLance.
    The point values are as follows:
    
       -FREE A CITY    = 2000 pts
       -HIT WROND CITY = -500 pts
       -SINK KIEVS     = 1000 pts
       -SINK MOSKVAS   =  900 pts
       -SINK TYPHOONS  =  800 pts
       -ALL OTHERS     =  100 pts     

     
    BRIDGE SCREEN 

    
         The bridge screen contains a world map that visually shows you
    the place where you are located on the map.
    
    SEALANCE:  Displayed in Red on Map
    CITIES:    Displayed in White on Map

    GX:  Grid X positon on Map.
    GY:  Grid Y position on Map.
    
    Inorder for the map to work you must put up the electronic mast, and
    click on the HUP Blue button on this screen.  This will uplink you
    to the satellite.

    BONUS FEATURE:

         By moving the pointer around inside the map, the program will
    give you the range to that point at which you clicked.  It will be
    the shortest path to that point.  This data will be located under
    the RANGE section.


    DAMAGE SCREEN


         In this section I will list all possible damage and tell you
    what the systems does on SeaLance. 

    To Fix Damage:  Move the mouse pointer over top of the name of the
    damage and click to begin fixing.  The letters will turn light blue.
    You can only repair one thing at a time, so fix the system that you
    need to stay alive or fight back, this is up to you. [Note:  The more
    crew that are wounded or killed the longer it takes to repair the
    damage.  One Beep of sound = damage system repaired, then go back and
    select the next one to repair.

    ---------------------- Damage List If Damaged ------------------------

    Bow Tubes:  cannot fire any convential weapons.

    Dive Planes: cannot dive, surface, or level off.

    Radar:  cannot raise or lower this mast and no view of helis
            around Sealance.

    Electronic Mast:  cannot get a satellite picture of the world.

    Hull:  SeaLance is leaking and sinking this is a priority 
           thing to fix.

    Life Support:  you are losing air to breath and if the guage gets
                   to the buttom you pass out and die, this is also a
                   priority system to fix. 

    Rudder:  cannot steer Sealance on course where rudder is stuck.

    Con Weapon Sys:  cannot select a target and arm a weapon.

    Ballast Tanks:  cannot use Emergency Ballast to try to stay 
                    afloat.

    Water Intake:  reduces speed.

    Conning Tower: (Unknown???)

    Tri Weapon Sys:  cannot fire or arm trident missiles.

    Proplusion Sys: reduces speed.

    Sonar:  cannot tell where any of the enemy ships are but the 
            one that the Con Weapon System is locked onto with the 
            backup system.

    Nuclear Reactor:  Gives most of the power to ship, must be fixed
                      or you lose control of speed, and also if damaged
                      the reactor is leaking and if it leaks to much, you
                      die of radiation.  This is a Priority system to fix!

    Emergency Power:  cannot use emergency power.


    CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS SCREEN


         This is considered the most important screen for staying alive
    and well because this lets you keep track of all enemy activity both
    helis amd ships.

    ESP: (##)  This tells you how many enemy ships there is that are 
    within range of sonar.  The Maxium range of Sonar is 75 miles.

    EHC: (##)  This tells you how many enemy helicopters there is you
    don't even need the radar mast up because the sonar picks up the
    sonar that they drop into to the water to try to detect SeaLance.

    L  : Est 60 Miles
    M  : Est 30 Miles
    S  : Est 10 Miles  
    These let you select the range you want to view the ships and
    helicopters on your sonar screen.  Click on the one to change the
    range.

    SONAR:
      COLORS:
        WHITE:  Enemy Ship!
        RED:    Selected Ship!
        YELLOW: Ship that has been Fired at!
        GREEN:  Helicopters!

    SHIP INFORMATION BLOCK

    PICTURE:
    The top square shows a picture of the ship that the data is all
    about, this also shows you what type of ship it is.

    CLASS:  Tells the Class of Enemy Ship.
    DEPTH:  Tells the Depth of The Enemy Ship in yds.
    RANGE:  Tells the Range in miles that the ship is away from SeaLance.
    SPEED:  Tells the Speed of the Ship in mph.
    B:      Tells where the ship is according to SeaLance.
    H:      Tells where the ship is heading or its course.

    UP ARROW:  Allows you to scan up enemy targets.
    DOWN ARROW: Allows you to scan down enemy targets.
 
    NUM: (##)  Tells you what number of ship that you are on in the list
    of enemy ships, that are detected by sonar.

    RED MISSILE:  This is the Icon for Tomahawk Missile.
    WHITE MISSILE:  This is the Icon for Subroc II's Missile.
    GREY TORPEDO:  This is the Icon for MK-52 Torpedo's.

    Selecting a Target with Missile:

      Click on the missile or weapon of choice to destroy the enemy ship,
    then the missile that you selected will be put in the bow tubes and
    prepared to be armed.  Next click inside the information box to 
    select that target.  After this is done the data will be placed next
    to the information box, which allows you to remember what ships that
    you have targeted.

    [Note: Two Beeps of Sound = more enemy ships detected!]


    TRIDENT SCREEN


      Without this system your mission can not be complete and the world,
    will not be saved.  In this screen there is a list of 40 possible 
    targets of cities, 20 of which are actual targets that must be 
    destroyed by a trident d-5 missile.  The 20 targets are listed below
    in target identification section.  Some of the functions on this screen
    are explained below:

    SELECTING A CITY:  Click on the City name and the City will be targeted
    with a Trident D-5 missile when you launch them.  [Note:  It will not
    be launched if the city is out of missile range.]  When selected the 
    city will be outlined in Red on this screen.

    Update messages will be displayed in the city spot to tell you the 
    progress of the missiles that have been fired.  [Note:  These are 
    displayed in light blue color.]

    MIS:  Tells you how many missiles that are still on SeaLance and
    that have not be launched.

    ARM:  Tells how many missiles have been armed and with selected
    targets.

    AVA:  Tells how many missiles that you have left to arm.

    PART II SELANCE SYSTEMS AND TECH DATA 
     

    SEALANCE CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS 
     
         TOMAHAWKS:  Are cruise missiles that can be lauched from torpedo 
    tubes of submarines, at specfic ground and sea targets.  For example, 
    and enemy ship or enemy radar stations as they are performing in combat 
    in the persian gulf.  The range of Sealances Tomahawks cruise missiles 
    is 125 miles, due to the primary role on board SeaLance is an antiship 
    missile defense system.  The speed of this weapon system is great and 
    this information is classified, (Given in the range data section when 
    arming SeaLance.)  These are by far the best weapons to use against 
    enemy ships.  [Note:  These can not be used against enemy submarines.] 
    These Weapons are very effective as they had shown in the Persian Gulf
    in 1991.
 
         SUBROC II'S:  Are an antisubmarine missile designed to be launched 
    form torpedo tubes, against enemy submarines.  These weapons are the 
    most effective weapon used against enemy submarines.  They have a 
    Maxium range of 35 miles but travel at a      speed of (Classified: 
    Given in the Range Data when arming SeaLance.)  The class II of the 
    weapon differs from the orginal subrocs in that they don't have a 
    nuclear device on board, instead they use a homing torpedo.  [Note: 
    These weapons don't travel through the water the launch out of the 
    torpedo tubes and fly towards there targets at about 6 ft above the 
    surface of the water.  These are hard for enemy submarines to detect 
    and when they do its to late. 
     
         TORPEDOS MK-52:  Are by far the most common weapon of submarines 
    in the past and why should SeaLance be the only submarine never to use 
    these weapons.  They are effective against submarines or surface 
    combatants.  They travel at a speed of over 55mph and have a Maxium 
    Range of 35 miles.  (Hint:  Remember when firing a torpedo at a target 
    at great range that the target could possibly outrun the range of the 
    torpedo, therefor the the torpedo will be wasted.  Weapons on board 
    submarines are a great commodity and should not be wasted, for there 
    your only defense. 
     
    SEALANCE NONCONVENTIONAL WEAPONS: 
     
         TRIDENT D-5:  Are setup to be fired against cities that have  been 
    taken over by the aliens.  The warhead contains a small nuclear device 
    to pentrate the aliens force field, and then the rest of the warheads 
    hit the city releasing a virus that kills the aliens, putting the 
    humans or us back in control.  The rest of the information about this 
    weapon system is classified and the data is contained in SeaLance 
    itself. (Note:  These weapons are not toys and should be used with 
    extreme caution, and with right reasons.  Hopefully, they will never be 
    used in a real life, but a weapon that is made, can never be 
    disregarded as never going to be used, Unfortunatly.) 
     
    ENEMY WEAPONS: 
     
         TORPEDO:  These are basically the same as the ones used on 
    SeaLance, however, there ability to cause extreme damage to Sea:ance is 
    very very unlikly.  The range and speed of this weapon is estimated to 
    be they same as SeaLance.  Howver, that information is not aviable. 
    (Hint:  Remember the best way to avoid being hit is staying 
    undetected.) They can be launched from  
    helicopters also. 
     
         DEPTH CHARGES:  These are weapons that can fit on just about any 
    craft and be somewhat accurate and destructfull.  The disadvantages of 
    using depth charges is that they enemy must be almost overtop of you 
    and they have to be set to a certain depth before they expode, so you 
    can either be deeper than there set depth or shallower. 
     
         RBU'S:  These are weapons somewhat like a depth charge, however, 
    they can launched up to 2 miles away from SeaLance and also they are 
    set to variable depths.  So the enemy gets an even spread of the 
    warheads to all depths of the water.  (Hint:  Harder to avoid from 
    being hit.)

    PART III SeaLance Game Options and Options Screens

	This section goes into some detail on the Main Option screen of the
    game which is brought up on the screen, when you click on the Menu 
    Mouse button.  I will describe what each option, does the pictures on
    all of the menu screens certain parts are gadgets so just click on them
    to get that part to work.

    MAIN MENU:

      SHIPS: (Novice or Expert)  Makes the Enemy better and searching for
      you and also in combat.

      WEAPONS: (Novice or Expert)  Makes SeaLance weapons less accurate and
      the enemy weapons more effective.

      MOVIES: (On or Off)  Allows you to turn off the animation part of 
      SeaLance after you get sick of seeing the screens during play.  When
      the option is off, sound makes up for the lack of animation.

      SOUND: (On or Off)  If you don't want to here the sound of the game
      either because you don't want someone to know your playing a game, or
      if you are listening to music then you can use this option.

      MIDDLE PART:  This is a List of SeaLances best 10 Captains and how
      they scored, I myself have never yet finished the Mission.  Thats 
      why I have given you the mission, I designed the weapon system and
      now it is time for you to take command.

      LOAD GAME:  Allow you to load up to 4 versions of the mission, so that
      you can come back at play again.  Also the game should take about 30
      real time hours to WIN because of Travel time around the globe.

      SAVE GAME:  Allows you to save up to 4 versions of the mission.

      NEW GAME:  Allows you to start a new game without having to reboot
      the system.

      QUIT GAME:  Allows you to quit either back to Amiga Dos or WorkBench
      depending on how you loaded Sealance.

      *** To get back to the game click again on the menu button or on the 
      continue SeaLance gadget.

      OTHERS

      There is some other option and data screens they are:
      
        -Arming SeaLance
        -Enter High Score
        -Start New Game or Load Old Game
        -Game Over (Sunk or Won)
        -Load Game
        -Save Game

      These screens work the same way that all the others have so I will
      let your knowledge figure them out they are pretty easy to 
      understand.

    PART IV Future Updates of SeaLance

         Future updates totally depend on the amount of response I get 
    back from users of SeaLance.  Hopefully, this will be everybody
    because I have spent alot of time making this program one of the
    truly best Submarine simulators avaiable to date.  The following is
    a list of possible ideas avaible on upcoming versions, if I get
    enough shareware response.  Oh, also I welcome your ideas to just
    include them with your shareware fee.  Please recognize all ideas
    sent to me will be the property of Jason Bauer.

    Future Ideas:

    -More Enemy Ships including ships from other navies such as the U.S
    
    -Improved Enemy Capbilities

    -Continous Action!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    

    -3d Graphics

    -Revolving Torpedo Tubes (Classified)

    -More Digitized Pictures and More Sound Effects

    -Better Sonar Screen with more options for this function

    -Fiber Optics MST and RADAR so SeaLance can stay at maxium depth

    -Better Materials in the Hull, Greater Depths

    -More Detailed World Map

    -Faster Code!

    -KeyPad Control

    -ECM System (Use: Classified, Sorry.)

    -NAP System (Use: Classified, Sorry.)

    -PLUS MUCH MUCH MUCH MORE, COMING IN THE FUTURE FOR SEALANCE V2.0

    PART V  About Programmer and ShareWare

       This section will tell you a little more about me the programmer and
    about shareware.  First of all, Shareware is where you get a copy of a
    program and play or use it, before you actually purchase it by sending
    the author money then you have purchase the program.  If you don't like
    the program which I cannot believe why you wouldn't like SeaLance you 
    don't have to send in the donation.  This is basically and Honor system,
    well I just wanted to clear up what shareware is.  I would like to 
    encourage everyone to spread the disk all over as long as all the files
    stay with the running version.

          I am a sophmore at Central Michigan University majoring in 
    computer science, and minoring in earth science.  I have been 
    programming since I was in 6th grade, and taught myself 'C' when I 
    was a sophmore in high school.  I have written a couple public
    domain programs before starting this project.  They are Ups & Downs and
    Humartia.  Oh, I just wanted to mention I'm sorry for any spelling
    errors in this documentation, but I have been trying to get this 
    written so I can get Sealance out to the public.  I am currently
    workly on 2 other programs that will be released as commercial 
    software.  The titles and ideas behind them I cannot release at this
    time but in the future, look for other programs by Jason Bauer.  I
    wrote SeaLance on an Amiga 500 with no hard disk drive, so for all
    programmers out there it can be done without the use of the best model
    of computer such as the Amiga 3000.  I hope you enjoy SeaLance and 
    I look forward to hearing from you in your letters.  Thanks!
