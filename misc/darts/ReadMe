                                 "DARTS 5O1"

Short:        1 or 2 Player Darts Game.


Objective:    Starting with a score of 501 or 301, each player takes turns
              to throw 3 darts in an attempt to get their score to 0 first.
              Hitting a score of 0 must be done exactly by use of a Double
              number or a Bullseye.

              eg. If you have a score of 40, a Double 20 is needed.
                  If you have a score of 50, a Bullseye may be used.

              When a player finishes with a Double/Bullseye they win a LEG.
              When the player then reaches a pre-defined number (1-10) of
              LEGS, a SET is then awarded.
              The match winner is the player with the most SETS won
              within the Best Of a pre-defined number of SETS.
              Single matches between Human players and/or CPU players, or
              a 1 Player SEASON MODE can be played.
