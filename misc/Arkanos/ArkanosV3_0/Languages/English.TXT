                          Also greetings to MALTE MENDE <Germany> for \
                          his annoying review of version 1.2 and his \
                          idea for more action on the screen. Hey Malte, \
                          this is a breakout game no action shooter. \
                          What about this version ? Multiple balls and \
                          multiple bonus items that falls down more \
                          realistic with gravity. Enough ACTION for \
                          you ???        Special thanks to MARIO JAHN \
                          <Germany> for reporting errors since version
                          1.1! He also wanted a german version of this \
                          game, so I've added multi-language support. \
                          I hope you like it MARIO. Thank you also for \
                          helping to test the game engine of this \
                          version. It saved me lots of time. >>> THANK \
                          YOU VERY MUCH, MARIO <<<    Last time I though \
                          it is the final version, but it wasn't. There
                          will be bug fixes and maybe new features. >>> \

                          Sorry, I have forgotten to ask: has somebody a \

                          the music. This music is okay. I found it \
                          on my hard disc. I think it's from an earlier \
                          version of MEGABALL. Can someone tell me if \
                          I'm right ???    >>> Now this text will repeat \

                          >>> NO <<< Why not? --- You should PLAY this \
                          game, not reading stupid scroll text. Do you \
                          think I tell you the cheats here?   -> NO WAY \

@SHOP_MESSAGE13:          REDUCE DIAGONAL WALLS. Make the next level even more easier. No problems with passages.
@SHOP_MESSAGE14:          SPEED LIMIT. Reduce the maximum ball speed for comfortable playing.
@SHOP_MESSAGE15:          DOUBLE SCORING. All points counts twice. Good choice if you have some money left!
@SHOP_MESSAGE16:          EXTRA BALL. Always keep enough balls in the storage! Playing with multiple balls is harder, but faster!
@SHOP_MESSAGE17:          EXTRA PADDLE. Really need another paddle? Better collect the extra diamonds.
@SHOP_MESSAGE18:          SORRY, NOT ENOUGH MONEY!
@SHOP_MESSAGE19:          NO MORE LEVELS FOR PREVIEW. YOU ALREADY FINISHED THE LAST LEVEL!
@SHOP_MESSAGE20:          YOU ALREADY HAVE THE LARGEST PADDLE!
@SHOP_MESSAGE21:          YOU ALREADY HAVE BOUGHT THIS ITEM!
