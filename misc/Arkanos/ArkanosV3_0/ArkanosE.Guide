  Yeap. It looks like ARKANOID. Nope, it's not just another break out
  clone. I know there are many break out games available all around the
  world. But none of them can be compared to each other. Some have this,
  others have that, but they have nothing in common.
  Most of all is self-explaining. I just make this manual that you have
  some kind of reference. Version 3.0 is a complete rework. Even if you
  are familiar with version 2.1 please read the complete manual.

@node MAINSCREEN "Arkanos V3.0 - Title Screen"

  When you double click on the programm, you see a big "LOADING..."
  screen and some information below. Ignore that for the moment. You
  can configure the game to your needs from the startup. But first you
  need to know what you configure. The first time please read the
  sections as they appear in the main menu of the document.

  Next a little animation comes up. After that the main menu appears.
  On the right you see the menu buttons, and on the left you have the
  quick information pages. Click the PREVIOUS or FORWARD buttons to
  switch through the four pages. Move the mouse over an item and wait
  there to get a short help text. Now the menu buttons on the right,
  from top to bottom:

  @{IT "Paddle type:"}
  @{IT "~~~~~~~~~~~~"}
    Here you can choose between the traditional konvex paddle and real
    physics. With the convex paddle the ball reflects like from a half
    circle around your paddle. It's the easy method that most people
    are familiar with. With the real physics you must move the paddle to
    change the ball's direction. @{"Click here" link RealPaddle.IFF/MAIN} to see the basic concept.
    At position @{B}N@{UB} the paddle does not move. At position @{B}1@{UB} the paddle
    moves along the ball direction and the ball direction levels off.
    At position @{B}2@{UB} the paddle moves against the ball direction and the
    ball direction rises. The more you move the paddle at ball impact,
    the greater will be this effect.

  @{IT "Bonus type:"}
  @{IT "~~~~~~~~~~~"}
    This button changes how bonus items fall down. With the normal mode
    the bonus items fall straight down with constant speed. With the
    enhanced mode the ball "cuts out" the bonus from removed blocks.
    The initial moving direction of the bonus item depends on the ball
    and changes downwards with gravity force!

  @{IT "Mixing mode:"}
  @{IT "~~~~~~~~~~~~"}
    This button simply changes between normal linear level playing and
    mixing all levels in groups of 50 levels. When mixing the levels
    you get 50% more jackpot score, block hits count 2 points more and
    the final bonus is 50000 points instead of 20000 points.

  @{IT "Start New Game"}
  @{IT "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"}
    Click here to start a new game with the current level set and the
    settings of the previous three buttons. These settings can not
    be changed anymore!

  @{IT "Load Game"}
  @{IT "~~~~~~~~~"}
    Before version 2.0 I used passwords, but with the game statistic
    it would be too complex for a password system.
    Here the "Saves" folder is searched for valid save games and you
    can select one to load. If the save game uses a different level-set
    it will be loaded too. Finally you can see the game settings with
    some other information.

  @{IT "Load Levels"}
  @{IT "~~~~~~~~~~~"}
    Here also the file selector appears and you can load a different
    level-set to play. You can create level-sets with @{"my editor" link EDITOR}.
    Select a file to load the new levels with the high score.

  @{IT "Show Hiscore"}
  @{IT "~~~~~~~~~~~~"}
    Here you can look at the top 10 players for the loaded level-set.
    Each line has the name, the score and a button where you can see
    the @{"statistic" link STATSCREEN} of the game.

  @{IT "Game Options"}
  @{IT "~~~~~~~~~~~~"}
    The options screen has been added with version 2.0. There are no
    changes here, except the display. You can still clear the high
    score merge with another high score and export the high score as
    text file, but without the statistic. And there is information
    about the loaded music modules and free memory.
    And you can change the following things: sounds, music, flash block
    hits and show start animation. You can preset these options with
    the @{"configuration file" link CONFIGFILE}.

  @{IT "QUIT GAME"}
  @{IT "~~~~~~~~~"}
    Guess ??? Right !!! Here you quit back to AmigaDOS or Workbench.
    Do you really want to leave this great game ? Oh, you want to
    create some levels with @{"your registered copy of the editor" link EDITOR}.

@endnode
@node GAMESCREEN "Arkanos V3.0 - Game Screen"

    @{HI "The Playing Screen"}
   @{HI "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"}

  At the top you can see this information panel:

      +-----------++----------+----------------------------+
      | ######### || /=\ x### | DIAMONDS  EXTRA  BONUS x## |
      ++---------+++---+----+-+--+----+----+----+----+----++
      || Ox##### ||    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    ||

  It has totally changed since version 2.1, so please read this section
  at least once.
  First of all the bonus points have been removed. On the top left
  corner you can see you current score. To the right is the number of
  paddles. And the large box further right contains the bonus items.
  You can collect 8 diamonds, 5 letters that spells the word EXTRA and
  5 letters that spells the word BONUS. Right to the word BONUS you
  see the score multiplicator.
  On the bottom line you see your money on the left. And there are
  eight slots for some bonus items.

  Under it is the level area. On the bottom you have your paddle and
  the left edge contains the ball storage. There is a limited room
  for 40 balls. More balls are stored "outside" the screen and the
  storage is automatically refilled if you launch a new ball. With
  version 3.0 you must also keep track of your balls you are playing
  with! Click the right mouse button to launch a ball. You must remove
  all blocks from the level. For each block you remove you get points
  depending on the speed of the balls. You can launch more balls if
  you want, but don't let them fall down! There are 16 balls allowed
  to play. When you remove normal blocks there may be bonus items
  falling down. Catch them with the paddle to get extras.
  When all blocks have been removed you must shoot all balls back to
  the storage. There is an entry on the top left corner of the level.
  To make it easier the entry start to soak in near balls.

  While playing the balls starts moving faster. The ball speed at the
  start of the level is 6, quite comfortable. If the speed reaches 16
  it will be quite challenging to keep multiple balls on the level.
  The maximum speed is 36. If the speed would reach 37, the ball trap
  mechanism removes all indestructable and special blocks and the ball
  speed is set 6.
  If the balls are trapped in a wall labyrinth this mechanism won't
  help you much. You can try to shake the level with the <SPACE> bar.
  But not too much! All balls change the moving direction. Use this
  feature wisely to finish the levels faster. You hear a warning
  sound -- if sounds are enabled -- and the background flashes white
  when the next use would cause a TILT. In this case the paddle would
  freezes so that you will finally loose all balls. Wait at least 10
  seconds after the warning before you use the <SPACE> bar again.

  You loose your paddle if all balls fall down. Then the @{I}BONUSTIMER @{UI}
  is reduced by two seconds and a new paddle appears. Launch new balls
  to continue. The game is over if you have no paddles anymore @{B}OR@{UB}
  you have no balls in the storage! Have always on eye on the number
  of balls.
  You get a free ball at 20000 points. For the next ball you need 2000
  points more, that is 22000. The next free ball is at 42000 points,
  then with 66000 points and so on. The same applies to free paddles.
  You get the first free paddle with 100000 points. For the next one
  you need 20000 points more. The next free paddle is at 220000 points,
  then with 360000 points and so on.

  After you have cleared the level you can see the level statistic.
  For more details click on the "STATISTIC" button and you can see
  the statistic screen.
  If you have save-tokens you can click the "SAVE" button to save the
  current game. Every 5 levels you get a free save-token to save your
  game. But there are other ways to get save-tokens.
  With the button "ENTER SHOP" you enter the shop where you can buy
  save-tokens. If you save the game you cannot enter the shop anymore.

  There are 50 levels in each level set. If you solved all of them you
  start from the beginning, with less good bonus items and more bad
  bonus items. This happens four times, so level 200 is finally the
  last one. At the end you get 40000 points bonus for clearing all
  levels. When you mix the levels you get 100000 points! For each left
  paddle you get 5000 points. Your left money is multiplied by five
  and added to your score. And for each save-token you get 1000 points.

  That's it. Your final score will be tested for the top ten high
  score list. You may enter your name (at most 24 characters). After
  that the new high score with the statistic will be saved to disc.
  UNPROTECT YOUR FLOPPY OR THE HIGHSCORE WILL NOT BE SAVED!!

@node CONFIGFILE "Arkanos V3.0 - The Configuration File"

    @{HI "How to configure Arkanos"}
   @{HI "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"}

  When the programm start, you can see the big LOADING... text. Under
  it you see what the programm loads. It's in dark grey, so you should
  not bother about it if everything is okay.

  All information is saved in the file "Arkanos3.Config". Lines starting
  with semicolons (;) are comments, they are ignored. The first four
  items set the directories for the game font, the levels, the graphics,
  the language files and the save games. You can use any legal AmigaDOS
  path here, even logical assigns if they exist at programm start. You
  need no slash (/) at the end of directories.

  Next you see the files to use. The game font and the language can't
  be changed. The level-set can be changed in the main menu. Next follow
  the game options. The first four can be changed and saved in the
  options menu. And the bottom three can be changed on the main menu.

  At the end is the module list. Enter your modules you want to use
  while playing the game with full path. You can load 100 modules if
  you have enough memory. But remember: the module must be moved
  to chip memory that it can be played. If you have just 512K of chip
  memory you may only load small modules (<50K). With 1MB of chip memory
  you can load large modules (>150K) too.
  Have a look at the options menu. There you see how many modules have
  been loaded into fast memory. You also see the size of the largest
  module and a status if it can be played:
    *) red:    There is not enough free chip memory. Not all modules
               can be played, only the small ones.
    *) yellow: There is enough free chip memory, but the required
               amount may not be in a continuous region. There may
               be playing problems with large modules.
    *) green:  Everything is okay, all modules should be playable.

  You have to edit the file to play you own modules. I have my modules
  in "Dh1:Musik/Module", so with my file probably no modules are loaded.

@node INSTALL "Install to HD, Floppy or WinUAE"


  Requirements:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   -> An Amiga, not too slow (mine is 68030 with 25 Mhz and FPU)
   -> Memory: 612K chip, 740K fast to run, 1156K disc space to install
   -> Workbench 2.0 (or above) to run that thing. The game does not
      run with WB 1.3 or lower. So please upgrade! (thanks, Mario!)
      With some accessories running in the background problems may
      occur. Please turn them off and start the game again. (I have
      MagicMenu V2.21 and Toolmanager V2.1 running without problems.)


  Install to hard disc:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Only copy all files into your desired drawer. Configure the
      game as you like with the @{"Arkanos3.Config" link CONFIGFILE} file.


  Install to floppy disc:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      The game grows, so it doesn't fit on a single floppy anymore. Read
      the WinUAE section below how to setup multiple disks.


  Install on WinUAE:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Depending on how you want to play you can install to an emulated
      hard disk or use floppy disc images. Because I've programmed and
      tested most parts under WinUAE I don't expect problems. Create
      at least two empty discs.
      The first disk is the boot disk, so make it bootable and add the
      following files with their directories:

        c/endcli
        c/loadwb
        libs/mathtrans.library
        libs/icon.library

      Create the file @{I} s/startup-sequence @{UI} with this content:

        LoadWB
        EndCLI

      Now rename the first disk to "ARKANOS3" and copy all files that
      will never change:

        Arkanos
        Arkanos.info
        Arkanos3.Anim
        Arkanos3.Config
        Arkanos3.Data
        ArkanosD.Guide
        ArkanosD.Guide.info
        ArkanosE.Guide
        ArkanosE.Guide.info
        Loading.Data

      Finally change the "Arkanos3.Config" file. Add "ARKANOS3_DATA:"
      in front of the directories names. (But after the = symbol.)
      Now you can create and compressed ADZ image from the first
      disk. But remember that you can't change the configuration!

      Now rename the second disk to "ARKANOS3_DATA" and copy the
      remaining directories:

        Fonts/...
        Graphics/...
        Languages/...
        Levels/...
        Saves/...

      That's it. Don't compress the second disk. You would not be
      able to save your high scores. You may add your @{"editor" link EDITOR}
      on the second disk. If you have problems, you can have my
      configuration and ADF files.

@endnode
@node EDITOR "How to create your own levels"

  Hmmm, I don't know what to say about that. Get yourself a hex editor
  reserve some bytes, and ... Did you really think I explain how the
  levels are saved to disc that you could create your own editor to do
  the job?

  Not very realistic, isn't it? You can use @{"my editor" link REGISTER}, if you want to.
  But the editor is shareware. The game is freeware. WHAT'S THAT ???

  No, joke. Some people only want to play, and some artists also create
  new levels. So why should the players pay something, if there exists
  many other breakout clones ?

  Sure, I could say the editor is giftware, but if you are realistic:
  who would send me some presents for this clone ? You can decide now:

  *) Try another breakout clone with a free editor included

     or

  *) Support me, support the AMIGA, and @{"register for the editor" link REGISTER}.

@endnode
@node REGISTER "A great game, isn't it ???"

  There is no limit in playing the game. You can also play levels
  from your friends, Aminet,...  But you can't create new levels.
  You can "buy" the editor from me for a small amount of cash.


  So if you want to register for the editor then do the following:

    1.) Use my @{"registration form" link REG_FORM} and write down your name and your COMPLETE
        address. (Add the configuration of your AMIGA if you want)

    2.) Put it together with 15 EURO (outside Europe 20 US-Dollar)
        into an empty envelope. NO OTHER CURRENCIES PLEASE!!! Add a
        formatted disc and just an addressed envelope (no stamp!).

    3.) Send it to @{"me" link INFOS} (click here for my address)


  When I get your money, I will do the following:

    4.) Create your registered version of the editor and return it to
        you by mail, also by special delivery if you want.

    5.) I'm very happy that you support me. The editor is shareware and
        I beg you not to copy it to your friends. You will always get ONE
        major update from me, if neccessary.

    6.) Finally I hope you enjoy my game and look foreward for more on
        Aminet. Or contact @{"me" link INFOS}.


  Any questions ? Then contact @{"me" link INFOS}.

   @{HI "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"}

  On the left you see the graphics area, and on the right are some
  information and you can choose between these 5 graphic types:
  - SCORE: Here you see your score. There are four different types
        from bottom to top: GREEN for memory games, YELLOW for bonus
        levels, ORANGE for jackpots and RED for normal points.
  - LIVES: Here you see two lines. A RED line shows the number of
        paddles and a YELLOW line shows the number of balls.
  - MONEY: Here you see a line with the amount of money after you
        quit the final level information.
  - BONUS: Here you see a line how much bonus items you have
        collected.
  - BLIST: That's the final statistic from version 1.2. Here you see
        all bonus items with their relative percentage and the number
        in the box tells you how often you have collected the bonus.

  With the double arrow in the bottom right corner you can zoom in/out
  the graphic area. Click here at the BLIST to change between
  percentages and absolute values. Use the sliders and arrows to
  scroll the graphic.
  At zoom level 3 or higher you can place the mouse pointer on the

@node BLOCKTYPES "Arkanos V3.0 - Block Types"

  @{HI "SCORE UP"}
    This increases your score by 1 to 16 points. Very great block
    with BREAKTHROUGH bonus activated.

  @{HI "SCORE DOWN"}
    This decreases your score by 1 to 16 points. Always avoid this
    block, especially with the BREAKTHROUGH bonus.

  @{HI "SPEED UP"}
    Increases ball speed by one up to speed 34. Can you still follow
    the ball with your eyes ? If you bought the SPEED LIMIT item in
    the shop the speed increases up to speed 16.

  @{HI "SPEED DOWN"}
    Decreases ball speed by one down to speed 4. Very boring, don't
    you think ? I fall asleep... Zzzz

  @{HI "RANDOM DIRECTION"}
    The ball leaves this block at random direction.

  @{HI "MOVING BLOCK"}
    Hit this block and it will move one position depending how the
    ball hits the block. The new position must be free. TRY IT !!!

  @{HI "INDESTRUCT"}
    This block can't be destroyed. After many hits the ball changed
    the moving direction a little bit (DX or DY ±1). That's only to
    prevent the ball from infinite loops and makes the game more
    interesting.

  @{HI "1-HIT INDESTRUCT"}
    Hit this block once and it changes to an INDESTRUCT block.

  @{HI "SHORT CUT"}
    The ball will disappear, and appear at the other end of the short
    cut. It's also possible that the ball will change its direction a
    little bit to avoid loopings between short-cuts.

  @{HI "DYNAMITE"}
    Hit this flashing block will explode all 8 surrounding blocks, if
    there are some. If there is another DYNAMITE block around, a chain
    reaction starts. But these blocks always counts 8 points, no matter
    what the ball speed is.

  @{HI "DYNAMITE LIGHT"}
    Like the dynamite block above, but here only other dynamite blocks
    explode. It's like a fuse.

  @{HI "DYNAMITE BLOCK"}
    Also like the dynamite block, but here instead of free space normal
    blocks are left you have to remove.

  @{HI "5-HIT BLOCK"}
    Hit this block and it will be reduced to a 4-HIT BLOCK.

  @{HI "4-HIT BLOCK"}
    Hit this block and it will be reduced to a 3-HIT BLOCK.

  @{HI "3-HIT BLOCK"}
    Hit this block and it will be reduced to a 2-HIT BLOCK.

  @{HI "2-HIT BLOCK"}
    Hit this block and it will become a normal block, the grey one.

  @{HI "4-HIT EXPANDER"}
    This will expand at the edges to 3-HIT EXPANDER. There must be
    a free field or normal size blocks. The larger blocks, walls and
    the jackpot fields are not replaced!

  @{HI "3-HIT EXPANDER"}
    This will expand at the edges to 2-HIT EXPANDER, if possible.

  @{HI "2-HIT EXPANDER"}
    This will expand at the edges to 1-HIT EXPANDER, if possible.

  @{HI "1-HIT EXPANDER"}
    This will expand at the edges to a normal block, the white one,
    if possible.

  @{HI "NORMAL BLOCKS"}
    Just hit these blocks once and they disappear. The colours are
    just to make the level friendlier. But you just have white blocks
    in your own level set if you want.

  @{HI "BIG BLOCKS"}
    This blocks splits into 2 normal blocks of the same colour.

  @{HI "LARGE BLOCKS"}
    This blocks splits into 2 big blocks of the same colour.

  @{HI "WALL BLOCKS"}
    Can't be destroyed, can't be removed and finally you also can't
    move though it. Just walls !!! Be careful at diagonal walls.

  @{HI "WALL BLOCKS WITH PIPES"}
    Can't be destroyed and removed either, but if your ball hits the
    pipes entrance it will go through. The ball speed and entry angle
    will stay the same at the exit !!! On the T-crossings the ball
    randomly chooses a direction.

  @{HI "JACKPOT FIELDS"}
    On some levels there are 8 to 16 jackpot fields. Lock balls in all
    fields and you win the jackpot score. Not every ball will lock if
    you hit a field. Instead the jackpot score grows and the ball will
    be released after a short time. When you win the jackpot score all
    balls are released and the ball storage entry soaks in balls for
    30 seconds.

@endnode
@node BONUSITEMS "Arkanos V3.0 - Bonus Items"

  Every bonus item counts 10 points. Every 50 levels, so after you
  have played a complete level-set, you get less good items, but more
  bad items. The symbol '-' after the bonus items here are bad items.
  The symbol '+' after the items here are good ones.
  And from level 101 to 200 the bonus tiles will be hidden in the
  upper part of the level area. So you've just a second to look at
  it and decide to take or not. THINK QUICK!

  @{HI "GET KILLED"}  -
    You loose the current paddle. But get 40 points, instead of 10!
    The balls stay on the level and continue moving when the new
    paddle appears.

  @{HI "SCORE DOWN"}  -
    This bonus decreases your points by about 200 to 400.

  @{HI "SCORE UP"}  +
    This bonus increases your points by about 100 to 400.

  @{HI "SLOW BALL"}   +
    Decreases ball speed by 4. You need more SLOW BALL if the speed is
    about 20 or higher for a better playing speed. Minimum speed is 4.

  @{HI "RESTART LEVEL"}  -
    Re-initialize the current level. If there are only a few special
    blocks is a good choice to take it. Otherwise your balls may be
    trapped, or it is hard to hit some blocks. Bonus levels can't be
    restarted, but you get 200 points, instead of just 10.

  @{HI "SHRINK PADDLE"}  -
    This bonus decreases your paddle size by one. You loose 16 pixels
    to catch the ball. Minimum size is 1. It's very hard to get the
    ball with that short paddle.

  @{HI "EXPAND PADDLE"}  +
    This bonus increases your paddle size by one. This means 16 pixels
    extra space to get the ball. Maximum size is 8, so your paddle is
    at the most 128 pixels large. This is about half of the total
    level width. This could become a big problem.

  @{HI "CATCH BALL"}  +
    This bonus activates the catch field on your paddle. This is the flashing
    line at the top of your paddle. Click the left mouse button to
    release all balls. If you take this bonus twice, the catch field
    will be deactivated.

  @{HI "BREAKTHROUGH"}  +
    If you take this bonus the balls will move through all blocks,
    except the SHORT CUT and WALLS. But I must warn you: If there are
    many BALL SPEED UP blocks, the balls will .. .  .   .    .  AWAY!
    But it's very useful with many SCORE UP blocks. Take this bonus
    again, and the balls behave normal.

  @{HI "SPLIT BALL"}  +
    This item splits free moving balls. If you play with one ball it
    will split into three balls. If you play with more balls each
    ball will split in two balls. In the best case you need four items
    to reach the ball limit. (1->3->6->12->16)
    Balls are not free, if they are in a SHORT-CUT, in a WALL PIPE,
    trapped in a JACKPOT FIELD or catched on the paddle! If you see
    a ball that doesn't split the ball limit has been reached.

  @{HI "LASER PADDLE"}  +
    This bonus activates the lasers on your paddle. The paddle will
    change. Use left mouse button to fire laser. Don't fire them too
    often. Every mouse click resets your laser, even if you didn't
    hit anything. Remember this if you want to fire at blocks on the
    top of the level.
    You can never shoot walls, but very effective with BREAKTHROUGH
    bonus. But blocks hit with the laser don't drop bonus items and
    count 8 points only! If you already have a laser paddle, the
    laser will be deactivated.

  @{HI "SCORE JACKPOT"}  +
    If there are JACKPOT FIELDS you get 1 percent of the current
    jackpot score, otherwise only the 10 points for the item.

  @{HI "ZAP EXPANDER"}  -
    This removes all expanding blocks on the level. Warning: Expanding
    blocks can be used to break through INDESTRUCT blocks, and if you
    remove them... 8-)

  @{HI "ZAP SPECIAL"}  +
    This removes all special blocks: SCORE UP, SCORE DOWN, BALL SPEED
    UP, BALL SPEED DOWN, RANDOM DIRECTION and MOVING BLOCK. If there
    are only SCORE UP blocks, don't take it. Otherwise think quickly
    if you want to remove those blocks.

  @{HI "ZAP INDESTRUCT"}  +
    This removes all indestructible attributes of the level. This
    means: INDESTRUCT will be removed completely, 1-HIT INDESTRUCT
    will be replaced by a normal block (the red one) and 5, 4, 3,
    2-HIT BLOCKS will also be replaced by a normal block (the grey
    one). BIG and LARGE blocks change to normal block of their colour.

  @{HI "MORE DYNAMITE"}  +
    Expand all exploding blocks, one the each side: up, down, left
    and right. But remember: exploding blocks only count 8 points.
    Nevertheless it's a very effective way to complete a level. BIG
    and LARGE blocks will not change. WALLS are also not affected.

  The following 10 items are timed. You see the corresponding timers
  on the information screen. Each time you take one of these items the
  value of the @{I}BONUSTIMER @{UI}is added. The @{I}BONUSTIMER @{UI}starts at 10 seconds,
  this is the minimum value. You can -- and you really should --
  increase the timer.

  @{HI "GRAVITY"}  -
    This actives the gravity field at the bottom of the screen. The
    field starts approximately in the middle of the level. It reduces
    the ball speed by 2, but minimum speed is 4. The timer uses slot 1,
    the left most one right next to you money. You cannot have GRAVITY
    and MAGNETISM at the same time.

  @{HI "MAGNETISM"}  -
    Actives the magnetic field at the bottom of the screen so that
    the ball is deflected to the side edges. It starts approximately
    in the middle of the level. It reduces the ball speed by 2, but
    minimum speed is 4. The timer uses slot 1, the left most one
    right next to you money. You cannot have GRAVITY and MAGNETISM
    at the same time.

  @{HI "FOLLOW BALLS"}  -
    Your paddle will automatically follow the lowest ball in the lower
    part of the level area. If all balls are in the upper area you can
    move the paddle. Don't trust on this bonus too much if you play
    with multiple balls. The automatic system is somehow slow and may
    loose a ball, especially if there are balls nearly at the same
    horizontal line. Warning: You may be forced to take bonus items
    you don't want to have and you may loose bonus items you would
    like to collect. This bonus uses timer slot 2.

  @{HI "GUARD"}  +
    Activate a bottom wall to close the level. No balls can fall down
    now. And bonus items are also trapped! They stay on the wall for
    five seconds, and then they explode. A quite good bonus, except
    you have an ATTRACT type bonus. Shit!!! This bonus uses timer
    slot 3.

  @{HI "NIGHT"}  -
    This darkens the level down. It's harder to play, so you get 2
    extra points for all block hits. You see the timer in slot
    number 4.

  @{HI "EXPLODE BALL"}  +
    A good helper, especially with lot's of indestruct blocks. Your
    balls became deadly explosives. All blocks you hit now explode
    like dynamite blocks. Luckily you have a very robust paddle! But
    remember that exploding blocks only count 8 points. This bonus
    use timer slot number 5.

  @{HI "ATTRACT BAD"}  -
    This is a quite annoying bonus. All bad items will move to you
    paddle. Dangerous with the GUARD bonus !!! This bonus uses timer
    slot number 6.

  @{HI "ATTRACT GOOD"}  +
    This helps you to collect good bonus items. All diamonds and
    letters are good items too. This could be annoying if you're just
    missing one diamond or letter, but get the wrong one! You see
    this timer in slot 7.

  @{HI "SCORE×2"}  +
    All your points are doubled! This includes collecting bonus items,
    diamonds and bonus letters. You see this timer in slot number 8,
    the right most one. You cannot have SCORE×2 and SCORE×5 at the
    same time!

  @{HI "SCORE×5"}  +
    It's like the SCORE×2 above, but points counts five times. It
    uses timer slot number 8 too. You cannot have SCORE×2 and SCORE×5
    at the same time!

  Now the remaining normal bonus items follow. They are more valueable
  and appear less often than the previous ones.

  @{HI "REDUCE BONUSTIMER"}  -
    Reduces the @{I}BONUSTIMER @{UI}by one second. Minimum is 10 seconds. Avoid
    this item if possible!

  @{HI "INCREASE BONUSTIMER"}  +
    This increases the @{I}BONUSTIMER @{UI}by two seconds. Always take it!

  @{HI "BONUS LEVEL MULTIPLIER"}  +
    Increase the bonus level multiplier by one. Wait some time to
    collect all BONUS letter and collect more of these items. You can
    score much more points.

  @{HI "FINISH LEVEL"}  +
    This brings you to the next level straight away. No need to shoot
    the balls back to the storage. Remember all the left points on
    the level before you take it. The next level may be harder. Think
    quickly, if it's worth. ;-)

  @{HI "EXTRA BALL"}  +
    You get a new ball on the paddle, where you catch this item, but
    only if there less than 16 balls on the level. Click the left
    mouse button to release the new ball.

  @{HI "EXTRA PADDLE"}  +
    Gives you an extra paddle, but removes all extras, like CATCH,
    LASER PADDLE and BREAKTHROUGH. Maybe these bonus items make it
    easier to solve the level. Think quickly, if you really need an
    extra paddle.

  Now the special items follow. Don't take all of them. If you already
  have one of these items you will loose it! And at the bottom some
  information about the coins.

  @{HI "BONUS DIAMONDS"}  +
    There are 8 different coloured bonus diamonds. If you catch all
    8 diamonds you get three extra balls and one paddle. One diamond
    counts 200 points. It's hard to let them fall down, but you will
    really need many balls and paddles on higher levels!  8-)

  @{HI "EXTRA LETTERS"}  +
    Collect the 5 letters E.X.T.R.A. and you can play a @{"memory game" link MEMORYGAME}.
    Each letter counts 100 points. See there for more information.

  @{HI "BONUS LETTERS"}  +
    Collect the 5 letters B.O.N.U.S. and you can play a @{"bonus level" link BONUSLEVEL}.
    As basic value you get 100 points. For each bonus multiplier you
    get 50 points more. So with multiplier 2 you get 150 points and,
    for example, with multiplier 6 you get 350 points.
    Hard to decide here: With multiplier 8 and SCORE×5 bonus you get
    incredible 2250 points! And if you already have this letter and
    only one is left, difficult...

  @{HI "COINS"}  +
    Sometimes also coins appear. The values are 10, 20, 50, 100, 200
    and 500. The lower values are more possible than the large values.
    With this money you can buy improvements in the @{"shop" link SHOP} after each
    level.

  on the level-set. It may have only one bonus level. All timed bonus
  items are cleared and the following upgrades are stored: paddle size,
  catch, laser and brickthrough.

  Then you play the bonus level like any other level. If you get the

          /|      |  |          |   \\        |     |
         / |  to  |  |    or    |    \\   to  |     |
        /__|      |__|          |_____\\      |_____|

  @{IT "REDUCE DIAGONAL WALLS"}    (1080)
    Replace all diagonal walls with the next smaller rectangular
    version.
    Examples: ___          __
             |   \\        |  |            /\\
             |    \\   to  |  |    or     /  \\   will be removed
             |_____\\      |__|          /____\\

  @{IT "SPEEDLIMIT"}    (840)
    Normally the maximum ball speed is 36. This halves the maximum
    ball speed to 18. Hold for the following level.

  @{IT "DOUBLE SCORE"}    (1200)
    This doubles all scores on the next level. Use it for full levels
    with lots of blocks.

  @{IT "EXTRA BALL"}    (220)
    Add an extra ball. Always have an eye on the ball storage. On
    some levels you need to lock 16 balls to win the jackpot score.

  @{IT "EXTRA PADDLE"}    (1440)
    Hmmm, guess? Right! An extra paddle if you have so much money.
    But think about the bonus points at the end of the game!

  If you have not enough money you can sell paddles for half of the
  buying price. The price will fall a little bit.

  Sometimes the shop may be closed! Instead you can enter a memory
  game to win upgrades, points and money.

@node SAVETOKENS "Arkanos V3.0 - All about save tokens"

  In version 2.0 I noticed that saving after each level can be used to
  maximize you score and paddles. After you have finished a level you
  save the game. If playing the next level is not as good as you would
  like it to be, you press the <ESC> key and reload the game until you
  get the desired bonus items. Then you save the game and repeat this
  procedure.

@{B}THAT WAS NOT THE INTENDED PHILOSOPHY !!!!@{UB}
@{JLEFT}
  That's why I've added the save-tokens in version 2.1. Now you need
  one save-token to save the current game. You get a save-token
    (1) every 5 levels,
    (2) buy it in the shop, or
    (3) if you have cleared a bonus level.

  The "SAVE-RELOAD"-method is now more difficult to play and should
  not be used anymore. And don't try to hack the save file.
  You will FAIL!!! (I know that this is an unwanted invitation to
  do it, but I don't care. It's you spare time you're wasting!)

       but therefore I excluded the editor, which is still shareware
    *) correct file selector for loading other level sets; used wrong

@node MYGAMES "What other game did I create ?"

  The following games from me can be found in Aminet:

  *) Starbase V1.2 (SHAREWARE)
     This is a simple Utopia-Clone. Build up your star base on a
     foreign planet and defeat you computer neighbours.

  *) Diamond Challenge V1.3 (FREEWARE)
     Nice platform game. Solve levels by collecting all diamonds.
     Enemies and different make things harder! With editor.

  *) Colonization Map Editor V1.0 (GIFTWARE)
     For all "Colonization" fans: a map editor you can use to improve
     a map. In my opinion MICROprose didn't create a random map
     generator. Instead they are just mixing some predefined land
     masses together and determine terrain type and place indians.

@endnode
@node KNOWN_BUGS "What's wrong with the game ?"

  No strange things happend while play-testing the game, but if you
  find something, please let me know. If it is possible (game not
  crashed) use the F4 key to generate a debug output and send me the
  files from the "Debug" folder. A save game is also very useful.
  Please answer the following questions with your report:

   - Does the game quit with an error message? If so, please write it
     down and try to explain WHEN this happens. WHAT did you do before?

   - Does the game behave strange? Maybe incorrect, not like above !!!

   - Is it a memory problem? (Then I need your configuration.)

   - Did the program completely refuse to load? (Missing files.)

   - Is the game too slow, no smooth moving? (Configuation, please.)

   - Did Mr. GURU visit you? (Oh, dear. Did you read the @{"legal stuff" link LEGAL}?)
     Write down the first 8 hex digits and contact @{"me" link INFOS}.

  Hitting block corners:  NO BUG !!!

    It's not difficult to explain what really happens. Every physics
    teacher can tell you about that. But the details are very complex,
    because physical factors determine how the ball will continue his
    way. For this game it would be too difficult to add all factors.
    So I decided to reflect balls like diagonal walls or to ignore it.

  Ball is trapped in a wall block:  GREAT BUG !!!

    This should never happen. But with BREAKTHROUGH bonus item the
    balls could move inside special blocks that are surrounded by
    walls. Now you deactivate brickthrough with another bonus item.
    Where should the balls inside the blocks now move to?
    Just wait some seconds and the ball will be repositioned on your
    paddle and the speed will be reduced to 8 if neccessary. A debug
    output doesn't help me, because I need to know how the ball could
    get into the wall. If it's already there it's too late!
