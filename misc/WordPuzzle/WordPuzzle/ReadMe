       ********* Word Puzzle Instructions ************ 

The object of the game is to find a word in a puzzle arrangement. 
There are three versions of the game on this disk: 

1.  There are thirty different game title selections.  Each game title
    has nineteen associated words.  The words are shown on the right
    side of the screen and are also shown in a puzzle arrangement.
    The words can be spelled foward, backward, up, down, or diagonally.
    The user selects a word by clicking the left mouse on the orange
    circle adjacent to the desired word.  The user then clicks the left
    mouse on a letter in the puzzle which matches the first letter of the
    selected word.  The user repeats the process for each consecutive
    letter of the word.  All letters must be in a straight line.  If a
    mistake is made, the selected word can be reselected by clicking the
    left mouse on the orange circle adjacent to ' Restart Letter Selection '.
    After all words have been located and solved, a new game process begins.

2.  This game version is the same as the above, except only the first
    letter of the words are shown.  It adds a bit of challenge to the game.

3.  A single word is randomally selected and located in the puzzle.  All
    other puzzle letters are randomally selected and located.  The game
    process is the same as the above versions but more challenging.
    If the user wants to transfer the game to another disk, all files in
    the Word Puzzle directory need to be transferred since the other
    files are game titles.
