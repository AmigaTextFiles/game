** OFFICIAL DESCRIPTION OF CEPHALOTRON 2 **

CephaloTron 2 is Pete W Storonskij's combined Tron-Artillery game.  You play Light Cycles, but with ultimate weapons!  It has the WeaponForge stacking system that lets you stack up to 12 warheads in one Torpedeux.  You can construct your Torpedeux exactly to your taste with 380 warheads of 50 types to choose from.  This makes for an infinite combination of ultimately overpowered weapon designs.  All 30 players have 5 of their own custom weapons and automatic shields, as well as 3 gears to shift into during play.  You can make Lava Storms, Airstrikes, and Centillions upon Centillions of other weaons.

All conditions of CephaloTron 1 still apply.

*** MY NEXT GAME: ***

Under construction in Pete W Storonskij's top secret development center, codenamed "THE TRANSDIMENSIONAL SHIPYARD!" (TM), is a new video game that I am working on.  This awesome new game is designed on my new 360 degree Liquid-Axle-3D (TM) algorithm.  It is smooth to the touch and most importantly, it's a Mouse-driven algorithm!
I would like to divulge more on this awesome game, but I will be releasing it soon enough.  This new game is easily going to be my new flagship game, outdoing Stratoplex in every sphere of interest!

** BACK TO CEPHALO TRON 2 **

The best feature of Cephalotron 2 is it's configurability.  A prime example of this is the WeaponForge system.  You can design any weapon you want by stacking 12 warheads in a single Torpedeux.

You can have 5 different weapon stacks per player.  Weapons are armed by the function keys, and launched with the fire button.  The arming codes F1-F5 are for player 1, and F6-F10 are for player 2.

*** WEAPONFORGE CONSTRUCTION FACILITY ***

WeaponForge is a weapon construction engine, as it lets you build an infinite arsenal of ultimately over-powered weapons.  There are 50 warhead types with 380 actual warheads to choose from.

   The WeaponForge system allows you to stack any 12 warheads in one "Torpedeux" for use in the game, this allows you to make just about any weapon that you can think of.  You can even link some of the warheads together, and have them fire each other.

You have the options to wipe a weapon clear, or to create random weapons.  You also have 100 storage slots to save all of your favorite weapon designs.  You can then sprinkle these weapons into the regular weapon slots, so you have a random arsenal of predesigned weapons.

*** WEAPONS MANIFEST ***

Here is an explanation of the 50 warhead types to choose from, to construct a Torpedeux with 12 stacked warheads.

Most of the 50 warhead types have at least 10 power settings.  When this is taken into account, you get a total of 380 warheads!

** STANDARD WARHEADS **

TERRAIN 1-10
This puts a big round obstical on the screen at the impact point.  Terrain has a range of 10 sizes and the largest one is just way too big.  It lets you clutter the screen with terrain and to block off pathways.

EXPLOSION 1-10
Explosions destroy a concentrated area of the screen, and damage players in the blast radius.  There are 10 explosion sizes, and the largest one is reminiscent of the "Damn Yeah!" weapon in SAH.

DONUT EXPLOSION 1-10
This explosion type is shaped like a donut, since the center of it is open.  You can build Nova waves that expand outward from your ship's location for a short range devastator weapon.

CLEAR OUT 1-10
Clearouts only destroy pixels and do no damage to players, but are otherwise the same as explosions.  There are 10 sizes for this weapon, and the largest one erases a gigantic area of the screen.

LAVA 1-20
Unleashes a cascading flood of lava at the point of detonation.  Lava carries the momentum of the Torpedeux that fired it, and therefore goes in a preferred direction.  Walls can contain the spread of lava, but lava can destroy players.  Lava can be used to seal entrances to tunnels.  The power level affects the amount of lava dumped on the screen.  There are now 20 levels of lava.

ACID 1-20
This is the exact opposite of lava (and the same code drives both warheads), since the acid removes walls from the screen.  Acid is harmless to players.  The power affects the duration of the weapon.

DRONES 1-10
This acts like lava, only you have direct control over it's direction of motion.  This lets you create "deadly doubles" of yourself to block passageways and to confuse other players.  
 
LASER 1-10
Lasers are extermely powerful at full power, as the width of the weapon is determined by the power setting.  The laser cuts through everything except for the outer wall.  This lets you drill out of tight spots, make paths for yourself and your weapons, and shoot other players too.

LASER SPLINE 1-2
This combines the steering heat seeker with a laser spline trail, making a wild lightning bolt.  The power option sets a thick or a thin beam.

*** WEAPON SPLITTERS ***

SIDE SPLIT (2)
This weapon splits the Torpedeux in half and sends the parts off to the sides.  The warheads in each one are duplicated, yielding 2 identical Torpedeux weapons of equal power, travelling in opposite directions. 

TRI-SPLIT (3)
Tri-Split is a weapon splitter that sends off two identical Torpedeux weapons perpendicular to the main Torpedeux, as well as the first torpedeux, that continues forward.  All information is copied to the new weapons, including the exact state of the first weapon.

V-SPREAD (7) 1-10
This one laterally spreads the weapon into 7 identical warheads that all face the same direction.  This lets you sweep the area in front of your ship.  The power setting affects the weapon's lateral spreading.

MIRV (8)
The mirv weapon sends out 8 equally powerful Torpedeux weapons in all directions, with the same attributes as the original Torpedeux.

SUN BURST (15)
The sunburst spreads 15 weapons in all directions, each with the same attributes as the original.  This is the most powerful splinter weapon there is.

*** SEEKING WEAPONS ***

HEAT SEEKER
This delivery system relentlessly engages the closest player to its position (but not the player who launched the weapon).  This weapon turns on a dime, and is really difficult to evade.  It's deadly accurate and hard to avoid, even with a teleport!

STEERING SEEKER 1-10
This heat seeker makes wide turns, like the homing missiles on that old video game, Time Pilot.  The power setting affects it's ability to change direction, allowing you to have really wide turning heat seekers.  This weapon is for people that think the other heat seeker is too unrealistic for their taste.

WEAPON SEEKER 1-10
The weapon seeker will relentlessly seek out enemy warheads.  This is useful in stopping enemy heat seekers, as the weapon seeker travels at twice the speed of all the other warheads, allowing it to catch up from behind.

** TELEPORTS **

TELEPORT PLAYER
This teleport marks a trail for you to follow to your new destination.  If you have a powerful weapon, you may want to get away from ground zero, or have an airstrike while you are safely tucked away in teleport mode :)

TELEPORT WEAPON
This teleports the weapon to a random location, allowing you to destroy targets anywhere.  It is considered a delivery system since it does no damage on it's own and doesn't affect the screen.  This weapon is perfect for creating airstrikes.

DISLOCATE 1-10
This is a very low power weapon teleporter.  It only teleports weapons 2-20 pixels away from their previous location, allowing you to create cloud type dispersal patterns.

RECALL WEAPON
This resets the weapon's position to the player's coordinates.  This can be used to center effects directly on your vehicle that require an exact fit to work properly.  It can also be used to create weird weapons.

SPACING 1-10
This moves the weapon forward from 2 to 20 pixels.  It is like a forward teleporter that makes flame-throwers possible.  It can also be used to jump over thickly laden trails and to skip like a stone over deadly lava pools.

** DIRECTION CHANGERS **

DEFLECT
This lets you change the weapon's direction to one side, causing the path of the Torpedeux to be less predictable.

REVERSE
This bounces the weapon back the way it came, letting you make weapons that criss-cross around the playing field.  Be careful because a weapon that you fire can come back to damage your player.

ALIGN
This sets the weapon's direction to the same as the player who launched it.  This allows you to direct lots of weapons in one direction to sweep across the field.  This can also be used to give you more direct control of the weapon.

** OBSTICALS **

TRAP SQUARE 1-10
This sets up a square around a target, letting you catch enemy players and build forts.  The power affects the size of the square.

DIAGONALS 1-10
This places an "X" on the screen where the weapon is activated.  They make good obsticals to litter the screen with.  The power affects the size of the "X".

LATERALS 1-10
This places two parallel lines on the screen, parallel to the direction the weapon travels at.  This is good for containing lava, or blocking players trying to cut you off.  The power affects the size.

SCATTER GLOB 1-10
A gaussian pixel storm will be invoked on the detonation site (lots of pixels will be littered around the impact).  It might be useful as an obstical, or impressionist painting.  The power sets the storm radius.

** DIRECTIVES **

ACTIVATE WEAPON 1-5
If you don't like to switch weapons with the function keys, then just put this in your weapons.  You can make a weapon with alternating effects, like laser sweeps and heat seeker swarms.  You can even switch between all 5 of them automatically.

LIQUID VELOCITY 1-10
This multiplies your vehicle's speed by quite a bit, while retaining your vehicle's 3 gears so you still have control over your ship's relative velocity.  The power setting affects how long the warp capability lasts.

** SPECIAL EFFECTS **

FLASH SCREEN 1-15
This does absolutely nothing but flash the screen to the brightness that you want.  It is only for effect, like making airstrikes seem more destructive and distracting human players.

SHAKE SCREEN 1-20
Again, this does absolutely nothing but shake the screen.  This is useful in bothering humans and making you actually FEEL a weapon's effects.


   *** ADDITIONS FOR CEPHALO TRON 2 ***


4 WAY SPLIT (4)
This splits the weapon 4 ways, each with equal power to the original warhead.

SHRAPNEL 1-10
This explodes matter in all directions, making for an awesome (and sometimes deadly) special effect.

RANDOM 1-10
This picks a random warhead from the set of 50, making the weapon completely unpredictable.

RAY SPREAD 1-10
This puts a big, pointy obstical in the place where it is detonated.

WEAPON WARP 1-10
This speeds up the weapon by a factor of 10, making it spread across the screen almost instantly, which is useful for making continouos flame-throwers.  This only lasts for 20 game cycles.

LASER WAVE 1-10
This fires lasers out of the sides of the Torpedeux, making it possible to create laser sweeps.

STAR SPREAD (5)
This launches 5 warheads in a star pattern, each with the original warhead's full strength backing it up.

LANDMINES 1-10
This puts a landmine on the screen where it is activated.  The landmine will detonate if it is hit with weapons or players.  It will also detonate if 100 game cycles pass without detonating the mine.

AUTO DISLOCATE 1-10
This sets up an automatic dispersal pattern that lasts for 20 game cycles.  This is useful for creating landmine fields.

FLOAT MINES 1-10
Floating mines will wiggle about until they hit something, or when 100 game cycles pass.

HUNTER MINES 1-10
These homing landmines will target the closest player and relentlessly pursue them until the mine hits something or when 100 game cycles pass, when the mine auto-detonates.

SPREAD (P) 1-7
This spreads warheads in a fan-like arc, and the number of Torpedeux weapons it splits into are 2P+1, all of equal strength to the original warhead.

PILE DRIVER (P) 1-10
This launches warheads in a forward direction, offset ahead the original Torpedeux weapon.  It splits into P+1 warheads of equal strength to the original warhead.

AUTO RECALL 1-10
This centers the warhead directly on the player for 20 game cycles.  It is useful for shield weapons that must be centered exactly.

AUTO TELEPORT 1-10
This jumps the weapon all around the screen for 20 game cycles.  It is useful for much stronger airstrikes and minefields.

SHRAPNEL WAVE 1-10  
This sprays matter in a forward direction, causing a path of destruction that clears away anything in it's way.

FIRE WEAPON 1-5
This fires one of your 5 weapons that you made.  It is useful for combining the strength of all 5 weapons in 1 enormous destructive strike.  It is also useful for recursive weapons, and ones that go on and on.

***

** 5 WEAPONS PER PLAYER **

Each player can have their own set of 5 custom weapons.  This lets you have fun designing weapons.  Having 5 weapons gives you the ultimate power and diversity of weapon types.  You can have 5 small weapons, 5 big weapons, or a range of weapons to fit any situation.  Making 5 overpowered weapons might end the round quickly, but if that is what you want to do, then go ahead.

** STACKING WEAPONS **

You can combine the weapons by stacking them.  This lets you draw on the strong points of every weapon, delivery system, and directive, creating a nearly infinite array of weapon designs.  You get to stack 12 warheads on top of one another, thus letting you create very complex weapons of original designs.

** LINKING WARHEADS **

Linking warheads together lets you activate more than one warhead at a time, or to detonate the entire thing at once, instead of just doing pile-driver type weapons.

You can link the entire weapon if you want to, or just parts of it.  This lets you invoke the effects of the weapon immediately, so you don't have to wait until it hits a target.

** SOUND CONFIGURATION SYSTEM **

It is important to "feel" the brunt of a weapon when it destroys half the screen.  I made a fully configurable sound system to augment the fully configurable weapons creation system.

Most of Cephalotron 2's sounds were created with my Liquid Thunder Sound Creator.  But what's truely awesome is the fact that you can connect sounds to your weapons to make them sound EXACTLY the way you want them to.

Each warhead in the stack of 12 can have it's own individual sound attached to it.  You can also have no sounds at all in a weapon, just in case you want it that way.  There are 32 sounds, so you have lots of options.  You can even preview each sound so you know exactly what your weapon will sound like before you play.

** OTHER FEATURES OF CEPHALOTRON 2 **

You can disable the most annoying warheads, like the shake screen and the flash screen.  You can disable any warhead that you don't like.  You can partially disable any warheads as well.

You can save the best 100 weapons in a special storage area.

There is a special Weapon Options Screen that lets you manipulate the weapons more effectively.  You can copy 1 weapon to 1 weapon slot for every player, giving a fair arsenal of the same weapon to every player.

The function keys switch weapons, allowing player 1 to have 5 weapons armed by the left half of the function keys, and player 2 to have 5 different weapons, armed with the second set of function keys!  All weapons are launched with the fire button of that player.

Fully configurable sounds.  You can connect any sound to any weapon detonation, so you have ultimate control over how your weapons sound.

Several different terrain types: Spheres, Circles, Squares, Lines, and Pixels.  There is also an option to Auto-Cycle the terrain.

The outer walls of the playing field can have 3 different effects on players when they intersect it: Destruction, Wrap, or Teleport.

The trails slowly vanish when a player dies.

There is my spinning logo effect to start off each round.

You can select the pattern of starting positions for the players too (including random scattering of players).

All players get Automatic Shields.

All players independently get 3 gears of motion. Push the joystick toward the direction of motion to speed up, and pull back to slow down.

The options can be saved to disk, including all 150 weapon designs.  150 Random Weapons can be created in a second.

You can fire every weapon that you want, when you want to fire that weapon.

There is also AMMO, so you can limit the firepower if infinite arsenals are against your beliefs.

** Cephalotron 2'S KEYBOARD FUNCTIONS **

Cephalotron 2 is a joystick powered game, but there are a few keyboard directives as well.

      KEYBOARD FUNCTIONS DURING PLAY
F1-F5 control player 1's weapons arming mechanism.
F6-F10 control player 2's weapons arming mechanism.
ESC brings you back to the Main Control Panel.
SPACE ends the current round and sets up the next if so.

   KEYBOARD FUNCTIONS IN THE CONTROL PANEL
SPACE adjusts the weapon construction fields.

DEL edits the weapon design by deleting a warhead from the middle, where the cursor is.
HELP will insert a space between two warheads, which is the opposite of DEL.
The CURSOR KEYS acts like the joystick controls, but are magnified by 5.

** STRATOPLEX: 3D TRON **

Stratoplex: 3D Tron is my previous release, and also (temporarily) my flagship video game for my games armada.  It's on Aminet NOW, in game/2play!

Stratoplex has 3D LightCycles, 3D MCP Cone, 3D Mazes, 3D Asteroids, Strategema, Weapon Modulation, and Shield Configuration sequences.  Tornadeux Drones, Lightning, Thunder, and Fog augment the 3D first person landscape view, letting you experience liquid velocity first hand.

** QUICK DESCRIPTIONS OF MY GAMES **

   CONUNDRUM is my original abstract hexagon based puzzle board
game, where the object is to negate all of the colored tiles by 
placing them next to each other.  Conundrum is very simple to
play and highly addictive for any puzzle gamer.

   The ARMORED COMBAT EDITION of MANGLED FENDERS lets you
stock up on essential ammo and blast your way to victory with
your choice of 6 battle tanks from various countries.  The fire
button releases barrages of powerful munitions against enemy
targets that lie in your path.

   INCINERATOR is my 3D missile attack/defend game, where you defend your city from the enemy's missiles and helicopters, with your laser cannons, forcefields, and super bombs.  Every other round, you get to pulverize the enemy city, with missiles of your own.

   Castle Incinerator is a graphics rewrite of Incinerator, with castles instead of cities, and horses instead of missiles.  The graphics are the only real change, but WOW, they are so awesome.  It was fun rewriting the docs for it.

   Checkers Conquest is a checkers game with lots of features, and has intelligent computer opponents.  There are lots of options, including changing the board layout, and showing possible threatened positions.

   The New Version of Checkers Conquest has another level of
computer intelligence, a standard numbered game board, and new
options like Lightning Fast play and a new rule option. 

   My awesome original has a new swath of power in the new
version, CONUNDRUM 2.  It has 20 new bonus round puzzles, as
well as several new "Super Tiles".  Super Tiles enclude a Wipe
Tile to destroy the grey matter, and Super Drain Tiles that
drain color from all of the tiles on the board.  The second
"ready" position, lets you choose between two different tiles to
place on the board.  You can also play just the 20 bonus rounds.

STRATOPLEX: 3D TRON: Lightning Fury is my 3D Tron game with 7 sequences.  It has 3D Light Cycles, 3D Asteroids, 3D MCP Cone, 3D Tank Maze, Strategema, Weapon Modulation, and Shield Configuration sequences.
