Welcome to AGAVoxel (bugfix)!
-----------------------------


Why (bugfix)?
-------------
Hmmm... sorry, folks!
We checked for AGA by testing the hardware-regs (like shown in a
german magazine) and this happened to be the wrong way. Many
AGAnoids have been told they ain't, what a shame!
Let us see what the actual routine does?!


What is AGAVoxel?
-----------------
AGAVoxel is one of those so called "VoxelEngines" which
let you move through a 3D-fractal-landscape-with-shadows-
in-256-colors.


How to use AGAVoxel?
--------------------
Just start the program like any other program (it doesn앖 bite!),
select your preferred screenmode (the screensize will always be
320 x 200 x 8), wait for short initialisation, use your joystick
to move around in the landscape and ENJOY!
To quit AGAVoxel press joybutton. There will be some information
(time used, number of frames rendered, frames-per-second) on the
screen.


System requirements
-------------------
AGAVoxel will (hopefully) run on any 1200 or 4000 with or without 
fastmem. We didn앖 test AGAVoxel on gfxboards but don앖 expect it
to work on (sorry jow).


Some technical details
----------------------
AGAVoxel is written in AmigaE V3.0 (thanx to Wouter for his
EXCELLENT compiler), due to this it압 extremely compact; the
10k program contains all the landscape rendering, lightning,
look-up initialisation and two different chunky2planar routines
(fastmem / no fastmem). On runtime AGAVoxel uses about 1 Meg of 
memory and stops multitasking, sorry!

The landscape is based on a standard (hurst)plasma-algorithm
which produces a periodic 256x256 array (bet you won앖 find the
edge, will you?).

We tested AGAVoxel on different configurations, and here are
the results of the international jury :-)
Standard A1200  14MHz 020, no fast ... about 10 fps
         A1200  14MHz 020,  4 fast ... about 15 fps
Blizzard  1220  28MHz 020,  4 fast ... about 30 fps
         A4000  25MHz 040,  4 fast ... about 35 fps
Blizzard 1230I  40MHz 030,  4 fast ... about 42 fps

and the winner is...
Blizzard 1230II 50MHz 030,  4 fast ......... 53 fps!

  thanx Row and Manfred M.!


If there압 one of those lucky Cyberstorm/060-dudes reading this,
please please please mail us your fps!

THE CONTEST IS STILL OPEN!!!

Future
------
yes - but what will it be for AGAVoxel? hmmm.....
We finished the engine, but now we are out of ideas!
Then we bugfixed the engine and still lack ideas...
Will it be a game?
A wordprocessor?
A pentium emulator? Ooops, FDIV works... too bad!
Will it morph into a big green slimy whatever?
We really don앖 know!
If you have any other ideas what it might become -> MAIL US!
