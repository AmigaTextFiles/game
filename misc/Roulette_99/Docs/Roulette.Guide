3. How the game works.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   When the game first starts, you are looking at the playfield (on the left)
   and some self explaining stuff on the right.

   On top of the playfield you'll read "Press space when done"

   If you do not select a coin defaults to $1000

   By pressing F1 you select $   10,= which is shown on the bottom right.
      pressing F2 selects    $   20,=
      pressing F3 selects    $   50,=
      pressing F4 selects    $  100,=
      pressing F5 selects    $  250,=
      pressing F6 selects    $ 1000,=
      pressing F7 selects    $ 5000,=

   Use the mouse pointer, which is shaped as a hand of the croupier, by pointing his finger
   on the location of youre choise. Then press the left mouse button to drop the coin.
   The coin you selected with the F key is now shown on the location of youre choise.
   On the right side a message apears telling you what location you choose.
   You can bet about 40 coins per game (40 x $ 5000,= is more then most of us will spend in a casino)
   If you reached 40 coins a message apears" No more Bets please."

   Now on top of the playfield you will read "press Spacebar when done".
   By pressing the spacebar (or press Right and Left mouse button simultaniously-
   so you can play without keyboard-)
   the croupier will start the game and a number apears in the large vertical
   window. The croupier automaticaly pays or will shoot the wrong coins off the table.
   Press F10 for a new game.Or press RightMouseButton(RMB)
   Press 'U' for undo.
   Press 'S' if you don't want the SoundFX. In the 'Croupier window' a Sound on/off
   message apears shortly.
   Press 'C' to turn on/off coin in hand of croupier.
   Press 'Help' for....help!
   Press Esc to end Roulette '98
   Press 'V' to turn On/Off Voices exept rolling ball sound.
   Press 'D' to see NumberDataBase.
   By pressing key '2' you will save the amount of money you've got( Might be usefull when
   testing a system?)
   By pressing key '1' you will restore the previously saved amount of money.

   Hold left mouse button during startup to skip the intro.

2. What does it do and why ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Its a 90 % accurate French roulette game, based on the dutch version.
   I once went to a real casino to try my luck on the french roulette table with
   about £ 50. After only ten minutes (!!!!)I was broke and wend desilusioned back home.
   I then decided first to learn more about french roulette before I would try this again.
   I looked all over the place, in PD, commercial roulette games,
   but all I ever found were games in which you only could bet one coin. So I decided to create
   my own game. And here it is. Almost the real thing..

     IN A REAL CASINO, WITH £ 50, IT NOW TAKES 8 MINUTES TO GO BROKE .....
     SO KIDS, ONLY TRY THIS AT HOME.....

  Even more realistic game play
  256 color display (Help is very welcome..)
  Conversion to c   (Help is very needed ..)
  Multi players.

10a.  Not to do
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  I don't think I will implement the spinning wheel thing, because it is quite difficult
  to programm and the result is very poor. I did give it a try- I rendered an 24bit
  animation in Lightwave, then rendered it back with adpro to 640x256x16- but the visual
  result is so poor that it wont be of any use. This whole thing started out as a
  utility rather than a game as I wanted to learn how to beat the casino. And there is
  absolutely no way to beat the casino.

If you would like me to continue or if you want the source, please send me a card.
Source is now included. Use it as you like, but I would appreciate my name mensioned
in future upgrades by you.
I'm trying to get the hang of C-programming, but I find it to be very difficult
(so far all I'm getting is "Hello World")

11. How to beat the casino!!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  There is absolutely no way to beat the casino!

  However there are some ways to cover a lot of number with a little coins
  and therefore increase your chances ?

  Press Shift F keys from a clean board and you will see some 'methods'.

  My favourites are Shift F2 and F3!!

  There is absolutely no way to beat the casino!

  Chances are always 50/50. Either you win or you lose.

  However, if you do know how to beat the casino, PLEASE LET ME NOW !!!!!

  Please don't ask for more systems to beat the casino.

  12.History
  ~~~~~~~~~~~

  Version 1.02

  First release.

  Version 1.2

  Hand of croupier apeared under coins already placed on table, because of
  priority of bobs. Just made bob number of hand highest number.

  Added more mouse functions. Right mouse button now equals F10 ( New game)
  Press RMB and LMB simultaniously to start the croupier
  Equals pressing spacebar. Now you can play without using keyboard.

  When no coin choise is made coin is set to 1000,=.
  Now properly shown in Bet window.

  Added option to show coin in hand of croupier, so you can actualy see
  what value of coin you're betting. Press 'C' for Coin shown On/Off

  Removed programming error which caused sometimes single bets (like red or black)
  to pay 35 x instead of 1 x.

  Removed bug that 'forgot' to show toptext " press Spacebar when done"

  Added "Help" option. Help now works with 'Help' key and 'H' key.

  Removed several minor errors and added minor improvements in layout.


  Version 1.21 (24-7-'99)

  Added one more macro under shift F6 (Covers about one side of the wheel)


  Version 1.22 (25-7-'99)

  Added option 'V'. Turns off all voices exept rolling ball
  Improved help screen under 'Help' key.

  Version 1.23 (31-7-'99)

  Added save/restore option for amount of playing money
  ( For methode testing -How to beat the casino-?)

  Version 1.24 (02-8-'99)

  Added Fading in/out on playfield.(Looks cool!)
  Added Help turn off with left mouse key( Feels more natural)
  Removed a bug that never showed!
  (Could pay money when you lost.)
  Cleaned up source and lost 10 Kb.
  Fixed a bug that caused deletion of white square
  around numbers when more than 50 coins where played
  Made number of that bob 60.

  Version 1.3 (08-08-'99)

  Added a screen for a Number Database. When 'D' is pushed a screen scrolls up
  containing all numbers and shows how many times each number has been drawn.
  This data base is automaticly loaded when the game is started and also saves
  automaticly when the game is ended. So every time the game is played every
  draw is recorded.I did this because I wanted to predict the next number
  based on the fact that one number has not been drawn a lot. Since its hard
  to code and this does absolutely not work.(In one try had not seen nr36 in
  a long time so I bet nr 36!...It took 126 draws before it came....).
  I don't think I will add this feature.

  Added yet another Macro under shift F7 (Covers all numbers and pays on Zero)

  Speeded up up/down scrolling of help and dbase screen.(took far to long)

   ~~~~~~~

  There seems to be an error every now and then with sound when first started.
  A sample keeps repeating.
  Since I cannot reproduce this error I have no clue what to do about it.
  The only solution so far is, press escape and start the game again.
  Then you will have no problems anymore.
  Seems to happen only with kick 3.0 ?
  I have got kick 3.1 and no problems.

  If you find other bugs please let me know
