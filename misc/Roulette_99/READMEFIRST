               How to install.
Copy asyncio.library to Libs:

Copy all dirs and files in a directory.
E.g copy Sounfx to Work:games/Roulette'99
and so with all other dirs and files.

Make an assign for 'casino' in s/user-startup

Open s/userstartup in your editor (I use Golded)
type:

Assign casino: Work:Games/Roulette'99

Where Roulette'99 is the dir in which you find dir
 SoundFX and Pics, Libs, Data, etc.

save and exit.
Reset the computer to make the assign effective.

Have fun!!
