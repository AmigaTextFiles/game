        Braking firm at any pressure

Wet:    Fair rail conditions
        Wheelslip likely in yellow or red zones
        Braking may cause wheel slide below about 50 psi

Fog:    Visibility about 100 yards
        Poor rail adhesion
        Wheelslip at top of green zone
        Brakes may cause wheel slide below 55 psi

Icy:    Very poor rail adhesion
        Wheelslip in upper half of green zone
        Brakes may cause wheel slide below 60 psi

Fall:   Leaf-fall season. Very treacherous!
        Wheelslip possible whenever taking power
        Braking may cause wheelslide at any time

The rail adhesion is also affected by the difficulty level chosen.
The chosen setting may also change during your journey depending
on the difficulty level chosen.

The windscreen will now show the effects of these weather conditions and you will
need to switch on the wipers using "w". Watch out for the "W" indicator
next to the message display.
There is a remote possibility that the wipers may fail making visibility very poor indeed.

@{"Signals picture " SYSTEM "SYS:Utilities/MULTIVIEW  Signals.iff SCREEN"}


There are many types of signal as shown on the picture linked above.
The normal sequences are also indicated.

Colour lights may have two, three or four aspects.

The distance from the next signal is shown on the display in yards.

If any signal shows red, you must stop within 35 yards of it to get the
message from the signalman.

He may ask you to pass the signal at danger.
If so you should give a long blast on the horn and proceed cautiously
until passing the next signal. Remember the next signal may be red.

Your speed passing a signal with two yellows (where available) should generally be below 90mph
and at one yellow try to reduce your speed to 60mph.
If you can see a red signal and you're over 60mph you will struggle to stop.
However, beware of signals closer together than usual, and reduce your speed
accordingly.

A hint to assist stopping is to keep your speed well below
one tenth of the number of yards from the stopping point.

Flashing yellows countdown to a high speed junction, generally 30 to 70mph.

A junction signal either has a letter above, eg S for Slow Line or
F for Fast Line, or has five white lights diagonally displayed,
indicating the direction of the crossover.

Other signals may have a number displayed indicating the platform that
you will enter, or the line you are crossing to.

Junctions without flashing yellow signals are protected by red signals which
will change as the train passes over the @{" AWS " LINK "AWS"} magnet if the
route is set and the line is clear.

These junction speeds vary between 10 and 40 mph.

A warning board will be shown after passing the junction signal
indicating the junction speed, and the speed limit board will
also be seen indicating the position of the junction.

If you are detained at a red signal for a couple of minutes the guard will
announce the reason for the delay to the passengers and it will be displayed on the
Message Display and in the log.

@NODE "Stations" "Stations"
@TOC "MAIN"


The distance from the next station you are stopping at is shown on
the display in miles, and then in yards when you approach.

Again you must stop within 35 yards of the Stop board displaying the
number of coaches to enable you to get the "R" indication when your
guard is ready to leave. If you pass this board, select "O" to shut
the motors down, then "R" to select Reverse and notch up power with
"." in the usual way until you are back behind the board. Be careful
not to overshoot again backwards !

Arrival times at intermediate stations are 1 minute before the shown
departure time.

The time you arrive and depart stations, and certain other points
will be recorded on the log, plus the average speed since the previous
point.

The "R" indicator will not appear before the booked time to depart,
or at a red signal.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "Braking" "Braking"
@TOC "MAIN"


Braking will vary depending on the loco details, the number of coaches,
and weather conditions.

Keys:
    z       Release
    x       Reduce
    c       Increase
    v       Increase (continuous)
    b       Emergency


 Brake gauge
  

  72   Brake released

  65   Initial application

  50   Full service

   0   Emergency



To apply brakes hold c until the guage reads 50 psi (pounds per square inch)
and release with z when approaching the desired speed level.

Alternatively use v to brake, "catching" the brake with x as the needle comes
down to 50 psi.

Normal Full Service application is 50 psi (vertical needle on dial).
Normally the driver would not use a greater braking force than this,
particularly in the wet.

Allow time for the brakes to release down the length of the train
particularly after heavy braking, before taking power.

When braking try not to brake too hard as you come to a stand
or you will spill the tea(!), and you will have to wait for the
air brake pipe to charge up again.

Having said that, don't pass a red signal ever, and don't speed excessively
or the guard will put the brake on or you may even derail the train.

In the wet don't be too heavy on the brakes or the wheels may lock up
and slide greatly increasing braking distance.

Your speed passing a signal with two yellows should generally be below 90 mph
and at one yellow try to reduce your speed to 60 mph.
If you can see a red signal and you're over 60 mph you will struggle to stop.
However, beware of signals closer together than usual, and reduce your speed
accordingly.

If necessary kill the power with "n". This is bad but better than
passing red signals !

A hint to assist stopping is to keep your speed well below
one tenth of the number of yards from the stopping point,
until the speed is down to 10 mph, then release brakes
completely until about 50 yards, then rub brakes lightly
for smooth stop (no audible screech).

Suggested maximum speeds at 50 psi.
(dependant on rail condition, difficulty level, gradient, weather etc)


880 yards 60 mph
200 yards 30 mph
100 yards 20 mph
50  yards 10 mph

When taking power watch that you don't let the Ammeter go into
the red area or you will overload the motors and lose power.

Reset with "i", you may need more than one attempt.

Note if you overload excessively the loco may fail and your drive is over!

In poor weather you should also stay below the yellow
region to avoid wheelslip.

When reducing power you should use "m" and wait for the notch indicator
to run down, rather than use "n", as sudden shutting off of power
could cause arcing and damage to the motors.

The speed limit is indicated by a white circular sign, with a red border.

Reductions in speed limit are indicated by a white triangle
with a yellow border, with the new limit in black.
Generally about 1.5 miles warning is given, unless two or
more reductions follow closely.
In cases of severe speed reduction, an @{" AWS " LINK "AWS"} horn will sound.

When passing from a lower speed to a higher speed section remember
not to accelerate until the whole train has passed the higher speed
limit board. A guide to this is the fact that the gantries are about
eight coaches apart.

At any point along the route there could be a speed trap set up by traction
inspectors. You will be advised as soon as your speed has been recorded.
If you are speeding there is a possibility you will be releived of your
driving duties immediately.

@TOC "MAIN"


Neutral sections allow electric trains to pass from one electricity supply station
to another. Diesel locos may ignore them.

If you see the Neutral Section Warning Board you must run down the
power to zero before the Neutral Section Board, or there may
be a loss of power (reset with "i").

The warning board is one mile before the neutral section.

As a guide it takes 36 seconds to run down power from full power
which is a mile at 100 mph.

If you shut off power in time, power will be returned at the end of the
short dead section, otherwise you will have to try and reset the motors using
key i after exitting the neutral section.

Note if you overload excessively the loco may fail and your drive is over!

Do NOT use the brakes in a neutral section as it is a rheostatic brake
fed from the motors, so you will lose braking temporarily.

Warning board is white on black, board at neutral section is black on white.

The letters O F or R appear below the brake guage to indicate

Note: f&r only work when the game has first started or after the
train has stopped and o has been pressed to stop the motors.

In reality there is a three position switch:

F O R
\ | /

so you must stop, go to O (off) then into Reverse.

Putting the switch into Off while moving will cause a brake
application. Pressing f or r whilst the motors are running and audible
will have no effect.

Also power notches must be run down to zero before changing direction.

So when starting, hold F until you hear the motors start up, and F appears
then hold O until you hear them shut down, see O, then press R until you hear
the motors restart and R appears. You are now in reverse.

Diesel and Electric Locos


There are a number of differences between diesel and electric locos

Diesel locos run up power quicker and no harm is done by shutting
off power to 0 (key n). They also do not need to shut off power
through neutral sections. They weigh more adding more brake force
and giving better traction in slippery conditions.

Drivers would not normally switch a loco to Off at intermediate stations and
signals.

Instead of a Line light a Power light is available which glows red
in case of overload shut-down indicating the loco has shut down.
Instead of a Breaker light a Fault light is available which glows
blue if a fault develops on the loco.

Both these lights can usually be reset by key I.
If not your loco has failed and your drive is over!

Included with this release are @{" Data files " LINK "Data"} and sound effects for two
locos, BR classes 87 and 40.

Class 87
========

Users of TrainDriver will be familiar with these locos.

Weight      80 tons
Max Speed   110 mph


Class 40

recommended for enthusiasts!

See @{" Train Driver Route Editor " LINK "TDRE"} for an easier way!

You will need to be competent with a Text Editor and able to copy files etc.

If you want to create your own fictional line or try to simulate a real

in any text editor (eg ED in Workbench:c/)

First you must create a drawer in the TD2A:routes/ drawer

Choose a name for your route, without spaces in the name, LESS THAN 12 CHARACTERS.


Then in this drawer you may create the following files.
The only files must be present are Data and Stations.

If the program can't find any of the other files it will attempt to generate data
based on the position of the sliders.

The following are linked and both or neither should be present

signals1 and speeds1 ( and signals2 and speeds2 if double track)
gradients and scenery

@{"Signals picture " SYSTEM "SYS:Utilities/MULTIVIEW  Signals.iff SCREEN"}

Signals with codes other than zero,1 or 9 should be at least three signals apart
as the signal sequence usually takes three signals.
Also when testing start at least 4 signals before signals to test
their effect.

To create first make up your signals1 file for the main line
and the make a copy as signals2 and edit the codes for the second line.
Do not edit the mileages, particularly of junction signals.
The number of signals on both lines should be equal.
Use code 9000 to show that signals on line 2 do not apply until the next crossover from line 1.

Also note that after a signal code 1 (or 101 etc) there should be an entry to
show which digit is to be displayed in the theatre box indicator
sbove the signal. This is in fact the name of the file in the Matrix drawer, so
you may create your own digits.

The format is a 5x5 grid:

22122
21122
22122
22122
22122    = 1

where 1 is a white light and 2 is a grey light, ie off.
Any colour 0-9 may be substituted.

After a signal code 2 (or 202,1202 etc) there should be an entry for each line,
the first entry for line 1, the second for line 2. See the above example.

There is no need for a counter or "End" line in this file.

If Routes/xx/timings is present these timings will be used.
If not you may either let the program calculate the timings
or Load Timings from the second GUI.

The program expects in this case the pattern #?.timings in the
