This is a morphos port of latest scummvm 1.0.0, requiring PowerSDL 11.x or later.

Experimental (i.e completely untested) CAMD driver is also included. If you have a capable MIDI device,
I'd be interested to know if it works or not.

if you encounter any issue, contact me at: fabien.coeurjoly@wanadoo.fr
