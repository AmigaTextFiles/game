The game:

I suggest you simply start the game and try it out. In case you need some
introducing words, here we go. This is a game for 0, 1 or 2 players. The aim
is to keep a ball inside the playing field, using a bat, and possibly bump
away the blocks on the appropriate side in order to remove the whole bunch
of them, what enables you to advance to the next level and - eventually -
to win the game. But it's VERY hard not to let the ball slip away behind
you. Furtheron you have to try not to hit the blocks on the opponent's side,
because for doing so the latter one will be rewarded with twice the points
you would get for hitting the correct blocks on your side. BTW, the darker
the blocks are the more points are scored by hitting them. Of course, you
can collect several Xtras. How? Well, they are released by smashing away the
black blocks, whereupon they start to float into that players direction who
most recently reflected the ball. But be warned, not every black block
reveals a positive Xtra :-) And, last but not least, there is a cheat mode
you can activate SOMEHOW...

                                                                Have fun :->
