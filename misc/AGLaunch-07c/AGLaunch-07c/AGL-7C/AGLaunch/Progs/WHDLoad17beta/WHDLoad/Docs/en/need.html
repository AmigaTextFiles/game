<h3>Requirements</h3>
<h4>... to run installed programs</h4>
<ul>
<li>CPU 68000 (68010+ is recommended because some installs require the VBR for
the 'quit by a key' feature)
<li>Kickstart 2.0 (version 37+)
<li>a minimum of 1.0 MB RAM (sometimes more, it depends on the installed
program)
</ul>
<h5>Kickstart Emulation</h5>
<p>Some installs use a so called <cite>kickemu</cite> to have a complete AmigaOS
environment for the installed program. For that <cite>kickemu</cite> a
original kickstart image is required. This image can be extracted from a real
Amiga with tools like <cite>GrabKick</cite> or similar which can be found on
aminet. The supported image version depends on the installed program.
You should find an information
about which image must be used in the supplied <i>ReadMe</i> file. The image
for kickstart versions 1.2 and 1.3 can only extracted from a appropriate A500,
for version 3.1 it can be extracted from a A500/A600/A2000, A1200 or A4000 which
must be equipped with a Kick3.1 ROM. If the image cannot be found
by WHDLoad or the image is of the wrong version or altered in any way, WHDLoad
will quit with an appropriate error message. Additionally a relocation file
with the extension <tt>.RTB</tt> matching the kickstart image must be present.
This relocation file can be found on aminet in the archive
<a href="http://www.aminet.net/util/boot/skick346.lha">util/boot/skick346.lha</a>.
Both files, the kickstart image and the
relocation file must be located in the directory <i>Devs:Kickstarts/</i> and
must have the correct name. The following table shows the names of the files
depending on the kickstart version:</p>

Starting WHDLoad version 16.5 also the kickstart images from the Cloanto
Amiga Forever CD's may be used. The images must be renamed according the table
below. Additionally the <i>rom.key</i> must be copied to <i>Devs:Kickstarts/</i>.
Some older installs require a kick40068.A1200 image these installs wont run
with the Cloantos ROMs.<br>
Amiga Forever 2008 also includes the kick40068.A1200 and the images are
automatically copied to the right places.<p>

<h4>... to write new Slaves / install programs</h4>
<ul>
<li>recommended is a 68030+ with MMU to use all features of WHDLoad (a fat
machine is always a good choice to develop software ;-))
<li>know how about machinecode, assembler, amiga hardware ...
<li>an assembler (should be able to optimize)
<li>some other tools will be useful (hexedit, disasm, ...)
<li>some more MB's RAM
<li>access to different machines for testing reasons (68000 - 68060, OCS, AGA,
GfxCard)
<li>a hardware or software freezer like AR3, HRTmon, TK
<li>an NMI button to interrupt a running program or to enter a
software-monitor/freezer
</ul>
