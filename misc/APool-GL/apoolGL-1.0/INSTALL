To compile the apool binary the following configuration is needed:

OpenGL:
* C_INCLUDE_PATH has to point to the directory where the GL-include-
  directories are located. 
	That is $C_INCLUDE_PATH/GL/{gl.h, glu.h} must exist!

* LIBRARY_PATH has to point on the directory where the GL-libraries
  are located.
	That is $LIBRARY_PATH/{GL.x, GLU.x} must exist.

SDL: 
* sdl-config must be in your path!

If your system fits all these needs, just try 

	make

If no error occurs, the apool-binary ("apool") should have
been created in the apool-directory

For now apool must be started in its creation directory since it
depends on the textures (balls/*) and a configuration-files
("konst.dat") and must habe write-permission (to create "table.dat").

Windows: Look at the web page http://www.planetjahn.de -> apool for
instructions how to install / compile the sources under Windows.

Have fun.
