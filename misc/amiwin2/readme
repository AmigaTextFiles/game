Requirements & Installation
---------------------------
This game requires an A1200. Installation is simple, just copy the file 
to the location of your choice. No assigns are necessary. It appears to
run on all configurations of A1200, though memory can be tight on an un-
expanded A1200.

Usage
-----
It's a fruit machine, nuff said. Oh yeah, to quit press escape or click 
on the tiny Q gadget in the top left hand corner.


Who? And What?
--------------
All coding happened on an A1200 with an Apollo 1230 @ 50mhz and 16 meg of 
Fast RAM, in Blitz Basic 2.1 by Tim Quigley of MadSoft Inc.

Bugtesting occured on a standard A1200 and an A1200 with 4 meg fastram by 
Julie, Tara, Arron and Dave. Cheers for the suggestions guys.
