STRITFAITER!

Prologue
--------
The plot is  set to the planet  Sworxz,  the planet  of the 5  weird  rules.
"Knask", the  ruling king,  has built a  set of some  really laws which  the
players MUST follow.  In respect of that, I chose not to implement functions
to break the rules; so live by them.

Rules
-----
The rules are:

     1.  * You may not turn around.  If you wish to face your opponent,
          move your player backwards until you are.
     2.  * You may only kick in one direction - up. As all MEN know,
          lower kicks may be dangerous (down THERE, man!).
     3.  * If you bow as the opponent kicks, you won't be hit.
     4.  * You may sometimes experience the "shadow effect", where you
          or your opponent may be visualized twice.  This is not a bug,
          it's a facillity. :)
     5.  * Uuh.. Duuh.  I don't remember the fifth rule. You make one up.

Epilogue
--------
As you might know, this game was coded in a  hurry (now and then), it has
lots of bugs, but as I've said earlier;- it won for the GAME COMPO at the
Tonstad  Party  1996,  in  Trondheim,  Norway.   Enjoy  it  if  you  can.
