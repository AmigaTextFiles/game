                 Doctor Who - The Quiz Game
                                           v2.0

                       Introduction
                                   
                                           
This is a simple multiple choice quiz game based on Doctor Who.
It features questions about all the Doctors from the first Doctor
to the Seventh Doctor, and the adventures they were invloved with.

There are also some questions about behind the scenes and other
issues related to Doctor Who. Little bits of extra information
sometimes accompany questions.

NOTE: Due to the fact that the program is written in AMOS, the Quiz
Game is not friendly with screen blankers. If you have a screen blanker
in operation, turn it off. If you still have it in operation during
the game, you will probably find that mouse pointer disappears. If this
happens, press LAmiga-A to return to Workbench, where you can deactivate
the blanker.

                 Doctor Who - The Quiz Game
                                           v2.0
                                           
                        Requirements
                        
                     
There are very few requirements for this game. The requirements:

o An Amiga (any Amiga should do, although I haven't tried it on
  1.3 machines. It definately works on 2.x machines, although I
  haven't tried it on 3.x machines)
  
o Any form of disk media (hard or floppy)

o A knowledge of Doctor Who (This could be very useful indeed)

o NO screen blanker. It does not work with this game 
  (See @{" Introduction " link Introduction})

I'm not sure about memory requirements. It should work with 1Mb or
over, but it may work with 512k.

                Doctor Who - The Quiz Game
                                          v2.0
                                          
                        Instructions
                        
The game is very simple to play. Once you start the game, you will
be presented with a title screen. There are two options - play or
quit.

NOTE: The program was compacted at compile time, so there is a short
      delay before the game starts.

      Also, pressing Ctrl-C WILL interrupt the program. This is deliberate.

If you chose play, then you are then presented with my attempts at 
drawing a console room. On the screen there should be a question for
you to answer.

To answer the question, click on the answer you think is correct. You
will be told if you are correct or not. Some questions have a little
information related to the question.

If you get it right, you will score a point. If you get it wrong, a 
red light will come on on the console. Light three of these, and the 
game is over.

Also on the console is the door control. This will allow you to exit
the game. To the right of the console screen is a credits switch. This
will display the credit for the game.

If you exit, or lose all three chances, you will be returned to the
title screen, and your score will displayed.

The answers to the questions appear (or should appear) in random order.
This sometimes doesn't happen, and they appear in the same order. This 
is an attempt to stop people memorising the questions by just looking 
at the answers. Another way to stop this is that the same set of answers
sometimes apply to two questions.
