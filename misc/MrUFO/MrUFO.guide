@node eng_overall "Mr UFO over all"

Mr UFO is a gravity flight -type action game set on 8 levels. The object is to
pilot a UFO craft and collect all the boxes required. There are enemies to avoid
and some other things too. Also includes @{"TechniColour Top 100 list" link "eng_highscores"} and support
for @{"music modules" link "eng_music"}. That should do for a concise overall node.

        *** Wednesday 7th April 1926

Today I decided to go for a stroll along the beach with Alice. We changed into
our leisure clothes and went to the lobby. "Ah, señor police sergeant", said the
receptionist, "I see you are going out. May I remind you that dinner is at 14:00
today?" I took notice of this and then we went outside.
  The stroll was marvelous. Barcelona was at its best, as it was too early in
the day for those horrible black automobiles, and all the transportation
vehicles we saw were bicycles. Alice suggested that we go for a swim, but I
wasn't feeling like it. Instead, we found a nice café and ate ice cream with
raspberry jam and drank coffee.
  "When are you going back to England?" asked Alice. "When my vacation is over,
which should be in four days", I said, taking the watch out of my pocket. "But
that doesn't mean you have to come, too. You can stay and enjoy the beautiful
springtime Spain." With a cheerful giggle, Alice assured me that she would.
  Then we finished our coffees, paid the bill and went back to the hotel to get
dinner. Dinner was chili con carne, with fresh mineral water as a beverage. It
was very delicious, and quite cheap, too. After dinner, we went to our room,
and listened to the radio. There was some news from Germany about political
unrest after the Great War, but it was boring us to death, so we turned it off.
  At 21:30, we went to sleep. The great thing about being on vacation is that
one can go to sleep early. No need to stay overnight at the station here!


        *** Thursday 8th April 1926

I woke up at 8:00 due to the telephone ringing. I answered it, and was told that
a letter had arrived for me. "What is it, dear?" asked Alice. "Probably nothing
important", I said, "you go back to sleep. I'll take care of it." So she did.
  Pulling my morning gown over my sleeping clothes, I stepped into my slippers
and went to the lobby to get my letter. When the receptionist handed it to me I
saw that it was from William Twyselton, a friend of mine at the London Royal
Library back in England. Pleased to hear from an old chum, I accepted the letter
and went back into my room to read it.
  Inside the room Alice had already got dressed and was combing her hair, ready
to go downstairs and get some breakfast. I sat on the bed and opened the letter.
I read it with interest.

            Dear Arthur!

    I hope you are enjoying your vacation in Barcelona, and that it is quite
    sunny down there. Here in England the sun has just barely come out of its
    wintery state.
      Anyway, I know how much you love reading ancient history, so I thought I'd
    tell you something that might interest you. Yesterday, on the 2nd of April,
    our library received a great old book to be displayed in our book museum.
    The book appears to be written in the 1760's, and it looked very exciting,
    so I asked the director of the museum if I could take a closer look at it.
      So when the library was closed and I was alone (save for the guards of
    course), I opened the book with great care. The book was about mind
    relaxation and meditation techniques, and some more complicated rituals
    used by people in the pre-Christian era.
      It was exciting enough at first, but when I got to page 647 I caught
    sight of something really amazing. I found a detailed description of the
    technique people used to communicate with astral entities in ancient China.
    The text was easy to read, and it was carefully illustrated, so I copied it
    down to my notebook, and knowing how interested in such things you are, I am
    now sending the copy I made to you. Why not give it a read and see if it is
    any good?

            Regards,
                    William.

There was, indeed, a notebook paper scribbled all over with tiny letters
attached to the letter. I put it in my pocket and went for breakfast with Alice.
  We ate a simple breakfast, just two cups of tea, a bread roll with butter, and
an orange. Then Alice said he was going shopping and asked if I would like to
come with her. I replied that I wasn't really feeling like it, I would prefer to
stay in the hotel and read something to pass the time. So she agreed to that and
went shopping on her own.
  I went back to the hotel room and took the notebook page out of my pocket. It
was difficult to read such tiny writing, so I took out my glasses and put them
on my nose. That worked much better. I read the entire text and memorised it.
After reading about the technique, I thought I'd try it for a laugh. So I
started my preparations.
  I put a "do not disturb" sign on the door, and locked the door. Then I pulled
the curtains shut, and placed a candle on the table. I lit the candle and turned
off the electric light. This resulted in an eerie darkness, lit only by the
small flame of the candle.
  I lay down on the bed, and closed my eyes, trying not to think of anything. By
the time the candle had burned out I was so relaxed I was about to fall asleep.
Instead, I thought about the supposedly magic mantra I had read about in the
text. It was very relaxing, and I soon dozed off.


        *** Friday 9th April 1926

I don't know the exact time this happened. It must have been after midnight, but
I cannot for the life of me pinpoint the right hour, let alone the exact minute.
I was still asleep, and had begun to dream.
  I dreamt about beautiful, distant stars. I was watching the stars first from
the ground, then I began to ascend. I travelled quite a long distance, until I
saw a small vehicle like a small fighter aeroplane, but it was completely made
of metal and was completely covered. I somehow floated inside this vessel.
  There I saw a strange-looking man-like creature. He could easily have been my
identical twin, but his skin colour was a verdant green shade. He was dressed in
a stylish grey suit with no indication of his nationality. I tried to start a
conversation with the creature. Suddenly I found out that I was the creature,
and was looking at the interior of a vehicle devoid of any other beings.
  I distantly heard a faint voice that was somehow familiar to me, but I
couldn't remember who it belonged to. I felt my body being shaken. At first it
was disturbing, but then it gradually eased, and soon I was once again standing
in the vehicle completely still. Suddenly I heard a voice in my head.
  "Greetings, friend", said the voice. "You have been chosen to make the Voyage
of the Eight Worlds to reach the Citadel of Peace. You will be given
instructions as you progress. Do you accept this?" Mesmerised by the strangeness
of all things, I accepted.


        *** Saturday 10th April 1926

I seem to have split into two spiritual entities. One of them is still Sgt.
Arthur Wallace, of the London Police, vacationing in Barcelona with his
girlfriend. The other is an Astral Voyager, beginning his Voyage of the Eight
Worlds. I can switch between these two entities entirely at will, and no one
else notices anything.
  I was woken up around noon by Alice, who informed me that I must have slept
for over 18 hours. "I'm not feeling very well", I feigned, "perhaps it's best
that I remain here and try to catch more sleep. I should be better by tomorrow."
"OK, dear", said Alice, and went outside, presumably to the pharmacy. Glad to be
alone once again, I switched to the Astral Voyager and set course for the first
World. The Voyage was just beginning...

@node eng_menu "Salad is included in every meal"

The main menu consists of six buttons, which are, in the order of appearance,
as follows:
    - Start the game.
    - Enter a @{"secret passcode" link "eng_codes"}. Every time the main menu is accessed, this will
      default to a standard password, so you'll have to reenter your code every
      time you wish to play a different level.
    - Look at the @{"high scores" link "eng_highscores"}.
    - Show the Statistics Window. This shows the system date, available memory,
      current passcode and so on.
    - Print the @{"high scores" link "eng_highscores"} onto paper or write them into a file.
    - Quit the game.
Just press a button and you're away!
@endnode
@node eng_play "Come... play... my... game!"

Playing the game itself is quite simple. You can pilot your UFO craft with
either a joystick or the cursor keys. Pressing Fire or Return will cause the
UFO to "warp", if the warp indicator is showing green. You can even shoot
things by pressing the spacebar.
  Your main object on each level is to collect boxes and avoid being killed by
the enemy. You can collect boxes and stuff simply by touching them. But every
time you move, you consume some of your precious fuel. Fuel is only fully
restored every time you run out of it, and that costs you a life. You get a
small additional supply of fuel every time you complete a level.
  On the right side of the meter panel is your radar. This shows a scan of the
whole level, with important bits shown by colourful pixels. Learn to watch both
the radar and the game area simultaneously.
  You can use the following control keys in a game:
  - pressing "p" will pause the game. While in pause mode, pressing F10 will
    load a new @{"music module" link "eng_music"}.
  - pressing "s" will switch between music or sound effects. If no music is
    loaded this will simply toggle sound effects on or off.
@endnode
@node eng_objects "Objection sustained."

There are lots of objects to see, well a few anyway. There are two types of
collectible objects:
  - Boxes. These come in two varieties, green and blue. Collecting a box of
    either colour will award 1...3 points and decrease the amount of boxes
    left to collect by one. Collect all boxes to finish the level. Boxes are
    shown in the radar as green or blue dots.
  - Diamonds. These also come in two varieties, normal and special (with a
    little green dot). A normal diamond is worth 10...14 points, while a
    special diamond is worth 50...70 points. Diamonds don't show up in the
    radar.
Both boxes and diamonds disappear if you take too long to get to them.
  There are also enemies. Every level has at least one enemy, in fact the last
three levels have two enemies each. Enemies try to home in on your UFO, and
their flight capabilities improve by each level. Touching an enemy is, of
course, fatal. Enemies show up in the radar as red dots. You can see your
position in the radar as a white dot, so you know if you are close to enemies.
  Every time you complete a level, you are awarded bonus points for the levels
you have completed and the fuel you have left. An extra life is awarded every
400 points.
@endnode
@node eng_highscores "The colourful list"

For the first time in Amiga game history, we have a game where you can enter
your name in the High Score List in colour. There are 16 colours to choose from,
and both the foreground and the background colour can be changed.
  To change colour when writing, either click on the colour boxes with the mouse
(left for foreground, right for background) or press the function keys F1...F8
as follows:
  - Normal function keys will change the foreground colour to the non-
    highlighted colours.
  - Function keys with Shift will change the foreground colour to the
    highlighted colours.
  - Function keys with Control will change the background colour to the non-
    highlighted colours.
  - Function keys with Control and Shift will change the background colour to
    the highlighted colours.
You can scroll the list with either the joystick, the cursor keys, or the two
arrow buttons provided on the screen. To return to the @{"Main Menu" link "eng_play"} press Fire or
Return or click the Return button on the screen.
@endnode
@node eng_require "Things that are required. By this game."

Quite simple, really. All this game requires is:
    - An @{"Amiga" link "eng_amiga"} computer
    - A mouse (a joystick also is recommended)
    - About 1 MB of free memory
    - The data files present in the "Levels" and "Data" directories
    - AmigaGuide® compability for the viewing of this document
If you've got all of these things, then don't just sit there, go play the game!

@node eng_money "Note my new e-mail address and WWW homepage."

So far, I have had a few registrations for my earlier games, Excavation and
Cubical Worlds. Due to popular (well, Ville Helin anyway) demand I've decided to
install a keyfile system to Mr UFO. All you need to play the registered version
of Mr UFO is a keyfile, which can be sent via either e-mail or regular mail.
Here are the prices:

Method of registration      SEK     FIM     DEM     USD     GBP
================================================================
Keyfile only, via e-mail    10.-     7.-    2.30    1.30    0.85
Keyfile only, via disk 1)   18.-    12.-    4.00    2.30    1.40

1) You supply your own disks
2) I supply disks for you

No other currencies are accepted. Also note that I do NOT use PGP, so if you
want your keyfile by e-mail, it will appear entirely uncoded and ready to go.
I prefer to use MIME attachments, but I will UUEncode the keyfile if you really
want to.
  Keyfiles can also be password protected, so you have to enter a password
before the game can use the keyfile. You can choose your own password, and
then send it to me. Passwords can be up to 20 characters long.
  If you want to receive files via disk, you need to supply one disk for just
the keyfile or two disks if you want to receive the other games. If you haven't
got enough disks I can supply my own disks for an extra charge.
  Here is my new e-mail address which you can use to contact me. It is:

    palaste@cc.helsinki.fi

If you send me enough money, you can get the following games:

    - The registered version of Cubical Worlds, my 3D block game
    - The registered version of Excavation, my underground strategy/action game
    - Strateq, my Chess-derivative
    - Lactose Intolerance, an arcade game
    - The Butterflies!, another arcade game
    - Maze Mania, yet another arcade game
    - Fantasy Trade, a trading game
    - The Secret of Arcturus, a RPG/board game
    - Self Defense, a text adventure
    - Super Daleks, arcade game!
    - L, my puzzle-game which I did for a competition in MikroBitti magazine

@node eng_amos "Tori who?"

AMOS. It is much hated, but I love it! A shame it can't handle the AGA

they concentrate primarily on PC products nowadays. Long live AMOS!
@endnode
@node eng_music "Music is the energy"

Mr UFO supports three types of modules, ProTracker, MED or standard @{"AMOS" link "eng_amos"} .abk
modules. To use modules, write an ASCII text file called "Modules.MRUFO",
containing all the pathnames of the modules you wish to use and put it in the
same directory as Mr UFO.
  The game will automatically detect which type of module it is currently
loading, so don't freak out over filename extensions. But note that the library
"medplayer.library" is required to play MED modules.
  If you own the quite excellent game Deluxe Galaga by Edgar M. Vigdal, and have
written a modules file for it, exactly the same file can be used in Mr UFO (it
has to be renamed first though). But remember that unlike DGalaga, Mr UFO does
NOT support XPK packing.
@endnode
@node eng_codes "About passcodes"

Mr UFO has a fully functional passcode system. Codes consist of eight
characters, which can be letters, numbers or other symbols. A code contains
information about your current level, number of lives, amount of fuel and so
on. However, your score is not included in the code and is reset to 0 every
time you start a new game.
  You are given a passcode every time you complete a level and you can enter
new codes at the @{"Main Menu" link "eng_menu"}.

@node eng_amiga "Everybody's girlfriend"

That's it. I will no longer even try to speculate who owns the Amiga now. I'll
just say that it is an excellent computer, and it should be more popular. Trying
to find Amigas in Finland nowadays is similar to getting a juicy dish of pork
ribs in a Muslim mosque. Or expecting to find a four-leaf clover on the Moon
(maybe not that improbable). I've said it before, and I'll say it again: we
really need an advertising campaign for the Amiga, aimed not just at people who
have owned Amigas since 1985, but for newcomers as well. How else can the world
sustain an Amigan population of over 100 in the 3rd millennium AD?

        *** Keskiviikko 7. huhtikuuta 1926

Tänään päätin mennä kävelyretkelle rannalle Alicen kanssa. Vaihdoimme ajanviete-
vaatteisiimme ja menimme aulaan. "Ah, señor poliisiylikonstaapeli", sanoi vas-
taanottovirkailija, "huomaan että olette lähdössä ulos. Saanko muistuttaa teitä
että päivällinen on tänään kello 14:00?" Huomioin tämän ja sitten lähdimme ulos.
  Kävelyretki oli erinomainen. Barcelona oli parhaimmilaan, koska oli liian ai-
kaista niille kauheille mustille automobiileille, ja kaikki näkemämme kulkuneu-
vot olivat polkupyöriä. Alice ehdotti että menisimme uimaan, mutta minua ei hu-
vittanut. Sen sijaan me löysimme mukavan kahvilan ja söimme jäätelöä vadelmahil-
lon kera ja joimme kahvia.
  "Koska olet menossa takaisin Englantiin?" kysyi Alice. "Kun lomani on ohitse,
minkä pitäisi olla noin neljän päivän kuluttua", sanoin, ottaen kellon ulos tas-
kustani. "Mutta se ei tarkoita että sinunkin pitäisi tulla. Sinä voit jäädä tän-
ne ja nauttia kauniista keväisestä Espanjasta." Iloisella kikatuksella Alice va-
kuutti minulle jäävänsä.
  Sitten joimme kahvimme loppuun, maksoimme laskun ja menimme takaisin hotelliin
päivällistä varten. Ruokana oli chili con carnea, ja juomana raikasta mineraali-
vettä. Se oli erittäin herkullista, ja aika halpaakin. Päivällisen jälkeen me-
nimme huoneeseemme ja kuuntelimme radiota. Uutisissa puhuttiin poliittisesta
rauhattomuudesta Saksassa Suuren Sodan jälkeen, mutta se oli meistä tappavan
tylsää, joten laitoimme sen pois päältä.
  Kello 21:30 menimme nukkumaan. Lomalla olemisen hyvä puoli on siinä että voi
mennä aikaisin nukkumaan. Täällä ei tarvitse viettää yötä asemalla!


        *** Torstai 8. huhtikuuta 1926

Heräsin kello 8:00 koska puhelin soi. Vastasin siihen, ja sain kuulla että mi-
nulle oli saapunut kirje. "Mistä on kyse, rakas?" kysyi Alice. "Ei varmaankaan
mitään tärkeää", sanoin, "mene sinä vain takaisin nukkumaan. Minä hoidan sen."
Joten hän meni.
  Vedettyäni aamutakkini yöpukuni päälle, astuin tohveleihini ja menin aulaan
hakemaan kirjeeni. Kun vastaanottovirkailija antoi sen minulle nän että se oli
William Twyseltonilta, ystävältäni Lontoon Kuninkaallisessa Kirjastossa. Mielis-
säni siitä, että kuulen vanhasta kaverista, otin kirjeen vastaan ja menin takai-
sin huoneeseeni lukemaan sen.
  Huoneen sisällä Alice oli jo pukeutunut ja oli kampaamassa hiuksiaan, valmiina
menemään alakertaan hakemaan aamiaista. Istuin sängylle ja avasin kirjeen. Luin
sen kiinnostuneena.

            Hyvä Arthur!

    Toivon että nautitte lomastanne Barcelonassa, ja että siellä on aurinkoista.
    Täällä Englannissa aurinko on hädin tuskin tullut pois talvisesta tilastaan.
      Joka tapauksessa tiedän kuinka paljon sinä pidät muinaishistoriasta luke-
    misesta, joten ajattelin kertoa sinulle jotain, mikä saattaisi kiinnostaa
    sinua. Eilen, huhtikuun 2. päivänä, kirjastomme sai suuren vanhan kirjan
    asetettavaksi näytteille kirjamuseossamme. Kirja näyttää olevan kirjoitettu
    1760-luvulla, ja se näytti erittäin jännittävältä, joten pyysin museonjohta-
    jalta lupaa katsoa sitä vähän lähemmin.
      Joten kirjaston sulkeuduttua ja ollessani yksin (lukuunottamatta tieten-
    kään vartijoita) avasin kirjan erittäin huolellisesti. Kirja kertoi mielen
    rentouttamisesta ja meditaatiotekniikoista, ja muista monimutkaisemmista ri-
    tuaaleista joita ihmiset käyttivät esikristillisellä ajalla.
      Se oli tarpeeksi jännittävää alun alkaenkin, mutta kun pääsin sivulle 647
    näin jotain erittäin ihmeellistä. Löysin yksityiskohtaisen kuvauksen teknii-
    kasta, jolla ihmiset kommunikoivat astraalisten olentojen kanssa muinaisessa
    Kiinassa. Teksti oli helppolukuista, ja se oli huolellisesti kuvitettu, jo-
    ten kopioin sen muistikirjaani, ja tietäen kuinka kiinnostunut näistä asi-
    oista sinä olet, lähetän nyt sinulle tekemäni kopion. Mikset lukisi sitä ja
    katsoisi onko siitä mihinkään?

            Terveisin,
                    William.

Kirjeen mukana oli kuin olikin muistikirjan sivu raapustettuna täyteen pienen-
pieniä kirjaimia. Laitoin sen taskuuni ja menin aamiaiselle Alicen kanssa.
  Söimme yksinkertaisen aamiaisen, vain kaksi kuppia teetä, sämpylä voin kanssa,
ja appelsiini. Sitten Alice sanoi menevänsä ostoksille ja kysyi haluaisnko minä
tulla hänen mukaansa. Vastasin ettei minua oikein huvittanut, jäisin mieluummin
hotelliin ja lukisin jotain aikani kuluksi. Joten hän hyväksyi sen ja meni os-
toksille yksin.
  Menin takaisin hotelliin ja otin muistikirjan sivun taskustani. Oli vaikeaa
lukea niin pientä kirjoitusta, joten otin silmälasini ja pistin ne nenälleni. Se
toimi paljon paremmin. Luin koko tekstin ja painoin sen mieleeni. Luettuani tek-
niikasta, ajattelin kokeilla sitä huvin vuoksi. Joten aloitin valmisteluni.
  Asetin "ei saa häiritä" -kyltin ovelle, ja lukitsin oven. Sitten vedin verhot
kiinni ja laitoin kynttilän pöydälle. Sytytin kynttilän ja sammutin sähkövalot.
Tämä sai aikaan aavemaisen pimeyden, jota valaisi ainoastaan kynttilän pieni
liekki.
  Asetuin makaamaan sängylle ja suljin silmäni, yrittäen olla ajattelematta mi-
tään. Kun kynttilä oli ehtinyt palaa loppuun olin niin rentoutunut että olin vä-
hällä nukahtaa. Sen sijaan ajattelin taianomaiseksi väitettyä mantraa josta olin
lukenut tekstissä. Se oli hyvin rentouttuvaa, ja pian torkahdin.


        *** Perjantai 9. huhtikuuta 1926

En tiedä tarkkaa aikaa jolloin tämä tapahtui. Sen on täytynyt olla keskiyön jäl-
keen, mutta en millään voi saada selville tarkkaa tuntia, saati sitten tarkkaa
minuuttia. Nukuin yhä, ja aloin nähdä unta.
  Näin unta kauniista, kaukaisista tähdistä. Katselin tähtiä ensin maasta, sit-
ten aloin nousta. Matkustin aika pitkän matkan, kunnes näin pienen ajoneuvon jo-
ka muistutti hävittäjälentokonetta, mutta oli tehty kokonaan metallista ja oli
kauttaaltaan peitetty. Jotenkin ajelehdin tämän aluksen sisään.
  Siellä näin oudon näköisen ihmistä muistuttavan olennon. Hän olisi helposti
voinut olla identtinen kaksoseni, mutta hänen ihonvärinsä oli kirkkaanvihreä.
Hänellä oli päällään tyylikäs harmaa puku jossa ei ollut mitään merkkiä hänen
kansallisuudestaan. Yritin aloittaa keskustelun olennon kanssa. Yhtäkkiä huoma-
sin olevani tuo olento, ja katselevani kulkuneuvon sisäpuolta, joka oli täysin
tyhjä muista olennoista.
  Kuulin kaukaa heikon äänen joka tuntui jotenkin tutulta, mutta en voinut muis-
taa kenelle se kuului. Tunsin kuinka vartaloani ravisteltin. Ensin se häiritsi
minua, mutta sitten se asteittain vaimeni, ja pian seisoin taas kulkuneuvossa
täysin paikallani. Yhtäkkiä kuulin äänen päässäni.
  "Tervehdys, ystävä", sanoi ääni. "Sinut on valittu tekemään Kahdeksan Maailman
Matka päästäksesi Rauhan Kaupunkiin. Saat ohjeita edetessäsi matkalla. Hyväksyt-
kö tämän?" Lumoutuneena kaikkien asioiden outoudesta, hyväksyin.


        *** Lauantai 10. huhtikuuta 1926

Näyn olevani haljennut kahdeksi henkiseksi olennoksi. Toinen niistä on yhä yli-
konst. Arthur Wallace, lomalla Barcelonassa tyttöystävänsä kanssa. Toinen on As-
traalinen Matkaaja, aloittamassa Kahdeksan Maailman Matkaansa. Pystyn vaihtumaan
näiden kahden olennon välillä aivan tahdonalaisesti, ja kukaan muu ei huomaa mi-
tään.
  Alice herätti minut puolenpäivän aikaan ja kertoi minulle että minä olin var-
maankin nukkunut yli 18 tuntia. "Minulla ei ole oikein hyvä olo", teeskentelin,
"ehkä olisi parasta että minä jäisin tänne ja yrittäisin saada lisää unta. Luu-
lisin parantuvani huomiseksi." "OK, rakas", sanoi Alice, ja meni ulos, arvaten-
kin apteekkiin. Kiitollisena siitä että olin jälleen yksin, vaihduin Astraali-
seen Matkaajaan ja asetin kurssin kohti ensimmäistä Matkaajaa. Matka oli juuri
alkamassa...

@node fin_play "Tule... pelaamaan... minun... peliäni!"

Itse pelin pelaaminen on aika helppoa. Voit ohjata UFO-alustasi peliohjaimella
tai kursorinäppäimillä. Tulitusnäppäimen tai Return-näppäimen painaminen saa
UFOn tekemään "poimuhypyn", jos poimuindikaattori on vihreänä. Voit jopa ampua
asioita painamalla välilyöntiä.
  Päätehtävänäsi joka tasossa on kerätä laatikoita ja välttää tulemasta viholli-
sen tappamaksi. Voit kerätä laatikoita ja kamaa yksinkertaisesti koskettamalla
niitä. Mutta aina liikkuessasi kulutat arvokasta polttoainettasi. Polttoaine uu-
sitaan täydellisesti vain silloin kun se loppuu, ja se maksaa sinulle elämän.
Saat pienen polttoainetäydennyksen aina päästessäsi tason läpi.
  Mittaripaneelin oikeassa laidassa on tutkasi. Se näyttää kuvan koko tasosta,
jossa tärkeät kohdat näkyvät värillisinä pikseleinä. Opi katsomaan sekä tutkaa
että pelialuetta yhtä aikaa.
  Voit käyttää seuraavia näppäimiä pelissä:
  - painamalla "p":tä voit pysäyttää pelin. Taukomoodin aikana voit painaa
    F10:tä ladataksesi uuden @{"musiikkimoduulin" link "fin_music"}.
  - painamalla "s":ää voit vaihtaa musiikin tai äänieffektien välillä. Jos yh-
    tään musiikkia ei ole ladattu tämä vaihtaa äänieffektit päälle tai pois.
@endnode
@node fin_objects "Vastalause hyväksytty."

On useita objekteja nähtävänä, no ainakin muutama. On kahdenlaisia kerättäviä
objekteja:
  - Laatikoita. Näitä on kahta erilaista, vihreää ja sinistä. Kumman tahansa vä-
    risen laatikon kerääminen antaa sinulle 1...3 pistettä ja vähentää kerättä-
    vänä olevien laatikoiden määrää yhdellä. Kerää kaikki laatikot päästäksesi
    tason läpi. Laatikot näkyvät tutkassa vihreinä tai sinisinä pisteinä.
  - Timantteja. Näitäkin on kahta erilaista, normaaleja ja erikoisia (joissa on
    pieni vihreä piste). Normaali timantti on 10...14 pisteen arvoinen, kun taas
    erikoistimannti on 50...70 pisteen arvoinen. Timantit eivät näy tutkassa.
Sekä laatikot että timantit katoavat jos sinulla kestää liian kauan päästä nii-
den luo.
  On myös vihollisia. Jokaisessa tasossa on ainakin yksi vihollinen, itse asias-
sa viimeisessä kolmessa tasossa on kussakin kaksi vihollista. Viholliset yrittä-
vät hakeutua UFOosi, ja niiden lentokyvyt paranevat taso tasolta. Vihollisen
koskettaminen on, tietenkin, hengenvaarallista. Viholliset näkyvät tutkassa pu-
naisina pisteinä. Voit nähdä oman asemasi tutkassa valkoisena pisteenä, joten
näet jos olet vihollisten lähellä.
  Joka kerta päästessäsi tason läpi, saat bonuspisteitä läpipääsemistäsi tasois-
ta ja jäljellä olevasta polttoaineestasi. Saat lisäelämän 400 pisteen välein.

Excavationista ja Cubical Worldsistä. Yleisön (no, ainakin Ville Helinin) pyyn-
nöstä olen päättänyt asentaa avaintiedosto-järjestelmän Mr UFOon. Kaikki mitä
tarvitset pelataksesi Mr UFOn rekisteröityä versiota on avaintiedosto, joka voi-
daan lähettää joko sähköpostitse tai tavallisella postilla. Tässä ovat hinnat:

Rekisteröintitapa           SEK     FIM     DEM     USD     GBP
================================================================
Avaintiedosto sähköpostina  10.-     7.-    2.30    1.30    0.85

1) Lähetät omat levykkeesi
2) Minä kustannan sinulle levykkeet

Mitään muita valuuttoja ei hyväksytä. Huomaa myös että minä EN käytä PGP:tä,
joten jos haluat avaintiedostosi sähköpostitse, se tulee täysin koodaamattomana
ja valmiina käyttöön. Käytän mieluiten MIME-liitteitä, mutta voin UUEnkoodata
avaintiedoston jos tosiaan haluat.
  Avaintiedostot voidaan myös suojata salasanalla, joka sinun täytyy kirjoittaa
ennen kuin pääset käyttämään Mr UFOn rekisteröityä versiota. Voit valita itse
salasanasi ja lähettää sen minulle. Salasana voi olla korkeintaan 20 merkkiä
pitkä.
  Jos haluat tiedostot levykkeellä, laita mukaan yksi levyke pelkkää avaintie-
dostoa varten tai kaksi levykettä kaikkia pelejä varten. Jos sinulla ei ole tar-
peeksi levykkeitä, minä lähetän sinulle tarvittavat levykkeet ylimääräistä kor-
vausta vastaan.
  Tässä on uusi sähköpostiosoitteeni johon voit ottaa yhteyttä minuun. Se on:

@node fin_music "Musiikki on energiaa"

Mr UFO tukee kolmentyyppisiä moduuleita, ProTracker, MED tai standardi @{"AMOS" link "fin_amos"}

tään "Modules.MRUFO" joka sisältää kaikkien käyttämiesi moduuleiden polkunimet
ja laita se samaan hakemistoon kuin Mr UFO.
  Peli tunnistaa automaattisesti minkätyyppinen moduuli on kulloinkin ladattu,
joten älä hermoile tiedostonnimien päätteissä. Mutta huomaa että kirjasto
"medplayer.library" vaaditaan MED-moduulien soittamista varten.
  Jos omistat varsin erinomaisen pelin Deluxe Galaga, jonka on tehnyt Edgar M.
Vigdal, ja olet kirjoittanut sille moduulitiedoston, täysin samaa tiedostoa voi-
daan käyttää Mr UFOa varten (tosin se täytyy ensin nimetä uudelleen). Mutta

löytää Amigoja Suomessa nykyisin on samanlaista kuin yrittäisi saada mehukkaan

sen uudelleen: me tarvitsemme todella mainoskampanjan Amigalle, jota ei ole
suunnattu vain ihmisille, jotka ovat omistaneet Amigan vuodesta 1985 lähtien,

To be compelled to; unable to avoid or resist: He cannot help but do what

services rendered. 5. a. A person employed to assist; especially, a farm

-help'er n.
  Synonyms: help, aid, assist, succor. These verbs mean to contribute to the
fulfillment of a need or to the achievement of a purpose or end. Help and
aid, the most general, are frequently interchangable, though help sometimes
conveys a stronger suggestion of effectual action. Assist usually implies
making a secondary contribution or acting as a subordinate. Succor refers to
going to the relief of one in want or distress.
  Usage: The construction of cannot help but is a less variant of cannot help
plus gerund and of cannot but plus infinitive without to. All three express
substantially the same idea: One cannot help but admire his courage. One

  Synonyms: prevent, preclude, obviate, forestall. These verbs refer to stop-
ping or hindering an action or eliminating a situation or condition that
could produce an action. Prevent strongly implies decisive counteraction to
stop something from happening. Preclude makes an event or action impossible
or largely ineffectual by removing the conditions for it, while obviate makes
an event or action unnecessary in the same way. Forestall less forcefully
implies anticipatory action to prevent or hinder an imminent happening, but
not by eliminating the condtions for it.
  Usage: Prevent is often followed by a gerund. A noun or pronoun preceding
the gerund is in the possessive case: We tried to prevent Jim's leaving (not
Jim leaving). Such examples can also be expressed: We tried to prevent Jim
from leaving. She prevented them from moving.
