@node note "Important note"

         A note for you who have an older version of Wriggle installed.

          From v2.1:

        A rather massive change of the scoresystem will make it hard
        to achieve the same high score as in v2. The best thing is
        probably to erase the highscorefile (Wriggle.hi) before
        playing this new version.

        The Teleport has been moved in the gfx-file. If you have made
        your own levels with teleports, these will not occur as teleports
        in future versions. The problem is easy to adjust though: just
        replace the piece with a new teleport and save the level again.

          From v2:

        The file Wriggle.hi in your S: won't be used anymore, a new
        file will be created in the same dir where the game is
        installed.
        If you want to use the old hiscore-file just copy it to the
        gamedir. This will work for v1.5 hiscore files - not v1.3.
        At the moment the the hiscore table will look quite uggly
        if you use a old hiscorelist, but it will work.

        ***********************************************************

                     If you registred before .......

        ***********************************************************

        If you have already registred Wriggle I can understand
        your frustration over finding this new release elsewhere
        than in your mailbox. But the HDD-crash that caused the
        rewrite (v2ß) also erased my YAM-addressbook. So please,
        if you are interested in getting information about new
        releases, just send me an eMail and re-register.

@node install "Installation of the game"

         INSTALLATION

       Hmmm... Not much to say aboute it. You have obviously
       already unpacked the archive, so just see to it that
       all files remain in the same directory.

       The package should (only) contain the files:

       Wriggle
       Wriggle.info
       Wriggle.dat
       Wriggle.gfx
       Wriggle.snd
       Wriggle.Guide
       Wriggle.Guide.info
       Wriggle.hi    (created the first time you run the game)
       WriggleABC.dat
       Wriggle_.info

       The file Wriggle.hi can be deleted if you want to
       erase the hiscore. A new file will be created next
       time you run the game.

@endnode

@node require "Requirements of the game"

         REQUIREMENTS

       Since v2.2 Wriggle will require that you have
       AHI installed on your system in order to play
       sound effects.
       AHI was created by Martin Bloom. It is freeware
       and can be found on the Aminet. So go get it!

       The game will run smoothly and errorfree on any
       Amiga using OS 2.0 or higher.

       If it doesn't work on your machine it probably
       is the result of a not entierly systemfriendly
       commodity you have in the background. If you
       find out what program that causes the problem,
       please let me know so I can name the program
       in this documentation.

         THE WRIGGLY TALE

       Once uppon a time there was a worm. He were looking
       for food. He happily found that there were quite a
       lot of apples and pears lying around on the ground.
       As he ate a couple of the apples he noticed that
       there were a spell casted on them, once one were
       eaten a rock turned up... This was a bad thing since
       rocks blocked his way. To remove these rocks he had
       to find the S, which gave him strength enough to
       remove five rocks. There were one apple that wasn't
       bewitched. Our little worm noticed that once the
       lightred apple were eaten the spell on another apple
       was broken.
       There were other things to be found too, a diamond
       gave the worm extra length but the ruby took it away
       again. He found a magic potion that made him invisible,
       and a mirror that took the worm to the mirrorworld for
       a moment.
       There were walls that trapped some of the apples, our
       worm had to find a key that matched the door in the
       wall. There were allso a teleport that took the worm
       to another room. A pair of scissors cut the worm into
       halves and gave him a friend that was willing to help
       him in his quest for food. But the friend weren't
       carefull enough, he accidentally ate some poison and
       a grave were raised to his memory.
       Our wriggling friend wriggled on in his quest and if
       nothing unexpected happened he's still wriggling around.

@node usage "How to play"

         HOW TO PLAY

       It is almost the standard worm-game except for
       the controls. You control the worm with the
       mouse, which can be tricky at first, but after
       a few rounds you'll se the advantages with a
       'non square' worm. Move freely around the
       board and pick up food. There is, ofcourse,
       no danger involved in crossing your own tail.
       Have you ever seen a worm that dies just
       because he stumbles on his own tail?

       When you start the game for the first time you
       will be able to select the first three levels,
       (if the leveldatafile contains three levels).
       To get to the rest of the levels you have to
       play and get there. After playing to a later
       level you will be able to select this level in
       the menu.

       Hint: Since the lid apple don't give any rocks
             or other bad things, but may give all the
             good things like x-tra life etc. It might
             be a good thing to take the apples in
             that special order.

       -----------------------------------------------
        Tool types if Started from WB

       In the games icon there are two tool types:

       WINDOW      - Open the game in a WB-window
                     Default: FALSE - (TRUE/FALSE)

       NOFADE      - Don't change the colours in the WB-palette

                     All colours are restored when the game
                     exits, but if you want to work on the
                     WB while the game is runing you might
                     want to have your standard colours.
                     Observe the function of the 'c' hotkey!!
                     Default: FALSE - (TRUE/FALSE)

       DEFDATAFILE - Name of file with leveldata to be loaded
                     Only datafiles created in Wriggle LevelEd
                     are guarantied to work!
                     Default: 'PROGDIR:Wriggle.dat'

       MSENS       - Mouse sensitivity. How much to drag the
                     mouse before something happens.
                     Default: 5 - (1-9)

       SOUND       - Turn the sound FX on/off.
                     Default: TRUE (TRUE/FALSE)

       -----------------------------------------------
        Arguments if Started from CLI

       From CLI you can only alter a few of the options:
       WINDOW, NOFADE and NOSOUND. Just type them after Wriggle.
       Eg: Wriggle window nofade   - This will give you
             Wriggle in a window, the WB-palette will
             not be altered and there will be soundFX.

       -----------------------------------------------
        Hotkeys

       There are hotkeys to all buttons on the menu:

         WRIGGLE LEVELED

       In v2 of Wriggle a new door opened as the
       Wriggle LevelEd was introduced.
       To make your own levels in Wriggle there are just
       a few things to remember:
       
       * Don't fill the screen with pieces.
         The game randomly places the food pieces and
         some rocks on your level, there has to be enough
         room for them!!
         ... You can ofcourse prevent random pieces from
             appearing by setting theese to 0 in the
             LevelData editor...
         If you fill the screen and the game can't find a
         place to put a random piece, the game will hang!
         I don't know if this is a bug or not, but keep
         it in mind.

       * Don't leave closed rooms empty.
         If you make a closed room, fill it with empty
         pieces. Othervise the random food might end up
         inside the room and be out of reach for the worm.

       * If you set a value of diamonds, rubys or money to
         finish the level, make sure there are enough of them
         on the field, or the level can never be finished.

       ---------------------------------------------------

        The hotkeys

       C   -> Exit LevelEd - Cancel changes
       E   -> Exit LevelEd - Keep changes
       S   -> Save World data - Don't forget!
       +,- -> Change levels
       G   -> Goto Level
       A   -> Add new level (after this one)
       I   -> Insert new level (before this one)
       D   -> Delete level
       T   -> Edit LevelData

       ---------------------------------------------------

        The pieces

       You can't place Food or Graves, but the rest is
       up to you.

       The foodpieces (Apple and Pear) are allways placed
       randomly - Keep that in mind!

       The Diamond, Ruby, S, Worm, Teleport, Rock, Water,
       Door, Key, Skull, Clock, Mirror, Scissors,
       Questionmark, Exit, Money and Wall are explained in
       @{"How to play" link usage}.

       There are one more piece though: The Empty piece.

       The empty piece is placed where you want to assure
       that no random piece is placed, i.e. in doorways or
       corridors.
       A good thing is to place some empty pieces by the
       start point so that the players don't run into a
       rock directly at the start. All new levels are
       initialized with these empty pieces.
       It is also a good thing to place
       an empty piece by the teleport so that no random
       rock make it impossible to use it.

       ---------------------------------------------------

        the LevelData Editor

       This is where you deside what to do on your level.

       You can edit the folowing data for each level:

       Repeat   -> How many times the level should be played.
                   Random Rocks and Poison will increase in
                   number at each repetition.

       Apples   -> How many apples to take
       Pears    -> How many pears to take

                 * The apples and pears are randomly placed
                   on each level, remember to leave place
                   for them!

       Diamonds -> How many diamonds to take
       Rubies   -> How many rubies to take
       Money    -> How much money to take

                 * You place theese pieces in the LevelEd.
                   If you enter a higher number than the
                   number of pieces on the level, a number
                   of pieces will be added at random to fill
                   the gap.
                   Observe that theese pieces may occur as
                   a random piece when an apple is taken.
                   This means that there may be pieces left
                   when the level is finished.

       Time     -> The number of seconds you have to finish
                   the level

       Random   -> Check theese boxes if you want rocks and
       dangers     poison to randomly occur on this level.

       ---------------------------------------------------

        When you're finished

       When the tracks are finished, tested and saved and
       you have checked that all levels are playable,
       send the datafile to @{"me" link author} and I'll
       include it in the next release.

@node about "Some info about the game"

         INFORMATION ABOUT THE GAME / BUGS

       Wriggle were my first program written in E.

       After v1.5 was released my harddrive crached
       and I lost the source. But since I liked the
       game, and several other users asked me to update
       the game, I decided to rewrite the entire thing.
       While doing this, with the help of a printout of
       v1.2, I improved and optimized almost every
       single part of the program so it became a faster
       game with a smaller bin-file.
       After adding some new functions like the
       computerplayer, keyboardshortcuts and the option
       to start the game in a WB-window, I decided to
       release the game as v2 ß.
       I then made the biggest update ever made to this
       game: Real graphix and a Level Editor. A few
       other new features were added too. I've tried to
       make all the changes that were sent to me by
       eMail, except a NTSC version. But I hope that the
       window-option will give the NTSC-users a chance.
       So don't hessitate, if you have any ideas
       let me know!

         KNOWN BUGS (iiiiih...)

       I have killed all the bugs around. So I hope I
       tell the truth when I say:

        - There are no bugs in Wriggle! (only worms..)

       ... but I've been wrong before ...

       There is one thing though... The timer is a 32-bit
       number and counts seconds from 1 jan 1978. This
       means that the number will turn negative sometime
       in dec 2047, and the game will probably not work
       properly after that...

@node history "History and News"

  HISTORY

I have placed a little @{b}(pd)@{ub} on the features added on public demand.
I did this just to show that I accually do listen to the ideas and
requests made by You.

v1.0 Released: end of october 1996

v1.1 Released: 3:rd of november -96

     Bugfix: Iritating miss that alowed the player to
             press the setupbuttons while playing,
             removed.

     General: The game is now faster (i.e. takes less processor-time)
              thanx to the usage of a cirkular list instead of an
              array for the wormpossitions. This means that the
              worm can be *any* length an still use only two assignments

     Bugfix: Now using correct, IDCMP-friendly function to read mousebuttons

       On my homepage you will find sourcecodes to many
       small applications and games in several different
       languages. For instance E, C++, AMOS, Pascal, Perl,
       JAVA, MIPS-assembler and so on...
       There are also tips to programmers and some hardware
       information about the Amiga and information on how
       to rebuild and improve it.
