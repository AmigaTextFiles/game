Solid 2 is the improved AGA version of Solid (released in 1993). The game is totally reprogrammed.
All bugs are removed. All graphics are now full AGA. Modules are replaced. More soundeffects are
now included. All resulted in a more playable (with new features like the possibility to give balls
curving effects).


System Requirements:
--------------------
* Any AMIGA with AGA chipset. The code is totally 68000 based, so future (?) AGA Amiga's based on a
68000 will also satisfy. The game is tested on both A1200 and A4000/30.

* Over 1 Mb of chipram (all recent AGA Amiga's). 'Cause the game is crunched (with the StoneCracker
cruncher) fast ram is desirable. If the game won't load (and no error messages occur), make a
bootable disk (with startup-sequence, without workbench loading procedure) and try to start the game
from that disk.


Game Options:
-------------
You can play Solid with one player, or against each other. All possible input combinations of mouse
and joystick are provided. If you want to play the game against the computer, you will always be
player 1. Keys used in the options-menu:

        F1 - Player 1 uses joystick port 1      F6 - Player 2 uses joystick port 2
        F2 - Player 1 uses joystick port 2      F7 - Player 2 uses mouse port 2
        F3 - Player 1 uses mouse port 1         F8 - Player 2 is the computer (CPU)

        ESC - Leave Solid

Press a fire button to start the game.


The Game:
---------
The objective of the game is to win 3 sets of 15 points before your opponent does. The score of both
players is at the top of the screen. Watch out: The computer improves during playing. Try to beat it,
it will not be as easy as it looks the first set !
Keys used during the game:

        P   - Pause on/off
        ESC - Leave the game and return to the options-menu

Press the fire button to give the ball curve effect in the direction your bat is moving. If someone
wins the game (no ESC is pressed) there will appear a winner screen. Pressing a fire button will
result in leaving this screen and return to the options-menu.


Mailware:
---------
Solid 2 is mailware. That means that if you like a the game you will have to mail us. Mail what ?
That's your decission. For example: A few bottles of beer (but better liquids are also welcome),
money (why should we refuse that), a big fast expensive German car etc.. Just a message by e-mail is
also OK. Just mail something we will like (maybe a postcard ?).
 If you sell the game is of no concern to me. Try to get as of it as possible. (Why not ?) Only keep
the game intact (don't moddify it) and include this Doc-file.

Bugs:
-----
Not known. Mail them (if you find any)!


To Do:
------
Removing Bugs, and nothing more !
That will be simple, 'cause probably you won't mail me those bugs.


Technical Information:
----------------------
The game is totally written in assembly using the Trash'm-One assembler (by Deftronic of Crionics).
The lenght of the sourcecode is 95607 bytes (consisting of 4616 lines). All this is combined with
graphics made in DPaint IV, converted in Image Fx and finally converted by my own iffconverter. Some
graphics are raytraced in Real 3D. Sounds are sampled with the Megalosound and Audiomaster sampler
programs. The modules are taken from the src.doc.ic.ac.uk FTP site. Finally the total game is
crunched with the StoneCracker cruncher. All this was done on my A4000/30 and the A1200's of the
other members of the Vanquish crew.

Credits: Bash (myself)  : All coding, raytracing, a part of the graphics, some sounds.

         AME            : Most of the graphics, almost all sounds.

History:
--------

I decided to make this game for these reasons:

the original Solid:

* I just simply wanted to make a game. (The original Solid)
* There didn't exist a pong clone who was simple, non commercial and didn't suck.

Solid 2:

* I wanted to make an AGA game (what is easier than remake a game that you made earlier).
* None of all pong clones had a possibility to curve balls 
* Removing all bugs of the original (It didn't work well on AGA machines)
* Maybe some other reasons I can't remember at this moment.
