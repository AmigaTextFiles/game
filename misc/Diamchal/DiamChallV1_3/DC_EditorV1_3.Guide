@{UB}@{FG text}

  This is just a quick document for the editor, because this editor is
  easy to use like any other editor. If there are problems contact @{"me" link INFOS}
  and I will extend this documentation. Now select a link below:

                           @{" Editor Screen Setup " link EDITOR}

                           @{"  Editor Menu Panel  " link MENU}

                           @{"???  Legal stuff  ???" link LEGAL}

                           @{"!!  Installation   !!" link INSTALL}

                           @{" Level testing hints " link HINTS}

  Now I wish you happy editing, and if you create really cool level sets
  which should be included as default levels, don't hesitate to send them
  to @{"me" link INFOS}. Don't play your levels alone! Upload them to Aminet. :)

@endnode
@node EDITOR "The screen setup of the editor"

  The screen for the editor is divided into two sections: The large area
  above is the editing zone. Your mouse changes into a animated cursor
  which indicates your current position. Click left to place the first
  editing block, or click right to place second editing block. Move the
  mouse to the edges of the edit area to scroll through large levels

  The small panel below is the @{"menu section" link MENU}. (<-- select for details!)

  Apart of the menu there are some keyboard instructions to use:

    C ............. clear level in edit area
    T ............. test level in edit area
    X ............. use next block for first editing block (red)
    <Shift> + X ... use next block for second editing block (blue)
    Y ............. use previous block for first editing block (red)
    <Shift> + Y ... use previous block for second editing block (blue)
    <Del> ......... erase current or all levels in memory
    Cursor Keys ... scrolls level into desired direction
    F1 - F10 ...... shortcut to get levels 1,6,...,41,46

  Of course there appear alert boxes (see menu section) and a file
  selector. The @{"file selector" link FSEL} first tries the volume "DCLevels:".
  Otherwise it uses the local sub-directory "Levels". That's all.

@endnode
@node MENU "What to do on the menu panel"

  On the righthand-side are the editing tiles. Click with the left mouse
  on them to change first editing block (red flash) or click with right
  mouse button to change second editing block (blue flashing). And on the
  lefthand-side are the following menu options:

    @{BD "QUIT"}

  Quits back to workbench. You must confirm if you really want to quit.

    @{BD "INFO"}

  Displays an information box with the name of the loaded level set in
  memory, the name of the creator and the free memory. You can use up
  to 24 characters for your name. Click any mouse button to remove the
  information box.

    @{BD "Setting"}

  Here you define all required data for the current level. Click on the
  arrow buttons to change the values up or down.
   - level name (max. 24 characters)
   - level comment or informations (max. 48 characters)
   - available time (left changes minutes, right changes seconds)
   - x-size (in steps of 2 fields, min: 20, max:60)
   - y-size (in steps of 2 fields, min: 16, max:52)
   - diamonds to collect (left change by 1, right change by 10 pieces)
   - start position (use SET button to set the position directly)
   - exit position (use SET button to set the position directly)
   - sub menus for @{"transporters" link TRANS}, @{"baddy homes" link BADDY} and @{"warp fields" link WARPS}
  Click OKAY to use this settings (with sub menus) or CANCEL to abort.

    @{BD "Load"}

  Opens a @{"file selector" link FSEL} to load a new level set into memory. After
  decoding the first level will be displayed. If your selected levels
  doesn't exist or can't be loaded you will be informed with an error
  message.

    @{BD "Save"}

  Opens a @{"file selector" link FSEL} to save your levels from memory. If your file
  already exists you will be asked to overwrite it. If the filename
  doesn't end with ".LEV" it will be added automatically. If saving
  was successful you'll get a message, else you will be informed what
  has gone wrong. Contact @{"me" link INFOS} if you get an "DISC ERROR - CODE:##" error
  with the number ##. (Important!)

    @{BD "Get"}

  Here you store the level from the edit area with the current setting
  into memory with the selected level number. The level will be tested
  for transporter settings, amount of diamonds and some other things.

    @{BD "Put"}

  Here you get the selected level number from memory into the edit area
  with the settings.

    @{BD "(xx,yy)"}

  Here you simply see the current cursor position. It may be useful if
  you want to start designing in the centre or to place baddy homes.

    @{BD "< LV >"}

  Here you set the level number for PUT and GET. The "<" decreases level
  number LV, and ">" increases level number LV. At the levels 1 and 50
  the number warpes around.

@endnode
@node FSEL "About the file selector"

  For version 1.3 of the game I've added a full file selector. Please
  read the game manual for a @{"description" link DC_ManualV1_3.Guide/FSEL}. Thanks.

  By the way: Do you really need to know how a file selector works?

@endnode
@node TRANS "Settings: Transporters"

  Very simple, I hope. First select a definition slot number (1-20).
  Then use the SET button. Click left on a transporter for the start
  position and repeat it and click right to set the destination position.

  All transporter settings will be check to have start and destination
  position set. And that there is really a transporter field on both
  positions. Of course you may have transporter fields with no action.
  That's very interesting: find a working transporter out of many
  transporter fields...

  Click on DEL to clear the current definition slot, or DELALL to erase
  all definitions. With USE THIS you get back to the main settings.

@endnode
@node BADDY "Settings: Baddy homes"

  The button in the first line defines if baddies are able to create
  normal field out of empty fields (=YES) or not (=OFF). Use this
  careful or your levels will become very easy.

  In the second line you define the positions of all baddy homes. Here
  your baddies appear and starts to move. First select a definition slot
  number (1-24). Then click on SET and in the edit area click on a normal
  field to place a baddy home.

  Click on DEL to clear the current definition slot, or DELALL to erase
  all definitions. With USE THIS you get back to the main settings.

@endnode
@node WARPS "Settings: Warp fields"

  Here you define level warpes to any level. Again select a definition
  slot number (1-4). Then use the SET button to place a warp field on
  any field type.

  In the second line you define, if you have to collect all diamonds
  before the warps are available (=DIAMONDS COLLECTED) or if they are
  available when entering the level (=ALWAYS FROM START).

  Click on DEL to clear the current definition slot, or DELALL to erase
  all definitions. With USE THIS you get back to the main settings.

@endnode
@node INSTALL "Install to HD or Floppy"


  Requirements:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   -> any Amiga
   -> memory: 380K chip, 320K fast to run, 188K disc space to install
   -> and Workbench 1.3 (or above) to run that thing... I'm not sure if
      the game runs with workbench 1.2 or lower. So please upgrade!


  Install to Hard disc:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Only copy all files into your "DiamChall" drawer. The editor looks
     for the "Levels" directory to load/save your created level files.


  Install to Floppy disc:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Not recommented. But if there is enough disc space on the disc
     copy all files into the same directory of the game. That's it.

       or

     You copy the editor on a formated and bootable disc and create
     a drawer named "Levels". Then you have enough free space to
     create lots of levels.

       or

     Read the game manual @{"instructions" link DC_ManualV1_3.Guide/INSTALL}.

@endnode
@node HINTS "How to test a level-set"

  For me it's very easy, because I have a separate game programm and can
  define which level to play to testing it. For you and all others I have
  two suggestions:

   a) Start with the last level, number 50. Then continue with level 49,
      and so on until you reach the first level. Creating the levels in
      reversed other is hard, so you may use the other way.

   b) Use one warp at level 1 near the start. Set the destination level
      to the next level you want to test, and use <ALWAYS FROM START> to
      enter the warp immediately.

  Limitations for some field types:

   picks: 400, bombs: 200, maps: 20, diamonds: 800, empty fields: 90%


  I guess all of you want to know: "Are there cheats for testing?"
  Short answer from me: "YES, there are cheats." But it would be very
  easy just to type them here.
  I've encoded the @{"cheat text" link CHEATS} with ROT13 for all characters with ASCII
  code between 33 and 126. Sorry, but programmers are prefered to decode
  the text. You can also configure GoldED or other text editors to do it.

@endnode
@node CHEATS "Cheast... ROT13 encoded..."

  Okay, you what to know the cheats of my game. You can decode this
  text, or send me @{"a gift" link INFOS} and I'll tell you the cheats.

  Write down all ASCII characters with value from 33 to 126. Leave some
  space under the list, because there you repeat all characters rotated
  up by 13 characters. If you reach character 126, don't forget to write
  the remaining characters at the beginning.

  Ex: 1) "!" value 33, add 13 equals 46, value for "."
      2) "v" value 118, add 13 equals 131 (too high), subtract 94 (this
         is the number of characters between 33 and 126), result is 37,
         value for "%".
      Summary: plain character "!" is encrypted here with "." and
               plain character "v" is encrypted here with "%", okay?
