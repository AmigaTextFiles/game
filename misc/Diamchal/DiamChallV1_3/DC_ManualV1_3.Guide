  I don't think you are reading this before starting the game, right ?
  Fine. And why do you read this after playing the game ? Some hints ?
  Some cheats ? No !!! That's just a short introduction for this game.

  After a nice animation the following main menu comes up:

                           @{"    START GAME    " link START}

                           @{"   Game Options   " link OPTIONS}

                           @{" Mix levels:  Off " link MIXED}

                           @{"View hiscore table" link HISCORE}

                           @{" Quit game to DOS " link QUIT}

  And now some more important options about the game and other stuff...

                         @{"-=>  Requirements  <=-" link REQUIRE}
                         @{"???  Legal  stuff  ???" link LEGAL}
                         @{"!!!  Installation  !!!" link INSTALL}
                         @{" Leveleditor!  Where? " link EDITOR}

  That's all. Now have fun with it and contact @{"me" link INFOS} if you found some tricky
  bugs or real stupid errors. I'm still human and can't check out every
  possible situation. But my beta tests cover at least 90 per cent. ;-))

@endnode
@node QUIT "Main Menu: Quit"

  Press fire here to quit back to Workbench (AmigaDOS), if you have enough
  of it. (I don't hope so!)

@endnode
@node HISCORE "Main Menu: Hiscore"

  Here you can see the actual hiscore for the currently loaded levels.
  There are 3 columns: the name of the player, the number of played
  levels and the game type. ("Mix" when mixed or "Off" for normal.)

  Press fire to quit back to main menu or wait 5 seconds.

@endnode
@node MIXED "Main Menu: Mix levels: On/Off"

  This option makes the game more exciting. The 'Mixed Off' mode is the
  normal playing mode (from level 1 to 50), but in 'Mixed On' mode all
  levels are mixed, so you may solve all levels in this direction:
    6, 14, 38, 1, 44, 42, 17, 30, 7, 26, 22, 50, 3, ...

  This also works with your created levels. So you never know which level
  comes next. If you solve all 50 levels this way you get a great bonus
  of... guess? ... No. More: 200000 points !!! You want more ? Why ?

  BTW: It works with warp fields too. It's somehow tricky. I recommend
       to use the warp field without mixing first. I try to explain it
       with this @{"example" link LEVELWARPS}.

@endnode
@node OPTIONS "Main Menu: Game Options"

  Here you can change some settings for the game. This includes loading
  your created levels, hiscore actions and in-game music settings. I'm
  sorry, but you have to use your mouse here. I've tested moving the
  mouse pointer with the joystick, but after a while it's very annoying.
  Especially when you add/delete music moduls. Let's have a closer look
  on the different parts of the option screen now:

  @{b}Levels:@{ub} This part shows informations about the loaded levels. First
          you have the level name with the date of the last modification.
      Under it you see the name of the creator of the levels. And you see
      these four buttons:

      @{i}Load Levels: @{ui}Opens the @{"file selector" link FSEL} and you can choose a new
                   level file. If it has to correct format, it will
          be loaded into memory. The black background flashes green if
          loading was successful else it flashes red. (Already loaded
          levles will not be changed.)

           >>> JUST USE MY EDITOR TO CREATE LEVELS! OR: "Guru..." <<<

          If a hiscore file exists it will be loaded and checked for
          correct hiscore data. Otherwise it will save and use the
          default hiscore.

          Note: Don't modify my default levels, if you have problems
                solving a level. I really check for it! But you can
                modify and save it with a different file name if you
                want to cheat...  ;-)

      @{i}Clear Hiscore: @{ui}Here you reset the hiscore to the default values.
                     You havee to confrim this action. The cleared
          hiscore will immediately be saved to disc! There is no way
          to recover the old hiscore! BE CAREFUL!

      @{i}Merge Hiscore: @{ui}This opens the @{"file selector" link FSEL} and you can select
                     a hiscore file to merge into the current hiscore.
          You may want to use this feature if you want to compete with
          your friends or exchange levels over the internet. The same
          warning applies here: You have to confirm this action. The
          new hiscore will be saved immediately!

      @{i}Export as ASCII: @{ui}Just an extra feature. Saves the current hiscore
                       as plain text with a ".ASC" extension. You find
          the file in the same directory of the current levels.

  @{b}Audio:@{ub} Prior to all the information here, I have to tell you that it's
         my first try to add music while playing the game. I know that
      it's obvious to play music in the game. But I'm NO MUSICIAN!!!
      So I thought: I can't create music, but I don't have to. You can
      use your favorite music modules. This is what you can do in this
      section. You are limited to 100 modules and your available memory.

      @{i}ADD: @{ui}Click to add a new module into the list. The @{"file selector" link FSEL}
           appears and you can browse your computer to select a module.
          Not all MOD formats are supported, but most of them are!
          If your module has been saved with a newer format, you should
          test this before you add all your modules. Just add this one
          module into the list and start the game. If you hear the music
          it's okay.

      @{i}DEL: @{ui}Simply removes the selected modul from the list.

      @{i}CLR: @{ui}Deletes all modules from the list. You can create new list.

      @{i}Arrows: @{ui}Scrolls through the list up and down. Between the arrows
              you see the total amount modules in the list.

      @{i}Module list: @{ui}Here you see the modules which will play during the
                   game. First you see the module number, the complete
          path of the file and the amount of memory in kilo bytes. The
          order of the modules is not important. The modules are played
          in random order. Click on a module to select it, if you want
          to remove it with the 'DEL' button.

      Below this block, you see another three buttons. They are important
      for the default settings after loading.

      @{i}Sounds: @{ui}Click this button to activate sounds or not.

      @{i}Music: @{ui}Use this button to activate music playing or not.

      @{i}Preload Music: @{ui}The most important button. If you have enough fast
                     memory you can preload your modules when starting
          the game or adding new modules with the 'ADD' button. It's
          very useful if you have no hard disc and have to load your
          modules from floppy disc. Only deactivate this feature if you
          are low on memory and can load the modules from hard disc.

  @{b}Memory:@{ub} Just an information about your available memory. To prevent
          memory troubles check the chip memory to have more than 512K
      plus the amount for your largest music module. You should have
      no problems with 2MB chip ram.

  Finally you have a "Save" button, where you save this configuration and
  an "Okay" button to just use the settings. If you want to use different
  configurations rename or clone the "DiamChall.Cfg" file. Thanks.

@node FSEL "Main Menu: About the file selector"

  The game with all data and the editor needs about 792K disc space.
  If you play the game from floppy you have not much room left for your
  created levels. So I've created a real file selector where you can
  browse your computer to load levels from any location. And I removed
  the assign "DCLevels:".
  Loading a new level set always starts with the subdirectory "Levels",
  so I suggest to store your levels in there.

  Just a short feature list, about my file selector:
    *) Click on file to select, second click to use and exit selector
    *) Click on a directory (marked with "(DIR)") changes into it
    *) Up/down arrows and a slider to scroll file list
    *) Click on selected file name to edit it
    *) fixed file pattern (not case sensitive) for required types,
       these are: - level sets: #?.LEV
                  - hiscore files: #?.SCR
                  - music modules: mod.#? or #?.mod
    *) button "Assign" lists all devices and assigns
    *) button "Root" directly jumps to root directory
    *) button "Parent" moves one directory level up (until root)
    *) finally click button "Okay" to use, or "Cancel" to abort

  The directory path display can't be edited, sorry. You don't really
  need to do that.

  If you play levels from a floppy disc unprotect it, and don't remove
  or change the disc while playing. A new hiscore will be saved to it.

  CAUTION! Some faulty floppy drives confuses the system. If you have
           one, after some years of usage, please make sure that the
  drive correctly recognized the exchange!
  The game will fail if there is no disc physically present in the
  drive, but the system didn't recognize this. Unfortunately I could
  test this!  8-((

@node START "Main Menu: Start the game"

  Here you tart to play. At the bottom the score board appears:

      +------------------------+------+------+------+------+-----+
      | S C O R E     00000000 |       K   E   Y   S       |     |
      +------------------------+------+------+------+------+BONUS|
      | D I A M O N D S    000 | T I M E 000 |TOOLS |LIVES |     |
      +------------------------+-------------+------+------+-----+

  Now more details:

    @{i}SCORE: @{ui}Shows your actual amount of @{"points" link POINTS}.

    @{i}DIAMONDS: @{ui}Holds the left amount of diamonds you still have to collect
      or a 'b' appears to tell you the amount of collected bonus diamonds.

    @{i}TIME: @{ui}Displays your left time to solve the level in seconds.

    @{i}KEYS: @{ui}Shows how much red, yellow, green and blue keys you have left to
      open red, yellow, green and blue doors.

    @{i}TOOLS: @{ui}Displays your selected tools to use with the fire button.
      There are four possible tools: fire bullet, picks, bombs and maps.
      Use the <Space-Bar> to change your active tool.

    @{i}LIVES: @{ui}Displays your left lives. If this number has reached zero, the
      next failure will quit the game. The following things can kill you:

        *) out of time
        *) hit explosion of a bomb
        *) moving on empty field without activated pick
        *) and, of course, collision with baddies

    @{i}BONUS: @{ui}This is the bonus display. At the top is the display of your
      collected gems in the four colours red (=ruby), green (=emerald),
      blue (=aquamarine) and yellow (=topaz).
      Under it you see the current @{"bonus item" link BONUSITEM} with a direection where to
      find it. Left to it you have a blue timer for the freeze bonus and
      right to it is the red timer for your shield. If you enter a new
      level you have a shield for 6 seconds, or if you loose a live you
      get a shield for 4 seconds. And after beaming you have a shield
      for just 1 second. Use this to kill baddies near the transporter.

  Now the game area above shows you which level comes next. Press fire to
  enter it. A limited display area appears and shows only some surrounding
  fields. Use the joystick to move through the different @{"fields" link FIELDS}.

  Your aim is to collect all required diamonds which will make an exit
  door appear. Sometimes you can collect more diamonds. Then a 'B' will be
  added and shows the amount of collected bonus diamonds.

  On some levels there exists one or more warp fields. They are active
  from the start or appear with the exit when all diamonds are collected.
  You can use them to skip some levels, ex: jump from level 3 to level 12.
  But beware: There are also some backward jumps! If you use a warp field
  all bonus points will count less points than using the exit door.

  From level 7 on (in 'Mix Off' mode) baddies appear and make all levels
  more tricky or even harder! There are three types:

    *) @{i}Hat: @{ui}Fast baddy. Don't get too close. Moves randomly.

    *) @{i}Ghost: @{ui}Slow baddy. Follows the player. So shoot them very soon.

    *) @{i}Flame: @{ui}Slow baddy. You need many shoots to kill. Moves randomly.

  You may need the keyboard near the joystick. There are some keys you
  need during the game:

    *) M ....... toggles music on/off
    *) S ....... toggles sound effects on/off
    *) P ....... pause game; playing area will be hidden
    *) ESC ..... quit game to main menu and checks for hiscore
    *) DEL ..... give up current attempt (kill you) and restart level
    *) Space ... change active tool; there are four possible settings:

       - Shoot bullet: Press fire to shoot at the baddies. Only one
         bullet is allowed, so be careful. You can't shoot walls, doors,
         icy curves or baddy homes.

       - Use a pick: Hold fire button while moving to use a pick and
         walk over empty fields.

       - Set bomb: Press fire to set a bomb and explode the 3 by 3 fields
         around it. You have 5 seconds to leave this area. Baddies will
         also be killed if they get into the explosion!

       - View map: draws a small map of the level. Your position will be
         displayed as red-yellow flashing colour and all existing baddies
         are displayed as green flashing colour. You have 10 seconds left
         to get 100 extra points. After that every 2 seconds this extra
         points will be reduced by 5. So after another 40 seconds you get
         no extra points. And after that your score will be decreased !!!

  At the end of each level left tools and time will count as bonus score.
  You get extra points for everything except maps. You keep them through
  the whole game. A final report shows you how much bonus points you got.
  Press fire to go on to the next level.

  That's all. At the end for the game you can enter your name, if you've
  reached a new hiscore. Each level set has its own hiscore list. It will
  be loaded when you load new levels and saved at once.

  If you have no hiscore you see the game informations. Additionally the
  second line always shows some statistics who many bullets you've fired,
  how many baddies you've killed and your resulting shot accuracy.

  @{b}NOTE:@{ub} Disable the 'write protection' when playing from floppy.
        Otherwise the game won't save new hiscores!

@node BONUSITEM "Game: Bonus Items"

  Quite frequently a bonus appears on a normal field. Here is a list
  of all available items. In general items at the top appear more often
  than the ones at the bottom, but there are still some differences.

    cherry ................ 100 points
    apple ................. 250 points
    coca cola ............. 500 points
    hamburger ............. 1000 points
    red gem ............... \\
    green gem .............  |_ 200 points; collect all for 5 lives;
    blue gem ..............  |  if you already have a gem you lose it
    yellow gem ............ /
    red hourglass ......... 15 seconds
    yellow hourglass ...... 40 seconds
    green hourglass ....... 90 seconds
    frozen jet of water.... freezes baddy moves; they're easy to kill
    shield ................ protects against baddies, but not bombs!
    multiple explosions ... kills just all baddies on display
    one great explosion ... kills really all baddies on the level
    clock ................. +2 seconds for "freeze" and "shield" bonus
                            of the current level, and +1 second for all
                            following levels!
    green exit door ....... get out of the level; but less bonus points
    diamonds .............. you get 4 extra diamonds!
    extra life ............ ;-) What could that be ?
    box of presents ....... 0 to 3 random items listed above

  Think quick if it is worth to hunt for the bonus. A new bonus item
  stays for 15 up to 75 seconds. It may disappear just if you are about
  to take it. >>> "Damn! Just time lost! ;-(("

  GOOD LUCK! And don't forget to solve a level. It's faster than just
  running for bonus items and waiting for the exit.

@node LEVELWARPS "DANGER! Warping with mixed level..."

  Let's say there is a warp from level 4 to level 15. Let me call
  level 4 the source level and level 15 the destination level. Okay.

  First problem: You don't know when the source level appears. If the
    source level (here number 4) has been mixed to a position after
    its original position (let's say 22) then you will warp backwards!

    This could also used in the other direction, which is very good:
    the original level 34 with a warp to level 46 has been mixed into
    position 3. You will actually warp from level 3 to the level which
    has been mixed into position 46.

  Second problem: You don't know the destination level and also the
    following levels. These levels can be harder than the levels after
    the source level. The next level after the source level may also
    have a warp to 'higher' levels.

    Let's add a warp from level 9 to level 28. While playing level 4
    appears in first position, level 9 in second position. Let's say
    in positions 15 to 18 you may have these levels: 42,37,22,47. And
    in positions 28 to 30 these levels appear: 11,31,8.
    Would you use the warp from level 4 ? NO, of course not! The levels
    from position 15 to 18 are much harder and may be skipped with the
    warp from level 9 which would come next.

  Summary: Warpes are unpredictable when you mix the levels. In fact
    it's possible to create a circle. But you can collect much points!

@endnode
@node REQUIRE "What do I need for this game"

  I don't know exactly what are the minimum requirements, but if your
  amiga satisfies the following options the game should work fine:

  *) Processor: 68030/25Mhz - I don't know about lower types. Try it.
  *) Memory: 1 MB chip, 512K fast (better 1 MB or more), 602K disc.
  *) Workbench/Kickstart: 3.0 - But I think 1.3 should be enough.

  If the games doesn't work at all, please send @{"me" link INFOS} an e-mail that I can
  update the requirements to save others lots of work. Thanx.

@node INSTALL "Install to HD or Floppy"


  Hard disc:
  ~~~~~~~~~~
    Only copy all files into your desired drawer.


  Floppy disc:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
    First copy all files in the root directory of a bootable disc and
    create one suitable "s/startup-sequence":

     - boot game only:
         DiamChallV1_31

     - boot editor only:
         DC_EditorV1_3

     - boot selection:
         ECHO "Welcome to Diamond Challenge V1.31"
         LAB Loop
         ASK "Start editor (y/n) ?"
         IF WARN
           DC_EditorV1_3
         ELSE
           DiamChallV1_31
         ENDIF
         SKIP Loop BACK

       Don't forget to add all required commands from your workbench
       disk: ECHO, ASK, IF, ELSE, ENDIF and SKIP.

     - boot to workbench:
         LOADWB
         ENDCLI

       Don't forget to add all required commands from your workbench
       disk: LOADWB and ENDLCI. Refer to your Workbench manual ;-)
       for additional files. This depends on your workbench version.

    That's it. Contanct @{"me" link INFOS}, if you have problems.


  WinUAE and other Amiga emulators:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Hmmm... I just about to buy a PC, so I couldn't test this by mself.
    In general follow the 'floppy disc' installation above. If you need
    help, contact me and I will create a booting disc for you. Always
    copy my default level files "DEFAULT.LEV" and "DEFAULT.SCR" on the
    game disc.

    If you want to create new levels with my editor, create a seperate
    disc with the editor on it, or make a selection before you start
    a program. If you use a different level file from another disc
    insert the disc with the game disc. Otherwise the game can't load
    your levels and will use the default levels.

    If you want to use music modules use the preload option and insert
    floppy discs with the music modules on them. Use different names
    for the discs, like "DCMusic1", "DCMusic2", and so on.

    Of course I will try this as soon as possible. There will always be
    an AMIGA EMULATOR on any PC I will buy.  !!! AMIGA RULEZ !!!

@node EDITOR "How to create your own levels"

  Hmmm, I don't know what to say about that. I could explain how the
  levels are saved to disc and you could create your own editor to do
  the job. Not very realistic, isn't it ?  ;-))  Okay, I'm joking.

  So you probably will use my editor. Don't try to crack my level files
  and/or hiscore files. You will crash your Amiga !!! The editor is
  giftware, so please send @{"me" link INFOS} something:

   - postcard from *YOUR* locality (not from your recent holidays!!!)
   - some money (global currencies: US-dollar, EURO, brit. pounds,...)
   - music CD's (pop music from the 80's prefered, NO HARD ROCK!)
   - latest Amiga magazines, science fiction books (german, english)
   - new AMIGAONE, FLAT TV-SET, FERRARI,...  ;-))

  Thanks. You may want know how to create levels, so click @{"here" link DC_EditorV1_3.Guide/MAIN}.

                Are there any music composers out there ?
     I want to add some addictive tunes to the title and hiscore screen.
         Anybody contact me via e-mail if you have/know some music.

  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯


  Bugs:
 ~~~~~~~
  *) display flickers
     -> Stop other programms in the background.
     -> Else: start the game from floppy.
     -> Else: count the number of visible baddies! Values greater 14-16
        aren't my fault: the blitter is too slow! I don't use hardware
        sprites and won't change it, sorry.  8-((

  *) no mouse pointer at option screen:
     -> On higher AmigaOS versions the AmigaDos window don't appear
        if no output is generated while startup. So the system may not
        initialize the mouse pointer correctly. (?)
        Insert something like "cls" or "echo Loading..." in the top of
        the startup-sequence to make the AmigaDOS window and the mouse
        pointer appear. (Never happens if you load the game from WB.)
