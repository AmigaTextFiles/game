				  SlotCars

This program is not public domain, not shareware, and not really just a
demo...it is the complete working game of SlotCars...just one of four
games in the commercial package known as:

			    4 IN ONE - EASY BUT FUN!

For only $14.95, you will receive not just more levels or screens, but
three more complete and totally different games all integrated under the
Master Control Panel. The game concepts are simple but addictive. (The
opening advertising screen is also eliminated in the complete package.)

CircuitMania - For 1 or 2 players, you try to surround your opponent in
	       a maze of wires. Use mouse, joystick or keyboard.

ShufflePuzzle - Like the sliding number puzzles that you used to play as
		a kid but this game uses beautiful color pictures.
		Twelve different puzzles!

Follow That Tune - Follow the bouncing boy as he jumps from pedestal to
		   pedestal playing a tune. Great memory training for
		   kids!

All games feature graphics and digitized sound and include complete
typeset instructions. Fun for all ages! This package recently retailed
for $29.95 but you may order direct for only $14.95!
