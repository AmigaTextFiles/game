KidSTOP Features

Kids of every age can quickly master the KidSTOP interface. KidSTOP
enables even very young toddlers to easily interact with vivid and
colorful educational games and a variety of other entertaining
activities.  KidSTOP is sure to make a big hit with any child using your
Amiga.

KidSTOP Village Menu

After the introduction, the program's features are available by means of
the animated KidSTOP Village scene.  Each of the buildings and objects in
the village represents a menu selection that begins an activity.  For
example, touching the airport starts an activity called TravelToons, and
touching the museum starts the Coloring Book.

Touching the page corner icon in the upper right edge of any activity
reveals new scenes or modes, and touching the school bus icon always
returns to the village.

KidSTOP was originally designed for touch screen operation, but mouse,
joystick and keyboard support has been added for the home user version.
The joystick interface is activated by running the included JoyRide
program.  This option is ideal for toddlers who are unfamiliar with the
mouse or keyboard.  Each movement of the joystick or press of the button
causes a random action to occur in any activity.  Similar action is
produced for most keys with the following exceptions: pressing the escape
key is the same as selecting the bus icon, and pressing any of the cursor
(or arrow) keys is the same as the page turn icon.

Following is a description of the activities:

TravelToons

TravelToons, accessed through the airport, contain various scenes for
interactive exploration.  Touching items reveals clever, humorous
animations and interesting sound effects.  Each playful scene encourages
exploration.  For example, in "Under the Sea," selecting the clamshell
causes it to open and a colorful school of fish emerges.  Other scenes
include "Around the Jungle," "In the Garden," "At the Ally," and "On the
Ranch."

PlanetPeople

PlanetPeople is reached by using the rocket ship.  Mix and match aliens
from different planets while hearing various sounds of their "language."

Count-a-Bunch

Through the schoolhouse, Count-a-Bunch floats a random number of colorful
objects across the screen.  The objective is to count the objects and
select that number.  Each correct answer helps to complete the animated
sequence depicted at the bottom of the screen.

Keyboard Fun

The veranda with the piano leads to the Keyboard Fun activity. Here,
various sounds can be played using a piano keyboard such as a flute, a
dog, drums, a bird, and more.

ABC-123

ABC-123 teaches the alphabet, numbers, and simple shapes.

MatchIt

The Amusement Park leads to the MatchIt Game where the object is to find
matching pairs of related objects.  Finding matching cards animates the
pictures with delightful graphics and creative sound effects.  At the
beginning levels children match identical pictures but the difficulty of
play increases as children learn synonyms, opposites, and animal classes.

Ripple Machine

The fountain is the access point for the Ripple Machine. Colorful ripples
of various shapes and sizes can be propagated on the screen.

Coloring Book

The museum leads to the Coloring Book.  This activity has lots of
charming outlines and drawings to color.  Selecting a color and touching
the area fills it in.  Colors can also be filled over one another or
erased.

GreenHouse Interactive Inc

KidSTOP was developed by GreenHouse Interactive Inc of Orem, Utah.  The
original release was a complete entertainment system based on the Amiga
CD32 platform, and included custom housing and a touch screen monitor.
The system was typically sold to hospitals, dentists, daycare centers,
and anywhere large numbers of children could be found with little to do.
KidSTOP is the perfect system for any situations where children play,
learn, or need to be occupied while waiting.  The software was not
available separately for home use.  With the unfortunate demise of
Commodore, a decision was made to re-code the project for IBM compatible
computers.  Now that the PC based system has been completed and is
shipping, GreenHouse has graciously made the Amiga version available to
the home user at a very affordable price.

For more information about KidSTOP and current system pricing and
options, please contact GreenHouse Productions at (801) 224-0086 or send
