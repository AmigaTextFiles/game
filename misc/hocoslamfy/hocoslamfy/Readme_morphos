You are a small bee and you must fly to avoid the bamboo shoots!

MorphOS port by bitRocky

I also made some changes:
29-Jan-2018:
  - made changes to the DATA_PATH for MorphOS
  - don't fail if BGM fails to load, just don't play BGM
    because sometimes loading BGM fails, don't know why
  - added an icon from data/bee.png
  - added support for pressing any mousebutton to jump and enter the game
  - the highscore is now saved in the current dir
  - don't print "successfully" commands, only if something failed
