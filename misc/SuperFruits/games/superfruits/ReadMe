Quick docs for SuperFruits, a freeware effort. 21/8/97.

SuperFruits is a game written in AMOS by Paul West. Most of the coding was
done in 1993, at which time the game had no sound. Additional sound
programming has been done in 1997 plus some minor tweaks. The game is not
exactly `AGA' by any means but will require well over 1MB of chip ram.
Basically it will run on an A1200. Fastmem is not especially needed.
Accelerators are also not needed as the game was originally written to run
`normally' on an A500. It runs fine on my 68040/25Mhz with 32MB FastRam,
and should run equally well on a stock A1200.

SuperFruits.Anim needs to be in the same directory as the program
`SuperFruits'. Both of those files and this doc are Copyright (c) 1993-1997
Paul West, and I accept absolutely no responsibility for any damage that the
game might cause. If you suffer epilepsy it's best not to play as almost
everything is flashing lights (especially the jackpot).

The program looks for the font: Diamond 12. It should be in FONTS:Diamond/12
and the file FONTS:Diamond.font should also be available. I have included
them in the archive, install them yourself!

Play is fairly simple, input is via mouse and keyboard.

   To start playing press ANY key (including mouse).

   Two menu's will come up, just use the keyboard to set the options.
   If in doubt press [Y] and [Y] again to accept the default options.
   You can have up to 4 players, a maximum amount to spend, and how much
   each player spends before it is the next player's turn. You then enter
   the name of each player, up to 7 characters. 7 is pushing it a bit, 6
   will appear tidier.

   You use the mouse to control the buttons in the game. Most things require
   a single click except for the `spin' button of the fortune wheel which
   requires you to click and hold for as long as you want it to spin, and
   then to release the button when you want the wheel to stop.

   The word "SUPERFRUITS" at the top of the screen does various functions
   Basically light up all the letters. The number of lights to light up is
   the sum of the little numbers on some of the fruits such as bananas (3).
   Light up the "SUPER" on its own and you enter a special lucky-dip!!!
   Often the position of the lights will `hold' rather than being reset.

   The idea is as usual to get 2 or 3 fruits of the same type next to each
   other. If you only get 2 they have to be in the leftmost reels. The
   `star' fruits will work as for all others except that you can also get
   three of them, one per column, not necessarily in the middle of the
   window. `Spin' gets you a 10p onto your credit so basically is a free go.
   The `?' duplicates whatever is to the left, and if you get three of them
   it chooses a totally random fruit (could be lucky!). `Respin' just does
   a small respin and `free nudge' lets you nudge a reel one place.
   Jackpots are won with three '7's. Most of the fruits and much of the
   game is actually based on the old `Fruit Machine' that I used to play on
   the Amstrad CPC464.

   If you get 2 or 3 fruits, or light up all the "SUPERFRUITS" lights, you
   will enter gamble mode.

   The lights [1] [2] and [3] flash in sequence, you have to stop the light
   when [3] is illuminated to win the gamble and move up to the next level.
   Each level you get to has a certain money value, nudge value, and
   `special' value. Beware that the accompanying sound is intentionally
   offputting so you need to concentrate.

   To take the special level you've got to, which will be listed at the
   bottom of the screen, press the [S] key on the keyboard. Alternatively
   press [N] for nudges (number of which is in the top right corner) or [C]
   to show the order in which the fruits are on the reels for [c]heating at
   nudges. If you gamble all the way up to the highest level you get a
   jackpot!

   The types of [s]pecial gambles are as follows:
      - 10p    - None
      - 20p    - None
      - 30p    - None
      - 40p    - Skill Reflex    - Stop the lights when all 5 are lit
      - 50p    - Number Climb    - Adds up numbers on the fruits and awards
                                   for rows and columns
      - 70p    - Stop and match  - When it stops, it matches three of that
                                   kind of fruit
      - £1     - 3 of a kind     - Gives you 3 of one kind and the relevant
                                   money value
      - 1.50   - Get Rich Quick  - Stop the light on blue or orange lights,
                                   blue is worth less than orange!
                                   To cheat, land on an orange and keep the
                                   mouse button held down for a while
      - £2     - Lucky dip       - Luck of the draw, stop and hope
      - £3     - Two autowins    - Two automatic wins
      - £5     - Fortune Wheel   - Click on `spin' and hold the mouse
                                   button down. When you want the spin to
                                   stop, release the mouse.
      - £10    - Five autowins   - Five automatic wins
      - £25    - jackpot         - Win the jackpot

   The above prices are what you get if you `take', aka `collect'. As you
   get to the next special level the number of nudges you've got increases.
   I can't remember if there are unlimited nudges or not, I think they go
   up to 11. If you gamble and lose you `take' the money value of the next
   lowest level.

   Quite often there is an automatic `hold', which you can toggle on and
   off with complete control. Normal `hold' works the same. The key [C] for
   listing the reel order only works when you've pressed [N] for nudge
   mode. C=Cheat mode, basically.

   The value of each type of fruit will become evident with time. I can't
   remember what the order is, but as usual bars and bells are big-winners
   and 7's are the jackpot.

   The rest is pretty much self-evident.

   Just play the game, it's really quite simple. It's not extremely
   polished but it can be fun. BTW `Superfruits.Anim' is a 100-frame,
   2-colour (1 bitplane) anim done in DPaintIII. The game should still run
   if it cannot find it.

   There is a MINOR graphical bug in the first menu, in that after you've
   played at least 1 game and you go into the menu one of the colours will
   be black instead of something else. It has no effect on functionality.

Enjoy. :)
