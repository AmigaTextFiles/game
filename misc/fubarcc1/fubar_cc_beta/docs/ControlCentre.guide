@{b}NOTE@{ub}

Remember  that  the  CC  is  in  a beta stage of development.  Anything can
change,  and  there  may be significant differences between this and future
revisions.   I  will  try to make sure these differences are recognised, by
placing a @{bg shine}!NEW FOR V0.0!@{bg background} at the top of the node.

@{bg shine}We  are  looking  for  a  publisher!@{bg background}   This  release might not be enough to
convince  you, but we lack a graphics artist, therefore we have no graphics
to show.

If  you are a graphics artist, or would be interested in knowing more about
FUBAR  to publish it, @{b}please@{ub} e-mail 101330.1207@compuserve.com or phone (in
the UK) 01296 25654 and ask for Andrew.  (Note that graphics artist MUST be
in the UK)

@remark Oh Gawd.  This bit is really boring.  Of course, if you want to use
@remark CC properly than I suppose you really need to read it.  Oh, since
@remark you're not using AmigaGuide, you'll need to fill in the RegForm.txt
@remark file.  But, with your amazing powers of suduction I'm sure you've
@remark already worked that out.

@remark It took me ages to work this out.  I hate that legal stuff.  Yeeh.

@node "Distribution" "Distribution Rights and Registration"

The Control Centre (CC) has been declared at the current stage as freeware,
which  means  the program can be distributed freely around the world to any
Amiga user.

CC,  as it stands, has had the saving features removed.  This is because CC
is  beta  software,  meaning it could change at any time, also meaning that
the   version   of   CC  you  possess  may  be  out-of-date  and  therefore
incompatible.   Saving is enabled by use of a keyfile, which is sent to you
when you register the program.

                        @{b}@{fg shine}NOTE: Registering is FREE!@{ub}@{fg text}

Upon  registering, you will be sent a keyfile for use with the beta version
of  CC  (via  e-mail)  which  will  allow  saving.  You are not required to
register  the  program  if  you  just  want  to  see  what CC is all about.
Remember  as  with all keyfiles, do not distribute them onto other people -
even your friends!  Each keyfile has a signature allowing easy trace of the
original owner.

@{b}How to Register@{ub}

Please  send  an  e-mail  to  Oondy  at @{fg shine}101330.1207@compuserve.com@{fg text}, putting
"Register  CC" in your subject header.  Fill out this @{" form " link "RegForm.txt/main" 0} which contains
information  required  by  Q-Group  to register you as a beta tester.  This
data  is  used  for  registering  purposes only, and will in no way be made
publically available.

I  must  apologise  for  this  restriction  but  if  FUBAR  is  to become a
successful  commercial  development,  all  outside  user activities must be
recorded as this might hinder future plans.

Current offical beta testers are listed below:

 · Tim Stubbs           <dangel@angeldos.demon.co.uk>
 · Ian Gledhill         <img4@aber.ac.uk>
 · Ross Liversidge      <101367.1024@compuserve.com>

@remark Now we're getting somewhere "exciting".  We can start blahing on
@remark about the program itself.  Always helpful, considering that's what
@remark the point of this file is.  Hmmm.. 

@node "WhatIsCC" "What is CC?"

CC (The Control Centre) is a program designed to make FUBAR as customisable
as possible.  The program has the following features:

  · Entire worlds can be created in CC for play in FUBAR.
  · CC has functions for preparing data files (be it Worlds, objects, etc.)
    to be distributed around other FUBAR players (like uploading onto the
    Internet, or creating level disks).
  · Complete editors for each aspect of the game:
    - World Map Editor
    - Level Editor
    - Sound Effects Editor
    - Cut Scene Editor
    - Image Bank Editor
    - Object, Weapon and Vehicle Editors
  · CC also features a plug-in system allowing additional tools to be
    incorporated.
  · An easy-to-use graphical user interface
  · Works on any Amiga with at least Workbench 2.04.

@{i}BETA  NOTE:   Since  this  is  beta  software at the moment, anything could
happen,  which  means  that  there  will  be  no doubt in this list getting
larger...@{ui}

@endnode

@remark Hey, you need this.  Yes, you do.  No, really.  I insist.

@node "SystemReqs" "System Requirements"

Since  FUBAR,  the game itself, can be run on a standard A500+, the CC does
also.

  · Requires Workbench 2.04 or higher.
  · 1MB of RAM.

Bear  in mind that the CC runs best from a hard disk.  Floppy disks are not
directly  supported,  so you may find yourself doing a little disk-swapping
if you do not have a second disk drive.

If  you  are  using  a  CD32  or playing from a CD-ROM, you will definately
require  a  floppy disk drive or hard disk to save data.  It is impractical
to  save  to  the  non-volitile  RAM on the CD32, and therefore will not be
allowed.

A recommended setup for FUBAR and the CC is as follows:

  · Workbench 3.x
  · 2MB of RAM
  · CD-ROM drive
  · Hard disk
  · AGA chipset or graphics card and a decent monitor

@endnode

@remark This is really great stuff.  Perhaps I could make it automatically
@remark start the installation program when using floppy disks... hmmm...
@remark I suppose that'll wait until the game is finished.  Always useful.
@remark I am boasting a bit really about the CD32 support on this.  But,
@remark since we *REALLY* want to do a CD version (indeed, maybe over a 
@remark floppy version) I thought I'd better get that blatent plug in, since
@remark we are looking for a game publisher!! (hint hint)

@node "Installation" "Installing CC"

Since  the CC is distributed with the main FUBAR game, it will be necessary
to install it to a medium before you can use it properly.

@{b}INSTALLING FROM FLOPPY DISK@{ub}

The  CC  is compressed in LZH (or LHA) format on the last disk.  There is a
standard  Amiga  Installer  installation  script  on the same disk, so just
double-click it from Workbench or Shell.

Follow  the  on-screen  instructions,  and  it will allow you to install to
another floppy disk or a hard disk.

@{b}INSTALLING FROM CD-ROM@{ub} (CD32 instructions follow)

The CC is available to launch from the CD.  You will need to load Workbench
first.

Double-click  the  CC  icon  in  the  main  (root) directory of the CD from
Workbench  and the CC program icon and related documentation and data files
will be displayed.

Ideally,  it  is  best  installed to a hard disk.  To do so, open your hard
disks  main  directory in Workbench, find somewhere to put it (in the FUBAR
directory,  for example), and click-and-drag the CC directory icon from the
CD onto the destination window.  CC will be installed.

@{b}CD32 NOTES@{ub}

Since  the CD32 version is the same as the CD-ROM version, the CC directory
appears in the main directory of the disk from Workbench as well.  Although
the  CD32  does  not  come  supplied with Workbench, you may not be able to
access it.  You @{i}can@{ui} run the program, thankfully.

  1.  Switch on (or reset) your CD32 with the FUBAR CD in the drive.
  2.  As the game begins to load, @{b}hold down the yellow button.@{ub}
  3.  The CC should shortly follow, instead of the actual game.

Of  course, if you have an SX-1 or SX-32 expansion with a hard disk, follow
the same instructions for installing from a CD-ROM.

@endnode

@remark Ah, yes.  How to use the program.  Not that its not obvious, but
@remark if that was the case, I really wouldn't need to write this doc.
@remark Humph.

@node "GStarted" "Getting Started with CC"

This  section  details  the basics of using the CC.  It even features a few
tutorials to guide you into using it.

@remark Ah, so you don't know how to use Workbench?

@node "Starting" "Starting the Control Centre"

Before the program can be started, it would help if it were @{" installed " link "Installation" 0}.

@{b}FROM WORKBENCH@{ub}

Just  double-click the FUBAR_CC icon in the CC directory.  The program will
start.   If  running  from  floppy,  it  can  take  a  few moments to load,
especially on a slow computer.

@{b}FROM SHELL@{ub}

In your Shell window, CD to the CC directory, and type

  Run FUBAR_CC

..   and  press  return.   The  CC currently supports the following command
line:

  FUBAR_CC WORLDNAME

 where:

  WORLDNAME:  The name of the World to load upon startup.

@{i}BETA  NOTE:  Further command line options will become available as the beta
stage progresses.@{ui}

@endnode

@node "WhatIsWorld" "What is a World?"

Essentially, a  World is a collection of @{" objects " link "Object" 0}, @{" vehicles " link "Vehicle" 0}, @{" weapons " link "Weapon" 0},
@{" maps " link "Map" 0},  @{" countries " link "Country" 0},  sounds  and  @{" images " link "Image" 0}  which  make  up  the  whole
worldwide  battlefield  of  which  the  player  must  conquer  in the game.
Everything in the World is connected in some form or other.

In context to the game, the game starts by reading in the World data.  This
is followed by loading the World map image and the countries are drawn upon
it.   Each  player is alotted a certian amount of vehicles and weapons, and
positioned  on  the  World  map.   Various  options  on the World map allow
trading  and  creation of extra vehicles and weapons which are specified in
the World.

When  two players meet and begin a battle, they fight on the map assoicated
with  the setting for the country on the World map.  The map is loaded, the
objects  are placed and the players vehicles are positioned using images to
represent them.  As a battle progresses, various statistics of vehicles and
weapons degrade, until one side no longer exists.

Of  course,  sounds  also  get  played when various events happen, and each
object, vehicle and weapon can have their own animation.

That's  effectively all you really need to know about the overall structure
of a World.

On  a  more  general  scale, each World is part of the Universe (which is a
level disk to you and me).

@endnode

@node "Object" "What is an Object?"

An object is something which appears on a level map, but the players cannot
directly  control  its  behaviour.   Such  examples of an object would be a
tree, a stone, a puddle, a weather cloud, etc..

Objects  appear  to  be motionless, up until a certian event occurs.  These
events  are  described below, including what can potentially happen when it
does occur:

 Event        | Description             | What can happen when it occurs

@node "Vehicle" "What is a Vehicle?"

A  vehicle  is something the player and directly control in the game.  This
can  be anything from a single little man (or woman) to a huge galaxy-class
starship.

Since a vehicle is controllable by the player, various variables need to be
set to make each vehicle individual.  These variables are explained below:

 Variable      | Range     | Description
---------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------
 Name          |           | The name for this vehicle.
---------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------
 Max. Speed    | 0 - 500   | The maximum speed this vehicle can travel at.
               |           | You can set this to zero to make the vehicle,
               |           | for example, a stationary turret.
---------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------
 Crew Needed   | 0 - 8     | How many crew members the vehicle needs to
               |           | operate.
---------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------
 Max. Armour   | 0% - 200% | The percentage of armour this vehicle is
               |           | allowed.
---------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------
 Maintenance   | $500-5000 | How much it costs to repair the vehicle for
               |           | an extra 25% of armour per maintenance.  In
               |           | the game, if the vehicle has 77% the vehicle
               |           | cannot be repaired until it has less than 75%.
               |           | It's just nasty, that's all :)
---------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------
 Water Mode    |           | What type(s) of water can the vehicle use.
               |           | These are:
               |           | - "Not Allowed": loses armour when in water
               |           | - "Shallow Only": OK in shallow else lose arm.
               |           | - "Water Only": must be in non-shallow water
               |           | - "Any": okay in any situation
---------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------
 Crew Level    |           | What level/rank the crew must have achieved
               |           | before they can use this vehicle (and
               |           | therefore the player can use).  These are:
               |           | - "Any": doesn't matter
               |           | - "Captian/Major/General & Up": obvious really
---------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------
 Can Fly       | Yes/No    | Can this vehicle fly?  If yes...
---------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------
 Can Land      | Yes/No    | ... can the vehicle land?  If not, it crashes
               |           | when it hits ground.
---------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------
 Weapon        |           | What weapon does this vehicle have when it is
               |           | first built.
---------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------

@node "Weapon" "What is a Weapon?"

Strangely enough, a weapon in FUBAR is much like a weapon in real life - an
object or instrument used in fighting.  A weapon can be anything from a pea
shooter to a huge 20,000 gigatonne nuclear weapon.

As with a vehicle, a weapon also has variables.  These are listed below
with their descriptions:

 Variable      | Range     | Description
---------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------
 Name          |           | Name of the weapon.
---------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------
 Range         | 10%-200%  | The maximum range of the weapon before it
               |           | hits the ground or disintegrates.  This is
               |           | how far, in a relative position expressed as
               |           | a percentage, the weapon can glide through the
               |           | air or water.
---------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------
 Accuracy      | 5% - 100% | The ratio on how exact - depending on other
               |           | factors - the weapon hits its approximated
               |           | target.  Such factors could be wind, gravity,
               |           | etc..
---------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------
 Self-exploding| Yes/No &  | Whether or not the weapon is self-exploding.
               | 1 - 10s   | If it is, a delay expressed in seconds, is 
               |           | counted after which the weapon will explode.
               |           | If it is not, the weapon will reach its
               |           | target and do nothing.  There is a random
               |           | factor on this when the game runs, as to
               |           | such whether or not the weapon becomes a dud.
---------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------
 Explode on    | Yes/No    | Should the weapon explode when it hits
 Impact        |           | something (could be anything not necessarily
               |           | its designated target) or whether it should

@node "Map" "What is a Map?"

A map is a level map.  So, what's a level map?

A  level  map is simply an arrangement of @{" images " link "Image" 0} that represent a country
in a World map.  Many games use them to create the scenery and surroundings
of a level.

A  map  is  divided  up  into  tiles, which is a 16 by 16 pixel square with
various  properties  attached  to  each  tile.  Each tile has the following
properties:

 Property        | Description
-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------
 Image           | A graphical @{" image " link "Image" 0} of the specific tile on the map.
-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------
 Surface         | Defines each tile as to what type of area it is, for
                 | example, grass, water, snow, swamp, etc..
-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------

@{i}BETA NOTE:  This property list may grow in future beta releases.@{ui}

On  the World map, there are @{" countries " link "Country" 0}.  Each country is assigned a level
map,  upon  which  the battle between two players occurs - that's how level
map and World maps are linked.

@endnode

@node "Country" "What is a Country?"

In  the actual game, each player must try to conquer the whole World.  This
is  done  by capturing each individual country, which may be owned by other
players.   Each  player  must have at least one country, otherwise they are
declared non-existant.

From  a  CC  point  of view, each country is assoicated with a @{" level map " link "Map" 0}.
Each   country  also  has  various  characteristics,  for  example  weather
settings,  day/night  times,  number of resources, its cities and villages,
etc..

@{i}BETA NOTE:  This section will be expanded.@{ui}

@endnode

@node "Image" "What is an Image?"

An  image is basically a small picture, which can be up to 32 by 32 pixels.
Paint packages also call them brushes.

In  the  CC,  there  is  a  thing  called  an Image Bank.  This is really a
collection  of  200  or  so  different  images,  all  using the same colour
palette.  Every image can be used in @{" object " link "Object" 0}, @{" vehicle " link "Vehicle" 0} and @{" weapon " link "Weapon" 0} animations,
tile graphics for @{" level maps " link "Map" 0}, and for placing on the World map itself.

Image  examples  could  be for 10 frames of animation for a tree blowing in
the  window,  or  a  single image for a tank driving across the floor, or a
bird flying in the air, etc..

See the Image Bank documentation for more information about image banks.

@endnode

@node "FrontScreen" "The CC Front Screen"

When  the  CC  is  started  up,  you see a screen with 8 buttons on.  These
buttons  show  the  main  functions  required to create a @{" World " link "WhatIsWorld" 0}  to use in
FUBAR.  Many of the programs other features are found under the menus.

These buttons are:

                     @{" Image Bank... " link "ImageBank" 0}  | @{" Level Maps... " link "LevelMaps" 0}
         @{" Objects... " link "Objects" 0} | @{" Weapons... " link "Weapons" 0} | @{" Vehicles... " link "Vehicles" 0}  |  @{" World Map... " link "WorldMap" 0}

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                @{" Plug-ins... " link "PlugIns" 0}

The menus are:

  @{fg shine}Project@{fg text}
   @{" New World...         " link "ProjectMenu" 0} - create a new World
   @{" Open World...        " link "ProjectMenu" 10} - loads a World from disk

  The Window menu correspondes to the buttons on the main screen.

@endnode

@node "ProjectMenu" "Project Menus"

@{b}New World@{ub}

Strangely  enough,  this  creates  a  new  @{" World " link "WhatIsWorld" 0}.  It clears any previous
@{" objects " link "Object" 0},  @{" vehicles " link "Vehicle" 0}, @{" weapons " link "Weapon" 0}, sound effects, @{" levels " link "Map" 0}, etc.  which may
be in memory.

If you have just started the CC, you will need do this first before you can
create a World.

@{b}Open World@{ub}

Attempts  to load a @{" World " link "WhatIsWorld" 0} from disk into memory.  All the assoicated data
files which the World needs to load will also be loaded.

@{i}BETA NOTE: At the moment, just the World data is loaded.@{ui}

@{b}Save World@{ub}

Saves  the  current @{" World " link "WhatIsWorld" 0} to disk, using a name previously specified with
@{b}Save World As@{ub}.

If you have not done a @{b}Save As@{ub} before, the CC will write it as "Unnamed".

@{b}Save World As@{ub}

As @{b}Save World@{ub}, but pops up a file requester.

@{b}Revert@{ub}

This will revert to the last saved version of the @{" World " link "WhatIsWorld" 0} in memory.  It is
exact in operation to @{b}Open World@{ub}, but does not bring up a file requester.

@{b}About@{ub}

Displays  program and version information, registered user information, and
some miscellanous messages put in by the programmer :)

@{b}Quit@{ub}

Closes all windows, frees all used memory and finally closes its screen and
shared resources.  The program is then erased from memory.

In other words, the CC is terminated.

@endnode

@node "DiskMenu" "Disk Menus"

@{i}BETA  NOTE:   The  Disk  menu is unavailable, and will probably be replaced
with  something else more useful.  Later on, a plug-in for doing this level
disk  managing  will be around.  Probably, the managing program as featured
in some really early alpha releases will be revamped and made to work.@{ui}

@endnode

@node "PrefsMenu" "Prefs Menus"

@{b}Screen@{ub}

This  sets  the  mode,  size and number of colours the CC should use as its
screen.

@{i}BETA  NOTE:   This will be extended at a later date to allow CC to open its
windows on Workbench or any other public screen.@{ui}

@{b}Options@{ub}

@{i}BETA  NOTE:   Not  available,  yet.  Things here would be font preferences,
background images (an idea put forward by Tim :) and other great things.@{ui}

@{b}Load Settings@{ub}

This  will  pop  up  a file requester, asking you to select a configuration
file.   The  default settings file, "FUBAR.config", is loaded each time the
CC is started.

@{b}Save Settings@{ub}

Saves  the  settings under the last selected configuration file.  If no was
selected, saves under the default settings file "FUBAR.config".

@{b}Save Settings As@{ub}

Prompts you for a file name to give to a different configuration file.

@{b}Create Icons@{ub}

If this is enabled, icons will be written for all things that can be saved.

@{i}BETA NOTE: This function does nothing as there are no icons.@{ui}

@endnode

@node "ImageBank" "The Image Bank Window"

The   Image   Bank  Window  is  where  you  create  the   images   required
by @{" objects " link "Object" 0}, @{" vehicles " link "Vehicle" 0}  and  @{" weapons " link "Weapon" 0}  during their various states - for
example  an  exploding animation of where the vehicle blows up.  Images are
also used in @{" level maps " link "Map" 0}.

All  images placed in each bank will be accessable by all objects, vehicles
and weapons whilst creating them in their respective editors.  Only certian
images will be accessable in the level map editor.

@{b}General Image Notes@{ub}

 · All images must be 32 by 32 pixels at maximum, whilst 1 by 1 at minimum.
 · All loaded images will be forced to use the same palette.
 · All  images  must be saved as IFF and have no stencial data (if this is
the case, the image will appear corrupt).
 
@{i}BETA NOTE:  If these restrictions are too nasty, just mail me and I'll sort
them  out.   Personally,  there  is nothing wrong with 64x64 images.  Also,
palettes  cannot  be edited or loaded yet - they would need to be remapped,
and  that  is  something I have no knowledge about doing; mail me with your
ideas.   I  was  planning  datatype support on Workbench 3.x for loading of
images  (not  just  for  the  Image  Bank  editor,  tho :) - shall I do it?
Workbench 2.x users will have problems if that's the case...@{ui}
 
@{b}Images to be Used in the Level Map Editor@{ub}

Some  restrictions  apply  on  images  that want to be used in a level map.
These are listed below:

 · The image must be 16 by 16 pixels in size.

The  @{" Level  Map Editor " link "LevelMaps" 0} will show which images are allowed to be used on a
map.  See that for more information.

The Image Bank Editor's window looks something like this:

@{b}The boxes:@{ub}
These  are  the  images  which  are  currently  in  the  image bank.  Their
corresponding  index  number  is shown below the box.  If no image has been
loaded in to a certain slot, it is crossed out.

Most  of the operations on this window require a position in the image bank
(or  a slot) to be selected.  Click on one of these boxes to make that slot
the selected slot.

@{b}<<<:@{ub}
Click this button to see the previous page of images.

@{b}The display box:@{ub}
This box shows what images from the image bank are visible on the screen at
the  moment.   This  also  doubles  up  as an indicator that tells you what
position in the image bank has been selected (in brackets).

You can also click on this box to clear the selected slot.

@{b}>>>:@{ub}
Click this button for the next page of images.

@{b}Add:@{ub}
This will load in an IFF image into the currently selected slot.

@{b}Remove:@{ub}
This will remove the image loaded at the selected slot.

@{b}Save:@{ub}
Allows you to save the selected slot out as an IFF brush.

@{b}Load Bank:@{ub}
Loads  in  a  previously  saved  image  bank,  overwriting  all  the images
currently in the bank.

@{b}Save Bank:@{ub}
Saves out the bank in memory to a file.

@{b}Okay:@{ub}
Closes the window.

@node "WorldMap" "The World Map Editor"

The World Map Editor allows you to set up the World's appearance for the
game  itself.   Here  you  define  what  the  @{" World " link "WhatIsWorld" 0}  looks  like, all the
countries  and  the  owner  settings  of each country.  You can also set up
worldwide parameters, for example weather settings, etc..

@{i}BETA  NOTE:   This  editor  has  many  things yet to be implanted, although
what's there fully works.  Don't expect really good things to be there, but
it will grow over time.@{ui}

When  this  editor  is  invoked,  a  new  screen is opened with the current
representation  of  the  World on it.  Of course, if the World has no world
map then the screen will be blank.

All the editors functions are in the menus.  The menus are as follows:

 @{fg shine}Project@{fg text}

@node "WProjectMenu" "World Editor's Project Menus"

@{b}Clear@{ub}
Clear the World map, and remove all the data from memory.

@{b}Revert@{ub}
This  effectively undoes @{i}all@{ui} the changes you have made to the World map, by
reloading what the World map was from disk.  Of course, if you are creating
the map for the first time, revert will do nothing.

@{b}Okay@{ub}
Keeps  the  changes  to  the World map, and attempts to write them to disk.
This  will write a file called <worldname>.wmp - where "<worldname>" is the
last  name  given  to  the  World from the @{" Save World " link "ProjectMenu" 17} option on the front
screen.    If   you  haven't  saved  the  World  yet,  it  will  be  called

---------------------------------------------------

(Things you can click on are marked @{bg fill}like this@{bg background}.)

@{b}Colours:@{ub}   These  are  all the colours available on the screen which can be
changed.

@{b}Red:@{ub}   Changing  this  changes  the  amount of red there is in the selected
colour.

@{b}Green:@{ub}   Changing this changes the amount of green there is in the selected
colour.

@{b}Blue:@{ub}   Changing  this  changes the amount of blue there is in the selected
colour.  (You get the idea by now, don't you?  :)

@{b}Mode:@{ub}   This  allows  you to swap between 4-bit and 8-bit colour addressing
modes.   You  cannot  use  this, unless you have a graphics card or the AGA
chipset.   Using  8-bit  addressing  allows  you to access the Amiga's 16.7
million colour palette, whereas 4-bit addressing allows only 4096.

@{i}BETA NOTE:  Since the CC doesn't directly support AGA just yet, this gadget
is disabled.  Give it time..  :)@{ui}

Load:  This pops up a file requester, asking you to select a palette file.

You can load a palette from any of the following files:

 · A normal palette file, saved as in a paint package.
 · An IFF image - be it a picture, brush, etc..
 · Any  IFF  animation  (in  this  case, the palette will be taken from the
first frame)

If  you  supply  a  file  which  the  CC can't instantly recognise, it will
attempt  to examine the file a bit better.  If that fails, it won't be able
to find any palette data, and you will be told and the operation cancelled.

@{i}BETA  NOTE:   Again,  hopefully  datatypes will be supported here for OS3.x
users.@{ui}

@{b}Save@{ub}
This will save a standard IFF ILBM palette file, with the name given at the
file requester this function pops up.

@{b}Reset@{ub}
Any changes made to the colours will be reset to when this window was first
opened when this button is clicked.

@{b}Okay@{ub}
Keeps the changes.

@{b}Cancel@{ub}
Forgets the changes, and restores the original palette.

@endnode

@node "WMapImportG" "Import Graphic - World Map Editor"

This allows you to import a graphic to use as the graphical representation for
the World in the actual game.

This image can be any non 24-bit image (up to 256 colours), and will be
used in the main game.

To achieve this, the CC opens a dialog box:

-------------------------------------
 Import Graphic
-------------------------------------
 Image  |@{bg fill}______________________@{bg background}||@{bg fill} ? @{bg background}|

 +---------------------------------+
 |    <@{bg fill} X @{bg background}> Use Files Palette      |

 +---------------------------------+

 |@{bg fill} Import @{bg background}|               |@{bg fill} Cancel @{bg background}|
-------------------------------------

(Things you can click on are marked @{bg fill}like this@{bg background}.)

@{b}Image:@{ub}  This donates what image will be used for the map graphic.  When you
select @{" Okay " link "WProjectMenu" 0} from the Project menu in the World Map Editor, the image will
be  converted  into  the  special  FUBAR file format, so you do not need to
distribute  the  exact  image  from  your hard disk (or whatever) with your
World.  Click the "?" to bring up a file requester.

NOTE:   When  the  Import Graphic option is selected, it will automatically
invoke a file requester.

@{b}Use  Files  Palette@{ub}:  If this is enabled, the palette - if it exists and is
valid - will be extracted from the image file and utilised.  Otherwise, the
palette that is currently on the screen at the time will be used instead.

NOTE:   You  can also load palettes from other files by using the  Palette 
editor.

@{b}Adapt Screen:@{ub}  If this is enabled, the World Map Screen will be made so it
can match the screen mode and depth of when the original image was created.

@{i}BETA  NOTE:  If the screen is much larger than the visible area, you cannot
scroll around it yet (until that damn autoscrolling thing works!  :).  Also
this,  like the rest of the program, hasn't been tested with graphics cards
-  let  alone  images  that  were created on a graphics card, yeech!  If it
doesn't  work,  then  it  doesn't  work  -  I'll fix this at a later stage,
because  we  are really concentrating on getting the game running on AGA at
least for now :).  Just use mode promotion if your fussy :)@{ui}

@{b}Import:@{ub}   Gives  the  program the "okay" to attempt to load the image.  Any
previous image will be erased.

@{b}Cancel:@{ub}  Forgets that this operation was ever called.

@endnode

If the CC cannot add another (for whatever reason) you will be told.  Also,
if you do not give the country a name, the CC will cancel the creation.

@{b}Edit Country@{ub}
First selecting this function, the CC will prompt to you select a @{" country " link "Country" 0}

(Things you can click on are marked @{bg fill}like this@{bg background}.)

@{b}Name@{ub}
This is the name of the country.  If this is blank, the CC will take it as
this country has been deleted.  This can be up to 30 characters long.

@{b}Start Position@{ub}
This determines what player starts at this country when the game begins.
If you set this, and the Owned By cycle gadget is different than the player
set here, then the CC will ask you if you want the player to also own the
country - makes sense really.

@{b}Owned By@{ub}
Determines who owns this country at the start of the game.

@{b}Map@{ub}
This  tells  the  CC  and  FUBAR  what  @{" Level Map " link "LevelMaps" 0} is assiocated with this
country  -  i.e.   when two players attack in this country, the level @{" map " link "Map" 0}
set here will be loaded.

@{b}Cut Scene(s)@{ub}
Here, you can set up what cut scene(s) should be played when this level map
is loaded, and when other things happen.

@{i}BETA  NOTE:   This  option  does *NOTHING* at the moment as there is no cut
scene  editor.   It's  a  planned @{" Plug-in " link "PlugIns" 0}, so it will be around sooner or
later (pretty low priority at the moment though).@{ui}

@{b}Okay@{ub}
This  keeps  the changes.  If no dimensions have been set, the CC will tell
you and open up the @{" Dimensions Editor " link "WMapDimEd" 0} automatically.

Each owner is colour-coded.

Also,  this  will show whether or not each country is the starting position
for a player (marked in brackets).

@{b}Show Title Bar@{ub}
Determines  whether or not the screens title bar is displayed so the screen
can be dragged around and arranged.  Turning it off gives you a little more
space whilst editing.

If  this  option  is enabled, and you are editing a countries dimensions or
some such, the title bar is hidden until the operation is complete.  Common

@{b}Add@{ub}
Adds a frame to the animation.  You can have up to 10 frames.

@{b}Delete@{ub}

Firstly,  Test  will  go  through  the  animation,  looking for any errors.
Errors  can  be that a particular image used in the animation doesn't exist
in  the  @{" Image  Bank " link "ImageBank" 0}, a @{" image " link "Image" 0} in the animation has different dimensions
then  the  first  frame, and so forth.  If errors are detected, the CC will
tell you, along with what frame(s) are giving problems.

Note  that  when  it  actually  appears exactly depends on factors, it will
appear from this date to about 10 years in front.

@{b}Out-of-Date From@{ub}
Set  this  to the year for when the thing becomes obsolete.  This is useful

@node "SoundFX" "The Sound Effects Bank Editor"

Various  occurances  in  the game require sound to give it a bit more of an
atmosphere,  including  giving  players  prompts  when  something  exciting

@node "PlugIn" "What is a Plug-in?"

Many  modern  applications  have  a  feature  with  allows  them to grow to
anyone's needs.  A plug-in allows an application to be extended by adding a
program  in which connects to the main program giving the main program more
features.

For example, you could have a paint package.  If you want the paint package
to read in specific graphics file formats (e.g.  JPEG) for which it doesn't
already  support,  an  external  program  can be "plugged in" to the actual
paint package, giving it the commands it needs to read in a JPEG picture.

It  may sound complex, but really - for the user - it's quite simple.  Copy
a file into a directory, and that's it.

Current plug-ins planned for the CC are as follows:

@{b}Cut Scene Editor@{ub}
This  will  allow  you to create animations which can be played at specific
times during the game.  These add atmosphere to the game, and also give the
player(s) an idea into what's coming next.

This plug-in is being developed by Q-Group.

@{b}World Manager@{ub}
This  is  a  program,  much  like a file-managing utility, but is specially
designed  to organise Worlds generated in the CC.  It can prepare Worlds so
they  can  be  distributed  (via  disk, or the Internet with special Aminet
features)  and  installed on other machines with FUBAR installed.  It has a
full GUI and is very easy-to-use.

@node "HowWritten" "How the Control Centre was Written"

The  Control  Centre,  let  alone FUBAR, has taken months of development to
create.   Even  before  the  Control  Centre  was  written as you know now,
several  other  tools  were  developed.   These were called Gaia, MapEd and
Noah,  and  covered some of the various parts of the Control Centre.  These
tools  were  never  finished, and were no where near as professional as the
Control Centre is.

The  CC  was  started on the 28th May 1997, and has been worked on non-stop
since then.  It needs to be written before the actual game, since designing
the  Control  Centre effectively designs half of the game.  I say non-stop,
but college work takes up a vast majority of my free time so maybe the game
could have been finished by now :).

It  is  programmed in Blitz Basic 2.  Although, having said that, it uses a
lot  of clever tricks to get the best out of this compiler.  Using Blitz as
itself  is very cumbersome, but with the extra assembely code and utilising
various  parts  of  the  operating system Blitz itself cannot reach, the CC
becomes a successful program.

@{u}CODE STATISTICS@{uu}

I'm  sure  this will be of interest to those nosey people who scan binaries
and such looking for things programmers put their code just for a laugh.

The  source  code for the Control Centre (as of v0.0a, 14-May-97) stands at
@{b}5,626@{ub}  lines, which equates into @{b}152K@{ub}.  Even as I type, I am re-working the
user  interface  to  use the triton.library so this may grow or shrink (but
the  executable  size will certainly shrink!).  The binary stands at @{b}255260@{ub}
bytes,  which  is  quite  large considering what it does - packed it's much
smaller, but that's cheating :).

Of  course,  there  are a few secrets in the code - like the save game data
structures and the keyfile workings, etc., but since this is beta software,
they'll  all  change by the end of development (seems a long way off at the
moment :).

If  you  have  any  questions  about the code (nothing stupid like how many
strings  are  there  ;),  feel  free  to  e-mail Oondy at the address found

@node "WhatIsFUBAR" "What is FUBAR?"

[taken from the Q-Group Web Pages - http://www.aber.ac.uk/~img4 ]

@{b}The Background Behind It@{ub}

The  story  behind  the  birth of FUBAR starts when I was playing a game of
@{i}North and South@{ui} with a mate.  Originally, we used to play this classic game
on a standard A500 back in the old days.  @{i}North and South@{ui}, published by the
late  Infogrames,  was badly programmed - it just manages to run on a stock
A500 - but it was clever enough hardly ever to show this fault.

In  rolled  the  year  of  1996,  when we had upgraded our machines to much
better pieces of kit.  Early on a Saturday morning at around 1am, and after
a  few "drinks", this mate of mine and I thought "..wouldn't it be great to
play  @{i}North  and South@{ui}?".  Up cranked the upgraded A500, and we were struck
with  the  dreaded  Software  Failure  message  all-so-many Amiga users are
familar  with.   After a few seconds thought, we concluded that Workbench 2
was to fault.  We degraded the A500 to run under Workbench 1.3 - what @{i}North
and South@{ui} was originally developed on - and it ran happily.

Even  though,  this  solution proved to be very tempermental - we were only
able  to  play  the game once, without it crashing; and sometimes it didn't
even start.

We kept on complaining and swearing at each other, and wondered if we could
"fix" the game to run better.  After discussing that would take forever and
copious  amounts  of  coding we quickly dismissed the idea.  Instead, being
game  designers, we thought "..what if we made our own version of @{i}North and
South@{ui}?"  -  that was our first mistake.  We didn't get to sleep until about
4:30am...

Within  a day, we had created a simple, 2-player only, A500 only version of
our  game.   The  collision  detection  was  very rusty, the control method
dodgy, and the design and layout was inexcusable.

A month or two passed, and I decided to make this game much better - a real
game,  with joystick control that works.  I designed many new ideas for the
game,  created  a  @{b}Construction Kit@{ub}, got some new people on the project and
started work on a fantastic new game for the Amiga.

But,  why  is  the  game  called FUBAR?  When I modified the original games
source  code,  I  did  it so badly it no longer worked, and it was no-where
near  the original specification of the game; hence it was f*cked up beyond
all recognition.  Those American Armies - such a tactful phrase...  ;)

@{b}What is it?@{ub}

The idea of the game is for a player to rule the world, killing off all the
other  players  on  the  way.   This is not a cutey game in any way - it is
violent,  and  focuses  greatly  on  murder  and  fantastic ways of killing
things.

The  game  itself  is  designed for 1 to 2 players, but in the future, this
will  be  expanded  to  support a maximum of 4 players per game over serial
link, direct modem play, or via TCP/IP (the Internet).

It  is  an  action/strategy  game.  There are two sides to the game itself;
firstly  it  has  a  map  screen  which  shows the whole world on which the
players  are  fighting against each other to conquer.  The world is divided
into  countries,  and  each country is owned by each player.  The game ends
when a player captures all the countries and killed off the other players.

When two players' troops meet, they go into battle.  Here, you can launch a
wide  range  of artillery at the opposition, and cause complete devastation
to the loosing sides troops, artillery and the player's plans.

What  makes  this  game  even  more interesting, is the fact that it can be
fully  customised!   It  has  its  own  @{b}Control Centre@{ub}, which allows you to
create  entire  worlds, armies, battlefields and graphics for FUBAR.  There
are  hundreds of options and variables which can be set to make each object
different.   All  the  animations,  graphics and worlds can be drawn by the
creator,  or  new weapons can be easily knocked together using a library of
graphics which will be supplied with it.

If  you  still  don't  get  it,  combine @{i}North and South@{ui} with @{i}Civilization@{ui},
Chess, @{i}Risk@{ui}, @{i}Cannon Fodder@{ui} and the popular PC game @{i}Command and Conquer@{ui} into
one  game,  add  some  of our own ideas and you'll result in FUBAR.  If you
still don't get it - think guns, explosions, plans and World War.
