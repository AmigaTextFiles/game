                         PLUG-IN DEVELOPMENT NOTES

                 $VER: PlugInDevNotes.txt 1.0 (24-May-97)

NOTE
If  you  are not a developer and do not know how to program, you can safely
ignore this whole document (in fact, I advise that you do :).

INTRODUCTION
This  text  details how to create plug-ins for FUBAR's Control Centre.  You
will require the CC to be installed on your system.

BETA NOTE
Please  note that the CC is _BETA SOFTWARE_.  The plug-in system for the CC
has  just  been  introduced,  and  does nothing special as yet.  Take these
notes with a pinch of salt, as they are due to be changed shortly.

WORKING WITH CC
At the moment, plug-ins are stand-alone executables.  There is currently NO
communication  port  between  your  plug-in or the CC.  Currently, an ARexx
port  is  being  developed,  along  with  a message port so plug-ins can be
actually integreted with the CC.

So, at the moment, you could copy DirectoryOpus into the PlugIns/ directory
and it would work.  But don't, as that would be stupid.

FINAL NOTES
Remember  that  the  CC  is developed in Blitz Basic (yeh, okay, I know :).
But,  adding a message port or two isn't difficult (even in Blitz), so this
should happen quite sooner - if not already - rather than later.

Cheers
Oond
