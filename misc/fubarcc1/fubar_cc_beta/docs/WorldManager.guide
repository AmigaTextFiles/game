Sorry, no docs here yet.  That's obviously due to the World Manager Plug-in
not being written yet.  Hmph.

If  you're  looking  for  docs  on  how to distribute Worlds created in the
Control  Centre, you won't find any.  **PLEASE** do not distribute them yet
(distribute them to me (Oondy) of course!!).

Stay tuned, and keep on rocking!
