@toc "ControlCentre.guide/main"

Please  read  the section in the manual about the @{" Image Bank Editor " link "ControlCentre.guide/ImageBank" 0} first
before attempting this rough guide.

To create an image bank, you need to have some images to load into it.  So,
you  will probably need to draw.  Of course, there is nothing to stop those
who  can't  draw  (like  myself :) from scribbling in a paint package a few
times  and  loading  in  those  scribbles - feel free!  How did you think I
managed to get this to work?!  ;)

@{fg shine}ROUGH GUIDE@{fg text}

1.   Make  sure  a  World has been created (@{b}Project/New...@{ub}) if you've been
following tutorials or other rough guides.

2.  Click on @{b}Image Bank@{ub} on the front screen, or choose @{b}Window/Image Bank...@{ub}
from the menus.

3.   The  @{u}Image  Bank  Editor@{uu}  window  opens.   If there has been no images
loaded, you will see bank slots with crosses in them.

4.   Click  on slot number 0 with the mouse to select that particular slot.
You  can  find  more slots by clicking the "@{b}<<<@{ub}" or "@{b}>>>@{ub}" buttons.  Clear a
selection  by clicking on the @{b}info bar@{ub} or any other part of the window that
has nothing on it.

5.   Click  on  @{b}Add@{ub}.   A file requester will appear asking you to select an
image to load into slot 0 (if you clicked on that slot).

6.  Choose one of your images you made earlier in the file requester (go to
the  correct  path  as usual and double-click the file).  The image will be
loaded into that slot (providing no errors occured).

7.   @{i}Repeat  steps  4-6@{ui}  selecting  different slots, until you get a decent
collection of images for the bank.

8.   Choose  @{b}Save  Bank@{ub}  and  enter a name into the file requester for your
image bank.  Click @{b}Okay@{ub} or @{b}press return@{ub} in the requester to save.

9.  The images will be saved.  You've just created an image bank.

@node "Object" "Rough Guide to Creating an Object"
@toc "ControlCentre.guide/main"

Please  read  the  section  in  the  manual about the @{" Object Editor " link "ControlCentre.guide/Objects" 0} first
before attempting this rough guide.

To complete this rough guide, you'll need the following:
  · A @{" Weapon " link "Weapon" 0} set up;
  · An @{" image bank " link "ImageBank" 0} set up with at least 8 images.

@{fg shine}ROUGH GUIDE@{fg text}

In this rough guide, we shall create two objects.  The first is a tree, and
the second will be a gun turret.

@{fg shine}THE TREE@{fg text}

1.   Make  sure  a  World has been created (@{b}Project/New...@{ub}) if you've been
following tutorials or other rough guides.

2.   Now  open the @{u}Image Bank Editor@{uu} on the front screen, and either create
an  image bank from your images or load one from disk that has been created
previously.

3.   Click  @{b}Okay@{ub} on the @{u}Image Bank Editor@{uu}'s window and you will be returned
to the front screen.

4.  Click on @{b}Objects...@{ub} on the front screen, or choose @{b}Window/Objects...@{ub}
from the menus.

5.  The @{u}Object Editor@{uu} window opens.  On the left-hand side of the window is
a  list  of  available objects.  So far, this list should say "@{b}<empty>@{ub}" for
each item in the list, meaning that there are no objects.

6.  When the window opened, the @{b}Name@{ub} text box was selected - this is the CC
asking you for a name to give to the selected object (the first one in this
case).   Every  object  needs  a name, so it can identified.  In this case,
enter  "@{b}Tree@{ub}"  and  @{b}press  return@{ub}.   The  user interface will become alive,
allowing you to define further parameters for the tree.

7.   Click  @{b}Start  Activated@{ub}, since we want our tree to be visible.  In the
@{b}Events@{ub}  list,  click  on  each  event  in  the  list,  making sure that the
following boxes are ticked for each event:

  @{i}Wind Blows:@{ui} Nothing
  @{i}Walked On:@{ui}  Nothing (this implies that a player can't walk into it)
  @{i}Shot At:@{ui}    Explode (the tree goes "Fuuum!" when its shot)
  @{i}Landed On:@{ui}  Nothing (meaning it can't be landed on making the player die)
  @{i}Pushed:@{ui}     Nothing

8.   To  set up our trees graphics, click on @{b}Edit Graphics@{ub}.  This will open
the  @{u}Graphics  Editor@{uu}.   @{b}Normal@{ub} graphics is where the tree is just standing
their, blowing in the wind.

9.   If  you  have 4 images which corrospond to a tree blowing in the wind,
click  @{b}Add@{ub}  3  times  to  make  4 frames (since everything has at least one
frame).  Use the @{b}Frame@{ub} scroll bar to switch between the different frames in
the  animation,  and  @{b}Pick@{ub} to choose an image from the @{u}Image Bank@{uu} to use in
the trees animation.

10.   Click  @{b}Test@{ub}.   This  will  test  the animation to see if they are any
errors.   If  there  are,  you  will  be  told,  leaving  you  to fix them.
Otherwise,  the animation will be played.  Whilst playing, scroll the @{b}Speed@{ub}
scroll  bar  to change the frames per second (fps) of the animation.  Click
@{b}Okay@{ub} when you're happy.

11.   If  you changed the @{b}Speed@{ub} of the animation during the test phase, the
CC will ask you if you want to keep that speed.

12.  Okay, that's defined the @{b}Normal@{ub} animation - now for when you shoot the
tree,  making it explode.  Click the @{b}Graphic@{ub} cycle button.  Since a tree is
always  stationary,  click it again to skip the @{b}Stationary@{ub} setting and move
onto the @{b}Exploding@{ub} setting.

13.   @{i}Repeat stages 9-11@{ui} except this time choose frames which make the tree
go up in flames.

14.   Once  happy,  click on @{b}Options@{ub}.  Tick @{b}Leave Last Frame when Dead@{ub}, and
click @{b}Okay@{ub}.

15.   Click @{b}Okay@{ub} on the @{u}Graphics Editor@{uu} window, and you will be returned to
the @{u}Object Editor@{uu}.

16.   If  you  want  to,  click  @{b}Save@{ub}.  The CC will pop up a file requester
asking  for  a  name.  It defaults to the name you gave it earlier - in our
case  "Tree"  -  so  you  can just click @{b}Okay@{ub} and this will save the Tree's
settings  to  disk.   Remember  that you don't have to save every object to
disk, since each object is in the particular World when it is created.  You
only need to save it if you want to use the same object in another World.

@{i}You've just created our tree, and your first object!@{ui}

@{fg shine}GUN TURRET@{fg text}

Now  onto  more  exciting  (?)  things.   Something that shoots.  Something
that's gonna hurt.

Why  do  we create a gun turret as an object and not a weapon?  Well, a gun
turret  is  a  stationary  object  that  can't be controlled by the player.
Since  a  weapon requires something to attach to before it can be used, you
couldn't  really attach it to anything, unless you want a huge tower coming
off the side of your tank.

You  could create it as a vehicle with no speed.  This would let the turret
be  controlled  by  the  player, so they could tell it what to shoot at and
when.  But for this rough guide, we're creating it as an object.

@{i}This rough guide continues from the previous object we created - the tree.@{ui}

17.  Click on the object under the Tree in the @{b}Objects@{ub} list which is called
"<empty>".  This is where we'll make the Turret.

18.  Enter the name "Gun Turret" and @{b}press return@{ub}.  Click @{b}Start Activated@{ub}
as well.

19.   Follow  the  same steps as before for setting up the graphics for the
Tree,  only  this  time using graphics for a gun turret (something close to
it).

20.  Now for the @{b}Events@{ub}.  These are:

  Nothing - nothing
  Wind Blows - nothing
  Walked On - nothing
  Shot At - Shoot At (and select a weapon you created before @{b}^^@{ub})
  Landed On - Explode (eheh..  cool)
  Pushed - nothing

@{b}^^@{ub}  If  you  haven't  created  a weapon before, quickly pop into the @{u}Weapon
Editor@{uu},  and  enter  a name like "My Weapon" and click @{b}Okay@{ub}.  Then when you
click on the @{b}With@{ub} button, you can select one.

21.  @{b}Save@{ub} the Gun Turret to disk.

22.  Click @{b}Okay@{ub}.

@{i}You've just created two objects which appear in the World!@{ui}

@node "Vehicle" "Rough Guide to Creating a Vehicle"
@toc "ControlCentre.guide/main"

Please  read  the  section  in  the manual about the @{" Vehicle Editor " link "ControlCentre.guide/Vehicles" 0} first
before attempting this rough guide.

In  this  rough  guide,  you will learn how to create a vehicle.  You could
create anything you wanted as a vehicle, but in this example we'll create a
helicopter.

To complete this guide, you'll need:
  · A {" weapon " link "Weapon" 0} set up;
  · An @{" image bank " link "ImageBank" 0} set up with some images.

@{fg shine}ROUGH GUIDE@{fg text}

1.   Make  sure  a  World has been created (@{b}Project/New...@{ub}) if you've been
following tutorials or other rough guides.

2.   Now  open the @{u}Image Bank Editor@{uu} on the front screen, and either create
an  image bank from your images or load one from disk that has been created
previously.

3.   Click  @{b}Okay@{ub} on the @{u}Image Bank Editor@{uu}'s window and you will be returned
to the front screen.

4.  Click on @{b}Vehicles...@{ub}  on the front screen, or choose @{b}Window/Vehicles...@{ub}
from the menus.

5.   The  @{b}Vehicle Editor@{ub} window opens.  On the left-hand side of the window
is  a  list  of available vehicles.  So far, this list should say "@{b}<empty>@{ub}"
for each item in the list, meaning that there are no vehicles.

6.   As  with  the @{u}Object Editor@{uu}, the @{b}Name@{ub} text box is selected since there
are  no  vehicles.  For our vehicle, enter "@{fg shine}Helicopter@{fg text}" here or "@{fg shine}Choppa@{fg text}" if
you're cool, and @{b}press return@{ub}.

7.  Lots of options become available.  Set these values:

 @{b}Max. Speed@{ub}:  200
 @{b}Crew Needed@{ub}: 2  (pilot and co-pilot - its a big helicopter)
 @{b}Max. Armour@{ub}: 125%  (it's slightly bulky)
 @{b}Maintenance@{ub}: $1000 (since its bulky, a slightly higher-than-normal fix)
 @{b}Water Mode@{ub}:  Not Allowed (ever seen a working helicopter in water?)
 @{b}Crew Level@{ub}:  Any (you don't need to be over-qualified for this helicopter)
 @{b}Can Fly@{ub}:     Yes (of course it can!)
 @{b}Can Land@{ub}:    Yes (ditto)
 @{b}Weapon@{ub}:      None (its a transport helicopter, but if you have a
              pre-defined weapon, feel free to set it here)

8.   Now for the other bits.  Here you define the graphics and the vehicles
research  settings.   If  you've  been following other rough guides, you'll
know  how to set up the graphical animations using the @{u}Graphics Editor@{uu}.  If
you  haven't,  follow  the  @{" Object Rough Guide " link "Object" 0} to understand the @{u}Graphics
Editor@{uu}.

9.   Once  the graphics has been set up, click on @{b}Research@{ub}.  This opens the
@{u}Research Editor@{uu}.

10.   For our helicopter, we'll make it so that it becomes available to the
player  at  quite  an  early  stage in the game.  Of course, it's perfectly
exceptable  to  have  it  so  the player has it automatically (by not doing
anything to the research settings) or let them have it in 200 years time.

11.   Click @{b}Needs to be Researched@{ub}.  This tells FUBAR that the players need
to  earn this vehicle.  Set @{b}Available From@{ub} to 2005, and @{b}Out-of-Date From@{ub} to
2200  -  so it gives the player a very good chance of getting a helicopter.
Set @{b}Cost to Build@{ub} to $750.

12.   Now  to  set  up  the  number of @{b}Materials@{ub} the helicopter needs to be
researched.   Set  this figure to 200, since our helicopter is a bit bulky.
Click @{b}Okay@{ub} and that's done that.

@{i}BETA NOTE:  We are ignoring the @{u}Sounds Editor@{uu}, because it doesn't work yet.@{ui}

13.   Click @{b}Save@{ub}.  This gives you the opportunity to save the helicopter to
disk if you want to use this particular one in a later World you create.

14.  Click @{b}Okay@{ub}, and you're done!

@{i}You've just created your first vehicle!@{ui}

@node "Weapon" "Rough Guide to Creating a Weapon"
@toc "ControlCentre.guide/main"

Please  read  the  section  in  the  manual about the @{" Weapon Editor " link "ControlCentre.guide/Weapons" 0} first
before attempting this rough guide.

After  progressing  through this rough guide, you will have a rough idea on
how to create a weapon so it can be attached to various devices.

We'll create a homing missile and a grenade.

@{fg shine}ROUGH GUIDE@{fg text}

To complete this guide, you'll need:
  · An  image bank loaded with some graphics of homing missiles/grenades it
    (or something to that effect).

@{fg shine}The Homing Missile@{fg text}

1.   Make  sure  a  World has been created (@{b}Project/New...@{ub}) if you've been
following tutorials or other rough guides.

2.   Now  open the @{u}Image Bank Editor@{uu} on the front screen, and either create
an  image bank from your images or load one from disk that has been created
previously.

3.   Click  @{b}Okay@{ub} on the @{u}Image Bank Editor@{uu}'s window and you will be returned
to the front screen.

4.   Click  on @{b}Weapons...@{ub}  on the front screen, or choose @{b}Window/Weapons...@{ub}
from the menus.

5.  The @{u}Weapon Editor@{uu} window opens.  On the left-hand side of the window is
a  list  of  available weapons.  So far, this list should say "@{b}<empty>@{ub}" for
each item in the list, meaning that there are no weapons.

6.   As  with  the @{u}Object Editor@{uu}, the @{b}Name@{ub} text box is selected since there
are  no weapons.  For our homing missile, enter "@{fg shine}Homing Missile@{fg text}" or "@{fg shine}Homer@{fg text}"
if you're a fan of @{i}The Simpsons@{ui}, and @{b}press return@{ub}.

7.  A few more options become available.  Set these values:

  @{b}Range@{ub}:  150% (50% extra than normal)
  @{b}Accuracy@{ub}:  75% (make it a bit lame sometimes)
  @{b}Self-exploding@{ub}:  Off
  @{b}Explode on Impact@{ub}:  On
  @{b}Cause Shapnel@{ub}:  Off
  @{i}@{b}Chemical Weapon@{ub} and @{b}Nuclear@{ub} should be off as these are not used.@{ui}
  @{b}Homes-in on Target@{ub}:  On (of course :)

8.   Once  that's done, you need to set up the graphics for the weapon.  If
you've used the @{u}Graphics Editor@{uu} before, you should be capable of setting up
the  required  animations  for our homing missile.  Otherwise, refer to the
@{" Object Rough Guide " link "Object" 0} to see how.

9.   Next,  we  set  up  the  @{b}research@{ub} for our weapon.  Although, since our
weapon  is  quite  primative  (in  war  game  standards anyway :) it really
doesn't  need  to  be  researched.   Of  course,  you  can still set up the
research  parameters  if  you  want,  but it won't be covered on this rough
guide.

10.   Next,  click  @{b}Type@{ub}.   This  tells  FUBAR what type of weapon this is.
You'll  notice  that  there  are many different combinations to define what
type  of  weapon  this  is.  For our rough guide, we'll make it so that our
homing missile is fired from ground-based units to hit air-based used.  So,
set this option to @{b}Ground - Air@{ub}.  Click @{b}Okay@{ub}.

@{i}BETA NOTE:  The Sounds button has been skipped as it doesn't work yet.@{ui}

11.  You can save this weapon to disk by clicking @{b}Save@{ub} now.

@{i}You've just created your first weapon!@{ui}

@{fg shine}The Grenade@{fg text}

12.  In the @{b}Weapons@{ub} list, click below our homing missile we created before.
This will give us a blank weapon to create our grenade in.

13.  In the @{b}Name@{ub} text box, type "@{fg shine}Grenade@{fg text}" and @{b}press return@{ub}.

14.  Now to set up the options:

  @{b}Range@{ub}:  75%  (a throw is quite weedy)
  @{b}Accuracy@{ub}:  90% (quite high because it's used in close combat)
  @{b}Self-exploding@{ub}:  On
  @{b}Delay@{ub}:  Set this to 5 seconds.
  @{b}Explode on Impact@{ub}:  Off
  @{b}Cause Shapnel@{ub}:  On
  @{i}@{b}Chemical Weapon@{ub} and @{b}Nuclear@{ub} should be off as these are not used.@{ui}
  @{b}Homes-in on Target@{ub}:  Off 

15.  @{b}Research@{ub} options should be set that the grenade doesn't need to be
researched, the @{b}Graphics@{ub} set up for a grenade, and @{b}Type@{ub} should be set to
@{b}Ground-Ground@{ub}.

@{i}BETA NOTE:  Remember - no sounds :)@{ui}

16.  @{b}Save@{ub} that to disk if you want.

17.  Click @{b}Okay@{ub}.

@{i}You've just created two weapons in a World and completed this rough guide!@{ui}
