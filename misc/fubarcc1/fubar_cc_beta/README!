READ ME FIRST!

This  is  the second release of the Control Centre.  The only difference is
that it has FULL 100% documentation (English only, sorry).  PLEASE READ ALL
THE DOCUMENTATION - you'll understand it much better.

In  the libs directory, there is a file called config.library.  Please copy
that to your LIBS:  assignment before running CC.

The config.library is © 1996 Adam Dawes.
