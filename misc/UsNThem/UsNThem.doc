Us n' Them Documentation
------------------------

Welcome to our tribute to that immortal classic of the C64, 'ARCHON'!

This game is basically a straight clone of the original, with improved
graphics and sound effects.  The game is completely free with only one
string attached.  If you like it you must fill out our survey and mail
it to us.  Details at the end of this document.

Due to AMOS being complete crap, this game requires an accelerated
Amiga 1200 (28 Mhz) before it will run at full speed.  It's memory
inefficient, doesn't multitask and suffers from occasional strange
sound distortions.

So Why Play This Game?
----------------------

Simply because it's the best damn Archon clone ever written.  The artificial
intelligence is streets ahead of the original C64 version, and the animation
quality is very good.  We're particularly proud of the Water Elemental.

Legal Stuff.
------------

We accept no responsibility for any damage to your system caused by this game,
including hair loss, dysentry, mortons foot, and irradiated pets.
It is provided as is, with no warranty of any kind blah blah blah.

Installation:
-------------

Installation is easy.  Unpack the archive to anywhere on your system (which
you already appear to have done) and place an assign in your startup.

ie : assign UsNThem: Hd0:/Games/UsNThem

And hey presto.  The only good thing about writing it in amos is that it
should work on most machines, no matter how weird.

Instructions:
-------------

The aim of the game is to exterminate the opposition, or to capture the five
glowing power points.  To do this you have a variety of creatures, all with
different abilities.  The squares on the game board are of three different
types.  White, Black and Cycling.

The lighter the colour of the square, the more hitpoints a piece on the light
side has when he enters combat.  The same applies in reverse the darker the
colour.  Obviously the dark side reaps similar bonuses from dark squares.

If two pieces ever occupy the same square, they enter an arena of combat and
fight to the death.  The winner gains control of the square.

Each side has a spell caster, with 7 once only spells.  To access the spells,
select the spell caster and press fire again.  Cycle through the spell menu
by pressing up and down on the joystick.

The spells go as follows :

Teleport:  Teleport a piece from one square to another, anywhere on the board.

Heal : Bring a wounded piece back to full health.

Shift Time : Change the direction of the colour cycle.

Exchange : Exchange a piece with any other piece.

Summon Elemental : Summons one of four elementals to fight for you.  The
elemental will only stick around for one fight.

Imprison : Stop one of your opponents pieces from moving until the colour
cycle reached white for the light side, or black for the dark side.

Revive : Revives a dead piece, allowing him to rejoin the struggle.


That's all there is to it.

More Hacking On AMOS.
---------------------

This game was written using AMOS v1.35.  You may ask why I didn't upgrade to
AMOS PRO, but I'd say that the code for this game crashes the AMOS PRO
program when you test it.  Seeing as you cannot compile an untested program,
this renders AMOS PRO useless.

Speed considerations aside, the AMOS sound routines are hopeless.  The sample
stop routine takes just under one vertical blank to stop the sample, meaning
the poor programmer has to mess around for hours before the samples loop
properly.  Also it flips a coin to see if a sample that tries to play while
one is already running gets a hearing.

I can tell stories about AMOS for hours.  Just ask my flatmate.  I've been
fighting AMOS all the way to make the game great, and I'm done fighting.
