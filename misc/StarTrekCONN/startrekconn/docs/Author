A little note about the author.

Essentially, I am a musician in England, who has very limited
ability at programming (mainly AMOSPro + a TINY bit of C), even
less talent at graphics, but a BIG imagination.


I never intended to actually release this game. It was 
supposed to be a challenge to my programming skills, just
for a bit of fun. But it got so big, and has so much
potential, that I thought I HAD to release it, bug
riddled and all.

So, if you could spare me an email at bazthehat@ukonline.co.uk, 
I would really appreciate it!

All the best,
	Barry Ryerson.
