StarTrek:The Next Generation Technical Manual
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Yes, OK, I like StarTrek so much, I bought the technical
manual for it. In fact, that is where I got most of the
ideas to make this game. So, for those of you who like
a bit of tech, here's the bits that I've added/adapted
for the game.


BTW: This isn't finished yet. Sorry!

Welcome to the USS Wisonsin Technical Manual. Please select entry:

FLIGHT:
~~~~~~

Plotting a course in four dimensional space can be quite  
a daunting task, but thankfully the onboard computer
calculates and recalculates the approach vector. 

Target co-ordinates can be entered as a local name, sector
number, or relative XYZ co-ordinate (see Nav). Depending
on the velocity, the Flight computer co-ordinates its
direction with a low level deflector field, to gently
push aside interstellar material or larger scale objects
well before collision takes place. Because of the subspace
fields required for this, the object will have the impression
that the ship is in fact swerving to avoid them.


NAVIGATION
~~~~~~~~~~

The Galaxy is a big place, and so in order to help catalogue
it, it has been split up into Sectors. Each sector is approximately
100 light years cubed, or roughly 9.3 x 10^13 km cubed. Although
in reality these sectors overlap and curve due to the gravity
of the galaxy, they are represented as being in a linear cue, where
sector 1 is to the "far left" of the cue, and sector 30 is the
"far right". Sectors outside this range are not within UFP jurisdiction.

In any given sector, the Wisconsin can plot two maps of the area,
showing the location of systems within the sector relative to an
imaginary axis. The very centre of this axis typically sports
a Starbase which governs the sector.

A good way to imagine this is to take two objects in your hands.
One is the Starbase, with a co-ordinate of 0/0/0. The other is
a star system. Hold the objects in such a way that you are looking
straight down to the floor. If the star system is nearer the floor
than the starbase, then it will show up blue in the XY map. If it is
nearer you than the starbase, then it would show up green. If it
was the same height above the floor as the starbase, it would be
grey.

Exactly the same occurs with the ZY map, only now instead of looking
straight down, look forward. If the object is behind the starbase, it
would be blue. If the starbase is further away, it would be green.

Emergency Probes can also be launched which announces to everyone
within 50 light years that a ship is in distress. Frequently a UFP
ship will arrive to help, though not always.


PROPULSION
~~~~~~~~~~

The Wisconsin is powered by three generators - the Warp Generator,
the Impulse Generator, and an Emergency Backup Generator. All of these
generators use fuel, namely an explosive mix of matter and anti-matter.
Only the warp generator, however, can use this to power the warp enegines.

"Warp" is the name given to an engine which uses powerful subspace
fields to fold spacetime around an object, in this case, the ship. 
The action is peristaltic, where the folded space is pulled from the 
front to the back of the ship, and then repeated. This enables
ships to travel faster than light, without any of the problems with
mass increase.

Time dilation is still a factor. However, onboard computers constantly
conform the clocks with UFP time beacons, which are placed at regular 
spaces in each sector. Thus, a journey which takes several days can,
relative to the person travelling, only take a few minutes.

The Impulse engines are used for much smaller distances, and due to
relativistic problems, are limited to 20% of the speed of light.
They work in much the same way as the Reaction Control System, by
ejecting force at a certain angle to move the ship. Impulse is
used for translation, RCS for rotation.


TACTICAL
~~~~~~~~

Although the Wisconsin is officially a science vessel, it is 
still equipped with a respectable arsonal.
