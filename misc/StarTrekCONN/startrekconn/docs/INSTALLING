If you're having any trouble installing the program,
please make sure of the following:


() There isn't an assign of "sttng:" to anywhere else
   on your computer;

() That the files in Fonts are in your Fonts: directory;

() This program requies AMOS.library, which isn't included
   in the archive.


I think that they're the easiest mistakes. Of course, bad
programming never helps.... ;)

Have fun!

Bazthehat!
