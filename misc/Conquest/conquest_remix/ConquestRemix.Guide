                      @{b}A message to the Amiga community@{ub}:

We must stay together regarding what's to happen to the Amiga, specially the 
A/Box project. It's possible that the Amiga will start having clones, and 
maybe in the future it will not be called Amiga anymore. But the Amiga is 
far  more than a 68000 processor or a Workbench system. It's the spirit of 
it's user base that make it an outstanding computer. If we are going to have 
a PowerPC processor or AmigaOS-like, fine. If it will not be called Amiga? 
no problem.
What really matters is that we, the users, maintain the same spirit we always 
had: The Amiga spirit. That way, the new hardware will certainly be an Amiga,
no matter what their manufacturers call it.

This game has been done for a mag compo that  has never seen the light of 
the day. Therefore it would be the best thing to release it as Freeware.

TECHNICAL INFO:

This game was totaly written in AMOS Pro.
It uses 32 colours on-screen and works on any machine with 1 meg of RAM.
The whole game fits on a single disk.
This is NOT a demo version.
Not much more to say about tech specs, really..


Amiga god/wargame lovers should check out the @{b}Battlecraft@{ub} homepages:
http://www.cybercomm.nl/~peterdb/rav_ami.html


You can contact the musician, Ruben Monteiro, for any purpose at the 
following email:   @{b}c0ntact@esoterica.pt@{ub}
Also watch out for his homepage soon on http://www.esoterica.pt/~c0ntact/
