@NODE Description

  @{b}Description@{ub}

  Life Simulator is a program that emulates extremely simple life forms on
  your computer. Sure, there are already programs that do this but there
  are none that work the same as this one (to my knowledge).

  The program defines different attributes to different colours, and the
  process's of aging, reproduction and fighting are then dependent upon a
  particular lifeform's colours.

  Life simulator should run on any Amiga computer with wb2+, however it has
  only been tested on my wb3.0 68020. If you have any problems please
  contact me with a description.

  @{b}Legal@{ub}

  Life Simulator is Shareware and is freely distributable provided that it
  is kept in the original archive and not altered in any way.
  PD distributers and other such organisations may only charge a reasonable
  rate for time and disks or media, you should not be charged for this
  program in itself.

@NODE Usage

  @{b}Using Life Simulator@{ub}

  The only file neccessary to run Life Simulator is the main file
  "LifeSim". This can only be run from the CLI however - if you wish to use
  workbench then just ensure that the "LifeSimulator" file and icon are in
  the same drawer as LifeSim - this icon will activate Life Simulator.

  When you start Life Simulator you will see an introductory screen, this
  can be bypassed with the mouse or dissapears after 3 seconds. You are now
  presented with the preferences screen.
  On this screen you can choose the options that will affect the way that
  Life Simulator will run. The options are:

  Red,Blue,Green,Cyan,Yellow,Magneta,White
    These switches turn these colours on or off in the initial setup of the
    screen. Note that the banned colours can still appear through a
    mutation however.

  Update
    This switch allows you to choose either a random or an ordered update -
    a random update is the default setting. In a random update, every
    square on the screen is updated randomly, but the program ensures that
    it has updated every square before it does another sweep. In an ordered
    update the program sweeps from the lop left to bottom right updating as
    it goes. This is slightly faster but produces patterns that contain a
    'drift' in the lower right direction.

  Organisms
    This slider allows you to choose the number of organisms that will be
    randomly generated and placed on the screen when Life Simulator
    initialises.

  50*50,100*100,320*200
    These buttons start Life Simulator, and allow you to choose the
    required size of the screen. On my 68020 there is a very noticable
    slowdown on the larger modes, but they allow more play for truer
    randomness in your simulation.

  -------------------------------------+

  @{b}In Use@{ub}

  You can pause Life Simulator at any time by holding the left mouse
  button. The pause is only active while you hold the button.

  Quit Life Simulator by moving the mouse to the upper left corner of the
  screen and pressing the left mouse button.

@NODE Details

  @{b}Details@{ub}

  Life Simulator is all based upon colours. The colours not only have
  attributes dependent upon the colour in question, but they are
  'weighted'. As an example of this, an organism that dies turns its
  colour to black to indicate this - black as represented by 0,0,0 if you
  are at all familiar with RGB scales on your computer. Adding 0 0 and 0
  gives you, umm.. 0! Which is this colours weight - thus a dead square has
  a weight of 0, but any colour in a square will increase its weight.

  Red
    Red is the aggression factor. It is a main factor in determining if an
    organism will successfully take over another. It also has an effect on
    an organisms aging - the more red present in an organism the quicker it
    dies.

  Green
    Green is the vitality statistic of the organism. The more green it has
    the less likely the organism is to age.

  Blue
    Blue controls the amount an organism multiplies. A high blue count
    means the organism will reproduce more often.

  As you know, if you mix red and blue you get purple or magenta - this
  produces not only a purple coloured organism but an organism with a
  mixture of the attributes of red and blue.

  Life Simulator currently has seven 'species' of life, all split into
  eight 'organisms'. The species are:

  High red, low blue and green
  High blue, low red and green
  High green, low blue and red
  High red and blue, low green
  High blue and green, low red
  High green and red, low blue
  High/low green blue and red

  This provides a total of fifty six different organisms.

  Life Simulator was written in ACE Amiga Basic (thanks to David Benn),
  which provided a quick and easy way to code my ideas.

  The Life Simulator Web Page will hold any newer versions or updates that
  are released, as well as information on this and other Amiga programs.

@NODE Future

  @{b}Future@{ub}

  Here are a couple of ideas I have for some possible future additions to
  Life Simulator. If you have any more then please email me.


  A setting to take an .iff snapshot of the active window every x number of
  minutes.

  An option to calculate the whole screen worth of organisms and then
  redraw the whole screen in one go.

  Possibly use the ham screen modes to give a much larger amount of visible
  colours - also re-write the program so it makes use of all ham colours and
  perhaps more colours!

  Re-write the program, optimising for speed and using algorithms instead
  of set measurements to define the colours - this will allow for the ham
  mode above.

  Include a setting for sexual or asexual reproduction - at the moment it
  is all asexual. Also, the current asexual reproduction creates a new
  organism with the top level of 'health' for its class, possibly this will
  just bump up a couple. Perhaps in sexual reproduction mode a threshhold
  of species tolerance will be built in, so a bright red could not mate
  with a bright blue for example, but a red could mate with a purple which
  in turn could mate with blue.

  Add an option to change the frequency of random mutations in births - at
  present one in ten thousand new organisms are selected at random from all
  available colours.
