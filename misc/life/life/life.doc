1. What is LIFE?
----------------

Well, I would say LIFE is an easy simulation and not only a simple game, what
you could think if you play it the first time. LIFE can be very interesting.

There's a board devided up into a square grid. The squares could be cells, 
for instance. Each cell has 8 neighbour cells, which can be either alive or
dead. If it is alive this square is marked, if it is dead the square is
empty. With every new generation which will be calculated, the life can be
changed.

The rules of the calculation are easy:

If a square has 2 living cells as neighbours there will be changed nothing.
And If a square has 3 living cells as neighbours, there will be also changed
nothing, if this square is alive itself. If this square is dead, there will
be created a new cell. And if there are more than 3 or less than 2 living
neighbours, there will be changed nothing, if this square is dead, and if it
is alive, it will die.

If you play with this program, you will find out that there are a lot of
pattern of cells with special effects. Some of them are listed here ...

         *
 *	* *    **	... constant patterns, which will not be changed
* *	* *    * *	    after any calculation 
 *       *      **
 

             *		... this one will always turn after every 
***          *              calculation
             *
             
 
Look for more than this ones, f.i. "planes" flying from one side to
the other ...



2. System requirements
----------------------
The program should work on every system configuration and with every
Kickstart. It has been testet on an A1200, an A1200/030 with FastRAM
under Kickstart 3.0 and Kickstart 1.3.
The program is very easy coded under the Workbench, so that you can
run it, during you have to do important other things ...
