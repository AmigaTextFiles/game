         === Switch ===

   Upon starting this game, you will be presented with a pattern of empty
rings. These are called switches, and the game is played by clicking on
them.

   What happens when you click on a switch is (not surprisingly) that it
switches. If it's off (an empty ring), it will turn around and light up, and
if it's on, it will turn off again. In addition, each of its neighbours will
also switch. Different levels define their neighbourhoods in different ways,
which you will have to discover by experimentation, but on most levels, a
switch has neighbours above, below, to the left and to the right. A level is
completed when all the switches have been turned on.

   Use the R key to reset the current level. The Escape key quits the game.
