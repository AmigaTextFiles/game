         === Catch ===

   This game is all about timing. The only controls you need are your two
mouse buttons. When you click the left one, a line will emerge from the left
side of the screen, moving towards the right, and the opposite happens when
you click the right mouse button. When two of these lines meet, they become
a single solid line which sticks to the screen for a while. Using the solid
lines, you must catch all the blocks that come falling down the screen.

   The score is displayed on the left side of the screen. For each block
you catch, you get a number of points based on how far ahead of time you
managed to place the line that caught it. Displayed beneath the score is the
number of lives, which starts at five and is reduced by one every time a
block falls through.

   Use the Escape key to quit the game.
