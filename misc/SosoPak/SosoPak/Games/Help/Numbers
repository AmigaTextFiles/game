         === Numbers ===

   This is a mathematical puzzle. When you start the game, you will be
presented with nine rows of symbols, each one forming an equality of some
sort. However, if you count a little, you'll notice that none of them add up
correctly. One might say that "2+3=4-1", which is not true, because five is
not three. The task, then, is to rearrange each row so that it forms a valid
equality. In this case, "2+3-1=4" would be one possible answer. To make
things a bit more difficult, there is also a tenth row, or rather a column,
which cuts through the other nine.

   Numbers and symbols are moved using the mouse. Each one is drawn inside a
coloured box. Click on one of these boxes to select it, then click on
another box in the same horizontal row. They will then swap places. Clicking
on the selected box will deselect it. When one of the rows contains a valid
equality, it will light up in a different colour.

   The scoring is simple: you get 500 points for each horizontal row, and
the vertical one doubles that score. Use the buttons on the right side of
the screen to reset the puzzle or quit.
