         === Grid ===

   This game is an exercise in induction. You will be presented with sets of
images, which form a logical progression from left to right. One of these
images, usually the one at the end, has been replaced with a question mark.
The goal, then, is to figure out what the missing image should look like and
then draw it.

   In the lower right part of the screen is a grid of dots. You can draw
images by clicking on a dot, holding the mouse button down and dragging the
pointer from one dot to another. Dragging between two dots that are already
connected will erase the line between them. Note that it doesn't matter
where exactly on the grid you draw the image.

   When you have come up with an answer, you can click "submit" to have it
filed and move on to the next sequence. If you can't think of anything, you
can instead click "skip" to go ahead without submitting an answer, but you
can only do this five times per play. After that, the skip button gets
crossed out.

   The results are presented when you have gone through every available
series or when you click "finish", whichever comes first. The final score is
based on the number of correct and incorrect submissions, whereas skipping a
series has no effect on the scoring. From the results screen, you can then
either quit or have another go. The sequences are presented in a different
order every time you play.
