         === Atoms ===

   In this puzzle game, the goal is to recreate the five randomly chosen
patterns that are shown at the bottom of the screen. This is done by moving
five atoms inside a five by five square. To move an atom, start by placing
the mouse pointer over it. Arrows will then appear, indicating the ways it
can move. If it can move upwards, for instance, then an arrow will appear
above it. Clicking this arrow will cause the atom to move in that direction.
It will keep moving until it hits either another atom or the edge of the
square.

   The five patterns can be recreated in any order, but the score for each
one depends on the number of moves made, so the order must be chosen wisely
in order to obtain a good score.

   To start over with a new set of patterns, press N. Use the Escape key to
quit the game.
