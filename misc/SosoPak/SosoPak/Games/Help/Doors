         === Doors ===

   This is a maze game. The maze consists of walls and doors in different
colours. Most of the doors lead in and out of different rooms in the maze,
while a single door leads out of the maze itself. The goal is to reach this
final door and go through it.

   The player is represented by a yellow P, which can be moved around using
the arrow keys. The doors are represented by O's, which are open, and X's,
which are closed.

   The rules of the maze are these: when you go through an open door, all
the doors of that colour will change state. In other words, if you go
through a blue door, then all the open blue doors (including the one you
just used) will close, and all the closed blue doors will open.

   There are only four levels in this game. If you get stuck on one of them,
you can use the R key to restart it. The Escape key quits the game.
