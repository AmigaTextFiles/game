         === Bomb ===

   The goal in this game is to transport a bomb (or in any case a round
symbol which for historical reasons is called a bomb) to the right side of a
field. When starting a level, the bomb will rest somewhere on the left side
of the field, and it will remain there while you work on the level. When you
are done, click the bomb and it will start rolling towards the right.

   Of course, the field contains some obstacles, and these come in the form
of arrow blocks which alter the course of the bomb. When the bomb rolls onto
one of these arrows, it will start moving in the direction of the arrow.

   In order to make a path which takes the bomb across the field, the arrows
must be moved around. If you click one of them and hold the mouse button
down, you will notice that all the arrows in the corresponding row light up
in green. You can then move the pointer up and down, and the arrow blocks
will follow as far as they can go without leaving the field.

   When you think you have come up with a complete path, click the bomb to
set it rolling. If it reaches the other side of the field, you have solved
the level. If the path was incorrect, the bomb will eventually start going
round in a loop. Use the Escape key to stop it. The same key will also quit
the game when the bomb isn't rolling.

   Above the field is a row of icons representing the levels. You can click
on them to switch between the levels you have reached so far. Scoring is
simple: you get 1000 points per level solved.
