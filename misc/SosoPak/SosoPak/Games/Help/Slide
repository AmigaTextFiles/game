         === Slide ===

   This game presents a sliding tiles puzzle. There are four types of
levels, and these all have their particular rules which are described at the
bottom of the screen, but the objective is always to to produce some kind of
pattern by sliding the tiles around. Notice the gap where a tile is missing.
You can use the arrow keys on the keyboard to slide tiles into this gap. If
you press the down key, for instance, then the tile above the gap will slide
downwards to fill it. You can also use the mouse: click a tile next to the
gap and it will slide over.

   On the right side of the screen, there's a score display and a number of
buttons. The ones at the top are used to select the level type, and the ones
below the size of the level. To play at a certain size, you need to have
completed the previous size at least once.

   The scoring is based on the level type, on the size and on how many moves
you make. The best scores for each type of level are summed up to yield the
total hiscore for the game.
