   Welcome to SosoPak. This is a collection of simple casual games for the
Amiga. It's called SosoPak because the games are "so-so", but we hope that
they will still be somwhat enjoyable.

   To play a game, just select it from the list and click the 'play' button.
You can also click 'help' to show the manual for the selected game.

   Next to each game in the list is a number. This is your hiscore for that
game. Some of them don't have a scoring system, but most do. All the indiv-
idual hiscores are also added up to a total hiscore, which is displayed
separately.

   SosoPak was made by Krister Fundin. If you have any comments regarding
it, feel free to send them to <fundin@yahoo.com>.
