         === Sokoban ===

   This is a randomized and not particularly challenging variant of the
well-known puzzle game. The goal is to move a janitor, represented by a
yellow P, around a maze-like warehouse, pushing crates (pink dollar signs)
onto their designated spots (gray dots).

   Before you can start playing, you have to generate a level. This works
the same way as in Monster. Use the arrow keys to change the size of the
warehouse, the keys 1 and 3 to change the amount of walls, and the keys 4
and 6 to change the number of crates. These keys are also listed at the
bottom of the screen. Each change will result in a new level being randomly
generated. When you are satisfied with the result, press Enter to start
shuffling. The Escape key quits the game.

   During said shuffling, the game will try to move all the crates from
their initial positions, thus creating a playable level. This process can
take some time, and it doesn't really ever finish. Just press Escape when
you grow tired of waiting, and the game will begin. The number of crates
moved thus far is reported at the bottom of the screen. If it should stop
increasing, it's likely because the randomizer is stuck somewhere.

   During play, you control the janitor with the arrow keys. Push the crates
by moving into them. You can only push one crate at a time. The Escape key
aborts the current level. Afterwards, you can press R to replay, N to gene-
rate a new level or Escape to quit.
