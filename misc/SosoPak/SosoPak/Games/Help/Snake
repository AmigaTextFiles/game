         === Snake ===

   This game will probably look familiar. Use the arrow keys to control a
hungry worm (sic) searching for food. For every piece of food - represented
by yellow dots - that the worm eats, it grows a little. While hunting down
these little treats, you must avoid crashing into walls and soon also the
tail of the ever-growing worm itself.

   There will only be a single piece of food to collect at any time. Once it
is eaten, a new one appears. Waiting around for a too long will cause it to
rot away and be replaced.

   The game is split up in levels. Once the worm reaches a certain length,
you advance to the next level, which will contain more obstacles and require
more food to complete. If you crash, you have the option of starting over
from the beginning (by pressing S) or continuing from the current level (by
pressing C).

   Points are awarded for every piece of food eaten - more if you reach it
quickly - and deducted when you let the food rot. A bonus is awarded upon
completing a level, based on how many levels you have completed in a row
without crashing.
