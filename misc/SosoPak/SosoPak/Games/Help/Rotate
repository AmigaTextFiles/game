         === Rotate ===

   In this puzzle game, the goal is to light up all the grey circles. This
is done by moving them around. Each level has a set of rotators, which are
represented by blue blocks of various shapes. When you click on a rotator,
the larger circles will move one step along its perimeter. The small green
circles, however, are stationary, and whenever the larger circles wind up on
top of one of these, they will light up in green as well. A click with the
left mouse button causes a rotation "to the left", that is counterclockwise,
while a click with the right mouse button causes a clockwise rotation.

   You can switch between levels using the buttons in the bottom right part
of the screen. As usual, you can only reach the next level if you have
completed the current one at least once. The button in the middle resets
the current level. You can also press the R key to do the same, and the
Escape key quits the game.
