         === Puzzle ===

   In this game, abstract images have been cut into square pieces that have
become jumbled. The goal is to put the pieces back where they belong, thus
reconstructing the images. To make things a bit more interesting, the
colours keep moving around.

   The menu at the beginning of the game is rather self-explanatory. You can
click to select image, difficulty level and colour scheme. Higher difficulty
means smaller pieces and thus more of them. The colours are of no signifi-
cance to the game, so just pick the ones you like best. When you are done,
click "play" to go to the puzzle or "quit" to leave the game.

   The controls for the puzzle are equally simple. Click on a piece to
highlight it, and then click on another piece to swap the two. A highlighted
piece can be deselected by clicking it again. The border of the screen will
flash when you have solved the puzzle. Use the Escape key to return to the
menu.
