   This game is an exercise in pattern recognition. When the game starts,
you are presented with a view of a starry sky. Hidden among the stars are
five constellations. The goal is to find all of these and mark them. A star
can be highlighted by clicking on it. You can then click on another star to
connect them with a line, or to remove an existing line. When all the stars
of a constellation have been correctly connected to each other, it will be
highlighted in a different colour. The R key can be used to remove all lines
that aren't known to be correct.

   The five constellations can be previewed by pushing the keys from 1 to 5.
They will be shown at the centre of the screen in half their actual size.
Any key other than these will bring back the sky view.

   Use the Escape key to quit the game.
