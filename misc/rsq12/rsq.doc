-< LEGAL >-

RSQ is copyright 1996 by Paul van der Valk. This version is freely 
distributable. There is no warranty on this program. Use it on your 
own risk.


-< ABOUT THIS VERSION >-

This version features major improvements in playability. The main problem with
the previous version was that you could easily play upto level N by simply
waiting in a corner until the aliens (tm) had captured all men. This tactic
works no longer, because you are required to rescue a certain amount of men.

The best addition in this version is the upgradable ship. The initial poor 
ship stats (limited fuel and gunpower) make the game tougher and more 
challeging.

There are now 3 lives instead of just 1. The previous version was simply too 
easy for multiple lives. NOT ANYMORE :^)  Bonus ship every 5000 pts.

The gun can be locked diagonally by 'double-moving' up or down. Double-move
left or right to select straight mode.

Graphics update is a tad faster thanks to double layer view clipping.

RSQ is now launchable from WorkB*nch. No icon supplied, sorry. Pick your
favourite icon from the numerous MagicWB/Whatever archives available
elsewhere.

Levelcode mechanism implemented for skipping those boring first levels :^)

Two more levels (one scene), nine total.


Other:
Some adjustment to audio and color data. look-through-building bug solved.
Code and data optimized here and there. Bullet collision slightly improved.
Enforcer hit removed.



-< GAME RULES >-

Aim of the game is to rescue as many men as possible. They score 100 points
each. Additional points can be score by killing various enemies.

A level is complete when there are no men left. The score is then calculated
as follows:

   o The rewards for rescued men and destroyed enemies is summed.

   o This sum is added to the player's score.

   o This sum is added to player's money.

   o This sum is added to the player's skill level.

   o The player receives a penalty of 150 pts for each man that has either
     died or been captured by the enemy. This penalty is deducted from the
     skill level. If this falls below zero the player is forced to retire,
     no matter how many ships left.


-< SHIP UPGRADES >-

   o Seats
     Defines how many men can be carried by the ship. Default is 3.

   o Gun Power
     Defines the gun impact. Default = 3. An alien has a hull value
     of 10. It takes initially 4 hits to kill an alien ((10/3)+1).
     Better guns require less hits.

   o Autofire
     Not implemented in this version.

   o Gun cooling.
     Guns get hot. This device cools them down. All 4 of them. Costs energy.

   o Shield
     Not implemented in this version.

   o Shield Generator
     Not implemented in this version.

   o Fuel tank.
     Defines how much fuel can be carried. The default of 3 is more than
     enough for most situations. A value of 2 is tight but possible. 

   o Fuel Generator.
     Generates fuel. Costs energy.

   o Engine Speed
     Defines (horizontal only) speed. The default value of 3 is just fine.
     Lower values can be annoying. Higher values are dangerous to use
     because it requires better reflections to dodge bullets and stuff.

   o Engine acceleration.
     Not implemented in this version.

   o Energy
     Defines how much energy can be carried. You shouldn't have any need to
     upgrade this above level 3 unless you have upgraded other items
     (guns/cooling/refueler) heavily.

   o Energy Generator.
     Creates energy out of sunlight. In future versions the effect is
     probably influenced by the level-type (night levels will produce
     less energy).

Note: upgrades are downgraded 1 level when you die. As a compensation
for this the reward for rescueing a man is raised with 25.


-< DASHBOARD DISPLAY >-

   o Left
     Refueling-, Shield-, Gun- and Guncooling- energy used. If one of
     these options is disabled (because energy runs low) it will flash.
     Note that shields are not implemented in this version.

   o Leftish
     Number of men onboard. Will flash if maximum passenger capacity reached.

   o Center.
     Engine, fuel and shield bars. 
     Note that shields are not implemented in this version.
   
   o Right
     Gun temperatures. Will flash fast if overheated, and flash slowly
     if guns are disabled due to energy shortage.


-< GAME KEYS >-

   o Esc
     Aborts the game.

   o S
     Suicide key, for those occasions where you run out of fuel and haven't
     purchased a fuel generator.
