   Welcome to AFD-Guide!

   This AmigaGuide® document has two major purposes:

   @{fg shine}First@{fg text} of all I want to give you as developers more information about
                               @{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text}.

   This includes @{" Motivation " link INTRO} - Why shall you use @{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text}?
                 @{" Advantages " link ADVANTAGES} - What is so special about @{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text}?
                 @{" Rules      " link RULES} - How can you use @{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text}?
                 @{" Credits    " link CREDITS} - Who contributed to @{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text}?
 
   @{fg shine}Second@{fg text}, I want to help developers who don't know how to make AmigaGuide®
   documents for their own software. Therefore I collected some information
   by reading several guides, written by other people, to show you as much
   possibilities of AmigaGuide© as possible. This includes also some demos:

         @{" AmigaGuide-Demo    " link DEMO_E} - short English demonstration
         @{" AmigaGuide-Demo.de " link DEMO} - German demo for AmigaGuide douments

   @{b}Why shall you use @{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text}?@{ub}

   Well, why did I release it? - While I was reading several documentations
   of freely distributable Amiga software, I realized that there are several
   things I don't like. @{fg shine}First@{fg text} of all, it is a waste of time to read those
   parts of the documentation telling me that I can copy and re-distribute
   the package, that there is no guarantee, and so on... @{fg shine}Second@{fg text}, some docu-
   ments are not so clear about what the actual status of the software is.
   On one hand it says it is freeware, on the other hand the author would
   like to receive a gift or a mail from each user. @{fg shine}Third@{fg text}, most authors use
   their favourite text viewer as @{" DefaultTool " link DTOOL} in the icons of the docs.
   About 50% of these DefaultTools don't work, because I don't have the
   requested viewer or the path is incorrect.

   Also, some users who realized these problems don't read this copyright
   and distribution stuff at all. Others don't understand it properly
   because of their limited knowledge of the English language.
 
   Later, writing the documentation to my own FD-software, I realized that
   writing the copyright stuff myself is not so easy and is again a waste
   of time. Using a "pre-written" document would be much easier and I could
   use my time to improve my poor programming-abilities.

   That's why I released this @{" Standard Amiga FD-Software Copyright Note " link AFD-COPYRIGHT/Main}
   and used my contacts in the Internet to ask some people in different
   countries to make a @{" translation " link ADVANTAGES} in their language.

   I hope I can stop writing stuff about © when this Guide is finished!
@endnode
@node ADVANTAGES "AFD-Guide/Advantages of AFD-COPYRIGHT(TM)"

   @{b}What are the Advantages of @{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text}?@{ub}

   This Standard Copyright Note for Freely Distributable Amiga Software
   was inspired by the Standardized Amiga Shareware Group (SASG) and by
   the "GNU Public Licence" (created by the Free Software Foundation).
   There are no relations between the SASG, the FSF and @{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text}!!!

   - The "GNU Public Licence" is only for software placed in the "Public
     Domain" and every developer has to include the source code of the
     programs or (s)he has to make the sources available otherwise.

   - The SASG is a group of developers who want to improve the image and
     success of the concept of Shareware. For this aim they set some
     standards for the products becoming "SASG" products.

   @{bg shine}@{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text} is for all kinds of FD-Software the developers@{bg back}
   @{bg shine}want to keep the copyright of - from Freeware to Shareware!!!@{bg back}
 
   @{bg shine}You as a developer don't have to think about copyright stuff yourself,@{bg back}
   @{bg shine}because @{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text} has already been written and translated.@{bg back}

   So you can save a lot of time for more important things, for example
   - improve your product
   - fix more errors
   - improve the instructions to your product
   - make a bike tour...

   @{bg shine}The users of your product have to read @{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text} only if they@{bg back}
   @{bg shine}haven't done so before.@{bg back}

   The more developers include @{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text} in their software package,
   the better for this concept of a "standard licence"!

   @{bg shine}@{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text} is available in several languages via Aminet.@{bg back}

   So you can be quite sure that the users have read it at least once and
   did understand it. (The number in the name of this archive corresponds
   to the number of languages available in this release.)

   @{bg shine}This is also a first step to "localize" software.@{bg back}

   Currently @{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text} is available/under construction in

   @{" Danish        " link AFD-COPYRIGHT.dk/Main}   @{" English       " link    AFD-COPYRIGHT/Main}   @{" French        " link AFD-COPYRIGHT.fr/Main}   @{" German        " link AFD-COPYRIGHT.de/Main}

   @{" Italian       " link AFD-COPYRIGHT.it/Main}   @{" Luxembourgish " link AFD-COPYRIGHT.lu/Main}   @{" Norwegian     " link AFD-COPYRIGHT.no/Main}   @{" Polish        " link AFD-COPYRIGHT.pl/Main}

   Read @{" AFD-README " link AFD-README/Main} to get the latest information of the status of
   AFD-Files in the paragraph @{" Release Notes " link AFD-README/Main 50}.

   @{bg shine}You help to set a standard for @{" DefaultTools " link DTOOL}.@{bg back}

   Did I convince you to use @{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text}? Then have a look at the @{" rules " link RULES}.
@endnode
@node RULES "AFD-Guide/About the Rules in AFD-COPYRIGHT(TM)"

   @{b}If you want to include "@{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text}"(TM) in your own Amiga(TM)
   FD-Software package you have to follow the rules stated in
   "@{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text}"(TM), chapter 5 "DEVELOPERS INFORMATION".@{ub}
 
   In the following paragraph is further information about these rules.
   I hope my explainations are easy to understand.

a. Read @{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text} carefully  and make sure that you agree with the
   whole text WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS.

   Chapter 1 explaines the meaning of COPYRIGHT.
   Chapter 2 states the rules for DISTRIBUTION of the software.
   Chapter 3 is a DISCLAIMER.
   Chapter 4 tells the user about the RETURN SERVICE (or EQUIVALENT) (s)he
             has to provide.
   Chapter 5 is directed to all developers and invites them to become a
             member of the "AFD-Family" ;-)
   Chapter 6 says that @{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text}(TM) is itself COPYRIGHTED SOFTWARE!!!

b. Use the stated @{" DefaultTools " link DTOOL} in your @{" icons " link ICONS}!

c. Include a paragraph like the following in the manual to your product:

 ------8<-------------------------------------------------------------------
 This software is subject to the "Standard Amiga FD-Software Copyright Note"
 It is <type_of_software> as defined in paragraph 4<x>. @{fg shine}[...]@{fg text}
 For more information please read "@{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text}" (Version 1 or higher).
 ------8<-------------------------------------------------------------------
 
   This is probably the most important rule. In this paragraph you tell the
   user of your product that it is copyrighted and what the status of the
   package is. Future versions of @{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text} will keep the idea, but
   improove the rules, for example more DefaultTools or more FD categories.
   If you think there is a category missing in chapter 4 then please contact
   me!

   You should write your address near this paragraph. @{fg shine}Please do not forget
   to include your own address into the documentation of your product!@{fg text}
   If you upload your software to Aminet you should include this paragraph
   in the .readme to make @{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text} better known to the rest of the Amiga community.

   The @{fg shine}[...]@{fg text} says you can add further information here, but
   @{b}DO NOT MODIFY @{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text} IN ANY WAY.@{ub} (see above at "Chapter 6").

d. You have to include this file called "@{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text}"(TM) (English).
   IF you include an  AmigaGuide® hypertext documentation you can link it to
   this file or include the whole text  in the AmigaGuide® file  just as you
   like.  Please do not add more than  two translations of this file to your
   package. So your package doesn't get too big.

   Do not forget to add at least the English version of @{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text}!!!
   The files @{" AFD-README " link AFD-README/Main} and this "@{fg fill}AFD-Guide@{fg text}" are only meant to help you as
   developers, please do not add them to your package!
@endnode                      
@node DTOOL "AFD-Guide/DefaultTools"

   @{b}About the problem with different DefaultTools@{ub}

   When you de-archive freely distributable software you can find a lot of
   different DefaultTools for @{bg fill}ASCII text files@{bg back}, for example

   more,      C:More,     :c/more,     SYS:c/more,     MyDisk:c/more, ...
   muchmore,  C:MuchMore, :c/muchmore, SYS:c/muchmore, YourCD:c/MuchMore, ...
   multiview, ...

   and so on with smore, most, less, ppmore, ... and MuchMuchMuchMore!!

   The problem with this is that nobody has all these viewers, because you
   only need one of these to view ASCII-text files. So, what do you do now?
   Change all the "DefaultTools"? To much work! Make links for all the
   different entrys? Impossible - nobody can make enough links for all
   possibilities.

   With @{bg fill}AmigaGuide® hypertext files@{bg back} you have the choice between

   AmigaGuide, :Utilities/AmigaGuide, SYS:Utilities/AmigaGuide
   Multiview,  ...

   @{bg fill}IFF-ILBM pictures@{bg back} can be displayed using

   Display,    ... (AmigaOS 2.x)
   Multiview,  ... (AmigaOS 3.0+)
   Viewtek,    ...

   It would be much better when you have only one DefaultTool for each
   filetype:
             for @{bg fill}ASCII text files@{bg back}:            @{u}More@{uu}
             for @{bg fill}AmigaGuide® hypertext files@{bg back}: @{u}AmigaGuide@{uu}
             for @{bg fill}AmigaOS scripts@{bg back}:             @{u}IconX@{uu}         
             for @{bg fill}ARexx scripts@{bg back}:               @{u}RX@{uu}           
             for @{bg fill}configuration files@{bg back}:         @{u}Ed@{uu}
             for @{bg fill}Installer scripts@{bg back}:           @{u}Installer@{uu}        
             for @{bg fill}IFF-ILBM pictures@{bg back}:           @{u}Display@{uu}       

   Note that each filetype has it's own DefaultTool entry.
   So each user can use the tools (s)he prefers:

   @{u}More@{uu} is available since @{fg shine}AmigaOS 1.x@{fg text}.

   @{u}AmigaGuide@{uu} and @{u}Display@{uu} are available since @{fg shine}AmigaOS 2.0@{fg text}.

   @{fg shine}AmigaOS 3.0+@{fg text} users can make links on their preferred tools. These are
   the links I installed on my system in the directory SYS:Utilities

             @{u}More@{uu}       -> MuchMore
             @{u}AmigaGuide@{uu} -> Multiview
             @{u}Display@{uu}    -> Multiview

   Here are a lot of possibilities to use the favourite tools for @{fg shine}all users@{fg text}:

   - AmigaOS 1.0+: Rename YourViewer @{u}More@{uu}
     @{i}Probably the easiest way!@{ui}

   - AmigaOS 2.0+: Deft II (Freeware by Lionel Vinterat)
     @{i}Available on German-Disk #376, needs MUI 2.2+!@{ui}

   - AmigaOS 3.0+: MakeLink @{u}AmigaGuide@{uu} Multiview
     @{i}List generates incorrect output!@{ui}

   - AmigaOS 3.0+: MagicCX (function "ToolAlias") (Shareware by Kai Iske/SASG)
     @{i}Costs DM 30, but has a lot of other functions!
     @{b}WARNING!!!@{ub} ToolAlias changes the DefaultTool of your icons!!!
     Do NOT activate MagicCX while preparing your AFD-Product for release!
     This would cause trouble in fullfilling this standard!!!@{ui}

   - AmigaOS 3.0+: MCP (function "ToolAlias") (Mailware by ALiENDESiGN)
     @{i}MasterControlProgram is similar to MagicCX@{ui}

   - AmigaOS 3.0+: ExgExe (Exchange Executable) (Freeware by Stefan Hochmuth)
     @{i}Available on Saar-Disk #789!@{ui}

@node ICONS "AFD-Guide/Icons"

   @{b}About the icons in this archive@{ub}

   I included two different icons in this archive. Both icons are in
   "MagicWB"(TM) style and 3 bitplanes deep. The AFD text icon is my
   own work. You can add this one to your free-distributable package!

   I took the "AmigaGuide" icon from the package "RomIcons1", painted by
   Roman Patzner. "RomIcons" is Mailware! Roman's addresses are:

           Roman Patzner
           Maschl 91

   NOTE: the archives "AFD-Files1-03/../07.lha" contained 8-bitplane-icons!
   I changed them using OptIcon, found in Aminet:util/wb/ITools*

     were used to specify the terms under which AFD-COPYRIGHT may be used.

   "Standard Amiga FD-Software Copyright Note" and
   "@{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text}" are trademarks by Dietmar Knoll

   * I declared these names as trademarks  to avoid misuse of the ideas of
     @{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text}.  @{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text} is Freeware.  The name "Amiga" was used
     to specify @{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text}  to be usable  for Amiga software only,  not
     for making any profits by producing hardware under this name. There-
     fore I hope it is ok.

   "Amiga" is a registered trademark by ESCOM AG
   "AmigaGuide" is a registered trademark by ESCOM AG
   "AmigaDOS" is a trademark by ESCOM AG

   * These names were declared as trademarks and/or registered, because

   @{fg shine}Additional thanks@{fg text} to Roman Patzner for the "AmigaGuide" @{" icon " link ICONS}.

   @{fg shine}Special thanks@{fg text} to all @{" translators " link AFD-README/Main 45} for their efforts and support!

   @{fg shine}Very special thanks@{fg text} to these persons:

   @{b}Osma Ahvenlampi (Finland)@{ub}
   Osma was the first Amiga user I "met" on the Internet and he gave me
   a lot of important hints to use Email, FTP & @{" World Wide Web " link GAUHPIL}.
   I had a little discussion with Osma about @{" DefaultTools " link DTOOL}. I also took a
   lot of ideas from the copyright note in his package "TauIcons".

   @{b}Marco Musso (Italy)@{ub}
   Marco created the @{" Italian " link AFD-COPYRIGHT.it/Main} version of @{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text} and maintaines the
   "Amiga Developers Project", a @{" World Wide Web " link GAUHPIL} list of all Amiga
   developers in Italy.
   Marco asked me about the rule for @{" DefaultTools " link DTOOL}. From this I took the
   inspiration to make this Guide to tell you more about the whole concept
   and the @{" rules " link RULES}.

   @{b}Simon Dick (United Kingdom)@{ub}
   Simon was the first to send me an Email concerning @{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text}!
   He made the suggestion to add the @{" DefaultTool " link DTOOL} "Installer".

   @{b}Christian Kemp (Luxemburg)@{ub}
   Christian translated @{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text} to @{" French " link AFD-COPYRIGHT.fr/Main}. After this, he also tried
   to do the translation to @{" Luxembourgish " link AFD-COPYRIGHT.lu/Main}, but he is not quite sure about
   his own language!
   Christian asked to change the @{" icons " link ICONS} from 8 to 3 bitplanes, and
   he suggested to add the version string and the @{" trademark disclaimer " link TRADEMARKS}.

   @{b}Pål Løberg (Norway)@{ub}
   Pål is always a great help, maintaining the mirror of @{" GAUHPIL " link GAUHPIL} in
   Trondheim. He also created the @{" Norwegian " link AFD-COPYRIGHT.no/Main} version of @{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text}.
   Pål suggested to put an online-HTML-version of @{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text} in the
   @{" World Wide Web " link GAUHPIL}. This is still an option for the future...

   @{b}Urban Dominik Müller (Switzerland) and Matthias Scheler (Germany)@{ub}
   for administrating the @{" Aminet® " link AVAILABILITY} main archive.

   @{b}Stefan Schulz (Germany)@{ub}
   for including @{fg fill}AFD-COPYRIGHT@{fg text} in the @{" MeetingPearls CD " link AVAILABILITY}.

   @{b}Ole Friis Østergaard (Denmark)@{ub}
   Ole is the main administrator of @{" ATO " link ATO} and a great help in finding more

   Dies ist ein AmigaGuide-Demo, das die einzelnen Schlüsselwörter
   des Hypertext-Formats erklären soll.

   Alle Schlüsselwörter beginnen mit einem At-Sign "@" und dem Schlüsselwort
   DIREKT dahinter. In diesem Demo mußte ich einen Trick anwenden, um die Texte
   darstellen zu können. Die GROSS/klein-Schreibung ist anscheinend egal.

   Der Hauptknoten, der als @{b}Startseite@{ub} aufgerufen wird, heißt "Main"
   Daraus ergibt sich das Minimalformat des AmigaGuide®-Dokumentes:
   es besteht aus der @{" AmigaGuide-Kennung " link FORM} und dem Hauptknoten.

   Der Fenstertitel kann wegfallen, es wird dann der Nodename verwendet. Die
   Anführungszeichen sind nötig, falls der Fenstertitel Leerzeichen enthält.
   Der Fenstertitel kann auch in einer eigenen Zeile stehen:

    @Node Nodename
    @Title "Fenstertitel zu Nodename"

   Wenn @Prev und @Next weggelassen werden, wird einfach in der Reihenfolge
   geblättert, in der die Knoten aneinandergefügt sind.

   Wenn @TOC in einem Knoten fehlt, wird "Main" als Inhaltsseite (Table Of
   Contents) benutzt.

   Im Textknoten kann man folgende Steuerzeichen verwenden:

   All keywords begin with an at-sign "@" and the keyword DIRECTLY behind it,
   i.e. NO BLANK behind the "@"!!! (I had to use a trick to show the @ below).
   The case (UPPER/lower) of the keyword seems to have no meaning.

    @EndNode

   @{b}( The @-sign has to be in the first column of the line! )@{ub}

   The node named "main" will be shown first!
   If you leave away the window title, AmigaGuide® will use the nodename.
   The "emphasis" is needed, if the window title contains blanks (" ").
   The window title can be placed in a new line, using:

    @Node Nodename
    @Title "window title of nodename"

   @Prev and @Next will change the behavior of "browsing". Without this,
   you can browse the nodes as they are joined together in the document.
   If @TOC is missing, "main" will be used as "Table Of Contents".

   Inside the textnode you can use the following control codes:
