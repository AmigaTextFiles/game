          User Guide Notes



Overview

     The user guide will be split into two main sections: the user
documentation for the game, and for the level editing system.

     The game documentation will be written in the style of commercial
game documentation: that is, short and written in an easy to read style. 
Part of the game instructions will also be available to read from the game
itself (from a choice in the Options menu).

     The level editor documentation will, however, be written in a style
similar to commercial application: that is, more serious, in-depth and in
more of a reference manual style.

             Cantaloupe



Loading the Game

     Turn on your Amiga, wait for the "Insert Disk" prompt, and insert the
Cantaloupe disk.  When Workbench appears, double click on the disk icon,
and then double click on the Cantaloupe game icon.  The game will load in
a few seconds.


Installing the Game to Hard Disk

     Open the drawer of your hard disk that you want to install the game
into.  Insert the Cantaloupe disk, and wait for it's icon to appear.  Drag
the icon into the hard disk drawer you have opened.  Now load the game by
opening the newly created drawer, and double clicking on the game icon.


Starting the Game

     When the game has loaded, you will be presented with the title screen
sequence.  Press fire to bring up the Options screen.  Move the yellow bar
(using the joystick) to highlight an option, and press fire to activate
the option.  For the moment, highlight "Start the Game", and press fire. 
The game sequence will now begin, and you will be presented with the Get
Ready screen.  Press fire to start the level.


Aim of the Game

     In the game, you play the part of a red sphere whose sole reason for
being is to rid screens of tiles from the evil yellow/orange and pink
stripey tiles.  You move the sphere by using the joystick (push up to move
it up one tile, right to go right a tile, and so on), and destroy the
yellow/orange and pink stripey tiles by moving over them.

     However, there are other types of tile that can be moved over, to
either help or hinder your progress through a level.  It is probably best
to experiment with the different types, but here is a summary for
reference:

1.  Normal tiles:  These rather fetchingly chequered tiles can be moved
over freely without any ill effects.

2.  The yellow/orange stripey tiles:  These all have to be destroyed.  To
destroy a tile, simply move onto it, and then move off it.  The tile will
then disappear.  There is, however, quite a strict time limit on the
amount of time you may spend on one of these tiles before moving off it:
if you exceed this limit, the tile will be destroyed anyway, along with
your sphere.  You will then lose a life, and have to restart the level.

3. The pink stripey tiles:  When these are moved over, they will turn into
the yellow/orange stripey tiles, and will be treated as such from then on.
 However, you may move onto one, wait until you hear a bell sound
(whereupon the pink tile will have changed to a yellow/orange tile), and
then move off it.  As it has all ready been changed to a yellow/orange
tile, it will disappear as you move off it.

4. Ice:  Move onto one of these, and you will slide across it, moving in
the same direction as you were going when you moved onto it.  You have no
control over your movement when you are moving over these.

5. Horizontal/Vertical movement only tiles:  The horizontal movement only
tile will, surprisingly enough, only let you move horizontally, i.e. you
can only move on to and off of them using the left and right hand sides of
the tile.  Vertical movement only tiles are similar, but only allow
vertical movement.

6. Arrows:  Move onto one of these, and you will be moved, conveyor-belt
style, in the direction of the arrow.  For example, move onto an up-arrow
from any direction and you will henceforth proceed in a northerly
direction, whether you want to or not.

7. Teleport:  You can treat these as normal tiles if you just want to move
over them.  However, move over one and press fire, and you will disappear
only to reappear at another predetermined point on the level.

8. Switches:  Again, for moving-over-the-tile purposes, treat these as
normal tiles.  But pressing fire over one of them will toggle one or two
other "switchable" tiles on the level.  Switchable tiles have either a
tick or a cross on, and are either non-fatal or fatal to move over
respectively.  A tick will change to a cross, and a cross to a tick.

9. Exit:  When you have destroyed all of the yellow/orange and pink
stripey tiles, you may be at a bit of a loose end.  To now move to the
next level in the game, you must reach an Exit tile.  When you move over
this, you will disappear, and the level will be complete.  Exit tiles are
only functional once you have destroyed all the destructible (i.e.
yellow/orange and pink stripey) tiles on the level: before this point,
just treat them as normal tiles.

     It is recommended that you spend a few games just playing around with
the tiles, to see what each does, how they react in  different
circumstances, and so on.


How to Die

     Dying is easy to achieve, and sometimes necessary to do deliberately
(e.g. if the level has become impossible to complete).  There are four
main methods:
- Moving off a tile into a space where there is no tile.  You will fall
into the unrealistic water below and perish.
- Staying still too long on a yellow/orange stripey tile will cause you to
expire.
- Moving onto a fatal, changeable, crossed tile will be the cause of
shuffling off your mortal coil.
- Press either of the keys "D" or "Q" (D to die and restart the level, Q
to quit the current game and return to the title screen).  This will
result in you becoming an ex-sphere.  Sometimes pressing a key is the only
way to exit certain levels, as you may become trapped in a certain
combination of tiles (e.g. a down arrow above an up arrow: you will
continually move between the two tiles without being able to die).


Other Options Explained

     Here the other options in the options menu will be explained:
- Enter Password:  Allows you to enter a password using the keyboard. 
Only the current game's stages will be searched for the password you have
entered.
- Choose Game Number:  A game is simply a set of stages.  A stage is a set
of five levels.  You can choose which game you want to play (out of a
possible 1000) using this option: you may select which stage you want to
play in a game by entering a password (explained above).  Choose the game
number by using the arrows above and below each number.  To jump to the
next game number which has some stages in by using the "Next" button (to
search backwards, press the "Prev" button).  The number of stages in a the
game number selected will be displayed in the corner of the screen.  Press
"OK" to select that game number as the one you want to play.
- Read Instructions:  This will simply display a these instructions in a
more brief form.  Press fire to advance a page.
- Load and Save High Scores: Allows you to load and save the high score
table.  It will load or save it according to the currently selected game
number.  This means you could have up to 1000 different high score tables
stored on disk, keeping a high score table for each game.
- Exit:  Go back to the title screen (useful to see a newly loaded high
score table).


Entering a New High Score

     If you score highly enough, you may qualify for a high score.  Use
the mouse or joystick to highlight and select (press fire or mouse button)
whichever letters make up your name.  You can also use the keyboard to
type in your name.  Your name will be displayed at the bottom of the
screen as it is being entered.  When using the mouse or joystick, use the
characters <Del> to delete your last letter entry, <Spc> to add a space,
and <End> to finish entering your name (on keyboard, use the backspace
key, the space bar, and the return key to achieve the same effect).

            Level Editor



How to Load

     To load up the level editor, simply turn on (or re-boot) your Amiga
and insert the disk with the level editor on.  The disk should boot, and
the Workbench screen should soon appear.  Double click on the disk icon,
and then double click on the "LevelEditor" icon in the window that has
just appeared.  The program will now load up and initialise.


Installing onto Hard Disk

     Assuming that you have all ready installed the game (see game user
guide), firstly boot your Amiga from your hard disk, and then open the
drawer the game is in.  Insert the disk with the level editor on, and
double click on the disk icon.  Now simply drag the "LevelEditor" icon
across from the floppy disk to the hard disk drawer you have opened.

     To run it form hard disk, simply boot from hard disk, open the drawer
the game and level editor are in, and double click on the "LevelEditor"
icon.


Loading and Saving Stages

     Stages are blocks of five levels (or screens of tiles).  A "game" is
a group of stages (any number from 0 to 100 stages can be in a particular
game.  There can be up to 1000 different games stored).

     If you know which stage you want to load, and know which game it is
in, the quickest way is to type in the game and stage numbers in the
particular boxes on the main menu.  To do this, click on the box with the
mouse, and type in the number using standard Amiga editing facilities
(e.g. backspace, delete, cursor keys,etc.).  Once you have entered this,
click on the "Load Stage" button.  Similarly, to save a stage in memory to
disk, type in the stage and game numbers you want it saved as, and click
on the "Save Stage" button.

     However, most of the time you will not be sure of the numbers, and
whether they actually exist or not.  In these cases, click on the "Choose
Stage" button on the main menu, and a new screen will open.


Choose Stage

     The main function of this screen is to select which numbers will go
into the game and stage boxes on the main menu.  There are two main lists
on this screen: a list of the games that exist, and a list of stages that
exist in the selected game.  Select a game by clicking on it's number in
the game list: the stage list should update immediately.  Select the stage
you want by clicking on the number in the stage list.  The numbers in the
Game and Stage boxes should update automatically.  Clicking on "OK" now
will return you to the main menu with the relevant numbers transferred
from this screen.  However, there are other functions the screen can
perform.

     The stage list is a list of the stage numbers that exist in the game,
along with the passwords for each of them.  Usually, the passwords can
help to identify which stage is which.  You can edit the passwords for an
entire game without having to load each stage in by:
- Selecting a game from the list
- Select a stage from the list
- Edit the password in the password box
- When all passwords have been edited (as shown in the list), click on the
"Save Passwords" button.

     The "Auto-save passwords?" tick box represents whether the password
list will be automatically be saved whenever the game number is changed. 
If it isn't ticked, a requester will be opened each time you change games
(and you've altered the password list) asking if you want to save it.

     There is a bank of buttons along the bottom of screen.  Here the
following functions can be accessed:

"Create Stage":  Will create a blank stage, of the number you have entered
in the stage box.  To create a new game, simply enter the new game number
in the game box, and press Enter.  It will be created automatically.

"Delete Stage" & "Delete Game":  These will delete the selected stage or
game.  Be careful, these functions are non-reversible, and data will be
lost forever.

"Compress Game":  Will renumber all of the stages in the game, preserving
their order, starting from 0 and increasing in steps of one.

"Validate Game":  This will validate all the files for the current game
number.  It will make sure they are all present, and in some cases check
that they contain the correct information (some files cannot be checked
like this).  It will create any missing files.

"Validate All":  Basically performs the same operation as "Validate Game"
for all the games that exist, and also check extra files that concern the
entire list of games.

"Load Stage" & "Save Stage":  These perform the same operations as they do
on the main menu (i.e. load the selected stage into memory, or save the
stage in memory to the selected stage number).

"OK" & "Cancel":  These both return you to the main menu.  OK will return
the new values for the Game and Stage to the main menu:  Cancel will
simply return you to the main menu, replacing the new values of Game and
Stage with what they were before you called up the screen.


Selecting the level

     To select which level you wish to edit, on the main menu, simply
click on the box next to the appropriate number.  You can edit the time
limit for the selected level in the same way as you did for the game and
stage numbers.  The time limit will be in seconds, and automatically
stored once entered.




Check for Errors

     Clicking on the "Check for Errors" button  will quickly look through
all the levels in memory to check for any basic errors that can be picked
up.  The errors found will be presented in a list form underneath the
button.  The errors it will find would be ones such as whether each level
had a comment, an Exit tile, any destructible tiles, unconnected switches
and teleports, and whether the start position is safe or not.  It cannot
detect whether a level is can be completed or not.

     The errors will contain the level number it refers to, and
coordinates where applicable.  For example:

     1: Unconnected switch (12,5)

     This means that there is an unconnected switch at coordinates (12,5)
on the first level.


Edit Comment

     Clicking on this button on the main menu will allow you to enter a
comment for the selected level.  It will be displayed on the "Get Ready"
screen before the level.


Test Level

     The "Test Level" option allows you to try out the selected level
(useful for testing whether a level can be completed or not).  It will
simulate the game as if the selected level has just been reached.  For
details of how to play the game, please refer to the game user guide.

     When the level has been either completed or the player has died, a
screen will appear informing you of how long was spent playing the level. 
This can be very useful to decide what time limit to set a for a level.


Edit Level

     This main menu option allows you to actually edit the selected
level's map.  The map display shows how the level looks at present.  To
alter the level map:
- Select a tile type by clicking on the row of tiles at the bottom of the
screen (you can also use the cursor keys for this).  The selected tile
type should now have an arrow above it.
- Move your mouse into the map area.  The tile follows your mouse over
this display.  Decide where you would like to place the tile, move the
mouse there and press the left mouse button.

     Click on the left and right arrows next to the level number to move
up or down a level.  The map display will update automatically.  Use this
as a short-cut so you don't have to go back to the main menu just to
change the level number.

     When you click on the "Clear" button, the current level will be
cleared of tiles.  This operation is irreversible.  Click on "Exit" to go
back to the main menu.

     There are also four other options available at the bottom of the
screen, and all work in more or less the same way.  The icons mean, from
left to right:
- Connect teleport with destination tile
- Link switch with one changeable tile
- Link switch with two changeable tiles
- Choose start position

     For the first three, after pressing the icon, you should then click
on a teleport or switch (whatever it says on the message line at the top
of the screen).  You will then be asked to click on another tile (either
the destination or changeable tile(s)).  If you have previously set the
tiles, you may see where they are by pressing the right mouse button at
this point.  A message ("To:") will appear over the default tile.  You may
choose any legal tile by moving your mouse over it and pressing the left
mouse button.

     To choose the start position, simply click on the icon and then the
tile position you want the player to start at.  Again, to view the current
start position, click on the icon, then move your mouse over the map and
press the right mouse button.

     To abort any of these operations, move your mouse off the map and
press the left mouse button.  At any time, you may look at the message
line which will tell you what you should be doing.


Quitting the Program

     Get to the main menu, and click on the "Quit Program" button.  You
will be asked to confirm your choice, and if you do the program will end
and leave you with a Workbench screen.  Please remember to save your work
before you do this, as if you don't it will be lost forever.
