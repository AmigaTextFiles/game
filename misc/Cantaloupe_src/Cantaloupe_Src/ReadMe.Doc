                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Contained in this drawer are all the documents that I used when I
submitted Cantaloupe as my A-Level project.  There are many diagrams and
screenshots that were in the project, but not included here for reasons of
space.  All the text that was used is included, however, and I hope it
will be of use especially to:

- People wanting to update either Cantaloupe or it's level editor for
their own use (the Maintenance document is of specific interest here)

- A-level students compiling their own project.  It is often helpful to
have a look at other projects for ideas about what sort of subjects could
be covered in their's.  My project is by no means perfect, and it is based
around a rather unusual choice of program style, but it did get full
marks.

- Anyone interested about finding out how the program was designed and
then implemented.

The main programs have been updated since the project was written: for
instance, there is now no high score table, and there are now different
graphic sets that can be used.  However, most of the program has remained
the same, and the majority of the documents remain relevant.

The Contents.doc file contains a list of section and chapter headings. 
All the documents from each section can usually be found in a single file,
as described below:

Section                                     Document
~~~~~~~                                     ~~~~~~~~
Analysis                                    Analysis.doc
Design  (Chapters 2.1 - 2.11)               Design_Pt1.doc
Design  (Chapters 2.12 - 2.18)              Design_Pt2.doc
Implementation and Testing                  Imp_Test.doc
User Documentation                          User.doc
Maintenance Documentation                   Maintenance.doc
Examiner's Notes                            Exam.doc

Some of the faults of the project should be noted:  the style of writing
is often too informal, and it is much longer than a usual project due to
the complicated program.

Needless to say, if you are involved in writing an A-level project, these
documents should be for REFERENCE ONLY.  If you include any of them as
your own work, you may automatically fail all your A-levels, or worse,
depending on your examining board.  I have notified most British examining
boards that I am distributing my A-level Computing project electronically.

Finally, I hope that these documents are useful to you, and relevant to
whatever you want them for.
