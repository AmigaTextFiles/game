Identification of Problem

     For my computing project, I have decided to write a computer game.
This will be of the puzzle genre, and I will also design and implement a
level designer utility, which will allow either me or another user to
easily design levels for the game. A fuller description of the game style
will be detailed later.


Justification for Project

     I chose this project for a number of reasons. Firstly, it is a
project I actually want to program. The game is loosely based on an old
Commodore 64 public domain game, which I really enjoyed when I had that
computer. The game successfully combined both tactical thinking and the
need for arcade dexterity. Now I have upgraded to a more powerful machine,
I often wish I could still play the game. So instead of waiting for
someone else to release a similar game, I decided to program it myself:
this way I could also add more features to the game, which will hopefully
improve the depth of the game, and of course improve the aesthetics of it.

     Secondly, the project should be an interesting challenge. I spend a
good deal of my time actually playing games, and it will be entertaining
to follow the process of planning, designing, documenting and programming
a game in the same way that commercial games are (but on a smaller scale,
obviously).


Identification of User

     Although I was initially producing the game for my own use, I am
designing it with a view to it being distributed in the public domain. 
This will force me to be more professional in my system design, make me
produce a more user-friendly interface and also ensure that the programs
are reliable and basically foolproof. This wouldn't have been necessary if
I was programming the game for my own use, as I would know what could and
couldn't be done, and how to do it.

     Other aspects of the system will also have to be modified slightly.
As most PD games are distributed on disk only, without any manuals or
packaging, there will have to be on-disk documentation as to how to use
the system. This could allow possibilities such as hypertext, which would
have to be looked into.

     As it is basically a tile based puzzle game, there isn't really a
target age for the proposed user.  Puzzle games, in general, have a wide
appeal across all age ranges, from about 10-12 years upwards.  A good
example of this is Lemmings, an extremely popular puzzle game with old and
young alike.

        Present Game Design



Outline

     In this section, the present game as it stands will be described. The
improvements to the game that I am considering making will be documented
in the following section.  The design of the actual system and programs
needed to create the game will be looked at in the Design section.


Brief description of game

     As mentioned previously, the game is one of the puzzle genre.  The
player controls a craft that he moves around the game screen.  The screen
consists of a variety of tiles, each of which has a purpose, such as
having to be destroyed, restricting the movement of the player, certain
death, and so on.  The tiles in the present game are described in detail
below.

     The screen will consist of an arrangement of tiles in a rectangle,
around 20 tiles across and 10 tiles down.  The player's craft is about the
size of 1 tile, and can move either up, down, left or right in increments
of one tile.  Spaces are also allowed in this grid: if the player moves
his craft into either a space (where there is no tile) or out of the range
of the grid, then the craft is destroyed.

     There is one special type of tile that is "destructible".  It is
destroyed by the player moving onto the tile, and then moving off it.  The
aim of the game is for the player to destroy all the destructible tiles,
and then to move to an "Exit" tile.  This will complete a level, and the
player will proceed to play the next level.

     This is a brief description of the game style, and should become
clearer as the project progresses.


Types of tile

Normal: Has no adverse effect on the player. He can move around on these
freely.

Destructible: These have to all be destroyed before the player can exit
the level.

Double-Destructible: These too have to be destroyed, but the player can
either travel over these once or twice to destroy them.

Teleports: When landing on one of these tiles, the user can teleport to
another predetermined tile on the level.

Vertical/Horizontal only: These are similar to normal tiles, but can only
be entered and left by certain sides of the tile.

Exit: This is the tile the player must reach after destroying all the
appropriate blocks to complete the level.

No Tile: If the player encounters either the edge of the grid of tiles, or
a space in the map, the player's craft will be destroyed.


Basic Game Structure

     The player will start with a certain number of lives, this amount
decreasing every time the player dies. When this happens, the current
level is reset to it's initial state, and the player can then attempt it
again. A scoring scheme is also used, although there is no way to compare
different players other than to note down the scores manually.  If a level
is successfully completed, the next level is then attempted.  If all a
player's lives are lost, he must then restart the game at the very first
level.

         Game Improvements



Deficiencies of Current Game

     As it stands, the game is very good: the game structure is original,
the levels are well designed, and the control method is easy to use. 
However, this is not to say that it can't be improved, which is what I
will be attempting to achieve in my project.


Suggestions for improvement

     Here I will outline some ways in which I think the game system could
be improved: I will later examine these suggestions in more depth.

- More tile types.  These will have different effects on the player, and
allow for a more complex, sophisticated, level design.
- The inclusion of time limits for the levels
- Allowing passwords to be used to skip levels
- A high score table
- A way to edit and design new levels


More tile types

     Having sat down and thought about this quite a lot, I came to the
conclusion that the original set of tiles was somewhat comprehensive. 
Indeed, the variety of the levels in the original game paid testament to
this.  I did manage, however, to come up with a few more tile types that
the game could benefit from.

     The first two types affect the movement of the player in the level:
the second two will control access to different parts of the level.

Ice: The player slides over these tiles in the direction they were
travelling, with no control until they reach another type of tile.

Arrows: These send the player in the direction of the arrow: the player
has no control until another type of tile is reached.

Switches and Switchable blocks: When a switch tile is activated, a
switchable block is deactivated. Initially, the switchable blocks can
either be lethal (i.e. the player is destroyed on contact with such a
tile) or normal. One switch can control up to two of these blocks,
toggling them between lethal and normal blocks.


Time Limits

     Initially, I had apprehensions about adding a time limit to levels,
whereby the player's craft is destroyed if the level isn't completed in a
certain time.  After all, it is a puzzle game, and the levels should be
thought about, mused over, a route decided, and then executed.  If a time
limit was implemented, all the player would do if he were stuck on a level
would be to sketch the level onto paper, and think about it then.  This
would be a waste of time and paper and could easily be avoided.

     I then hit upon the idea of making time limits optional. If the
player completes the level within a certain time, he gets bonus points: if
he doesn't, he doesn't.  Either way, the level is complete and the player
will move to the next one.  This will provide the experienced player who
is replaying the level an extra goal to achieve.  In fact, different
strategies may have to be employed to complete it in the least time
possible.


High Scores and Passwords

     A high score table will be implemented, whereby the scores and names
of the best players will be stored and displayed.  I also hope to be able
to let the user save these scores to disk, so they are not lost when the
computer is turned off.

     Passwords will also be used, to allow the experienced player who has
played the game previously to bypass the earlier, tedious levels (most
levels will become slightly boring once they have been completed once). 
This was one of the greatest deficiencies of the original game, as when
the player was stuck on the 23rd level, he would be allowed 5 tries (or
however many lives he had) and would then have to complete the previous 22
levels again to get back to the point they were previously at.


Level Editor

     One of the biggest improvements to the game would be a way to edit
and create new levels.  This would allow players to set their own
challenging levels, and possibly distribute these to others who own the
game.  The level editor will be described in much more detail in the
Design section.

            Specification



Specification

     I have decided that the following criteria should be fulfilled when
designing the system:

- The game screen itself should update at 50Hz (the same rate as a
domestic PAL television set). This will mean the game will run smoothly,
and therefore appear as professional as possible.
- The inclusion of all the tile types specified in sections 1.2 and 1.3
- The limit to the number of levels in the game will only be the capacity
of the storage medium.
- The use of passwords and a high-score table.
- The introduction of time limits for bonus points
- The ability for anyone to easily edit the levels, and design their own.
- A range of new levels designed
- The overall aesthetic improvement over the original game
- The game should be suitable for distribution in the public domain
