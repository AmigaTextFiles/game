 Devasoft is unleashing the first in its lineup of new educational programs
 for young minds.  AMY'S FUN-2-3 ADVENTURE is the premier title to be
 released in a planned series of programs whose target audience is in the
 2 to 6 year old age group.  Each title will star a cute, playful little
 puppy named Amy, who helps make learning more fun and exciting.
 
 In Amy's Fun-2-3 Adventure, Amy introduces children to numbers and counting
 by taking them through a variety of entertaining activities.  In much the
 same way as a quality video game is presented, each activity employs great
 graphics and smooth, detailed animation to get its point across.  Digitized
 speech and sound effects further enhance learning and play action, making
 the program a joy for children to use.


 Some of the features that make Amy's Fun-2-3 Adventure so special include:
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   *  Beautiful overscan graphics and smooth animation

   *  Easy child-friendly mouse input.  No typing required!

   *  Lots of digitized speech and sound effects.

   *  4 fun-filled locations for your child and Amy to play in.

   *  A music section where your child can easily play one of 8 different
      children's songs. (Or they can make up one of their own!)


 Other features which make Amy's Fun-2-3 Adventure more convenient:
 ------------------------------------------------------------------

   *  Hard drive installable.

   *  Workbench V2.0 compatible.


 System Requirements
 -------------------

   *  Any model Amiga computer with at least 1 meg of ram.

   *  Workbench version 1.3 or 2.04.


 There are four locations where your child can play with Amy.  They include:

   AMY'S DOGHOUSE
   --------------
 A visit to Amy's Doghouse should be the first stop for your child.  Here,
 numbers and counting are introduced through a variety of graphically rich
 animations.  At the top of the screen are tiles with the numbers 1 through
 10 on them.  By clicking on one of the tiles, an animation will proceed
 that will both visually and audibly count out the number that was clicked
 on.  For instance, if the number 5 was clicked on, Amy might bounce a
 ball on her nose 5 times.  As she bounces the ball, a digitized voice will
 count along with the animation, allowing your child to both see and hear
 what the number represents.

   MATCHING WITH MARTY
   -------------------
 Amy has a computer friend named Marty the Match Machine.  Marty helps your
 child learn to count by putting up 2 different sets of shapes and 1 number
 on his 3 screens.  If your child chooses the shape set whose quantity is
 represented by the number in the center screen, he or she can get Marty to
 give Amy a treat as a reward.  Choosing correct answers keeps Amy very
 happy, but choosing a wrong one will make an unhappy Amy express her sad
 discontent.

   MUSIC MAGIC
   -----------
 Children love to play music.  In the Music Magic Room they can compose
 melodies of their own design or choose from up to 8 different children's
 songs to play.  Playing one of the children's songs is easy -- at the
 upper right hand of the screen is a box which displays a number.  By
 hitting the xylophone key with the matching number on it, the first note
 of the song is played.  Another number will scroll into the box and by
 matching that number, the second note will be played.  Amy dances as the
 correct keys are hit, but stops and waits patiently when an incorrect
 choice is made.

   COOKIE CASTLE
   -------------
 High atop Majestic Mountain sits Cookie Castle, home to King Cookie.  Amy
 loves to visit her friend the King, but on one particular visit, Danny
 Dragon got there right berfore she did and puffed down one of the castle
 walls.  Of course, when King Cookie asked if she could help rebuild it,
 she said yes right away!  So, with the help of Amy and your child, Cookie
 Castle will be as good as new again.  All your child has to do is follow
 Amy's instructions and the castle wall will be up before you know it.
 And of course when the job is done, you know the reward will be one of
 King Cookie's delicious cookies!



 Devasoft is committed to producing the finest in educational software.
 Future titles to be released in Amy's series include AMY'S PLAY-B-C
 TIME, which presents the alphabet to youngsters.  This and other programs
 will be available in 1992, and follow the formula set forth in Amy's
 Fun-2-3 Adventure -- great high-quality graphics and sound, smooth
 animation, and Amy, for a fun-filled time!


 A note from the author:

 Amy's Fun-2-3 Adventure is dedicated to the real Amy, who loves to eat
 cookies and doggie treats as much as, if not more then the video version
 of herself.  Ruff!
