How to Play
~~~~~~~~~~~
If  you  make  a  mess  of  what you are about to do, press the right mouse
button  on  the fourth icon(button) from the left then type begin and press
enter.   This  restarts  you.   Although all commands can be typed into the
computer  (type  what  you like), this introduction is for use of the mouse
although  it should also be read by keyboard users.  The only time you have
to type is if you are talking to characters, fixed mouse options here would
ruin  the  game.   To some mouse use may at first seem awkward but you will
learn  very  quickly  what  each  icon  on the screen is for.  There are no
sub-menus.

The  adventure  starts  in  the village inside Dikes Tavern.  You leave the
tavern  to  talk with a rider.  It is a pre-arranged meeting.  The rider on
his  horse  is depicted in the character window.  This picture then changes
to  a  portrait  of  the  rider,  finally  to  be replaced by a portrait of
yourself.   This is the point where you make your last disk change and take
control of the game.

Follow these instructions very carefully:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Firstly  press key 0(zero) to disable the icons.  The systems window at the
very  top  of  the screen will indicate that they are disabled.  Click each
icon  in  turn  to  find  out  their  use,  then press key 0(zero) again to
re-enable  the  icons.  Look at the top of the screen to make sure they are
working  again.  Keyboard users should note that when you click on an icon,
the  words  written  in  the systems window at the top of the screen can be
typed in and usually abbreviated to three letters depending on the command.

Now  we will check out the modes.  You are at present in command mode where
your  computer  expects to be given commands.  We will change this to 'talk
mode'.  Click your left mouse button on the fourth icon from the left.  The
words  'start  talking'  will  appear in the bottom left hand window.  Type
hello then press enter.  A keyboard user could press key '3' or type in the
wording at the top of the screen which is 'talk'.  For entering and leaving
talk mode the words 'Lo' and Bye' may also be used.


To complete a simple task.  During the game you will be given directions to
particular  places.   Because  of the sheer size of the landscape each move
you  make  is  around  two leagues.  That doesn't mean there isn't anything
between  moves,  these in between places contain what you could call hidden
locations.  One location is where you are standing.  Click your RIGHT mouse
button  on  the  seventh  icon  from  the  right,  which operates the 'seek
locations'  icon  (Keyboard  users  should press key '2' to exit talk mode,
then  type  'see'  or  'seek  locations'.  This will move you to a location
north  of Dikes Tavern.  Now press the left mouse button on the eighth icon
from  the  right  to  knock  on the door.  No-one is home.  Press the right
mouse  button  on the same icon to break in.  Now you are in press the left
mouse  button on the seventh icon from the right to investigate.  You see a
piece  of  parchment.   Click  your  left  mouse button on the examine icon
(sixth  from  the  right).   It will tell you what the parchment says.  You
would  do well to note the words.  Now click your right mouse button on the
third icon from the right to move southward, back to Dikes Tavern.

Note  the  double  use  of  some  icons....seek(as in investigate..look for
objects)  and  seek  locations(look  for  secret  places).  Knock/Break in.
Drink/Obtain water(This is water to carry with you).

To  test  battle  mode click the right mouse button on the second icon from
the right to move east.  Click this icon a total of four times.  Ignore the
character  you  pass  on the way.  You will not be allowed your fourth move
because  a bandit will intercept you.  You have no option but to click your
left  mouse  button on the crossed swords icon.  This does not have to be a
life or death scenario.  Press the space bar well away from the 'be killed'
option.   You  may be penalised or rewarded depending on the outcome of the
battle.   Battle mode is a backdrop to the game, bandits rarely stay in the
same location for more than a day, though they will return.

If  you  wish  to  use  a  joystick  to  move around, simply move it in the
direction  you want to travel(as on the compass), then let it return to the
centre position and press the fire button.

The  final  mode  is dream mode.  This is important because it tells of the
future  (where you came from), and gives game hints.  Press the right mouse
button  on  the  third  icon from the right to move south and avoid further
tangles  with  bandits.  Press the left mouse button on the sixth icon from
the  left  to rest or make camp.  Click on this until night falls, when you
will  sleep  and dream (The character window at the top right of the screen
denotes  the  time  of  day).  You will be told what you are dreaming.  The
disk  version  does  not support the hard drive animations.  When the dream
has ended type 'begin' to restart the game.


GAME STARTS in search of the staff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You  have  left  the  tavern  to  talk to the rider so click the left mouse
button  on  the fourth icon from the left.  Click on the question mark next
to  the  talk  icon,  this  will  give  a choice of questions.  Some of the
questions  are  scrambled  but  you  should be able to figure out what they
mean.  You can type in the questions how you wish, but this being the first
time  you  have  played  it  is probably as well to type them in order.  If
there  is  anything about the answers you don't understand, query them.  If
you  are asked a question you probably would be as well answering it.  Just
type it as you would say it.  There is no realism in any other manner.

The  last  question  is  'what  can  i  do'.   Normally you will be given a
suggestion.   It  is wise to follow friendly suggestions.  The adventure is
not  about  roaming  around aimlessly.  Sometimes during a conversation you
may be given more than one suggestion.  You must follow your own instincts.
At  the  start of the game the first character will pass you on to a second
character.   Before  moving  off  it is as well to query any names you have
been  given  such  as  'who is zarrion' or 'where is carthelion'.  When you
move,  it  is  well worth reading the text readout as you move to your next
destination.   When  you  talk  to  the  second  character,  again see what
questions  are  available.   Also  keep in mind that previous questions are
still  valid, especially 'what can i do'.  When you leave this location you
should know where you are going and how to get there.

To  save  and load type savegame and loadgame, preferably between locations
of  interest.   Sometimes  it  is  inconvenient  for  the  game to save and
sometimes  it  will  refuse  deliberately, like in a fight.  Every time you
save,  the  last  saved  game is overwritten.  It saves clogging disks.  It
takes a while to save a game.  Reloading is very fast.

Hangups:   There  is one for those who like to type their commands and that
is  remembering to switch between talk and command modes.  If someone tells
you  to  go east, a natural reaction is to simply tap the 'e' key and press
enter.   Of course all you are actually doing is saying 'e' to whom you are
speaking  with.   Unlike  mouse  operation  or joystick operation, keyboard
operation  requires  you  to change between command and talk modes manually
(keys  2 & 3).  There are of course some advantages with using the keyboard
over  the  mouse.  For instance the examine icon will only examine what you
have just obtained, while typing allows you to stipulate things.  More info
is given in the game instructions, which should be read.

A couple of hints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The young girl knows...what riddle.

The  order  of  the  five  letters correspond to the order of five location
numbers which are usually zero.  They fit together in a certain way.
