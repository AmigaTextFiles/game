NSX (NIBBLER SUPER EXTRA)
===========================================================================
PREFACE

	This is the last clone for Nibbler. I'm sure that there will be
no more nibbler clones after this.......

	Sure?....yes.......

	Simply.... assign it and play it... You'll understand why....

	Go on, do it....

============================================================================
PLAYING FROM DISK:

	Simply copy all files to a disk and name it as "nsx"...
	and make the first line of your startup-sequence as: 

		nsx-free.exe

PLAYING FROM HARD DISK:

	Copy all files to a directory in your hard-drive. Add a line
	to your 'startup-sequence' or 'user-startup' as;

	ASSIGN "nsx:" <your directory name, with full path>

	change directory to where nsx is and run the file: nsx-free.exe

ABOUT THE PREVIEW VERSION

This is the preview version of NSX. It only includes 5 levels to make you see
what will the game look like..... We have 55 levels in 11 worlds, with
different gfx and anims.... But the main idea is all the same.........

This game is tested on several A500 and A1200 configurations,
it worked ok, we didn't try it on A600s and A4000's but i think it works...
By the way the use of this program is at your own risk...We removed the
'hi-sc save' routines to guaratie and we also think that it's pretty harmless
but be carefull and use LEFT mouse button in the game to exit this preview..

Final version will be released very soon.... with a little shareware fee...
(I don't think but maybe)... The release date is not certain yet but it will
be released as soon as that some little bugs are removed..

I will be glad to reply you....

DETAILS AND GREETS

I've been working on NSX since April 1994... Yes, april, 1994. With some 
big delays because of some problems with myself... And as you might guess,
even it is not easy to remember all labels you give and remember all routines
you write if you are not opening it for 4 months..... If I decided to release
this preview when it was possible, it would be in July 1994. But if you think 
that this game is nearly one man (one lazy man) production, you may understand 
me...

Now, I like to thank to;

- Me (Mehmet Ali 'Malice' Sahin)
	For my great effort on code and gfx.... It's not easy to finish the
	code after looooong delays and gfx after the job. I've been working
	for a multimedia company since May 1994.

- Turbo (Tunc Dindas):
	For his 'warp,title,gameover' graphics, testing, ideas for extras.
	.... and being in the project from the beginning and supporting me.

- Cerebroid (Onat Cakit):
	For his promises about music.... and supports.

- Gart (sysop of the Split 7 BBS):
	For his help to reach the files between me and tunc when we couldn't
	meet and for play testing...

- H. Bilen Orak Turkel:
	For being my sister's LOVELY son and play testing....

- Edgar M. Vigdal:
	For his GREAT Deluxe Galaga and forcing me to finish this with
	his successes and being a friend of mine...

- Danny Wong:
	For his patience while waiting my graphics for his upcoming version
	of 'Amiga MaJong'... wait and get it, it's a good game with graphics 
	by me.....

- And a lot of friends (can't type the complete list) for supporting.

- And you, for downloading this game and trying it.... Why not to send a
	mail to me?
