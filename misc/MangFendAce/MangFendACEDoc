You can wreck a golf course, drive on the moon, even park in a handicapped stall, but don't think you're going to get away with it.

   Mangled Fenders is my top view, 6 player demo derby game, where the objective is to destroy all of the other vehicles, by crashing into them.  There are cash awards to all the players, depending on the order in which they are destroyed.  There are different types of vehicles, so you can pick the one that suits you.  

   The Armored Combat Edition lets you stock your arsenal and blast your way to victory in a battle between six of your friends.

         ******* FREEWARE ALERT *******

       I SHOULD BE DECLARED COMPLETELY INSANE!!!

This is the full version of Mangled Fenders: Armored Combat Edition, so here you go, distribute it as widely as you want.

   MANGFEND: ACE is copyright ©1995 by Pete W Storonskij, All Rights Reserved.

MangFend: ACE is fully distributible: a testiment to my high generosity, dedication to my registerers, and Amigans as a whole.

MangFend: ACE cannot be modified in any way, and all of it's
files MUST remain intact and present with the game.

       ******* NEW CHEAPER PRICES *******

   Here it is!  You can get any 2 disks of my armada of games
for $5 for just 1 disk for $3.  These prices effectively negate
previous declarations (since it might be possible to combine them
with this one and wind up with the entire fleet of games for
something less than I can afford :).  This lets you get 4 disks
for $10, instead of the previous 3 as offered earlier.

   These are the FULL VERSIONS, which are only available
directly from me :).

   Let's see:
1 disk costs $3
2 disks cost $5
3 disks cost $8
4 disks cost $10
etc...

Disk #1) Incinerator and New CheckersConquest
Disk #2) Castle Incinerator and New Conundrum
Disk #3) Mangled Fenders (V1.1)
Disk #4) SplatterPaint Version 1.67 (with some of my artwork)
Disk #5) SNOWFORT
Disk #6) Mangled Fenders: Armored Combat Edition
Disk #7) New CheckersConquest and New Conundrum

   I recommend disks 1, 2, 4, and 5 as a set, since you get
FIVE FULL GAMES AND A PAINT PROGRAM for $10, instead of the
standard $20 for a single game of the same calibur.  Remember,
My games are of the same, or higher quality than all other
games!

   Let's see: 
6/10, or 12/20, Value Quotient for my games.
compared to 1/20, Value Quotient for a fictional other game.

A simple calculator yields that you get twelve times the value
out of my fleet than you can possibly get with this example.

   What if you only like half of them?  Well, you still get a
six times value from me, and even more if you decided
beforehand only to get the ones you like!

Splatterpaint is freely distributible in it's full form, so
spread Splatterpaint around :)  ALSO, distribute Mangled Fenders:
Armored Combat Edition and Checkers Conquest!  I have now
attained global fame, thanks to everyone for their support!

   Let's see:
1/0, Value Quotient for Splatterpaint, this is the highest rating
anyone can ever get!  The Rating is so high, it is undefined by
conventional mathematics.  Remember, only my paint program,
and my checkers game, defy the laws of the Universe!

(Version numbers may increase, which is a good thing)

Mangled Fenders V1.1 has memory conservation code, and will
try to fit the game in available memory by substituting car
graphics (This is also a good thing).

       ******* STARTUP OF THE GAME *******

   To start the game, simply click on the game icon.

       ******* FEATURES OF THE GAME *******

   The escape key is used to end the current play, and go back to the main menu.  The space bar will pause and un-pause the game.  The cars take less damage when backing up, so it is a good idea to stay in reverse unless you need to get out of the way quickly.

   The escape key is to break out of play and bring you back to the main control panel.  The space bar will pause and unpause the game, during play.

* 6 Different vehicles, all of which can be played simultaneously.
* 6 Background screens: 
   The Moon        Parking Lot     Dirt Track
   Golf Course    Soccer Field     Intersection

   The game will randomly cycle through the screens, selecting a different one each round.

* 7 PowerUps:
   Indestructibility    Super PowerUp   Cash Award
   Full Repair        Half Repair      Super Performance
   Inflict Double Damage

   The power-ups will appear every once in a while, and when they do, any computer players will start directly for it.  There is a screen in the game that shows the icons for the power-ups, and also explains what they do.

* 6 Different Multilevel Upgrades:
   Temporary Repair:   Tools on the floor
   Top Speed:          Engine
   Acceleration:        Tires
   Damage Absorbtion:   Dump Truck
   Damage Infliction:    Tank
   Permanent Repair:    Lift

   These things are gained (or sold) in the screen to spend your cash on various upgrades designed to keep your car alive, for at least a little while.

* Skid marks are left on the ground, when crashing.
* Cars have 3 stages of graphical portrayal of damage level.
   Missing hood, Smoke, and Fire (then the explosion)
* Cars skid and slide realistically, and explode when destroyed.
* Intelligent computer opponents that seek you out.
   (but the computer players still act stupid sometimes)
* Both joystick ports supported, with 2 keyboard players.
   Keyboard players are for just in case people don't have any  joysticks for the game.
* NTSC & PAL modes supported and uses 64 colors.
* Hard Drive installable.
* Professional style fades between screens.
* USE WEAPONS TO DESTROY OPPONENTS!

   All the above points are to make the cars nice to look at, and actually act like cars, instead of homing missiles :)  Also, they are good points for gloating about (my game does this and that).

* Secret Cheat Mode (HE HE HE HE HA HA HA).

   The Cheat Mode is very well designed.  It gives the player you want any power you want them to have.  It also lets you destroy unwanted cars with a single keystroke :) :D  If you are successful in discovering the cheat mode, then the screen that tells about the different power-ups will also instruct you how to cheat.  The only problem is figuring out what it is.  I have leaked this information to limited places, so it will eventually become known.  I have changed the cheat code, so you will have to be creative to cheat.

        ******* MY SOFTWARE COLLECTION *******

   In the last part of this document, I declared cheaper prices
for my games, so I have removed references to cash for full
versions from the descriptions below.  Remember, the only
source for my armada of full versions is directly from me :)

   CONUNDRUM is my abstract hexagon based puzzle board game,
where the object is to negate all of the colored tiles by placing
them next to each other.  This game was inspired by all of
those hexagonal floor tiles you commonly find on bathroom
floors.  Despite the high level of abstraction, Conundrum is
very simple to play, and Conundrum is highly addictive for any
puzzle gamer.

   The ARMORED COMBAT EDITION of MANGLED FENDERS lets you
stock up on essential ammo and blast your way to victory with
your choice of 6 battle tanks from various countries.  The fire
button releases barrages of powerful munitions against enemy
targets that lie in your path.  This Is True Mangled Fenders
Style!

   Incinerator is a 3D missile attack/defend game, where you defend your city from the enemy's missiles and helicopters, with your laser cannons, forcefields, and super bombs.  Every other round, you get to pulverize the enemy city, with missiles of your own.  It supports NTSC/PAL, is hard drive installable, has high scores, and a secret cheat mode.

   Castle Incinerator is a graphics rewrite of Incinerator, with castles instead of cities, and horses instead of missiles.  The graphics are the only real change, but WOW, they are so awesome.  It was fun rewriting the docs for it.  It looked silly in text, having to defend a castle from flatulent horses, with laser wielding wizards.  It will be available from me only.

   Checkers Conquest is a checkers game with lots of features, and has intelligent computer opponents.  There are lots of options, including changing the board layout, and showing possible threatened positions.  There is no demo version of Checkers Conquest, as the  freely distributible version of it is available almost anywhere,  another testiment to my generosity.

   The New Version of Checkers Conquest has another level of
computer intelligence, a standard numbered game board, and new
options like Fast play and a new rule option. 

   My awesome original has a new swath of power in the new
version of CONUNDRUM.  It has 20 new bonus round puzzles, as
well as several new "Super Tiles".  Super Tiles enclude a Wipe
Tile to destroy the grey matter, and Super Negator Tiles that
drain color from all of the tiles on the board.  The greatest
enhancement yet is the addition of a second "ready" position, so
you can choose between two different tiles to place on the
board.  The 10 second Death Limit remains as ominous as ever. 
You can also play just the bonus rounds, if you like.  There is
even a cheat mode in this spectacular new game!


   Gee, that was a lot of stuff :) most shareware artists only write one or two games in many years, let alone many months.  I have started on another project, but I can't leak any info on it until I am reasonably done with it (no sence spreading vaporware).

          ******* FUTURE GAMES *******

   (STRATOPLEX: DON'T STARE DIRECTLY INTO THE MONITOR)

   I have played around with several possible new games, even a
standard shoot-em-up, and this is what I have come up with:

STRATOPLEX:  This game, when finished, will be without a doubt
The Greatest Game Ever Conceived In The History Of The
Universe.  The release date for this game is yet to be
announced.  This awesome game uses my exclusive "Embrace The
Adrenaline" Play Sequence and Algorithm, as well as the aesthetic
design principles of "Feng Shuey".

   "Embrace The Adrenaline" refers to my new Play Sequence,
which is also an Algorithm and a Set of Protocols.  When used
in conjunction with the reverse polarity version of the Ambiance
Inhibitor, yielding an Ambiance Spectaculomoplex Matrix that
causes a synaptic overload that creates hours of unadulterated
pure adrenaline pumping through your vital organs.  Also, if 
you stare directly into the monitor, a Psionic Wave Cascade will
sweep through your brain and cause your head to explode, oops.

   Unfortunately, withdrawal from this sensory overload
phenomenon could cause motion sickness, halucinations, or total
neural disruption, resulting in a spontaneous bursting of the
human head, and a possible chain reaction of human head
explosions from the insuing Psionic Wave Cascade.

   Of course, to avert this catastrophe, you should delve
directly into oragami, and stick your tongue slightly out of 
one side of your mouth.  The resulting drooling will ground your
psionic reserves, avoiding the side effects.

   You should also keep your cats or other animals away from
the monitor, causing similiar effects.

   YOU SHOULD NEVER, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, split the
output to two monitors, and face them at each other.  This will
cause a rift in the continuum, and the insuing flux will draw
the entire Universe in on itself.  This may cause a chain
reaction and completely incinerate the entire Omniverse, where
our Universe resides as a seemingly insignifant bubble.  Actually,
it is this reaction that powers the Stratoplex in the first
place.  OOPS, this seems to define a paradox, a conundrum that
will destroy the entire Stratoverse, oh darn.

             ******* WRITE TO ME *******
