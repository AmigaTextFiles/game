This program is shareware.  You may freely distribute this program, however
if you use this program and enjoy it, I ask for a donation of $10.  That
is for both this program, and PUZZLE PRO.  I guarantee you it will be
worth it -- your $10 will get you a full, printed manual, and register
you with me, so that I will inform you of future updates to both programs,
and possibly previews of future products I may produce.  When a new
version of the program becomes available, all I request is that you send
me a disk.  So, do yourself a favour!!!  My address is listed at the
end of this file.

USING THE PUZZLE MAKER
***** *** ****** *****

     The PUZZLE PRO program uses graphic files that are IFF (the format
used in Deluxe Paint, and Graphicraft) and that are in lo-resolution,
with 5 bit-planes (32 colors).  If you own any two of the above, you
can draw your own puzzles (save them as normal) and then load them into
the PUZZLE MAKER program.  As well, any pictures you have on slideshow
disks that are lo-res pictures can be used, as shown with the examples
on this disk.

     When the program is run, you will be asked for an IFF ILBM FILESPEC.
Enter the filename at this point, making the disk switch at this time
also.  The program automatically adds "DF0:" in front, so you need not
worry about an incorrect volume.  (Provision for two drive usage will
be supported in version 2 of this program, coming soon.)

    Please be patient while the program loads the pictures.  Pictures
stored in DPAINT take longer to load as they have to be uncompacted.
I would like to thank Carolyn Scheppner of Commodore Business Machines
for the LOADILBM-SAVEACBM routines that I took from the AmigaExtras v1.2
disk.  I just took the bare bones of her program, and of course used my
own file format, but if it weren't for Carolyn's program, this program
might not have been quite as versatile as it is.  Thanks Carolyn!

CHOOSING A PUZZLE
******** * ******

     After your picture is loaded, move the mouse pointer to the approximate
place of the upper left-hand corner of the area you wish to define as a
puzzle.  Remember that puzzles are only 200 X 100 in resolution, instead
of 320 X 200, so you won't fit the entire screen in a puzzle.  Hold the
left button down as you move the box around the screen.  When you finally
have the box located in the proper area, let go of the button.  The
program will say "Please wait...".  Do be patient.  Then you will be
asked for a filename.  At this point, insert the disk you want the puzzle
to be saved on in drive df0:.  Enter the filename, and the rest is
taken care of for you.  When you do an "OPEN" from within the PUZZLE PRO
program, you can enter that filename and play that puzzle.

A LITTLE BIT ON COMMAND FILES
* ****** *** ** ******* *****

     Command files are explained in the Puzzle Pro.DOC file as well,
but here's a quick overview.

     Command files let you have a sequence of puzzles automatically
loaded from the disk, and the difficulty set without user intervention.
To do this, simply use ED or another program that saves files in an
ASCII format.  Enter the puzzle filename like this:

puzzlename,difficulty.level

    The difficulty level must range from 1 to 5 with 1 being the easiest
and 5 being the hardest.  When you have all puzzles in the sequence
typed in like this (a cariage return between of course) you must end
the sequence with:

end

    An example command file might look something like this:

Tut,3
Gorilla,2
Waterfall,5
end

    The "END" must be there (upper or lowercase makes no difference).  If
it is not there, the program will crash out (but not permanently of course)
A disk error will be generated, and you will be warned.  Just a CANCEL
will get you out, but this is a real hassle.

THE END
*** ***

    That's about all there is to it.  If you send me a donation ($10 or
whatever) included in the fuller documentation will be a program break-
down to help you understand what the program is doing, and also the
format used by the puzzle files.  I can not stress how invaluable this
would be, and all for $10.  Also, as a registered user, you will be
informed of future product updates and also new programs that I may be
releasing.  In fact, I have a new program in the works.  So, if any
updates come out for this program, I'll let you know and you can either
send me a blank disk or $4 and I will send you a new version.  Believe
me, it's worth it.

    I also welcome comments and criticisms.  I would like to take this
opportunity also to thank Mr. Adam White for the testing and always
helpful suggestions.  This program has come a long way since it's first
conception.  I would also like to thank Nabob for the coffee, as much
of it was needed!!!

   So, my address is:

    Don't forget to send me your address so I can keep you informed, as
well as mail off your extended documentation.  Thank you!
