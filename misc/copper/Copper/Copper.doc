PLAYING COPPER:

        ***** ----- ***** ----- ***** ----- ***** ----- *****

  ***   The Game:
                Copper is similar to Arkanoid by Discovery.  The
                objective of the game is to destroy all the bricks on
                the screen with the ball.  Some bricks may take only one
                hit to disappear.  Some may take as much as 8.  The green
                brick is the weakest.  It only requires one hit to be
                destroyed.  The red brick is a little stronger.  It requires
                two hits.  The metal brick requires four, and the gold brick
                requires eight.  The special brick, the gold brick with a
                small rectangle inside cannot be destroyed by a regular ball.
                Only the "power" (explain later) ball can destroy that
                special brick.

                To make the game a little more fun, I added some "fun"
                objects to help you complete the level.

  ***   In the Game:
              + Press SPACE BAR to pause.
              + Press ESC to quit the current play.
              + Reject Objects:
                        These purple popping objects are called reject
                        objects.  Every time the ball collides with the
                        reject object, it makes the ball to go faster.
                        There are a maximum of two reject objects.  Try
                        to avoid them if you can.
              + Fun Objects:
                        Objects that sometimes appear and disappear during
                        the game are called Fun Objects.  When one of these
                        objects appear, a LEFT TIMER, which appears on the
                        right side of your screen (There are two TIMERS.
                        The one I'm refering to is the one to the LEFT of
                        the two TIMERS.)  When this LEFT TIMER counts down
                        to zero (in approximately 30 seconds), the fun
                        object will disappear.  When a ball collides
                        with a fun object, the effect depends on the
                        following fun objects:

                                SHAKING BALL:
                                        This increases the ball power.
                                SHAKING SHIP:
                                        1 UP.
                                SHAKING CIRCLE:
                                        It allows you to place the ball
                                        anywhere on your screen.  When the
                                        ball collides with this object, move
                                        the ball with the mouse to a new
                                        location and press the left mouse
                                        button.  The brick under the ball
                                        is destroyed when you press the left
                                        mouse button, and the ball starts
                                        from there.  If you want the ball
                                        to move in a certain direction, move
                                        the mouse in direction that you want
                                        the ball to move, right after you press
                                        the left mouse button.
                                THUNDER BALL:
                                        Gives the ball power to destroy
                                        everything in its path.
                                LAZER WAVE:
                                        Gives your ship a lazer gun.
                                TWO BALLS ROTATING:
                                        You now control two balls.

                        When the ball collides with one of these objects, the
                        object will disappear and the RIGHT TIMER will begin.
                        When the RIGHT TIMER reaches zero (in about 20
                        seconds), your Fun Power is lost.
