I CHING:

   Is an ancient Chinese form of fortune-telling.  Traditionally, the lines
   of a hexagram were determined by counting & dividing yarrow stalks into
   6 groups, the odd or even-ness of each bundle determined whether a line
   was Yin (divided) or Yang (un-divided).  The more modern method is to
   toss three coins 6 times, with the number of heads per toss determining
   whether the line is Yin or Yang.  Heads is assigned a value of 2 & tails
   is assigned a value of 3; therefore, a line will have a value of 6, 7,
   8 or 9.  Lines with the value of 6 or 9 are called moving lines.  The
   next hexagram generated by changing these lines to their opposite type
   gives further information concerning the fortune.
   
GENERAL:

   There are two versions of the I Ching program included in the archive
   file:  IChing (68000 version) & IChing.20 (68020 version).
   Both programs can be run either from WorkBench or the CLI.  All the 
   user of the program has to do is toss 3 coins 6 times & tell the program
   what the results of each toss turns out to be by entering the number of
   heads from each toss (0 through 3).
   Each fortune in the IChing.txt file is somewhat arcane in its termi-
   nology, so I suggest that you buy either:
      "I Ching, Book of Changes" translated by James Legge (Bantam)
      "The I Ching Workbook" by R. L. Wing (Doubleday)
   in order to get more insight into what the symbolic language means.
   
OPERATION:

   The program will first display an instruction summary for the user to
   read.  Click on the window close gadget in order to view the main
   program window.

   From WorkBench, once the program is running, select the New Hexagram
   menu entry & enter the # of heads for the 6 tosses of 3 coins,
   then press the OKAY button on the requester to see your fortune.
   
   From the CLI, either enter the 6 coin tosses as command arguments,
   or wait for the program to prompt you for the 6 numbers in the CLI
   you invoked the program from.
   
   Next Hexagram (A-T) menu entry will change 0 or 3-head line entries to
   the opposite type of line; 1 & 2-head entries do not change.

   New Hexagram (A-N) will bring up a requester for 6 new coin toss
   entries.  Enter the # of heads per toss in numerical order.
   
   The Quit (A-Q) menu item will exit the program.  The window close
   gadget will also exit the program.

WARNINGS:

   If you feel the need to change the fortunes to something more meaning-
   ful to you, be sure that each hexagram fortune entry is only 12 lines
   of text, since the number of text lines is hard-coded into the program.
   Also, do NOT change the text file name, or the program will not work.
   Be sure the text file IChing.txt is placed in the same directory as
   the program.
