PLEASE NOTE:

This game is a reproduction of an old classic, I wrote this for the
BLITZ user competition a while ago.  In total it took me 3 days
to do the initial code.  Since then it has rotted on my Hard Drive
for about 8 or 9 months.

The code was written using Blitz Basic II, most of the code is in
assembler and I was using this as a demo to show how tricks can be
used under blitz to get more objects than usual on the screen while
still running at 50Hz.  The game was written on an A1200 for the
A1200.  I have not tested it for speed on a stock A1200 but it SHOULD
run at full speed.

For those wondering who INSANE SOFTWARE is: well download some of the
other things I have done.

KOMBAT++ - reproduction of the original Atari 2600 game. (AMINET in game/misc)
HAIRPIN 2 - game a friend and myself released under LICENSEWARE
SCREECH ECS DEMO - On the Aminet under game/misc  (V2.41)
SCREECH AGA DEMO - To be released soon.
TEXTURE-ED - A little project I have been working of my own.  Create bitmaps
          out of a set of textures.  Main usage is to quickly set up rou.h gfx
          for initial game design.  Can be used as a sort of art package.

OTHER PLANS - I have plans for a C&C type real time combat game.
            - to finish about 10 of the games I have started writing and
              designing.
            - too busy doing UNI!

thanks
