The game:

The aim of the game is not very complicated:

The liner is on fire, and the people who live inside are so terrified that
 they gimp in the sea full of sharks! Get'em back with your small boat before
 the sharks eat them.

This game is, as you can guess, the adaptation of an old electronic game 
 released in 1983. I worked as hard as I could in order to stay the most 
 faithful to the original game. Although, if you know it and if you saw some
 differencies with my version, please email me.

Control: Ctrl, Alt, Shift Right to move the small boat to the right.
         Ctrl, Alt, Shift Left to move the small boat to the left.
         Spacebar to start again after you lose.
         Escape to quit


Many thanks to nOOr for his translations in english and spanish and for the
 chiptune in the menu.
Thanks to Fred-The-Butcher for lending me his game for nearly two years 
 without asking me money!
At last, thanks to J-Files, Igor, Yocine, Kyvu, Tito (if he still exists), MattZ, 
 Pascal, Fred, Dirk and Ronny for their support.

I'd be very grateful if you write me to tell me what you think about my game,

I'll answer every messages.

See you soon.
