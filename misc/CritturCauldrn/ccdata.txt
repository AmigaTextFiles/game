# birth energy coefficient:  This value is the divisor in the equation:
#
# (parent's energy) / (birth energy coefficient)
#
# This equation dictates how much of the parent's energy is emparted to a
# newborn.
#
# valid values:        1 - ?
# recommended values:  1 - 6

2;

# mutant_coefficient:  This value modifies how often mutations occur.  This
# value is the number of normal births for every mutation (approximately,
# since mutations occur randomly).
#
# valid values:        1 - ?
# recommended values:  5 - 200

10;

# speed_coefficient:  This value is the divisor in the equation:
#
# (speed) / (speed coefficient)
#
# This equation dictates how much it costs each turn, in life energy, to have
# this trait.  The larger the number is, the less it will cost a species to
# mutate into a faster form, making them more efficient at reaching prey.
#
# valid values:        1 - ?
# recommended values:  1 - 6

1;

# age_coefficient:  This value is a modifier to how long-lived all creatures
# are in Crittur Cauldron.  The larger the number, the longer each creature can
# last before dieing of old age.
#
# valid values:        1 - ?
# recommended values:  10 - 50

20;

# birth_range_coefficient:  This value is the divisor in the equation:
#
# (birth range) / (birth range coefficient)
#
# This equation dictates how much it costs each turn, in life energy, to have
# this trait.  The larger the number is, the less it will cost a species to
# send its children far enough away to escape predators. 
#
# valid values:        1 - ?
# recommended values:  1 - 20

# cell_size : this number is the distance in screen pixels between points in the
# world.  As the number gets smaller, the world gets bigger, since the world
# always fills up the display area.  As the number gets smaller than the size
# of the letters (8x8), the letters will begin to overlap, which can cause some
# confusion, but doesn't hurt anything.
#
# valid values:        1 - 150
# recommended values:  6 - 15

# sun : this is the amount of energy given to every plant in the world every
# cycle.  Plants which share the same space, however, share this energy, too.
#
# valid values:        0 - ?
# recommended values:  2 - 7

4;

# birth_coefficient:  This value is the divisor in the equation:
#
# (genotype energy cost) * (birth coefficient)
#
# This equation dictates how much it costs, in life energy, to give birth.
# All creatures must collect this much energy before they can give birth.
# Making this number bigger will make births happen less often, and will keep
# creatures from having as many children before they die.
#
# valid values:        1 - ?
# recommended values:  1 - 20

# These next numbers are the starting statistics for Eve, the single plant which
# begins the world.


# eve's speed : her genotype speed.  Since she is a plant, the most efficient
# speed for her would be 0.  However, giving her a speed greater than 0 will
# insure that sooner than later a herbivore mutation will appear that can move
# (herbivores with a speed of 0 can survive, but only if plants keep throwing
#  their children at it).
#
# valid values:        0 - ?
# recommended values:  0 - 6

# eve's letter : The letter which represents her on the screen.

A;

# eve's energy : the energy she starts with.

# recommended values:  1 - 50

# eve's birth range : the maximum range she can create children at.
