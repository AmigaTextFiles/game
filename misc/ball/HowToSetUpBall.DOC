How to set up ball:

You MUST extract this stuff from its archive with the recursive directory
option, as in

LHARC -x -r e BALL

so that the font goes in a nice directory.

You should copy the file

iff.library      to    your LIBS:      directory
fonts/ball.font  to    your FONTS:     directory
fonts/ball/8     to    your FONTS:ball directory (you should MakeDir this).

You should also make sure that diskfont.library is in your LIBS:
directory.  Diskfont.library is on the original workbench disk.

Iff.library is Public Domain, and is the only file not created by
myself or my brother.

Actually, all files included are public domain.

If BALL can't find the font or diskfont.library, it will use TOPAZ8 (in ROM).
If BALL can't find iff.library, it will not be able to run.

For instructions on playing BALL, read BALL.DOC.
