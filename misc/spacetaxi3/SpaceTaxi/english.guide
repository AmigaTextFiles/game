                  ------------
If  you  are  using WB1.3, you have to copy the
fonts into the FONTS:  Directory.

 1> copy FROM SpaceTaxi2/Fonts/#? TO Fonts: all

Also  the  'diskfont.library'  is  needed in the
LIBS:.   The  game  should  run  on  all Amigas.
There  is  an OptionWindow to switch between PAL
and NTSC.

                     ------
After  a passenger has enterd your taxi, a clock
starts   to  count  down.   When  the  passenger
arrives,  you  get  the  remaining  points or at
least 10 points.  If you complete a level before
the bonus-time has run out, you'll get 10 points
for  every remaining second.  After you made all
levels  of one skillgroup, you'll get 100 points
for every remaining taxi.  Crashes will cost you
points.   At  first  100,  then  50  and then 25
points for each.


                Competition-Mode
                ----------------
In  Competition-Mode  there  is  no  time-bonus,
crashes  will  cost  no points and you won't get
100  points  for every remaining taxi.  The only
aim  is  to  stay alive and get more points than
the  other  players.   If  you  lose a life, the
others will get it.

The game is over if one player lost all taxis or
if  all  levels  of  the  skillgroup  are  done.
Winner  is  who  still  got one taxilife and has
more points than the others.

               Technical Details
               -----------------
Tested  on  A2000  and A1200, should also run on
all  others.   Multitasking is switched off only
temporary  while  on  gamescreen.   The music is
replayed  by  a  routine  from  Teijo Kinnunen's
great MED3.2 and the  great  ptreplay.library by
Mattias Karlsson.

If     you     have     problems    with    your
harddisk-controller,  then  you  should  try  to
start   the   game   by  clicking  on  the  icon
"SpaceTaxi_from_ram".  This script will copy all
data into ram:  and after the program ended will
copy  back  the hiscore and pref-files.  But you
may need 2 MB ram for that.

            Your Own Speech Samples
            -----------------------
If you have an audiosampler, you can sample your
own  set  of  speech-samples.   Put your samples
into  a new directory as IFF-8SVX samples.  This
new directory must be placed in the subdirectory
'speech'.    Then   specify   the  dir  in  the
options-window.   Now  you  should hear your own
samples.    You'll   need   the   following  ten
sample-files:

           1.8svx       6.8svx
           2.8svx       heytaxi.8svx
           3.8svx       pad.8svx
           4.8svx       please.8svx
           5.8svx       thankyou.8svx

@NODE "cust.sounds" "Own Soundsamples"
@TOC "MAIN"

            Your own Sound Samples
            ----------------------

You  can  sample  your  own SFX and save them as
IFF-8SVX or Raw-Sounds to a different directory.
This   new  directory  must  be  placed  in  the
subdirectory  'sounds'.   In  an ASCII-text-file
named  'sound.txt'  (you  may  copy  it from the
original dir and edit it) you specify the period
and  volume  for  each  sample.  Then change the
prefs  'Sound-Samples'  in  the option-window of
the game to this new directory.  Then you should
hear  your  own  sound-creations.   A  sampleset
consists of the following ten files:

        so_tank             so_appear
        so_land             so_gone
        so_openlevel        so_warn
        so_explode          so_thrust
        so_open             so_shake

@TOC "MAIN"

               Own Music-Modules
              -------------------

If  you set the option InGameSfx=Music, then the
program  will  scan  the  modules-dir for MED or
PowerTracker  Modules.  If you want to hear your
own set of modules, then either copy them to the
directory   'music/mods/'   or   make  your  own
subdirectory  in 'music/'.  If you make your own
directory,  then  you  have  to select it in the
option-screen (Option 'In-Game-Music-Modules').

To  include  ProTracker-modules,  make sure that
the  'ptreplay.library'  is  copied to the LIBS:
directory.     (ptreplay.library    by   Mattias
Karlsson  can  be  found in the 'Libs' subdir of
the game.)
