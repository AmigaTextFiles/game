                        INSTALLATION
                        ------------

What BRIKfighter requires:

- any Amiga with at least Kickstart/Workbench 1.2. 
- 512KB Chip Memory & 512KB Fast Memory (1MB Amiga500 Ok!)

BRIKfighter works fine (better?) with any 680x0 ECS or AGA
machines. (tested successfully on A3060-CV64)



                    LAUNCHING BRIKFIGHTER
                    ---------------------

BRIKfighter may be run from either the Workbench or a Shell.
It can of course be installed on Hard disk.



                        DOCUMENTATION 
                        -------------

Ultra simple : just click on the mouse button to start a game.
The rules are the classical Breakout/Arkanoid(R) ones...

Break all the Bricks to pass to  the next level.  Collect the
bonuses to improve your base (classic ones like SPEED, LAZER,
DOUBLEBALL, ELONGATOR, RETRACTOR, EXTRA PLAYER and EXIT,  but
also new ones like the BOMB, TWIN, FREE and WARP bonuses)

Be careful, each 10 levels a BIG monster is waiting for you!



                          GREETINGS
                          ---------

BRIKfighter was the very first I have developped on the Amiga
plateform in 1990 (A500 at that time:sniff!). It was coded in
100% AMOS 1.2 (not PRO!). 

It is still quite fun to play I think, even if the game is far
from  perfect (sounds, gfx...) But the game is quick, playable
and runs in one frame even on basic A500!


I thank the following people for moral support & betatesting:

- Mum (my first and main supporter)
- Marianne & Bakhta (my successive girlfriends 90... & 97!)
- Francois LIONET (AMOS & AMOSpro author)
- Marc LEDOUARAIN (MaVaTi)
- Lionel (Arty) 
- Alex (MrKeel)
- All the MARTIGNAT guys who played with it...
- My Grand'Pa for the voices (RIP:I will love you forever)

                          BUG-REPORT
                          ----------
 
BRIKfighter is freeware. It is quite old (1990) but still up 
to date in terms of playabilty and is 100% complete.
You can use it and spread it as you want. BUT you should not
remove any part of this package especially not the doc file.

Feel free to send me all the money you have if you want to...
I will then be able to buy me the latest CyberPPC stuff! And
code Brikfighter2 PPC CyberGL!

But first of all, please don't hesitate to send me comments
or bug report (detailed please : machine, Ram, Os...).
