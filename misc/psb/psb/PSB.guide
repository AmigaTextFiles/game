@{B}Power Signal Box@{UB} is a simulation of British Rail
Power Boxes such as @{" Coventry " LINK "Coventry"} PSB. These boxes operate with
push button route setting, and track diagrams with
four digit train describers and illuminated route indication.

Although this simulation is based on Coventry PSB, it has been
designed in such a way as to allow conversion to any station layout with up
to seven exit routes and other local stations in the main station area.
This is an initial beta test version to see if there is any interest
in further development.
There are several shortcomings in the program and many new features I would like to add
in the future.
Please note this program needs Workbench 3.0+ and is PAL only.
If you don't have the Hires-5a font in your main Fonts: drawer copy them from the fonts drawer included.
Otherwise just drag or copy the PSB drawer any where on your hard drive.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "Usage" "Using PSB"
@TOC "MAIN"

Double click the PSB icon and a requester will appear. Select the station drawer
that you wish to load. In this beta-release only @{" Coventry " LINK "Coventry"} is available with a short
shift working from 0520 to 1000. Other stations and longer shifts are planned.

After the station is loaded you will see the main PSB screen.

The following buttons are available:

  Info: opens the Info window with full details of each train

  Text: Toggles text display None/Signals/Track Circuits

  Clock:  Cycles clock speed Pause/x1 to x50

You will also see the clock showing the current simulation time.

On the screen there are station platforms in grey and the entry/exit points
labelled "To Rugby" for example.

On either side of the plan there are lists of trains. These are the next four trains due
from each direction. Although there maybe four or more exits, trains are designated Up or Down and
are displayed in the list according to the direction they shall approach the main station.
The data for each train is in this format:

  1 5K05 0520 ex 0523 Bha-Nun

  1     =   Train number
  5K05  =   Train reporting number
  0520  =   Time train should arrive on the screen
  ex 0523 = Time train is expected to arrive on the screen
            After the train has appeared on screen "ar" and the arrival time on screen will be displayed
            When a train stops at a station "dp" will be displayed and the time shown will be the station departure time
  Bha-Nun = The Entry and Exit direction for the train
            ie The train will arrive from the "To Bham" direction and should be routed to the "To Nuneaton" direction.

The following colour code is used:

White   : train not yet arrived
Blue    : train approaching
Green   : train on panel
Red     : train stopped at signal on panel
Grey    : train stopped at station on panel

You will see the track diagram with each track circuit length shown in green
and each signal protecting these sections showing red. Below each signal is a small
button with an arrow indicating which direction the signal can send trains.

If a train is waiting to enter the screen area the entry signal will be blue, but it is best
to predict the approach of trains before they reach this signal, and set the route early
to avoid delaying the train.

Set a route to clear a signal as follows:
First click on the arrow button signal from where the train is coming, or as far as the train is already signalled.
and the signal circle should change to white. If not click on the arrow button again.
Then click on the signal arrow button at the end of the section where you want the train to go.
The two signal arrow buttons should both point in the same direction. The signal at the start of the section will
clear to green if the route is clear, and there are no trains or other routes conficting with the route.
The track circuit will change to yellow. When the train enters the section the signal reverts to red,
and the track circuit changes to red.

To send a train off the screen in the correct direction, double click the signal arrow button, which is pointing off
the screen.

To cancel a route, hold Shift and double click the entry signal arrow button.
Note that cancelling routes should only be done in an emergency, and never in front of a moving train.

Click on any train and the Info window will be displayed at the correct train entry.

Info Window


The info window allows you to get full details of any train and also
to edit, temporarily or permanently, the details for any train.

Click on any train and the Info window will be displayed at the correct train entry,
or click on the Info button on the main PSB screen.

To find any train once the Info window is open, find the train in the window menu,
or type the number in the box at top right, or use the arrows next to this box
to step through each train one at a time.

Code: Shows the train reporting number which may be changed
Type: The type of train, and it's maximum speed
Time: The time the train started from...
From: The origin of this train
To  : The destination of this train
Dir'n: The direction the train will travel when it first arrives on screen.
       alongside this button is first the direction from which the train will approach
       and the exit direction where the train needs to be routed.

App sig: The signal the train will arrive at, linked to the arriving direction above.
Due : The time the train is due to appear on screen, followed by the time expected,
      or the current position and speed if on screen.

Use : If you make any changes click Use to make the changes take effect in this session.

Save: Saves any changes permanently to disk.
      This should only be used when you are ready to quit the simulation
      as any permanent alterations will require the train order to be sorted again.

At the bottom of the window are the trains stops.
The Add button adds a new stop.
At each stop the new Code, due time, and direction is shown.

Train reporting Numbers

These are four digit codes like 5K05

The first number indicates the type of train

0   Locomotive
1   Express passenger train
2   Stopping passenger train
3   Parcels train
4   Fast freight train
5   Empty passenger train
6-8 Slow freight train
9   Eurostar train

The letter indicates the destination area and the last two numbers are the trains id number.

Support for developing your own layouts will follow if there is sufficient interest in the future.

@NODE "Coventry" "Coventry"
@TOC "MAIN"


Included with this beta-release is the data for a short shift from 0520 to 0959
at Coventry. The main flow of trains is along the main Eustom to Birmingham line
but there are several trains using the branches to Nuneaton and Leamington Spa.
I have also added trains that would normally use the Trent Valley route direct from
Rugby to Stafford to add interest, as this is a regular diversionary route when that line is blocked.
Trains which stop at Coventry for London Euston usually use the top platform, platform 1,
as this is where the station entrance is situated. Diverted trains, and all those which run non-stop through the station
should use platforms 2 and 3 as these are the fast straight through lines.
Northbound trains normally use Platform 3. Trains to the Leamington line should use Platform 2
and cannot use platform 1. Trains from Birmingham New Street or Wolverhampton which terminate and
return should use platform 4. There are two high speed junctions from the Birmingham direction,
50 mph into platforms 1 and 4.
When traffic builds up, you may prefer to replatform trains to help keep things moving.
