Up to 2.3p8+:
	Continuous mouse works, on servers that allow it.  The delay
	setting on page 1 of options does nothing, use the one on page
	5(Amiga Features) to time it by vblanks. (rc option
	"amigaClickDelay") 

	Nifty Auto-save defaults, plus keys can be assigned for ANY
	integer or boolean default that can be changed while playing.
	click "Save Defaults" in the Options menu, and read the
	comments it outputs in .paradisesaverc for more details on
	assigning keys.  Also read that file for the names of almost
	every default there is, plus legal values.  A few sample keys
	are in ".keymap" as well.

	color bitmap code is "complete" ie - will use bitmaps for all
        combinations of planet facilities.  Also, torps, torp dets,
        explosions, sb explosions(except I haven't draw any yet! code
        is in there.), and of course all ships.  Option "monobitmaps",
	which can be toggled while playing, lets you switch between
	normal or color bitmaps.  Ship bitmaps should be loading
	faster, due to improved checking for empty bitmaps - It now
	checks only the topmost square, and skips the whole column if
	it's empty.  Means you'd better not make just one view for a
	ship that's supposed to have the full 16 ;-)

	There is an option in the 'O' window "Reload ship bitmaps" ...
	USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  I think I screwed it up.  it does sort
        of work. 

	enemyPhasers: 0-10,  draw enemy phasers as two lines, this
	specifies how far apart, or 0 to do it the old way.
	
	continuous iff save for playback is out, sorry.  If anyone
	wants it back, let me know.  F3 still saves one frame.

	Better window layout - this is just a matter of different rc
	settings,  not a code change.

	Bugs fixed? Probably.  New bugs? Probably.

Up to 2.3p5+:

Unix side DNet server has changed to allow MetaServer support without
	sintlink.  Please replace the old DNetrek.unix with the new one.

Full color graphics!  iff pics/brushes are used, check out the
	graphics directory.  Paths can be changed with .xtrekrc
	options.

Local and Map windows can be scaled differently!
	This is legal and works now:

	local.geometry: 450x450+0+0
	map.geometry: 400x400+450+0

	How useful this is I'm not sure.

The keyboard is now mapped properly, that is ctrl works for any key,
	and alt+key performs key's DEFAULT action instead of what it's
	been remapped to.  shift, ctrl, and alt also now work for
	mouse buttons, just like the X version.

F-keys do things.  No more ctrl-keys that get stolen by the amiga
   	code.  Also, the help key brings up a brief Amiga-specific
	help window.

AutoPoint was rearranged internally, I'm not sure there was any
	noticeable effect on how it works..

New options for speech, speakGod, ignoreMultiple, a couple more.  Look
	in the 'O'ptions menu, Amiga page.

Sound menu(ctrl-s) has been improved. (or if it wasn't in the last
	version, added ;)

A Flight recorder!  see options in .xtrekrc, and -F command line
	switch for playback.  This is what justifies the 16 color
	bitmaps for ECS machines.  Some very pretty screenshots can
	result 8)

F3 key saves a snapshot of the window you press it in.  Especially
	useful with playback.  Saves are numbered from 0, movies
	anyone?  option "snapshot.size: XxY"  says how much of the 
	SCREEN to save with each snapshot.

Lots more stuff I've forgotten to mention, or is minor enough that
	.xtrekrc should suffice.  

BIGGEST CHANGE OF ALL
---------------------
  The thing's stable.  I mean it!  Hope this holds true for others...

  This particular version is a little sloppy, but should be "safe".
If you have tried previous versions, you probably know what I mean.
Occasioanlly you may have to kill it by hand.  Even then about 90% of
the time it will exit cleanly.  The other 10% it will be stuck in a
WaitIO call that's in the DNet library.  Sometimes, quitting DNet will
break the client out of this, not always.  (the quitdnet program... no
need to close the window.)

  Tech info on why it crashed on exit so often last version:  There
are two functions named DeletePort() and DeleteMsgPort() in the OS.
They are similar but not identical.  Always make sure you're using the
right one...  I had the wrong one in one place in the sound code
cleanup, that was it.

Other possible change:

my address? maybe.  Will probably move soon, but jrumsey@cs.ucr.edu is
fine for the moment.  If it ever bounces, post to r.g.netrek or
c.s.a.programmers and I will probably see it.


NEW VERSION OF DNET?  MAYBE!  Eric's trying his best.  As I write
this, we were both talking about putting them up last night ;)  So
hopefully DNet 2.45 is on ocf.berkeley.edu, pub/amiga RIGHT NOW!
If so, it should contain an option to turn off DNet's error correction
and rely on the modem.  This is GREAT for Netrek.  Try it!  You will
sometimes have problems with other DNet clients when using this
option.  You've been warned.  I realize this sort of goes against the
purpose of DNet, but if you're up/downloading and this option is in
effect,  try not to do anything else ;)  Actually, downloads are
usually fine, I've had problems with uploads often. :(


Before 2.3p5+:

I didn't keep a change log!
