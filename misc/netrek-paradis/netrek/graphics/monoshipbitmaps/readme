  Put normal paradise ship bitmap albums here if you like, and make
sure you have an rc entry:

shipbitmappath: netrek:graphics/monoshipbitmaps

  Feel free to modify the color bitmaps in colorbits8 (or if you can
use 16 colors, or more? use the ones in colorshipbitmaps)  All color
files are just IFF ILBM's, use any paint program you like and go crazy :-)
