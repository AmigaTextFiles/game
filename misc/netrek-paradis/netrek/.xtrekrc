# original Amiga Netrek port: Randell Jesup (jesup@scala.scala.com ???)
# original DNetrek author: mehlhaff@ocf.berkeley.edu

# Converted "back" to AmiTCP August '95 (long after my Amiga was
# supposedly retired ;-)
#
# I suspect many of the comments are misleading, meaningless, or just
# plain wrong, but for the most part this is the best Amiga specific
# documentation there is :-/

#If you know the exact mode id, use this!  Otherwise, you can use the
#older screen.mode: entry described below
#screen.modeid: <MODE_ID>  # must be in hex, and must have '0x' at the front.
screen.modeid: 0x29004

#screen.mode:	vga hires lace
# screen.mode should follow one of these formats: 
#    (pal|ntsc) (hires|super|lores) (lace|nolace)
#    (vga)      (hires|productivity|lores) (lace|nolace)
#    (a2024)    (10hz|15hz)
#
# A2024 support is left over from the original release, and
# I may have screwed something up.  If you have one, let me 
# know if it works!
#
# the default screen is pal hires lace, which seems to be the best.
# also nice is "vga productivity lace" which if you reposition
# your windows will let you have full size map and tactical windows
# on screen at once (put one right below the other)
# all modes use the standard overscan setting from preferences.
#
# The defaults:
screen.mode: pal hires lace
#screen.geometry: 1300x800

# Here I start messing around with window placement.
# For *all* of the windows listed, you can specify if you want them mapped,
#   their geometry, and their parent.
# When specifying geometry for text (and scrolling) windows, specify
#   in terms of characters wide and high.  Specify size of a menu only
#   at your own risk (there is no real benefit to doing this).
# You can now also set the following to on or off:
#   border	|Turn off to replace intuition border with a custom one,
#               | with the right color.
#   title	|These 4 default to on.
#   depth	|
#   drag	|
#   nogadgets -- turns all of the above off.
#   backdrop -- the window is always behind other windows.
#   sizing -- only allowed for scrolling(message) windows defaults to off.
#   refresh -- makes the window a smart refresh, also only for scrolling windows.
#              don't use smart refresh if you are low on memory!
#   workbench -- put this window on the workbench!
# 
# I've made a second file, .xtrekwindowsrc which holds window defs, and
# which can be written from the game by typing ctrl-a then 'X'.  If that
# file is #include'd from this one, you will be able to change your
# setup and have it remembered the next time you play.
#
# The next line will make ALL windows open on the workbench.  Colors
# probably won't look very good, but you can fiddle with the settings
# in this file and workbench preferences and get it right if you decide
# you actually like playing that way.  It should also help if you have
# memory problems.

# Get "config mode" by pressing ctrl-a (for amiga :)
# at any time.  while in this mode, the following keys toggle window attributes:
# a - bAckdrop window
# d - Drag bar
# t - Title bar (NOT the same as drag bar!)
# g - depth Gadget
# b - Border
# s - Size gadget (message windows ONLY)
# r - smart Refresh (faster refresh, but eats memory)
# w - use Workbench for this window.
#
# X - save new config and eXit config mode.
#
# any other key exits config mode AND passes that key along as if
# you were not in config mode.

# note: one of the autopoint settings is HIGHLY recommended for config mode,
