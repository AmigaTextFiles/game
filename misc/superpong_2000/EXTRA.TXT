I'm currently 23+(1/2) years old.  But I have been looking for the TRUTH (the
religious type) for several years now.  To make a long story short, let's just say
that I got really burned by this search.  I can say, quite confidently, that 
computer programmers, scientists, etc. have a much better understanding of the
universe than all those pharisees from any kind of religion put together.
( Why was Galileo excommunicated by the Roman Catholic Church ??? )

The text on my main web page is chapter 90 from a book called "This is my word,
Alfa and Omega.  The gospel of Jesus.  The Christ revelation which the world does
not know."  I consider this to be highest sprirtual knowledge source from all of
the other stuff I have read before.  It's not how much you read but what you read.
And even more imporantly what you discover by yourself.  If you wish, take this
advice.  Don't consider what you read from some highly praised texts to be the
ABSOLUTE TRUTH.  Who knows.  Those who wrote them might have been fools.  The
texts themselves might have been changed by even bigger fools and they might have
been and may still be praised by even bigger fools.  So be careful, OK.  It may
save you a lot of frustration.  People who get into religious arguments and try to
convince their opponent that their religion is the one true religion, do that because
they have too much pride and even more strangely so, because they themselves are not
sure that they're following the "true religion".  If you get into one of those 
"dog fights" just say to your opponent:  "Are you sure of that as you are sure that
1+1=2"?  Also add that "Belief" implies "unsureness".  You understand completely
that 1+1=2.  Understanding is much better than "believing".  "Believing" is actually
quite useless, does it really help in anything.... hmmmm....  OK enough talk.
