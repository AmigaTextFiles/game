The game:

The aim of the game is not very difficult:

Your friend gorilla has been caught by a guy called Mario. Let's get the
 keys in order to remove the four chains and to deliver him. Be careful
 with the crocodiles, the electric shocks, and the birds who attacks you.

This game is, as you can guess, the adaptation of an old electronic game
 released in 1983. I worked as hard as I could in order to stay the most
 faithful to the original game. Although, if you know it and if you see some
 differencies with my version, please email me.

Control: Directionnal arrows to move
         Shift to jump

         Shift to start again when you lost
         Esc to quit

You can also use a joystick.
