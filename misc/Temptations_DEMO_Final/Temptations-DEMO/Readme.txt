Temptations is a video game developed by Luis López Navarro and published by Topo Soft
in 1988 exclusively for MSX.

Unfortunately, it was never ported to the Commodore Amiga, the legendary computer that
reigned in the 16-bit market. After so many years, the time has come for Commodore Amiga
users to enjoy what, by many, is considered one of the best video games made on MSX in
the history of Spanish software.

The instructions for the original game read as follows:
"The first MSX program that takes full advantage of the graphical capabilities of this
sensational machine. TEMPTATIONS, the most original sin since Adam and Eve.
YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO PLAY IT."

I made the game with RedPill, based on the graphic set of nenefranz's Android version
(improving and adding some new ones), and adding new animations. Some sounds are also
taken from that version. The music is completely original on CD-Audio tracks (CD32). It
also has an extra level, exclusive for the Amiga version.

I have made it based on the "feel" of the MSX version, which is the one I know best,
implementing the movements and timing of the enemies as accurately as possible, so that
the sensation/game experience is as close as possible to that version.

This version is exclusively in Spanish, and the DEMO download will only be available in
WHDLoad for levels 1 and 5 for 60 seconds each.”

The full digital version will cost€5 euros (sorry, I'm TIRED of people who take
advantage of them to make money on YouTube at the expense of free games: my effort, time,
money and desire to finish this project must also be be valued), and will be composed of:

	- ISO with .cue + .bin format for Amiga CD32. Completely configured and ready to
	  burn to a CD and start the game on the console. It will be digitally registered
	  with your name or alias.

	- Rest of full versions (WHDLoad and ADF). All configured to work directly from
	  the same CD. They will be digitally registered with your name or alias.

	- The CD32 emulator is included so that any Amiga AGA with FastMem can run it
	  (CD/DVD drive required), and thus be able to enjoy the game with all its audio
	  tracks.

	- Icons in AmigaOS 4.x format (it is necessary to install PeterK's icon.library
	  on the system for correct viewing)

The physical edition (ONLY FOR SPAIN) will cost €15 (it will be a very small print run of
about 10 copies), which will be sent by regular mail, and will be composed of:

	- Case with cover and back in professional quality (coated paper)
	- Instruction booklet in professional quality (coated paper)
	- Self-adhesive label for 3.5" floppy disk (photo quality)
	- Self-adhesive label on CD (photo quality)
	- Full color A4 game poster in professional quality (coated paper)
	- ONLY FOR ABU SIMBEL OWNERS: full color poster of the game Abu Simbel Profanation
	  The Full Adventure in A4 in professional quality (coated paper)

All of this can be seen in more detail in my blog below.
	  
New advances with new optimizations:

- 64 colors with AGA features (24 bit color depth, AGA fetch mode, etc.)
- 020/14MHz
- CD32 audio-tracks (CD32 full version only)
- up to 6 levels of parallax scrolling
- optimizations in speed and performance under 020/14 MHz (Zener implementations)				

About the tech:
---------------

All audio samples have been treated with the Amiga software SoundBox and AudioMaster IV.

All graphics have been treated with the Amiga software Personal Paint and Deluxe Paint V.

All game construction has been done with Amiga RedPill software by S0Y.
