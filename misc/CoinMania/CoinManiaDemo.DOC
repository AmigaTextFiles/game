                         -------------------

        The AIM of the game, is to  collect all of the coins, avoiding
the hazards that block your path,  whilst  you race against the clock.
When you move off the tile  you  are  presently  on, it will crack and
disappear, so that you will not be able to go back on yourself.

        You should head  for  the  [X]-Tile  (Four  arrows  that point
inwards, they will animate when all of the coins have been collected),
so that you can land on this Tile to complete the Level.

        There are further instructions on the  HELP page, which can be
accessed from the main  menu.   Use  the  flashing  box  to select the
desired part, by moving the joystick  left  or right and then pressing
fire.  Alternatively you can use the mouse to select from the menu.

        To PAUSE the  game,  press  [P]  or  the  fire  button on your
joystick and to resume play press either [P] again or the fire button.
Pressing [Esc] whilst in Pause Mode will Quit the Game.

	Either the Mouse or Joystick can be used to skip intermediate
screens, but the game can only be played, using a joystick.
