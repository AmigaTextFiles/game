                          -- Information ---

   I wrote this program as a  response  to the PC program '101 Fruits'
where one basic engine ran 101  different fruit machines. I decided to
write my own. This one allows you to customise:

* The main screen graphics
* The reel graphics (including their ordering)
* The winning lines
* The win amounts
* The sounds
* The skill text
* The starting bank
* Cost of each play

   I have included four variations to  show you the basics (along with
the template files). If you create a new slot machine, then send it to
me (or upload to the Aminet) so we can top the PC's 101 slots!


                          --- Operation ---

   On program startup, 'Sovereign  Slots'  looks  for  all the '.game'
files in the current directory. It then  displays each name in its own
button. Click on this button to play that game.

   When the slot machine has  loaded,  the  'Start' button will flash.
This allows you to:

1) Spin the reels (by  clicking  on  the  button, or pressing space or
return)
2) Get help on which  reel  combinations  score the most points. Press
the 'Help', or 'H', key for this feature.
3) Exit the machine (pressing Escape, or tilde ')

   There are two totals at the top of  the screen. The one on the left
is the current bank  total,  the  one  on  the  right  is your current
wealth.

   Once the reels have started to  spin  you can bring them quickly to
halt by pressing:

1) The space key
2) Both mouse buttons

   If you've won, the bank will show  the  amount won, and then add it
to your account.  Most  features  are  self  explanatory (the 'holds'
flash when you hold, the 'nudge' buttons light up when you may nudge -
check the nudge direction first). If  you  get a skill shot (sometimes
occurs after a win), you should press 'space' when the light is on the
rightmost letter in the title, at  the  top of the screen. Each letter
lit increases your win. The left hand indicator shows this.


                    --- Creating you own games ---

In the 'Template' directory  is  a  sample  game.  It comprises of the
following files:

template.game   ASCII description of the game itself
template.gfx    The reels, buttons and skill shot title
template.slot   The main, backdrop image
template.snd    An AMOS sample bank for the sounds. This is optional.
                Sovereign slots will load 'Standard.snd' if this can
                not be found.

   Now, if the files are not obvious, a short explanation of:

template.game
   This text file consists of three types of line:

1) Comments. Denoted with ';'
2) Headings. Shown with '#'
3) Data. Alpha-numeric characters in the lines following the '#'

   If you are unsure of what any  entry is, leave it out. The software
will supply defaults to make your job easier.

   The valid headings (and their associated data) is:

#line   Describes what is on each reel, in order. The first line after
        the heading describes the first (left-most) reel, and so on.
        The letters 'a'-'g' must be used.

#win    A description of each winning line, using the same notation in
        the '#line' heading with a '-' used as a wildcard.

#credits The initial sum in the players bank

#cost   The number of credits deducted each turn.

#rpos   Position of the reel overlay. DO NOT CHANGE THIS DATA.

#skill  Describes the location of the skill shot images. The first two
        are the Y and X (in that order!) of the top left of the image.
        The others are X positions of the start of each letter in the
        word. You *MUST* also include the X position of the *end* of
        the last letter. This is usually 319.

#nudge  Holds the X,Y co-ordinates of each 'nudge number'. Each line
        is stored 'x,y', without spaces. The default positions are:
        5,170   25,147  5,124   25,101  5,78    25,55

#coords The co-ordinates of the totals. In order, each line details:
        X co-ord of the players' total
        Y co-ord of the players' total
        1 if the X co-ord represents the left edge of the numbers
        Number of padding characters. 3 means that a minimum of
                three digits are shown.
        X co-ord of the win bank
        Y co-ord of the win bank
        1 if the X co-ord represents the left edge of the numbers
        Number of padding characters. 3 means that a minimum of
                three digits are shown.

#test   Used only when testing the machine. This gives the player the
        ability to get all the features occurring on successive plays.
        It lets you see which graphics are mis-aligned.


template.gfx
   Each image in the reel is 40x25.
   Each number (top-right) is 25x25.
   Each button is 40x25.
   The skill shot title is 160x30.
   Must be the same palette as 'template.slot'


template.slot
   The area for the reels *MUST* be  colour  zero. If you reels do not
appear - this is most probably  the  reason.  This is done so that any
non-zero pixels will  be  overlayed  once  the  reels  are drawn. This
permits 'Win Line', and other text to be overwritten.

   The palette must have a light colour  as index 2 (pref. white), and
a dark colour as index 1 (pref.  black). Most art packages will assist
you to remap to this  spec.  if  necessary.  This allows the player to
read the numbers at the top of the screen.


template.snd
   Each sample must be in its  proper  place  or the slot machine will
sound very wierd. The samples order is:

 1 - Waiting for start
 2 - Reel #1, nudge/hold sound
 3 - Reel #2, nudge/hold sound
 4 - Reel #3, nudge/hold sound
 5 - Reel #4, nudge/hold sound
 6 - Reels spinning. This will be looped internally.
 7 - 'Clunk', for when a reel stops spinning
 8 - Skill shot background sound. This will be looped internally.
 9 - Skill shot, key pressed sound
10 - Skill shot win! Rising sound on replay
11 - Skill shot win! Sinking sound on replay
12 - Beep when a nudge is added. Also used when added scores to bank.
13 - Skill shot, failure noise.

                          --- Afterword ---

This is a very short program. There's a lot I would like to do:

Control logic embedded inside the file.
Use transparency to make the 'nudge numbers' easier to create.
Independent positioning of the reels, and testing everything with
bullet-proof data.
Add another 97 slot machines! A big job...but with *your* help....


                          --- Dedication ---

To Grandma. Who died on the  day  I  finished the code, and was buried
the day after I finished the graphics.



                         -- The Final Word --

This program is shareware, you can  use  it for 30 years (yes, years!)
before paying for it. If,  however,  you  want the source (in AWE-AMOS
and ASCII) then send me £5, and  I'll  return  you a disc with all the
source and the latest version of Sovereign Slots.

Hi Mr. Steven Goodwin,

   I would like to register my copy of Sovereign Slots because

a) I have been using it for the shareware limit of 30 years!
b) I want to know how you auto-configure for the '.game' files!
c) I'd like to see how the reel movements are so damn cool!
d) I want to add my own logic to make it win more often!
e) I have a tremendous guilt complex!
f) All of the above                         (circle as appropriate)

   I enclose a cheque/postal order for £5 (which includes P&P) because
I'm a kind hearted  soul  who  cares  about  the  people  you make my
software.

   Thanks very much,


      Name ________________ (not completely necessary, but ties up the
                             letter nicely)
