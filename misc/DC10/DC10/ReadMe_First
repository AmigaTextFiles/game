DC-10 README_FIRST_FILE (V 0.1f)


1) Status of the program (9 april 1988)

The original DC-10 program was developed by me on a Tandy/RadioShack TRS 80
computer a few years ago.
Referring to an often heard remark: 'quick and dirty programming' I can say
that this conversion of DC-10 from the TRS 80 to the Amiga was not at all
quick and indeed is very dirty.
The main objective of this first Amiga release however is 'just to be in the
air'. The program is not at all optimized with respect to the possibilities
of the Amiga.

The current packet exists of :
  1) This ReadMe_First file (1 k)
  2) The documetation file DC10.doc (70 k)
  3) The main program DC10.bas with the flightplanning part (8 k)
  4) The real simulation program DC10EUR.bas (25 k)
  5) A special version of the simulation program DC10MIA.bas (22 k),
     added to practice 'blind' landings
  6) The file KBD.bas to show how the keyboard.device is used to read
     the status of all keys of the keyboard with 1 command (2 k)

2) Start-up

 - Take a copy of the Workbench V1.2 disk
 - Relabel it to DC10
 - Delete system files like printer.devices, fonts etc to get at least
   250 k free on the DC10 disk
 - Copy Amigabasic V1.2 to the main directory of DC10
 - Copy exec.bmap from Extras_1.2:basicdemos to DC10:Libs
 - Copy all files mentioned in point 1 above to the main directory of DC10
 - Change the Startup-sequence to load Amigabasic at start-up
 - Load and run DC10.bas
 - See the DC10.doc file to 'Take-off and fly'
