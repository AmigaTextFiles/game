All necessary files are included to run the program straight from a floppy
just copy all the RaceInfo directory to an empty floppy and boot.

To install Race Info to hard drive just copy across the main program to your
chosen destination.

Instructions for the program are to be found within the main program.

Note from the author :

This is a couple of years old now. As I've now access to the internet I
thought I should upload it. This version should now work on AGA machines
properly. Any comments please email me :
