      like an advanced version of the classic Atari game Surround. While

      avoiding walls, each worm can shoot a cannon that will destroy a single

      block on the playing field, or kill the opposing worm.&nbsp; There are ten

      starting playfields, a single player and two player mode, and hostile

      environment games with a total of 80 game variations in all! </p>

        </i>New <a href="downloads/warwormb2.bin">download</a> available.&nbsp;

        Tested on Stella, SuperCharger. (Z26 behaves a little strange).<i><br>

        </i>The AI for one-player mode is now mostly complete.&nbsp; Select up

        to games 10-19 for one-player mode.

        <p>Also, the folks on the <a href="http://www.biglist.com/lists/stella/">Stella

        Mailing List</a> were kind enough to point out to me that the game play

        found in <a href="http://www.atariage.com/software_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=537">Surround</a>

        is pretty similar to my game.&nbsp; Fortunately for me they didn't give

        me a hard time about it ;&gt;.&nbsp; I had a sneaking suspicion that there was

        bound to be a game out there similar to this, I just didn't expect it to

        be one of the first 9 that Atari released...&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p>At any rate, I had never even looked at the game before I put out the

        first beta release, so I don't feel too bad about it.&nbsp; Perhaps my

        game should be alternately titled &quot;Surround II&quot; or

        something.&nbsp; I do think that the additions to the game play

        (including the cannon, my different one-player AI, and selectable

        starting fields) give it enough to stand on its own.</p>

        <p>Still to do:</p>

        <ul>

          <li>Better Sound</li>

          <li>Speed Variation</li>

          <li>A wrap around version of the game (similar to the &quot;Video

            Graffiti&quot; games in Surround)</li>

          <li>Hostile Environment Game (space permitting)</li>

          <li>Third Computer-Controlled Character (space permitting)</li>
