GNU Robbo
-------------

This is very nice game oryginally written for Atari XL/XE by "LK Avalon".

+---------+
| History |
+---------+
First version of Robbo was created in 1989, and in short time
has become very popular in "little" Atari's world. Main author -
Janusz Pelc has made very good job. His next product - Robbo Kontruktor
allowed people to create their own levels.
I just ported it to Linux trying to set Robbo's behaviur as 
similar as it is possible. You can still buy Windows version of Robbo
in "LK Avalon", with better graphics and new objects and levels so
this piece of code cannot work at Windows.

+--------------+
| Requirements |
+--------------+
For compiling you need to have SDL-devel and SDL_ttf library 
installed at your machine. All these libraries can be downloaded
from http://www.libsdl.org


+--------------+
| Installation |
+--------------+

Just simply type:
'configure'
'make'
'make install'

If it didn't work or any file has been missing - type:
"autoheader"
"autoconf"
"automake"

and then make normal instalation procedure

+------+
| Keys |
+------+
Use cursors for moving and SHIFT for SHOOTING
ESC causes robbo killing

+-------------+
| Level files |
+-------------+
You can create own level files - more details can be found in levels.dat.
Don't hesitate to send complete working levels to the author. If it's
sensible, be sure that it will be attached to official game :-)
As for now there're only little number of levels.

In the future I plan to release interface for graphical creating levels.
