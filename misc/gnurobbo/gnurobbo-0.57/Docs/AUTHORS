Graphics and original ATARI XL/XE game: Janusz Pelc

Reimplementation: Arkadiusz Lipiec <alipiec@elka.pw.edu.pl>, 2002

The game was oryginally created in 1989 by Janusz Pelc from "LK. Avalon"
and was working on ATARI XE/XL. I missed this game so much so I decided
to start own project which would be reimplementation of the game. It
was not so easy because all I had was only working game. I had no code
or algorithms.

Another reason was that I'd like to write a program based on SDL library.
This is my first project that uses SDL.
