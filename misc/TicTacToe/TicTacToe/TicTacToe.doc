This is a simple game of TicTacToe, written for fun and nothing else.
It's best run from the CLI, as you get more info there than from Workbench.

You always play Xs. To place an X, click in the appropriate square.
When the game is over, click to start another game. The right mouse button
at any time exits the game.

For those of you who have seen War Games, you can have the computer play
itself. To do this, run it from the CLI with the -0 flag (ie TicTacToe -0).

If run from the CLI, the number of X wins, O wins and draws are displayed
when the game is exited.

Have fun!
