SANTA MONTANA

This is a beta version of a contribution made for the
"First Annual Festive Amiga Game Making Competition"
on Amiga.org, by the demo group Depth.

Everything was done in a couple of days, so there are
many (even known) bugs.  A final version will be
released early 2010.

Code: skurk
Graphics: sprocket
