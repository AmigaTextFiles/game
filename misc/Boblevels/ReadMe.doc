                Hello there, nice people!


Here are my ten levels for the brilliant game "Bob - The Amazing Lemon", by the
nice gentleman Ian Ward.
  The levels are freely distributable, as long as they are not changed.
  And BTW, "Zwok Zwok Zwok" is just some fancy name I invented long ago when I
had to make a completely meaningless pseudo-name. And it kind of stuck.

The levels are:

    ICYMAZE     MADNESS     MINIMALISTIC    MOREICE     PILLMAZE
    RUN4IT      SPIRALRUN   SUPERLEVEL      SURPRISE    YOURCHOICE

Have Fun!

P.S. "Bob - The Amazing Lemon" has got brilliant music! Who actually originally
wrote those tunes?
P.P.S. Why can't Ian Ward do anything about those stupid 8-colour graphics?
They don't do the 32-colour ECS Amiga justice, let alone the 256-colour AGA
Amiga.
