                               -----------

Release Date:  6-May-1993

The Game:
---------
        Megasquad is a two-player combat-style game with two different modes
of gameplay:  Tag and Duel.  Both game modes are played on boards consisting
of walls and gates, and there are many boards to choose from.  You may either
choose a board each time you play, or you can have the computer pick a random
board.

Control:  The control is based on rotation and thrust.  Each player controls
a ship, and the ship is rotated left and right with the joystick.  Thrust can
be applied by pressing up on the joystick.  In duel mode, the fire button
fires a shot.  Player 1 uses joystick #1 (the free joystick port) and player
2 uses joystick #0 (the mouse port).

Tag:    The object of tag is to accumulate a certain amount of points before
your opponent does.  The player who is not 'IT' accumulates two points per
second.  The player who is 'IT' must try to tag the opponent.  When the player
who is 'IT' tags the opponent, the opponent becomes 'IT'.  There is a three-
second getaway time, and during this time no points are accumulated.
        At the beginning of a Tag game there is a scramble to determine which
player starts out as 'IT'.  Both players are placed at an equal distance from
a red line, and the last player to cross the line starts out the tag match as
'IT'.  There are six different scramble boards, and you can select which one
is used, or you can have the computer select a random one each game.  This is
done from the option screen.

Duel:   The object of the duel game is to shoot your opponent and avoid
getting shot.  You accumulate one point each time you kill your opponent, and
your opponent accumulates a point when he kills you.  The first player to get
a certain number of points wins the game.  There is a three-second
invincibility which takes effect at the beginning of the game and whenever
a player dies and reappears.


Game Options:
-------------
1. Tag Game Length:	You can adjust the score that the tag game goes up
                          to.  The possibilities are 100, 200, 300, and 400.
                          the default is 200.

2. Tag Scramble Board:  The number of the scramble board you wish to use for
                          tag games can be adjusted with this option.  There
                          are six boards, and you can choose to use any one
                          of them, or you can choose the question mark (?) to
                          have the computer pick a random one for each game.
                          The default is Random (?).

3. Duel Game Length:	This option specifies the score that the duel game
                          goes up to.  The possibilities are 2, 4, 6, and 8.
                          The default is 4.

        To adjust the options in the option screen, simply press the number
of the option you wish to change. (1, 2, or 3)

        This game also includes an audio test.  To use it, enter the option
screen and use keys 4 and 5 to select the desired sound effect or music.
Press the enter key to test the selection.


Other Details:
--------------
-       The ESC key gets you back to the main menu from wherever you are.

-       This game does not multitask.  The reason for this is that direct
          hardware programming is used for maximum speed and smoothness,
          however, it restores all system resources and exits nicely,
          allowing any other tasks to continue running.  Tasks are simply
          placed on 'hold' when the game is started.

-       The game is written in 100% 68000 ML.

-       The music is not in the form of modules.  All of the instruments
          and sound effects (other than the snare and bass drums) are
          synthesized on the fly and are not stored as samples in memory.
          I am using a new type of music format that I have developed myself
          for future projects.  This game contains a test version of this
          format.

-       The game has not been tested on AGA machines or the Amiga 3000.  If
          it doesn't seem to work, try turning CPU Cache and Burst off.
          Also, if it fails to run on an AGA machine, try putting the
          screen mode into NTSC (or PAL) before running it.  It will most
          likely fail to run in any other custom AGA screen modes.
