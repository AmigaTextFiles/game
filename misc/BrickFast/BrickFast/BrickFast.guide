@node tips " Tips & Tricks "

Some tips & tricks:

	- You can aim and release the ball by pressing
	   the left or the right mousebutton when it is locked
	   to the bat.
	- You can get power ups when you hit a brick with your
	   original grey ball. The green ball won't give you
	   any power up.
	- You won't get power ups by shooting down the bricks. 
	- The guard is activated immediately as you pick up
	   the falling guard power up object and deactivated 
	   as it disappears (the time is out).
	- There are black bricks!
	- You have to hit some bricks many times to destroy them.
	- Collect as much money as possible to get an extra life!
	- There aren't negative 'power ups' such as death or
	   ball speed-up so you can collect as many as possible.
	- Using the space will cost you 50 points each time.
	- You are allowed to push the table every 20 second.
	- You can accelerate the ball by pressing '2' without
	   voiding your score. Pressing the 'H' - guard off
	   also won't void your score.
	- Press the ESC to quit or 'P' to pause the game.

@node hard "Hardware required."

		Hardware requirements:

The required hardware is any Amiga with at least 900KB of free 
CHIP RAM and 2MB of FAST RAM.
AGA is not neccesary but a hard disk is required to install
the game.

To run BrickFast at full speed (50fps) we recommend using
68030/50 turbo and 4 Mb FAST RAM or better.

The game works under UAE, but extremely slowly on a P166.
