Five level demo of a fun new "Breakout" clone. I'm sure you will of all
played one of the many PD clones that have been around for years. The
gameplay is simple ... you try and destroy a wall of bricks by bouncing a
ball off them, simple YES but great FUN.

In Splat you control, via the mouse, a cute little crab.  Move your crab
at the bottom of the screen from left to right to deflect a bouncing ball.
This ball will destroy shoals of fish, but beware certain fish require
several hits. Once the entire shoal are gone you will move onto the next
level where a different pattern of fish will await you. Bonuses are
collected and either used straight away (panic city) or saved until a
greater effect is indicated on a panel above the main playing area.
Select the powerup you require with the right mouse button, powerups are:

          * Slow down movement of ball.
          * Double crab size. (ouch!!)
          * Sticky crab. (nasty)
          * Triple crab size. (no comment)
          * Hot ball, cuts through everything no bounce.

A startup menu is used to select the game speed, so it's ideal for beginners
or game guru's and will appeal to any age group. Splat also features some
great soundFX.
