Message from Valkyr :
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   I want to thank everyone, who helped me to 'complete' my first game for
the AMIGA. Breakin' Briks is a game from LODGE. The members of LODGE have
been working on this game are listed below.

@NODE AboutVALKYR "About Valkyr"

  Valkyr (thats me :)) is one of the Lodge keepers who does the programming.

   Currently I am working on a lot of other games such as a classic space
invader clone, a racing game and a snake game (???) :-X.
   This game is my second release. I've also made the simple AGA-Experience
demo. Also this little program is still under construction, because I'm not
really pleased about the spead of that demo on the standard Amiga 1200 :(.
   I am currently also working on a program called TimeCalc this program can
do lots of interesting things with time. It calculates time differeces.
Therefore is contains two databases which contain important dates from the
past, or the future ;).

   Concerning Breakin' Briks, the game has after months of hard work now
almost been finished. I have plans to make a level-editor for this game in
the future.... If there is any demand for this.... :)....
   I did the programming of Breakin' Briks and drew some of the graphics.
The blocks, balls and bats where drawn by me. As you can see, I am not
a very great artist :(.
   I have also made one song of this game, this is the song you here at the
level selection screen. This is where you are supposed, to select the next
level.

@ENDNODE

@NODE AboutLusion "About D.Lusion"

   D.Lusion has made the music for this game and I think he did a great job.
He has made in total three songs which are :

          - The music on the title screen.
          - The music on the game over screen.
          - The music for the start of each level.

   D.Lusion als made four funny giggles, for when you've completed a level
or have lost a live. I thought they where quite funny, so I used them in
my game.
   By the way the Lodge logo on the About screen of the game was also drawn
by D.Lusion. I liked it a lot and immediately added it into the game,
because I needed due to name changes of the group a new logo, FAST !!!!
(greeting to TBL, nice demo 'Cybernetic'. ;))

@ENDNODE

@NODE AboutBrite "About Brite"

   Brite is our raytrace artist and I must admit, that he has done some very
nice work in the past. I really liked your 'NCV-10 jaar' contribution. Too
bad it didn't win ;).
   Brite also did some raytracing and drawing for Breakin' Briks. He has
made the Breakin' Briks title screen  at the start and he also rendered the backdrops
of the levels. Especially the backdrops (which use only eight colors) do add
an 'AGA-look' to the game.

@ENDNODE

@NODE AboutIIQ "About I.I.Q."

   I.I.Q. is my teacher, he has learned me anything I know *<:o). Well not
exactly, but he has helped me a lot with some handy hints and with great
object files, which handle gadgets and windows ;}.
   Unfortunately I did not use any of I.I.Q.'s object files in the games,
but I've learned a lot of the sources he gave to me. What I did use for
Breaking Briks, was 'Graphics Trans'. This program is written by I.I.Q.
and converts ILBM-pictures to c-code, or object files. This program works
really great. (when will version 3.0 be completed ??? :)).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   LODGE is a small dutch group, which (only) supports the AMIGA. We do this
because we think, it's still the best 'affordable' computer around and we
do not like the MS-DOS standard :(.
   LODGE has six lodge keepers, which are listed below :

               - A.V.A.    (Audio Visual Artist)
               - Brite
               - D.Lusion
               - I.I.Q.    (Iron I.Q.)
               - Valkyr
               - Zenphir

   Most of them are very active and have worked on this game, or will work
on future releases of LODGE.

@NODE Shareware "About this Shareware release"

   This program is shareware, this means you've go to pay for it. We do not
demand very much money for it, since it is only a test version. But if you
want to encourage us, to complete te game and make a level editor for the
game, you can send any amount of money you like to :

                           Ronald Roemeling

   Remember, paying shareware means that we will be encouraged to provide
you with more software in the future... :].

@{b}IMPORTANT NOTE !!!!!@{ub}

As I said before, this is still a test version so any damage this program
does to files on your harddisk, other problems that might occur, are
not for the responsibility of the author of this program, you also may
not spread this game and ask money for it. This game is shareware and if
you feel generous, you can send any amount you wish to the adress. If
there is enough demand for this game, I might just make a level editor
for the final release ;).

@NODE MainMenu "The main menu"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           About Main Menu 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The main menu works quite simple. There are five options from which you
can choose. Choose the option of your choice (:} by moving the mouse
forward and backward. Select the option by clicking left mouse button
(do I really have to tell this ?)

@{b}  1 - Start the game@{ub}

  When you select this, you enter a second screen, where you can choose from
wich level to start. At first you have no choice. But when you have completed
some more levels, you can choose between several directions. Move the
flashing 'level selection thingy' with your mouse, or the arrow keys.
Press space bar or left mouse button to select a level.

@{b}  2 - Number of players@{ub}

  Not yet implemented. There will be no two players at once option, but
two players separated. (I think there are not many players, which have
two mouses)

@{b}  3 - Game Info@{ub}

  This shows a not yet completed screen, which contains all the power ups
(or power downs :)) and it gives a not so impressive description of these
power ups.

@{b}  4 - About@{ub}

  This will show you a nice LODGE logo, which all the members of LODGE.
Not very functional methinks..... :)

@{b}  5 - Quit@{ub}

  erm... This quits the game... ;(

@ENDNODE

@NODE GamePlay "The game play"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             About Game Play
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Remeber that old classic Break Out, hmm ?? Well I do. This game has a lot of
the same ideas (hm.. hm..) as the old classic has. The basic idea is very
straightforward. You must use your mouse to move the 'bat' from left to right
and form right to left, and try to hit the ball !!!. If this ball accidentally
hits one of the funy blocks on the screen, you get lots of points !!!!

  Sometimes if you hit a block, ther apears a power up, which falls down.
You can catch these power ups by moving the bat under this falling power up.
But look out, some of them are goodies, and some of them are not !!! So
watch you steps.. erm.. I mean your blocks.

  If you catched a power up, you will see that on the right of the screen, one
of the boxes will be filled, and it slowly gets empty. If the box is empty,
the power up has stopped.

  When you have completed a level, an exit appears and you must try to bounce
the ball (or balls) in the exit. For each ball in the exit, you gain extra
points.

  Well that's it I think. There should be no problems of getting the grips
of this game, and I hope you like it. There can still be a lot improved
concerning the game play, so if you've got a suggestion, write it to
me (adress on Shareware section of this guide) or send an E-Mail.

                             About Game Over
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@{b}IMPORTANT !!!@{ub}

  When you enter thw Game Over section, you might just have a score which
is good enough for the high score table. When you've entered your name
and leave the screen, it will save the score automatically to your
harddisk. @{b} SO DO NOT RESET THE COMPUTER AT THIS POINT !!!! @{ub}

  Ther is a risk that the AMIGA will do a verivy check of your hard drive
when you do this. This is very annoying and time consuming.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Help "Help me, please..."

Hi, this is the test version of Break'n'Briks-AGA. It is also the first game
I wrote on the AMIGA. As you probably will notice when you start the game,
it is far from perfect and a lot of improvements can still be added.

I've had some major problems while writing this game, the most important
ones are listed below :

- I do not have a good mod-player routine. The one I've used in the game
  is very old and is written for the soundtracker 2.5 format. I've noticed
  that this routine does not play the modules correct on my configuration.
  It sometimes 'forgets' to play some of the samples :(.
- The routine I used in the game to detect wetter or not a ball has hit a
  block, does not work properly. I had to optimize this routine to keep
  up the speed on slower AGA machines. So I'm looking for a routine (a
  pseudocode will also do) which is fast and always detects wether a 
  ball hits a block or not. The routine I've written, does not detect this
  if the ball moves over the corners of the blocks. (If yu play the
  game, you will see what I mean) :(.
- How can I get a sprite in Hi-res ??? If the ball would be a sprite, I
  whould not have to redraw the backdrop. A sprite in lo-res does not
  look very impressive although :(.
- When I start a program from an icon (this is wbmain in the source listing)
  then I do not know how to get the current path. I used a trick to get
  this done :(.

If anyone knows the answers on these questions and wants to share them with
me, then they can send this to :

@NODE Computer "What for AMIGA do you need ?"

   This game has been tested on several configurations :

           - AMIGA 1200 with no extras                 :(.
           - AMIGA 1200 with 2-Meg fastmem extra       :|.
           - AMIGA 1200 with 4-Meg fastmem extra       :|.
           - AMIGA 1200 with 2-Meg fastmem and a 86030 :).
           - AMIGA 4000 with 4-Meg fastmem and a 86030 :).

   Only when you do not have any fastmem, the game will probably slow down
in some occassions (two balls ans shooting at the same time, for example).
The final game will work best when you've got a Harddisk and this test
version only works with a harddisk.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Install "Install to Hard Disk"

  This game will only run from hard disk, so you've got to install it. I am
glad to tell you, that this installation procedure is not very complex.
Just copy all the files to a directory of your own choice and click on
the icon to start the game...
