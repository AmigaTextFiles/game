        ABOUT THE KEYFILE SYSTEM.
        ***************************************
        The  Deluxe  PacMan uses a key file for enabling the full
        game.  This key includes the address and name of the user
        it  is  registered on, so this file (PACMAN.KEY) must NOT
        be copied to anyone!!  If it's is copied, all other users
        will  get your name and address and everone will see that
        you are a software pirat and are into crimes!


        *********************************************************
        So PLEASE, PLEASE,  DO NOT spread the key file!!!!!!!!!!!

        Some  of the modules that I have included in this archive
        was made by Jogeir Liljedahl.  I just have to say that he
        is one of my favorite composers on the Amiga!!  Extremely
        talented  in  my opinion!  Thanks for composing all those
        masterpieces Jogeir!


*       SMore (Simple More)
        -------------------

        This  is a text reader that is very small and it can also
        read  Amiga Guides.  If the XPK libraries is available it
        can  also  read  XPK packed texts or guides.  Powerpacker
        library  is  also supported.  It can also use the reqtool
        library for a filerequester, and a file can be chosen for
        viewing.  It uses the mouse to scroll through the text.

        Made by Edgar M. Vigdal.


*       Pack
        ----

        This  is a small utility to compress or decompress files.
        This  tool can be used to pack the data file for the game
        if you want to save some disk space

        Usage:

        Pack <file> method <packing method>

        Example...

        Pack MyFile method MASH

        This  will  pack  the file 'MyFile' and replace it with a
        compressed  version  of  the  same file.  If the file was
        already packed it will skip the file.


        To unpack a file use the following command...

        Pack <file>

        The  commando 'Pack #?  all' will unpack all the files in
        the directory and all subdirectories.


*       SetPatch

        Use  this  if you make a selfbooting game disk.  Just add
        it in in the startup-sequence like this:

        SetPatch QUIET

        This  command  will  patch  some  function and engage the
        32  bit  data  fetch  in the AGA chips.  If you don't use
        this  and  boot  from a floppy disk the graphics will not
        come up alright! (Only on AGA machines!)




INSTALLING THE LIBS
-------------------

        In  the  'Libs'  directory  I  have  included some useful
        libraries  that  you could install on your gamedisk or in
        Libs:

        o       xpkmaster.library
                -----------------
                This  library  must  be  installed if you want to
                compress  some  of  the  data files or if you are
                using  modules and datafiles that are compressed.
                The  sub  library  for  all the used packer types
                most be installed in the 'compressors' directory.
                The 'compressors' directory most be placed in the
                'Libs:'   directory   on  your  boot  disk.   The
                'xpkmaster.library'  must be copied to the Libs:
                directory too.


        *NOTE*  If you get an error message when you try to start
                the  game,  that  tells you there is a compressed
                datafile,  you  must copy the XPK library and the
                sub  libraries,  to  the  Libs:  directory on you
                boot disk!  (SYS:, harddisk or floppydisk)

                Libs:
                     xpkmaster.library
                     compressors/
                         xpkMASH.library
                         xpkSQSH.library
