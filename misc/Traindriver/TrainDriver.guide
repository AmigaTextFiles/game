              TRAIN DRIVER 2
              ==============


Modular Train Driver Simulator by Paul Robins available September 1996

Following on from Train Driver 1.9 and TD Route Generator, this new version
combines them with many new features, to allow loading of any route with
details.


New features introduced since TDRG 1.1

  * Semaphore signals plus 2 or 3 aspect colour light signals
  * Guard, station and signalman speech (requires DEVS:narrator.device WB2)
  * New scenery inluding buildings and fir trees
  * Scenery colours and height defineable
  * Trees configurable
  * Double headed locos
  * Double tracks for loops, platforms, Slow/Goods Lines.
  * Signal route indicator now displays any digit
  * Random loco failures
  * Weather seasons
  * Variable fog visibility
  * Reasons for delays displayed
  * Changing train load whenever train stops
  * Loads timings, route and loco from saved train automatically
  * Improved sound effects
  * Tool Types for Driver, Vigilance, Speech, Clock speed, Confirm Quit etc.
  * All known bugs fixed with extra error checking and requesters



Many loco and route data files are being created.
See Price List for details.
Loco files are compatible with TDRG but Route files are not.

Loco data includes start, stop, run and horn sound effects and data file
with loco names etc.
Some locos also have nose and window shape graphics, and a rev sound
effect if appropriate.

I confess to knowing little about the operation of steam loco controls and
the Steam loco uses the same controls as other locos but has pleasing sound
effects with simple graphics.






TD 2 will cost 15 UK pounds, upgrades from TDRG1.1 only 5 pounds

This is Version 1.9 of a Train Driver Simulator, simulating
@{" The Class 87 Locos " LINK "Locos"} working on the West Coast Main Line from
Euston to Glasgow.

I originally wrote this program for my own use, but I have been persuaded
by friends who have played it, that it was suitable for public release.

I wrote this program with the excellent Blitz2 because the
other train driver simulations advertised for fifteen or twenty quid (UKP)
in the railway mags, are generally text based, with limited options
so I wanted to write a program that made you feel that you were
actually in the cab, and one in which the train behaved realistically,
with proper moving graphics, unlimited options, and was freely available.

This program is aimed at users with a little UK railway knowledge
but anyone can have a go. Although the program has moving graphics I
would be the first to admit these are simple and are there mainly to indicate
the approach of railway-related objects, and are not particularly scenic,
although in V1.9 there are curves, bridges and trees added.

I have yet to see a commercial train driver simulator with any graphics
other than signals and still objects.

As well as this guide there are help pics on the disk:

               @{"Help" SYSTEM "SYS:Utilities/MULTIVIEW  Help SCREEN"}
               @{"Keys" LINK 87cabkeys/main}

               @{"Profile" SYSTEM "SYS:Utilities/MULTIVIEW  chart SCREEN"}

The first two pics can be accessed from within the program with the Help key.


Changes since V1.8
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


 o Train codes updated to latest timetable
    1S90 this has changed from 1S89
    1S94 this has changed from 1S13

 o Birmingham - Wolverhampton route added

 o Rainfall added and wind effects

 o Level crossings added with warning boards (W)

 o Loco failures caused by excessive overloads

 o Windscreen effects and wiper on/off indicator

 o Default clock speed x2 option

 o Alternative keys for power: 7890 if m,./ are awkward on your keymap

 o Slow Line signal numbers entered

 o Wiper failures

 o Vigilance now works correctly

 o New MWB Icons (Thanx Timm Baumeister :)

 o Clock speed x6 available

 o Continual optimisation of code and graphics

 o A500 Screen open/GUI bug fixed

SPECIAL NOTE
************


This is expected to be the last freely available version of TrainDriver.
TrainDriver 2 will combine the Route Generator and TrainDriver WCML
into one program including the WCML data files and will be sold
commercially through the UK rail mags. The only alternative is a
great upsurge in the numbers bothering to register!
Those people who have already registered will be offered cheap upgrades.

@TOC "MAIN"

Just drag the TrainDriver disk/drawer to where you want it on your Hard Drive

Open the new TrainDriver drawer and double click Start_TrainDriver
which will make the necessary assigns and run the program.

Or to do it manually:

All the files needed must be in the same drawer which must be
assigned TrainDriver:

e.g.
*   C:Assign Traindriver: DH0:Traindriver/   ( <--or wherever )

Also

     c:Copy Traindriver:fonts/ ALL FONTS:

    OR

*    C:Assign FONTS: Traindriver:fonts/ ADD

Add these lines(*) to your S:user-startup if you use it regularly.

Double-click on TrainDriver1.9 icon if assigns have been made permanent.

If the simulation runs very slowly try and free as much memory as
possible. Turn details off with key J or on the startup screen.
It will multitask but runs quicker on its own.

Boot without startup-sequence and type

cd dh0:Traindriver ( <-- or wherever)
C:execute Start_TrainDriver

or write a short new alternative startup as above

I have done a lot of work to try and make this program work on all
Amigas from A500 to A4000, and it has been successfully ran on many
configurations.

The West Coast Main Line is 401 miles long and runs from London Euston
to Glasgow Central.

        @{"Map" SYSTEM "SYS:Utilities/MULTIVIEW  map SCREEN"}
        @{"Profile" SYSTEM "SYS:Utilities/MULTIVIEW  chart SCREEN"}

The main stations on the route, where some InterCity West Coast services
stop are:

        Watford Junction
        Milton Keynes
        Rugby
        Nuneaton
        Tamworth
        Lichfield Trent Valley
        Stafford
        Crewe
        Warrington
        Wigan North Western
        Preston
        Lancaster
        Oxenholme
        Penrith
        Carlisle

and in Scotland:

        Lockerbie (no ICWC trains stop)
        Carstairs (only 1S26 stops)
        Motherwell


There are many local stations particularly in the London and Birmingham
areas which will be seen along the route.
A good driver sounds the horn to warn any passengers on the platform of his
approach, and at the warning boards for the level crossings.


The highlights of the route are the climbs over Shap and Beattock
summits with @{" Gradients " LINK "Gradients"} as steep as 1 in 69.
Although generally these cause no problems for electric locos,
on wet rails a standing start on these gradients with a heavy train
takes skill, care, and patience

Despite the title of "West Coast" the sea is only visible at Hest Bank,
north of Lancaster.

The quickest scheduled journey time is under five hours on 1S57.

Also included is the Slow Line alternative route from Hanslope to Rugby
via Northampton.

This line is an extension of the Slow lines from Hanslope junction to Rugby.
The line speed is 75 mph and is signalled with 3 aspect colour light signals
(ie no double yellows). This route is two miles longer than the main line
via Weedon. The line falls at 1 in 200, through Hunsbury Hill tunnel, to
Northampton and then climbs at 1 in 230 back up to Rugby through a short tunnel
at Crick.

To force a train to be diverted hold Left-alt key while passing Signal no 69.

Route between Rugby and Wolverhampton added:

This line veers off to the left at Rugby through a 70 mph
junction then at 100 mph to Coventry, Birmingham International
to Birmingham New St, mileage 113.
Then on through the Black Country to Wolverhampton mileage 126

Between Coventry and Wolverhampton there are frequent local trains and four busy
level crossings so there may be delays.

The code for trains to Wolverhampton should be 1G..
Two trains are included:
1G16 0635 and 1G39 1655 Euston - Wolverhampton

Load as usual, but if you change your mind when you get to the
Options screen you will need to set the Route gadget to
Birmingham/Glasgow before loading another train.

Please note that if you have just driven over a summit,
that until at least half of the train has passed over
the top, the gradient will be effectively still uphill,
even though the gradient may read downhill.

@{"Class 87 " SYSTEM "SYS:Utilities/MULTIVIEW  title.pic SCREEN"} locos were built in 1973-75 and are 5,000 hp
AC electric locos, supplied by 25 kv overhead wires. They have four
traction motors which can be used for rheostatic braking above 10 mph.
The power is increased through 38 notches, and then into weak field.

87101 is the most powerful though it is currently ironically
demoted to freight duties. It will generally have a higher random
power rating.

All locos are 110 mph.

Although powerful these locos have a very high power to weight ratio
which means poor adhesion, particularly on a wet rail.

When you start a new journey the loco will be given a random loco-rating.
This will be displayed at the top of the cab screen.

The distance from the next signal is shown on the display in yards.

If you see two yellows, then the next signal may be one yellow and the next
may be red, in which case you must stop within 35 yards of it to get the
message from the signalman.

Some signals, in lower speed areas, have only three aspects, red, yellow
and green. Here there is no advance warning double-yellow.

He may ask you to pass the signal at danger.

Your speed passing a signal with two yellows should generally be below 90mph
and at one yellow try to reduce your speed to 60mph.
If you can see a red signal and you're over 60mph you will struggle to stop.
However, beware of signals closer together than usual, and reduce your speed
accordingly.

A hint to assist stopping is to keep your speed well below
one tenth of the number of yards from the stopping point.

Flashing yellows countdown to a high speed junction, speed 30 to 70mph.

A junction signal either has a letter above, S for Slow Line or
F for Fast Line, or has five white lights diagonally displayed,
indicating the direction of the crossover.

Other signals may have a number displayed indicating the platform that
you will enter.

Junctions without flashing yellow signals are protected by red signals which
will change as the train passes over the @{" AWS " LINK "AWS"} magnet if the
route is set and the line is clear.

These junction speeds vary between 10 and 40 mph.

A warning board will be shown after passing the junction signal
indicating the junction speed, and the speed limit board will
also be seen indicating the position of the junction.

    b       Emergency


 Brake gauge
  

  72   Brake released

  65   Initial application

  50   Full service

   0   Emergency




To apply brakes hold c until the guage reads 50 psi (pounds per square inch)
and release with z when approaching the desired speed level.

Alternatively use v to brake, "catching" the brake with x as the needle comes
down to 50 psi.

Normal Full Service application is 50 psi (vertical needle on dial).
Normally the driver would not use a greater braking force than this,
particularly in the wet.

Allow time for the brakes to release down the length of the train
particularly after heavy braking, before taking power.

When braking try not to brake too hard as you come to a stand
or you will spill the tea, and you will have to wait for the
air brake pipe to charge up again.

Having said that, don't pass a red signal ever, and don't speed excessively
or the guard will put the brake on or you may even derail the train.

In the wet don't be too heavy on the brakes or the wheels may lock up
and slide greatly increasing braking distance.

Your speed passing a signal with two yellows should generally be <90 mph
and at one yellow try to reduce your speed to 60 mph.
If you can see a red signal and you're over 60 mph you will struggle to stop.
However, beware of signals closer together than usual, and reduce your speed
accordingly.

If necessary kill the power with "n". This is bad but better than
passing red signals !

A hint to assist stopping is to keep your speed well below
one tenth of the number of yards from the stopping point,
until the speed is down to 10 mph, then release brakes
completely until about 50 yards, then rub brakes lightly
for smooth stop (no audible screech).

Suggested maximum speeds at 50 psi.

When taking power watch that you don't let the Ammeter go into
the red area or you will overload the motors and lose power.

Reset with "i", you may need more than one attempt.

Note if you overload excessively the loco may fail and your drive is over!

In poor weather you should also stay below the yellow
region to avoid wheelslip.

When reducing power you should use "m" and wait for the notch indicator
to run down, rather than use "n", as sudden shutting off of power
could cause arcing and damage to the motors.

The speed limit is indicated by a white circular sign, with a red border.

Reductions in speed limit are indicated by a white triangle
with a yellow border, with the new limit in black.
Generally about 1.5 miles warning is given, unless two or
more reductions follow closely.
In cases of severe speed reduction, an @{" AWS " LINK "AWS"} horn will sound.

When passing from a lower speed to a higher speed section remember
not to accelerate until the whole train has passed the higher speed
limit board. A guide to this is the fact that the gantries are about
eight coaches apart.

At any point along the route there could be a speed trap set up by traction
inspectors. You will be advised as soon as your speed has been recorded.
If you are speeding there is a possibility you will be releived of your
driving duties immediately.

The maximium permitted speed for the loco and this route is 110 mph.

The warning board is one mile before the neutral section.

As a guide it takes 36 seconds to run down power from full power
which is a mile at 100 mph.

If you shut off power in time, power will be returned at the end of the
short dead section, otherwise you will have to try and reset the motors using
key i after exitting the neutral section.

Note if you overload excessively the loco may fail and your drive is over!

Do NOT use the brakes in a neutral section as it is a rheostatic brake
fed from the motors, so you will lose braking temporarily.

Warning board is white on black, board at neutral section is black on white.

@NODE "Temporary_Restrictions" "Temporary Speed Restrictions"
@TOC "MAIN"

Random TSRs will be generated depending on the Difficulty level selected.
An @{" AWS " LINK "AWS"} horn will sound and a board with flashing white lights will tell
you what speed you must reduce to by the next board. After your train has
passed the "T" board you may resume Line Speed. Remember to allow for the
length of the train to pass. The "T" board on the display will remain there
until the train is clear.

The TSRs will be recorded on the log along with the speed you entered
the restriction.

TSR Boards:  Green with Black figures  or  Blue with White figures

@NODE "Clock" "Clock speed"
@TOC "MAIN"

By holding keys 1 to 6 until the number appears alongside the time,
you may adjust the speed with which time elapses.

eg key 5 will make the clock advance 5 seconds every second

However use the faster clock speeds with care as naturally your
reaction time will effectively be that much slower.

If the  @{" AWS " LINK "AWS"} horn sounds, or a Speed Reduction Board
appears, or certain other events occur, requiring your attention
your clock speed will revert to 1, or 2 if that is chosen as the default
clock speed.

Some occasions the clock speed will always revert to 1.

Key p pauses the simulation.

@NODE "sand" "Sanders"

If you have trouble starting up on a steep, slippery gradient
press u to apply sand for better traction up to 5 mph.

This will not work on a dry rail or above 4 mph.

@TOC "MAIN"

Note: hold keys until desired result is seen

 f   Forward
 r   Reverse
 o   Off

The letters O F or R appear below the brake guage to indicate
current mode.
Note: f&r only work when the game has first started or after the
train has stopped and o has been pressed to stop the motors.
In reality there is a three position switch:

F O R
\ | /

so you must stop, go to O (off) then into Reverse.
Putting the switch into Off while moving will cause a brake
application. Pressing f or r whilst the motors are running and audible
will have no effect.

Also power notches must be run down to zero before changing direction.

So when starting, hold F until you hear the motors start up, and F appears
then hold O until you hear them shut down, see O, then press R until you hear
the motors restart and R appears. You are now in reverse.

NOTE: Maximum speed when reversing is 10 mph.

Esc  Escape without saving etc.
