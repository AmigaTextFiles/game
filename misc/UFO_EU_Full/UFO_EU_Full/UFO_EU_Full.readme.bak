>>> I want it on my hard drive NOW! So come on, what do i do?

    Open up the "UFO_EU_Full" drawer and double click on the "UFO_Install"
    icon. Then just follow the usual installer prompts.


>>> Right, where's the instructions then?

    Full instructions are available from within the game (in the UFOPAEDIA
    section) as well as lots of other useful info to get you off on the
    right track.



    LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN:

      Reports just in, indicate that there has been a sharp upturn in the
    number of sightings of Unidentified Flashing Objects in recent weeks.
      This trend can not be allowed to continue unchecked, and so, a new
    anti-flasher defence force has been created to combat this threat....
    ....this new top secret force shall be known as "X-PANTS".

      You have just been appointed manager of a brand new X-PANTS factory,
    your mission (should you choose to accept it) is to build up this new
    facility into a thriving business that can keep your offensive forces
    supplied with the latest in pants technology so that they, in turn,
    can one day hope to gain the upper hand in the ever increasing struggle
    for supremacy between the forces of good (that's us), and our sworn
    enemies, the FLASHERS!!! (they're the bad guys.....Yaa..Boo..Hiss).
      You have limited funds and only basic weaponry to start with, but,
    with skill, and careful management, you should be able to establish
    a well honed fighting force, equipped with the biggest and best pants
    available, and supported by an efficient (and highly profitable)
    pants-production facility.
                                   Good luck.....
                                            The Chairman. (X-PANTS plc)



    OTHER GAME FEATURES INCLUDE:
      * Up to eight save game positions.
      * Random mission layout generator (won't get the same one twice).
      * Line of sight illumination on missions (spooky).
      * Unique all-terrain X-PANTS interceptor vans (from Sid's).
      * Progressive research and development (for bigger, better pants).
      * Flashers "mac's" on loan from "Syndicate Gents Outfitters plc".
      * Soldiers with "Hard" names (usually).
