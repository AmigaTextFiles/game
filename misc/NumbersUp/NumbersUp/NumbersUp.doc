Preface:

Completed:        December, 1991
Language:         Aztec C v5.0a
Programmer:       Jason Lowe
Age:              18
Comments:         Will have a bit of trouble compiling under Lattice! This 
                  program contains more documentation than NumberUp v1.0 which 
                  should help programmers interested in my source code! Also 
                  the space bar can be used instead of the left mouse button 
                  when playing Numbers Up. 


   If you have any questions about me or my code, or want anything from me
just write to,

   This text file contains the following information.

      i)  Information on how to play NumbersUp.
      ii) Information to C programmers about my code.




i) Information on how to play NumbersUp.

   When numbersup has loaded you will presented with a menu. Press the LMB
to play numbers up. Press the RMB to view the high scores. Press I for
information. Press Q to quit. While you are playing numbersup press the LMB
or the space bar to shoot the numbers up. 

   NumbersUp is a very simple game. The idea is to score as many points as
you can. When you first start playing numbers up, numbers will fly in from
both sides of the screen. You must shoot them up with your left mouse
button ( LMB for short ) or the space bar. When you shoot a number up it will 
stop moving across the screen and start moving up until it hits either the 
line of asterixes or another number. 

   Now how do you score? Very simply. When a number is placed to the right,
to the left or below another number they are multiplied together and added
to your score. BUT if two numbers the same are placed together the game
will end. Also if you let a number fly past without shooting it up you will
loose 100 points.

   The best ten scores will be saved to memory and if you request it will
be saved to disk also. If there is no high score table present on the disk
I will create a simple one consisting of ten scores of 100 points and the
name "Jason" having scored all of them.

   You might have noticed that when you first start the game you will asked
if you would like the high scores saved to disk. This is so you don't have
to always save you high scores to disk, without the hassle of selecting
cancel from the "Disk is write protected" requester.




ii) Information to C programmers about my code.

   NumbersUp was written in Aztec C v5.0a by Jason Lowe. If there is only
the main source code with this game ( numbersup.c ) and none of the include
files and you would like to see the complete source code just write or
if there is no source code at all with this program and you would like to
see it. To compile and link this program there is only a few things you
need to remember. Force the data into chip memory and also link the
compiled code with Anders' Bjerins EASYPLAYER.

   With this program I have written the whole game as many functions. I
then test each function as best I can and then when I am happy with a
particular function I will proceed to write more functions. With NumbersUp
I firstly got numbers running from both sides of the screen, then worked
out how to shoot them up, etc.

   The functions I have used in NumbersUp are, (in no particular order)

      - ViewInstructions
      - ViewHighScores
      - ClearSelected
      - NumbersUp
      - CheckHighScores  
      - InitHighScores
      - LoadHighScores
      - CreateBrandNew
      - CreateNew
      - InitRandom
      - Up
      - DisplayScore
      - InitScreen
      - InitLoc
      - idcmpch
      - Open_Stuff
      - die

   Now a small description of each of these functions,

   - ViewInstructions
      This draws a image into the rastport. It is drawn if the user presses
      the letter "I" at the main menu.

   - ViewHighScores
      This will display the current top ten highscores. This is activated
      if the user presses the right mouse button from the main menu. It is 
      also activated if the user gets a high score.

   - ClearSelected
      This clears the rectangular area where all the numbers are drawn. It
      does no clear the main title "NumbersUp" and the surrounding border.

   - NumbersUp
      This is the main game NumbersUp. It is called when the user presses
      the left mouse button from the main menu.

   - CheckHighScores
      This checks to see if the user has got a high. If the user has it
      will change the high score list accordingly. It will also save the high
      scores to disk if the user has previously specified.

   - InitHighScores
      This will try to load the high score table from disk. If it is
      sucsessful the high scores used while the program is active will be those
      loaded from the disk. If it can't open a high score table it will create a
      brand new one consisting of all ten names being JASON and all having 
      scored 100 points.

   - LoadHighScore
      This loads all the high scores from disk into memory. It uses a
      string array for the names loaded called names and for the scores it 
      uses an integer array called scores.

   - CreateBrandNew
      This creates a brand new high score table consisting of ten names 
      called JASON and ten scores of 100 points.

   - CreateNew
      This creates a new disk file of high scores if the user gets a high
      score AND the user wishes to save thier scores to disk.

   - InitRandom
      This reseeds the random number generator.

   - Up
      This sends a number up from a specific location on the screen. It is
      called from the function NumbersUp when the user presses the left mouse 
      button and a number is moving across the screen.

   - DisplayScore
      This displays the current score. It is called from NumbersUp when the
      user has sent a number up, and thier score has changed.

   - InitScreen
      This draws the asterixes around the screen, so a border can specify
      where the number can go.

   - InitLoc
      This clears all data about what numbers are where. It clears the
      variable loc out such that the computer thinks there are no numbers on the
      screen.

   - idcmpch
      This checks the IDCMP. It returns 1 for a left mouse button press, or
      2 for a right mouse button press, or the raw value for any key pressed on
      the key board.

   - Open_Stuff
      Opens the libraries needed, a screen, and a window.

   - die
      Frees everthing that needs freeing and also closes everything that
      needs closing.
   

   I hope all of this documentation helps you C programmers out there.

   In the mean time, happy programming and computing...
