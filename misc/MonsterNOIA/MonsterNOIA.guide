                         @{"Gregor Rosenauer" link "Author" 0} alias Rosso ;-)


        This is a little company I founded when I wrote this game.
        Why the heck did I do this?  Here are some reasons why:

        - I thought I needed something for a cool intro:)

        - I wanted to find a 'label' I could batch on my games/programms,
          something I could identify with and which I think is essential,
          something which would express my ideals and aims.
          It happened that when I was learning Greek, I came across the
          term "noesis", noun for  "no'eo",  which means  "to recognise",
          but also "to realise" and "to think", "to think something out",
          "to imagine something".
          So I took this term as a symbol for my  creations, as I find these
          words describe elemental things,  without those mankind would  not
          be where it is now -  ideas and thoughts have always allowed us to
          surpass ourselves, they have been the requirement of inception, of
          things which did not exist before, they can change things from one
          second to the other.

          You did not expect such poetic excesses in a *games*-documentation,
          did you? ;-> Well, I don't want to write a boring How-To-Documenta-
          tion, I want you to know a little about the _background_...
          However I can promise you that the game is not that sophisticated.;)

        - because nobody would believe me I did it all alone ;-)

THE BACKGROUND

The initial idea was to look whether I could write a bigger project, for example
a game, in my preferred programming-language, @{"BlitzBasic" link "BLITZ-Info" 0} (in the beginning it
was Blitz->I<, which even less people might know now..:)  ). I was a bit
frustrated when I saw that I had only wrote little programms to test out the
many features Blitz has, but when thinking of what useful or "kewl" software I
had produced, @{"nothing" link "GAG" 0} came into my mind...:(

THE IDEA IS BORN

So I said to myself, "let's try" and over the years (yes, I know, it  was quite
a @{"long period" link "History" 0} of time;) ) when I had time to relax and get creative (mostly in
the summer- or christmas-holidays), I took the project another step beyond, and
@{"*this*" link "Game-Description" 0} is what came out of it:-)

CONCLUSION

This is the *first* game I ever wrote, and after all the fun  (but also
@{"*hard* work" link "History" 0} I had, I promise: it will not be the last..!

BTW I decided to make the @{"sources" link "Source" 0} available for a really low fee, see there.

However, I have also made some attempts to produce so-called @{"'serious' software" link "Other Projects" 0},
please see there for more information. (all FreeWare:), not yet released )

 GAME - DESCRIPTION
 ------------------

 OVERVIEW

 This is one of those strange games where you view the level from the
 top, but you see everything from the side;-P
 Your mission is to collect the passwordletters lying around and then
 search for the exit (the pink one) to get to the next level. As I am
 not going to make it that easy for you, some cute MONSTERS join your
 quest with the rather nasty intention to _kill_ you.

 In principle, this game reduces the infinity of universe to _three_
 points of interest:

 @{"i)   >You<" link "Game-Description" 21}
 @{"ii)  The Monsters" link "Game-Description" 31}
 @{"iii) What else is lying around there" link "Game-Description" 42}

 i) YOU

 You are a strange 14*14-pixel-sized bloke in Low-Resolution, with
 blue hair and a green rucksack on the back (wondered what it was?
 hey, I said you should read the docs *first* - now you know :) ).
 You cannot shoot the monsters, but you can walk faster than they
 can and there is also a magic potion to make you invulnerable for
 a short time (but don't loose your head;-) ).  You are also quite
 strong which enables you to move stones.

 ii) THE MONSTERS

 These are rather funny wibbling woosels walking around disturbing
 you and sometimes chasing you, depending on the monster-type:
 The green and the yellow ones change their direction only  when a
 wall or stone is in their way; the blue one that looks similar is
 a bit more interesting:  it can change it's direction _any_ time,
 which makes it quite unpredictable.
 The blue 'mammoth'-like monster is the most unpleasant one: it is
 intelligent (well, kind of;-) ) and tries to chase you.

 iii) WHAT ELSE IS LYING AROUND THERE

 Passwordletters ....... the most important items lying around and
                         the only way to complete the game(level):
                         They have to be collected  before you can
                         enter the exit.If you have collected them
                         in the right order, you get a bonus:)

 Stones ................ can be moved or be used to block monsters

 Doors  ................ can only be opened with the same-coloured
                         keys - only the *grey* one  can be opened
                         with any key

 Keys   ................ necessary to open the doors- just like in
                         real life;-). The grey key enables you to
                         open _any_ door, but be sure that you use
                         it wise,  or else you might realise later
                         that you  wasted it on a door there was a
                         right-coloured key for:->

 Teleports ............. Since StarTrek the fashion of beaming has
                         become quite popular - teleports beam you
                         just the same way, but only from one tele-
                         port to the other.

 Oneways ............... block the way _back_

 Extras ................ there are some useful extras like Protect,
                         Stop, meat (cannot be collected, but lurs
                         the blue Chase-Monster away from you), but
                         beware:  there are also extras  which have
                         *bad* sight-effects...! (of course I will
                         Not tell you which:-] )

 Boni .................. to brush up your Score:)

 Exit .................. the last point you have to visit to get to
                         the next level (of course you can only enter
                         if you have collected _all_ password-letters
                         which are scattered over the whole level.

 HOW TO CREATE YOUR OWN LEVELS - LEVELED
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 If you have completed all the levels MonsterNoia has to offer,
 and you want More, there is the possibility to create your OWN
 levels - bigger, harder, meaner and more deadly;) than I could
 have ever done them;-)

 You can do this quite easily with LevelED (also included), and
 after using it for a short while, you will have no problems in
 designing your own levels, because it is really intuitive  and
 easy to use, there is even an Online-Help available.

 However, there are some important things to keep in mind, only
 to ensure the level looks/works exactly as you expect it to:
 (these points are also mentioned in the Online-Help,  but they
 are explained more detailed here)

 * You have to set at least _one_ monster to justify the games'
   name ;-)
 * You cannot set more than 28 monsters, as this will slow down
   the game too much (on an A500). I know that AGA-systems  and
   systems equipped with turboboards (I have an A1200 68030/50)
   could easily manage more monsters, but I could not test this
   out thoroughly and I want the levels to work on any machine.
   If the number was set too high,the game could even crash, so
   I took a safe value. (<-- please see also the BETA-NOTE !)
 * When the level is empty, you can see only marble-items. This
   is not just because it looks nice;-), but has an *Important*
   meaning: This item has to be placed everywhere _outside_ the
   level,that is places you (and the monsters) cannot reach and
   where no extras should appear.  You will not often need this
   item, only when you delete an old item and you want to leave
   this place 'empty', you have to place the marble-item to set
   the 'border' of the level right.
 * You have to set a password which may only consist of letters
   from A-Z and may only be up to 5 characters long.
 * You can then place the letters easily by pressing the corres-
   ponding key and clicking the mouse on the desired position.
 * pressing the right mousebutton will replace the corresponding
   item with a blank one.
 * you can toggle the toolbar at the buttom by pressing the right
   mousebutton over it.
 * navigate simply with the Cursor-keys, when combined with SHIFT,
   you can browse through the level at steps of 10, when pressing
   ALT in conjunction with either Cursor-key, you can jump direct-
   ly to the borders of the level.
 * to get an overview, just press the "Eye"-button at the top of
   the screen, you will then see the whole level scaled to the
   screen-size (sorry, no graphics-cards support yet ;) )
 * Ok, that should be sufficient for now, just give it a try, you
   will find it very easy to create your own levels after  trying
   out the buttons:)
 * Always keep in mind: someone should be able to actually PLAY
   the level you created ! ;-))

 MonsterNOIA has been currently tested on the following configurations:

 A1200 - virgin
       - HD (yes, this game is easily HD-installable:) )
       - Blizzard1220/4 (28MHz)
       - Blizzard1230/4 (50MHz)
       - Blizzard1230/4 + FPU 68882 + SCSI-Kit IV
         ^^^ **excellent** silicon work!!

 A4000/060 (!) - yeah, it works:=)

 This game should even run on an old Amiga500/1MB, because I started
 writing it on that configuration, so it had to;-). However the game
 has undergone some revisions and enhancements, so I am not 100%sure
 if it still works under 1.3/1MB, but I would like to know...:>

 CONTRIBUTIONS (LEVELS..!)

 It would be very *nice* if you could create some nice/nasty/
 !HARD!/deadly dangerous levels with the included @{"LevelEditor" link "UserLevel-Info" 0},
 because ATM there are only *4* levels:(. (I concentrated on
 the game itself and only created levels for _testing_ purposes;) )

 You only have to use LevelED and save the levels normally, with
 unique numbers. MonsterNOIA will then search for them in the
 Levels/User-drawer (where LevelED saves its levels) and you
 only have to specify the number, and - voilá, there you go!:)

 NOTICE

 As already mentioned, MonsterNOIA _disables_ multi-tasking when
 running, so PLEASE check that there is NO disk-access or other
 important calculation when you run the game, as this can - as
 you surely know - corrupt your HD,disk or data.
 Almost every game does so, however I thought I'd write that in
 sothat you don't forget..;)
 To minimize chance any problems arise, the game waits 2 secs or
 so before it takes over the machine, so it should be really safe.
 Maybe I put in a requester in the final version, like Psygnosis
 did in their game "Hired Guns"..?

 INFORMATION ON BLITZBASIC II
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 First of all I want to say I get nothing paid for this, and  if
 you are annoyed by this, please skip this section, as I do  not
 intend to annoy people.

 If however you are curious about the language this game was pro-
 grammed in, and in general how you can get the most out of your
 Amiga with justifiable effort, then  this section is for *you*,
 and I hope you will find it interesting and informative to read.

 For the quick/impatient readers;-) the contents of this page:

 @{"The Language Itself" link "BLITZ-Info" 63}
 @{"The Debugger" link "BLITZ-Info" 88}

 @{"The Future" link "BLITZ-Info" 115}


 WHAT IS BLITZBASIC ][ ? (current version: 2.1)
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 BlitzBasic-2 is a powerful language which allows you to unleash
 the *full* power of your Amiga with a comfort otherwise only in
 BASIC-languages.

 However Blitz is _not_ another Basic-language, but has combined
 many popular features of other languages like PASCAL,C and even
 Assembler.

 This means you can use structs (Records) - allowing you to pro-
 gramm the Amiga-OS in its natural way, as  Blitz-Programms are
 fully OS-compatible.

 You work in a fully integrated environment which means that you
 can access the compiler and the debugger from within the editor
 at the click of a button.

 There are several aspects that even taken seperately make Blitz
 superior to other languages which try to pretend the same power,
 but alltogether make Blitz-2 unique and brilliant,ideal for the
 beginner _and_ the experienced user alike.


 The (T)Editor (SuperTED or TED 2.1/2.5 (2.5 is commercial)
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - mouseable labels: you can specify labels by simply  putting a
   dot at the beginning of the line. These labels then appear in
   a column on the right margin of the screen  and can be easily
   accessed by the mouse.
 - Blitz-commands are highlighted during typing
 - the font can be changed by the user
 - *ONLINE-Help*, either a short syntax-description (HELP-key) in
   the titlebar or a full documentation with examples.
 - quick save-format which also saves diskspace
 - defined Structures can be easily viewed in a seperate window
   (called "NewTypes" in Blitz, see below)
 - it has been thoroughly revised in the past and a severe upgrade
   should be out soon (featuring _multiple_ documents, ARexx,...)

 The Language Itself
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - at first it seems a bit strange: standard BASIC-commands (Dim,
   Print, For, While,...) and then suddenly *structures* (Newtypes),
   ASM-commands (can be used *within* normal Blitz-code, for example
   for Interrupts, Copper-programming and the like!), and other heavy
   stuff - but you soon find out the concept and how !powerful! it is.
   Once you get used to it, you will never look back again!
 - beside the normal Basic-commands, which are slightly enhanced over
   the traditional ones, you have *special commands* for Graphics and
   Sound (fast Blitting, playing samples, Bitmap-operations, loading
   and showing pictures, animations,...) - all with FULL AGA-support!
 - several commands to work _with_ the Amiga-OS (not against or beside
   it, as in other underdeveloped languages!) to create Windows, Gad-
   gets, Screens, Menus, Requesters (full gadtools-support)
 - this means you have an ideal language for *both* games AND serious
   applications
 - standard-library-system, which means that you can use every library
   from within Blitz in the same way as normal Blitz-commands.
 - there are loads of libraries available (most on Aminet) which make
   Blitz even more powerful and/or easy to use.
 - ...just get the demo on Aminet to see what I am talking about!
   (one demo says more than 1000 words:) )
 - you won't believe me anyway, so why not try it out yourself?

 The Debugger (by Leading Edge Software, now known as "Red When Excited")
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - easy to use, but yet powerful Source-Level-Debugger, which means you
   can browse through the source while it is executed and see what your
   programm exactly does.
 - has saved my Amiga from a crash maybe more than 1,000,000 times ;-)
 - Variables can be inspected and traced
 - Structures can be inspected thoroughly
 - another major update is to be released

 Support (now gaining vitality again...:-] )
 ~~~~~~~
 - there is the BUM (Blitz User Magazine), including a newsletter and  in
   most cases serious updates with interesting examples and contributions
   from Blitz-Users worldwide
 - there is much support on the WEB, some Blitz-Experts have done a  very
   good job on documenting the Amiga's internal life and how to access it
   from within Blitz, two out of many addresses are mentioned below:
   http://sun1.bham.ac.uk/cca93057
   http://www.pinsight.com/~josh
 - there is an own newsgroup for Blitz2-users worldwide: @{"the blitzlist" link "Blitz-Lists" 0}
 - many PD-games on @{"Aminet" link "Aminet" 0} show you just what you can do with Blitz-2 and
   often the source is available for deeper investigation...

   (BTW: MonsterNoia/LevelED-source is also available! _Well_ documented,
   in English -> see @{">>here<<" link "Source" 0} )

 The Future - Blitz-@{fg highlight}3@{fg text}
 ~~~~~~~~~~
 - There are plans to upgrade Blitz to support multiple platforms such as
   WinDos and the PowerPC, which would be quite a revolutionary move into
   the right direction and *very* interesting news for professional game-

 Extro
 ~~~~~

 Well I wanted to bring this out now before it gets
 delayed even more - I hope you like it and have fun,
 and maybe add some nice levels for all of us...:)

 If I don't get flamed;) I intend to upload a better
 LevelED (for now, it multitasks badly for speed-reasons:-\ ),
 and I also want to upload *new* sets of "Blits", which
 means a totally new design of walls, stones, monsters etc.!
 (Maybe winter, future etc...)

 If someone wants to contribute a different design,
 I will glady supply all necessary information.
 (it's not too hard)

 I wish the Amiga all the best and hope it's still alive
 when you read this:-\

 Also good luck to QuickPak for their brave efforts -
 I hope they are more correct and fair to all of us
 than VIS*** was. May it *die* the death it deserves.
 (looks so, anyway).

 Please spread this game all over the world if you want
 to, everyone can have fun with it:->
 CD (Aminet, for example)-distributions are more than
 welcome.

 To Urban Mueller: Meeting Pearls show that it _is_
 possible to make the CDs AND give freebies to the
 authors.... aehem.:->

 Ok, now - what are you waiting for? The MONSTERS are
 waiting for YOU already:-))) hehehe...

 M O N S T E R   N O I A
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 by Gregor Rosenauer (c) 1992-96

 history

 developed ............from...March 10th, 1992 to ???
 MAIN .................from....July  6th, 1992 to September 7th, 1992
 Conversion to Blitz*2*..on December 7th, 1992
 Over-Screen-Levels .....on  October 18th,1993

 In between LONG BREAKS (SCHOOL, A-levels etc.!!!)

 Revived...in Feburary 1996 (!), with Blitz *2.1*
  - only NOW: Blitz-internal Inkey$/BitmapInput-Bug solved(!)
  - Animbrush (Title) extended to 10 Shapes -> really smOOth ! :)
  - Coplist-Problem solved:) !

Changes:

** not fully up-to-date, but it should give you an idea
   of what was going on:)
23.05.1996 (exams!): *fixed userlevels for HD-support
                      (no longer searches 'df0:'!)
                     *Titlebrush now a bit bigger=looks better
                      -Scorebar  ->Glitches? May 96:
 (*) "MultiMonstering when beaming" - now monsters continue moving
     _While_ you get teleported:->>
 (*) Used Blitz-Internal FadeOut-command instead of self-made routine
 (*) Monster-Animations a bit jerky... bug solved (wrong counter)!
 (*) Titelbrush too small on the gamescreen -> fixed, now there are
     ugly glitches if the scorebar is at the bottom of the display:(
 (*) Extras limited to 10
 (*) NOW: when you collect a passwordletter, you get score
 (*) BONUS if all passwordletters are collected in the RIGHT order!
     (was Albert's idea, thanks!)
 (*) USER-LEVEL-support revied, now the GAME-Levels are _also_ on
     disk, reorganised location of the levels on disk:
     Game-Levels are now in MonsterNoia/Levels/, User-Levels are in
     MonsterNoia/Levels/User -> this enables also disk-based users
     to add as MANY user-levels as they want, as long as they are
     organised in that directory-structure. (without the need of
     an additional 'Assign')
 (*) Keys: first the coloured keys are used, only THEN the grey ones
     (else this could lead to unfair/unsolvable situations..)
 (/) Press Fire to what..? (Protect?...) <-- CANCELLED, I don't
     really think it's necessary to have something to do with the
     fire-button, and I don't want to implement it anymore;-)
 (*) use WHOLE Screen (->Scorebar displayed wrong/NOT at all?!)
   --->Glitches?!
   --->Work-around: Scorebar 21 pixel from buttom of display
 (*) Chasemonster: gfx-'bug' fixed: transparent colours removed
     where they should not be..! (->lead to flickering!)
 (+) monsters sometimes flickering -> sorry, cannot do much about
     that, this is a speed problem:( (the display-routine is exe-
     cuted every 1/50sec already!)
 (*) Fixed Font for optimal optical appearance;)
 (*) ->LevelEd enhanced: Show-Bug fixed, Qualifiers supported!
     (SHIFT, ALT)
 (*) DOCUMENTATION added, also HTML! -> on Homepage
 (?) NTSC-Mode should work...(cannot test this out)

 The infinite world of ...AmiNET
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 From the cover of Aminet-CD 11 (April 1996):

 "Aminet® is the world's largest collection of freely distributable
  Amiga® software. Up to 10,000 users access the vast archives daily,
  and countless programmers publish initially via Aminet®. Only three
  years after its inception, Aminet® now holds the equivalent of more
  than 7,500 floppy disks of software."

 As you can see with MonsterNOIA, Aminet is really *the* online-source
 for all kind of excellent software ;-)

 The blitzlists discuss everything related to Blitz, and you can
 be sure that someone has an answer to your question if it is re-
 lated to Blitz...
 The blitz3-list is more for experienced people, and the level is
 quite technical (concrete discussions about multiple-plattform-
 support and serious plans, ideas).

 To subscribe, just send a mail to majordomo@helsinki.fi with the
 line "subscribe blitz2-list" or "subscribe blitz3-list". The sub-
 ject is ignored. I hope I remember the names right; just mail me

 INSTALLATION
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~

 No Assigns needed, but this is important: you have to copy the
 fonts in the "Fonts"-directory to FONTS:, or else the game will
 crash.
 You can move the game-drawer to *any* destination, preferably
 on your HD.:->

 If you are dubious about the stability of the game, you can
 go for sure with using the "Monsternoia.db"-version: it has
 the runtime-error-debugger built in and thus quits *safely*
 with an error-requester.

 This piece of software requires:

 - 1 MB of memory (not sure, though; when I started on my A500/1MB,
   1 MB was enough, but now I have 2+4MB and cannot check this out)
 - Kickstart 1.3 _should_ be sufficient, even for the LevelED, be-
   cause I don't use specific 2.04+-functions, but I cannot verify
   this...(here is where I need your help, fellow Beta-Testers:) )
 - erm..an AMIGA might also come in handy...

 - MonsterNoia/LevelED have @{"NewIcons" link "NI-info" 0}, but you only need NewIcons if
   you want to be able to display these nice icons,  if NewIcons is
   not installed, you will not even notice, but just see normal WB-
   icons (also special, nicely drawn icons:) ).
 - AGA is not needed, but of course speeds up the game,same is true
   for FAST-mem.

 INFORMATION ABOUT THE NEWICONS-SYSTEM by Nicola Salmoria
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Note: this is not an 'official' info about NewIcons, but
       more what I would like to tell you about it.
       If you want specific/technical information please
       check the documentation of NewIcons.

 @{"General info" link "NI-info" 14}     - important if you don't know NewIcons
 @{"Features" link "NI-info" 45}         - what it can and why you must have it
 @{"Where you get it" link "NI-info" 69} - have I made you curious? :->

 @{b}GENERAL INFO@{ub}

 Most important thing first: This is *NOT* another icon-
 package with cute icons for every possible purpose you
 could imagine, BUT it is a totally _new_ approach wich
 is both *powerful* and easy to use - you won't even no-
 tice that you use NewIcons once it is installed - what
 you WILL notice however is that your icons look *good*
 in every colour-resolution because the colour-data  is
 stored _within_ the icon (actually as 'ToolTypes', but
 you will only see that if you don't have NewIcons  in-
 stalled - yes, that's why some icons have these weird
 characters and a line which says "Don't change ..." ,
 these are *NewIcons* ).

 I think this had to be said, because many people don't
 understand why it is a good idea to use NewIcons, they
 are detracted by the  isometric-styled icons  included
 in the package, but the _Style_ of the icon is TOTALLY
 pointless - you can of course use ANY style, only  the
 *format* has to be NewIcons, sothat you can take advan-
 tage of the many features mentioned below.

 To all MagicWB-freaks out there: Why oh why don't  you
 save your good work as @{i}NewIcons@{ui}?? I don't like the pa-
 lette of MagicWB and I don't want to be bound to  it,
 so all MagicWB-icons look really *crap* on my WB.
 If you used the NewIcons-format, they would  look just
 as you intended them to look, rather than being distor-
 ted and all over pink/blue/green.

 @{b}FEATURES@{ub}

 * enables you to use icons with up to 256 colours-icons
   and remaps them in real-time  (no overhead noticable)
   ->no more distorted and wrong-coloured icons, but al-
   ways the *original* / best-possible palette. (on AGA-
   systems, you will always have the original colours!)
 * you can simply make a brush into a newicon - imagine
   using digitised pictures as Icons..!
 * works even on Kick 2.04
 * totally _transparent_ - for the user, everything  re-
   mains the same, but gets much more powerful
 * DefIcons-system: part of the NewIcons-package, allows
   you to select default-tools and -icons for files with-
   out icons. Very efficient and FAST, *many*  filetypes
   are recognised.
   You can for example define viewers for GIF-files,....
   which will automagically appear in the  'Execute'-Box
   when you doubleclick the fake-icon.
 * Enables you to change the CrossDOS-icon which  really
   looks a bit too 'peeCee' (DOS-look:( )
 * Unique icons for RAM-Disk, CD-ROMs etc. included.
 * FREE-Ware.  <- propably the best:)

@{b} WHERE YOU GET IT@{ub}

 I got it from Aminet (also on CD #11), but there should
 be other (disk-based?) sources, too. Please get in con-
 tact with the author / newsgroups if you don't find it.
 Latest version is NewIconsv_3_.
