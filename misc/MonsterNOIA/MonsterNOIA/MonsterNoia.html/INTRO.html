THE BACKGROUND<P>

The initial idea was to look whether I could write a bigger project, for example
a game, in my preferred programming-language, <A href=BLITZ-Info.html>BlitzBasic</A> (in the beginning it
was Blitz-&gt;I&lt;, which even less people might know now..:)  ). I was a bit
frustrated when I saw that I had only wrote little programms to test out the
many features Blitz has, but when thinking of what useful or &quot;kewl&quot; software I
had produced, <A href=GAG.html>nothing</A> came into my mind...:(<P>

THE IDEA IS BORN<P>

So I said to myself, &quot;let's try&quot; and over the years (yes, I know, it  was quite
a <A href=History.html>long period</A> of time;) ) when I had time to relax and get creative (mostly in
the summer- or christmas-holidays), I took the project another step beyond, and
<A href=Game-Description.html>*this*</A> is what came out of it:-)<P>

CONCLUSION<P>

This is the *first* game I ever wrote, and after all the fun  (but also
<A href=History.html>*hard* work</A> I had, I promise: it will not be the last..!<P>

BTW I decided to make the <A href=Source.html>sources</A> available for a really low fee, see there.<P>

However, I have also made some attempts to produce so-called <A href=Other_Projects.html>'serious' software</A>,
please see there for more information. (all FreeWare:), not yet released )
