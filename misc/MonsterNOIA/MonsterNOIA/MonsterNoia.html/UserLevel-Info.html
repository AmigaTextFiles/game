 HOW TO CREATE YOUR OWN LEVELS - LEVELED
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 If you have completed all the levels MonsterNoia has to offer,
 and you want More, there is the possibility to create your OWN
 levels - bigger, harder, meaner and more deadly;) than I could
 have ever done them;-)<P>

 You can do this quite easily with LevelED (also included), and
 after using it for a short while, you will have no problems in
 designing your own levels, because it is really intuitive  and
 easy to use, there is even an Online-Help available.<P>

 However, there are some important things to keep in mind, only
 to ensure the level looks/works exactly as you expect it to:
 (these points are also mentioned in the Online-Help,  but they
 are explained more detailed here)<P>

 * You have to set at least _one_ monster to justify the games'
   name ;-)
 * You cannot set more than 28 monsters, as this will slow down
   the game too much (on an A500). I know that AGA-systems  and
   systems equipped with turboboards (I have an A1200 68030/50)
   could easily manage more monsters, but I could not test this
   out thoroughly and I want the levels to work on any machine.
   If the number was set too high,the game could even crash, so
   I took a safe value. (&lt;-- please see also the BETA-NOTE !)
 * When the level is empty, you can see only marble-items. This
   is not just because it looks nice;-), but has an *Important*
   meaning: This item has to be placed everywhere _outside_ the
   level,that is places you (and the monsters) cannot reach and
   where no extras should appear.  You will not often need this
   item, only when you delete an old item and you want to leave
   this place 'empty', you have to place the marble-item to set
   the 'border' of the level right.
 * You have to set a password which may only consist of letters
   from A-Z and may only be up to 5 characters long.
 * You can then place the letters easily by pressing the corres-
   ponding key and clicking the mouse on the desired position.
 * pressing the right mousebutton will replace the corresponding
   item with a blank one.<P>

 * you can toggle the toolbar at the buttom by pressing the right
   mousebutton over it.
 * navigate simply with the Cursor-keys, when combined with SHIFT,
   you can browse through the level at steps of 10, when pressing
   ALT in conjunction with either Cursor-key, you can jump direct-
   ly to the borders of the level.
 * to get an overview, just press the &quot;Eye&quot;-button at the top of
   the screen, you will then see the whole level scaled to the
   screen-size (sorry, no graphics-cards support yet ;) )
 * Ok, that should be sufficient for now, just give it a try, you
   will find it very easy to create your own levels after  trying
   out the buttons:)
 * Always keep in mind: someone should be able to actually PLAY
   the level you created ! ;-))
