</PRE>
Changes:<P>

23.05.1996 (exams!): *fixed userlevels for HD-support<PRE>
                      (no longer searches 'df0:'!)
                     *Titlebrush now a bit bigger=looks better
                      -Scorebar  -&gt;Glitches? May 96:
 (*) &quot;MultiMonstering when beaming&quot; - now monsters continue moving
     While you get teleported
 (*) Used Blitz-Internal FadeOut-command instead of self-made routine
 (*) Monster-Animations a bit jerky... bug solved (wrong counter)!
 (*) Titelbrush too small on the gamescreen -&gt; fixed, now there are
     ugly glitches if the scorebar is at the bottom of the display:(
 (*) Extras limited to 10
 (*) NOW: when you collect a passwordletter, you get score
 (*) BONUS if all passwordletters are collected in the RIGHT order!
     (was Albert's idea, thanks!)
 (*) USER-LEVEL-support revied, now the GAME-Levels are _also_ on
     disk, reorganised location of the levels on disk:
     Game-Levels are now in MonsterNoia/Levels/, User-Levels are in
     MonsterNoia/Levels/User -&gt; this enables also disk-based users
     to add as MANY user-levels as they want, as long as they are
     organised in that directory-structure. (without the need of
     an additional 'Assign')
 (*) Keys: first the coloured keys are used, only THEN the grey ones
     (else this could lead to unfair/unsolvable situations..)
 (/) Press Fire to what..? (Protect?...) &lt;-- CANCELLED, I don't
     really think it's necessary to have something to do with the
     fire-button, and I don't want to implement it anymore;-)
 (*) use WHOLE Screen (-&gt;Scorebar displayed wrong/NOT at all?!)
   ---&gt;Glitches?!
   ---&gt;Work-around: Scorebar 21 pixel from buttom of display
 (*) Chasemonster: gfx-'bug' fixed: transparent colours removed
     where they should not be..! (-&gt;lead to flickering!)
 (+) monsters sometimes flickering -&gt; sorry, cannot do much about
     that, this is a speed problem:( (the display-routine is exe-
     cuted every 1/50sec already!)
 (*) Fixed Font for optimal optical appearance;)
 (*) -&gt;LevelEd enhanced: Show-Bug fixed, Qualifiers supported!
     (SHIFT, ALT)
 (*) DOCUMENTATION added, also HTML! -&gt; stick onto Homepage
 (?) NTSC-Mode should work... Beta-Testers?!
