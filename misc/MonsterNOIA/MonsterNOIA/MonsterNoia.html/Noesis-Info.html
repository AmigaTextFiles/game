        This is a little company I founded when I wrote this game.
        Why the heck did I do this?  Here are some reasons why:<P>

        - I thought I needed something for a cool intro:)<P>

        - I wanted to find a 'label' I could batch on my games/programms,
          something I could identify with and which I think is essential,
          something which would express my ideals and aims.
          It happened that when I was learning Greek, I came across the
          term &quot;noesis&quot;, noun for  &quot;no'eo&quot;,  which means  &quot;to recognise&quot;,
          but also &quot;to realise&quot; and &quot;to think&quot;, &quot;to think something out&quot;,
          &quot;to imagine something&quot;.
          So I took this term as a symbol for my  creations, as I find these
          words describe elemental things,  without those mankind would  not
          be where it is now -  ideas and thoughts have always allowed us to
          surpass ourselves, they have been the requirement of inception, of
          things which did not exist before, they can change things from one
          second to the other.<P>

          You did not expect such poetic excesses in a *games*-documentation,
          did you? ;-&gt; Well, I don't want to write a boring How-To-Documenta-
          tion, I want you to know a little about the _background_...
          However I can promise you that the game is not that sophisticated.;)<P>

        - because nobody would believe me I did it all alone ;-)
