 ------------<P>

 This game is <A href=URL-Info.html>URL</A>-Ware.  If you use it, I would ask you to send me an
 interesting/*weird* (preferred)/informative URL, be it your homepage
 or any other interesting place you came across your virutal voyage.
 If you do not have Internet-access (which would really be a pity;) ),
 please send me a postcard of your country or a nice letter:), just to
 show me that someone looks at my nice game :^).<P>

 This game follows the FreeWare-concept. All rights remain by the
 author, but it may be freely distributed (only at _cost-price_),
 under the condition that *all* files (yes, even the nice NewIcon;),
 remain in the very order I put them together. This means especially
 _this_ guide.<P>

 I am not responsible for _any_ direct or indirect consequences this
 piece of software involves. No programm(especially not those from a
 strange, bloated, Bill-bugged garage-company with M.S. in the name)
 is 100% bug-free (and surely not this Beta;-&gt; ), so use at your OWN
 risk.
