 ** Thanks to all Beta-Testers in advance for your
    time and trouble ! **<P>

 <a name="link_1"><h2> MOTIVATION</h2><P>

 Finally(!), I have a short break before the last two exams
 and so I decided to release the beta *now*, sothat you can
 see the current stage and tell me what you think about it.<P>

 I will revise some things for the final version, but I did
 not want to make you wait any longer and I want to know if
 it works on other systems at all.:)<P>

 I also want to release the game in the summer, because new
 challenges are waiting for realisation, new ideas come out
 of my head, I want to write an AGA-game finally  and  much
 more...<P>

 Sorry that the game is not AGA, but on the one hand I don't
 really find it necessary to use 256 colours on 14*14-sized
 items, I also wanted the game to work on ANY Amiga, and on
 the other hand: AGA was C='s best kept secret at the time
 MonsterNoia was born...<P>
<P>

 <a name="link_2"><h2>  TODO</h2><P>

 × The gamescreen is 21 points smaller than the screenheight,
   which is bit of a waste, but I can't get the Slices to work
   properly, I always get some unprofessional looking glitches
   when I set the height to maximum... (hope to work this out
   for the next beta), however the PAL/NTSC-support _should_
   work perfectly... (can't try this one out, as Blitz-2, the
   language this beast is programmed in, cannot be fooled to
   believe I have an NTSC-Amiga when I switch the mode to NTSC
   in the Boot-Menu)

 × In Level 2 the sprite is displayed incorrectly after having
   beamed to the second teleport. I am aware of this bug and I
   hope to fix it soon.

 × There are currently only *3* levels, because I had not the time
   to create more... I would be very happy if you could help me
   out with this issue - I am quite creative but I am maybe toooo
   nice and so the levels are somewhat easy I think.. (their main
   purpose was actually to _test_ out the game, not to make people
   addicted to the game;) ).
   So maybe you could do better/MEANER/deadlier;) levels which
   I could include in the final version...:)
   -&gt; see also CONTRIBUTIONS

× This game should run well on Any processor, because it does not
   use dirty wait-loops but only the vertical raster-beam-position
   to synchronise the game. You can try different difficulties if
   you find the game too slow... (Try &quot;Very Hard&quot; (4) to get the
   hyper-flash! This is more a gag to show how fast the game is:) )
   Only thing is the game will run 1/10 sec faster on NTSC-systems,
   but I think that's tolerable...<P>

 × The MonsterNoia.db is a debug-version and has runtime-error-
   checking enabled. This means that it will run not as fast and
   smooth as the normal version, but if you find a strange bug that
   crashes the machine, it would be *Very* helpful if you could tell
   me the runtime-error.

 × ...that's all I remember ATM, I hope I have not forgotten an im-
   portant point;) - if I did, you will surely notice...:-&gt;&gt;<P>

 The LevelED should be 100% tiptop-okay now (I HOPE;) ),but if you
 find any bugs in there, please let me know ...<P>

 <a name="link_3"><h2>  WHAT TO TEST AND WHERE</h2><P>

 MonsterNOIA has been currently tested on the following configurations:<P>

 A1200 - virgin
       - HD (yes, this game is easily HD-installable:) )
       - Blizzard1220/4 (28MHz)
       - Blizzard1230/4 (50MHz)<P>
 A4000/060 (!) - yeah, it works:=)

 This game should even run on an old Amiga500/1MB, because I started
 writing it on that configuration, so it had to;-). However the game
 has undergone some revisions and enhancements, so I am not 100%sure
 if it still works under 1.3/1MB, but I would like to know...:>

 Please test the game (<A href=UserLevel-Info.html>LevelED</A> should be no problem) on as many sys-
 tems as possible, maybe there are only small revisions required to
 make the game work on a specific config...I would like to reach as
 many people as possible:)<P>

 It is not really important that you check which programms you have
 running in the background, because the game will _disable_ multi -
 tasking in the old,dirty, but FAST way and take over the whole Amiga
 for maximum-power;-) (what's wrong with it? Windows does this ALL
 the time :-] Bad thing is it doesn't get faster by doing so ;-]] )<P>

 <a name="link_4"><h2>  CONTRIBUTIONS (LEVELS..!)</h2><P>

 It would be very *nice* if you could create some nice/nasty/
 !HARD!/deadly dangerous levels with the included <A href=UserLevel-Info.html>LevelEditor</A>,
 because ATM there are only *4* levels:(. (I concentrated on
 the game itself and only created levels for _testing_ purposes;) )
 Of course I would gratefully mention you in the final documen-
 tation, so here is your chance for Fame :-9
 You only have to use LevelED and save the levels normally, with
 unique numbers. I can simply put them together in the /Levels-
 drawer, where MonsterNOIA will find them and happily load them
 in.<P>

 <a name="link_5"><h2> NOTICE</h2><P>

 As already mentioned, MonsterNOIA _disables_ multi-tasking when
 running, so PLEASE check that there is NO disk-access or other
 important calculation when you run the game, as this can - as
 you surely know - corrupt your HD,disk or data.
 Almost every game does so, however I thought I'd write that in
 sothat you don't forget..;)
 To minimize chance any problems arise, the game waits 2 secs or
 so before it takes over the machine, so it should be really safe.
 Maybe I put in a requester in the final version, like Psygnosis
 did in their game &quot;Hired Guns&quot;..?
