 The infinite world of ...AmiNET<PRE>
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 From the cover of Aminet-CD 11 (April 1996):<P>

 &quot;Aminet® is the world's largest collection of freely distributable
  Amiga® software. Up to 10,000 users access the vast archives daily,
  and countless programmers publish initially via Aminet®. Only three
  years after its inception, Aminet® now holds the equivalent of more
  than 7,500 floppy disks of software.&quot;<P>

 As you can see with MonsterNOIA, Aminet is really *the* online-source
 for all kind of excellent software ;-)
