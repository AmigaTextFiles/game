 INFORMATION ABOUT THE NEWICONS-SYSTEM by Nicola Salmoria
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Note: this is not an 'official' info about NewIcons, but
       more what I would like to tell you about it.
       If you want specific/technical information please
       check the documentation of NewIcons.<P>
 <A href="#link_1">General info</A>     - important if you don't know NewIcons
 <A href="#link_2">Features</A>         - what it can and why you must have it
 <A href="#link_3">Where you get it</A> - have I made you curious? :-&gt;
 <A href="#link_4">NEWS</A>             - version 3 around the corner...<P>
 <a name="link_1"><B>GENERAL INFO</B><P>
 Most important thing first: This is *NOT* another icon-
 package with cute icons for every possible purpose you
 could imagine, BUT it is a totally _new_ approach wich
 is both *powerful* and easy to use - you won't even no-
 tice that you use NewIcons once it is installed - what
 you WILL notice however is that your icons look *good*
 in every colour-resolution because the colour-data  is
 stored _within_ the icon (actually as 'ToolTypes', but
 you will only see that if you don't have NewIcons  in-
 stalled - yes, that's why some icons have these weird
 characters and a line which says &quot;Don't change ...&quot; ,
 these are *NewIcons* ).<P>
 I think this had to be said, because many people don't
 understand why it is a good idea to use NewIcons, they
 are detracted by the  isometric-styled icons  included
 in the package, but the _Style_ of the icon is TOTALLY
 pointless - you can of course use ANY style, only  the
 *format* has to be NewIcons, sothat you can take advan-
 tage of the many features mentioned below.<P>
 To all MagicWB-freaks out there: Why oh why don't  you
 save your good work as <I>NewIcons</I>?? I don't like the pa-
 lette of MagicWB and I don't want to be bound to  it,
 so all MagicWB-icons look really *crap* on my WB.
 If you used the NewIcons-format, they would  look just
 as you intended them to look, rather than being distor-
 ted and all over pink/blue/green.<P>
 <a name="link_2"><B>FEATURES</B><P>
 * enables you to use icons with up to 256 colours-icons
   and remaps them in real-time  (no overhead noticable)
   -&gt;no more distorted and wrong-coloured icons, but al-
   ways the *original* / best-possible palette. (on AGA-
   systems, you will always have the original colours!)
 * you can simply make a brush into a newicon - imagine
   using digitised pictures as Icons..!
 * works even on Kick 2.04
 * totally _transparent_ - for the user, everything  re-
   mains the same, but gets much more powerful
 * DefIcons-system: part of the NewIcons-package, allows
   you to select default-tools and -icons for files with-
   out icons. Very efficient and FAST, *many*  filetypes
   are recognised.
   You can for example define viewers for GIF-files,....
   which will automagically appear in the  'Execute'-Box
   when you doubleclick the fake-icon.
 * Enables you to change the CrossDOS-icon which  really
   looks a bit too 'peeCee' (DOS-look:( )
 * Unique icons for RAM-Disk, CD-ROMs etc. included.
 * FREE-Ware.  &lt;- propably the best:)<P>
<a name="link_3"><B> WHERE YOU GET IT</B><P>
 I got it from Aminet (also on CD #11), but there should
 be other (disk-based?) sources, too. Please get in con-
 tact with the author / newsgroups if you don't find it.<P>
 <a name="link_4">*NEWS*<P>
 I read there is a version *3* to be out in summer, but I
 don't know anything more precise...
