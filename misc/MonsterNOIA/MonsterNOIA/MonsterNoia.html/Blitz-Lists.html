 The blitzlists: blitz2-list and blitz3-list<PRE>
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The blitzlists discuss everything related to Blitz, and you can
 be sure that someone has an answer to your question if it is re-
 lated to Blitz...
 The blitz3-list is more for experienced people, and the level is
 quite technical (concrete discussions about multiple-plattform-
 support and serious plans, ideas).<P>

 To subscribe, just send a mail to majordomo@helsinki.fi with the
 line &quot;subscribe blitz2-list&quot; or &quot;subscribe blitz3-list&quot;. The sub-
 ject is ignored. I hope I remember the names right; just mail me
 or visit one of the numerous websites if you don't succeed...
