<h2> OVERVIEW </h2><P>

 This is one of those strange games where you view the level from the
 top, but you see everything from the side;-P
 Your mission is to collect the passwordletters lying around and then
 search for the exit (the pink one) to get to the next level. As I am
 not going to make it that easy for you, some cute MONSTERS join your
 quest with the rather nasty intention to _kill_ you.<P>

 In principle, this game reduces the infinity of universe to _three_
 points of interest:<P>

 <A href="#link_i"> &gt;You&lt;</A>
 <A href="#link_ii"> The Monsters</A>
 <A href="#link_iii"> What else is lying around there</A><P>
 <img scr="Pics/You.iff" alt=""><h2> <a name="link_i"> i) YOU<P></h2>
 You are a strange 14*14-pixel-sized bloke in Low-Resolution, with
 blue hair and a green rucksack on the back (wondered what it was?
 hey, I said you should read the docs *first* - now you know :) ).
 You cannot shoot the monsters, but you can walk faster than they
 can and there is also a magic potion to make you invulnerable for
 a short time (but don't loose your head;-) ).  You are also quite
 strong which enables you to move stones.<P>

 <h2> <a name="link_ii"> ii) THE MONSTERS<P></h2>
 These are rather funny wibbling woosels walking around disturbing
 you and sometimes chasing you, depending on the monster-type:
 The green <img src="Pics/Monster1.iff" alt=""> and the yellow ones <img src="Pics/Monster2.iff"> change their direction only
 when a wall or stone is in their way;
 the blue one <img src="Pics/Monster3.iff" alt=""> that looks similar is a bit more interesting:
 it can change it's direction _any_ time, which makes it quite unpredictable.<br>
 The blue 'mammoth'-like monster <img src="Pics/Monster4.iff" alt=""> is the most unpleasant one: it is
 intelligent (well, kind of;-) ) and tries to chase you.<P>
 <h2> <a name="link_iii"> iii) WHAT ELSE IS LYING AROUND THERE<P></h2>
 <img src="Pics/abc.iff" alt="">Passwordletters ....... the most important items lying around and
                         the only way to complete the game(level):
                         They have to be collected  before you can
                         enter the exit.If you have collected them
                         in the right order, you get a bonus:)<P>
 <img src="Pics/Stone.iff" alt="">Stones ................ can be moved or be used to block monsters<P>
 <img src="Pics/Doors.iff" alt="">Doors  ................ can only be opened with the same-coloured
                         keys - only the *grey* one  can be opened
                         with any key<P>
 <img src="Pics/Keys.iff" alt="">Keys   ................ necessary to open the doors- just like in
                         real life;-). The grey key enables you to
                         open _any_ door, but be sure that you use
                         it wise,  or else you might realise later
                         that you  wasted it on a door there was a
                         right-coloured key for:-&gt;<P>
 <img src="Pics/Teleport.iff" alt="">Teleports ............. Since StarTrek the fashion of beaming has
                         become quite popular - teleports beam you
                         just the same way, but only from one tele-
                         port to the other.<P>
 <img src="Pics/ArrowR.iff" alt="">Oneways ............... block the way _back_<P>
 Extras ................ there are some useful extras like Protect,
                         Stop, meat (cannot be collected, but lurs
                         the blue Chase-Monster away from you), but
                         beware:  there are also extras  which have
                         *bad* sight-effects...! (of course I will
                         Not tell you which:-] )<P>
 Boni .................. to brush up your Score:)<P>
 <img src="Pics/Exit.iff" alt="">Exit .................. the last point you have to visit to get to
                         the next level (of course you can only enter
                         if you have collected _all_ password-letters
                         which are scattered over the whole level.
