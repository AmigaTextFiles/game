        *NEW* MonsterNOIA Support-Site, with infos on the latest beta at:
              http://stud1.tuwien.ac.at/~e9425635/MonsterNoia/
              +I intend to make the latest Beta available for download from
               this page, but I have to check this out first...

              Please send me feedback or even a short notice to let me
              know that you tried out my game, and what you think about it.
              Suggestions/comments are always welcome and appreciated,  if
              you want please use &quot;MonsterNoia&quot; as subject, that will make
              things easier for me.<P>

(*) I don't want to boast here, but when I wrote this game, there was nobody<PRE>
    to help me, so I had to do it all alone;-) IMHO it has become quite nice
    *despite* that fact:-)
