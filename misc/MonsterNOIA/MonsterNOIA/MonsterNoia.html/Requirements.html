<PRE>
 This piece of software requires:<P>

 - 1 MB of memory (not sure, though; when I started on my A500/1MB,
   1 MB was enough, but now I have 2+4MB and cannot check this out)
 - Kickstart 1.3 _should_ be sufficient, even for the LevelED, be-
   cause I don't use specific 2.04+-functions, but I cannot verify
   this...(here is where I need your help, fellow Beta-Testers:) )
 - erm..an AMIGA might also come in handy...<P>

 - MonsterNoia/LevelED have <A href=NI-info.html>NewIcons</A>, but you only need NewIcons if
   you want to be able to display these nice icons,  if NewIcons is
   not installed, you will not even notice, but just see normal WB-
   icons (also special, nicely drawn icons:) ).
 - AGA is not needed, but of course speeds up the game,same is true
   for FAST-mem.
