<H1>Information on BlitzBasic II</H1>
<HR>
<PRE>
 First of all I want to say I get nothing paid for this, and  if
 you are annoyed by this, please skip this section, as I do  not
 intend to annoy people.<P>
 If however you are curious about the language this game was pro-
 grammed in, and in general how you can get the most out of your
 Amiga with justifiable effort, then  this section is for *you*,
 and I hope you will find it interesting and informative to read.<P>
 For the quick/impatient readers;-) the contents of this page:<P>

 <h2><a name="link_1">WHAT IS BLITZBASIC ][ ?</h2>(current version: 2.1)
 BlitzBasic-2 is a powerful language which allows you to unleash
 the *full* power of your Amiga with a comfort otherwise only in
 BASIC-languages.<P>
 However Blitz is _not_ another Basic-language, but has combined
 many popular features of other languages like PASCAL,C and even
 Assembler.<P>
 This means you can use structs (Records) - allowing you to pro-
 gramm the Amiga-OS in its natural way, as  Blitz-Programms are
 fully OS-compatible.<P>
 You work in a fully integrated environment which means that you
 can access the compiler and the debugger from within the editor
 at the click of a button.<P>
 There are several aspects that even taken seperately make Blitz
 superior to other languages which try to pretend the same power,
 but alltogether make Blitz-2 unique and brilliant,ideal for the
 beginner _and_ the experienced user alike.<P>
 <h2><a name="link_2">The (T)Editor</h2> (SuperTED or TED 2.1)
 - mouseable labels: you can specify labels by simply  putting a
   dot at the beginning of the line. These labels then appear in
   a column on the right margin of the screen  and can be easily
   accessed by the mouse.
 - Blitz-commands are highlighted during typing
 - the font can be changed by the user
 - *ONLINE-Help*, either a short syntax-description (HELP-key) in
   the titlebar or a full documentation with examples.
 - quick save-format which also saves diskspace
 - defined Structures can be easily viewed in a seperate window
   (called &quot;NewTypes&quot; in Blitz, see below)
 - it has been thoroughly revised in the past and a severe upgrade
   should be out soon (featuring _multiple_ documents, ARexx,...)<P>
 <h2><a name="link_3">The Language Itself</h2>
 - at first it seems a bit strange: standard BASIC-commands (Dim,
   Print, For, While,...) and then suddenly *structures* (Newtypes),
   ASM-commands (can be used *within* normal Blitz-code, for example
   for Interrupts, Copper-programming and the like!), and other heavy
   stuff - but you soon find out the concept and how !powerful! it is.
   Once you get used to it, you will never look back again!
 - beside the normal Basic-commands, which are slightly enhanced over
   the traditional ones, you have *special commands* for Graphics and
   Sound (fast Blitting, playing samples, Bitmap-operations, loading
   and showing pictures, animations,...) - all with FULL AGA-support!
 - several commands to work _with_ the Amiga-OS (not against or beside
   it, as in other underdeveloped languages!) to create Windows, Gad-
   gets, Screens, Menus, Requesters (full gadtools-support)
 - this means you have an ideal language for *both* games AND serious
   applications
 - standard-library-system, which means that you can use every library
   from within Blitz in the same way as normal Blitz-commands.
 - there are loads of libraries available (most on Aminet) which make
   Blitz even more powerful and/or easy to use.
 - ...just get the demo on Aminet to see what I am talking about!
   (one demo says more than 1000 words:) )
 - you won't believe me anyway, so why not try it out yourself?<P>
 <h2><a name="link_4">The Debugger</h2> (by Leading Edge Software, now known as &quot;Red When Excited&quot;)
 - easy to use, but yet powerful Source-Level-Debugger, which means you
   can browse through the source while it is executed and see what your
   programm exactly does.
 - has saved my Amiga from a crash maybe more than 1,000,000 times ;-)
 - Variables can be inspected and traced
 - Structures can be inspected thoroughly
 - another major update is to be released<P>
 <h2><a name="link_5">Support</h2> (now gaining vitality again...:-] )
 - there is the BUM (Blitz User Magazine), including a newsletter and  in
   most cases serious updates with interesting examples and contributions
   from Blitz-Users worldwide
 - there is much support on the WEB, some Blitz-Experts have done a  very
   good job on documenting the Amiga's internal life and how to access it
   from within Blitz, two out of many addresses are mentioned below:
   <a href=http://sun1.bham.ac.uk/cca93057>UK-Site</a>
   <a href=http://www.pinsight.com/~josh>Another tip</a>
 - there is an own newsgroup for Blitz2-users worldwide: <A href=Blitz-Lists.html>the blitzlist</A>
 - many PD-games on <A href=Aminet.html>Aminet</A> show you just what you can do with Blitz-2 and
   often the source is available for deeper investigation...<P>
   (BTW: MonsterNoia/LevelED-source is also available! _Well_ documented,
   in English -&gt; see <A href=Source.html>&gt;&gt;here&lt;&lt;</A> )<P>
 <h2><a name="link_6">The Future - Blitz-3</h2>
 - There are plans to upgrade Blitz to support multiple platforms such as
   WinDos and the PowerPC, which would be quite a revolutionary move into
   the right direction and *very* interesting news for professional game-
   developers worldwide.
 - These plans are discussed in an own <A href=Blitz-Lists.html>newsgroup</A>, with much participation
   from Blitz-Experts and Mark Sibly himself, the creator of Blitz.
 - Remember: this is all still future, but it looks very promising...
