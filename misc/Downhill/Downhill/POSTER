I added the MakeAssigns icon to allow xicon to be used from workbench

Title:    DOWNHILL CHALLENGE: A SKIING ARCADE GAME
Keywords: DOWNHILL CHALLENGE SKIING SPORTS ARCADE FUN JOYSTICK
-----

Skylar Mountain.
Dangerous.  Steep.  Downright scarey.
You were made for this mountain.
Ski like the wind, picking up bonus flags as you go.  Jump over rocks,
branches, and bushes for extra points.  Avoid hitting obstacles -- you
can only fall five times before you are disqualified.
The longer you stay up, the faster you ski and the more points you get
as you travel.  Bonus flags are worth 5,000 points each AFTER you reach
the Finish Line.

You start the game at the top of Skylar Mountain.  After the starter says
"GO", the game begins.  Control is employed through a joystick (in port
2).  Moving the joystick left or right moves the skier in the same
directions.  Pressing the joystick button causes the skier to jump (over
obstacles like bushes, logs and rocks).
The object of the game is to get to the finish line without being
disqualified.  Falling 5 times results in disqualification.

Notes: 1. Either put this game on a floppy and name the disk
       "Downhill_challenge" (no quotes of course) or unpack it to
       RAM: or VD0: or a hard drive and assign downhill_challenge:
       to whever you put its parts.
       2. Joystick required in port 2.

Excellent graphics and sound in this nifty little game. Have fun.
