              © @{b}Douglas Adams@{ub}. I don't have to tell you
              what it is, except it's a good book.

              I hope you'll enjoy the game, even that the computer
              opponents are pretty stupid, and I like to thank
              again the Mikro BITTI - team for announcing such
              a good competition, which made us regular coders
              to sharp up a bit and do something that would
              amuse the big public. And not to mention the @{"CD-I" link "CD-I"}
              player, which was the compo's main price.

              BTW: This version (1.01) is a minor update to the v1.0.
              Just fixed few bugs and speeded up the CPU-player.

              Ok. You've got this L-like block, which you must
              move, flip or rotate in every round. If you cannot do
              it, then you've just lost the game.
              After moving, you have the change to move one of the
              two skull-blocks.
              You cannot move your L-block if there's some other
              block blocking your L-block's way. Got it?
              Your goal is to block your enemy's block so that
              he or she cannot move, flip or rotate it anymore.

              Oh yes, Günter's block is purple and Amadeus' block
              is blue.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


              The game is so well programmed that if you don't like
              the tekno-tune, you can replace it.
              @{b}Just copy your favourite ProTracker tune to L-Game
              directory and rename it to MainTune.
              Remember to rename the old tune to something else.@{ub}

              If that's too much for you, you can use any music player
              that is CIA-timed in the background before starting
              the game. I myself like to listen to the PlaySID modules.
              Thanks to @{b}Per Håkan Sundell and Ron Birk@{ub} for that.
              Remember to press the music off when you are using
              another player, 'cause when there are two players playing
              at the same time, the noise is unbearable.

              If you don't like music, just delete or rename the
              @{b}MainTune@{ub} file. The game won't show you
              that floating note, when you have succeeded.

              Pretty nice, eh?

         First of all, I'd like to thank @{"MikroBITTI" link MikroBITTI}-magazine
         and it's staff for giving us, the public, the idea of making
         this L-Game. It's just a shame that most of the columns in
         @{b}MikroBITTI@{ub} are for PC-users, but hey! At least I'll
         get good laughs when reading stories from those who chant
         their @{"Windoze" link Sucks} mantra every night.
         And big thanks to @{b}Morten Eriksen@{ub} who made this all possible
         with his excellent PicCon - picture converter.
