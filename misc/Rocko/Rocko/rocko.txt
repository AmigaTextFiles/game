The code for Rocko is freely redistributable.

This was my first AMOS game. Finished most of it in one afternoon. There's
a lot to be said for novice programmers being unambitious in their efforts.
It allows us to actually finish things.

I colorized the pictures and added a keyboard option today. The colors help
a lot, and I know there are a few people (like me) who like to look like
grownups without ye olde joystick sitting on the desk, so the keyboard
option is for us. The joystick is funner though, go figure.

I realized today, heh, that I never uploaded this thing where more than two
people could get it. So today I plan to offer it to the world via Aminet.
In that global spirit, I expanded the visible screen to about 240 horizontal
rows to make it more, er, palatable to the amiga's best friends, the
europeans.

I gauged the speed settings as best I could. On a faster Amiga... who
knows? You can adjust the "roundtime"variable if you have AMOS. Improve or
replace the pictures if you want.

Let me know if you like _Rocko_
