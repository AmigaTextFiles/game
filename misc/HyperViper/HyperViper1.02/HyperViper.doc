   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Any amiga.


   Installation

   choice (if you delete the Viper-TopScores file, the top scores table will
   be cleared).

   HyperViper is accompanied by two sets of rounds. If you want to play the
   first one, you have to copy the file 'Viper-Rounds.1' as 'Viper-Rounds'

   you have to copy the file 'Viper-Rounds.2' instead.

   This is the GIFTWARE version of the game (it does not include the round
   editor), therefore it is freely distributable on condition that it is
   always accompanied by all the files in this archive. The whole archive
   must not be modified in any way. If you like and play it, you could send
   me a gift of any kind. Blank disks, CD's, postcards or E-mail messages
   would be appreciated.
   In case you want to obtain the full version of the game and create your
   own rounds, you should send me 15,000 italian lire (use a postal order or
   simply put the money in an envelope). Remember to specify your name and
   address (included E-mail if you have one).
