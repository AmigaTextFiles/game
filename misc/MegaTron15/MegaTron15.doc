Mega Tron V1.5. Date: 30-Mar-96.
Written by Chris Hodges using AMOS Professional.

Information
~~~~~~~~~~~
I am not in any way resonsible for loss of data, loss of sanity, loss of IQ
and the possiblity of becoming adicted ;-)
Since this game is Shareware the price for this disk must not exceed the cost
for disk and postage.
This document must be distrubuted along with the Mega Tron program.
Mega Tron and this document must not be altered in any way (excluding spelling
mistakes!) without written permission.

The Game
~~~~~~~~
You certainly have seen the movie TRON by Walt Disney. This is another
conversion of the film. You steer one of these rasterbikes and have to kill
the other players by jamming them and forcing them into a wall. To make this
easier you (and the opponents) have got access to three weapons from an
arsenal of nine. Like in real life nothing is for free. Although the weapons
ammonition is unlimited, all of them cost an amount of money (from 2-1000
credits). You earn money if you simply stay alive or if you kill a player you
get 500 credits and the score is increased by one. If you have exterminated
all opponents you will enter the next round with now more 1000 credits in your
pockets and two bonus points.

The Controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mega Tron can be played with an maximum of ten players, of whom seven may be
controlled individually by humans using four joysticks and three key sets.
By default one human player using joystick 1 and nine computers are turned on.
Joystick 3 and 4 require a Four-player-adapter plugged in the parallel port.
To change the input device for each player go into the 'Player options menu',
select the player you want to modify and move the stick to left or right until
you are satisfied with your settings. To activate one of the three weapons you
have to use special keys. These are the defaults:

Action| Joystick 1  | Joystick 2  | Keys set 1  | Keys set 2  | Keys set 3  |
------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
Left  | joy 1 left  | joy 2 left  | curs left   | keypad 4    | y           |
Right | joy 1 right | joy 2 right | curs right  | keypad 6    | x           |
Up    | joy 1 up    | joy 2 up    | curs up     | keypad 8    | q           |
Down  | joy 1 down  | joy 2 down  | curs down   | keypad 2    | a           |
Weap1 | joy 1 fire  | joy 2 fire  | delete      | keypad 5    | space       |
Weap2 | right alt   | left alt    | help        | enter       | tab         |
Weap3 | right amiga | left amiga  | backspace   | keypad -    | ctrl        |
------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+

The keys can be altered in the 'Redefine keys'-menu. Select the key set you
want to modify then press the relevant keys or 'ESCape' to keep the key.
When altering the joystick you may only change the weapon keys.

Note: Due to four player adapter support any other equipment on the parallel
      port (e.g printers) have to be unplugged before you can use this option.
      Since V1.41 you can disable the 4 player adapter using a special tool
      type, so you don't need to unplug your printer. With V1.5, this tool
      type is entered in the icon by default. Remove it, if you want to use
      a four player adapter.

Note: Since V1.4 there is a CD32 game pad support. However, the
      lowlevel.library is required to enable this feature. Due to copyright
      reasons, I cannot include this library (it's part of Kick 3.1).
      Two button joysticks however, can be used without the lowlevel.library.

The Weapons
~~~~~~~~~~~
There's a total of nine weapons and tools you can choose of. Some are directed
at you, some have effects on a randomly picked opponent. Here's a list:

None     (   0): As you might think this 'weapon' does nothing.
Speed Up (   2): Doubles your speed until you change your direction. Driving
		 with double speed won't give you any money. The line is
		 continious, so there's no possibility to drive through.
		 Before V1.5, 'Speed Up' was in reality 'Jumpspeed'.
Imploder ( 250): Clears a small area around your rasterbike. Use this to break
		 through walls.
Tunnel   ( 500): Creates two parallel lines to force the player in some sort
		 of tunnel, in which he shouldn't change his direction or he
		 is dead.
Autopilot( 300): Turns the automatic computer steering on for about 250 moves.
		 Your line will now turn white! Use it to minimize the space
		 used when driving in narrow areas.
Boxes    ( 600): Draws four boxes at an opponent. When he gets a shock and
		 turns, it's very likely that he will crash.
Circle   ( 750): Creates a large circle round an opponent. The only way to
		 escape this rather small area is to use imploders, rockets or
		 a shield.
Rockets  ( 500): Fires a homing missile which aims at an opponent. Rockets can
		 pass through your lines, but not at those of other players.
		 When hitting a line, the rockets explodes, hopefully
		 terminating an opponent. Rockets only have fuel for about 150
		 moves, and a run out will cause the rocket to explode. This
		 seems to be the most powerful weapon, handle it with care.
Shield   (1000): Clears anything that gets before you creating a narrow
		 corridor. This tool is time limited to 250 moves, during this
		 period your color turns white.
Teleport ( 250): Hence the name, this tool will teleport you to a random
		 location. Can be used to escape certain situations, but be
		 warned: react fast, once you have been teleported or you
		 might find yourself dead very soon.
Jumpspeed(   2): Like Speed Up, but draws a corrupted line. In fact, only every
		 second will be drawn.
Eater    ( 500): Starts a small pacman type of missle. Once it finds the line
		 of an enemy, it begins to follow it until it reaches the end
		 and then explodes. Powerful weapon! Use with care.
Freeze   ( 250): Stops your movement for a few seconds. Handy, if you want to
		 wait for the other players to die.

Erm... and before I forget it, the value in brackets represents the amount of
credits the specific weapon costs, and if you haven't got enough credits, you
cannot buy the weapons.

Before you start the game there are many options you can alter.
The main menu contains:

		       game.

The game options menu:

Computer intelligence: Set this according to your own IQ (=low? ;-) ).

		       time during the game.

		       the 'Generate scenario' bar (?).

		       scenario. Do not forget to alter the controls!
Computers            : Controls the amount of computers that play in the next
		       game when clicked on 'Generate scenario'.
Generate scenario    : Finally, this generates a special scenario according to
		       the settings above.

Mega Tron external Controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mega Tron can be configured using the command line entered from CLI or by
setting Tool Types in the 'MegaTron'-icon.
For both CLI and Tool Types the keywords are the same:

'CloseWorkbench' : Tries to close the Workbench Screen in order to grab some
		   memory.
'NoMusic'        : Maybe the best of all options! Turns off the music once and
		   forever. Note: This option frees about 36KB of memory but
		   the music cannot be turned on in the 'Game options menu'
		   any longer.
'NoSound'        : Disables the sound effects. Frees about 60KB.
'SkipTitle'      : Skips the intro screen.
'Load'           : Loads the old settings directly when entering the main menu.
'Music="name"'   : Special feature! Since my music sounds awful, you have the
		   oppotunity to load an other into the game. The music has to
		   be NoiseTracker or ProTracker type.
'50Hz'           : Will switch to 50 Hz PAL mode. Probably you prefer this.
'60Hz'           : Switches to 60Hz NTSC mode.
'DisableLowLevel': Disables the checking of the joystick as a gamepad. It has
		   shown, that the library as some problems with normal
		   joysticks from time to time.
'Disable4Player' : Disables the four player adapter support. This switch must
		   be used if you have connected a printer to your parallel
		   port.
'Players=n'      : Sets the maximum of players to n. n may range from 2 to 10.
		   Default setting is 10.
'Explosions=n'   : Sets the maximum of explosions to n. n may range from 2
		   to 20. Default is 10.
'Rockets=n'      : Sets the maximum of rockets that can fly at the same time to
		   n. Default is 10.

Mega Tron usually requires 1MB of ram. If you only have 512KB then buy an
expansion or try the tool types 'CloseWorkbench', 'SkipTitle', 'NoMusic' and
'NoSound' until it works.
