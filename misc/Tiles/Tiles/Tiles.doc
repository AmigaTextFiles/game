                             Tiles!                               8/6/89

   Tiles! is your basic no-frills Shanghai-type game.  A board is covered
with a set of 144 tiles, 36 different suits of 4 identical tiles, each with
a picture on it.  The object is to remove all the tiles, 2 at a time, by
matching pairs of identical tiles.  Select one tile and it becomes
hilighted.  Select another matching tile and they both are removed from the
board.  The catch is that you can only select tiles which are on the end of
horizontal rows.  Some rows are on top of other rows, but you can match
tiles on different levels.  You select tiles by... Oh, you can figure that
out. :-)

   Less obvious is that selecting a tile a second time deselects that tile.
Selecting an unplayable tile deselects any selected tile. Selecting another
playable tile that doesn't match the currently selected one makes this new
tile the selected tile.  (Whew!  The words are more confusing than the
game, believe me.)  Selecting no tile (the background) will also deselect
the selected tile if there is one.  If not, it unplays your last move.  You
could back up as far as you like just by clicking on the background, but if
you do back up you can't really call it a win when all the tiles are gone.

   Every board can be solved.  Really.  The game could live on a hard disk
with no problems:-)  It should get along with other programs quite well.
And I want to make it clear that I didn't intend to rip off any commercial
programs.  I had the game completed before I knew about any commercial
offerings for the Amiga.  I must admit that it is, in fact, a rip-off of
the game GunShy for the Mac.  My heart sank as I walked into my dealer's
show room, disk in hand, ready to share my gift with the world, and saw the
commercial program running on one of the display machines.

   But I got over that soon enough.  Please feel free to give this program
to all your friends.  And of course, I am open to comments, suggestions,

(Modula-2 code for the Menu and Requester came from Richie Bielak's program
"Trails" on Fred Fish Disk #32.  Thanks Richie!   An early version of
Tiles! was included on the October, 1988 JumpDisk.)
