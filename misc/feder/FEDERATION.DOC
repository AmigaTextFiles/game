1. INTRO

It's the year 3600 and you have just graduated from the military academy.
You've been given a starship, $5000 and a set of instructions.......
kill as many criminals as possible.

The Galactic Federation are trying to eliminate various rebel groups who are
are terrorising the people. There are four enemies of the Federation;
Pirates, the Mafia, the Saltire and an alien race, the Nodrogs.

The Federation and the Nodrogs currently have a peace treaty but that
doesn't mean your bosses discourage dogfights with the aliens. They just
don't publicise it.

The Federation don't pay for you, your ship or any expenses. They only pay
for the execution of their enemies.
So if you want to succeed, you will have to kill.

Your aim is to make as much money as possible, have an "Ultimate" combat
rating, be promoted to "Rear-Admiral" of the Federation and kill as many
rebels as possible.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. MENU

After loading the game you will be presented with the main menu.
The choices are:

                                A. START GAME
                                B. LOAD GAME
                                C. CREDITS
                                D. QUIT

2a. START GAME

This will take you to the graduation screen. You will be asked to enter
your name and the name of your ship. Then you will be asked to accept these
details or to change them.
If you accept you will then goto the Federation HQ space station orbiting
Earth. You are now ready to fly.


2b. LOAD GAME

If you have previously saved a game you can load the data and start from
where you left off.


2c. CREDITS

Take a look and see.


2d. QUIT

Takes you back to Workbench.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. STATION MENU

While docked at any space station you will have the following choice.

                              A. LEAVE STATION
                              B. NEWS
                              C. UPGRADES
                              D. MARKET
                              E. MILITARY
                              F. BULLETIN BOARD
                              G. SAVE POSITION
                              H. VIEW STARMAP

3a. LEAVE STATION

Lets you leave the station ready to fly to your next destination.


3b. NEWS

Depending on which station your at, you can read the latest news.
If your in Federation space you will hear their side of recent events such
as attacks by rebel or alien groups, or warnings of rebel activity in
particular star systems.

If your in Nodrog space you will hear their side of the story such as
unprovoked attacks by the Federation, or their attempts at trying to donate
items to the Federation.
You may even see your own name mentioned here if you've upset the Nodrogs
too many times.


3c. UPGRADES

If you have enough cash you can upgrade your ship with items like a bigger
cargo bay, fuel tank or a faster hyperdrive. Also there are combat and
defense upgrades such as stronger lasers, missiles, energy bombs and
shield boosters.
These are neccessary if you want to survive.


3d. MARKET

An essential stopping point at every station. The best way to make money is
to trade. Some systems import certain items while others export them.
So there is a good chance of making some serious cash.


3e. MILITARY

Again, depending on which station your at you will either meet the Federation
or the Nodrog Empire.
If it's the Nodrogs then they will ask you to leave and take a message to
the Federation. It isn't normally a nice message.

If you're in Federation space then you will be offered a mission.
The missions depend on your rank and experience. Initially, the missions
will be quite easy. They will always involve destroying rebel ships.
The first few missions will be to destroy up to 3 Pirate ships in various
systems. You will then progress to the Mafia, Saltire and eventually
the Nodrogs.
The Federation will tell you which system to travel to. Once there you
should be attacked by the rebels. They hang around the edge of the system
waiting for ships to arrive. Once destroyed, you will receive a message
from the Federation and payment.

The ships you will encounter will be quite easy to destroy but as you
progress you will come up against some tough ships so you will have to
spend your earnings on some decent combat equipment.

If you can't handle your current mission then goto the the Federation again,
you will be given the choice to keep going or abort.
It's up to you but the Federation only want fighters, not cowards.


3f. BULLETIN BOARD

This is another easy way to make some cash.

Now that the human race has spread through the galaxy it can take a while
for something to be delivered.
It's not a simple case of slapping a 1st class stamp on a parcel anymore.

People are still ordering items through mail order and are prepared to pay
some serious cash to get them.
The Universal Mail Co. rely on passing ships to deliver these items.
Payment depends on the distance of the system it's being sent to.

There will be a choice of five deliveries. Selecting any one of them will
tell you the location, the receiver and the item that is being delivered.
If you are going that way, press accept and the parcel is now yours.
Payment will be made once you arrive at any station in that system.
Once accepted, you will be taken back to the options. The one you have
accepted will now state "DELIVERY SECURED".

You can carry a maximum of three packages at any one time.


3g. SAVE POSITION

If it's late and your getting tired, select this option and choose a file
name. The data will be saved to enable you to continue another time.


3h. VIEW STARMAP

To see a map of the explored galaxy, press the mouse button on the large
window of the space station.

To use the map, move the mouse to the bottom of the screen. The map will
now scroll down. To scroll up, move the mouse to the top. Easy, eh!
A ring of dots will show which system you are currently in.

If the mouse moves over a star, the pointer will change. Pressing the right
mouse button on any star will show you a map of that system.

To exit the system map or the starmap, press either mouse button.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. STARTING UP

Now that you have arrived at the Federation HQ space station, you are ready
to begin. You have $5000 to spend as you want but it probably won't be enough
to buy what you really need.
First of all you will need to buy some fuel from the station market.
Initially you can carry up to 15t of fuel which will be enough to get you to
a few of the nearest star systems. You can also carry up to 15t of cargo.
The cargo bay and the fuel tank can be expanded. These are available at
the stations upgrades section.

After stocking up on fuel, check out the Federation to see what mission
they have for you.
If you think you can handle it, accept the mission. Then goto the Bulletin
Board to see if there are any packages to be delivered to the system you're
heading to or even any systems that are near it.
Use the starmap to plan your route and read the description of the systems.
There are a few clues in the description as to what goes on and the imports/
exports.
For instance, if it is a mining colony then it will be a good chance they
will import machinery. If you have the cash and the space, buy a few tonnes
and take a chance. You never know.

Once your ready, select leave station and prepare for battle.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. THE COCKPIT

After leaving the station, you take control of your starship.
The top half of the screen is the cockpit window. The bottom half has the
controls.

                               A. SHIELDS
                               B. WEAPONS
                               C. SHIP
                               D. CAREER
                               E. MISSION
                               F. DATE
                               G. LOCAL MAP
                               H. STARMAP
                               I. HYPERWARP
                               J. DESTINATION

5a. SHIELDS

To the right od the controls, your shield strength will be shown. This starts
at 100% or higher depending on any boosters you may have.
This will be reduced in battle, so keep an eye on it. Once it gets to about
20% you had better get out of there.
To re-charge your shields, dock at any Federation space station.
They will automatically be re-charged.  


5b. WEAPONS

You can have up to three weapons, the laser, missiles and energy bomb.
When the mouse pointer is at the top half of the screen it will change to
the cross-hair to enable you to target enemy ships. Pressing the left mouse
button will fire the laser. The right mouse button will fire any missiles
you have.
If you have any missiles, they will be shown at the bottom left of the
cockpit.

To use the energy bomb, press the mouse button on the large blue star shaped
panel which is situated at the centre of the bottom half of the cockpit.
The engines will power up from red to yellow and release the bomb.
This sends out an energy wave, damaging any ships in the close vicinity.


5c. SHIP

This displays the equipment currently in use on your ship such as the
combat equipment, drive, cargo bay and fuel tank.
It will also show any cargo currently held.


5d. CAREER

This will show how well you're doing in the game. It displays;
Your rank, cash earned, years & months service, missions completed, total
amount of ships destoyed with individual amounts for the four enemies
and will also tell you your current combat rating.


5e. MISSION

If you forget were your going then look here. This will tell you who you
are after, where they are, how many there are and the payment on success.

It will also give the same details for any packages you have agreed to
deliver.


5f. DATE

Completely useless in space but relative to existence.


5g. LOCAL MAP

This is the map of the current system. Once selected, you can select any
of the space stations. You will then automatically head for that station.
After a while you will arrive at your destination and automatically dock
at the station. The time involved in travelling will depend upon the
number of enemy ships you encounter. Normally, it should take no longer
than a minute.


5h. STAR MAP

If you want to jump to another system then select this option.
It gives you a map of the occupied galaxy. Use the mouse to move the map up
and down by moving the pointer to the top and bottom of the screen.
A dotted ring will show your current system.
Once the mouse is on a star it will change to the cross-hair.

Pressing the left mouse button will select this star system and the dotted
ring will now surround the star.

Pressing the right mouse button will show the system map and give a
description. It will also tell you how much fuel is required to jump.

To get back to the cockpit, make sure the mouse is not on a star and press
either mouse button.
You will now be able to jump to the new system by selecting Hyperwarp.


5i. HYPERWARP

If you have selected a new system and have enough fuel, then you will jump
to the new system.


5j. DESTINATION

This will show where you're heading. If you have selected a space station to
fly to, then it will tell you which one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. THE ENEMY

As mentioned before, there are four enemies of the Federation.
These are:

                               A. PIRATES
                               B. MAFIA
                               C. SALTIRE
                               D. NODROGS

6a. PIRATES

When you meet these chaps your monitor will show a skull and cross-bones.
Their ships are usually dull colours like grey and brown.
They are very common and you will meet them in most systems.
Usually they fly around in goups to maximise thier profit but now and
again some go alone.


6b. MAFIA

These folk are a bit more selective about the sytems they visit. They won't
go anywhere near Nodrog space but you will meet them everywhewre else.
Their call sign is a dark skull with blue eyes.
As with the Pirates, they have dull coloured ships. Their base is rumoured
to be the Procyon system so it would be advisable to avoid that area unless
you have some decent weapons.


6c. SALTIRE

This rebel group operate as a seperate race although they are human.
Their call sign is a white cross on a blue background,
No-one is sure why this is as no-one knows who they are or where they are
based.
They frequent the systems in the middle of the map but rarely venture into
Nodrog space. Their ships are only one colour. Blue.
There are rumours of an unmapped star sytem which the Saltire use as their
base but, as said before, no-one has any idea where it is.


6d. NODROGS

The Nodrogs occupy the last eight sytems at the top of the map. The homeworld
is Nodrog at the top-right of the map. Their logo is a golden "Z" with a
gold circle at either side.
They are not too fond of humans and often send insulting messages to their
targets.
The colour of their ships vary from orange, yellow, red and green. Often
they will mix a few colours.
You will not meet any Nodrogs unless you venture into their space. There are
reports of raids by the Nodrogs into Federation space but this is denied by
the Empire.


When engaged in combat, you should be able to tell how strong the enemy are
by the colour of the laser fire. The weakest is red with the strongest
being white. Usually, the ships shield strength is consistent with their
laser power. It's common sense really. Why bother spending so much money
on a strong laser if you don't strengthen your defense.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUYING & SELLING

If you want to buy an upgrade and you already have an earlier model, you will
have to sell it first. Unless it is the basic model which comes with the
ship.

Also, if you want to sell your cargo bay and have it stocked up with cargo
und other upgrades, you will have to sell a few things.
The same applies to the fuel tank. If you have 30t of fuel you can't sell
it until you sell enough fuel.
It's logical, really it is!
