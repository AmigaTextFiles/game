OPERATION : ARMAGEDDON

                      - - T O P   S E C R E T - -
     (Classified personnel ONLY)

Recent long range scans of the neutral zone indicate lower then usual Veratrine 
activity. Although according to recently signed treaty it is illegal for us and the 
Verterians to enter the neutral zone without each other's approval but there was an 
unspoken agreement allowing limited access of both parties to that economically 
important region of space. Depletion in their trading activities seem to confirm the 
rumours of political rest
within the empire and creates a unique opportunity for our forces to finally break 
up the empire and restore the balance of power in the galaxy. Central Command has 
already send 2nd and 5th Assault division to outpost 325 as well as 10th marine 
group 
to starbase 754. Olgoron, a 5th planet of the Alpha Centauri system will be used as 
intelligence centre for operations. Nearby Nebula will act as an effective 
camouflage 
and protection against Verterian long range scanners. Since you are one of the most 
promising pilots in the fleet you are being send to Battle cruiser Defiance which 
currently is stationed at the edge of the neutral zone. After arriving at Defiance 
you will serve under command of Admiral George D. Orwell who is distinguished member 
of Starfleet
command. Remember, the very existence of our civilization depends on this one so we 
have to win it and may the force be with you, always.

During the course of your mission you'll be flying various crafts but they all share 
common controls. Rightmost radar shows what's behind you while leftmost is used for 
tracking objects infront front of you. Here is a summary of keys

S - Causes a distortion is space-time continuum by releasing  by releasing large 
amount of energy and effectively places you in a slight different position.

H - Activates hyperdrive and transports you to the next waypoint.

L - Locks onto a target.

M - Show a map and most importantly shows a number of enemy ships in sup space. 
Remember you have to destroy all ships before proceeding to next waypoint.

+/- - Sets the speed of the craft. 
                           
ESC - Ejects you from your ship.

The rest of displays are rather self explanatory and they include shield and laser 
display, enemy status (when lock is activated).
