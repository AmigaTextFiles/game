******************************************************************************

This game is written in AMOS using version 1.36. All modules are in
tracker format. 
It should run about 50Hz on all machines.

Please contact me with any bug reports, or if you just happen to download
it, as I like to keep track of the distribution of my software. Or if
you have any good ideas for projects.

Also, the file MegaBomberV0.1 was just a beta type, not the full game which
should be avalible quite soon.

To all those people who got hold of the faulty version of the Rubber
archive, if you`ve still got it or should be unlucky enough to find one
then,

      Create a directory  m  in the same directory as the main executable

   and move the following files into it :

         1,2,3,4,5,6,D,H,H2,

   and the the game should run normally.
