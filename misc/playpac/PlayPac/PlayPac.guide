@NODE "INTRODUCTION" "Introduction"
@TOC "MAIN"

    PlayPac is a pacman clone which I started to write because I wanted to learn 
  how to program my Amiga. At the first it was supposed to be just a simple
  project but, thanks to people who has sent mail to me, I've decided to keep
  the project going on and on. 
@ENDNODE

@NODE "REQUIREMENTS" "System requirements"
@TOC "MAIN"

    PlayPac needs WB 3.0. The amount of required diskspace/memory depends on
  graphics/sound data and screenmode you use.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "INSTALLATION" "Installation"
@TOC "MAIN"

    Just double-click PlayPac.install icon and follow instructions.

    @{i}To testplay PlayPac before installing it double-click Test icon.@{ui}
@ENDNODE

@NODE "SETTINGS" "Settings"
@TOC "MAIN"

    You can configure many aspects of PlayPac from the Settings window. It is
  possible to change the size of maze, add tunnels to maze, set number of 
  pacs/ghosts, turn blackouts on/off, select game's speed...
  
  Here is the list of gadgets and their functions:


  Maze width/height ... Changes the size of maze (max.16*16) note that you 
                        can't have bigger maze than screen

  Lives ............... Sets the number of pacs
  
  Ghosts .............. Sets the number of ghosts

  Next bonus .......... Sets the amount of pills required for bonus

  Add ghost ........... Sets how often new ghost appears

  Speed ............... Sets the speed of game.

  Ghost aggr .......... Sets the aggressiveness of ghosts

  Control ............. Control for Player 1

  Tunnels ............. If on, game adds tunnels to maze whenever it is possible

  Blackouts ........... If on, walls will turn to black if you stay too long in
                        a same level

  Autoshield .......... If on, Pac's shield is automatically activated whenever
                        needed

  Autostart ........... If on, game starts right away else use keys/joystick to
                        select pac's direction and press space/button to start
                        playing

  Buffer CTRL ......... If on, pac remembers the latest direction he was supposed
                        to turn and he'll try to turn to that direction in the next 
                        corner. Otherwise pac turns from corner only if he is 
                        told to do so @{i}at the same time@{ui} he comes to the corner.
                        
  Fixed speed ......... If on, pac's movement is fixed to an integer.

  Save scores ......... If on, game saves scores on the disk

@NODE "TOOLTYPES" "Tooltypes"
@TOC "MAIN"

  All tooltypes are optional.

    SCREENMODEFILE = <filename> , default is PlayPac.screenmode

    SCORESFILE = <filename> , default is PlayPac.scores

    SETTINGSFILE = <filename> , default is PlayPac.settings
@ENDNODE

@NODE "CLIUSAGE" "Usage from CLI"
@TOC "MAIN"

    PlayPac is not designed to be launched from CLI. However, it is possible to 
  start the game from CLI but with some limitations. Currently PlayPac accepts 
  only INITFILE parameter, which is optional so you can start the game simply 
  typing 'PlayPac'. Note that if you use the original init files you must make
  PlayPac's directory the current directory.

    Template:  PlayPac INITFILE


    Example:   cd Work:Games/PlayPac/
               PlayPac Lores16.init

@ENDNODE

@NODE "INITFILE" "Init file"
@TOC "MAIN"

    @{i}Init file@{ui} is a file the game reads on the startup and initializes all sound/
  graphic/message data in the way specified in it. The easiest way to create 
  init file of your own is to make a copy of 'Lores16.init' file and then edit it. 
  


  Pac & ghost settings

      X and y offsets of the starting origin of the pac & ghost images with 
    respect to the upper left corner of the block.


  Color settings

      Palette files, random color range and pens. If you don't want random 
    colors set from > to.


  Graphic files

      All images can have any number of colors from 2 upto 256 and most of the
    images can be any width and height.
          
    Here is the list of image types with possible restrictions:

      Title image    (max size 320*64)
      Block images  
      Candy images   (size must be 12*12)
      Ghost images   (must have 6 frames, except eyes)
      Pac images     (must have 8 frames)

      
  Music files 

      Module files (the first is theme used in menu and the others are in-game 
    tunes).


  Sound files

      At first you have to write sample numbers for events and then sample 
   files and pitch rates for each sample (separated with comma).

      Here is some common pitch rates:

        Octave:       1                   2                   3 
                 Note   Pitch        Note   Pitch        Note   Pitch 
                 C      131          C      262          C      523
                 D      147          D      294          D      587  
                 E      165          E      330          E      659

                 B      247          B      494          B      993

      
  Font

      Font must be 8*8, fixed width and located in FONTS: directory.


  Messages

      Write messages in "". Maximum length is 16 characters. The first three 
    messages are quite special because game adds numeric info to them, so you 
    should leave some space for the data. You can specify if the numeric info is 
    added to the front/end of the message by writing space at the front/end of 
    the message. 

      Example: " to go"   -> "999 to go" 
               "To go: "  -> "To go: 999"

      Yet more special kind of messages can be found. Wheel of Fortune bonus has
    two messages, 1st and 5th, which doesn't work as normal messages. The first 
    is actually same message as 'Multi'-bonus message and the fifth is not 
    editable, its output is always "(#candy+1) * 500".

@NODE "BUGS" "Bugs"
@TOC "MAIN"

  1) Doesn't work on MC68000. It should, but it doesn't. The reason is in soundtracker 
     replayer (at least the game worked when I compiled it without replayer).
  2) After entering name to highscores, keyboard-input can lock for a while. I 
     think this happens because Blitz doesn't read keyboard as it should be done.
  3) If PlayPac's screen isn't the front-most screen its palette can corrupt.
     This is really strange and I have no idea why it is happening.
  4) Other than Amiga's native screenmodes can cause problems to PlayPac.
  5) PlayPac doesn't allocate audio channels properly.

@NODE "FURTHERINFO" "Further info"
@TOC "MAIN"

    PlayPac was written with BlitzBasic v2.1 on Amiga 1200 with OS3.0, 40MHz 
  '030 and 6MB memory. I have also tested PlayPac on A3000 with OS3.1, 50MHz 
  '060, CyberVision64 and 74MB memory, unfortunately game worked well only on 
  native Amiga screenmodes. I have even compiled a version which was executable 
  on OS2.x and tested it on Amiga B2000 with 28MHz 68000, but it had some 
  problems (mainly caused by ST-replayer, which crashed the system).
