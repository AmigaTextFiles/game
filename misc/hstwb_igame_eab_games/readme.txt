Introduction
------------

This is a screenshot pack for iGame, which has screenshots for all
games in EAB WHDLoad Packs v3.0. It's a minimal iGame version of
EAB WHDLoad Games Menu package part of HstWB Installer.

It contains screenshots in resolutions 320 x 128 and 320 x 256 to
support low resolution, non-interlaced, high resolution and interlaced
screen modes. All screenshots contains actual gameplay. Gameslist and
repos files for iGame are also included to get better game names to
search for in iGame without "Alt Alt".

Thanks to a lot of people, the screenshots are generated from various 
screenshot sources prioritised in the following order:
1. Custom (own or corrections).
2. iGameUpdatePackTroelsDK.
3. iGame Gameplay Shots 256.
4. GameBase Amiga v2.0.
5. Open Amiga Game Database.
6. Lemon Amiga.

Again thanks to a lot of people, the gameslist is generated from various 
detail sources prioritised in the following order:
1. Custom (own or corrections).
2. Hall Of Light.
3. Lemon Amiga.
4. Open Amiga Game Database.

Generation of screenshots is done using scripts to match EAB WHDLoad
game directory names with screenshot names. A few games required 
patching (changing EAB WHDLoad directory name) before matching to get
best possible match. Matching is done using exact names and Lucene
search.  

Screenshots are generated with following scripted steps:
1. Convert to png, resize to 320 x 128 or 320 x 256 and quantized to 
   255 colors using ImageMagick.
2. Convert to iff using NConvert.

Generation of gameslist is done using scripts to match EAB WHDLoad
game directory names with detail names. A few games required patching
(changing EAB WHDLoad directory name) before matching to get best 
possible match. Matching is done using exact names and Lucene
search.

Since all of this is generated by an automated process, there might be 
screenshots or gameslist that are not correct. In other words it's not
perfect, but a lot has been done to get it as good as possible.
