SIX LITTLE RANDOM NUMBERS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
A  very simple little program that generates six random numbers between 0 and
50.   As  you might have guessed it's for doing the national lottery (British
one  anyway).   Why write this?  Well, I was bored waiting for the lottery to
start.... and.... well... errmm....

Is it really worth writing instructions????

Run  the  program,  you'll  see six random numbers.  Click on the 'Gimme some
more  numbers'  button,  for  more  numbers...   The  menus contain 'Generate
Numbers'  which is the same as the above button.  Also there's an 'About' and
'Quit' option.  Couldn't be simpler, eh?
