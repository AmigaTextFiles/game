   Welcome to Atoms, the Third.

BACKGROUND:
   The original Atoms was (to the best of my knowledge) for the Atari ST,
and supposedly it sucked.  I never saw it, but given the quality of the
other programs for that platform, I'd probably agree.
   The first atoms for the Amiga was written by John Grivin, with help from
a few of his friends.  It is also available on Aminet, and should be in the
same directory this one was.  I highly recommend it, but only if you have a
European Amiga.  Even if you have PAL mode on as the Workbench resolution,
an NTSC machine will not only miss the bottom row of atoms completely, but
it may lock up sometime during the game.  Not sure why.  Just stops respond-
ing to mouse clicks and menu selections.  *shrug*

   ANYWAY....
   Version two was prompted by the previous.  All code is original.  Most
ideas are not.  (:  But that one worked with both NTSC and PAL machines. It
did NOT, however, display any extra rows in PAL mode.

   Version three is easily five to ten times faster, and has varying levels
of AI opponents.  Plus, it has an interlaced mode, quadrupling the number
of squares available.  And if blocks are on, then it quadruples the number
of those too, just to keep an even distribution.  It SHOULD also display a
couple extra rows on PAL machines.  If it doesn't, let me know via the
address at the end of this document.  Additionally, that 'mouse-adjustment'
thingy from version two is fixed.  (Took me maybe five minutes.  DUH!)


LOADING:
   Quite simple.  From Workbench, double-click on the Atoms icon.  It should
load automatically.  If it doesn't, check to make sure you have certain
libraries in your libs: dir, such as 'diskfont.library' and
'mathtrans.library'.  Also, make sure the data file 'bank1.abk' is in the
same directory, or you'll have to specify where it is every time the program
is run.


OPTIONS:
   There are several options, represented by icons along the left-hand side
of the screen, once the game is loaded.  You do not need to click on the
the grid as you did in version two.  The mouse automatically adjusts itself
to the screen.
   The first icon on the top of the column is the 'GO' icon.  This one
starts the game.  The next icon indicates how many players will be parti-
cipating in the game itself.  It goes up to five before returning to the
bare minimum needed to play (2).  The next icon down is the number of
players who are run by the computer.  These are taken from the number of
players, so if the two numbers are equal, the game will demo itself.  Be
warned, however, that the demo will not abort and you will be forced to wait
until they are done before you can do anything.  The minimum number of
computer players is zero, and the maximum is the number of players in the
game.
   The next icon is the Intelligence icon.  The smaller the computer screen,
the simpler-minded the computer opponents are.  Of course, this has no
meaning if there are no computer players.  All the computer players are of
the same intelligence.
   The next icon is the Fast icon, symbolized by a picture of a man running.
The default for this is 'on', but if turned off, the computer opponents move
the mouse pointer slower, and the explosions occure slower (but still faster
than either of the programs in version 2!)
   The next icon is the 'x2' icon.  When selected, the grid becomes doubles
in width and height, effectively quadrupling the playing field.  The screen
will be in hires interlaced mode instead of simple lowres.
   The next icon is the 'BLOCKS' icon.  When selected (default position),
there will be several grey blocks placed randomly on the board before the
game starts.  These blocks act as sections of the grid which have been cut
out, and act similarly to the edges of the grid.
   The next icon down is the 'Atoms' icon.  It selects whether or not to put
3 atoms of each color on the board randomly before each game.  Note that in
certain positions, some may explode (see 'PLAYING THE GAME' further down)
and possibly 'take over' other atoms, resulting in a disproportionate amount
for two or more of the players.  This is part of the game.  Life isn't fair.
(:  Also, in the interlaced mode, there are more than 3 placed due to the
size of the grid.
   The next icon is the 'SOUND EFFECTS' icon.  When this icon is up, all
non-background sounds will cease.
   The icon below that one is the 'MUSIC' icon.  Currently, there is no
musical soundtrack, so this does nothing but look nice.  (:  (See Future
Options)
   The final icon is the 'STOP' icon.  Select it to exit the program.


PLAYING THE GAME:
   Objective:  To eliminate all of your opponent's atoms from the board.

   Each player places one atom on his or her turn.  Each square on the grid
has a visible number of adjacent squares (NOT counting those with BLOCKS in
them).  If a square has at least one atom for each adjacent square, it will
explode, sending one atom into each adjoining location.  All squares receiv-
ing a new atom as a result of an explosion will take on that atom's color.
   You may only place atoms on either empty squares, or squares of your
color.
   The mouse cursor will turn the color of the player whose turn it is.  If
the cursor is yellow, it means the game is calculating.  If the cursor has
a brownish outline, that color is a computer player.  Computer players
always start with the color grey and go up from there.
   To abort the game before all players are eliminated, click on the STOP
icon.  You will be returned to the beginning of the game.  NOTE that you can
NOT click on the stop icon unless it is a human player's turn.  This means
that you cannot abort a 'demo' game (all computer players) without pressing
control-c (which exits the program).
   To place an atom, simply click with either mouse key on the square you
have chosen.


Version 2 vs. Version 3:
   Version 2 had 2 different versions of Atoms, version 3 has 1.
   Version 3 is much faster (even in 'slow' mode) than version 2.
   Version 3 automatically offsets the mouse properly.
   Version 3 has an interlaced feature which quadruples the number of grid
squares in play.
   Version 3 SHOULD automatically add a row or two for PAL machines.  Not
having a PAL machine, I can't test this.
   Version 3 has AI opponents.  They vary in skill from easy to hard.
(Just a note:  hard beats me a little less than half the time, provided
there are 4 computer opponents and 1 human, me.  I consider myself to be a
REALLY good player, too.)  I would have made the computer calculate every
single move out to its outcome, and also plan ahead, but I'd have had to do
it in assembly or it'd take a couple minutes per turn.  If I get enough
response, IE one or more people want it, (: I'll make it an option in the
next version.


FUTURE OPTIONS:
   I plan on adding (maybe):

 o - Background music, randomly selected each game from about 5 tunes.
     Okay, so I didn't get this done this version.  I may never get it done.
     It seems that the sounds I use conflict with how AMOS does its 'music'
     command.  (:

 o - Optional background graphics, scrolling by in multi-layers underneath
     the grid and icons.  Didn't get this one done either.  I decided to
     concentrate on game play improvements instead.  (:



OTHER SOFTWARE:
   Look for the following software from me in the near future:

 o - Spreadsheet.  A PD spreadsheet comparible to Paradox and other similar
     commercial software.  Includes links to other spreadsheets, cell
     commands and calculations, multiple reports for each spreadsheet,
     ARexx scripts, a clipboard, etc.  The PD version will have up to 10
     on-screen spreadsheets at a time, with up to an additional 10 hidden
     linked-in spreadsheets.  Should be available in early 1995.

 o - MassArc.  A new form of archiver, capable of compressing anything
     (including gifs, sound samples, and EXECUTABLES!) down to one third or
     less of the original size.  PD version will have no more than half of
     the equations, and won't have many of the options I'm putting in the
     registered version.  Unknown as to how soon it'll be available.
     Probably by the beginning of '95.

 o - Other miscellaneous games similar to this one.


CREDITS:
   I believe in giving credit where credit is due.
   It's due to John Grivin, without whom I would have never known of this
game.  Take some time to check out his version of this.  It's worth it just
for some of the comments in the docs he wrote.  (:
   It's also due to the other miscellaneous people at Halibut Software who
are mentioned in the docs as having credit.
   It's due to me for spending all this time writing yet another version,
especially since I work about 50 hours per week and have other commitments
of my minimal free time.  (:
