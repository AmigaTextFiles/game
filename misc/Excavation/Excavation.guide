The game Excavation is an arcade/strategy game set in the @{"underworld" link "eng_underworld"}. In this
game, the player is in charge of an Excavation Company and its four Excavators.
The Excavators work in a deep mine, digging up jewels so that the Company can
sell them.

This is as far as the overall node goes. Read other topics for more
information...

@node eng_plot "Story so far"
The planet of Mineralia is a pretty nice planet.
  Its diameter is about one and a half times that of Earth, and it consists
mainly of earth and rock. Few beings live there, apart from ghosts, amoebae,
and excavation companies.

Zwok Zwok Zwok had been, in his youth, the managing director of an excavation
company, called simply The Excavation Company. But now he was growing weary.
  The Excavation Company had several buildings situated above excavatable
ground in various places around the planet. Nobody knew what lurked below the
surface, for nobody had dared enter the shafts for many decades.
  There might be monsters. Indeed, some said, there were monsters. But there
also were gems, beautiful gems that everybody wanted to buy. So the company had
to go on.

Zwok Zwok Zwok had grown so weary that he thought he wouldn't last as a
managing director any more. So he chose to abdicate.

But who would inherit the title? Since he had no children left, the heir ought
to be one of his three grandchildren.
  First he thought of Vera. But Vera was an adventurous woman now, who had
already had two husbands and was about to marry a third one. Her second husband
had given her his surname Lynn. And the person she was about to marry was
called Akko. She was thinking something along the lines of Vera Lynn-Akko.
  Then he thought of Chuck. But Chuck had got married too, to a certain mrs.
Brown. They had even bought a dog, a black-and-white beagle, as far as Zwok
could recall.
  Lastly he thought of Dave. Dave was not eligible either, because he was a
teacher now. He teached general education for three students. They all had
some kind of mental delusion.
  Christopher Alvin (known as C.Alvin or simply Alvin) thought he had a friend,
whose name was Thomas Hobbes. Simon thought he was a sorceror. And Theodore -
well, he thought he sold vacuum cleaners.

So Zwok had no relatives left. He had a brilliant idea - he threw the company
open to the public - everybody could buy franchises of it and make a fortune by
excavating for gems and then selling them, buying equipment to excavate more
gems.
  It was well. Soon everybody across the planet was buying franchises, until
Zwok had grown tired of his own people's inability to lead excavation business,
so he declared instead that the directors must be from another planet.
  Nobody came until one shuttlecraft landed from a distant planet, called
Tellus. It contained a being who soon bought a franchise and started hiring
local people as his excavators. All was well... for now!

        YOU are this being! You must successfully guide your four
        excavators and make them search for gems, use equipment and
        excavate even deeper and deeper! Good Luck!

@endnode
@node eng_menu "Today's a la Carte"

The main menu has six actions for you to perform:

    - Create a world
This (or loading a saved game) is necessary for you to access the game itself
at all. Basically what this does is create a whole new world for you, making
all those little passages and caverns, and putting the @{"objects and creatures"} link "eng_objects"}
in place.

    - Load a saved game (not available in @{"unregistered" link "eng_money"} version)
Loads a saved game from disk, surprisingly. It also checks whether the file is
really an Excavation saved game or not. If it isn't, you are left with no
world at all.

    - Delete a file from disk
Guess! This will work on any file, not just Excavation saved games.

    - Go!
Click this button to enter the mystical world of Excavation!

    - Music
Allows you to choose a music for the game. The music has to be in .abk "Music"
format, and the music bank must be #3, and it must be the only bank in the
file. Pretty impressive, innit?

    - Quit
This button is reserved for top professionals. Anybody who isn't a Computer
Guru and/or hasn't got an IQ of over 160 shouldn't touch this button at all.
Pretend it doesn't exist.

Just click on the corresponding button to do whatever you please.
@endnode
@node eng_base "Chemistry rules - but where's the Acid?"

The Base is the brain of your Excavation Company. The Base is always present,
and cannot be destroyed in any way.
  When you start the game, you will automatically enter the Base. If you are
controlling an Excavator, you can return to the Base by pressing HELP.

In the base, you can carry out all sorts of operations. Here is an overview of
them.

    - Trade
You can buy and sell loads of different things, like @{"Equipment" link "eng_equip"}, Power and
Food, and Jewels. Just click on the topmost buttons to select your "trade
page".
  The trade itself is a little more complex. To actually buy/sell something,
you must do the following:
  - If you are trading Equipment, you must first select your Equipment from
the page.
  - Find a black box with white numbers. Click on it and type the number of
things you wish to buy/sell, and press Return.
  - If there's a +/- button next to the black box, toggle it so that it reads
+ if you are going to buy stuff, or - if you will sell stuff.
  - Then click on a Buy, Sell or Buy/Sell button.

    - Outfit Excavators
There are four buttons which allow you to choose one of your Excavators for
outfitting. Here's an overview of things you can do to your Excavator:
  - You can give him @{"Equipment" link "eng_equip"}. Just select what Equipment you want to give
him (or take from him) and then click on one of his Equipment slots. The left
mouse button gives Equipment, the right one takes it away.
  - You can give him Power and Food. Just click on the black boxes and type the
new values you want.
  - You can give his Jewels to the Base. Press the little arrow buttons to
transfer all Jewels, or type the numbers on the black boxes.
  - You can eject an Excavator from the base, either on the left side or on
the right side.
  - You can hire a new Excavator. This costs 2000 money, and the Excavator has
to be dead in order to do this.

    - Maps & Probes
You can view your map, or one of your @{"Probes" link "eng_equip"}. If you want to view a Probe you
must first type its number, from 0 to 99, on the black box next to the Probe
View button.
  In the View screen, there are four buttons. They are:
  - Scan. Do the actual viewing.
  - Exit. Return to your Base screen.
  - Upgrade. Probe upgrades cost 800 and map upgrades cost 1500. This will
enhance the intensity of your viewing.
  - Abort scan. If you are scanning, press this button to abort.

    - Switch to Excavator
Will transfer control to an Excavator, so you can actually play the game.

    - Save & Quit.
You can save your current game (not available in @{"unregistered" link "eng_money"} version) or quit
your game, returning to the main menu.

When you are in the Base, time is frozen, so you can take as many years as you
want to do all these actions.
@endnode
@node eng_play "What are you playing at?"

Actually playing the game is very simple. Use a joystick or the cursor keys to
control your Excavator.
  To use @{"Equipment" link "eng_equip"}, first choose a slot by pressing F1...F6. The Equipment
lights have four colours:
    - dark red = neither selected nor active.
    - bright red = selected, but not active.
    - dark green = not selected, but active.
    - bright green = both selected and active.
  (If you want an explanation of the Equipment, hold Shift while pressing
F1...F6.)
  To activate/deactivate your Equipment, press Fire/Spacebar. There are three
different Equipment types:
    - Togglers. These can either be switched on or off. These are the only ones
which can have green lights.
    - Activatives. Just select one and press Fire, and it will be carried out.
    - Background Equipment. Always active, no matter what you do.

To switch between Excavators, press F7...F10. To switch to the Base, press
Help.
  If you are standing adjacent to another Excavator, you can access the @{"Link" link "eng_link"}
screen by pressing Return. More of that later on.

The playing screen is of a darker grey colour than the Base screen, to show you
that time indeed passes in this screen, and is not frozen.
@endnode
@node eng_objects "I object!"

In the mines, you can meet the following types of scenery:

    - Earth. Comes in normal or yellow mineral shapes. Just walk on it, or dig
it. Dig it?
    - Rock. Can be walked on, but will headstrongly refuse to be destroyed in
any way.
    - Magma. Falling into magma will kill your Excavator. Cannot be destroyed.
    - Trees. Any artistic person knows that the two most beautiful things a
game can have are girls and trees. There are no girls in Excavation, so this
will have to do. Trees cannot be destroyed.
    - Ladders. Climb on them. Brown ladders are natural, white ladders are
artificial.
    - Blue arrows. These can be walked on, but only to the direction of the
arrows. Cannot be destroyed.
    - Teleports. If you touch a teleport, you will be randomly whisked some-
where else in the mines. Cannot be destroyed.
    - Jewels. There are Amethysts, Topazes and Sapphires. Just collect them.
    - Food. One apple will give you some extra units of food.

Jewels and Food may be found inside earth.

You can also meet the following creatures:

    - Ghosts. There are 12 Ghosts in total, and they wander aimlessly across
the mines. Maybe they are descendants of Inky, Pinky, Blinky and Clyde, maybe
not. Anyway, contact with them is fatal. They cannot be destroyed.
    - Amoeba. The Amoeba dwells deep underground and grows. Growing is its sole
meaning of life. It can be blown away, bit by bit, using the @{"Bombs" link "eng_equip"}. The Amoeba
doesn't kill either you or the Ghosts on contact.
@endnode
@node eng_equip "Welcome to the Excavation shop!"

There are 12 different pieces of Equipment available. Here they are:

    - SED (Standard Equipment Drill)
Will dig through normal earth, but not through mineral earth. Uses 1 unit of
power per dig. This is a Toggler.
    - HPD (High Performance Drill)
Will dig through both normal and mineral earth. Uses 1 unit of power per dig,
or 2 if digging through minerals. This is also a Toggler.
    - LCU (Ladder Creation Unit)
Creates ladders every time you go upwards. Ladders cost 3 units of power per
piece. A Toggler.
    - RLD (Radiophonic Location Device)
Will simply display your coordinates when active. Uses only 1 unit of power per
80 moves. Toggler.
    - VYB (Variable Yield Bombs)
Can be dropped on the ground, and then it will remain in place for five
seconds. After that, it will explode. It will destroy any destroyable things,
including your Excavators. The yield is simply the radius of the explosion.
This is an Activative. Uses some power.
    - ISP (Independent Surveillance Probes)
Can be sent away in a direction, travelling a certain distance or until it hits
something. After it has stopped, it can be viewed through the @{"Base" link "eng_base"} screen.
These can be destroyed with a bomb! An Activative, uses some power.
    - PSD (Power Supply Doubler)
Compresses the Excavator's power supply so that his usable supply is double the
size of his actual one. A Background Equipment.
    - PST (Power Supply Tripler)
Like the PSD, only triples. Also a Background Equipment.
    - HGL (Hidden Gem Locator)
When active, this will display any Jewels/Food hidden in the earth. Jewels are
displayed as white "pseudo-Jewels". Uses 1 unit of power per 20 moves. A
Toggler.
    - SDU (Self Destruction Unit)
When used, this will kill your Excavator. Uses no power. An Activative.
    - AFS (Auxiliary Food Supply)
Like the PSD, but compresses the Food supply. A Background Equipment.
    - FPU (Fusion Power Unit)
Will create its own power, completely freeing the Excavator from any needs of
power storage. Also a Background Equipment.
@endnode
@node eng_require "What do I require?"

The game requires the following:

    - A Commodore / @{"Escom" link "eng_escom"} Amiga (any model >=500)
    - Approximately 1 megabyte of free memory.
    - A mouse (a joystick also is recommended).
    - The presence of the file "ExcavationData.abk".
    - Amigaguide compatibility for the viewing of this document.

If the game finds an assign "Excavation:" it will change to that directory.

        More Underground Games to play after a game of:
                        « EXCAVATION »


    1. Boulder Dash
    (First Star, 1984)

    Availability: C64, Amiga

Boulder Dash is already a category of its own, truly a legend. There are many
clones for both computers. The basic idea is that it is set in many 2D caves,
which the player must explore and collect diamonds. He has to avoid monsters
such as fireflies and butterflies. Falling rocks were abudant in this game.

    2. Dig Dug
    (somebody, in the beginning of the 1980s)

    Availability: C64, PC, Atari 2600

Dig Dug was a simple multiple-level 2D arcade game, where the player had a
character (maybe mr. Dug himself) and there were some monsters underground. The
player then had to inflate the monsters with his pump until they burst to
death. Probably of Japanese origin.

    3. Diggers
    (Milennium, 1993)

    Availability: Amiga AGA, CD³²

Diggers was the first game to be released first on the CD³². Although I've
never played it, I've based Excavation mainly on its idea. The basic idea is to
have five diggers running in caverns searching for gems. The diggers have got a
life of their own, unlike the excavators in this game.

    4. Dugger
    (Lin-el, in the end of the 1980s)

    Availability: Amiga (possibly ST also)

Dugger was a graphically advanced version of Dig Dug. That's about it.

    5. H.E.R.O.
    (Activision, 1984)

    Availability: C64

H.E.R.O. was a multi-level platform game in which the hero (!) had to go down
to the bottom of each level and interface with some sort of machine. The main
feature was that the hero could fly with a propeller backpack.

    6. Monster Business
    (Eclipse, 1991)

    Availability: Amiga

Another graphically advanced version of Dig Dug, only this time truly a
different version. Introduced platforms to Dig Dug.

    7. Mr. Do! (I think)
    (somebody, in the 1980s)

    Availability: C64? PC?

Mr. Do! was like Dig Dug, only you killed monsters by dropping rocks on them
rather than inflating them. A version for the Amiga has been released in 1995,
called Derring-Do.

    8. Spelunker
    (Brøderbund, 1984)

    Availability: C64

This is my all-time favourite Underground game. It takes place in a cavern at
least a kilometer deep, and is in its basic sense a platform game. Devices
include ladders, lifts and pyramids, and there are two monsters: the
excrementing bird and the Ghost!


RPGs like Dungeon Master and Eye of the Beholder are not counted as Underground
games, since they take place in man-made dungeons rather than natural caverns.
So there.
@endnode
@node eng_underworld "What is the underworld?"

This is a controversial term. It can mean either:
    - the world of criminals
    - or the world deep inside the earth.
This game uses, of course, the latter meaning.

The term is not to be confused with "netherworld", which is, basically, Hell.
@endnode
@node eng_link "No Zelda here"

The Link screen is a link between two Excavators. Here you can transfer things
from one Excavator to another.

Each Excavator has a set of buttons, which allow him to trade things with his
friend.
  To trade @{"Equipment" link "eng_equip"}, just choose the correct Equipment, and use the + and -
buttons. Both Excavators must choose the same type of Equipment!
  To trade Jewels, Power and Food, just click on the black boxes and type away!
  To leave, press the Exit button.
@endnode
@node eng_escom "Are you stupid or something?"

ESCOM - what a company! They buy the remains of Commodore, decide to make a new
Amiga, and then neglect it almost completely. Well, here in Finland anyway. I
haven't seen ANY mention of Amiga in any Finnish newspaper (only in computer
magazines, and even they have 12 Amiga pages compared to 160 PC pages). ESCOM
doesn't seem to be aware of the possibilities of advertising. Boohoo!
@endnode
@node eng_excavation "Excavation?"

The reason for the name Excavation is simple. It describes the act of
excavating.
  Now, why is this game not called "X-Kavation" or something equally stupid?
Well, I believe that sort of thing is only for the kids, and as I am a grown-
up person, I think properly and spell properly.

@endnode
@node fin_plot "Tarina tähän asti"
Planeetta Mineralia on aika mukava planeetta.
  Sen halkaisija on noin puolitoista kertaa Maan halkaisija, ja se koostuu pää-
osin maasta ja kivestä. Siellä elää vähän olioita, vain kummituksia, ameeboja
ja exkavaatioyhtiöitä.

Zwok Zwok Zwok oli ollut, nuorena, exkavaatioyhtiön, jonka nimi oli Exkavaatio-
yhtiö, pääjohtaja. Mutta nyt hän ei enää jaksanut.
  Exkavaatioyhtiöllä oli useita rakennuksia kaivettavan maan yläpuolella useis-
sa paikoissa ympäri planeettaa. Kukaan ei tiennyt mitä pinnan alla piili, koska
kukaan ei ollut uskaltanut astua kuiluihin useisiin vuosikymmeniin.
  Siellä voisi olla hirviöitä. Tosiaan, jotkut sanoivat, siellä oli hirviöitä.
Mutta siellä oli myös jalokiviä, kauniita jalokiviä joita kaikki halusivat os-
taa. Joten yhtiön oli jatkettava.

Zwok Zwok Zwok ei jaksanut enää johtaa yhtiötä. Joten hän erosi virastaan.

Mutta kuka perisi hänen toimensa? Koska hänellä ei ollut enää lapsia, perijän
pitäisi olla yksi hänen lapsenlapsistaan.
  Ensin hän ajatteli Veraa. Mutta Vera oli nykyisin seikkailullinen nainen,
jolla oli jo ollut kaksi aviomiestä ja joka aikoi nyt mennä naimisiin kolmannen
kanssa. Hänen toinen aviomiehensä oli antanut hänelle sukunimensä Lynn. Ja hen-
kilö, jonka kanssa hän aikoi mennä naimisiin, oli nimeltään Akko. Hän ajatteli
jotain siihen suuntaan kuin Vera Lynn-Akko.
  Sitten hän ajatteli Chuckia. Mutta Chuckkin oli mennyt naimisiin, erään rva
Brownin kanssa. He olivat jopa ostaneet koiran, mustavalkoisen beaglen, sikäli
kuin Zwok Zwok Zwok muisti.
  Viimeiseksi hän ajatteli Davea. Mutta Davekaan ei ollut vapaana, koska hän
oli nykyisin opettaja. Hän opetti yleisopetusta kolmelle oppilaalle. Heillä
kaikilla oli hengellisiä harhakuvia.
  Christopher Alvin (tunnettu C.Alvinina tai vain Alvinina) luuli, että hänellä
oli ystävä, jonka nimi oli Thomas Hobbes. Simon luuli olevansa velho. Ja Theo-
dore - no, hän luuli myyvänsä pölynimureita.

Joten Zwokilla ei ollut sukulaisia jäljellä. Hänellä oli loistava idea - hän
julisti yhtiön julkiseksi - kuka tahansa voisi ostaa sen osakkeita ja rikastua
kaivamalla jalokiviä ja myymällä niitä, ostaen varusteita kaivaakseen lisää ja-
lokiviä.
  Kaikki sujui hyvin. Pian kaikki planeetalla ostivat osakkeita, kunnes Zwok
kyllästyi oman kansansa kyvyttömyyteen johtaa exkavaatioalaa, joten hän julis-
ti, että johtajien tulee olla toiselta planeetalta.
  Kukaan ei tullut ennen kuin yksi sukkula laskeutui kaukaiselta planeetalta,
jonka nimi oli Tellus. Siinä oli olio joka pian osti osakkeen ja alkoi palkata
paikallisia asukkaita exkavaattoreikseen. Kaikki sujui hyvin... tähän asti!

        SINÄ olet tämä olio! Sinun täytyy onnistua kuljettamaan neljää exka-

@node fin_menu "A la Carte tänään"

Päävalikossa on neljä toimintaa sinun valittavaksesi:

    - Luo maailma
Tämä (tai tallennetun pelin lataaminen) vaaditaan päästäksesi pelaamaan yhtään.
Tämä luo maailman sinulle, tehden kaikki pikku käytävät ja luolat, ja laittaen
@{"objektit ja oliot" link "fin_objects"} paikoilleen.

    - Lataa tallennettu peli (ei käytettävissä @{"rekisteröimättömässä" link "fin_money"} versiossa)
Lataa tallennetun pelin levyltä, yllättävsti. Tarkistaa myös, onko tiedosto to-
della Excavationin tallennettu peli vai ei. Jos ei, sinulle ei jää mitään maa-
ilmaa.

    - Tuhoa tiedosto levyltä
Arvaa! Tämä toimii millä tahansa tiedostolla, ei vain Excavationin tallenne-
tuilla peleillä.

    - Mene!
Klikkaa tätä nappia astuaksesi sisään Excavationin mystiseen maailmaan!

    - Musiikki
Antaa sinun valita musiikin pelille. Musiikin täytyy olla .abk "Music"-formaa-
tissa, musiikkipankin täytyy olla #3, ja sen täytyy olla tiedoston ainoa pank-
ki. Aika vaikuttavaa, eikös?

    - Lopeta
Tämä nappi on varattu huippuammattilaisille. Kenenkään joka ei ole Tietokonegu-
ru ja/tai jolla ei ole yli 160:n ÄOta ei pitäisi koskea tähän nappiin laisin-
kaan. Teeskentele ettei sitä ole olemassakaan.

Sen kuin painat vastaavaa nappia tehdäksesi mitä ikinä lystäätkään.
@endnode
@node fin_base "Kemia hallitsee - mutta missä Happo on?"

Pesä on Exkavaatioyhtiösi aivot. Pesä on aina paikalla, eikä sitä voi mitenkään
tuhota.
  Kun aloitat pelin, siirryt automaattisesti Pesään. Jos ohjaat Exkavaattoria,
voit palata Pesään painamalla HELP.

Pesässä voit tehdä kaikenlaisia toimenpiteitä. Tässä käydään ne kaikki läpi.

    - Kaupankäynti
Voit ostaa ja myydä useita erilaisia tavaroita, kuten @{"Varusteita" link "fin_equip"}, Virtaa ja
Ruokaa, ja Jalokiviä. Klikkaa ylimmäisiä nappeja valitaksesi "kaupankäyntisivu-
si".
  Itse kaupankäynti on hieman monimutkaisempaa. Ostaaksesi/myydäksesi jotain
sinun täytyy tehdä seuraavaa:
  - Jos käyt kauppaa Varusteilla, sinun täytyy ensin valita Varusteesi sivulta.
  - Etsi musta laatikko, jossa on valkoisia numeroita. Klikkaa sitä ja kirjoita
haluttujen asioiden lukumäärä, ja paina Return.
  - Jos löydät +/- napin, klikkaa sitä kunnes se on + jos haluat ostaa, tai -
jos haluat myydä.
  - Sitten klikkaa Buy, Sell tai Buy/Sell nappia.

    - Exkavaattorien varustaminen
Voit valita varustettavan Exkavaattorin neljästä napista. Tässä käydään läpi
kaikki temput, joita voit tehdä Exkavaattorillesi:
  - Voit antaa hänelle @{"Varusteita" link "fin_equip"}. Valitse mitä Varusteita haluat antaa hänel-
le (tai ottaa häneltä) ja klikkaa yhtä hänen Varusteluukuistaan. Vasen hiiren-
nappi antaa Varusteita ja oikea ottaa niitä pois.
  - Voit antaa hänelle Virtaa ja Ruokaa. Klikkaa mustia laatikoita ja kirjoita
haluamasi uudet arvot.
  - Voit antaa hänen Jalokivensä Pesälle. Paina pieniä nuolinappuloita siir-
tääksesi kaikki Jalokivet, tai kirjoita numerot mustiin laatikoihin.
  - Voit tuupata Exkavaattorin pois Pesästä, joko vasemmalle tai oikealle puo-
lelle.
  - Voit palkata uuden Exkavaattorin. Tämä maksaa 2000 rahaa, ja Exkavaattorin
täytyy olla kuollut.

    - Kartat & Luotaimet
Voit katsella karttaa, tai yhtä @{"Luotaimistasi" link "fin_equip"}. Jos haluat katsella Luotainta
sinun täytyy ensin kirjoittaa sen numero, 0-99, mustaan laatikkoon Probe View-
nappulan viereen.
  Katseluruudussa on neljä nappia. Ne ovat:
  - Scan. Itse katselu.
  - Exit. Paluu Pesäruutuun.
  - Upgrade. Luotainpäivitykset maksavat 800 ja karttapäivitykset 1500. Tämä
lisää katselutehoasi.
  - Abort scan. Jos keilaat, tämä keskeyttää keilaamisesi.

    - Vaihda Exkavaattoriin
Siirtää kontrollin Exkavaattoriin, jotta voit pelata peliä.

    - Tallennus & Lopetus
Voit tallettaa nykyisen pelisi (ei käytettävissä @{"rekisteröimättömässä" link "fin_money"} versios-
sa) tai lopettaa pelin, palaten päävalikkoon.

Kun olet Pesässä, aika on jäätynyt joten voit käyttää kuinka monta vuotta sit-
ten haluatkaan näiden kaikkien temppujen tekemiseen.
@endnode
@node fin_play "Mitäs peliä tämä on?"

Pelin varsinainen pelaaminen on erittäin helppoa. Käytä peliohjainta tai kurso-
rinäppäimiä ohjataksesi Exkavaattoriasi.
  Käyttääksesi @{"Varusteita" link "fin_equip"}, valitse ensin luukku painamalla F1...F6. Varusteva-
loilla on neljä väriä:
    - tummanpunainen = ei valittu eikä aktiivinen.
    - kirkkaanpunainen = valittu, muttei aktiivinen.
    - tummanvihreä = ei valittu, mutta aktiivinen.
    - kirkkaanvihreä = sekä valittu että aktiivinen.
  (Jos haluat selostuksen Varusteestasi, pidä Shiftiä alhaalla painaessasi
F1...F6.)
  Aktivoidaksesi/deaktivoidaksesi Varusteesi, paina Tulitus/Välilyöntiä. Varus-
teita on kolmea erilaista tyyppiä:
    - Kääntyjät. Nämä voidaan kääntää päälle tai pois. Ainoa tyyppi, jolla voi
olla vihreitä valoja.
    - Aktivatiivit: Valitse yksi ja paina Tulitus, ja se käynnistyy.
    - Taustavarusteet: Aina aktiivisia, teetpä sitten mitä hyvänsä.

Vaihtaaksesi Exkavaattorien välillä paina F7...F10. Voit palata Pesään paina-
malla Help.
  Jos seisot toisen Exkavaattorin vieressä, voit päästä @{"Linkkiruutuun" link "fin_link"} paina-
malla Return. Siitä lisää tuonnempana.

Pelaamisruutu on tummempi harmaa kuin Pesäruutu, osoittaakseen että täällä aika
tosiaan kulkee, eikä ole jäätynyt.
@endnode
@node fin_objects "Vastustan!"

Kaivoksissa voit tavata seuraavanlaisia maisemantyyppejä:

    - Maa. Tätä on normaalia ja keltaista mineraalia. Kävele sen päällä tai
kaiva sitä. Diggaaksä?
    - Kivi. Tämän pinnalla voi kävellä, mutta se kieltäytyy itsepintaisesti tu-
houtumasta millään tavalla.
    - Magma. Magmaan putoaminen tappaa Exkavaattorin. Ei voi tuhota.
    - Puut. Kuka tahansa taiteellinen henkilö tietää että kaksi kauneinta asiaa
mitä pelissä voi olla ovat tytöt ja puut. Excavation-pelissä ei ole tyttöjä,
joten tämä saa kelvata. Puita ei voi tuhota.
    - Tikapuut. Kiipeä näitä pitkin. Ruskeat tikapuut ovat luonnollisia, val-
koiset keinotekoisia.
    - Siniset nuolet. Näillä voi kävellä, mutta vain nuolen osoittamaan suun-
taan. Ei voi tuhota.
    - Teleportit. Jos kosket teleporttiin, sinut viedään satunnaisesti jonnekin
muualle kaivoksissa. Ei voi tuhota.
    - Jalokivet. On Ametisteja, Topaaseja ja Safiireja. Kerää niitä.
    - Ruoka. Kukin omena antaa sinulle pari ylimääräistä ruokayksikköä.

Jalokiviä ja Ruokaa voi myös löytyä maan sisältä.

Voit myös tavata seuraavat oliot:
    - Kummitukset. Kummituksia on kaikkiaan 12, ja ne vaeltavat kaivoksissa
vailla päämäärää. Ehkä ne ovat Inkyn, Pinkyn, Blinkyn ja Clyden jälkeläisiä,
ehkeivät. Kuitenkin, kosketus niihin on hengenvaarallinen. Niitä ei voi tuhota.
    - Ameeba. Ameeba asuu syvällä maan sisällä ja kasvaa. Kasvaminen on sen
elämän ainoa tarkoitus. Sitä voi räjäyttää pois @{"Pommeilla" link "fin_equip"}, pala palalta. Amee-
ba ei tapa sinua eikä Kummituksia koskettaessaan niitä.
@endnode
@node fin_equip "Tervetuloa Excavation-kauppaan!"

Varusteita on 12 erilaista. Tässä ne ovat:

    - SED (Standard Equipment Drill) = SVP (Standardi VarustePora)
Kaivaa normaalin maan läpi, muttei pysty mineraalimaahan. Käyttää 1 yksikön
virtaa per kaivuu. Tämä on Kääntyjä.
    - HPD (High Performance Drill) = KSP (Korkean Suorituksen Pora)
Kaivaa sekä normaalin että mineraalimaan läpi. Käyttää 1 yksikön virtaa per
kaivuu, tai 2 jos kaivat mineraalimaata. Tämäkin on Kääntyjä.
    - LCU (Ladder Creation Unit) = TTY (Tikapuiden TekemisYksikkö)
Tekee tikapuita aina kun liikut ylöspäin. Tikapuut maksavat 3 yksikköä virtaa
per pala. Kääntyjä.
    - RLD (Radiophonic Location Displayer) = RPN (Radiofoninen PaikanNäyttäjä)
Näyttää koordinaattisi aktiivisena. Käyttää vain 1 yksikön virtaa per 80 lii-
kettä.
    - VYB (Variable Yield Bombs) = MVP (Muuttuvan Voiman Pommit)
Voi tiputtaa maahan, ja sitten se pysyy paikoillaan viisi sekuntia. Sen jäl-
keen se räjähtää. Se tuhoaa kaikki tuhottavat asiat, myös Exkavaattorisi. Voima
on yksinkertaisesti räjähdyksen säde. Tämä on Aktivatiivi. Käyttää jonkinverran
virtaa.
    - ISP (Independent Surveillance Probes) = ISL (Itsenäiset SeurantaLuotai-
      met)
Voi lähettää johonkin suuntaan, kulkien tietyn matkan tai kunnes törmää johon-
kin. Kun se on pysähtynyt, sitä voidaan katsella @{"Pesäruudusta" link "fin_base"}. Näitä voidaan
tuhota Pommeilla! Aktivatiivi, käyttää jonkinverran virtaa.
    - PSD (Power Supply Doubler) = VVT (VirtaVaraston Tuplaaja)
Puristaa Exkavaattorin virtavaraston kokoon, joten hänen käytettävissä oleva
virtavarastonsa on kaksi kertaa niin suuri kuin hänen oikea varastonsa on.
Taustavaruste.
    - PST (Power Supply Tripler) = VVK (VirtaVaraston Kolminkertaistaja)
Kuten PSD=VVT, mutta kolminkertaistaa. Myös Taustavaruste.
    - HGL (Hidden Gem Locator) = PJP (Piilotettujen Jalokivien Paikallistaja)
Aktiivisena tämä näyttää kaikki maan sisään piilotetut Jalokivet/Ruoat. Jaloki-
vet näytetään valkoisina "pseudo-Jalokivinä". Käyttää 1 yksikön virtaa per 20
liikettä. Kääntyjä.
    - SDU (Self Destruction Unit) = ITY (ItseTuhoYksikkö)
Kun tätä käytetään, se tappaa Exkavaattorin. Ei käytä virtaa. Aktivatiivi.
    - AFS (Auxiliary Food Supply) = ARV (ApuRuokaVarasto)
Kuten PSD=VVT, mutta puristaa ruokavaraston kokoon. Taustavaruste.
    - FPU (Fusion Power Unit) = FVY (FuusioVirtaYksikkö)
Luo oman virtansa, vapauttaen Exkavaattorin täysin mistään virtavaraston tar-
peesta. Myös Taustavaruste.

        jälkeen


    1. Boulder Dash
    (First Star, 1984)

    Saatavissa: C64, Amiga

Boulder Dash on jo oma kategoriansa, tosiaankin legenda. Siitä on monia kloone-
ja molemmille koneille. Perusidea on, että se tapahtuu monissa 2D luolissa,
joita pelaajan täytyy tutkia ja kerätä timantteja. Hänen täytyy välttää hirvi-
öitä kuten tulikärpäsiä ja perhosia. Tässä pelissä oli paljon putoavia kiviä.

    2. Dig Dug
    (joku, 1980-luvun alussa)

    Saatavissa: C64, PC, Atari 2600

Dig Dug oli yksinkertainen monitasoinen 2D toimintapeli, jossa pelaajalla oli
hahmo (ehkä itse hra Dug) ja maan alla oli hirviöitä. Pelaajan tuli puhaltaa
hirviöt täyteen ilmaa kunnes ne poksahtivat kuoliaiksi. Varmaankin japanilaista
alkuperää.

    3. Diggers
    (Milennium, 1993)

    Saatavissa: Amiga AGA, CD³²

Diggers oli ensimmäinen peli joka julkaistiin ensimmäiseksi CD³²:lla. Vaikka en
ole koskaan pelannut sitä, olen perustanut Excavationin pääosin sen idealle.
Perusidea on pitää viittä kaivajaa luolissa juoksemassa etsien jalokiviä. Kai-
vajilla on oma elämänsä, toisin kuin tämän pelin exkavaattoreilla.

    4. Dugger
    (Lin-el, 1980-luvun lopussa)

    Saatavissa: Amiga (ehkä myös ST)

Dugger oli graafisesti edistynyt versio Dig Dugista. Siinä suurinpiirtein kaik-
ki.

    5. H.E.R.O.
    (Activision, 1984)

    Saatavissa: C64

H.E.R.O. oli monitasoinen tasohyppelypeli jossa sankarin (!) täytyi mennä alas
kunkin tason pohjalle ja liittyä jonkinmoisen koneen kanssa. Pääidea oli että
sankari voi lentää potkurirepun avulla.

    6. Monster Business
    (Eclipse, 1991)

    Saatavissa: Amiga

Toinen graafisesti edistynyt versio Dig Dugista, tällä kertaa vain todela eri-
lainen versio. Esitteli lattiat Dig Dugille.

    7. Mr. Do! (luulisin)
    (joku, 1980-luvulla)

    Saatavissa: C64? PC?

Mr. Do! oli kuten Dig Dug, mutta tapoit hirviöitä tappamalla kiviä niiden pääl-
le etkä pumppaamalla niitä täyteen ilmaa. Amigalle julkaistiin versio 1995,
jonka nimi oli Derring-Do.

    8. Spelunker
    (Brøderbund, 1984)

    Saatavissa: C64

Tämä on kaikkien aikojen suosikkini Maanalaisista peleistä. Se tapahtuu luolas-
sa, joka on ainakin kilometrin syvyinen, ja on perustaltaan tasohyppelypeli.
Mukana on laitteita kuten tikapuita, hissejä ja pyramideja, ja hirviöitä on
kaksi: ulostava lintu ja Haamu!


Roolipelejä kuten Dungeon Master ja Eye of the Beholder ei lasketa Maanalaisik-
si peleiksi, koska ne tapahtuvat ihmisten tekemissä tyrmissä eivätkä luonnolli-
sissa luolissa. Että silleen.

@node fin_underworld "Mikä on alamaailma?"

Tämä on kontroversiaalinen termi. Se voi tarkoittaa joko:

to fire an arrow in is, of course, forwards.

@{b}Right@{ub}
Just like left, only right.

@{b}Shift-Left@{ub}
