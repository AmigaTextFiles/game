 I did Raidabit, because of these old Games, Pharaos Curse, Pitfall,
 Jungle Hunt, Cedric on Amiga and last but not least,
 Smurf on Colecovision.


 All you have to do, is to walk trough the Screens, pick up items, use
 them at the right place or combine them with each other.
 You must avoid different sorts of Enemys and Grounds, you cannot walk
 on. 
 Touching a Enemy or walking, for example, on lava lets your Energy
 run down, but you can ´refresh´ it by eating fruits or drinking.


 Okay, all you have to do to play is here:

   First of all, try to imagine a hot, steamy jungle, the crys of
   all sorts of animals, an atmosphere of death.
   Know, that you are on the way to the ´Temple of the Dead´, three weeks
   leaving Praihna, where you sold you Transamazonica-damaged Car.
   You girlfriends father never returned from his expedition to the
   legendary Place, so she asked you to get him out there if still alive.
   When you start to feel you heavy leather boots grinding the stones on
   your narrow path trough the lower andes, then just doubleclick
   the "Raidabit" Icon an go!!!




 Raidabit was done in, I guess, a too long time for a game like this.
 It works with LoRes, 64 Colors, and needs at least 1 MB,
 min. 512K Chip.
 This game was just a try, so I ´saved´ a lot of time using NO crunch-
 routines and just the easymod stuff on the MED Player.
 That means, you have to reload the Programm every time you die or
 solve the game. That´s not too bad, because you´re energy is so high,
 that you can play for a long time.
 I am sorry for being no grafix artist. This all could have been much
 better, if I had known some good painters. Okay, maybe next time I´m
 gonna find someone.
