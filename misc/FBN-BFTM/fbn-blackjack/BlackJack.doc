Blackjack For The Master

A while back, The Master was trying to program a blackjack game for the
amiga.  He called me up a few times with problems and was obviously having
difficulty for one simple reason: He was trying to program like they
taught him to at school!  Any REAL programmer knows that `seat of the
pants' programming is the only way to go.  I told him I'd do a version and
show him what `unstructured, self-taught' programming can do.  The entire
program is 192 lines long and about a third of that is rems for clarity and
blank lines for readability.  As usual, I am releasing the game as
freeware.  Keep the "BFTM" and "BFTM.16.hr" files in the same directory and
it will work fine.

You are facing Drako, the dealer from hell.  The only way you can win is
hope he goes bust.  He will ALWAYS try to beat your score.  If I get enough
response, I may try a bigger version with sfx and more than one dealer
style.  Send your comments and generous donations (ya, right) to:
