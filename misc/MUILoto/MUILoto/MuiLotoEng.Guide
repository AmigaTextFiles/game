 @{u}Use:@{uu}

@{i}@{u}Démarrage@{uu}@{ui}

	@{b}CLI@{ub}	: MUILoto @{i}[NameGridFile]@{ui}
	@{b}WB@{ub}	: Clik on the software icon or grid icon

	@{b}1) Loto Part@{ub}

On your left, you have 49 numbers. You can choose up to 6 numbers per grid. You can choose on of the 8 grids in the grid "Group" (from Grid 1 to Grid 8). If you choose "Results" you can now enter numbers of drawing.

So you can see at the bottom how many numbers are good for each grid.
Each "result" number is displayed in white on each of the 8 grids.

 @{u}Buttons:@{uu}

@{b}Delete:@{ub} Delete the displayed grid.

@{b}Random:@{ub} This soft helps you to manage 8 grid with 6 numbers for each grid.
So there are 48 possible numbers for 8 grids. The random button randomly chooses 48 numbers on the 49 and dispatch them on the 8 grids. Thos function gives 48 possibility on 49 (97.95 %) to have the 6 good numbers (but on 8 grids of course).

@{b}Save:@{ub} This function saves all non empty grids. The result grid is not saved.

@{b}Load:@{ub} This function loads grids content.

@{b}WARNING@{ub} : the file changed since V02.02 (but the soft was only in French so perhaps you don't have it).


	@{b}2) Statistic@{ub}

The right part simulates 1000 drawings (in France there are 4 drawings by week, so it means 250 weeks, approximatively 5 years of loto).

@{b}Use:@{ub}

- Fill your 8 grids with 6 numbers by grid. If you don't fill your 8 grids, you won't be able to simulate drawings. Of course you can choose the "random" function to fill quickly your grids.
- Choose how many drawings you want
- click on the "calculate" button
The soft will know simulate all drawings and calculate how much grids with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 numbers it will have.
As there are 8 grids per drawing, it will have 8000 grids for 1000 drawings.
