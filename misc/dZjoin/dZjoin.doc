 Dieser Zug - Highscore joiner
 =============================

 version 1.0 (17.04.95)


 what?
 -----

 This little program lets you join your 'Dieser Zug'-highscore list
 with your friend's one.


 how?
 ----

 Type: dZjoin highscorefile { another_highscorefile }

 As you see, you can join more than two lists at the same time.
 Every file you feed dZjoin with will be replaced with the new
 highscore list.

 Note: The highscore-file produced by 'dieser Zug' is the
       file named 'dieserzug.data'.
