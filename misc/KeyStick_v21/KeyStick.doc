 --<  INTRODUCTION  >-------------------------------------------------------

 This program lets you use a standard one-button joystick with keyboard
 controlled games.  That is, each of the 8 directions can be assigned a key,
 as can the fire button.  I wrote this program because I had a tetris game
 that was played by keyboard only, and I wanted to use a joystick.  :)



 --<  STARTING THE PROGRAM  >-----------------------------------------------

 First off, note that the program ONLY works with Workbench 2.04 or later!
 If you're using Workbench 1.3 then the program will refuse to start.

 Also, the program ONLY works with a joystick in Port 1, ie. the one that
 the mouse is not normally plugged into.  This could change in a future
 release of the program, but it won't happen unless the demand is there,
 so write to me!  :)

 Okay, there are 3 files associated with the program, and they are:

 KeyStick           -  The main program
 KeyStick.doc       -  This documentation
 KeyStick.doc.info  -  This documentation's icon

 Ideally, these should all stay in the same directory, although the more
 experienced amongst you will do what you like with them!  Anyway, the
 program MUST be run from the CLI only; there is no Workbench support.

 Running it from Workbench will cause it to crash, and possibly reboot your
 system!  You have been warned, so make sure it's CLI only!  Why CLI and
 not Workbench?  Because it's intended for use in scripts!  :)

 The program reads its joystick direction assignments from CLI arguments.

 These are:

 x=<pos>       The horizontal screen position of the window.   -1=Centred.
 y=<pos>       The vertical screen position of the window.     -1=Centred.
 af=<0|1>      Decides if constant firing occurs.              0=No, 1=Yes.
 ad=<0|1>      Decides if constant direction movement occurs.  0=No, 1=Yes.
 f=<keycode>   The key to emulate the fire button.
 u=<keycode>   The key to emulate joystick up.
 d=<keycode>   The key to emulate joystick down.
 l=<keycode>   The key to emulate joystick left.
 r=<keycode>   The key to emulate joystick right.
 ul=<keycode>  The key to emulate joystick up and left.
 ur=<keycode>  The key to emulate joystick up and right.
 dl=<keycode>  The key to emulate joystick down and left.
 dr=<keycode>  The key to emulate joystick down and right.

 In the above, <keycode> is an ASCII keycode for the key desired.  For
 example, if you wanted the space bar to be the fire button, you would use:

 > keystick f=32  (the ASCII code for space is 32)

 If you enter no CLI arguments, the program defaults to no autofire, no
 autodir, fire for space, and up/down/left/right for cursor keys.  The
 diagonal directions (upleft/upright/downleft/downright) are not assigned.

 Don't worry if you don't know what ASCII codes are.  Why?  Well, at any
 time while the program is running and its window is deactivated, just click
 on it and the screen's title bar will display all the current ASCII values
 for the joystick and the window's current screen positions.  Just jot these
 values down for future use with the program if desired.

 You can change the assignments while the program is running simply by
 clicking on the program's window and selecting a menu option.  If you
 decide to change a key assignment, you will be asked to press the new key
 for the selected joystick action.  The new key's ASCII code will be shown
 in the screen's title bar as explained above.

 If pressing a key does not respond, then the key is NOT valid for use.
 Such keys are shift, control, alt, etc.  You can only use keys which will
 produce output in a CLI window.

 The program won't work with all games, because some games take over the
 Amiga completely.  It SHOULD work with all Workbench games and any game
 that is system-friendly (ie. uses standard Intuition screens etc).



 --<  COPYRIGHT AND DISTRIBUTION  >-----------------------------------------

 "KeyStick" is ShareWare.  This means anyone can spread it where they see
 fit.  You may upload it to BBS's, submit it to PD libraries, give it to
 your friends; whatever.  However, it is NOT a PD product; the author

 COMMERCIAL NOTE: Although this program can be freely distributed, it may
 NOT be distributed as part of a commercial package under ANY circumstances!
 Doing so will get you issued with a lawsuit, so don't consider it.  If you

 The single and ONLY exception to this commercial-related rule is when the
 program is to be included in a (CD-ROM?) compilation of PD, ShareWare or
 Freely Distributable software, such as the excellent Aminet CD collections.

 The program MUST be distributed with the following 3 files, of which NONE
 may be altered or omitted:

 KeyStick           -  The main program
 KeyStick.doc       -  This documentation

 Registering this program costs $10 Australian dollars, in cash ONLY.  What
 do you get if you register?  An improved version which reads in a text file
 containing up to 20 different game assignments.  This means you can change
 assignments from a new menu option whenever you change games, saving the
 need to re-assign on the fly or quitting and re-running the program.  :)
