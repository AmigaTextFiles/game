If you are interested in a bubble bobble fix to allow returning to system,
loading/saving games etc then mail me. This version (well some of it) should
be available through aminet soon. Obviously in order to make use of it the
original game is required.

If you are interested in an "QWAK" level editor then mail me. This may also
be available soon with the source (written in AmigaE).

In general I will upload these to aminet when I have time and once I have
worked out how to do so without breeching copyright and distribution laws.


Anyway, enjoy laserbikes - some people think it's a classic - others think
it's an addiction. Play it with 6 people and see what you think...

Any feedback would be appreciated

Whatever a lot.
