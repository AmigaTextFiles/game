History of Slots:
----------------
v2.05   9-10-94 Turns was not being updated correctly, fixed.
                Added AmigaGuide documentation.
                First Public release.

v2.04   8-11-94 Deleted an ending CR during the screen draw, so the screen
                wouldn't scroll up.

v2.03   8-08-94 Made it so you can QUIT during the HOLD phase.
                Changed some inner workings of HiScores().
                Graphical optimizations.
                Added a minimun baud check.  9600 baud or better.

v2.02   8-07-94 Moved the screen down a line, since DLG sysops need the top
                for their status line.
                Changed it so instead of hitting START to enter HOLD mode,
                it automatically goes into HOLD mode, and if you don't HOLD
                any, then it treats it as a new roll.
                Changed it so it automatically goes into HI/LO, user just
                selects QUIT (default) if they don't want to play.

v2.00   7-06-94 It has been almost a year since my last update. :)
                Changed to a keyfile system which is easier for both the user
                and me!
                Changed the registration system, see REGISTERING.
----

v1.50r  8-14-93 New config file so sysop can set the number of days a user
                has to wait before getting a new loan (which has been
                lowered to $5000 instead of the starting amount of $10k).

v1.49r  6-03-93 Changed it so if a new player doesn't gamble any of his
                money by taking a turn, he won't be listed in the high
                score list.
                Fixed problem in the monthly high score list.
                Fixed small display glitch.

v1.47r  5-17-93 Fixed it so that a player now DOES get a new loan after a
                week.  Sorry about that Rich!

v1.46r  5-10-93 Fixed it so Slots now checks for a CTRL-C (Break) everywhere
                not just in the main function.  Problem found by Bill
                Seymour.

v1.45r  5-02-93 Fixed small bug in highscore table that would not delete old
                win/lost records of players with start of new month.
                Added check to make sure win/lost doesn't go over the max
                limit.
                Fixed bug that would cause a GURU (divide by zero) because
                of a small typo.  GURU first experienced by Richard Muller.

v1.44r  4-25-93 Fixed it so that when you win the jackpot, it adds it to
                your total winnings.  Bug found by Richard Muller.

v1.43r  4-21-93 Changed the high score setup as suggested by Richard Muller.

v1.42r  4-20-93 Fixed small graphical errors.
                Fixed bug in high score list.

v1.41r  4-18-93 Fixed it so players get their turns reset.  Thanx to Richard
                Muller for pointing that out.

v1.4r   4-14-93 Changed it so player can only type numbers for bets.
                Improved argument handler.

v1.3    4-14-93 Public release version.
                Corrected The Matrix's phone number, pointed out by
                the sysop, Anthony Fiarito.
                Finished the high score list feature in the registered
                version.
                New winning ratios as requested by Richard Muller.
                Other miscellaneous changes.

v1.2    4-11-93 Added a new argument, [option], in case your BBS software
                doesn't send a '1' or 'on'.
                Added a redraw command, something that is obvious that I
                somehow forgot, pointed out by Richard Muller.

v1.1    4-11-93 Changed the <ANSI> argument to accept either a '1' or 'on'
                since some BBS's use one or the other.  Thanx to Richard
                Muller for pointing this out.

v1.0    4-10-93 Initial release.

@NODE "REGISTERING" "Registration (PLEASE!)"

@PREV "USAGE"
@TOC "MAIN"

    This game is SHAREWARE, which means that if you like this game, it is
    suggested that you pay the small fee of $10 (US Dollars only!) and
    recieve a version of Slots that saves hiscores.

    If you are the author of your own SHAREWARE program (any kind), then I
    would be willing to trade registrations (doesn't matter what the
    registration fee is, could be CARDWARE or $25+, we'll just call it even :)
    All you need to do is contact me (again, e-mail works best!)

    You can recieve SLOTS several ways:

    1. Fastest & Cheapest: I can uuencode the file to you via e-mail.
       (remember my e-mail address is link@u.washington.edu, but in case
        I lose that account, try e-mailing me at link@matrix.rain.com)
    2. You can call The Matrix (+1 503 590 5516) and I can put the
       file in your private file box which you can then download.  Be sure
       that after you create an account and get validated to leave me e-mail!
       (Another good reason to call The Matrix is that you get free Internet
       e-mail and Usenet!)
    3. Snail Mail: Be sure to include a SELF-ADDRESSED ENVELOPE with the
       APPROPRIATE postage (remember that I have to send this from the
       United States!).

    Send:

    1. Check or Money Order of the appropriate amount stating which
       option/deal you're taking.  US Dollars only PLEASE!  Make checks
       and money orders out to Steve Lee.  If you really want, then you
       can even send US$10 CASH, but be sure that the money is not easily
       visible.  I am not responsible for stolen or lost registration fees.
    2. your REAL name and handle (alias)
    3. your mailing address (where you want the program sent to) or
       e-mail address if you're taking that option.
    4. the name of your BBS
    5. phone number to your BBS
    6. if you have one, your Internet e-mail address

    to:

    Steve Lee
    1720 NW 16th St.
    Gresham, OR 97030
    USA

    By registering this program, you will encourage me to continue to
 develop programs (online games, utilities, or whatever) on the Amiga.

    If you wish to contact me for whatever reason, send mail to the above
 address or send Internet e-mail to: Link@matrix.rain.com.

    Greetings to all members of Epsilon, an NTSC demo group!

@NODE "USAGE" "How to make Slots work and configuration"
@NEXT "REGISTERING"
@PREV "DISCLAIMER"
@TOC "MAIN"

Usage:

        slots "name" <Ansi> <path> <baud> [option]

        Where <Ansi> is either a '1' or 'on' for Ansi capable.
    The <path> is where the SLOTS executable and its files are
    located.  Be sure to end the path with a : or / as needed.
    <baud> is the user's baud rate.  Due to high use of ANSI,
    9600 or better is required.  This can be overridden by putting
    a constant number in its place (ie. 9600)
    [option] is an optional argument to increase compatibility
    with other and future BBS software, you simply replace
    [option] with the text string that your BBS software sends
    saying that ANSI/Extended IBM character set is on.
        For Example:

    If your program doesn't send a '1' or 'on' but a 'Ansi On'
    then use:

        slots "<name>" <Ansi> doors:slots/ <Baud> "Ansi On"

Configuration:

    This only works for the REGISTERED version.  You can configure
    Slots by simply creating a file called "slots.config" in the
    same path as where the rest of the files are stored.

    Inside the file, you simply need three numbers seperated by
    spaces.  They are (in order): days_delay, win_amount, start_turns.

    days_delay  is the number of days a player must wait before getting
                another loan after he/she loses all of their money.
                (default = 1, next day)
    win_amount  is the amount of money needed to win the game.
                (default = 500)
    start_turns is the number of turns given per day.
                (default = 20)

Other stuff:

    Slots also creates a text file called "slots.banner" which is simply
    a text file that shows who the current winner of the game is, so you
    can display this text file if you wanted to during the login sequence.

                               DISCLAIMERS
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - I do NOT guarantee that this game will work on systems still running
      OS1.3 (isn't it time you upgraded?)
    - I take no responsibility for whatever damage this program may do.
      (although I have yet to experience any such problems).
    - I do NOT guarantee that I will program further online games nor
      do I guarantee that I will update this game further, although I will
      always try to fix any bugs found by users.
    - I do NOT guarantee that the registered version will work with your
      setup, although there is a GOOD chance the registered version will
      work if the evaluation version works :)  However, I will try to make
      it work with particular systems if those sysops write me a letter or
      send e-mail.

    The evaluation version is FREEWARE and may be distributed only with
    the rest of the files in this archive and no file may be changed without
    permission from the author.  The REGISTERED version may NOT be distributed
    under any circumstances.

                                Introduction
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

        A long time ago, a friend of mine (Richard Muller) wanted to see a
    "good" slots game on the Amiga.  Well, when I first started the project,
    I modeled the game after an MS-DOS slots door game.  It had a small
    distribution, and wasn't really that good.  A year later (I think, check
    the history part if you really care :) I was inspired again, and updated
    Slots to 2.x, and dramatically changed the game play.  It is now more
    like a real slot machine (I think anyways).

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Notes:  This online game should be compatible with any BBS software that
         takes input/output through STDIO (CON:), which include DLG Pro,
         Excelsior, Falcon, BBX, etc... The game itself creates its own
         RAW mode, so you do not need to set it so.

         I have only tested this game with OS2.x & OS3.x machines, and
         have no idea (nor guarantee) whether it works or not with OS1.3
         machines.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             Documentation
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In a CLI/SHELL, simply type "slots" for some simple instructions.
    Make a directory where you have Slots called, "Players".  Everything
    else is pretty much self-explanatory.  This part is just included
    for Bill Seymour :)

    Special thanx goes out to Steven Frank, aka Vision of Epsilon!

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                Other Stuff
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I would like to thank all of the people who have registered this game
    (Bill Seymour, Richard Muller, Mike Meyer, Tim McIntosh, and
    Tom Maruschak) and for their patience in recieving their registered
    versions.  To these five people (I hope I didn't forget anyone), you
    are all eligible to recieve a FREE keyfile for this game, just contact
    me somehow.
