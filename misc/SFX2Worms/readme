This is a small program that converts PC Worms soundfiles to separate
Amiga IFF files.

PC Worms doesn't have Minigun and Thunder samples. Minigun is replaced by
Uzi here, but Thunder isn't generated at all.

Note that on PC Worms you can use same sample data on different samples,
but on Amiga each sample is loaded separately to memory. This means that a
700k PC soundfile can result in 1.5MB of IFF samples...
