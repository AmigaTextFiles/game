NOTE TO PEOPLE who received MegaBall on a PD disk, and tried to install it
themselves but got "Can't find IconX" errors or whatever.  A number of you
have written to me about this problem.  The solution is not to install
the version that came on the PD disk, but install the version you just got
from me, which uses NO IconX or funny ASSIGN stuff, and is probably a
newer version anyway.

Hello.

Well, since you're actually reading this, you're probably one of those
people who is confused about how to install this thing.  So here are some
nice instructions.

1) Installing the req.library.
   Boot up from the disk that you will normally be booting from when you
   run the Board Editor.  This should be a hard disk if you have one.  If
   you're using a copy of the workbench floppy disk, you might need to make
   some free space on this disk (see C= manual if you do) (But DON'T delete
   the "diskfont.library" from your LIBS: directory).  Then, open a "Shell"
   or "CLI" to type in some commands, and type this one:

COPY MEGABALL2.0:libs/req.library LIBS:

2) Now, if you want to run MegaBall itself from this disk as well, you will
   also be needing a few other things:

COPY MEGABALL2.0:libs/iff.library LIBS:

COPY MEGABALL2.0:fonts FONTS: ALL

3) Now your boot disk is wired for MegaBall.  However, MegaBall itself
   doesn't need to go on that boot disk, you just need to boot from it
   before using MegaBall's editor.  Now, if you want to copy MegaBall to
   a special drawer on, say, a hard disk or something, you just make the
   drawer and then drag the icons MEGABALL2.0, BoardEd2.0, MegaBall.Music,
   and Boards into it.

That's all there is to it!

                                          --Ed.
