Chapter to discuss the connect-endconnect section
-------------------------------------------------

	connect,
	CROSS-NO,DIRECTION,CROSS-NO2,
	CROSS-NO,DIRECTION,CROSS-NO2,
	endconnect,

The section starts with the keyword 'connect' and
ends with the keyword 'endconnect'.
In between you can define so called connections, one per line.
A connection tells the programm, how the cursor in the game
can be moved. It's not important when the player is controling
the game with the mouse. But in multiplayer-mode there is no
mousecontrol and so you can only go up, down, left or right with
your cursor. But if there is no crossing in the level with exactly
the same height or width, the program will not know where to
jump to. So you have to (you can) define additional connections.

For example:
Let's say, one level would have these crossings:

       X               X

                    X
       X


The crossing will be numbered from left to right, from top to bottom:

       0               1

                    2
       3

The program will detect automatically, that the cursor can go from
0 right to 1, and from 1 left to 0, because crossing 0 and 1 are
at the same height. Also the program can see, that the cursor can
move from 0 down to 3, and from 3 up to 0, because the two crossings
are at the same width. So all there is left to do is to define the
connections to crossing 2.
	connect,
	1,d,2,
	2,u,1,
	3,r,2,
	2,l,3,
	endconnect,

The first line (1,d,2) says, that you can move from 1 down to 2.
So the numbers stand for the crossings and the letter in between
stands for:
   u = Up = Cursor up
   d = Down = Cursor down
   l = Left = Cursor left
   r = Right = Cursor right

In case of bigger levels with many crossing it can be a lot of
work to find all missing connections that must be defined. I
for myself always draw a little picture on paper in order to
not forget a link.
As long as you play with mousecontrol in OnePlayerMode, you can
completely forget connections and do without.
And if it is too hard to define them, just send me the levels
and I will see what I can do. (I've got some practise now :)
