About RushHour
==============

 The game is based on the old C64 game Traffic. It was (is) so much fun to
play it on the C64. But each time I did, I was yearning for a real
two-player mode in order to make it through to the 5th level. So I wrote
this amiga-version.
 I started developing this game in June 1996 and it is much fun. Especially
to get so much feedback, suggestions and emails!
 Without all those people on Internet, this game would still be at version
1.1.
 Thanks to everyone who wrote to me.

 I hope you enjoy playing this game.

@node Hiscores "Hiscores"
Hiscores:
=========

 A menu in the titlescreen allows you to call 3 functions for handling your
hiscores.

Export Hiscores
---------------
 This function writes all current hiscores into a file. If you think you've
got the toughest scores anywhere in the world, you can send the file via
email to @{"me" link author} and I will release it to the RushHourHomepage. I want to make a
file with the best RushHourPlayers and their hiscores. Who knows? It might
be @{U}you@{UU}.


Import Hiscores
---------------
 This function reads a hiscorefile created with the export-function and
merges the hiscores with the current hiscores of the game.

There are two ways of merging:

 * @{I}all entries@{UI}
   All entries will be merged. So may be if you import 10 entries that are
   better, your own entries are gone.

 * @{I}only 5 per table@{UI}
   Only max. 5 entries will be imported so that at least 5 of your own
   entries will survive. Advisable if you feel you're not @{B}that@{UB} tough.

 Entries that have the same score and name will not be merged. So if you
import the same file two or more times, nothing changes anymore.


View Hiscorefile
----------------
 This function lets you take a look at a hiscorefile. May be you want to do
this before importing it.

@node Game "Mission"
Objective:
==========

 You have to switch the traffic-lights in order to keep the cars (objects)
running. The level ends, if too many cars are waiting outside the visible
screen (more than 25 in total or more than 9 in one street). For every car
that is leaving the screen you get 1 point.

 If the To-Do number (displayed on the right) has reached 0, you are
allowed to enter the next level (otherwise you will lose).

 When the To-Do-counter reaches zero, you enter some sort of bonus-mode.
The background becomes blue and the cars starts pouring in. Try to make as
much points as you can before the level ends.


TrafficLightRobots:
===================

 In OnePlayerMode some levels offer you one or more so called TrafficLight-
Robots. These are automatic traffic-light changers. To place a robot,
choose the crossing you want to include a 'bot by clicking it with the
mouse. They will switch the trafficlight after 4 seconds when there are
more than 3 cars waiting. After 10 seconds it will switch the 'lights even
if not enough cars are waiting. However, you can still override them and
switch the trafficlight on your own if you think that this is nessecary.


Urgent Cars:
============

 Sometimes in the external levels, a blinking car appears that carries a
number. This number starts at 9 and counts down to zero if the car is
waiting. When the `urgent car' is leaving, the remaining number is
multiplied by 5 and added as bonus points to the players score. So make
sure those urgent cars get through without too much waiting!

@endnode
@node Special "Configurations"

Music-Directories:
==================

 Now there are 3 different directories for the music-modules:

   titlemodules/    for titlemusic
   modules3/        for InGameMusic with 3 channels
   modules4/        for InGameMusic with 4 channels

 If you want to hear something else during the game then simply copy new
unpacked protracker-mods into the appropriate directory. If there is more
than one mod in one dir, the program selects the modules randomly. The
modules in the directory modules3/ should be special 3-channel-mods,
allocating only channel 0 to 2, leaving channel 3 free for SFX. These
modules are used if option InGameAudio=MUSIC&SFX.
@endnode
@node Level "DIY levels"
How to design new levels to 'Rushhour'
======================================

 Welcome to the glorious world of level-creation! With this step-by-step
guide, you just @{U}might@{UU} master the skills of a levelcreator! Here we go:

 @{U}Part I: The starting line@{UU}

 Now let us say you want to make a new level (or a city), where you can
create chaos. :) In this example, you have decided to make a city with a
total of 5 levels. The city name is (in this example) 'DOLORES'. (Hey, you
gotta start somewhere!). So, go to the shell (or your favourite file-
manager), go to the directory /data in your 'RushHour'-directory and type:

 makedir DOLORES

 You now have a city-directory, which is at the moment empty. Now, copy an
existing 'level.txt' from any city-directory. Leave the 'level.txt' alone,
because now you're going to make some levels.

 @{U}Part II: Making some levels@{UU}

 Now comes the fun part: run the Leveleditor which came with the game (and
if not, contact the author). And then you just make some nice levels, just
remember these rules of thumb:

 * Never make one-way roads, or roads wide as 1 tile or 3. They @{B}must@{UB} be 2
   tiles wide, otherwise it just doesn't work!

 * Crossroads and/or T-junctions must be 3 tiles apart, because of the
   traffic-lights!

 * There @{B}must@{UB} be at least 3 tiles distance between the edge and a crossing!

      @{"Keyboard commands" link Keys} for the editor.

 To create trafficlights, make a T-junction or a crossroad. The game will
make the trafficlights for you.
 Keep in mind that the editor might act funny, so be careful.

 When you have completed a level, save the level in the 'DOLORES'-directory
and start a new level. Continue until you have five levels.

 @{U}Part III: Editing level.txt@{UU}

 Now comes the trickiest part: you'll have to edit the 'level.txt' to make
it work.
 Start your favourite text-editor, and load 'level.txt'. Replace the
'templates' with required numbers (or texts).

 @{"'LEVELNAME1'" link a1},@{"PALETTE" link a2},@{"BACKITEM" link a3},@{"GFX" link a4},
         @{"DELAY,RANDOM,TODO," link b1}    [This is for the easy-mode,]
         @{"DELAY,RANDOM,TODO," link b1}    [this is for the medium-mode,]
         @{"DELAY,RANDOM,TODO," link b1}    [and this for the hard-mode]
*        @{"robots,#" link c1}
*	 @{"connect," link d1}
*	 @{"CROSS-NO,DIRECTION,CROSS-NO2," link d1}
*	 @{"CROSS-NO,DIRECTION,CROSS-NO2," link d1}
*	 @{"endconnect," link d1}
*	 @{"title" link e1} "[Insert your Get Ready-message here]"
@{"end" link e1}

 (* = Optional)

 Create 4 more. (To get the amount of 5 levels we agreed in the first place)
 Save the 'level.txt' and start RushHour. Select 'Dolores' from the city-
selector and start playing!

 @{U}Part IV: Making it better@{UU}

 Right, you've played your nifty new level. What now?
 If something went terribly wrong and the game came to a tilt, there might
just be a slight mistake in your levels, 'level.txt' or even found a very
@{"nasty bug" link author}! The level was just too hard or it was too easy.
 Readjust settings. Add new things. Remove old things. Drink coffee. Only
when you are happy with your level you can spread the damn thing anywhere
you want it to be! (Don't go extreme with this one, okay?)
 You can also give your homemade city to @{"me" link author}. I will then add your city with
the next version of Rushhour!
@endnode
@node a2 "PALETTE"
PALETTE
=======
 
 Of value 0-3. Changes the palette of the level.

 0 = Blue and green
 1 = Green
 2 = Blue
 3 = Green and grey
@endnode
@node a3 "BACKITEM"
BACKITEM
========

 Value of 0-3. Tells the game what background should be used.

 0 = Border-box
 1 = Double-cross (Don't try it on your friends)
 2 = Small boxed
 3 = Big boxes
@endnode
@node a4 "GFX"
GFX
===

 Value of 0-4. Defines the shape of the cars.

 0 = Long boxy kind of thingies
 1 = Small cars
 2 = Non-flying saucers (but they do move!)
 3 = Triangled cars
 4 = A box that can move itself
@endnode
@node b1 "DELAY,RANDOM,TODO"
DELAY
=====

 Value of 5-20. Defines the frequency for the appearence of the cars.
5 is the fastest, 20 is the slowest.

RANDOM
======

 Value of 0-7. Probability for that a car really appeares after DELAY.
0 means that cars come flooding, 7 means they are a bit rare.

TODO
====

 Cars to leave the screen before the bonus-mode turns on.

@endnode
@node e1 "title"
title
=====
 This command gives you a opportunity to replace the boring 'Get Ready'-
message with words of stupidity! All you have to do is to write 'title' and
in quotation marks (") your wanna-be 'Get Ready' text!
 Here's an example to end all examples:

       title "This is a nifty 'Get Ready'-message.
You can insert your name here (or your sisters).
OR you can even put your own phonenumber here (or your sisters).
In other words you can put anything you want.
Well, ok, no dirty words... :)"

 There! You can write a maximum of 9 to 10 lines and # characters per line.
@endnode
@node c1 "robots,#"
robots,#
========

 Trafficlight-robots. These are optional. Never exceed beyond the number of
trafficlights!
@endnode
@node d1 "connect ... endconnect"
connect ... endconnect
======================

 The section starts with the keyword 'connect,' and ends with the keyword
'endconnect,'. In between you can define the so called connections, which
is one per line. A connection tells the program where the cursor is moved.
It's not important when the player is controling the game by a mouse or
simiral to that. But in multiplayer-mode there is no mousecontrol and so
you can only go up, down, left or right with your cursor. But if there is
no crossing in the level with exactly the same height or width, the program
doesn't know where to jump to. So you have to (if you want to) define
additional connections.

 For example:
 Let's say, one level would have these crossings:

       X               X     

                    X
       X

 The crossing will be numbered from left to right, from top to bottom:

       0               1

                    2
       3

 The program will detect automatically, that the cursor can go from 0 right
to 1, and from 1 left to 0, because crossing 0 and 1 are at the same
height. Also the program can see, that the cursor can move from 0 down to
3, and from 3 up to 0, because the two crossings are at the same width. So
all there is left to do is to define the connections to crossing 2.

	connect,
	1,d,2,
	2,u,1,
	3,r,2,
	2,l,3,
	endconnect,

 The first line (1,d,2) says that you can move from 1 down to 2. So the
numbers stands for the crossings and the letter stands for:

   u = Up = Cursor up
   d = Down = Cursor down
   l = Left = Cursor left
   r = Right = Cursor right

 In cases of bigger levels with many crossing it can be a lot of work to
find all missing connections that must be defined. I for myself always draw
a little picture on a piece of paper in order for not forget a link. As
long as you play with mousecontrol in OnePlayerMode, you can completely
forget connections and do without it. And if it is too hard to define them,
just send the levels to @{"me" link author} and I will see what I can do. (I've got some
practise now :)
@endnode
@node e1 "end"

 Tells the program that it was the last level. Preferably put this in the
end of the last level. ;)
